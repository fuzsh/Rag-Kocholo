They beganwork in NIGERIA, where Gowans and Kent bothsuccumbed to the climate and died in 1894. Bing-ham returned to his home in Toronto, Ontario, toregroup. With new backing, he was able to estab-lish an initial station in Nigeria in 1902; fromthere efforts spread to Niger, Ethiopia, and UpperVolta (Burkina Faso). From Ethiopia, SIM person-nel were finally able to reach today’s country ofSudan in 1936. Subsequently efforts spread toBENIN, the Central African Republic, Cote d’Ivoire,ERITREA, Ghana, GUINEA,KENYA,LIBERIA, Malawi,SENEGAL,SOUTHAFRICA, and Togo.Meanwhile, in SOUTHAMERICA, an independentwork that began in Bolivia in 1907 by a NewZealand couple evolved into the Andes EvangelicalMission. The mission grew to include work inChile, ECUADOR, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. Thismovement merged with SIM in 1982. Seven yearslater, SIM absorbed the work of the InternationalChristian Fellowship in BANGLADESH,CHINA,INDIA,Mongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, and Pakistan.Finally, after a century of working primarily in Cen-tral Africa, in 1998, SIM joined with the AFRICAEVANGELICALFELLOWSHIP, which brought with itwork in ANGOLA, Botswana, GABON, Madagascar,Mauritius, Reunion, Mozambique, Namibia, Swazi-land, Tanzania, Zambia and ZIMBABWE.The Sudan Interior Mission changed its namein the 1980s to Serving in Mission; it is nowknown globally as SIM International. As the newcentury began, SIM supported personnel in morethan 40 countries. Much of its older work hasmatured into autonomous churches such as theSudan Interior Church in Sudan and the Evange-listic Church of West Africa in Nigeria.Further reading:Rowland Brigham, Seven Sevens ofYears and a Jubilee: The Story of the Sudan InteriorMission(Toronto: Evangelical Publishers, 1943); J.du Plessis, A History of Christian Missions in SouthAfrica(Cape Town, South Africa: C.

He learned yoga and in his teensmade the vows of a sanyassin(the renounced life)and began wandering through India as a sadhu,orholy man.He interrupted his wandering life to attendcollege in Calcutta. A British colleague introducedSundar Singh to the Bible and Christianity, but hecared for neither and became openly hostile afterhis graduation. However, after burning a Biblebefore his father, he had a transforming vision ofJesus Christ while praying in his bedroom. On his16th birthday, in 1905, he was baptized at St.Thomas Anglican Church in Simla; however,K522Swain, Clara rather than joining the congregation he decided tocontinue his role as a sadhuand wear the saffronrobe of one living on the charity of others. Overhis father’s condemnation, he became a wander-ing, celibate Christian evangelist. His only posses-sion was a New Testament. He was convinced thathe could best introduce Christianity to his fellowcountrymen as a sanyassin.For a few months, Sundar Singh studied at theSt. John School of Theology in Lahore, but thenresumed his travels across the Punjab and intoAfghanistan. Those who knew him dubbed himthe “apostle of the bleeding feet.” In 1914, whilepreaching in Nepal, he was arrested and throwninto a well to die for spreading another religion.He escaped and when recaptured was expelledfrom the country.Sundar Singh traveled throughout INDIAandS RILANKA. Between 1918–19 he visited Malaysia,JAPAN,CHINA, western Europe, Australia, andIsrael (1920–22). His travels made him famous, atleast among Western Christians. He won manyfriends by his effort to live a Christlike life. Hecontinued traveling through the 1920s. Then in1929 he set off for Tibet and was never seen again.Sundar Singh provided a new pattern for theIndian appropriation of Christianity, one appreci-ated by Indians who had rejected European Chris-tian forms. He opened Christians to the richheritage of the Indian religions, providing a newway for the church to indigenize. Through per-sonal meetings, correspondence, and books heinfluenced a number of prominent Christian lead-ers, from British writer C. S. LEWISto Indianbishop Aiyadurai Jesudasen APPASAMY. AmongSudar Singh’s books on Christian spirituality andliving are: At the Master’s Feet(1922), Reality andReligion(1923), Search After Reality(1924), Spiri-tual Life(1925), Spiritual World(1926), Real Life(1927), With and Without Christ(1928), and Lifein Abundance(1980).Further reading:C.

Robert RaikesSweden523JMethodist Clara Swain (1834–1910) pio-neered (1735–1811) began the movement in 1780 inresponse to the widespread employment of chil-dren in British factories, mines, and other busi-nesses for long hours six days a week. Sundaybecame a day for rowdiness that for many youthsbecame a prelude to a life of crime. Owner of theGloucester Journal,Robert Raikes at first consid-ered the problem a social nuisance. He wanted togive the young people an education and a sense ofmoral involvement in society.Raikes decided to set up a school on Sundays,the only day many children were free. He paid forfour female teachers to teach the children to read.With the assistance of a local pastor, Rev. ThomasStock, Raikes had soon enrolled some 100 childrenin these schools. They met from 10 . . to 2 . . forA MPMreading lessons and then received instruction in thecatechism at church through the late afternoon.Observers believed the school was soon work-ing a marvelous transformation on the pupils.City leaders noticed a drop in the local crime rate.Raikes mobilized public support and used hisprinting press to publish needed school materials.By 1785, Londoners formed a Sunday school soci-ety to assist the cause. By 1786, the first suchschool was opened in Virginia; soon similarschools were functioning throughout the UnitedStates. The first in Canada opened in 1811.The movement got a significant boost in 1817with the founding of the Sunday and Adult SchoolUnion of Philadelphia, which in 1824 evolvedinto the American Sunday School Union, anational organization designed to found Sundayschools in needy communities and distribute lit-erature to the teachers and their pupils. Beginningin 1844, the movement received the support ofmost Protestant DENOMINATIONSand spread toevery part of the growing country.In the last half of the 19th century, with theintroduction of child labor laws and the spread ofelementary public education, the nature of Sun-day schools changed. They became primarily aninstrument to instruct the next generation in theBible, church teachings, and religious piety. Formany churches, it was where children had theirfirst religious experiences.Among the leaders in this transformation wasMethodist John Heyl Vincent (1832–1920). As apastor, Vincent developed a variety of innovativeeducational techniques including the use of nor-mal (teacher training) classes. His Sunday schoolteacher training spread through the MethodistEpiscopal Church in the 1860s. In 1866, he pub-lished the first periodical of Sunday school lessons. His work led in 1872 to an interdenom-inational Uniform Lesson Plan. He soon becameactive in the Chautauqua movement, an earlyadult education effort based at Chautauqua Lake,New York, where he established a Sunday SchoolInstitute that offered two weeks of intensiveleadership training.Church Sunday schools were particularlyimportant in the United States, where the separationof church and state kept religious education out ofthe public schools (a major structure for passing thefaith in most European countries). The Sundayschool (now generally called the church school inmost denominations) has continued to evolve butremains a solid part of congregational life.An initial World Sunday School Conventionwas held in London in 1889, out of which came theWorld’s Sunday School Association, which evolvedinto the World Council of Christian Education in1947. In 1971, the council merged into the WORLDCOUNCIL OFCHURCHES’ Office of Education. Thebroad acceptance of the Sunday school and theacceptance of denominational responsibility forpublishing Sunday school literature made theAmerican Sunday School Union obsolete. In 1974,it reorganized as the American Missionary Fellow-ship and reoriented its program to the evangelizingof unchurched persons in the United States.PRIMITIVEBAPTISTSrejected Sunday schools asan unbiblical modern innovation. A variety ofMennonite groups rejected them as well.Further reading:Frank Booth, Robert Raikes ofGloucester(Surrey, U.K.: National Christian Educa-tion Council, 1980); Anne M.

While teaching school, she read corre-spondence from a female physician noting the needfor more women doctors. She moved to Philadel-phia to attend the Women’s Medical College.In 1869, women in the Methodist EpiscopalChurch (now a constituent part of the UNITEDMETHODISTCHURCH) organized the Woman’s For-eign Missionary Society, with the idea of extend-ing the Gospel “to women by women.” While stillstudying medicine, Swain heard of the society’splans to send a doctor to INDIAand applied for theposition. She was selected and became one of thetwo first female missionaries commissioned by thesociety, the other being Isabella THOBURN.Swain arrived in Bareilly, India, on January 20,1870, and immediately went to work. Within thefirst year, she treated more than 1,300 patientsand trained a number of women to assist her.Apart from a three-year furlough (1876–80), sheremained at Bareilly until 1884. That year shetraveled to Khetri State in Rajputana to treat theRani Saheba. Her treatment worked, and she wasoffered a position at court to attend to the healthof the women and, in her spare time, operate aclinic and a girls’ school. She seized the opportu-nity to work where Christianity was otherwise notpresent, without any expense to the society. Shestayed in Rajputana for the next 12 years until sheretired due to ill health in 1896.Swain died on Christmas Day, 1910, in Castile,New York. The work she began in Bareilly as aclinic for women and children evolved into theClara Swain Hospital, the oldest and largestMethodist hospital in India.See alsoMEDICAL MISSIONS.Further reading:Wade Crawford Barclay, History ofMethodist Missions,vol. 3, Widening Horizons,1845–1895(New York: The Board of Missions of theMethodist Church, 1957); Dana L.

In response, Gustavus Vasa (1523–60)led a revolt that overthrew the Danes. GustavusVasa took the throne of an independent Sweden asGustav I.Gustav’s actions coincided with the rise of theReformation. The new Lutheran faith had an extraattraction for Gustav, as he confiscated theCatholic Church’s many property holdings to paythe debts incurred in the Danish war.In several steps through the 1520s,LUTHERANISMgained dominance: the king becamehead of the church; Lutheran dogma was formallyendorsed; the New Testament was translated intoSwedish; and a new Swedish LITURGYreplaced theold Latin one. The spread of Lutheranism culmi-nated in 1634, when a new constitution requiredall Swedes to adhere to the AUGSBURGCONFESSIONOFFAITH.In 1741, recognition was granted to theAnglican and Reformed (Calvinist) Churches,which primarily served expatriates living inStockholm. In 1781, the government issued anEdict of Toleration that extended some degree ofreligious freedom to all who professed Christian-ity. The edict provided cover for the many FreeChurch movements that had either emerged inthe country or were introduced from abroad, pri-marily England or the United States. SwedesSwitzerland525J began to migrate to North America in the 17thcentury, and by the 19th century, Americans ofSwedish descent formed a sizable portion of theAmerican Lutheran community. Swedish Ameri-cans formed several Lutheran SYNODSthat havesubsequently merged into the EvangelicalLutheran Church in America.The most important of the 19th-century move-ments to emerge in Sweden was the MissionCovenant Church, which grew out of a revivalmovement initiated by Karl Olof Rosenius(1816–68). Rosenius organized people into con-venticles, informal groups outside of the control ofLutheran authorities, which placed emphasis on apersonal religious life. He also developed a newhymnody. Independent congregations emergedthrough the middle of the century, and in 1817they established a formal organization as a newDENOMINATION. Many followers of Rosenius joinedthe Swedish migration to America and became thesource of the Evangelical Free Church and theEvangelical Covenant Church in America.Other groups began to populate the religiouslandscape, including Methodists (1826), BAPTISTS(1848), and the SALVATIONARMY(1882). The FreeChurch movement had a rather inauspiciousbeginning in 1830, when English MethodistGeorge Scott got permission to build a “revivalist”church, Methodist in belief and practice, thatremained within the Church of Sweden; Scott alsobegan a periodical, Pietisten.Several years later,while in the United States, he made some com-ments interpreted as insulting to Swedes and wasbanned from the country.PENTECOSTALISMwas introduced in 1907 fromNorway. The first congregation was organized in1913. The Pentecostal congregations eschewedpan-congregational structures, but have been ableto accomplish a significant amount of work withan informal fellowship. Swedish Pentecostal mis-sionaries have, for example, been in the forefrontof the spread of Pentecostalism around the world.Lewi Pethrus (1884–1974) was the most domi-nant voice of the movement. A Baptist who con-verted under the ministry of Thomas B. Barrett(1862–1940), he was for many years the pastor ofthe Philadelphia Church in Stockholm.The Mission Covenant Church and the Pente-costal movement are the largest Protestant groupsoutside of the Church of Sweden, between themclaiming as much as 10 percent of the Christiancommunity.Through the 20th century, significant changeshave occurred in the Church of Sweden, though itretained its dominant position in society. Eachperson whose parents are not a member ofanother religious body is automatically entered onthe church rolls. The church continues to assumesome responsibility for the Swedish population asa whole, performing most marriages and burials.Since the introduction of a new law on religiousfreedom in 1951, an individual may formallywithdraw from membership. While few havetaken that option, several million have indicatedin various surveys that they no longer considerthemselves Christian and have adopted an agonis-tic or atheist outlook and lifestyle. The LutheranChurch of Sweden counts some 65 percent of thepopulation as affiliated.Through the century, the church was able tooffer important leadership to the Lutheran commu-nity internationally. Several Swedish Lutheranchurch leaders have become widely known fortheir contributions to theology and ecumenism,most notably Bishop Nathan Soderblom(1886–1931), Anders Nygren (1890–1978), GustavAulen (1879–1978), and Archbishop Erling Eidem(1880–1972). The Swedish church was influentialin the formation of the WORLDCOUNCIL OFCHURCHESin 1948, and in 1968 hosted the council’sfourth meeting at Uppsala. Nygren served as thefirst president of the LUTHERANWORLDFEDERATION.Further reading:L. S. Hunter, Scandinavian Churches:a Picture of the Development of the Churches of Den-mark, Norway, Finland, Iceland, and Sweden(London:K526synod Faber & Faber, 1965); R. Murray, ed., The Church ofSweden: Past and Present,trans. by N. G. Sahlin(Malmo, Sweden: Alhrm, 1960); Anders Nygren, ed.,This Is the Church(Philadelphia: Muhlenberg Press,1952; Swedish ed., 1943); Margareta Skog, ed., Detreligiösa Sverige(Orebro: Bokförlaget Libris, 2001).SwitzerlandSwitzerland was one of the two countries wherethe Reformation began and from which it spread.The call for reform began in Zurich, where UlrichZWINGLI(1484–1531) had in 1518 been called asthe people’s priest for the Grossmünster or GreatChurch, the center of the canton’s religious estab-lishment. Under Zwingli, the Reformation spreadthrough German-speaking cantons, though afterhis untimely death in 1531, the center shifted toGeneva, where John CALVIN(1509–64) took theleading role in developing French-speakingProtestantism. Calvin also offered a viable com-promise interpretation of the sacraments betweenZwingli’s acts of remembrance and MartinLUTHER’s almost Catholic sacramentalism. Calvin’ssolution, which affirmed Christ’s spiritual pres-ence in the sacrament, unified the various seg-ments of Swiss Protestantism.In the 1520s, the German-speaking cantons ofZurich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhouse become pre-dominantly Protestant. In the 1530s, French-speaking Neuchâtel and Geneva were added to theProtestant camp. The single Italian-speaking can-ton remained Roman Catholic. Geneva’s peculiarrole in the development of Protestantism was fur-ther accented in 1559, when Calvin founded theAcademy for the training of pastors and otherchurch leaders. It quickly developed an interna-tional student body.Switzerland remained split between Protestantand Roman Catholic establishments at the start ofthe 19th century, but the country later becameradically pluralistic. From the beginning of theReformation, Switzerland had been home to dis-senting Protestant Free Church groups, initiallythe Swiss BRETHRENand then the MENNONITES.Later the AMISHmovement was begun by a SwissMennonite, Jacob Amman (b. c. 1644). However,serious challenges to the authority of theReformed Church did not take place until the19th century. Switzerland was one of the firstlands into which the Plymouth Brethren move-ment spread, founder John Nelson DARBYhavingresided in the country for several years in the1830s. It now exists in both its exclusive and open527TAFJ: (CHRISTIANBRETHREN) branches. The BaptistUnion dates to the 1840s.The Reformed Church had always existed as aset of different churches, one in each canton(whether the established or a minority church). Inthe 19th century, these churches began to cooper-ate more closely, resulting in the present Federa-tion of Swiss Protestant Churches. It now includesthe 22 cantonal Reformed Churches, the Evangel-ical-Methodist Church of Switzerland, and theFree Church of Geneva. The HELVETICCONFESSION(1558) serves as a common statement of faith. Inthe 19th century, the Swiss became heavilyinvolved in the worldwide Protestant missionaryendeavor through such groups as the Basel Mis-sion, founded in 1815. The first major break inProtestant unity in Switzerland occurred in theCanton of Vaud, where a group of Reformed min-isters and members left in 1846 in protest againststate intrusions into church life.In the 20th century, a spectrum of Protestantand Free Church groups settled in Switzerland, theJEHOVAH S’ WITNESSESand the Pentecostals beingpossibly the largest. The ASSEMBLIES OFG OD(basedin the United States) now report some 25,000members, just behind the Fellowship of PentecostalFree Churches. Both groups were founded in the1960s. In 1919, the Jehovah’s Witnesses suffered aschism that led to the formation of the Friends ofMan under Alexander Freytag (1870–1947), whichhas remained the largest Free Church group in thecountry. As many as 100 additional Protestant andFree Church groups now have congregations inSwitzerland, some serving expatriate communities.Following World War II, Switzerland took onan additional significant role in the Protestantworld when the headquarters of the WORLDCOUN-CIL OFCHURCHESwas located in Geneva. TheWCC’s presence further attracted the LUTHERANWORLDFEDERATIONand the WORLDALLIANCE OFREFORMEDCHURCHESto locate their headquartersand the WORLDMETHODISTCOUNCILto place itsEuropean office in the same building. Althoughthe WORLDEVANGELICALALLIANCEchose to locateits regional headquarters in London, it has affili-ated members among the many Swiss FreeChurches that organized locally into the Schweiz-erische Evangelische Allianz.Switzerland divides almost equally among res-idents with Protestant and Catholic sympathies,with some 44 percent of the population in eachgroup. The remaining population adheres to East-ern Orthodox Christian or non-Christian groups.Further reading:Jean-Jacques Bauswein and LukasVischer, eds., The Reformed Family Worldwide: A Surveyof Reformed Churches, Theological Schools, and Interna-tional Organizations(Grand Rapids, Mich.: William B.Eerdmans, 1999); Claude Bovay, L’évolution de l’apparte-nance religieuse et confessionnelle en Suisse(Bern: OfficeFédéral de la Statistique, 1997); Pamela Johnson andRobert W.

Reinhardt, 1994).synodThe term synoddescribes a wide variety of gath-erings of church leaders for the purpose of devel-oping policy on church life. As such, synods maybe occasional and informal, or regularly held leg-islative bodies that create and maintain the legalstructure of a church or denomination. The lat-ter is usually the case among Protestant churchesthat have synods. In some churches, as with theLUTHERANCHURCH–MISSOURISYNOD, the highestlegislative body of the church is its synod. Itexists as a creature of the member congregationsand has charge over the church’s various nationalboards and agencies. As such, it is analogous to,for example, the General Conference of theUNITEDMETHODISTCHURCH, or the GeneralCouncil of the UNITEDCHURCH OFCANADA, or theGeneral Assembly of the CHURCH OFGOD OFPROPHECY.Within the Reformed tradition, the synod (orclassis) is an intermediate structure between thepresbytery, a set of congregations in close geo-graphical proximity, and the national (or interna-tional) assembly. Typical of the Reformedtradition, the Presbyterian Church in Canada’smany congregations were as of 2003 organizedinto 46 presbyteries, which in turn have consti-tuted eight synods. The eight synods cometogether annually for the meeting of the generalassembly.The CHURCH OFENGLANDdescribes itself as anepiscopal body (with more than 108 BISHOPS), butit is governed by its General Synod, a delegatedbody that includes both laity and clergy from eachdiocese. The General Synod meets semi-annuallyto legislate on matters before the church. OtherAnglican jurisdictions around the world have sim-ilar synodal structures.See alsoCONSISTORY POLITY; .Further reading:Joan S.

His father was apharmacist, but also a Methodist local preacher.Hudson had a conversion experience at age 15and a call to full-time Christian service. He wenton to study medicine at the London Hospital, withCHINAalready in mind as his field of work.Lacking formal theological training or anyother university credentials, he was turned downwhen he first applied to mission agencies in theearly 1850s. He was also sickly. However, thenewly formed and inexperienced China Evange-lization Society gave him the opportunity.Taylor spent six years (1854–60) in Shanghai,Swatow, and Ningpo. In the meantime, the ChinaEvangelization Society disbanded, and Taylor wasforced to find alternative sources while continuingas an independent missionary. During his lastyears in this first stay in China, he became head ofa hospital in Ningpo.Illness forced his return to England in 1860,where he translated the New Testament into theNingpo dialect, finished his medical training, andwrote his first book, China, Its Spiritual Need andClaims(1865). He completed his stay by foundingthe CHINA NLANDIMISSION(1865) and raising thefirst group of missionaries to go out under its aus-pices. In 1866, with 16 missionaries and his wife,he returned to China.As executive director of his new agency, Taylorspent his time moving around the countrysidecoordinating the work of his growing staff of mis-Temple, William529J sionaries, and returning home to secure newrecruits and raise funds. In 1888, he openedoffices in North America (where he found an allyin evangelist Dwight L. MOODY) and in 1890 inAUSTRALIA. He also cooperated with missionaryagencies in Europe, which sent missionaries towork under Taylor’s direction. He wrote severalbooks, including: Union and Communion(1893);A Retrospect(1894); Separation and Service(1898); and A Ribbon of Blue, and other Bible Stud-ies(1899).In 1900, he began to shift his responsibilitiesto Dixon Edward Hoste (1861–1946) and settledin SWITZERLAND. He died on a visit to China onJune 3, 1905. At the time of his death, the ChinaInland Mission oversaw more than 900 missionar-ies (including wives) scattered across the country.Like other Christian organizations working inChina, the mission was thoroughly disrupted bythe exile of its missionaries in 1950–51. WithChina closed, it redirected its efforts to othercountries, initially in Southeast Asia, and reorgan-ized itself as the Overseas Missionary Fellowship(or OMF International).See alsoFAITH MISSIONS.Further reading:Cyril James Davey, On the Clouds toChina: The Story of Hudson Taylor(London: Lutter-worth Press, 1964); Marshal Broomhall, The ManWho Believed in God: Hudson Taylor(London: Hod-der & Stoughton, 1936); Grace Stott, Twenty-SixYears of Missionary Work in China . . .

It came into its own in the 1970s, andrevolutionized RELIGIOUS BROADCASTING.Prior to that time, with few exceptions, reli-gious programming on television had been limitedto modest shows on weekends, usually Sundaymornings, with primarily a local or regional reach.K530The Evangelical Alliance Mission TEAM headquarters in Wheaton, Illinois(Institute for the Study of American Religion, Santa Bar- The huge growth in the number of TV stationsand improvements in technology created opportu-nities for independent ministers from nonmain-stream DENOMINATIONS, which had previously beendenied access to the networks.In the 1960s, Pat Robertson (b. 1930) foundedthe Christian Broadcast Network, and in the1970s a growing number of stations linked toCBN. Satellites and cable made it possible to coverthe country with relatively inexpensive programs.With networks like CBN, soon joined by TrinityBroadcasting Network, programming could go onevery day and at all hours. Both the opportunityand the need to fill 24 hours a day with program-ming led to the development of talk-show formats(the initial model being Robertson’s 700 Club)andthe inclusion of news coverage from a Christianperspective.The heightened presence of religious (specifi-cally conservative Protestant) programming ontelevision attracted widespread attention by theend of the 1970s. It became a national issue afterpopular television minister Jerry Falwell (b. 1932)allied himself with political activists to found theMoral Majority, in hopes of bringing alienatedconservative Christians into the political process.Falwell aimed at countering legal abortions, thegrowing visibility of homosexuals, the abandon-ment of prayer in public schools, and other “lib-eral” phenomena.The initial success of the Moral Majority, thenthe primary organization of the RELIGIOUSRIGHT,attracted scholars to examine religious broadcast-ing on television. Sociologist Jeffrey Hadden(1936–2003) coined the term televangelismin1981. In the meantime, there was a parallelgrowth in Christian radio, with hundreds of newstations syndicating new national programs.In spite of complaints that its political aspectswere breaching the wall of separation betweenchurch and state, the world of televangelism grewtremendously in the 1980s. In 1988, Pat Robert-son ran for the Republican presidential nomina-tion. His failure to attract support happened tocoincide with the start of a series of scandals whenRobertson associate Jim Bakker (b. 1940) wasaccused of adultery and major financial misman-agement, the very successful Jimmy Swaggart (b.1935) was accused of sexual misconduct, and sev-eral lesser scandals were aired. Falwell dissolvedthe Moral Majority. Though superseded by a newChristian Coalition, the political clout of the tele-vangelists never returned to its pre-1988 level.Nevertheless, Christian television survived thetemporary loss of financial support and emergedin the mid-1990s stronger than ever. As the newcentury began, both CBN and TBN had adaptedsuccessfully to cable television; both were broad-cast worldwide via cable and satellite.Measuring the size of the Christian televisionaudience is difficult; measuring its usefulness as anevangelism tool is even more so. However, there islittle doubt that it supplies weekday religious enter-Isabella Thoburn (1840–1901), a pioneerfemale missionary in India(Drew UniversityThoburn, Isabella531J tainment for millions of dedicated conservativeChristians and that it has, in secular terms, added adiversity of ideas to the popular culture.Until the 1990s, the televangelism phenome-non was largely confined to the United States. Inthe 1990s, however, its international potential wasbeing exploited. Cable has enabled religiousbroadcasting to reach countries that otherwiseblock such programs from broadcast stations,often government owned. Among the more recentadditions, in January 2004 the SEVENTH DAY-ADVENTISTCHURCHbegan broadcasting to Europevia a new satellite vehicle, the Hope Channel.Further reading:Steve Bruce, Pray TV: Televangelismin America(London: Routledge, 1990); Jerry D.Cardwell, Mass Media Christianity: Televangelism andthe Great Commission(New York: University Press ofAmerica, 1984); Jeffrey K.

After studying atOxford, Temple taught philosophy there atQueen’s College (1907–10), during which time hewas ordained a priest. In 1908, he became head-master of Repton School and four years laterbegan a lengthy tenure as rector of St. James Pic-cadilly, a large church in central London. While atSt. James, he wrote the first of his several books,Mens Creatrix(1917). He was a strong advocate ofgreater self-governance for the Church of Englandand won a partial victory in 1919 when thechurch’s assembly was established.Temple was named bishop of Manchester in1921, archbishop of York in 1929, and archbishopof Canterbury in 1942. He wrote his most impor-tant book while at York, Nature, Man, and God(1934), originally delivered as the Gifford Lec-tures at the University of Glasgow.Temple’s ecumenical career began in 1924with his chairmanship of the Conference onChristian Politics, Economics and Citizenshipthat met in Birmingham, England. In 1928, hedrafted the statement accepted by the JerusalemMissionary Conference. He went on to chair the1937 FAITH ANDORDERCONFERENCEin Edinburghin 1937, where it was decided to found the WORLDCOUNCIL OFCHURCHES. The next year he waselected chairman of the first provisional confer-ence to create the WCC.Temple died during World War II.Further reading:F. A.

It grew out of the ministry of Fredrik Franson(1852–1908), who was born and raised in SWEDEN.A capable student, he became fluent in several lan-guages prior to his migrating at the age of 17. Hebecame a farmer in Nebraska. During a period ofillness, he began the search for salvation that ledhim to the Baptist Church, in which he was bap-tized at the age of 20. Several years later, havingbecome interested in evangelism, he moved toChicago and joined Dwight L. MOODY’s church.In 1875, Franson set out as an evangelistamong the Swedes of Minnesota. He then spentK532Thomas, John several years in Utah before returning to Nebraskain 1880. The next year, he was ordained by theEvangelical Free Church. He then worked inEurope for the rest of the decade. Responding tothe call of Hudson TAYLORfor people to go toCHINA, Franson developed a plan to form mis-sionary sending agencies in different Europeancountries. By 1890, he had founded six such agen-cies, including the Danish Mission Confederation,the Swiss Alliance Mission, the Finnish AllianceMission, and the Swedish Alliance Mission, whichcontinue to the present.Back in the United States in 1890, Fransonheld an initial Bible and missionary course forindividuals who were desirous of missionary serv-ice. This course occasioned the formation of theScandinavian Alliance Mission. Hundreds of mis-sionaries were sent out to ASIA, Africa, and SOUTHAMERICA. Impressed by the work of Hudson Taylorand George MÜLLER, Franson built the alliance onsimilar principles of faith in God’s support for thework.Franson died in 1908, but the work he startedhas continued, and as the new century began,TEAM supported more than 800 active missionar-ies scattered in some 22 different countries.Further reading:Vernon Mortenson, God Made ItGrow: The History of T.E.A.M.(Pasadena, Calif.:William Carey Library, 1994); Edvard P.

Her brother, James Thoburn,went to INDIAas a missionary in 1859 and oncethere began to encourage his sister to join him.Isabella began her adult life as a schoolteacher.She responded favorably to the idea of going toIndia, but waited until she could receive theapproval of the church. She was in correspon-dence with the women who founded theMethodist Woman’s Foreign Missionary Societyand was at the top of the list when they began tocommission missionaries for service abroad.Thoburn and Clara SWAIN, the first two missionar-ies authorized by the society, arrived in Bombay(now Mumbai) in 1870.Thoburn went immediately to her post in Luc-know. Three months after her arrival, she opened agirl’s school in the Lucknow bazaar. The followingyear, the society purchased a seven-acre estate, for-merly a palace, for her use. She turned the palaceinto a boarding school. Thoburn worked in Luc-know for more than three decades, concentratingmuch of her educational and evangelizing effortsamong the women of the zenanas (harems).On visits home, Thoburn traveled across thecountry, speaking on behalf of the Indian mission.She also served for a year (1887–88) at the DEA-CONESShouse and taught in the Chicago TrainingSchool, both organized by Lucy Rider Meyer(1849–1922), who pioneered deaconess activityin Methodism.Upon her return to India, she discovered thather boarding school had evolved into a Girls’ HighSchool (1887). At her suggestion, it soon added acollege department, and later a teachers’ courseand a kindergarten (1893). Thoburn picked upher duties as principal and also began a semi-monthly Hindi-language newspaper, Rafiq-i-Niswan Woman’s Friend(). Meanwhile, her brother,James, had been named India’s first Methodistbishop in 1888.In 1895, the Indian government grantedThoburn a charter for a full woman’s college. Luc-know Woman’s College opened in 1896 as the firstChristian institution of higher education forwomen in ASIA. She headed the college and herefforts thereafter were largely devoted to its devel-opment and support. Thoburn died in Lucknow onSeptember 1, 1901. The college she founded wasrenamed in her honor in 1903. It would laterbecame the woman’s college of Lucknow University.Ting, K. H.533J Further reading:Marjorie A.

Converted byMethodist preaching, he felt a call to the missionfield after reading about Henry MARTYN. Thomastraveled to Tonga (then called the FriendlyIslands) in 1826, arriving as part of a companythat included himself, a Tasmanian, a British asso-ciate, James Hutchinson, and their wives. Heremained in Tonga for 25 years.Thomas learned the language quickly, madefriends with the chief and leaders of the people,and engaged in evangelism. His work had an ini-tial success in 1831, when Chief Taufa’ahau, whoruled one of the northern Tongan islands, and hiswife accepted BAPTISM. Later, Taufa’ahau, who tookthe name Siaosi or George at his baptism, unitedthe Tongan Islands under his leadership through aseries of wars. Thomas participated in hisenthronement in 1845 as the first king of allTonga. He also supported the king’s policy ofsending Tongan missionaries to Fiji and Samoa.Thomas remained in Tonga until 1850. Hethen returned to England for four years beforegoing back to Tonga when the mission was trans-ferred to the Australian Methodists. He remainedin Tonga another six years and then retired toEngland.See alsoSOUTHPACIFIC.Further reading:Shalamit Decktor Korn, “After theMissionaries Came: Denominational Diversity in theTonga Islands,” in J.

NEVIUS. For more than 30 years, Vennserved as the honorary secretary of the CHURCHMISSIONARYSOCIETY(1841–72). Venn believedmissionaries should aim to set up local churchesthat would be “self-governing, self-supporting,and self-extending.” As an Anglican, he opposedsetting up missionary dioceses, or naming bish-ops, before a local following had developed. Heargued that foreign missionaries should quicklyturn over control to local leadership.Operating as an executive for the AMERICANBOARD OFCOMMISSIONERS FORFOREIGNMISSIONSinBoston, Rufus Anderson arrived at essentially thesame ideas as Venn. He argued for a focused andpurposeful missionary program whose only goalwas the creation of a scriptural, self-propagatingChristianity. Missionaries were to seek the conver-sion of the lost, organize them into churches, traina competent local ministry, and lead the congrega-tions to a stage where they became self-propagat-ing. Any other activities were superfluous andeven distracting. By the end of the 1860s, he wasclearly articulating the three-self principles.John Nevius was a Presbyterian missionarywho further developed the three-self idea whileworking in CHINAand KOREA. The key to makingthe three-self principles work, he believed, wasteaching converts to become a witness for Christamong their neighbors and coworkers. The build-ing of local leaders meant that churches would notbe dependent on foreign funds for their survivaland growth.K534total depravity Churches were often reluctant to give control oftheir missions to local leaders. But with the decolo-nization and other changes brought by World WarII, the idea became unavoidable. During the war,many churches had been forced into self-suffi-ciency; most of them demonstrated their readinessfor self-governance. After the war, the end to colo-nization was frequently accompanied by the trans-formation of missions into autonomous churches.As a philosophy, the three-self principles sur-vived most visibly in China. The Communist gov-ernment expelled all foreign missionaries in 1950,and in 1954 forced the Protestant churches tomerge into a single body, the Three-self PatrioticMovement of Protestant Churches in China.Ostensibly formed to break church reliance onforeign money, influence, and leadership, themovement was actually designed to train leadersin patriotism (support for the government) and tofacilitate communication between the governmentand the Christian community. In 1966, as the Cul-tural Revolution began and the governmentattempted to destroy Christianity, the Three-selfMovement was disbanded. It was reorganized in1980. Its main role is to articulate new govern-ment policies regarding religion. On a more posi-tive note, it has helped foster the sense that thecontemporary Chinese Protestant church is anindigenous body and no longer a branch of a for-eign institution.Further reading:Gerald H.

Ting was born in Shanghai in 1915, the sonof a banker and grandson of an Anglican priest.He attended St. John’s University in Shanghai andreceived a B.D. (1942) and M.A. (1948) at UnionTheological Seminary in New York City. He wasordained a priest in 1942. He pastored the Inter-national Church in Shanghai during the Japaneseoccupation. Returning to the West after the war,he was for a period the student secretary of theStudent Christian Movement in Canada andworked for the WORLDSTUDENTCHRISTIANFEDER-ATIONin Geneva.Ting returned to CHINAin 1951, shortly afterWestern missionaries had been expelled. Thepostrevolutionary government in China movedswiftly to consolidate the various ProtestantDENOMINATIONSinto a single body that was struc-tured through several organizations, including thethree-self patriotic movement. Ting was elected toits first national committee in 1954. In 1962, hewas named president of the Nanjing Union Theo-logical Seminary, previously sponsored by a vari-ety of denominations.During the Cultural Revolution, when all pub-lic religious practice was banned, Ting and hiswife, Kuy Siu-may, were kept under close observa-tion in modest quarters where they had been relo-cated. He and several other faculty members werefor a time engaged by the government in translat-ing documents, and he worked on a new English-Chinese dictionary.In the late 1970s, as the Cultural Revolutiondied out and religious activity was once again tol-erated, Ting emerged into prominence. Heattended the Third Assembly of the World Con-ference on Religion and Peace, held at Princeton,New Jersey, in 1979. In 1981, he resumed leader-ship of the reopened Nanjing Theological Semi-nary. He was elected president of both the revivedthree-self movement and the China ChristianCouncil. He led in the creation of the Chinese The-ological Reviewin 1985, and that same yearbecame president of the Amity Foundation, a newChristian organization created to embody a vari-ety of good works, from education, to social andTrans World Radio535J health services, to rural development acrossChina.In 1995, Ting retired as leader of the ChinaChristian Council and the three-self movement.In 2000, the Amity Foundation presented TingAmity’s 25-millionth copy of the Bible.Further reading:Alan Hunter and Kim-Kwon Chan.Protestantism in Contemporary China(Cambridge:Cambridge University Press, 1993); K.

All Christians believe thathumans are fallen, but they disagree over thenature and extent of the state. Within the Calvin-ist tradition, the prevailing view is that humanityhas been so corrupted that individuals cannot ofthemselves make any decision or do any act thatwould lead them to believe the Gospel and mani-fest faith in Christ. God has chosen to save someindividuals and offers his grace to them. Thatgrace, being irresistible, leads to faith andresponse in those who receive it.From the viewpoint of total depravity, theimage of God, in which humans were created (Gen-esis 1:26), has almost completely disappeared andneeds total regeneration. Other Christian view-points maintain that the image of God still remainsto some degree; while humans need God’s assis-tance to believe, that assistance is available to all.The doctrine of total depravity enabledCALVINISMto maintain its Reformation faith thatsalvation was the work of God, not of humanity.Not even faith itself, or any human response to themessage of salvation, could be seen as a humancontribution to God’s saving work.Total depravity is part of a complex of doc-trines affirmed by Calvinists, including uncondi-tional election, LIMITED ATONEMENT, irresistiblegrace, and the perseverance of the saints, that arecollectively known as the five points of Calvinism.Further reading:A. W. Pink, Gleanings from theScriptures, Man’s Total Depravity(Chicago: MoodyBible Institute, 1969); David N. Steele and Curtis C.Thomas, The Five Points of Calvinism: Defined,Defended, Documented(Phillipsburg, N.J.: Presbyter-ian & Reformed Press, 1963).transubstantiationTransubstantiation refers to the change in the ele-ments of bread and wine into the body and bloodof Christ during the Eucharist, according toRoman Catholic belief.Christian doctrine has presented variousexplanations of Christ’s presence in the sacra-ments, especially in the Eucharist, which mostProtestants term the LORD S’ SUPPER. In the cen-turies immediately preceding the Reformation,the concept of transubstantiation was introduced,and by the 16th century it had become the domi-nant theory within the Roman Catholic Church.In Catholic doctrine, when the words of insti-tution (consecration) are spoken, the substance ofthe bread and wine are changed into the substanceof Jesus Christ, such that the LITURGYof the Massreenacts the actual crucifixion of Christ. The ideais most easily explained in terms of Aristotle’s phi-losophy. In looking at any object, according toAristotle, one could distinguish between its sub-stance and its accidents. That is, if one looked at achair, the substance was what made it a chair.Chairs, however could have many attributes (acci-dents)—color, texture, size, number of legs, gen-eral appearance. In like measure, bread may havemany accidents—color, taste, texture—all ofwhich can be distinguished from its substance, itsbreadness. During the Mass, Catholics believe thatK536True Jesus Church when the words of institution are spoken, thoughthe accidents remain unchanged, the substance ofbread becomes the substance of the body ofChrist. The priest’s authority to officiate at theMass when such change occurs derives ultimatelyfrom Christ; it was conveyed through the apostlesto the successive bishops of Rome (the popes),and through them to the bishops of the RomanCatholic Church.Protestants rejected transubstantiation as wellas the idea that the Mass was a new sacrifice ofChrist, but they disagreed as to what actually didhappen during the Lord’s Supper, Martin LUTHERsuggested the idea of CONSUBSTANTIATION, by whichhe was able to keep the idea of a real presence, buthoped to remove the magical element implied ifthe priest caused the change by pronouncing thewords of institution. Protestants in the tradition ofUlrich ZWINGLItended to suggest that the Lord’sSupper was simply a memorial meal. John CALVINattempted to mediate the two positions by sug-gesting that Christ was present spiritually in theelements and perceived by faith.In England in the 16th century, Protestantsclaimed to notice a similarity between a commonphrase used by jugglers and conjurers, “hocuspocus,” and the words of institution in the LatinMass, “Hoc est corpus” (this is my body). In the1690s, Archbishop of Canterbury John Tillotson(1630–94) tied the two phrases together as part ofan anti-Catholic polemic, the implication beingthat the Mass was so much nonsense.Further reading:Adolf Adam, The Eucharistic Cele-bration: The Source and Summit of Faith(Collegeville:The Liturgical Press, 1994); Louis Bouyer, Eucharist:Theology and Spirituality of the Eucharistic Prayer,trans. by C.

National Committee of theLutheran World Federation and the Bishops’ Commit-tee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs, 1970).Trans World RadioTrans World Radio broadcasts Christian programsto most of the world, through a series of powerful,strategically placed transmitters. It grew out of theconcern of Paul Freed (1918–96), a worker forYouth for Christ, about the situation of Protes-tants in Spain in the 1950s. Having documentedpersecution from Catholic authorities under theregime of Francisco Franco (1892–1975), heraised funds to start a radio station in Tangiers,Morocco, to broadcast into Spain. It opened in1954 as the Voice of Tangiers, and quicklyexpanded to other countries far beyond Spain. Bythe end of the decade it was reaching ROMANIA,HUNGARY, and even the Soviet Union.In 1959, Tangiers came under the control ofthe Muslim-led Moroccan government, whichclosed down the station. The station moved itsoperation to Monaco and changed its name toTrans World Radio. As the station grew, the num-ber of languages in which programming wasoffered steadily increased. It was eventually heardacross Europe, North Africa, and the MIDDLEEAST.A network of studios emerged in different coun-tries to produce shows that were taped and flownto Monaco for broadcast.In the 1970s, Trans World opened a facility onthe island of Bonaire, off the Venezuelan coast, tobroadcast programming to SOUTHAMERICAand theCARIBBEAN, and in 1978 began broadcasting to theIndian subcontinent from SRILANKA. An addi-tional facility was opened on Guam to reach intoCHINA.As the 21st century began, the facilities builtaround Trans World’s 13 primary transmittingsites and satellite hook-ups reach about 80 per-cent of the world’s population. The station broad-casts more than 1,800 hours of Christianprogramming a week to more than 160 countriesin some 180 languages.See alsoRELIGIOUS BROADCASTING.Further reading:Ben Armstrong, The ElectronicChurch(Nashville, Tenn.: Thomas Nelson, 1979);Norah Freed, Cupped Hands: on Trans World RadioTurkmenistan537J From Monte Carlo(London: Trans World Radio,1981); Paul E.

SABBATARIANISMhad been introduced intoChina in 1847 by missionaries of the Seventh-dayBaptists Church (who centered their work onShanghai) and was given further impetus by Sev-enth-day Adventists arriving in 1888. PENTE-COSTALISMwas introduced in 1907, when Alfred A.Garr and his wife, Lillian Garr, arrived in HongKong and began preaching among Congregation-alists. The movement quickly became indigenous,and within a few years Mok Lai Chi became itseffective leader. A few years later the first Pente-costals reached Shanghai.Among the first people to find their way to theShanghai Apostolic Faith Church was Lin-ShenChang (d. 1935), a Presbyterian DEACON, whobegan a quest for the BAPTISM OF THEHOLYSPIRIT.This did not occur during his initial period ofstudy with the congregation, but later in the yearat home. At the same time he began to speak intongues, he received a revelation about observingthe Sabbath.Several years later, Paul Wei (d. 1919), associ-ated with the LONDONMISSIONARYSOCIETY(Con-gregationalist) in Beijing, became seriously ill; heregained his health through the prayer and LAYINGON OF HANDSat the local Pentecostal fellowship.Subsequently, while praying at his home, he, too,received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and spokein tongues. The experience led him to found ahouse church. During a subsequent time of fast-ing, Wei received an additional revelation aboutwater baptism, that it should be in the name ofJesus Christ alone, “head bowed in the livingwater.” At this time, one segment of the largerPentecostal movement had also come to believe inbaptism by the name of Jesus alone, the JESUSONLYPENTECOSTALS. The Pentecostal Assembliesof the World (PAW) had accepted this idea, whichmeant abandoning traditional teachings about theTrinity. PAW had begun sending missionaries toChina in 1914.Wei began preaching services under the nameInternational Reformed Jesus True Church. In1917, the name was shortened to True JesusChurch. The next year, Lin-Shen Chang made hisway to the True Jesus Church, where he met PaulWei and convinced him that the church shouldobserve the seventh-day Sabbath. Today, Wei,Chang and another early worker, Barnabas Chang,are seen as the founders of the True Jesus Church.Paul Wei died in 1919, and Lin-Shin Chang laterdefected from the movement, leaving BarnabusChang as leader.As the church developed, other unique ele-ments were added to its Sabbatarian “Jesus Only”perspective. It accepted the two ordinances of BAP-TISMand the LORD S UPPER’ S, but also the third ordi-nance of FOOT WASHING. It taught that baptism,done in response to God’s command, cleanses thebeliever of sin, a position known as baptismalregeneration. The regenerating power of baptismwas confirmed in the accounts of healing miraclesthat occurred to people as they were baptized. Theproper mode of baptism is full immersion whilethe believer’s head is bowed. Only those who havebeen baptized can receive the Lord’s Supper, orHoly Communion.Within the True Jesus Church, speaking intongues usually occurs as a group act, with allengaging in prayer at the same time. Those speak-ing in tongues often vibrate or move under theinfluence of the Spirit, though in an orderly man-ner. The primary function of tongues is self-edifi-cation, hence there is no need to limit the numberwho speak.The True Jesus Church spread quickly inChina, and reached Hong Kong, Taiwan (thenunder Japanese control), SINGAPORE, and Malaysiabefore the end of the 1920s. In the 1930s, mis-sionaries began work in JAPAN,KOREA,INDONESIA,and even Hawaii.K538Tutu, Desmond Like all Chinese churches, the True JesusChurch was disrupted by the changes in govern-ment following the revolution of 1949. WithinChina, the church was merged into the Church ofChrist of China, though keeping a somewhat dis-tinctive presence as its members gathered on Sat-urday rather than on Sunday. Then the entirechurch was suppressed in 1966 during the Cul-tural Revolution. In 1967, church leaders from theother countries met in Taiwan for the first WorldDelegates Conference, which accepted the task ofcoordinating the movement outside of China. Aninternational headquarters was established inTaichung, Taiwan, where a seminary was opened.The headquarters was subsequently moved to Cal-ifornia in 1985, and four regional evangelical cen-ters were established to coordinate the work indifferent parts of the world—America, Europe,northeastern Asia, and Southeast Asia.As the 21st century began, the True JesusChurch reported a membership of 1.5 million in29 countries.

While seriously ill, Tsizehenahad a deathbed vision of Christ followed swiftlyby his recovery. The event solidified his commit-ment to the growing Anglican community.At a later date, Tsizehena moved to the north-ern region of Madagascar, which was not con-nected to the Anglican community at the time. Hebegan evangelizing in the region, without any for-mal commissioning. As he gathered converts intoa congregation at Namakia, he instituted Anglicanliturgical formats following the order of the BOOKOFCOMMONPRAYER. As the work grew, he identi-fied himself as the Rt. Rev. Lord Bishop of theNorth and made some clerical and even episcopalclothing to identify his role in the community. Healso recruited other evangelists to expand thework, and as the “bishop” took it upon himself tobaptize believers and ordain ministers. For serv-ices not included in the prayer book, he composedhis own liturgies.Shortly after the turn of the century, Tsizehenabegan negotiations with Anglican officials con-cerning the integration of his “diocese” into thelarger Anglican community in Madagascar. Thosenegotiations were successfully consummated, andTsizehena’s church now forms one of the threedioceses on the island, all of which belong to theChurch of the Province of the Indian Ocean.See alsoAFRICA SUB, -SAHARAN.Further reading:B.

In 1996, itpassed a law requiring religious communities tohave 500 members before they could apply forregistration, but officials have been reluctant toallow Protestant groups of whatever size to regis-ter. Protestants have been subject to discrimina-tion and even persecution. Their meeting houseshave been vandalized, and a few, such as theAdventist church in Asigabad, destroyed.

He was educated at Preto-ria Bantu Normal College and the University ofSouth Africa and became a high school teacher.However, he pursued studies in theology and wasordained to the priesthood in 1960.Tutu continued his education in England(1962–66), receiving divinity and theologydegrees from Kings College, CAMBRIDGEUNIVER-SITY. Returning to his homeland, he taught theol-541UAFJ: ogy at the Federal Theological Seminary in Aliceand at the University of Botswana, Lesotho andSwaziland. On a second visit to England, heserved for three years as the associate director ofthe Theological Education Fund of the WORLDCOUNCIL OFCHURCHES.Starting in the 1970s, he began to break downmany of the barriers keeping black people out ofchurch leadership in SOUTHAFRICA. In 1975, hewas the first black appointed dean of St. Mary’sCathedral in Johannesburg. The next year, he waselected as a bishop and served two years as headof the diocese of Lesotho. In 1978, he became thefirst black general secretary of the South AfricanCouncil of Churches (SACC).Tutu turned the SACC into his forum and usedhis position there (1978–85) to speak out againstapartheid and assist the victims of the South Africansystem. Though many of the all-white churcheswithdrew, SACC became a singularly importantvoice of South African Christianity. Attempting tosilence him, the South African government deniedhim the right to travel internationally, but relentedin the face of international criticism. In 1984, Arch-bishop Tutu was given the Nobel Peace Prize inrecognition of his fight against racism.Following the disintegration of the apartheidsystem, Tutu was showered with a series of hon-ors. In 1985, he was elected bishop of Johannes-burg and the following year became archbishop ofCape Town. In 1987, he became president of theAll African Conference of Churches and a fellowof Kings College.Through the 1990s, Tutu was a principal voiceof reconciliation during the process of govern-ment changes that brought President Nelson Man-dela to office in South Africa. In December 1995,Mandela appointed Tutu to chair the Truth andReconciliation Commission in South Africa.Tutu retired from the office of archbishop ofCape Town in 1996. He remains a voice calling forcooperation between the various segments ofSouth African society and for an end to the vio-lence and corruption that continues to haunt thecountry in the post-apartheid era.Further reading:Shirley du Boulay, Tutu, Voice of theVoiceless(London: Penguin Books, 1989); DicksonMungazi, In the Footsteps of the Masters: Desmond M.Tutu and Abel T.

He won a B.A.in 1512 from Magdalen Hall (now part of HertfordCollege) at Oxford University and his M.A. threeyears later. He appears to have been ordained aRoman Catholic priest around 1521. Fluent inseveral languages including Greek and Latin, Tyn-dale was also quite conversant with the Bible. Asthe Reformation on the Continent proceeded, hefollowed it closely and came to agree with itsmajor ideas.Tyndale decided to translate the BIBLEintoEnglish and make it available to everyone. To thatend, he left England for Germany and in Hamburgspent time with some prominent Jews, masteringHebrew. His English New Testament was pub-lished in 1525–26, much to the ire of King HENRYVIII, at the time still a staunch Catholic in beliefand practice. Copies of Tyndale’s New Testamentwere smuggled into England, his work being thefirst English Bible translated from the originalGreek.K542unconditional election Tyndale went into hiding, but continued histranslation work, the next goal being the Penta-teuch. From 1527 through the mid-1530s, he wasassisted by another British exile, Miles COVERDALE.The Pentateuch appeared in 1530, followed by thebook of Jonah the following year. Also appearingin 1530 was The Practice of Prelates,a volume thatcriticized Henry VIII’s divorce. Henry asked theHoly Roman Emperor to have Tyndale arrestedand sent back to England.In 1534, as Henry separated from the CatholicChurch, Tyndale came out of hiding and settled inAntwerp, Belgium. He continued his translatingand also began to preach in what was still largelyCatholic territory. Eventually, his location was dis-covered by a British spy, and he was arrested andconfined in a castle near Brussels. Tried forheresy/treason (the two charges being at timesindistinguishable), he was condemned and onOctober 6, 1536, executed by strangulation beforehis body was burned at the stake. Coverdale car-ried on a Tyndale’s work and brought out a com-plete English Bible in 1538.See alsoBIBLE TRANSLATION.Further reading:David Daniell, William Tyndale: ABiography(New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press,1994); A.

While studying at the Sapporo AgriculturalSchool, he became a Christian and was baptized in1878 by Methodist missionary Merriman ColbertHarris (1846–1921). Following his graduation in1881, he took a government job. As a Christianlayman, he helped found the Sapporo Indepen-dent Church and the Sapporo Y.M.C.A. (seeYOUNGMEN S’ CHRISTIANASSOCIATION).In 1884, Uchimura went to the United States.He had an intense religious experience whilestudying at Amherst College and entered HartfordSeminary, where he studied for a year. Upon hisreturn to JAPAN, he taught school for several years.He became well known in the 1890s for his Japan-ese books, such as Comfort for the ChristianBelieverand Spirit of Mission Work,and articles,especially “Why I Became a Christian” (latertranslated into English).In 1897, he moved to Tokyo. Uchimura heldto a conservative Evangelical faith, but remainedintensely independent. He advocated his ownbrandofChristianitycalledMukyokai(nonchurch movement), and for many years led aweekly Bible study class in his home. With twocolleagues, Nakata Juji and Kimura Seimatsu, hefounded the Second Coming of Christ movementin 1919. In 1922, he founded World MissionaryCooperation, which sent evangelists to CHINA,Taiwan, and the South Sea islands.In 1926, he started an English-language peri-odical, The Japan Christian Intelligencer,whichwidened his already broad influence in religiouscircles in Japan. Two years after his death onMarch 28, 1930, a set of his collected works beganto appear. His epitaph is often quoted, “I forJapan; Japan for the World; The World for Christ;And All for God.”Further reading:Hiroshi Miara, The Life and Thoughtof Kanzo Uchimura(Grand Rapids, Mich.: William B.Eerdmans, 1997); Kanzo Uchimura, The CompleteWorks of Kanzo Uchimura, vol. 7, Essays and Editori-als(Tokyo: Kyobunkwan, 1973), text in Japaneseand English; ———, The Diary of a Japanese Convert(New York: Fleming H.

On his famous tripto locate Livingstone, reporter Henry STANLEYtook note of the slow movement of Islam south-ward from the Sudan into Uganda, and upon hisreturn to the West he alerted the Protestant lead-ership of that fact. The Anglican CHURCHMISSION-ARYSOCIETY(CMS) responded quickly and hadmissionaries on the ground by 1877. They foundthe way already prepared for them by DallingtonMaftaa, an African commissioned as a missionaryby Livingstone.Alexander M. Mackay (1849–90) led the CMSteam; within two years, all his colleagues perishedfrom the climate. Mackay established close rela-tions with King Mutesa of Buganda, who wantedBritish help to stop the encroachments from thenorth. But after Mutesa died, his successor,Mwanga, came to resent Christian opposition tosome of his rulings, and he had at least 250 Angli-cans and Catholics killed. A Muslim coup inBuganda in 1888 forced MacKay from the country.About that time, the European powers allot-ted Uganda to British control as a protectorate.British authority was established on the groundin 1893. In the succeeding years, Anglicans viedwith Catholics for religious influence in Uganda.By the end of the 20th century, each communitynumbered between 7 and 8 million members,accounting for about two-thirds of the country’sresidents. Both faiths saw schismatic groupsemerge. Former Anglicans founded the Societyof the One Almighty God (1914) and the ChosenEvangelical Revival (1967). Catholics lost mem-bers to the Maria Legio of Uganda in the 1960sand to the Movement for the Restoration of theTen Commandments in the 1990s. The lattergroup came to a violent end in a tragic massmurder in 2001, the exact circumstances ofwhich remain unknown.A wide variety of groups appeared in Ugandathroughout the 20th century. The SEVENTH DAY-ADVENTISTCHURCHbegan work in 1926, and theSALVATIONARMYin 1931. PENTECOSTALISMcame in1935 through the efforts of the PentecostalAssemblies of Canada; the several Pentecostalchurches count a total of several million adher-ents. AFRICANINITIATEDCHURCHESfrom KENYA,such as the AFRICAN SRAELICHURCH,NINEVEH, havealso become an important element in Uganda’sreligious life.The Anglicans have formed a Joint ChristianCouncil that includes Catholics and Orthodox. Itis affiliated with the WORLDCOUNCILOFCHURCHES.Uganda became independent of Britain in1963. In 1971, a military officer, Idi Amin (c.1925–2003), instituted a brutal dictatorship thatnegatively affected all religions for the remainderof the decade. In 1973, Amin accused some 28Christian DENOMINATIONSof subversive activityand banned them from the country. Some ofthem sought protection through the AnglicanChurch, and others went underground. Amin’sgovernment killed or exiled some 400,000 peo-ple. In 1977, the Anglican archbishop was mur-dered, it is believed by Amin personally. Thebloody purge of the preexisting Anglican leader-ship ended only with Amin’s overthrow in 1979,when the religious situation gradually returnedto normal.See alsoAFRICA SUB, -SAHARAN.Further reading:W.

TheSYNOD OFDORTproclaimed that “Election is theunchangeable purpose of God.”From its inception, Protestantism has beenidentified with the view that God’s saving grace isseparate from all human efforts to do good or tomerit salvation. It rests in part on Paul’s Epistle tothe Romans 8:29–30: “For whom he did fore-know, he also did predestinate to be conformed tothe image of his Son.” The formulation of the doc-trine of unconditional election and its four relatedCalvinist points was an attempt to preserve thatview as the new church grew.Those Christians who have opposed the doc-trine often charged that it denies human free willand hence human responsibility. If nothing we cando either wins or loses God’s favor, they say, thennothing that we do really matters. Many of thesecritics believe that God elected humanity in gen-eral; the duty of individuals is to act upon thatelection and make it effective in their life.The doctrine of unconditional election carrieswith it a set of corollary beliefs: (1) from amongfallen humanity, God has arbitrarily chosen tosave a fixed number; (2) election is made quiteapart from any merit associated with the individ-uals so chosen; (3) one so chosen cannot rejectUnited Church of Christ545JMissionaries of the American Board established a number of churches in Hawaii, including thisone, the Hau’ula Congregational Church, in rural Oahu.(Institute for the Study of American Reli-gion, Santa Barbara, California) that election. A minority of Calvinists add anothercorollary: God has decreed that those left uncho-sen have been selected for damnation. Those whosupported ARMINIANISMspecifically rejected thatview.Further reading:Loraine Boettner, The ReformedDoctrine of Predestination(Philadelphia: Presbyterian& Reformed Press, 1965); John Owen, The Works ofJohn Owen,16 vols. (London: The Banner of TruthTrust, 1963); David N. Steele and Curtis C. Thomas,The Five Points of Calvinism: Defined, Defended, Doc-umented(Phillipsburg, N.J.: Presbyterian &Reformed Press, 1963).UnitarianismThe word unitarianmeans one who believes in theoneness of God; historically it refers to those inthe Christian community who rejected the doc-trine of the Trinity (one God expressed in threepersons). Non-Trinitarian Protestant churchesemerged in the 16th century in ITALY,POLAND, andTRANSYLVANIA. One of the early Unitarians,Michael SERVETUS(1511–53), was martyred for hisopinions. The Unitarian SOCINIANSgrew strong fora period in Poland, but were eventually engulfedby the Counter-Reformation. Socinian publica-tions appear to have made their way to England,where they inspired English non-Trinitarian writ-ing and the founding of a few independent Uni-tarian congregations among the Puritans.Prior to the 19th century, those espousing anon-Trinitarian form of Christianity encounteredintense hostility. The Trinity and the divinity ofJesus Christ are foundational to Christianity. How-ever, in the 19th century, a new Unitarian move-ment emerged that found some important supportfrom intellectuals and a more tolerant public.This new impulse is generally attributed toWilliam Ellery Channing (1780–1842), a Congre-gationalist minister, though he was not the first todiscuss non-Trinitarian ideas. In 1805, for exam-ple, the appointment of Henry Ware to a positionat the Harvard Divinity School prompted somestrict Trinitarians to withdraw and found a newseminary at Andover. A decade later, concern overUnitarian departures from orthodoxy promptedRev. Jedediah Morse (1761–1826) to write a pam-phlet, “Are You of the Christian or the BostonReligion?” A more liberal minister issued a rejoin-der, “Are you a Christian or a Calvinist?”Following his graduation from Harvard in1798, Channing underwent a spiritual and theo-logical struggle that led him through skepticismabout Christianity to a reformulated theology thatdid not include the Trinity. He also questioned thedoctrines of total depravity and believers’ electionto salvation. In 1803, he became pastor of the Fed-eral Street Church (Congregational) in Boston,but he did not publicly announce his alignmentwith non-Trinitarian Congregationalists until1819, when he laid out his beliefs in the ordina-tion sermon for a young minister.The sermon elevated Channing to the infor-mal position of leader of the Unitarians. It pro-voked many Congregational churches across NewEngland to hold votes and split over the issue ofthe Trinity. In most cases, the minority party with-drew from the congregation and formed a separatechurch. In this manner, Unitarian Congregationalchurches appeared, first in New England and thenin other parts of the country. In 1825, a conven-tion of Unitarian congregations was held, whichfounded the American Unitarian Association.The association, especially in the 20th century,became home to increasingly radical approachesto religion. Attempts were made to formulate auniversal religion apart from specifically Christianbeliefs and practices. Some members acceptedintellectualized forms of other traditional reli-gions and eventually nontheistic religious per-spectives (most notably HUMANISM).In 1961, out of a recognition that Unitarian-ism and UNIVERSALISMhad evolved along similarpaths and reached largely the same conclusionsabout religion and the religious life, the AmericanUnitarian Association and the UniversalistChurches of America merged to form the Unitar-ian Universalist Association (UUA). The UUA hasK546United Church of Christ by now eliminated all evidence of its Protestantroots and no longer considers itself a specificallyChristian organization.Further reading:John Buehres, The UUA PocketGuide(Boston: Unitarian Universalist Association,1999); David B.

Tapp, Religion among the UnitarianUniversalists: Converts in the Stepfather’s House(NewYork/London: Seminar Press, 1973).United Church of CanadaThe United Church of Canada (UCC) continuesthe traditions of the Methodists, Presbyterians,and Congregationalists in Canada. It was formedin 1925 by the merger of the Methodist Church(Canada, Newfoundland, and Bermuda), the Con-gregational Union of Canada, the PresbyterianChurch in Canada, and the General Council ofUnion Churches of Western Canada. A minorityof the Presbyterians did not accept the merger andcontinued under the former name. The UCC wasan early expression of ecumenism; hopes of fur-ther consolidation toward a united Protestantchurch in Canada never materialized.The articles of faith included in the 1925 Basisof Union represented the consensus beliefs of themerging bodies. A new “Statement of Faith” wasapproved in 1940, and a brief “New Creed,”adaptable for liturgical use, was approved in 1968.In 2000, the General Council asked the Commit-tee on Theology and Faith to prepare a statementacknowledging both the theological diversity ofthe church and the pluralistic world in which itoperates. The church is solidly in the liberalProtestant camp, and accepts modern BIBLICALCRITICISM.The church is divided into regional confer-ences that meet annually, and district presbyteriesthat have oversight of congregations in their area.The structure features elements from the threeuniting churches, balancing the demands of CON-GREGATIONALISMand presbyterian POLITY. TheUCC continues to work with churches aroundthe world that derived from its historic missions,providing funds and personnel for a spectrum ofprojects.The UCC was the first denomination inCanada (and among the earliest in the world) toordain women (1936). In 1980, Lois Wilsonbecame the first woman moderator. It also led theway in liberalizing rules on the remarriage ofdivorced persons (early 1960s) and in 1988 beganordaining gay and lesbian persons.The UCC is the largest Protestant body inCanada, with some 660,000 confirmed members.St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, is a leadingcenter of Anglicanism.(Institute for the StudyUnited Kingdom547J In recent surveys, more than 3 million Canadiansidentify themselves as affiliated with it. Churchheadquarters are in Etobicoke, Ontario. The UCChelped organize the Canadian Council ofChurches (1944) and was a charter member of theWORLDCOUNCIL OFCHURCHESin 1948.

Voices and Visions: Sixty-fiveYears of the United Church of Canada(Toronto:United Church Publishing House, 1990).United Church of ChristThe United Church of Christ (UCC) is an Ameri-can denomination founded in 1957 by the mergerof the Congregational Christian Churches and theEvangelical and Reformed Church. It embracesperhaps the most diverse set of traditions of anyAmerican denomination, including New EnglandPuritan CONGREGATIONALISM, the frontier RESTORA-TIONmovement, German LUTHERANISM, and Ger-man Reform (CALVINISM).The UCC sees itself primarily as a continuationof the Puritan Congregationalism of early New En-gland. Their congregational POLITYwas developedin Massachusetts in intimate relationship with thelocal government, and the Congregationalistsremained the established church in Massachu-setts into the early 19th century. Nevertheless,due to their congregational polity (local auton-omy), the church became home to a broad spec-trum of theological opinions. Unitarianism grewwithin its ranks but eventually split off into itsown body. In the late 19th century, Congrega-tionalists took the lead as spokespersons for var-ious liberal causes from the SOCIALGOSPELto atheological accommodation to evolution. Thedenomination was eventually organized as theNational Council of the CongregationalistChurches.Early in the 19th century, the MassachusettsCongregationalists took a leading role in theglobal spread of Protestantism by founding theAMERICANBOARD OFCOMMISSIONERS FORFOREIGNMISSIONS. It survives today as the UCC Board ofGlobal Ministries, which maintains contact withthe many former mission churches founded by theAmerican Board.In the post–Revolutionary War era, theRestoration movement emerged in different partsof the country. It encompassed groups ofchurches that shared a congregational polity andan aversion to denominational labels. They calledthemselves simply Christian churches. Unlike theCongregationalists, they had no tradition of gov-ernment ties. In 1833, representatives from manyof these churches held a convention, which isgenerally considered the start of the ChristianChurch as a denomination. It was this churchthat in 1931 merged with the National Council ofthe Congregationalist Churches to become theGeneral Council of the Congregational ChristianChurches.The Evangelical Synod of North America wasan immigrant import of the church created byKing Ludwig of Prussia in 1817 by merging theLutheran and Reformed Churches in his realm.One resource the church drew upon to make theunion work was PIETISM, a form of Lutheranthought that emphasized personal devotion overstrict doctrinal proscriptions. Pietism in Prussiaalso produced a new burst of energy for Bible andmissionary societies.The same Pietist spirit had produced the BaselMissionary Society, which sent almost 300 minis-ters to German-American communities in theMidwest beginning in the 1830s. In 1840, a groupof these ministers met in St. Louis and formed theGerman Evangelical Church Society of the West,K548United Kingdom which over the next decades evolved into theEvangelical Synod of North America.The Reformed Church in the United Statestraced its history to colonial Pennsylvania. Whilemost of the people who accepted William PENN’sinvitation to settle there belonged to Free Churchgroups, thousands of people identified with theGerman-speaking Reformed Church also arrived.In the 1730s, Michael Schlatter (1716–90) roamedthrough Pennsylvania at the behest of the DutchReformed Church in New York to help the scat-tered German churches form a network. His workbore fruit in 1747 with the formation of theReformed Ministerium of the Congregations ofPennsylvania, which evolved into the ReformedChurch in the United States.In 1934, the Evangelical Church and theReformed Church united to create the Evangelicaland Reformed Church, which soon began negoti-ations to merge with the Congregational ChristianChurches. Despite opposition on the Congrega-tional side, the merger was completed in 1957.The United Church incorporates elements ofboth Congregationalism and Presbyterianism.The General Synod is the highest policy-makingbody. The church has affirmed its standing in theReformed theological tradition, though the 1959statement of faith is open to interpretation. Thechurch is one of the most socially liberal denom-inations and was the first American church toordain openly gay and lesbian ministers.The church is headquartered in Cleveland,Ohio. As the new century began, it reported 1.4million members. It is a member of the WORLDCOUNCIL OFCHURCHESand the WORLDALLIANCE OFREFORMEDCHURCHES. In 1995, its Board of WorldMinistries merged with the Division of OverseasMinistries of the Christian Church (Disciples ofChrist), to create a new Board of Global Ministriesserving congregations in both churches. Themerger was a sign of the communion between thetwo groups that had been growing for severaldecades.Further reading:David Dunn, et al., A History of theEvangelical and Reformed Church(Philadelphia:Christian Education Press, 1961); Louis H.

His divorce of the Catholic Catherineof Aragon brought a break with the pope and theRoman Church. The many English nobles andchurchmen leaning toward Protestantism, includ-ing Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas CRANMER,used the opportunity to push Henry and thenewly independent CHURCH OFENGLANDin theirdirection.It was under EDWARDVI (r. 1547–53) thatProtestantism took firm hold within the church.After a brief Catholic restoration under MARYI (r.1553–58). ELIZABETHI (1558–1603) gave to theBritish church its unique stance, the VIA MEDIAbetween Catholicism and CALVINISM. The Churchof England would have BISHOPS, a vernacularLITURGY(as found in the BOOK OFCOMMONPRAYER), and a distinctly Calvinist flavor in itsformal statement of faith. This compromise faithbecame known as ANGLICANISM, which wasimposed on Wales and Ireland as well.Events had developed differently in Scotland,where John KNOXled the Scottish church to adoptthe Reformed faith and POLITYhe had absorbed asan exile in Geneva. The Church of Scotlandbecame Presbyterian, and those who alignedthemselves with the Church of England remainedin the minority, eventually forming a ScottishEpiscopal Church.The church under Elizabeth and her successorsfaced continual pressure from PURITANISM, sup-United Methodist Church549J ported by Calvinists who sought to abolish theepiscopacy in favor of a Presbyterian polity (with afew advocating CONGREGATIONALISM). The Presbyte-rians came to power in the 1640s under OliverCROMWELLand the Commonwealth. Anglicanorder, belief, and practice were replaced with thesystem embodied in the WESTMINSTERCONFESSIONOFFAITHand the two Westminster catechisms.The shifts in British religious life, however,came to an end with the return of a king to ruleEngland in 1660 and the restoration of Anglican-ism, which subsequently remained the dominantfaith in England and Wales. Puritan dissent sur-vived in the Presbyterian, Congregational, andUnitarian Churches. Congregationalism wouldfind its strongest support in Wales.During the 1600s, another dissenting groupappeared, the BAPTISTS. They favored adult BAPTISMand rejected any attempt to tie the church to thestate. The most radical movement, however, wasthe QUAKERS, whose members insisted on follow-ing their Inner Light along with Bible teachings.Some dissenting groups, unable to make head-way in England, relocated to the new British set-tlements overseas, most notably the Congrega-tionalists in Massachusetts and the Quakers inPennsylvania. Simultaneously, the AnglicanChurch began an organized effort to provide serv-ices for its members outside of England, leading tothe formation of the first two international mis-sionary organizations at the end of the 17th cen-tury, the SOCIETY FOR THEPROPAGATION OF THEGOSPEL INFOREIGNPARTSand the SOCIETY FORPRO-MOTINGCHRISTIANKNOWLEDGE, both of which con-tinue to supply personnel and literature toAnglicans worldwide.Puritanism had sought to infuse a personalfaith in its followers; their leaders periodicallylaunched efforts to revive faith in what they saw asspiritually dead churches. Various efforts throughthe 17th century culminated in the careers of theWESLEYbrothers, John and Charles, and their sin-gular effort to revive the nation in the mid-1700sthrough the Methodist movement.METHODISMwas intimately connected with theMORAVIANCHURCH, and from it absorbed an inter-est in foreign missions. In the 1770s, Methodistpreachers were dispatched to the British Americancolonies, where after the American Revolution anindependent Methodist Church arose in the newUnited States. Thomas COKE, who John Wesleysent to America to set up the new church, pio-neered a vision of a world missionary movement.Coke presented his plan for a global mission to hisMethodist colleagues in 1784; its enactmentturned Methodism into a global presence.A few years after Coke, in 1792, WilliamCAREYhelped found the Baptist Missionary Soci-ety to send missionaries overseas. Eventually, a setof denominational missionary agencies arose,from the LONDONMISSIONARYSOCIETY(1796),Hollywood United Methodist Church, Holly-wood California(Institute for the Study ofK550United Methodist Church which worked among several Calvinist churches,to the CHURCHMISSIONARYSOCIETY(1799, Angli-can). In the middle of the 19th century, independ-ent faith missions, such as the CHINAINLANDMISSION, began to form. England became the mostimportant center for the global spread of Protes-tantism through the 19th century.In IRELAND, support for Catholicism becameidentified with the aspiration of the Irish to throwoff British rule. Catholicism was legalized in 1829,and the Church of Ireland (Anglican) was dises-tablished in 1869. Through the 1870s, mostchurch parishes reverted to Catholicism and theChurch of Ireland became a minority church.Even in Protestant Northern Ireland, Anglicansfell behind the Presbyterian Church, which hadgrown strong from Scottish migration into theregion.Throughout the 20th century, the Church ofEngland, its Anglican sister, the Church of Wales,and the Presbyterian Church of Scotland formed astructure that blanketed the United Kingdom witha Protestant Christian presence, though surveyshave shown a steady decay of support. The olddissenting churches that originated in the Puritanand Methodist movements also seemed to be loos-ing membership. At the same time, Englandbecame home to the wide spectrum of Protestantand Free Church organizations so identified withthe United States. Numerous small Christian com-munities—HOLINESS, Pentecostal, Adventist, andEvangelical—emerged. In addition, a variety ofgroups from former British colonies (especiallyJAMAICAand NIGERIA) also entered the country.Methodism was by no means the last of therevival/revitalization movements to emerge inGreat Britain. The Christian story was dotted withefforts such as the ALBURYCONFERENCES, theKESWICK MOVEMENT, the 1905 revival in Wales thatheralded the arrival of PENTECOSTALISM,and theCHARISMATIC MOVEMENTof the late 20th century.Each of the revivals produced new Protestantdenominations.In a countertrend, the older British churcheswere enthusiastic supporters of the ECUMENICALMOVEMENT. The various Methodist groups formedin the 19th century reunited in the METHODISTCHURCHin 1932; Presbyterian and Congregationalchurches merged in stages into the ReformedChurch of the United Kingdom; and most of theschismatic Scottish Presbyterians rejoined theChurch of Scotland. Besides these three churchesand the Church of England, no less than a half-dozen more UK-based churches are members ofthe WORLDCOUNCIL OFCHURCHES. Other unityefforts include the Churches Together in Britainand Ireland, Churches Together in England, andthe Afro-West Indian United Council ofChurches.Evangelicals are also active in England. TheEvangelical Alliance of the United Kingdomadheres to the European Evangelical Alliance (withwhich it shares headquarters in London) andthrough it to the WORLDEVANGELICALALLIANCE.As the new century began, the Church of England (and its sister Anglican churches)retained the allegiance of some 44 percent of thepublic in the United Kingdom. Roman Catholicsapproached 10 percent with the remainingProtestants making up about 12 percent. There isa significantly high nonreligious community(about 11 percent), though it is not as large asother European countries such as Denmark andthe Czech Republic. At the same time, theChurch of England and other older churchescarry a large number of nonpracticing Christianson their rolls.Further reading:D. W.
