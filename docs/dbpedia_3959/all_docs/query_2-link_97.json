        "text": "Introduction\n\nAbortion is a common experience for U.S. women of reproductive age—approximately 1 in 4 will have an abortion by age 45 [1]. In the United States, 13.5 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age were reported in 2017. While national and regional abortion rates have been declining, rates in the state of Georgia have increased in recent years [2]. The rate of abortion in Georgia was 16.9 abortions/1,000 women aged 15–44 in 2017 [2].\n\nDespite abortion being common, most people in Georgia face systemic and socio-cultural barriers limiting access to abortion services. Attitudes that condemn abortion emerge in policy, systems, and at the community-level [3]. Manifestations of abortion stigma [3–6] may influence people’s ability to exercise reproductive autonomy [7, 8]. Researchers suggest “abortion stigma confounds a woman’s decision to terminate a pregnancy due to worries about judgment, isolation, self-judgment, and community condemnation” [9]. In 2014, only 4% of counties had clinics that provided abortion, leaving 58% of women in Georgia without a clinic in their county. Restrictive state legislation threatens to impose additional barriers to abortion access. For example, in 2019, Georgia legislators introduced HB 481, a bill that sought to outlaw abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected [10]. This bill aimed to restrict abortion as early as 6 weeks gestation, before many people know they are pregnant [11]—one of the strictest abortion bans in the nation [12]. A federal judge granted an injunction in early October 2019, which blocked the law while it is argued in court [13].\n\nMore restrictive policies leave the most vulnerable, economically disadvantaged, and socially isolated people with few choices but to carry pregnancies they feel they are unable to support to term; however, those who carry pregnancies also face systemic barriers including limited access to perinatal care. Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the United States [14], yet access to obstetric services is limited by a declining obstetrician/gynecologist workforce, especially in rural areas [15]. Moreover, half of all counties in Georgia are without a single obstetrician/gynecologist or hospital where women can give birth or access basic services [16].\n\nReligious leaders are pivotal in their faith communities [17] and may be influential in shaping attitudes towards sexual and reproductive health (SRH), norms, and behaviors at the individual, family and community levels [8, 17, 18]; however, religious doctrine and beliefs may come in direct conflict with public health recommendations regarding abortion and contraception [19]. Previous research [4] has found links between religiosity and experiences of abortion stigma and it is “often the religious voices that oppose sexual and reproductive rights that have been the most visible in the media and most influential in policy debates” [17]. In a landmark 2014 case, Burwell v Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., the Supreme Court ruled that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993 allows a for-profit company to deny its employees coverage for contraception through the employer-based health plan because of the religious objections of the Hobby Lobby owners [20]. Conversely, Mainline Protestant religious leaders have historically played a role in shaping SRH policy, specifically with advocacy efforts for increased access to contraception and abortion during the twentieth century [17].\n\nWhile many religions are perceived to condemn abortion [21], religiously affiliated women do have abortions—the majority (62%) of women who obtained an abortion in 2008 and 2014 claimed a religious affiliation [22]. Of these women, 17% identified an affiliation with a Mainline Protestant denomination [22]. This percentage is higher than that found in the American population as a whole; in 2010, Mainline Protestants only represented 7.2% of the United States population [23].\n\nReligious leaders may play an important role in providing SRH-related pastoral care and resources given that “religions have a venerable tradition supporting healing, health care, disease prevention, and health promotion [and a] commitment to the most marginalized, the most vulnerable, and the most likely to be excluded” [17]. Still, little is known about the pastoral care practices of religious leaders as they relate to abortion, especially in the southern states of the United States and there are few resources in pastoral theology that address abortion. In fact, a review of publications from Mainline Protestant publishing houses over the last two decades identified only two books published on pastoral care and abortion [24, 25]. A keyword review of the American Theological Library Association (ATLA) database identified no peer-reviewed articles exploring abortion published in pastoral theology journals over the last twenty years. Given their potential reach and influence, there is a need to understand the religious and moral views that shape religious leaders’ attitudes toward abortion, and their pastoral care practices, particularly in Georgia, a state with high religious influence [26] and gaps in reproductive healthcare [15, 16, 27]. This study aims to explore Mainline and Black Protestant religious leaders’ attitudes towards abortion and how they provide pastoral care regarding abortion.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nParticipant recruitment\n\nParticipants were recruited from two religious traditions based on categorization developed by Steensland and colleagues [28]. Mainline Protestantism is a branch of Protestantism that consists of denominations that are generally considered theologically liberal and moderate (e.g. Presbyterian Church (USA), the United Methodist Church, Episcopal Church, and the United Church of Christ). Black Protestantism (also known as “the Black Church”) is theologically and structurally similar to white evangelical denominations, “but also emphasizes social justice and community activism” [29]. According to the Association of Religious Data Archives, Black Protestant denominations are generally economically liberal and socially conservative [29]. The tradition consists of seven major denominations, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Church of God in Christ, and the Progressive National Baptist Church [29].\n\nFor this study, 20 semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with religious leaders serving in Mainline and Black Protestant churches in a county with urban and rural areas outside of Atlanta, Georgia. The study site was selected due to its higher abortion rates, lower SRH service access, a higher religious adherence, greater denominational diversity, and an abundance of Mainline Protestant and Black Protestant churches as compared to other similar counties in Georgia. Religious leaders were eligible to participate if they were currently serving in a Mainline Protestant or Black Protestant church as a clergy member or lay leader (i.e. a non-ordained member of a Christian church [29]) for at least 6 months prior to the interview, were over 18 years old, and spoke English.\n\nPurposive sampling was used to recruit a sample of religious leaders diverse in denomination and sociodemographic characteristics. Churches were identified using a publicly available list of churches by county published by The Association of Religious Data Archives. Names and contact information for the primary religious leader of these churches were obtained from church websites and social media. Lay leaders were recruited by social media messages and snowball sampling because their contact information was often not publicly available on church websites. Religious leaders were contacted up to five times by email, phone, and social media message using standard Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved scripts. Leaders were also approached in person and recruited at centers of commerce (e.g. local strip malls) in the county using a standard recruitment script, screened for eligibility, and interviewed at a later date in a private location.\n\nParticipant characteristics\n\nSocio-demographic characteristics of study participants are presented in . The majority of participants recruited were men (80%) serving in senior pastoral roles (60%). Other religious titles reported included: pastor, associate pastor, first lady, minister, regional minister, youth minister, and lay leader. The average length of time served in the participant’s current role was 8.3 years (6 months to 40+ years). Age ranged from 28 to 72 years, with a mean age of 48. Sixty-five percent of participants had a graduate degree—most commonly a Masters of Divinity. Church membership size ranged from less than 50 to over 1000 people.\n\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristicsn (%)RaceWhite10 (50)Black10 (50)Age18–344 (20)35–506 (30)51–699 (45)70+1 (5)Marital StatusMarried14 (70)Divorced2 (10)Remarried1 (5)Single (Never Married)2 (10)Not reported1 (5)Political affiliationDemocrat13 (65)Independent4 (20)Republican3 (15)TraditionMainline Protestant11 (55)Black Protestant9 (45)DenominationUnited Methodist Church5 (25)Evangelical Lutheran Church in America1 (5)Black Protestant–Baptist Unspecified3 (15)Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)1 (5)Congregational Methodist Church1 (5)Episcopal Church1 (5)African Methodist Episcopal (AME)2 (10)International Pentecostal Holiness Church1 (5)National Baptist Convention USA2 (10)National Missionary Baptist Convention Inc.1 (5)Non-denominational1 (5)Presbyterian Church USA1 (5)\n\nData collection\n\nIn-depth interviews were conducted between October 2018 and September 2019 using a semi-structured interview guide (See S1 Appendix). The interview guide included questions on participants’ views about unplanned pregnancy and abortion, pastoral care on these topics, and suggestions for discussions and programming around unintended pregnancy and abortion in faith settings. Some of the questions included, “What are your personal views on abortion?” and “What advice would you give someone in your congregation considering abortion?” Researchers probed for barriers and facilitators to providing pastoral care on these topics and specific resources and scripture religious leaders would rely on during these conversations. The interview guide was pilot-tested in four interviews with clergy members serving in Mainline and Black Protestant churches in metro-Atlanta and then refined for clarity. Iterative changes were made to the interview guide and to participant recruitment throughout the data collection period to explore new topics raised and to include participants with differing perspectives, as is usual in qualitative data collection.\n\nParticipants were consented verbally. They were read an IRB-approved consent script, invited to ask follow-up questions, and asked if they agreed to take part in the study. A short demographic survey was administered after the informed consent process. Interviews were conducted in private offices at the participant’s church, at Emory University, or another location (e.g. a private room in a coffee shop) and digitally audio-recorded. Interviews lasted between 45 and 90 minutes, and participants received a $50 gift card. The study was approved by the IRB at Emory University (IRB 00106069).\n\nFive researchers collected the data. They were trained on qualitative research methods, the study protocol, and research ethics. All researchers were cisgender women of reproductive age: four multi-ethnic women and one white woman. They had varying religious backgrounds and level of experience within Christian churches. Throughout data collection, the researchers practiced reflexivity by journaling their own thoughts and impressions about the research topic or participant’s experiences. They also noted potential biases that may have influenced data collected. Researchers shared these reflexive notes in team debriefing sessions and discussed ways to minimize researcher influence on the data collection process. Debriefing sessions included discussions on how researcher’s social identities and preconceptions about the study issues may have influenced the data as well as strategies to minimize these influences. For example, reflexivity revealed emerging data on race and religion, whereby the team felt that matching the race of researchers and participants may provide a more enabling environment for a deeper, more nuanced data on participants views on race and abortion.\n\nData analysis\n\nThematic analysis was used to describe Mainline and Black Protestant religious leaders’ attitudes towards abortion and how they provide pastoral care regarding abortion. Interviews were transcribed verbatim by a professional transcription company and de-identified by the research team. Data were managed and organized using Dedoose version 8.0.35, a software package for qualitative data analysis [30]. Data collection, coding, and analysis occurred simultaneously to assess meaning saturation, or a “richly textured understanding” of abortion attitudes and pastoral care practices [31]. Saturation was reached at 20 interviews when a diversity of views and denominations was achieved and no new themes were observed.\n\nData were read in detail and memoed in order to develop a codebook (See S2 Appendix). Codes were developed through inductive (emerging from the data) and deductive (pre-determined topics from the interview guide) strategies. An inter-coder agreement exercise was conducted prior to coding all data to ensure consistency in the coding process. Weekly team meetings were held to refine code definitions, resolve discrepancies in coding, and discuss reflexivity in data interpretation during the coding process. For example, researchers discussed how our underlying epistemologies, public health training, and differing views on scripture and doctrine, might influence interpretation of data during analysis.\n\nResearchers explored data by codes (e.g., abortion, attitudes & beliefs, and pastoral care), conducted structured comparisons of codes by sub-groups of participants (e.g., by sociopolitical attitudes, denomination, and gender). Patterns in the data were examined and sub-themes within codes were identified. Illustrative quotes were then selected for each sub-theme.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study provides insight into the complex intersection of sociopolitical attitudes about abortion, religious and moral beliefs, and pastoral care among Mainline and Black Protestant religious leaders in Georgia. This analysis is part of a larger intervention development study to understand existing attitudes, norms, and values, in order to inform a faith-centered program on sexual and reproductive health that promotes compassionate attitudes and norms in Protestant religious contexts. While abortion attitudes fell on a spectrum ranging from “pro-life” to “pro-choice,” the majority of participants expressed attitudes intermediate, or in a “gray area,” between these views. Differences in abortion attitudes stemmed from varying beliefs on when life begins and circumstances in which abortion may be morally acceptable. Participants stressed that they would support women in pregnancy decision-making and advise them to make well-informed decisions irrespective of their own attitudes; yet, many described their lack of preparation and training to have these conversations.\n\nResults showed numerous similarities and differences among Protestant religious leaders’ attitudes, beliefs, and pastoral care practices. For example, all participants agreed that they would participate in providing pastoral care for abortion at the initiation of congregants’ advice seeking. Other key similarities in pastoral care across the spectrum of abortion attitudes include recognition of the importance of the sanctity of life, emphasis on using scripture to encourage (i.e., not using scripture in a punitive manner), and acknowledgment that spiritual leaders are called to love and care for people unconditionally. In addition, many participants across denominations highlighted the psychological effects of abortion and a need for spiritual healing after abortion. Still, participants differed in their descriptions of their belief about when life begins, acknowledgement of moral agency to make pregnancy- and abortion-related decisions, and the circumstances in which abortion may be morally acceptable. For example, participants with “pro-choice” attitudes and participants with abortion attitudes in the “gray area” emphasized a preference against abortion but recognized a pregnant person’s moral agency to make decisions for their bodies and lives, whereas participants with “pro-life” attitudes did not express the same recognition.\n\nThese results demonstrate that Protestant religious leaders may provide pastoral care differently according to their abortion attitudes, thus varying their advice and recommendations; however, several misperceptions regarding abortion underlie religious leaders’ attitudes, beliefs, and pastoral care practices and run counter to existing scientific evidence. For example, many pastors described the adverse psychological effects of having an abortion including spiritual questioning, guilt, and lifelong emotional struggle and pain. In contrast, thirty years of research—including studies that measured mental and emotional distress before pregnancy—suggest legal induced abortion does not pose significant mental health risks for women [32–34]; however, evidence suggests being denied an abortion may result in negative psychological effects on women [35]. In addition, some religious leaders with “pro-choice” and “gray area” attitudes stated they would advise against the use of abortion as contraception despite clinical guidelines clearly distinguishing between contraception as a form of primary pregnancy prevention while abortion is a form of pregnancy termination [36]. Further, despite religious leaders beliefs that women use abortion “conveniently” or as a primary pregnancy prevention method in the United States, people have abortions for diverse and interrelated reasons (e.g., 73% cited inability to afford a child and 74% cited having a baby would interfere with work, education, or ability to care for dependents) [37] and over half of U.S. abortion patients were using a contraceptive method when they became pregnant [38].\n\nParticipants who identified a “pro-life” attitude towards abortion cited informational support that encouraged women to continue their pregnancies and carefully consider the potential of the unborn child. Many of these participants expressed that their pastoral care would include instrumental support in the form of making referrals to Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs) and pro-life advocacy organizations. Those with a “pro-life” attitude explained that CPCs were reliable sources of information and would help women to get prenatal care. They explained that women could go to a CPC to see an ultrasound or hear a fetal heartbeat. Some participants with a “pro-life” attitude explained that they would advise women to seek services at a CPC before deciding to have an abortion. Protestant religious leaders may view CPCs as reliable healthcare services because of their emphasis on religious ideology; however, evidence suggests women seeking care at these clinics “do not receive comprehensive, accurate, evidence-based clinical information about all available options” [39].\n\nOnly participants with “gray area” or “pro-choice” attitudes expressed a duty to confront stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors towards women who experience abortion. These participants discussed obligations to encourage empathy and dispel stigmatizing attitudes and treatment within their congregations. While these participants were the only religious leaders who expressed these views, all participants emphasized the importance of empathy, love, and compassion for others. Thus, Protestant religious leaders may be key players in confronting abortion stigma in Mainline and Black Protestant churches and should be involved at the onset of efforts to destigmatize abortion and “shift the cultural conversation from one of judgment to one of empathy, compassion, and affirmation of people’s moral agency” [17]. These findings hold promise for informing the development of multi-level faith-based interventions and secular and faith-based partnerships to reduce abortion stigma.\n\nMany religious leaders cited that they had not had formal training on providing pastoral care for any sexual and reproductive issue, let alone abortion. Pastoral care training and interventions should be developed that emphasize Christian beliefs and value the sanctity of life and integrate public health recommendations. Key intervention components should: include information on evidence-based healthcare services and local supports, address beliefs about both the psychological and the spiritual effects of abortion, dispel misinformation, and integrate strategies to reduce abortion stigma. Some religious scholars are already considering faith-based, reproductive justice, and moral arguments for supporting abortion [19, 40–44]. Existing moral arguments for legal abortion and this qualitative evidence could be used to inform intervention development.\n\nThese findings should be interpreted in context of the limitations and strengths of the study. Our diverse sample of Mainline and Black Protestant churches represent an array of perspectives on abortion and pastoral care, but cannot (and were never intended to) be generalized to all religious denominations (e.g., Evangelical Protestant, Catholic, and non-Christian groups were purposefully excluded). Additionally, only few women were recruited in this study, which somewhat reflects the gender makeup of senior leadership positions in Protestant religious institutions which are male dominated. It is possible that women lay leaders are providing pastoral care to congregants as well and may have different insights on the provision of pastoral care for abortion. Future research should seek to specifically recruit Mainline and Black Protestant women religious leaders. Investigation of how these findings compare to abortion attitudes and pastoral care practices among other religious traditions in Georgia, the Southeast region, and other states is warranted. It is possible the participants included in this study represent a group with more liberal views on abortion given the fairly liberal stances of their denominations compared to other religious traditions. It is a strength of this study, however, that many diverse political and socio-political attitudes were observed among participants from the same denominations."
