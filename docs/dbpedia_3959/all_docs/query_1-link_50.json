WHAT IS PROTESTANT RELIGION? ▪Is a branch of Christianity that emerged from the protestant reformation in the 16th century. It encompasses various denomination each with its own beliefs and practices but generally emphasizes the authority of the Bible salvation through faith in Jesus Christ and the priesthood of all believers. Protestants typically reject certain teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic.\n\n3. HISTORY OF PROTESTANT RELIGION ❑ Protestant Religion began in the early 16th century in Europe ❑ It was a movement led by figure such as Martin Luther who is often credited with sparkling the movement by nailing his 95 Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg in 1517. Other influential figures include John Calvin, Ulrich Zwingli, and Thomas Cranmer among others .
