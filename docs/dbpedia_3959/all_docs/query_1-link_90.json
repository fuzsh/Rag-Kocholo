        "text": "While reading the book “God’s Jury: The Inquisition and the Making of the Modern World”, I found a sense that while the book had very interesting and questioning connections with a variety of passed inquisitions and where or how there are similarities to our modern time. Which is explained greatly by Murphy, functioning as a guide to the readers, offering a tour of the Inquisition’s nearly 700-year-old. I also found that Murphy did a great job in defining and explaining in detail the various gruesome instruments and acts of torture through history and showing similarities and same techniques used today. My the one problem I had was I found it an overall amusing to read, but personally until the first 3-4 chapters the book is quite difficult to digest and connect with, but as the inquisitions began to be more modern era I could relate and see the points and connections that were being made. I found that Murphy’s focus was to demonstrate how the mind-set and some machinery of the Inquisitions are unpreventable products of the modern world that later surfaced in Stalin’s Russia,\n\nIn The Spanish Inquisition, 1478-1614, Lu Ann Homza successfully compiled and published records of the trial of Marina Gonzalez. Through these records, Homza was able to illustrate the antagonism directed towards the Jewish Community during the Spanish Inquisition. In 15th century Spain, an accusation of practicing Judaism was taken very seriously and could lead to the punishment of death. In 1484, without any explicit evidence, Marina Gonzalez was accused of heresy and apostate based on allegations that she was a secret Jew. According to Homza, “Diego Martinez de Ortega… announced that he intended to place an accusation against Marina Gonzalez… for the crime of heresy and apostasy”\n\nAp World Religions Dbq Analysis\n\n1253 Words | 6 Pages\n\nCharles V launched military campaigns to weed out Lutheranism and employed the Spanish Inquisition to target members of other faiths.

The main cause for this was the arrival of Jesuit priests in Germany. Their mission was to convert the vast majority of Protestants to Catholicism. They faced strong opposition, and a revolt began in Bohemia in 1618 by the Protestant Nobility against the Holy Roman Empire. This marked the start of the Thirty Years’ War.\n\nIt would not be long before the Jesuits were sent to the New World to serve in New Spain and 60 years after the arrival in Mexico City, others from France settled in Quebec (Bangert, 261). One of the primary methods of evangelization in the New World was the process of isolation and indoctrination. Used by both the Jesuits of New Spain and New France, isolation and indoctrination had both its success and its failures.

Haliczer’s thesis’s, state their opinion as to why the Inquisition was instituted.\n\nReligious Reformation Dbq\n\n737 Words | 3 Pages\n\nIn the sixteenth century of Europe, religious reform and changes led people away from the Catholic Church. From Martin Luther’s exposition of the church’s corruption to King Henry VIII’s Act of Supremacy, these two religious figures broke away from the Catholic Church in favor of alternative religions.
