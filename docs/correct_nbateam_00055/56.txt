The Washington Wizards were undoubtedly one of the toughest teams in the NBA in the early 2000s. The Wizards were then led by three-time All-Star Gilbert Arenas as he tried to put his team on the map as one of the top contenders of the Eastern Conference. Arenas also had the luxury of having a young, spitfire point guard like Steve Blake.

Apparently, the two guards butted heads in the middle of one of their training sessions, which Arenas recalled on his No Chill Podcast:

“During practice, I elbowed Steve Blake and he swung at me. I was like, ‘Damn, wait hold on.’ Oh, really? Did the white boy just throw a punch at me? Is that how we’re working here, right?” Gilbert Arenas said, via Fadeaway World.

Blake has always been one to not back down from anyone, and Arenas certainly wasn't going to be an exception. The Florida native had a chip on his shoulder after an NCAA championship with Maryland and proved early on that he was all business.

Arenas continued to narrate that Blake was a true professional and that his no-BS mindset was left inside the lines:

“We’re going through it, like wrestling on the floor. Practiced ended. He’s like, ‘Hey, man, y’all want to go to Legal Seafood?’ “What are you talking to me like that for? Don’t be talking to me like that. He was like, ‘Let’s go to Legal Seafood, food on me; let’s go through these plays.’ No, it’s just off the court this is him. On the court, he’s a whole different person. Then, we go to Legal Food and talk about plays. We didn’t even talk about him throwing a punch at me and we over here fighting in the corner,” Arenas concluded.

Blake proved to be quite the teammate and competitor, which only goes to show how he was able to stay in the league for more than a decade.
