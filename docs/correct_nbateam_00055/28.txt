Steve Blake, a Miami Lakes native and NBA journeyman who played with arguably the best player in NBA history, Kobe Bryant, announced his retirement following a 17-year career that ended with a stint in Australia.

According to reports, Blake, 36, last played for the Sydney Kings of the NBL in the land down under in December.

In nine games for the Kings, he averaged 5.9 points, 2.3 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game.

The point guard played 16 years in the NBA after the Washington Wizards drafted him in the second round in 2003.

The former Maryland standout had three stints with the Portland Trailblazers, played for the Milwaukee Bucks, Denver Nuggets, L.A. Clippers, the Lakers, the Golden State Warriors and the Detroit Pistons.

Blake played alongside Bryant for three years as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers and ended his NBA career with the Pistons in 2016.

On October 22, 2016, Blake signed with the Sydney Kings for the 2016-17 NBL season, and in his debut scored 12 points, four rebounds, four assists and two steals in an 87-78 win over the Brisbane Bullets.

At Maryland, Blake was the first ACC player to compile 1,000 points, 800 assists, 400 rebounds and 200 steals.

He led Maryland to the National Championship in 2002.

Blake finished his career 5th in NCAA all-time career assist with 972, and was named First Team All ACC in 2003.

He was so revered at Maryland that the school, at the start of the 2003-2004 season, retired his No. 25 jersey and raised it to the rafters at the Comcast Center.

In high school, Blake spent his freshman and sophomore seasons at Miami Killian High before he transferred to Miami High, where he won back-to-back state titles. Miami Heat power forward Udonis Haslem was his teammate.

However, the FHSAA forced Miami High to forfeit the titles following an investigation that alleged players used fake addresses to enroll and play at the school.

Blake then attended Oak Hill Academy in Virginia, where he finished high school.
