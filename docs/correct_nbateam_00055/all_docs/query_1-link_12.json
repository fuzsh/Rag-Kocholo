Child development follows an orderly sequence • Teachers use their knowledge of developmental sequences to gauge whether children are developing as expected, to determine reasonable expectations, and to plan next steps in the learning process. Children develop at varying rates • Teachers give children opportunities to pursue activities at their own pace. • Teachers repeat activities more than once so children can participate according to changing needs and abilities. • Teachers plan activities with multiple learning objectives to address the needs of more and less advanced learners. Children learn best when they feel safe and secure • Teachers develop nurturing relationships with children and remain with children long enough so children can easily identify a specific adult from whom to seek help, comfort, attention, and guidance. • Daily routines are predictable. Changes in routine are explained in advance so children can anticipate what will happen. • There is two-way communication between teachers and families, and families are welcome in the program. • Children have access to images, objects, and activities that reflect their home experiences. • The early childhood environment complies with all safety requirements. • Adults use positive discipline to enhance children’s self-esteem, self-control, and problem-solving abilities. • Teachers address aggression and bullying calmly, firmly, and proactively. Children are active learners • Activities, transitions, and routines respect children’s attention span, need for activity and need for social interaction. Inactive segments of the day are short. • Children participate in gross motor activities every day. Children learn through a combination of physical experience, social experience, and reflection • Adults encourage children to explore and investigate. They pose questions, offer information, and challenge children’s thinking. • Children have many chances to document and reflect on their ideas. Children learn through mastery and challenge • Practitioners simplify, maintain, or extend activities in response to children’s functioning and comprehension. Children’s learning profiles vary • Teachers present the same information in more than one modality (seeing, hearing, touching) and through different types of activities. • Children have opportunities to play on their own and with others; indoors and outdoors; with natural and manufactured materials.

Just 13 percent of the globe’s oceans remain unsoiled by humanity’s damaging impacts (Carrington, 2018). In the remotest poles and Pacific areas, most of the ocean has no natural marine wildlife. Pollution, huge fishing fleets, and global shipping along with climate change are all degrading the oceans. The vehicles we drive every day, industrial wastes, overpopulation, and fossil fuels, all have negative effects on the environment. Human activities are negatively affecting the environment by degrading it and sooner or later, the earth will not be able to sustain humans. Overpopulation is now an epidemic with decreased mortality rates, improved medicine, and food sustainability. We are living longer, which is increasing population. The impact of overpopulation includes environmental degradation due to cutting down of trees to create space. With less trees to filter the air, an increase in carbon dioxide levels is damaging every single organism (Interesting Engineering, 2019). Another effect of overpopulation is overdependence on fossil fuels such as coal and oil, which emit plentiful carbon oxide into the air. With increased population, humans need more space, which damage ecosystems and augment carbon dioxide emissions. Pollution is another impact of human activities on the environment. From trash, industrial wastes to carbon dioxide emissions into the air, pollutions is inevitable. Over 2.4 billion individuals have no access to sources of clean water. Human activities continue to deplete indispensable resources such as soil, water, and air. United States, for example, produces 147 million metric tons of air pollution annually (Interesting Engineering, 2019). Air quality in developing nations continues to plummet as well. This means that we are engaging in activities that are hurting the environment. Global warming is one of the greatest causes of environmental degradation contributed by human activities. Some people do not believe that global warming is real. However, that is not true, and its major contributors include carbon dioxide emissions from respiration, deforestation, and burning fossil fuels. Each year, we continue to contribute to levels of carbon dioxide globally. Current levels exceed 400 PPM, and the rise in carbon dioxide emissions are attributed to an increase in global temperatures (Interesting Engineering, 2019). The result is the melting of arctic glaciers and land ice, which will increase sea levels, and have negative effects on oceanic life. Climate change is another impact on the environment that is being caused by us.

(I did not make one, feel free to choose any research that has to do with psychology.) Check out Audris Oh's research summary I put in the files -- it's a great model. Write your summary in 5 pages or so, basically summarizing each of the major sections - literature review, methods section, results section and discussion. Let the abstract at the beginning of the paper guide you (It's just one paragraph but is a great guide). Why was the study done and how does it fit in with other work in the field (the intro or lit review)? What was the actual experiment (the methods section)? What were the results (the results section)? Why is it important (the discussion section)? Conclude your paper with a personal reaction -- does this fit with what you’ve seen? How might you use any insight the study provides? Include the pdf of the article (or link to it) and the reference to the article in APA style.

Mendel investigated the seg- regation of seven gene characters of pea (Pisum sativum), of which four have been identified. Here, we review what is known about the molecular nature of these genes, which encode enzymes (R and Le), a biochemical regula- tor (I) and a transcription factor (A). The mutations are: a transposon insertion (r), an amino acid insertion (i), a splice variant (a) and a missense mutation (le-1). The nature of the three remaining uncharacterized characters (green versus yellow pods, inflated versus constricted pods, and axial versus terminal flowers) is discussed.

Nature GeNetics VOLUME 43 | NUMBER 10 | OCTOBER 2011 1 0 3 5 l e t t e r s Brassica nigra (B genome) and B. oleracea (C genome) having formed the amphidiploid species B. juncea (A and B genomes), B. napus (A and C genomes) and B. carinata (B and C genomes) by hybridiza- tion. Comparative physical mapping studies have confirmed genome triplication in a common ancestor of B. oleracea11 and B. rapa12 since its divergence from the A. thaliana lineage at least 13–17 MYA6,7,13. Using 72× coverage of paired short read sequences generated by Illumina GA II technology and stringent assembly parameters, we assembled the genome of the B. rapa ssp. pekinensis line Chiifu-401-42 and analyzed the assembly (Online Methods and Supplementary Note). The final assembly statistics are summarized in Table 1. The assembled sequence of 283.8 Mb was estimated to cover >98% of the gene space (Supplementary Table 1) and is greater than the previous estimated size of the euchromatic space, 220 Mb14. The assembly showed excellent agreement with the previously reported chromosome A03 (ref. 15) and with 647 bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs)14 (Online Methods) sequenced by Sanger technology. Integration with 199,452 BAC-end sequences produced 159 super scaffolds representing 90% of the assem- bled sequences, with an N50 scaffold (N50 scaffold is a weighted median statistic indicating that 50% of the entire assembly is contained in scaf- folds equal to or larger than this value) size of 1.97 Mb. Genetic mapping of 1,427 markers in B. rapa allowed us to produce ten pseudo chromo- somes that included 90% of the assembly (Supplementary Table 2). We found the difference in the physical sizes of the A. thaliana and B. rapa genomes to be largely because of transposable elements (Supplementary Table 3). Although widely dispersed throughout the genome, as shown in Figure 1, the transposon-related sequences were most abundant in the vicinity of the centromeres. We estimated that transposon-related sequences occupy 39.5% of the genome, with the proportions of retrotransposons (with long terminal repeats), DNA transposons and long interspersed elements being 27.1%, 3.2% and 2.8%, respectively (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). We modeled and analyzed protein coding genes (described in the Online Methods and the Supplementary Note). We identified 41,174 protein coding genes, distributed as shown in Figure 1. The gene models have an average transcript length of 2,015 bp, a coding length of 1,172 bp and a mean of 5.03 exons per gene, both similar to that observed in A. thaliana16. A total of 95.8% of gene models have a match in at least one of the public protein databases and 99.3% are represented among the public EST collections o.\n\nScanlon Technologies, Inc. Anne Scanlon founded Scanlon Technol.docx\n\nScanlon Technologies, Inc. Anne Scanlon founded Scanlon Technol.docxtodd331\n\nScanlon Technologies, Inc. * Anne Scanlon founded Scanlon Technologies, Inc., in 1993. The company designed and manufactured high-tech products that were used in various industries ranging from semiconductor to aviation. Over the years, Scanlon Technologies reported a compound annual growth rate in revenues of over 20% due to high demand for the company’s products and Anne’s superior management skills. By the end of 1996, it was clear that any further growth would have to come from international expansion. However, establishing manufacturing operations and opening up sales and marketing offices abroad required a significant amount of capital. Anne considered investing more of her own money into the business; however, given that she already had most of her wealth tied up in the company, she decided against the idea. Moreover, she believed that the amount of funds Scanlon Technologies needed to raise for expansion was in the tens of millions. In her mind, there was only one clear solution—go public. In September 1996, Anne hired J.P. Suisse, a top tier investment bank, to take Scanlon Technologies public. On January 1, 1997, the company, which was authorized by the State of Delaware to sell 20 million common stock and 10 million preferred stock, issued one million shares of common stock in an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol STI. The stock, which had a par value of $1, was sold for $20 per share and climbed to $26 a share by the end of its first trading day. As expected, the funds raised in the IPO were used to open offices all over the world as well as build a second manufacturing plant in Toronto, Canada. Over the next couple of years, business was good and the company was able to generate enough cash to maintain its level of operations. In October 1999, Anne learned that Kadehjian Solution s Coporation, a competitor, was considering the option of being acquired. Anne believed that such an acquisition would position Scanlon Technologies as the industry leader. One of Kadehjian’s requirements for such an acquisition was that it be an all-cash transaction. Anne knew that this would require Scanlon Technologies to raise approximately $7 million. Ann contracted J.P. Suisse to discuss raising these funds through the capital markets. The managing directors at J.P. Suisse recommended that Scanlon Technologies employ a combination of debt and equity securities. Anne agreed and on January 1, 2000, the company issued an additional one hundred thousand shares of its $1 par value common stock at $40 per share. On the same day, the company issued $2 million in bonds at 95.8, due in 5 years with 5% interest payable annually (at year end). The market interest rate at the time was 6% per year. Also on January 1, 2000, Scanlon Technologies issued $1.3 million in zero-coupon (i.e. no interest) convertible bonds, also due in 5 years. Each $1,000 bond converted into 20 shares of its commo.\n\nSBUX ISIncome Statement - As Reported 10K in millionsIncome Statem.docx\n\nSBUX ISIncome Statement - As Reported 10K in millionsIncome Statem.docxtodd331\n\nSBUX ISIncome Statement - As Reported 10K in millionsIncome Statement - As Reported 10Q in millions9/30/139/30/149/30/159/30/169/30/179/30/18TTM12/30/173/30/186/30/189/30/1812/29/18TTM Company-operated stores$11,793.2$12,977.9$15,197.3$16,844.1$17,650.719,690.320,318.8 Company-operated stores4,741.84,828.05,060.45,060.1$5,370.3020,318.8 Total specialty$3,073.6$3,469.9$3,965.4$4,471.8$4,736.15,029.24,959.6 Total specialty1,331.91,203.81,249.91,243.5$1,262.404,959.6 Licensed stores$1,360.5$1,588.6$1,861.9$2,154.2$2,355.02,652.22,706.9 Licensed stores682.4625.6660.6683.6$737.102,706.9 CPG, foodservice and other$1,713.1$1,881.3$2,103.5$2,317.6$2,381.12,377.02,252.7 CPG, foodservice and other649.5578.2589.3559.9$525.302,252.7Total net revenues$14,866.8$16,447.8$19,162.7$21,315.9$22,386.8$24,719.525,278.4Total net revenues6,073.76,031.86,310.36,303.6$6,632.7025,278.4 Cost of sales including occupancy costs-$6,382.3-$6,858.8-$7,787.5-$8,511.1-$9,038.2-10,174.5-10,434.2 Cost of sales including occupancy costs-2,502.9-2,516.0-2,554.9-2,604.6($2,758.70)-10,434.2 Store operating expenses-$4,286.1-$4,638.2-$5,411.1-$6,064.3-$6,493.3-7,193.2-7,449.2 Store operating expenses-1,737.0-1,789.6-1,825.0-1,841.6($1,993.00)-7,449.2 Other operating expenses-$431.8-$457.3-$522.4-$545.4-$553.8-539.3-532.2 Other operating expenses-141.6-134.3-148.0-156.7($93.20)-532.2 Depreciation and amortization expenses-$621.4-$709.6-$893.9-$980.8-$1,011.4-1,247.0-1,321.6 Depreciation and amortization expenses-258.8-331.6-330.0-326.6($333.40)-1,321.6 General and administrative expenses-$937.9-$991.3-$1,196.7-$1,360.6-$1,393.3-1,759.0-1,797.8 General and administrative expenses-379.1-405.8-468.7-460.0($463.30)-1,797.8 Restructuring and impairments$0.0$0.0$0.0$0.0-$153.5-224.4-240.0 Restructuring and impairments-27.6-134.7-16.9-45.2($43.20)-240.0 Litigation credit / charge-$2,784.1$20.2$0.0$0.0$0.0$0.0Income from equity investees89.452.771.487.7$67.80279.6Income from equity investees$251.4$268.3$249.9$318.2$391.4301.2279.6Operating income / loss1,116.1772.51,038.2956.6$1,015.703,783.0Operating income / loss-$325.4$3,081.1$3,601.0$4,171.9$4,134.7$3,883.33,783.0Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture1,326.3Net interest and other income62.3483-$24.8074.9 Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture$0.0$0.0$390.6$0.0$0.01,376.4$0.0 Interest income and other, net88.2313239$24.80126.0Loss on divestiture of certain operations$0.0$0.0-$61.1$0.0$0.0499.2 Interest expense-25.9-503($75.00)-77.0 Interest income and other, net$123.6$142.7$43.0$108.0$275.3191.4$126.0Earnings / loss before income taxes3,005.9363236$965.501,068.7 Interest expense-$28.1-$64.1-$70.5-$81.3-$92.5-170.3-$77.0Income tax expense / benefit-755.8-35-45-64($205.10)-349.4Earnings / loss before income taxes-$229.9$3,159.7$3,903.0$4,198.6$4,317.5$5,780.0$1,068.7Net earnings / loss including noncontrolling interests2,250.18161,027932$760.403,534.721.83%Net earnings / loss attributab.\n\nScale Ratio Variable Histograms are useful for presenting qu.docx\n\nScale Ratio Variable Histograms are useful for presenting qu.docxtodd331\n\nScale Ratio Variable Histograms are useful for presenting quantitative data such as the example variable ADULT_CT which describes the number of individuals per household. The variable measurement is scale ratio and as it depicts a number, a histogram is able to reflect the number of individuals belonging to each variable value or interval of values (Mishra, Pandey, Singh & Gupta, 2018).). Histograms divide the variable into equal intervals as shown below in individuals reported per home. The graph indicates nearly 3,000 reporting and displays the individual numbers per interval. The bar levels of the graph make it is easy to discern the average number reporting as 2 per household. Nominal Variable As nominal variables depict qualitative data such as in the variable Q87 which describes the level of trust individuals felt towards others, a pie graph would be beneficial to use as it easily displays each group or individual share in the total being examined (Mishra, Pandey, Singh & Gupta, 2018). For example, the pie graph here which shows what percentage of trust was and wasn’t felt toward others. Graphs like these are appropriate for showing a variable that cannot be ordered or numerical in value such as feelings of trust (Frankfort-Nachmias, Leon-Guerrero & Davis, 2020).

Strategic Management: A Core Concern for Apple The Opening of the Apple Store Image courtesy of Neil Bird, http://www.flickr.com/photos/nechbi/2058929337. March 2, 2011, was a huge day for Apple. The firm released its much-anticipated iPad2, a thinner and faster version of market-leading Apple’s iPad tablet device. Apple also announced that a leading publisher, Random House, had made all seventeen thousand of its books available through Apple’s iBookstore. Apple had enjoyed tremendous success for quite some time. Approximately fifteen million iPads were sold in 2010, and the price of Apple’s stock had more than tripled from early 2009 to early 2011. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/ http://www.saylor.org/books http://www.flickr.com/photos/nechbi/2058929337 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 5 But future success was far from guaranteed. The firm’s visionary founder Steve Jobs was battling serious health problems. Apple’s performance had suffered when an earlier health crisis had forced Jobs to step away from the company. This raised serious questions. Would Jobs have to step away again? If so, how might Apple maintain its excellent performance without its leader? Meanwhile, the iPad2 faced daunting competition. Samsung, LG, Research in Motion, Dell, and other manufacturers were trying to create tablets that were cheaper, faster, and more versatile than the iPad2. These firms were eager to steal market share by selling their tablets to current and potential Apple customers. Could Apple maintain leadership of the tablet market, or would one or more of its rivals dominate the market in the years ahead? Even worse, might a company create a new type of device that would make Apple’s tablets obsolete? http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/ http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 6 1.1 Defining Strategic Management and Strategy L E A R N I N G O B J E C T I V E S 1.

Although Blake’s team finished third in the second season of the show, the experience afforded him the opportunity to visit Argentina, where he returned in 2006 and developed the idea to build a company around the alpargata—a popular style of shoe in that region. The premise of the company Blake started was a unique one. For every shoe sold, a pair will be given to someone in need. This simple business model was the basis for TOMS Shoes, which has now given away more than one million pairs of shoes to those in need in more than twenty countries worldwide.

Understand what law governs bankruptcy in the United States. 2. Know the key provisions of the law. The Purpose of Bankruptcy Law Bankruptcy law governs the rights of creditors and insolvent debtors who cannot pay their debts. In broadest terms, bankruptcy deals with the seizure of the debtor’s assets and their distribution to the debtor’s various creditors. The term derives from the Renaissance custom of Italian traders, who did their trading from benches in town marketplaces. Creditors literally “broke the bench” of a merchant who failed to pay his debts. The term banco rotta (broken bench) thus came to apply to business failures. In the Victorian era, many people in both England and the United States viewed someone who became bankrupt as a wicked person. In part, this attitude was prompted by the law itself, which to a greater degree in England and to a lesser degree in the United States treated the insolvent debtor as a sort of felon. Until the second half of the nineteenth century, British insolvents could be imprisoned; jail for insolvent debtors was abolished earlier in the United States. And the entire administration of bankruptcy law favored the creditor, who could with a mere filing throw the financial affairs of the alleged insolvent into complete disarray. Today a different attitude prevails. Bankruptcy is understood as an aspect of financing, a system that permits creditors to receive an equitable distribution of the bankrupt person’s assets and promises new hope to debtors facing impossible financial burdens. Without such a law, we may reasonably suppose that the level of economic activity would be far less than it is, for few would be willing to risk being personally burdened forever by crushing debt. Bankruptcy gives the honest debtor a fresh start and resolves disputes among creditors.

From its humble beginnings, Starbucks grew to become the largest coffeehouse company in the world while stressing the importance of both financial and social goals. As it created thousands of stores across dozens of countries, the company navigated many interesting periods. The last few years were a particularly fascinating era. In early 2007, Starbucks appeared to be very successful, and its stock was worth more than $35 per share. By 2008, however, the economy was slowing, competition in the coffee business was heating up, and Starbucks’s performance had become disappointing. In a stunning reversal of fortune, the firm’s stock was worth less than $10 per share by the end of the year. Anxious stockholders wondered whether Starbucks’s decline would continue or whether the once high-flying company would return to its winning ways. Riding to the rescue was Howard Schultz, the charismatic and visionary founder of Starbucks who had stepped down as chief executive officer eight years earlier. Schultz again took the helm and worked to turn the company around by emphasizing its mission statement: “to inspire and nurture the human spirit—one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.” [1]About a thousand underperforming stores were shut down permanently. Thousands of other stores closed for a few hours so that baristas could be retrained to make inspiring drinks. Food offerings were revamped to ensure that coffee—not breakfast sandwiches— were the primary aroma that tantalized customers within Starbucks’s outlets. By the time Starbucks’s fortieth anniversary arrived, Schultz had led his company to regain excellence, and its stock price w.\n\nSanFranciscoStateUniversity,CollegeofBusiness,Dep.docx\n\nSanFranciscoStateUniversity,CollegeofBusiness,Dep.docxtodd331\n\nSan Francisco State University, College of Business, Department of Hospitality and Tourism Management HTM 561 – Hotel Operations Management Assignment – Technology's Impact on the Hotel Worker and Unions Assigned Article(s): Hotel Workers Fret Over a New Rival: Alexa at the Front Desk Sept. 24, 2018 – By Eduardo Porter The bosses haven’t yet introduced facial recognition technology at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. But from her perch behind the front desk at the pink neo-Moorish palace overlooking Waikiki Beach, Jean Te’o-Gibney can see it coming. “Marriott just rolled it out in China,” enabling guests to check into their rooms without bothering with front-desk formalities, said Ms. Te’o-Gibney, a 53-year-old grandmother of seven. “It seems they know they will be eliminating our jobs.” Similar fears simmer throughout Marriott’s vast network of hotels, the largest in the United States. Over the last two weeks, Ms. Te’o-Gibney and thousands of other Marriott workers — cooks and cashiers, bellhops and housekeepers — have voted to authorize their union, Unite Here, to strike at dozens of locations from Waikiki to Boston and San Diego to Detroit. Alongside the usual demands for higher wages and better workplace safety, the union is bringing another issue to the table, asking for procedures to protect workers affected by new technologies and the innovations they spur.

Many earned too little to justify large capital costs to replace them. A typical hotel or motel desk clerk earns just over $12 an hour, according to government data; a concierge just over $13.50. And many of the tasks they perform seemed too challenging to automate. Technology is changing this calculus. There is no equivalent measure on the penetration of software systems like Alexa or touch screens in the workplace. But in 2014, automakers in the United States had 117 robots for ever.\n\nSaylor URL httpwww.saylor.orgbooks Saylor.org 313 .docx\n\nSaylor URL httpwww.saylor.orgbooks Saylor.org 313 .docxtodd331\n\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 313 Chapter 10 Leading an Ethical Organization: Corporate Governance, Corporate Ethics, and Social Responsibility L E A R N I N G O B J E C T I V E S After reading this chapter, you should be able to understand and articulate answers to the following questions: 1.

The system deals with the problems of organising and executing the millions of transactions that are fundamental to many large businesses. SAP is the leader in the ERP market. SAP ERP is a very large system which incorporates over 30,000 tables, and 50,000 transactions. This tutorial is an introduction designed to assist you with familiarising yourself with the SAP ERP basics utilising SAP’s latest ERP release: S/4HANA. Traditionally SAP’s ERP system could operate on a number of different databases (Oracle. SQL Server. DB2 etc). However SAP S/4HANA has been designed to take advantage of SAP HANA database’s in-memory capabilities. Getting Started SAP S/4HANA can operate on a variety of personal computers using different operating systems. You can access S/4HANA either through the traditional interface (SAPGUI) or the new interface (Fiori) built with HTML5 based on the UI5 standard. But no matter which equipment, operating system or interface which is used, there are some necessary requirements: Log On details Due to the value of the information stored in the ERP system it is necessary to control the access to the software. The SAP administrator would need to establish a user account for each user who intends to use the ERP system. Each user account is identified by a user name and requires a password for security. Each user account is also allocated a particular type of security profile which determines the data a user is allowed to view and change. The other log on detail you require is the Client number. A Client is a set of self contained tables required for processing transactions in the SAP system. A user in one client can not change the data in another Client. You will need ."
