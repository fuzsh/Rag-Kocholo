        "text": "Fact to an extent: Steve Blake is safe her in Washington, he was a steal for us in the 2nd round and we are going to keep him...as for Dixon, he was a waste of a pick and there were rumors at the beginning of summer he was going over to France to play ball for his favorite coach because he wasnt getting time for hte Wizards. I think he will be gone by the beginning of the 05/06 season.\n\nF/F: Arenas will be an allstar\n\nThis is one of the stupidest threads I've ever seen. I want intelligent basketball conversation, not screwed up game threads. <font color=\"Blue\">EDIT</font>\n\nThe reason this thread is bad is because it attracts screwed up five year old punks like that kid. I don't want that in this forum.\n\n<font color=\"blue\">Everyone can make their own usernames, you have no right to criticize his username or anything about him. If you do not like this thread, do not post in it, it is that simple. It involves basketball conversation and is something to give the Wiz forum a boost right now. Thankyou--Kobe 8 Ball</font>\n\n<div class=\"quote_poster\">Quoting MavsJ33:</div><div class=\"quote_post\">Fistion: I don't think that Hughes will handle either being the 3rd or 4th option of the team. He didn't in Golden State what makes you think he will in Washington. And just wanted to go back to the Jamison one. He will make the All-Star team.\n\nF/F The Wizards will get past the first round of the playoffs assuming they get in.</div>\n\nFiction I dont think they will get in, but for arguement sake if they do get in it will be most likely with a 7th or 8th seed meaning they will be matched up in the first round against either the Pistons, Heat, or Magic (weak division and a little bias). They can not beat nay of those teams the Pistons are the pistons enough said, the Heat have Shaq the Wiz have Etan Thomas , the Magic have a lot of good defenders that could and would shut down the offense of the wiz. Brown at this point I am labeling a bust he will get a few blocks here and there, but not much else so he wont be much for the wiz and then Etan Thomas and Antoine Jamison possibly Hayes if he is a starter could not match up well with a front court of a healthy grant hill, Howard/ Batties defense, and Cato'sm inside pressence and strength.\n\nF/F Dixon will be a future all star."
