        "text": "The Sydney Kings have moved quickly to replace import Michael Bryson, signing NBA journeyman Steve Blake as their third import.\n\nThe NBL ladder leaders released the young guard on Friday, announcing Blake as his replacement on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"Any time you have someone of that experience it means a lot,\" coach Andrew Gaze said. \"He's played at the highest level for such a long period of time. He's played with some of the greatest players in the world.\n\n\"The role that we have for him is something that is going to be an adjustment for us and an adjustment for him, and hopefully it can all work out and be beneficial for both.\"\n\nGaze was sold on bringing in Blake, who played alongside Kobe Bryant for four years in Los Angeles, by managing director Jeff Van Groningen.\n\n\"Jeff did the research and was able to put that together,\" Gaze said. \"He presented it to us and we thought it would be a good fit for us to get someone that the guys can learn from, can bring a lot of experience.\"\n\nBlake, 36, comes to the NBL after 13 years in the NBA. After a distinguished college career that peaked with the 2002 NCAA Championship, Blake was snapped up by the Washington Wizards with the 38th pick in the 2003 NBA draft.\n\nOver the course of his career, he played with the Wizards, Portland Trail Blazers (three times), Milwaukee Bucks, Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors and Detroit Pistons.\n\nDespite an injury-plagued time with the Lakers, he became an instrumental part of their bench in 2010.\n\nPart of the \"killer bees\", Blake, Matt Barnes and Shannon Brown became a vital element in the Lakers' fortunes under coach Phil Jackson.\n\nBlake has career averages of 6.5 points, four assists, and 2.1 rebounds a game.\n\nHe joins another former Laker in Josh Powell at the Kingdome, who left Los Angeles just before Blake arrived.\n\n\"He's a very good player and extremely competitive,\" Powell told Fox Sports News on Saturday.\n\n\"It's just good to have somebody that has that experience and leadership to go along with the guys in the group that we have. I look forward to it and I know everybody else does as well.\"\n\nBlake replaces Bryson in the King's line-up after the 22-year-old struggled to make an impact for the Kings.\n\n\"It is extremely tough when dealing with a young man whose character is nothing short of exemplary,\" Van Groningen said. \"Michael quickly became very popular with the front office, his teammates, the coaching staff and fans.\n\n\"But we considered our options with great care. We believe making this change will assist the team's balance as we move forward this season.\"\n\nThe Kings are 3-1 this season and face a tantalising match-up against the Illawarra Hawks on Monday night.\n\nThe Kings got the better of the Hawks in their first meeting in Illawarra, but the Hawks (1-3) will be desperate to even the ledger.\n\nGaze is preparing for a tough encounter against bitter rivals.\n\n\"Of course they will be out for revenge,\" Gaze said. \"This league is so, so tight right from top to bottom. Every single game is a battle. And if you're not playing to your best, teams will beat you.\"\n\n\"A home court is very, very important because it's going to be so hard to get road wins. So for us, it's a big, big game."
