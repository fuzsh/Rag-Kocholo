        "text": "Blake, a four-year veteran, averaged 8.3 points and 6.6 assists in 49 games with Denver last season.\n\nIt is Blake's second stint with the Blazers. He played for the team in 2005-06, averaging 8.2 points and 4.5 assists. He still has an offseason home in the area.\n\nBlake told the Rocky Mountain News that he decided to return to Portland because the Nuggets appeared on the verge of finalizing a contract with guard Chucky Atkins.\n\n\"That's OK, if that's the direction they want to go,\" Blake told the newspaper. \"I just decided to go back to Portland.\"\n\nCalls placed to Blake's agent Friday were not immediately returned.\n\nBlake made $1.33 million last season and was seeking a starting salary close to the NBA's $5.35 million midlevel exception.\n\nBlake lives with his family in West Linn, Ore., near Portland, during the offseason, and just bought a new home.\n\nOther teams reportedly interested in Blake included the Miami Heat and the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nBlake, 27, played for the University of Maryland. For his career, he has averaged 6.4 points, 1.9 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 22.5 minutes with the Washington Wizards, Blazers, Milwaukee Bucks and Nuggets.\n\n\"Steve embodies the kind of culture we're building here in Portland,\" Blazers general manager Kevin Pritchard said. \"He's an intelligent, hardworking, team player with a tremendous grasp as to what it takes to play the point guard position.\"\n\nThe move makes the Blazers deep at point guard, with Blake, Jarrett Jack and Sergio Rodriguez, as well as Brandon Roy, the NBA's Rookie of the Year, who played the point at times last season."
