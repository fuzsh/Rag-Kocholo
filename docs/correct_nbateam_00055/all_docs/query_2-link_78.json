        "text": "SYDNEY Kings import Steve Blake was part of arguably the most productive high school basketball program in the world and now coach Andrew Gaze is hoping he will put the finishing touches on his team’s unlikely push for a championship.\n\nVirginia’s Oak Hill Academy has a list of graduates that reads like a who’s who of the NBA — Kevin Durant, Carmelo ­Anthony, Rajon Rondo and Jerry Stackhouse to name a few. But Blake’s role at the Kings won’t be to take over games like many of his old school mates did.\n\nThe veteran of 870 NBA games at eight different teams including the Los Angeles Lakers, Portland Trail Blazers and most recently the Detroit Pistons will be there to provide much needed back up to Kevin Lisch and Jason Cadee.\n\n“He gives us more insurance,” Gaze told The Sunday Telegraph.\n\n“If something were to happen to Jason or Kevin now we didn’t feel like we had the guy who we could throw in there and provide some minutes.”\n\nBlake is 36, but Gaze doesn’t see this as a problem.\n\n“He played more than 50 games last season (in the NBA) averaging 17 minutes per game so physically we feel he’s OK,” he said.\n\n“We need a good 20-25 minutes from him with the capacity to play 40 if we need him to. Steve is at an age where he can help Jason and Kevin on the floor and can also educate some of our younger players.\n\n“These moves come at significant risk, but we felt it was worth it.”\n\nThe change comes at the expense of import Michael Bryson. Gaze said he looked locally but couldn’t find what he needed.\n\n“There were no other Australians that could step in to the role we were looking for,” Gaze said.\n\n“It was disappointing because I really liked Michael and although we didn’t see the best of him here I thought he had a lot of upside. It was just that circumstances were we needed back up in that spot.”\n\nThe Kings host the Illawarra Hawks at Qudos Bank Arena on Monday night when they will be looking to maintain their hold on top spot on the NBL ladder but Gaze admits he has some worries about the contest.\n\n“When you think of the firepower Illawarra have we go into this game with a bit of a handicap,” Gaze said.\n\n“Not having Steve here yet and Michael gone it’s a difficult challenge for us. We still think we have the talent to win this game but when you look at the changes we have made it’s less than ideal but all teams have to deal with it.”\n\nBlake said joining the Sydney Kings was an exciting prospect.\n\n“They are a great organization that I have heard nothing but great things about,” he said.\n\n“The same applies for the city of Sydney and Australia overall. So I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to experience a part of the world I have never been to.\n\n“I can’t wait to meet my teammates and coaches and get started.”\n\nSTEVE BLAKE\n\nAge: 36 Position: Guard Height: 191cm Weight: 78kg\n\nCollege: Maryland (1999—2003) 2002 NCAA champions\n\nNBA draft: 2003 Round 2, Pick 38. Selected by the Washington Wizards"
