        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Ernie Grunfeld was hired as president of basketball operations of the Washington Wizards on Monday, taking the job that Michael Jordan held the last two seasons.\n\nThe hiring came a day after Grunfeld was released from his contract as general manager of the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nHe inherits a team that went 37-45 in the two years Jordan held that position while playing his final two years in the NBA. Washington owner Abe Pollin decided he no longer wanted Jordan as an executive.\n\nGrunfeld is the final piece of Washington's front-office puzzle. Two weeks ago Pollin hired Eddie Jordan to replace Doug Collins, who had been Michael Jordan's hand-picked choice as coach.\n\nThe Wizards on Monday also introduced their two draft selections — Jarvis Hayes of Georgia and Steve Blake of Maryland.\n\n\"From my standpoint, those of you that have said that Mr. Pollin is over-the-hill, incompetent and doesn't know what he's doing,\" Pollin said. \"I think we proved that we still know what we're doing and we got what we wanted.\"\n\nPollin had said he hoped to have a new president of basketball operations by the night of the June 26 draft. However, draft duties were handled by outgoing general manager Wes Unseld.\n\n\"I told you that I was going to get the best brain in basketball to be the president of basketball operations that I could get,\" Pollin said. \"It's been somewhat of a longer process than I thought — at times aggravating. But I didn't give up because I got the guy I wanted.\"\n\nGrunfeld, who assembled three playoff teams during four seasons with the Bucks, has little time to get adjusted. Tuesday is the first day teams can begin to talk with free agents.\n\n\"I haven't even seen my office yet,\" Grunfeld said. \"So once we get that out of the way we'll start moving along.\"\n\nThe Wizards haven't made the playoffs since 1997 and haven't won a playoff series since 1982.\n\nDespite drafting Blake, the search for a point guard is the top priority for Washington in the free agent market.\n\n\"We have Jared (Jeffries), Kwame (Brown) and those guys have a year or two under their belt,\" Eddie Jordan said. \"We've got some veterans. The youthfulness and inexperience is out now. You can't use that anymore.\""
