        "text": "WASHINGTON — Wednesday was 16 years to the day that Sam Presti was named general manager of the then-Seattle Supersonics, in 2007. He was 29. He didn’t know anyone in the Emerald City and had to hit the ground running for a franchise teetering on the edge of relocation. He called the guy he often called in similar situations: Hank Smith, the legendary coach at Division III Emerson College in Boston, who won 258 games in 16 seasons there, for whom Presti played two seasons in college, and whose program has served as an amazing springboard for front office talent throughout NBA front offices for the last decade and a half.\n\nI need two guys that I can trust, and that I can work hard, Presti told Smith. Guys to make airport pickups, run errands. To do whatever needed doing.\n\nSmith had a guy. Will Dawkins.\n\nPresti, of course, knew of Dawkins – who, at the time, was fourth on the school’s all-time scoring list. Presti was eight years ahead of Dawkins at Emerson, but he knew the rigorous academic bent of the place, knew how hard you had to work to excel at hoops and school. Knew that Emerson, at the time, didn’t have an on-campus gym, an had to play and practice at what was then an all-girls’ college, Pine Manor, half an hour away, in Chestnut Hill.\n\n“Going back (into Boston), it was about an hour,” Dawkins recalled Thursday. “So, you’ve got to get to your 9 a.m. class. We’re getting up at 5 every day, going to the gym, practicing. So, it took a different level of dedication. … and we’re a Division III school, so, we’re in minivans. We’re driving ourselves. We come back, hopping guys out of the cars – ‘go to class; you can’t shower yet.’ But it builds you.”\n\nThus began Dawkins’ professional basketball life – a perfect fit for the Oklahoma City Finishing School of Young Executives, where Dawkins had to relocate along with the rest of the Sonics’ organization in 2008, after the team moved from Seattle. For 15 years, Dawkins did everything one could do in the Thunder organization short of playing. He got beat up on the practice court by Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. He ran the Thunder’s draft room. He coordinated between the Thunder and its G League affiliate. He went on road trips with the Thunder, and abroad to scout international prospects. He worked yeoman hours in the video room, the same way that Erik Spoelstra did in Miami as he started his way up the ladder to becoming an NBA head coach.\n\nIn Miami, Spo just missed another young, hungry guy who arrived at the Heat’s “dungeon,” as they called the video room, in 1999, just after Spoelstra was promoted by Pat Riley to assistant coach. Name of Travis Schlenk.\n\nAll the worker bees reassembled at Capital One Thursday, as Dawkins, Schlenk and Michael Winger were all formally introduced alongside Ted Leonsis as the team’s new basketball braintrust. In Winger, the head honcho for Monumental Basketball; Dawkins, in charge of the Wizards as the team’s new general manager, and Schlenk, who will be the team’s director of player personnel, the Wizards now have, in abundance, a group of big hoop brains.\n\nThis does not guarantee the franchise will, finally, escape the amber in which it has been frozen for two generations. But Washington’s front office now has greater collective possibilities, more directions in which it can potentially turn the team, to expedite becoming more than an also-ran, than it’s had for most of the last 40 years.\n\nIt’s a big lift. But if this group can lift the substantial weight of #sowizards over its head, well, they’ll never buy another meal in this town again.\n\n“I’ve been lucky to have mentors and really close friends that are from the D.C. area,” Winger said after the introductory presser. “One you know rather well. He’s in Detroit (Pistons GM Troy Weaver). He told me, ‘Listen, this is going to be the greatest experience of your life. But it’s going to be hard. But, if you get it done, this city deserves it, they want it, and they’re going to rally behind you.’ That was compelling.”\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nAldridge: With Michael Winger, Ted Leonsis finally says the status quo is no longer good enough\n\nWinger and Dawkins spent seven seasons together in OKC, before Winger left for the Clippers’ GM job. Presti said the two “have a very clear idea of what it is that they want to see, and how they would want to operate on a day-to-day basis.\n\n“I think the tandem of them, and the way they fit together, will only allow that to come to fruition even quicker,” he said. “Because there’s a lot of overlap with respect to their values and their principles. They’re tremendous compliments in the areas that can stimulate progress, and debate, and all of those things that you need to establish a positive environment. But I think they’re a thousand percent aligned on the values and the foundational aspects of the type of people that they will want to have in the organization, the type of support they’ll provide them, and the way they’ll want to problem solve – with the values first.”\n\nLeonsis picked an intriguing time to change direction. The NBA’s next media rights deal, which will come online after the current one expires after the ’23-24 season, will almost certainly inject untold billions of new dollars into the league’s collective ecosystem, with a corresponding sharp rise in team salary caps. Alongside that, the new Collective Bargaining Agreement, which begins next season, will bring about draconian financial and roster-resource stripping penalties for teams that exceed the new luxury tax thresholds. So, there should be a) significant cap space going forward for all but the highest-spending teams and b) far fewer super teams with three max-level superstars on rosters, because it literally will no longer be worth it to most owners.\n\nBoth developments seem ideal for a franchise like the Wizards, which needs to play catch-up, and quickly, with the better teams in the league.\n\n“Whenever (the CBA) comes out, and we’re obviously able to see it, you spend time with it, work with it,” Dawkins said. “And the goal is to find the advantages. And the team that learns it, and can find those advantages early on, is the team that’s going to find those benefits earlier.”\n\nWinger and Dawkins worked together in OKC under Presti, who has guided any number of people out of the Thunder’s shop and into the world. Winger went on to become the Clippers’ general manager. Weaver is running the Pistons. Rob Hennigan got a shot in Orlando before returning to Oklahoma City. Rich Cho was the Blazers’ and Bobcats’ general manager. Scott Perry has had GM and/or executive duties with the Magic, Kings and Knicks. (That Dawkins, Weaver, Cho and Perry are executives of color speaks to Presti not just talking the talk of diversity, but walking the walk.)\n\nWhat intrigues the most about the Wizards’ new setup is that each of Washington’s new top executives have been central parts of rapid buildups – in three completely different markets with three completely different sets of advantages and challenges.\n\nWinger had the wind at his back in L.A., a top-two media market, in a city in which damn near every player wants to play, with the largesse of Steve Ballmer available to pay any price, bear any financial burden. The Clippers thus pivoted from the “Lob City” contender version — Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Doc Rivers — to the Kawhi Leonard-Paul George-Tyronn Lue group, in just two years.\n\nDawkins was in the NBA’s smallest market, Oklahoma City. In contrast to the Clippers, the Thunder almost never get any free agents. They have to not only nail the draft — they must crush it. They almost always do, going back to the Durant/Westbrook/James Harden three-year run from ’07 to ’09. And the biggest trade they did make, sending George to the Clips, brought back Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, now a first-team all-NBA point guard. And they’ve kept excelling at the draft, adding Josh Giddey, Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams the last three years, and developing undrafted two-way talent like wing Luguentz Dort.\n\nSchlenk got to Atlanta in 2017, after six seasons in Golden State’s front office. By 2020, the Hawks had drafted John Collins and Kevin Huerter; executed a draft day trade that, while costing them the rights to Luka Dončić, brought back All-Star guard Trae Young; signed free agent Bogdan Bogdanović and traded for Clint Capela and Danilo Gallinari. The next year, the Hawks were in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThe goal is to meld all of those experiences, in all of those places, into a cohesive battle plan for D.C.\n\n“I think that’s a strength of ours,” Dawkins said. “It’s a true strength of ours to be from different backgrounds, different markets, shared experiences. Michael and I obviously worked together in Oklahoma City, and we were able to talk through different strategies there as well, and come out connected. I will say that Travis’ experiences in Golden State and Atlanta, we’ll be able to heavily rely on those. Michael, in a big city, star players, heavily rely on those. And, in Oklahoma City, we kind of had two mountains. … we’ve all had a lot of shared experiences at high levels. And, once you put all that in a room, it’s gonna be a little janky for a little bit. But we’ll figure it out.”\n\nSaid Winger: “I think it’s probably unorthodox in so far as Will and I are going to collaborate on every meaningful roster decision, every meaningful top-level executive decision, but there shouldn’t be a mistake: Will is running basketball operations for the Wizards. And whatever that day-to-day management requires, whatever decisions that requires, those are Will’s decisions to make. Corporate decisions, higher-level player personnel decisions, I’m certainly going to be involved. There’s gonna be a team of us involved. Coach (John) Thompson (III) is involved. Travis is involved. Wes (Unseld Jr.) will be involved. … We’re going to be a very collaborative group.”\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nMichael Winger's monumental journey from 'stray cat' to the Wizards top dog\n\nWith just two weeks before the draft, and three before the start of free agency, it will be hard to find immediate equilibrium. But, eventually, they will have to align. They will have to decide whether there’s a way forward with Bradley Beal. They will have to determine whether it makes sense to re-sign either or both of Kyle Kuzma and Kristaps Porziņģis. Or they could decide to re-sign neither. They will have to opt for staying with the eighth pick in the June 22 draft, or trying to make a bold move up into the top four or five, or trade back from eight and begin accumulating future assets.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, you’d just hit the big “blow it up” button. But, Kuzma and Porziņģis have player options for next season. Beal, of course, has a no-trade clause. He controls his future. But this is where the relationships each of Washington’s new decision-makers have built up over the years with the game’s top agents, and agencies, must bear cooperative fruit. Big trades, or major free-agent signings, are almost always collaborations, with teams and players and agents working together for months, sometimes years, to find a resolution that works for all sides. The Wizards have almost never had a seat at those high-roller tables. Now, they will.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nRobbins: Winger preaches patience in market ‘starving for some basketball hope’\n\nRobbins: Michael Winger will have full authority to reshape the roster, sources say\n\n(Top photo: Kenny Giarla / Getty Images)"
