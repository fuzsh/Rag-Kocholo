You're sitting in history class, and the teacher is droning on about the Civil War. Your mind wanders into the distant fu- ture where your name could pos- sibly grace the evening news. Maybe you have just scored the winning touchdown at the Super Bowl, or maybe you're Brad Pitt's leading lady. Do these ideas seem a bit far- fetched? Some people's dreams really do come true. Where would we be without Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s dream of equal rights for all men or Neil Armstrong's aspiration of taking \"one small ' step for man, one giant leap for J mankind.\" ^ Others dream just to escape, We all would like to get away from the hassles of today's fast paced life. Daydreams provide students with needed escapes from the pressures of classroom anxieties.

Do you think we .should start il One of the biggest questions on the minds of students at Pikeville High School was, \"Where can we go and what can we do once we get there?\" Well, some students didn't have a very difficult time answering this seemingly unanswerable question. During the fall, loyal fans could be found supporting their mighty Panthers on Friday nights. When students were really at a loss for what to do. a car, a few members of the opposite sex to flirt with, and the streets of downtown Pikeville provided them with some- thing to do... besides the dishes. Another favorite place to be was, of course, at a friend's house or a party. Some of the best times could be spent doing pretty bizarre things, from play- ing Spin the Bottle to overdoing it on the punch, from playingTruth or Dare to eating until heartburn set in. So, most students had no problem coming up with ways to spend an otherwise uneventful Saturday night. Even though some students at Pikeville High knew just where to go and what to do to have a great time, there were those who liked nothing belter than to put on their sweats, or- tlcM a meat lover's pizza and pop in a Jj py of The Goonies.

Answering machines are no longer the way to receive important messages - don't leave a message at the beep, leave it on a beeper! To some, beepers are considered a neces- sity. They not only provide an instant smile, but getting \"beeped\" makes the students feel important. PHS students also expressed their sense of style through the way they dressed. Perhaps the most popular style was the \"little girl\" look. Plaid skirts, knee socks, and Mary Janes were a familiar sight. But no matter what the dress, every student showed individuality and creativity. Another trend was wildly colored nail polish. Normal colors were no longer the \"in\" thing; blue, purple, neon yellow, or even black became the rage. At the elementary having the lat- est bookbag - whether UK, Lion King, or Power Rangers - was an essential part of the students daily attire. No matter what the age, students at Pikeville have always been one step ahead of the rest.

Nowadays, there are many more diverse, some might say bizarre, hobbies. Baseball cards remain popular, alongside hockey, Star Trek, and Bay watch cards, not to mention col- lectible card games and cards bear- ing the likenesses of cartoon and comic book characters. Barbie dolls still abound, as do pewter Advanced Dungeons & Drag- ons figurines and resin statues of Spider-Man. Batman, Venom. Darth Vader, and the members of Kiss. A few dedicated souls still watch birds, but due to the insurgence of specialized movie stores in the United States, some are glued to their television sets. Now. instead of an- swering nature's call, bird-watchers possess the entire Trials of Life se- ries (by Time/Life).

For Pikeville High School students, summer has its own unique defi- nition. Some view summer as a time to broaden their horizons, and they travel to the most exotic of destinations, such as the Carribean and Mexico. Other stu- dents use their summers to be- come better students by traveling to nationally recognized colleges and universities to participate in seminars and scholar programs Most PHS students, though, look forward to summer in order to get a little rest and relaxation by per- fecting their tans pool side. Some financially minded students pre- fer to use their summers to earn extra dollars because working be- hind a counter or working up a sweat, if a dollar is to be earned, it will be earned. The possibili- ties for summer are endless and completely up to you. As always, PHS students have again proven that they know how to make a summer last year-round. i 4 Student Life ■f.

Behind the scenes ex- ists another world - one of makeup, costumes, scenery, prac- tice, and lots of last minute prepa- rations. High school life doesn't differ much from the planning and per- forming of a stage production. All sorts of preparation goes into get- ting ready for even the most seem- ingly unimportant event. From preparing to take a driver's test, to studying for a biology final, to spending a full day getting ready for the Prom, there is no script for high school life, and aren't we glad? Like a stage play, high school life is full of twists and turns, he- roes and villians. happy and sad endings.

When all hope was lost, students would reluctantly give up and head off to school to face the music. They dealt with the embarrassment of being seen with their hair resembling something from an- other dimension. They also encountered the harrassment their \"loving\" friends gave them. They even faced the horrified looks that greeted them when they walked down the hall. No matter what, though, no student could ever deny being faced with one of those devestating \"bad hair days.\" \" O/i, / knew super-glue wouldn't really my make my hair shiny. \" complains Amy Staten.

An- swers ranged from things such as putting it on the President's door- step (surprise Bill!) or using it as a good luck charm. The reaction to the question were, overall, astounding; the responses also provided some great laughs. Now, one last question — what exactly would you do with a Wuzzlewump? \"/ would pet it and love it an it George! \"\"Jessica Childers Sophomores Qrs.

However, one of the most important firsts was the aquirement of ..drum roll. ..a license. Sophomores faced those first driving fears \"head on\", and many funny or scary experiences came from getting behind the wheel for the first time. Receiving the first speeding ticket or going the wrong way in the McDonald's parking lot caused a lot of anxiety. One sure-fire goal of any stu- dent when he or she hit the road was to make sure their parents were \"driven crazy.\" \"Officer, I didn 't sell that cat on the black market, J swear!

Most of the time, nicknames leave much to the imagination. Freshmen tend to be such a \"creative\" group, searching daily for ways to express their indi- vidualities. Freshmen feel a sense of responsibility to their friends deeming them worthy of nicknames like \"Fuzzy\" or \"Hoppy.\" They have learned one thing for sure, though, \"playing the name game\" can bring a lot of laughs and fun times.

Most Freshmen seem to feel torn between hanging on to the days of paper wads and spit balls, and search- ing for that level of \"savior vivre\" displayed by the upper class. Some kids can handle these complex times rather well. How- ever, there are those who feel about as confused as a butterfly in a snowstorm. No matter what, one thing is for certain: being \"caught in the middle\" is a time for Freshmen to experiment with different attitudes and ways to express them.

Each year, the NHS does many activi- ties to help less-fortunate mem- bers of the community through hard times. The NHS began the year in a joint effort with the Stu- dent Council to help celebrate the eightieth anniversary of PHS. Students were stationed throughout the building to assist visitors and answer questions. Its next project was to make Thanksgiving baskets to take to a num- ber of families in the area. At Christ- mas, members brought food and toys to distribute. The club also went carolling at Mountain Manor Nursing Home. At Eastertime the club filled baskets of sweets for children in the area. Because of the great amount of candy and treats members brought in, around thirty Easter baskets were put together. As usual, NHS also helped with the annual blood drive. The school donated a record thirty-one pints of blood to the East Ky. Blood Center. This generous gift will save over 90 lives. The NHS remained one of the most active clubs at PHS. NHS officers include Prithu Mettu - President.

We've Got Sptritl This past school year was anything but boring for the Pep Club. The club participated in numerous activities like providing treats for the football team and sponsoring the Homecoming Dance. They also worked in conjunction with Student Council in Varsity week activites. The club also helped to organize both the Parent and Senior Appreciation nights for the football players, basketball players and cheerleaders. Pep Club, sponsored by Susan Huffman, was also in charge of the athletic banquet held at the end of the year to honor all athletes. Club members helped to keep morale high at PHS throughout the year by providing treats for all athletes in all sports. The year was hectic for all members of the club but, as always, they proudly shared in the mighty Panther's victories. \"One thousand fifty-one, one thousand fifty-two, one thousand fifty-three. . . wait, did I already count that one?

The Pep Club, traditional hosts for the gala event, outdid themselves by turning the Common's Area into a starry night. The dance was the grand finale to a fun filled week of preparation. Homecoming week ac- tivities involved the entire school and psyched everyone up for the big game, and of course, the big dance. The mighty Panther himself en- joyed the week-long party and reigned supreme over all activities.

Activities ^57 ^ The Magic of a Voice Student Council The Student Council has always played a large role in helping to make the students' voices heard. This year, the organization, sponsored by Cherry Lynn Pinson, performed numerous services to both the school and community. During the summer of 1995, members of the Stu- dent Council came to school to help with the 80th anni- versary celebration of PHS. The club kicked off the year with a scavanger hunt so that all members (new and old) could get to know each other better. The club was in charge of concessions during semester exams and also helped a great deal in assisting with the orien- tation for the rising 7th graders of PJHS. The club also helped charter a Junior High Student Council as well as sponsored the annual Varsity Dance.

First the dress must be selected and bought, the mx has to be found and matched, flowers and boutonniere have to be coordi- nated with everything else, dinner reservations must be made, and transportation has to be worked out. All in all. Prom is a most exciting and stressful time. Prom was held this year at the Mark II on May 3rd. As always, presentation of the court was the main event of the evening. Jay Evangelista was honored by being crowned King and Anna Pinson was crowned Queen. The evening's theme was \"We've Got Tonight\" from the Bob Seger song of the same title. Prom was an extremely enjoyable and fun-filled event. Queen Anna Pinson is all smiles after her royal crowning.

The boys struggled but worked hard to advance to the District Tournament where they once again conquered the Pike County Central Hawks. The Panthers then returned to the Regional Tournament where they were met by Magoffin County for the second year in a row. The game was action packed, and the two teams again gave each other a run for their money. Although the final score saw Pikeville fall to the Hornets 86-84, there is always next year.

Her diligence and patience paid off, as most of her cheerleaders participated on the Competition Squad made up of seventh graders through sopho- mores who competed in elite competitions. Mrs. Wheeler dedicated many strenuous hours to as- sure that these girls would live up to their poten- tials. Many years a veteran, Mrs. Wheeler is well aware of the demanding expectations of Varsity cheerleadering. Phoenix Contracting Corp. Sports ^81 stealing Our Hearts The bus was filled with bowed heads and glassy eyes as the Senior baseball players departed Johnson Central in what was their final opportunity to wear PHS uniforms. They played their hearts out, only to lose the Regional Champi- onship to a tougher team, the Johnson Central Eagles, who soared above the team with a 6-1 win. Despite this final loss, though, the Baseball Team started this season with exceptional and demol- ishing victories. In the first round of the District Tournament, the Panthers faced their biggest rival, the Pike Central Hawks. The Panthers hunted down the Hawks, resulting in a 17-1 win. Next they faced the Shelby Valley Wildcats in the Dis- trict Championship. The Panthers were once again on the prowl as they took District with a win of 7-4. The team's success came upon the shoulders of Josh Barone, who broke the school records for RBI's, On Base Percentage, and Batting Average. He also lead the team in pitching wins and the state in doubles. The 1996 baseball season concluded with the Panther loss to Johnson Cen- tral in the Regional Championship. The final record of 20-1 1 goes down in the history books. m The members of the High School Baseball Team include (row I ) Jonathan Chapman. Derek Vliegenthart. Casey Deskins. Josh Lynch. Ben Howard.

Honor has been the reward for what he gave.\" -Calvin Coolidge On The Way to the Top The PHS Girls' Softball Team has once again had another outstanding season of pitches -n- plays under the coaching of Jon Stratton. The girls dominated the district and region by winning almost every game by a margin of ten points. This was very impressive considering that the team had to adjust from slow pitch to fast pitch ball which made the game more challenging. Their team's only loss was the first game of the season when they played Jenkins and lost with a score of 8-7. When they met Jenkins for the second time, it was a different story. The girls had practiced hard to develop into a strong team. They showed this spirit in the District and Regional tournament wins over challenging competition. Their Regional tournament victories led them straight to the State Cham- pionship once again. At State the Softball Team made it to the second game of the series but were defeated by Clark County (14-2). The Softball Team has set a bench- mark that can only be exceeded by maintaining the same standard of play next year. Pikeville High School Boosters spons Girls Sock it to 'em at State The Softball Team advanced to the State Championship Softball Tournament for the second year in a row. The girls ended their season with a 27-7 record which was in- deed very impressive considering that this was their first year competing on a fast pitch Softball tournament level. The girls went to state and reached as far as the second game where they were defeated by Clark County. The girls still retained their spirit and pro- ceeded to enjoy themselves at the Kentucky Kingdom Amusment Park. Sports Pikevllle Ready Mix Inc. Thin is tennis. Rosa So. not ballet class!
