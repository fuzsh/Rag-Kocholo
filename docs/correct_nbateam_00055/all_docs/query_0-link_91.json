        "text": "The NBA has seen many hotheads play over the years. With rules getting tighter, this has gone down now. Back in the day, Steve Blake was one of the players you didn’t want to mess with. Three-time All-Star Gilbert Arenas recently spoke about his run-in with Blake back from when they were teammates for the Washington Wizards.\n\n“During practice, I elbowed Steve Blake and he swung at me. I was like, ‘Damn, wait hold on.’ Oh, really? Did the white boy just throw a punch at me? Is that how we’re working here, right?” Arenas said on the No Chill Gil Podcast.\n\nALSO READ – “Everybody Else is Dead Meat”- NBA Great Gilbert Arenas Explains Why Blake Griffin “Needed” Chris Paul at LA Clippers\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWashington Wizards’ Arenas left surprised post the fight\n\nThat one swing led to a full-fledged fight. Arenas wasn’t going to back down without a fight. But after it was over, Blake pretended like the fight never happened.\n\n“We’re going through it, like wrestling on the floor,” Arenas said. “Practiced ended. He’s like, ‘Hey, man, y’all want to go to Legal Seafood?’ “What are you talking to me like that for? Don’t be talking to me like that. He was like, ‘Let’s go to Legal Seafood, food on me; let’s go through these plays.’ …. It’s just off the court this is him. On the court, he’s a whole different person. Then, we go to Legal Food and talk about plays. We didn’t even talk about him throwing a punch at me and we over here fighting in the corner.”\n\nSteve Blake: Most fearless player on the court\n\nBlake wasn’t afraid to pick a fight with anyone in the league. Once during a Blazers vs Nuggets game, he got pushed by Kenneth Faried. Despite being almost five inches shorter, he didn’t back down and shoved Faried to the ground. It would have escalated further had officials and teammates not stepped in.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nBlake also had another infamous run-in with Dwight Howard. During a Magic vs Blazers game, Howard set a screen against Blake and then tried to charge to the paint for the roll. Blake tried to stop Howard’s run, but the three-time DPOY was just too strong and almost dragged Blake with him. Annoyed, Blake tried to pick a fight, but Howard didn’t want to engage in anything unnecessary.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nBlake retired in 2016, after spending 13 years in the league. He had stints with eight different teams but never found success with any."
