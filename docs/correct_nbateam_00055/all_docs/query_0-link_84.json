        "text": "The NBA Rumors keep flowing as teams in the Association try to figure out their 2023-24 roster. I will examine some of the top happenings in the past 24 hours. This includes news regarding the Washington Wizards, New York Knicks, Blake Griffin, plus more.\n\nNBA Rumors: Washington Wizards, New York Knicks and Blake Griffin\n\nWashington Wizards Release Quenton Jackson, Agrees To 2-way Deal With Jared Butler\n\nThe Washington Wizards released Quenton Jackson from his two-way contract on Monday. Jackson, who went undrafted out of Texas A&M in 2022, attended training camp with the Wizards last season and would later earn a two-way contract with the team. The 24-year-old point guard spent the season with the G-League Capital City Go-Go but did appear in nine contests with the Wizards. Jackson averaged 6.4 points on 45.2% shooting and had a 15-to-4 assists-to-turnover ratio in 15 minutes with the Wiz.\n\nJackson played with the Wizards this summer and struggled in Las Vegas. He averaged 6.8 points and 4.0 rebounds while compiling 19 assists compared to nine turnovers. He also produced a shooting slash line of .360/.240/.882.\n\nBefore announcing Jackson’s departure, Jared Butler agreed to a two-way contract with Washington, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nA former second-round pick of the New Orleans Pelicans, Butler has appeared in 46 career NBA games with the Utah Jazz and Oklahoma City Thunder over the last two seasons. The 23-year-old combo guard averaged 6.2 points on 46.9% shooting from the field and 50% from the 3-point line in six games for the Thunder in 2022-23.\n\nButler played well in the G-League this past season and had an excellent summer session for the Thunder. Butler compiled 16.3 points, 4.1 assists, and 1.57 steals in 23 minutes over seven appearances in Vegas and Salt Lake City. He canned 2.7 treys a game while shooting 47.1% from the field and 44,2% from the 3-point line.\n\nThe Wizards now have two of their three two-way spots accounted for. Eugene Omoryui already held one of the spots.\n\nKnicks Sign Dylan Windler To Tw0-Way Deal, Cut Duane Washington\n\nThe New York Knicks and unrestricted free agent Dylan Windler have agreed to a two-way deal today, per Wojnarowski.\n\nWindler, a former first-round draft pick of the Cleveland Cavaliers, appeared in 84 contests for the Cavaliers across three seasons. However, the 26-year-old wing only played in three games with the big league club this past season.\n\nWindler is very athletic, versatile, and good on the defensive end. This year, he had a nice 11-game stretch with the G-League Cleveland Charge, averaging 12.2 points and 5.9 rebounds on .523/.407/.632 shooting.\n\nIn a subsequent move, the Knicks cut ties with Duane Washington Jr. after he picked up his qualifying offer.\n\nAccording to The Athletic’s Fred Katz, New York now has another decision forthcoming, as the Knicks currently have four players on two-way deals.\n\nKatz followed that tweet up with another tweet a few hours later that the Knicks planned on waiving Trevor Keels.\n\nWashington is an offensive-minded combo guard who can shoot it from deep though shot selection is an issue for him. Washington is also a liability on the defensive end. He has appeared in 78 career NBA contests, averaging 9.7 points on .391/.371/.729 shooting.\n\nKeels recently signed his second two-way contract with the Knicks. The No. 42 2022 draft pick averaged 13.9 points on .425/.355/.710 shooting in 25 games for the Westchester Knicks last season. He also notched 3.4 assists, 2.8 rebounds, and 1.0 steals. However, the 19-year-old guard averaged just 3.5 minutes in three 2K24 Las Vegas summer league appearances. New York still holds Keels G-League rights.\n\nWindler, Nathan Knight, and Jaylen Martin are the three players holding two-way deals with the Knicks.\n\nEvan Fournier Could Be Bought Out Of Contract, If Not Traded\n\nIt is well known that Evan Fournier likely played his last game for the New York Knicks last season. The Knicks have been seeking a trade partner for the 31-year-old wing but to no avail. While they will keep trying, Steve Popper of Newsday suggests that Fournier could be bought out if the Knicks can’t find a taker.\n\nFournier struggled in his 27 appearances for New York last season, producing 6.1 points while shooting 33.7% from the field and 30.7% from the 3-point line. While it was obvious Fournier struggled offensively, Tom Thibodeau benched him because of his lack of defense.\n\nHowever, Fournier still has value in this league due to his 3-point marksmanship and play-making. He will make $18.8 million this upcoming season though he is essentially an expiring deal as he has a team option ($19 million) for 2024-25.\n\nBoston Celtics Could Bring Back Blake Griffin\n\nGriffin is one of the top remaining free agents available. While there is a chance that Griffin returns to Boston, Brian Trobb of Mass Live said that the Celtics’ president of basketball operations Brad Stevens had made no mention of Griffin in any of his press conferences meaning that the C’s could be moving on.\n\nGriffin has gone from a superstar to an occasional role player. But the 34-year-old big man has done an excellent job in that role, especially as a leader in the locker room. He has produced his two worst seasons statistically in the last two years. Griffin tallied 4.3 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 1.5 assists in 13.8 minutes over 41 appearances in 2022-23. However, Griffin was a much bigger contributor and way more efficient in the 16 contests he was in the starting lineup.\n\nBoston has 14 players on standard contracts for the upcoming campaign. Although Justin Champagnie’s deal is nonguaranteed, only $200,000 of Dalano Banton’s $2.0 million contract is guaranteed. Both players partook in summer league action with the Celtics. Champagnie had his moments but struggled with his shot and turnovers. Likewise, Banton scored the ball well though he had shooting and turnovers issues as well.\n\nThe Celtics could use some frontcourt help. Mostly at power forward, as the center position is pretty well accounted for.\n\nRomeo Langford Likely To Get Training Camp Invite\n\nRomeo Langford is an unrestricted free agent. The 23-year-old guard is a scorer and can defend decently well though he hasn’t done much of that in San Antonio. He doesn’t shoot it well from the 3-point line. Still, Trobb believes that Langford will get a training camp invite though he doesn’t think it will be with Boston.\n\nLangford appeared in 43 games for the Spurs, including 21 starts, averaging 6.9 points on a career-best 46.7% shooting percentage in 2022-23. He scored in double-figures 12 times, including a season-high 23 against New York at the end of December. Langford was much more productive as a starter than a reserve."
