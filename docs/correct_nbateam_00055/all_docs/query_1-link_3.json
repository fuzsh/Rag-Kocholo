        "text": "NBA at 50:\n\n50 Greatest Players | Top 10 Teams | Top 10 Coaches\n\nOne hundred and seven NBA championship rings. More than 400 hundred NBA All-Star Game selections. Nearly one million points scored.\n\nSo boasts the collective resume of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History, selected by a blue-ribbon panel of media, former players and coaches, current and former general managers and team executives. NBA Commissioner David Stern announced the 50 Greatest Players at a press luncheon on Oct. 29, 1996, in New York City.\n\nJoining Stern in the unveiling of the 50 Greatest Players, which tipped off the League’s season-long NBA at 50 celebration, were four prominent members of the list — Wilt Chamberlain, Julius “Dr. J” Erving, George Mikan and Bill Russell.\n\nThe announcement was made at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, which occupies the site of the former Commodore Hotel, where the original NBA charter was signed on June 6, 1946.\n\nPanelists were asked to select the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History, without regard to position. Voters did not rank their selections and former players were not allowed to vote for themselves.\n\nAt the start of the 1996-97 season the 50 players had accumulated 107 NBA Championships, 49 Most Valuable Player Awards, 17 Rookie of the Year honors, 447 All-Star Game selections, 36 scoring titles, 923,791 total points and 410,327 total rebounds.\n\n50 Greatest Players in NBA History\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar\n\nNate Archibald\n\nPaul Arizin\n\nCharles Barkley\n\nRick Barry\n\nElgin Baylor\n\nDave Bing\n\nLarry Bird\n\nWilt Chamberlain\n\nBob Cousy\n\nDave Cowens\n\nBilly Cunningham\n\nDave DeBusschere\n\nClyde Drexler\n\nJulius Erving\n\nPatrick Ewing\n\nWalt Frazier\n\nGeorge Gervin\n\nHal Greer\n\nJohn Havlicek\n\nElvin Hayes\n\nMagic Johnson\n\nSam Jones\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nJerry Lucas\n\nKarl Malone\n\nMoses Malone\n\nPete Maravich\n\nKevin McHale\n\nGeorge Mikan\n\nEarl Monroe\n\nHakeem Olajuwon\n\nShaquille O’Neal\n\nRobert Parish\n\nBob Pettit\n\nScottie Pippen\n\nWillis Reed\n\nOscar Robertson\n\nDavid Robinson\n\nBill Russell\n\nDolph Schayes\n\nBill Sharman\n\nJohn Stockton\n\nIsiah Thomas\n\nNate Thurmond\n\nWes Unseld\n\nBill Walton\n\nJerry West\n\nLenny Wilkens\n\nJames Worthy\n\n* * *"
