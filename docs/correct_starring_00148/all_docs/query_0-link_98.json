But now, it looks like he’s trying to make a comeback. He starred in the 2023 French film, Jeanne du Barry.\n\nAs for where he lives, he opted to settle down in a quiet county of Somerset in the U.K. Some evidence in 2022 supported that he was pursuing a romantic relationship with one of his lawyers, Joelle Rich.\n\nWhere is Winona Ryder now?
