        "text": "Happy (belated) birthday, Edward!\n\nEnchanting, poetic, plenty of grace. Touching. Edward Scissorhands is this and much more.\n\nDecember 7 of 25 years ago the premiere for this movie that would have been classified after a while like one of the most impressive classics of the American cinema.\n\nThe first collaboration of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.\n\nEdward, a personal idea and inspiration of a teenager called.. Tim Burton.\n\nA gothic movie, not too many dialogues, Edward was a creature invented by an old inventor, but the poor man died before to complete him and so Edward plenty of grace and touched by a lot of kindness remained in a sort of real cage: his hands not real hands, but scissors, able to cut, able to hurt other people like also, accidentally, himself.\n\nThe world different from Edward.\n\nThe differences with the other ones, common mortals, to him reason for a profound melancholy and at the same time the desire of being appreciated for who he was.\n\nOne of the most wonderful. beautiful and poetic role portrayed by Johnny Depp.\n\nMelancholic Edward, his destiny signed by these scissors, the desire of being someone else and not just a weird creature contributed to create a myth and the movie became a legend.\n\nThe thematic, the one of a person not understood well in the society, convinced the team of creatives involved in the project of Edward Scissorhands at designing the neighborhood, cars and all the rest as seeing through Edward’s eyes.\n\nAnna Maria Polidori\n\nThe picture of Johnny’s transformation in Edward Scissorhands\n\nTim Burton is a genial director and one of his most wonderful, poetic, romantic masterpieces is undoubtedly Edward Scissorhands , his first collaboration of a long serie with Johnny Depp as well.\n\nThe story of Edward was born when Tim, an avid reader and creator of stories was still a child.\n\nThis one is a romantic dark fantasy. Edward in fact is a guy of few words. It couldn’t be different being a creation, an invention of a man. Unfortunately…unfinished. What a bad luck. His creator and inventor in fact died for a heart attack before to adding at the place of these two scissors as hands, real hands, able to hugging, shaking hands, working, loving other people. The role of the inventor is portrayed by Vincent Price.\n\nThese scissors as hands are for Edward a sort of real wall and barrier with the other common people and it is a cause for tender Edward of great sufferance.\n\nImpossible to hugging someone if not prudently or interacting with other human being normally. To Edward his condition was exceptionally sad. Taken in by a suburban family he falls in love for Kim the daughter of this couple. It’s a very articulated, wonderful and poetic love story as all the gothic love stories by Tim Burton are.\n\nOther actors apart Johnny Depp: Winona Ryder, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, Vincent Price, Alan Arkin.\n\nThis film received numerous nominations at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, Saturn Awards. He won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Tim Burton have always considered this work his most personal work like also Johnny Depp. Johnny decided of joining Burton in this project immediately after he had read the script because he felt this story very deeply –\n\nThis one is a picture of the transformation of Johnny Depp in Edward.\n\nIf you look t this pic, there is all the disarming expression of poor Edward, a victim of the situation but at the same time the most innocent creature you could meet along your way.\n\nAnna Maria Polidori"
