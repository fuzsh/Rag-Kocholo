        "text": "After the film has been watched, engage the class in a discussion about the movie.\n\n1. In its effort to ridicule conformity, the film stereotypes 1950s culture. What examples of stereotyping do you see in this film?\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nStereotypes in this film include: interior and exterior decorating, clothing, suburban experiences such as barbecues and card games on Friday nights for men; the vacuous lives of both men and women; attitudes of intolerance; hypocrisy; the sexually frustrated housewife, bullies, and door-to-door saleswomen. Peg is stereotyped as a static and unflappable character.\n\n2. Give examples of irony in this film that illuminate meaning and also entertain.\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nExamples are: (1) On the talk show, it is mentioned that without scissors for hands, Edward would not be special. It is ironic that this special quality is the source of his loneliness and pain. (2) After the break-in attempt, a policeman asks the doctor who had apparently evaluated Edward’s mental state about Edward’s condition. The doctor says that Edward has been suffering from years of isolation. He cannot tell right from wrong. He has underdeveloped awareness of reality. When asked whether Edward will be OK out in the world, the doctor responds, “Oh yeah, he’ll be fine.” This suggests that society itself is so disturbed that the negative traits mentioned are not seen as handicaps. (3) When Edward rushes to save Kevin, it is ironic that he hurts the boy and is seen as dangerous rather than helpful. (4) It is ironic that Edward is both drawn into the community for his unique qualities and later rejected by it, ostensibly for those same unique qualities. However, in reality, Edward is rejected because he refuses to allow some townspeople to use him for their own purposes and for other selfish reasons; (5) It is ironic that the only signs of nature in town are either topiary or plastic Christmas trees and these are not natural at all. Edward, the concoction of a scientist, has more human emotions and is more like a caring human being, than the people in the community.\n\n3. What humorous elements in the film serve to point out something important?\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nThere are many answers to this question. When the police confront Edward they tell him to drop his weapons. His scissors serve as his hands; they are not weapons and cannot be dropped. The police then say, “Cuff him,” another reference to his hands. These lines show the inability of the police to actually see what is before them just as the townspeople have been unable to see the real Edward. Bursting the waterbed and trying to eat at the dinner table are but two of several examples of humorous situations based on Edward’s struggle to fit into the social structure. They point to the absurdity of trying to fit in. It’s funny when Edward sits on the curb and is joined by a dog with hair in its eyes. As upset as Edward has been and as decorative as he has been in the use of his dog-hair trimming skills, he neatly snips the hair so that the dog can see. It shows that Edward understands what is important.\n\n4. What happened to cause the community to turn on Edward?\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nIt wasn’t just one thing, but several. Each of the main characters who turned on Edward did so due to their own character flaws such as pride, paranoia, jealousy, or venality. Any description that shows some of these traits is a good response.\n\n5. Some argue that the 1950’s style in terms of neighborhoods, interior decorating, and fashion is being held up to ridicule in this film. Argue for or against this assertion.\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nAll opinions, backed up by references to details in the film, are acceptable.\n\n6. What images of conformity are shown in the opening 15 minutes of the film?\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nThe tract houses are painted in pastels. The cars that flow from the driveways at the same time in the morning are painted in similar tones. The clothing worn by most of the characters is similar in style and color. The landscaping styles are the same early in the film, and after Edward begins to trim the shrubs, the entire neighborhood sports similar sculptured bushes.\n\n7. What is subjected to stereotyping in this film?\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nStereotypes in this film include: suburban experiences such as barbecues and card games on Friday nights for men; the vacuous lives of both men and women; attitudes of intolerance; hypocrisy; and trite characters such as the sexually frustrated housewife, bullies, and door-to-door saleswomen.\n\n8. Can you find an example of an anachronism in this movie, something that would not be a part of the l950s yet appears in the film?\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nAnachronisms include: references to Velcro; VCRs; message machines; talk shows; waterbeds; microwaves; big screen TVs; and aerobics classes.\n\n9. Peg seems to be a completely static character who responds on one affective level to all events. Do you agree or disagree?\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nThere are several examples of Peg’s unflappability. Each shows an unwillingness to challenge the expectation that women will behave themselves and follow the social rules. Peg, as a stereotypical fifties housewife, approaches the ominous appearing castle with the same comportment seen when she knocks on the doors of her neighbors. She is following the Avon method of selling products. When she decides to move Edward into her home, she does it with the same matter-of-fact approach that she has consistently shown. When the dangers that Edward presents become known to her, she says she didn’t think about what would happen were she to bring Edward home. Thinking was not a popular art in the lives of 1950’s suburban women.\n\n10. Door-to-door sales, done by companies such as Avon and Fuller Brush, were common in the 1950s. Speculate as to why they may have been profitable back then but are profitable no longer.\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nCar culture has made suburban isolation a thing of the past. Malls and huge shopping complexes were developed in suburban communities where one-stop shopping offered consumers anything they could possibly want. Recently, more variety and better prices have become available on the Internet.\n\n11. What is the role played by gossip in this movie?\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nGossip establishes the stereotypical character of women in housing tracts. They have nothing more interesting in their lives than the business of others. It is also used as a means of communicating, spreading the word about Edward and fomenting fear.\n\n12. Which of the shapes Edward sculpts from the plants seem to have meaning?\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nResponses will vary. At the castle Edward had sculpted a huge, open-palmed hand. He sculpted a dinosaur family and later Peg points out how he had created an image of her family in his topiary. Hands and families show what is missing in Edward’s life.\n\n13. What is the most important revelation to come from Edward’s appearance on the talk show?\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nAnswers will vary. Edward says that friends are the most important part of his new life in the suburbs. When one audience participant comments that if he had regular hands, he wouldn’t be special, Peg says that he will always be special.\n\n14. Betrayal plays an important part in the film. How is Edward betrayed?\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nJim, who should be a friend, manipulates Edward into breaking into his father’s room to steal money. Kim, who should be loyal to Edward, does not prevent this episode from occuring. Joyce claims that Edward assaulted her when Edward does not play along with her sexual games. When Edward tells the Boggs family about the encounter with Joyce, he is ignored.\n\n15. Edward grows hostile after he is accused of hurting Kim. What does he do to ventilate his feelings?\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nEdward cuts off his clothing, slashes wall paper and towels, and later slashes tires and cuts limbs off of the plants he had sculpted.\n\n16. Where in the film is innocence shown?\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nEdward is innocent in virtually every act because his intentions and his actions are in sync. He has no ulterior motives and is not trying to exploit his presence in the community. Peg innocently wants Edward to move into her home. She feels compassion and has no desire to exploit Edward or his talents. Kim responds to Edward innocently as does her little brother Kevin who takes Edward to show-and-tell, where all of the children enjoy Edward and are not interested in exploiting him.\n\n17. How does the conformist mentality of the characters create a mob?\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nAt the end of the film, after Kim has told Edward to run and Jim has threatened violence, a combination of fear and curiosity drive the townspeople to follow Edward into the castle despite the fact that the policeman told them that the show was over and they should go home. Led into the castle grounds by Joyce, the mob sees Jim’s body, which is of little interest, and leaves as soon as Kim shows them a scissorhand device that she found in the inventor’s workroom. She claims the hand is Edward’s and tells them that Jim and Edward killed one another. With the conflict over, the neighbors go home.\n\nRationale:\n\nEdward Scissorhands provides an opportunity to review literary devices which have been taught in prior lessons and to exercise writing skills, using a popular movie. In the alternative, teachers can edit the materials to focus on teaching about a few literary devices and show how they are used in a story told by a popular film.\n\nObjectives/Student Outcomes:\n\nStudents will review and confirm existing knowledge concerning literary devices, exercise critical thinking, and practice writing expository paragraphs. In the alternative, teachers can edit the materials, so that students will learn about a few literary devices, see their use in a story and in a movie, and practice their writing skills.\n\nListing Literary Devices Used in the Story – Student Handout\n\nDelete any literary devices which are not appropriate for the class watching the film. Teachers should feel free to substitute definitions that they prefer or which are used in their curriculum materials.

Be sure to include the ending.\n\nStudents can be asked to submit examples or illustrations of the literary terms that are listed in the student handout. The following provides suggested responses:\n\n1. Allegory:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nIn allegorical terms: Edward stands for innocent person, different from everyone else, living in isolation and loneliness, who tried to make a connection with others and live in society. The suburb is the world/society. The people in the suburbs are the people in the world.\n\n2. Anachronism:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nReferences are made throughout the film to waterbeds, Velcro, aerobics classes, VCRs, microwaves, message machines, and other objects which were not a part of consumer culture in the 1950’s.\n\n3. Antagonist:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nJim serves as the primary antagonist because he stands in for the community when Edward is being pushed back into isolation. However, the real antagonist is the small-minded selfishness and conformity of the community.\n\n4. Complication:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nNew difficulties arise for Edward when he rejects Joyce, helps Jim with the break-in, and accidentally cuts Kevin in a rescue attempt. These are all complications.\n\n5. Denouement:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nThe film’s conflict is resolved when Jim is killed and Kim reports that Edward is dead as well. The neighbors go home and the framework narrative returns to the old woman telling the story at bedtime. The scene with the old woman is a denouement.\n\n6. Empathic Reaction:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nViewers empathize with many things, including Edward’s feelings as an outsider, Peg’s desire to nurture him, Kim’s compassion, and the curiosity experienced by the neighborhood women.\n\n7. Expository phase:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nThe setting is established with views of the tract housing and the castle. The time period is established through the use of l950 images in setting and fashion. Peg and Edward are introduced through Peg’s desire to sell her products. The problem is established as soon as Edward moves into Peg’s home and now must assimilate into the family and the community.\n\n8. Fantasy:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nThe castle and Edward himself are a manifestation of fantasy; they do not exist in reality.\n\n9. Flashback:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nThree times in the film Edward is drawn back to the time he lived with his inventor. We see him learning lessons, hearing poetry, and receiving hands just prior to the death of the inventor.\n\n10. Framework Narrative:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nAn old woman revealed at the end to be Kim, opens and closes the tale of Edward Scissorhands in a bedroom where she is telling the story to a child at nighttime.\n\n11. Hyperbole:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nThis is a term in literature that can be seen in film through exaggerated visuals. The exaggeration shows up most vividly in the looks, clothing, and behavior of Joyce.\n\n12. Imagery:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nThere are striking visual images throughout the film including the castle, the architecture of the neighborhood, and the topiary statues created by Edward. The visual that most provokes sensory response in the viewers is the ice sculpture and the snowfall that results from Edward’s work on the art piece.\n\n13. Irony:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nExamples are: (1) On the talk show, it is mentioned that without scissors for hands, Edward would not be special. It is ironic that this special quality is the source of his loneliness and pain. (2) After the break-in attempt, a policeman asks the doctor who had apparently evaluated Edward’s mental state about Edward’s condition. The doctor says that Edward has been suffering from years of isolation. He cannot tell right from wrong. He has underdeveloped awareness of reality. When asked whether Edward will be OK out in the world, the doctor responds, “Oh yeah, he’ll be fine.” This suggests that society itself is so disturbed that the negative traits mentioned are not seen as handicaps. (3) When Edward rushes to save Kevin, it is ironic that he hurts the boy and is seen as dangerous rather than helpful. (4) It is ironic that Edward is both drawn into the community for his unique qualities and later rejected by it for those same unique qualities. (5) It is ironic that the only signs of nature in town are either topiary or plastic Christmas trees. Edward, the concoction of a scientist, seems more natural than both the plant life and the people in the community.\n\n14. Lampoon:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nMany things are lampooned in this film. Perhaps the chief victim is the mentality of 1950s housewives.\n\n15. Metaphor:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nEdward himself is a metaphor; he can be compared to an outsider, a fringe member of society who suffers from an inability to fit in. The people of the housing tract can be seen as a metaphor for a conformist society.\n\n16. Moral:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nIndividuals with unique characteristics should be accepted into the community rather than feared and exploited.\n\n17. Motif:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nTopiary is a motif that suggests artificiality. It also suggests that beauty can be created by someone laboring under difficult handicaps and that beauty is different from the conformist uniformity of the suburb.\n\n18. Pathos:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nEdward’s sadness, shown through facial expression, engenders pity.\n\n19. Plot Line:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nAn outcast tries to become a part of a community which, responding to fear and jealousy, rejects him and forces him back into isolation.\n\n20. Point of view.\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nThe film uses an omniscient point of view,\n\n21. Protagonist:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nEdward is the character about whom the audience is concerned. He struggles against the small-minded selfishness and conformity of the community.\n\n22. Symbol:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nThe ice sculpture and the snow that flows from it is a symbol for purity.\n\n23. Theme:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nThe central meaning of the film is that conformity destroys individuality and the capacity to behave in truly human ways.\n\n24. Tone:\n\nSuggested Response:\n\nThe mood of the play is dark, with comic relief.\n\nSee Additional Assignments for use with any Film that is a Work of Fiction."
