It was produced by Burton and Denise Di Novi, written by Caroline Thompson from a story by her and Burton, and starring Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Anthony Michael Hall, Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker, Alan Arkin, and Vincent Price. It tells the story of an unfinished artificial humanoid who has scissor blades instead of hands that is taken in by a suburban family and falls in love with their teenage daughter.\n\nRussian Ballet Orlando presents its 22nd season of The Nutcracker and will showcase 150 company dancers performing with live music provided by the Orlando Symphony Orchestra. This timeless tradition will bring excitement, beauty and joy this Holiday Season for the entire family. The story of The Nutcracker is based on the E.T.A. Hoffman fantasy The Nutcracker and the Mouse King. More than any other ballet, The Nutcracker is about the magic of childhood. A girl named Clara received a Nutcracker doll for Christmas that comes to life at midnight and wages a battle against the evil Mouse King.\n\nPurchase Tickets at polktheatre.org\".",
