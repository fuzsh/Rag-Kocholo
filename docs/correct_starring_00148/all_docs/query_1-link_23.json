        "text": "Imagine your first time onscreen was playing the wife of one of the most famous American men ever in a film that won 4 oscars. It's a hell of an act to follow and while Kathy Baker's career never fully took off after that debut 37 years ago she's done some very memorable work since and is a face you'll always appreciate seeing in a film or a show because you know you're in the presence of a great actor.\n\nShe's been the twist in the tale of one of the 90's most underrated psychodramas and been defended by the wimpiest lawyer in Boston. Turned up in an Amazing Story by Steven Spielberg and played 3 (3!) different people in the Law And Order Franchise. She seduced the weirdest boy in a town created by Tim Burton and had her vocal chords ruined by the most evil character Ray Winstone's ever played. Been a mammy to Joaquin Phoenix and Billy Crudup and faced off against a priest with a bazooka. Played a nurse in a film so controversial in Ireland that it received an 18 certificate while in England it was only a 12 cert. Been the object of a broken Vietnam veteran's affection and been a deputy to Jesse Stone's Sheriff, on many occasions. She's won Golden Globes, Emmy's and Screen Actors Guild awards, starred in dreadful DREADFUL TV Movies and some of the best films of the last 4 decades. Not many people would have a CV that includes a role in Touched By An Angel and a role where Morgan Freeman was your pimp while you romanced Superman. You can't beat a bit of variety in a filmography. Check it out here\n\nGreatest Hits\n\nThe Right Stuff - Louise Shepherd, the woman behind the first American in space. A small role but an important one.\n\nClean And Sober - Charley, the lone woman in the addiction group the film is set in. In her words \"The token cunt.\". A blistering part, full of rage and pain.\n\nEdward Scissorhands - Joyce. Loves a haircut and loves the men cutting. An absolute sleaze and great at it.\n\nJennifer 9 - Margie Ross. One of the main characters in this sadly forgotten but excellent film from that excellent early 90's run of psychological thrillers. To say more would be a spoiler.\n\nCold Mountain - Sally Swanger. A lovely supporting character in, for my money, one of the best films of the century so far. Gets treated so badly that your blood will boil watching it.\n\nPrevious Heroes\n\nTess Harper"
