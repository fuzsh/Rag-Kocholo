        "text": "Edward Scissorhands This was made in 1990 at California it costed $4milion dollars to produce the film. This film is directed by Tim Burton it is PG13 so you all have to get permission to watch it if you are under 13. The story was made by Caroline Thompson. This film durates around about 1h and 50 minutes. The film contains loads of funny bits but even bad bits too because there are fightings and slang languages . The main casts are: • Johnny Depp ... Edward Scissorhands • Winona Ryder ... Kim • Dianne Wiest ... Peg • Anthony Michael Hall ... Jim • Kathy Baker ... Joyce Synopsis Basically the scientist (Vincent Price) builds an animated human being and he called it Edward Scissorhands,he was called Sciscorhands because rather than having hands he had scissors.A guman real being founded him and she took her to her house,all the people were curious about it because they were thinking that something creep was going on.So all the womens of the town went to the house and knocked on their door and the owner responded the door and they were all saying you got a guest on your house why don’t you make a big party,by not having any chance to answer the question the lady,who kocked the door said That’s okay then. So the owner of the house said to Edward there will be no worries and you will be absolutely fine. The day came and the people reviewed him good they said he was a nice person but he saw a girl thath h liked her but another old women wanted to do sometging nasty that you shouldn’t watch but they don’t do that they just pretend but Edward ignores them .The people were treating him badly and the girl that he liked had a boyfriend which was his enemy,once it was christamas and he… I am not gonna spoil it you will watch the film! Some quotes: Kim Boggs: Hold me Kim Boggs: Hold me. Edward Scissorhands: I can't. Edward Scissorhands: \"I am not complete.\" Edward Scissorhands: I am not complete. Bill Boggs: Okay, everyone! Soup's on! Edward Scissorhands: *through mouth full of food* I shought it wash shish-cabob. Bill Boggs: What? Edward Scissorhands: I shought it wash shish-cabob. Bill Boggs: It's a figure of speach. You need to learn not to take things so seriously. Edward Scissorhands: I am not complete. Edward Scissorhands: Goodbye. Kim Boggs: I Love you. Kim Boggs: Hold me. Edward Scissorhands: I can't... Peg Boggs: The light concealing cream goes on first. Then you blend, and blend, and blend. Blending is the secret. Bill Boggs: Soups on! Edward Scissorhands: I thought this was shishkabob Edward Scissorhands: I thought this was shish-kabob. Edward Scissorhands: I didn't mean to cut your face. Bill Boggs: So Edward, did you have a productive day? Edward Scissorhands: Mrs. Monroe showed me where the salon's going to be. Edward Scissorhands: [turns to Peg] You could have a cosmetics counter. Peg Boggs: Oh, wouldn't that be great! Bill Boggs: Great. Edward Scissorhands: And then she showed me the back room where she took all of her clothes off. [everyone stares, Kevin snickers] Edward Scissorhands: \"I'm not finished.\" Edward Scissorhands: I'm not finished. Peg Boggs: No matter what, Edward will always be special. Peg Boggs: Never let anyone tell you you're handicapped. You're.... special. Edward Scissorhands: Where is everyone? Kim Boggs: Out looking for you. Hold me. Edward Scissorhands: I can't. Bill Boggs: You can't buy the necessities of life with cookies. Bill Boggs: Sweetheart, you can't buy the necessities of life with cookies. Officer Allen: We're looking for the man with the hands. My review: Overall I liked this film because it had loads of descriptions and the acting were great but there was something wrong with it which was swering it had only 3 words that I can’t remember it but still it was good even though it has a bit rude things but they actually are faking and the good hing is that Edward just ignores them.The bad thing were the graphics I know it was made in19’century but hey could convert the 360p to 480p or 720p at leats. I recommend this film to children over 12 because of the rude things.I rate this 4 stars out of 5 because as you know there were bad episodes so that is my opinion about the film.\n\nPrint this review"
