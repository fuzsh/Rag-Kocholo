        "text": "In a castle high on top of a hill, lives an inventor's greatest creation - Edward, a near-complete person.\n\nDying before he could finish, the inventor leaves Edward with metal scissors for hands. Since then, Edward has lived alone, until a kind lady called Peg discovers him and welcomes him into her home. At first, everyone welcomes him into the community, but soon things begin to take a change for the worse. (Source - IMDB)\n\nFull synopsis - IMDB (contains spoilers)\n\nEdward’s appearance makes it impossible for him to modestly blend in.\n\nAt one point, he wears a baseball cap and button-down shirt to disguise his looks in order to assist in a neighbourhood heist. It only serves to make his otherness stick out even more. Edward is, simply put, strange. Kim’s jock ex-boyfriend Jim even pleads,“He isn’t even human!” when she refuses to terminate their friendship. Everyone can relate mentally to that alienation.\n\nThe secret history of Edward Scissorhands - Trey Taylor (2014)\n\nTrample down the perversion of nature! (Esmeralda)\n\nBut if you had regular hands you'd be like everyone else (audience member)\n\nEver since Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein, we have been fascinated with what makes someone truly human. Without hands, Edward seems sub-human. Yet he is sometimes more human than the characters he meets.\n\nGothic fiction tells us the truth about our divided nature - Guardian article\n\nQuestion to ponder: Who is more creative in the film? Who is more destructive?"
