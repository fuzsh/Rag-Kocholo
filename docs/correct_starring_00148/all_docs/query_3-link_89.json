        "text": "Howdy ladies and gents, with it being the Christmas season and all that I thought I‚Äôd at least watch one film based on the holiday season and today I‚Äôll be talking about Edward Scissorhands. Oh I love this film so much, it is one of my all time favourite films ever. I only saw for the first time in either 2008 or 2009, but ever since it has been one of those films that captured my heart and soul never let go. I‚Äôve been meaning to review this film for a while and since I watched it today I thought now would be great time blog about it. üòÄ\n\nThe story can be described as the following:\n\n‚ÄúIn a castle high on top of a hill lives an inventor‚Äôs greatest creation ‚Äì Edward, a near-complete person. The creator died before he could finish Edward‚Äôs hands; instead, he is left with metal scissors for hands. Since then, he has lived alone, until a kind lady called Peg discovers him and welcomes him into her home. At first, everyone welcomes him into the community, but soon things begin to take a change for the worse.‚Äù\n\nThis film‚Äôs story is so good. The reason I like it is because it covers so much and has many interesting things to say about the way people treat others who are different or how some people are sheep and are quick to change their opinions based on secondhand information when they don‚Äôt have the full story or how not having the right guidance in life can get you in trouble. There is so much more to absorb and the film covers discrimination, influence and manipulation, the power of kindness, and knowing right from wrong as just some of the key subjects. This film is Edward discovering the world beyond the mansion, learning about the world and how the people react to him in positive and negative ways, and how he processes everything. Oh and the humour, my god it is brilliant, whether the jokes are verbal or physical, they work so well thanks to great timing and awkwardness. But beyond that, this tale is one that is so fun, humourous and magical, but it is also heartbreaking, tragic and melancholy too and this film makes feel happy, sad and awkward haha. I just love this world that Burton has created, it‚Äôs so strange and wacky with the setting and characters, yet full of heart and certain levels of realism, and I could just watch a film about the neighbours because they all seem so funny and interesting.\n\nThe cast is brilliant and do great jobs in their roles. Johnny Depp as Edward Scissorhands, bloody hell what a performance. This is my favourite film to watch him in, sure he‚Äôs playing a strange character, but this is one of the most interesting people he‚Äôs ever played. Edward introverted, shy and has known no one and done nothing outside of where he was created, he‚Äôs like a big kid. And he we get to see him grow and discover things for the first time, he enjoys success, failure, love, anger and so much more and it is just a marvel to see Depp handle this material with such charm, awkwardness and style. Winona Ryder as Kim Boggs is also very good, at first she‚Äôs very wants nothing to do with Edward, but as time goes on and certain events take place, she not only sees his value but also learns to care for him and Ryder is sassy and wonderful. Dianne Wiest I also love as Peg Boggs, she‚Äôs the lady that first finds Edward and introduces him to the world and I love how positive, kind and selfless she is. Alan Arkin as Bill Boggs is just great, he‚Äôs a very nice and chilled out kind of guy, but also has words of wisdom and great lines of dialogue too. Anthony Michael Hall ‚Äì Jim, what an asshole, I mean sure he‚Äôs meant to be that way and Hall plays the character very well, but you can see from a mile away that this guy‚Äôs trouble and things only get crazier for him as the film progresses. Kathy Baker gives a very memorable performance as Joyce, this lady is very pretty, but also flirtatious and funny too. And Vincent Price as The Inventor, just wow, his appearance in this just makes me smile, this is a man who creates Edward is so down-to-earth, caring and humourous, but what makes him better is the fact that he‚Äôs played by Price and I just love that man‚Äôs voice.\n\nThe presentation is also very good too. Visually the film has a very interesting look, with great cinematography, lighting and use of colour, oh and the make-up and those scissors hands, damn they‚Äôre cool and so well made. As for the soundtrack it is handled by the brilliant Danny Elfman. From the time the film begins you‚Äôre treated to this beautiful, angelic, harrowing sound that really sets the tone for this film so well. At times the music is soft and playful, but other times it can be odd, aggressive and very saddening, together with the visuals, it amplifies the magic of this film by tenfold. Elfman‚Äôs score is gorgeous providing music that could melt the coldest of hearts and creating some of the most memorable music in film which would be used for all sorts of advertising and trailers for years to come. And in certain keys scenes that music makes me well up every time, this is the kind of stuff that reminds me that I have emotions haha. üòõ\n\nIn conclusion Edward Scissorhands is still a film I treasure and which each viewing I think I love it more and more. Whether it is the great central performance from Johnny Depp, the strange neighbours, imaginative story or lovely soundtrack, this film has something for everyone and while it isn‚Äôt the standard Christmas film, there isn‚Äôt one I like watching more than this one. üôÇ\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nSo have you seen Edward Scissorhands and if so what do you think of it? Please be sure to comment below and I‚Äôll see ya on the next film review, laters! üòÄ"
