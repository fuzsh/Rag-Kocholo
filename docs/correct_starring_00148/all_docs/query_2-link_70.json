        "text": "The dance theatre take on 1990 Tim Burton fairy tale film — in the vein of Bourne's Swan Lake rather than a musical — will hit regional venues in San Francisco, Los Angeles and St. Louis, according to the director-choreographer's website.\n\n\"We've had such a fantastic time with American presenters while we've been here [in London]. A vast majority of presenters have been over and have loved the show,\" Bourne told Playbill.com about the show's Stateside prospects, citing plans are underway. No official dates or venues have yet been announced.\n\nBroadway is not out of the realm of possibility, according to Bourne, though out-of town engagements with a possible stop at the Brooklyn Academy of Music — where his recent Play Without Words performed — are more likely. \"If it goes very well, maybe we will look at doing a longer run on Broadway, if the audiences really take to it.\"\n\nEdward Scissorhands follows the story of a young man (played on film by Johnny Depp) created by an inventor who dies before finishing his work — leaving the man with scissors instead of hands. When a determined Avon lady (Dianne Wiest on film) discovers him in his castle, she attempts to bring him into her home. Before long, the community becomes involved and Edward's hands become more trouble than they are cut out for. Vincent Price, Winona Ryder, Kathy Baker, Anthony Michael Hall and Alan Arkin also starred in the movie.\n\nBourne danced his way into the mindset of theatregoers with his theatrical stagings of Cinderella, The Car Man and Swan Lake — which earned him an Olivier Award and two Tony Awards. Recent credits include choreography on the West End staging of Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady and Play Without Words. The stage Edward Scissorhands stars Bourne vets Richard Winsor and Sam Archer, who will alternate in the title role. Regular Bourne collaborators Scott Ambler and Etta Murfitt will serve as associate directors and co-star. Terry Davies, who worked with Bourne on Play Without Words and The Car Man, composes music adapted from Danny Elfman's haunting film score to the Caroline Thompson screenplay.\n\nThe design team will include Lez Brotherston (set and costumes), Howard Harrison (lighting) and Paul Groothuis (sound)."
