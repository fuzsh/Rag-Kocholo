        "text": "FANS of Edward Scissorhands love putting the movie on over the festive season.\n\nBut the question has often arisen, is the 1990 Tim Burton classic really a Christmas film?\n\nIs Edward Scissorhands a Christmas movie?\n\nDespite the fact that the movie starts off in the summer, it certainly has wintery undertones midway through, and does include Christmas later on.\n\nWho can forget the moment where Edward Scissorhands cuts an angel out of ice?\n\nThe fairy tale aspect of the movie also lends itself to being a festive flick.\n\nIn fact, after much research, all the big movie reviewers believe that Edward Scissorhands should be considered a Christmas film\n\nOne reviewer for Distractify said: \"If 1984's Gremlins and 1988's Die Hard are considered Christmas films, then so is Edward Scissorhands.\n\n\"They're all filed under the 'unconventional' Christmas movie category.\n\n\"Edward Scissorhands' third act sees Peg and Kim prepare for their annual Christmas party.\n\n\"While decorating a glowing white Christmas tree with her mother, Kim peers out the window to see fluffy snow falling from the sky.\n\n\"When the wide-eyed teen scurries outside to get a better look, she realises that the \"snow\" is actually the work of Edward.\"\n\nThey go on: \"As he carves a magnificent angel ice sculpture with his razor-sharp appendages, tiny shards of ice fly through the air, creating a picturesque wintery scene on Kim's front lawn.\n\n\"Mesmerised by its beauty, Kim twirls under the faux snow â€” in slow motion, of course.\"\n\nMeanwhile, regmovies.com says: \"The biggest piece of evidence in support rests with the fact that the last half of the movie is centered around the Christmas season, not to mention that the entire narrative is framed around a grandmother telling her grandchild why it always snows on Christmas.\n\n\"After an annual Christmas party goes awry, we are surrounded by a festive neighborhood with plenty of Christmas lights and decorated trees - even the most melancholy flashback to the saddening death of the Inventor takes place around this same time of year. \"\n\nSo yes, Edward Scissorhands IS a Christmas movie.\n\nWho stars in Edward Scissorhands and what is it about?\n\nA scientist builds an animated human being - the gentle Edward.\n\nThe scientist dies before he can finish assembling Edward, though, leaving the young man with a freakish appearance accentuated by the scissor blades he has instead of hands.\n\nLoving suburban saleswoman Peg discovers Edward and takes him home, where he falls for her daughter, Kim\n\nHowever, despite his kindness and artistic talent, he soon becomes an outcast once more.\n\nThe all-star cast includes:\n\nJohnny Depp as Edward Scissorhands\n\nWinona Ryder as Kim Boggs\n\nAnthony Michael Hall as Jim\n\nDianne Wiest as Peg Boggs\n\nKathy Baker as Joyce Monroe\n\nAlan Arkin as Bill Boggs\n\nVincent Price as The Inventor\n\nHow old was Winona Ryder in Edward Scissorhands?\n\nWinona Ryder was just 18 in Edward Scissorhands when she played the character Kim.\n\nThe young actress must have made an impression on director Tim Burton, as she has since starred in four of his films."
