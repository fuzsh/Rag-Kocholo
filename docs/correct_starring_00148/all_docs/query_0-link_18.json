        "text": "Slated to launch at San Francisco's Orpheum Theatre (Nov. 11-Dec. 10), the work from the Tony Award-winning director-choreographer of Swan Lake comes stateside after a London debut.\n\nThe original London company — which also toured the U.K. and Japan — will return for the U.S. tour. Reprising the title role will be Sam Archer and Richard Winsor at alternating performances. Scott Ambler, Kerry Biggin and Madelaine Brennan are also featured in the cast.\n\nEdward Scissorhands follows the story of a young man (played on film by Johnny Depp) created by an inventor who dies before finishing his work — leaving the man with scissors instead of hands. When a determined Avon lady (Dianne Wiest on film) discovers him in his castle, she attempts to bring him into her home. Before long, the community becomes involved, and Edward's hands become more trouble than they are cut out for. Vincent Price, Winona Ryder, Kathy Baker, Anthony Michael Hall and Alan Arkin also starred in the Tim Burton movie.\n\nBilled as a \"touching and witty gothic fairytale,\" the show hopes to be \"a treat for the whole family.\" Terry Davies, who worked with Bourne on Play Without Words and The Car Man, composed music adapted from Danny Elfman's haunting film score to accompany the Caroline Thompson screenplay.\n\nThe ensemble will also feature Ross Carpenter, Gareth Charlton, Andrew Corbett, Gavin Eden, Adam Galbraith, Sophia Dominique Hurdley, Steve Kirkham, Dena Lague, Rachel Lancaster, James Leece, Matthew Malthouse, Drew McOnie, Michela Meazza, Ebony Molina, Rachel Morrow, Etta Murfitt, Luke Murphy, Gemma Payne, Jake Samuels, Mikah Smillie, Mami Tomotani, Hannah Vassallo, Shaun Walters, Shelby Williams, Philip Willingham and Chloe Wilkinson. The design team will include Lez Brotherston (set and costumes), Howard Harrison (lighting) and Paul Groothuis (sound).\n\nTour dates (subject to change) include:\n\nSan Francisco, CA - Orpheum Theatre (Nov. 11-Dec. 10)\n\nLos Angeles, CA - Ahmanson (Dec. 12-31)\n\nCharlotte, NC - Belk Theater (Jan 4-10, 2007)\n\nPittsburgh, PA - Benedum Center (Jan. 12-14, 2007)\n\nPhiladelphia, PA - Academy of Music (Jan. 16-21, 2007)\n\nWashington, D.C. - Opera House (Feb. 13-18, 2007)\n\nSt. Louis, MO - Fox Theatre (March 6-11, 2007)\n\nNew York, NY - Brooklyn Academy of Music (March 13-31, 2007)\n\nToronto, ON - Hummingbird Centre (April 3-8, 2007)\n\nSt. Paul, MN - Ordway (April 10-15, 2007)\n\nDenver, CO - Buell Theatre (April 17-22, 2007)\n\nSeattle, WA - 5th Avenue (April 25-May 13, 2007) The tour is produced by New Adventures, Martin McCallum and Marc Platt.
