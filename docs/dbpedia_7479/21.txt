Disillusionment In Sun-Drenched 1970s American New Wave Cinema: A Watching Brief

Yep, diving back into this project yet again and seeing if I might actually be able to finish it this year!*

Not the most interesting film to get back into it with though. Paul Newman claimed at one point this was the most significant and the best film he ever made. Well, it perhaps could have been the former (if it was good, which it wasn't) but it absolutely was not the latter.

WUSA is a meandering and ultimately completely aimless social and political drama with two separate story strands that connect together late on but never really feed into each other in a particularly convincing way. Stuart Rosenberg doesn't really ever seem sure what he wants this to be and ultimately fluffs what could have been a fascinating idea, of a left-leaning broadcaster asked to espouse very right-wing views for a living.

It never explores that idea in any great detail, floating ponderously through a tortuous couple of hours of very little of note, with a terrific cast almost all completely wasted. With the exception of an always brilliant Joanne Woodward, whose sterling efforts here are completely and utterly frittered away by Rosenberg.

A truly stupid ending rounds off this notorious flop and it's certainly not a case of mistaken criticism either. WUSA really is as crap as they said it was back in 1970.

* Nope.
