This is an opportunity for people to support vocal music, the greatest of all joys and balms. Dear Jazz Enthusiasts: GIVE BIG is here! Don’t’ delay. It culminates on May 2-3. “GIVE BIG is a statewide fundraising campaign where individuals and organizations come together across Washington to invest in our communities. When we give, we take a proactive step towards creating the society we want to live in.” We hope this message finds you swinging to the vibrant tunes of your favorite jazz artists. As fellow jazz lovers, we understand the power and emotion this extraordinary musical genre holds. Today, we're reaching out to you with a special request to support the Offbeats Jazz Choir, a talented and passionate group of singers dedicated to preserving and promoting the rich legacy of jazz. The Offbeats Jazz Choir has been an integral part of our local music scene for the past 15 years. They have joyfully brought the magic of jazz to our community, performing at myriad events, conducting educational workshops, and collaborating with renowned musicians. Their breathtaking harmonies and soul-stirring performances have captivated audiences and inspired many to embrace the beauty of jazz. Please, help The Offbeats to continue their mission by donating today. Visit the Give Big page at https://lnkd.in/gTmt8e5P. If you wish, choose Offbeats as a dedication option.

Pay attention: The NW Voice Foundation Art and Science of Performance conference is coming up on May 12/13: https://lnkd.in/gRtcziDG. https://lnkd.in/gZwRgszQ for full details. I cannot overstate the utterly wonderful nature of this conference. It is the perfect marriage of art and science, as the title suggests: the speakers are great, the masterclasses are great, the camaraderie is great. Honestly, it is my favourite event of the year - intimate, thought-provoking – time for great discussions, creative ideas and connections. There really is no other conference like it. If it matters to you, I am presenting a talk and short masterclass on gender affirming voice training, but that is not the reason for my message. Come to the conference! Be filled with energy, new ideas, the joy and wonder of the vocal instrument. I guarantee you will not be disappointed! There, I’m done.\n\nI'm thrilled to announce our next and final gender affirming voice training course. We look forward to teaching you one more time in our longstanding iteration.
