        "text": "This richly detailed examination of two forms of American entertainment focuses on the various ways that radio stations and air personalities have been depicted in motion pictures, from 1926’s The Radio Detective to more recent films like 2022’s Halloween Ends. Newly updated and revised chapters cover the cinematic portrayals of various aspects of radio, including disc jockeys, sports broadcasts, religious programs and abnormal personalities on the air.\n\nSuch films as The Big Broadcast (1932), Reveille with Beverly (1943), Mister Rock and Roll (1957), WUSA (1970), Radio Days (1987), Private Parts (1997), We Are Marshall (2006) and Straight Outta Compton (2015) provide fascinating insights into not only their own times but also the historical eras that some of these films have attempted to recreate.\n\nThe late Laurence Etling served as a professor of mass media at Valdosta State University after a career in radio, including with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nFrank Barnas has served as an on-air radio personality across the U.S. He currently teaches collegiate courses in media studies and production.\n\nMarie Barnas serves as the chair for the department of media arts at Middle Tennessee State University.\n\nForeword by Chad Whittle 1\n\nIntroduction by Frank Barnas 5\n\nOne.
