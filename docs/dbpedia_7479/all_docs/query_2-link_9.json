        "meta_description": "Prescient in more ways than one, Stuart Rosenberg's bleak melodrama stars Paul Newman as a disk jockey at WUSA, a right wing radio station whose race baiting diatribes trigger a violent uprising. Joanne Woodward, Pat Hingle, and Anthony Perkins, make up the formidable supporting cast. Mocked as over the top in 1970, Robert Stone's cautionary screenplay was just a dry run for today's breaking news.",
