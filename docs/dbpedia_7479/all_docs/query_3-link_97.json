They play seen and unseen roles in culture, politics, and religion.\n\nDoorways are openings. Symbolizing curiosity and opportunity.\n\nBut doorways can also be closures, representing obstacles and a means for separation.\n\nThis fall, TEDxTysons invites you to step over the threshold to begin a conversation. Explore new ideas, share thought-provoking stories, and experience doorways differently"
