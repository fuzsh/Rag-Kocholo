For an additional $60,000, Stone agreed to adapt his work for the screen, and Stuart Rosenberg later signed on to direct. Although an 8 Aug 1968 DV news item referred to the independent company’s deal with Universal Pictures, the film moved to Paramount Pictures and began casting early the following year.\n\nWith Newman and wife Joanne Woodward already committed to appear in the leading roles, the 20 Feb 1969 DV reported that they would be joined by Anthony Franciosa. However, a 2 Apr 1969 DV item announced Franciosa’s departure—a story confirmed five days later by an LAT article claiming he had lost the job after getting into an argument with Rosenberg.

The 22 May 1969 edition of the Los Angeles Sentinel also noted that Playboy “Bunnies” Gwen Wong, Syleste Holt, Donna Russell, and Christin Holly (all members of the Screen Actors Guild) served as background performers in a scene shot on a sound stage reproduction of the local Playboy Club in New Orleans, LA.\n\nAccording to an 11 Apr 1969 DV production chart, principal photography began in New Orleans on 3 Apr 1969. After several days on location, the cast and crew returned to the Paramount studio lot in Hollywood, CA, by mid-Apr 1969. A 21 Apr 1969 DV brief indicated that filming took place simultaneously on Stages 6 and 7. Later that summer, however, multiple contemporary sources, including the 23 Jun 1969 DV, once again placed Newman and Woodward on location in New Orleans. Production was completed shortly thereafter, and a 10 Dec 1969 Var article revealed the finished film was awaiting release.\n\nSeveral months later, the 29 Apr 1970 Var stated that Paramount had tested the picture for audiences in Boston, MA, under the title WUSA, which was intended to capitalize on the recent influx of release titles containing abbreviations or acronyms. The change stuck, and the Thanksgiving 1970 release date was pushed up by a few weeks. New York City screenings began 1 Nov 1970 at the Penthouse and Palaza theaters, followed by an exclusive West Coast engagement at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on 4 Nov 1970. The 9 Jan 1971 LAT announced that citywide expansion across Los Angeles area was due to take place on 20 Jan 1971.\n\nAt the time of its theatrical release, reviews for WUSA were generally negative, and Newman told the 24 Nov 1971 Var that he was disappointed by its commercial returns in the U.S., calling it a “flop.” He hoped its controversial subject matter would play better with foreign audiences, and the picture was included in that year’s London Film Festival lineup.\n\nLess\n\nRheinhardt, a drunken drifter, collects a debt from his old friend Farley, a con man currently posing as a revivalist preacher in New Orleans, and learns from him that right-wing radio station WUSA is looking for an announcer.
