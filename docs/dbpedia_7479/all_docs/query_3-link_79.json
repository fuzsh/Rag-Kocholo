Discover key findings from the institute’s latest research on students from equity-deserving groups in co-op programs.\n\nHear first-hand from students about the barriers they face in their work-integrated learning experiences, from applying for jobs to completing work terms.\n\nLearn more about:\n\nCommon systematic barriers faced by equity-deserving students in the workplace.\n\nActionable strategies to enhance equity in recruitment and support throughout work terms.\n\nFostering an inclusive work culture sensitive to equity-deserving students.\n\nEvent date: January 31, 2024\n\nTime: 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.\n\nRegister today!\n\nReminder: Proposals for the Teaching and Learning Conference due January 22\n\nA message from the Centre for Teaching Excellence (CTE).\n\nSubmit a proposal for the University of Waterloo’s Annual Teaching and Learning Conference, taking place May 2, 2024. Our 2024 conference theme is “Sparking and Sustaining Student Engagement”.\n\nFor our 15th annual University of Waterloo Teaching and Learning Conference, we will explore the notion of engagement and its myriad facets. Engagement is crucial for our students’ success and acts as a feedback loop: instructor engagement encourages student engagement, which in turn motivates faculty to continue to invest their energy into designing stimulating learning activities. How can we ensure that our student-centered approaches to engagement are equitable to a variety of learners? Which assessment strategies can be implemented to further engage students with course materials? How can we leverage technology to stimulate engagement? How do programs create engaging curricula that offer sufficient choice and diverse experiences to sustain students’ engagement through their degree? How do we engage with local and global communities to bridge academia and real-world challenges?\n\nWe invite you to submit proposals for presentations, panel discussions, workshops, poster presentations, and a teaching and learning showcase. New this year, we also invite proposals for pre-conference workshops which will be held online prior to the conference on Wednesday, May 1, 2024.\n\nFor more information check out the Call for Proposals website.\n\nMoves like Jaggaer: new eProcurement system to be implemented\n\n\"We are pleased to share that the University will be implementing an eProcurement system to modernize and gain efficiencies in our procurement to payment processes,\" says a memo from Jacinda Reitsma, Vice-President, Administration and Finance, Sarah Hadley, CFO, Finance, and Gregory Smith, CIO circulated to the University's Executive Council on Friday, January 12.\n\n\"Jaggaer eProcurement is currently used by 6 members of the Canadian U15 (Canadian Research Universities) as well as 85 per cent of R1’s (research-intensive schools) in the US; in particular, by 7 out of 8 US Ivy League Schools. The University of Waterloo has opted-in to an available collaborative contract and a project has been launched to implement the Jaggaer eProcurement system,\" the memo continues. \"Providing stakeholders with more modern technology and processes, the Jaggaer system offers an environment that more closely aligns with the familiar buying experience of online marketplaces.\"\n\n\"The University will achieve cost savings through consolidation of purchases to preferred, contracted suppliers, as well as through simpler and more condensed process flows per transaction, with fewer manual touchpoints throughout the process.\"\n\nWhat does this mean to me?\n\n\"The project team, including a 3rd party implementation partner, is currently in the early stages of planning for this transition, and the anticipated go-live date is late Fall 2024,\" the memo continues. \"A Project Advisory Group is being established, including representatives from high volume procuring groups, to provide guidance and direction to the project, to service as change sponsors, and potentially pilot areas. In addition, higher-volume purchasers on campus may be contacted for feedback.\"\n\n\"We look forward to providing this modernized approach to campus, and to providing further updates on the project and its launch,\" the memo concludes.\n\nA Jaggaer Implementation website has been set up where information on the project will be posted.\n\nPhotograph courtesy of JAGGAER.\n\nWednesday's notes\n\n\"Transformative Quantum Technologies presents the Quantum for Environment Design Challenge (Q4Environment) to search for opportunities where quantum technology can impact the environment,\" says a note from TQT. \"This challenge is open to University of Waterloo undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.\" Q4Environment Design Submissions are due at 5:00 p.m. on March 4.\n\nWUSA Welcome Week continues today with New Year’s Eve 2.0, a 19+ glam-and-glitter party held at the Maxwell's event space on University Avenue. Attendees should dress to impress, but also, please dress for the weather.\n\nThe TRuST Scholarly Network’s Conversations on Artificial Intelligence: Should It Be Trusted? takes place tonight at 7:00 p.m. in the Mike Lazaridis Theatre of Ideas at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics."
