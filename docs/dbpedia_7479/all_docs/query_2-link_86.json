        "text": "John C. Foreman, who produced such films as “Prizzi’s Honor” and “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” died Friday in Beverly Hills of a heart attack. He was 67.\n\nAt the time Foreman made the 1969 “buddy movie” starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford, he and Newman formed Newman-Foreman Co., a production company. Foreman later was named vice president in charge of worldwide theatrical production for MGM/UA.\n\nThe two films that were perhaps his two greatest successes, “Butch Cassidy” and the 1985 movie “Prizzi’s Honor,” formed the bookends of his producing career.\n\nHis other films included “Winning” in 1969; “Puzzle of a Downfall Child” and “WUSA” in 1970; “They Must Be Giants” and “Sometimes a Great Notion” in 1971; “The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean” in 1972; “The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds,” “Pocket Money” and “The Mackintosh Man” in 1973; “The Man Who Would Be King” in 1976; “Bobby Deerfield” in 1977; “The Great Train Robbery” in 1979, and “Eureka” and “The Ice Pirates” in 1983.\n\nForeman also produced the problem-plagued science fiction film “Brainstorm,” which was in production when its star, Natalie Wood, drowned near Catalina in 1982.\n\nA native of Idaho Falls, Ida., Foreman served in the Navy during World War II and taught at Stevens College before beginning his career in show business.\n\nHe worked at MCA and at the public relations agency Rogers & Cowan. He was a co-founder of Creative Management Agency, which became ICM.\n\nThe relaxed Foreman household was frequently the scene of popular informal Hollywood parties. Foreman delighted in helping with the cooking and he specialized in baking superb pies.\n\nForeman is survived by his wife, actress Linda Lawson, their two daughters, Julie and Amanda, and two sisters.\n\nA memorial service will be scheduled later. The family has asked that memorial contributions be made to the TreePeople."
