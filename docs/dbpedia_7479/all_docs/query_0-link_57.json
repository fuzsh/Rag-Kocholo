        "text": "Stacker looked at Paul Newmanâs best films, then ranked the list from lowest to highest, according to IMDb user ratings. - Silver Screen Collection // Getty Images\n\nAnnalise Mantz\n\nWith a film career spanning more than 50 years, Paul Newman is one of the most prolific actors of the past century. Prior to his death in 2008, Newman had 85 acting credits listed on IMDb, plus a handful of directing, producing, and writing credits. Itâs an impressive curriculum vitae for a man with humble beginnings in Shaker Heights, Ohio. Though he never finished drama school at Yale University, he landed his first big role in âPicnicâ on Broadway. His performance garnered attention from Warner Bros., who gave Newman a film contract, and the rest is history.\n\nTo get a sense of just how enduring Newmanâs career was, Stacker compiled a list of all 55 films starring the actor, then ranked the list from lowest to highest, according to IMDb user ratings. The list is not all hits, though: Newmanâs first film was widely panned by critics and viewers alike. Keep reading for the full list of Newmanâs lead roles in feature films, from âCarsâ to âButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.â\n\nYou may also like: Best and worst Al Pacino movies\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#55.

Paul Newman took the role of Armand, a thief and anarchist with whom Lady L fell in love while she worked in a brothel in Paris. Lady L eventually agrees to marry Lord Lendale, who, in turn, says he will ignore Armandâs criminal activities.
