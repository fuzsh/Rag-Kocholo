As assistant professor of media and democracy at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, he is particularly interested in how platforms such as search engines and social media impact how the public looks for and finds news. However, he also researches how computational techniques are used in newsmaking. He is interested in data and computational journalism, media literacy and algorithmic accountability. Trielli's research has been published in Information, Communication & Society and the journal of the International Symposium on Online Journalism, and was presented at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems and the Computation + Journalism Symposium.

First, his research critically examines how capitalism erodes social frictions such as independent journalism and labor power, that are critical to an equitable, functioning democracy. Vasudevan also studies the ways in which digital platforms such as Facebook and Uber use interactive design to shape the beliefs and behaviors of workers, consumers and citizens. Another key dimension of his research is examining how workers such as journalists and taxi drivers resist capitalism, through the creation of media, technologies and worker-owned cooperatives. He uses ethnographic methods, filmmaking and textual analysis to produce critical, qualitative research and films. Vasudevan's research has been published in several academic journals and books, such as Communication Culture and Critique, the Howard Journal of Communications, Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, Journalism Studies, Journalism Practice, and The Handbook of Visual Communication (2nd Edition). He serves as the 2020-21 research chair of the Cultural & Critical Studies Division of AEJMC and was selected as an inaugural Research Leaders Fellow at the University of Maryland.

He is the author of “The Enforcers: How Little-Known Trade Reporters Exposed the Keating Five and Advanced Business Journalism” (University of Illinois Press, 2019), one of the first books to explore the power and promise of investigative journalism in the trade press. His second book, “The Insider: How the Kiplinger Newsletter Bridged Washington and Wall Street” (University of Massachusetts Press), argues that business journalist Willard Kiplinger was an influential political actor during the New Deal. Kiplinger played an important role in persuading businesses to accept New Deal regulations, and therefore was part of a movement to transform capitalism in the 1930s. Wells also conducts research in data journalism and is the author of \"Media coverage of Chinese investment in the United States: Politics and missed opportunities” (Newspaper Research Journal, 2021), a big data analysis of news coverage involving Chinese investment in the U.S. from 2000 to 2019. Wells completed his Ph.D. at Merrill in 2016 and returned to the university in Spring 2022 after more than five years at the University of Arkansas, where he rose to the rank of associate professor and led Arkansas' journalism graduate program.\n\nRonald Yaros, Ph.D., University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nDr. Ronald Yaros researches the cognitive aspects of how online and mobile users seek, select, and share digital content, especially news about complex topics. His Media Engagement Lab currently works with major news organizations to test innovative strategies and analytics that engage more users with more content for longer periods of time. He is a 2017 Apple Distinguished Educator and a 2017 Tow-Knight “Disrupter in Education” Fellow. His research on web and mobile audiences appears in two book chapters, Communication Research, Science Communication, International Journal of Cyber Behavior Psychology, and Learning, and Harvard’s Nieman Reports.

Within this broad research framework, we have particular interests in international media, media history, gender, and the study of emerging technology and the audience. These themes are explored in a range of national and international research publications, academic conferences, grants, keynote presentations, workshops and other outlets. In particular, we pride ourselves on a strong culture of research collaboration, both informally within Merrill College as well as formally through a large amount of coproduced work among colleagues and with our Ph.D. students. From 2012 to 2015 alone, Ph.D. students were coauthors on 27 separate refereed journal articles, scholarly papers, book chapters, reports and other publications.\n\nYou can learn more about individual researchers under our faculty listings, but below is an overview of research from our tenured and tenure-track faculty (alphabetical order):\n\nMark Feldstein: Media history, with a focus on the intersection of national politics and reporters.\n\nChristopher Hanson: Conflict reporting and media history.
