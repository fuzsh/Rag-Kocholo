        "text": "Robert Stone was born on August 21, 1937 – he turns 70 today. As it happens, next month is also the 40th anniversary of the publication of his first novel, “A Hall of Mirrors.”\n\nAn ad for that book – click here to see the whole thing – appeared in the Book Review on September 21, 1967.\n\n“A Hall of Mirrors” is a mighty novel that got a mighty send-off in the Book Review. It was reviewed by Ivan Gold, who immediately put rubber to road. Here’s his first paragraph and a half:\n\nIt is almost impertinent to say that the 30-year-old author of this first novel has talent, and it is impertinent to try and relate his gifts to his age or publishing history. Stone, at this moment, is a remarkable writer.\n\n“A Hall of Mirrors” is, one could say, “The Day of the Locust” as told to Malcolm Lowry and edited by Franz Fanon, the shade of the young Dos Passos benignly gazing on the while. And with such namedropping I mean less to imply influences – which in any case are of interest chiefly to academics and biographers – than to indicate what league Stone is playing in.\n\n“A Hall of Mirrors” was turned into what is said to be an awesomely bad movie – no, you can’t find it on Netflix – called “WUSA” (1970), starring Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward and Anthony Perkins.\n\nI got the chance to interview Stone a decade ago – somehow it seemed appropriate, given the hectic life he’s led, that he was still wincing from being punched in the jaw the night before – and “WUSA” came up. Here’s what he had to say:\n\nThe movie version of my first book (“A Hall of Mirrors”) is a really dreadful movie. The movie’s called “WUSA.” It sometimes ambushes me at 3 o’clock in the morning in motels. It’s a really bad movie. People who’ve read the book and seen the movie sometimes don’t make the connection between the two of them, which is just as well from my point of view.\n\nI have a few problems with “Who’ll Stop the Rain?” – as the movie of “Dog Soldiers” is so fatuously called. But …\n\nYou don’t like the title?\n\nNo, I think the title is ridiculous. The moral of the title is: Never use a Swedish diphthong to begin a movie title with – like “Who’ll.” I mean it’s a ridiculous title, an absurd, moronic title. God knows what moron came up with it. But it has wonderful performances in it. A lot of really first-rate work and thought went into the making of it.\n\nThe movies made from Stone’s books won’t be watched much in 50 years, but his novels will continue to be read.\n\nAmong the other things to like about Stone: He and his wife, Janice Stone, remain married after 48 years. He’s stuck by his publishing house, too. Houghton Mifflin issued “A Hall of Mirrors” back in 1967. It is still publishing him today.\n\nHappy birthday, Mr. Stone."
