        "text": "The journey that led Ethan Hawke to make a six-part documentary about Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward started about 40 years ago, when a 10-year-old Hawke was on his way to Sunday church with his father.\n\n“I used to have to go to church every Sunday,” Hawke told the audience on Saturday at the Cannes Film Festival, where two parts of his CNN/HBO Max series “The Last Movie Stars” premiered. “I really hated church, but my parents made me go.”\n\nOne particular Sunday, he said, his stepmother was sick and decided to skip the service. So Hawke and his father got dressed up in their suits and ties and headed for church. “On the way there, my father turned to me and said, ‘There’s a matinee of “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” playing. Would you rather do that?’”\n\nHe laughed. “Yes, I would rather do that!”\n\nAlso Read:...\n\nHe is a TV news star: His views are populist, his subtext racist. His advocacy is passionate and his TV audience is vast, despite suspicion that he pursues an agenda above and beyond his own.\n\nSome may rush to identify this character – images of Fox News flash before us – but the TV anchor was, in fact, a creation of Paul Newman, a star of a previous generation whose presence seems pervasive in the present.\n\nAt a moment when political expression, personal or corporate, seems instantly suffocated, Newman was a courageous free spirit who vented his opinions and put his career at risk in support of them. The superstar is the subject of a riveting new documentary directed by Ethan Hawke prompting praise this week at SXSW. He also is the subject of a revealing, long-suppressed memoir being published this fall by Alfred A. Knopf.\n\nThough he passed in 2008, Newman occupies...\n\nOnly a few days short of January’s end, 2021 has seen the loss of its first Oscar winner. Here’s how the Associated Press broke the news:\n\nCloris Leachman, an Oscar-winner for her portrayal of a lonely housewife in “The Last Picture Show” and a comedic delight as the fearsome Frau Blücher in “Young Frankenstein” and self-absorbed neighbor Phyllis on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” has died. She was 94.\n\nLeachman died in her sleep of natural causes at her home in Encinitas, California, publicist Monique Moss said Wednesday. Her daughter Dinah Englund was at her side, Moss said.\n\nRemarkably those 94 years encompassed nine decades of work on the big and small(er) screen. A truly versatile actress, her knack for comedy wasn’t really showcased until nearly twenty years into her astounding career. As a tribute we offer a fond look back at the work of a true cinema “scene-stealer...\n\nOscar winner and multiple Emmy winner Cloris Leachman, best remembered as the delightfully neurotic Phyllis Lindstrom on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” and her own subsequent sitcom, died of natural causes on Tuesday in Encinitas, Calif. She was 94.\n\n“It’s been my privilege to work with Cloris Leachman, one of the most fearless actresses of our time,” her longtime manager Juliet Green said. “There was no one like Cloris. With a single look she had the ability to break your heart or make you laugh ’till the tears ran down your face. You never knew what Cloris was going to say or do and that unpredictable quality was part of her unparalleled magic.”\n\nThe daffy, self-absorbed Phyllis, a character she claimed was close to her own persona, brought the actress two Emmys as a featured actress in a series during the mid-’70s and made Leachman a household name.\n\nLeachman...\n\nGet in touch to send in cinephile news and discoveries.

Trailblazing filmmaker Joan Micklin Silver, best known for films Hester Street (1975) and Crossing Delancey (1988), has died. In an interview with Film Comment in 2017, Silver described the will she possessed as a woman filmmaker who wished to spotlight stories about female relationships and women's labor: \"I didn’t want to feel like the woman director. I wanted to feel like one of many women directors.\"The 71st edition of the Berlin Film Festival will be replacing this year's physical event with a virtual European Film Market in March, and a \"mini-festival with a series of onsite world premieres\" in June.The International Film Festival Rotterdam has also announced the lineup for this year's hybrid multi-part 50th edition, to be presented between February 1-...\n\nGordon with Steve McQueen in the 1968 blockbuster \"Bullitt\".\n\nBy Lee Pfeiffer\n\nCharacter actor Don Gordon has died at age 90. Gordon was a close friend of Steve McQueen and he appeared with McQueen in three of his biggest hits: \"Bullitt\", \"Papillon\" and \"The Towering Inferno\". Gordon generally played strong silent types and his face was familiar to movie goers especially in the 1960s and 1970s. In \"Bullitt\" he had a meaty role playing the partner of McQueen's maverick detective. In \"Papillon\" he was a fellow convict suffering through the hell of Devil's Island prison and in \"The Towering Inferno\" he played a fellow firefighter helping McQueen to save trapped people from a blazing skyscraper. Gordon also appeared on numerous television series in guest star roles and earned an Emmy nomination for his performance in \"The Defenders\". Among his other screen credits: \"Wusa\", \"Fuzz\", \"Lethal Weapon\", \"The Final Conflict\" and \"Exorcist III\".

And we find, examining American film history, that Sinclair Lewis's novel It Can't Happen Here has never been filmed, and that filmmakers have tended to take his title as a statement of truth. A Face in the Crowd reassuringly tells us that Americans always get wise to would-be dictators before it's too late. We have very few movies that take the idea of a tyrant getting elected and run with it. There's Gabriel Over the White House, but that's an MGM film so naturally it views the idea of a despotic zealot in the Oval Office as a good thing. The Dead Zone offers a glimpse of such a future,...\n\nBlu-ray Release Date: May 13, 2014\n\nPrice: Blu-ray $29.95\n\nStudio: Twilight Time\n\nThe 1975 sci-fi-tinged action-sports film Rollerball, one of the Seventies great dystopian future-shock flicks, finally makes its Blu-ray debut courtesy of Twilight Time.\n\nIn the future, there will be no war. But there will be Rollerball.\n\nRollerball posits a future—in this case a not-so-far-away 2018—in which war has been replaced by the titular game, a gladiatorial spectacle of violence that helps keep the global populace entertained and anesthetized. Emerging from this hard-hitting “sport” is a champion, Jonathan E (James Caan, Thief), whose individual expertise defeats the worldwide corporate leadership’s design: to emphasize the futility of individual effort. Corporate big-wigs (icily incarnated by The Fog‘s John Houseman) need Jonathan to retire, but Jonathan begins to have his own dangerous ideas.\n\nDirected by Norman Jewison (Fiddler on the Roof) and written by William Harrison, the film also stars Moses Gunn (Wusa...\n\nBlu-ray Release Date: July 23, 2013\n\nPrice: Blu-ray $24.95\n\nStudio: Olive Films\n\nPaul Newman takes to the airwaves in Wusa.\n\nPaul Newman (Hud), Joanne Woodward (The Three Faces of Eve), Anthony Perkins (Psycho) and Pat Hingle (Talledega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby) star in the 1970 drama Wusa.\n\nThe film concerns a jaded disc-jockey (Newman) who offers his services to Wusa, a conservative, hate-stirring station out of New Orleans. While struggling with his own apathy, the deejay begins spreading hateful messages perpetrated by the owner of the station (Hingle), which leads to some pretty ugly goings-on.\n\nDirected by Stuart Rosenberg (Cool Hand Luke) and based on Robert Stone’s best-selling novel A Hall of Mirrors , Wusa also stars Laurence Harvey (1962′s The Manchurian Candidate), Don Gordon (Bullitt), Cloris Leachman (The Women), Moses Gunn (The Neverending Story) and Wayne Rogers (TV’s M*A*S*H).\n\nWusa was released by on DVD by Olive...\n\nDVD Release Date: Jan. 15, 2013\n\nPrice: 2-Disc DVD $34.95\n\nStudio: Kino\n\nKing: A Filmed Record…from Montgomery to Memphis is the landmark 1970 documentary film that chronicles the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., from the beginnings of the Civil Rights movement in Montgomery to the triumph on the Lincoln Memorial steps to King’s tragic assassination in Memphis in 1968.\n\nOriginally screened in theaters for only a single night in 1970, the three-hour King: A Filmed Record has occasionally been circulated since then in a version that was shortened by an hour. The complete version has been newly restored by the Library of Congress in association with Richard Kaplan and utilizes elements from New York’s Museum of Modern. It’s been mastered in HD from the 35mm preservation negative.\n\nConceived and produced by Ely Landau, the unrated film features remarkable newsreel and archival footage of King’s speeches,...\n\nDVD Playhouse—March 2011\n\nBy\n\nAllen Gardner\n\n127 Hours (20th Century Fox) Harrowing true story of Aron Ralston (James Franco, in another fine turn), an extreme outdoorsman who finds himself trapped in a remote Utah canyon, his arm pinned between two boulders, with no help nearby, no communication to the outside world, and dim prospects for survival, to say the least. Director Danny Boyle manages to prove again that he’s one of the finest filmmakers working today by making a subject that is seemingly uncinematic a true example of pure cinema. Inventive, breathtaking, funny, and horrifying, often all at once. Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara make a memorable, brief appearance as hikers who connect with Ralston during his journey. Also available on Blu-ray disc. Bonuses: Commentary by Boyle, producer Christian Colson, co-writer Simon Beaufoy; Deleted scenes; Featurettes. Widescreen. Dolby and DTS-hd 5.1 surround.\n\nAmarcord (Criterion) Federico Fellini’s Oscar-winning, autobiographical classic might...\n\nYour Weekly Source for Blu-Ray and DVD Release News\n\nThere’s a whole lot of everything to choose from this week. Criterion serves up the 2008 Japanese gem Still Walking along with a fine dose of Fellini with Amarcord, while on the opposite end we are graced by the release of Panela Anderson’s Barb Wire on blu-ray. One of my favorite animated flicks on 2010, How To Train Your Dragon, hits store shelves and there’s a Samsung 3D starter version of the blu-ray disc available with certain 3D TV purchases. Doesn’t that make you want to run out and throw down $3000? Both versions of I Spit On Your Grave hit blu-ray and DVD, but I still prefer my Millennium Edition DVD featuring a commentary by Joe Bob Briggs. Two “rivers” converge on blu-ray for you viewing pleasure and Thelma & Louise get the anniversary treatment.\n\nBlu-Ray for Tuesday, Feb. 8, 2011 Amarcord...\n\nA look at what's new on DVD today:\n\n\"Tesis\" (1996)\n\nDirected by Alejandro Amenabar\n\nReleased by Widowmaker Films\n\nLong out of print, \"The Others\" director Alejandro Amenabar's debut about a grad student's discovery of a snuff film is being remastered and rereleased by Widowmaker Films.\n\n\"Alice in Murderland\" (2011)\n\nDirected by Dennis Devine\n\nReleased by Brain Damage Films\n\nA year after Tim Burton's \"Alice in Wonderland\" scared the bejeezus out of kids in multiplexes everywhere, this horror take on Lewis Carroll's classic fairy tale aims to do so intentionally on DVD players around the country.\n\n\"America, America\" (1963)\n\nDirected by Elia Kazan\n\nReleased by Fox Home Entertainment\n\nElia Kazan's most personal film based on the story of his uncle's immigration to the United States from Turkey, where as a Greek his family is persecuted, was already released as part of last year's Kazan boxed set, but now will be...\n\nFebruary 2009 began on a sad note for many vampire lovers and horror fans with the death of iconic genre legend Robert Quarry. If there was one actor capable of equalling Christopher Lee’s immortal performance as Dracula it was Quarry as the evil Count Yorga. A veteran of stage and TV, Quarry was set to become a major horror star of the seventies, but his film career faded rapidly, a situation not helped by a terrible run of bad luck that nearly cost him his life. Despite never achieving the movie stardom he deserved, his enigmatic turn as the sardonic vampire lord has given him cult immortality.\n\nThe son of a doctor, Robert Walter Quarry was born in Fresno, California on 3 November 1925. He spent his early years in Santa Rosa, Northern California, where he excelled in most high school sports, especially swimming. Quarry, who had an Iq of 168, became interested in acting through his grandmother,...\n\nIt is with great sadness that I write of the passing of actor Robert Quarry.\n\nTo most who read Fangoria, he was Count Yorga, Vampire (Aip 1970) who Returned (1971) before he found that Dr Phibes Rises Again that same year, became a Deathmaster in 1972, met Sugar Hill and went to the Madhouse in 1974.\n\nHe was more than that, though. Born Robert Walter Quarry on November 3, 1925, the highly intelligent Quarry (who it was said had an I.Q. of 168) graduated High School at age 14, and started his acting career soon after on radio. Living in Santa Rose, Quarry won an acting scholarship to the Pasadena Playhouse. When Alfred Hitchcock came to Santa Rosa, Quarry auditioned and won the role of Theresa Wright’s boyfriend in the 1943 classic Shadow Of A Doubt. His role, however, was all but cut out (he swore he appeared a nanosecond mooning over the actress), but it led to his Hollywood career,..."
