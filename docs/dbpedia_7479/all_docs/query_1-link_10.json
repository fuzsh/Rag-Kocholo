        "text": "I’ve always found Joanne so boring as an actress. Anybody could have played her well-known roles, and there are a lot of better actresses in her age range - I’d rather watch anything from Anne Bancroft, Patricia Neal, Shirley MacLaine, Gena Rowlands, Cloris Leachman, Geraldine Page or even a less technically skilled Lauren Bacall / Audrey Hepburn / Liz Taylor performance over drying paint Joanne. She’s a lot like Lee Remick, except Lee didn’t have a Newman-Woodwardesque hype train behind her.\n\nPaul Newman was seen as the inheritor of James Dean’s career following Dean’s death, but he was a lot more talented than Dean and a great movie star.\n\nThis seems like it’s going to be one of those Fosse/Verdon type things, to revise history and make the (comparatively) neglected female half of a famous creative partnership/marriage much more important and acclaimed than she actually was. There was a very brief window of time when Joanne was seen as the prestige one of the duo - from her Oscar win until Newman’s Oscar nomination for The Hustler.\n\n[R108]: Newman did a few roles that could be considered character parts. He’s a fleeting punch-drunk drifter, more or less nursemaided by his buddy Juano Hernandez, in “Hemingway’s Adventures of a Young Man” (1962). He’s a Mexican thug in “The Outrage” (1964). He’s a funny, wacky artist in “What a Way to Go!” (1964).\n\nLater in life, he was General Leslie Groves in “Fat Man and Little Boy” (1989, and a satiric role in “The Hudsucker Proxy” (1990), as well as playing Mr. Bridge that same year.\n\nNone of these roles were remotely handsome leading men, which certainly shows his willingness to expand his range.\n\nAs for his personal inclinations, I once met a man in San Diego who claimed he had been kept in an apartment there by Newman for 2 years. And another man who claimed, in his escort days of his youth, he was hired to fuck Paul, while Joanne watched.\n\n(I thought this pretty farfetched, until I read an interview, in which Joanne stated that, once when they were being interviewed by a woman from a magazine like Red Book, that she and Paul, “as a joke,” confounded the poor lady with a tale that they used to hire male escorts to fuck him while she watched. Curious…)\n\nUgh, even reading this thread I wasn’t prepared for that ten minute opening of contemporary actors in Zoom calls, what a shitty way to start a documentary on the last movie stars. That should have been an after aside post credits, not the lead in. I’m really interested if anything has been written about the transformation of documentaries over the last three or so decades. There was a time when there seemed to be clear criteria for what goes into them including no reenactments, objectivity by someone outside the friends and family circle, only primary source documents and artifacts, an attempt at being truly balanced (which isn’t to say they didn’t have a point of view) and other things that seemed to be sacrosanct or at least industry held ethics and ideals. I guess in a way documentaries went the way of news, from being about reporting facts, to placing entertainment at the center. Also, how does this compare to the Lucy/Desi one for anybody who watched both?\n\nJoanne was a magnificent actress. To me she helped usher in a more realistic, natural style of acting to American cinema that you would normally find in artsy European films. Even her actors studio contemporaries like Kim Stanley, Geraldine Page, Marilyn Monroe, Jane Fonda and co were MUCH more fidgety. She wasn't afraid to employ the 'don't act, just *be*' philosophy, which I guess is why some of her performances seem small compared to her peers. Even a 'boring' role like Rachel Rachel, she underplayed it to stark effect. It's such a haunting portrait of suburban ennui and depression - the scene where she's lying on the table in the doctor's office is harrowing.\n\nI guess the closest thing she has to a 'classic' might be Sybil, which is more of an iconic project because of Sally Field's character but still another great, nuanced performance. I think the final on-screen role for both Newman and Woodward was Empire Falls series (HBO), and in a cast of thousands (Helen Hunt, Ed Harris, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Robin Wright, Estelle Parsons) she completely steals the show as the scheming, villainous tycoon who pulls all the strings in their small town and is hiding decades of dark secrets. Newman is fine in it but mostly coasting on his charm and looks (even as an older man).\n\nI love the chapter on Paul in Fran Langella's book Dropped Names:\n\nThere are countless examples of the lengths so many oncebeautiful women go to preserve what is impossible to recapture. Great male beauties don't suffer in quite the same way, but they suffer nonetheless. There are, of course, compensations in old age: wisdom, family, good friends, achievement, wealth. But my experience of the great beauties I have known, male and female, is that each would forfeit those perks to be magnificent once more. Paul Newman's beauty was original and mesmerizing and, in my experience of him, he was master of and slave to it. I first met him when he was casting a film in which his wife, Joanne Woodward, would star and he would direct, entitled Rachel, Rachel. The year was 1967. Paul was forty-two. I was twenty nine. Twenty minutes late getting to their Upper East Side apartment from their house in Connecticut, he came through the door, dropping bags, deeply apologetic, pulling off his sunglasses, and there they were - those compelling baby blues, completely and utterly beautiful; as was the rest of him. I didn ' t get the part but I did come to know Paul, after a fashion. I doubt there was much in life that Paul was denied. To watch women in his presence was to forever put to rest the notion that men are shallow, only caring about a woman's face and body while women look for those deeper substitutes like \"a sense of humor\" or \"kindness\" (continues)\n\nAfter dirty-sexy jokes, shop talk, cars, or politics were exhausted, Paul was a pretty dull companion. Never rude or unkind, just dull. The lights would go out and he was in for the night. He had drunk enough beer or heard enough jokes and that was it. But he was so beautiful, people thought it must be their fault if he went silent or just emptily gazed at them. Apart from his many visits backstage, I was in his company perhaps only a dozen times over the years I knew him. And I was always the first to leave the scene. You knew you were with a deeply feeling man, a decent man and a man of principle, but like the statue of David, there he stood, physically perfect but emotionally vacant. There were so many arenas in which he would not play that eventually I did what I could to avoid any prolonged contact with him. Another reason I did not pursue a friendship of consequence with Paul was that I felt that to be his friend meant being many things I was not. Those being a beer-drinking, sports-loving, charity-driven, race-car-junkie acolyte. It seemed to me that, in the end, he could only go so far inside himself and could only be with people who could tolerate that limitation in him. Even when he didn't want to be, he was the center of every universe and his circle continually waltzed around him, accepting their leader on his face value, so to speak. (continues)\n\nIn 1991, I was appearing in a play at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut. It was about a raging tyrannical actor at the turn of the century named Junius Brutus Booth. Paul came to see it without Joanne or one of his usual cronies. He walked me to my car in the almost empty dark parking lot and as we strolled along he put his hand on my shoulder, then moved it to the back of my neck, squeezed it hard, and shook it. \"Where does all that anger come from, Franco?\" \"I wouldn't know where to start,\" I said. \"You scared me tonight up there.\" \"Well, you know, it' s acting,\" I joked. \"Yeah, but you can at least let it out. I can t.\" \"What' s your anger about? \" I asked. \"I wouldn ' t know where to start\". Paul loved the craft of acting but the burden he carried was not, in my opinion, his good looks. He had no danger. And it is essential for a great actor. Non-beauties like Jack Palance and James Cagney had it. And Paul's major rivals in his early years - Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, James Dean, and Steve McQueen- all had it. And all self-destructed. Paul lived to eighty-three years old within a healthy lifestyle, and I'm convinced he knew he was without greatness. (cont.)\n\nAnd that very lack of danger in him may explain why, as beautiful as he was, he personally had very little sex appeal. The last time I saw him was in a small off-Broadway lobby. It was a windy, wintry night. His illness had begun. He was standing behind me. \"Franco, my boy. \" I turned around and looked into the baby blues I'd looked into some forty years earlier. An old man now, face thin and ravaged, a beard for his next role, fine sparse hair blown around by the wind. \"Paulo, \" I said, and instinctively reached up to put his hair in place, smoothing it down with my fingers and making it neat. I then moved my hands down to his cold cheeks and kissed them both. He fixed me with a look of heartbreaking tenderness and I thought for a moment he might be fighting back tears. \"There. Now you look like Paul Newman, \" I said. \"And what man wouldn ' t want to look like Paul Newman? \" It occurs to me now, as I write this, that perhaps he might have been that man.\n\nI never much cared for Joanne in her early films. She was okay, but that voice grated a bit. She non-acting while ACTING. It's very Actors Studio. Even 3 Faces of Eve doesn't hold up for me in retrospect. Her transitions between personalities comes off really fake. (actually, though pretty much a potboiler, Eleanor Parker is much better in Lizzie - you can even see her change personalities from behind. It's a very underrated performance.) Joanne's acting jumped to another level with Rachel Rachel. She did many wonderful things after that. Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams is one of my favoirte movies. (But it's not a comedy, even though she has a few funny lines in it.) The one thing Joanne couldn't do was comedy. She's actually the opposite of Shirley Maclaine, who started out so unstudied and in the moment, and got more mannered as she got older.\n\nMeryl Streep has had the career she has had because of a combination or luck and a supportive husband\n\nLuck because many of her films have been filmed in NYC, so she was able to still be at home.\n\nWhen she had to travel to other countries to film (Australia, Africa, England, Poland) her husband & kids went with her and he looked after the kids. Or the kids stayed in NYC and her husband was the care-giver. I'm sure they had help, but you always want one parent around.\n\nJoanne didn't have that, She sacrificed her career to support Paul's. If films roles came her way, and she had to travel she couldn't count on Paul staying home to take care of the kids. Doing Broadway, forget it. Who would be home at night to tuck the kids in bed,\n\nR389 There was an interview on some morning show in 1991 before the Oscars where she said she hated flying and opted not to go. There were some pundits picking her to win in fact. Villainous roles rarely won at this time. So that didn’t exactly bode too well for Bates. Joanne or Anjelica definitely came in second.\n\nR397 Is correct. Paul was nominated for producing RR. He was the one that convinced HER to go. She made a comment about the Oscars being too political, which might’ve have hurt her in the vote tally. Babs was convinced Joanne would win in fact.\n\nR402 Newman was in his mid 70s at the time doing Broadway. Might not have been his most tiring acting assignment, but Broadway isn’t a walk in the park for any actor, especially if you’re old.\n\n[quote] Yes, she won an Oscar, but it was for a movie that most people under the age of 50 have never seen.\n\nWell honey, when Luise Rainer popped off she had won two Oscars for two movies almost no one under the age of 50 had seen. but she still made the front page of the NYTimes.\n\nIt seems just beyond some of you that not every film actress in the world wants to be impersonated one day by Mario Cantone in his stand-up act. Some of them do it because they want to do genuinely good work, not in order so gay men can caricature their mannerisms.\n\n\"Blake's nightclub act included impersonations of multiple famous women; including Tallulah Bankhead, Katharine Hepburn, Hedda Hopper, Edna Mae Oliver, Louella Parsons, Zazu Pitts, Barbara Stanwyck, and Sophie Tucker. Of all the women he portrayed, he was most celebrated for his portrayals of Bette Davis, Carmen Miranda, and Eleanor Roosevelt. His impersonation of Roosevelt led to an invitation from the First Lady and President Franklin D. Roosevelt to perform for them in the East Room of the White House while they were in office. Bette Davis stated the following in an interview,\n\nPeople think I don't like those impersonators who do me. Well, they're wrong. I like it very much, as long as they are very good. The only time I don't like it is if they aren't good, or, worse, if they're better than I am. I watch them to learn about myself. Until I saw Arthur Blake, I never knew I moved my elbows so much. \"\n\n[quote] [R472], amazing to think that those stage actresses' voices and mannerisms were famous enough to the masses before the advent of film and television. I guess it was mostly through radio and recordings.\n\nThey would have done their impersonations mostly before a sophisticated New York crowd. who would have seen those women on the stage frequently. Also, someone like Ethel Barrymore toured all over the United States back in those days, and huge crowds came to see her.\n\nIt was just such a different world then. Before sound cinema, and especially before radio or recordings, you could be a huge, huge star like one of the Barrymores or the Booths, with your name in the all the papers; and yet only a small portion of the nation's population would have actually ever seen you perform.\n\nThis would have worked better as four or, at most, five episodes. Hawke is a bit intrusive\n\nR89: The term schizophrenic had been around for decades and not just in medical circles---there's a Daffy Duck cartoon that references it---\"schizo, schizo, manic depressive\". \"Three Faces of Eve\" and other stories of multiples led to the meaning of schizophrenia being confused. Rather than being a \"multiple\" personality the \"split\" aspect of schizophrenia (\"split brain\" in Latin, I believe) refers to the split from reality and the disorganization of behavior. Regardless, it and her other early films suffer from the somewhat heavy handedness of what passed for \"psychological\" or social problem drama of the time. I like her better in her later films and her tv work.\n\nNewman was star who became an actor. His striking good looks carried him through a series of lead roles where he was, at best competent. His accent and his ability to convey Williams coded dialogue in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" are chopped liver compared with Liz Taylor. He seems to have gotten better later partly because of Woodward. It's funny to see clips of him with Tom Cruise---a star who always seems to be \"trying to act\" but never gets lost in a character and Redford who is likeable enough and pretty but never became a real actor himself. At least Redford could direct and has done useful things in his life.\n\nAs for Woodward, the need to mold herself in real life to the roles of wife and mother may actually be what helped her go from method acting in \"serous\" film to something more natural later on. Her own mother sounds like a likable airhead and her mother-in-law sounds like a complete WASPy horror and she had no sister on which to model herself.\n\nShe would have competed for roles with Maclaine simply because they were from the same age/talent cohort. They both were \"unusual\" for their time and probably difficult to cast because they were not bombshells or \"cool blondes\" which were more characteristic of the late 50s/early 60s. Woodward, what ever her limitations, could carry a film. Maclaine tended to do better in an ensemble with a strong director as in \"The Apartment\", where she also didn't play wacky for once. Her starring vehicles from that era tend to be unwatchable. Woodward would have been interesting in \"The Turning Point\" for the Bancroft character---she probably would have made it more sympathetic, but she also could have moved more like a dancer.\n\n[quote]\"I love my children, but can't help but think I would have been better off without having any\" was pretty brutal.\n\nYou've never heard anyone say something like that? It's not uncommon. I even asked my mother if she would have had children again, expecting her to say no (she said \"yes.\")\n\n[quote]It definitely strains to make them, particularly Joanne, more interesting than they were.\n\nFor me that's a large part of Joanne Woodward's appeal, she's was \"every woman,\" she was a friend, a neighbor, a person you'd meet at the community pool. Very natural, not some loud mouth diva.\n\n[quote] Woodward saying, \"I love my children, but can't help but think I would have been better off without having any\" was pretty brutal.\n\nIt is honest because she gave up her career to raise her kids. Look at Shirley Maclaine, yes she had great parts. But she dumped her daughter to be raised by her ex-husband, then stuck her in boarding school.\n\nNow they barely have a relationship. Wheras at Joanne can say she did one thing right, by putting her career on the back-burner to raise her children.\n\nThis brings us back to Meryl Streep. If she didn't have a supportive husband who was willing to handle the parenting while she was away, Streep would never have the career she has had.\n\nAgree with R426, R429 about the ‘91 Oscars:\n\nWoodward was a contender as her performance in Mr. & Mrs. Bridge was much admired.\n\nHuston was the front runner for her much talked about performance in The Grifters which positioned her as a lead, dramatic actress without Nicholson or her father.\n\nBates was the dark horse and her win was one of the last genuine surprises at the Oscars and, of course, completely deserved. (The win also kind of flattered mainstream audiences because the film was a big hit.)\n\nThe only surprise about Roberts’ nomination was that they actually did it, since PW was, along with Ghost, the one of the biggest hits of the year. Neither film was very good though and both were of low-brow taste so, aside from Whoppi’s supporting turn, the inclusion of both films kind of tainted the ceremony. But I wouldn’t consider Roberts’ nomination a shocker. More that it was just apart in quality from the other nominees.\n\nWoodward would’ve certainly been a long shot on the night but was considered a contender throughout the season.\n\nAlso, in response to I think it was R545: Glenn Close was NEVER going to win for Fatal Attraction. Not on the night or ever. She was ACKNOWLEDGED, of course, but that film and her role in it were far too controversial to be further elevated by the Academy. The 7 (or so) nominations it did get, especially the above the line ones, were surprising (though Close was likely always a given as a nominee) - Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress were all surprising nominations; there was probably some question as to whether Douglas would be nominated for Fatal Attraction or Wall Street. But the film and its depiction of Close’s character was far too divisive - even with Close herself, which was widely publicised at the time. The audience response to her character was actually a good indicator of the latent misogyny inherent in American society which would rear its ugly head decades later in our current politics. She was never going to win despite her obvious and major contribution to the film’s success - which is what made her loss to Foster the following year for her worthy performance in Dangerous Liasons so surprising; it looked like it was going to be her “make up” Oscar. It became clear then that despite a number of nominations throughout the ‘80s, the Academy didn’t really like Glenn Close enough to actually give her an Oscar and that remains true today.\n\nGrowing up in the ‘70s, to me, Woodward was always “a wife who acts”. She was never my favourite actress but I understood she was reputed to be a terrific actress. Newman was like, a star who didn’t have to try very hard. He never really played anyone of any real relevance and seemed to make buddy pictures with Redford. Their pairings, especially the 1st one, really defined so much of appeal of the culture in the early ‘70s for a certain kind of American male; fans of John Wayne for whom it would be years before they got on board with the likes of Jack Nicholson in Cuckoo’s Nest. Newman seemed to be mostly horsing around. It wasn’t until the ‘80s with films like Absence of Malice and especially The Verdict that he emerged as something different. And then there was the push to get him an Oscar.\n\nI remember their film of The Glass Ménagerie was a huge misfire - maybe it seemed more so because I was living in Chicago at the time and there was a ton of publicity about it because the even did like a benefit premiere screening for Steppenwolf because of Malkovich’s involvement (it was one of his early, bewigged, film roles). And it wasn’t very well received, primarily because her performance was thought to be so hammy. Chicago, of course, was where the play first came to notice with the original production with Laurette Taylor. I just remember the whole campaign kind of fell flat.\n\nI think the clips from Gamma Rays give us a good idea of what Woodward would’ve been like in Carrie - all wrong. I think as mentioned above, Woodward never had a flair for comedy.\n\nMr and Mrs Bridge is the exact sort of white, upper-crust Merchant/Ivory stuff the Academy eats up (especially around that time - Howard's End was just two years later). Joanne was fabulous, I always remember when she comes into his room singing and trumpeting and then bursts into tears and says 'You are just like your father!!!' when he ignores her enthusiasm. It's a very raw, sensitive performance. I think Huston would have made a more deserving winner, but perhaps the incest put them off. I always found Bates in Misery to be a bit hammy and it's an extremely 'simple' portrayal of what is actually a complex mental illness.\n\nSomeone mentioned The Long Walk Home and I think both Whoopi and Sissi are incredibly underrated in it. When I saw The Help basically copy the entire thing in a more sanitised, cheesy, candy-coloured version and rack up nominations galore two decades later, I felt they were wronged to have missed out for much more sensitive and accurate portrayals. But a lot of Whoopi's dramatic work was snubbed.\n\nIt's crazy that after her Oscar-nommed turn in Summer Wishes Winter Dreams, Joanne only made two theatrical films in the next 12 years. So this is probably the era she missed out on a lot of parts as well. Like Gena Rowlands (another actress nobody except her husband knew what to do with), she found most of her best work in her mid-late career in TV films. Some of them have dated horribly, but the performances haven't, including an Alzheimers one that was clearly the basis for Still Alice (she plays a teacher in it too). I actually would have liked to see her do a movie with Cassavettes, perhaps a double-leading role from her and Rowlands. Without the schmaltz of something like The Turning Point.\n\n[quote] Bates was the dark horse and her win was one of the last genuine surprises at the Oscars\n\nWhen you win the Golden Globe for Best Actress (as Kathy Bates did for Misery) you are NOT The dark horse - you are the front runner.\n\nIt is laughable some posters are trying to rewrite history and write Bates wining the Oscar was a \"come from behind\" win and that Woodward was a contender.\n\nUnless the performance is so unbelievable fantastic and the performance of the year, very few past winners will win again.\n\nLook at Meryl Streep and how many past nominations she had before she won for a second BEST ACTRESS Oscar\n\nWoodward was probably running third, with Huston & Bates neck and neck in the voting."
