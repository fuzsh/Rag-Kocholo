        "text": "8/25: Sunday Morning\n\nGuest host: Seth Doane. In our cover story, Jane Pauley talks with some of the inspiring young women participating in Hoosier Girls State, an exercise in democracy for high school students.

Correspondent Anthony Mason sat down with Keith Richards, Mick Jagger and Ronnie Wood to discuss their unique chemistry; reuniting with the Stones' original bassist Bill Wyman; and what becoming octogenarians meant to Jagger and Richards. (This story was originally broadcast on October 15, 2023.)\n\n08:00\n\nElectric planes: The future of aviation?\n\nCorrespondent David Pogue checks out advances being made in aviation technology that allow a plane to be powered by batteries, promising a more environmentally-friendly, quieter and cheaper ride that may not even require a runway.\n\n07:30\n\nOpera for Peace: A master class for diversity in the arts\n\nBy inviting singers from around the world, the non-profit Opera for Peace hopes to develop greater diversity among performers of opera, and to inspire the next generation of opera audiences. Correspondent Seth Doane talks with African American singer Hannah Jeané Jones, who traveled to Rome to participate in the program; and with soprano Forooz Razavi, who sang with an R&B group in Iran before she fell in love with opera.\n\n05:24\n\nWalden Pond: An endangered treasure\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation has listed Walden Pond and Walden Woods, where Henry David Thoreau wrote his 1854 classic \"Walden,\" one of \"America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places.\" Historian Douglas Brinkley reports on how the Concord, Mass., pond and its surrounding, spiritually-nourishing woods – a storied part of our national heritage – is under threat from nearby development.\n\n02:39\n\nHow handmade rugs are providing a future for Afghans\n\nAfter the Taliban regained power in Afghanistan, education for girls and boys has been a rare commodity in a country where families must make devastating choices in order to guarantee their survival. Correspondent Tracy Smith talks with Nargis Habib, a California entrepreneur who pays artisans in Afghanistan to produce beautiful woven rugs for a price that helps support families' financial freedom.\n\n06:19\n\nDavid Sedaris on talking back to Siri\n\nCommanding your device to do things you could just as well do yourself is a mark of technological progress that humorist David Sedaris finds peculiar, when your voice-activated app is not up to the job.\n\n02:42\n\nNew York City's 92nd Street Y at 150\n\nOne-hundred-and-fifty years ago, New York City's 92nd Street Y was founded as a community and performance center, an inclusive meeting place where people could go to make their lives more meaningful. Correspondent Faith Salie talks with 92NY's CEO Seth Pinsky about its remarkable history, stemming from a simple mission.\n\n05:21\n\nOne bus driver's simple act of kindness\n\nWhen Minneapolis bus driver Jayne Arendt-Verhelst saw a woman, apparently homeless, enter her bus barefoot, she broke a rule in order to help. Correspondent Steve Hartman reports on an act of kindness, as a result of seeing someone too often viewed as invisible.\n\n02:00\n\nGiving wild donkeys a new life\n\nOriginally from Africa, donkeys (or burros, in Spanish) have been in North America for centuries. They were work animals that helped build the West, and today there are thousands of free-roaming donkeys on public lands, where they can overgraze and threaten delicate ecosystems. Correspondent Conor Knighton looks at efforts (such as adoption programs for wild and domestic burros) aimed at giving these social animals a better life.\n\n05:38\n\nYoung coal miners suffering from black lung\n\nCoal mining has always been a dangerous job, with one in every five miners ending up with \"black lung\" disease. But today, in Appalachia, miners are suffering from black lung at increasingly younger ages. \"Sunday Morning\" senior contributor Ted Koppel talks with miners and union officials who say coal companies routinely break the rules that could help protect their employees' health; and looks at a new government proposal that might offer real protection for miners, but which is facing opposition in Congress. (This story was originally broadcast December 10, 2023.)\n\n12:14\n\nThe electric-plane future is about to take off\n\nAdvances being made in aviation technology allow a plane to be powered by batteries, promising a more environmentally-friendly, quieter and cheaper ride that may not even require a runway.\n\n\"Siri, what the heck?\" David Sedaris on talking to one's devices\n\nCommanding your device to do things you could just as well do yourself is a mark of technological progress that humorist David Sedaris finds peculiar, when your voice-activated app is not up to the job.\n\nJames Baldwin at 100\n\nA century after his birth in Harlem, the writer and activist is being celebrated for his visionary work, and for the many facets of his personality – Black, gay, New Yorker, expatriate – that transformed him into an iconic figure in the civil rights movement.\n\nBook excerpt: \"The Fire Next Time\" by James Baldwin\n\nTo celebrate the centenary of the writer, poet and civil rights activist, read his stirring essay \"My Dungeon Shook,\" written as a letter to his young nephew, in which he encapsulates the ironies of race relations in America.\n\nProfiles\n\nThe distinctive voices of Carol Kane\n\nIn her latest film, \"Between the Temples,\" Oscar-nominated actress Carol Kane plays a retired music teacher who is determined to be bat mitzvahed. Kane talks with correspondent Nancy Giles about how her own mother inspired her character; how Andy Kaufman taught her the \"language\" that their characters, Latka and Simka, spoke on the TV series \"Taxi\"; and how, as a student, she resisted the opinion of a doctor who said she should never set foot on stage.\n\n07:20\n\nZoë Kravitz on \"Blink Twice\" and directing fiancé Channing Tatum\n\nZoë Kravitz has been an actress, producer, executive producer, and now, for the first time, a writer-director. She talks with correspondent Michelle Miller about coming from a family of celebrity performers; about her new film, the psychological thriller \"Blink Twice,\" in which she directs her now-fiancé Channing Tatum; and about her attraction to stories of strong women.\n\n06:43\n\nThe journey of rapper-turned-country singer Jelly Roll\n\nThe artist known as Jelly Roll is a 39-year-old former rapper whose songs tell of the troubled life he used to lead. He's now one of the biggest names in country music, with two Grammy nominations this year. With correspondent Kelefa Sanneh, we go with Jelly Roll to one of the jail cells he lived in, where he wrote songs and hatched his plans to make it in music—eventually finding himself on the \"holy ground\" of Nashville's Grand Ole Opry. (This story was originally broadcast on January 7, 2024.)\n\n08:33\n\n\"Wicked\" director Jon M. Chu on his road that led to Oz\n\nThe son of immigrant parents, who immersed himself in American culture growing up, built a career as a filmmaker with hits such as \"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \"In the Heights,\" tapping into his own identity and translating stories of struggle and ambition to the screen.\n\nArts\n\nOpera for Peace: A master class for diversity in the arts\n\nBy inviting singers from around the world, the non-profit Opera for Peace hopes to develop greater diversity among performers of opera, and to inspire the next generation of opera audiences. Correspondent Seth Doane talks with African American singer Hannah Jeané Jones, who traveled to Rome to participate in the program; and with soprano Forooz Razavi, who sang with an R&B group in Iran before she fell in love with opera.\n\n05:24\n\nRecent Features\n\nCrocheting magical gifts for special patients\n\nHolly Christensen, a former oncology nurse, saw how much joy could be brought to young cancer patients and their families when she made a Rapunzel wig out of soft yarn for a friend's daughter undergoing chemotherapy. What began in 2015 as a thoughtful gift has since spun into a national non-profit, the Magic Yarn Project. Volunteers at 10 chapters nationwide transform yarn into character wigs for kids with cancer (or any child dealing with medical hair loss). Correspondent Serena Altschul reports.\n\n05:02\n\nPhotographer Russell Lee's testament to coal miners\n\nWhen coal was king, coal miners risked their lives to fuel America. Photographer Russell Lee captured the hardships and privations (as well as moments of joy) in America's mining communities in the mid-1940s.
