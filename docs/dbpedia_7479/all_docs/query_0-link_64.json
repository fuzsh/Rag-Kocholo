        "text": "The Prowler\n\nThe director Joseph Losey will forever be known for the ambitious films he made in England, with their Royal Academy of Dramatic Art casts and Harold Pinter screenplays: “The Servant” (1963), “Accident” (1967), “The Go-Between” (1970).\n\nBut Losey arguably made his best movies in America, before the blacklist drove him into European exile in 1952. The power games of “The Servant,” centered on a shrewd understanding of sex, class and sadism, are played out with greater psychological and sociological detail in Losey’s second-to-last Hollywood film, “The Prowler” (1951), which has now been issued in a first-class restoration (financed by the Film Noir Foundation and the Stanford Theater foundation, and executed by the U.C.L.A. Film and Television Archive) on a DVD from the independent distributor VCI.\n\nLosey must have already been looking over his shoulder as he shot this independent film, produced by Sam Spiegel and John Huston and starring Huston’s wife at the time, Evelyn Keyes, as a Los Angeles housewife who falls into a deadly affair with an ambitious beat cop (Van Heflin). One of the film’s screenwriters, Dalton Trumbo, had been sent to prison for refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Trumbo’s writing front on “The Prowler,” Hugo Butler, would soon be blacklisted as well.\n\nHeflin, a gifted actor whose tortured, interiorized performances helped pave the way for Method acting in Hollywood, plays an unusually extroverted character here. His Webb Garwood is a smiling sociopath whose belief that he is made for better things is confirmed when he responds to a call from Susan Gilvray (Keyes), who believes she has spotted a peeping Tom in her backyard. With her husband away at work — he’s a late-night disc jockey (his voice, provided by Trumbo, fills the house in his absence) — Susan seems like a golden opportunity for Webb, who has peeked at the couple’s bankbook during his investigation.\n\nFew films of this period show such a stark disdain for institutional authority; fewer still such sexual frankness in portraying the evolution of Webb and Susan’s affair. And the allegorical tendencies that marred Losey’s later films are held in check: “The Prowler” functions perfectly both as a gripping genre picture and a portrait of a society twisted by cruelty and greed. (VCI, $19.99, not rated)\n\nAlice in Wonderland\n\nAfter “Fantasia” (1940) and “The Three Caballeros” (1944), Walt Disney’s “Alice in Wonderland” (1951) completed the studio’s unofficial psychedelic trilogy. Only moderately successful on its first release, the animated “Alice” came into its own with a 1974 reissue that appealed to an audience with an appreciation for hookah-smoking caterpillars and mushrooms that, with a nod to the Jefferson Airplane’s 1967 hit “White Rabbit,” have the power to make you feel 10 feet tall.\n\nAlthough “Alice” was released on DVD last year to take advantage of Disney’s new, live-action version, directed by Tim Burton, the Blu-ray edition is coming out this week, and with its tight definition and accurately rendered colors, it was worth the wait. The film is nothing if not a brilliant showcase for the colorist and designer Mary Blair, one of the great practitioners of midcentury modernism. (Her Sistine Chapel remains the “It’s a Small World” ride at Disneyland.)\n\nBecause of budget cutbacks that diminished the possibility of defining personalities through meticulous, frame-by-frame animation, “Alice in Wonderland” was one of the first Disney features to rely on recognizable celebrity voices to establish characters. But this is surely one of the most accomplished voice casts ever assembled. Apart from the Wagnerian bellowing of Verna Felton’s Queen of Hearts, the film’s creepy, hushed tone can be attributed to the deftly stylized work of Sterling Holloway as the Cheshire Cat and the supremely supercilious Richard Haydn as the Caterpillar, an early texter, who spells out his words — “Who R U?” — as he exhales them. (Disney, Blu-ray/DVD combo edition $39.99, DVD $29.99, G)\n\nWUSA\n\nIt still isn’t much of a movie, but “WUSA” — finally making its debut on home video 40 years after its theatrical release — has acquired the shiny patina of being a genuine cultural artifact. Directed by Stuart Rosenberg (“Cool Hand Luke”) and starring the Brangelina of their day, Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, “WUSA” was a painfully self-conscious attempt to capture the wobbling spirit of a particularly unsteady moment in American history: the post-flower-power morning-after that was 1970. The original posters promoted the film with the regrettable tag line: “Newman/Woodward 1970: A picture for our times.” But there were plenty of other films chasing the spirit of the age that year, including Bob Rafelson’s “Five Easy Pieces,” Robert Altman’s “Brewster McCloud,” John G. Avildsen’s “Joe” and Michelangelo Antonioni’s “Zabriskie Point.”\n\nNewman, his charisma carefully banked behind mirrored sunglasses, plays a mysterious drifter named Rheinhardt who washes ashore in New Orleans, where he tries to put the touch on a fellow smooth-talking con artist (Laurence Harvey as a skid row preacher), acquires a waifish working girl with a metaphorically scarred face (Ms. Woodward) and lands a late-night slot as a disc jockey with the fictional radio station of the title.\n\nSomething sinister is going on at WUSA, or so we gather from the menacing heartiness of the station’s owner, an upscale good ol’ boy played by Pat Hingle. But Rosenberg and his screenwriter, the novelist Robert Stone (adapting his first novel, “A Hall of Mirrors”), seem reluctant to specify the nature of the evil involved, though it involves a lot of red, white and blue bunting. Hanging around the French Quarter boardinghouse where Mr. Cynical Detachment (Newman) and Ms. Naïve Vulnerability (Ms. Woodward) have taken up residence is Mr. Quivering Sensitivity (Anthony Perkins, doomed again to play Norman Bates), a former Peace Corps volunteer who finds that the “welfare survey” he is supposedly conducting among the city’s poor is actually a front for another enigmatic scheme promoted by the bosses of WUSA.\n\nIt all builds — or, rather, meanders — to a political rally-assassination climax that Robert Altman freely plundered (along with much of this film’s condescending attitude toward the South) for “Nashville,” his 1975 attempt to diagnose the sick soul of America. Internally “WUSA” has little coherent to say about the America of the early 1970s, but that Hollywood once considered movies like this to be mainstream commercial material speaks volumes about the social adjustments of the last decades. (Olive Films, $24.95, not rated)\n\nALSO OUT THIS WEEK\n\nLIFE AS WE KNOW IT Josh Duhamel and Katherine Heigl don’t hit it off on their first date, but when fate intervenes to make them the godparents of an orphaned child, they start learning to get along. Greg Berlanti directed, with Christina Hendricks and Josh Lucas. “It’s enough to say that the bland romantic comedy ‘Life as We Know It,’ in which there is not a single deviation from formula, is well made for its corporate type,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times in October. (Warner Home Video, Blu-ray and DVD $28.98, PG-13)\n\nFOR COLORED GIRLS Ntozake Shange’s 1975 play, “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf,” as adapted and directed by Tyler Perry. With Loretta Devine, Kimberly Elise, Whoopi Goldberg, Janet Jackson, Phylicia Rashad, Anika Noni Rose, Kerry Washington and Thandie Newton. “Mr. Perry is, it goes without saying, a maximalist, informed by theatrical traditions (from the church and his stage work on the chitlin’ circuit) and the golden age of Hollywood,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times in November. (Lionsgate, Blu-ray/DVD combo $39.99, DVD $29.95, R)\n\nYOU AGAIN Two generations of high school rivalries break out at a wedding in Andy Fickman’s comedy. With Kristen Bell, Odette Yustman, Sigourney Weaver, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kristin Chenoweth and Betty White. “There is not a laugh to be found in this rancid, misogynistic revenge comedy,” Mr. Holden wrote in The Times in September. (Touchstone, Blu-ray/DVD combo $39.99, DVD $29.99, PG)\n\nMY SOUL TO TAKE Wes Craven, directing from his own script for the first time since 1994, offers the tale of a serial killer who returns to stalk the children of his original victims. With Max Thieriot, Denzel Whitaker, Raúl Esparza and Shareeka Epps. The movie “is a thoroughly dreary, by-the-numbers exercise,” Mike Hale wrote in The Times in October. (Universal, Blu-ray $39.98, DVD $29.98, R)\n\nTAMARA DREWE The director Stephen Frears adapts Posy Simmonds’s graphic novel — a contemporary parody of “Far From the Madding Crowd” — that finds the English countryside settled with a new generation of character types, all obsessed with a returning beauty (Gemma Arterton). This film “plants its cheeky flag at the crossroads of sex farce, pastoral and high literary polish,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times in October. (Sony Classics, Blu-ray $38.96, DVD $28.95, R)"
