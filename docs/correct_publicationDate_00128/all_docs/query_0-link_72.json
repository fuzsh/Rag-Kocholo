        "text": "Description\n\nThe Reality Dysfunction:\n\nIn AD 2600, the human race is finally realizing its potential. The galaxy’s colonized planets host a multitude of diverse cultures. Genetic engineering has defeated disease and produced extraordinary space-born creatures. Huge fleets of sentient trader starships thrive, living on the wealth created by industrializing entire star systems. And throughout inhabited space, the Confederation Navy keeps the peace.\n\nThe Neutronium Alchemist:\n\nA seemingly unstoppable force has entered our universe, and we are confronted by our most primal fear. Those who have succumbed to its horror have acquired godlike powers. Yet their actions are far from divine as they advance from planet to planet, leaving slaughter and mayhem in their wake. The Confederation Navy is dangerously overstretched, as whole worlds fracture and collapse. And a dark messiah prepares to invoke his own version of the final night.\n\nThe Naked God:\n\nThe Confederation is verging on collapse, unable to prevent the enemy from sweeping through the galaxy. And Earth’s defences have finally been penetrated, its giant domed cities destroyed one by one. As time runs out for civilization, those who fight on must join forces and form new alliances – but an enemy’s enemy isn’t always a friend.\n\nTitle\n\nNights Dawn Trilogy 3 Books Collection Set By Peter F. Hamilton\n\nDelivery\n\nContent"
