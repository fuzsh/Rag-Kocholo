Hamilton. This Doorstopper of a series was released as three immense novels in Britain; The Reality Dysfunction (1996), The Neutronium Alchemist (1997) and The Naked God (1999). Each volume was broken into two, slightly more manageable books when it was released in the States; The Reality Dysfunction into Emergence and Expansion, The Neutronium Alchemist into Consolidation and Conflict and The Naked God into Flight and Faith.\n\nThe story is set in the 27th century, after humanity has developed faster-than-light travel through the use of artificial wormholes. Human society has been divided into two cultures that are more or less at peace with each other: Adamists, who are your typical space-going humans separated and diversified by living on a variety of worlds with different governments, economies and ecosystems, and the Edenists, who have genetically modified themselves to allow universal telepathy between each other, and their biotechnological (or bitek) constructs. Both are loosely bound in The Confederation, which also includes two species of sentient aliens (or xenocs).\n\nSome friction exists between Adamists and Edenists, because Edenism's universal use of the \"affinity gene\" has led them to cheat death (sort of) by storing their memories and personalities indefinitely in bitek space habitats, and they are socialists who breed synthetic lifeforms instead of building machines. These practices were condemned by the unified Pope and other religious leaders long ago. In addition, due to the versatility of bitek, Edenists maintain a near-complete monopoly on Helium-3, the fusion fuel used everywhere in human space. Adamists, on the other hand, are far closer to the typical human civilization of space opera, making use of mild genetic engineering to cure diseases and relying on nanotechnology implants to link themselves to their technology and each other. Many conversations in the book take place using this form of technological telepathy (\"datavising\") or the Edenists' form of actual telepathy.\n\nThe dense and multi-threaded plot follows too many characters to note here, but runs the gamut from simple, pre-industrial settlers to the obligatory starship captains, through onto kings of interstellar empires and even the sentient bitek minds of orbital habitats. The story concerns humanity's trials and tribulations when... get this: the souls of the dead begin forcefully possessing the bodies of the living. The premise, while fantastic, is actually treated as a natural (albeit poorly understood) phenomenon, and oddly does not shift this series' place on Mohs Scale of Sci Fi Hardness. As for the novels' SF hardness, space is treated like space while retaining some elements of Space Is an Ocean (like navies and pirates and so forth), and most futuristic technologies are described in believable detail.\n\nThis series is so long and far-reaching that it can't help but run flush up against a million and one SF tropes, in most cases smashing through them, or on the other hand, playing them so straight (and cool) that you'll wonder why they never worked as well before.\n\nThis series includes examples of:[]\n\nAfterlife Antechamber: The Naked God reveals that The Beyond is actually the \"place\" where souls go when they can't accept their death and desire to continue living as they did. The souls have the power to turn wish into reality, but since they are dead they can't interact with the universe, and are stuck in a sort of semi-perceptive limbo, along with uncountable others, and because they still crave the sensations of life, they can only leech on each other's memories for the faint traces of life they contain. The real afterlife is the Omega Point, the final end of the Universe where all souls go to merge with each other and create a new Universe, but going there can only happen if one accepts death and leaves their old existence behind. Everyone else is stuck in the Beyond, taking The Slow Path to the end of the Universe and shrieking in agony all the while.\n\nA God Am I: Quinn Dexter, total goddamn psychopath. Anette Ekelund also has a stab at it.\n\nAint No Rule: Antimatter is horrendously illegal. However, as Joshua Calvert points out, there's no law against having an antimatter drive so long as you never fuel it. He also has a battery of signal masers that can punch a message right through somebody's hull.\n\nAl Capone...IN SPACE!.\n\nAll Crimes Are Equal: Earth's population is so huge, and its cities so desperately overcrowded, any and all crimes with a guilty verdict tend to result in the convict being sent off to be used as manual labor on colony worlds that have just been established.\n\nAll Planets Are Earthlike: Played with. He describes how some terra-compatible planets are not Earth like. Of course in this series Earth is not even Earth like, by our standards.\n\nAntimatter : One of the highest crimes possible is to possess or produce antimatter (via stations orbiting distant stars). Production stations are destroyed on sight, and possessing antimatter carries the death penalty, no exceptions.\n\nWell... mostly no exceptions; a ship is allowed to use antimatter in the save-the-whole-human-race flight across the galaxy.\n\nAnd I Must Scream: Why pretty much everyone is insane in the Beyond: they can just sense the real world, but are never capable of reaching in.\n\nAlso goes for ghosts and whoever has the misfortune of ending up in the Melange.\n\nArtificial Gravity: Averted except for voidhawks & blackhawks; all space habitats rotate. The artificial gravity onboard bitek ships is induced by manipulating of the distortion field they generate for propulsion.\n\nIn the short story \"Escape Route\", the derelict alien ship that Marcus Calvert finds has artificial gravity, and someone remarks on how it would cause a technological revolution and make them filthy rich if they brought it back to Earth. They are forced to blow it up, in the end.\n\nAutomated Automobiles: Almost everyone uses them on the \"civilized\" planets. Described as \"bullets on wheels\" in regards to how fast they are.\n\nAscend to a Higher Plane of Existence: Pretty much every sentient being transcends into energy form upon death (exactly like your priest/guru/rabbi has been saying all along). What happens afterwards, however, is species-dependent. The Ly-cilph hang around, collecting information about everything, while most species go to the Omega Point, or the beyond. Some unlucky ones end up as ghosts or fall into the dark Continuum.\n\nBody Surf: Edenists achieve \"immortality\" by downloading their minds into bitek habitats via affinity on death; they spend a few centuries as disembodied minds before gradually merging with the habitat personality. The B7 people do a body-to-body version, incinerating the old body when they download to a new one. Or, at least, so they thought. The Kiint reveal that a memory construct is different from a soul, and so both all the Edenists that died and the B7 folks (in several versions) are actually busy mind-raping each-other in the Beyond with everyone else.\n\nBond Creatures: This is how bitek and Edenism started.\n\nBorn Lucky: Joshua \"Lagrange\" Calvert. His father, Marcus, features in a side story set some years prior, and he's even luckyer.\n\nBritain Is Only London: This, along with New York, is one of the only Earth arcologies named, mentioned or seen. And you see a heck of a lot more of it than New York. Probably because Hamilton is British, so would focus there.\n\nBrown Note: The Anti-Memory device is basically a computer virus that deletes all memory. The \"computer\" here being the human brain. It is used as a soul-killer weapon against the possessed, killing both the possessing soul and the original host.\n\nOriginally, the technology was used to imprint memories, knowledge and experience into people as a form of fast education, that eventually replaced schools and universities.\n\nChristianity Is Catholic: Eh, sorta, back in the 21st century Christianity formally unified, however most of the Church structure retained a very Catholic feel to it. By the 27th century a person who wished could easily say that Christianity is indeed Catholic in the dictionary sense of the word, Catholic does after all mean \"universal\".\n\nCool Starship - The Lady Macbeth, and the Oenone.\n\nColony Drop - The series starts off with Dr. Alkad Mzu's world, Garissa, being hit by planet cracking antimatter bombs deployed by the Omutan government.\n\nAlso, Quinn Dexter does this on the human colony of Nyvan, as an \"experiment\" in preparation for doing the same to Earth and every other inhabited planet out there.\n\nCorrupt Corporate Executive The rulers of Earth, the 'B7 Security council'\n\nCosmic Horror Story: an interesting variation, but it has all the common elements.\n\nCrapsack World - Earth.\n\nAlso, Nyvan, both before and after Quinn Dexter has his way with it.\n\nCyborg Helmsman: Captains and pilots have large amounts of neural implants for controlling the ship.\n\nDeath From Above:\n\nDemonic Possession IN SPACE!: Except they're not demons, they're the souls of dead humans... which, you know, makes it that much worse.\n\nDepraved Bisexual: Quinn Dexter, and his Satanist cronies. Most Light Bringer adherents are like this, really.\n\nDeus Est Machina / Deus Ex Machina: The Sleeping God\n\nSomeone actually makes a sarcastic remark about military types expecting a deus-ex-machina solution floating in space somewhere.\n\nDomed Hometown - All the cities on Earth are domed, to protect them from the raging 'Aramada storms'. Before they were domed, a farmer's pickup truck was found stuck in the 70th floor of the Sears tower\n\nDoorstopper - About 3200 pages total, plus the 400 page \"A Second Chance At Eden\" short story collection.\n\nEldritch Abomination- The Orgathe are creatures of the Dark Continuum, a realm of near-absolute entropy, where every soul becomes a ghost and everything eventually falls into a central mass of ectoplasm called the Melange, unable to gather enough energy to break loose. The Orgathe can only break free for a short time by forming out of multiple souls; they wander the empty realm, devouring any soul and shred of heat they might encounter until eventually falling back into the Melange. And Dexter tried to bring them all to Earth.\n\nEnergy Beings: The Ly-cilph start life as small fish-like beings on a moon orbiting a humongous gas giant. In three years' time they grow to adult form, a cross between a snail and a deep-sea anemone. They venture on to the ground, and eat the memory fruit left behind by the previous generation of Ly-ciplh; the nodes contain the memories of previous generations, elevating them to sentience. They spend the next 6 years learning and observing the world around them until the 9-year mark, when a periodic flux tube discharge from the gas giant dumps enough energy on the planet for them to Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence, free to roam the Universe forever, gathering knowledge.\n\nAlso, the \"Tinkerbell species\" encountered when the settlement on Ombey is taken to another dimension. They grew bored with the physical Universe and left it seeking something more exciting.\n\nFantastic Religious Weirdness: Of all sorts, given the extreme religious diversity of the Confederation.\n\nFate Worse Than Death- Possession by the souls from the Beyond.\n\nAlso, The Beyond makes people wish that death were permanent.\n\nPeople in the Melange lead a pretty wretched existence as well.\n\nThe Federation - The Confederation. It's not quite as good as it looks at first glance\n\nFirst Contact: it was kind of unimpressive: the Jiciro species were a pre-industrial agrarian civilization when first found. They've recently moved on to steam.\n\nThe actual First Contact was with the Kiint. A human exploratory vessel jumped into their outpost star system and noticed the \"Triad\" of moons orbiting one of the planets in perfect symmetry and balance. It was obviously artificial, so they sent a greeting and offer of friendship to the surface. The answer came less than a minute later, in English: \"YES!\". Turns out that a) that is not the Kiint home planet, but an outpost they had in our galaxy, b) the Triad was an \"old experiment\" (their home system has a large number of habitable planets all sharing the same orbit), and c) they've been watching humanity since around the first century AD through immortal Artificial Human agents.\n\nFridge Brilliance: Michael Saldana secretly gave the Tranquility habitat the ability to perform a huge wormhole jump in case of impending danger, fearing that whatever had destroyed the Laymil might return. Two hundred years later, guess who tried to blow up the place?\n\nFriend to All Living Things / Perfect Pacifist People: The Laymil had elevated themselves to a communal-society level that was universally benevolent and cherished every living thing. The notion of \"weapons\" didn't exist in their culture. During their possession crisis, after their planet got stolen by insane returning Laymil, their space-habitat constellation committed simultaneous mass suicide rather than submit.\n\nGood People Have Good Sex: In Free fall cages. Bad people have devil worshipping rape-sex.\n\nGood Republic, Evil Empire: not as much as you'd expect. The Kulu Kingdom (actually a benign interstellar empire) is the second most powerful Adamist faction (after Earth) and behaves with remarkable competence in handling possession outbreaks on their planets. It doesn't really help them; see the bit about a peninsula vanishing into another dimension.\n\nGray and Gray Morality: Abandoning planets to the Possessed make sense, given the scale of things. Also, the returning spirits aren't universally evil, but most are driven Axe Crazy with lust for life.\n\nThe Kiint eventually reveal that the people trapped in the Beyond are those who are, in some way, deficient in maturity at the time of their deaths (or in some way insane). They dealt with it by giving every single one of their dead who was trapped there a new body and nurturing them until they were ready to leave and go to the Omega Point. Joshua takes a somewhat more DIRECT approach to getting the human souls there.\n\nHeroic Sacrifice - The mercenary team at the end of Reality Dysfunction, who stand their ground to allow the planet's surviving children to be evacuated, in some cases fighting until they are literally torn to pieces.\n\nArguably also Warlow, but somewhat subverted in that he converts to Edenism and uploads his personality at the last second.\n\nHive Mind: The Edenist Consensus is formed via affinity by all sentient beings (humans, habitats, ships) in a star system when a big decision needs to be made.\n\nThe Corpus Kiint is similar. The Laymil also had the permanent \"life-harmony gestalt\" around their planet, formed by multiple space-habitats/satellites linking individual clans and continents together.\n\nHorde of Alien Locusts - The possessed.\n\nHumans Through Alien Eyes: The first time a child Kiint (a super-advanced caterpillar-like species) named Haile sees a human being, its/her thoughts are along the lines of:"
