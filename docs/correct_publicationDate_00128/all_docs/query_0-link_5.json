        "text": "Took Me a While\n\nIt has taking me a while to finish the second book of The Night's Dawn Trilogy. \"The Neutronium Alchemist\" is a tab bit shorter than \"The Reality Dysfunction\", only by less than 50 minutes, but if you are listening over 40 hours in audio, who is counting. I hope that I'm not losing my interest in this series.\n\nThe second book is just as good as the first. Whenever I am reading anything from this author, I need to switch off my other thoughts and be more aware in what is going on in the plot. It's a long one needless to say, but like all of his books, the story goes by quick and it feels like you are reading 10 stories into one.\n\nI'm really enjoying on how Peter F. Hamilton is defining religions in a scientific matter.\n\nReading this series has become a full time job. I can't wait to spend another 40 hours plus overtime in the last and final book of this series.\n\nNight's Dawn universe is still expanding\n\nThe Neutronium Alchemist is Peter F Hamilton's 2nd installment of the Night's Dawn trilogy. Action picks immediately where book 1 finished. Multiple plot lines continue at an accelerated pace. Possession is diffusing throughout various settled worlds and habitats along with dawning realization by the broader community of humanity with various, disparate responses for fighting back. Humanity also learns that at least one other alien race has dealt with this issue (apparently something that all sentient races must experience), but are left with the cryptic advice that their solution will be unique to them. Against this backdrop, the exile physicist from Tranquility makes her move to recover the Alchemist weapon in order to execute her revenge. All the main characters are back, along with hints of a new player similar to the \"watcher\" from book 1, but perhaps a bit more reactive. The tale ends with several cliffhangers, while humanity is teetering on the edge.\n\nThe sci-elements are in line with book 1. The unique piece of tech in book 2 is the Alchemist, a superweapon that has the ability to destroy a star. There is much greater detail revealed about the \"beyond\" where dead souls reside. In addition, another quasi-parallel realm is offered somewhat akin to \"ghosts.\" Of particular note, Hamilton has taken a page from Philip Jose Farmer's Riverworld series (70's sci-fi) where the dead are resurrected on a designed planet, along the banks of the sole river. Specifically, Hamilton inserts Fletcher Christian (from Mutiny on the Bounty fame) and Al Capone (1920's Chicago mobster) who recreates his mob to take over New California and threaten the entire Confederacy.\n\nThe depth and breadth of the storytelling is nearly overwhelming. There are numerous parallels tracks involving multiple characters with a substantial increase in the number of locations with action flipping back at forth willy-nilly. Some as with the deployment of the Alchemist have an edge of the seat feel, while others such as the personal torment of the Skibble family are simply personally tragic. There is also a tremendous variation in the attitudes and actions of the possessed from the vicious and cruel such as the possessed hunting parties on Valisk to the flight to save a few unpossessed children by an unassuming group of possessed, including a Woodstock era hippy.\n\nJohn Lee's narration this time out is even above and beyond his outstanding performance from book 1. The range of characters, gender, ethnic, alien, etc. renditions is unbelievable. At the same time, his delivery, mood, and pacing are perfectly aligned with the overall plot. There are also several instances of comedic interludes and delivery again is flawless. In addition, there are multiple situations where large, mixed groups are conversing and the shifts among gender / ethnic/ historical accents is seamless. As with the first book, the only knock to performance (earning a 4 star rating) has to do with production quality. The continual nonstop shifts in scene should have been signaled with some pause as it sometimes take time (until a distinct individual or location is related) to realize the action has shifted. This is real storytelling (as opposed to simply a novel relating a plot and resolution) at its finest and should be savored, rather than simply worked through."
