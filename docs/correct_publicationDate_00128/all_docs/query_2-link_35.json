        "text": "The Peter F. Hamilton series continues.\n\nThe circa-2000 me deserves some sort of corporal punishment for using the word “trope”. (See Lashing the Wind.) However, I am feeling clement today.\n\nRaw Feed (2000): The Reality Dysfunction, Part 1: Emergence, Peter F. Hamilton, 1996 and The Reality Dysfunction, Part 2: Expansion, Peter F. Hamilton, 1996.\n\nThis is a departure from the usual procedure.\n\nI’m doing two books at once because The Reality Dysfunction, first volume in a massive trilogy, was published as one book in Hamilton’s native Britain. It’s an impressive work.\n\nHamilton fully immerses you in his universe, convinces you of its reality as few others, through sheer mass of detail. Hamilton is the type of author who not only tells you that the streets of poor, grubby colony world Lalonde are covered with crushed rock but what type of rock it is and the economics of how it got there.\n\nIn fact, Hamilton is quite good with the economics of his universe (one suspects, with the near utopia of Tranquility, Hamilton is a laissez-faire man) given the relative stability of a human culture where the technology of affinity bonds (a form of telepathy, remote sensing, and after death survival rationalized by lightspeed communication between minds inhabited by identical strains of engineered bacteria) is off limits to the devout Christians/Islams (the so-called Adamists as opposed to the Edenists who use affinity to grow sentient starships and space habitats) and genetic engineering is an expensive procedure. Nural nanonics (seemingly nanotechnology) allows a manipulation of the human mind and nervous system as if it were a computer system. This leads to all sorts of interesting uses like eidetic recordings of memories, shutting off pain and hormonal influences or simulating them or, as hero Josua Calvert uses it, the prolonging of orgasms.\n\nEconomics aren’t the only thing Hamilton describes in detail; in fact, this first book is so long (about 1,150 pages) that this is one of those few books that could have used a cast of characters or, as E.E. Smith’s Lensman series had, a concordance. In fact, there’s a bit of Doc Smith in the exciting naval battles of this book with their combat wasps (missiles and decoys very much like the missiles/torpedoes and decoys used in aerial and submarine warfare) and lasers and masers and fusion drives and shields of atomic binding energy. It all reminded me of the Traveller game and Jerry Pournelle’s CoDominium, but Hamilton’s vocabulary and techspeak are good enough to make it all, even faster-than-light travel drive by generating wormholes, seem quite convincing, perhaps explaining Gregory Benford’s complimentary blurb.\n\nHamilton’s book has enough to satisfy virtually every science fiction fan since it features so many sf tropes: there is the harsh colonization of new world – Lalonde (a sub-genre not as popular as it used to be unless you count Kim Stanley Robinson’s Mars books); military sf in the naval combat above Lalonde and the combat of mercs and marines on Lalonde; espionage and intrigue as a Confederation agent tries to break up an antimatter smuggling ring; trading in Calvert’s attempt to corner a chunk of the Norfolk Tears trade by the improbable measure of hauling Lalonde wood; a superweapon, perhaps lost, capable of seemingly destroying stars, and the physicist who built it under habitat arrest on Tranquility – until she mounts a brilliant escape by having a starship jump inside the habitat; extinct alien races and their mysterious in the Ruin Ring; romance between Calvert and several women; the peril of several children on Lalonde and the courageous priests who saves them from the returned dead.\n\nHamilton gives detailed descriptions of starships and aliens (four alien races in the novel) and has so many minor characters that an index would have been useful for readers like me who may have forgotten some descriptions.\n\nHamilton’s characters are distinctive – particularly the vividly vicious, scary Satanist Quinn Dexter. Father Horst, Calvert, Warlow, Ashly, Ione Saldana, the dead Shaun Williams are also memorable. This being a first volume in a trilogy, Hamilton introduces conflicts and subplots and resolves some and leaves others hanging. Resolved: the crimes and past of Laton and his final redemption; the rescue of the children on Lalonde. Left hanging: how Alkad Mzu escaped almost certain death 30 years before the main action started and what she intends to do with her superweapon, the Neutronium Alchemist; the whys of the Dead bursting through on Lalonde.\n\nI thought, before reading this novel, that the idea of the dead returning to possess the living would be the weak part of the series, an unrationalized lump in an otherwise convincing, rational, plausible world. While Hamilton explicitly and implicitly reveals some of how the dead can manipulate matter and why they need to physically and/or mentally torture adults before possessing them and what the afterlife is like, he still hasn’t explained why they burst into the universe on Lalonde. It seems to have something to do with the Lyeilph, aliens introduced in the second chapter of part 1. However, that is just a hint, and we don’t know if the dead entering the world was an accidental effect of Lyecilph visiting Lalonde or some kind of experiment deliberately initiated by them. I hope, in later volumes of the series, Hamilton rationalizes the after life and the dead’s return.\n\nI liked this novel a lot and found it an impressive work in size and detail and, in the case of the Edenist technology and nanonics, original."
