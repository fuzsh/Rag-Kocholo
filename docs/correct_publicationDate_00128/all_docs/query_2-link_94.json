        "text": "Tag: Peter Hamilton\n\nLight Chaser – I Can See Paradise?\n\nDespite a rough experience with the Night’s Dawn trilogy, I once again find myself enjoying Peter F. Hamilton’s ability to create worlds. I found myself lured by two of Light Chaser’s promises. One, Light Chaser is a novella instead of a 2000 page epic; and two, he has a co-author, Gareth Powell. I figured why…\n\nContinue reading ➞ Light Chaser – I Can See Paradise?\n\nThe Naked God – A QTL Discussion\n\nWe return with our final installment of our Night's Dawn audio reviews! For those of you still listening, thank you for sticking with us. We know this is a bit out of the ordinary for our content and we are learning a lot. This time we are doing book three, The Naked God, in The…\n\nContinue reading ➞ The Naked God – A QTL Discussion\n\nScience Fiction for 2019\n\n2019 has been a pretty rough year for the world in general, but not for books. It’s hard to turn on the news or walk in the streets without hearing about something terrible going on. People are being beaten down, and while people are finding ways to escape, it’s hard to cope because it’s just…\n\nContinue reading ➞ Science Fiction for 2019\n\nThe Neutronium Alchemist – A QTL Discussion\n\nWe are back with another audio discussion. This time we are doing book two, The Neutronium Alchemist, in The Night's Dawn trilogy, by Peter Hamilton. You can find the spoiler-free written review here: Neutronium Alchemist review. The goal of this discussion is to dive a little deeper into the book to better explore what makes them good,…\n\nContinue reading ➞ The Neutronium Alchemist – A QTL Discussion\n\nThe Neutronium Alchemist – Hotter Than A Dying Sun\n\nI am back with installment two of our collective journey through the strange abyss that is Peter F. Hamilton’s The Night’s Dawn Trilogy. If you have absolutely no idea what I am talking about, the staff of QTL is doing a collective read and discussion of this iconic sci-fi trilogy. However, the discussions have a…\n\nContinue reading ➞ The Neutronium Alchemist – Hotter Than A Dying Sun\n\nThe Reality Dysfunction – A QTL Discussion\n\nAs I mentioned back in my Reality Dysfunction review, we are trying something a little different this year. Here is the first of a series of audio discussions that we will be putting up on the site. The goal is to dive a little deeper into some books to better explore what makes them good,…\n\nContinue reading ➞ The Reality Dysfunction – A QTL Discussion\n\nThe Reality Dysfunction – Patience Is A Virtue\n\nThe writers of The Quill to Live are undertaking a small project this year - we are reading a book series as a group and recording an audio discussion for each installment. The series in question is The Night’s Dawn Trilogy by Peter Hamilton. The books, starting with The Reality Dysfunction, are absolutely massive, clocking…\n\nContinue reading ➞ The Reality Dysfunction – Patience Is A Virtue\n\nA Night Without Stars – Predictably Excellent\n\nIn some ways there is very little point in reviewing a Peter Hamilton book. When it comes to his novels, people fall into three groups: those who have read him and love him, those who have read him and hate him, and those who have never read him. As there is little point in talking…\n\nContinue reading ➞ A Night Without Stars – Predictably Excellent"
