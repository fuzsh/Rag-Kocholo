        "text": "Book 2 in The Night's Dawn Trilogy\n\nContinuing where The Reality Dysfunction left off. We find that the possessed have spread out from Lahore across the Confederation. Book two in the Night's Dawn Trilogy continues this huge Space Opera story that covers the lives of many different people on different plants who's lives are being changed by the discovery of a block of data from a long lost civilization that no one is sure happened to them. Peter F. Hamilton is perhaps one of the best authors I have found who writes these sweeping stores that seem to work out in the end and make a lot of sense. Once again If you can handle the 1100+ pages this book offers it is a very good read. But keep in mind this is only book 2 in the Trilogy and if you have not read the first book then you MUST not read this one, it will only confuse you if you do. Look forward to the Naked God, the final book in the trilogy.Read full review\n\nThe second installment of the three part space opera..\n\nGreat sequel to the Reality Dysfunction (These books must be read in order to make sense to the reader; 1-Reality Dysfunction, 2-Neutonium Alchemist, 3-The Naked God). Hamilton creates a believable future with believable characters and events surrounded by a thought provoking plot. For Science Fiction enthusiast this is a must read series that contains all the elements that make science fiction enjoyable. The casual way Hamilton creates the future and the people along with their everyday \"appliances\" make this series flow smoothly, creating an environment which the reader can truly immerse themselves in. All readers will enjoy."
