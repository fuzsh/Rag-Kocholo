        "text": "Lets review: Tamiya’s 1996 Porsche 911 GT1 kit is mostly accurate, and concisely engineered. The 2 sides of the transmission each represent 6 or 7 pieces from the actual car, and the top and final drive piece also includes the rear suspension bulkhead, six space-frame tubes, rear suspension rocker bases and two adjustment knobs for the external shock absorber reservoirs.\n\nBut a few of the things provided aren’t quite what you see in pictures of the real thing. And a number of things in the pictures aren’t in the kit. In describing the kit I touched on The cooling air ducts for the rear brakes, and the breather catch tank.\n\nRear Brakes Cooling Air Scoops and Ducts:\n\nThe back of the scoop and ducts need to be made or bought. They should look like\n\nnaked .jpg URL: Displays image in moderate size, click takes one through to it. Maybe add height and width, or just one as part of this?\n\nLink to a jpg URL: Displays the URL, not the thing the URL points to. Not worth it.\n\nhttps://www.ultimatecarpage.com/images/car/3174/Porsche-911-GT1-48904.jpg\n\nImage of a jpg URL: Displays a really large image, click does NOT link through. Big, but not worth it.\n\nnaked .HTML URL: Doesn’t display image. Can be clicked through.\n\nhttps://www.ultimatecarpage.com/img/Porsche-911-GT1-48904.html\n\nhttps://www.ultimatecarpage.com/img/Porsche-911-GT1-124487.html\n\nhttps://www.ultimatecarpage.com/img/Porsche-911-GT1-124486.html\n\nCatch Tank:\n\nThe catch tank can be re-worked to fix the shape problem. So lets start with what can be fixed or re-worked. Then the missing bits that need to made or found.\n\nThe catch tank should look like this: Rectangular. Top 2 pictures.\n\n//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\n\nIf you haven’t seen Renaissance Model’s reference pages you’re in for a treat:\n\nRM galerie de details:\n\nhttps://www.renaissance-models.com/galerie_de_details.htm\n\nRM Front Page:\n\nhttps://www.renaissance-models.com/francais.htm\n\nThe front page is French/English, deeper in, French only.\n\nBrake Disks\n\nThe carbon brake disks (380 mm diameter 37mm thick) are ventilated, by\n\nround holes on straight radial lines. Rotating cutter? Formed by tooling? They follow a two-holes, space, one hole, space, two-holes pattern. My guess, 10 sets of 3.\n\nIn a picture showing < 180 degrees I count 14 holes. 2 X 14 = 28, but 28/3 is 9 1/3, not an even pattern. Symmetry around the disk seems likely to be important. The smallest number greater than 28 that is evenly divisible by 3 is 30.\n\n//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\n\nThink of the 1 hole-space-2 holes-space pattern as 5 points, 3 of which are holes, 2 of which are not. 0-00- so the disc goes: 0-00-0-00-0-00-…If 10 sets of 3 holes, is right, 360 degrees/50 points = 7.2 degrees/point. 5 points = 36 degrees, 360/10.\n\nBrembo’s web site:\n\nhttps://www.brembo.com/en/company/news/formula-1-vs-lemans-2018\n\nhttps://www.brembo.com/en/company/news/formula-1-vs-lemans-2018\n\nlists 36 as the minimum number of cooling holes for GT1 brakes, in 2018.\n\nRobert Muschitz’s marvelous photo:\n\nRobert M again:\n\n//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\n\nBrake disk calipers.\n\nBrake disk calipers should have open backs, through which the pads should be seen. The kit parts have closed backs, but can be filed down to shape to expose the disk, and the pads, same radius. Mind you file for a curve.\n\nA cardboard template from the rest of the disc would help. A brass-colored brace connects the two halves, at the back. Something to make, but not much. Stretched parts-tree polystyrene, metal wire, or mechanical pencil “lead” will suffice. Two “U” shaped wire bails cross the gap behind the pads and across the disk. Small steel wire, mini staples?\n\nThe wheels cover this area, but if you want to back off a wheel (or more) for an informal pose, some time on the backs of the calipers will be rewarded.\n\nThis should be a link:\n\n<a href=\"http:////embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js” target=”_blank”>Frame Grab from Callas RennSport Rohr yellow car front brake caliper” https://www.flickr.com/photos/wbaiv/50231600796/\n\nThis should be an image but not a link\n\nThis should also be an image but not a link\n\nThe real thing:\n\nCold air to turbo inlet pipes.\n\nTamiya provide part A32, connected to the roof air scoop, with left and right takeoffs going to the turbo-compressors and the center going down through the air to air inter-cooler. Unfortunately, the two turbo-bound pipes on Tamiya’s part have a flat bottom, simplifying the mold, but changing the cross section of the pipe. Straight lines that should be curves are eye-catching.\n\n//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\n\nThese photos show how it should look.\n\nhttps://www.ultimatecarpage.com/img/Porsche-911-GT1-48904.html\n\nhttps://www.ultimatecarpage.com/img/Porsche-911-GT1-48905.html\n\nhttps://www.ultimatecarpage.com/img/Porsche-911-GT1-48906.html\n\nhttps://www.ultimatecarpage.com/img/Porsche-911-GT1-604.html\n\nhttps://www.ultimatecarpage.com/img/Porsche-911-GT1-124486.html\n\nhttps://www.ultimatecarpage.com/img/Porsche-911-GT1-14936.html\n\n12436\n\nhttps://i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5178/5418668794_fd7cc82416_b.jpg\n\nEmphasize Division Between The Left and Right Inter-cooler Outputs.\n\nTamiya supply a single piece for both intercoolers, the ducts that take their outputs to the sides and the plenum “log”s that feed the throttle and injector for each cylinder. The division between the ducts on the two sides aren’t as clear as photos suggest:\n\nhttps://www.ultimatecarpage.com/img/Porsche-911-GT1-603.html\n\nhttps://www.ultimatecarpage.com/img/Porsche-911-GT1-14936.html\n\nRemove One or Both Pairs Of Shock Reservoirs.\n\nTamiya provides a pair of shock reservoirs attached to the sides of the final drive. And a second pair attached atop the rear anti-roll bar housing. One place or the other was common for different cars at different times. Some shock reservoirs are seen attached to the diagonal tubes from the top of the transmission to the rear suspension bulkhead.\n\nOther cars, other times, reservoirs are on top of the final drive housing, or on either side of the back end of the transmission. Or asymmetrically disposed somewhere across two of the places listed. There is clearly the potential for a table showing where the reservoirs were and whether gray metallic painted reservoirs and shock bodies, or red metallic paint painted sets were used. And what color for the springs. Indexed by chassis number and markings. More opportunities to excel!\n\nGT1 109, gray metallic, reservoirs on diagonal tubes. Metallic / stainless braid hoses and banjo fittings. Glossy black springs. Glossy black three-bolt top of the spring. Black-red-black lower end stop.\n\nhttps://www.ultimatecarpage.com/img/Porsche-911-GT1-14936.html\n\nGT1 104 Gray metallic, reservoirs on either side of the final drive. Aluminum colored cloth heat reflective wrap on hoses. Glossy, slightly darker red springs. Blue anodize banjo fittings. Black + silver / gold metallic three-bolt top of the spring.

Metallic braided hose or braid-like cloth.Semi-gloss black spring. White (silver) metallic banjo fittings.

Black rubber/vinyl hoses. Glossy dark red spring. White (silver) metallic banjo fittings. Dark Gray / Gray Blue anodize on cone-shaped top of spring. Black-black-black lower end stop.\n\nThis is the same text as a page I just constructed, but will be more easily found this way. Still figuring out how to format long form information.\n\nTamiya’s Porsche 911 GT1 represents the first year, 1996, factory racing cars that finished 1st and 2nd in the GT1 class, at Le Mans. This excellent debut was slightly bittersweet, the overall winner was a Porsche, but the previous generation, the 1995 World Sportscar Championship Prototype that Porsche had developed with Tom Walkinshaw Racing. but hadn’t raced. Long term Porsche customer Joest Racing borrowed the Prototype from the Porsche Museum, used the 962 engines they were familiar with, and beat the factory team! They would repeat this performance in 1997 as well.\n\nStill, the 1996 GT1s did finish better than the McLaren F1s and every other manufacturer, as they were designed to do. Toyota, Nissan, Lister and Chrysler/Dodge GT1 efforts all came to naught, Mercedes Benz followed Porsche’s lead and produced purpose-built racing cars justified by a single streetable example. Porsche responded in kind, the factory team winning Le Mans overall in 1998 with their GT1 motor in a carbon-fiber Mk II chassis, while Mercedes Benz won most of the races other than Le Mans. The GT1 class was discontinued.\n\n23 street versions of the 911 GT1 were built and sold to civilians, and apparently two of the customer racing cars were made street legal during recent restorations. So the idea of a road car that could compete at Le Mans wasn’t completely wrong.\n\nTamiya’s kit is molded in white, black and “chromed”, with an extensive decal sheet for the exuberant Mobil 1 sponsorship markings. Besides the 1996 factory Le Mans cars 002 and 003, and the bare carbon-fiber test mule 001, it can be marked as all but one of the customer racing cars, which were delivered with the first year bodywork. Only the last customer car was built with the 1997 “Evo” body, though most (but not all) were later converted for better aerodynamics. “Evo”s can be recognized by their 911 (996) / Boxter common form headlight and turn signal assemblies. The Rohr team were notably successful with their round-headlight GT1 in yellow, as were the G-Force / Blue Coral team with their dark blue with black and yellow trim on chassis 101. Chassis 101 was originally in dayglo red and white, for cigarette sponsorship. Chassis 104 enjoys Larbre Compétition‘s busy FATurbo markings with round headlamps.\n\nThe kit has 21 construction steps, the first 9 for the engine, transmission and rear suspension, with 45 parts and 2 decals. 5 more steps (11-14 and 16), cover all 22 parts of the interior / driver’s compartment, except the 6 of the roof duct, body shell and clear parts. Step 10 creates the front suspension, mounted on the front carbon fiber undertray. Along with the interior, step 11 crosses the length of the underside of the car, includes fixing the undertray and front suspension to the lower front chassis, adding radiator, nose air intake, and adding pivots for the engine cover. Step 12 adds powertrain and rear suspension to the chassis, behind the firewall. Step 15 is a pure play in paint and decals for the wheels, and slipping the tires on them. The last 5 steps, 17-21, build the body shell. A separate sheet shows how the Mobil 1 decals cover the body, most to be applied between steps 19 and 20. Other decals are applied in 9 other steps.\n\nThe decal sheet has 60 numbered images, and the kit has 132 parts, including a stretched part-tree radio antenna, 4 soft tires (with maker’s markings) and 4 soft-plastic “Poly caps” that pins molded inside the wheels plug into. Masks are provided to simplify painting the edges of the windshield and door windows semi-gloss black.\n\nA clear body version was released later, but only front and rear body shells are clear, the aft edges of the front fenders, lower aft of the rear fenders, and rear fender air scoops are all white plastic. The roof scoop underside and single horizontal splitter are black plastic.\n\nThe crankcase, cylinders, and lower head, (intake and exhaust ports) are 2 pieces, split top and bottom, with reasonable molded-on top-of-engine coolant plumbing. The transmission case is split left and right, with a third piece for the top of the case, and final drive. Each bank of 3 cylinders has a separate cam box, intake and exhaust manifolds, exhaust and compressor turbines with restrictor air box, waste gate and bypass, exhaust tailpipe and tip, and compressed air pipe to the intercoolers. The two intercoolers and intake “logs” are a single piece shared by both sides, as is the air intake for the inter-coolers and turbo-compressors, and the engine front serpentine belt pulleys with oil and water header tank. The alternator, 3 piece oil tank and a mysterious small radiator behind the driver’s seat, complete the purely “engine” parts.\n\nThe talented part A34, the transmission top plate, concisely incorporates four space-frame “tubes” along a horizontal line, that link to horizontal “tubes” in the frame molded in relief on the back of the firewall. They are really solid rods, but representing tubes on the real car. Indulge me. Another 2 tubes molded in the same part, carry the space frame back to the top of the transmission, and support the rear suspension spring and shock rockers. The broad, vertical, “bulkhead” that carries suspension loads directly to the space frame, first seen in the 956, are also included in part A34. Two additional “V” shaped tube pairs, A25 and A26, join vertical tubes in the frame on the back of the fireall, complete the 3d linkage of firewall tube frame and the rear suspension bulkhead.\n\nIts probably a kindness that all this complexity is molded into one plastic part. Consider a loose bulkhead linked to the firewall by 4 loose V shapes. Not unlike building biplanes with wings and struts, and no 3D structures. Possible, but difficult. Nicer if the struts are long enough and strong enough to hold the wings in a fixed relationship. And absolutely depending on the geometry of the holes in the wing. Count on using the chassis bottom as tooling to hold the firewall and transmission in perfect alignment while the space frame to firewall joints are drying. Put plastic wrap or wax paper on the tray under the engine, and where the firewall would glue to the driver’s floor re-enforcement.\n\nThe rest of the rear suspension is equally concise, one piece for lower “A” arms. one piece for the upper parallel links, with a diagonal brace. The rear suspension push rod, rocker and spring/shock absorber are one piece for each side. Two sets of external shock absorber reservoirs are provided, one pair molded on the anti-roll bar cover and a second pair molded at the top front of the final drive, with ajustment knobs as part of A34. The drive shafts are integral with half the rear hub. A separate “other half” makes a full hub, which locks between the lower and upper suspension arms and plus into the transmission final drive.\n\nStructure is similarly concise: The tube frame that braces the exhaust pipes, contains the breather catch tank, holds both the air-jack connection point, supports the access for the externally adjustable anti-roll bar and serves as the lifting eye for the back of the car is 2 pieces, and a little bas-relief on the catch-tank, which is integral with the 2 sides of the transmission.\n\nThe radiator is supplied, the guide vanes for hot air that exits through the trunk lid, and the air intake in the nose, with lifting eye. But nothing else from inside the front body shell is provided. No radiator exhaust duct, front brake cooling ducts, stock 993 front chassis sheet metal, fuel cell and filler/vent hardware, or any of the fiddly suspension or fuel system bits.\n\nThe “chromed” parts should mostly be painted bare metal- aluminum for the air intakes, stainless steel for the exhaust. No clues are provided for the extensive hoses and cables that should dress the engine and transmission, the instruments, console controls and passenger seat area. A few details are wrong or misunderstood, but most detail is correct. There’s just a lot isn’t present.\n\nThe ugliest problem built into the kit as the inside of the rear brake cooling air scoops. It should be a large, rectangular cross section air duct on each side. Instead, there’s a bizarre and inaccurate insert that makes a 90 degree turn in the airflow, then very odd “duct work” that assembles to join the 90 degree bend with a hard, white, plastic piece representing the “soft duct” that connects to the cooling air director on the rear hub. The soft pieces can be used The ducts and scoop fittings should not be used.\n\nThe next inaccurate detail is the catch tank. Its provided as a parallelogram, fore and aft edges parallel, top and bottom faces parallel, corners between them more or less than 90 degrees. The actual part is a rectangle, I’ve photographed it, its a translucent blow-molding, with a 930- (911 Turbo) part number and can be seen easily in engine compartments from 917s to 962s.\n\nAfter that, the sins are mostly omission. Few of the cables and pipes/hoses in the engine compartment are provided or suggested, except for a bas relief drain tube on the catch tank. and an oil-return among the top-of-engine coolant plumbing. None of the cables in the passenger side of the cockpit.are provided or suggested. No engine management box, no Bowden cable from accelerator to throttle butterfly valves. No computer or power connector. One fuel filter is on one intake manifold, but not the other, and the suggested injector rail and hoses are very poor and small.\n\nAmong the not so surprising list of searches that brought people to my blog, yesterdays list (below) included one dear indeed to my heart: “1/32 model airplanes with working retractable landing gear”\n\nAh yes, the great divide. Are we building scale models or toys? I come down firmly on the “toys” side, although many fine people I know personally are probably closer to scale modelers. I have to admit that almost any working feature of a model, particularly from a plastic kit, is going to compromise accuracy to some extent. Turning and propellers, wheels, maybe not so much. Opening doors, hatches? Mmmm, tricky. Retractable landing gear? Almost never truely ‘in scale’, but it HAS been done.\n\nPersonal experiences with working, retractable, landing gear:\n\n1/32 Revell Supermarine Spitfire Mk I. Moving control surfaces and sliding canopy too.\n\n1/32 Monogram North American P-51D Mustang. In “Phantom Mustang” or P-51 or F-51 form, this kit has retractable main gear and a tail wheel that are all actuated by turning a wheel on the belly. For the Phantom kit, an electric motor and gear train does the work. For the non-Phantom releases, the gear fixed to the plane becomes a knob to turn. Also comes with sliding canopy and bomb releases (again, under the belly for the controls in the pylon that the Phantom kit mounts on.)\n\n1/32 Tamiya Mitsubishi A6M Riesen “type Zero” fighter. Tiny super-strong magnets are said to hold the moving pieces in place, and there’s a hidden socket for a crank to operate the gear… or so I have read.\n\n1/32 Revell Grumman F4F-4 Wildcat. Not only retractable, the complex multi-link F3F and F4F setup that brought the wheels up to sit flush with the lower sides of the fuselage. I keep meaning to buy one of these and see how well it works…\n\n1/32 planes that do NOT have working retractable landing gear:\n\n1/32 Revell Hawker Hurricane I or “II” (its not a II and would take much effort- buy a 2 hand copy of the original Mk I kit if you want one of these…)\n\n1/32 Revell Hawker/BAe Harrier / AV-8A. If I’d been in charge… but I wasn’t. Not retractible. The Airfix 1/24 kits has retractible gear, but other issues.\n\n1/32 Revell Bristol Beaufighter. Alas, this would be a good place for a home-made setup, dead easy, but not the way they made the kit. Very much tooled to a price, with just about nothing in the fuselage (and no way to see it…) Still how cool is it to have this?!\n\nYesterday’s search terms.\n\nx-4 bantam cockpit 2\n\nlight gull grey acrilico 2\n\nislader 1/72 2\n\npolly scale paints 2\n\ntamiya u.s. interior green mix 2\n\nthinning vallejo 26.526 1\n\nmosquito de interior 1\n\nhow to dull the finish of a plastic model? 1\n\ntrislander 1\n\npaint striper for plastic models 1\n\neclipse tptp vs netbeans profiler 1\n\nwater based model paint 1\n\nbac 707 gray 1\n\nhawk 75 cutaway 1\n\nhow long does it take to build plastic models 1\n\ndiluting water based paint for glaze 1\n\nhow to mix model paints 1\n\nhobby shops in san francisco 1\n\n“…the place god calls you to is the place where your deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger meet.” -frederick buechner 1\n\nxf-56 1\n\ntamiya spray paint solvents 1\n\nfuture floor wax remover 1\n\nbuilding plastic model links 1\n\nr/c car store in bay area 1\n\nmosquito fuselage 1\n\nelo easy lift off 1\n\nsbd-5 camouflage 1\n\nmosquito instrument panel 1\n\npolly scale model railroads paints 1\n\nairplanes painted black 1\n\nwho bought out hobby enterprises model airplane kits 1\n\ndeionized water acrylic paints 1\n\nrc cars in bayarea 1\n\n1/32 model airplanes with working retractable landing gear 1\n\nLets talk about Mosquito cockpit photos on the web:\n\nFirst, credit where credit is due:\n\nhttp://www.mossie.org is a GREAT web site and this first group of photos are found there, and taken by Phil Broad, to whom we are all indebted!\n\nhttp://www.mossie.org/Phil_Broad/Phil_Broad_Collection.htm\n\nhttp://www.mossie.org/images/Phil_Broad/RS709_det/GMOS-10.jpg\n\nThis color picture looks b&w- only the dark red, wheel-shaped, handle for the landing gear shows that this really is a color picture. The bomb-bay hydraulic control in this cockpit has a white knob, the flap handle is black. THe interior gray-green on the inside of the fuselage shell just looks gray. The hydraulic control levels are bare metal- plated steel, stainless steel or aluminum. The handles on the magneto switches look like bare aluminum.\n\nhttp://www.mossie.org/images/Phil_Broad/RS709_det/GMOS-11.jpg Looking down at the rudder pedals. The rudder pedal yokes and foot rests are black. The bare metal (probably plated or polished) twin hand pump for canopy de-icing system is visible, and the handles on the pump rods seem to be something more than just bare metal.\n\nhttp://www.mossie.org/images/Phil_Broad/RS709_det/GMOS-12.jpg Engine instruments, ventilator outlet, three knobs probably associated with dimmers, a white paper in a holder (Compass deviation card?)\n\nThe inner (right side) engine and propeller knobs are just visible- on this airplane they are shiny black with a large, whilte “P” which I take to mean Propeller (ie “Pitch”)\n\nhttp://www.mossie.org/images/Phil_Broad/RS709_det/GMOS-13.jpg\n\nThe prop feathering buttons are black and white, diagonal-striped,with small red markers in the middle. At the center-bottom, somewhat out of focus, you can see the Observer’s Oxygen Economizer, a black box- bakelite perhaps. with a light color (paper or aluminum) plate in the middle. The oxygen hose is dark gray or black, with light highlights or possibly a light color on the external spring wrapping. The grab handle above the passage to the nose compartment is light in this picture,\n\nhttp://www.mossie.org/images/Phil_Broad/RS709_det/GMOS-14.jpg\n\nAlmost everything is black with white details, and interior gray-green. In this view, the color details are the red covers on the two buttons for the IFF self-destruction equipment. and the red handle on the forward (ie left or port) radiator flap control. The destruct buttons are at the front edge of the big electrical box\n\nhttp://www.mossie.org/images/Phil_Broad/RS709_det/GMOS-15.jpg\n\nMore Observer’s sidewall and black boxes, black and white instruments, black cable wraps, bare metal connectors for the big cables, switch levers, etc. The forward (left/port) radiator flap control lever is red with a dark yellow knob, the aft (right/starboard) radiator flap control has a white lever with a dark yellow knob.\n\nhttp://www.mossie.org/images/Phil_Broad/RS709_det/GMOS-16.jpg Pilot’s sidewall alongside the pilot’s seat. Mostly gray-green fuselage shell interior, with a black engine and propeller control box, black electrical boxes, black, white and gray wires and cables,, black and dark red placards (anodized?) The smaller black metal bit, aft, is the pilot’s intercom connection, there’s a dark reddish-brown covered receptacle hanging on a small cable from the nest of cables under the black metal piece. The clip at the front edge looks like its for the receptacle.\n\nThe larger electrical box is no remote radio channel push button selector.\n\nThere may be a dark red/brown center on the electrical control knob mounted just about the pilot’s armrest. I suspect the straight black tube mounted at the top of the sidewall, just below the canopy, is for the Bowden cable that leads from the rudder trim control (above the center of the instrument panel) back to the rudder trim tab\n\nhttp://www.mossie.org/images/Phil_Broad/RS709_det/GMOS-17.jpg\n\nSame area as GMOS-16 but from above..Its easier to see what things are and how they work from a higher perspective\n\nhttp://www.mossie.org/images/Phil_Broad/RS709_det/GMOS-18.jpg\n\nLooking down onto the engine and propeller control box, control yoke “Carbon Mic” hookup, pitch trim indicator, etc. Part of the engine instruments too. Placards, brackets, gauges, throttle box, levers, cockpit lights, etc, all black. Cockpit sidewall interior gray-green. Dark brown center on knob that’s probably a lighting dimmer.\n\nhttp://www.mossie.org/images/Phil_Broad/RS709_det/GMOS-19.jpg\n\nLooking aft at observer’s seat (a nice, dark brown shiny upholstery with modern belts, and no armor plate. Not exactly authentic 1940s. All structure interior gray-green, black panel for fuel cocks and engine cutouts. Fuel cock handles are black, cutout buttons are red. Black receptacle for observer’s headphones, hanging on a medium brown cable. Large multi-wire cables along observer’s side wall are covered in a glossy black material.\n\nhttp://www.mossie.org/images/Phil_Broad/RS709_det/GMOS-20.jpg\n\nLooking straight up at the canopy roof escape hatch- canopy metal framework is all interior gray-green inside, except for the actual hatch, which has a black frame, and the canopy frames that the hatch touches, which are all yellow.\n\nhttp://www.mossie.org/images/Phil_Broad/RS709_det/GMOS-21.jpg\n\nLow angle of pilot’s seat and sidewall. All seat structure is black, with black or very dark cushions. In this picture the engine supercharger instructions placard looks distinctly brown. Root Beer color. Photo-flash intense light and age are the likely cause.\n\nhttp://www.mossie.org/images/Phil_Broad/RS709_det/GMOS-22.jpg\n\nIn bomb aimer’s station, looking forward, out the nose transparency. Everything is interior gray-green protective paint, except clear windows, a black rubber hose carrying dry air to the sandwich-construction bombardier’s “flat” window.\n\nhttp://www.airmuseumsuk.org/museum/dhaircraft/800/images/012%20DH.98%20Mosquito%20B35%20cockpit.jpg\n\nA pretty nicely restored B-35 cockpit. The condition of the trim wheel at the bottom of the column that supports the pilots instruments shows why I think this is a restoration. So its nice and clean and you’d like to hope the colors are mostly original, cleaned up, or touched-up/repainted with originals as references.\n\nhttp://www.airmuseumsuk.org/museum/dhaircraft/800/pages/011%20DH.98%20Mosquito%20B35%20cockpit.htm\n\nA nice view up past the pilot’s seat, showing the vacuum system control, details of the seat and its mounting to the bulkhead.\n\nhttp://www.airmuseumsuk.org/museum/dhaircraft/800/pages/013%20DH.98%20Mosquito%20B35%20cockpit.htm\n\nHere’s the pilot’s sidewall, showing trim indicator, engine and propeller controls, misc.. stuff.\n\nhttp://www.mosquitorestoration.com/index.shtml\n\nKA114\n\nhttp://www.mosquitorestoration.com/cmscontent/Image/Gallery02/Large%20images/Cockpit%20Box%20B%20KA114.jpg\n\nThis is a recently ( 2005) built fuselage in New Zealand, the second they produced. This electrical box looks very much like the photographs of 1940s production Mosquitos. I say we give them credit for getting the colors right, just as they so clearly got the shapes right.\n\n<a href=”http://www.mosquitorestoration.com/cmscontent/Image/Gallery02/Large%20images/Fuse%20@%20Avspecs.jpg”&gt;\n\nhttp://www.mosquitorestoration.com/cmscontent/Image/Gallery02/Large%20images/Fuse%20@%20Avspecs.jpg\n\n<a href=”http://www.mosquitorestoration.com/cmscontent/Image/Gallery02/Large%20images/Nose%20browning%20doors%20off%20KA114.jpg”&gt;\n\nhttp://www.mosquitorestoration.com/cmscontent/Image/Gallery02/Large%20images/Nose%20browning%20doors%20off%20KA114.jpg\n\nThis is a fighter-bomber (F Mk-26, XXVI) fuselage, with a slightly different rudder pedal box than the bomber version.\n\nNZ2308 – a T Mk 43\n\n<a href=”http://www.mosquitorestoration.com/cmscontent/Image/Gallery08/Large%20Images/Copy%20of%20Instrument%20panel.jpg”&gt;\n\nhttp://www.mosquitorestoration.com/cmscontent/Image/Gallery08/Large%20Images/Copy%20of%20Instrument%20panel.jpg\n\n<a href=”http://www.mosquitorestoration.com/cmscontent/Image/Gallery08/Large%20Images/Copy%20of%20P1000973.jpg”&gt;\n\nhttp://www.mosquitorestoration.com/cmscontent/Image/Gallery08/Large%20Images/Copy%20of%20P1000973.jpg\n\nThis is a refurbished instrument panel, hydraulics, etc, from NZ2308\n\n<a href=”http://www.mosquitorestoration.com/cmscontent/Image/Gallery08/Large%20Images/Bomb%20switch%20panels%20&%20elect.%20boxes.jpg”&gt;\n\nhttp://www.mosquitorestoration.com/cmscontent/Image/Gallery08/Large%20Images/Bomb%20switch%20panels%20&%20elect.%20boxes.jpg\n\nThe left side of this picture shows the bomb switch panels\n\n<a href=”http://www.mosquitorestoration.com/cmscontent/Image/Gallery08/Large%20Images/Original%20WT%20transmitter,%20reciever,%20VHF.jpg”&gt;\n\nhttp://www.mosquitorestoration.com/cmscontent/Image/Gallery08/Large%20Images/Original%20WT%20transmitter,%20reciever,%20VHF.jpg\n\nOriginal radio transmitter and reciever.\n\n<a href=”http://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/aviation.html “>http://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/aviation.html\n\nPhillip Treweek has hundreds of very, very nice images of historic airplanes- from in flight to in the bilges. Civil and military, new and old. Replica Fokker Dr-1s to F-111s and F/A-18s, major airliners.\n\n<a href=”http://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/mosquito.html “>http://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/mosquito.html\n\nPhilip Treweek’s photos:\n\nNZ2305 F 40 converted to T-43, sold from Oz to NZ\n\n<a href=”http://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/pages/motadh98.html”&gt;\n\nhttp://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/pages/motadh98.html\n\nNZ2328 FB6.\n\n<a href=”http://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/pages/fmead13.html “>\n\nhttp://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/pages/fmead13.html\n\nNot hugely restored, photo looking aft from entrance. Cockpit is partially stripped, partially disassembled. Dirty gray-green. Intercom and related electrical stuff black with grey/beige cables. Fore and aft trim indicator is black. Control stick is black on both sides.area under the glare shield is interior gray green. Fuel cocks and one cutout button visbile, but not vaccuum control or whatever that other selector is. Engine control torque rods visible behind pilot’s seat.\n\n<a href=”http://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/pages/fmead14.html”&gt;\n\nhttp://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/pages/fmead14.html\n\nlooking straight across from entrance at instrument panel, stick, rudder pedals in same stripped/disassembled state as fmead14.html above. It looks un-restored or at least maintained as built, so wooden pieces are interior gray green, as is seat and related structure. Instrument panel faces are black, rudder pedal yokes are aluminum paint. Cable bundle running across behind the instrument panel is in white/cream wrapping, other cables black, gray, dirty silver? Tubing for instruments and controls is dull aluminum or silver paint. The handle of the control stick appears to be bare metal under a black finish which has worn and cracked off.\n\nNZ2336 FB VI\n\n<a href=”http://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/pages/smith9.html”&gt;\n\nhttp://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/pages/smith9.html\n\nAnother un-restored, maintained as built example, and not as dusty or disassembled as NZ2328. Wooden structure is interior gray-green, rudder pedals silver paint, control column black, throttle box black, black levers including parts that stick out the bottom. Relay rods to engine control torque tubes appear to be interior gray-green. Push-button at aft edge of throttle box is either black or missing, I think missing. I’d expected red. Radio control box and compass case are dark gray, Radio box has black over silver id plate, centered, and gray cable that connects to the back. Radio box and throttle box have crinkle finish, semi-matte, unlike control column which is semi-gloss and smooth.\n\nDark redish brown floor under pilot’s feet, Dark gray leather(?) rubber(?) over moving parts the control column sticks up from, between dark red foot-boards. Elevator control rod from control column to elevator trim mix appears to be aluminum paint. Left most, larger, inner, friction adjust knob has aged to dark orange. Smaller, outer, right hand friction knob is black. Seat height adjustment lever is chipped black finish over natural metal, with bright red pushbutton at the top, push to unlock probably. Glycol de-icing fluid pump handle and body are shiny natural metal, Sanitary tank or possibly first aid kit under seat is interior gray-green over redish primer\n\nhttp://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/pages/smith10.html\n\nOh, pure gold! Observer’s sidwall, looking back and up from entrance.\n\nBlack electrical boxes. Black knobs and bell-shaped bases for… lamp dimmers? Black gauge and control on a black bracket at the lower back corner of the sidewall electrical box. Black electrical gizmo (terminal strip, ??) has receptacle for observer’s intercom. Dirty white cable bundles along sidewall, with darker brown discoloration like caramel stripe in ice-cream. Bare metal connectors where cables meet sidewall box. Gray individual wires in harness the dips down and then rises over entrance hatch. Dark gray oxygen hose. Wide yellow stripe over entrance hatch. Some sort of gray, crinkle finish metal box next to observer’s leg cushion- trailing antenna winch?\n\n.\n\nhttp://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/pages/smith11.html\n\nMore gold, looking back at observer’s and pilot’s seats, with original-looking harness. Big radio box on shelf in back. Dark upholstery on observer’s cushions and pilot’s cushions- black or dark brown color. Original???\n\nhttp://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/pages/smith6.html\n\nInside of crew hatch- interior green, Beware of propellers red letters on white, solid yrllow latch handle, brown leather loop at top of door rib, etc\n\nhttp://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/pages/smith7.html\n\nThe compliment to #9, this shows the pilot’s side up to the canopy frame, seat, sidewall, etc. Wooden surfaces all int. gray-green, Prop knobs same orange as larger friction knob, control stick semigloss black, everything screwed to sidewall is black or dark gray. Tube that carries emergency harness release is light gray/translucent\n\nhttp://www.kiwircraftimages.com/pages/smith8.html\n\nLooking sligfhtly forward to the instruments and controls Interior gray green, black, dark gray.Orange knobs on throttle box, red prop feathering buttons, seat adjustment lever unlock button. Black, white, gray, wires and cables\n\nhttp://www.kiwiaircraftimages.com/pages/mp00mos7.html\n\nFB Mk VI NZ2336, Box B, various stuff on the Navigator/Observer’s sidewall- this is a GREAT photo- you can see the bare metal over what might be trailing wire antenna, I think I see a crank on it. The whiteish tubing that the various wire bundles are collected in is aging and discoloring, but very clearly a light color, with silver or natural metal connectors where they attach to Box B. There is also a dimmer and an instrument lamp, and a short cable with a 1/4″ female connector for the headphones/mic. AND the twin red buttons to destroy the IFF and/or radar key components (magnetron?)\n\nSpitfire spares\n\nFlickr Mosquito cockpit pix:\n\nlow angle view of whole instrument pannel. Very clear.\n\nEngine instruments, throttes and propeller control, stick, dimmers, compass.\n\nNavigator’s back armor, 1154 Transmitter/receiver, Direction finding looop hanging inside canopy.\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/lambda_nut/3904271707/in/set-72157622008359338/\n\nThis is a look down toward the rudder pedals, showing the low instrument panel, etc. You can see the wingnut and spool assembly that locks the two rudder pedals together to immobilize the rudder.\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/lambda_nut/3904282687/in/set-72157622008359338/\n\nFull instrument panel, A fighter-bomber, I’d guess, since there’s the bomb interval stuff on the center pedestal, This is a really nice photo, of a possibly un-restored example.\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/lambda_nut/sets/72157622008359338/\n\nLower instrument panel and obvserver’s side.

This is not an actua Mosquito, as you can see from the former rings in the bombardier’s compartment, and the absence of cables, hoses, rods, levers, etc. I think this is extremely cool and I’d love to experience it. But its like a big RC model or super detailed static scale model. You\n\ncan get an idea how the builder(s) think it should look. Not a primary source, but a secondary source for sure."
