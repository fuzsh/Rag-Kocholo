I've got an empty 73 shell here getting ready to become an track/street car. The entire rear firewall and seat area has been replaced by the PO with a combinantion of aluminum and galvanized. What would happen it I flipped the engine around and built a fire wall behind the seats with a window ala GT1? Would they kick me off the track or force me to race with the big dogs?\n\nThat's a nice car, to bad about the Chevy engine though.\n\n__________________\n\nEmail me about 911 exhaust stud repair tools, rsr911@neo.rr.com\n\n1966 912 converted to 3.0 and IROC body SOLD unfortunately\n\n1986 Ford F350 Crew Cab 7.3 IDI diesel, Banks Sidewinder turbo, ZF5 5spd, 4WD Dana 60 king pin front, DRW, pintle hook and receiver hitch, all steel flat bed with gooseneck hidden hitch.

Looks like the rear wheels needed to be 5 inches farther back, or the engine 5 inches farther forward. I would have thought that a PROPERLY ENGINEERED car would start with the drive shafts and CV joins all lined up when the car is in a settled neutral position. Running 500 +HP and gobs of torque through CV joins at that angle is asking for trouble...
