It's a racing car for the road, but Porsche being Porsche have given it styling cues which make it look vaguely conventional yet still bonkers, and the interior looks astonishingly liveable.\n\nI like the idea of this car and I love homologation road cars based on race cars any day. But I don't think the GT1 is cool. Every time I look at it I think it looks like a 911 with a silly body kit (because it kinda is) with poor fitting wheels.\n\nI'll go with meh.\n\na 911 with a silly body kit (because it kinda is)\n\nIt's a street version of a prototype race car and a 911 in name only.\n\nIt's a street version of a prototype race car and a 911 in name only.\n\nThat's why I said \"kinda\".\n\nUltra-rare Porsche, sub zero. I almost don't need to know what it is. It looks weird, kinda ugly, but that just makes it cooler when we're talking about cars in this realm."
