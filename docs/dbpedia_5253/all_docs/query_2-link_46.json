        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI was just wondering on what sort of 4 wheel drive system do porsche use in their vehilces. Im mainly interested in the systems on the 993 and 996 as they are the two cars im looking at as my potential next car....\n\nAs im generally a RWD kinda guy, i was originally looking at a C2S, but as ive looked closer, i never realised how limited in production they were, whilst the C4S seem to be more in my budget, and more readily available.\n\nMy question is this. How is the 4wd system on the C4/C4S's set up? Is it for example a permanent 50/50 split between front and rear wheels, or is it set up with more rear bias, or does it have the ability to shift power from front to rear via a centre diff????\n\nIf it is on a permanent set bias for front/rear split, is there any way of maybe altering this bias without going down the route of simply removing the prop shaft and thus making a RWD???\n\nThanks in advance\n\nNick\n\nI think there is more written about this system that sounds good than in reality works in the 996 coupling.\n\nI have looked at it and tried to work out how it works and frankly it is basically quite crude - just a clutch set with a pre-set pressure.\n\nThe shaft that drives it from the gearbox also drives the rear wheels permanently through a standard type diff.\n\nThat same shaft normally is cut off in a two wheel drive system so the other end does nothing - however in this case it extends to the front (via a coupling). If you undid the coupling the rear wheels would get all the drive and still work.\n\nThe clutch is set to slip at quite low torque, when it does - nothing much is lost as the front and rear wheels are going round at almost exactly the same speed so it doesn't result in huge power loss or heating up of the oil or the clutch plate. Frankly I cannot believe it provides the range of torque quoted nor that the oil heating up would make much difference to the torque transmitted.\n\nThe bearings do fail and we rebuild them when they do. They could be set with greater static torque but I have tested the torque driven and altered the oil on the faces and found little difference.\n\nWhen it heats up the plates do expand slightly but not enough (in my opinion) to create the ranges quoted.\n\nPerhaps I am being a numbskull and missing something - however I also doubt that others who confidently report to you all how it works and what the range is have similarly looked inside and experimented with it (or even tried to work out how it all works) as I have.\n\nI am happy to be put right by anyone who knows more about it than me (not someone who has just read something someone else has written).\n\nBaz Hartech"
