I love seeing what you would do with it because there were multiple choices you made here that I wouldn't have even considered.\n\nAnother thing I discovered is Porsche Cup is the one series you can use your EV Porsche's like the VGTs and the Taycan. I won Nordschleife with the VGT which was surprising because the heavy rain kicked in. I'm trying to get a good all-around Taycan tuning at 650pp.\n\nSuch an heartbreaking vehicle.

Then I figured it out. It also can be acquired by taking top 3 in the World Rally Challenge at Fisherman's Ranch. I am fairly certain that is how I first obtained it. And shortly after I tried using it at a dirt event and discovered that I preferred the Ford Focus for dirt events.

This car is in my garage no matter what. I try to reference them in terms of dropping 10,000,000 credits. Will you be able to bring it out often enough and enjoy the drive, not just the view. Praiano's tune of the 959 at Tokyo made that classic car viable to earn me another dozen classics.\n\nI will say this... take Praiano's tune, drop in the mid Turbo, mix from his base to your personal preferences (I'm a Senna type driver*, i.e. give me the best brakes possible so I can dive in hard and exit fast before I'm caught stealing), to 700pp. It straight up killed for me at Le Mans finally!\n\n*I'm in awe of Praiano's ability to get the lap times he does with normal (softer) brakes and sloppy rears (no booty joke intended!), as I am unable to replicate.\n\nI am just now discovering that I don't have this car even though my Car Index book says that I do have it.

Totally different results!\n\nHi Praiano, would you consider tuning the NSX-R '02 with the GT3 NSX Engine Swap for 800pp? I tried my hand at tuning it, but the car runs away from me at corner apex.\n\nYes , the car is incontrolable with so much power . Wheel spin kill the car.

You are so right @praiano63. What a perfectly balanced car! It's too bad there aren't more events in the game that it can participated in. All the 550p events are for FR and/or American/Japanese cars.\n\nI ran it in the 500pp Sunday Cup at Spa, and then put the ECU and power restrictor back to 100 to bring it in just under 550pp. I ran this configuration against Sophy at Spa and it was a fairly easy win. The car performs so perfectly and is so perfectly responsive on this track. I tried the quick race 1 lap at Nordschliefe also and won easily, but at least I got some credits while I enjoyed the car.\n\nIs this car worthwhile at 600pp at all without an engine swap?\n\nThe BRZ swap still a viable setup?\n\nPRAIANO'S TUNES : SETTINGS FOR GT7\n\nSubaru BRZ STI Sport '18 - 700PP - Racing Soft Tires - SWAP - All track - 1.34 SWAP ENGINE - LT5-Corvette C7 Wide car Rim Width Wide - Offset Wide Parts: Front A Side A Rear B Wing Custom I think this is the fastest 700PP road car in the game.

You can also add more front downforce to give more grip to the front end , there is so much power available that if you sacrify some few HP it would be a problem at all.\n\nEDIT: You can't reduce the power , it's a bug , it will not diminue the PP.

With Praiano’s tune, it’s almost effortless. It’s not the fastest, but it’s stress relief for me to spin 12 VR laps at Tokyo in the 959 (and the 800,000+ credits ain’t too shabby).\n\nI bookmarked this when I saw it, and came back to it today.\n\nWow!

Added back the Power and 550pp was enough to win that event. PD has the Pantera regular coming in 5th at that event.
