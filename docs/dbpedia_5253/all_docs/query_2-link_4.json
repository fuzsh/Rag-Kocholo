        "text": "The Stra√üenversion is cooler to me, but I still love this. The 996-era headlights and taillights on this body look so strange, but also endearing. Then again, I have a soft spot for the 996, since it was \"the Porsche\" that was around when I was a little kid first learning what cars were. Still, this is an easy SZ.\n\nAlso, if you've not seen it, please do check out the latest replies in the nomination thread, I want to know if I'm doing the right thing in the eyes of the voters.\n\nThe Porsche 911 GTI is one of my all-time favorite race cars. Especially this model tickles my fancy the most of all 911 GT1s. It was one of the fabulous racing machines going up against the likes of the Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR, the flamboyant Panoz Esperante GTR-1, and even the McLaren F1 among others at the time. I even own a scale model of the green with red/white Zakspeed 911 GT1. Oh, and the biggest thing? It won Le Mans OUTRIGHT- just like the McLaren F1. To me, anything lower than Sub-Zero is disrespect. So Sub-Zero is my call. Good luck changing my mind."
