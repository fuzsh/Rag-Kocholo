        "text": "Design\n\nInspired by the greatest Porsche® supercars, the design of the Revenge® GT1 takes note of key elements of the legendary 959, Carrera GT, 918 Spyder, and most influential, the GT1.\n\nThe entire car is replaced with 100% carbon fiber. Though the design screams insanity, all ducts, intakes, extractors, and aero elements are functional.\n\nThe front grill and nose intake funnel air over the hood through the hood extractors, creating immense downforce. The added roof scoop and rear scoops feed the engine plenty of cool air. The rear efficiently extracts air from the engine, along with an aggressive and functional diffuser, pushing air out systematically and creating downforce. Speaking of downforce, not only is the ducktail efficient in creating it, but the huge and high wing guarantees the cleanest air to create even more downforce to keep the car planted.\n\nPower\n\nPower options are not standard with conversions, yet when requested, 900-1,200 horsepower upgrades are available through authorized dealers and performance establishments across the country.\n\nUsing the engine platform already provided in the 911 Turbo, Turbo S, GT3, GT3RS, and GT2RS, there are many possible power upgrade options that can be outsourced through Peregrine’s web of dealers and partners.\n\nFrom custom tunes to full on engine builds, the sky is the limit with hitting that magic horsepower number that is in the mind of each and every customer.\n\nThere is no doubt, with the added functionality of the wide body and aero, adding more power will surely make these cars some of the fastest on the streets.\n\nHandling\n\nWith the immense downforce created by the detailed description above, you didn’t think that’s all we did to make the car handle better, did you?\n\nThe widebody, although beautiful and aerodynamically functional, serves a larger purpose: bigger tires. With 345’s in the back and 295’s in the front, the all-wheel drive 900+ horsepower is no joke.\n\nOf course, much of the suspension is modified and has been completely customized even further to handle unlike any other Porsche® today.\n\nRevolutionary\n\nWhat is being done at Peregrine Automotive® with the Revenge® GT1 conversion is unheard of. It is what happens when unimaginable dreams are met with an undeniably perfect team to create something never done before.\n\nThe Revenge® GT1 will no doubt make history, with its completely, entirely, wholly carbon fiber wide body, unlimited amounts of horsepower, and handling like no other car purchasable today.\n\nOnly one question remains: Where’s your Revenge®?"
