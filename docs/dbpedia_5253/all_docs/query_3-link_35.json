        "text": "HOW OUR SPARES SERVICE WORKS\n\n(1) We keep and supply more spares than any other UK retailer. We also break down dozens of kits every single year.\n\n(2) Spares are all shown as SERVICE STOCK - this means we do not have live stock on them, this is because the range is constantly coming in and out of stock, with many parts having multiple part numbers depending on how a part from a kit may be broken down or combined.\n\n(3) We do not guarantee any spare part is in stock. Where we do not have the parts for your order they will be ordered in for you. Around half the range is kept in stock by the importer, the rest will be ordered for you from Japan (typically takes about 6 weeks, unless we advise otherwise on the basket and checkout pages).\n\n(4) Wherever you are in the world, you only pay one lot of postage per order - we will send your order in multiple packages if it becomes available at different times.\n\nIt is important to note that if you require the parts urgently, you should email us first asking about availability so that we can check - otherwise we will simply back-order any items we do not have, and they will follow some weeks later."
