        "text": "The Porsche 911 is one of the most iconic sports cars on the planet - one of the most iconic cars, period. Porsche’s tactic over the 911’s seven decades on sale hasn’t been to constantly reinvent the wheel, preferring a series of incremental improvements to a proven recipe - but the 2024 facelift goes a little further than this.\n\nIn fact, with the new 911 getting its first ever hybrid engine, it’s a bit like fitting an air-source heat pump to an ancient cathedral. It might work better overall, but is it the right thing to do?\n\nAs a £100,000+ sports car, the 911 is likely to be bought with the heart. If, however, your head demands you consider all the competition, alternatives include the ageing but brilliant Audi R8, the high-tech Mercedes-AMG GT and the gorgeous-looking Aston Martin Vantage.\n\nYou might not notice at first glance that the 911’s changed at all for 2024. However, there are subtle differences on the outside - the indicators are now integrated into the headlights, which allows for a redesigned front bumper. On the GTS model, there are clever active cooling vents which can open or close as required.\n\nThere are new wheel designs, while the rear gets a resculpted bumper and diffuser plus cool centrally-mounted exhaust pipes and a redesigned light bar.\n\nInside, the biggest change is to be found behind the wheel. Porsche purists won’t all be happy, but the 911 has finally moved to a fully digital dashboard, where the old car had a central physical rev counter flanked by two screens. This does have some benefits - it’s more customisable, for example, and you can see all the dials through the wheel where previously you’d have outer information blocked by the rim.\n\nThe other change is that you no longer get Porsche’s signature twist-to-start switch - instead, you get a regular boring starter button.\n\nWatch: Porsche 911 S/T review\n\nA talented all-rounder that merges everyday usability with startling performance - we can’t wait to see what the Turbo S is like\n\nIn town\n\nThe Porsche 911’s USP is that it’s great to drive but also easy to live with every day – not something you can say about most serious sports cars.\n\nYes, the suspension is jiggly over bumps, but then it is a sports car and you can always set the adjustable dampers in their Comfort setting, which does a decent job of smoothing out the road in town. Another sports car thing is the 911’s heavy steering that gives great feedback, but can be tiring at slow speeds.\n\nParking is helped by the excellent visibility you get front and back, as well as the 911's impressively tight turning circle and an automatic gearbox that isn’t jerky at crawling speeds. All models now get rear-axle steering, which tightens the turning circle to just 10.9m. It’s also worth specifying the nose lift function, which can keep the 911’s front splitter safe over speed bumps or in tight situations.\n\nHaving said all that, it’s still worth considering the optional ParkAssist which adds front and rear sensors, plus a rear view camera. Another dip into the options list can add a 360-degree camera that you’ll be thankful for if you often have to squeeze your prized Porsche through uncompromising width restrictors.\n\nOn the motorway\n\nAt higher speeds, the Porsche 911’s suspension does an impressive job of smoothing out the road, its engine is quiet at a cruise and there’s not much wind noise to annoy you. That said, there is plenty of road noise that seems to be transmitted through the stiff chassis, directly into your ears. It’s even worse if you upgrade the standard wheels for a larger set.\n\nThe hybrid engine does emit a curious sort of high-pitched whine, audible under low throttle openings. It’s so high that you probably won’t notice it if your ears are over a certain age, but younger buyers beware…\n\nYou get cruise control as standard, with the option to upgrade to adaptive cruise control that can do the accelerating and braking for you while keeping a safe distance from the car in front. Want more autonomy? You can also specify lane-keep assist and lane-change assist.\n\nOn a twisty road\n\nThe 911 is one of the cars we’d most like in our arsenal if we were presented with a brilliant road. As with all versions, having the engine over the rear wheels means that the front tyres feel amazingly alive, with unbelievable levels of grip in hard cornering and a level of communication that you just don’t get with other sports cars.\n\nPerformance is seriously impressive. The entry-level Carrera keeps its 3.0-litre, twin-turbocharged flat-six engine, with a beefy 394hp leaving it capable of 0-62mph in just 4.1 seconds.\n\nThe big news is the new hybrid engine, which is fiendishly clever. It features an electric motor built into the gearbox, capable of recuperating energy when you lift off the throttle as well as boosting the engine’s output. There’s also an electrically-driven turbocharger which totally eliminates the lag you might find on some alternative, turbocharged cars. All the power is dealt with by a 400V electrical system and a small battery in the front.\n\nThe result is a massive 541hp and 0-60mph in just 3.0s. When we tested the GTS hybrid on track against an older GTS, it felt notably more muscular pulling out of the corners and, despite being on a wet track with dry-biased tyres, was over a second quicker than the old car.\n\nOn the road, it can feel as though the GTS is wasted - there’s so much performance that staying within the legal speed limit is barely using a fraction of its ability - but even here it’s great fun with incredibly accurate steering, loads of feedback through the steering whele and suspension that effectively irons out the worst bumps while still feeling like you’re connected to the road underneath you.\n\nElectronically-controlled anti-roll bars keep the 911 Hybrid totally flat even when you’re cornering hard, while the optional carbon-ceramic brakes provide a colossal amount of stopping power. Very few cars are as satisfying to drive as this, even if some are much more powerful. That could yet be fixed when Porsche releases the new 911 Turbo S, however, which could have well in excess of 600hp.\n\nThe Porsche 911 has an excellent driving position and while the back seats aren’t really able to carry humans, they do serve as a useful overspill for the Porsche’s boot. Which you find under the bonnet\n\nThe Porsche 911’s driving position is brilliant, whether you’re tall or small you’ll be able to get comfortable, there’s loads of headroom and the seats are electrically adjustable for height and backrest angle. The steering wheel sits perfectly dead centre and has loads of adjustment, the pedals are exactly where you want them to be and the 911’s low bonnet and curved headlight housings make it easy to place on the road.\n\nWant more comfort? Then you can upgrade to 14-way or 18-way electrically adjustable seats with a memory function that makes it easy to return them to your driving position. Heated and ventilated seats are on the options list, too.\n\nYou also get a decent amount of interior storage for quite a small car. You get two door bins which will swallow a small and a large bottle of water between them, with space left over for a couple of packets of crisps. There are also two cup holders – one in the centre console and another that folds out from the dashboard – a big glovebox and a tray under the centre armrest that’ll swallow a big phone and has two USB plugs for charging.\n\nSpace in the back seats\n\nThe 911 does have back seats, though they're technically optional. As standard you just get a luggage shelf, but adding the seats in is a zero-cost option - just remember to tick the box!\n\nWhen installed, they’re no use for adults – there’s no knee room and so little headroom you’ll have to stoop for the length of your journey. They’re not even that great for kids past primary school age.\n\nUnsurprisingly, fitting a child seat is tricky – if not impossible, because big chairs simply won’t fit – but at least you get ISOFIX points on the front passenger seat and using them is relatively easy.\n\nBoot space\n\nThe Porsche 911 rear-engine setup means the boot is found under the bonnet. It’s a deep space that’s best suited to swallowing soft bags, although you will get a suitcase in there if you want to. It has a 132-litre capacity, which drops slightly in four-wheel drive models.\n\nA Lotus Emira has a bit more room at 151 litres, though there is another 208 litres where the rear seats would be in the 911. The Audi R8 has its luggage space under the bonnet like the Porsche, but has a smaller capacity at 112 litres. The Aston Martin is the most practical of the bunch by miles, with a boot capacity of 350 litres.\n\nNeed more room? Then at least the near-useless back seats take on a new lease of life as luggage space.\n\nThe Porsche 911 is usually available in numerous states of tune and you can choose from manual or automatic, rear- or four-wheel drive. However, for now you only get two choices - the regular 911 Carrera and the Carrera S fitted with the T-Hybrid system.\n\nYou’ll not be disappointed with the basic 911 Carrera. Its 3.0-litre flat-six engine produces 394hp, gets from 0-62mph in 4.1 seconds and hits a top speed of 182mph flat out. It’s plenty quick enough for the road but returns an official fuel economy figure of up to 28mpg – not at all bad for a car with this performance – although road tax is pretty expensive because of the high emissions.\n\nThe Carrera GTS features Porsche's aforementioned hybrid system, though official economy and CO2 emissions still make it a pricey prospect. However, on a longer run over mixed roads we saw over 30mpg from this car, which is impressive given the massive performance on offer.\n\nMore interested in visceral thrills? Then you’ll want to have a look at the 510hp GT3 or 525hp GT3 RS - not yet available in this facelifted model range, but still worth a mention. Unlike the rest of the range, the GT3 models do without turbochargers so you have to work their screaming engines hard to get the best from them, although with 0-62mph taking 3.4 seconds (GT3) or 3.2 seconds (GT3 RS), you wouldn’t call them slow."
