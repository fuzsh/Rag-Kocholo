        "text": "There wasn’t one GT1 era, there were four, plus a variety of spin-off categories in a bewildering variety of international, continental and national series and Championships.\n\nHere though, to indicate the scope and scale of the development, ambition and aspiration of GT1 we’ve attempted to showcase all of the cars that raced, or in some cases nearly raced, in a GT1 class, a very close equivalent or in a class designed to encompass actual GT1 machinery, or cars that were later rolled into GT1.\n\nWe’ve omitted silhouette racers that have, on occasion been classed alongside the GT1 machines.\n\nWe’ve included those cars that either only or mainly appeared in national Championships\n\nAnd we’ve attempted at least to give an indication of when, where, and how successfully (if at all) they raced.\n\nThis compendium of DSC’s 6 part GT1 series has also had a couple more cars added.\n\nAscari\n\nThe Ascari went racing when the new owner of the company, Klaas Zwaart saw an opportunity to promote his new acquisition.\n\nPowered by a Ford V8 the car took a British GT Championship race win in 1995, tried and failed to qualify for Le Mans the same year and continued in competition in the UK for a further two seasons with only one race cr produced ahead of a production run of the road car derivative, dubbed the Ascari Ecosse.\n\nAston Martin\n\nThe first of the cars listed here that never raced. For the 1995 Le Mans 24 hour race, French publishing magnate Michel Hommell, commissioned an Aston Martin DB7 uniquely powered by a 6.3 litre V8 (reportedly a detuned version of the Group C AMR1 engine)\n\nThe car was built by Synergie, a Le Mans based constructor with carbon fibre doors, wings and bonnet. It narrowly failed to pre-qualify and was retired to the owner’s museum.\n\nRaced for the Aston Martin factory and for a variety of privateers from 2005-2011 – you can find details of its racing history from 2005-2008 HERE\n\nBitter\n\nToine Hezemans’ 1998 attempt to wring some competitiveness out of the Lotus Elise GT1, replacing the underpowered engines with the 7 litre V10 from the Viper GTSR.\n\nSadly for the two-car effort, the package proved to be both unreliable and uncompetitive and as development in the GT1 class skyrocketed, the project died after just two race outings. in the FIA GT Championship.\n\nBugatti\n\nA pair of racing versions of the Bugatti EB10 were built, one for the 1994 Le Mans 24 Hours (The blue car on the right above) which ran well before an accident stopped it in its tracks, the silver car contesting a limited number of North American races including the 1996 Rolex 24 Hours, posting a dnf.\n\nUnusually in GT1 the quad turbo V12 powered cars featured four wheel drive.\n\nCallaway\n\nThe front-mid engined Callaway C7R tried to pre-qualify for Le Mans in 1996 before an aero revamp and a run at Daytona for the 1997 24 Hours.\n\nA promising run there before electrical woes stopped a class-leading run provided light at the end of the tunnel which turned out to be an oncoming train, revised homologation requirements for production cars proving beyond Callaway’s limited resources, the very promising C7R was cancelled.\n\nChevrolet\n\nA one-off entry at the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1995 sold to the race organisers as a high-profile entry with a charitable business model – turned out to be a low profile effort, high on visual and aural drama, low on pace and longevity.\n\nCorvette Racing’s factory weapon from the start of their Pratt & Miller operated programme in 1999 until the end of the 2004 season with wins at Daytona (overall), Le Mans (three class wins), Sebring (three class wins) and Petit Le Mans (four class wins) and four ALMS class titles.\n\nYou can find more about the development of the car HERE\n\nThe C6.R replaced the C5-R for the 2005 season and continued in front-line service until the factory team switched to GT2 for 2009.\n\nIt scored three Le Mans class wins (2005,06,09), three wins apiece at Sebring and Petit Le Mans and won the GT1 title every season it competed in the ALMS\n\nChrysler\n\nPart fabricated by Reynard, assembled and developed by ORECA, the Viper GTSRs were a staple part of GT racing around the world for almost a decade from their introduction in 1997.\n\nGenerally speaking, the entries were named under the Chrysler Brand in Europe, Dodge in North America and appeared in a bewildering variety of classes over there racing life including GT1 in at least two eras.\n\nYou can read about their successes HERE\n\nDarrian\n\nThe little mid-engined Darrian T90 had seen success in the British GT Championship winning the GT3 class in 1996 (and the overall title).\n\nThe rules were changed for the following season and the Swansea Institute Team Darrian (SITD) outfit opted to take a turbo-engined car into GT1.\n\nThere it was comprehensively outgunned by the established players, a gamble on success through relative reliability not paying off as the big guns prevailed.\n\nThe little Darrian is still produced and campaigned today with success in club rallying and sprints.\n\nDauer\n\nA raid on the rulebook from Jochen Dauer and Porsche gave then the 1994 Le Mans 24 Hours overall win with a mildly modified Group C Porsche 962 – You can find more about the cars HERE\n\nAnother ‘Dauer’ 962. entered in the Belgian national Belcar Series in 1999 featured a different, less powerful (though still Porsche) engine but full Group C/ GTP bodywork.\n\nDe Tomaso\n\nA GT1 pioneer, the Dallara- built, ADA Engineering prepared Pantera raced at Le Mans in 1994 and also contested BPR and British GT races, finding success in the UK series with Thorkild Thyrring taking the GT1 title in 1995 with a variety of co-drivers including Andy Wallace.\n\nThe car continued to race, with some success, in the UK and in France until 1997\n\nDodge\n\nA pair of race-prepped RT/10 Roadsters (with hardtops), contested the 1994 Le Mans 24 Hours with limited results, one car retiring, the other finishing on the class podium but light years back from the Dauer Porsches.\n\nOne of the cars continuing for selected races in BPR the following season, albeit in the GT3 class\n\nSee Chrysler Viper GTSR above\n\nFerrari\n\nFerrari’s F40 saw a number of developments for racing in the early days of GT1, notably by Pilot Aldix (F40 LM) and Strandell (F40 GTE). Both outfits would score race wins, Strandell one apiece in 1994 and 1996, Pilot one in 1995, but McLaren dominated otherwise, before Porsche’s 911 GT1 moved the goalposts beyond the Ferrari’s available shooting range.\n\nAnother of the cars listed here that never raced.

You can read more about its racing career HERE\n\nGerman entrepreneur and engineer Franz Wieth launched his ow racing version of the 550, developed by Baumgartner Sportwagen Technik, two cars were built, one contested the FIA GT Championship in 2001, and then from 2003-5. One car also contested the 2004 Bahrain GT Festival and the car also competed in the second string Euro GT Series scoring two race wins.\n\nA pair of cars were built, with Ferrari’s blessing and raced in a limited FIA GT Championship programme in 2003 with JMB Racing, the cars proving to be fast but unreliable. One car went on to be a regular in European Hillclimbing!\n\nIn 2000, private investors led by Stéphane Ratel, created a Ferrari 550 race car to the then-current GT class regulations, later GT1’s third iteration.\n\nThe car first raced in the FIA GT Championship in 2000 with Team Rafanelli campaigning a pair of cars the following year and a single car in the ALMS GTS class in 2002.\n\nThe Rafanelli car was sold on to Maranello Motorsports and contested selected Australian Nations Cup events in 2004 before winning the one-off Bahrain GT Festival at the end of the year in the hands of David Brabham and Allan Simonsen.\n\nThe 2005 575 GTC was developed by Ferrari Corse Clienti with N.Technology. The car relied heavily on Balance of Performance to be competitive with the earlier CARE Racing 550 Maranello, the Maserati MC12 and the Aston Martin DBR9.\n\nThe cars would take a handful of wins in the FIA GT Championship in 2005 and 2006 and would also see competition in the Le Mans Series and at Le Mans in 2004 and 2005 but without notable results.\n\nFord\n\nThe early days of the British GT Championship saw a couple of upgraded Ford Escort Cosworth entrants contesting the top class. Charlie Cox took the Class A (effectively GT1) class win in the opening season of the BRDC Championship in 1993.\n\nMike Quaife entered a car featuring his company’s transmission, the cars four-wheel drive transmission format left intact.\n\nMatech Concepts-developed for the new for 2010 FIA GT1 World Championship, Thomas Mutsch taking second in the Drivers Championship where four cars were entered. Three cars entered Le Mans the same year, all failing to finish. The cars competitive career ended after another four-car entry in the 2011 FIA GT1 World Championship.\n\nHarrier\n\nLester Ray’s Harrier concern dates back to Group C days in the early 1980s with a series of neat and tidy little prototypes built and raced.\n\nInto the 1990s and the LR9 appeared, an early car raced at Le Mans in 1994 as an open-top car listed in LMP2.\n\nThereafter though the LR9 was more usually a closed top GT car and it became a staple in the British GT Championship, taking race wins in the hands of Win Percy with highly tuned Ford Cosworth power, the LR9C racing in both GT2 and GT1 forms, the latter with predictably more power and better aero.\n\nWith the GT1 game moving on apace Harrier looked to move along too, an interim evolution in 1997 led to the final GT iteration in 1998, the GT1-98, but even with the emerging talents of Jamie Campbell Walter on board one of the cars, podiums proved to be out of its reach.\n\nA new Harrier GT1 was proposed for 1999 but never came to pass, new owner Richard Austin had his eye on more power and downforce than the Harrier package could deliver – See Sintura!\n\nHelem\n\nSee Renault Sport Spider V6 in Part 5\n\nHonda\n\nA factory-backed effort for the 1995 Le Mans 24 Hours which saw bets being hedged in every possible way, after a three-car GT2 effort the previous year three NSX made the grid in 1995, one in GT2 and a pair in GT1.\n\nThe pair though had different powertrains, one turbocharged, the other normally aspirated. The n/a car failed to finish, the turbo car suffered repeated delays and was eventually not classified.\n\nJaguar\n\nRevealed in 1993 the racing version of Jaguars XJ220 supercar won first time out in the BRDC National Sports GT Challenge at Silverstone, the forerunner of the British GT Championship.\n\nThree works XJ220-Cs were entered at Le Mans in 1993 by Tom Walkinshaw Racing, John Nielsen, David Brabham and David Coulthard won the GT class with the other two cars retiring.\n\nThe winning car though was disqualified when senior steward Alain Bertaut complained that they were not running catalytic converters. The cars ran in the race under appeal.\n\nIMSA officials wrote to the ACO confirming that the cars complied with IMSA rules. Jaguar won their appeal (supported by the FIA) but was nevertheless disqualified, as the ACO confirmed that the appeal had not been lodged in time.\n\nTwo cars raced in the GT1 class for the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, one ran fourth into the early morning until engine failure hit.\n\nXJ220Cs made other race appearances in a variety of series but in particular BPR and British GT.\n\nKoenigsegg CCGT\n\nThe 2007 Koenigsegg CCGT promised much but was removed from a potential racing career by a change in the GT1 regulations. You can read all about the car HERE\n\nLamborghini\n\nThe 1994 JGTC, forerunner of the current Super GT Championship, saw a mix of European and Japanese machinery in 1994 including the only Lamborghini Countach to contest a GT1 class, Ken Wolf with Terai Engineering mounting a less than successful full season effort.\n\nA proposed Le Mans entrant for 1995 that never made it on track, disagreement between the proposed entrant and the factory preventing the car from running. The car now believed to be in South Africa.\n\nA handful of Reiter Engineering prepared cars in mildly differing specifications were raced in FIA GT Championship competition from 2000-02.\n\nA JGTC regular, race in the GT1 class of the Suzuka 1000 km in 1996.\n\nTeam JLOC (Japan Lamborghini Owners’ Club) fielded the Lamborghini Diablo GT-1. Originally conceived to race in Europe, it only raced in Japan with JLOC from 1997 to 2000.\n\nThe Diablo GT-1 was the base for the Diablo JGT-1 introduced by JLOC in 2001, using the same engine and gearbox, but a reworked chassis and suspension, and other parts specially-built for JGTC competition. It raced with little success against the factory-developed Japanese efforts in GT500\n\nUnveiled in 2004 a joint development between Reiter Engineering and Audi Sport the R-GT saw service, and some success in both FIA GT and LMS racing as well as a year of racing in the ALMS with a two-car Krohn-Barbour effort that yielded little success.\n\nA derivative of the R-GT adapted for Le Mans for JLOC, the car completed sufficient laps to be classified but did not complete the final lap of the race and was excluded.\n\nThe car crashed in practice the following year and was replaced by a standard R-GT on race morning for the infamous ‘start and park’.\n\nReiter Engineering designed and built version of the Murcielago for the final GT1 era in the 2010 and 2011 FIA GT1 World Championship, taking race wins but no overall Championship honours.\n\nLancia\n\nPerhaps the most extraordinary entrant into a GT1 class in this 90+ car list is an ex factory-entered car that saw a one-off run at the Fuji round of the 1994 JGTC.\n\nThere are two extraordinary pieces of information to add to the sentence above – the first is that the Fuji race came a decade after the car left factory service, the second is that it was a factory rally car, not a circuit racer!\n\nEight years after Group B was banned the team Rosso Competition entered a unit ex works car in the third round of the championship the Japanese GT Championship to be driven by Naohiro Furuya.\n\nThe 037 proved to be underpowered, undercooled and fundamentally off the pace though it did at least post a distant finish, laps down to the eventual winning (and itself fundamentally dialled back) Porsche 962C\n\nLister\n\nA race car with a long history, the Jaguar V12 powered car started as a GT1, became a GT2 as the development curve for the top class sky-rocketed, became a GT class car as GT1 left the field of play in 1999 and then back to GT1 from 2003!\n\nThe car competed, in factory and customer hands for over a decade, appeared at Le Mans in 1995, was a stalwart in the British GT Championship thereafter taking a class or overall titles in 1999 and 2001 and was a force to be reckoned with in the FIA GT Championship too, taking regular race wins from 2000-2003 and the team’s title in 2000. The final customer Lister Storm last raced in 2006\n\nLister’s second GT1 offering, a full carbon car, to the second iteration of GT1 regulations in 1997 the car contesting the British GT Championship through to 1999 taking the title in its final year.\n\nThe car raced at Daytona in 1997 and 1998 and at Le Mans (2 cars) in 1997. The factory-entered cars were rejected at scrutineering at Le Mans the following year in a homologation dispute.\n\nA single GTL also raced in a pair of IMSA races in 1997 with some class success, but a pair of late-season appearances in the North American rounds of the FIA GT Championship was rather less successful.\n\nLotus\n\nAfter success in the supporting classes for the Esprit, Lotus stepped up to the top class for 1996 with the rapid but all-too-often unreliable Esprit V8 GT1, a two-car entry for the near-full season in BPR with a highlight of second at Silverstone.\n\nA fan-favourite that was less loved by the team!\n\nThe Esprit was replaced after a single year by the Elise GT1, which had the odd distinction of welcoming customer teams using entirely different engines!\n\nThe initially intended turbo Lotus V8 did not find favour with the Franck Muller team who selected the Chevy V8 instead with three other Elise GT1s during the season retaining the Lotus power plant.\n\nOnly one of the three (Chevy powered) cars that attempted to qualify for Le Mans managed to do so – it failed to finish.\n\nThe Lotuses proved to be outclassed, the best result of the season was a single fifth place.\n\nBizarrely one car made a final appearance in contemporary racing, at the 12 Hours of Sebring in 2004!\n\nIt retired very early in the race.\n\nMarcos\n\nThe basic Marcos shape goes back decades, but in the latter years of the marque the calling card changed from relatively low power and featherweight to HUGE power and as much aero as could be squeezed out of the package!\n\nAs time went on power went up, and the body shapes got more and more outrageous.\n\nMore often associated with GT2 or equivalent, in certain guises and in certain Series the more extreme cars could be bundled into GT1 (or its equivalent!)\n\nAnother British GT Championship staple and another Championship winning car, the latter-day cars came not from the UK but from the Netherlands after Cor Euser obtained the rights to produce the race cars under his Eurotech concern.\n\nThe always rapid Dutchman won his last national title in the most outrageously wide Mantara (named La Bomba) of the lot in 2009!\n\nMaserati\n\nMaserati’s answer to the new GT1 regulations was a car that didn’t conform to the regulations, barred from ACO rain it had astounding success in the FA GT Championship and at the Spa 24 Hour – with two campaigns in the ALMS as an aside!\n\nYou can read about its development and racing history HERE\n\nMcLaren\n\nThe car that effectively set GT1 on its way, and dominated the first two seasons of BPR, the Gordon Murray designed, Peter Stevens, styled and BW V12 powered McLaren F1 was truly designed as a road car first, racing only coming as a result of customer demand.\n\nIt was near unbeatable in 1995, and a rainy Le Mans played into its hands that year too, equalising the GT1s against the technical superior Prototypes, a famous win sealed the legend.\n\nIn ’96 too the McLarens were mighty, until Porsche’s ‘race first, road car later’ 911 GT1 crashed the party!\n\nMcLaren’s response to the Porsche and Mercedes challenge was the long-tail version of the F1, a car many point to as one of the most beautiful competition cars of the modern era.\n\nWith BMW backing and top-class driver line-ups the factory team almost took the FIA GT Championship in 1997, by the end of the year though it was clear that Mercedes and Porsche had more development in hand, and at Mclaren the development cupboard was bare, there were still results to come though, with customer success in the British Championship into 1998 and the car was still winning, albeit not regularly, in Japan as late as 2001 and still competing to 2005!\n\nMega\n\nEffective a restyled and re-engineered version of the MiG M100, the Mega concern bought the rights to the project, re-engined the car with Mercedes V12 engines and presented a racing version – dubbed the GT1 – in 1997.\n\nThereafter the project struggled, the GT1 never raced.\n\nMercedes\n\nWith the collapse of the ITC touring car Championship, Mercedes had big money sponsors and technical know-how to concentrate in another field and the growth in popularity of GT racing caught their attention.\n\nAfter trialling their V12 engine and basic aero package on a McLaren F1 GTR test mule they entered the 1997 FIA GT Championship with a full factory effort, eventually fielding three cars.\n\nAfter early-season reliability woes, the results began to come and they took the teams, drivers and manufacturers titles in their first season against stoic opposition from the BMW-backed McLarens.\n\nWith a return to Le Mans firmly in their sights, the basic CLK GTR package was developed to accept improved aerodynamics and an evolution of the 5 litre V8 from the Sauber Mercedes Group C programme.\n\nThe Le Mans effort failed, the factory cars suffering engine issues, but Mercedes took the FIA GT Championship – the pace of development though meant it was all over at the end of the season – from packed grids to a handful of takers in just a couple of years, amazing cars but class killers.\n\nNever raced as a GT1 but rather in the GT1-succeeding GTP class at Le Mans in 1999. A three-car factory entry was among the race favourites but the cars suffered a trio of airborne accidents, the remaining car withdrawn after Peter Dumbreck’s massive blower on live TV.\n\nMiG\n\nAn intriguing story from 1993.\n\nFirst things first the MIG title is NOT the same MIG as the manufacturer of Russian fighter jets, but rather an acronym for the eventual Georgian backers of the effort.\n\nOriginally dubbed the MCA Centenaire the company was Monaco-based, Prince Rainier the owner of the very first, Lamborghini V12 engined, road car.\n\nFiscal issues saw the company change hands to industrialist Alexander Mingrelia – the MiG title apparently standing for ‘Mingrelia I Georgia’\n\nTwo MiGs actually ran in Le Mans testing and pre-qualifying, the first a Lamborghini-engined road car fitted with racing rubber which did enough to earn the team a shot at pre-qualification.\n\nThe intended race version though was powered by a Motori Moderni 3.5 litre V12 F1 engine but twin-turbocharged to beyond 700 bhp.\n\nIt was enough to scare the living hell out of the driver, expose all the multiple frailties of the road car package, but also to slingshot the car in a straight line to well over 200mph, it squeaked onto the entry but the team ran out of resources.\n\nThe MiG did though race, just once, in Lamborghini-powered form, at the 6 Hours of Vallelunga in 1993, it finished a delayed 23rd!\n\nAlso see Mega Monte Carlo above.\n\nMosler\n\nOne of the early efforts from Warren Mosler, and with big V8 power the oddly styled Raptor found its way into the GT1 class of the USRRC with limited success. The Raptor was succeeded by the (more GT2-appropriate) Intruder before the MT900 found an avenue into European competition that gave Mosler a much more international profile.\n\nNissan\n\nTwo cars, based on the R33 LM race car, entered Le Mans in 1995, rear-wheel-drive only and with a 2.6-litre twin-turbo inline 6 cylinder engine producing 400bhp.\n\nOne car retired but the #22 car finished 10th overall, 5th in GT1.\n\nA collaboration between Tom Walkinshaw Racing and NISMO produced Nissan’s 1997 and 1998 Le Mans GT1 contender, stayed by Ian Callum and with mechanical design and aero by Tony Southgate.\n\nThe R390 was powered by an ex Group C 3.5 litre, twin-turbo V8.\n\nThree cars were entered for Le Mans in 1997 but all suffered gearbox issues, a result of cooling problems. One car made the finish – 12th overall.\n\nIn 1998 four cars were entered, three to a fully revised specification, with a longer tail and revised aero, whilst off the ultimate pace they all came home in the overall top 10, 3rd, 5th, 6th and 10th.\n\nThe 5.5 litre V8 powered, rear-wheel-drive GT1 GT-R was designed to take part in the new for 2010 FIA GT1 World Championship.\n\nAhead of that programme, a development car undertook a part season in the FIA GT Championship in 2009, including the Spa 24 Hours where it came home a creditable 12th.\n\nThere were two race wins in the 2010 Championship and a further 5 in 2011, Lucas Luhr and Michael Krumm securing the Drivers World Championship in a JRM-entered car.\n\nPagani\n\nThe Zonda was another heroic effort from Toine Hezemans to find a competitive package but was doomed by a combination of a failed bd to get factory AMG power plants, an overweight base car, poor base aero, and eventually woeful reliability from the production-based Mercedes V12 engines.\n\nA Sebring debut and Le Mans in 2003 were both failures with broken engines after which the car was parked, it was leased for an attempt at qualifying for Le Mans in 2004 but fell short before being sold on to a Czech Gentleman driver for further racing duties in Central Europe.\n\nPanoz\n\nDeveloped by Reynard as a front-mid engined car with a Roush-built, Elan developed 6 litre V8. Six cars were built in 1997 with an evolution to the bodywork for the following year.\n\nThe cars raced with some success n North America but struggled against factory opposition in FIA GT competition.\n\nIn 1998 Panoz won the USSRC Team and IMSA GT Teams and Manufacturers titles. In 1998 a factory-entered car finished 7th overall at Le Mans, the second season that factory and customer cars had been entered.\n\nAfter two appearances in 1999, the GTR was retired in favour of the new LMP1 car though one GTR would reappear in 2003 for the Le Mans 1000km.\n\nThe car was then purchased by Larbre Compétition and further modified, being renamed the Panoz GTP to reflect its change in class. The modified car would debut at the 2004 12 Hours of Sebring, finishing 9th overall would retire from the Le Mans 24 Hours and would make a final appearance in the Le Mans Series event at Spa-Francorchamps, taking 14th place.\n\nFor 1998 Panoz, together with Zytek developed a hybrid electric motor for the Esperante GTR-1.\n\nThe Q9 GTR-1 Hybrid was nicknamed “Sparky”, it attempted to qualify for Le Mans in 1998 but proved overweight and not fast enough with the battery technology of the time.\n\nIt made one competitive start, at the inaugural Petit Le Mans in 1998 finishing 12th overall.\n\nPorsche\n\nWhilst very few original period-built Porsche 935s survived in contemporary GT racing into the GT1 era some later but ‘replica’ cars did.\n\nMost notably the Blue Coral cars of the early years of the BRDC GT Challenge (that evolved into the current British GT Championship, the pair compose of one ‘period’ Kremer built K3 from c.1980 and a replica built rather later.\n\nRichard Chamberlain’s car that still graces national racing in the UK to this day the car competed in a ‘scratch’ GT1 class in the 2004 Bahrain GT Festival alongside a similar recreation, both based on Porsche 930 road cars.\n\nThere was one other survivor from the earlier era, an ex DRM sprint 935 that found its way into the Italian GT championship in 1996.\n\nThe only factory-built 911 Turbo S LM went to Larbre Competition with Freisinger assisted by Porsche in building up a 964 generation 911 Carrera RS to a similar specification.\n\nThe Larbre car would win BPR races in 1994, the Freisinger car scoring a brace of second-place finishes at Paul Ricard and Suzuka.\n\nOther teams would also convert base cars to Turbo S LM spec for 1995 including Konrad and Obermaier.\n\nPorsche’s 1994 stopgap solution to the GT1 arms race until the 911 GT1 came on stream was this uprated version of the 911 GT2 with a higher rear wing, reduced weight wider body to accommodate larger GT1 spec tyres and a 600 bhp turbo engine.\n\nEffectively the car that brought down the curtain on the first iteration of GT1, debuting in dominated fashion at the end of 1996 in BPR the car was shamelessly designed as a race car first, hyper-road car second. It saw success in BPR and several customer car sales followed in 1997.\n\nThe starting gun had been fired though on a rapid development cycle where Porsche and Mercedes would go head to head, the original GT1 would have but a single year in factory service.\n\n1997 saw the arrival of the Evo version of the 911 GT1, styling based on the newly introduced 996 version of the Porsche 911 road car, there was little joy though, for the factory team in the newly introduced FIA GT Championship, no race wins for the year as the Mercedes CLK GTR and BMW-backed long-tail McLaren F1 GTR dominated proceedings.\n\nThere was a happier hunting ground in North America for Champion Racing with their 911 GT1 Evo in 1998 and 1999, the car taking a class title in 1998 and battling hard against a mainly prototype field until the second iteration of GT1 was put to the sword at the end of 1999.\n\nThe final factory iteration of the 911 GT1 concept saw much attention to aerodynamics as Porsche looked to head off the threat from Mercedes Benz.\n\nBad luck, and a steamroller AMG effort saw the Porsches (campaigned both by the factory and a customer Zakspeed team) beaten at every round in 1998’s FIA GT Championship with a strong run at Petit Le Mans ended by a dramatic blower accident for Yannick Dalmas.\n\nA win at Le Mans though blew away those cobwebs, it stands as the last, at the point, for a GT-based race car at Le Mans, Porsche walking away from the programme at the end of the year to concentrate on their later cancelled LMP900 programme.\n\nRed Bull-backed RWS Motorsport threw the dice in 2002 in the FIA GT Championship fielding an upgraded Porsche 996 GT3 RS in the top GT class.\n\nThe car was dubbed the 996 GT with an aero upgrade but was seriously outgunned using the same engine as its N-GT(GT2) class cousins.\n\nPorsche 911 Turbo and BiTurbo\n\nA variety of teams and tuners produced uprated turbo or bi-turbo versions of Porsche’s 911 in both 993 and 996 guises over a decade or more looking for power and pace to match the factory-developed GT1s. These cars would appear in a myriad of Championships and one-off races.\n\nBlue Coral were amongst the teams fielding turbo 911s, the team using the cars to bridge the gap between their older 935s and the later 911 GT1s for British GT and other duties.\n\nIn the bi-turbo field, PSI from Belgium would have real success in Belcar and would sell a number of customer cars, A-Level Engineering from Germany had the odd very good day in Le Mans Series Competition, particularly, as at Silverstone in 2005, when the weather came in to play and the Paul Hogan/ Tech 9 car in British GT.\n\nComprehensively rebuilt from a roadgoing Carrera GT by GPR Racing in Belgium who were looking towards FIA GT, Belcar and FFSA GT the car was equipped with a Motec engine management system; Stack instruments; Moton suspension; custom made wishbones and track rods; AP Racing braking system with steel discs; pedal box; air jacks; special heavy-duty clutch; regulation fixed rear wing; Thiebaut roll cage; BBS custom made racing wheels; automatic fire extinguishing system; and a competition fuel system.\n\nPorsche refused permission for it to race.\n\nQuaife\n\nEssentially a technology demonstrator for drivetrain manufacturer Quaife, after racing an upgraded Ford Escort Cosworth in earlier seasons, the Quaife R4 GTS contested the GT1 class in the British GT Championship in 1998, 1999 and 2001 with few notable results, the Ford V8 powered car though, which did have a single road going sister car, holds a rare place in GT1 history, one of only three cars in this group to feature a four-wheel drive powertrain (the others being the Bugatti EB110 LM and the Ford Escort Cosworth).\n\nRenault\n\nInitially conceived as a GT1 with Renault V6 power aboard a coupe version of Renault’s Sport Spider lightweight sportscar.\n\nFailed to qualify for Le Mans in 1996, raced competitively in British GT Championship twice later that year winning one race, failed to prequalify for Le Mans again the following year, by now rebranded as a Helem V6 (See Helem above).\n\nReclassified as a GT2 thereafter.\n\nRGS Mirage\n\nA one-off with an amazingly long racing career, originally campaigned (with very little success) in the British GT in 1997 and 1998 by Gary Ward’s RGS Motorsport, the Chevrolet-V8 powered Lamborghini Countach clone was then sold on for further use in the All-Japan GT Championship in 2000, failing to qualify for the four races it attempted to in 2000 before re-emerging in 2003 in GT300!\n\nSaleen\n\nThe Steve Saleen badged, initially RML in the UK developed, V8 powered behemoth provided the GT1 outlier in the early years of the third iteration of GT1 (GTS). Further developed in its latter years by ORECA the cars would have a decade long career from 2000 to 2010 with domestic titles in the UK, Spain and France, and class wins at Le Mans and Sebring.

Also contested the 1998 ALMS race at Laguna Seca as team owner Richard Austin searched for a customer base as GT1 melted down.

Amongst those who took big V8 power to try to slay giants n their class were the late lamented Colin Blower who, when budgets allowed in 2001/2, and the car co-operated, looked ready, willing and able to take very big scalps indeed in his self-built and prepped Ultima, the company based in the same town (Hinckley) as Blower’s highly effective race engineering concern.\n\nEarlier in British GT history, Chas Berger’s turbo Ford V6 powered GTR (below) saw some competitive running too.\n\nOthers saw service in Euro GT and Belcar with some success.\n\nVenturi\n\nThe ultimate evolution of the one-make car that bought Stephane Ratel into the world of GT racing, by 1994 the Venturi had improved aero, reduced weight and a 600bhp version of the turbocharged 3 litre PRV V6.\n\nIt was good enough for race wins in 1994 in BPR, but not for finishes at Le Mans.\n\nBy the following year the game had moved on and it wouldn’t be enough any more in deliverable power refinement or reliability to go toe to toe with the top performers in GT1.\n\nAll the Venturis entered at Le Mans in 1995 were again non-finishers or not classified."
