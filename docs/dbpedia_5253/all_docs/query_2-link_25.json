        "text": "Carsick Charles said:\n\nWell, good luck to you, Chimp! :worship: Given that I've never driven a Turbo, I'm not really speaking from an informed position. Seriously considering doing the Porsche Ultimate GT course (as well as the GT course) to try the GT2 and GT2RS to get some experience of a Turbo. I'm sure the Turbo is a fantastic car - OK it might not sound as good as a normally aspirated 911, and my plan has always been to move up towards a GT3 - but until you've actually driven a car, all your preconceptions are pretty much invalid. So perhaps Turbo is the way to go!\n\n40mph in second gear in a turbo is one of life's pleasures!! Try it one day\n\nGT4 said:\n\nBut the package as a whole has two advantages to me (assuming the above were optioned out): first is the bargain basement value pack of things like the X51 PowerKit and PSE (much cheaper than spec'ing on a standard C2S or C4S) and second is the fact that they made more GTS with X51/PSE as standard in its short run that all the other 997 3.8S X51 (997.1 and 997.2) in the rest of the product cycle - ie far more chance/choice of getting one :bandit:\n\n(Betraying my Newbie status here ) ...what exactly is an X51/PSE and how can you tell if you have one? I'm assuming it's a 'better' sounding variant of the PSE? The PSE on my GTS does sound louder and more sonorous to my ears than the PSE on my Carrera S - but I might be imagining it!\n\nPeter S said\n\nHow do you clean your car?\n\nEvidently not the correct way as I have never removed the wheels to clean them - though I take my cars to be detailed once a year to Revolution Porsche, who do remove the wheels and don't have a problem with CLs. I just use various wheel brushes and a sponge and shampoo. The bodywork I wash with Zymol shampoo using a lambswool mitt and the 2 bucket method - without removing the doors/windows/engine cover etc. (hope this is correct!) :?\n\nCLs are common to Turbos, GT2s and 3s so I'm assuming their owners make do without removing the wheels to wash their cars (or they just go out and buy the necessary torque wrench/7 ft pole). Do people seriously not buy Turbos or GT cars just because they have CLs? I like the wheels and the look of the centre locks, and the fact that I can't remove the wheels myself isn't an issue.\n\nOn the original debate, I fancied a GTS as it appeared to be an ideal compromise, but now I'm not so sure I prefer the wide body anymore.\n\nIt can look a little \"grotesque\"\" (not really the right word)\n\nAgain, it's a matter of preference. The wide body shape is common to AWD 997s and personally I think they look better, though I'd rather have rear wheel drive. Turbos too have a wide body shape, and the 993 Turbo in particular is one of the best looking cars ever, to my eyes. If you don't like the look of this type of car then you're probably better of sticking with the vanilla Carrera/Carrera S shape.\n\nGT4 said:\n\nDo you mean \"caricature\"?\n\nThe 993 WB does that too, to my eyes.\n\n:? \"Caricature\"? I was under the impression , from your previous posts, that you were an exponent of the 997 AWD, which has the wide body shape? Personally, I think the 993 Turbo and the 993 Carrera S wide body with split engine cover are two of the nicest looking cars of all time. I was seriously considering one of the latter but went for a GTS as a newer alternative and a more practical everyday car.\n\nInterestingly, the wide body 993 Carrera S's fetch considerably more than the narrower standard model and tend to sell faster. Principally I expect this is because they're rarer, but also there must be a significant number of people - like myself - who prefer the wide body look. (I did in fact think the photo on your signature was a wide-bodied 993, but clearly wrong there! )\n\nOne thing that nobody has mentioned is the different handling characteristics of a rear wheel drive 911 with the wider wheels, wider track, stiffer springs and anti-roll bars of the 4S. I have noticed a significant improvement over the C2S - it seems to hold the road better around corners and just feels better balanced and all round I prefer it.\n\nIt's all subjective though - apparently, some people even prefer Cayennes and Panameras (and even Range Rovers!) to 911s, which I find completely baffling.\n\n:dont know:\n\nCarsick Charles said:\n\nGT4 said:\n\nDo you mean \"caricature\"?\n\nThe 993 WB does that too, to my eyes.\n\n:? \"Caricature\"? I was under the impression , from your previous posts, that you were an exponent of the 997 AWD, which has the wide body shape?\n\nThat is indeed the 997-on quandary: no narrow body C4s\n\nHad or have an NB 996 C4 and NB 993 C4.\n\nMuch nicer to my eyes (although I can see the attraction, and won't hold an alternative view against anyone).\n\nI can understand the \"better\" handling (hence new 991 GT3 going to WB for the first time), but I don't like the extra weight or drag of the WB.\n\nI put \"better\" in quotes as ultimate squatness based stability and road-holding is improved, but at the loss of some deilcacy and finesse.\n\nAnd yes, I know AWD does this too under certain metrics, but I couldn't live with both aspects deadening the feel (again, just personal preference)\n\nCarsick Charles said:\n\nGT4 said:\n\nBut the package as a whole has two advantages to me (assuming the above were optioned out): first is the bargain basement value pack of things like the X51 PowerKit and PSE (much cheaper than spec'ing on a standard C2S or C4S) and second is the fact that they made more GTS with X51/PSE as standard in its short run that all the other 997 3.8S X51 (997.1 and 997.2) in the rest of the product cycle - ie far more chance/choice of getting one :bandit:\n\n(Betraying my Newbie status here ) ...what exactly is an X51/PSE and how can you tell if you have one?

The PSE on my GTS does sound louder and more sonorous to my ears than the PSE on my Carrera S - but I might be imagining it!\n\nThe 997 cost optional PowerKit for Carrera NA (designated X51 since 993) also includes \"free\" PSE in its install.\n\nSo both 997.1/997.2 Carrera 3.8S/3.84S (not on 997 3.6) with the X51 option get it as an option pack X51/XLF (XLF=PSE) and all GTS as standard come so equipped.\n\nThe 993.2 X51 \"adds\" 15 PS (3.8 vs 3.6 original)\n\nThe 996.1 X51 adds 20 PS\n\nThe 996.21 X51 adds 25 PS\n\nThe 997.1 X51 adds 26 PS\n\nThe 997.2 X51 adds 28 PS\n\nThe 991.1 X51 adds 30 PS\n\n997 X51 has a CF airbox (if not GTS), X51 appears in build spec/VIL option list.\n\nThe centre plenum is cast alloy (stamped \"PORSCHE\" below\"):\n\nYou don't say which gen your Carrera was.\n\n997.1 and 997.2 have completely different engines, and hence induction and exhausts."
