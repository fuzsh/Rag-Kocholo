No slouches there. But isn't everything about a 911 designed with a rear engine setup in mind? I would think if putting the motor in the middle of a 911 shell was a good idea, Dr P would have done it long ago.\n\nThat being said, I'd love to pick it apart to see how it was made but I don't have the $140k purchase price handy.\n\n__________________\n\nOwner of a wrecked 944\n\nLast edited by Wrecked944; 01-06-2004 at 02:43 PM..\n\nRegistered\n\nJoin Date: Dec 2003\n\nLocation: Arapahoe County, Colorado, USA\n\nPosts: 9,032\n\nCome on guys, it's called \"reading the rules\" something Porsche and Porsche racers have done since day one! If there is a competetive advantage and it's legal, go for it. This is how we have such outragous cool cars now - someone was thinking.\n\n__________________\n\nANSWER PRICE LIST (as seen in someone's shop)\n\nAnswers - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $0.75\n\nAnswers (requiring thought) - - - - $1.25\n\nAnswers (correct) - - - - - - - - - - $12.50\n\nRegistered\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2000\n\nLocation: So. Calif.\n\nPosts: 19,910\n\nPano had a writeup on this or another mid-engine FABCAR machine a few years ago. I think that one was built for IMSA rules that changed before it could be sorted. Very nicely engineered. Maybe this is the same or rebodied version of that car.\n\nDr. Porsche didn't do this because he wanted two tiny seats in the rear. If it wasn't for this accomodation and the fact that 914s were being built, I'm sure the engine would have ended up in the \"right\" place.\n\nSherwood\n\nhttp://members.rennlist.org/911pcars\n\nRegistered\n\nJoin Date: Feb 2002\n\nLocation: Van Nuys\n\nPosts: 10,361\n\nDave Klym at Fabcar constructed 2-3 of those cars. They were extremely low with trick suspension and lots of goodies. Unfortunately the rules hampered them (displacement and weight) from being competitive with the other cars. IMSA didn't want them running over the other competitors. We have a 2 piece kevlar roof from the first one here- same dimensions as a stock roof\n\nRegistered\n\nJoin Date: Feb 2000\n\nLocation: no where\n\nPosts: 4,392\n\nThey also replaced the Porsche transmission with a Hewland.\n\nSuspension pieces could be hung from the Hewland transmission ala formula cars.\n\nOther cars have been converted sucessfully to mid engine cnfiguration. Renault R5 Turbo started life as a front engine front wheel drive econo car and was later sucessfully converted to a screaming turbo midengine sleeper.\n\nEven my two Lotus used the front wheel drive transmission from a Renault 16 but relocated to the rear and reverse for a mid-engine layout."
