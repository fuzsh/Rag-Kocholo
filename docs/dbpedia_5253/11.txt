From the mid 1990's Endurance Racing catagories were re-organised and Group C was superceeded by the GT1 classification. The 911 GT1 was designed for racing along with a street legal version the 911 GT1 Stra√üenversion (Street version).

Porsche expressed interest in returning to top level sportscar racing and went about developing its competitor for the GT1 category. Cars in this category were previously heavily modified versions of road cars, usually supercars such as the McLaren F1 and Ferrari F40, but when the 911 GT1 was uneveiled in 1996 Porsches answer was, rather than to rather than develope a race car from one of their existing models, why not create a purpose built sports racer and develope a road going supercar.

Despite the 911 name the new racer bore very little in common with the 911 family, even though its front chassis was shared with its 993 version of the 911 the rear was derived from the earlier 962 Group C car ncluding its water-cooled, twin-turbocharged and intercooled, four valve per cylinder flat-six engine which was arranged in a mid-mounted position, compared to the rear-engined layout of a conventional 911. The engine was making about 592bhp.

The new car won won the GT1 class at Le mans, its debut event, ceeding overall victory to Joest Racing's Porsche WSC-95 prototype. The 911 GT1 made its debut in the BPR Global GT Series (the FIA championship's predecessor) at the Brands Hatch 4 hours, where Hans-Joachim Stuck and Thierry Boutsen won comfortably, although they were racing as an invited entry and were thus ineligible for points. They followed up by winning at Spa and Ralf Kelleners and Emmanuel Collard triumphed for the factory team at Zhuhai. The 1996 car was clocked at 205mph in practice on LeMans Mulsanne straight (in low drag form) and with its engine at 640bhp.

For 1997 the GT1 was not as effective, firstly against the McLaren F1 GTR, then against Mercedes new CLK-GTR. Towards the end of the season, revisions were made in preparation for 1997. The front end was revised with new bodywork and head lights and the car renamed 911 GT1 Evo. The car had the same 592bhp turbo engine, but the new aerodynamics increased speeds. At Le mans the car suffered reliability issues, and an older privately entered 1996 managed 5th overall, third in class.

The cars were heavily revised for 1998 as the 911 GT1-98. Designed to match the also new Toyota GT-One and Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR, the 911 GT1-98 featured bodywork which bore more of a resemblance to traditional sports-prototypes than the previous 2 models while a new sequential gearbox was installed. As per the regulations a street-legal version of the 911 GT1-98 was spawned, but it is believed that only one variant was produced which was still sufficient to satisfy the regulations.

This car had languished for a long time and has been brought back to race trim by Mark Sumpter and his team at Paragon and the race track beckons. The engine rebuild has been completed by Paul Knapton involving around 150 hours work
