My name is Nina Marie and I am based in New York. I am a rare breed of female 3D artist. My first love began in photography, then transitioned into retouching and compositing, and now learning CGI.

The programs I have dabbled in are Cinema 4D with Octane, Zbrush, Substance Painter, etc. I enjoy creating beautiful pieces that tell a story and inspire the imagination.
