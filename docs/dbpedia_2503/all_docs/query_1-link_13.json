        "meta_description": "AMARGO by Nina Maia feat. Chica Barreto, released 04 April 2024\n\n1. AMARGO\n\nNINA MAIA ON HOW “AMARGO” CAME TO BE:\r\n\r\n“Chica and I are long-time friends and musical partners. She is now on an international tour accompanying Damien Rice, but last year they booked a few days in Ariant, on the island of Mallorca, Spain, to dedicate themselves to his creative process. It ended up that Damien couldn&#39;t continue with the recordings and suggested that Chica use the studio as she wanted. By chance, Yann was already in Europe at the same time, accompanying Sessa [Brazilian artist] and I was here, in São Paulo, but available to travel. Then I organized myself and we met in Mallorca&quot;.\r\n\r\n“AMARGO&quot; was fully recorded in a home studio, set up by Chica and Damien in a quiet room inside a historic Ariant residence. &quot;It was like a small castle, an old building, surrounded by goat breeding and beautiful vegetation. We were isolated from everything, there was no internet or light in the house, with the exception of the studio, which was powered by solar energy. This made the experience immersive and unique,&quot; Nina explains. &quot;We were all three, partners of years, in a new place. Intimacy and novelty are printed in &#39;AMARGO&#39;. In addition, we rehearsed a lot so that the recording was made live, the three of us playing together,” adds Yann.\r\n\r\nAt the end of &quot;AMARGO&quot; comes ambient sounds from outside the house in Spain–an idea the three had so as to bring listeners a little of that magical atmosphere orbiting the space of complete artistic immersion. The video of &quot;AMARGO&quot;, made with records captured by Nina herself in Mallorca, completes the imagination of this release.",
