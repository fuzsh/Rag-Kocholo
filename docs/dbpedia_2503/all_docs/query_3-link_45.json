        "text": "Historically, reggaeton has been somewhat of a boy’s club — much like the music industry as a whole, for that matter. Women in reggaeton have been a rare breed, particularly when the genre emerged, and it’s only been in the last decade that more female visibility is forming across global Latinx communities.\n\nA female presence in reggaeton should be the norm, though, considering that the genre is bidding for global dominance. \"¿Y dónde están las mujeres?,\" so yells the DJ in basically every single Latin party — yet as \"Despacito\" became the most watched music video in 2020 and Bad Bunny broke a 64-year-old record on the Billboard 200, reggaeton presented as male-dominated.\n\nPero las mujeres están aquí: Panamanian songwriter Erika Ender co-authored \"Despacito\"; Natti Natasha and Becky G slid their way into the billion views club; and Karol G became the first female reggaeton artist to perform at Colombia's historic Estadio Atanasio Girardot. Before such feats were possible, women had to fight their way through.\n\nIn the ‘90s, male Puerto Rican DJs created \"old school\" reggaeton — a robust concoction of Jamaican dancehall, Panamanian reggae en Español and New York Latin rap. The hard-hitting tropical sound was styled for the clubs and, more often than not, accompanied by crass and misogynist lyrics, and collectives like the Noise and DJ Playero delivered mixtapes by the plenty.\n\nIvy Queen, freshly returning from New York to her native Island, became the first lady of reggaeton, bringing her provocative rap game from abroad. At the turn of the decade, La Sista contributed her invigorating bars to the genre, providing a much needed feminine balance to the scene. A few years later, Puerto Rico-New York twins Nina Sky featured in \"Oye Mi Canto,\" a timeless banger alongside Daddy Yankee and N.O.R.E.. But it would still take a resurgence for more women to represent and be represented.\n\nFast forward to reggaeton’s second coming of the ‘10s where the genre spread like wildfire in Miami, Colombia, Los Angeles, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and beyond. While male domination seems inescapable in some places, a formidable slew of females boldly stepped into the forefront and would prove their lasting power: Karol G, Becky G, and Natti Natasha. Then, more established singers came into the fore: Anitta from Brazil, Cazzu from Argentina, and Farina in Colombia, as well as rising new talent like Miami-based Boriqua RaiNao. And then there are the dames of neoperreo who formulated their own digitized iteration of the style: DJ Rosa Pistola, Tomasa Del Real, and La Goony Chonga.\n\nBy no means is this a comprehensive list, but a starting point to get to know five essential women of reggaeton, who cover sonic ground from various corners of pop culture.\n\nListen to GRAMMY.com’s Women Essential to Reggaeton playlist on Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music and Pandora.\n\nIvy Queen: The pioneering reggaeton rapper helped put the Caribbean-rooted genre on the global map\n\nThe O.G. La Caballota. Ivy Queen is the undisputable queen of reggaeton. As the first lady to join the ranks of the legendary collective the Noise, the singer/rapper instantly impressed the room when she stepped into genre-pioneer DJ Negro’s marquesina in the mid ‘90s and began to ferociously spit what would be her first hit song, \"Muchos Quieren Tumbarme.\"\n\nAlluding to a boxing ring, her power-charged lyrics of female empowerment shone startlingly bright.She unappologetically provided a feminist balance to reggaeton’s hedonistic counterpart. By the turn of the new millennium, she took the genre global with dancefloor anthem \"Quiero Bailar\" — a flirtatious but dignified track about never confusing perreo with a possible one night stand.\n\n\"When I entered the urbano genre to sing reggaeton, there were many lyrics similar to the ones we hear now [in trap] because they denigrated women too much. So the first thing that came out of my mouth was to give respect to the ladies. That was a blessing,\" she told Rolling Stone.\n\nDecades later, Her Royal Reggaeton Highness still lives up to her name, as testified in 2019’s Llego La Queen, where her linguistic prowess continues to outshine plenty of genre peers. Ivy Queen continued in Rolling Stone, \"I always followed lyrical content. I am content. I don’t want to be just a cover that people see on the outside. I want women to feel identified when they listen to me.\"\n\nNatti Natasha: Reggaeton gets the Dominican treatment\n\nNatti Natasha first broke the internet when she appeared as a love bandit in 2017’s \"Criminal\" alongside superstar Ozuna for a sizzling duet; its captivating music video has gone on to reach over 2.3 billion viewers. A year later, the Dominican provocateur passed the billion-streaming mark, this time with another female reggaeton powerhouse in tow, Becky G, in the salacious single \"Sin Pijamas.\"\n\n\"This type of message is usually given by men,\" the singer told Deezer about the aforementioned song. \"I feel that it was a moment where women felt no shame, in a good way, to say what men usually say.\"\n\nClaiming influences from Lauryn Hill and Ivy Queen, Natti Natasha is armed with an irresistible smoky flow, and a voice that can turn fiery in an instant. She has become one of the world’s most-watched female artists on YouTube, and the rest is herstory. The singer recently stepped into Dominican dembow, reggaeton’s more hyperactive cousin, with fellow stars El Alfa and Chimbala, for a frisky tropical fête.\n\nKarol G: A Colombian superstar praised as the new queen of Reggaeton\n\nKarol G (née Carolina Giraldo Navarro) is perhaps the most successful female artist to rise from reggaeton’s resurgence. Billboard heralded her as \"the Next Latina Queen,\" her millions of fans praise her as the new queen of reggaeton, and a Univision documentary named her \"the warrior of the genre.\"\n\nJust as Ivy Queen shattered misogynistic boundaries in the ‘90s and aughts within reggaeton, Karol G also stood high as a female powerhouse in a heavily male-dominated space at the start of reggaeton’s second wave. Owning her sexuality over mesmerizing, sensuous vocals, the Colombian artist is an unstoppable hitmaker, releasing timeless songs from the slinky, suggestive \"Mi Cama\" to the boss-b**** anthem \"Bichota,\" and the GRAMMY-nominated, violin-laden \"Tusa,\" starring Nicki Minaj.\n\nIn 2018, the Medellín singer earned the coveted Best New Artist award at the Latin GRAMMYs. Last year, she dropped a 11x Platinum album, KG0516, which peaked at No. 1 on the US Top Latin Albums charts. \"I always wanted to be the biggest in Latin America, and I thought that was the biggest I could get,\" she told Billboard. \"But ‘Tusa’ shook me up. It came to tell me, ‘You’re ready for the world, not just Latin America.'\"\n\nMariah Angeliq: Rising reggaeton star brings her deliciously 'toxic' Miami swagger to the game\n\nWith her insouciant vocal delivery, no short of sensuous, Mariah Angeliq is a rising star to watch in the ever-expanding música urbana scene. Proclaimed as La Princesa de Miami, the 22-year-old Cuban-Puerto Rican singer, made her big entrance next to Karol G in last year’s chart-topping smash hit \"El Makinon,\" which earned the fiery duet a No. 1 slot on Latin Airplay.\n\nAngeliq has performed alongside J Quiles, Luísa Sonza and Ludmilla, to name a few, but shows that she can also shine on her own in her latest bad grrl banger, \"La Tóxica.\" With a 2020 EP out Normal, and a slew of sultry singles, the proud 305 artist is currently working on her full-length debut.**\n\nMs Nina: The madam of neoperreo reps bold, sex-positive rap bars\n\nA freakier spin-off to the Caribbean club genre, neoperreo is reggeaton’s digitized, weird cousin. Emerging from the underground of Latinx parties from around the world — with key members making noise in Chile (Tomasa del Real, a.k.a. La Reina del Neoperreo), Spain (Ms Nina) and Miami (La Goony Chonga) — this community of sex positive mostly-female rappers is a defiant presence against the misogynistic wordplay of various male reggaetoneros.\n\nBorn in Córdoba, Argentina, Ms Nina, née Jorgelina Andrea, built her music project in Madrid and has been making the rounds as one of the most provocative players of the scene. In 2019, she dropped Perrando Por Fuera, Llorando Por Dentro via Mad Decent and continues to release riveting singles across streaming platforms.\n\n\"It’s good to see more women making music now,\" Ms Nina told Indie Mag. \"There’s a growing scene for women in Spain that are making music. They’re doing it really well which inspires more women to be active in making music, because normally they say reggaeton is very machista, and when a woman says equal things she is considered a slut. That’s why I’m trying to create equality for both. Women should feel comfortable being sexy when being out and partying.\"\n\nMúsica Mexicana isn't the only sound of Mexico that's blowing up; the country's artists are now starting to make their mark in reggaeton. Imbued with the essence, swagger, and lingo of Mexico, reggaeton Mexa is the next big Latin sound that's going global.\n\nOriginating in the Caribbean, reggaeton evolved from Panama’s reggae en español and Jamaican dancehall of the 1980s. Puerto Rican acts like DJ Playero and DJ Nelson shaped the sound of reggaeton in the island's underground scene during the '90s, while Daddy Yankee, Tego Calderón, Don Omar, and Ivy Queen pushed the genre into the mainstream at the dawn of the new millennium.\n\nBoricua acts Tainy, Bad Bunny, and Ozuna pushed reggaeton into the next decade, though Colombia also brought about the genre's second wind. J Balvin's success solidified Medellín as a reggaeton hotbed, spawning Maluma, Karol G, and Feid as global stars.\n\nLearn more: The Sonic And Cultural Evolution Of Reggaeton In 10 Songs\n\nIn the 2020s, Mexico is becoming the next hub for reggaeton as artists who grew up listening to the Puerto Rican OGs — as well as Mexican acts Ghetto Kids and Pablito Mix — are now putting their own stamp on the genre. In late 2022, Bellakath put a spotlight on reggaeton Mexa with her viral hit \"Gatita\"; the following year, Yng Lvcas took the sound to new heights with his \"La Bebé\" remix featuring Peso Pluma, which reached No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nReggaeton Mexa pulls from the genre's underground roots in Puerto Rico, infusing its songs with Mexican culture and grit. Lyrics are full of Mexican slang that reflect life in the barrios.\n\n\"Reggaeton Mexa is reminiscent of the sounds of the '90s and 2000s from Puerto Rican DJs like Playero and Joe,\" El Mallila, one of the reggaeton Mexa leaders, tells GRAMMY.com. \"The songs, the beats, and rhythms are more or less similar to that flow. The difference here is the Mexican jargon. Reggaeton Mexa is spicy. We play with Mexican profanities without being offensive.\"\n\nThe emerging genre has gained traction among the larger reggaeton community with Jowell y Randy, Maldy, and J Balvin recently featuring on their songs. Following the success of Yng Lvcas, Bellakath, and El Malilla, Mexican acts like Peso Pluma (who dedicated part of his Éxodo album to reggaeton) and pop star Kenia Os are embracing the wave. As the tide continues to rise for reggaeton Mexa, GRAMMY.com is highlighting seven of the sound's leading artists.\n\nYng Lvcas\n\nGuadalajara, Jalisco native Yng Lvcas noted that no one around him could name a Mexican reggaeton artist, so he decided to fill that void.\n\nAn early encounter would make for auspicious beginnings. As he was signing a record contract with Warner early last year, Yng Lvcas crossed paths with Peso Pluma. The música Mexicana star's first foray in reggaeton was with Yng Lvcas and their global hit, a sensual remix of \"La Bebé.\" Their collaboration became the first reggaeton song by Mexican artists to enter the Hot 100 chart.\n\nLast October, Yng Lvcas released his album Super Estrellas to put a spotlight on more reggaeton Mexa acts. The LP included songs with El Malilla and El Bogueto. Puerto Rican OG Maldy later teamed up with Yng Lvcas for the hypnotic \"Diviértete.\"\n\nBellakath\n\nThe first artist to get the global conversation started about reggaeton Mexa was Bellakath. After earning a law degree from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the Mexico City native became a social media personality. Bellakath leveraged her following to start her music career, which exploded in late 2022 with the frisky \"Gatita.\" The song went viral on TikTok and the music video has over 144 million views on YouTube.\n\nIn the male-dominated reggaeton Mexa scene, Bellakath is continuing to keep women on top. Last year, she released her debut album Kittyponeo with the hit \"Reggaeton Champagne\" featuring Dani Flow. After signing with Warner in May, Bellakath dropped \"Sandunguea,\" which sampled the reggaeton classic \"Mayor Que Yo\" by Luny Tunes. On July 15, Bellakath released her second album, Sata 42, where she ventured into dembow music with artists from the Dominican Republic.\n\nLearn more: 5 Women Essential To Reggaeton: Ivy Queen, Natti Natasha, Karol G, Ms Nina & Mariah Angeliq\n\nEl Malilla\n\nEl Malilla proudly represents the chakalones (Mexican slang for \"bad boys\") in reggaeton Mexa. Hailing from Valle de Chalco, El Malilla remembers his first encounter with reggaeton as a teen came from the pirated CDs that were sold at the tianguis, or open-air markets.\n\nNow, El Malilla is bringing Mexico's version of reggaeton to the forefront. He recently released his debut album ÑEROSTARS, which includes his viral hit \"B de Bellako\" with Yeyo. Back in May, Puerto Rican OGs Jowell y Randy jumped on a remix of the quirky banger.\n\nEl Malilla also wants to make reggaeton Mexa more inclusive. Reggaeton has historically excluded LGBTQIA+ folks, though queer artists such as Young Miko, Villano Antillano, and La Cruz are changing that tune. On the Mexican front, El Malilla wanted to be an ally to his queer fans with the 2000-inspired \"Rebote\" music video, which was shot at the gay club Spartacus with Mexican drag queens.\n\nWithin his album, El Malilla is also stretching the bounds of his artistry by exploring merengue in \"Coronada\" and experimenting with house music in \"Todo Tiene Su Final.\" \"ÑEROSTARS is a call to all the reggaeton Mexa artists to dare themselves to make new music and try different sounds,\" he says. \"Don’t stay in your comfort zone just making perreo.\"\n\nYeri Mua\n\nVeracruz native Yeri Mua is keeping a high heel firmly planted on the neck of the genre, holding it down for the women in reggaeton Mexa.\n\nMua started out doing makeup tutorials on YouTube and later grew a massive social media following. Last year, she launched her music career on Uzielito Mix's reggaeton romp \"Línea del Perreo,\" which has over 103 million streams on Spotify. In songs like \"Chupon,\" Mua brings a fierce femininity to reggaeton Mexa while flipping the genre's explicit lyrics from a woman's perspective. In April, Kenia Os tapped Mua and Ghetto Kids for her reggaeton Mexa banger \"Mamita Rica.\" With a laugh, Os told GRAMMY.com at the time, \"[Mua] sounds very sexy and makes noises like meowing. It felt very great to work with her.\" Last month, Mua signed a record contract with Sony Music México.\n\nEl Bogueto\n\nAlongside El Malilla, El Bogueto is one of the OGs of reggaeton Mexa. The Nezahualcóyotl native has scored a number of hits since 2021, including \"Tu Favo\" and \"G Low Kitty,\" which has nearly 60 million streams on Spotify.\n\nThe title of El Bogueto's 2023 debut album Reggaetoñerito is an amalgamation of the words reggaetonero and ñero, which is Mexican slang for a person from the hood. El Bogueto has continued to rack up millions of streams with his LP, which include hits like the freaky reggaeton romp \"Piripituchy\" and \"Dale Bogueto.\" In May, J Balvin gave his co-sign to El Bogueto and the reggaeton Mexa scene when he jumped on an all-star remix of \"G Low Kitty.\"\n\nYeyo\n\nAmong the artists on this list, Yeyo is the freshest one on the reggaeton Mexa scene, but he's fast becoming one of the genre's brightest stars and the go-to artist for a hit collaboration. The Zacatepec, Morelos native is a protege of Ghetto Kids' Luis Díaz, who also serves as his manager.\n\nYeyo's playful and infectious flow as a Mexican reggaetonero has translated into million of streams in songs like \"B de Bellako\" with El Malilla and \"Mami Chakalosa\" alongside Bellakath. He has also flexed a romantic side to his distinct voice in Ghetto Kids' recent hit \"En El Ghetto #5 (La Discoteca).\" Yeyo has also shined on the electronica-leaning reggaeton of \"Maldad\" and the sensual \"Tentación.\"\n\nUzielito Mix\n\nMany of the songs mentioned in this list wouldn't have been possible without Uzielito Mix. Following in the footsteps of Ghetto Kids and Pablito Mix, the Mexico City-based producer has become the backbone of the sound of reggaeton Mexa. Uzielito Mix produced Yeri Mua's hits like \"Línea del Perreo\" and \"Brattiputy.\" He also co-produced El Bogueto and El Mallila's \"G Low Kitty\" with DJ Rockwell, which J Balvin later hopped on.\n\nIn his stellar collaborations, Uzielito Mix is known for uniting many of the reggaeton Mexa stars. He continues to push the sound of the genre into the future like in the spooky \"Espantan\" remix with El Bogueto, Alnz G, Dani Flow, and Tensec. In 2022, Bad Bunny tapped Uzielito Mix to open his World's Hottest Tour stops in Mexico City.\n\nThe Latest News About Latin Music\n\nÁlvaro Díaz has a twinkle in his eye — he knows he’s onto something special.\n\n\"It’s crazy that it’s an alternative album, but also the most reggaeton I’ve ever made,\" Díaz says of his recently-released sophomore album, Sayonara. \"It’s both worlds. I have my fingers crossed that people are going to love it.\"\n\nDíaz, who is 28, has been making music since he was a teenager. A constant creative force, he grinded for years as an independent artist, building a solid fanbase in Puerto Rico before breaking into the wider Latin urbano scene with 2021 debut, Felicilandia, which layered fresh pop melodies onto playful reggaeton and trap beats, exploring the euphoria of love.\n\nNotably darker and much more experimental than its predecessor, Sayonara marks the end of that \"happyland\" feeling.\n\n\"My story with ‘Felicilandia’ ended in heartbreak,\" he tells GRAMMY.com. \"I was just writing about my life. It’s like a nightmare when you can’t stop thinking of that person. The usual Puerto Rican [reaction] to a breakup is like,'Don’t worry, let’s go to the streets!'\"\n\nThe first half of the record soundtracks this feeling of party and abandon. Perreo tracks like the Feid-featuring dancefloor banger \"Gatas Sandungueras Vol.1\" nod to old school reggaeton, while Diaz and guest Tainy twist into ravey house beats on \"Fatal Fantassy.\"\n\nWith an assist from Spanish indie pop star Sen Senra, \"1000Canciones\" marks a turning point in the album’s mood. It’s slow, reflective and poignant, with unashamedly heartfelt lyrics. \"I went to the streets, and played 1000 songs that reminded me of you / even though I knew it was late / I took my phone to call you,\" Diaz sings in Spanish.\n\nLovingly nicknamed \"Sadvarito\"by fans, Diáz’s vulnerability stands out amidst a reggaeton scene dominated by party hits and swag. Even the biggest hits on Felicilandia— \"Lori Party\" and \"Babysita </3\" — were tinged with heartbreak; and fans will be reassured to see his signature fragility thoroughly embedded in Sayonara.\n\n\"It’s just how I feel, sometimes I feel empty, sometimes there’s a lot to say,\" Díaz says of the album’s changing moods.\n\nAt the end of the album, Díaz considers trying to get back with his former flame (\"Quizás si, quizás no,\" featuring Quevedo). But, he soon realizes it won’t work: \"You know it’s not the same — it’s just me saying 'Sayonara,'\" he says.\n\nGRAMMY.com spoke with Díaz over Zoom about why reggaeton is the perfect heartbreak genre and how ‘Sayonara’ is his most experimental work yet.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nSayonara **comes three years after your debut, Felicilandia. There are some similarities in the two albums’ artwork, but we can see something’s gone a bit awry/**\n\nThere’s an explosion at the left of the Felicilandia artwork. We were predicting what was going to come. I’m a fan of when artists do these little things, merge album covers, or make songs that live in the same universe.\n\nFelicilandia is the way to find happiness, Sayonara is saying goodbye to the happiness you thought you found.\n\nWhen you’re with a person you create a world together. But, todo se fue a la mierda. That world has gone. On [the artwork for] Sayonara, I’m looking ahead, but you don’t know my intention. I could try to save everything, or I’m just taking the last look.\n\nThe track ‘‘Gatitas Sandungueras Vol. 1’ feat. Feid, has dark undertones, even though it’s a song about partying. How is the track related to the album’s main theme of overcoming heartbreak?\n\nMe and Feid put everything into the song. It’s based on the story of missing her: you’re blind; you’re trying not to think about her.\n\nFeid is like my duo, we always talk about making projects together, and our fanbase likes it when we work together. He couldn’t be out of ‘=Sayonara —he was in Felicilandia singing a sad song, and now he’s singing a party song, so it’s a total contrast.\n\nSame with Rauw Alejandro, who is on the track \"BYAK,\" and was also on Felicilandia single \"Problemón.\" It’s special to have Feid and Rauw on both albums. We didn’t want to repeat what we did before, we wanted to go in another direction.\n\nThe album mixes a lot of different genres, but reggaeton is definitely at the foundation of Sayonara. What artists were your core inspirations?\n\nThe selection of the sounds, and the beats, reminds me of the golden era of reggaeton in the 2000s. We even used the old Fruity Loops software, and searched for inspiration in [LunyTunes & Tainy 2006 album] Mas Flow: Los Benjamins, or the [2003 compilation album], Blin Blin. All those albums that changed your life in Puerto Rico. That’s why the reggaeton tracks have 2000 vibes, it’s what I listen to.\n\nYou’re known for making an emotional brand of reggaeton. When did you first explore reggaeton’s potential to be more vulnerable?\n\nMy fans’ favorite songs are my most heartfelt songs. Maybe my most played song on Felicilandia is \"Problemón,\" but on tour, the song people go crazy for is \"Babysita.\" It’s a song I recorded in my house, but it’s bigger than all my other tracks.\n\nSo, I know how the people who follow me connect with me. The way I talk about heartbreak speaks to a lot of people; it’s more relatable than how other people sing about it. They call me \"Sadvarito,\" so it was always a challenge to find a way to bring that Sadvarito energy to reggaeton.\n\nWhat is your favorite reggaeton heartbreak song?\n\nDamn, there’s a lot. It’s hard.\n\nMy favorite reggaetoneros growing up were Zion & Lennox, they were my GOATS, and most of their songs are heartbreak songs. So, Zion & Lennox, \"Solo Una Noche.\"\n\nThere’s also a song on [Luny Tunes-produced 2005 compilation album] Mas Flow 2 which is my favorite ever: \"Es Mejor Olvidarlo.\" That’s my jam. I used to blast that when I was little. I didn’t know heartbreak then, but I felt that.\n\nSo you can cry to reggaeton?\n\nYou definitely can! Old school people may say you can’t, but, ey, reggaeton be having feeling. It will make you feel a type of way in a club. It could change your mood completely.\n\nConnecting with fans is everything to you. On Sayonara, how are you hoping to reach people?\n\nI have a really hard time saying goodbye. There’s a phrase: la esperanza es lo último que se pierde, I’m one of those types of guys; the last one who loses hope even if my world is going to pieces. I want to make her fall in love, like on the track \"Quien te quiere como el nene.\" It’s saying I really love you, I want to fix things.\n\nThe point of the album is for people to see what chapter they’re in. I’ve never been able to reach the last track, to finally be able to say Sayonara, but I know I will get there!\n\nOne woman who listened to the album said it’s awesome to hear a man’s perspective — you go out and party, and then you miss her. She said, usually, for girls, it’s the other way around: you miss him at the beginning, then you go out to party. It gives it realism, boys really be like that. I love it when real life and music come together. I really hope people find themselves in the songs.\n\n\"Quien te quiere como el nene\" is one of the more experimental tracks on the album, and unexpectedly goes into a drum and bass rhythm. How did that come about?\n\nI did that whole beat with my mouth! I had it in my mind. I had the bass, but it needed a sound there. I don’t know why but I started making these sounds. I sent a demo to Tainy and asked, \"Do you think you can do this?\" Obviously, he can, he’s Tainy. Alongside Manuel Lara, my main producer, they took it to the next level. They are a dream team.\n\nYou break from the reggaeton beat a lot in the album — \"Fatal Fantassy\" is very house. Tell us about these electro elements.\n\nI like to experiment with different sounds. It’s harder for me to do reggaeton than do experimental things. Different tracks just come naturally. Tainy and I were listening to the album after we had 60 percent of it ready, and we felt like it was missing energy, it needed a bit more uptempo. So we did three sessions and came up with those ideas.\n\nI made a playlist with everything I want to do in the album, so I could say \"I want a riff like this.\" I like to take a lot of ideas and work them little by little. My process is different to a lot of my friends who go to the studio and make three or four songs a day. I really like to feel like what I’m creating.\n\nYou’re in Japan right now, and this album frequently mentions Japanese words, people and culture: from \"Sayonara,\" \"Kawa,\" \"Majin Buu\" and \"Yoko.\" How did Japan influence you?\n\nJapan is really important in this album, the names, the creation. I didn’t want it to be obvious, but it’s there, in the minimalism, the names, It’s magical for me to be now in Japan and listen to the album. I can say, damn this song feels like Toyko, this one feels like Osaka. Now I’m in Kyoto, and I feel \"Quien te quiere como el nene\" is definitely a song for this city.\n\nI’m a cinematographic guy, I create songs with movies on mute. I recreate the vibe, how I feel it would sound. Even movies filmed in Japan, like ‘Lost in Translation’—I watched that a lot and was inspired by that. That feeling of being lost, of not knowing what’s next.\n\n\"Majin Buu\" is one of the most heartfelt tracks on this album, and references a \"Dragon Ball Z\" villain. Why do you draw on that character?\n\nIt’s a 2024 alternative love poem! He’s a bad guy, but I flip and use it in a good way.\n\nI like to play with names, most of the time I have the name of the song. I knew I wanted to make a song with Majin Buu but I didn’t know how it was going to sound. The same day I made \"Majin Buu,\" I made the track \"Yoko.\"\n\nSpeaking of \"Yoko,\" do you relate to the person who has been painted as the bad guy?\n\nDefinitely. When I watched the Get Back documentary about the Beatles on Disney+, I remember seeing Yoko every single moment beside John Lennon. They were inseparable until his last day. All the Beatles had a family, they all had wives, but it was Yoko who was next to John at every moment.\n\nIt was a romantic way to say, I want you by my side like Yoko was with John Lennon.\n\nYou're very close to your fanbase. Is there anything that artists can do to stay grounded with their fans? As you’re getting bigger, how do you manage the relationship with fans?\n\nFans made me. Especially during those years when my project didn’t have the light it deserved, my fans were there for me. It’s important for me to have a healthy relationship with them.\n\nI always try to put myself in the shoes of a 16-year-old and think what things could he say to me to make me fall in love with this project?, or what did this artist do that made me a superfan? I try to create experiences. In the run-up to releasing Sayonara, we did listening parties with 15 fans in different parts of the world, with exclusive merch. Seeing the reactions of the people is important for me.\n\nI’ve been making music since 2012. Some [artists] don’t know the hustle; they get big after two to three years. But [success] is not given, it’s earned. I get the rockstar mentality, but that’s not me. It’s impossible for me to lose touch with the fans.\n\n[Sayonara] is a celebration for me and for the fans. I want to do small shows in Puerto Rico, places I played when I was started. I love the shows where you can feel people’s emotions. When you get big, you kind of lose that. But to me, that connection is magical, I never want to lose that.\n\nKenia Os Unveils Her 'Pink Aura': How The Mexican Pop Star Let Her Feminine Energy Shine\n\nWhen Mañana Será Bonito, the fourth studio album by Karol G, came out in February 2023, its release had been preceded by two momentous hit singles that changed the face of Latin music.\n\nPanoramic in scope, slick and airy, but also imbued with an intense and lyrical emotional depth, the songs \"Provenza\" and \"Cairo\" combined pop, reggaetón and an alternative edge with panache, and confirmed the Colombian singer/songwriter as one of the biggest pop stars in the planet. Mañana Será Bonito would go on to win Latin GRAMMYs for Album Of The Year and Best Urban Music Album, as well as her first-ever GRAMMY for Best Música Urbana Album in 2024.\n\nKarol G wasn’t alone in these accomplishments. Most of the songs on the album were helmed by her longtime producer, Ovy on the Drums. Like Karol herself, 33 year-old Daniel Echavarría Oviedo hails from Medellín. The pair started working together at the very beginning of their careers, and Ovy was behind the haute couture sonics of \"Tusa,\" the 2019 collaboration with Nicki Minaj that first established Karol as a major contender in Latin pop.\n\n\"There is a chemistry when we work together that I cannot quite describe with words,\" Ovy says over Zoom from his home in Florida. It’s a weekday morning, and he sits by his keyboard producing station; from time to time, he will play imaginary chords as he searches for the right words for an answer. His attitude remains humble throughout the conversation — even after significant success and a triumphant world tour, where he accompanied Karol on most concert dates.\n\n\"I still remember the specific moment when I asked her if she would let me do production work with her,\" he tells GRAMMY.com. \"We keep talking whenever we’re in the studio. She is very clear in her direction; ‘I want this song to sound like that,’ or, ‘Give it another spin and see if we can make it better.’\"\n\nOvy has since been inspired to branch out into different challenges. The latest one is Cassette 01, a six-song EP with Puerto Rican A-list rapper Myke Towers. The EP is the first in a series of cassette-themed mixtapes that will include a different collaborator on each new installment. \"The concept of releasing cassette-themed EPs in the year 2024 is really exciting to me,\" Ovy says. \"It’s linked to the history of pop music, and the way we consume songs.\"\n\nKnown for high-voltage, sexed-up urbano anthems like \"La Playa\" (2020) and \"LALA\" (2023), Towers adds his imprint to the songs, but Ovy’s futuristic aesthetic is all over the EP. \"It’s true that the loop in the beginning has my personal touch,\" Ovy says with a laugh when I point out that the intro to \"AMOR NARCÓTICO\" is trademark Ovy. \"Sometimes people tell me that a song has that unique touch of mine, and it really seems unbelievable to me when I hear it.\"\n\nOn \"BELLAQUERÍA,\" he mixes synth patches with real riffs performed by his longtime guitar player; the contrast between organic and digitized is prevalent in his stylistic panoply. And his trademark battle call — the almost dub-like cry of \"O-O-O-vy on the Drumsss\" is the seal of distinction that pops up in every single production.\n\nOvy on the Drums and Myke Towers┃SEBA\n\nMusically speaking, Colombia sits on a highly strategic place: next door to the fertile Caribbean islands where reggae, salsa, merengue and calypso originated — but also close enough to the airwaves of mainstream American pop. Growing up, Ovy listened to a bit of everything, and gravitated naturally to lush records with majestic grooves.\n\n\"I loved Bob Marley as a kid,\" he says. \"At home, of course, they would play a lot of salsa at parties, and hits of the time like 'Mayonesa' [a tropi-pop smash by Uruguayan band Chocolate.] I was also crazy about Modern Talking’s ‘Brother Louie’ and the Pet Shop Boys’ ‘Go West.’ Those are the songs that defined my childhood.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he continues employing FL Studio — the same producing software that he used at the very beginning of his journey.\n\n\"I’ll never stop using it,\" he promises. \"I just can’t see myself on another platform. I used to dream about meeting the software creators, and now they follow me on Instagram and gave me every available plug-in. I’ve been producing music for the past 11 years, and I think I only know a good half of everything there is to learn on FL.\"\n\nCollaborating with other high-profile artists and finishing up a promised solo album are high on Ovy's priority list.\n\n\"At the beginning, I was trying to turn my solo project into a conceptual work — but that’s easier said than done,\" he admits. \"In the end, I realized that I just wanted to make some good music with a well chosen set of guest artists, and let the beats speak for themselves. I’d say my solo album is about 50 percent done at this point.\"\n\nKarol G recently released \"CONTIGO,\" a Euro-leaning, pop-EDM single with Tiësto. It remains to be seen if the diva will rely as tightly on her usual partner in crime as she begins work on her upcoming fifth album.\n\n\"When she had some free time off touring, I happened to be busy with the CASSETTE project,\" Ovy says. \"Since then, we connected again and have been recording a bunch of songs. But I can’t really tell what will happen on the next album. And I think it’s good that Karol is collaborating with other producers and composers, searching for different avenues and sounds. We’re definitely on the same page in allowing things to happen the way they are supposed to.\"\n\nHe pauses for a moment, then adds with an extra wave of enthusiasm:\n\n\"I will always be there for her. Our common objective hasn’t really changed. We must always work hard, and come up with cool new songs.\"\n\nMañana Y Siempre: How Karol G Has Made The World Mas Bonito"
