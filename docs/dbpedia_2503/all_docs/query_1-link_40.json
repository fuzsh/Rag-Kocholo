        "text": "Where did this song come from? It’s an otherworldly, transcendent forecast of a bleak future. If you only know Nina Simone’s voice from her jazz standards, peek into this track for a hint of her musical capabilities beyond her signature blues.\n\n“22nd Century” can be overwhelming. From a dreadful vantage point, Simone recounts how people are barely breathing, bodies are in distress. Given that the song was released in 1971, and songs around the 1950s-70s often looked towards the year 2000 when picturing decades ahead, I am forever curious as to what led to this perception of life several centuries away.\n\nThe music ripples and Simone’s voice is strongest even when it succumbs to a shaken vibrato. Nina Simone was a consummate storyteller whose forte was oriented in jazz and blues. That the song emanates sorrow and fear is not unusual fare in her repertoire.\n\nShe describes a timeline from when a plague struck and from there all life was a suffocating struggle. She fondly nods to 1972 and mentions people being free but just a few years later, all is devastated:\n\n“Your heart is a plastic thing which can be bought.”\n\n“Young men die in spring.”\n\nI am not sure anyone could ever do an interpretation of the lyrics that would match the intentions of the artist herself. The richly-detailed and heavy content requires several reviews and re-listening to “22nd Century” in order to grasp the complete narration.\n\nThe tropical sound of steel drums is quite a juxtaposition against the grim settings of the future presented to the listener. Perhaps these sounds echo remembrances of the past. These sounds could be the last vestiges of a civilization prior to the end times of the late 20th century.\n\nThis is a truly complex and fascinating song worth the nearly nine minute length and it sings like profound, poetic fiction."
