        "text": "Zut! is a collaborative exhibition which celebrates the intersection of art and design. Occupying an 18th century mansion on 72 rue de l’Université in the 7th arrondissement, this immersive exhibition is the brainchild of 7 international galleries: A1043 (Paris, France), Deli Gallery (New York, USA), Friedman/Johnson (New York/Miami, USA), Galerie Mitterrand (Paris, France), Salon 94 Design (New York, USA), The Breeder (Athens, Greece), and Volume Gallery (Chicago, USA).\n\nBuilt in 1728 as the Hôtel de Guise, this once opulent hôtel particulier has been known under many names including Hôtel du président Chauvelin, Hôtel de Rougé, Hôtel de Mme de Lurcy and finally, L’Hôtel Chauvelin de Crisenoy. While its former grandeur eventually fell into romantic decay, it has more recently become inspiration for artists and curators alike who have breathed new life into its derelict shell. Zut! embraces the building’s storied past, and responds with different visions of how contemporary art and design can synergistically co-exist. Installed in this modern ruin, each installation triggers the imagination with a sense of possibility, impermanence, and play.\n\nAlissa Friedman in collaboration with Nina Johnson Gallery are thrilled to present Amy Bessone, Nasim Hantehzadeh, Yukultji Napangati and Katie Stout, four artists and designers whose work celebrates hybridity, storytelling, and ornamentation. While hailing from across the globe (Los Angeles; Iran; The Western Desert of Australia; New York), each of our featured artists mine history, mythology, and traditional craft practices to create artworks and objects that are both highly personal and insistently contemporary. Glass, ceramics, metal work, Persian rug design, calligraphy, ceremonial body art and sand painting are the starting points from which their stories emerge."
