        "text": "Margaret Harner can't say \"no!\" For over 50 years, Margaret has been the \"go to\" researcher, historian and popular teacher for projects that celebrate and preserve the history of her beloved hometown. Writing for a Walking Tour of Boyertown, the community's celebration of its sesquicentennial, the local Lutheran church's anniversary, a pictorial history book of Boyertown, the one-day-at-a-time social history featuring vignettes of 19th century Boyertown, and her current passion: the General Carl Spaatz National USAAF Museum, Margaret brings the community's history and its remarkable people to life. An incredibly warm and generous woman, Margaret has inspired Jane throughout her life.\n\nOn a drive through Boyertown, Colonel Keith Seiwell, USMC looked for a museum dedicated to one of World War II's heroes, General Carl Spaatz, that he was certain existed in the General's hometown. When he realized one did not exist, he was determined to create one to honor General Spaatz and all those from is hometown that served. In an extraordinary effort over 2 years while a pandemic shut down much of the world, Colonel Seiwell and fewer than 2 dozen volunteers have created a museum--and an experience--inviting visitors to participate as a pilot, a casualty, and a POW. The Colonel shares his own history dedicated to military service, his experiences in creating the museum, the talented volunteers and their outstanding contributions, and his vision for the museum's future.\n\nBarbara Lehmann: Resilience Personified. Barbara has been through and continues to struggle through some serious and scary, medical issues. Yet, by all accounts, she maintains an inspiring, positive—“don’t tell me what I can’t do; just watch me do it” attitude that inspires her friends. Listen to her story and be inspired, too!\n\nHeather Chandler is intent on maintaining Sealstrip Corporation's status on Pennsylvania's list of best places to work, and it shows in the many ways the company cares about its employees' health and well-being. There's recess every Thursday. Tuesdays provide healthy snacks. Creative themed projects highlight the company's goals. Leadership teams work toward greater productivity and safety. There's no stopping her efforts to improve her own life and her beloved workplace.\n\nAs Spotify closes out my option to record on their site, I am charged to learn to do so on another platform. I'm hopeful I will learn. But...if the transition is more difficult than I anticipate, you'll know why I have not dropped any new episodes. Let us hope I learn quickly and not give up!\n\nAn icon in the Boyertown community, Ralph Borneman shares his life's journey following the loss of his mother at 7 years old including his athletic and teaching years, his entry into the insurance world, and the many father-figures provided him along the way. \"People helping people\" is what he does for the love of it.\n\nOral surgeon and community leader Jack Lignelli reviews a lifetime of achievements that began with his father's expectation of A's in all subjects on his report cards. Commenting on his own efforts in the establishment of the Boyertown Sports Center and the Boyertown YMCA building, he acknowledges the many other community members who led their expertise toward the success of the projects. And there's special pride in the practice he's built and the care he's provided a lifetime of patients.\n\nCareer vet, Corey Mason is a man of many passions and, now retired from his military service, is intent on pursuing as many hobbies as he possibly can: video production, spirit investigation, metal detecting, inventing mocktails and supporting spaces where folks can hang out together without numbing out with alcohol. His journey includes some tough challenges, but he's out on top!\n\nArtisan Minna Aaparyti has memories of walks through the woods to get to and from school in Finland. Her art in many mediums showcases her long-held love of nature. Participants in her workshops will find her eager to share the creative processes in relaxing sessions. And they'll take what they've created home with them. Minna is eager to resume her artistic life close to nature in an upcoming move to the Oley Valley from Fishtown.\n\nSusan Grabert's home is rich with art in many mediums--her own, her photographer husband's, paintings and sculptures from local artists and from artists and fine crafts people from all over the world. Her artistic journey is rich in experiences and challenges whether creating a painting-a-day for 30 days or moving from hyper-realistic still lifes to paintings of African wildlife hidden in patterns.\n\nRobyn Burckhardt's friends want to spend time with her in her studio--creating, venting, relaxing--for they know that any time spent with Robyn will be full of energy and joy. She'll splash paint on your blank canvas, as needed, to get you started. And from there, anything goes. It's just so much fun. And healing, too.\n\nJules Hull, familiar to many as an accomplished plumber, emerges as author in his memoir Blessings Afforded a Common Man, offering his experiences throughout his life allowing him to see God's presence and \"direction\" in his life. Common, perhaps, in an unpretentious lifestyle, yet Jules reveals an uncommon awareness of where the pieces of life's puzzle fit in building a life and developing relationships in simple, yet engaging and accomplished, prose.\n\nSeveral days before he passed, Charles Haddad called to say he was willing to record a \"B Inspired\" podcast with me and Pastor Bob Machamer. In a wide-ranging conversation, Bob Machamer, pastor serving Charles' beloved St. John's Lutheran Church in Boyertown, shares his understanding of Charles' as community leader, role model, and personal friend. Pastor Bob illuminates Charles' vision of the community's future, his earnest hopes that young leaders would emerge to further the mission he had spent his life supporting: nothing less than the unconditional acceptance of all members of the community working together to improve its infrastructure, maintain quality education, and strengthen its support of the arts, history, and cultural opportunities. Too much to say in 30+ minutes, we'll catch up with Pastor Bob on his own sometime soon.\n\nBill Cherkasky got \"hooked\" while touring the high school's \"old building\" before its latest renovations that would remove all the old wood found in its classroom doors and the framing of the classrooms' slate blackboards. Eager to preserve as much as he could, Bill created projects--video projects and visual art ones--raised funding to sponsor the projects, and found new \"homes\" for items of value to avoid landfills.\n\nThis “B Inspired” episode, recorded over a year ago is full of the “feels\" and will warm your heart during winter's chill! If you love your fur babies, you’ll love the story of “Tyrone,” the miracle cat that overcame obstacle after obstacle and inspired neighborhood \"saints\" Beth Ashcom and Maria Trampé to establish the non-profit “All Souls Connected,\" a “trap, neuter, and release” organization to stop the over-breeding of feral cats. Their lives have changed somewhat, but you’ll be inspired to learn of their unique business that had to be abandoned “Wayward Whiskers Art Studios,” featuring custom art and jewelry. \"TyDrops Forever Memories” offers unique memorials containing the ashes of loved ones suspended in glass. You’ll want to read Tyrone’s blog that has inspired thousands of people. Tyrone has over 17,000 followers around the world. Unbelievable. Inspiring. Unbelievably inspiring!

Her childhood dream as captain of her twirling team provided Melanie with the leadership skills, commitment, and drive to fill challenging roles within her community as teacher and executive director of the YMCA and continue to climb the corporate ladder of responsibility with the YMCA organization all while making sure her family's needs were met.\n\nAmy Muzopappa's photo on Facebook that showcased a stance during her First Place routine demonstrating Forms in a Bucks County Marital Arts Tournament inspired this episode. After turning 50, Amy decided she was going to follow the advice from Shawshank Redemption to \"get busy living\" in her \"fight\" with an autoimmune condition. She signed up to learn martial arts, and she decided to be more open about \"fighting\" to live despite her condition. (The episode was recorded for the podcast Both Sides Now co-hosted by Ross (Yergz) Yerger and Jane.\n\nI had to \"surprise\" Lesley Misko during one of The Boyertown Area Expression's executive committee meetings--a.k.a. one of our \"gab\" sessions over lunch--by quickly pushing the \"record\" button before she could object. She's been shyly, slyly avoiding being the subject of a \"B Inspired\" conversation. But, we did it and had a good time exploring the mission and intent of our project, thanking our contributors, and encouraging more expression from the community!\n\n\"B Inspired\" offers a New Year's Special! Ross (Yergz) Yerger and I recorded a \"Both Sides Now\" episode when he came back to Boyertown to celebrate Thanksgiving with his family. I recorded it as a bonus episode on \"B Inspired\" thinking to give my listeners a \"taste\" of our new-ish podcast! Technical difficulties occurred and the episode is recorded in three parts. So...here ya go! Maybe you'll \"be inspired\" to become a subscriber to \"Both Sides Now\" on Spotify or a host of other platforms. Happy New Year from us both...now!\n\nIn case you missed it, we're offering this episode about mural artist Chris B. Murray as an encore presentation. In under three weeks, mural artist Chris spray painted his colorful and whimsical design \"A Better Bear\" onto the west side of Boyertown, PA's Rita’s Water Ice building. Chris never made a \"Plan B,\" so making a living for himself and his family as an artist--his \"Plan A\"--is a most satisfying accomplishment. There was never a doubt in his own mind and those of his parents and teachers that his talents would bring him success--after some difficult, lean years.\n\nRoss (Yergz) Yerger and Jane took advantage of his visit to family over Thanksgiving to record a \"B Inspired\" episode face-to-face. The episode provides a taste of the energy, content, and tone of the podcast they created together recently titled \"Both Sides Now\" that can be found on yergz.com along with his podcast \"Up the Middle\" and his Monday-Friday LIVE radio show. Check us out: we have some fun. (A previous episode with Yergz was dropped August 4, 2023, that provides info about his background and motivation.)\n\nRandy Renninger, BASH grad Class of 2014, is passionate about his work involving graphic design and planning events to bring video game players together face-to-face as a way to provide another team sport that can include everybody. He is happy in his hometown but connects with his partner and tons of players of all ages through his phone. Playing games is a lucrative business these days. Who knew?!

His new business--Crossroads--is a beautifully renovated space where students of all ages can learn to play instruments--guitar, ukulele, and piano for now--with other options to come; participate in workshops; stage a performance; purchase musical instruments or other merchandise; showcase their visual art in the gallery; or just hang out with others who love music and art. The episode features Doug and Evan Cole, Crossroads' music and voice instructor. Visit guitarsandart.com and take the tour of this amazing space to learn and create. https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/jane-stahl/episodes/Guitars-and-Art-Crossroads-of-Creativity-e2bdlr9\n\nPastor Dave Bitler of St. John Hill asks, “Does Your Tattoo Have a Story?” And then he listens carefully to folks eager to tell the secrets of their soul. “Stories are important,” he offers; “it’s where lives intersect with Jesus. And that’s the point of evangelism—giving meaning to communion.” Approaching people who are often shunned because of their body art has changed Dave's ministry--from \"telling\" to listening. His own story features unscripted paths from a dream of becoming a music teacher to a degree in business and computer and employment as an IT guy developing internet systems for companies to (finally, his friends tell him) entering the seminary. And an out-of-the-blue phone call inviting him to join a fellow pastor to hunt tattoo stories has led to his unique form of evangelism.\n\nIn our third \"B Inspired\" episode, Joe shares the multiple meanings behind his art as expression as man's necessity for survival and especially his current series that contains elements from cave art and native cultures. Always a fascinating interview, Joe's knowledge of spiritual matters that comes largely from his wide reading and life experiences--first as a cult member and then as a deprogrammer--is mind-opening. An award-winner in Studio B's \"What Inspires YOU?\" exhibit, he articulates the many inspirations behind his work.\n\nRachel Trettin, owner of The Gilbertsville Farm, admits that she’s no farmer; however, she is an impressive, self-educated young entrepreneur who runs a 5-acre high-tech farm maze on County Line Road, Gilbertsville, each September through December. Her father created the second corn maze in the country, and when she was 6 years old, knew that she wanted to run her own corn maze someday. And, at 31 she's living her dream. Lots of add-ons are features of The Gilbertsville Farm’s maze.In addition to the corn maze, The Gilbertsville Farm is a family-friendly venue for events. Always eager to talk to young people, she wants them to know that if she can own her own business—even without an official college degree—they can do it too. And she has plans to further her ideal of making The Gilbertsville Farm a go-to destination and to own additional businesses--following in the footsteps of her father, a serial entrepreneur.\n\nReflecting on how Boyertown's Oktoberfest began is the subject of this week's episode. Spurred by a challenge from community leader Charles Haddad, Jeff and Cindy Karver initiated the community's popular and successful event that not only survived the first year's economic downturn, chaired it for five years and have watched it grow bigger and better each successive year. Having just celebrated its 16th year, the festival has a bright future and promises more fun for all."
