She navigated the difficult music industry landscape as a teen with her band Girl In a Coma (signed by Joan Jett), and did not come away unscathed. She transforms those difficult experiences into lessons for healing, and shares her revelations on the new studio album titled, I Could Be You, You Could Be Me. The record comes out on August 18, 2022. Pre-order HERE. Live performance at Hotel Café in Hollywood is confirmed for Saturday, September 10, 2022. Doors at 7:30 pm. Tickets HERE.\n\nDiaz says “we can build strength from trauma. My weakness can connect with others as well as my strength.” On the album Diaz sings, plays guitar, bass, and keyboards, while her husband Jorge Gonzalez plays drums. Live the duo will be “staying a two piece” she says, “a twist on the White Stripes vibe.”\n\n“Personality Confession” is the first in a series of music videos Diaz has produced for the album. See it HERE.\n\nDuring the pandemic she “created BeatGirlProductions where I recorded and produced my new record.” Now, as an engineer and producer, she welcomes other artists into her studio. She is intent on enjoying music again and sharing her healing with others that are still trying to find a new way of living through the pandemic.\n\nNina Diaz’ vocals and songwriting style bring to mind artists like Bjork, Jeff Buckley, PJ Harvey, Garbage, The Smiths, Patsy Cline, Patti Smith, Hole, Stone Temple Pilots, The Breeders, Alanis Morrisette, Nirvana or Gwen Stefani. As a solo artist (and together with her previous band) she shared the stage with musicians like Morrissey, Smashing Pumpkins, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, Tegan and Sara, Frank Black and the Catholics, Cyndi Lauper True Colors Tour, Social Distortion, Sia, Toadies, Carla Morrison, Dresden Dolls, David Garza and Alice Bag. Festival appearances include Polish Woodstock, Warped Tour, SXSW and El Cosmico Fest. She has performed live on television for Last Call With Carson Daily and ManiaTV with Dave Navarro.\n\nI Could Be You, You Could Be Me was produced by Nina Diaz who also engineered and mixed the album. It was recorded at BeatGirlProductions in San Antonio, TX and mastered for CD by Jerry Tubb at Terra Nova Mastering in Austin, TX. Edited mastering for digital release also by Nina Diaz.
