I am currently on an extended sabbatical from painting. Havenât touched brush in earnest since November 2020. These are from the first batch of solo big paintings I made following some collaborative ones with Ben Schumacher in 2018 and 2019. Back then I would rent a studio and paint in periods of about 3 months and then do 3 months of freelance programming work.\n\nThe contents of the paintings are both of nice interiors. The dancefloor in the back room at Sugarhill Supper Club during the Moira party and the hallway of Skarstedt gallery on the Upper East Side.\n\nAt the time I found it significant to make paintings that were much larger than the space I was making them in. Big enough that it was not possible to imagine them properly fitting anywhere they could be shown. I havenât seen these paintings stretched until now.\n\nIt is nicer to paint standing with arm fully outstretched than sitting down with back hunched over. Itâs good to take a lot of breaks. The time between painting is painting time too. You paint not to make a picture, but to find an image in a material that lasts - to talk to people who donât care about it yet.\n\nI believe a few things. The edges of a painting can be messy. A painting should be stretched. Oil paintings outlast photographs. A lot can be done still in a flat rectangle - seems like no one is really trying though.\n\nâ Michael Pollard, May 30 2024\n\nHana Earles Fiction April 27 - May 26\n\nEmma Hazen Roman Empire Dec 3 - March 1, 2024\n\nBefore the Dawn, I Saw a Prototype; Before the Tongs Pulled Up a Lobe of Sky: I Saw the Light! Reflected in Your Eye;\n\nâFor whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.â 1 John 5:4\n\nThere is no substitute for love, a practice and ideal which we may learn to cherish and understand all the more as substitutes for love increasingly overtake the surface of culture.\n\nThe present upheaval defies all analogy and prediction - it is at least as radical as (but probably much more than) that of the early 20th century. This situation de-ossifies the kitschified art movements of that time: Dada, futurism, surrealism, the shellshocked endeavor to render and midwife civilizationâs bursting open along seams we never knew were there.\n\nThe only task fine art has ever known (avowedly or not) is to render the Absolute as faithfully as its current resources allow it to. Today we have the power to render the insight that the power of the Absolute is completely, staggeringly unlimited.\n\nI prophesy an âabsolute cubismâ which discontinuously and differentially relates the aching immediacy of the world-spirit (geist) here in this present moment: the sublime transcendence of the production process generating, amplifying and tearing open industrial supply chains and collective cognition while human lifeworlds, aeons of history, wide-eyed aspirations, tender intimacies, misfired surges of genius, anguish, disavowed crimes and dreams dangle from its body like clothing: a nexus-wreath of desires expanding and contracting as they whirl into the sky, out of the clouds and into the stars.\n\nAbout six months ago, a few slabs of industrial insulation foam were gutted from the walls of a room somewhere and discarded near my apartment. I found them during my morning coffee run on the street alongside a stack of apparently brand-new (also discarded) air filters. Around the same time, some car wreckage was left behind after a crash I didnât witness. Whatever elapsed within that room and within that car, maybe over the course of years, I know it was infinitely important, some of it extremely private, maybe at certain moments unbearably passionate or perplexing. It all could have happened differently, probably should have, especially at certain key turning points, and now it canât be changed, because itâs gone.\n\nOnly an integralism of religion, art and science is worthy of our attention. There is much to leave behind. Those of us comfortable enough to submit to soft power are poisoned daily by aspiration-defying attention vacuums, self-diminishing habits, and fruitless, contradictory, spirit-enslaving, mirage-like moral ideals. Weâre not sure how we got into this coma but lack the hope, perspective and focus to plan out and adjudicate an alternative. Soon youâll look away, but remember: God is real and the world we knew is gone. Long live the infinity of noble mourning, the blossoming of the egalitarian human spirit and the fulfillment of eternal desire.\n\n\"Formalism\" as a principal concept insisting a supremacy of form over meaning in art and literature, first developed into two main schools: The New Criticism in America and the school of Russian Formalists. In 1926, directly after a bombshell published by Trotsky, called Literature and Revolution where he lampoons formalists for their respective lack of historical materialist praxis, Eikhenbaum was developing an alibi. In his essay 1927 The Theory of Formal Method he's letting us know that the formalists were originally united by the idea of \"abstracting\" and liberating poetic diction from the fetters of the intellectualism and moralism. It is generally admitted that \"abstraction\" is only an operational category. From its beginnings (1910-1914) seen as a goal (Kandinsky), or a stage toward the transcendence of art (Mondrian), it is nowadays only conceived as one genre among others. A formalist would question the destination of that abstraction, normally. They would demand a definition based on form, circularity, symmetry, economy of form, lack of economy of form or repetition. They would hesitate but potentially also consider a definition of psychological complexity, psychological balance, psychological harmony, or psychological imbalance or disharmony. Â\n\nThe Socialist Realists (after Stalin) quickly closed the tap on abstractions. The Union entered an era of state-controlled utilitarian art: optimistic, dynamic and stupid. During a Soviet Writers' Congress in 1934 Zhdanov called everything rotten in the capitalist system a \"state of Denmark\" (?), where representatives of the bourgeois literature are absorbed in pessimism, \"doubt in the morrow, eulogy of darkness, extolment of pessimism as the theory and practice of art.\" Badiou years later in his 2000 essay wrote that at its deepest, the \"avant-garde polemic\", which adopts the extreme stance of promoting everything previously considered ugly, is directed against the classical axiom that posits the existence of some forms that are more natural, more appropriate, more pleasing than others. Â\n\nAn anonymous critic fires back at everything Socialist Realism-adjacent in a 1959 French publication. Largely speculated to be Andrei Sinyavsky, the author gives his examples of what a truly purposeful activity is: \"I extend my hand to receive the coins, I go to a movie to spend time with a pretty girl, I write a novel to earn glory and the gratitude of posterity.\" It wasn't until the late 1960s, when 900km from Moscow a television factory began making new models that can broadcast reality in color, and Sinyavsky was forced to see what was promised by the bureaucrats of the planned economy. Suddenly, a razor blade \"Vostok\" has a value of 2 rubles. What the TV wasn't showing, and what Sinyavski was expecting to see, in color or not, was that old lady who cannot live without eating potatoes and who would bite an arm off or a leg for some delicious Coca Cola. Â\n\nSo with the above mentioned considered, the long story short: the struggle between the two has not arrived at a resolution a hundred years later, instead, it combined the worst parts of both realism and formalism into a gay and soft-spoken version of a folding table. A terrible imitation, three times removed from the ideal form of object in reality. The artist wrote to me (verbatim): I feel as I function as a foldable piece of furniture. Dual cultural identity â Iâm a table, but in Estonia I fold. Â\n\nWas this a subversion of supremacy of form, or its pragmatic exercise? The economics of a formalist artwork insist on having an internal coherence, a dynamism of parts that is strictly with reference to its own existence. That table doesn't have any of that; it reaches towards meaning but fails. Â\n\nThe folding feature is for the piece to be comfortably stored after the exhibition.\n\nGRETCHEN LAWRENCE (b. 1997 Tallinn EE) is an artist and musician based in London, UK.

Here, âcontinuumâ is perhaps slightly more than a metaphor: in 1983, the year of my birth, Hubert Damisch wrote an essay named La peinture est une vrai trois (Painting is a true Three) in which he developed an idea that the composition of Francois Rouan and a fundamental part of all painting could be theorized using the groups of (mathematical) group theory.Â He wouldnât have been able to know about the generalizations of groups created by infinity-groupoids until 2011 but if he had, he would have found ample motivation for a sort of âcomposition in the expanded fieldâ of âpaintingâ.Â\n\nThe tl;dr of the category-theoretic narrative is that the atomic unit by which one constructs any type of distinction is first a symmetry that names an invariant and, second, the comprehension of the first by an abstraction that makes the resulting triangle commute.Â\n\nThe generalization would have forced Damischâs theory of groups beyond pictorial terms as generally understood into the wilds of intrasubjective space; groupoids form an account of the logic of algebras and, if one has read Lacan on the Four Discourses, one would know that a discourse, with or without words, is defined by an algebra.Â\n\nToday there is no unified language of painting but there is something like a proper (in the sense of local, not in the sense of comprehensive) discourse of painting.Â Sometimes it is called, after Duchamp, the stupidity of the painter.Â It runs under and authorizes the dominant discourse (which I will simply call âmonetizable reificationâ) and is composed of algebras.Â Â\n\nIt is also worth noting that for a psychoanalyst, one only ever composes one thing:Â (very important) parts.\n\nSo, with the forgoing notes inscribed, Iâll give a few coordinates:\n\n- The tryptic came about by lifting Schoenbergâs diatonic modulation theory into the domain of color and pinning it to a lattice.Â Â\n\n- The images are renderings of the ephemera generated in the drawing process that are pasted onto\n\ngeometry and dropped in a physics simulator: Theyâre simulated modernist scatter works.Â\n\n- The other pieces are abstractions.Â\n\nTim Pierson\n\nDecember 4, 2022\n\nDoes Laszlo scream at the woman who irons his shirts? Who has inflicted a brown burn on his yellow shirt purchased expensively from Yves St. Laurent? A great brown burn just over the heart?\n\nDoes Laszloâs friend Robert make conversation with Laszlo, as they wait for the light to change, in the dull gray Camry? With the other friend, who is driving? What is the tone? Does Robert comment on the young women who flock along the boulevard? On the young men? On the traffic? Has Laszlo ever enjoyed a serious political discussion with Robert?\n\nWill Laszlo be relieved, today, in time to see the film he has in mind? If Laszlo is relieved in time to see the film, will there be a queue for tickets? Will there be students in the queue?\n\nIs Robert frightened by black spray paint, tall letters ghostly at the edges, on this wall, on this wall? At what level of education did Robert leave school?\n\nDoes Laszlo gauge the importance of his friend Robert in terms of the number of art friends he requires? Should there not be other cars leading and following Robertâs car, also filled with art friends? Does Laszlo, at times, feel himself part of an ocean of art friends? Is he exalted at these times? Does he wish for even more art friends, possibly flanking cars to the right and left and a point car far, far ahead?\n\nAfter leaving school, in what sort of enterprises did Laszlo engage before accepting his present post? Has he ever been in jail? For what sort of offense? Has Laszlo acquired a fondness for Robert? Is there mutual respect? Is there mutual contempt? When Robert takes tea, is Laszlo offered tea? Beer? Who pays?\n\nCan Laszlo and Robert adduce instances of professional success?\n\nHow much does pleasing matter? What services do Laszlo and Robert provide for their community other than the primary one? Are there services they should not be asked to perform? Are they nevertheless asked from time to time to perform such services? Do they refuse? Can they refuse? On what occasions?\n\nIn the restaurant, a good table for Robert and the distinguished gray man with whom he is conferring. Before it (between the table with the stranger and the door), a table for the four art friends. What is the quality of the conversation between the two sets of friends? Has Laszlo noted the difference in quality between his suit and that of his friend Robert? Between his shoes and those of Robert?\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nLiz Deschenes\n\nEmanuel Rossetti\n\nRichard Sides\n\nSeptember 30 - October 2, 2022\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nWhen deranged men on the street stop you to talk about Jesus, you donât care because you already know. Everyone knows.\n\nHandcrafted three ringed binders, framed works with automobile tint showing bloodstained screens from FPS games. We all know, and what I mean by âwe all knowâ is that we understand the variables that these renderings come from. The strength of so many aspects of this show are incident, following these variables as they appear, realizations via happenstance. There are also variables that cause many to see ghosts, fairies or angels, this we also all know.\n\nA painting found on Essex street one week ago was the last sighting we had of an angel. A slashed up painting of golden and silver stripes, covered in animal hair and dirt, a crossed out signature, a plastic shopping bag. We were approached by several homeless men who thought we were taking the found work to a dumpster, they felt that the work belonged in a museum and not on the street. After leaving this work in a stairwell for 30 minutes, with the intention of holding onto and showing it as part of this show, the work had disappeared. The angel had spent that afternoon passing through so many peoples lives, the facsimile of this work is a tracing of that.\n\nJoshua Boulos\n\nThere is a tendency in some new contemporary art that the work must do something, and if so then the tendency here is to eschew that. In doing so, the work asks the viewer to look in that way too, to eschew the point in viewing and to let that be enough to enjoy the works on display. Drawing is a traditional form of art making. If art has been defined as a tendency to eschew its own purpose in order to become whole within itself (the field workerâs shoes), then must that tendency to eschew also be eschewed? Thus, the return to drawing. But through this process of losing and then finding itself again, the medium has taken on the patina of time (the shoe again), damaged and waterloggedâ is this enough, though? To take what was sacred and debase it to the point of re-igniting its transcendental quality? And dare we learn something along the way? Benjamin answers with yet another refusal, the refusal to answer or even acknowledge the question, sidestepping the mistake of countless well-intentioned artists before him. The drawings balance on a tight rope, pulled at a distance between the points of âbeingâ and âself.â Ben Scott doesnât give a fuck. Ben Scott just wants to have a good time.

Ben Rocks.\n\n\"Ne Krokodilu!â goes the Esperanto idiom; literally: âdonât crocodile!â It means not to speak oneâs native tongue when one should be speaking Esperanto, or, more simply translated: âSpeak Esperanto!â There are many explanations for the origin of this phraseâ some say it stems from the idea of âcrocodile tears,â that is, a false sympathy, others claim it came from the educational puppet shows put on by early teachers of Esperanto, during which the character who spoke only in its native language would be portrayed by a crocodile puppet, or from Esperanto classes in which participants were only allowed to speak their native languages when holding wooden crocodile toys, still others say it refers to the use of non-Esperanto languages in Esperanto-speaking circles as being unfeeling or socially uncouth, like the behavior of a cold-blooded reptile. No one can pinpoint exactly when it became undesirable, in Esperanto, to be a crocodile. Regardless, it has become a social custom.\n\nThe joke, of course (or the tragedy, depending on your feelings towards Esperanto), is that there are precious few times when it would be more appropriate to speak Esperanto than nearly any other language. Esperanto is the worldâs most widely spoken âconstructed language,â that is, a language that, rather than emerging organically over time, was invented by one man (an L.L Zamenhof, or âDr. Esperantoâ to his followers), with a specific goal in mind: to create a universal, perfect language. Despite this, it is today a language actually spoken by very few: the most generous of estimates place the number of Esperanto speakers at less than two million. Still, those who do speak Esperanto do so passionately. They comprise a small, self-selecting group of like-minded individuals. When you speak Esperanto, you know that anyone who can speak back shares a certain set of ideals. People who would believe their passion transcends borders, languages, ideological differences, despite all evidence to the contrary. And yet, if the idiom of the crocodile is any indication, even within the most insular of groups there is always some latitude for interpretation.\n\nIn painting, no one is the âcrocodileâ; no one is really speaking the wrong language. It is ambitious to paint with the intention that everyone will understand just what it is you are painting, just as it is ambitious, even naive, to believe in a world united by a common tongue. The paintings in this exhibition were not selected because of their shared thematic content, nor were they chosen because they might speak the same visual language. Each work is able to converse not due to their formal similarity, but merely because of the ambition of the artists, who believe, much like Esperantists, in an ongoing, sometimes lateral, progression of a timeless system. Marc Matchak paints the protagonists of a Young Adult novel series, annonymizing these characters with a shifting sense of style, texture and pattern. The gray bed cover that comprises two-thirds of the frame further complicates our attempts to situate the figures between memory and their original context. Emma Battleburyâs despondent fairy is a fantastical creature with an impressively modern sense of angst. Wings drooping, head bowed, the fairy takes a phone call with a sense of gravity antithetical to her whimsical nature. Timelessness is also abundant in Georgia Gray Gardnerâs vividly rendered oil paintings. A woman with eyes closed as if in veneration is haloed like saints in medieval paintings; on her neck, she wears a 90âs-style tattoo choker. Chemtrails and scarlett clouds of smoke in the background mark something foreboding in this collision of the contemporary with the divine.\n\nTo many, the ideals of Esperanto and its speakers are cause for scorn. And yes, there is a danger to looking in either direction, past or future, through rose-colored glasses. Universality has fallen out of vogue. It might even be viewed as insidious. At best, itâs a dream from the past, not a way of looking towards the future. Today, we try our best to love each otherâs differences, to let what separates us become what unites us. But isnât that a form of universalism, too?\n\nWhen we talk about art with one another, even our disagreements are predicated on a certain mutual understanding, that we care enough in the first place to parse out the details of why this image makes us feel or think one thing or another. And so in a way, when we look at images, which do not speak any one language and are, in at least this sense, universal, we are all speaking Esperanto, which is to say: we are doing something absurd, together, which we all feel is therefore very worth doing.\n\nÂ â Violet Saxon\n\nThe hybrid (of nature-culture) was advocated by Bruno Latour in We Have Never Been Modern, claiming that such a dualism never existed and that people and social agents should not study specialized totems of nature or culture respectively, but rather everything (politics, science, opinion, discourse, art, popular discourse and specialist discourse) has been mixed together. It is no longer tenable to accept the modern, post-modern or anti-modern positions. This exhibition is a melange/bricolage of varying discourses/artifacts that attempts to pluralize meaning and break any distinction between high and low, commodity and pure art, comic and tragic, nature and culture, dispersion/distribution and central authority, central banking and crypto, content and form, style and originality, codified systems and subjective singularity.\n\nâEric Schmid\n\nThe term poi dog is Pidgin-English colloquial for a specific mutt that would be fed taro until it was fat enough to be eaten. Poi dog is also a term for a mixed breed dog, or a mixed race human.\n\nâJoshua Boulos\n\nJanuary 30 - February 19, 2021\n\nâJust like the desert that is one and the same and precisely because of its homogeneity we donât have access to its landscape, the monism of nature does not allow us to know nature without organizing an epistemic breakage. Ontologically, nature does not distinguish itself from itself. Monism is in this sense an ontological reality that demands a necessary epistemic strategy: Exactly because of this excess of informational homogeneityâa desert that is one and the same everywhereâwe canât immediately approach nature or navigate it. The nature-culture division is an epistemic division, not an ontological one. From the possibility of epistemic traction, this division is necessary and far from rigid. It provokes approaches to nature hitherto unimagined. To claim that everything is nature is at best an indulgence in the vulgarity of the obvious and at worst, a complete blindness to the epistemic conditions through which we are able to progressively make sense of nature.â (Reza Negarestani)\n\nThe de-ontologized metaphysics of transmodernity (see my prolegomenon) requires a mode of navigation which does not posit any apophantic (Iâm smarter than you/I used to listen to that band) amphibology between being and Being. Rocco Gangle has compared it to Jean-Luc Marionâs God without Being. The ontological pariah is he who authorizes himself in the theological-political authority that the King once did as both celestial and corporeal Godhead -- the community of believers and the body of the King. Such a pariah exhibits a systematic exclusivity of a modernist ideal (good taste, high brow, rights to being flippant, being passively authoritarian about culture, I heard that band first, mysticism) which undermines not only the subaltern and the Other, but is according to Negarestani, an âindulgence in the vulgarity of the obviousâ at best or a âcomplete blindness to epistemic conditionsâ at worst since the ontological becomes not political, but rather nature and culture become the ontological; nature is presupposed by the cultural, cultural superiority becomes a divine birthright of coronation: nature is approached as a world full of meanings and stories.\n\nMy prolegomenon hopefully begins a project divorced from the question of the ontological and diving straight into epistemology. Epistemology may be our only hope. 2 Person Show navigates a multiplicity of different mediums and conceptual premises. We are at least 5 generations after the conceptual legacies, with Conceptual Art, Postmodern Art, Neo-Conceptual art, and then 'Painting Beside Itself'. All of this is passÃ© but we still can gain traction with the tools and vocabularies they provided since it's history. This show hopefully presents a possibility for the Buchlohian tautological experience of the conceptual idea or its reinvigoration in the 90s (Christian Philipp Mueller, Andrea Fraser, Peter Fend, Mark Dion, Nils Norman)...BUT...now with the hindsight of the reactive responses of a tradition of materialist artists today basically following a parallel trajectory beginning with Martin BarrÃ© before Conceptual Art and culminating in a re-materialization of the art object after a big Turn in Conceptual Art with Broodthaers (Michael Krebber, Michael E Smith, Stephan Dillemuth, Emanuel Rossetti, David Flaugher, Heike-Karin Foell and even Christopher Williams arguably).\n\nâTrying to understand nature without an epistemic division, solely through the ontological monism, is an appeal to mysticism. It results either in an ineffable conception of nature or an image of nature as a reservoir of meanings and stories about itself. Once we insist that the world is a repository of meanings, that it has stories to tell the subject without any demand for the subject to create a necessary epistemic condition, then we have already committed to conserve a stable relation between the knowing subject and the world. The world is always facing the subject as if it wants to tell a story, there is no need for the subject to destabilize its given status, to epistemically uproot itself so as to procedurally navigate the landscape. The subject of the world as a ready-made object of experience and a reservoir of meanings is quite stubbornly an anthropocentric and conservative form of subject even though it claims to be completely the opposite.â (Reza Negarestani)\n\nGood taste is only invoked as an artifact of its distanciated self within the frame of mechanized picture with a distanciated border (taking after Christopher Williams; in this show, see the Etsy band t-shirts in white matted photo frames) or within the frame of a post-conceptual painting which suspends the impotency of the formalist truism through its distanciation of such rigidity, sterility and pristine (yet impotent) precision (taking after Heike Karin-Foell; in this show, see the paintings with collages of Fontana & Vienna around 1900 with Sharpie formalist marks). If we are stuck in a contemporary realm of âthe moveâ, the key may be to not only destabilize codification and trends, but also bear in mind the legacies which could be metaphysically deflated from the original context of their modernist/avant-garde/neo-avantgarde program/utopia. The blatant commercialization and industry behind the art world, where \"artists are no different these days from doctors or lawyers\" (as Antek Walczak said), is anthropomorphized here in a series of personal photographs, but only as a means to de-ontologize any personal politics of theological-politcal authority, as to expose oneself within the constraints of an elliptical autobiography (after Danh Vo). For the collaborative painting, I picked the fabric (thinking of Krebber or von Bonin) and Adam painted on it (thinking of the Viennese Aktionists). Then Adam made drawings which resemble fragments of drawings, which have denied a certain self-sufficiency of pictorial representation. Maybe if we remember the stories which the world is telling us, we can uproot ourselves and destabilize those meanings and stories and actually navigate epistemologically. Being hyper-aware of yourself, how you treat others, your intentions, your influences, your precedents, society, industry, and your psychology, but also science, the news, music, art, applied mathematics, cybernetics and varying epistemes without indulging in belief of some ostensibly objective Truth determining your subjecthood (i.e. being completely aloof--an asshole with a superiority complex really into 'Werner Schwab the Good'--or completely blind--a mystic, sell-out, or 'Lulu Lemon normie'). Maybe the 'axiomatic method' is our way out of shitty metaphysics.\n\nâEric Schmid\n\nJamie Lynn Klein January 6 - 29, 2021\n\nOne Moment Please\n\nNina Cristante\n\nKaspar MÃ¼ller\n\nDavid Ostrowski\n\nKarin Sander\n\nNovember 3 - 24, 2020\n\nIn a direct refutation of the bourgeois individualist liberties of solipsistic development of individuated criteria for aesthetic judgement, âOne Moment Pleaseâ problematizes the notions of craft and âgoodnessâ through a reflexive awareness of the conceptual legacies of Lucy Lippard (et al) and through the transmutation of such dematerialized performances of didactic language games ultimately arrive at the possibility of broad strokes of contemporaneity which de-ontologize todayâs naturalized post-cybernetic production of affect, hyper-circulation of codes, hybridized assemblages of market economy/democracy. The ossification of this nebulous condition demarcates the limits of receptivity and production, in a time when snobs of the neo-avant-garde have been outmoded by their mere recourse to apophantic meanings of ontologized faktums of an axiological registrar. For example, through the individualized aestheticism of âgood artâ in hipster coffeeshop bohemias. The refraction of this (global) condition onto itself creates an aesthetic registrar which is valuated not according to the hermeneutic circle of craft or originary onto-theological meaning (Heidegger), but rather a pragmatic rule-based emergentism, where âgoodnessâ or any authoritative invocations of âmystical accessâ is completely beside the point. This reduction of affect to a post-emotive relation between âknowerâ and âknowedâ problematizes the interiority of the classic subject of say St. Augustine and deracinates the epistemological framework for the assessment of supposed autonomous art. This movement away from technological enframement (Heidegger) toward the inhumanism of âeliminative materialismâ (Churchland), whereby the autopoetic dimension of art is its expression manifestly as/qua the underlying processes of âsocieties of controlâ (Deleuze). The desublimation of figuration, representation and craft (in the metaphysical sense of pictorial truth) is quietly ontologized by the material as its negatively defined enframement of aesthetic categories (see the mechanical reproduction of David Ostrowskiâs painting, through the negative device of mesh banner) to achieve the recursive constitution of the âbody/mindâ (or even âsoulâ), but only as a de-ontologized appropriation of neo-Platonic categories of consciousness (the âbody/containerâ, e.g. of canvas, of diptych/mesh banner, of mandala). But clearly, to the contemporary citizen, said hermetic poetry of pre-modern categories via modernist allegories is merely an unscientific parable a la Borges. âOne Moment Pleaseâ should instead be analyzed as a topological heuristic to manifestly express the local-global continuum by which access to a local singularity (Karin Sanderâs canvas, for example) can create a global phase shift (the networks, geography and logistical systems which are invoked through the shipment of the package-cum-painting). After the advancements of catastrophe theory in the 70s and more importantly, its twin sister chaos theory, the contemporary neuroscientific view was to view the subject as a sequence of âphase shiftsâ. This notion originated in topology with manifolds with regional discontinuities (catastrophe theory). The initial conditions of such a differential field/system has huge ramifications for the convergence or divergence of the attractor of a system. In the Luhmannian sense of a systems theory (of culture), which is reflexively recursive, the system achieves patterns through autopoiesis itself. For example, the synchronicities of street light systems within a city or non-Gaussian outliers such as black swans in the stock market. The initial conditions (time=0) of said original categories serve as a window into the fractal geometry of a simple Euclidean construct becoming complex-valued, such as a mere triangle (a pre-modern symbol) becoming reiterated onto itself into a Sierpinski triangle (the global epistemological landscape). Following Reza Negarestani, such conditions should not be confused with mere âontological monismâ, but rather the ânature-cultureâ dyad is an epistemic distinction.\n\nâEric Schmid\n\nNina Cristante NUM October 10 - 27, 2020\n\nWhichever payment that has been verbally agreed should be confirmed in written form in the contract to avoid any misunderstandings.

Iâm in the kitchen and have to cook. Thatâs my relation to it.â\n\n-Michael Krebber, âPainting Foreverâ\n\n(Interview with Isabelle Graw for Kaleidoscope Magazine)\n\nA text has no interior. This wasnât always the case: before the age of industry and capital was the age of hermetics; an object had meaning because it had authenticity, and it had authenticity because it had scarcity. All reproduction was an act of craftsmanship and sacrifice, a life for a life.\n\nThe artist in a world of stocks and flows of capital and data no longer wields the power to create irreplaceable progeny. A given artifact is but a husk adrift in an interminable sea of diagrams, viscous oceans of arrows connecting endless productions and reproductions alike, each object distinguishable to denizens of the network only to the extent that they inhabit different roles. Todayâs artist, no less an inhabitant, is always submerged in the medium, their signature found only within the inimitable waves they make with each connection they draw.\n\nAs a persona, the artist remains the same: they still rise, shine, shit, eat, fuck; because they must. Once possessed by gods and made the servomechanism of a cruel telos, the contemporary artisan is every bit as hands-on in their compulsive grasping at endlessly multiplying avenues of inference running between paintings, sculptures, galleries, exhibitions, reviews, calendar dates, websites, bits, bytes, cables, wire transfers, hedge funds, governments, arms deals, wars, green zones, and every other conceivable type of occupation. Their medium on the other hand has nonetheless changed: once tasked with excavating mimesis from a platonic solid, they now traverse surfaces in order to carve out new concavities amidst their collective topology.\n\nTo the untrained eye, such behavior looks like little more than a self-indulgent love affair with artifice, ornament, obfuscation, irony, and kitsch, when the truth is that this prolonged neoteny exists on account of an intransigent devotion to their craft that takes their medium too seriously to allow themselves to be ossified by fairy-tales and platitudes about content and identity. They are dandies, flaneurs, idiots who give their full involvement to the idiosyncrasies of each brushstroke and their full attention to the distinct context of each viewing as a way of relentlessly hacking new escape routes from a constant encroachment of cybernetic reification. These distanciated inductions of haecceity are by no means haphazard but rather actions carried out through a matrix of scrupulously considered decisions that directly refutes the impotence of figurative painting a la Baselitz/Lupertz, the senescence of idea/systems art a la Tomas Schmit, or any other such reproductions of chimeric pretenses.\n\nWithout painstakingly cultivated skill, oneâs actions, no matter how superficially rebellious, remain mere permutations of an operationalized system of identity, marked-to-market catharsis dressed in the manufactured garb of rebellion. Thus the Fluxus movement, though prescient in their professed emphasis of process over product, was looked upon with contempt by Dieter Roth for their inability to master any matter at hand enough to exceed extant syntax. Positing that one comes up with a ânovelâ idea independent of some supposedly subsequent act of craftsmanship puts the cart before the horse; any truly unique concept is inextricable from some corresponding practice, conceived only to the extent that, when the time comes, one actually gets in the kitchen and cooks.\n\nâAlexander Boland\n\nFlyer by Ben Schumacher\n\nK.O Nnamdie\n\nBonnie Lovina August 1 - 31, 2020\n\nBryant Canelo Bryant & His Stuff June 15 - July 4, 2020\n\nValentino Gojcaj March 12 - April 2, 2020\n\nIn Lieu of a Press Release: COVID-19 Update\n\nThereâs a character named Selena in the 2003 film 28 Days Later. Her monologue begins as such: âIt started as rioting. But right from the beginning you knew this was different. Because it was happening in small villages, market towns. And then it wasn't on the TV any more. It was in the street outside. It was coming in through your windows. It was a virus.â The virus spreads in such a banal manner at first that you donât even realize the apocalypse is here, or near. Messianic visions of grandeur and delusional Mayan predictions that the world will erupt in flames all of a sudden have never proved reliable. Indeed, itâs the slow-burning, zombified virus that spreads with a nefariously languor.\n\nValentino Gojcajâs show at Triest coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic. Coincidence? Probably, but thereâs no way to be sure. Who is Tino Gojcaj and what is his artwork? I donât know, because Iâm self-quarantined and I imagine he is too. Gojcajâs show, however, happens to work on your iPhoneâa QR code will lead you there, bringing you first to a private Instagram page with no profile picture or bio or name.\n\nThereâs a certain beauty to the sincerity of Valentinoâs paintings at Triest. Thereâs a three-quarters-finished painting of the Hollywood sign in the Hills, perched over LA, but in the painting we see a small gold star at the bottom of the hill. Thereâs a painting of the QR code, in a stained-rag color that brings the digital to the physical and back to the digital again. There isâwhat looks to beâa banana in a purse going through security at an airport. The bag is being scanned by a desperately exhausted TSA agent. The banana is a gun, but itâs also a piece of sweet fruit. Gojcaj is working here in colloquial, contemporary imagery, instantly recognizable artifacts. A code, a sign, a security screen. Hollywood, airports, iPhones. Thereâs no distinct narrative, but there is a digital string or USB-C cable connecting each painting to the last. The palette is softâthe mood is friendly and unassuming. The space is America, and the subject is likely America, too.\n\nThere is no COVID to be seen in Gojcajâs paintings. But that is precisely why it is possible that it is there. In the bag, in the hills or in the oils. There is only one way to be sure you will avoid the virus: scan the QR code and browse Gojcajâs work from the safety of your home.\n\nâMarcus Mamourian\n\nValentino Gojcajâs most recent project consists of a nameless collective, a QR code as the face of a brandâ fashion and software intertwined. The exhibition also features five paintings.\n\nAndy Heck Boyd & Bryant Canelo February 7 â March 5, 2020\n\nThe neo-Victorian âphilosophy of brickâ was a plan to return to the humble domestic constructions of the Victorian era in rejection of the concrete-obsessed modernists of the 1950s. Brick houses are humble beginnings for humble people. They are safe and solid. But bricks are not always for solid foundations or structural integrity. Bricks rupture houses and create a path for chaos in the form of walls, graffiti, algae.\n\nBryant Canelo and Andy Heck Boydâs exhibition at Triest is about bricks and their liberation from meaning. Boydâs series of brick wall paintings creates a world where bricks and other industrial materials play with animated characters, cars, toys and colors. The world moves from wall to floor to chair to table: Caneloâs clumps of Spanish moss cover the wooden floor and a large piece of leather is draped across a table and chair in a manner that begs to be painted. A canvas laying in the middle of the room which reads âyour [sic] so brokenâ begs to be treaded upon. The exhibition as a small map-less habitat.\n\nThe paintings are direct, sincere, simplistic, and simultaneously ironic, taunting. Rapidly alternating between extreme minimalism (a few brush strokes of red on a small canvas) and material-maximalism (thick layers of oils, tape, various other unknown materials), the paintings display the variety of approaches to constructing the Boyd-Canelo toy-universe (cartoonoverse). The cartoonoverse, whose characters include Mickey Mouse and a middle-aged Glenn Gould, is open â like the bricks that make up its wall and the oil paint that fills its center, this world dries over an extended period of time after the artists have left.\n\nBeing an open system, thereâs a certain amount of chaos that is allowed to flow through the paintings and assault the viewer. Simple representation or extractable meaning proves elusive â MESSAGE: (no message), a white canvas tuned nearly grey from the heavy confluence of various materials with âMESSAGEâ written atop in black, avoids any hint at attempting to expand on truisms, which is why I donât feel the need to destroy it.\n\nBricks and toys have become objects of particular fascination recently in academic philosophy with regards to thinking through AI, cybernetics and games. It turns out LEGOs (bricks) are more representative of the world than the world is of itself. There is nothing Carl Andre about these bricks, because they do not seek to bore, but rather to open up a world of cartoons and games. Glenn Gould will play his red antique piano, mickey gets up from his chair and reads from a book, Lou Reed drives a black Ferrari into a brick wall. Fun will be had and no meaning will be found.\n\nâMarcus Mamourian\n\nJamie Lynn Klein December 8 - January 2, 2020"
