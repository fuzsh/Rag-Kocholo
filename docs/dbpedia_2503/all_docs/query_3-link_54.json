        "text": "When I came up with the idea to interview people who are pursuing their dreams I made a list of 10 people who I wanted to highlight. Most I know personally, others not so much but I admire their pursuits. Over the years I‚Äôve come to accept the term ‚ÄúNO‚Äù more but we can never be in total agreement. To my surprise everyone who was on that list has said yes, and I‚Äôm beyond overjoyed. I was particularly surprised and elated when Plus Size Model Nina Taylor accepted my invitation. As human beings we sometimes place people on a higher standard because of what we see. I just ‚Äúknew‚Äù she would be too busy to interview with me but not only was she willing to interview she was a real sweetheart about it. I admire the work and the movement that Ms. Nina represents and I am very grateful that she took the time out to share her views. Nina Taylor is not just a pretty face whom photographs well; she is smart, humble, and surprisingly witty. Let‚Äôs get to know more about ‚ÄúThe Face‚Äù of Full-Figured Fashion Week 2011.\n\nQ: Name, Age, Birthplace/Current location?\n\nNina: -Nina Taylor, 27, Washington DC\n\nQ: As a child what were some of your aspirations.\n\nNina: ‚Äì As a child I wanted to be a lawyer, surgeon, I wanted to be on ‚ÄúAll my Children‚Äù I wanted to be a dancer, singer, a chef and I wanted to have a bigger house than my Barbie.\n\nQ: How did you get into modeling?\n\nNina: ‚Äì I was working as a makeup artist and a photographer needed to test lights, so he asked me on set. Shot 10 frames of me and told me I belong in front of the camera not behind it. He saw something in me that I didn‚Äôt even know existed.\n\nQ: How would you describe your style?\n\nNina: ‚Äì An Urban Stepford Wife, Classy, comfortable\n\nQ: 3 words to describe you.\n\nNina: ‚Äì intelligent, glamorous, confident\n\nQ: What inspires you?\n\nNina: ‚Äì Seeing how far I‚Äôve come and how much farther I have to go\n\nQ: What does it feel like going for a shoot? What emotion describes it?\n\nNina: -I love going to shoots, its all about you, you can be whoever you want to be for the day. It‚Äôs like a grown up version of playing dressing up. I feel most alive when I am in front of a camera.\n\nQ: The plus size industry has made great strides but some feel like it still has a long way to go as far as media attention and respect from straight fashion designers. Are you satisfied with the direction of the plus-size fashion industry?\n\nNina: -I am proud of the progress that has been made, and even more excited that I am a part of this movement. I am not satisfied until I can walk into any store and buy clothes in my size, and see more people that look like me and that represent a vast majority of women on TV and in magazines.\n\nQ: Do you think its pressure being a plus size model? Knowing that you are the representation for so many women in the country.\n\nNina: ‚Äì It‚Äôs a lot of pressure, there‚Äôs competition within the plus size industry because so many girls want that opportunity to be on top. Outside of the industry is the pressure from the public to be a representation of them. To show that plus size women are beautiful, confident and happy.\n\nQ: Who are some of the people in the industry that you admire? Or would like to work with?\n\nNina: -I admire so many people Gwen DeVoe is such a visionary and creates amazing opportunities for plus women, I love Shanda Freeman, she is so inspiring and grounded and an amazing friend. Jovanna Reyes of Curvysta is an amazing and talented woman, she has been so much fun to work with. I am also looking forward to working with Marina Zelner of the Queen Grace Collection soon.\n\nQ: My main inspiration within the Plus Size industry is the late, great Plus Model Mia Amber. She has definitely made an impact in my life as a role model and inspiration as well as to many others. What did she mean to you?\n\nNina: -Mia was just an overall kind person. She just had positivity around her. She was the total package. Brains, beauty, and generosity. When I first started in the industry I reached out to her, and she kept me motivated and gave me some great pointers as I was starting out. There is definitely a void in the plus industry and she is so missed. She believed in the power of the plus community and was not only a great representation but also a fantastic spokeswoman.\n\nQ: What keeps you motivated? Do you have a favorite quote/song lyric/proverb/word of advice that keeps you motivated?\n\nNina: ‚Äì ‚ÄúBe your number 1 fan‚Äù you have to like you and like the direction you are moving it. If you are your biggest cheerleader, you‚Äôll never disappoint yourself.\n\nQ: What advice do you have for anyone that wants to follow their dreams but may be scared or don‚Äôt know exactly where to start?\n\nNina: ‚Äì every dream starts will preparation, do your research and identify what your passion is, plan what you will do to make that dream come true and then move toward it with conviction. Let no one stand in your way.\n\nQ: What qualities do you think a person should possess to make their dream a reality?\n\nNina: -Belief in yourself and being proactive in your pursuit of your dream.\n\nQ: Other than modeling, what other things can people expect from Ms. Nina?\n\nNina: -A lot of speaking engagements, some TV, building and launching a new organization soon within the plus community, writing for various blogs and magazines and a continued growth professionally and personally.\n\nQ: Where would you like to be in your career within 5 years?\n\nNina: -I‚Äôd like to take my humanitarian work on a broader level, expanding my businesses, continue modeling professionally, and hopefully back in school working on my PhD.\n\nQ: How do you handle negativity in your life?\n\nNina: -You are responsible for the energy in your life.. if you give negativity power over your life then it will breed miserable times. Acknowledge it, then move on.\n\nQ: Great advice üôÇ I‚Äôll throw a couple words out..you give your definition or viewpoint\n\n‚Ä¢ Beauty ‚Äì\n\nNina: so much more than what you see on your exterior.\n\n‚Ä¢ Confidence ‚Äì\n\nNina: Starts with self awareness and self acceptance.\n\n‚Ä¢ Love ‚Äì\n\nNina: Is all around you but it starts with YOU.\n\n‚Ä¢ Goals ‚Äì\n\nNina: Are meaningless if you don‚Äôt move towards them.\n\n‚Ä¢ Life ‚Äì\n\nNina: is easy, it‚Äôs living that is hard.\n\nQ: If you were on a desert island, what 3 things would you have to have with you?\n\nNina: ‚ÄìIpod, endless supply of red velvet cupcakes, my blackberry so I can call someone to tell them to get me off of this island.\n\nQ: {Ahh, I love red velvet also..yum LOL.} What do you have to say to the young lady who may be reading this and she feels she‚Äôs unpretty and unworthy of letting her true light shine.\n\nNina: -I would tell her to take her favorite color lipstick and write on her mirror ‚ÄúI WILL be Beautiful Today‚Äù and then do something every day that makes her feel special. There is no one else in the world that is you. Everyone has a light and it‚Äôs up to you to let it shine.\n\nQ: When it‚Äôs all said and done, how do you want to be remembered?\n\nNina: -That I hustled to make my dreams come true. That I took time out to be supportive of others and that I am actually pretty funny üôÇ"
