Milescross Barbarella, SC)\n\nDOB 4/30/2006 - 9/2018\n\nBreeder: Guin Borstel\n\nOwner: Jan Ross\n\nNina was the smallest and most tenacious of Pie and Bryce's puppies, Her puppy name was Chalupa, as in \"Drop the Chalupa\", from her resemblance to the Taco Bell Chihuahua. She was a favorite in the litter, both for her cuteness and a personality that was much bigger than she was. As she matured it became obvious that she needed a very special home, one who could direct her energy and super smarts into a positive direction. Thankfully, Jan came along and Nina got the home she needed. Nina enjoyed a fulfilling life on the Lost Coast in Arcata, with Jan, her owner and trainer."
