        "text": "From https://www.electricalaudio.com/ photo taken by Joshua Ford Photography\n\n1. Can you tell us about your journey and how you got started in the music industry?\n\nSteve: I have played in bands of one kind or another since about 1978. I moved from Missoula Montana to Chicago in 1980 to go to college at Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism. While in Chicago I became embedded in the underground/punk music scene and have habituated myself there ever since. The punk scene was DIY at its core, so when my band wanted to make a demo recording, I was the guy who did it. Same with the next band I was in, and the one after that. Eventually I started doing recordings of my friends’ bands, then their friends, and before long I had a part-time job as a freelance recording engineer. As that took up more and more of my time, I was eventually able to quit my straight job and open a small studio and finally a big one, Electrical Audio, where I am sitting now, typing these answers.\n\n2. What upcoming projects are you currently working on?\n\nSteve: I make records every day, forgive me for not wanting to single out any one of my clients. As for my own band Shellac, we have had a new album finished for more than a year now, it’s been a long difficult process to get it pressed, printed etc. We’re using some new processes and they are proving troublesome in the details and there is a generally overwhelmed pressing industry at the moment, everywhere is running at capacity and as a result quality control is slipping, so in addition to staging and queue delays there are delays getting problems with pressings resolved. It sucks and it’s taking forever but we have an new album in the pipeline.\n\n3. Can you share some insights into your work with Shellac and Big Black? How do these bands differ in terms of creative process and sound?\n\nSteve: Big Black was a reaction against the traditional sound and form of a rock band, a negation of tradition and rejection of orthodoxy. The use of a drum machine was deliberate, though I didn’t really have anything against drummers, I just didn’t want the band to be of the same type as the rock music we rejected whole. Almost everything about my mindset then was oppositional, meaning I saw things, trends in music and culture that seemed frivolous, conformist or lazy and I did things that were in contrast or opposition to them. Bands sculpted their sound to be liked, to fit in, while we reveled in being outsiders, better than that.\n\nIn Shellac, there is no central conceit, no singular framing. We have committed to some ideas, among them being a minimalist three-piece rock band, using collaborative songwriting and decision making, conscientious, responsible behavior with our touring, shows and business dealings, informality of structure and rejection of active promotion or publicity. We started the band as an experiment and we’re still conducting it. We have no goals and make few plans. It has been the most rewarding musical experience of my life playing in Shellac and lack of ambition is certainly part of the reason for that.\n\n4. Are there any particular collaborations or artists you’ve worked with that have had a significant impact on you?\n\nSteve: Geez yeah. I’ve made lifelong friends through the happenstance of working on their records. I did 11 records for the band Silkworm and the surviving members and their families have been among my closest friends for decades. I’ve done a bunch of records with Kim and Kelley Deal from the Breeders and singer/songwriters like Nina Nastasia, Robbie Fulks, Ty Segall and Will Oldham, and we’ve all become close friends and they are like family to my wife Heather and me.\n\nI did a record with John Grabsky under the name Teeth that was profound in my life. John was terminally ill with cancer but he summoned the strength to make an album about his relationship with the disease, and it’s both a great album and a great example of confronting mortality, even up to imminent death without being consumed by resentment. I admired John and working on that album changed a lot of my ideas about death, productivity, the animating/sustaining effect of creation.\n\n5. Who are some of your biggest influences as a musician and producer?\n\nSteve: As a musician, there’s a long list but… Neil Young, Wilco Johnson, Nina Nastasia, Keith Levine, John Cale, Lou Reed, Billy Gibbons, Mark E Smith, Willie Nelson, Shannon Wright, the Ex, James Chance, Suicide, Kraftwerk, Third World War, the Stooges, AC/DC, Conlon Nancarrow, the Effigies, Naked Raygun, Sonic Youth, Low…\n\nAs an engineer I’ve often admired the mindset of Al Schmitt, a veteran of the LA recording scene who was at it every day until he died at 90. He didn’t attach particular importance to one kind of session or another, one style of music or another, he just showed up and did his best for whatever was on the schedule. He worked on a shit-million records of all kinds, some good, some terrible, but that part wasn’t of interest to him, the music wasn’t his department. He just wanted to make sure that whatever you were playing, everything came out clear as a bell. I admire that kind of work ethic, non-judgmental approach and consistent quality, and I strive to emulate it.\n\nMuch of what I learned about making records was from two early mentors of mine, Iain Burgess and John Loder. John ran Southern Studios in London from the late 70s until he died in 2005, and he made exceptional punk records on a shoestring. I learned a ton from him about making do with modest equipment and being rigorous and thorough in practice in the studio.\n\nIain was a sympathetic engineer for all the punk bands in Chicago during the 1980s, and he taught me the more human side of recording, in that he made everyone in the session comfortable and made the bands feel like he was going to make their record the best thing he’d ever done. I don’t have that kind of bedside manner, but his willingness to try whatever the band wanted to do, no matter how crazy, has become a part of my recording philosophy and a guiding principle.\n\n6. What are your thoughts on the current state of the music industry?\n\nSteve: That’s… an absurdly broad question. Anyway…\n\nStreaming is a dead-end, it’s doomed to disappear because it depends on things being unavailable except on a proprietary platform, and if the internet has taught us anything it’s that there’s no way to hide things. I’m of the opinion that streaming services will be replaced by something autonomous that scours the entire internet looking for things of interest to you and plays them for you. This could take many forms, a dedicated app or a function on a search engine, and conceptually it’s so simple it only needs cheap enough computing power and bandwidth to render the idea of a walled garden moot.\n\nPhysical records remain the format of choice for people who want to build a permanent collection of music and this delights me as I enjoy listening to records and they represent a major part of my experience with music.\n\n7. Are there any bands or artists currently out there that have impressed you with their sound? Any genre-defining bands that could be synonymous when you think punk, rock, etc?\n\nSteve: I don’t think this sort of thing has a temporal boundary, but have worked with some people and bands who are singular, meaning there’s nobody else who does precisely what they do, or achieves the complete effect of their music to that degree. In that category I would put Nina Nastasia, Kim Deal, Ty Segall, Neurosis, Nirvana, the Jesus Lizard, Man or Astro-Man, Cheap Trick, Robbie Fulks, Silkworm…\n\n8. What role did your involvement with Nirvana play in your career, and how did that experience influence your work moving forward?\n\nSteve: In 1993, they were one of the fifty or so bands whose records I worked on that year. In the years since, their reputation and significance has grown and endured, and being associated with one of their records is often the only thing some people in music know about me. I had a great experience making that record, became friends with the band and grew to admire them. The “political” surroundings of the era, the way their label and management and the rest of the professional class treated them is shameful and I resent those people and harbor animus toward them, but the band and I are cool and I think the record speaks for itself.\n\nThe behavior of that professional class I described fit perfectly with my understanding of those people at the time, I even predicted some of it, and I am grateful that those people and that class of office have all either disappeared or been relegated to insignificance. I haven’t had any interaction with a major label administration person in years and I can’t imagine circumstances where I will have to.\n\n9. What advice would you give to aspiring musicians or producers who are just starting out?\n\nSteve: Keep control of your career to the extent you can. Book your own shows, make your own records and merchandise, do your own accounting and manage your own affairs. Be fair with other people and demand fairness from the people you work with. Don’t sign anything. If there’s a simple rule of thumb to remember, it’s this: Whenever someone wants to take over some of your work load for a percentage, that person is being overpaid.\n\n10. How do you approach capturing the energy and rawness of a live performance in the studio?\n\nSteve: I have adapted my studio techniques to the expectation that bands will set-up and perform live, essentially as they do in the rehearsal or on stage, with the idea of preserving the organic qualities of a band in performance. Many engineers do not, and instead they isolate members and overdub parts one at a time, deconstructing the performance and making that kind of real-time interaction impossible. By simply not doing that, I get a bunch of benefits of the type you’ve asked about.\n\n11.What do you think makes a great song or album, from both a musical and production standpoint?\n\nSteve: A great song animates the idea, intent and personality of the performer in your mind on listening. Some people ascribe significance to certain notes, chords and melody, but for me the song doesn’t exist until performed, so the academic structure of a song, the parts you can write down, are much less important to me than the effect of the song when played, and that being good or bad is down to the performer. There are some people who can sing a laundry list and it grips you, some people have a team of experts write something that all such experts would agree is a good song, and when they sing it, there’s nothing there for the listener.\n\nI don’t put a lot of stock in the idea of a song in the abstract, separated from its performance. In most cases it is primarily a legal construction in service of the idea of intellectual property, a basis for collecting money, and I consider that effort and that idea corrupting and ridiculous.\n\nFrom an engineering standpoint, a good starting point is the organic natural sound of the music as played. I strive to have naturalistic sound as a starting point, the sound of the thing being recorded rather than an idealized sound abstracted from reality. That isn’t always what a band is looking for, but it’s the best place to start. If you like the sound of your guitar or drum kit or voice, and I can make it sound like that in somebody’s living room, then that’s goes a long way toward the whole record being a satisfying listen.\n\nAs a listener, the best records for me are the ones where I forget about everything and have a kind of communion with the band, like I was hanging out with them. The best records make you feel like you understand something more about the people who made it than you did before, and you understand their ideas and inspirations. They communicate something of substance to you.\n\n12. How do you handle creative differences or conflicts when working with artists in the studio?\n\nSteve: I step out of the room and let them talk it over in private.\n\n13. Can you discuss the importance of maintaining artistic integrity in the music industry?\n\nSteve: Integrity means keeping your ideas intact and not vulnerable to corruption. If your idea is to make a lot of money or accrue status, then things like what kind of music you make, what you sing about, how you treat other people… all those things are up for grabs in service of your central ideas, making a lot of money and pursuing status. That is an example of maintaining artistic integrity, because the art is not particularly important to the ideas that remained intact.\n\nIf your ideas are purely artistic ones, and you don’t want to compromise them for the sake of money or status, then it is critical not to have your life hanging in the balance of the commercial success of your ideas. If you depend on music for your livelihood, then one way or another that will put pressure on you to do things for the sake of money. Examples would be playing shows you don’t want to play, letting commercial projects license your music, changing your musical style or aesthetics to suit current trends, hiring or collaborating with people who have professional or cultural cachet, using aggressive, gimicky marketing or promotion.\n\nThe best way to avoid having to do any of those things is to make your livelihood elsewhere, or have multiple income streams and resources that insulate your artistic decisions from the stability of making a living. If your records don’t sell, you have touring and merchandise to fall back on. If you can’t tour, you can give instrument lessons or hire on as temp or start an OnlyFans account or whatever. Just don’t put all your eggs in one basket\n\n14. How do you stay inspired and motivated creatively after being in the industry for so many years?\n\nSteve: My essential relationship with music is that I am a fan of it. Everything else has grown out of that, and despite being battered with music all day every day, I still find things that surprise and delight me, and I still want to play guitar in a band.\n\n15. Are there any specific genres or styles of music that you haven’t worked with yet but would like to explore in the future?\n\nSteve: I work on whatever comes through the door, so I’ve been very lucky in that I see many different styles and idioms of music organically. I haven’t worked on as many doom/stoner rock records as I would like, I find myself listening to a lot of that music in my spare time and I think my methods would suit it. I’d love to record a gamelan ensemble someday."
