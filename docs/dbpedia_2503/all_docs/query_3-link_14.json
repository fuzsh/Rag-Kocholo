        "text": "At three in the morning…I crawled up the stairs and climbed into Nina’s bed with all my clothes on. She was bundled up in the other room. I heard a mouse poking his nose around her drawings. I struck a match and noticed little deposits of rat turds on the bed. The pillow crawled. I started to scratch myself. From the next room I heard the moan of a woman who finds a man too heavy, too pleasurable, or herself delighted. Nina had a man in bed. The bed squeaked. She kept up a running line of chatter. More moans. I decided to leave.\n\nIt hadn’t always been like this. Oh Nina had always been careless about hygiene, and was certainly never one to decline a drink or a handsome stranger, but there was a time when she was not to be pitied but envied.\n\nBorn in the Welsh seaside town of Tenby in 1890 (like fellow bohemian Augustus John), Nina Hamnett — at least in the first half of her life — had the gift for being in the right place at the right time. She first travelled to Paris in 1912 and spent much of the following two decades between there and London, working as both an artist and a model and meeting more or less the entire artistic avant-garde of both cities. She was vivacious, high-spirited, up for anything; a typical evening might find her singing off-colour sea shanties to a delighted André Gide, or dancing naked on a table in a Montparnasse bar long after closing time for an audience including Brancusi and Modigliani.\n\nThis first half of Hamnett’s life was lived at such a pace, and with such hunger for novelty and passion and adventure and laughter…and then suddenly seemed to stop dead. By the late 1940s she was living in squalor and penury, much of her time spent in the pubs of London’s Fitzrovia, exchanging anecdotes of her glory years for drinks. And when she talked about her pre-war exploits she wasn’t necessarily referring to the most recent war.\n\nAfter the last round she would stumble home to her filthy bedsit, not infrequently accompanied by a fleeting acquaintance. It was around this time that a landlady took her to court for urinating in the sink of said bedsit, but the case was dismissed by the magistrate who thought such an action logistically impossible for a lady.\n\nBy now Nina Hamnett was both relic and (barely) living treasure. If she had proved an unreliable witness to her own life, there were plenty of others to memorialise her, and she had at least a walk-on part in many accounts of the era. She also appeared thinly disguised in fictional portrayals of the Fitzrovian set, and it was one of these that in all likelihood inspired her horrific death, an act as chaotic and impulsive as her life had been.\n\nA radio play broadcast in December 1956 featured a character intended as an affectionate parody of Hamnett, but the portrayal of her drunken dissolution proved devastating for its model. She fell or — as most assumed — jumped from her window and was impaled on the railing spikes below. She lingered miserably in hospital for three days before dying.\n\nEven in the depths of squalor Hamnett never pitied herself and we shouldn’t either. She fit more living in one of her Paris sojourns than most of us do in a lifetime, and as the Times obituary noted, “Miss Hamnett was a complete success as a person; generous, good humoured, loyal, and witty.”\n\nFITZROVIA TO ST JAMES\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the group posthumously labelled the “Fitzrovians” colonised the streets around Fitzroy Square, a stone’s throw from Bloomsbury but a world away in temperament. In any case it was more a loose band of drinking companions than a movement; according to the Times Literary Supplement, Fitzrovia was “a world of outsiders, down-and-outs, drunks, sensualists, homosexuals and eccentrics”. In short, the spiritual home of Strange Flowers.\n\nEven during the area’s heyday there were people doing exactly what I did – stalking the streets looking for traces of bohemian life, much like their forefathers may have prodded lunatics in Bedlam. But making the circuit today is inevitably disappointing. Now thronged with ad agencies and media companies, Fitzrovia offers little to remind the visitor of the rich counter-cultural life which once thrived here.\n\nFrench poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine pitched up in Fitzrovia in 1872 during their riotous affair. Forty years later, artist and model Nina Hamnett lost her virginity in the same house; sadly it has disappeared, the block of terrace houses erased and replaced by glass-fronted mediocrity. The “Queen of Bohemia” started her long, messy decline after a libel dispute with Aleister Crowley in 1934, but she stayed loyal to Fitzrovia long after the party people moved on, propping up bars and exchanging drinks for memories.\n\nOne of Hamnett’s favourite destinations was the Wheatsheaf, an intimate pub which would satisfy anyone’s conception of a typically English drinking hole; Julian Maclaren-Ross was also frequently to be found at the bar. More successful men of letters, such as Dylan Thomas and George Orwell, liquefied their royalties in the pub which also lent its name to the “Wheatsheaf Writers”, including Philip “Public Baby” O’Connor. It was here and in other Fitzrovian haunts that magenta-haired Quentin Crisp first found the social acceptance that eluded him elsewhere, though he was still not entirely safe from harassment, as Andrew Barrow reports in Quentin & Philip: “At the Wheatsheaf, the landlord Mr Redvers was accused of running ‘a funny sort of place’ and when he replied, ‘How funny?’, the police pointed in Quentin’s direction.”\n\nEven bohemians had to line their stomachs, and the eatery of choice was frequently the Eiffel Tower restaurant. A typical night might have seen Ronald Firbank entertaining Nancy Cunard; Wyndham Lewis, Ezra Pound and fellow Vorticists trying to propel Britain’s arts and letters into the machine age; and caped crypto-fascist and self-styled King of Poland Count Geoffrey Potocki de Montalk hawking his eccentric verse. And, inevitably, Augustus John presiding over it all, making the first of several appearances on our journey. It was John who ultimately determined the Fitrovians’ look and lifestyle as well as the locations for their rigorous schedule of drinking and arguing. While he lodged at Fitzrovia’s northernmost periphery, he spent much of his time at its geographical and social centre. He was of inestimable importance in the development of the bohemian sensibility and many of us, whether we know it or not, live lives whose parameters were first explored by John and his fellow travellers.\n\nAnd it was John who “discovered” the Fitzrovians’ social hub, the Fitzroy Tavern, in 1926. Like the Wheatsheaf, the Fitzroy still operates, but with its clean carpets and burbling slot machines it’s hard to imagine this corner pub as “the headquarters of London Bohemia”. Framed articles allude to the long list of illustrious drinkers who once patronised the pub, often the target of those rubberneckers I mentioned earlier. Nina Hamnett recalled seeing off one such pair of voyeurs: “The first thing they said was: ‘Are there any dope fiends here? We have been looking all over London for them.’ I said [...] ‘Good gracious, no, the people in this quarter when they have a few pennies and want to feel excited only drink beer, or, if they can afford it, gin and whisky. I think you had better go back to Mayfair if you want to find people who take drugs.’”\n\nSoho, on the other side of Oxford Street, picked up where Fitzrovia left off after the Second World War, and of course it remains the centre of London’s gay life. Just across the road from the erstwhile Colony Room – where Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and John Deakin once drank themselves to the threshold of literal madness – is the ghost of the Gargoyle Club. There, on an evening in the late 1920s, you might have bumped shoulders with Noël Coward and Tallulah Bankhead, or encountered Brian Howard, Stephen Tennant and other Bright Young Things (Tennant’s brother David established the club in 1925). The Gargoyle was where the underworld really did meet the elite: its membership list once bristled with royalty, including the trendsetting Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII, later still Duke of Windsor). But it was Augustus John (yes, him again) who led the charge to take this bastion of the Establishment and plant Bohemia’s flag in its turret. The sense of the old older being broken down and remade was brilliantly reflected in the décor which featured a mosaic of mirror shards taken from derelict chateaux and arranged by Henri Matisse.\n\nFurther south on Regent Street, just off Piccadilly Circus, lurks the grim, veiled hulk of a building which until recently housed the Café Royal. Its golden age was the 1890s, when literary and artistic royalty made the Royal the centre of London’s cultural life. James McNeill Whistler, Aubrey Beardsley, Walter Sickert, Max Beerbohm, Arthur Symons, John Gray and – most famously – Oscar Wilde all sipped and supped here. And it was here that Frank Harris, in the presence of George Bernard Shaw and Lord Alfred Douglas, tried to convince Wilde to go abroad rather than face certain defeat in the libel case against Lord Queensberry. Douglas and Harris were still there when a subsequent generation came to relive the Wilde life at the Royal. Among the artists’ models and hangers-on you could find Ronald Firbank, Michael Arlen, Peter Warlock (a.k.a. Philip Heseltine), Betty May, Duff Cooper, Nancy Cunard, Evan Morgan and – naturally – Augustus John. The Royal only closed in 2008, and the building presents a mournful spectacle these days, wreathed in scaffolding as it is converted into a hotel.\n\nAlso gone are the New Burlington Galleries, which once sulked in the shadows of the Royal Academy and were the site of a Surrealist exhibition in the movement’s annus mirabilis, 1936. On July 1, Salvador Dalí arrived at the gallery accompanied by two dogs to give a lecture entitled “Authentic Paranoiac Fantasies” while dressed in a diving suit meant to symbolise his plunge into the depths of the subconscious. Unfortunately he had not thought to undertake this journey with breathing equipment, and only the urgent deployment of a wrench prevented his early demise. But who wielded said tool? Biographers of Lord Berners and Dalí’s patron Edward James each claim glory for their subjects. From Lord Berners, by Mark Amory: “Berners found a hammer and, though every blow was agonisingly loud for the victim, struggled to save him. Eventually, and not a moment too soon, a workman with a spanner succeeded.” Compare that with this passage form Surreal Eden, by Margaret Hooks: “Not long into the performance it became clear Dalí was having difficulty breathing through the helmet, which had become stuck. He had to be pried out of it by Edward using the billiard cue, both becoming hilariously entangled with the leashes of the dogs in the process.” A surreal mystery for the ages.\n\nStrolling through the Burlington Arcade and past Ladurée’s gilded grotto you come to stately department store Fortnum & Mason, where camp couturier Bunny Roger once worked. The man born a hundred years ago as Neil Munro Roger enlivened and frequently hosted the great parties of his age, greeting revellers with rouge on his cheeks and a queeny quip on his tongue. Curiously it was as much modesty as ostentation that compelled Roger to make an after-dinner joke of his war record, which was in fact distinguished by bravery. Years later he claimed to have advanced into battle brandishing a rolled-up copy of Vogue, issuing the command “When in doubt, powder heavily”. At once fastidious and flamboyant, Roger was an influential stylist who cinched, tucked and starched to present a unique silhouette inspired by classic tailoring, drawing references from the Edwardian era right back to the dandies.\n\nCount d’Orsay was proclaimed as the last of that breed. Like Roger, this French fashion plate was an unlikely soldier, having served under the Bourbon Restoration, subsequently pitching up in London to reside with Lord and Lady Blessington on St James’s Square in a precarious ménage. “The mansion,” sniped early d’Orsay biographer W. Teignmouth Shore, “was fitted and furnished in a style that only great wealth could afford or ill taste admire.” Something of which d’Orsay himself could never be accused; with his much-aped sartorial refinement the count was to the 1820s what Beau Brummell had been to the Regency. Shore: “His youth, his handsome face, his debonairness, his wit, were irresistible…He rode in Hyde Park perfectly ‘turned out’, the admired of those who were accustomed to receive, not to give, admiration.” D’Orsay inspired the haughty profile of New Yorker mascot Eustace Tilley, but is little remembered in his adoptive home. While the house bears one of London’s famous “blue plaques” denoting association with an historical figure, it actually commemorates another threesome: the trio of British Prime Ministers who lived there (not concurrently). It now houses the Chatham House think tank.\n\nI am determined to live my life, to drain its cup to the very dregs, to live each day, each hour, feverishly perhaps just now – I am absolutely ravenous for Life: what I do matters not so very much, as long as I live!\n\n- Peter Warlock\n\nBritish composer Peter Warlock was born, magnificently, in London’s Savoy Hotel under the fractionally less magnificent birth name Philip Heseltine, in 1894. His father was an affluent solicitor who died when Philip was only two years old and the boy had a close, at times claustrophobic relationship with his mother.\n\nYoung Philip evinced an early and intense interest for music. While still at Eton he conceived something close to a mania for the music of Frederick Delius, and through his mother met the composer. Although his passion for Delius would cool, partly replaced by another for Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren, they remained long-term friends – an impressive achievement given the burn rate of Warlock’s associates.\n\nWarlock’s enthusiasms were as tempestuous as his disdain, and the flip side of that antsy vitality of the opening quote was the crippling despair to which he would periodically succumb. He conducted vituperative public feuds, writing obscene limericks about his enemies which he at one stage anthologised on a toilet roll.\n\nIn 1915, Warlock contrived to meet D.H. Lawrence, only to break with him the following year. The ensuing rift brought out each man’s scatological qualities. “Heseltine ought to be flushed down a sewer,” said Lawrence, “for he is a simple shit”. Warlock, meanwhile, used an original Lawrence manuscript as toilet paper. He sued Lawrence over his thinly-veiled appearance as Halliday in Women in Love, winning an out-of-court settlement.\n\nPhilip Heseltine first used his most famous pseudonym in an article about Eugene Goossens in 1916 (another of his many handles was Roger A. Ramsbottom; his humour remained arrested in adolescence). The name Peter Warlock was evidently chosen more or less at random, although it offered a premonition of his later interest in the occult. It was also a useful identity for the Bohemian existence he was by now pursuing (contemporaries used the pseudonym and birth name interchangeably; I refer to him here, as posterity generally does, as Warlock).\n\nBohemian chatter has Warlock stripping off in Piccadilly Circus, tearing naked through quiet village lanes on his motorbike, or conducting what British tabloids inevitably refer to as “three-in-a-bed romps”. He shared a “queer barn-like studio” in Battersea with writer and composer Cecil Gray and frequented the Café Royal, inevitably coming under the influence of Augustus John. There he met ‘Puma’ – Minnie Lucy Channing, a beautiful artist’s model – whom he would later marry. Virginia Nicholson claims in Among the Bohemians that his table “was always a magnet to those who found his ribaldry and invective entertaining.” Typically, Warlock turned on his onetime local, later describing the Royal as “the very vortex of the cesspool of corruption”.\n\nWarlock’s early career was erratic. Nancy Cunard’s mother got him a job as a music critic at the Daily Mail in 1915, where he worked for only four months. Oppressed by London and fearing that his previous exemption from the draft would be reviewed, Warlock left for Ireland with Puma in 1917. By that time the two had had a son, Nigel, but gave him away.\n\nPoverty forced Warlock to retreat to his family’s house in Wales, a humiliation which nonetheless found him composing prolifically. He was also deepening his interest in the occult which had emerged in Ireland. Augustus John reports that on a visit to a Norfolk church, Warlock had light-heartedly suggested sacrificing his mistress Barbara Peache, whereupon the building was struck by lightning. Warlock was influenced by Aleister Crowley and maintained a friendship with Victor Neuberg, Crowley’s hapless, traumatised disciple.\n\nWarlock returned to London to edit a music journal, The Sackbut, an exercise which ended predictably in rancour and recriminations. He spent much of the second half of the 1920s in a cottage in Eynsford, Kent with a regular stream of visitors including Nina Hamnett, Constant Lambert and Lord Berners. A regular Sunday ritual saw guests conducting a program of sea shanties and other off-colour musical offerings directed at the nearby church, followed by Olympian drinking bouts. Their excesses even bested Nina Hamnett, a woman who – God knows – could hold her drink. On one such occasion she simply face planted and passed out. For Warlock, wild exultation alternated with crippling depressions, and his workflow followed a similar pattern of total absorption or utter inertia.\n\nIt was the latter which won out in the end. On this day in 1930, Warlock died in Chelsea’s Tite Street, just two doors down from Oscar Wilde’s London home, succumbing to a gas leak. He was only 36 years old. The subsequent inquest returned an open verdict, but various clues point to suicide: Warlock had already spoken of taking his own life, revised his will shortly before his death, took care to put the cat out before retiring on the night in question.\n\nWarlock left more than his music behind. Seven months after his death one of his mistresses, Jessica Goldblatt, gave birth to a son. That boy grew up to be one of Britain’s most high-profile art critics, Brian Sewell. Over 12 years ago he was dropping clues to his father’s identity which would have been unmistakable to anyone familiar with Warlock’s story. But it was only with the recent publication of his autobiography, Outsider, that he revealed his father’s name (along with accounts of queer sexual abandon to rival Edmund White’s City Boy).\n\nSewell’s extraordinary voice, a kind of exasperated, beyond-posh bray apparently instilled by his mother, is a long-running meme in Britain. But the similarities with his father – critical incivility, sexual incontinence and manic depression – are even stronger.\n\nOf course it’s unfair to reduce any artist to the sum of his eccentricities. I can claim no detailed knowledge of Warlock’s oeuvre but would humbly suggest two pieces as a starting point if you would like to explore further. The first is The Curlew, an intensely melancholic setting of four Yeats poems. And to bring you back from the brink, a far more uplifting and seasonally appropriate work.\n\nIt is one of the stranger coincidences of British cultural history that two of its most renowned bohemian artists were both born in the Welsh seaside town of Tenby. In fact so readily identified with bohemia were Augustus John and Nina Hamnett that they were styled, respectively, as the king and queen of the autonomous, borderless realm.\n\nTenby is, as Jan Morris writes in The Matter of Wales, “the most absolutely un-Welsh of all the towns of Wales”, looking “as though it has been deposited there in toto from somewhere altogether different”. You can see her point as you approach the town over the rippling, rivuletted hills of the hinterland, dotted about with rotting castles and double-glazed hamlets, each with its own comically dour chapel. As you make the last descent it is suddenly there, its medieval wall warmly embracing a carnivalesque array of tall houses stretching expansively along soaring cliffs guarding vast sandy beaches, the whole ensemble tenderly crouching down at its mid-point to caress a little harbour. Dazzling sunshine, not the first thing you’d associate with late-winter Wales, enhances the sense of unreality. Steeling ourselves for the full Morrissey “Everyday is Like Sunday” experience, Partner and self instead encounter something altogether more Mediterranean.\n\nLike the Morgans of Tredegar House, Tenby hitched its wagon to the Tudor star, introducing a period of trading prosperity which ended when the town picked the wrong side in the English Civil War. This long downturn only turned around again in the 19th century when the town became a sought-after holiday spot. “Today it is all tourism,” says Morris. “The harbour built for the merchantmen and the fishing-fleet is given over to pleasure-craft, and most of those waterfront houses are hotels and boarding-houses. Still, the little town feels above all industrious and astute, as though its merchants are still hard at work at their lading tables, or awaiting a shipment from Flanders on the rising tide.”\n\nIn 1878, Augustus John was born in one of those waterfront houses, a stout, bay-windowed building outside the walls, looking out to sea which today is a curious milky olive colour. Biographer Michael Holroyd lyrically evokes young Gus’s love of his first home:\n\nIn particular he loved the harbour at Tenby with its fleet of luggers and fishing-smacks, and the russet sails of the trawlers; and the long expanse of Tenby beaches, their sand spongy like cake – a golden playground two miles long. Here, while still very young, Gus would play all day with his brothers and sisters, catching shrimps in the tidal pools where the sea-urchins delicately flowered, paddling through the waves that seethed and criss-crossed the shore, and elaborately hauling buckets of sand up the blue slate-coloured cliffs. Where the sea had worn these cliffs away, devious caves had been hollowed out, as if gnawed by giant sea-mice – dark, dangerous and exciting. Slabs of slate rock lay bundled at the entrances, covered with barnacles and emerald seaweed.\n\nWhen John senior cautioned Gus about the dangers of gypsies, he deliberately sought them out in an encampment outside Tenby and soon adopted their ways, setting a template for bohemian living whose after-effects are felt to this day. “We are the sort of people our fathers warned us against!” as Augustus later said to Nina Hamnett.\n\nShe, meanwhile, was born in Tenby on Valentine’s Day, 1890. Her birthplace is approached from a small gated lane, but viewed from the rear it becomes apparent that these houses occupy the most dramatic position in a town not wanting for architectonic theatrics. With her officer father often absent on military duties, Nina was left largely in care of her grandmother, as Denise Hooker writes in Nina Hamnett: queen of bohemia:\n\nNina resisted all her grandmother’s efforts to make her behave like a lady and roamed among the sand-dunes, exploring the caves cut deep into the cliffs. Her favourite occupation was sitting alone at the end of the pier, fishing for pollock and sprats. She made friends with the bathing-machine boys, who taught her their extensive vocabulary of swear words. Nina could stand her own with any of the boys and did not hesitate to express her dislike of the local butcher-boy by kicking over his tray of meat and punching him in the stomach. She had equally violent arguments with her grandmother, who was quite unable to control her.\n\nStrangely Nina and Augustus never crossed paths in the small town. Once in London Hamnett would occasionally follow John down the street at a starstruck distance, and only later in London’s Café Royal did their friendship develop as they bonded over their shared background, and they became twinned fixtures of the capital’s bohemian haunts. Augustus remained loyal to Nina in her long decline.\n\nThere is a third painter to mention here, also a noted portraitist: Augustus’s older sister Gwen John. Although born in nearby Haverfordwest, she grew up in Tenby, in a house just off the cliff-top promenade where her younger brother was born. “The local inhabitants of Tenby in the late 1880s and 1890s thought the Johns very bohemian and wild,” notes Gwen’s biographer Sue Roe. “As small children they played on the beach without shoes or socks; now they began to pay the local children to go with them to their attic bedrooms in Victoria Street, where they would paint their portraits.”\n\nAll three were vividly contrarian spirits, the wide-open skies and churning waves of Tenby having instilled a wild restlessness in them along with a longing for farther shores. They were all called to France before the First World War: Nina took to the zinc bars and cabarets of Montparnasse as if born to them, Augustus adopted the Provencal town of Martigues as his own. Gwen, meanwhile, embarked on an affair with Auguste Rodin, more than twice her age. When his passion cooled her obsession only increased, and among the papers of Rodin’s estate are over a thousand letters from her. She later turned to Catholicism and led a reclusive life in stark contrast to the revels of her fellow Tenbian bohemians.\n\nOne of Augustus John’s last public acts before his death in 1961 was to return to Tenby to accept the Freedom of the Borough. On that occasion he recalled his childhood rambles, claiming “I could take those walks again now and I don’t think I would get lost.” But our own explorations are over for now and after a bag of hot chips overlooking Carmarthen Bay, we leave this distinguished trio in the last of our trio of Places as Partner and self head for the wild and holy hills further west.\n\nSketched by Augustus John, photographed by Berenice Abbott, fictionalised by Marcel Proust, befriended by Barbette, dressed by Coco Chanel, vilified by Jean Cocteau and related by marriage to Raymond Roussel: Strange Flowers couldn’t love Princess Violette Murat more if she came back to life and vacuumed behind our sofa.\n\nWhich, as it happens, would not be entirely out of character. “If she arrived to stay at the Ritz she would tie her hair up in a scarf, ask room service to send up a pail and some brushes and start scrubbing the bathroom,” writes Sebastian Faulks in The Fatal Englishman. Even the revivification might be considered appropriate for a woman who was often accompanied by a white rat who, she claimed, had been reincarnated.\n\nSo who was this strange, compulsive yet well-connected individual?\n\nShe was born Violette Ney d’Elchingen on this day in 1878, the issue of one illustrious Napoleonic line who would later marry into another. Despite these august familial bonds, her later life comes down to us not as a grand narrative but rather a series of provocative vignettes. Her real habitat appears to be the memoirs of the age. She inevitably appears as one of a conga line of names, all attendees of some between-the-wars boho blowout or other, her rotund form slipping away before the reader gets to know her. We find her, for instance, snubbing Proust before the famous 1922 dinner at which he met Joyce. The princess was apparently pained by an unflattering caricature of her as a tightwad in À la recherche du temps perdu, but it is typical of Murat’s arm’s-length relations with posterity that no-one seems sure which character is meant to be her.\n\nIn 1930 Janet Flanner informs her New Yorker readers of Murat’s attendance at a party thrown by Élisabeth de Gramont at which she “led in a Harlem wedding party as mother of the bride”. This is the very party, no less, where Dolly Wilde dragged up as her famous uncle. Murat was a subject of some of Dolly’s few published words. They record another encounter between the two women; their shared pharmacological and sexual tastes account for the voluptuous fug of the recollection:\n\n…’Madame la princesse’ – legend, tradition, the great name … The next meeting in her hotel, in the anonymous sitting-room, people, opium, drinks, the stimulant of artificiality leading to flirtations, exaggerations, the target of our wit, of our inner eye being the monstrous creature on the sofa who, through the haze of her smoke and drink, still retained a startling lucidity: the befuddled oracle, the unfallible débauchée with blind eyes and shapeless mouth – a presence rather than a human being. Her magnetism, defending the insolent ravages of time, consoled her vanity … Initiated into opium smoking … I found myself alone for the first time with this telepathic presence. Bemused with illusory happiness, affection became electrical between us. But her élans towards me … met with an unconscious drawing back, and her flattery met only with the impertinence of surprise. Night succeeded night, her magnetism crystallizing slowly – I was confused, my mind enthralled, my senses subordinated to my vision.\n\nThis is a rare glimpse into Murat’s inner life; a rumoured affair with Marie Laurencin is one of the few other indications that she might actually have maintained an existence away from the revelry. That the princess was addicted to opium was, however, widely acknowledged. Her most magnificent appearance in the anecdotes of the era finds her sharing a pipe with René Crevel in a decommissioned submarine she kept for the purpose in Toulon. Photographer Barbara Ker-Seymer captured the princess in the port town, even there a marginal figure (Ker-Seymer’s happy snaps preserved in the Tate Archive are well worth a look; her subjects include Brian Howard, Frederick Ashton and a young, galactically camp Bunny Roger).\n\nThe physical descriptions of Murat are rarely complimentary: French art dealer René Gimpel compared her hair to “a roof of well-twisted thatch…horizontal curls resembling miniature stove pipes.” For model Bettina Bergery, she was something out of Grimm’s Fairy Tales, “The Princess who changed into a Frog”. Nina Hamnett‘s biographer Denise Hooker describes her a “an enormous mountain of a woman”.\n\nBut exploring the Hamnett connection reveals another Murat, one generous not just in form but in nature as well. Hamnett and Murat mixed in similar circles, crossing paths in Le Boeuf sur le Toit (“What didn’t she know of the ins and outs of Paris?” said Augustus John admiringly of the princess). Murat, contrary to her tightfisted reputation, supported the perpetually penniless Hamnett for years, who repaid her loyalty by accompanying her to rehab (although she would toss the Vichy water away when no-one was looking). Yet another of those glittering mosaic pieces finds the two women at dinner with Nancy Cunard and Ronald Firbank to which the latter – disastrously – turned up sober, his habitual hysteria replaced by excruciating silence.\n\nViolette Murat died in 1936, and whatever else there is to learn about her beyond these walk-on parts is captive in unpublished diaries and letters, awaiting the attention of a sensitive biographer.\n\nGod speed.\n\nYou didn’t see me.\n\nI’m just going to leave these ten book selections here, but keep it to yourself. If you tell anybody they’ll be like “I don’t know what you think you saw, because James only does his book recommendations at the beginning and end of the year.” I’ll just deny it all, and they’ll think you’re losing your mind. You want that? You want people to think you’re crazy?\n\nNo, I didn’t think so.\n\nIn keeping with the season* this capsule collection focuses on travel, or at least a strong sense of place, book-ended by my city of birth and my city of residence. A recurring theme is writers making new lives for themselves away from their homelands, either by choice or necessity. This list also functions as tacit acknowledgement that our ongoing situation will prevent many of us from actually moving very far from where we currently dwell this year.\n\n* the northern summer; I remember how annoying it was growing up in Australia when everyone on the top half of the world presumed their seasons were global. No, some of us were well acquainted with the two-bar heater come July. By way of compensation much of the country has, by northern European standards, at least nine months of summer a year.\n\nJoyce Morgan: The Countess from Kirribilli\n\nI grew up near Sydney Harbour. My childhood home overlooked a container terminal, not at all the sexy part of the harbour that you see on postcards, but nonetheless a compelling tableau which fired my young imagination. I would watch ships inch in and out of port and reflect that everyone, everything on board had seen more of the world than I had. Had I been born somewhat earlier to a shipping magnate perhaps I too might have grown up in the prime harbour frontage of Kirribilli like a certain Mary Beauchamp (1866-1941). A cousin of Katherine Mansfield, in later life she would be a sister-in-law to Bertrand Russell and mistress to H. G. Wells. But it was after travelling through Europe and marrying a Junker count that she became known as Elizabeth von Arnim. She had married into a storied family; as with the Mendelssohns, it’s extremely difficult to keep track of which Arnim is which (two of them turn up in entirely different circumstances here, for instance). It was on and inspired by the count’s estate in what is now Poland that our heroine penned the work that secured her reputation, the highly popular Elizabeth and her German Garden. All of this Joyce Morgan recounts in The Countess from Kirribilli.\n\nCharmian Clift: Mermaid Singing (buy through Bookshop.org: UK/US)\n\nAustralian writers Charmian Clift and George Johnston moved in decidedly more bohemian circles. Shortly after the Second World War the married couple left Sydney and, after a spell in London, ended up on Kalymnos, one of the Greek islands that was all but emptied around this time with many residents ending up in – Australia. Johnston and Clift continued to swim against the tide, moving onto Hydra before it was discovered by international travellers, as captured in companion volume Peel Me a Lotus (UK/US). It offers the same acute, lyrical observations, but with an increasing note of sadness; Clift would commit suicide in 1969. Clift and Johnston, and Hydra, were later better known for their association with Leonard Cohen, but honestly that was one of the least of the attractions when I visited the island. Friends have tried to convert me to his music but it just won’t take, and it is now consigned to the “things that James has tried and never needs to try again” along with natural wine, olives, Wes Anderson movies, zip-lining, musicals and literally any spectator sport.\n\nAlicia Foster: Nina Hamnett\n\nGod knows I love Nina Hamnett. I love her art, I love her lust for life, I love her filthy, hard-won wisdom, I love her fearless independence, I love the tales of her bohemian exploits – down but not out in Paris and London. Why she isn’t better known I couldn’t say; her work has become more or less invisible, and the last book about her was Denise Hooker’s 1986 Queen of bohemia (which is fine as an introduction, but overly reliant on the artist’s own memoirs). So the news of both a major retrospective of Hamnett’s work at Charleston (the Bloomsbury exclave once home to Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant) and a new book could not be more welcome. Alicia Foster’s Nina Hamnett is part of a series of compact monographs of women artists issued by Eiderdown Books, which also includes studies of Lee Miller, Eileen Agar and the magnificently dandyish Marlow Moss.\n\nJohn Hopkins: Tangier Diaries (UK/US)\n\nThis reissue takes us to the Moroccan port where cheap living and the unique administrative anomaly of the international zone fostered a spirit of tolerance and hedonism. While the “Interzone” formally ended in 1956, that freedom persisted, supporting a bohemian community of foreigners. The diaries of English writer John Hopkins, who died earlier this year, offer a clear-eyed account of the city and its famous inhabitants and visitors, including his mentor Paul Bowles, William Burroughs and Brion Gysin. “Tangier is a lax place,” notes Hopkins. “Too much dope and too many servants. Food is fresh, booze is cheap and rents are low. In other words, paradise!”\n\nMelanie C. Hawthorne: Women, Citizenship, and Sexuality: The Transnational Lives of Renée Vivien, Romaine Brooks, and Natalie Barney ( US)\n\nYou may recall Melanie C. Hawthorne as a translator of Rachilde and biographer of duellist, writer and sculptor Gisèle d’Estoc, a cross-dressing bisexual anarchist. The featured trio of her latest book will be familiar to long-term readers (and if not, here’s a fictional window into their world, and a primer on their complex, interlocking relations). In this academic text, Hawthorne shows how the three creative professionals from the US (Barney and Brooks) and Britain (Vivien) used the privilege bestowed by their wealthy families to explore the world and script new lives for themselves in France, but also the limits that their gender placed on even that privilege. “Drawing on the discourse of jurisprudence, the history of the passport, and original archival research on all three women, the books tells the story of women’s evolving claims to citizenship in their own right.”\n\nAdrien Bosc: Outrageous Horizon (UK)\n\nFrench writer Adrien Bosc’s Outrageous Horizon (translated by Frank Wynne) is a fictional rendering of events covered in the 2018 book Escape from Vichy, by Eric T. Jennings. In 1941, the Paul-Lemerle was the last ship to leave Marseilles before the port was blocked by the Vichy regime. The Martinique-bound voyage reads like a Modernist bottle episode, with passengers including exiled German writer Anna Seghers, French Surrealist André Breton and his wife, painter Jacqueline Lamba, along with French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss and Russian revolutionary Victor Serge. But there are equally compelling characters to discover both before and after the voyage, including the American journalist Varian Fry, whose bravery helped thousands to escape from the Nazis, and Martinique writer Suzanne Césaire, whose encounter with Breton led her to develop the concept of Afro-Surrealism.\n\nThomas Sparr: German Jerusalem (UK/US)\n\nThis year marks a century since the establishment of the Jerusalem district of Rehavia, a planned, orderly contrast to the contested labyrinthine of the almost adjacent Old City. Along with nearby Talbiya, it later became a magnet for German-speaking Jews fleeing persecution in Europe, including philosophers Martin Buber and Gershom Scholem. It was in Rehavia, for instance, that the exiled Else Lasker-Schüler discovered the reality of the “Orient”, a realm she had long romanticised in her writing; she died here in 1945. Thomas Sparr’s study (translated by Stephen Brown) also offers a welcome introduction to writer Mascha Kaléko, who was starting to enjoy popular success for her poetry just as the Nazis took over. Although she had contact with Lasker-Schüler and other bohemian writers in interwar Berlin, Kaléko spent years of exile in the US before arriving in Jerusalem in 1959. Considering – well – everything that has happened in the region in the last century, it is also interesting to note that Rehavia was the birthplace of Brit Shalom, a movement through which Buber, Scholem and others voiced opposition to the Zionist project. Lasker-Schüler’s solution of sending Jews and Arabs off to a fun fair may have been slightly more whimsical, but it shared Brit Shalom’s far-sighted concern that simply introducing newcomers and displacing inhabitants would result in calamity.\n\nGesa Stedman, Stefano Evangelista (eds.): Happy in Berlin? (UK/US)\n\nTo an extent, the residents of Rehavia were seeking to recreate the intellectual openness and cultural vitality of Weimar Berlin, the setting for our last three selections. Happy in Berlin? is a modestly scaled exhibition currently running at Berlin’s Literaturhaus, which examines English writers who gravitated to the German capital in the 1920s and early 1930s. Christopher Isherwood may well be the first name that comes to mind here, and it is Christopher and his kind (including W. H. Auden and Stephen Spender) who dominate the exhibition, but the catalogue is a more rounded and nuanced study. We learn for instance that Berlin offered the best opportunities to view cutting edge cinema at the time, which proved an influence on the filmmaking activities of H. D. and Bryher after their visits to the city. Other writers featured include Vita Sackville-West’s camp brother Eddie, Wyndham Lewis, who rejected the “buggers’ paradise” beloved of Isherwood and his friends and succumbed to the allure of Hitler, and footnotes like Helen D’Albernon, an ambassador’s wife and Sargent subject who gave lavish parties but found at one such event that her distinctly ancien shepherdess costume struck a bum note in the fractious city.\n\nCurt Corrinth: Potsdamer Platz (UK/US)\n\nYou would be forgiven for drawing a blank at the name Curt Corrinth. His 1919 novella Potsdamer Platz is best known for the accompanying illustrations by Paul Klee while the text itself reads like a Drunk History retelling of a Félicien Rops etching. The titular Berlin square, which in the Weimar era was a frenetic junction where two rail termini constantly disgorged goggle-eyed provincials into the heart of the teeming capital, becomes the centre of an orgiastic liberation movement, a pornocracy that seeks to supplant the young republic. Translated by W. C. Bamberger, Potsdamer Platz is best approached as a demented curio rather than a lost classic. But it is particularly striking how Corrinth, evidently in isolation, mirrored the messianic insanity of the “Inflation Saints” – Ludwig Christian Haeusser and the other wandering prophets who were starting to preach a gospel of violently libidinous salvation to traumatised post-war Germany around the same time.\n\nBarbara Hales: Black Magic Woman: Gender and the Occult in Weimar Germany(UK/US)\n\nThis persistence of primal, arcane forces at a time of rapidly advancing mechanisation was typical of a city that attracted both Albert Einstein and Aleister Crowley, in a polarised period that embraced both the irrationality of Dada and the sobriety of the New Objectivity. Barbara Hales’s academic text investigates Weimar archetypes such as the New Woman, whose wilful independence could be read by the misogynistic observer as a dark force akin to witchcraft. “Whether fictive or historical, the occult woman’s supernatural ability to tap into an unseen world serves to reconfigure female identity in a time of social and political crisis in the in the popular Weimar imagination: from its traditional conception of woman as nurturing mother and demure housewife to a beastly monster, who threatens the enfeebled and emasculated post-World War One psyche.”\n\nOK, I’m out.\n\nRemember, you didn’t see me."
