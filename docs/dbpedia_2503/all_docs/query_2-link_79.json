This is followed by a technical overview of electronic instruments, specifically the synthesizer, whose development will be traced from the Theremin. Musical trends such as the 1950s avant-garde and Minimalism will serve as a bridge to examinations of seminal bands such as the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Kraftwerk, Can, Neu:, Brian Eno and the Talking Heads among others; the technical knowledge gained from the initial lectures on tape techniques and electronic instruments will be used to gain a deeper understanding of the music of these artists.\n\nFundamentals of Music for Non-Majors (3 credits)\n\nFAM1100-001; (Monday/Wednesday/Friday; 2:30-3:25 p.m.)\n\nBreadth of Knowledge Areas: FA Fine Arts\n\nThe appreciation of music is enhanced by a deeper knowledge of musical materials and structures.

Hip Hop Culture, from its inception as a hyper-regional and even intimate form of creative expression, has grown to become an interconnection of art forms with global reach. As an interdisciplinary art and a billion-dollar industry, Hip Hop has experienced a series of conceptions and misconceptions informing its existence. Like many art forms before it, Hip Hop has been commodified and subsequently disconnected from its essence resulting in both broad appeal as well as inauthentic representation. In true Hip Hop fashion, however, this dichotomy has been “remixed” to produce arguably, the most accessible and equitable art form created in the last century, though at a cost.\n\nHistory of Rock n Roll (3 Credits)\n\nFAM2011-001; (Tuesday/Thursday, 2-3:20 p.m.)\n\nBreadth of Knowledge Areas: FA Fine Arts\n\nRock and Roll had humble beginnings in the Southeastern United States, but over time it developed into a force, beyond mere entertainment, that has defined youth culture on a global scale. Rock and roll culture is embedded in the fabric of youth identity. Rock and roll music is a commodity that young people use daily, often with an obsessive devotion. Marketing campaigns that target youth are so relentless that young people are under enormous media and social pressure to join the ranks of consumers. The goal of History of Rock and Roll is, therefore, threefold: 1. To provide for students a chronological survey that examines the relationship between the music, its most successful and colorful artists, the associated recording technology, and the impact of the genre on American culture. 2. Through critical listening and reading, the course will provide students with useful, evaluative tools so that they can make historically informed and thoughtful decisions about the music they select and enjoy. 3. Finally, the course will encourage students to seek and appreciate new styles, and perhaps inspire those who seek a career as a pop music artist. No prerequisite.\n\nInfluential Female Vocalists\n\nFAM2093-005; (Online, asynchronously)\n\nBreadth of Knowledge Areas: FA Fine Arts\n\nThis course recognizes and explores the music of influential female vocalists of the 20th and 21st centuries.

This class will examine their groundbreaking production techniques, individual writing styles, and the impact of their music on other musicians and social trends.\n\nMusic of Woodstock (3 credits)\n\nFAM2070-001; Online, asynchronously\n\nBreadth of Knowledge Areas: FA Fine Arts, SCE Society, Culture, and Ethics\n\nThe course thoroughly examines the musical artists and the works they performed at history's most iconic pop music festival, Woodstock (officially the \"Woodstock Music and Art Fair\"). As many as half a million people or more, descending on a dairy farm in upstate New York in August of 1969 for \"three days of peace and music,\" were treated to a wildly diverse lineup of musicians and artists hailing from no less than five different continents. The Woodstock Festival is the perfect prism through which to view the 1960s popular scene, when various streams of musical genres converged to forge a new breed of \"pop\"; the soundtrack of the counterculture and a young, idealistic generation. How did a music festival, let alone pop music in general, become a catalyst for social, political, and artistic change and upheaval? How was the motley assortment of musicians of various stripes, genres, genders, and ethnicities received by the crowd, temporarily the fourth-largest city in New York? How did this crowd co-exist and survive without virtually any of the realities that plague a similar-sized urban center? These are just a few of the many questions posed in this course as we study and—equally as important—savor and experience the musical performances of the 1969 Woodstock Festival.\n\nSound Meditations (1 credit)\n\nCCMS1010-001 (Mondays; 12:20-1:40 p.m.)\n\nThis course will provide students with an introduction into mindfulness and expressive meditation techniques using modern electronic music production, and various other instruments and noise makers.

Pedagogy will be founded in the idea of improving concentration ability by developing a meditation practice that leads to insight and self-realization. Each week students will participate in this expressive sound meditation, explore a different theme (creativity block, emotional intelligence, and leadership) and be encouraged to authentically share any insight after the meditation. Collaboration, sharing, openness, and mindfulness are all necessary requisites for success in this class.\n\nWhat’s Hot in Popular Music (3 credits)\n\nFAM2062-001; online\n\nBreadth of Knowledge Areas: FA Fine Arts\n\nThis online course examines current popular music in its trending styles and genres.
