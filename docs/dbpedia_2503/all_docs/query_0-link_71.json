        "text": "On September 29, 2012, her life-sized sculpture of the beloved and legendary racemare Zenyatta was unveiled and joins the statue of John Henry and the busts of jockeys Laffit Pincay Jr.and Chris McCarron as Ms. Kaiser's fourth major work to be permanently installed in Santa Anita Park's Paddock Gardens. She has also portrayed popular racing personalities Bill Shoemaker and Charlie Whittingham.\n\nShe prefers to work in a highly realistic manner, feeling that the natural beauty of the Thoroughbred is best portrayed without embellishment or stylization. Her years of daily observation and interaction with horses have been the best training for her remarkable ability to achieve the anatomical accuracy and individual characteristics of her subject for which her work is noted.\n\nNina Kaiser lives and works on her mini-farm in North San Diego County, along with an assortment of 30 plus rescued farm animals, the inspiration and subjects of her installation \"Animal Anarchy\" at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine."
