        "text": "What are the key parts of your job?\n\nI manage a team of Relationship Managers working across the region, which I love. They are a brilliant group of people, all specialising in different art forms and disciplines, and they manage our relationship with funded organisations and projects across the North. I also have overview of the work we do with museums in my area.\n\nWhat did you do before working at the Arts Council?\n\nI’ve mostly worked in the museum sector working for local government museums, National Museums and I’ve even worked at the Bermuda Museum. I’ve previously worked on various projects and secondments for DCMS and the Home Office throughout my career, and I’ve also sat on the board of various arts centres and have also dabbled in the music world.\n\nWhy did you apply for your role?\n\nI joined in 2013 when the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council became part of the Arts Council, so this was an amazing opportunity to help integrate museums into the organisation. My role is like that of my previous role at The Yorkshire Museums Council which I loved, so it was just amazing timing.\n\nWhat’s the best thing about working at the Arts Council?\n\nIt’s hard to choose one thing! The people I work with are amazing, and the impact we can make is amazing too.\n\nWhat is something you’ve learned since working here?\n\nThat you can never underestimate the power creativity and culture can have in transforming people’s lives and aspirations.\n\nWhat’s your favourite memory of arts or culture?\n\nHaving to learn to drive a steam train when working at the National Railway Museum - I love museums and how they can inspire and bring joy to people!\n\nWhat’s one unusual or interesting thing about you?\n\nAside from working at the Arts Council, I live on and run a rare breed farm in North Yorkshire, and I am also a qualified shepherd with my own flock of over 80 rare breed sheep. I have also been on BBC Countryfile, but I was with my animals raising awareness of rare breeds, not talking about anything to do with work!"
