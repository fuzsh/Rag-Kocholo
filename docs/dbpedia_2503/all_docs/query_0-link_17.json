We Generally Ship Weekly. Our Most Frequently Used Airports Are South Bend, IN, Kalamazoo, MI Or Chicago, IL. Our Most Frequently Used Airlines Are United, Delta, And American Airlines.\n\nWe Book The Flight A Few Days Prior To The Puppy‚Äôs Predetermined Shipping Date, Then Call Or Email The Customer With All The Information They Will Need To Receive The Puppy. This Information Includes Arrival/Departure Times, Flight And Confirmation Numbers, Etc. Before A Puppy Is Sent To Their New Home, They Will Visit Our Local Veterinarian To Receive One Last Examination And The Health Certificate They Need To Fly.\n\nThe Puppy Is Sent Home With All Of Their Paperwork (Exams, Vaccination Record, Registration Papers, Etc.) And All Things In A Typical Five Star Canine Welcome Pack, Secured Directly On Top Of The Puppy‚Äôs Crate. The Puppy Will Fly In Their Own Individual Airline Approved Travel Crate For The Customer To Keep. Directly Attached To The Crate Will Be A Food And Water Dish Filled With Hard Food And Ice Chips For The Puppy‚Äôs Convenience During Travel. They Will Also Have Potty Pads On The Bottom Of Their Crate, As Well As Shredded Paper To Cover Any Potty Accidents They May Have During Their Travels.\n\n‚Äã‚Äã After Time To Potty And Play, The Puppy Will Be Checked Into Their Flight Prior To Departure. The Puppy Travels In A Pressure, Temperature, And Altitude Controlled Cargo Center In The Plane. This Area Is Designated For Safe Animal Travel And Has Specific Airline Handlers. If Your Puppy Has A Layover, They Will Be Offered More Food And Water If Needed At That Time. If Layover Times Permit, Your Puppy Will Also Be Offered A Potty Break And A Chance To Stretch Their Little Legs.\n\nWe Work Very Closely With The Airlines And Have Confidence In Their Ability To Give Our Puppies The Very Best Treatment. They Continuously Go Above And Beyond What Is Asked Of Them To Ensure Our Puppies Have Everything They Could Want Or Need During Their Travels To Their New Family."
