        "text": "About\n\nFashion, art, design, science and technology collide in the world of endlessly innovative and internationally acclaimed Dutch fashion designer Iris van Herpen.\n\nExclusive to Brisbane, this exhibition is an immersive sensory exploration of her practice with 130 garments and accessories in conversation with contemporary artworks, natural history specimens and cultural artefacts from which the designer draws inspiration.\n\nCreated for the likes of Beyonce, Björk, Cate Blanchett, Lady Gaga and Tilda Swinton, van Herpen’s sculptural silhouettes stem from a deep curiosity about the universe and a highly collaborative approach to haute couture. Her unconventional and dynamic approach to fabrics and techniques combines subtle hand-crafting with sophisticated technologies such as 3D printing to evoke the intricacy and diversity of the natural world, from marine biology to quantum physics.\n\nCurated by Cloé Pitiot and Louise Curtis from Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris, in collaboration with Nina Miall and Jacinta Giles from QAGOMA, ‘Iris van Herpen: Sculpting the Senses’ includes an evocation of the designer’s Amsterdam studio, revealing the stages of a dress in development, and a space dedicated to her fashion shows. The entire exhibition is accompanied by a soundscape by artist Salvador Breed.\n\nIn addition to van Herpen’s garments, footwear and headpieces, the exhibition features shadow projections by Canadian media artist Philip Beesley, an explosion drawing by Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang, astronomical photographs, documentary footage of blooms of phytoplankton and fungal networks by Yann Arthus Bertrand and Michael Pitiot, colourful photographic abstractions by Kim Keever, haunting sculptures by David Spriggs, a kinetic artwork featuring 300 gold seed pods by Casey Curran, and two immersive installations by the Japanese art collective Mé.\n\nEkka season\n\nKids 12 & Under free between 10-18 Aug\n\nTeens Festival\n\nOn Sat 17 Aug, join us for a day of art, music and creativity for teens. Purchase 2-for-1 Youth exhibition tickets. GOMA is open to all visitors during the Teens Festival. See a full list of events.\n\nBuy timed tickets in advance to guarantee entry. Last session 4.00pm daily. Exhibition closes at 5.00pm. No pass outs for timed-entry tickets.\n\nExhibition co-organised by the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris and QAGOMA, Brisbane, based on an original exhibition designed by the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris."
