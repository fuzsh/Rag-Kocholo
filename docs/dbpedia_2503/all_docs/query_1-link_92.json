        "text": "Karla Bonoff, Friday, August 23, 2024\n\nThe Regent Theatre, 7 Medford St, Arlington, MA 02474\n\nFOR TICKETS, CLICK HERE\n\nKarla Bonoff has been described as one of the finest singer/songwriters of her generation. That description is not hyperbole. Bonoff has enjoyed critical acclaim, commercial success, enduring popularity, and the unwavering respect of her peers. Karla has seen her songs become hits for Bonnie Raitt, Wynonna Judd, and Linda Ronstadt. Many of Bonoff’s ballads are classics. Karla has continued to record and tour extensively, playing sold-out shows worldwide.\n\nHearing Karla’s moving vocals on her rich, expressive songs is like standing beneath a sparkling waterfall–refreshing, exhilarating, and restorative. Experiencing them live can be transformative. Fans and critics agree that Bonoff’s songs, as are her recordings, are timeless. Many prefer her versions, live with instrumentation that is clean and spare, giving Bonoff’s voice room to work its emotional magic.\n\n“Long before Alanis and Jewel, there was a breed of singer/songwriters whose earthly anthems of soul-searching, heartache and joy touched souls in a way few can muster today. Billboard Magazine.\n\nPlaying along, Karla will be an extraordinary guest, guitarist Nina Gerber.\n\nKarla says, “Nina has this uncanny ability to weave an emotional tapestry throughout a song…never getting in the way of the song, but adding this incredible depth to it…Sometimes, I am just amazed at what I hear coming from her side of the stage.”"
