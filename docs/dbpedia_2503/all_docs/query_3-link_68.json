        "text": "Conor Oberst keeps getting interrupted by his two dogs. “They’re obnoxious,” he says, laughing, before addressing them directly. “Are you guys for real?” Speaking from his home in Omaha, Nebraska, Oberst frequently shifts his attention toward Lola, a mixed breed terrier, and Schatzi, a German Shepherd Lab mix. As they bark and chase each other around the room, he occasionally pauses mid-sentence to admire them at play. “They’re the exact same color, so when they run around it’s pretty cute,” he admits. “It’s like a Mini-Me situation.”\n\nIt’s an intimate glimpse into the unexpectedly domestic rollout for Down in the Weeds, Where the World Once Was, the first Bright Eyes album in nine years. Oberst’s primary recording project—now a trio with long-time collaborators Nate Walcott and Mike Mogis—was due for a full-blown comeback this year, with tour dates planned and videos to shoot. Instead, he’s back in his hometown, where he first put his angsty, acoustic songs to tape in the ’90s, where he helped found Saddle Creek Records with his brother and a group of friends, where he established his roots as an indie lifer.\n\nWhile Oberst’s mood may be at ease, Down in the Weeds is characteristically intense: a dramatic opus ranging from blown-out folk to gothy singalongs and atmospheric sound collages. “I think it sounds like our band, just hopefully a little more… like that nice vintage wine, it gets better with time.” The album’s themes of solitude and apocalyptic unease suit life in 2020. “Bright Eyes have been on the doomsday tip for a long time,” he adds. “The timing is finally right.”\n\nCyndi Lauper: “Time After Time”\n\nWhen I was a kid in the ’80s, Cyndi Lauper was involved with the World Wrestling Federation. She was on this cartoon with Hulk Hogan, and she was dressed all cool, with weird rubber bands and crazy hair. But there’s such a sadness to this song. I remember hearing it on the radio and loving it. As an adult, I got really into [her album She’s So Unusual]. It’s got all her hits, and that really amazing cover of Prince’s “When You Were Mine.” Desaparecidos tried to cover the first song, “Money Changes Everything,” but it failed miserably. As it turns out my voice doesn’t quite match up with hers.\n\nBut I do have a funny story about Cyndi Lauper. It was 2007, on the Cassadaga tour. We played Summer Sonic, the big festival in Japan, and we were on the same stage. Very weird bill. But I got to watch her play and she was amazing—and then our show was a complete trainwreck. Literally everything was going so bad that we ended up canceling that whole leg of the tour. All the bands went to the airport that night because we had to fly to the next show. I’m in my dirty white suit, so pissed and sad, just feeling like a failure. And then, you know when you get that sense that someone just sat down next to you? I turn, and it’s Cyndi Lauper. She’s got green hair and she’s talking in her crazy New York accent. She basically gave me this sweet pep talk, like, “Conor, growin’ old sucks.” She said it like it is. Growing old does suck.\n\nThe Replacements: “Here Comes a Regular”\n\nI had two older brothers: Matty, who’s no longer with us, and Justin. Matty was six and a half years older than me, and all his friends were fanatics about music. I’d sneak up to his room and steal his cassette tapes. All that came from him. The Replacements were his favorite band of all time, but that song in particular was special. It’s a really simple song, so when I was learning guitar, he showed me how to play it; it seems like a crazy song for a 10-year-old to play but it’s just three chords. When he passed away in 2016, I sang it at the first show I played afterward, at this church in L.A. It felt like the right thing to do.\n\nBy the time I was 12, I was writing my own original songs. This guy Ted Stevens, who was in Lullaby for the Working Class and Cursive, used to practice next door. I’d sit on the porch and play, and he was just fascinated that I was making up songs when I was so little. So he brought his Tascam 4-track over and recorded my quote-unquote first album, which was called Water. That came out in 1993, when I was 13. That’s when I started playing local shows and selling my tape at the one cool local record store. At the time [our label] was called Lumberjack Records, but we found out there was another Lumberjack Records, so it turned into Saddle Creek. We were always sharing our songs and encouraging each other. For that reason, I started a band when I was 14 and signed a record deal. By the time I was 15, I was going to SXSW and shit. Everything was hyper-speed. I had this older group of people who were cheering me on. That goes a long way for a little kid who doesn’t know what the fuck they’re doing.\n\nDave passed away, and the store is gone now. But he was very generous in the sense that he would let kids hang out there all day and talk shit about music. I became really good friends with him and [songwriter] Simon Joyner, who would work there on occasion. At that point, I had started writing more in the zone of folk-type stuff. I was getting a little more evolved in my interests. One day, they were like, “You ever heard of Townes Van Zandt? I think you’re gonna like it.” For better or worse, it totally changed my life.\n\nI think everybody is a combination of their influences, but Townes is the deep, dark part that I carry around. It’s like there’s no anesthetic. It’s just straight to your heart, some of the most beautiful but painful feelings a person can have. His best friend Guy Clark said something to the effect of, “Everyone wants to write and sing like Townes, but no one should want to be like Townes.” And that’s coming from his best friend! I got really into Elliott Smith around that same period. When you’re young, it’s easy to romanticize the tortured artist kinda thing. I absolutely fell for it.\n\nThe Faint: Blank-Wave Arcade\n\nIt gets misrepresented in the press that I was in the Faint. I was never in the Faint. I was in this band Norman Bailer, which was the precursor to the Faint. We were starting to fuck around with keyboards, but we were basically indie rock. Once the Faint guys made Blank-Wave Arcade, they were fully on another fucking level. All of a sudden, their little cardigan sweaters were gone and they were dressed in cool shit. They would set up their own lights in the littlest spaces, so even at a house show, you’d feel like you were at a stadium. They totally transformed.\n\nI still think there are so many bands that owe so much to them. I’ve talked to Brandon Flowers, who has said as much about the Killers. They were just a few years ahead of their time. And they did get offered an insane major label record deal that they said no to—which I think they all regret now, because [drummer] Clark [Baechle]’s bartending and [frontman] Todd [Fink] is, like, making hats, you know? But if they would have done it at the right time, they would have been the hugest fucking band. I don’t know what real justice there is. I mean, there isn’t any in the music industry.\n\nIt was always the three of us: the Faint, Bright Eyes, and Cursive. We were all best friends. We made Saddle Creek together, and we made this blood pact that we were going to stay together come hell or high water. Eventually stuff fell apart. One of our friends ended up with control of the whole label, and it was no longer a communal thing, which was the whole idea. Once that started getting frayed, people started making different decisions for themselves. But at the time, we really believed in it. We all passed up a lot of opportunities and a lot of money. We were idolizing Dischord and Merge and wanted to be like those guys. We wanted to stick it to the man and do our own thing and conquer the world. We had a lot of big ideas. But you know, whatever. Some of them worked out. Some of them didn’t.\n\nIn high school we would listen to Wu-Tang Clan, and I always thought the skits and in-between things were cool—that was something we stole from hip-hop and tried to put into our records. And we’ve been influenced on a drumming level from hip-hop too. If you listen to songs like “Lover I Don’t Have to Love” and “Down in a Rabbit Hole,” they’re being played by a drummer, but they’re basically hip-hop beats. But what’s so impressive to me about hip-hop is how deeply centered it is on the poetry, which is exactly the way my favorite rock and folk music is. I’m always a sucker for somebody saying a bunch of things fast.\n\nThe Felice Brothers: “Wonderful Life”\n\nIf anybody puts a gun to my head and asks my favorite band, I always say the Felice Brothers. There’s this whole fucking billion-dollar musical elephant based off Americana music, and it’s so ridiculously transparent. I’ll just say it: Mumford and all that shit is so obviously fucking fake. I mean, they’re not even American. Get out of here! But the Felice Brothers are the real thing. They just walk out and embarrass every band trying to sound like that.\n\nIn terms of lyrics, Ian Felice is one of the people I’m completely in awe of. Bill Callahan’s another guy where, no matter what he’s doing, I want to hear his words. Not that it’s a contest, but everytime, I’m just like, “Damn it. Ian outshined me again.” There’s one verse in that song, it’s like [sings]:\n\nMe and Joey started a fire on the road just to watch it glow\n\nHis father didn’t like it much, gave Joey a black eye\n\nYou and me, we done the same damn thing\n\nFell in love, knowing the pain it would bring\n\nNow all I do is sing sad songs with red eyes\n\nI mean, get out of town! We also put that record out. After the shit with Saddle Creek started going south, my manager and I started this label Team Love. We put out the self-titled Felice Brothers record, and I think that’s the best thing I ever did for music, because that record is a true masterpiece.\n\nIn December 2010, I got married at the Cloisters, which is at the top of Manhattan. It was cold, but we had this tent. It was really sweet. Jim James sang us down the aisle, M. Ward sang us off the aisle, and the Felice Brothers played the reception. Our first dance was that song. It’s a beautiful memory: a snowy night in Manhattan, gettin’ married with the Felice Brothers singing to you. Can’t really beat that.\n\nErik Satie: “Gymnopédie No. 1”\n\nEvery so often I get in this rut where I don’t want to hear music with words. I just want to relax. I love jazz music, and I’ve learned a good bit about it from Nate Walcott. So sometimes I’ll ask him to send me suggestions. I tend to gravitate toward piano players. I don’t even know how to pronounce its name, but this song is so beautiful. I don’t have any of Satie’s records so I just put on the essential playlist and let it roll. I’ve laid in bed on MDMA and listened to it—I highly recommend that.\n\nAround this time, I was on tour with Desaparecidos and I got sick. I got misdiagnosed and they thought there was something wrong with my brain. Long story short, I ended up back in Omaha in the middle of winter like, “What am I going to do with my life?” So I went down to this place called Keyboard Castle and I bought myself a nice piano. Back then, I wasn’t really in the sleeping game, so I would just stay up all night and play. I wrote [2016’s Ruminations] in a couple months because I wasn’t doing anything else. When I sent it to my label at the time, they were like, “Oh my god! Conor’s doing great! Look at all this music he just turned in!” I’m like, “Did anyone listen to the songs at all? It’s the most terrifying music!”\n\nPhoebe Bridgers: Punisher\n\nI had the good fortune of meeting her right when she was making [Stranger in the Alps]. I sang on that album and got really close to her. It’s hard to make a second record when your first is so well-received. I can relate to that pressure. Not that I have all the answers, but I can at least be a friend and give her advice. Sometimes she listens to me, sometimes she doesn’t—but that’s cool.\n\nShe totally knocked it out of the park [with Punisher]. I don’t think there’s any limit to her talent. She’s just so fucking real and such a hard worker. People can’t really fuck with her. She’s gonna do her thing and it’s gonna be awesome to witness. I just love her so much. There are very few people you meet in life that change you: I remember my life before I met her and after."
