        "text": "Date of birth: February 14\n\nI'm Mommy Nina's Daughter!\n\nMaverick Nina Dobrev has taken the celebrity pet world by storm! She is a Collie/Australian Shepherd Mix owned by none other than our vampire girl, Nina Dobrev herself. Maverick's favourite activities include going for walks, playing fetch, and, oh, the irresistible cuddles she gives! They are simply the best! With nearly half a million followers on social media, Maverick's bio reads that she is married to her mommy, Nina. This shows how unbreakable their bond is. In addition to her social media presence, Maverick also has a blog where she shares her thoughts on life, love, and everything in between. If you haven't already joined her loyal following, now is the perfect time!\n\nHow I Met My Mother\n\nHey there, folks! I'm Maverick, mommy Nina's best furry friend in the whole wide world! Do you know how I got my name? Well, Mommy named me after Tom Cruise's character, Maverick, from the movie Top Gun. Before I met Mommy, I was staying at The Pet Care Foundation, a special place in Los Angeles that helps animals find loving homes.\n\nBut let me tell you, the day Mommy brought me home was the absolute best day of my life! We've been inseparable ever since. Oh, and guess what? My birthday is on 14th February, Valentine's Day! It's a paw-some example of just how lovable I am, right?\n\nThere's a story of how we met. Mommy was feeling pretty sad after her kitty, Lynx, passed away. But now she says she's the happiest she's ever been. Isn't that amazing? Now, let me give you a sneak peek into our daily adventures together. When mommy's home, we go on long walks, snuggle up, and, oh boy, did she mention that I give the best cuddles!\n\nWe even have matching outfits sometimes, and she loves taking funny pictures of us. She then shares them on my Instagram account. Gosh, it's embarrassing! How am I supposed to impress the fellas if she keeps making me wear those silly outfits? Can someone please have a heart-to-heart with Mommy about that? Anyways, thanks for listening, pals! Woof woof!"
