        "text": "Before the 2015 film Oddball, Maremma Rescue Victoria had rehomed only two puppies, but following the film's success they have rehomed hundreds of young maremmas.\n\nJodie Cawood is the leader of the four-woman operation and has fostered 500 in her home alone.\n\n\"People just see something cute and grab it,\" Ms Cawood said.\n\nThe Italian sheepdogs were made famous by the film Oddball where an eccentric chicken farmer, played by Shane Jacobson, trains his mischievous maremma Oddball to protect a penguin sanctuary from fox attack.\n\nWhile it tried to inform people maremmas are not a suburban backyard dog, Ms Cawood said the film made things much worse.\n\nWith rescue groups in every state except Tasmania — many of which were formed after the film's release — the number of dogs rehomed since 2015 numbers in the hundreds and most likely in the thousands across states.\n\nThe 'Oddball effect'\n\nThe two dogs that acted in the film were supplied by Maremma Rescue Victoria and the RSPCA.\n\nMs Cawood worked with promoters to create additional material on the breed to present with any marketing of the film.\n\nThis included information like maremmas are loud dogs, they need something to protect, and should not be confined to the home without a role and purpose.\n\n\"Even though we gave people the right information, it still fell on deaf ears,\" Ms Cawood said.\n\nA rise in backyard breeders emerged, with farmers mass-producing maremmas to bring in quick cash.\n\nPuppies flogged for $500 on social media\n\nMs Cawood said unlike other family breeds that can have a hefty price tag and year-long waiting lists, maremma pups started popping up anywhere and everywhere.\n\nAnd people were buying them.\n\n\"So many of our dogs have come to us like that.\"\n\nLisa, who did not want her real name used, was looking for another dog in early 2019 after the loss of her family pet of 12 years.\n\nAfter a quick search online she was overwhelmed by affordable, cute maremma puppies with no waitlist.\n\nThey picked an Adelaide breeder they thought looked legitimate and paid a visit.\n\nShe was told maremmas \"don't even shed that much\" and are \"really easy to maintain\".\n\n\"He said that if we didn't make the decision — because he had other people coming to see Arlo as well — if we didn't adopt him right then and there we'd miss out.\"\n\nShe paid the breeder $650 and took eight-week-old Arlo home.\n\nNot suburban dogs\n\nLisa trained Arlo for nine months.\n\nShe went to puppy school and sought advice from other maremma owners on a SA Facebook forum.\n\nWhile she could deal with his bark, her neighbours could not.\n\nThey filed a formal complaint without her knowledge.\n\nWhen council imposed a Barking Dog Order because of the severity of the complaints last year she made the tough decision to part with Arlo.\n\nShe was sure Arlo, only entering his teenage years, would not lose his bark.\n\n\"If we didn't comply with any of the documentation, or his training wouldn't work out, we'd end up in court.\"\n\nWonderful workers in their element\n\nBo was the first maremma Liam Brokensha adopted from Maremma Rescue Victoria four years ago.\n\nThe grazier farmer in South Australia's south-east needed protection for his new chook fleet.\n\n\"That's possibly to do with what happened in her previous life before meeting us.\"\n\nShe was out with the chickens pretty soon after.\n\n\"It all seemed to come to her pretty naturally,\" Mr Brokensha said.\n\nMaggie, Hazel and Yoshi followed.\n\n\"We couldn't do it without them.\"\n\nRescue process a 'gut-wrenching' job\n\nRehoming these dogs can be a tough calling, especially when removing the maremmas.\n\n\"[One kid] told me I wasn't allowed to steal their dog and they were trying to hit me. It broke my heart,\" Ms Cawood said.\n\n\"We're just here to pick up the pieces for the dogs and try to make it as easy as possible when a family's falling apart.\"\n\nStill, it is a calling she cannot ignore.\n\nLast weekend she delivered a rescue to a family with autistic children.\n\n\"It's going to make the biggest difference to their lives,\" Ms Cawood said.\n\nStill members of the family\n\nWhen paired with something to protect, Ms Cawood said the maremmas can also adapt to happy family life.\n\nThe homes they seek out for adoption provide both a work life and a family life — just how they were raised for 2,000 years in Italy.\n\n\"They spend their first two years with their shepherd,\" Ms Cawood said.\n\n\"They sleep with him, they eat with him, they spend all their time with him and learning what their job is, before they go to work.\"\n\nThat has been the case for Dawn Cowley in the Adelaide Hills.\n\nThe Cowleys adopted their first maremma Gertie, from Maremma Rescue SA, six months ago.\n\nWhen facing a fox issue with their rescue chooks they looked for solutions.\n\nMs Cowley was lined up to buy a pup from a breeder when a friend suggested otherwise.\n\nMs Cowley was prepared for Gertie to be a predominantly outdoor dog but that has not been the case.\n\nGertie slotted into the home so well that the Cowleys decide to keep her within a week.\n\n\"[I didn't think] she'd end up being a part of the family and actually move quite easily between the two environments,\" Ms Cowley said.\n\nWant a maremma?\n\nMs Cawood said there are rescue organisations and good, registered breeders in every state except for Tasmania, which Victoria covers.\n\n\"We never have shortages of homes,\" she said.\n\nIt is a big job but one she is prepared to continue doing.\n\n\"I don't want the dogs to be displaced, so I do what I can to make sure families can either keep them or, if I think we're a better option, I'll do what I can to get that dog in.\"\n\nMs Cawood urges anyone considering the breed to do the research, provide the right environment and access the right breeders."
