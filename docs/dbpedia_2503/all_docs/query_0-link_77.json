        "text": "Interview with Xander Pratt\n\n“ I represent a New Africa, an Avant Garde Africa, one that does not seek acceptance, emulate indoctrinated influence or magnify mediocrity, rather one that is bold and unafraid to rattle the world with progressive ideas. “\n\nXander Pratt is a musician, dj, model and futurist who’s spent this quarantine period at the Source Hotel in Marrakech, preparing the launch of his album this summer Train To Marrakech, an album that infuses hip-hop with some touches of Middle Eastern sounds and Afro House. Originally from Ghana, Xander left home at 16 to study in Australia where he was discovered by photographer Peter Coulson. He’s been on quite the journey ever since and was recently named one of Africa’s leading Avant Gard Artists in a recent interview with CNN. we get raw and deep on our interview as this has been a time he’s used for introspection and in his words, “resound direction of my inner voice, understanding that not every idea is an ideal, and not every ideal, is a good idea.”\n\nWhat is one thing you feel is going to change the most for creatives moving forward with all that is going on?\n\nThe other day, during a deep and meaningful conversation with my mother, she mentioned that although the world is still, it does not mean the mind is. I realized that, with chaotic-calm, comes a rising tide of Renaissance, a shift in the paradigm of understanding which will in turn usher in bold forms of visual presentation.\n\nI believe art and creation in many forms will become less esoteric, as this world pandemic has shown us that although there are many nuances in humanity, we are a single organism that is capable of facing the same problem at once. This may either breed unity or promote further segregation, it is an artists role in this sense to ignite the former. Creatives are about to set the world on fire, in a progressive way.\n\nXander, share with us some personal mantras or wise words please.\n\nI have 5 messages that have resonated deeply within my spirit over the past few years, i have them tattooed on my left hand in Sanskrit. This is the first time i've shared this in an interview.\n\nSee The Illusion Of Time.\n\nOvercome The Fear Of Loss\n\nUnderstand The Order Of Chaos\n\nDuality Is Key\n\nArt Is The Door.\n\nWhat are some of the messages that you express with your music\n\nThere are no limits to expression and exploration, only those that are socially imposed on us. My music is a diary of my emotions, many memories live within the chords that create my compositions, moments of truth, fear, anger, love uncertainty and epiphanies.\n\nMy hope is for people to feel my journey through my music, while riding the wave of my experimental nature, knowing that we are not defined as one thing, sound holds the keys to unlocking all doors of unity and expression.\n\nXander I loved your interview on CNN I wanted to share this with our audience, your response to what it means to be African.\n\nI recently exhibited at the Marrakech 1-54 art fair, in this exhibition, i showcased 22 images that represented what i believe is the Essence of Africa. We are separated by light, colour, and perception. The Essence of Africa is the Essence of Being; the divine truth that connects all that is: a true journey through introspection. As the path to modernity continues, it is simple to lose harmony with the equilibrium.\n\nTo be African is to have a direct connection to the Source of all that is, and all that will be. The Africa i represent is not the Africa i grew up in. Africa is versatility, it is acceptance, it is unity, it is a whisper in the wind, of a message i have long heard, it is subtle yet unquestionable. To be African, is to be able to plant my heart into the soil, and allow it to grow into a generation of change. .\n\nFavorite websites social media handles?\n\n@motiondesigners\n\n@motiongraphics_collective"
