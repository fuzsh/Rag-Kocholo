        "text": "Bristol Trinity Centre – November 17th 2022\n\nOn her first tour in three years, Nina Nesbitt performed at The Trinity Centre in Bristol as part of her Älskar UK and EU tour.\n\nFirst discovering Nina on my ‘for you’ page on TikTok during the pandemic, I immediately followed her and have been a fan ever since. I was particularly drawn to her unique voice and how creative she is as a musician.\n\nAfter two supporting acts, Nina took to the stage and performed for over an hour and a half. I was in awe of how beautiful her voice is because it sounded just as stunning in real life as I’d heard on social media. The lighting at The Trinity Centre was phenomenal on the night, probably one of the best lighting conditions I’ve ever had at a gig.\n\nDuring the show, Nina often interacted with members of the crowd and, during one of these encounters, she mentioned a couple in the front row had travelled all the way from Cornwall to Bristol for the evening, purely to see Nina in concert. It must be a great feeling as a musician to hear your fans have travelled such distances just to see you perform. Looking around the lack of phones being held aloft was proof positive that people were very much lost in the moment, completely in awe of how beautiful Nina’s songs and voice are.\n\nIt was visibly noticeable that a lot of effort had gone into producing this tour and this was clear to see throughout Nina’s Bristol show. From the lighting to the sound, everything was so polished and it was an absolute pleasure to be at Nina’s show. I’m very happy I managed to catch her on this tour because the set list of songs was so pleasing to listen to that I bought a deluxe edition CD of Nina’s ‘Älskar Nights,’ which included some extra tracks she performed on the evening. If you ever get the chance, I definitely recommend checking out Nina the next time she’s in Bristol, as her talent, stage presence and personality are mesmerising to witness in person.\n\nDan Rose Photography"
