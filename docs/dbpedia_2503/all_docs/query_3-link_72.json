        "text": "Long gone are the days when traveling with your dog meant being forced to stay at roadside motels with stained carpets and questionable odors. Today, hotels at all price points are putting the \"friendly\" in pet-friendly by not only allowing dogs but pampering them as much as (if not even more than) their humans.\n\nAt the Bobby Hotel in Nashville and The St. Regis Aspen Resort, a resident pooch oversees the lobbies. At La Posada de Santa Fe in New Mexico and Baron's Cove in Sag Harbor, New York, pups are greeted with local treats and private, fenced-in outdoor spaces perfect for frolicking. At L'Auberge de Sedona in Arizona, they'll snooze by the fire in a plush dog bed before a day of sniffing around by the creek.\n\nMy golden retriever, Cali, spent much of her first few months of life hanging around the Travel + Leisure office, so when we set out on a cross-country road trip together, I decided it was time to put her to work. She may not be able to write a review, but if she could, I think she would agree with my conclusion that there are some key features that place the best dog-friendly hotels above the rest:\n\nProximity to parks and dog-friendly activities\n\nAccessible outdoor space — bonus points if it's enclosed and they can roam free\n\nAmenities that make them feel at home, be it a dog bed and water bowl or treats and a toy upon arrival\n\nA dog-friendly restaurant on site or nearby\n\nA bathtub (or better yet, an outdoor shower) for when adventuring gets messy\n\nA pet-loving staff\n\nCali tested (and, from what I can tell, highly approved of) many of the properties that made our list herself, and I learned that if you're lucky enough to have a dog who travels well, bringing him or her along can give your vacation a huge boost. Traveling with a pet gives you a built-in excuse to talk to the locals and to spend more time outdoors exploring by foot, and it guarantees you a more enthusiastic greeting — and cuter photos — everywhere you go.\n\nThis Tropical Island Is Filled With Puppies You Can Adopt\n\nNote that some hotels charge an additional fee or deposit, block off specific rooms for guests with pets, or offer pet packages seasonally, so it's always important to call ahead if you're checking in with a four-legged guest. Typically, hotels do not allow pets to be left unattended, so it's important to plan pet-friendly activities as well. If you are allowed to leave your pet in your hotel room unattended, consider bringing along a pet camera to keep tabs on your furry travel companion.\n\nBelow are Cali's (and my) picks for the best dog-friendly places to stay in the U.S.\n\nBaron’s Cove: Sag Harbor, NY\n\nAuthor John Steinbeck spent time at this cozy, waterfront Long Island retreat, and guests who purchase the Travels With Charley package will be given a copy of the novel he wrote about his own cross-country road trip with a French poodle, \"Travels with Charley: In Search of America,\" perfect for reading on your fenced-in front porch while your pup runs free. The package also comes with treats, a frisbee, a bed, and a daily dining credit for the humans. It's best to visit Baron's Cove with your dog in wintertime, when Sag Harbor is crowd-free and you can sit together by the fire with a glass of wine and some water, respectively, and look out at the silent harbor. South Fork beaches are generally dog-friendly all day long in winter, the closest being Havens Beach (they're not permitted on the beach from around Memorial Day to Labor Day) and Montauk Brewery is a fun dog-friendly stop half an hour east.\n\nTo book: caperesorts.com/barons-cove\n\nL’Auberge de Sedona: Sedona, AZ\n\nL'Auberge de Sedona's stunning grounds on Oak Creek, surrounded by Red Rock country, are a destination in their own right. The hotel provides dog beds, bowls, leashes, and a goodie bag with a toy, treats, clean-up bags, and a map of nearby walking trails. The spacious and private cottages have open-air showers, ideal for a rinse should your pet get dirty on the beach below.\n\nTo book: lauberge.com\n\nBobby Hotel: Nashville\n\nHairy, the Bobby Hotel dog-in-residence, greets guests in this super-stylish Nashville lobby and helps raise funds for the Nashville Humane Association. Rooms come with oversized balconies offering views that will keep curious pups entertained. You can even bring your pup to the patio at the in-house cafe where you can sip on a latte while getting in some good dog watching. Riverfront Park dog park is within walking distance, and so is Broadway, the city's main strip, filled with live music and an exuberant crowd of revelers who seriously love dogs. Before you leave be sure to check out the Bobby's rooftop lounge, where you'll sip cocktails in a retrofitted 1956 Scenicruiser bus.\n\nTo book: bobbyhotel.com\n\nDream Hollywood: Hollywood, CA\n\nThe Dream Hollywood team enthusiastically greets guests with canine travel companions, whether they're putting out a Dream-branded pet bed or helping to dress a pet in a luxurious miniature bathrobe for a ridiculously cute photo shoot. Hollywood's star-studded sights are all within walking distance, and you can admire the surrounding hilltop homes from your bed — or shower — thanks to plenty of floor-to-ceiling windows. The Hollywood sign is directly in view from the rooftop Highlight Room grill and bar, just beyond the cabana-lined pool.\n\nTo book: dreamhotels.com/hollywood\n\nLa Posada de Santa Fe, a Tribute Portfolio Resort & Spa: Santa Fe, NM\n\nJust steps from one of the best dog-friendly activities in town — browsing outdoor galleries along Canyon Road (although many artists will invite your furry art critic inside, as well) — La Posada de Santa Fe's desert-chic rooms have enclosed yards and well-manicured grounds for walking, handy waste bag stations included. Pets are greeted with Santa Fe-themed treats (pictured: a chili pepper chew toy), and are allowed at the colorful outdoor patio of popular New Mexican restaurant The Shed, within easy walking distance. A 10-minute drive will take you to Frank S. Ortiz Dog Park, a beautiful, 138-acre expanse of desert where your dog can roam free and you can enjoy sunset views overlooking the city. Check your pet for ticks after off-leash exploring.\n\nTo book: laposadadesantafe.com\n\nCyprus Inn: Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA\n\nLate Hollywood icon and animal activist Doris Day was a co-owner of Northern California's Cyprus Inn, and she reportedly agreed to purchase the 1929 Spanish-Moroccan landmark only if it allowed dogs. Today, the Cyprus Inn, which still embodies that Golden Age of Hollywood mystique, carries on her dog-loving legacy, offering blankets and bowls, a glamorous patio to hang out on, and an outdoor shower just for rinsing off those four sandy legs after a romp at the beach.\n\nTo book: cypress-inn.com\n\nMontage Palmetto Bluff: Bluffton, SC\n\nBetween Savannah, GA, and Hilton Head Island, SC, Montage Palmetto Bluff in Bluffton sits on 20,000 acres of fiercely preserved Lowcountry land, making it the perfect place to get outside with your pet.

Nearby restaurants aren't the most pet-friendly, but all the more reason to order in! You and your furry friend can enjoy room service, as the hotel has a full gourmet in-room dining menu just for pets.\n\nTo book: montagehotels.com/palmettobluff\n\nMandarin Oriental, Miami\n\nA peaceful retreat for owners of small dogs (25 pounds or less) on Brickell Key, the Mandarin Oriental is a slice of luxury with a quiet community feel.

While in town, be sure to hit Coronado Dog Beach, and if you're both up for an adventure, you can even take your dog paddleboarding with Aqua Adventures.
