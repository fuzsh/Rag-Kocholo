        "text": "Tanyalee Kahler\n\nTanyalee is a mum to three grown up kids, a wife to her childhood sweetheart, a full time graphic designer and a part time crafter/art journaler. She loves growing veggies to feed her family, she loves raising her fur babies (cats, rabbits and guinea pigs) and she loves spending her spare time just pottering around her house. Tanyalee LOVES being at home more than anything else – as long as her family is nearby.\n\nEssie Ruth\n\nEssie (she/her) is an artist and writer who works with a broad range of media to explore ideas of identity, family, love, grief, trauma, and social justice. Her writing and her visual art inform each other, and are in constant dialogue in her journals which hold a constantly fluctuating mix of story telling, reflection, catharsis, and imagination. She has one wife, one son, two cats, eighteen tattoos, and approximately two hundred rolls of washi tape.\n\nTorrie Gass\n\nTorrie’s deep belief is that every human on this planet is creative in their soul. We were made to design, create, paint, play, imagine and share our inner artist with the world. It’s just a matter of letting ourselves tap into that resource within us. There is an inner artist/crafter/plant arranger/advanced organizer just dying to be let out. It’s just a matter of taking the time to discover who that inner voice is, and what they’re trying to say.\n\nNina Christensen\n\nNina is a self-­employed graphic designer from Denmark. She’s always been way into paper, paint and crafts but totally neglected it during her teens and early twenties. When she had her daughter in 2010 Nina discovered scrapbooking and suddenly realized that inky hands and paper play isn’t just for kids.\n\nElizabeth D’Ascensao\n\nElizabeth lives in Boston with her husband, two young children and not-so-young French bulldog. She is passionate about encouraging others in their creative pursuits and building peaceful communities. She almost always laughs at her own jokes.\n\nKatie Smith\n\nKatie is an artist who enjoys experimenting with many mediums on journals and canvases, including markers, watercolors, mixed media, and oil paints. She learns as she paints and enjoys the process as much as the finished art.\n\nKatie’s paintings will transform you into another world through her personal style, vibrant colors, use of nature themes, and surreal, magical vibes.\n\nVanessa Oliver-Lloyd\n\nVanessa is a Canadian artist who lives abroad. This has lead her to explore art as a way of connecting and engaging with the world. She loves to share what she learns in classes that speak directly from the heart."
