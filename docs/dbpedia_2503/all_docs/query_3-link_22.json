        "text": "NINA\n\nBy Alex Teitz\n\nFEMMUSIC: Can you describe your songwriting technique?\n\nNina: A good retro synth line is always a good starting point. Melodies flow when the beat and feel is right. I also tend to collaborate when I write, I usually start with the lyrics and I write best when I’m in an extreme state of mind. People and situations inspire me but I seem to mostly write about love and escape.\n\nFEMMUSIC: What was the biggest challenge making My Mistake?\n\nNina: Choosing the right remixes was a challenge as we had lots of submissions, and they were all great, but we ended up deciding for Bright Light Bright Light and Big Black Delta. They’re both awesome musicians that I look up to and admire. Also, translating Dark Rider, the B side of the EP into a live acoustic session was a bit of a challenge. We adapted it to be performed completely on acoustic instruments (marimba, double bass, piano, percussion) in less than an hour.\n\nFEMMUSIC: What lessons did you learn from your previous releases that you applied in this release?\n\nNina: Always follow your gut instinct and be comfortable with the choices you make. I wanted to follow my heart 100% with this release and I had a very clear idea of the sound and look I wanted.\n\nFEMMUSIC: Tell me about Hunter as a Horse. How did you meet? What was it like working with them?\n\nNina: We met through a mutual friend and connected pretty much straight away. They are super talented and we share the same music references. They had a couple of cool beats, so we had a go at them and it worked out pretty well. It was all very organic.\n\nFEMMUSIC: How did you first get involved with Aztec Records? What benefits do they bring to your music? Any downsides?\n\nNina: They found me online and eventually we started working together in 2011. It’s a small label and they don’t have many signed artists, which means more focus on my project when needed. They supported me right from the start and guided me on my musical journey, which I’m grateful for. It’s been great so far, no downsides.\n\nFEMMUSIC: What are your goals and expectations for your USA tour?\n\nNina: I’m very excited to finally meet some of my American fans and to tour the US, and the plan is to come back again soon. I can’t wait to be sharing the stage with Erasure each night. I know I will have a great time, as everyone has been super friendly so far and the response has been great. I’m hoping to be able to play a few gigs in the West coast too, we’re working on it.\n\nFEMMUSIC: What one thing would you change about the music industry?\n\nNina: More support and opportunities for new talent.\n\nFEMMUSIC: As a woman in the music industry, have you been discriminated against?\n\nNina: Never directly, but I have heard the phrase ‘Sex sells’ way too often in my years in the industry.\n\nFEMMUSIC: If you could work or collaborate with anyone, who would it be & why?\n\nNina: David Grellier from College, as he’s a bloody awesome producer.\n\nFEMMUSIC: What advice would you have for an artist just starting out?\n\nNina: Always be yourself and have a clear vision of what kind of artist you want to be. Don’t rush things. Keep at it and don’t give up."
