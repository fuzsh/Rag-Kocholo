        "text": "Lead singer Nina Courson first ran away from her parents at 14 years old. She was picked up by some Parisian hoodlums who discovered her crying alone at the foot of the Sacre Coeur church in Paris. Luckily she managed to escape from these sordid gangsters and found help and refuge from a muslim transvestite called Mo Mo who she had met online. Mo Mo introduced her to the world of glamour and the music of David Bowie. Nina finally fled to London in 2007 while in her late teens to escape from a No Rock’n’Roll future in Paris. She found digs and a series of low paid jobs in Britain’s capital city. Managing to make the time to go and check out gigs whenever she could she eventually met London boy Phil Honey-Jones who was at the time the guitarist in Psychedelic Rock band HiroshAmour. Phil had left home, which was in the suburbs, in his teens as well, also leaving behind a dysfunctional past. They hit it off immediately and set out on a journey of their own seeking to find their place of solace in the world of music. They found it by forming the band Healthy Junkies, a perfect name for a band who has just released a new single called ‘No Control’ which is very much a reflection of the mental health epidemic currently spreading like wildfire through the very core of western society. The band name came about as a reaction and rebellion to the numbing and dumbing down of so many people with the use of pharmaceutical meds such as Prozac or fluoxetine.\n\nPhil and Nina managed to find a bass player and a drummer to complete their line-up in late 2010 and immediately set out on the road playing up and down the UK and in Europe. They met bands, promoters and music fans wherever they went all the time building up what has now become a dedicated and sizeable following. In 2018 they played a successful gig on the arena stage at the mighty Rebellion Punk Festival filling a room with a 1000 + capacity. During these years of constant gigging the band have supported such iconic punk bands as The UK Subs, GBH, The Rezillos, Theatre of Hate, Sham 69, The Professionals and The Damned. These bands have inspired Healthy Junkies in their writing and given the band a punk rock edge to mix with their grunge and psychedelic rock roots. The touring continues with Irish, European, UK and US tours booked for 2018.\n\nThe forthcoming US tour was really inspired by legendary L.A. radio DJ Rodney Bingenheimer (KROQ, Sirius XM) who has played the band regularly on his show and asked to meet Phil and Nina personally on their recent visit to the states. And with some air play from Brian Foss at KEXP Radio in Seattle the scene was set for a tour of the West Coast with the full band. On drums now is Adam Lewis (Formerly of HiroshAmour and Breed 77) and Dave Whitmore who they discovered while he was playing for a Nirvana tribute band. The tour coincides with the release of Healthy Junkies new album ‘Delirious Dream’ which will be available in October on Cargo Records.\n\nPhil and Nina also have been running their own monthly night in Camden, London for 6 years now. It is called Punk and Roll Rendezvous. The night has become so successful that they decided to host a 3 day festival in 2017 and also one in 2018 early in the summer. The criteria for the night is FREE entry and always with at least one band on the bill from outside London, sometimes abroad. They will be scouting for US bands to bring over to London to play their much sought after night. Punk and Roll Rendezvous and Healthy Junkies have one main goal and that is to bring people together. People from across the board who wish to express themselves and be themselves without prejudice. They mix Punk Rock with Grunge, Psychedelic Rock, New Wave, Garage Rock and Goth. Add a soupçon of theatre and you have Healthy Junkies.\n\nHealthy Junkies website"
