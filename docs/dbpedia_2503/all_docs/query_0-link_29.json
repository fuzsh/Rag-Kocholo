Brooklyn native and Parsons School of Design graduate Nina Valenti fuses classic with cutting edge and deconstructive with refined elegance to create an exciting new look. Blending natural and futuristic fabric with architectural designs, NVF is a new breed of organic futurism via clothing. It is functional, comfortable, and expertly tailored to fit the body.\n\nSwerve Coat, $598\n\nNatureVsFuture acknowledges the global environmental concerns and the importance of preserving and respecting the earth in the age of modernization.. Organic, sustainable, renewable, biodegradable, recycled and surplus materials are incorporated into each collection.\n\nAsymmetrical Cape and Hood, $328\n\nWe first met Nina Valenti at an independent designer market in Nolita. Her aesthetic is consistent and committed Nina has been a part of ID Pop Shop since our first event at Chelsea Market in 2011. We have seen her line develop and we are always excited to see the new designs.\n\nDouble Collar Sweater Jacket, $298\n\nDesigned in Dumbo, Brooklyn, and locally produced in the Garment District in New York City."
