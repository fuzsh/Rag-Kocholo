Nina is a smart and beautiful girl. She’s a 10 year old Siberian Husky who is compact at 35 pounds. Nina has lived with another dog and she is said to be friendly with other dogs as well. She’s lived with cats and kids and done well with both. Nina has loved watching and playing with kids outside.

She will stay in her kennel when you leave the house. When you are home and she is out and about, she will let you know when she needs to go outside to potty. She can manage stairs at this time.

Nina loves to run but spends most of her time lounging inside playing with a chew toy. She will play fetch and if her people can’t play with her, she’ll throw her toy up in the air for herself to catch! Nina is an accomplished escape artist so a good, solid fence of at least 5 feet tall will be necessary for her. She lived on a farm for most of her life and has no fear or understanding of the danger of cars. Nina must always be walked on leash for her own safety.

We are told Nina is an excellent notification dog. She will alert you if something is amiss by giving a bark once or twice. Once you acknowledge it, she’ll go back to whatever she was doing before. Nina has great self control at meal time; politely waiting with her own bowl of kibble until the humans have finished to see if they will drop a little something extra in her bowl. She does not beg. How many dogs will do that?

This girl has so much to offer her new people. She is waiting in Auburn, WA for an adopter.

This is not an ODH dog; we urge prospective adopters to do their own evaluation.
