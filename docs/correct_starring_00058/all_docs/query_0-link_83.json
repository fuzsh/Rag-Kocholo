        "text": "In observance of the fiftieth anniversary of the Beatles' pioneering rock movie, A Hard Day's Night (1964), I've reached into my archives for an academic paper I wrote about it for UCLA film school circa 1979--I couldn't just review the film, I had to analyze its cinematic style.\n\nThe professor and teaching assistant hated it and gave it a bad grade and wrote condescending negative comments all over it. I guess it wasn't full of enough Marxist-Freudian film-school terminology for them, or something. However, it represented my thoughts on the movie (as well as my development as a rock journalist) at that time."
