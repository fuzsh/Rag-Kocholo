        "text": "Four films about The Beatles are in the works - with each star getting a biopic to share their side of the story of the band that changed the world.\n\nThe project marks the first time Apple Corps Ltd and The Beatles - Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Ringo Starr, and the families of John Lennon and George Harrison - have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film.\n\nComing from each band member's point of view, the four theatrical feature films will intersect to tell \"the astonishing story of the greatest band in history\".\n\nBritish filmmaker Sam Mendes, known for the Oscar-winning American Beauty, as well as 1917 and James Bond film Skyfall, conceived the \"daring\" idea and will direct all four films.\n\n\"I'm honoured to be telling the story of the greatest rock band of all time, and excited to challenge the notion of what constitutes a trip to the movies,\" Mendes said in a statement.\n\nMendes will also produce the films alongside his Neal Street Productions partner Dame Pippa Harris and Neal Street's Julie Pastor.\n\nFour films, one story - 'the most celebrated band of all time'\n\nThe films will be financed and distributed worldwide by Sony Pictures, and will be released in cinemas in 2027.\n\nSony said information about the dating of the releases, which will be announced closer to the time, will be \"innovative and groundbreaking\".\n\n\"We intend this to be a uniquely thrilling, and epic cinematic experience: four films, told from four different perspectives, which tell a single story about the most celebrated band of all time,\" Dame Pippa said.\n\n\"To have The Beatles' and Apple Corps' blessing to do this is an immense privilege.\"\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\n\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\nTom Rothman, chairman and chief executive of Sony Pictures Entertainment's Motion Picture Group, added: \"I know I speak for our chief executive Tony Vinciquerra, who was instrumental in making this happen, and every Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group colleague around the world, when I say: 'Yeah, yeah, yeah!'\n\n\"Theatrical movie events today must be culturally seismic. Sam's daring, large-scale idea is that, and then some.\n\n\"Pairing his premier filmmaking team, with the music and the stories of four young men who changed the world, will rock audiences all over the globe.\n\n\"We are deeply grateful to all parties and look forward ourselves to breaking some rules with Sam's uniquely artistic vision.\""
