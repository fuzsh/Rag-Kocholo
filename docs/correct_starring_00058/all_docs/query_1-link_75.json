        "text": "Driving through Colorado during a road trip in early 1964, Bob Dylan heard a rundown of the countryâs Top 10 singles, more than half of which were by The Beatles. By then, the band had saturated America with the same bizarre speed theyâd saturated England, first broadcast on American radio about a week before Christmas 1963 by a Washington, D.C.-area DJ whose friendâa flight attendant for BOACâhad brought a copy of âI Want to Hold Your Handâ over in their luggage, essentially unplugging the last finger holding back a transatlantic flood. Whether or not Dylan liked the bandâs music was unclear. (Weâre talking about Bob Dylan here.) What he did acknowledge was that their soundâthe energy, the harmonic language, the combination of universally appealing but unprecedentedâwas somehow inevitable; that they pointed the direction of where music had to go. At the time, folkâDylanâs provinceâwas considered part of a vanguard; in jazz, composers like John Coltrane had already signaled a move toward abstraction; in visual art, pop had happily unseated the macho hugeness of abstract expressionism; independent filmmaking was developing a momentum. In other words, where other cultural avenues had taken new directions, pop music had mostly stayed the course. Released in summer 1964 (only a year and change after Please Please Me), A Hard Dayâs Night was arguably the first glimpse of our modern idea of The Beatles: safe but a little strange; warm but with shades of bleakness; a band that experimented tirelessly without ever leaving the mainstream. Famously, it was the first time that Lennon and McCartney had written all of the albumâs songs, a gesture that set the precedent for the then-new idea that pop (and, by extension, the musicians who made it) wasnât just a vehicle for a good show, but art that revealed some otherwise inexpressible part of the artistâs soulâsomething personal. The music was more evolved too. What had, on their first couple of albums, been borrowed from R&B and soul covers became baked into their own compositions: the workaday relief of the title track, the blues morality of âCanât Buy Me Loveâ (covered, almost immediately, by Ella Fitzgerald). Lennonâs âIâll Be Backâ was the moodiest song theyâd ever recorded, McCartneyâs âAnd I Love Herâ the most nakedly open-hearted, capturing a shadow-and-light quality that was warm but starkâcontrasts new not just for their songwriting, but for â60s pop in general. That the album had originally been conceived of as a soundtrack for a United Artists movie designed to capitalize on The Beatlesâ fame in England (Capitol had been famously reticent to release their albums in the United States) is an illustration of just how swiftly the machineâs gears were turning; that the band managed to make not only the album but also the movie as charming and sneakily creative as they did isâwell, you see where they got their good reputation."
