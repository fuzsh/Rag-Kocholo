        "text": "As previously announced, the original 1970 Let It Be movie has been restored and is set to release on Disney+ from May 8.\n\nAnd now the trailer for the film starring John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr has released showcasing stunning footage from the previously unavailable documentary.\n\nA caption read: “First released in May 1970 amidst the swirl of The Beatles’ breakup, Let It Be now takes its rightful place in the band’s history.\n\n“Once viewed through a darker lens, the film is now brought to light through its restoration and in the context of revelations brought forth in Peter Jackson’s multiple Emmy Award-winning docuseries, The Beatles: Get Back.\n\n“Released on Disney+ in 2021, the docuseries showcases the iconic foursome’s warmth and camaraderie, capturing a pivotal moment in music history.”\n\nThe announcement continued: “Let It Be contains footage not featured in the Get Back docuseries, bringing viewers into the studio and onto Apple Corps’ London rooftop in January 1969 as The Beatles, joined by Billy Preston, write and record their GRAMMY Award-winning album Let It Be, with its Academy Award-winning title song, and perform live for the final time as a group. With the release of The Beatles: Get Back fan clamour for the original Let It Be film reached a fever pitch.\n\n“With Lindsay-Hogg’s full support, Apple Corps asked Peter Jackson’s Park Road Post Production to dive into a meticulous restoration of the film from the original 16mm negative, which included lovingly remastering the sound using the same MAL de-mix technology that was applied to the Get Back docuseries.”\n\nLet It Be is streaming exclusively on Disney+ from May 8, 2024."
