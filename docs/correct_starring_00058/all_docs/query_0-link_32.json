        "text": "\"A larky and quaint Beatles fantasy\"- The Guardian ★★★★\n\nIn 1964 the biggest band on the planet made their big screen debut with A Hard Day s Night, a groundbreaking film that presented a typical day in the life of The Fab Four as they tried to outrun screaming fans, find Paul's mischievous grandfather, deal with a stressed TV producer and make it to the show on time. Directed with unrelenting verve by Richard Lester, whose innovative techniques paved the way for generations of music videos, the film's frenetic mix of comic escapades, legendary one-liners and pop perfection captured a moment in time that defined a generation. The most iconic band in music history had arrived."
