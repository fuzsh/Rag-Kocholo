        "text": "Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes is bringing Beatles fans four new things to get excited about! He announced that he is working on four new Beatles films, with each movie focusing on one of the members of the Fab Four including Paul McCartney, John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison. The films will share the story of what Mendes calls “the greatest rock band of all time,” showcasing each member’s perspective and personal story.\n\nThis is truly special as it is the first time the surviving Beatles members as well as the families of the late Lennon and Harrison have granted full life story and music rights for a film. Mendes is working with Apple Corps Ltd. which means the films will likely live on Apple TV+ once finished.\n\nMendes added that he is “excited to challenge the notion of what constitutes a trip to the movies,” with the new films. Of course, the Beatles have been subject to many documentaries and films in the past, but it sounds like the new films will be much more personal to their own journeys as individuals within the group.\n\nAll four films are expected to be released in 2027 and some fans are questioning why it won’t be just one or two films. For one, while the Beatles as a group’s rise to fame was a fascinating story, each member has their own unique and interesting history as well. For instance, Lennon had a very traumatic childhood, moving from family member to family member, and eventually was murdered in 1980. Fans can also choose to watch all films or just focus all in on their favorite Beatle.\n\nHaving four films may also mean four soundtracks and a way to discover new, restored music from the group. The members and their estates have agreed to use their music library for the movies, paving the way for tons of music in each movie. Likely, each film will use different music and could even have a different cinematic feel based on the personality of the member and their story.\n\nFor now, there is a lot of speculation on what may or may not be included in the films. We will keep you posted on any news until the release in a few years! Tell us, are you excited about four new Beatles movies? Which one are you anticipating the most?"
