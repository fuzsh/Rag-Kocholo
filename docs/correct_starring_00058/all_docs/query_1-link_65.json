        "text": "Description\n\nBeatles signatures from the set of their first feature film, A Hard Day's Night\n\nVintage autograph book, 6.25 x 4.25, signed inside on the same off-white page in ballpoint by the Beatles: “John Lennon,” “Paul McCartney,” “George Harrison,” and “Ringo Starr.” The book also contains a smattering of other British musicians, in addition to Hard Day's Night cast member Wilfrid Brambell. The covers of the album are worn and damaged, but the interior pages are fine, clean, and virtually flawless; it would be difficult to find a nicer set of uninscribed Beatles signatures!\n\nAccompanied by a letter of provenance from the son of the original recipient: “My Father, Leonard Davison (1911-1972) worked as an electrician at several UK film studios in the post-war years from 1947 through 1967. Some of the studios he worked at were Twickenham, Ealing and Denham studios. His responsibilities included creating/arranging the lighting on the movie sets. During this time, he met with some notable performers...of which the Beatles were among them. My Father first met the Beatles on the set of A Hard Day's Night in 1964 and that is where he was able to obtain the autograph of each Beatle, together with that of Wilfrid Brambell...The various autographs my Father obtained for me represent a small number of notable artists with whom he came in contact. To add validity to my above statement, enclosed is a...photograph of Shelley Winters with my Father crouched down with the spot/flood light. This photo may have been taken when Shelley Winters was filming Alfie in 1966.” The signed Winters photo is included.\n\nAuction Info\n\nAuction Title: Fine Autograph and Artifacts\n\nDates: #687 - Ended February 14, 2024\n\nThis item is Pre-Certified by Real\n\nBuy a third-party letter of authenticity for $500.00\n\n*This item has been pre-certified by a trusted third-party authentication service, and by placing a bid on this item, you agree to accept the opinion of this authentication service.
