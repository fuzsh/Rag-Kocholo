Sam’s daring, large-scale idea is that, and then some.\n\n\"Pairing his premier filmmaking team, with the music and the stories of four young men who changed the world, will rock audiences all over the globe.\n\n\"We are deeply grateful to all parties and look forward ourselves to breaking some rules with Sam’s uniquely artistic vision.\"\n\nThese four films, with each focussed on one member of the iconic band, will have interconnected stories which are told from each of the members' points of view.\n\nThis is the first time the remaining Beatles band members and the families of John Lennon and George Harrison along with Apple Corps Ltd, have granted their full life story and music rights for a scripted film.\n\nSpeaking about the announcement, Sam said: \"I’m honoured to be telling the story of the greatest rock band of all time, and excited to challenge the notion of what constitutes a trip to the movies.\"\n\nAs fans will know, The Beatles are music legends, known for their hits such as 'Yellow Submarine', 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds' and their recent hit 'Now And Then', which was their final release.\n\nMeanwhile, Sam Mendes is known for his directing work on films such as American Beauty, Jarhead and Skyfall.
