        "text": "I have good news for all you Beatlemaniacs out there. Apparently, Sony Pictures and director Sam Mendes have four (you read that correctly) Beatles movies in the works, and they’re rumored to feature a litany of stars. According to Jeff Sneider, the leading men are (drumroll, please) Harris Dickinson as John Lennon, Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney, Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr, and Charlie Rowe as George Harrison.\n\nBack in February, Sony Pictures announced that Sam Mendes is developing not one, not two, not three, but four (!) Beatles movies. Apparently, each film features a different band member’s point of view. Still, we should all take a breather. Until Sony officially confirms the casting news, we have to take the casting details with a grain of salt. However, if this is true, we have plenty to look forward to. Let’s discuss.\n\nWe’re particularly interested in the Barry Keoghan of it all. The 31-year-old actor typically goes for dark and brooding characters, like the bathwater-licking Oliver Quick in Saltburn and the tragically lonely Dominic in The Banshees of Inisherin. The Beatles films would really give Keoghan a chance to have some damn fun, emerging as a peace-sign-wielding rock star. The man is charming! Barry on the drums? Sign us up.\n\nSony has reportedly agreed to finance all four films, which will be directed and produced by Mendes and Pippa Harris. The living Beatles members, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr—along with the families of the late John Lennon and George Harrison—granted Mendes full rights to their life story and music. “I’m honored to be telling the story of the greatest rock band of all time and excited to challenge the notion of what constitutes a trip to the movies,” Mendes said.\n\nAre we looking at a future Beatle?\n\nWhat does that mean? The movies will likely intersect in a way we’ve rarely seen outside of a superhero flick. “We intend this to be a uniquely thrilling and epic cinematic experience,” said Mendes. “Four films, told from four different perspectives, which tell a single story about the most celebrated band of all time,” Harris added. “To have the Beatles’ and Apple Corps’ blessing to do this is an immense privilege. From our first meeting with Tom Rothman and Elizabeth Gabler, it was clear that they shared both our passion and ambition for this project, and we can’t think of a more perfect home than Sony Pictures.” The first film will have a global theatrical release sometime in 2027.\n\nHonestly, this film could premiere on the side of the road in 2032 and I’d still watch it. Who could resist Paul Mescartney?"
