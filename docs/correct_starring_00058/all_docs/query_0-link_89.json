        "text": "For this installment of Dusting ‘Em Off, we’re shifting away from our record shelves and, instead, consulting our film collection for a special screening of The Beatles’ first major motion-picture, A Hard Day’s Night. Fifty years ago today, Richard Lester’s black-and-white comedy premiered at London’s Pavilion Theatre, where it shattered records and grossed over $20,000 in its first week. In celebration, Justin Gerber, Dominick Mayer, Leah Pickett, and Henry Hauser examine the film’s influence and the many imitators that would come out singin’ years later.\n\nLeah Pickett (LP): I don’t know about you guys, but I had never seen A Hard Day’s Night all of the way through until recently. The opening scene is iconic — John, Paul, George and Ringo dashing through a train station as screaming hordes of female fans chase close behind — but the plot of the film is, well, less so. Only bits and pieces stand out: some ribbing of Paul’s oddball grandfather, George’s future wife Pattie Boyd being chatted up by Paul on the train, Ringo going missing before the concert.\n\nBut compared to the three other Beatlemania movies that followed (Help! in 1965, Magical Mystery Tour in 1967 and Yellow Submarine in 1968), A Hard Day’s Night has an especially earnest, straightforward charm that sets it apart. They’re so young, and so green! One gets the feeling that even in the midst of their exploding fame, these four still don’t quite understand what all of the hullaballoo is about.\n\nRelated Video\n\nWhat I also find intriguing about this film is the myriad of successors it launched in terms of pop band members playing themselves and embarking on various wacky adventures, including The Monkees, Spice World, S Club 7 in Miami (yes, I was a ’90s kid and admit to watching this show religiously — Linda Blair played the band’s landlord!). But A Hard Day’s Night was arguably the first big success of this genre, and, in my opinion, the best of the bunch.\n\nAnd I wonder, with this being the first film that The Beatles made together, did their “characters” more closely match their personalities than the films to follow? Or were they more manufactured, as the band was still firmly under the thumb of studio bigwigs at the time, and decidedly less experimental? Either way, I enjoyed the heck out of them. I found their frequent awkward laughter endearing.\n\nJustin Gerber (JG): I think their Beatle personas stayed the same throughout the rest of their films. There was the wily, unpredictable Lennon, likeable Paul, quiet George, and goofy Ringo. Although the least popular of the bunch (but really, is there an unpopular Beatle?), Ringo is easily the best actor. He steals every scene he’s in with his out-of-control dancing and, most notably, the iconic sequence of John, Paul, and George descending after a high jump during “Can’t Buy Me Love”, while little Richard Starkey can only manage a little leap off the ground. The film does a good job of showcasing him as the typical put-upon, insecure drummer, no thanks to Paul’s weird Grandpa John. The actor in that role (Wilfrid Brambell) was only 30 years older than McCartney at the time, but the math checks out, I suppose.\n\nThe older I get, the more I appreciate just how off-the-wall and non-mainstream A Hard Day’s Night really is. I agree, Leah, that their awkward laughter really sells how likeable they were. For instance, there’s Ringo’s unnatural laugh at his own joke in the train car, which is followed shortly thereafter by Lennon’s strange blinking at the stuffy man sitting beside him. I think The Beatles were hip enough to realize how ridiculous it was that they were starring in a major film and were just going to enjoy the ride- embracing the fact they were movie stars for the time being. This could have been another KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park, but fortunately the band had more than enough charisma and were deprecating enough to sell the ever-loving hell out of it.\n\nAs much fun as the movie is, does anyone else get a little sad at not only how young they all were, but how happy they all were? They were less than five years away from falling apart, and only we know it watching the movie decades later.\n\nHenry Hauser (HH): There’s no sadness in it for me, not even a bit. A Hard Day’s Night captures an unspoiled moment in time, when John, Paul, George, and Ringo were just a bunch of frenetic kids more tickled by their own celebrity than the old geezers shaking their heads back in Liverpool. Regardless of the tumult and tragedy that followed, from the quartet’s collapse, to Lennon’s devastating death, to the embarrassing McCartney-Mills saga that just about everyone except Paul saw coming, the film shines as a beacon of halcyon days and youthful exuberance.\n\nMost importantly, though, it’s really stood the test of time. I remember balancing on my dad’s lap when I was five years old, my baby brother wedged in the crook of his arm, watching A Hard Day’s Night on our Sanyo VCR and laughing so hard my ribs ached. I couldn’t get enough of those puckish black-and-white “teen-dangers” (I had a bit of a speech impediment) with the funny accents and shaggy haircuts running around acting silly. I made my dad play it for me again and again, until he finally had to teach me to operate the VCR so I could satiate my cravings for MopTop mayhem. Now I watch the film with my little cousins, and their giggly reaction takes me back two decades in a single heartbeat. Sure, they’re still more likely to load up their iPods with “Let It Go” than “Let it Be”, but it’s a start.\n\nAs the years go by, things get tend to complicated. But we’ll always have The Beatles, and Fab Four were never more joyous and free than in A Hard Day’s Night. What’s there to be sad about?\n\nDominick Mayer (DM): I’m in agreement with Henry on this one. Full disclosure: like Leah, I’d never actually watched the film all the way through until we sat down to discuss. But the film is effectively warmhearted and fun from start to finish, and if anything I think it’s buoyed by how goofy they’re willing to get for the sake of bringing the film to life. If we’re going to draw parallels to their latter-day selves, it’s just sort of heartening to see them not bogged down by the weight of being Important Global Artists, and for lack of a better phrase, just doing them. At least, doing them in the context of what’s basically a Marx Brothers update. Rather than being the standard concert film chronicling the band’s melodramas and preparations before the show, the show is turned into a lovely climax to a story full of physical comedy and slapstick.\n\nThat final scene is actually, I’d argue, the perfect way to handle the concert film. Even though it’s the closest thing to nonfiction in the entire film, other than perhaps the aforementioned off-cue giggling, it’s the most effervescent, honest moment at work. It treats a Beatles show with the same kind of transcendent weight that people who attended them did. Sure, you have the characteristic screaming girls (I actually lost it at the one young woman slowly crying Ringo’s name) and the mod-fashion sets, but it’s a perfect moment all the same in which these silly young men prove that together they were a truly special fixed moment in time. For as much as people frequently discuss the timelessness of the Beatles, it’s hard to imagine them existing in any other time than the one in which they did. It’s even harder to imagine a single band today making a film like A Hard Day’s Night without ridicule. It’s a completely sincere piece of work, in a way that’s a lot harder to pull off in an era of self-awareness.\n\nLP: True. It seems as though most “rock films” today are of the phony, 3-D moneybags sort, with garish feats of arena pageantry and pyrotechnics where a heart should be. For example, the Justin Bieber and Jonas Brothers movies didn’t give us much insight into the artists as people or even as musicians with, you know, a craft. They might as well have projected holograms onto the screen for all the realness we get from them. Even a film like Katy Perry’s Part of Me – made especially buzz-worthy upon its release with the teaser that we’d see Perry show a vulnerable side as her marriage dissolved in real time– still was, first and foremost, a promotional tool for her brand.\n\nAnd that’s part of what makes A Hard Day’s Night so special: it’s clearly promotional; but, in contrast to many of its successors, it’s neither exploitive nor ostentatious. As a viewer, I’m not just a spectator, ooh-ing and ahh-ing at icons blown up larger than life onscreen. In this film, I feel like I’m actually going along for the ride.\n\nMaybe it’s because I am so in love with The Beatles’ music (Bieber and Brothers Jonas? not so much), and so endeared to them individually and as a unit, that A Hard Day’s Night feels smaller and more humble to me. I agree with Dominick that the group doesn’t come across as aloof or self-important in the slightest. Any bits of cockiness, especially with the ladies, are always played for laughs. And as young guys just starting out, their palling around is sincere and contagious, with a refreshing lack of pretension.\n\nYes, there is somewhat of a story — will they make it to the show on time? — and they are playing scripted versions of themselves. But even in the frame of fiction, John, Paul, George and Ringo seem more natural and less affected than most rock stars portraying themselves in documentaries or “rockumentaries” today, don’t you think?\n\nJG: The Beatles were definitely not concerned with what people thought of them at the time. Granted, that’s entirely based on what I saw in a 90-minute film, but they don’t seem to be playing up that they were “important” rock stars, or give any reference that they thought they were “bigger than Jesus”. I’m surprised the studio didn’t see the dailies and demand that the Fab Four should take their performances more seriously, but their popularity was firmly established by album No. 3 so what damage could the film do? Studio heads must have seen that they were coming off quite harmless, especially compared to Paul’s “grandfather”. Sorry. I can’t get his creepiness out of my head (“I’ll bet you’re a great swimmer”).\n\nThe last movie of this ilk I can think of being produced is The Spice Girls’ vehicle Spice World, and before that Michael Jackson’s Moonwalker. These were artists playing themselves in a heightened reality, with their music popping up throughout. Leah mentioned the Bieber and Perry docudramas, and that sort of film seems to have taken precedence over any fictional releases, which is a shame. Are there any popular bands or solo artists out there that any one of you can imagine signing up for A Hard Day’s Night-esque movie, or is everyone too serious about their image/brand these days?\n\nHH: First off, allow me to part with some truth: Spice Girls’ “Wannabe” was the first CD Single I ever bought at Sam Goody (purchased simultaneously with Coolio’s “Gangsta’s Paradise”), and I begged my parents to let me see Spice World in theaters the following year.\n\nAs far as Justin’s query, I absolutely think there are contemporary bands out there that would sign up for a modern-day A Hard Day’s Night. An animated incarnation of Wilco was dancing around with Popeye, Olive Oyl, and Bluto in their music video for “Dawned On Me”, so it’s no great stretch to imagine them hamming it up like the Fab Four. I can also picture Mac DeMarco doing it, what with that whole puckish-rogue-slacker persona he likes to cultivate.\n\nWhile Justin is right on point in identifying Spice World and Moonwalker as the progenies of A Hard Day’s Night, I think everyone is forgetting the movie-music terrain from which A Hard Day’s Night sprouted. By the time A Hard Day’s Night hit theaters back in ’64, Elvis had already starred in more than a dozen feature films, most of which had The King playing himself.\n\nA Hard Day’s Night has a lot more in common with those early Elvis flicks than modern rock documentaries. The self-deprecating humor, paper-thin plotlines, and decrepitly telling insights into the burdens of fame and fortune are all there, just like Elvis’ “It Happened At The World’s Fair”. A Hard Day’s Night is a romping B-movie starring some budding pop stars from across the pond, with tinges of realism sewn in alongside slapstick, schmaltzy cultural references, and one hell of a soundtrack. It’s hardly a precursor to the modern rock-umentary. Could anyone really argue otherwise?\n\nDM: I’d agree on that, to an extent. I do think it’s important to remember that Elvis had also done it, but those were more built to play up a.) Elvis’ overwhelmingly controversial sensuality and b.) how much of a rockstar he was, and again, how desirable he was therein. Those were structured more in the style of the Rock Hudson-Doris Day vehicles of the time, and as such lacked a little bit of the earnestness we’ve talked so much about over the course of this discussion. Though as Leah noted, the Beatles were still pushing their brand in their own fashion with A Hard Day’s Night, they were also introducing themselves as far more multifaceted. Even the ways you choose to build your personal brand suggest certain things about you, at the end of the day.\n\nWhere I do agree with Henry is regarding the film’s influence. We’ve already touched on acts like The Monkees, who simply put wouldn’t have existed if The Beatles hadn’t created a market for the fictional film promoting a real-life touring and recording act, though their brand was far more tied to the performance than to their music in and of itself. But if you even think about recent films like the ones previously mentioned, even if selling the wares of far inferior artists, they’re all structured around this conceit of illustrating how interesting and deftly funny and candid and all-around interesting their subjects are. A Hard Day’s Night convinced people that the Beatles could pretty much do everything, and that’s a standard to which other rockumentaries aspire to this day.\n\nThis is a ridiculous example (and a doubly ridiculous film), but I think of the Metallica IMAX vehicle Through The Never from last year. That’s a film full of concert footage for the most part, but it’s also structured around this weird framing device where Dane DeHaan has to find them the briefcase from Pulp Fiction, essentially. And in some way, something even as silly as that would tie back to A Hard Day’s Night, for without it the idea of the real-fictional doc may never have come to be, particularly as prominently as it has.\n\nThe Beatles created a space in pop culture where artists can exist as three people simultaneously: musical performer, hyper-stylized version of real person as sold to the public, and their actual selves in a distant third to the former. That’s become a big part of how we understand pop music now, and you could pretty easily argue that the Fab Four had a hand in it for sure.\n\nLP: To Dominick and Henry’s points, I think that watching one big headliner playing himself in a film or series of films (as we’ve seen with Elvis and Michael Jackson) is entirely different than watching a group, in which the members’ dynamics as a team are just as important as their individual personalities. A Hard Day’s Night would not have worked without the chemistry that these four had, and their multi-faceted presentation as artists, celebrities and “actual selves,” as Dominick mentioned.\n\nThe Fab Four were bonafide rock stars when they made A Hard Day’s Night, absolutely. But because of the intimacy and accessibility of this first film in particular, one can’t help but walk away with the feeling that these charming blokes could have been your friends, too.\n\nJG: I can think of bands that would be up to the challenge of making a A Hard Day’s Night­-type film, but I struggle to name a band with distinct personalities within the unit that could pull it off. That’s where The Beatles have always had the advantage. They were The Fab Four, and no one could match their personalities on film, or really even on record.\n\nFor me, A Hard Day’s Night is a time capsule for that entire British Invasion, mop-top era. When our extra-terrestrial brothers and sisters come to Earth one day (and they will find us…) requesting information on music from the ’60s, the people behind the music, the audience reception, and the crazy fame, they need look no further than this film. If anyone gives them the Magical Mystery Tour film, we’ll be doomed.\n\nHH: A Hard Day’s Night was a big one for me. Over the years, it provided the backdrop to some great Hauser family memories, plus plenty of laughs and giggles. Now that it’s being rereleased by Janus with a digitally remastered soundtrack, I plan on doing everything possible to see it in theaters this week. As it turns out, the Castro theatre in San Francisco is screening it just a few blocks from my apartment. Sounds like a nice reward after “working like a dog” at the old 9-5."
