        "text": "Sam Mendes (1914, Skyfall) is currently developing a massive four-part biopic for The Beatles, one film for each member of the band, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison.\n\nThe movie is said to \"tell the astonishing story of the greatest band in history,\" and now a report has surfaced regarding the possible cast of the film.\n\nAccording to The InSneider, Sony Pictures has cast Harris Dickinson (Triangle of Sadness) as John Lennon, Paul Mescal (Aftersun) as Paul McCartney, Barry Keoghan (The Banshees of Inisherin) as Ringo Starr, and Charlie Rowe (Slow Horses) as George Harrison.\n\nThis seems like a solid cast to take on these roles, but they have not been confirmed.\n\nSony Pictures Entertainment, Neal Street Pictures, and Apple Corps are producing the films, and this is the first time that Apple, who handles the Beatles' rights, has ever granted life story and music rights for a scripted feature film, let alone an entire series.\n\nMendes previously said in a statement: \"I'm honored to be telling the story of the greatest rock band of all time, and excited to challenge the notion of what constitutes a trip to the movies.”\n\nSony Pictures Entertainment said: \"The dating cadence of the films, the details of which will be shared closer to release, will be innovative and groundbreaking.\" I imagine the four films will be shot all at the same time, which will be a massive undertaking.\n\nPippa Harris shared in a statement: “We intend this to be a uniquely thrilling, and epic cinematic experience: four films, told from four different perspectives which tell a single story about the most celebrated band of all time.\n\n“To have The Beatles' and Apple Corps' blessing to do this is an immense privilege. From our first meeting with Tom Rothman and Elizabeth Gabler, it was clear that they shared both our passion and ambition for this project, and we can't think of a more perfect home than Sony Pictures.\"\n\nApple Corps Ltd. CEO Jeff Jones added: \"Apple Corps is delighted to collaborate with Sam, Pippa and Julie to explore each Beatle's unique story and to bring them together in a suitably captivating and innovative way. Sony Pictures' enthusiastic support, championing the project's scope and creative vision from the start, has been invaluable for all of us.\"\n\nTom Rothman, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures' Motion Picture Group said: \"I know I speak for our CEO Tony Vinciquerra, who was instrumental in making this happen, and every Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group colleague around the world when I say: 'yeah, yeah, yeah!'\n\n“Theatrical movie events today must be culturally seismic. Sam's daring, large-scale idea is that and then some. Pairing his premiere filmmaking team, with the music and the stories of four young men who changed the world, will rock audiences all over the globe.\n\n“We are deeply grateful to all parties and look forward ourselves to breaking some rules with Sam's uniquely artistic vision.\"\n\nAs a longtime fan of The Beatles, I’m looking forward to seeing how Mendes tells the story of these characters."
