Himesh Patel stars as struggling musician Jack Malik, who suddenly finds himself as the only person who remembers the Beatles and becomes famous for performing their songs. The film also stars Lily James, Joel Fry, Ed Sheeran, and Kate McKinnon.\n\nYesterday was announced in March 2018. Filming began the following month around England, particularly Norfolk and Halesworth in Suffolk. Photography also took place at Wembley Stadium, the Principality Stadium, and in Los Angeles. The filmmakers paid $10 million for the rights to use the Beatles' music. Although none of the band members were involved, Boyle received approval for the project from them or their families.\n\nYesterday had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in May 2019, and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States in June 2019, by Universal Pictures. The film grossed $153 million worldwide against a production budget of $26 million. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the premise, performances, and musical sequences but criticism for its familiarity and not exploring the concept further.\n\nPlot[edit]\n\nJack Malik is a struggling singer-songwriter from Lowestoft who plays gigs to tiny audiences. His manager and childhood friend Ellie Appleton encourages him not to give up on his dreams. Jack is hit by a bus during a 12-second global power failure. After recovering, he sings the Beatles song \"Yesterday\" for his friends and discovers that they have never heard of the Beatles.\n\nJack searches for the Beatles on the Internet but finds nothing, then he discovers the band's records missing from his collection, and he realizes that he is now living in a world where the group never formed. He begins performing Beatles songs, passing them off as his own.\n\nEllie has Jack record a demo with Gavin, a local music producer. Following a performance on local television, Jack is invited by pop star Ed Sheeran to play as his opening act in Moscow. Ellie is a mathematics teacher who has a parent's evening scheduled, and she declines to join him, so Jack's friend Rocky travels with him instead. After the gig, Sheeran challenges Jack to a songwriting duel; Jack plays \"The Long and Winding Road\", and Sheeran graciously accepts defeat.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Sheeran's ruthless manager Debra Hammer signs Jack to her label and engineers his rise to global fame. Ellie confesses that she has always been in love with him at his going-away party prior to moving to Los Angeles. Jack starts recording an album at EastWest Studios, but he cannot remember the lyrics for \"Eleanor Rigby\". Hoping to trigger memories, he goes to the Beatles' hometown of Liverpool, visiting landmarks such as Strawberry Field, Penny Lane, and the grave of Eleanor Rigby.\n\nEllie joins Jack in Liverpool, and they share a drunken evening and kiss, but she tells him that she is not interested in a one-night stand. The next morning, Jack and Rocky pursue Ellie to the train station, where she congratulates Jack but tells him that she cannot be a part of his celebrity life. He returns to Los Angeles heartbroken and desperate to have an everyday life again, while Ellie begins dating Gavin.\n\nThe record label prepares to launch Jack's debut album, but they reject his title ideas—taken from Beatles albums—and names it One Man Only, pushing his talent. Jack persuades them to launch the album with a rooftop concert in Gorleston-on-Sea.\n\nTwo people who also recall the Beatles approach him backstage. They tell him that they know that he did not write the songs, but thank him, having feared that the Beatles' music was gone forever. They give him the address of John Lennon, who never formed the Beatles in this reality and has lived a long, happy life with his wife out of the public spotlight. Jack then visits John, who advises him to pursue the one he loves and always tell the truth.\n\nJack calls in a favour with Sheeran, who arranges for him to perform at Wembley Stadium. Jack confesses to the crowd that he plagiarized the music and that he loves Ellie, and he has Rocky upload the songs free on the internet, sabotaging the record release and enraging Debra. Jack and Ellie return to her home and finally make love. In the morning, Jack equates his feelings for Ellie with how Harry Potter must have felt when he defeated Lord Voldemort, but Ellie has no idea who he is talking about, much to Jack's chagrin. They decide to start a family, and Jack gives up stardom to become a music teacher.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nIn addition, James Corden and Michael Kiwanuka appear as themselves, and Robert Carlyle makes an uncredited appearance as a 78-year-old contented John Lennon.[1]\n\nProduction[edit]\n\nYesterday was produced by Perfect World Pictures, Working Title Films, Decibel Films and Dentsu Inc.,[2] and distributed by Universal Pictures.[3]\n\nWriting[edit]\n\nYesterday began as a 2012 screenplay, Cover Version, by the American writer Jack Barth.[4] Barth had been struggling to sell screenplays for decades. He conceived the story when it occurred to him that if Star Wars had not been created and he conceived it, he would not be able to sell it.[4] In Barth's script, a \"meditation on professional disappointment\", Jack did not find success with the Beatles songs.[4]\n\nThe British actor Mackenzie Crook worked on an early version of the script, and intended to direct the film.[5] He left to work on his television series Detectorists.[6] The script was passed to the production company Working Title. Years later, while working on clearance rights for the Beatles songs, a Working Title producer mentioned the screenplay to the British filmmaker Richard Curtis, who bought it and rewrote it as a romantic comedy.[4] On Curtis's insistence,[4] the screenplay is credited to Curtis and the story credited to Curtis and Barth.[7]\n\nCurtis told interviewers he did not read Barth's script, preferring to use the premise to write his own version.[4] He told Den of Geek: \"I sometimes found when I worked with original material that it doesn't come from the heart. So I tried to write a whole film that meant something to me, rather than having too much extra information.\"[8] However, according to Barth, the final film includes many elements of his screenplay, including John Lennon as a wizened fisherman and a joke about Harry Potter.[4] Curtis credited the Harry Potter joke to a suggestion from the American comedian Sarah Silverman, who is thanked in the credits.[4]\n\nBarth complained that Curtis had taken sole credit for the screenplay and damaged him financially.[4] He felt that Curtis had changed the story to make Jack a successful songwriter as a reflection of Curtis's own career: \"[Curtis] met Rowan Atkinson at Oxford, he came out of Oxford and immediately rode Rowan Atkinson to huge success in his early twenties. He's never been knocked out, as far as I know. Why wouldn't [Jack] become the most successful songwriter in the world?\"[4]\n\nCasting[edit]\n\nIn March 2018, it was announced that Curtis and director Danny Boyle were working on a musical comedy set in the 1960s or 1970s following \"a struggling musician who thinks he's the only person who can remember the Beatles\", with Himesh Patel cast in the lead role.[9] Boyle was convinced Patel was the right choice after listening to him perform the Beatles songs \"Yesterday\" and \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" during auditions.[10] Boyle felt that Patel's voice had soul.[11] Patel sang and performed guitar and piano himself.[12]\n\nLater in March 2018, Lily James and Kate McKinnon joined the cast.[13][14] Boyle informed the surviving members and widows of the Beatles about the film and received a reply he described as \"lovely\" from Beatles drummer Ringo Starr.[15] In April 2018, it was revealed that Ed Sheeran had joined the cast.[16][17] Sheeran's role was originally intended for the Coldplay singer Chris Martin, who turned it down.[11] Sheeran said Harry Styles was also asked, which Boyle denied.[18] Ana de Armas and Lamorne Morris joined later in April,[19][20] followed by Sophia Di Martino, Joel Fry and Harry Michell in May.[21]\n\nFilming[edit]\n\nFilming began on 21 April 2018,[22] with production in the United Kingdom starting on 26 April 2018, with scenes filmed across East Anglia in Cantley, Halesworth, Dunwich, Shingle Street, at the Latitude Festival, and at Clacton-on-Sea.[23] A casting call was issued for extras in overnight scenes shot immediately after Sheeran's four consecutive concerts at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales in May 2018.[24] A further 5,000 extras appeared in scenes at Gorleston-on-Sea Beach in Norfolk in June 2018.[25] Wembley Stadium was also used to film a concert scene.[15] Filming also took place in Liverpool, making use of Penny Lane, Liverpool John Lennon Airport, Lime Street Station and the Queensway Tunnel.[26]\n\nIn February 2019, it was announced that the title of the film was Yesterday.[27] It is estimated to have cost around $10 million to get the rights for the Beatles' songs to be featured in the film, with the rights to their music being held by Apple Records and Sony/ATV Music Publishing.[28] Scenes with de Armas, who played another love interest for Jack, were cut as test audiences felt it made Jack less sympathetic.[29] Ana de Armas appeared in some of the early promotional material before the final edit was made, which led to a $5m lawsuit in the US[30] when two fans claimed they were \"duped into renting the [$3.99] movie because she [de Armas] was in the trailer\".[31] U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson allowed the class-action lawsuit to proceed in December 2022, stating that \"At its core, a trailer is an advertisement designed to sell a movie by providing consumers with a preview of the movie.\"[32] Wilson later dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the \"injury is self-inflicted\" and thus no standing to sue.[33] The two men settled with Universal over court fees by April 2024.[34]\n\nMusic[edit]\n\nMain article: Yesterday (soundtrack)\n\nRelease[edit]\n\nThe first official trailer of the film was released on 12 February 2019.[35] The film had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on 4 May 2019.[36] A local screening of the film took place at the Gorleston Palace cinema on 21 June 2019.[37] Universal spent $75.4 million promoting the film worldwide.[38]\n\nReception[edit]\n\nBox office[edit]\n\nYesterday grossed $73.3 million domestically (United States and Canada) and $81.3 million in other territories (including $19.4 million in the United Kingdom),[39] for a worldwide total of $154.6 million, against a production budget of $26 million.[40] It spent its first five weeks in the Top 10 at the domestic box office.[41]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $10–15 million from 2,603 theatres in its opening weekend.[42] The film made $6.1 million on its first day, including $1.25 million from Thursday night previews. It ended up slightly exceeding projections and debuting to $17 million, finishing third behind Toy Story 4 and Annabelle Comes Home.[43] In its second weekend the film made $10.7 million, again finishing in third (behind Spider-Man: Far From Home and Toy Story 4),[44] then grossed $6.8 million in its third weekend, falling to fifth.[45]\n\nDeadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $45 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues and ignoring the UK tax credits on the production cost.[46] Universal officially took an $87.8 million loss on the film in 2019, which Deadline deduced would eventually result in a $26.5 million profit after TV and video sales (an estimated $78.4 million by early 2020) were taken into account.[38]\n\nCritical response[edit]\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 63% of 366 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Yesterday may fall short of fab, but the end result is still a sweetly charming fantasy with an intriguing—albeit somewhat under-explored—premise.\"[47] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 55 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[48] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.[49]\n\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film four out of five stars, writing \"although this film can be a bit hokey and uncertain on narrative development, the puppyish zest and fun summoned up by Curtis and Boyle carry it along.\"[50] Robbie Collin also responded positively in his review for The Daily Telegraph, saying the film \"rallies in style for a beautifully judged and surprisingly moving finale, which owes a lot to Patel and James's chemistry.\"[51] Owen Gleiberman of Variety, meanwhile, was less enthusiastic, claiming the film had little soul and calling it a \"rom-com wallpapered with the Beatles' greatness.\"[52] Laura Snapes of The Guardian called Yesterday \"the latest jukebox movie to put its women on mute.\"[53]\n\nBeatles' response[edit]\n\nPaul McCartney revealed in an interview with Billboard that he and his wife Nancy Shevell went to see the film in a cinema in The Hamptons and \"loved it\".[54] Boyle also sent copies of the completed film to Ringo Starr and his wife Barbara, as well as George Harrison's widow Olivia, and received \"lovely messages\" from both parties.[55] John Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, also approved of the film's depiction of her late husband.[56]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\nAward Date of ceremony Category Recipients Result Awards of the Japanese Academy 6 March 2020 Best Foreign Film Yesterday Nominated Blue Ribbon Awards 22 January 2020 Best Foreign Film Yesterday Nominated Golden Trailer Awards 29 June 2019 Best Music Universal Pictures and\n\nMotive NYC\n\nNominated Goya Awards 25 January 2020 Best European Film Yesterday – Danny Boyle Nominated Hollywood Music in Media Awards 9 November 2019 Outstanding Music Supervision – Film Angela Leus Nominated Best Soundtrack Album Yesterday Nominated Montclair Film Festival May 2019 World Cinema Danny Boyle Won Music City Film Critics' Association Awards 10 January 2020 Best Music Film Yesterday Nominated Toronto International Film Festival September 2019 People's Choice Award Favorite Comedy Movie Nominated San Diego Film Critics Society 9 December 2019 Best Use of Music in a Film Yesterday Nominated St. Louis Film Critics Association 15 December 2019 Best Soundtrack Yesterday Nominated Special Merit (for best scene, cinematic technique or other memorable aspect or moment) Jack visits cottage.

The 2010 Japanese manga I'm a Beatle (僕はビートルズ, Boku wa Bītoruzu) by Tetsuo Fujii and Kaiji Kawaguchi[59] involves an almost identical concept of a musician travelling back in time to 1961 and being surprised when he plays \"Yesterday\" and no one knows of the Beatles, and he similarly plays their material and is successful. Others include the 2011 French graphic novel Yesterday by David Blot and Jérémie Royer (the title, again, alluding to the Beatles song),[60][61][62] the 1990s British sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart,[63] the 2006 French film Jean-Philippe,[64][65] and Nick Milligan's 2013 novel Enormity.[66] Danny Boyle has said he was not aware of earlier works with similar premises when he read the script but had later become aware of a French film and British sitcom with a similar premise after the film's first trailer was revealed.[11]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nParallel universes in fiction\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
