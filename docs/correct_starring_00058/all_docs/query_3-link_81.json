        "text": "Filmmaker Sam Mendes is embarking on a unique cinematic adventure that promises to chronicle the formation and stratospheric rise of the world’s most iconic rock band, The Beatles.\n\nTold across four separate stories, Mendes plans to chronicle the lives of each individual Beatles band member with a different movie for Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, John Lennon and George Harrison. Sounds ambitious — but if anyone can do it, it’s the guy who gave us First World War epic 1917 and two of the most popular James Bond movies of recent years.\n\nHere’s everything we know about Mendes’ four-part Beatles project.\n\nWhen will Sam Mendes’ Beatles movies be released?\n\nMendes’ Beatles films are without release dates at the moment. But when the project was first announced back in February 2024, we learned that each film is set to debut in 2027.\n\nWhile details remain vague, Sony Pictures confirmed that each movie will land theatrically and that the timing of their arrival in theatres will be “innovative and groundbreaking.”\n\nAs to what exactly that entails — only time will tell.\n\nWhat will Sam Mendes’ Beatles movies be about?\n\nMendes’ Beatles movies will take audiences through the lives of each of the Beatles and show us how they came to cross paths and form a band that forever changed the trajectory of pop culture.\n\nThe project stands alone thanks to the fact that it has the full support and involvement of the band’s corporation Apple Corps Ltd. and The Beatles themselves, with McCartney and Starr granting their full life-story rights alongside the estates of Lennon and Harrison.\n\nSpeaking about the project, Mendes said: “I’m honoured to be telling the story of the greatest rock band of all time, and excited to challenge the notion of what constitutes a trip to the movies.”\n\nHis producing partner, Pippa Harris, added: “We intend this to be a uniquely thrilling, and epic cinematic experience: four films, told from four different perspectives which tell a single story about the most celebrated band of all time.\n\n“To have The Beatles’ and Apple Corps’ blessing to do this is an immense privilege. From our first meeting with Tom Rothman and Elizabeth Gabler, it was clear that they shared both our passion and ambition for this project, and we can’t think of a more perfect home than Sony Pictures.”\n\nLittle else about this lofty project has been confirmed since its initial reveal. However, many outlets have suggested that Mendes hopes to start shooting in mid-2025, giving himself a two-year window to deliver four bespoke movies ahead of their planned 2027 release year.\n\nWho will star in Sam Mendes’ Beatles movies?\n\nFollowing the news that Mendes plans to direct a movie for each member of The Beatles, the online movie rumour mill went into overdrive regarding actors who could fill the pointy boots of each musician.\n\nWhile nothing has been officially confirmed, early reports first shared by movie journalist Jeff Sneider in June 2024 provided the first four names to be linked to these iconic roles.\n\nAccording to Sneider, Mendes is looking at The Iron Claw’s Harris Dickinson for Lennon, Aftersun’s Paul Mescal as McCartney, Saltburn’s Barry Keoghan as Starr and Rocketman’s Charlie Rowe as Harrison.\n\nHowever, with an official announcement yet to be made — these names remain rumours for now."
