        "text": "Paul Mescal is rumored to be taking on the role of a Beatle in new biopics by Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes. The director is set to be at the helm of four different films, one dedicated to each member of The Beatles.\n\nAll films are slated to be released in 2027 and according to reports, Mendes is eyeing up Co Kildare native Paul Mescal for one of the roles. It has not been reported which of The Beatles he is set to play.\n\nThe four films have all been given the blessing of Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and the families of John Lennon and George Harrison. For the first time, The Beatles and their company Apple Corps have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film.\n\nDaisy Edgar-Jones 'fell in love' with Paul Mescal working on Normal People\n\nAyo Edebiri hints at rom-com with Paul Mescal on one particular condition\n\nA recent profile from The Hollywood Reporter, which highlighted ten young movie stars who are taking over the movie industry, reported that Mendes was eyeing up Mescal for one of the roles. Mescal has become a huge name in Hollywood since starring in 2020's Normal People alongside Daisy Edgar-Jones.\n\nSince then, he has gone on to become an Oscar nominee for his performance in 2022's Aftersun. He also blew critics away with his emotional performance in All of Us Strangers beside Andrew Scott.\n\nThere are some major projects in the pipeline for Mescal as he is set to star in the highly anticipated Gladiator sequel. The film is expected to do well at the box office when it is released later this year.\n\nFor all the latest news straight to your inbox, sign up for our FREE newsletters here.\n\nThe actor has also signed on for an impressive 20-year film project which will showcase his singing abilities, something audiences saw with his stand-out performance in Carmen. The Irish heartthrob is all geared up for his role in Merrily We Roll Along, the silver screen adaptation of the 1981 Stephen Sondheim musical, which itself was inspired by the 1934 play penned by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart.\n\nBut there's a bit of a wait for Mescal's fans eager to hear him croon, as Merrily We Roll Along won't hit the big screens until 2039."
