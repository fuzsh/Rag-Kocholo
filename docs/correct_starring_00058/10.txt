The Beatles require almost no introduction, it is hard to imagine a corner of the globe where their punchy sounds have not been heard in the almost 60 years they have achieved mainstream success. 'A Hard Day's Night' is many things, it is a musical comedy film starring the Beatles, it is a Beatles themed hotel in Liverpool, and an album containing the films soundtrack.

In 'A Hard Day's Night' the Beatles are able to escape a groups of fans mad with Beatlemania onboard a train bound for London and what better way to celebrate this film and its sound track than with this wonderfully decorated licenced wagon.
