The Samoan civil wars in the late 1800s were a series of conflicts between three rival Samoan chiefs - Malietoa Laupepa, Tupua Tamaese Titimaea, and Mata'afa Iosefo - struggling for power. Foreign intervention and colonial interests from Germany, America, and Britain exacerbated tensions and prolonged the wars. The conflicts ultimately resulted in the division of Samoa into Western Samoa under German control and American Samoa under U.S. control via the 1899 Tripartite Convention.
