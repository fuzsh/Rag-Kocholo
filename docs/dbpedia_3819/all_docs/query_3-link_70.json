        "text": "The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) serves a critical role in every phase of emergency management, from being the hub for all coordination during an incident to facilitating and directing recovery/clean-up. However, the EOC does not manage an incident — it coordinates.\n\nVarious situations will trigger the EOC’s opening, including emergencies that require resources beyond what local capabilities can handle; lengthy crisis situations; when major policy decisions will or might be needed; when a local or state emergency is declared; and when the EOC’s activation will be advantageous to successful management of an incident.\n\nThe Emergency Operations Center\n\nThe EOC is the centralized location of emergency response and recovery support operations during incidents. While tactical on-scene operations are conducted from the ICP, the EOC supports and helps coordinate ICP operations and any other adjacent incident operations.\n\nThe EOC utilizes ICS as the command-and-control structure. Within this structure, the EOC is organized into five sections to manage operations. These EOC sections include:\n\nManagement: Under the guidance of the EOC coordinator, this section has overall responsibility for the management and direction of all EOC activities including development, implementation and review of strategic decisions. Management directly coordinates with the EPG and ensures its strategic direction is implemented in EOC operations.\n\nOperations: This section represents on-scene emergency responders and provides coordination between the EOC and field operations, including the ICP.\n\nPlanning and Intelligence: This section is responsible for receiving, evaluating and analyzing all disaster information and providing updated status reports to EOC management and field operations. The planning and intelligence section is also responsible for damage assessment and developing specialized technical assessments of events.\n\nLogistics: Logistics is responsible for procuring supplies, personnel and material support necessary to conduct emergency responses (e.g. personnel call-out, equipment acquisition, lodging, transportation, food, etc.).\n\nFinance and Administration Section: The section handles cost accountability, purchase authorizations, documentation and risk assessment.\n\nIn order to manage the roles and responsibilities of each section, each EOC Section comprises specific functions called units and branches and is overseen by EOC section chiefs, who report directly to the EOC coordinator or the campus emergency director. Depending on the scope of an incident, some or all functions of a section may be activated.\n\nThe EOC Team\n\nThe EOC Team members are university personnel who staff the EOC during emergency response operations. The makeup of the EOC Team may depend on the specific incident and. In some cases the EOC Team will be pre-identified, while in other cases, potential EOC Team members will be requested to serve in the EOC.\n\nMultiple staff members may be identified to fill the same position so EOC Team members can rotate during prolonged incidents.\n\nExecutive Policy Group\n\nThe EPG comprises senior university administration members responsible for providing policy direction to incident command and setting broad priorities as they relate to responding to and recovering from emergency incidents. Additional responsibilities of the EPG include:\n\nWorking directly with the campus emergency director to determine when the EOC will be activated and when to demobilize;\n\nProviding updates and communicating with stakeholders, elected officials, the University of California Office of the President and regulatory agencies;\n\nConveying the chancellor’s priorities to the incident commander to help address the crisis;\n\nMaintaining situational awareness of the incident to include spillover effects;\n\nLiaising with city/county/regional leaders and affected interest groups;\n\nProviding policy-level decision making regarding fiscal, procurement, legal, academic and communications;\n\nCommunicating policy-level decisions to relevant department heads and staff members who are indirectly impacted by the incident; and\n\nProviding guidance on messaging to staff, students, affected groups and the broader community.\n\nDuring incidents, individual EPG members are responsible for coordinating their division’s response to the spillover effects of an incident. This effort must be coordinated with the EOC to avoid duplication of efforts and to effectively use the university’s limited resources. Spillover issues are those that the EOC does not have the capacity to address, may not rise to a level needing EOC attention or may be best addressed directly by a division for any number of reasons. The divisions represented within the EPG include:\n\nChancellor's Office\n\nAssociate Chancellor and Chief of Staff\n\nCampus Counsel\n\nEDI\n\nOffice of the Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor\n\nDivision of Physical Operations and Planning\n\nDivision of Student Affairs\n\nDivision of Finance and Administration\n\nDivision of Research\n\nDivision of External Relations\n\nEOC
