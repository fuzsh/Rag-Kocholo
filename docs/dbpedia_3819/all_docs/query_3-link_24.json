        "text": "The Stonewall Uprising that took place on June 28th, 1969, in New York City changed the lives and history for the LGBTQI+ community forever, the month of June is now nationally celebrated as Pride month in the United States. Pride month has become a yearly occasion to remember the movers and shakers of the LGBTQI+ movement, but also a time to celebrate being proud of who you are. Today, the celebration of Pride has rolled into mainstream media and celebration. Advertisements are everywhere, you can walk into a public place and there should easily be an entire section dedicated to Pride, even at home on major streaming services, the same trend follows. The advocacy and activism of those who fought for our individual representation and equality has come into deep fruition. To be able to live in and witness such times is humbling for a transgender woman like myself, but it also has me reflecting on my cultural identity as a fa’afafine and our own movement in history.\n\nThe arrival of the missionaries in Samoa (both American Samoa and Independent Samoa) completely suppressed and tried to erase (unsuccessfully) the existence of fa’afafine, which has made our specific history difficult to trace, much like all the other aspects of our culture that was deemed unimportant and barbaric by those very colonizers. There are very few writings and illustrations about fa’afafine prior to the 1970’s that exist today. In American Samoa, the fa’afafine movement only dates back to about forty-plus years. With the time frame being recent, trying to piece together a timeline has proven to be even more difficult than I imagined. American Samoa has no public archive available online and with a severe lack of funding and expertise, tracking any record has been nearly impossible.\n\nFor this project, I have had to rely solely on interviews and information provided from members of the fa’afafine community, both local and living on the U.S. mainland, to construct a timeline. I purposefully chose not to research anything pre-colonial and focused primarily on events and history makers in the last fifty-plus years. When I was teenager, I came across a book titled “Puputoa” by Fofo Sunia. it compiled one hundred years of history makers in American Samoa, but not one person profiled in the book was said to be fa’afafine. That realization gutted me, especially at a time when I was coming of age and wanted to learn about our fa’afafine history.\n\nFor the past thirty or so years, the representation of fa’afafine in writings and documentaries through the colonial, foreign, and tagata papa’e ‘aka’ palagi (white) lens has observed and exploited fa’afafine. Almost fetishizing and exoticizing our existence in modern day society. Their false ideologies of “boys raised as girls” became increasingly central to how the outside world has come to view the fa’afafine identity. One such problematic palagi anthropologist is Jeanette Mageo, whose writings and interviews were widely used as an educational introduction to fa’afafine in universities and their studies. The fa’afafine community has spent years denouncing such sexualized and primitive views as highly misleading and downright incorrect.\n\nI remember when I lived in Washington state, a palagi couple walked up to me while I was shopping and said, “hey we saw your kind on National Geographic” and without giving them any attention, I walked away. I knew exactly what they had watched. Some years ago, in Samoa I was approached by tagata papa’e filmmakers and was asked if they could film me making the ‘umu (traditional Samoan ‘oven’), they would have obviously used that image to tell the world that all fa’afafine prepared the ‘umu. These sorts of tropes have been the focus of representation of fa’afafine by outside observation. Never has the prioritization been about our historical events, influence and accomplishments. In an era where marginalized people and their accomplishments are being celebrated (and exploited) worldwide, it is long overdue that we fa’afafine reclaim and tell our true narrative.\n\nThe evolution of the fa’afafine movement in American Samoa began in the 1970’s, sadly a large majority of those who were a part of that group are no longer with us. The oldest surviving fa’afafine pioneer is Dr. Vena Sele. Unfortunately, Dr. Sele suffered a stroke several years ago and can no longer communicate coherently. In American Samoa, there is a gathering place for fa’afafine in all of the major villages. The experiences of those who I have been able to interview mirror one another, a mama queen is usually who everyone gravitates to, this person and place where many of us learn and experience life as a fa’afafine for the first time.\n\nSome of my very first fa’afafine friends were sex workers in Pago Pago village, a “Chinatown” of sorts where many Chinese and Korean fishermen frequented. That is how the girls made their living, pandering to these men. While most would look upon my friends as struggling and hustling, I found it fascinating how these fa’afafine learned to survive without legitimate employment. I was never bothered when asked to entertain them or make food runs for them. At our gathering place, I felt like I was in heaven. Now, in retrospect, those experiences and memories shaped me. It has continued to inspire me as I embrace, absorb, and record our stories. If we do not tell our own stories, no one else will.\n\nSome of the earliest recollections I have uncovered during my interviews were the stories of Leilani, Ida (Kifi), Evile, and Taranaki (Donna) who were known for their ukulele songs and singing. In the 1960’s, they were invited to sing on the local radio station and performed a song they wrote highly favoring their home in Apia over Pago. It greatly displeased some of the locals who were listening, and they demanded that the women be deported. In later years, Leilani became a beloved figure in the community and was affectionately known as “Mama” and true to her element, she kept singing her ukulele songs up until her passing in 2003.\n\nA similar situation happened in the 1970’s, when a fa’afafine was accused of robbing a visiting palagi. Based on a witness claim and no proper investigation, the chief immigration officer at the time had deported all fa’afafine from Apia. A total of twenty-six fa’afafine were deported in an obvious case of profiling and severe abuse of power. An early opposition against movies containing LGBTQ subject matter occurred in 1973 at the Halecks West Theater in Pava’ia’i during a showing of “Rocky Horror Picture Show” where the locals began stoning the building; the showing lasted one night. “The elders didn’t want that type of influence on the youth”, recalls witness Tutu Jackson.\n\nNoticeably absent in many retellings of fa’afafine history were key figures of the movement: Rosie Moimoi and Michelle Eneliko. In those days, before other parts of the island were industrialized, Fagatogo and Pago Pago were the main hubs where locals and visitors were able to enjoy everything from shopping to dining and nightclubbing. Herb & Sia’s was one of the venues that fa’afafine frequented in the 70’s. In 1979, Rosie made a request to the owner, Tiumalu Sia Scanlan, that she host and organize a fa’afafine pageant for her birthday. Tiumalu loved the idea and petitioned the Governor at the time, Peter Coleman, for the governor himself to honor the event. Governor Coleman gave a written proclamation and sent several government dignitaries to attend. Sinira Lutu, who pioneered the first beauty pageant for women in American Samoa, was given the honor of crowning the winner. Thus, through Rosie’s efforts, she set in motion the first known event openly celebrating fa’afafine.\n\nMichelle Eneliko was a fiercely unapologetic fa’afafine and staunch educator with a presence that commanded respect. Michelle was the first transgender fa’afafine to live and work professionally as a woman in American Samoa. “I first met Michelle when I was in High School in 1971” said longtime nurse Loata Sipili, “she was bold and assertive with so much confidence when presenting herself in public. Her physical appearance was congruent with her emotional being, she set the stage for a fa’afafine like me who was hesitant and more reserved. Michelle did the same once she entered college and the workforce. Prior to the 70’s, fa’afafine only wore lipstick or makeup and dressed up for night clubs, but never during the daytime for fear of being labeled and mocked by society.”\n\nPerhaps the legacy of Rosie is largely forgotten because she was deemed uneducated and Michelle because of her outspokenness. It would seem that our cultural community chose to more openly embrace figures like Dr. Vena Sele and Leroy Lutu, as they both presented qualities that were deemed acceptable in conservative Samoan society. Thankfully to the changing times, our women in history like Rosie and Michelle are now celebrated as they deserve. Sadly, while Rosie and Michelle have both passed on, it is vitally important that we speak their names and honor the impact of the legacy they left behind.\n\nWhile working on this timeline some of those who were found as history making firsts were excluded out of respect for their privacy. These are fa’afafine who never publicly acknowledged or embraced their identity, and it was agreed with those that I have interviewed that we could not possibly mention their names. I reached out to several who are still living, some consented to having their names published and others respectfully declined. The history of fa’atane (transmen, masculine presenting persons) and lesbians in Samoa is even more difficult to compile because a majority live almost entirely private lives. Dr. Vena Sele wrote in her autobiography, published in 2008, that she knew many fa’afafine from the 50’s and 60’s who skillfully crafted their public image to mask being fa’afafine; some chose to have wives and children and live a heterosexual life for fear of rejection and ridicule. When she completed her college education in 1969, she promised herself that she would not allow Samoan society to dictate her life and would live in her truth no matter the cost, and she did just that.\n\nI never realized until preparing this timeline that a majority of our trailblazers were overwhelmingly fa’afafine transgender women; I felt so empowered. “E matamua lava tatou i luma o le taua. We are at the forefront of the battle” said Tasha Atio’o, who has served over thirty-five years in various fa’afafine organizations and is currently an advisor for the Society of Fa’afafine In American Samoa (S.O.F.I.A.S). “We stand on the shoulders, blood, sweat and tears of fa’afafine transgender women because women like us have had to work ten times harder and fight for our place in society.”\n\nFa’afafine life in American Samoa for the most part has been nearly unscathed with very little history of violence, hate crimes, and protests. There are currently no standing laws against fa’afafine, but forms of oppression have existed and continue to exist today. The case of fa’afafine transgender government worker Simeonica Tuiteleleapaga in 2016 became a controversial turning point of how the government failed to protect fa’afafine employees. After being verbally discriminated against during a meeting by the director of her department, she faced public criticism in the months following the incident. Despite a leaked recording, receiving considerable press coverage and taking her case to the US Department of Labor, the director faced no consequences.\n\nThe Governor at the time, Lolo Moliga, still appointed the director and the Fono approved his nomination. The comments made by some of the senators during his nomination hearing were some of the most disgusting public shaming of a fa’afafine individual. None of them displayed any concern towards Simeonica, going as far as victim-blaming and drawing their decisions from their personal opinions against her. It begs the question, ‘would their views and actions have been the same if the person was not fa’afafine?’. Simeonica’s case is significant because it exposed how Samoan society continues to demean and subjugate fa’afafine to a level of mediocrity.\n\nWhen Tiffany Potasi testified in front of a judiciary committee about a Same Sex Marriage Bill in 2003, she said “Fa’afafine don’t believe in marriages with other men, this is against our Christian upbringing.” Although, interviewing Tiffany today for this story, she said that she does not share the same views she did twenty years ago. “If I could go back in time with the knowledge I have today, I would ask them, ‘who the fuck are they to judge who someone marries?’” she said, “those were the beliefs I was taught growing up and I accepted them. Living as a fa’afafine in Samoa, you conform to societal standards without even realizing and fail to see the larger perspective.” Tiffany’s stance echoes many fa’afafine who have relocated to the mainland, adapting and fostering evolving views when compared to the ones they followed when they lived in Samoa. When UTOPIA Washington, an organization under the executive direction of Taffy Maene-Johnson from American Samoa that employs a majority of fa’afafine from American Samoa, held a discussion forum with S.O.F.I.A.S in 2019, the clash of conservative mindsets and progressive thinking was clear.\n\nJayleen Chun, an instructor at the American Samoa Community College was the first fa’afafine to introduce a Fa’afafine Pride Week in American Samoa and established an inclusive LGBTQIA+ Fa’afafine social club called IMPACT. It did not come with ease and faced many challenges. “Making our people see things in a different light, instead of always using the standards of religion and culture to define the validity of ideas has been a constant challenge” she said, “one example is when I was Miss SOFIAS, I wanted to use the pride flag and rainbow in my publications and advertisement. I was shut down by the SOFIAS advisors with them saying that “we do not want to upset the public, the rainbow and pride flag means gay marriage, and that’s not what we’re trying to do. I feel that many fa’afafine do not want to take the lead with the LGBTQ realm because they are comfortable with their status and acceptance, we as fa’afafine should use our acceptance as a way to guide and lead into more acceptance.”\n\nI asked Tasha about her views on the internalized oppression of some fa’afafine, “it is a difficult subject in a conservative society like Samoa” she said, “but I have seen and learned the value of breaking away from stereotypes. For example, we met Representative Vui Saulo one day and we chatted and asked about her daughter Alayna. I am not sure if the others who were with me realized that they kept misgendering Alayna. The entire time, Vui answered them back referring to Alayna as she/her. That, to me, truly exemplified the kind of love and acceptance they have for their daughter to respect her even without her being present.”\n\nThe word fa’afafine itself has no real cultural depth in meaning, it literally translates to ‘in the manner of woman’. It is only in recent times that many fa’afafine have come to embrace the term. Thirty years ago, it was thrown around to insult and mock us, and still today some do not identify with the term. As we are living in a constantly evolving era, I consulted Ara-Lei Yandall, Cultural Programs Director for UTOPIA Washington, to give me an understanding of how fa’afafine is defined in today’s generation.\n\n“Collectively the UTOPIA chapters came up with a definition that honors the cultural identity of fa’afafine or fa’atane” she said, “it’s a journey, and what we mean by that is that it is a journey an individual takes from feminine to masculine and vice-versa and the journey has no set destination, which only strengthens the argument that fa’afafine comes in many forms. We are living in a time where kids and young adults need specific details of everything in life, including the definition of who they are.”\n\nDuring the course of my interviews with fa’afafine of current times and survivors from an era long gone, Stacie Titiali’i gave a profound statement that I feel deeply epitomizes the journey and life of a fa’afafine; at least for me personally.\n\nI leave you with Satcie’s words: “As a fa’afafine, you always have to take a path that isn’t there and rely on one’s own intuition and faith to carry you through. The life of a fa’afafine is unique and complex, we almost never leave our footprints behind, which makes us all the more misunderstood, even by our own standards. Call it whatever you like, but for a fa’afafine, it is called survival.”\n\nTimeline (and photos) of Fa’afafine Herstory Makers in American Samoa\n\n1962 - Nu’u Savali & Misikopa Petaia, first Fa’afafine nurses, both were locally trained and earned their LPN (License Practice Nurse)\n\n1970 - Vena Vanessa Sele, first Fa’afafine with a college education to become a recognized educator.

Governor Lolo Matalasi Moliga opposed the Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage. He stated, “My personal opinion is, this ruling will not apply to our constitution and our Christian values. Also, our political status is still unorganized and unincorporated, so the Supreme Court ruling does not apply to our territory.” His stance was backed by the Assemblies of God, the Catholic Church, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Senator Tuaolo Manaia Fruean. I sought the legal advice of a local attorney and according to the law the only requirements for marriage are that the persons be a certain age, that they not be related more than fourth degree consanguinity, not have a lawful living spouse, and that the marriage ceremony be performed by a duly authorized individual. The age requirement state that the male must be 18 and female must be 18, but there is no other language that states that marriage must be between a man and a woman. The attorney said the only way, in his opinion, to determine whether the Obergfell decision applies to American Samoa is if two men/women applied for a marriage license at the Office of Vital Stats and if they were denied, then it would be taken to court to determine the applicability of Obergfell to marriages in American Samoa.\n\n2016 – Jaiyah Saelua graces the cover of FIFA 1904 Magazine becoming the first Fa’afafine on an international magazine cover.\n\n2016 – Christmas Tree ornaments created by members of S.O.F.I.A.S. were presented at the President’s Park representing American Samoa at the White House in Washington D C.\n\n2016 – Simeonica Tuiteleleapaga vs. American Samoa Government\n\n2016 – The first Fa’afafine Pride Festival is held over the course of two days.

In an interview, she said “The rewards have not been in money or titles, but just in knowing that you had a part in helping students better their lives. That in itself is motivation to continue.”\n\nMy sincerest gratitude to Loata Sipili, Naeaulumanu’a Tasha LeAtio’o, Miki “Mitzie Gaynor” Kupu, Nancy Olo, Janice Faleafine, Magalita Tifi Leiato, Stacie Titiali’i, Jayleen Chun, Angel Ae, Tiffany Potasi and those who wish to remain anonymous for helping me piece together this timeline."
