        "text": "Introduction\n\nLow- and middle-income countries bear the greatest health and economic burden of the non-communicable disease (NCD) pandemic.1 Pacific Islanders are disproportionately affected compared to other global regions,2, 3, 4, 5 leading to the 2011 Pacific Islands Forum declaration that the “Pacific region is in an NCD crisis.”6, 7, 8\n\nSamoa – an upper-middle income country at the time of the study9–faces some of the highest rates of diabetes and obesity globally after an epidemiologic transition characterized by urbanization, introduction of a high fat, nutrient-poor diet, and reduced opportunities for work/subsistence farming-related physical activity.2,6,10,11 Between 1978 and 2013, Type 2 diabetes prevalence among adults (25-64 years) increased from 1.2% to 19.6% in men and 2.2% to 19.5% in women.12 In a similar analysis conducted between 1991 and 2013, the hypertension prevalence in Samoa increased from 18.3 to 33.9% in men and 14.3 to 26.4% in women, with one-third of this increase attributed to rising obesity levels.13 Interestingly, increases in cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity were highest in the youngest age group of individuals 24-34 years (4.6% per five years).12\n\nSupporting evidence-based practices for surveillance, control, and management of NCDs is a priority in the Pacific Islands.14 One approach to monitoring effectiveness of long-term NCD management is to examine cascades of care: the continuum of prevalence; awareness of risk, diagnosis, referral, treatment, and subsequent control or eradication of disease.15,16 Originally used to evaluate HIV care, this approach has been expanded to NCDs in an effort to shift health care delivery from predominantly episodic acute care towards long-term, comprehensive programs for chronic conditions.17, 18, 19, 20 Knowledge about where in the care continuum people at risk for NCDs and diagnosed patients are lost to care can inform the targeting of intervention programs and delivery of health services and may be a useful metric of health system performance.21\n\nContinuity of NCD care is challenging; a cross-sectional study of pooled, individual-level population-based data from 44 Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), for example, revealed that among the 17.5% of those with hypertension (Blood Pressure (BP) ≥140/90 mmHg or reported use of medication) only 39% had been diagnosed. Thirty percent of those diagnosed were on a treatment regimen, and only 10% of those with hypertension had achieved control over their condition.21 Likewise, data from nationally-representative surveys conducted between 2008 and 2016 in 28 LMICs indicated that among the 8.8% of those with diabetes, only 64.3% had ever been tested with a blood glucose measurement, 44% were aware of their diagnosis, 38.4% received treatment, and only 22.8% had achieved control of their disease.18\n\nThere have been few cascade of care studies completed in the Pacific Island nations, but to our knowledge all of the studies to date have taken place in either Samoa or American Samoa. Keighley et al. used data on hypertension and diabetes and freported that in 2002 in American Samoa, more than 85% of men and 80% of women under the age of 45 who were found to have hypertension during a health research study were unaware of their condition.22 Similarly, in 2003 in Samoa, 96% of men and more than 80% of women of the same age were unaware that they had hypertension.22 The same authors described a better, but still problematic, scenario for diabetes in American Samoa, with 40% of men and women under 45 years unaware of their condition.22 More recently (2018), Fraser-Hurt et al. purposively surveyed four Samoan villages, selected based on their participation in a national NCD intervention (two villages participated, two did not), and identified deficits in hypertension and diabetes screening, diagnosis, and control despite there being available care and medication at community facilities and the national hospital, often subsidized by government funding.23 The existing studies are somewhat limited, however, by the age of the data, their targeted sampling approach, and the fact that little attention has been paid to understanding whether social or demographic characteristics are associated with the likelihood of being retained in the continuum of care for chronic conditions.\n\nTo address these knowledge gaps, we report the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in a cross-sectional, convenience sample of young Samoan adults (29.5-50.9 years), who are at particular risk of early NCD onset given the high prevalence of obesity among this age group.12 We then employ a cascade-of-care approach to characterize and identify unmet need in the continuum of care for both hypertension and diabetes and examine demographic correlates of disease awareness.\n\nDiscussion\n\nNCDs are now responsible for more than eight out of ten deaths in the Pacific region,34 creating unsustainable strain on health care systems. Here we report low levels of awareness, treatment, and subsequent control of diabetes and hypertension among a relatively young cohort of Samoan adults 29 to 50 years of age. While widespread medication use among those aware of their condition indicates engagement with the healthcare system, very poor levels of control persisted among those with a treatment regimen.\n\nWe found a significant burden of diabetes and hypertension in Samoa, exceeding the recent prevalence estimates of other low- to middle-income countries by nearly two-fold.18,21 Although our findings cannot be generalized nationally, diabetes and hypertension prevalence estimates are comparable to the most recent national age- and sex-specific estimates for these conditions (2013, participants aged 25-64 years),12,13 despite the younger overall age of our sample in comparison to the 2013 survey, suggesting an increasing burden of disease. The distribution of both conditions by age and BMI were as expected, with increasing prevalence with age and obesity risk. Overall, we identified substantial gaps in care at all stages of the care cascade, most notably at the stage of awareness of either a diabetes or hypertension diagnosis. We believe that this finding reflects a lack of an initial connection to the healthcare system to facilitate timely screening. While many factors may prevent detection of these NCDs, a perception among Samoan adults that these conditions do not affect a relatively young, healthy population may be contributing, in part, to delayed diagnosis at a stage of severe disease or complications resulting in a hospital admission.\n\nGiven the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, the almost universal unmet need for care is worrisome and should be a priority for health policy makers. Lack of awareness among participants who recorded elevated HbA1c/FBG or BP was responsible for the greatest losses in the care cascade, indicating systematic deficits in screening and surveillance. In fact, loss at this step was similar to that observed in 2003,22 suggesting that the move away from de-centralized, village-based primary care that began in the early 1990s and continued until major reform shortly after this data collection was completed, was ineffective at better identifying chronic disease. Given the relative proximity of our study villages to the major tertiary care center in Apia, we speculate that even greater lack of awareness may exist in more rural areas of the country.\n\nThe proportion of participants with HbA1c/FBG values in the diabetes range but who had not received a prior diagnosis was far greater than estimates of 27.8% for the U.S., 41% for rural Malawi, 47.5% for India, and 53.7% for South Africa.20,33,35,36 Our relatively young cohort may explain the lack of awareness since NCDs are often considered diseases of old age in Samoa and younger individuals tend to underestimate risk.37 Similarly, reported awareness of hypertension in Samoa was lower than in many LMICs.21 While total unmet need was similar for both conditions, our findings suggest that diabetes is more effectively identified than hypertension, mirroring findings from Samoa in 2003.22 The proportion of participants aware of their hypertension (12%) was much lower than that of diabetes (20%), a trend similar to that observed in Peru (48.3% versus 71.1%).38 This is likely due to the asymptomatic nature of hypertension, which is rarely detected during its early stages.39\n\nFemales were more likely than males to report awareness of their hypertension; although the trend was the same, the statistical association did not extend to diabetes. This might be attributed in part to more frequent BP measurement compared to diabetes screening in maternal health services, as well as general health-seeking behavior. No other significant correlates of awareness were identified, suggesting the need to look beyond demographic characteristics. Several other factors influence how patients interact with healthcare systems: limited access to screening, NCD counseling, or lack of communication of test results may impede diagnosis;33 additionally, in the Pacific healthcare is often sought late in the disease continuum with familial or societal obligations prioritized.40 On a structural level, a limited workforce has challenged the monitoring of NCDs,11,41 highlighting the importance of task-shifted or community-based care.42\n\nWhile lack of awareness was a concern, medication use was widespread among those reporting a diagnosis, representing an improvement since 2002-2003, when hypertension medication use was 33.3% among diagnosed Samoan males (18-44 years) and 46.7% among females.22 Medication use indicates availability, which is often challenging in LMIC settings,43, 44, 45 and at least some level of accessibility. Control of both NCDs, however, was poor, suggesting that medication use at the time of the survey may not reflect continuity in taking medications long-term or consistency in engaging with the healthcare system. For many patients, interacting with the health system, particularly the main hospital situated in Apia, may involve considerable travel time, disruption to daily life, or time away from employment. Suboptimal control may also be associated with local beliefs that NCDs are cyclical rather than chronic in nature or that medications can be discontinued once patients “feel better.”37 Although medications are heavily subsidized by the Samoan government, financial barriers to sustained health system engagement and medication use are often cited.37 Since the small number of participants who exhibited control of their condition in this study prohibited formal analyses, further research is needed to better document factors impacting NCD control in this setting.\n\nPopulation-level interventions in the Pacific are placing increased emphasis on improving primary care screening campaigns, regular surveillance, and NCD self-management.42 More widespread national screening and surveillance campaigns that include annual physicals for at-risk groups, as well as programs that leverage village and district nurses for community-based primary care may be critical steps towards reducing gaps in the continuum of care. Previously, a randomized controlled trial that tested a primary care-based nurse-community health worker intervention in American Samoa showed that targeted delivery of education on healthy eating, medication use, and self-monitoring, improved HbA1c among intervention recipients.46 Benefits did not extend, however, beyond the end of the trial, indicating that longer-term efforts that prioritize sustainability within existing health infrastructure are needed47 Current efforts to reinvigorate village-based care, including broad implementation of the recently introduced PEN Fa'a Samoa program,37,42 an initiative that emphasizes early detection of NCDs, referral to local care, and increasing awareness surrounding risk factors, may be an effective first step. While most population-level interventions and policies still favor an older adult population, the PEN Fa'a Samoa program is targeting all adults >20 years of age, bearing promise for future efforts to focus on a younger, high-risk segment of the population.37 Without an additional focus on ensuring all those screened are engaged in treatment initially and remain so, however, this approach may have little impact on disease control. Repetition of cascade of care analyses in coming years may serve as a useful evaluation tool.\n\nSeveral limitations of this work should be noted. As we describe above, our prevalence estimates cannot be generalized nationally due to our convenience sampling and the exclusion of the most rural census region, nor beyond Samoa. Because the purpose of the recruitment was not NCD screening, we believe that any bias towards participation among those seeking blood pressure or blood sugar screening was minimal. The number of participants who met each exclusion category was also not recorded, and the number of participants in some category comparisons, particularly across census regions, was small. We recognize additional challenges of generalizability associated with excluding those on diet and exercise programs, or with significant prior weight loss, although we believe few reported these behaviors. While the higher rate of diabetes observed in rural Upolu compared to other census regions aligns with a trend involving a faster rise in diabetes in rural regions in comparison to urban areas as of 200248 we urge caution in interpreting this finding given that only 3% of the sample were resident in the rural area. Ideally, hypertension diagnoses result from BP measurements completed on at least two separate occasions; we were limited by the single participant interaction, therefore the prevalence of hypertension should, again, be interpreted with caution. There are several approaches to constructing cascades of care,49 and we used a fixed denominator rather than a conditional or time-series analysis. Specifically, our study used prior diagnosis (awareness), as the first step in the care continuum and did not assess whether participants had ever received BP or diabetes screening. When Fraser-Hurt et al. conducted a similar hypertension-focused study in Samoa in 2018,35 they began their cascade with screening and documented significant deficits in BP screening rates, which may indicate further challenges of resource availability and use. Finally, our definition of awareness was based on the question “Has a doctor ever told you that you have hypertension or diabetes? (separate questions for each condition)” If the question was interpreted literally, it may have overlooked diagnoses by nurses, other allied health professionals, or research-based screening like ours, thereby overestimating deficits in awareness. We believe, however, this was unlikely given the comparable estimates presented by Fraser-Hurt et al (2020).35\n\nThe chronic disease burden in Samoa demands urgent action and investment in preventative and primary care. Substantial losses in both diabetes and hypertension care cascades were observed at the awareness stage. Widespread treatment use among those who were aware of their diabetes and hypertension, indicates that targeted interventions should be directed towards increasing awareness and subsequent management once on a treatment regimen. Primary healthcare delivery aimed at early detection should yield significant gains in addressing disease awareness in Samoa and may mitigate the challenges that other resource-strained settings face in burgeoning NCD crises."
