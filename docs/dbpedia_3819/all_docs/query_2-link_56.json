She sought to discover whether adolescence was a universally traumatic and stressful time due to biological factors or whether the experience of adolescence depended on one's cultural upbringing. Her findings were published in Coming of Age in Samoa (1928), a vivid, descriptive account of Samoan adolescent life that became tremendously popular.",

        "text": "Return to To the Field and Back Manus: Childhood Thought\n\nAfterward: Derek Freeman and Margaret Mead\n\nIn 1983, five years after Margaret Mead's death, Harvard University Press published a book by Derek Freeman (1916–2001), an anthropology professor at the Australian National University, which challenged the accuracy of Mead's findings in Coming of Age in Samoa. The book, Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth, received widespread media attention. It became a prominent case study in the ongoing battle over the relative importance of “nature versus nurture.”\n\nFreeman had corresponded with Mead during her lifetime and questioned her on some of her methods and results in Samoa. He argued that Mead had erred in her Samoan work and that she misunderstood the culture because she wanted to provide her professor Franz Boas with information to demonstrate his view of the importance of culture. Among other criticisms, Freeman argued that Mead ignored violence in Samoan life, did not have a sufficient background in—or give enough emphasis to—the influence of biology on behavior, did not spend enough time in Samoa, and was not familiar enough with the Samoan language. Freeman's charges did not go unchallenged. Other researchers have argued that he overemphasized the violent and competitive aspects of Samoan life, quoted Mead selectively, and studied a different part of Samoa at a later time period. Freeman subsequently published other books and articles on Mead's Samoan researches, most notably The Fateful Hoaxing of Margaret Mead (1999). In that book Freeman argued that Mead had been lied to by two of her female informants and thus came to erroneous conclusions about Samoan culture and the sexual freedom of the girls. Freeman's claims were again challenged by other researchers. Even after Freeman's death on July 6, 2001, scholars continue to debate the issues raised by this controversy.\n\nBack to Top"
