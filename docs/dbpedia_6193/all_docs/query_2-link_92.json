It embraces connections and sharing resources. Walnut is an open working platform that allows creators to freely work, live and network among other creators of different fields and professions. The company was established by young people who have studied MBA abroad, and cooperate with more than 50 innovative and entrepreneurial companies. As a platform full of energy and creative ideology, Walnut is a window into understanding the thought of the new Chinese generation."
