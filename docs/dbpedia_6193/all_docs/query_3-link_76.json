        "text": "In the cinema as on TV screen, China has always been brimming with talented actors. Chinese actors exude style, charm, and gift. And with every single film or drama, they win us over a little bit more.\n\nBut have you been wondering which of the numerous Chinese actors out there is the most popular one in the Chinese-speaking world? Which is the most famous one? And the most successful one?\n\nIf the answer is yes, then you’re going to love this post.\n\nI lived in China for most of my life as a movie critic, and watching Chinese movies and dramas has always been a big part of my life. Over the decades, I’ve gotten to know about hundreds of Chinese performers, their life stories, and their career achievements.\n\nIn this mega-post, I give you the low down on the 20 most popular Chinese actors whose handsome appearances and stirring performances have melted our hearts and resonated across oceans. From undisputed household names such as Ge You, who was the first Chinese actor to win Cannes’ best performance honors, to rising young stars like Liu Haoran, who has claimed some of China’s top accolades in the ‘2020s, you’ll discover the dazzling lives of the best actors in China today, specifically:\n\nThe story and rise of each actor (and why they’re so popular)\n\nTheir most famous roles and notable performances\n\nTheir absolute must-watch movies and dramas\n\nPlease note: Don’t look for Hong Kong actors like Jackie Chan, Donnie Yen, or Chow Yun-fat here. Although they’re all exceptionally popular, I wanted this list to focus squarely on famous actors in Mainland China, whose works are primarily based on Mandarin.\n\nCan’t wait to get started? Let’s dive in!\n\n1. Jiang Wen (姜文)\n\nWhen it comes to famous Chinese actors, Jiang Wen is the first one to spring to many Chinese people’s minds. Known for his non-conformist style, Jiang Wen is a titan in the Chinese film industry.\n\nBorn in 1963 in the industrial city of Tangshan in China’s Heibei Province, Jiang Wen was the eldest son of a military family that relocated to Beijing when he was 10 years old.\n\nJiang Wen began his acting career both on the stage and the screen in 1984 after graduating from the Central Academy of Drama, China’s foremost acting school.\n\nJiang Wen first came to public attention in the 1986 film The Last Empress (末代皇后 Mò Dài Huáng Hòu) where he portrayed Puyi (溥仪), the last emperor of China.\n\nIn his second film, Hibiscus Town (芙蓉镇 Fúróng Zhèn) (1986), he acted alongside Liu Xiaoqing (刘晓庆), an established older actress. His role as a “bourgeoisie” rightist caught up in the political turmoil of China’s Cultural Revolution earned him the Best Actor Award at the Hundred Flowers Awards (the Chinese equivalent of American Golden Globes).\n\nBut it was his role in iconic director Zhang Yimou (张艺谋)’s debut movie Red Sorghum (红高粱 Hóng Gāoliáng) (1987) that brought him international fame. The film won the Golden Bear Award at the 1988 Berlin International Film Festival, and Jiang Wen enjoyed critical and box office acclaim as the star.\n\nJiang Wen’s other well-known starring roles have included the melodrama Chun Tao (春桃 Chūn Táo) (1989), the romance drama In the Heat of the Sun (阳光灿烂的日子 Yángguāng Cànlàn de RìZi) (1994), the black comedy Devils on the Doorstep (鬼子来了 Guǐzi Lái le) (2000), the art film The Sun Also Rises (太阳照常升起 Tàiyáng Zhàocháng Shēng Qǐ) (2007), the action-crime comedy Let the Bullets Fly (让子弹飞 Ràng Zǐdàn Fēi) (2010), and its semi-sequel Gone with the Bullets (一步之遥 Yí Bù Zhī Yáo) (2014).\n\nIn Hollywood, He also starred in the Star Wars anthology film Rogue One (2016) as Baze Malbus.\n\nOn television, he appeared in smash-hit TV drama series such as A Native of Beijing in New York (北京人在纽约 Běijīngrén Zài Niǔyuē) (1993) and Heroic Legend of the Chin Dynasty (大清风云 Dà Qīng Fēngyún) (2006).\n\nBesides acting, Jiang Wen has an equally successful career as screenwriter and director, having received various awards in recognition of his remarkable projects: he garnered six Golden Horse Awards in Taiwan for his directorial debut and clinched the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nWith numerous significant awards he amassed over his 35+ year film career and having collaborated with China’s most talented directors, Jiang Wen is one of the popular and most influential actors in China to this day and continues to be revered by fans all over the world.\n\nHere are insights into some of Jiang Wen’s amazing films.\n\nRed Sorghum (红高粱 Hóng Gāoliáng)\n\nJiang Wen stars opposite Gong Li (巩俐) in this award-winning war romance film with political overtones. The plot focuses on a young bride, Jiu’er (九儿), who is sold to a distillery owner. The movie’s dissemination into Chinese popular culture and the ideology it professes makes it an interesting subject of critical reflection.\n\nIn the Heat of the Sun (阳光灿烂的日子 Yángguāng Cànlàn de RìZi)\n\nSet in the early 1970s, In the Heat of the Sun (literally Days of Lush, Bright Sunshine), the directorial debut of Jiang Wen is about the unique experiences of a group of privileged teenagers who grew up in Beijing’s government and military compounds during the Cultural Revolution. It is told from the perspective of Ma Xiaojun (马小军), a boy nicknamed “Monkey”. Jiang Wen portrayed the grownup Ma Xiaojun.\n\nLet the Bullets Fly (让子弹飞 Ràng Zǐdàn Fēi)\n\nOne of the most successful films of all time in China, this 2010 broad comedy movie written and directed by Jiang Wen himself is set in a lawless town in Sichuan during the 1920s when the bandit Zhang Muzhi (张牧之) (Jiang Wen) arrives posing as its new governor and finds himself in a showdown with the local “godfather”. The film also stars Hong Kong superstars Chow Yun-fat (周润发), Carina Lau (刘嘉玲), and top mainland Chinese actors Ge You (葛优) and Chen Kun (陈坤).\n\n2. Ge You (葛优)\n\nGe You, often with a bald shaven pate, is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most famous Chinese actors. He is not only the Best Actor winner of Golden Rooster Awards, China’s most prestigious film awards but also the first Asian actor to win Cannes’ best performance honors.\n\nGe You was born in Beijing in 1957 to actor parents who both worked in film. However, his acting career did not start off all that smoothly. After graduating from middle school, Ge You had to go to the suburbs of Beijing to farm pigs amid China’s Cultural Revolution.\n\nAfter failing several times to get into an art school, he finally got admitted into the Art Troupe of China’s National Federation of Trade Unions with the skit Feeding Pigs (喂猪 Wèi Zhū) at the interview. He then became a drama actor, spent the next few years playing small roles on stage.\n\nGe You first gained recognition in 1991, after landing a role in the Chinese drama The Spring Festival (过年 Guò Nián), for which he earned the Best Supporting Actor at the Hundred Flower Awards. He broke out as star on screen with the hit TV series Stories From the Newsroom (编辑部的故事 Biānjí Bù de Gùshì) (1992), China’s first western-style sitcom.\n\nIn 1994, Ge You won his first best actor accolades at an international festival by starring in the film To Live (活着 Huó zhe) based on Yu Hua (余华)’s novel of the same name. He became the first Chinese – indeed Asian to win the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThis was followed up with The Dream Factory (甲方乙方 Jiǎ Fāng Yǐ Fāng) (1997), one of the first notable and successful “Hesui Pian” (Chinese New Year-end festive films) produced in mainland China.\n\nAnd Feng Xiaogang (冯小刚), the renowned Chinese “Hesui Pian” director and box-office king just couldn’t get enough of Ge You! They collaborated in a string of highly successful commercial films including Be There or Be Square (不见不散 Bú jiàn bú sàn), Sorry Baby (没完没了 Méi Wán Méi Liǎo), Big Shot’s Funeral (大腕 Dà Wàn), Cell Phone (手机 Shǒujī), A World Without Thieves (天下无贼 Tiān Xià Wú Zéi), If You Are the One (非诚勿扰 Fēi Chéng Wù Rǎo) and so on.\n\nAlthough Ge You does not have a pretty face, he has won the love of numerous audiences with his satire-laden performances and tempered humorous style.\n\nWith more than 60 films and 10 television series to his name and numerous awards received, Ge You truly is a giant on the Chinese screen!\n\nHere are some of Ge You’s most notable performances:\n\nBig Shot’s Funeral (大腕 Dà Wàn)\n\nThe 90-minute black comedy centers on world-renowned American director Don Tyler (played by Donald Sutherland), directing a chaotic remake of Bertolucci’s The Last Emperor on location in Beijing’s Forbidden City, and You You (尤优) (Ge You), a Beijing cameraman he hired to shoot a “making of” documentary. Fired by his producer, Tyler has a stroke and deliriously asks Yoyo to film him and make him a “comedy funeral” when he dies. The film brought Ge You the 25th Hundred Flowers Awards for Best Actor.\n\nIf You Are the One (非诚勿扰 Fēi Chéng Wù Rǎo)\n\nReleased in China as one of the key year-end festive films of 2008, the box office hit If You Are the One centers on an unlikely couple coming together through blind dates. Ge You portrays Qin Fen (秦奋), a funny, honest, single inventor who has never had much luck in the love department until his path crosses with Xiaoxiao (笑笑), a girl who was in agony of her boyfriend’s betrayal. Westerners wishing to get a taste of Chinese-style romantic comedy will be pleasantly surprised.\n\nTo Live (活着 Huó zhe)\n\nAlthough Ge You is most known for his roles in comedies, he has also had great success in dramatic roles. The most successful one of these is the film To Live directed by Zhang Yimou in 1994. In the film, Ge You plays Fugui (富贵), a rich man’s son and compulsive gambler, from youth to old age spanning the years from China’s 1930s civil war through the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), vividly showing a minor character who has tasted the enjoyment and suffering of the world to the audience, and also brought his acting skills to the fullest.\n\n3. Li Lianjie (李连杰)\n\nLi Lianjie, better known by his stage name Jet Li, is one of the most renowned Chinese film actors in the world. Once considered the heir apparent to the original master Bruce Lee (李小龙), Li Lianjie has garnered global recognition for his superlative martial arts skills and his portrayals of virtuous, humble heroes.\n\nBorn in Beijing in 1963, Li Lianjie entered a summer sports program at Beijing Shichahai Sports School when he was only eight years old and was randomly assigned to a wushu (martial arts) class. He then spent half the day training and half the day in school on daily basis before beginning to train full-time.\n\nIn 1974 he toured the United States with other young martial artists and even met President Richard Nixon at the White House. That same year Li Lianjie won his first national wushu championship.\n\nIn 1979 Li Lianjie retired from the sport due to a knee injury after winning 5 medals for the Beijing Wushu Team at the 4th National Games of China. The fame gained by his sports winnings led to a career as a martial arts film star.\n\nIn 1980, Li Lianjie was cast in Hong Kong director Zhang Xinyan (张鑫炎)’s film Shaolin Temple (少林寺 Shàolín Sì) as Jue Yuan (觉远), a young man who learns martial arts from the monks at the famed Shaolin Temple (the legendary birthplace of Chinese martial arts). The film was a smash hit (with two sequels) in the Chinese-speaking world and was credited with reviving interest in Chinese martial arts.\n\nWhen the movie was released in the Philippines in 1982, the local distributors thought Li Lianjie’s name was too hard to pronounce, so they gave him a stage name – Jet Li.\n\nHe followed the success with roles in many films that all turned out to be hits in the 1980s. Then, in director Tsui Hark (徐克)’s 1991 epic film Once Upon a Time in China (黄飞鸿之壮志凌云 Huáng Fēihóng zhī Zhuàng Zhì Líng Yún), Li Lianjie played his most famous character on screen ever, the historical martial arts master Wong Fei-hung (黄飞鸿), who fought against injustice and foreign encroachment at the end of the Qing dynasty. This became one of the greatest roles in Chinese cinema history and he reprised this role in three sequels.\n\nThroughout the 1990s Li Lianjie was the most sought-after actor in China for martial arts films. Then Hollywood called, so the Chinese actor took off to Los Angeles, appearing in Lethal Weapon 4 (1998), Romeo Must Die (2000), and The One (2001).\n\nThereafter his career was divided between China and Hollywood. While continuing to star in big Chinese blockbusters including Hero (英雄 Yīngxióng) (2002), Fearless (霍元甲 Huò Yuánjiǎ) (2006), The Warlords (投名状 Tóu Míng Zhuàng) (2007), and Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (龙门飞甲 Lóng Mén Fēi Jiǎ) (2011), he also appeared in Hollywood films Cradle 2 the Grave (2003), Unleashed (2005), The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008), actor-director Sylvester Stallone’s The Expendables (2010) and its sequels (2012 and 2014), and Mulan (2020).\n\nLi Lianjie is indeed one of the most popular Chinese actors in the world, both for his performances and for his active role in promoting Chinese martial arts and wushu culture around the world.\n\nHere’s a little portion of some of Li Lianjie’s best performances:\n\nHero (英雄 Yīngxióng)\n\nLi Lianjie plays the lead Nameless in director Zhang Yimou’s Hero, a lavish and complexly plotted martial arts spectacular about assassins trying to kill King of Qin, the first emperor of China. The film was nominated Best International Feature Film at the 75th Academy Awards.\n\nThe Warlords (投名状 Tóu Míng Zhuàng)\n\nIn 2007, Li turned his hand to Chinese cinema again, participating in Peter Chan (陈可辛)’s period war movie The Warlords with Andy Lau (刘德华) and Takeshi Kaneshiro. This film, with its focus on dramatics rather than martial arts, garnered Li Lianjie Best Actor at the Hong Kong Film Awards and another nomination at the Taipei Golden Horse Awards.\n\nThe Forbidden Kingdom (功夫之王 Gōng Fū zhī Wáng)\n\nTogether for the first time, Li Lianjie and fellow martial arts star Jackie Chan (成龙) joined forces to create the greatest epic of them all – The Forbidden Kingdom. The film, which was a huge commercial success in 2008 is based on the legend of the Monkey King from the Chinese folk novel Journey to the West (西游记 Xī Yóu Jì).\n\n4.

At age 8, he watched the smash-hit Shaolin Temple (少林寺 Shàolín Sì) (1982) starring Jet Li (李连杰) when the film was shown in his village. This movie inspired the young boy, who was constantly bullied by other kids, to become a Chinese kungfu star one day.\n\nThat same year he started martial arts training at the famous Shaolin Temple against his family’s wish.\n\nFrom the age of 8 to 14, Wang Baoqiang would have to get up at 5 am in winter, and 4 am in summer, running half-marathons and climbing cliffs with 45-degree angles as part of his training.

It is breathtaking to watch Wang Baoqiang and Donnie Yen roll and tumble between the vehicles as they attempt to kill each other.\n\nDetective Chinatown (唐人街探案 Tángrén Jiē Tàn Àn)\n\nIn this hilarious comedy-mystery buddy film, Wang Baoqiang plays the role of a bumbling detective named Tang Ren (唐仁) who lives in Chinatown in Bangkok.
