        "text": "Chinese films have the potential to play a key role in the Belt and Road Initiative. Although Chinese Malaysians contributed to the development of China’s film industry, the consumption incentives of Chinese Malaysians for Chinese films are worth mentioning. Furthermore, Chinese Malaysians’ purchasing behaviour towards Chinese films is affected by a combination of consuming factors. However, the function of linguistic proximity in the link between consuming incentive and purchasing behaviour is unexplored. This study focused on Chinese Malaysian students from three universities in Selangor and applied online questionnaires in quantitative research methods. Data were collected from 165 Chinese Malaysians. Results show that Chinese Malaysians are mostly motivated to watch Chinese films by the sense of belonging and vitality. Furthermore, linguistic proximity significantly influences the association between Chinese Malaysians’ motive for belonging and their purchasing behaviour for Chi...\n\nThis study uses textual analysis of the relevant Chinese and English literature to examine Chinese-language films in Malaysia. Malaysian Chinese-language films have developed over the last 100 years thanks to imports, Chinese investment, the Malayanised Chinese-language film movement, the Malaysian Independent Filmmaking Movement, commercial films, the Chinese film association and film festivals. Moreover, Chinese Malaysians’ cultural identity became a national identity. Chinese-language films also turned from being independent projects to commercial ventures. Although the government has recognised Chinese-language films, the industry still lacks governmental support. Furthermore, filmmakers focus on the multicultural background of Malaysia, hoping that films can resonate among the country’s three ethnic groups. The Malaysian Chinese-language film industry needs to face the challenges of brain drain and limited audiences. From the perspective of communication strategy, filmmakers should cooperate with film companies from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan for co-production, in addition to pushing Malaysian Chinese-language films into the international market.\n\nConference: International Conference on Social Sciences and Humanities Abstract: This research investigates how multiculturalism interacts with sub-state nationalism as portrayed in the Malaysian top-grossing film The Journey directed by Chiu Keng Guan in 2014. It inevitably gives attention to particular Malaysian cultural norms and nuances. The nature of Malaysian society and its colonial history might suggest that cultural interaction among its three major races is a norm, but this study argues that the culture of these three major races as portrayed in the fictional film is made up of \" systems of representations \" ; such systems of representations do not reflect the intentions of the subjects, but rather, actively construct meanings as conditions and instruments, signifying practice in reality. The application of in-depth interviews (e.g., the film director and the screenplay writer) discovered cultural identity depicted in the film as always having a specific 'positionality' within their representation, and the ideological struggle of multicultural nationalism embedded in the film is considered 'non-subjective'. The authors believe that every culture is local, but no culture is autochthonous, and cultural identity illustrated in the film can be regarded as 'uniqueness of the soil'.\n\nThis study examines how Sinophone Malaysian films have engaged with China-centrism to advocate for local identity. Following the Sinophone concept, it specifically discusses the efforts of emerging Chinese Malaysian filmmakers, and how they promote local Sinophone identity in their films. The Sinophone concept, proposed by Shih Shu-mei, highlights a very important ideological intention: anti-China-centrism. Thus, this study further investigates these filmmakers' level of resistance to China-centrism in constructing their local identities. Based on analysis of a few films, such as South of South, Nasi Lemak 2.0, Petaling Street Warrior, Woohoo!, and Ice Kacang Puppy Love, a narrative was found, proclaiming a \"from China to local\" identity. These films have maintained a distance from Chinese nationalism, and revealed the creole language of Chinese Malaysians used to create their local identities.\n\nOf late, issues of national cinema have sparked much debates and discourses in the context of Malaysian cinema. Nonetheless, the definition(s) and conception(s) of what constitutes a &quot;Malaysian film&quot; remain vague and unclear. There is to date still insufficient critical analysis examining how popular discourses of nationalism and national identities have shaped the development of the Malaysian film industry. This essay attempts to investigate and propose what constitutes a &quot;Malaysian&quot; film, arguing for the protection of a national cinema and acknowledging the critical role that films play in the process of national idealism.\n\nThe globalization of Korea culture, particularly in Asia was clearly seen through their television drama series and have become the favourite media genre especially among Malaysian viewers. The purpose of this study is to understand how the Korean culture in Korean drama able to influence Malaysian audiences. This research uses qualitative method to address the research problems. The aims are to investigate human phenomena, interpretations and meaning that are unknown and needed to be explored. This further enforces the reason behind why the researcher has decided to use qualitative method as the research methodology as it enables the researcher to understand why and how Korean dramas have been successful in having a big impact on Malaysian's audiences. The researcher uses ethnographic design concept in order to apprehend the impact of Korean dramas on Malaysian audiences by learning the similarities between both cultures. The researcher employed the in-depth interview method. In order to clarify the data obtained is valid and true, researcher has also conducted pragmatic validity process. The finding shows that Korean dramas satisfy Asian audiences' emotional needs by being easy to assimilate to a similar life style, cultural proximity and expressiveness.\n\nThis study attempts to discover how multiculturalism interacts with sub-state nationalism as portrayed in the Malaysian top-grossing film of 2014 – The Journey directed by Chiu Keng Guan. The nature of Malaysian society and its colonial history might suggest that cultural interaction among its three major races (Malays, Chinese, and Indians) is a norm, but this study argues that the culture of these three major races as portrayed in the fictional film is made up of \" systems of representations \" ; such systems of representations do not reflect the intentions of the subjects, but rather, actively construct meanings as conditions and instruments, signifying practice in reality. The application of in-depth interviews (e.g., the film director and the screenplay writer) discovered cultural identity depicted in the film as always having a specific 'positionality' within their representation, and the ideological struggle of multicultural nationalism embedded in the film is considered 'non-subjective'.

The concept of ethnic boundaries by Mansor (2012) has been applied to evaluate the shifting ethnic boundaries. There are two research objectives for this study which are, firstly, to explore the perceptions of the students on the use of Malaysian Independent film, Gadoh as a pedagogical tool to discuss sensitive issues relating to interethnic relations in Malaysia and secondly, to evaluate the changes in the shifting of their ethnic boundaries based on their perceptions of the film. Five participants have been purposively selected from different ethnic backgrounds and fields of studies to participate in a focus group discussion. The findings suggests that Gadoh is perceived as a potential pedagogical tool for experiential learning, critical awareness on the issues of ethnic relations and lastly, as a platf..."
