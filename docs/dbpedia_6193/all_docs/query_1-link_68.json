        "text": "Citation preview\n\nForeword\n\nOne can draw considerable satisfaction from the achievements of Hong Kong cinema over the past year or so. Inroads have been made into the American market on account of the Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh phenomena; Wong Kar-wai pictures have gained a substantial art-house following; John Woo, Ringo Lam and Tsui Hark have joined the ranks of Hollywood action directors. However, within the domestic market, the Hong Kong film industry is in crisis and has been for the last four years. Its market share has shrunk by as much as 40% and box-office earnings have dropped. Ironically, as Hong Kong cinema has become better known internationally, its predominance in the domestic market has increasingly been eroded by Hollywood. For the first time in 20 or even 30 years, Hollywood movies have gained a secure foothold in the Hong Kong market. In 1993, the year when the crisis can be said to have begun, Jurassic Park became the highest-grossing film of all time at the Hong Kong box office. The Hong Kong film industry advanced towards the nineties in a spirit of optimism. Some 66 million tickets were sold in 1988 (although this figure dropped to 44.8 million in 1989). In the late eighties, Hong Kong cinema's first new wave began to mature after a period of consolidation. At the same time a younger, second wave of filmmakers (Clara Law, Stanley Kwan, Wong Kar-wai) courted international recognition. In this period, the industry underwent certain structural changes, notably as a result of the introduction of a classification system in the wake of a new censorship bill. (The relaxation of censorship norms coincided with a more liberal attitude towards sexual matters in the wider society, as was exemplified by the legislative council's decriminalisation of homosexuality in 1990.) Liberal censorship laws gave rise to a new genre of soft-core entertainment known as 'Category Three' movies (restricted to adults). As the nineties progressed, however, the picture began to change: the boom in property prices spelt the end of the big cinema halls; the exhibition sector began to streamline its operations by demolishing oldfashioned cinemas seating over a thousand people and replacing them with multiplexes boasting state-of-the-art technology in sound, projection and seating. This programme of replacement was the most fundamental structural change to occur in the film industry, but while it brought Hong Kong cinemas in line with international practices and standards, it has had the consequence of contracting the market. The number of cinemas vn\n\nincreased but admissions went steadily down. This can be attributed to the fact that theatre owners have routinely increased admission prices. At the same time, the costs of producing a movie have rocketed to new heights in the face of stars' demands for high salaries (big names are often paid about US$1 million per movie). It is easy to blame the crisis on macroeconomic structural changes in the market (in fact, due to the crisis, the market responded in 1997 with some remedial measures such as reducing ticket prices from HK$50 to HK$30 on Tuesdays). Arguably, though, this is to ignore the problem of the poor quality of productions: the relatively unregulated state of the industry has always tended to lead to over-production in a search for quick profits and short-term gains. There is always the problem of 'audience fatigue' and the fact that Hong Kong's changing demographics mean that a new breed of teenagers are now propping up the film industry. That the crisis has continued over the last four years indicates that there are no easy solutions. The Hong Kong film industry is caught in a potentially deadly cycle: the market has been shrinking at the same time as costs (ticket prices, production budgets, star salaries) have spiralled inexorably upwards - partly in response to the diminished audience's demands for 'added value'. Over the last four years, added value has not been found in Hong Kong cinema and audiences have turned instead to Hollywood blockbusters for satisfaction. Efforts have been made to ameliorate this situation. In 1996 the industry began to shift its emphasis away from A-List big budgeters by concentrating on low-budget, quickly-made, independent-based productions starring unknowns and cashing in on the teenage market. UFO pictures such as Peter Chan's comedies {He's a Woman, She's a Man and its sequel, plus the Maggie Cheung-Leon Lai romancer, Comrades, Almost a Love Story) led a minor recovery which was capitalised upon by the P.U. production company with its B-movie thrillers (The Third Full Moon, The Day That Doesn't Exist). Then there were the 'triad kid' movies inspired by comics (Young and Dangerous and its sequels) as well as numerous imitations (Once Upon a Time in Triad Society, and its sequel); even the Wong Kar-wai art films (Chungking Express, Fallen Angels) have done modestly well at the local box office. However, the crisis seems to have become ingrained as a kind of philosophical coming-to-terms with the handover and, perhaps, with the realisation that Hong Kong cinema will never be the same again as it faces integration with China. All eyes are now turned to the Mainland Chinese market, hoping that it will offer the Hong Kong film industry a way out of its malaise. Though the Chinese film market has itself shrunk considerably, it remains formidable: the figure of 5 billion tickets sold annually is being brandished about. More players are entering the Chinese market as the country reforms its distribution structures, breaking a state monopoly over foreign movie imports (the country's major studios are now awarded permits to distribute overseas films). In the nineties, Hong Kong filmmakers jumped on the bandwagon of coproductions with China. Industry insiders see China evolving as the most Vlll\n\nimportant market for Hong Kong movies, eventually eclipsing traditional markets such as Taiwan and Southeast Asia. While a number of Hong Kong filmmakers have gone into China to make their own films, a few have poured money into films made by established Chinese directors of the calibre of Chen Kaige (Farewell My Concubine), Zhang Yimou (Raise the Red Lantern) and Huang Jianxin (Back to Back, Face to Face). The bulk of co-productions are run-of-the-mill escapist entertainments (with an accent on violence) which rarely encounter censorship problems. But China has blown more hot than cold with regard to censorship and the issue of 'independent filmmaking.' China has, in fact, cut down on the number of co-productions with Hong Kong in the past two years, though for reasons which are not entirely clear. Restrictions are imposed on filming and on distribution rights; in some cases, Hong Kong filmmakers are unable to get their negatives out of China for cutting and post-production. Last year, the number of co-productions dropped to about ten from forty to fifty in previous years. Bureaucracy and censorship loom as the greatest obstacles to greater co-operation and may yet prove to be the bamboo pole that breaks the back of the Hong Kong film industry after the handover. So far, Chinese filmmakers have been in the firing line in terms of the censorship debate: in 1994, the Chinese authorities issued an official blacklist of 'independent' directors including Tian Zhuangzhuang, the acclaimed director of The Blue Kite, and Zhang Yuan. Their films are officially banned and any showings at international film festivals arouse the ire of the Chinese authorities, often leading to punitive action (such as banning directors from attending festivals and withdrawing films). Hong Kong filmmakers clearly have something to worry about if China's current tendency to censor films and her intransigent attitudes remain unaltered after the handover. Blacklisting directors and banning movies spell the death of creativity for filmmakers who continue working in the system. For those Hong Kong directors who have worked in China, an overriding desire to see China take its rightful place in the community of civilised nations is tempered by scepticism about the future of their home city as it returns to the embrace of the Motherland. The events of recent years have not inspired optimism and may serve to discourage film investment in China. Certainly, not all Hong Kong filmmakers have been seduced by the rush for co-productions with the Mainland and not all filmmakers are convinced that China offers them a lifeline. Even those filmmakers who see China as the Hong Kong film industry's 'saviour' acknowledge that there are numerous difficulties to overcome, arguing that restrictions have to be lifted and censorship relaxed before any breakthroughs can be achieved. On the other hand, the Hong Kong film industry has struggled against the odds in the past to become the world's third largest film industry. No one would be foolish enough to dismiss it as a spent force. The post-handover film industry of Hong Kong could take off yet again and conjure up another miracle in the face of great adversity. This book offers a history of Hong Kong cinema in the post-war period. It is an extraordinary history of survival and success against the odds, a IX\n\nhistory which is inseparably bound up with Hong Kong's economic miracle. It is a book which I had long wanted to write, having ruminated long and hard on the subject during my work as English editor with the Hong Kong International Film Festival - specifically with the editing of its annual retrospective catalogues. The catalogues offer the only systematic studies of Hong Kong cinema anywhere. They have gone some way to redressing the critical neglect of Hong Kong cinema, but there is still much ground to cover, not least because of the lack of archival resources. Until only recently, there have been no concerted efforts to conserve Hong Kong's cinematic past. A film archive has now been established in the territory but it remains to be seen whether the work of conserving, restoring, duplicating and subtitling classic works of Hong Kong cinema can take off in any substantial way. In the meantime, a large tract of Hong Kong's cinematic history, particularly the films of the 30s, remains terra incognita. In writing this book, I set out to strike a balance between information and analysis: I have tried to inform the reader for whom Hong Kong cinema is relatively unfamiliar and then to usher him or her into the realm of the films themselves. Wherever possible, analysis is undertaken according to the tenets of auteurism: the theory that a film is made by an author, essentially the director. At the same time, the book offers a contemporary portrait of the territory's cinema, taking into account its historical and aesthetic background, and illustrating it with empirical observations of motifs found in the works of certain filmmakers who may not necessarily have a coherent enough body of work to be labelled auteurs. It also looks at Hong Kong cinema's link to the history and tradition of Chinese cinema as it existed in Shanghai during the golden age of the 30s, thus demonstrating the distinguished tradition from which it came. With the handover on 1 July 1997, Hong Kong cinema comes full circle. If it integrates successfully into the Chinese film industry, it will have the chance to give back as much as it has taken from the tradition of Chinese cinema. In venturing upon auteurist analysis, I am mindful of the frequently stated comment by some formalist critics that Hong Kong cinema * lacks a theory' and that true formalist-auteurist analysis is impossible so long as Hong Kong cinema is seen as inferior and negligible. (I am equally aware that there are theoreticians who believe that the only way an 'inferior' Hong Kong cinema can really be studied is through formalist criticism.) The lack of work in the field means that the task for critics is a complex one: it may involve working out a formula which combines aesthetics and theory to fit the circumstances of development that marked Hong Kong cinema, it may require an analysis of the continuity of themes in the work of a certain director or variations in the many genres of Hong Kong cinema, as well as their evolution into mixed genres, it may mean clarifying the political and social contexts under which films were made. It may even mean imposing a Western theoretical grid on the structures of Hong Kong cinema. The lack of a proper critical and historical perspective on Hong Kong cinema is a liability which I hope to correct in the following chapters. But x\n\nit will need more than just one book to solve the problem. The historical gap is still too wide. The lack of subtitled prints of old classics and the commonly held belief that old Hong Kong cinema is of dubious aesthetic quality has meant that only modern contemporary works have had exposure. The conflict between style and content has arisen partly because of this gap and it may have inadvertently perpetrated the fallacy that Hong Kong movies are unabashedly 'modern' or 'post-modern'. For a time, such a fallacy kindled the notion that Hong Kong movies were startlingly terse, anti-intellectual, non-historical, non-political and without discourse of whatever shade. They could only be appreciated for their surface gloss, their play on generic formulas. Thus, style came to submerge content. Today, the growing popularity of Hong Kong movies has spawned another myth based on the universal principle. Having earned greater recognition, Hong Kong movies are no longer alien; their film language is now easily understood. Western audiences have acculturated themselves to the exotic quality of Hong Kong movies; the Hong Kong cinema is now as universal as Chinese food. When critics address themselves to such generalisations, they are essentially referring to the best crop of works produced by the film industry. Quality is underwritten in the works of directors who may be considered auteurs. My contention is that the nature of this quality is still largely misunderstood. And as Hong Kong cinema returns to the fold of Chinese cinema, the nature of Hong Kong cinema itself may change. My book hopefully prepares the reader for such a contingency. In closing, I would like to thank my fellow critics, Paul Fonoroff, Law Kar, and Li Cheuk-to, for rendering assistance in the formulation and writing of this book. I am grateful to the Hong Kong Urban Council, the Hong Kong International Film Festival and the Hong Kong Film Archive for ultimately making this book possible. I also want to express my appreciation to Mika Siltalla, Paul Willemen, and Ling Mei Lim-Petcher for making constructive editorial suggestions. Finally, I am indebted to my wife, Bea Fung, for her invaluable assistance and support during the writing of this book.\n\nXI\n\nChapter One Early Hong Kong Cinema: T h e Shanghai Hangover\n\nTHE BEGINNING\n\nThe development of cinema in Hong Kong cannot be dissociated from the development of cinema in the Chinese Mainland. Hong Kong was one of the birthplaces of Chinese cinema. 1 It produced in 1909 the earliest tworeeler comedies: Right a Wrong with Earthenware Dish/ Wa Pen Shen Yuan and Stealing the Roasted Duck/ Tou Shao Ya, both adapted from the repertoire of Chinese operas. The director was a Chinese theatre actor-director and amateur film enthusiast named Liang Shaobo, but his producer was an American national, one Benjamin Brodsky, who had established the Asia Film Company in Shanghai. 2 Brodsky had his eyes on the Mainland Chinese market when he started making his films in Hong Kong, thus setting in motion the first linkages between Hong Kong and Shanghai, two cities developing nascent film industries. In 1913, Li Minwei, a theatre director, made Zhuangzi Tests His Wife/ Zhuangzi Shi Qi, an adaptation of a Cantonese opera (Li himself had to play the part of the wife because of a taboo against women appearing in the theatre). Li had founded a dramatic troupe, the Ching Ping Ngok, with Liang Shaobo. Together with Liang Shaobo, his brother Li Beihai and cousin Li Haishan, Li established the Minxin Company (or the China Sun Motion Picture Company) in Hong Kong in 1923, thus initiating the rudiments of a film industry in the territory. However, in 1924, the Minxin Company had re-located to Guangzhou after its application to rent land to build a studio was rejected by the Hong Kong government. They produced a feature film, Lipstick/Yanzhi, which was released in Hong Kong's New World Theatre in 1925. That year, a general strike was called in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. The company was greatly affected by the strike (all film activity including the production and exhibition of films came to a stop) and Minxin once again re-located in 1926, this time to Shanghai. The company was incorporated into the Lianhua Film Company (known in English as United Photoplay Services) in 1930. Li Minwei was an avid documentarist and photographer. He is better known today for his archival footage of Dr Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Nationalist Party (the Kuomintang, henceforth abbreviated as KMT) and 3\n\nleader of the Chinese Revolution of 1911 which toppled the Qing Dynasty and put China in the direction of its republican destiny. In the 1920s, Sun was still leading the revolution: his mission was to unify the country under the principle of tianxia weigong, translated by KMT party stalwarts as 'the goal of great commonwealth'. Li Minwei followed Dr Sun as he went about achieving this goal and, between 1926-8, photographed the statesman in his last efforts to consolidate the revolution through the 'Northern Expedition' - an attempt to rid northern China of its warlords and unify the country under KMT rule. However, Sun died and it was left to his successor, Chiang Kai-shek, to lead the Northern Expedition. Li Minwei's documentary footage of Dr Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek and other KMT leaders has survived as the standard photographic records of the historic personalities of early republican China. This footage may be seen in A Page of History/Xunye Qianqiu, an edited version of the original material shot by Li and passed down to his descendants. Li's backing for Sun's republican philosophy and political aims is the first instance in Chinese film history of a film-maker using the new medium of film to propagate a political cause. It was Li who raised the slogan 'Save the Nation Through Cinema!'. As a producer, Li also supervised the production of fictional feature films, significant precursors of the film industry that would develop: his 1927 version of Romance of the West Chamber/Xi Xiangji (known in export versions as Way Down West), was an outstanding example of a fantasy martial arts genre movie in the silent era. Made in Shanghai, it foreshadows the films of King Hu and Tsui Hark, showing that the early Shanghai cinema is the legitimate precursor of the modern Hong Kong film industry. When the Minxin company became a part of the Lianhua company in 1930, Li personally supervised the production of the company's initial projects: Spring Dream in the Old Capital/Gudu Chunmeng (1930), Wild Grass/Yecao Xianhua (1930) and Love and Duty/Lian'ai yu Yiwu (1931). These silent classics shared the common theme of love in a feudal setting and all three featured Ruan Lingyu (dubbed China's Garbo) in the best parts of her career. 3 The trilogy secured Lianhua's reputation as the most prestigious and important studio in Shanghai. The force behind Lianhua was Luo Mingyou, a Hong Kong-born, Peking-educated theatre manager turned producer. He established the North China Film Company in 1927 and controlled the distribution circuit and theatre business in five northern provinces. Luo had brought together investors from Peking, Shanghai and Hong Kong to start the Lianhua company. Luo and Li merged their companies with a third company, the Da Zhonghua Bai He Film Company, and took in another partner, the printing magnate Huang Yicuo.4 The head office was initially in Hong Kong and the company's largest investor was reported to be the local tycoon Sir Robert Ho Tung, who was named the managing director. The head office was re-located to Shanghai in 1931. By then, it was clear that China's biggest metropolis was proving to be a greater magnet for film talent than Hong Kong. However, the company maintained a branch studio 4\n\nin the colony even as Shanghai became the Mecca of Chinese film-making, initiating the golden age of Chinese cinema in the 30s, with Lianhua playing a major role. The golden age lasted several years, coming to a premature close when China became embroiled in war from 1937 onwards: first in the antiJapanese war, then, after the defeat of Japan, in the civil war between the Nationalists and Communists which lasted until 1944. During the war period, Chinese film production continued in various cities, not least in Shanghai itself. After the fall of Shanghai on 13 August 1937, the Japanese occupied all sections of the city except the foreign concessions which were seized only in December 1941 after Japan's declaration of war on the Western powers. With the first stage ofJapanese occupation in 1937, many of Shanghai's film talents dispersed to Hong Kong and other Chinese cities, but some remained behind in what became known as the 'Orphan Island': the foreign concessions still free of Japanese control. There, Shanghai's filmmakers continued their activities as before but with the Japanese keeping a watchful eye on them. With the city's total capitulation in 1941, what remained of Chinese filmmaking in Shanghai came under Japanese control. The Japanese had built their own film-making facilities in Manchuria and Peking and soon took over production facilities in Shanghai as well. In 1942, they set up a coalition of all film companies under a 'United China' rubric that later came to be known as 'Huaying', the abbreviated form of the Chinese name for the United China Motion Picture Company Limited (or Zhonghua Dianying Lianhe Gufen Youxian Gongsi). Chinese historians and critics under the communist regime have long considered Huaying a 'sham' Chinese company and looked with disfavour on all those who worked for it. The Shanghai film industry under the Japanese has remained a historical 'black hole', the issue being sensitised by post-war political recriminations against those film-makers who had stayed behind to work in Huaying and who were consequendy regarded as collaborators or traitors. Further light can only be shed on this period by research undertaken under more favourable political conditions. 5 As China dug in to fight a war with Japan, film-makers on the Mainland were forced to make films on the move - in Wuhan, Chongqing, Hong Kong. A new genre appeared in Chinese cinema: the 'national defence' movie. These were patriotic war films that recreated images of the Japanese overrunning Chinese villages, committing atrocities, and the heroic resistance of the Chinese against the foreign invaders. National defence movies were made not least in Hong Kong where many film-makers from Shanghai had fled after the Japanese occupied the Chinese sections of the city in 1937. The history of Hong Kong cinema in the pre-Pacific war period is at best a sketchy one because of the almost total lack of extant films. From the sources available, we know that a quite advanced film industry had developed in the colony by the early 30s as the territory recovered from the crippling effects of the general strike which began in June 1925 and lasted 5\n\nuntil October 1926 (the film industry took until 1929 to resume normal production of films). Among the leading production companies were the Hong Kong branch of the Lianhua studio, managed by Li Beihai, which employed directors Liang Shaobo and the Chinese American Kwan Manching, who had returned to Hong Kong and China armed with experience in Hollywood. Kwan was also one of the supervisors of the 'Overseas Lianhua' branch based in America where, in 1933, he and a fellow Chinese American Chiu Shu-sun (also known under his Americanised name of 'Joseph Sunn') founded the Grandview (Daguan) Company. It was Grandview which produced, in America, one of the earliest Cantonese talking pictures, The Singing Lovers/Gelii Qingchao in 1934 (the first Cantonese talkie was White Gold Dragon/Baijin Long, produced in 1933 in Shanghai by the Tianyi Company). The next year, Grandview was established in Hong Kong where it became one of the best-resourced studios in the territory, joining the ranks of the major film companies Universal, Nanyue and Tianyi, all established in Hong Kong a year earlier. Tianyi was perhaps the best known of Grandview's competitors. Originally based in Shanghai, the studio had made its name through its prolific production of escapist martial arts fantasies popular throughout China. However, such films were considered morally decadent in conservative circles (they were certainly not all that well regarded by leftist progressives either) and the government moved to ban them. In 1933, Tianyi had a great success with White Gold Dragon, the first Cantonese talking picture ever made, which was so successful in the Cantonese-speaking regions of southern China that studio boss Shao Zuiweng thought it opportune to move his studio away from Shanghai and closer to the Cantonese world where he could continue to produce his 'morally decadent' pictures in Cantonese to meet the growing demand. He moved to Hong Kong. It not only saved the studio's fortunes but pointed the way for the territory to become a viable centre of movie production. At the same time, it ushered in the era of sound movies. Tianyi, and companies such as the China Sound and Silent Film Production Company (founded by the tireless Li Beihai), led the way in the production of local sound movies which first appeared in Hong Kong in 1933.6 The use of Cantonese was to spark a contentious debate among nationalists and aroused the opposition of Mandarin-language purists. In 1936, the KMT government in Nanjing passed an edict banning Cantonese movies. This was appealed against by Cantonese film-makers in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. 7 Due to the outbreak of war with Japan in 1937, the government, with more pressing matters on its hands, conveniendy closed its eyes to the edict. Cantonese movie producers in Guangzhou, the ones most affected by the edict (Guangzhou had developed into a major centre of Cantonese movie production in the mid-30s) simply moved down to the British-controlled colony, and Hong Kong emerged as the base for Cantonese movies with a sizeable overseas market in Southeast Asia and America. In this way, Hong Kong's film industry counted on the use of Cantonese dialect as a selling point. In 1935-7, it is estimated that a total 6\n\nof 157 Cantonese films were produced in the territory. Before 1935, an average of only four Cantonese films had been produced per year since the arrival of sound. 8 Of the production companies making Cantonese movies in Hong Kong, Grandview occupied the largest studio space and employed some of the most prestigious film-makers, including its founders Chiu Shu-sun and Kwan Man-ching, both directors in their own right. They established reputations as major directors of Cantonese films and exerted an impact on future Cantonese film-makers such as Lee Sun-fung, Ng Cho-fan, Ng Wui and Lee Tit, who were all given their first big breaks as fledgeling talents by Grandview. However, practically none of the early films produced by the company has survived, including the award-winning 'national defence movie' Lifeline/Shengming Xian (1935), directed by Kwan Man-ching. Chiu, who supervised all of Grandview's productions, himself directed the wellregarded national defence movies Hand-to-Hand Combat/Rou Bo and 48 Hours/Sishiba Xiaoshi in 1937, the year when full-scale war broke out between China and Japan. The anti-Japanese war stimulated Hong Kong's film industry as filmmakers rushed to put out national defence movies. As the mainstream film industries in China fell under the control of the Japanese, Hong Kong was the only place where patriotic national defence movies could be made freely (even though the Japanese exerted pressure on the British authorities to ban or censor them). Historians have usually pointed to the outbreak of war on the Mainland as a turning point in Hong Kong's film history. It led to the growth of the local film industry as Hong Kong absorbed migrants fleeing Shanghai. In fact, the migration flow had started earlier, and the historical intercourse between Hong Kong and Shanghai went much deeper than is suggested by the consequence of migration due to the cataclysm of war (although political uncertainties caused by the incursions of the Japanese army into China from 1931 onwards would have played their part). The re-location of the Tianyi studio in 1933-4, triggered by domestic political factors (the threat of a ban on the martial arts fantasies and tales of superstition that were the staple products of the studio), was an event of perhaps greater significance than the migration of directors during wartime Shanghai. Tianyi's move to Hong Kong would see the Shaw Brothers (including Runde, Runme and Run Run) expanding and establishing an empire in Southeast Asia which they oversaw from their headquarters in Hong Kong. The original Tianyi Company evolved into several companies, each more famous than its predecessor. In 1936, a fire destroyed the Tianyi studio and out of its ashes grew the Nanyang Company, managed by Runde Shaw (Shao Cunren) who was recalled from Singapore by elder brother Shao Zuiweng. Runde later re-organised his company into Shaw and Sons. In 1956, Run Run Shaw (Shao Yifu) established the Shaw Brothers studio, the most famous of the various film-making enterprises of the Shaw Brothers. Thus, Tianyi's move to Hong Kong (as well as the cross-Pacific move of\n\n7\n\nt h e Grandview Company) was a prescient o n e , signalling H o n g Kong's vast potential as a p r o d u c t i o n a n d distribution base from which a c o m p a n y like Tianyi (and its subsequent clones) could export their Shanghai-produced M a n d a r i n films a n d H o n g Kong-produced C a n t o n e s e films to Southeast Asia a n d o t h e r key markets with large Chinese communities.

T H E IMPERATIVES O F WAR\n\nW h e n the J a p a n e s e army overwhelmed Shanghai in 1937, H o n g Kong was virtually used as a r e a r g u a r d station for Shanghai-based film-makers until it too came u n d e r the yoke of the J a p a n e s e in D e c e m b e r 1941. Probably the most p r o m i n e n t director to m a k e the southward migration was Cai C h u s h e n g , a Cantonese b o r n in Shanghai. T h e latter b e c a m e the first Chinese film-maker ever to win a prize in an international film festival, in Moscow in 1935, for his Song ofthe Fishermen/Yuguang Qu. O n e of Cai's briefs as an emigre director of the patriotic left was to make anti-Japanese p r o p a g a n d a films from H o n g Kong. H e complied with films such as March of the Partisans/ Youji Jinxing Qu (1938; Cai wrote the script, his Shanghai colleague Situ H u i m i n directed), a n d Orphan Island Paradise aka Devils' Paradise/ Gudao Tiantang (1939). March of the Partisanswas b a n n e d by the H o n g Kong g o v e r n m e n t because of its anti-Japanese p r o p a g a n d a ( u n d e r colonial policy, the British sought to be neutral in the S i n o j a p a n e s e conflict) b u t the b a n was lifted in 1941. T h e film is set in a Chinese village overrun by J a p a n e s e soldiers. A y o u n g m a n , W a n g Zhiqiang (played by Cantonese actor Lee Ching) is injured while trying to organise t h e m e n into a resistance g r o u p .

As part of the p r o p a g a n d a , the film portrayed ' g o o d ' J a p a n e s e characters: soldiers w h o question their involvement in the C h i n a war, a n d t u r n against their fellow soldiers as the guerrillas attack. T h e p r o d u c t i o n of this film r e p r e s e n t e d a significant occasion for H o n g Kong's screen professionals ( m u c h of the cast included Cantonese-speaking actors t h e n making their first impressions o n t h e screen) to work with their Mandarinspeaking cousins from the m o r e sophisticated Shanghai film industry. 8\n\nAlthough the standard line in cinema history books published in China states that Hong Kong cinema only produced 'national defence movies' as a result of the infusion of Shanghai emigres such as Cai Chusheng, Tang Xiaodan, Su Yi, Situ Huimin and others, the fact was that many local Hong Kong film-makers were just as keen as their emigre colleagues to contribute their talents to making anti-Japanese war propaganda films, as is borne out by the Grandview productions directed by Chiu Shu-sun and Kwan Manching. Chiu's 48 Hours was heralded in The Grandview Film News (the company newsletter), as a 'spectacular national defence epic' in which major stars worked without pay and box-office receipts would be contributed to meet defence needs in the front lines. A film made along similar principles was At This CrucialJuncture/ Zuihou Guantou (1937), a voluntary effort by the territory's major stars and directors to raise funds for the Hong Kong Film Industry Aid Relief Association (founded by film celebrities after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, which sparked off the anti-Japanese war on the Mainland). None of these 'national defence' films by Hong Kong's own film personalities has survived. Critical writings have thus tended to focus on those, including March of the Partisans, Orphan Island Paradise and Ten Thousand Li Ahead, which were made by prominent Shanghai expatriates. Orphan Island Paradise, directed by Cai Chusheng, is set in Shanghai during the Orphan Island period. The film centres around a group of young patriots who operate as an assassination squad targeting Chinese traitors and collaborators. In an otherwise tedious propaganda exercise noteworthy only as one of the first Mandarin films ever made in the territory, there is one exuberant sequence in which Cai showed a flash of genius: assassins, dressed in tuxedos and wearing eye-masks, gate-crash a New Year's Eve party and proceed to gun down their victims identified by their devil-horn caps; the sounds of pistols are disguised by popping balloons and drum rolls while the party is in full swing. Hong Kong cinema suffered a kind of inferiority complex particularly when its film-makers were forced to compare themselves with their Shanghai counterparts. Quality and artistry were aligned with the notion of spreading social consciousness or propaganda messages. This was undoubtedly a legacy of the left-wing tradition of Shanghai film-making. However, there were many Cantonese artists who campaigned for higher quality films in the 30s as the feeling spread that Hong Kong cinema was fast sinking into mediocrity as production output increased. Consequently, the 'cleanup cinema movement' gained popular support. Film scholars generally point to three 'clean-up' movements in Hong Kong cinema: the first in 1935, instigated by a group known as the Overseas Chinese Education Association; the second in 1938, initiated by major film personalities (producers and distributors) concerned with the edict to ban Cantonese movies; and the third occurring in 1949, instigated by film-makers who sought to improve the quality of Cantonese movies. The 'national defence films' of Cai Chusheng and other Shanghai directors were indicative of the principles that precipitated the second clean-up 9\n\nmovement in 1938. They were rousing and patriotic. They possessed a national outiook with messages to unite and defy the enemy. The common feature of all the 'clean-up movements' was the factor of outside influences. Hong Kong's film-makers were motivated by events that occurred, and decisions made, outside the territory. The anti-Japanese war in China brought Shanghai's major film-makers to the territory and the interaction between them and Hong Kong film-makers set the pattern of development of the latter's film industry. War resuscitated patriotic and nationalistic feelings among Hong Kong's film-makers and sowed the seeds for the theme of nationalism that would feature in later Hong Kong movies. However, even with the flow of talent from Shanghai to Hong Kong in 1937, the territory did not entirely overcome its reputation as a regional industry, secondary to Shanghai (one, moreover, which produced dialect films). The central government's edict to ban Cantonese dialect films did not help the industry's morale either. Most of the film-makers in this first migration were veterans of the left cinema movement in Shanghai, inspired by writers (such as Xia Yan) who belonged to the Communist Party. In Hong Kong, they were concerned above all else with China's plight in the war. For this reason perhaps, the Shanghai film-makers harboured a certain patronising, even contemptuous, view of Hong Kong. Cai's Ten Thousand Li Ahead/ Qiancheng Wanli (1941) is representative of this trend. Its characters are Mainlanders living in exile in Hong Kong, experiencing hardships and oppression typical of a crass capitalist society. Hong Kong residents are shown as fun-loving, materialistic and indifferent to the calamity engulfing China. At the film's conclusion, the Mainlanders turn their backs on Hong Kong as if to say 'good riddance' and march back to China to help the war effort. Cai himself marched north when Hong Kong fell to the Japanese in 1941. He returned briefly to Hong Kong after the war (to participate in yet another 'clean-up movement' of Hong Kong cinema) but left soon after to become the communist regime's top administrator in film affairs. With the fall of Hong Kong in December 1941, the territory's filmmaking community quickly dispersed, some joining fellow artists in the interior of the Chinese Mainland, others forced to make a living performing live in variety troupes. Before and after the fall of Hong Kong, the Japanese tried but failed to gather together Hong Kong's film artists in another clone of the 'Huaying' conglomerate in Shanghai. Throughout the period of the Japanese occupation which lasted three years and eight months, Hong Kong's film-making community stopped making films altogether. The only film made in Hong Kong during the war was The Attack on Hong Kong/Xianggang Gongliie Zhan (1942) aka The Day of England's Collapse/Yingguo Bengkui zhi Ri, a Japanese propaganda film that featured one local star, the fledgeling actress Tsi Lo-lin, who was flown to Japan to shoot her scenes. The actress later asserted that she was coerced into making the film. The resistance of Hong Kong's film community to make a single film for the occupiers proved so successful that there was no repeat of what happened in Shanghai after the war. There, those film10\n\nmakers who remained behind and continued to make films under the Japanese occupation faced accusations of collaboration with the enemy. In contrast, there was no recrimination, fear and reprisal in Hong Kong. This paved the way for a rapid recovery of the Hong Kong film industry, which once more benefited from a second wave of migration of those Shanghai film artists who were tainted by suspicion of collaboration with the enemy and threats of retribution. The immediate post-war years were marked by a sense of uncertainty. The peace was short-lived and China was torn apart once again by civil war. This produced a further third wave of migration of the Shanghai film community into Hong Kong, including leftists fleeing the 'white terror' of the KMT government and politically unaligned artists who just wanted to flee a city wracked with financial and political instability. This migration wave undoubtedly contributed to the development of a fully-fledged Mandarin cinema in Hong Kong, quite separate from the Cantonese cinema for which the territory was known. Despite the distinctive qualities of each of these cinemas, the industry largely operated on the basis of vertical integration, with film studios or production companies controlling distribution and owning theatres outright. As Cantonese production soared, major Mandarin studios operated their own Cantonese production units. Many stars and directors worked in both Mandarin and Cantonese cinemas. In the final analysis, Hong Kong was still a regional centre for Cantonese movie production. With the migration of Shanghai film talent between 1946 to 1950, Hong Kong would transform into the regional centre for the production of Mandarin movies as well, effectively replacing Shanghai as the Hollywood of the East. THE RISE OF HONG KONG'S MANDARIN CINEMA\n\nHong Kong's film industry as we know it today came into its own only in the 50s as it recovered from the war. The civil war of 1946-9 brought about a further migratory wave of Chinese film-makers from Shanghai to Hong Kong. This time, the talents who migrated were broader and included producers, stars and directors. Two key figures, the producers Li Zuyong and Zhang Shankun, although they had aimed to establish themselves in Shanghai when the civil war had ended, were instrumental in creating a veritable Hollywood in Hong Kong in the immediate post-war years. They established the Yonghua studio in 1947. Zhang Shankun eventually fell out with Li and threw his weight behind a rival studio, Changcheng (or Great Wall), established in 1949. Other Mainland entrepreneurs (theatre magnate Jiang Boying among them) had come to Hong Kong in 1946 harbouring the same ideas as Li Zuyong and Zhang Shankun. They formed a company named Da Zhonghua (or Great China) which started promisingly but folded after making just over 40 films in little more than two years. The majority were Mandarin movies directed by and starring exShanghai luminaries such as Zhu Shilin, Yue Feng, Wang Yin, Butterfly Wu, Zhou Xuan, Yuan Meiyun (all of whom had worked in Shanghai during the 'Orphan Island' days and through the Pacific War). One of the best, a land11\n\nmark of Mandarin film production and representative of the company's commitment to grand production values and glamorous casting in the early post-war period, was He Feiguang's Madame X/MouFuren (1947). The film is notable today for showcasing the talents of its neglected director, He Feiguang, who had worked in Chongqing during the war, making the remarkable 'national defence' film Protect My Country/Bao Jiaxiang (1939). Madam X starred Butterfly Wu, a former superstar of the Shanghai cinema. She plays the eponymous madame, in her own words 'a third-rate Peking Opera actress' who had climbed the social ladder by marrying a warlord. Her old flame from ten years ago, a counterfeiter masquerading as a rich overseas Chinese businessman (Wang Hao), turns up and blackmails her. The production values reflected the sophisticated tastes of its Mandarin-speaking artists who obviously were keen to make an impression on their audiences in order to facilitate the quick recovery of the film industry. The studio's commitment to grand design and excellent performances was borne out in the films Zhu Shilin directed for them. Where is My Darling?/ Yuren Hechud (1948) has elaborate sets, including a rich mansion and a haunted building. The plot centres on the budding romance between a rich man's son and the chauffeur's daughter. Aware of his social status, the chauffeur tries to stop the affair, but the daughter masquerades as a high-class lady to go on a date with the young man who then insists on escorting her home. Not willing to divulge her real identity, she walks into a large house where a night watchman attempts to rape her. There follows an exciting 'haunted house' sequence in which she frenziedly tries to escape from her assailant, being chased through deserted halls and corridors. Zhu's masterly style is evident in his direction of the excellent ensemble cast of veteran character actors, all members of the Shanghai exodus who became a familiar repertory group by way of Zhu's Hong Kong films. The social interplay between the servants evokes Renoir's comedies. The class theme is prominent, with the line 'We are all equal' becoming a leitmotif. Zhu directed four films for Da Zhonghua: Two Persons Unsympathetic to Each Other/Tongbing Bu Xianglian (1946), You're Smart in One Way, I in Another/Ge You Qianqiu, A Dream of Spring/Chun zhi Meng (both 1947) and Where is My Darling?, all of them focusing on women who are made to suffer because of their gender and status. Da Zhonghua's films typified the development of the immediate postwar Mandarin cinema in Hong Kong, their production values demonstrating that they addressed the Mainland market. Essentially, the Da Zhonghua productions were Shanghai movies made in Hong Kong. While they were shot in Hong Kong, the films' characters and settings were usually specified as Shanghai, avoiding any reference to Hong Kong. On the other hand, the fact that Da Zhonghua was based in the territory reflected the uncertain conditions then prevailing in the Mainland's film capital as a result of the civil war. The founders of Da Zhonghua were business people who were hedging their bets, putting their money in Hong Kong and waiting for conditions to stabilise in China before moving back. Like his entrepreneurial contemporaries, Li Zuyong had an inkling that 12\n\nthe cinematic ground of Chinese cinema would shift away from China, but perhaps even he could not have foreseen that Hong Kong would become the centre of Chinese film production for the next two decades. Li's plan in starting Yonghua Studio betrayed the same rear-guard mentality displayed by Da Zhonghua's founders: he also used Hong Kong as a base whence to address China as the main market, intending to return to Shanghai when peace resumed, supposedly under a nationalist government. Li encouraged talent from Shanghai to join his studio, including left-wing film-makers, many of whom were later deported by a jittery Hong Kong government for instigating a crippling strike in the studio in 1952.9 Li's first two films, typical of the producer's ambitious approach, were epics on a grand scale: Soul of China/Guo Hun and Sorrows of the Forbidden City/ Qinggong Mishi, both released in 1948. They dealt with historical subjects, contained themes of national salvation and were made on huge budgets. Soul of China depicts the fall of the Song Dynasty as the Mongols began to engulf China and focuses on the Song loyalist Wen Tianxiang's futile attempts to save the dynasty. His patriotism is portrayed in terms of a morbid preoccupation with suffering and he dies a martyr after rejecting all overtures by the Mongols to win him over to their side. Sorrows of the Forbidden City is a more assured work with a tight script by Yao Ke and efficiently directed by Shanghai veteran Zhu Shilin. The film concentrates on the last decade of the 19th century in which the reformist Manchu Emperor Guangxu was out-manoeuvred by the Empress Dowager Cixi. The emperor's attempt at a palace coup in 1898 failed, resulting in his virtual imprisonment within the Forbidden City by the Empress Dowager, who assumed full power. Both films were released at the height of the civil war between the Communists and the Nationalists, and the theme of salvation and history could not hide a bias towards right-wing conservatism. Wen Tianxiang's steadfast loyalty to the Song Dynasty in Soul of China conjured up a political parallel with the Communist-Nationalist stand-ofF in the civil war. As the film portrayed it, the choice was clear: loyalty to the old regime, and martyrdom rather than capitulation. Although Soul of China and Sorrows of the Forbidden City were released in the Mainland (the latter film was heavily criticised in the prelude to the Cultural Revolution), subsequent films produced by Li's Yonghua Studio were banned, which proved to be a crippling blow for Yonghua. Financial problems in addition to a workers' strike forced Li Zuyong to seek financial help in Singapore and Taiwan. The company was restructured, as was its approach to distribution. Now that China had become a closed market, Hong Kong cinema began to cultivate what would become its 'traditional' markets in Southeast Asia (primarily Malaysia and Singapore), Taiwan and other overseas Chinese communities in the West. With Yonghua's failure to establish itself as the premier studio in Hong Kong, the early 50s saw the dispersal of Shanghai talent into several smaller companies, some of which were managed as film-making co-operatives. The film community in this period was roughly divided between 'left' and 'right' tendencies. Political sensitivities were exacerbated by the 13\n\nCommunist Party's victory in the civil war and the self-exile of the nationalist government in Taiwan. Both the Communists and the Nationalists vied for influence over film-makers in Hong Kong and got their funding agencies to support film companies in the territory. When Yonghua went into financial crisis in 1955, Li Zuyong turned to the Nationalists to bail him out. Left-wing studios such as Fenghuang grew out of a Chinese-initiated co-operative film-making movement known as the Southern China Film Culture Movement which was active between 1949-52. American funding sources also got into the act: the Asia Film Company was established with American money from an agency known as the Tree Asia Association'.10 THE LEFT CINEMA TRADITION\n\nIn the turbulent years following the Second World War (1946-9), the civil war took a spiritual toll on the Shanghai film-makers who had come to Hong Kong. For many, it was like a hangover after a night of bad dreams. Others felt despair and homesickness. Those who had worked for the Japanese-controlled United China Motion Picture Company during the 'Orphan Island' period would have felt a sense of reprieve at having left Shanghai. After the war, a few had been publicly branded as traitors or collaborators in a blacklist issued by the authorities in 1946. Shunned by colleagues in the industry, film-makers who were affected, whether or not their names appeared in the blacklist, found it expedient to leave, prompted by fears of persecution. Others simply felt no compulsion to stay because of the instability of the times and went into voluntary exile in Hong Kong. By 1949, these film-makers were facing the new decade with the realisation that exile was permanent, which showed in their films. Veteran directors from that period, such as Zhu Shilin, Bu Wancang, Ma-Xu Weibang, Yue Feng, Li Pingqian, Gu Eryi, Wang Yin, Tu Guangqi, never quite surmounted the traumatic separation from their native Shanghai. That sense of separation stemmed from the geographic, linguistic and cultural differences between Shanghai and Hong Kong. But the Shanghai directors who took over the Mandarin film industry in Hong Kong in the 50s did not apparendy feel any need to address these differences. They took their Mainland experience and aesthetics for granted. To them, Hong Kong was, at least in aesthetic terms, a carbon copy of Shanghai. However, the Cantonese and Mandarin cinemas remained parallel film cultures. Hong Kong was the natural home of the Cantonese cinema after the war. After all, its residents were native Cantonese. Even among those who were not, the Cantonese dialect was the lingua franca in the territory and had the effect of assimilating all non-Cantonese Chinese families. In the 30s, with the arrival of sound cinema, Hong Kong became the centre for Cantonese film production. By the 50s, the wave of migratory film talent from Shanghai and the newcomers' relative indifference to the Cantonese language and cinema had profoundly modified the Hong Kong cinema's Cantonese identity. The Hong Kong depicted by the Mandarin directors was an abstract, cardboard city, using Hong Kong locations 14\n\ndressed up as the streets and quarters of Shanghai or other northern cities. Characters behaved like typical Shanghai residents, their dialogue laced with Shanghai-isms. The styles, themes and content of Hong Kong's Mandarin films evoked the classics of Shanghai cinema of the 30s. One director who did acknowledge Hong Kong's existence in its own right was Zhu Shilin, although even he could not completely wipe out traces of the Shanghai tradition in his work. Zhu came to Hong Kong in 1946 but not until the 50s did he produce works set in Hong Kong tackling the problems of daily living in his adopted city. In his first years in Hong Kong, Zhu worked for Da Zhonghua (Great China), a company which was, as its name implied, basically eyeing the Mainland market - and so were rival companies such as Yonghua and Great Wall. The films they produced catered to a China-wide audience. In 1948, Zhu directed Sorrows of the Forbidden City/ Qinggong Mishi for Yonghua. Like his colleague Bu Wancang's Soul of China/Guohun, released the same year, Zhu's film was an allegorical work that addressed modern China's dilemma in the civil war. The political situation in the Mainland was to exert an impact, directly or allegorically, on the work of other Shanghai film-makers. While Soul of China and Sorrows of the Forbidden City could be construed as being critical of the Communists by arguing for a vague nationalism to inspire all Chinese patriots, other directors took a more partisan approach. Many of the left film-makers who made the southward migration remained committed to propaganda briefs. The precedent had been set in 1937 during the period of all-out Japanese aggression in China by the first migratory wave of 'progressive' film talent from Shanghai to Hong Kong. The priority then was for the Left to instil patriotic anti-Japanese sentiments to rally all Chinese behind the war effort. In late 1948, a wave of left-wing film-makers arrived in the territory to continue the battle for hearts and minds, since conditions in Shanghai were not conducive to their propaganda designed to win over the middle class and intellectuals to a new United Front against imperialism and feudalism. This wave included Cai Chusheng, Ouyang Yuqian, Shi Dongshan, Wang Weiyi, Wu Zuguang, Cheng Bugao and Gu Eryi. Ouyang Yuqian's Wild Fire and Spring Wind/Yehuo Chunfeng (1948), was produced by one of the more strident left-wing outfits, a small company called Da Guangming (Grand Motion Picture Company). The story is set in Hangzhou during the Sinojapanese war and deals with the back-stage drama of an old teacher infatuated with the beautiful lead actress of a theatrical troupe. It is reminiscent of Sternberg's The Blue Angel, but links that film's theme of moral decay to a quest for national salvation: the narrative charts the slow degeneracy of the central character (played by actor-director Gu Eryi) who descends to the worst kind of moral degradation by engaging in espionage activities to aid the enemy. Gu's performance is the best thing in the film, but director Ouyang's mise en scene and his focus on characterisation are equally impressive, giving some substance to the melodrama. Ouyang was not so lucky with his next film, The Way of Love/Lian'ai zhi 15\n\nDao (1949), produced by another small left-wing company, Nanqun. It is an austere, stagy romance set against the turbulent background of China's recent history: from the Northern Expedition of 1927 to the Second World War. The film's characters are lower middle-class intellectuals, targets of the United Front propaganda strategy; and is typical of the 'petit-bourgeois' romances made by leftist directors who tried to make a point about class distinctions and political loyalty. Zhu Shilin's Where Is My Darling?/ Yuren Hechu, made for Da Zhonghua in 1947, addresses much the same theme but in the form of a comedy. The classic of this type of romance advocating class struggle is Spring River Hows East/Yijiang Chunshui Xiang Dong Liu, made in 1946 in Shanghai, co-directed by Cai Chusheng and Zheng Junli. The majority of the 1948 left-wing migrants returned to China after the establishment of the People's Republic, some voluntarily, others were deported by the Hong Kong government after the 1952 strike at Yonghua. One or two stayed behind, but the left-wing cause in Hong Kong in the 50s continued to advance under the helmsmanship of directors such as Li Pingqian and Zhu Shilin. Ironically, both were considered politically incorrect pariahs by the Left in Shanghai because of their status as 'Orphan Island' film-makers. Nevertheless, these two Shanghai veterans worked for left-wing studios in the territory, such as Great Wall, Longma and Fenghuang. Founded in 1949, the force behind Great Wall was Zhang Shankun, a producer of 'Orphan Island' repute not known for leftist views. In fact, he had felt compelled to leave Shanghai because of accusations of collaboration with the Japanese. During the war, Zhang had produced the infamous Eternal Fame/Wanshi Liufang in 1942 for 'Huaying' in Shanghai. The episodic film told of Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu who disrupted the opium trade in Guangzhou and provoked the Opium War with Britain. Among the many directors recruited to direct episodes were Zhang himself, Zhu Shilin, Bu Wancang and Ma-Xu Weibang. His contacts both in Shanghai and Hong Kong were impeccable and despite a reputation for political ambivalence, he devoted his time and talent to a company which aligned itself with the Left, and mobilised Shanghai talent to join the company although Zhang held no official position in it. In the beginning, the company saw itself as a nationalist studio, producing works in the mould of the left-wing traditions of 30s Shanghai. Although Great Wall gradually acquired a more ideological label and became the leading studio of the left in Hong Kong during the 50s (Zhang left the studio after it was restructured in 1950), many of its artists were not seen in an ideological, austere mould. A star like Bai Guang, a sultry songstress employed by Great Wall under the aegis of Zhang Shankun, was hardly of the austere school. The films of director Li Pingqian, who worked throughout his career for Great Wall, were generally light and frivolous even when they professed to deal with momentous themes such as China's political destiny, as exemplified by A Strange Woman/Yidai Yaoji (1949), starring Bai Guang. Its plot was derived from Tosca. Bai's character is known as 16\n\nXiao Xiangshui (or Little Perfume) who gives herself to a brutal warlord (played by Yan Jun) in order to save the life of her lover, a revolutionary. Any mention of a revolutionary cause in the period would refer to that of the anti-Qing bourgeois revolution of 1911 and the efforts by the Nationalist Party to consolidate its rule over the whole country in 1927 through the Northern Expedition. Setting the story in the pre-1949 era made the point that revolution was a bipartisan cause. The film lovingly creates the mood and decadent atmosphere of Peking under the rule of rapacious warlords. The memorable performances of Bai Guang and Yan Jun (enjoyable as the warlord) give the film a feeling of high camp. Li Pingqian (who also went by the handle of Jack Li) made thrillers, melodramas, opera films and comedies. In comedy, Li is remembered for satires tinged with rebuke against capitalist excess, such as The Awful Truth/Shuohuang Shijie (1950), a screwball farce set in Shanghai during the inflationary last days of the KMT regime, and Tales of the City/Duhui Jiaoxiang Qu (1954), about an unemployed young man who wins the lottery and is fawned upon by friends and foes alike. Of these farces, The Awful Truth is a genuinely zany satire brilliantly scripted by Tao Qin, who became one of the best Mandarin directors in the 50s and 60s. It bristles with an irrepressible pace and energy, mercilessly lampooning the corruption and materialism of a collapsing regime. Its portrait of money-crazy speculators and con-men who cajole, trick and cheat each other has definite contemporary resonances. As Hong Kong experiences integration with China in 1997, the events of the late 40s depicted in The Awful Truth parallel that of China in the 90s: inflation, speculation, decadence and corruption marking an economy beset by unbridled growth exacerbated by government inefficiency and political uncertainty. The Awful Truth is one of Li's made-in-Hong Kong masterpieces carrying unmistakable Shanghai brushstrokes. Another is Laugh, Clown, Laugh/Xiao Xiao Xiao (1960), a tragi-comedy set in Tianjin during the anti-Japanese war which tells the story of an accountant who loses his job but hides the truth from his family, pretending to go to work every day. Together with another out-of-work colleague, he performs xiangsheng on stage (a Chinese form of a stand-up comic act relying on Mandarin patter). His wife and daughter's dismayed humiliation when they discover the truth underlines the traditional low status accorded to stage performers. The film features a superb central performance from Bao Fang as the accountant. Despite his problems, the character remains optimistic and forward-looking. As in A Strange Woman, where Bai Guang gave her own renditions of scenes from Peking opera, the xiangsheng sequences demonstrate Li's affinity with the northern Chinese performing traditions. Being northerners - from the perspective of the southern Cantonese residents of Hong Kong - the Shanghai directors felt closer to traditions which they considered to be representative of Mandarin-speaking culture. The left in Hong Kong, of which Li Pingqian and Zhu Shilin were perhaps the best representatives, branched out into various 50s genres. Directors such as Yuan Yang'an, Cheng Bugao, Tao Qin, Gu Eryi and Yue 17\n\nF e n g e n s u r e d quality a n d style.

Zhu Shilin, who worked mosdy for L o n g m a a n d F e n g h u a n g , b o t h companies which h e h a d founded, tackled issues of m o r e relevance to H o n g Kong in films such as Spoiling the Wedding Day/ Wu Jiaqi (1951) a n d Festival Moon/ Zhongqiu Yue (1953) while also c o m i n g u p with an excellent g e n r e piece in Flower Girl/ Hua Guniang (1951), faithfully based o n Guy d e Maupassant's short story, Boule de Suif. Zhu transposes it to t h e SinoJ a p a n e s e war o n the Mainland: a g r o u p of bourgeois evacuees flees the J a p a n e s e a n d finds itself sharing a bus with a prostitute or * flower girl' (played by Li L i h u a ) . They are s t o p p e d by J a p a n e s e troops whose comm a n d e r o r d e r s the prostitute to s p e n d a night with him. W h e n she refuses, h e holds u p t h e g r o u p , a n d it is u p to h e r to get h e r fellow passengers o u t of their p r e d i c a m e n t by acquiescing to the o r d e r . Like Li Pingqian, t h r o u g h o u t his H o n g Kong career Zhu t e n d e d to alternate between ' e n t e r t a i n m e n t s ' a n d films with a m o r e didactic intent. His m a t u r e work c a m e in the 50s, w h e n h e was well established in H o n g Kong cinema following critical acclaim for the Yonghua super-production Sorrows of the Forbidden City (1948), a b r e a k t h r o u g h in his career. Nevertheless, Zhu's work r e m a i n e d r o o t e d in the classicism of Shanghai's golden age. This influence can also b e u n d e r s t o o d in the light of ideological principles guiding the p r o d u c t i o n companies (Longma, Great Wall a n d F e n g h u a n g ) for whom Z h u worked in H o n g Kong - left c o m p a n i e s working with credit from the Bank of China, o n e of t h e Peking g o v e r n m e n t ' s official agencies o p e r a t i n g legally in the territory. T h e link to the Mainland was therefore m o r e t h a n superficial. With this b a c k g r o u n d , t h e aesthetic link to Shanghai was conspicuous, particularly for the films that could be described as leftwing social classics. In films such as Spoiling the Wedding Day/Wu Jiaqi (1951, co-directed with Bai C h e n ) , Mr Chen vs Mr Chen/ Yiban zhi Ge (1952), Festival Moon/Zhongqiu Yue (1953), House-Removal Greetings/ Qiaoqian zhi Xi (1954), Between Fire and Water/Shuihuo zhijian (1955), Z h u evokes the c o m m u n i t y spirit i n h e r e n t in the social realist tradition of Shanghai as defined by Crossroads/Shizi Jietou (1937), Street Angel/Malu Tianshi (1937) a n d Crows and Sparrow/Wuya yu Maque (1949). With b o t h eyes focused o n social issues troubling H o n g Kong in the 50s, it is remarkable that Zhu never lost sight of the n e e d to p u t h u m o u r into his films. T h e n u m b e r o n e p r o b l e m plaguing the com18\n\nmunity was the h o u s i n g p r o b l e m . T o this, Zhu a d d e d the themes of identity a n d class-consciousness, conditions exacerbated by t h e lowly status of refugee existence. Zhu's characters are exiles in H o n g Kong struggling to b e l o n g to a c o m m u n i t y in transition. His masterpiece, Festival Moon, is a b o u t precisely such an exile (played by the c o m e d i a n H a n Fei, a n o t h e r Chinese exile) a n d his a t t e m p t to maintain a dignified existence in the face of society's humiliations. Zhu is r e m e m b e r e d today as a socially conscious b u t conservative a n d classical director of M a n d a r i n pictures, a view reinforced by his t h r e e last works, The Eternal Love/Tongming Yuanyang (1960), Thunderstorm/Lei Yu (1961) a n d Garden of Repose/Guy uan Chunmeng (1964). All t h r e e were adaptations from theatrical or literary sources. All have d e e p tragic elements. The Eternal Love, the best of the three, tells the story of a y o u n g m a n who gains merit as a scholar b u t fails to live u p to his potential because of rigid social conventions a n d taboos. T h e e n d comes w h e n h e discovers that his m o t h e r , supposedly a widow, h a d n o t b e e n as chaste as h a d b e e n m a d e out. U n k n o w n to the son, she h a d secretly kept a lover by h e r side all these years, a m a n w h o m the son knew as his ' u n c l e ' b u t who was, in fact, his father. Fearing scandal, the son makes all the w r o n g decisions, leading to a tragedy of J a c o b e a n dimensions underwritten by the film's formalism which suggests the rigid structures of a tradition b e a r i n g down o n its characters. His last film, Garden of Repose/Guy uan Chunmeng (1964), was a n adaptation of a Ba J i n novel a b o u t d e c a d e n t a n d decaying families in wartime China. Ever the c o n s u m m a t e artist, Z h u t u r n e d Ba Jin's customary anti-feudalism a n d family-centred concerns into a n intricately designed m e l o d r a m a , shot in wonderful Eastmancolour. T h e vivid colour a n d art direction in the classic style of 'studio realism' are the film's most striking features. A wintry scene is an occasion to design a remarkably o p e n interior set, displaying a snowfall in the b a c k g r o u n d t h r o u g h o p e n windows. T h e characters are indifferent to the weather: indeed, the view of falling snowflakes a n d the positioning of the characters inside the h o u s e are designed to convey n o t h i n g m o r e t h a n the characters' feeling of n u m b n e s s a n d emotionally frigid state of m i n d . Garden of Repose also works well as a m e l o d r a m a , b u t it sinks u n d e r its own weight of ideological didacticism. Its characters suffer a n d behave with t h e typical forbearance of symbolic good a n d bad figures who r e p r e s e n t life's cruel forces a n d its beacons of h o p e . T h e only difference h e r e is that t h e characters seem less optimistic. T h e work is characteristic of that aspect of Z h u ' s classicism which is essentially m e t a p h o r i c a n d symbolic, d e t a c h i n g itself from the realism of the social contexts. Little w o n d e r that the film was attacked by H o n g Kong's left-wing press. In C h i n a itself, t h e director's Sorrows of the Forbidden City was later seized u p o n by Mao-inspired leftists w h o l a u n c h e d an avalanche of criticism against t h e film as a p r e l u d e to t h e Cultural Revolution. N o doubt, Zhu's status as an ' O r p h a n Island' filmmaker, a n d o n e , moreover, w h o worked in the notorious Huaying, did n o t h e l p his defence. Li Pingqian too m a d e his share of such classically symbolic melodramas: 19\n\nMarriage Affair/Men, released in 1951, a n d Forever Waiting/Wangfu Shanxia, released in 1957. Both films followed t h e correct ideological line in d e p r e cating the feudal family, while p r o p o u n d i n g a feminist ideology: the central characters of b o t h films are w o m e n w h o are given a raw deal by men. Li a n d Z h u could b e seen as the finest e x p o n e n t s of classical didacticism. But this was, in fact, a c o m m o n trait in the m e l o d r a m a g e n r e at the time, b o t h in the C a n t o n e s e a n d the M a n d a r i n cinemas, to some extent regardless of left o r right ideologies. T h e inclination to p r e a c h or to arrive at a social-conscience message was a temptation too few film-makers resisted. H o n g Kong was n o t the affluent society in the 50s a n d 60s that it would b e c o m e in the 70s a n d 80s. C h i n a was politically unstable. T h e country preyed o n the m i n d s of H o n g Kong's p e o p l e , m a n y of w h o m were refugees who h a d fled the Mainland, b u t who felt a patriotic a t t a c h m e n t to it nevertheless. H o n g Kong c i n e m a t e n d e d to reflect the conscience of Chinese society at this time. T h e left-wing studios were the quickest to take u p this particular b a n n e r , b u t they were also mindful of the principle of entertaining the masses even while m a k i n g politically r e q u i r e d (and correct) message films. They usually worked in the classical areas of Mandarin-speaking culture, particularly the costumed genres (historical epics, o p e r a films, martial arts swordfighting films), b u t also c o n t e m p o r a r y m e l o d r a m a s , thrillers a n d comedies. Films with c o n t e m p o r a r y settings were inspired by the left-wing tradition of Shanghai c i n e m a circa t h e 30s: classics such as Wu Yonggang's The Goddess/Shen Nil (1934), Sun Yu's The Big Road/Da Lu (1934), a n d S h e n Xiling's Crossroads/Shizi Jietou (1937). T h e s e works impressed Chinese audiences with their social introspection a n d social criticism, qualities which b e c a m e recognised as hallmarks of the left's film tradition equating political consciousness with cinematic classicism. Shanghai veterans who were already working in the 30s, such as Li Pingqian a n d Z h u Shilin, c o n t i n u e d this tradition in H o n g Kong, as did m o r e consciously political directors such as Cai C h u s h e n g , O u y a n g Yuqian a n d others from the 1948 migration wave who chose n o t to stay in H o n g Kong. While Li a n d Z h u came across as t h e m o r e stalwart directors of H o n g Kong's left-wing studios, others, such as C h e n g Bugao a n d Yue Feng, were skilled craftsmen whose early work evoked a leftist conscience b u t w h o gradually t u r n e d to m o r e r o u t i n e g e n r e films. They are r e m e m b e r e d for their realist classics of the 30s: C h e n g for Spring Silkworms/ Chun Can (1933) a n d Yue for Angry Tide of China's Seas/Zhongguo Hai de Nu Chao (1933). Yue F e n g evolved from realism (albeit of the studio variety) in his early years in Shanghai to a m o r e conscious use of style a n d design in his H o n g Kong films for the left-wing Great Wall studio as well as distinctly non-political studios such as MP a n d GI a n d Shaw Brothers. Yue, along with directors like T a o Qin, Yi W e n a n d others of the studio era of the 50s, is o n e of the most under-rated H o n g Kong film-makers. H e was n o visionary, b u t h e was an unassuming, meticulous director w h o a d o p t e d a wholly sympathetic attitude to his characters, particularly w o m e n . It was n o accident\n\n20\n\nthat Yue worked with some of Hong Kong's most memorable female stars: Li Lihua, Bai Guang, Lin Dai and Zhou Xuan. In Hong Kong in 1947, his first films were stolid melodramas: Three Women/San Ntixing (1947), An Unfaithful Woman/Dangfu Xin (1949), The Flower Street/Hua Jie (1950), and Modern Red Chamber Dream/Xin Honglou Meng (1952), all of which centred around women characters and espoused a strong feminist theme. Three Women, produced by the Da Zhonghua company, stars Li Lihua in one of her first films in the territory following a wartime career as a teenage star in 'Orphan Island' Shanghai and the film industry under Huaying. It was Yue Feng, a fellow Orphan Islander and ex-Huaying employee, who had introduced a 16-year-old Li Lihua to cinema audiences by directing her first film, Three Smiles/San Xiao (1940). Her performance as an independent career woman who brings up the daughter of a prostitute in Three Women was one of the most direct feminist statements in Hong Kong cinema at the time. But the film is stilted and heavy-handed, its theme redolent of left-wing Shanghai cinema, ironically made more precious by a melodramatic style. Yue's women are typically portrayed by Li Lihua and Lin Dai, his two favourite actresses who were both adept at exuding strength of character underneath a veneer of feminine charm. They embark on a quest for social understanding and, above all, equal relationships with men. The feminist theme lies at the heart of Yue's films, from the early Great Wall message 'melodramas' such as An Unfaithful Woman and Modern Red Chamber Dream to later, glossy Shaw Brothers films such as Madam White Snake/Baishe Zhuan (1962), Lady General Hua Mulan/Hua Mulan (1964), The Last Woman ofShang/DaJi (1964) and The Lotus Lamp/Baolian Deng (1965). The style and pacing of the films, particularly in his later work for the Shaw Brothers, show a meticulous craftsman at work. The films he made for Great Wall show a director of mellow, classical tastes who was willing to go along with political circumstances and conform to the ideological line of the studio. In this respect, Modern Red Chamber Dream is a fitting example of how a classical director could function within the limits of Marxist ideology. It is a modern-dress adaptation of the classic novel Dream of the Red Chamber. Its main plot - the arrival of Lin Daiyu (played by Li Lihua) to the Jia mansion which is presided over by a kindly but traditionalist grandmother, and Daiyu's romance with Jia Baoyu (played by Yan Jun) - is turned into an ideological tract on feudalism and class struggle. The modernisation of the classic endows the Jia family with a capitalist feature: the patriarch is a financial speculator ever mindful of what political events will do to the stock market. The ending has the Jia family abandoning their household - and Lin Daiyu - as the nationalist regime collapses; the servants and Daiyu gather on the porch to watch the rising of a new sun as the soundtrack brims over with the sound of soldiers marching past. The setting is Shanghai, although the film looks and feels like it could have been set in Hong Kong, no doubt to prick the conscience of Hong Kong audiences. However, like most of the films coming out of the left-wing studios, the attack on capitalism was mitigated by the traditional emphasis on high 21\n\nfeudalism as the left's most conspicuous bete noire. Capitalism and feudalism were portrayed as a way of life that grew out of their mutual embrace: Modern Red Chamber Dream was an example of how the left-wing studios encoded such an equation into their brand of ideological aesthetics. However, the ideological underpinning did not detract from the director's more positive sympathies for the characters of Lin Daiyu and her rival in love, Xue Baochai (played by Ouyang Shafei). In them, both the director and his stars expressed their leanings toward classicism. The ideological straitjacket imposed on the production was clearly an obstacle which hindered the exercise of a modern interpretation of a classic, but Yue showed that he could adapt his own idealism, and his bias for female protagonists, to the requirements of the studio. Yue's adapatability survived his switchover to a non-ideological studio such as Shaw Brothers, for whom he made two splendid melodramas: Street Boys/Jie Tong (1960) and The Deformed/Jiren Yanfu (1960). In these two films, Yue proved his worth as a director with a social conscience even while being employed by a studio well known for its superficial gloss and espousal of the good life. A film such as Modern Red Chamber Dream illustrates an anomaly in early 50s Hong Kong cinema that was an outcome of the exodus of Shanghai talent. The anomaly involved a large degree of expediency in the adjustments of careers and political outlooks. As a result of their southward migration, many stars and directors not normally considered radical first worked for studios that were politically to the left: in this category were stars such as Li Lihua, Yanjun, Zhou Xuan, Bai Guang, and directors such as Yue Feng, Bu Wancang and Tao Qin. These artists became well established in the Hong Kong film industry and many later migrated to Taiwan. They were undeniably idealistic in their younger days. At times, their work conveyed a certain sentiment for regional folk culture or espoused a broader patriotism especially in movies about the anti-Japanese war and other allegorical works dealing with the civil war that called for the audience to take sides. Yue's The Flower Street is representative of that genre of patriotic-nationalist works. The Rower Street stars Zhou Xuan as the daughter of a stage performer, Xiao Hu (played by Yan Jun), who goes missing at the start of the antiJapanese war. The story begins during the Northern Expedition in 1927 (the campaign by Chiang Kai-shek to rid northern China of its warlords and to unify the country under the nationalist government), when Daping (Zhou Xuan) is born. Her name means 'great peace' and signifies the hope that the end of the warlords will usher in an era of peace for China. But the country enters into a period of more turbulence when war with Japan ensues. In Xiao Hu's absence, Daping and her mother are forced into a life as itinerant performers. Then, one day, Xiao Hu turns up as nonchalantly as he had disappeared and resumes his career as a performer, but he falls foul of his own nationalistic pride when he is forced to sing proJapanese propaganda songs. Xiao Hu subverts the lyrics and comes up with a patriotic rendition condemning the Japanese invasion. He is beaten up but survives. The film ends on an upbeat note as war ends and the family is reunited amidst invocations for lasting peace in the country. 22\n\nIn common with films such as Li Pingqian's A Strange Woman (1949) and Laugh, Clown, Laugh (1960), Zhu Shilin's Flower Girl (1951), Tu Guangqi's Little Phoenix/Xiao Fengxian (1953), Li Hanxiang's Red Bloom in the Snow (1956), and Yue's own Golden Lotus/Jin Lianhua (1957), The Flower Street is notable for its evocation of cultural life in the early republican era. Golden Lotus, made for the MP and GI studio, is much superior to The Flower Street, which it resembles. Lin Dai gives a wonderful performance in it as a songstress - the role which Zhou Xuan played in the earlier film but without Lin's stylised mimetic expressiveness in showing all the human senses and emotions. All of these films advocate a nationalism that is a mixture of a newly-found patriotism and a resurgence of Chinese folk culture, here equated with northern forms, styles and dialect. The culture is presented against the background of war when it is perceived to be threatened by Japanese propaganda, lending urgency to its task of instilling morale and pride in the people. Such a tendency among Chinese directors in Hong Kong and Taiwan may be termed 'cultural nationalism' - a term which stands as the opposite of 'cultural imperialism'. 11 The Shanghai emigres were particularly prone to such cultural nationalism because of the perception among overseas Chinese audiences that Mandarin-speaking artists personified the most representative and highest form of Chinese culture. Certainly directors such as Li Pingqian, Zhu Shilin and Yue Feng exploited this perception to show their talents by creating period atmosphere and portrayals of northern culture, the staple forms being Peking opera, as well as various other theatrical and street performing styles. Cultural nationalism is one part of the legacy the Shanghai film-makers bequeathed to Hong Kong cinema. It defers to the purist side of Chinese culture. But as interpreted by Hong Kong cinema, cultural nationalism catered to only one side of the Chinese psyche. The other side hankered for modernisation and the good life, Hollywood-style. Even in their heyday in the 30s, the Shanghai directors were just as prone to delve into Western (meaning Hollywood) styles in efforts to 'modernise' Chinese cinema. 12 Hong Kong cinema naturally benefited from the expertise and sophistication of the Shanghai film-makers in integrating Chinese tradition with the urge for modernisation: cultural nationalism on the one hand and, on the other, a kind of aestheticised materialism. The two-faced nature of Chinese film-making became much more marked in Hong Kong and it may be argued that as the Shanghai emigres settled down to life in the territory, they became adept in juggling these two aspects of cinema which gradually grew to complement each other. T H E RIGHT'S RESPONSE\n\nThe left-wing studios may have believed themselves to be in the frontline in presenting tradition as positive nationalism and modernisation as the great urge of all Chinese. But in truth, the environment in Hong Kong was more pluralistic and the left had to contend, and compete, with other independent studios and companies to the right of the political spectrum. The 23\n\nShanghai film-makers who migrated to the colony reflected the left-right divide that prevailed in the Mainland and, as the left-wing studios b e g a n to make films along ideological lines, they came u p against m o r e consciously right-wing companies purveying anti-communist ideology. Such companies were the right's equivalent of the left-wing studios, operating u n d e r the sponsorships of the Nationalists now based in Taiwan, a n d even American agencies. A representative case was the Asia Film Company, established in 1953 with American funding. 1 3 T h e films of the Asia C o m p a n y r e i n t e r p r e t e d left-wing dramas, t h e m e s a n d preoccupations from a right-wing perspective. H e n c e , a film like Half Way Down/Ban Xialiu Shehui (1955, directed by T u Guangqi) was the right's response to a film like Z h e n g Junli's classic Shanghai t e n e m e n t d r a m a Crows and Sparrows/Wuya yu Maque (1949). T e n e m e n t films, long t h e province of t h e left, m a d e use of slum settings a n d dealt with communities trying to survive in dire e c o n o m i c circumstances. Usually they e n d e d in an affirmation of unity a n d p u r p o s e : to survive a n d carry o n t h e struggle. T h a t structure is a d o p t e d by the makers of Half Way Down which similarly revolves a r o u n d a slum community, b u t its characters are intellectuals a n d former middle-class, 'smart' p e o p l e now living as refugees in H o n g Kong's Tiu Keng L e n g (Rennie's Mill) resettlement centre, reserved by the gove r n m e n t for Chinese soldiers a n d low-ranking officials of the Nationalist government. T h e characters are i m b u e d with the spirit of exile - like the professor w h o carries a p o u c h of Chinese earth wherever h e goes. Such behaviour accords with the standard slogan of t h e Nationalists, 'recover the Mainland', which u n d e r p i n s the p r o p a g a n d a message of t h e film. In o t h e r Asia-produced films such as T a n g H u a n g ' s comedy of m a n n e r s Life With Grandma/Man Ting Fang (1955) a n d Bu Wancang's Chekovian tragedy The Long Lane/Chang Xiang (1956), feudal attitudes are o n c e again attacked. T h e former is a b o u t a g r a n d m o t h e r w h o interferes in the lives of h e r g r a n d c h i l d r e n ; t h e latter deals with a family shattered by a tragic secret: many years ago, t h e m o t h e r h a d a b a n d o n e d h e r baby d a u g h t e r in o r d e r to a d o p t s o m e o n e else's son. The Long Lane is set in Peking a n d o n c e again successfully evokes t h e m o o d a n d a t m o s p h e r e of a n o r t h e r n culture. Life With Grandma is set in H o n g Kong a n d its characters are n o r t h e r n e r s who h a d c o m e to H o n g Kong to escape life u n d e r t h e Communists. They are shown growing used to life in the territory a n d , i n d e e d , b e c o m i n g m o r e Westernised. However, the film h a d to contain a character who is an obsequious traditionalist: a g r a n d m o t h e r (played by W a n g Lai) whose role in life is to r e m i n d h e r g r a n d c h i l d r e n of the n e e d to observe tradition a n d cultural propriety. She is accordingly n i c k n a m e d ' T h e a n t i q u e ' by h e r grandchildren. Perhaps t h e right's foremost cultural-nationalist was Ma-Xu Weibang. In 1949, h e worked for the Great Wall c o m p a n y which, w h e n overseen by Z h a n g S h a n k u n , was n o t the classical left studio it later b e c a m e . At Great Wall, Ma-Xu directed A Maid's Bitter Story/ Qionglou Hen aka The Haunted House (1949), his first film u p o n settling in the territory. A Maid's Bitter Story was his H o n g Kong masterpiece, m a d e with o n e of t h e biggest budgets ever\n\n24\n\ngiven a p r o d u c t i o n at that time (nearly b a n k r u p t i n g Great Wall since it was a box-office disaster). A Maid's Bitter Story offers indisputable proof that MaX u h a d obsessions instead of themes. Born in 1905, Ma-Xu started his career in Shanghai in the 20s, eventually rising to fame with the h o r r o r classic, Song at Midnight/Yeban Gesheng (1937). In 1941, he made a sequel, Song at Midnight, Part 11/Yeban Gesheng Xuji Both films are masterworks in which Ma-Xu grandly displays his singular obsession: the face a n d its disfigurement. T h e h e r o (based o n t h e Phantom of the Opera), is an actor-revolutionary, n a m e d Song Danping, who commits himself to fight feudalism, autocracy a n d warlordism. Song's face is disfigured in a n act of jealousy by a warlord, Song's rival for the love of a landlord's d a u g h t e r . His subsequent p r e d i c a m e n t as a lovelorn ' p h a n t o m ' living in a dilapidated theatre is an i n d i c t m e n t against the c o r r u p t i o n a n d oppressiveness of pre-war Chinese society. Song at Midnight was a hit with Chinese audiences as particularly patriotic y o u n g students identified with a h e r o both physically a n d spiritually d e f o r m e d by the age h e lived in. Ma-Xu (his double-barrelled s u r n a m e being the result of his acceptance of his wife's family as his progenital family; his own s u r n a m e was Xu) was to r e t u r n again a n d again to his obsession with physical deformity in Shanghai-produced films such as The Leper Girl/Mafeng Nil (1939), t h e twopart Qiu Haitang (1943), a n d H o n g Kong-produced titles such as A Maids Bitter Story (1949) and The Python and the Beauty/Dumang Qingyuan (1957). Disfigured faces, animal symbolism, unfulfilled a n d u n c o n s u m m a t e d love, all such motifs a m o u n t e d to a cry in t h e dark, a h o p e for r e d e m p t i o n a n d better days as well as a l a m e n t for China. Ma-Xu's characters were victims of history, of great political events such as war a n d revolution, b u t h e used tragedy only w h e n t h e world a r o u n d h i m was d e s c e n d i n g into chaos. His view of China's fate was essentially pessimistic, understandably so in t h e light of c o n t e m p o r a r y events. T h e face a n d its disfigurement, physical wholeness deformed by spiritual infirmity, madness a n d role-playing, are all motifs developed to t h e hilt in A Maid's Bitter Story. Stylistic traits from Song at Midnight are here too: melodramatic songs c o m m u n i c a t i n g o n e ' s i n n e r m o s t thoughts, Gothic chiaroscuro a n d art direction utilising a Chinese sensibility as in the exquisite set of a Chinese m a n s i o n with waxing-moon motifs (in this respect, the film's alternative title The Haunted House is p e r h a p s m o r e evocative). MaXu's first H o n g Kong p r o d u c t i o n was e n o u g h to qualify h i m as a major talent, b u t h e was n o t always given the c h a n c e to develop in his own way or to work consistendy in the h o r r o r g e n r e . H e h a d an erratic career, slotting t a m e m e l o d r a m a s (with often overt anti-communist messages, such as 1955's New Song of the Fishermen/Xin Yuguang Qu) in between penny-dreadful h o r r o r films. H e was m o r e in control o n Booze, Boobs and Bucks/Jiuse Caiqi (1957), starring Grace Chang, a screwball musical comedy. H e e n d e d u p making Amoy-dialect o p e r a films a n d died in a car accident in 1961. Ma-Xu's best work bears the unmistakable stamp of his personality, even t h o u g h some scenes did n o t work d u e to the technician's carelessness o r lack of skill. His obsessions d o m i n a t e d his films. His characters were exten25\n\nsions of his own personality. Obsessive and preoccupied with personal pain, they stalked empty chambers and hallways, consumed with revolutionary zeal to rescue China, but personal tragedies always got in the way. Ma-Xu was a visionary with a highly refined sense for expressionist imagery, able to find a visual style to match the intensity of his personal obsessions. A Maid's Bitter Story provides a key towards a better understanding of how Hong Kong exploited Shanghai talent and how far such exploitation tied in with the creation of Hollywood-style studios and the contradictory need of some individual talents to go beyond the house-styles of those studios. Ma-Xu eventually had to relent, perhaps realising that the special characteristics of Hong Kong were at last beginning to make themselves felt in Hong Kong's cinema, characteristics that could be defined roughly by the title of his own Booze, Boobs and Bucks. By the mid-50s, the evidence suggests that Hong Kong's Mandarin cinema was beginning to overcome its Shanghai hangover, as Hong Kong's settings and, more importandy, lifestyle began to be integrated into the territory's film. The left-wing tradition became less prominent in the second half of the 50s as the Hong Kong film industry moved towards accommodating market conditions rather than ideological and patriotic imperatives. The left-wing studios had to face up to a right-wing backlash, formally instituted with the establishment of the KMT-affiliated Hong Kong and Kowloon Cinema and Theatrical Free Enterprise General Association which advocated the boycott of left-wing films in the crucial Taiwan market. Economic pressure was put on the left studios to secure market niches other than the China market which began to shrink away. This meant competition with studios of the apolitical right as represented by Shaw Brothers and MP and GI, studios which were soon to monopolise market positions in Taiwan and Southeast Asia. The Hong Kong film industry was moving in the direction of a more conventional and refined glamour industry, producing works that would not risk political censorship in their new markets. In time, the left followed suit. Mandarin film-makers in the early 50s displayed a political ambivalence which the left exploited as cultural nationalism by bringing into play nostalgia and homesickness for the Mainland. The Shanghai film-makers shared a general feeling of goodwill towards their country of birth and if a film expounded on a nationalist theme from a left perspective, none felt compelled to object strongly. Thus, there was no feeling of irony when those stars and directors initially associated with the left later switched to the right as their careers became more established. The most enigmatic figure from this period was producer Zhang Shankun, a man who personified both the business and artistic sides of Chinese cinema during his days in Shanghai and his 'exile' in Hong Kong. Zhang was not a showman in the mould of a Li Zuyong or Run Run Shaw, but a smart operator who knew enough about cinema as art for an aesthetic sensibility to permeate his productions. He was credited with the direction of films which he produced, a classic example being What Price Beauty ?/ Xiao Bai Cai (1954), starring Li Lihua, and co-directed by Yi Wen. 14 The film shows the maturing of the 26\n\nShanghai style in Hong Kong, not as a successful hybrid but as a pure transplant. More importantly, it tells a story with no ideological blinkers despite the fact that it is a story that easily lends itself to different ideological interpretations (indeed, film-makers in the Mainland have made their own version of the story). The setting is the late Qing period when social etiquette and sexual mores were still untainted by the influence of modern thought. Xiao Bai Cai (Li Lihua) is the beautiful wife of a tofu hawker. She and a doctor named Yang Naiwu, are wrongly accused of murdering her husband. Both are innocent of the crime and of conducting an illicit love affair, although the doctor is attracted to the woman. The real culprit is the local magistrate's son who desires Xiao Bai Cai and, when spurned, conspired to take his revenge on her. During their ordeal in court, the two innocent defendants fall in love. They are acquitted; Xiao Bai Cai earns a further pardon from the Dowager Empress which effectively clears her of all social stigma. But instead of doing the expected thing by marrying the doctor, she enters a nunnery. The production is infused with the kind of sedate stylisation associated with the masters. The acting and the black and white photography complement the staid mise en scene, the feeling is one of invocation, sadness and a sense of reverence for the old. The style is half of the message; the other half may be glimpsed in the performances of Li Lihua and Huang He as the wrongly-accused couple: both render performances of quiet passion and genuine pain when they are tortured to extract confessions. In the end, as the truth comes out and they are acquitted, their pain lingers because society dictates that one's loyalty be paid to the past (to a dead husband) and to the community to keep it free from scandal. Hence, Xiao Bai Cai goes to the nunnery and Yang Naiwu is left alone to grow old. It is possible to see how the theme of exile, pain and a reverence for the past could have been more relevant to the right-wing than an ideological batde with the left over issues such as anti-feudalism and nationalism. Zhang Shankun was the right man to show political and ideological ambivalence. In Shanghai during the war, he kept the film industry alive by means of back-room manoeuvres and machinations with the Japanese (and was subsequendy accused of collaborating with them). In his Hong Kong career, he went against the grain to produce works powered by emotion and a moral sense of right and wrong based largely on conservative values. In Hong Kong he associated with left-wing film-makers but later dissociated himself from the left to become his own producer and director. He knew his audience and entertained them with movies which were, as far as he could control, ideologically ambivalent but emotionally true. NOTES 1\n\nThe earliest film activity ever recorded in the territory took place in 1898 when a team of cameramen-representatives from the Edison Company came to Hong Kong on their trip around the world to present Edison's Vitascope exhibitions. The Edison team took cinematic records of Hong Kong Government House, the Hong Kong Regiment, the Sikh Artillery and miscellaneous street scenes. A selection of\n\n27\n\nthese Edison shorts were presented at the 12th (1988) and the 19th (1995) H o n g Kong International Film Festivals. 2 Jay Leyda's Dianying, Electric Shadows: An Account of Films and the Film Audience in China (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1972) is still the only book in English which offers a relatively detailed account of the early history of Chinese cinema. See also I. C. Jarvie's Window on Hong Kong: A Sociological Study of the Hong Kong Film Industry and Its Audience (Hong Kong: H o n g Kong University Press, 1977) which offers a good account of pre-war H o n g Kong cinema. In Chinese, the two standard histories are Cheng Jihua's Zhongguo Dianying Fazhan Shi/ History of the Development of Chinese Cinema (2 vols, Peking, 1963) and Du Yunzhi's Zhongguo Dianying Shi/History of Chinese Cinema (2 vols, Taipei, 1972). 3 All three films were long considered lost but a print of Love and Duty was recently discovered in the Chinese Consulate in Uruguay and brought 'home' to the Taipei Film Archive where it was restored. The film was shown at the 1996 H o n g Kong International Film Festival and revealed to be a masterpiece of silent Chinese cinema. 4 The full name of the company was the Lianhua Production and Printing Company. 5 For a rare account in English of this period of Chinese cinema history, see Poshek Fu's essay 'The Struggle to Entertain: The Political Ambivalence of the Shanghai Film Industry under Japanese Occupation 1 9 4 1 - 4 5 ' , HKIFF catalogue, Urban Council, 1994. 6 H o n g Kong's first all-sound movie was A Fool's Marriage/Shazai Dongfang, produced in 1933 by the China Sound and Silent Motion Picture"
