        "text": "Today families are on the run and I want to help! I understand how daily activities can often become dreaded tasks. That's one of the reasons I got involved in the outdoor/craft industry. Many of my craft ideas transform everyday items into fun solutions and projects\n\nSome people create crafts and projects that look great in the book or on television, but once the instructions are laid out in front of you, the project seems close to impossible. All of my ideas are designed to make your life easier-not more difficult. If you are unable to carry out one of my ideas because it is too hard, then I have failed. My goal is to provide you with fun ways to spice up your life through easy recipes, crafts, camping ideas, and many more creative concepts.\n\nMany people ask me where my ideas come from. I'm sometimes characterized as being a well of creativity that never seems to run dry. My creativity has sprung from the need to problem-solve. For fourteen years, when I was appearing on the NBC Today show and the ABC Home show, the problem was to come up with new ideas for the show every week! This made me stretch my thinking and perspective. Creativity became a habit that is now part of me. I search for new ideas everywhere I go, and I'm always on the lookout for anything simple and clever.\n\nYou can tap into your store of creativity as well! Listen and continually expose yourself to new ways of doing things. Watch for ideas that transform ordinary items into something else. Try a new approach to an old task. You'll surprise your family, your friends, and yourself\n\nI was raised in a time before technology became an integral part of our lives. Because of that, and an insatiable appetite for adventure I have been able to develop the creative spirit within myself. People always ask me how I come up with all my ideas. My answer usually is that I've lived my entire life creatively and it has, quite simply, taken over the way I do everything and become my life's work.\n\nI used the knowledge and love of the outdoors I gained during my childhood to write my first book, Roughing It Easy, in 1974. From there my creative lifestyle spiraled me into the public eye, from appearances on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, to regular segments for eight years on NBC's Today Show, and six years on ABC's Home Show. The time I spent on both of those shows also gave me the material to write and publish eight books that encompassed the ideas I was able to bring into people's homes weekly.\n\nCreativity is not just my life-it's my mission. I believe it is the guiding force to happiness. Being creative is fun and I want to do what I can to make sure the world has as much fun as it possibly can. I want to share that creative spirit with you. This web site and my books contain philosophies that I have used to bring fun and creativity to my family and friends for years. I hope my ideas will help you and your family develop a creative atmosphere in your home.\n\nDave Trottier has sold several screenplays and developed projects for The Walt Disney Company, Jim Henson Pictures, York Entertainment, On the Bus Productions, Hill Fields (for ABC) and New Century Pictures. Titles include Igor's Revenge (produced), Zorro the Gay Blade (produced, but not credited), The Muppet's Hockey Movie-The Comeback Kids (not completed due to Jim Henson's death), Ratman From Saturn, Kumquat, The New Musketeers, and A Window in Time. He co-wrote and co-produced the cult comedy, Hercules Recycled, now available on video. Most recently, he wrote A Penny Promise (now produced), for a regional production company (to be released in 2001), and is in pre-production with A Summer with Hemingway's Twin, an inspiring story about the Hemingway women.\n\nAs a script consultant, he has helped dozens of his clients sell their work and win or place in contests (including two Nicholl Fellowship winners and a National Play Award winner). His book, The Screenwriter's Bible (now in its third edition), is a top seller. He has written a column for Script since 1989, and has published over a hundred articles in Writer's Digest, Hollywood Scriptwriter, Road & Track, USA TODAY, Vision, Disney Channel Magazine, COINage, Gift & Stationery, Single Parent, Creative Screenwriting, and other national publications. He was recently interviewed by American Writer. His short story collection, Dexter's First Date and Other Titillating Tales, was also published.\n\nWith his B.A. in business administration (from Cal-State, Fullerton), Dave has a strong business and management background. He served for five years as the marketing manager and then executive vice president for a distributor of memorabilia and precious metals (about 150 employees). Prior to that, he was in middle management for a large corporation. As a marketing consultant and business writer, his past clients include The Walt Disney Company, Honda Acura, American Premiere, Lucasfilm, Nutrex, Mitsubishi Materials, Ivy Communications, and Citizen America. He edited the quarterly newsletter Precious Metals Today for four years.\n\nDave has an M.A. from Goddard College and is a graduate of both the Hollywood Scriptwriting Institute and the Hollywood Film Institute. He teaches occasional classes in marketing and communications at the University of Phoenix and has taught writing and communications courses at over 30 American universities. He served on the board of the Arts & Humanities Department of Cal-State, Long Beach, before moving to his present home in Utah where he married Virginia artist and educator Marsha Sawyer (1999)."
