Executive Summary and List of Recommendations\n\nThe Commission finds no improvement overall in human rights conditions in China over the past year, and increased government restrictions on Chinese citizens who worship in state-controlled venues or write for state-controlled publications. Citizens who challenge state controls on religion, speech, or assembly continue to face severe government repression. The Commission notes that the Chinese government continued to pursue certain judicial and criminal justice reforms that could result in improved protection of the rights of China's citizens. Yet these positive steps were clouded by new detentions and government policies designed to protect the Communist Party's rule and tighten control over society. These detentions and policies violated not only China's Constitution and laws, but also internationally recognized human rights standards.\n\nThe Chinese government engaged the international human rights community over the past year, hosting visits by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, permitting the International Committee of the Red Cross to open a regional office in Beijing, and committing to a visit by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture in November 2005. During her recent visit to China, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour said, \"China has declared its commitment to human rights and has raised expectations for the country to match its growing prosperity with a firm commitment to advancing human rights.\" Arbour also expressed concern over China's commitment to human rights and raised several political prisoners of concern with government officials.\n\nChina has an authoritarian political system controlled by the Communist Party. Party organizations formulate all major state policies before the government implements them. The Party dominates Chinese legislative bodies such as the National People's Congress and fills important government positions at all levels by an internal selection process. Chinese authorities have introduced limited elements of political participation at the lowest levels of government to enhance their ability to govern. These elements include direct elections for village and residents committees, local people's congress elections, and some popular input into the selection of low-level government and Party officials. The Party controls these selection and electoral processes by screening, and often selecting, the candidates. Chinese citizens are attempting to use the limited political space created by official reforms to protect their rights and interests, but Party officials and local governments often suppress these efforts, leading to social unrest.\n\nAfter several wrongful conviction scandals this year, the central government permitted a broad public critique of the criminal judicial system. This discourse confirmed the extent to which coerced confessions, police incompetence, pervasive presumptions of guilt, extrajudicial influences on the courts, restrictions on defense attorneys, and other problems undermine the fairness of the criminal process. Domestic reaction to the wrongful conviction scandals created new momentum for some criminal justice reforms. Many Chinese scholars and officials continue to push for reforms within the boundaries set by the Communist Party and Chinese legal culture and seek to engage foreign counterparts in this process. The Chinese government continues to use administrative procedures and vaguely worded criminal laws to detain Chinese citizens arbitrarily for exercising their rights to freedom of religion, speech, and assembly. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention noted in December 2004 that the Chinese government has not adequately reformed these practices.\n\nThe Chinese government does not recognize the core labor rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining. The government prohibits independent labor unions and punishes workers who attempt to establish them. Wage and pension arrears are among the most important problems that Chinese workers face. The government issued new regulations seeking to address the problem of unpaid wages and pensions, but in many cases Chinese workers continue to struggle to collect wages and benefits because the relevant agencies do not enforce the regulations. Workplace health and safety conditions are poor for millions of Chinese workers. China's state-run news media have reported, with some exceptions, workplace accidents more openly and promptly than in previous years, even when workers have been killed or injured. Forced labor is an integral part of the Chinese administrative detention system, and child labor remains a significant problem in China, despite being prohibited by law.\n\nThe Chinese government continues to harass, abuse, and detain religious believers who seek to practice their faith outside state-controlled religious venues. Religious believers who worship within state-controlled channels are subject to government regulation of all aspects of their faith. In 2005, the government and Party launched a large-scale implementation campaign for the new Regulation on Religious Affairs to strengthen control over religious practice, particularly in ethnic and rural areas, violating the guarantee of freedom of religious belief found in the new Regulation.\n\nThe religious environment for Tibetan Buddhism has not improved in the past year. The Party demands that Tibetan Buddhists promote patriotism toward China and repudiate the Dalai Lama, the religion's spiritual leader. The intensity of religious repression against Tibetans varies across regions, with officials in Sichuan province and the Tibet Autonomous Region currently implementing Party policy in a more aggressive manner than officials elsewhere. Sichuan authorities sometimes impute terrorist motives to Tibetan monks who travel to India without permission.\n\nThe Chinese government continues to repress Catholics. Chinese authorities are currently detaining over 40 unregistered clergy and have taken measures this year to tighten control of registered clergy and seminaries. Despite assurances of its desire to establish diplomatic relations with the Holy See, the Chinese government has not altered its long-standing position that, as a precondition to negotiations, the Holy See must renounce a papal role in the selection of bishops and break relations with Taiwan.\n\nThe government continues to strictly regulate Muslim practices, particularly among members of the Uighur minority. All mosques in China must register with the state-run China Islamic Association. Imams must be licensed by the state before they can practice, and must regularly attend patriotic education sessions. Religious repression in Xinjiang is severe, driven by Party policies that equate peaceful Uighur religious practices with terrorism and extremism.\n\nIn the past year, the Chinese government continued a campaign begun in 2002 that focused on harassing and repressing unregistered Protestant groups and consolidating control of registered Protestants. Hundreds of unregistered Protestants associated with house churches have been intimidated, beaten, or imprisoned. The Chinese government opposes the relationships that many unregistered Protestant house churches have developed with co-religionists outside China.\n\nChinese non-profit associations and organizations are growing in number and engaging in valuable educational work and issue advocacy. While some ministries and local governments support these groups, some high-level leaders consider the emergence of an independent civil society a threat to government and Party control. Central authorities use regulations to limit and control the development of civil society in China, forcing many groups to remain unregistered or operate underground. In 2005, Chinese authorities moved to curtail the activities of international and domestic civil society organizations, particularly environmental groups that challenged government policies.\n\nChinese judicial officials announced ambitious reform goals in 2005 that would address structural problems affecting the Chinese judiciary. These include changes to court adjudication committees, the system of people's assessors, and judicial review of death penalty cases. Party authorities and local governments, however, continue to limit the independence of China's courts. Internal administrative practices of Chinese courts also compromise judicial efficacy and independence. The Chinese judiciary has improved the educational level of Chinese judges and the quality of their judicial opinions. Rural courts, however, are rapidly losing judges to urban areas.\n\nThe Chinese government does not respect the freedom of speech and freedom of the press guaranteed in China's Constitution. Chinese authorities allow government-sponsored publications to report selectively on information that, in previous decades, officials would have deemed embarrassing or threatening. But in the past year, officials have become less tolerant of public discussion that questions central government policies. Chinese authorities have tightened restrictions on journalists, editors, and Web sites, and continue to impose strict licensing requirements on publishing, prevent citizens from accessing foreign news sources, and intimidate and imprison journalists, editors, and writers.\n\nConstitutional enforcement remains a politically sensitive topic in China, and the near-term prospects for the establishment of a more robust constitutional enforcement mechanism are remote. The Chinese government has ruled out establishing a constitutional court or giving people's courts the power to review the constitutionality of laws and regulations, but has affirmed the right of citizens to petition the National People's Congress Standing Committee for review of regulations that violate the Constitution or national law. The effect of this right remains limited, however, since Chinese citizens have no right to compel such review or to challenge the constitutionality of government actions. The Chinese government has enacted laws to curb administrative abuses, but Chinese officials retain significant administrative discretion. Existing legal mechanisms provide only limited checks on arbitrary or unlawful government actions.\n\nMinorities that are willing to accept state controls and the official depiction of their ethnic groups and histories have been able to preserve their cultures while joining Party and government ranks. Minorities that demand greater effective autonomy and control over their cultural identities, however, regularly confront government policies that violate the Constitution and the Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law. Government policy in Tibetan areas and in Xinjiang most often contravenes the Chinese Constitution and law. The government grants minorities in southwest China that have accepted central authority, like the Zhuang, Yao, and Yi, more freedom to exercise their lawful rights. Since 2000, China's autonomous regions have experienced increased economic output and improved transportation and communication networks, but central control over development policy and financial resources has weakened economic autonomy in minority areas and disproportionately favored Han Chinese in Tibetan, Uighur, and other border areas. Central government investment has expanded educational access for minorities since 1949, though minority literacy rates and levels of educational attainment remain below those of the Han. Government-sponsored Han migration to minority areas has exacerbated ethnic tensions, particularly in Tibetan areas, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia.\n\nThe Chinese government promotes conservation, recycling, and the use of renewable energy sources to address environmental degradation and the depletion of natural resources. Weak environmental laws, poor enforcement, and small government budgets for environmental protection hamper these efforts. The Chinese government promotes international cooperation on environmental matters and is receiving foreign technical assistance for environmental projects in China.\n\nThe Chinese Constitution and laws provide for the equal rights of women, and a network of women's groups advocate to protect women's rights. But Chinese women have fewer employment opportunities than men, and their educational levels fall below those of men. The government has acknowledged these gender discrepancies and is taking steps to promote women's interests. Chinese women face increasing risks from HIV/AIDS as the disease moves from high-risk groups dominated by men into the general population.\n\nTrafficking of women and children in China remains pervasive despite government efforts to build a body of domestic law to address the problem. China's population control policies exacerbate the trafficking problem. China's poorest families, who often cannot afford to pay the coercive fines that the government assesses when it discovers an extra child, often sell or give infants, particularly female infants, to traffickers.\n\nThe two greatest public health challenges facing China today are infectious diseases and rural poverty. The central government is taking steps to improve the public health infrastructure in rural areas, but China's poor lack preventive healthcare, and weak implementation of laws that provide for free vaccinations leave many adults and children unprotected. Central government efforts to address China's HIV/AIDS epidemic continue to expand and deepen, but local governments often harass Chinese activists who work on HIV/AIDS issues. Government controls inhibit the flow of health-related information to the public, potentially affecting public health in China as well as international disease monitoring and response efforts.\n\nThe Chinese government continues its population control policy, which is scheduled to continue through the mid-21st century. Coercive fines are the main enforcement mechanism, although reports of local officials using physical coercion to ensure compliance continue, even though this practice violates Chinese law. The severe gender imbalance resulting from the population control policy has grown worse over the past two decades. The Chinese government has established a commission to draft legislation to criminalize sex-selective abortion.\n\nNational and local authorities are gradually reforming China's household registration (hukou) system. In 2005, central authorities took some steps toward removing work restrictions on migrants in urban areas, but hukou discrimination in public services remains prevalent. Hukou reforms are enhancing the ability of wealthy and educated citizens to choose their place of permanent residence, but strict economic criteria often exclude poor rural migrants living in urban areas, preventing some of China's most vulnerable citizens from receiving public services.\n\nChinese citizens resort to thousands of \"letters and visits\" (xinfang) offices for redress of their grievances because of deficiencies in the legal system and the absence of alternative channels for political participation, but only a small fraction of their appeals are resolved. Citizen frustration is finding an outlet in collective petitions that take the form of mass demonstrations or strikes. Because Chinese authorities punish local officials more severely for large protests, citizens think that collective petitioning is more likely to gain results. The government passed new regulations in 2005 designed to make the xinfang system more responsive to citizen complaints, but these regulations also expand the role of xinfang offices and the incentive for citizens to resort to collective petitioning.\n\nThe Dalai Lama has said that he does not seek independence and aims for a solution based on Tibetan autonomy within China. But China's leaders do not seem to recognize the benefits of moving forward in the dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his envoys. Chinese laws on regional ethnic autonomy contain provisions that could benefit Tibetans and their culture, but poor government implementation of these laws largely negates their potential value. Chinese government statistics suggest that Tibetans are not yet prepared to compete in the economic and ethnic environment created by central government policies. The Tibetan rate of illiteracy is five times higher than China's national average. Most Tibetans do not have access to a bilingual education system that can impart skills to help them compete for employment and other economic benefits. Chinese laws and official statements lend credibility to Tibetan concerns that programs such as Great Western Development and projects such as the Qinghai-Tibet railroad will lead to large increases in Han migration. The rights of Tibetans to their constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of religion, speech, and assembly are subject to strict constraint. Government officials persecute prominent Tibetans, especially religious leaders, believed to have links to the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe Chinese government forcibly repatriates North Koreans seeking refuge in China from starvation and political persecution, contravening its obligations to handle refugees as required by the 1951 Convention Related to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. The Chinese government classifies all North Koreans in China as \"illegal economic migrants\" and denies the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) access to this vulnerable population. Living conditions of North Koreans in China are harsh, and women and children are particularly vulnerable to trafficking and prostitution. There is a compelling case for the Chinese government to recognize the North Koreans in China as refugees and allow the UNHCR access to them: the North Korean government regularly denies food to particular groups on political grounds, and refugees returned to North Korea face long prison terms, torture, or execution.\n\nThe Hong Kong people continue to enjoy an open society in which the freedoms of religion, speech, and assembly are respected, but the Commission is troubled by a continuing pattern of central government interference in Hong Kong local governance through interpretations of the Basic Law. The Commission emphasizes its belief in the importance of the central government's obligation to give Hong Kong the \"high degree of autonomy\" promised in the Basic Law and strongly supports the provisions of the Basic Law that provide for the chief executive and the entire legislature to be elected through universal sufferage. The Hong Kong judiciary demonstrated its continued independence by protecting the right of citizens to demonstrate in a case overturning the convictions of eight Falun Gong practitioners, despite the central leadership's ongoing campaign to eliminate the Falun Gong movement.\n\nThe Chinese government tolerates intellectual property infringement rates that are among the highest in the world, and has not introduced criminal penalties sufficient to deter intellectual property infringement. Steps taken by Chinese agencies in the past 12 months to improve the protection of foreign intellectual property have not produced any significant decrease in infringement activity. The Chinese government has made progress in bringing its laws into compliance with its WTO commitments. Although significant flaws remain, the new body of commercial laws has improved the business climate for foreign companies in China. With new, more transparent rules, the Chinese trade bureaucracy has reduced regulatory and licensing delays. The government has not fully implemented the key WTO principles of national treatment, non-discrimination, and transparency in such areas as distribution and agriculture. To address these problems, the Chinese government must continue economic reforms, establish a more transparent and consistent regulatory and licensing system, implement and enforce distribution rights for foreign companies, and strengthen enforcement of intellectual property laws.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe Commission is working to implement the recommendations made in the 2002, 2003, and 2004 Annual Reports until they are achieved. Based on the findings presented in this report and the Commission's belief that the United States must continue to pursue a dual policy of high-level advocacy on human rights issues and support for legal reform efforts, the Commission makes the following additional recommendations to the President and the Congress for 2005:\n\nHuman Rights for China's Citizens\n\nThe Commission's Political Prisoner Database is a unique resource for promoting human rights in China. Members of Congress should use the Database to support their own advocacy of political and religious prisoners in China, and should ask official and private delegations traveling to China to present officials there with lists of political and religious prisoners derived from the Database. Members should also urge state and local officials and private citizens involved in sister-state and sister-city relationships with China to use the Database to build new advocacy efforts for the release of political and religious prisoners.\n\nRecent Chinese government regulations on implementing the Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law require all local governments to draft and implement measures to protect minority rights and to teach citizens about their rights under this law. The President should propose, and the Congress should appropriate, funds for U.S.-based NGOs to provide legal and technical training to assist in these efforts. The President and the Congress should continue to urge Chinese officials not to use the global war against terrorism as a pretext to suppress minorities' legitimate, peaceful aspirations to exercise their rights protected by the Chinese Constitution and the Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law.\n\nTrafficking of women and children in and through China remains pervasive despite government efforts to address the problem. The Chinese government is collaborating with UN agencies and has adopted national measures to control human trafficking, principally by passing criminal laws to punish traffickers and giving public security bureaus the chief responsibility for the elimination of trafficking. The President and the Congress should continue to support international programs to build law enforcement capacity to prevent trafficking in and through China, and should develop and fund additional programs led by U.S.-based NGOs that focus on the protection and rehabilitation of victims, especially legal and educational assistance programs.\n\nChina's leaders rank social stability as a key priority and have taken some top-down measures to address abusive official behavior that contributes to social unrest. The President and the Congress should encourage the Chinese government to continue these positive steps, but should also press the Chinese leadership for the kinds of bottom-up changes that will ensure a stable future for China, including (1) expanding popular participation in politics by curbing the discretion of election committees; (2) lifting current restrictions on civil society by removing the sponsor organization requirement; (3) removing restrictions on the news media; (4) giving Chinese citizens the power to enforce constitutional protections; (5) and taking decisive steps to make the judiciary independent.\n\nThe future of Tibetans and their religion, language, and culture depends on fair and equitable decisions about future policies that can only be achieved through dialogue. The Dalai Lama is essential to this dialogue. To help the parties build on visits and dialogue held in 2003, 2004, and 2005, the President and the Congress should urge the Chinese government to move the current dialogue toward deeper, substantive discussions with the Dalai Lama or his representatives, and encourage direct contact between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese leadership.\n\nReligious Freedom for China's Faithful\n\nThe freedom to believe and to practice one's religious faith is a universal and essential right, and the Chinese leadership should allow true freedom of religion for all Chinese citizens. The President and the Congress should foster and support the development of the freedom of religion in China by continuing longstanding U.S. diplomacy on the importance of religious freedom, and urging Chinese government engagement with the UN Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance and a continuing dialogue with the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom.\n\nThe new Regulation on Religious Affairs adopted in 2005 permits religious organizations to run social welfare enterprises and religious believers and organizations to challenge official violations of their rights. The President should propose, and the Congress should appropriate, funds to permit U.S. NGOs to help develop voluntary, independent social welfare projects and educational initiatives run by religious organizations. The President should also propose, and the Congress should fund, appropriate U.S. legal advocacy organizations to help Chinese believers understand their rights and seek redress for official violations of these rights.\n\nLabor Rights for China's Workers\n\nU.S. law prohibits imports into the United States of forced labor products and the Commission is concerned that products resulting from forced labor in China may be reaching the United States. The President should direct the China Prison Labor Task Force created under Title V of Public Law 106-286 to establish an electronic database of sites in China known to be forced labor camps or production facilities. Imports into the United States of products manufactured in whole or part in facilities listed in this database should be presumptively considered to be the products of forced labor as defined in Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, until an inspection by U.S. customs officials determines otherwise.\n\nWage and pension arrears are growing problems in China and cause labor unrest. The President and the Congress should support exchange and training programs with Chinese organizations on orderly systems of wage and pension payments, including the collection and payment of outstanding wages and pensions.\n\nFree Flow of Information for China's Citizens\n\nThe rights to freedom of speech and freedom of the press are internationally recognized and are guaranteed in the Chinese Constitution, but Chinese citizens generally do not know that they have these rights. The President should propose, and the Congress should appropriate, funds to support U.S. programs to develop technologies that would help Chinese citizens access Internet-based information currently unavailable to them, as well as educational materials about their rights under international law to freedom of speech and freedom of the press.\n\nThe Chinese government uses technology, prior restraints, intimidation, detention, imprisonment, and vague and arbitrarily applied censorship regulations to suppress free expression and control China's media. The President and the Congress should urge the Chinese government to eliminate prior restraints on publishing, cease detaining journalists and writers, stop blocking foreign news broadcasts and Web sites, and specify precisely what kind of political content is illegal to publish.\n\nRule of Law and Civil Society\n\nThe Chinese government forcibly repatriates North Koreans seeking refuge in China and denies the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) access to this vulnerable population, contravening its obligations under the 1951 Convention Related to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, as well its 1995 Agreement with the United Nations. The President and the Congress should press the Chinese government to uphold its international agreements and grant the UNHCR unimpeded access to screen North Koreans' refugee petitions.\n\nThe Resident Legal Advisor at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing has provided important analysis of legal reform developments in China and coordination for legal exchanges between the United States and China. Despite this important role, the Advisor position has no permanent funding source. The President and the Congress should work to create a permanent Resident Legal Advisor position at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.\n\nThe Chinese government has developed a new body of commercial law since acceding to the WTO in 2001, but many Chinese officials, judges, and lawyers have not been trained on the new laws and do not understand the legal principles. The President should propose, and Congress should fund, a technical assistance program for Chinese officials conducted by the Commercial Law Development Program at the U.S. Department of Commerce. The program should emphasize effective methods of criminal enforcement of intellectual property rights given the persistently high levels of piracy and counterfeiting; the consistent application of trade-related measures at different levels of government; techniques to improve transparent procedures in governance; and the implementation of the key WTO principles of national treatment, non-discrimination, and transparency.\n\nThe Commission's Executive Branch members have participated in and supported the work of the Commission, including the preparation of this report. The views and recommendations expressed in this report, however, do not necessarily reflect the views of individual Executive Branch members or the Administration.\n\nThis report was approved by a vote of 18 to 1, with 1 answering \"present.\"†\n\n† Voted to approve: Senators Hagel, Smith, DeMint, Martinez, Baucus, Levin, Feinstein, Dorgan; Representatives Leach, Dreier, Wolf, Pitts, Aderholt, Levin, Kaptur, and Brown; Deputy Secretary Law, and Under Secretary Dobriansky.\n\nVoted not to approve: Senator Brownback.\n\nAnswered \"present\": Representative Honda.\n\n总结和建议\n\n本委员会认为，中国的人权状况过去一年来整体上没有改进，政府加强了对中国公民在政府控制场所进行宗教活动或者为政府控制的出版物撰文的的限制。政府继续对挑战国家控制宗教、言论或集会的公民严厉镇压。本委员会同时也注意到，中国政府继续进行了一些司法和刑事诉讼改革，这些改革可能会改善对中国公民权利的保护。然而，这些积极措施又因为政府继续拘留一些人，并且制定旨在保护共产党统治以及加强社会控制的政策而蒙上阴影。这些拘留行为和政策不仅违反了中国的宪法和法律，而且也违反了国际社会公认的人权标准。\n\n中国政府在过去一年里和国际人权社会进行了接触，接待了联合国人权委员会任意拘禁问题工作组、联合国人权事务高级专员以及美国国际宗教自由委员会，允许国际红十字会在北京开设地区办公室，并且同意让联合国酷刑问题特别报告员在2005年11月到中国访问。联合国人权事务高级专员路易丝· 阿伯最近访问中国时说，“中国表示决心致力于改善人权，这种表示进一步提高了国际社会对中国在推动人权方面的坚定承诺和它日益繁荣的局面相对称的期望。” 阿伯还向中国政府官员表示他对中国在人权问题上的决心的关注，并提到了有关几个政治犯的案子。\n\n中国有一个共产党一党专制的政治体系。党组织制定所有重大的国家政策，然后由政府贯彻执行。共产党控制中国的立法机构，如全国人民代表大会等，并通过内部挑选的方法任命各级政府的重要职位。中国当局在基层政府实行了有限的政治参与，以加强党的执政能力。这些活动包括村委会和居民委员会直接选举、地方人大选举以及在选拔基层政府与党干部时听取一些群众意见。党组织通过甄别，甚至内定候选人的方法来控制这些选举程序。中国公民试图利用政府改革所创造的有限政治空间来保护他们的权益，但是党干部和地方政府常常压制这些意图，从而导致社会动乱。\n\n在今年发生了几起错误定罪丑闻后，中央政府允许公众广泛地对刑事诉讼系统进行公开批评。这证实了刑讯逼供、警察不胜任、普遍实行有罪推定、对法院施加来自司法机构之外的影响、对辩护律师的限制等现象在损害中国刑事诉讼程序的公正性方面达到了什么程度。中国国内对错误定罪丑闻的强烈反应为一些刑事诉讼改革提供了新的推动力。许多中国学者和官员在共产党所设的界限内以及中国法律文化的局限内继续推动改革，并且在这个过程中寻求与国外学者和官员进行接触。中国政府继续使用行政手段以及措辞含糊的刑法任意拘禁那些行使宗教、言论和结社自由权利的中国公民。联合国人权委员会任意拘留问题工作组在2004年12月指出，中国政府还没有对这些做法进行充分的改革。\n\n中国政府不承认自由结社和集体谈判等劳工的基本权利。政府禁止工人成立独立工会，惩罚试图组织独立工会的工人。中国工人所面临的最大问题包括拖欠工资和退休金。政府颁布了新的规定，寻求解决拖欠工资和退休金问题，但是在许多情形下，由于相关部门不贯彻执行这些规定，中国工人继续为追讨工资和福利金费尽周折。数以百万计的中国工人在卫生和安全条件恶劣的工作场所工作。除了一些例外，中国官方新闻媒体对工作场所事故的报道比前几年更加开放和及时，其中甚至还包括工伤死亡事故。强制劳动是中国行政拘留系统的一个组成部分。虽然中国法律禁止使用童工，但是这仍然是一个严重问题。\n\n中国政府继续骚扰、虐待和拘禁那些寻求在政府控制的宗教场所外从事宗教活动的信仰者。在政府控制系统内从事宗教活动的信仰者则必须服从政府对其信仰的各个方面所做的规定。2005年，政府和共产党为实施新的《宗教事务条例》发起了一场大规模运动，目的在于加强对宗教活动的控制，特别是在少数民族和农村地区，从而违反了新《条例》中所保证的宗教信仰自由。\n\n过去一年来，藏传佛教的宗教环境没有得到改善。共产党要求藏族佛教信徒发扬对中国的爱国主义精神，揭发批判他们精神领袖达赖喇嘛。对藏人的宗教压制程度各地区不同，四川省和西藏自治区官员目前在贯彻共产党政策上比其它地区的官员更为严厉。四川省当局有时指责那些未获许可而前往印度的藏族喇嘛有恐怖分子的嫌疑。\n\n中国政府继续压制天主教教徒。中国当局目前拘押着40多名未经登记的牧师，还在今年采取措施对登记的牧师和神学院加强控制。中国政府虽然表明有愿望和梵蒂冈建立外交关系，但是并没有改变长期以来的立场，也就是，作为谈判的前提，梵蒂冈不能在选拔中国主教的问题上参与意见，并且必须和台湾断绝关系。\n\n中国政府继续严格管制穆斯林的活动，对维吾尔少数民族尤其如此。中国所有的清真寺必须向官方的中国伊斯兰教协会登记。阿訇在任职前必须得到政府许可，而且必须定期参加有关爱国主义教育的学习班。宗教压制在新疆很严重，这是因为共产党的政策把维吾尔族人从事的和平宗教活动与恐怖主义和极端主义相提并论。\n\n过去一年来，中国政府继续进行2002年开始的一项运动，重点在于骚扰和打击未经登记的基督教新教组织，并加强控制已登记的新教徒。成百名未登记的家庭教会新教徒受到恐吓、殴打或监禁。中国政府反对许多未登记的家庭教会和境外教友所发展起来的关系。\n\n中国非盈利性社团和组织的数量正在增加，它们从事可贵的教育工作和积极倡导某些议题。虽然一些部门和地方政府支持这些组织，但是一些高层领导人认为，一个独立的民间社会的崛起对政府和共产党的控制构成威胁。中央当局制订规章，限制和控制民间社会在中国的发展，导致许多组织不进行登记或者转入地下运作。2005年，中国当局采取行动，限制国际组织和国内民间社会组织的的活动，尤其是对政府政策提出挑战的环境保护组织的活动。\n\n中国司法官员在2005年宣布了雄心勃勃的改革目标，旨在解决影响中国司法系统的结构问题，其中包括对法院审判委员会、人民陪审员制度以及死刑案件司法复核程序的改革。然而，党组织和地方政府继续限制中国法院的独立性，中国法院内部的行政运作也损害到司法的功效和独立性。中国司法部门提高了法官的教育和判决的水平，但是农村地区法院的法官正在迅速流往城市地区。\n\n中国政府不尊重中国宪法保障的言论自由和出版自由。中国当局允许官方出版物有选择地报道过去几十年里被认为是难堪的或者构成威胁的信息。但是过去一年来，官员又收紧了对中央政府政策提出质疑的公共讨论。中国当局加强了对记者、编辑以及互联网站的限制，继续对出版实施严格的许可证制度，阻止公民获得国外新闻来源提供的消息，恐吓和监禁记者、编辑和作者。\n\n宪法的实施在中国仍然是一个敏感的政治话题，在近期内建立起一个生机勃勃的宪法实施机制还很渺茫。中国政府排除了建立一个宪法法庭的可能性，也不会给予人民法院审查法律和规章是否合乎宪法的权力，但是允许公民向全国人民代表大会常务委员会提出请愿，要求对违反宪法或国家法律的规章进行审查。不过，这一权利的作用仍然十分有限，因为中国公民没有权利迫使人大常委会进行这样的审查，也没有权利对政府行为是否合乎宪法提出异议。中国政府通过法律，制止滥用行政职权，但是中国官员在行政方面仍然拥有很大的自行决定权。现行的法律机制只能有限地约制政府的武断或违法行为。\n\n那些愿意接受政府控制、接受官方对其民族及历史描述的少数民族，得以保存他们的文化，并加入共产党和参加政府队伍。但是，那些要求更有效自治权和更好控制自己文化特征的少数民族不时会和那些违反宪法及《民族区域自治法》的政府政策发生冲突。藏族自治地方和新疆实施的政府政策触犯中国宪法和法律的情况最频繁。政府给予中国西南地区那些接受中央领导的少数民族，如壮族、瑶族和彝族等，更大的行使合法权益的自由。2000年以来，中国少数民族自治区的经济生产不断增长，交通运输和通讯网络得到了改善，但是，中央对开发政策以及财政资源的控制削弱了少数民族自治区的经济自治，并在藏族、维吾尔族所住的地方和其它边远地区特别优惠汉族人。中央政府自1949年以来的投入虽然增加了少数民族受教育的机会，但是少数民族识字率和受教育水平仍然低于汉族人。由政府安排将汉族人向少数民族地区移居的做法加剧了民族间的紧张关系，在藏族自治地方、新疆和内蒙古尤其严重。\n\n中国政府提倡资源保护、回收以及利用可再生能源来解决环境恶化及自然资源枯竭的问题。但是环境保护法律的不完善、实施不力以及政府环境保护预算偏小等因素妨碍了这些努力。中国政府在环境问题上推动国际合作，并且接受国外对环保项目的技术援助。\n\n中国宪法和法律规定妇女应享有平等权利，一些妇女组织也在为保护妇女权益而努力。但是中国妇女的就业机会低于男性，她们的整体教育水平也低于男性。政府承认这些男女之间的差异，正在采取措施保护妇女的利益。随着HIV病毒/艾滋病从以男性为主的高危群体传播到一般人口当中，妇女受感染的危险随之增加。\n\n尽管政府制定了一系列法律来禁止贩卖妇女和儿童，贩卖妇女和儿童在中国仍然是一个很普遍的现象。中国人口控制政策激化了贩卖人口情况。中国政府在发现超生孩子时对超生家庭课以强制性罚款，最贫困的家庭常常因为负担不起罚款而把婴儿、特别是女婴卖给或者送给人口贩子。\n\n中国当今所面临的两个最大的公共卫生挑战是传染病和农村地区的贫困。中央政府正在采取措施改善农村地区的公共卫生基础设施，但是中国的贫困人口缺乏预防性医疗照顾，提供免费疫苗接种的法律实施不力，致使许多成年人和儿童没有受到保护。中央政府在继续扩大和深入艾滋病毒/艾滋病的防治，但是地方政府经常对艾滋病问题活动分子进行骚扰。政府的控制妨碍公众获得与卫生有关的信息，因而也妨碍中国的公共卫生系统以及国际间对疾病的监督和及时应对。\n\n中国政府继续其人口控制政策，该政策按计划将实行到21世纪中。强制罚款是主要实施手段，但是继续有消息证实，地方官员仍然使用强制手段确保人们服从政策，尽管这样做是违反中国法律的。人口控制政策所导致的男女性别严重不平衡现像在过去二十年来越来越严重。中国政府成立了一个委员会来立法，以便将性别选择流产定为刑事犯罪。\n\n国家和地方当局正在逐步改革中国的户籍登记制度。2005年，中央政府采取了一些措施，取消对民工在城市地区的就业限制，但是公共服务领域的户籍歧视现象仍然十分普遍。户口改革使得富有和受教育公民在选择永久居住地时有更大的选择余地，但严格的经济条件限制却将在城市地区生活的贫困农村流动人口排斥在外，使得中国这一弱势公民群体无法得到公共服务。\n\n由于司法制度的不完善以及缺乏其它政治参与途径，中国公民通过成千上万个信访 机构来申诉不满，寻求解决办法，但是他们的申诉只有极少数得到解决。公民的不满正在以大规模示威或罢工等集体上访方式表现出来。中国当局用严格的责任追究制来惩罚发生集体上访地区的地方官员，为此公民认为通过集体上访更有可能取得结果。政府在2005年制定了新的《信访条例》，目的使信访系统对公民的投诉做出更加有效的反应，但是这些条例同时又增加了信访机构的份量，增加了集体上访对公民的吸引力。\n\n达赖喇嘛表示他不寻求独立，而是要在中国境内实行藏族自治的基础上寻求解决方案。但是中国领导人似乎并没有认识到与达赖喇嘛或他的特使更进一步对话的好处。中国的民族区域自治法规包含对藏人及其文化有利的条款，但是由于实施不力而在很大程度上忽视了这些条款的潜在价值。中国政府的统计数字显示，藏人还不可能在中央政府政策所创造的经济和民族环境下与其它民族进行竞争。藏人文盲率是全国平均文盲率的五倍。大多数藏人没有机会接受能帮助他们在就业以及其它经济利益方面进行竞争的双语教育。藏人担心西部大开发项目以及青藏铁路项目将导致更多的汉族移民进入西藏，而从中国法律以及官方声明来看，藏人的担心不无道理。藏人的宗教、言论以及集会自由等受宪法保障的权利受到严厉的限制。政府官员迫害著名的藏人，特别是那些被认为和达赖喇嘛有联系的宗教领袖。\n\n中国政府强行遣返因逃避饥饿和政治迫害而到中国寻求庇护的朝鲜人，违反了它按照1951年《难民地位公约》以及1967年议定书所要求在处理难民事务方面应承担的义务。中国政府把所有在中国的朝鲜人定为“非法经济移民” ，不允许联合国难民事务高级专员公署和这一孤立无援的群体进行接触。朝鲜人在中国的生活条件十分恶劣，妇女和儿童十分容易成为人口贩卖和卖淫业的受害者。朝鲜政府常常基于政治原因不给某些群体发放食品，回到朝鲜的难民面临长期监禁、折磨或处决的命运。这些现象足以使中国政府把在中国的朝鲜人视为难民，允许联合国难民事务高级专员公署和他们接触。\n\n香港人继续生活在一个开放的社会中，他们的宗教、言论和集会自由得到尊重，但是中央政府继续通过对《基本法》进行释法而不断干预香港的地方自治，对此，本委员会感到不安。本委员会坚决认为，中央政府根据香港《基本法》给予香港 “高度自治” 是十分重要的；本委员会坚决支持《基本法》中有关特区行政长官和全体立法会成员通过普选产生的条款。尽管中央领导层不断设法清除法轮功运动，但是香港司法机构推翻了对八名法轮功信徒的定罪，保护了公民抗议示威的权利，这一举动显示了香港司法系统持续的独立性。\n\n中国侵犯知识产权的现象在世界上属于最严重之列，而中国政府容忍这种行为，也没有制订足以阻止侵犯知识产权行为的刑事处罚法规。过去一年来，中国有关部门采取的改善对外国知识产权保护的措施并没有大幅度较少侵权现像。中国政府在使其法律符合它应尽的世贸组织义务方面取得了进步。新的商业法律虽然还有很大缺陷，但是改善了外国公司在中国的商业环境。在新的、更加透明的规定下，中国政府的贸易机关减少了行政关卡和拖延发放许可证的现象。中国政府还没有在分销和农业等领域内完全贯彻国民待遇、非歧视及透明度等世界贸易组织的重要原则。要解决这些问题，中国政府必须继续进行经济改革，建立更加透明和具有一贯性的管理和许可证制度，贯彻落实外国公司的分销权，加强执行有关知识产权的法律。\n\n建议\n\n本委员会正在努力落实2002、2003和2004年度报告中提出的建议，直至这些建议实施为止。本委员会认为，美国必须继续一方面从高层呼吁改善中国的人权状况、另一方面支持在法律领域的改革。根据本报告的结论，本委员会向总统和国会提出2005年补充建议：\n\n中国公民的人权\n\n本委员会的政治犯资料库是一个能用以推动改善中国人权的独特资源。国会议员在为他们所关怀的中国政治犯和宗教犯进行争取权益的活动时，应利用这一资料库，应请求官方和民间访华代表团向中国官员提交从资料库获得的政治犯和宗教犯名单。国会议员还应该敦促与中国建立姐妹州和姐妹市关系的州和地方政府官员以及普通公民利用资料库的信息，为争取释放中国政治犯和宗教犯而进一步努力。\n\n中国政府近来颁布的有关实施《民族区域自治法》的规定要求所有地方政府起草并贯彻相应的措施，保护少数民族权利，教育公民这一法律所规定的公民权利。为了协助这方面的努力，总统应该提议、并由国会拨款，让美国非政府组织提供法律和技术培训。总统和国会应继续敦促中国官员不要以全球反恐战争为借口，压制少数民族合法、和平地行使他们受中国宪法以及《民族区域自治法》所保障的权利的愿望。\n\n虽然政府在努力解决妇女和儿童贩卖问题，但是中国国内以及经由中国的人口贩卖活动仍然十分普遍。中国政府正在和联合国机构合作，并在国内采取措施控制人口贩卖，主要是通过制定刑事法来制裁人口贩子，由公安部门主要承担根除人口贩卖的责任。总统和国会应该继续支持有关的国际项目，加强执法能力，防止中国国内以及经由中国的人口贩卖活动；同时也应该发展及资助美国的非政府组织所带头的重点为保护受害者以及帮助他们恢复生活能力的、特别是法律和教育协助的项目。\n\n中国领导人将社会稳定视为他们的头等要务，从上至下采取了一些措施来对付滥用职权以至导致社会动乱的官员。总统和国会应该鼓励中国政府继续这些积极的措施，但是还应该敦促中国领导人为确保中国未来的稳定进行从下至上的改革，包括(1) 限制选举委员会的处置权，扩大大众的政治参与；(2) 取消业务主管单位的条款，解除当前对民间社会的限制；(3) 取消对新闻媒体的限制；(4) 给予中国公民行使宪法保障的权利；(5) 采取实质性步骤，让司法体系独立。\n\n藏人及其宗教、语言与文化的未来取决于对未来的政策做出公正合理的决策，而这些决策只能通过对话来获得。达赖喇嘛在这个对话中有着至关重要的作用。为了帮助双方在2003、2004年和2005年访问和对话的基础上继续发展，总统和国会应该敦促中国政府与达赖喇嘛或他的代表进行更深入、具有实质性的讨论，鼓励达赖喇嘛与中国领导人进行直接接触。\n\n中国信仰者的宗教自由\n\n自由信仰以及参与宗教活动乃是每个人的普世及基本权利，中国领导人应该允许所有中国公民享受真正的宗教自由。总统和国会应该促进和支持中国宗教自由的发展，继续美国长期以来在宗教自由的重要性方面所进行的外交活动，敦促中国政府与联合国宗教宽容问题特别报告员进行接触以及继续和美国国际宗教自由委员会进行对话。\n\n中国2005年新颁布的《宗教事务条例》允许宗教组织兴办社会公益事业，允许宗教信仰者和组织对官方违反其权利的做法提出异议。总统应该提议、并由国会拨款，允许美国非政府组织帮助发展自愿和独立的、由宗教组织管理的社会福利项目和教育项目。总统还应该提议、并由国会拨款，让适当的美国法律倡导组织能够帮助中国信仰者了解他们的权利，在官方违反这些权利的时候帮助他们寻求申诉和得到补偿。\n\n中国工人的劳工权利\n\n美国法律禁止进口由强制劳动生产的产品，本委员会担心中国强制劳工生产的产品有可能正在进入美国。总统应该指示按《公共法106-286》第五项所设立的中国监狱劳工工作组建立一个电子数据库，列出所知的中国强制劳工工厂或生产设施的地点。进口到美国的产品如果是全部或者部分由数据库里所列设施生产，这些产品应该根据《1930关税法》第307款的规定被推测为强制劳工生产产品，除非它们经由美国海关官员检查后确定不属于此类产品。\n\n拖欠工资和退休金在中国是一个越来越严重的问题，并且导致劳工动乱。总统和国会应该支持与中国的组织的合作项目，就如何建立按期支付工资和退休金体系的问题进行交流和培训，包括如何索取和支付拖欠工资和退休金的问题。\n\n中国公民的信息流通自由\n\n言论自由和出版自由是国际公认的，并受到中国宪法保障的权利，但是中国公民一般不知道他们具有这些权利。总统应该提议、并由国会拨款，支持美国有关方面发展技术，帮助中国公民能从互联网上获得他们目前无法获得的信息，以及根据国际法规定的他们应享受的言论自由和出版自由的资料。\n\n中国政府通过技术手段、事前限制、威胁、拘留、监禁以及含糊不清，武断实行的审查规定等方式来压制言论自由，控制中国的传媒。总统和国会应敦促中国政府取消对出版物的事前限制，停止拘留新闻工作者和作家，停止封锁外国新闻广播及网站，明确说明出版什么样的政治内容是非法的。\n\n法制和民间社会\n\n中国政府强行遣返在中国寻求庇护的朝鲜人，不允许联合国难民事务高级专员公署(UNHCR)和这一孤立无援的群体进行接触，从而违反了根据1951年《关于难民地位的公约》、1967年议定书以及1995年与联合国签订的协议中国应尽的义务。总统和国会应该敦促中国政府遵守中国签署的国际协议，允许联合国难民事务高级专员公署不受干扰地查阅朝鲜人的难民申请。\n\n美国驻中国大使馆常驻法律顾问就中国法律改革动向提供了重要的分析，并协调美国和中国间的法律交流。常驻法律顾问虽然起着这样重要的作用，但是这个职位却没有永久性的预算来源。总统和国会应设法在美国驻北京大使馆设立一个永久性的常驻法律顾问职位。\n\n自从中国2001年加入世界贸易组织以来，中国政府制订了一系列新的商业法，但是许多中国官员、法官和律师还没有就这些新法律得到培训，还不了解其法律原则。总统应该提议并由国会拨款，在美国商务部由商业法发展项目为中国官员设立一个技术协助项目。考虑到盗版和冒牌伪造现象猖獗并且屡禁不止，该项目应该强调知识产权刑事法律的有效执行方法；在各级政府执行具有一致性的有关贸易法规；在管理方面加强行政透明度；并在国民待遇、非歧视以及透明度等方面实行世界贸易组织的重要原则。\n\n本委员会行政当局的成员参与并支持本委员会的工作，包括本报告的编写。但是，本报告中的观点和建议不一定反映行政部门个别成员或行政当局的意见。\n\n本报告经投票通过，投票结果为18 票赞成，1票反对，另一票的回答是“出席” 。*\n\nII. Introduction: Growing Social Unrest and the Chinese Leadership's Counterproductive Response\n\nGrowing Social Unrest and the Roots of Instability | The Leadership's Counterproductive Response\n\nGrowing Social Unrest and the Roots of Instability\n\nSocial unrest in China is growing. According to official Chinese statistics, the number of public protests in China increased every year between 1993 and 2004. In 2003, public security authorities reported 58,000 public protests involving more than 3 million people. In 2004, public security authorities reported 74,000 public protests involving more than 3.5 million people, and a seven-fold rise from the 10,000 protests recorded in 1994. In October 2004 alone, more than 2 million farmers reportedly took part in more than 700 protests.\n\nMany problems fuel China's social unrest. Unlawful land seizures and embezzled compensation payments led to numerous land disputes, with one Chinese social scientist warning of \"turbulence\" if the government does not solve these problems. Laid off workers and pensioners protested unpaid wages, poor labor conditions, and unemployment, with some incidents involving tens of thousands of protestors. Abusive police behavior sparked large-scale protests in Chongqing, Gansu, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Yunnan last year. Environmental degradation is also a growing cause of citizen protests. The number of collective petitioning efforts, involving hundreds or thousands of protestors trying to present their grievances to officials at successively higher levels of government, is growing. Public anger also manifests itself on the Internet, where reports on law enforcement abuse sometimes generate waves of media criticism and individual commentary.\n\nMost demonstrations begin peacefully, but some turn violent, often in response to government crackdowns. Last fall in Chongqing, for example, an official's alleged abuse of a vendor during a minor street scuffle led to a riot involving more than 10,000 citizens. In November 2004, authorities in Sichuan province dispatched more than 10,000 troops and police to control a demonstration involving nearly 100,000 farmers angry over a hydroelectric project and related land confiscations. In June 2005, hundreds of armed thugs linked to a local development project reportedly killed 10 villagers and seriously wounded more than 100 while trying to evict the villagers from their land in Henan province.\n\nThe inability of government institutions and legal mechanisms to address corruption and social conflicts magnifies public anger. Official statistics indicate that the number of citizen petitions to government offices is growing rapidly, but according to Chinese scholars, government agencies address only about 0.2 percent of them. Chinese citizens may sue government officials under the Administrative Litigation Law, but they face a number of obstacles in successfully bringing such claims. These obstacles include a lack of legal representation, weak judicial capacity, Party and government interference in the courts, judicial corruption, and the prospect of official resistance or even retribution. In some cases, authorities specifically instruct courts not to accept too many administrative claims. Chinese law prohibits citizens from forming independent civil society organizations to support citizen complaints, and the Party limits political participation to channels that it designates, monitors, and controls. Without effective administrative, legal, and political channels through which to redress their grievances, citizens often have little choice but to protest.\n\nThe Leadership's Counterproductive Response\n\nChina's leaders rank social stability as a key priority, and officials are attempting to address some of the immediate causes of social unrest. In the past year, the government passed laws and initiated campaigns with the stated goals of combating corruption, curbing law enforcement abuse, limiting administrative discretion, and resolving such problems as unlawful land seizures and unpaid wages. In an effort to defuse resentment of law enforcement agencies, for example, the Ministry of Public Security and the Supreme People's Procuratorate initiated campaigns to address corruption, unlawful detention, and torture. The government has also undertaken efforts to ensure that employers pay migrant laborers.\n\nWhile taking some steps to address public anger, the leadership has also imposed new controls that intensify the underlying causes of social unrest. Over the past year, the Chinese government launched a campaign to increase restrictions on the free flow of information. As part of this campaign, officials banned hundreds of \"illegal\" political publications, established a licensing system for reporters, and imposed new registration requirements for Web sites. Officials also prosecuted journalists and editors who reported too aggressively on local abuses and prohibited the use of text messaging and other media to circulate \"rumors\" and other \"harmful\" information. The Central Propaganda Department prohibited reporting on political and social topics the Party deemed sensitive or embarrassing. In May 2005, for example, the Department issued a new directive limiting the ability of news media to publish exposés on corruption and abuse in other locales. In late 2004, censors banned reports on land seizures, warning news media against \"inducing and intensifying contradictions.\" Authorities also restricted public reporting on demonstrations and disturbances. These controls undermine the press, one of the few existing checks on local abuse, and leave officials and powerful private interests free to engage in the corrupt practices that are generating unrest across China.\n\nThe government also launched a new crackdown on intellectuals, social critics, and public activists. In the fall of 2004, the Liberation Daily published a critique of \"public intellectuals,\" declaring that \"the concept of public intellectuals had been introduced to drive wedges between intellectuals and the Party and between intellectuals and the general public.\" Since then, authorities have harassed, detained, and imprisoned many intellectuals and activists, including some who were working to address social and economic problems that the central leadership had acknowledged. For example, police arrested Li Boguang, who had been helping farmers petition the central government over local land abuses in Fujian province; Yang Tianshui, an advocate for migrant laborers; and Chen Guangcheng, a blind lawyer who had been campaigning against forced sterilizations and abortions in Shandong province. Police also detained Ye Guozhu and Ni Yulan, two Beijing housing activists, after they attempted to follow legal procedures and applied for a permit to protest forced evictions in Beijing.\n\nSimilarly, the Chinese government has increased controls over civil society and autonomous social organizations. The government continues to subordinate China's state-run union to the interests of the Party and prohibit the formation of independent labor unions that could address worker grievances. Early in 2005, authorities took steps to curb the growing activism of environmental groups that had challenged government development decisions by pressuring them to join a government-controlled umbrella organization. Officials also began a crackdown on social groups registered as business organizations and continued to enforce restrictive registration and sponsorship requirements for civil society organizations. Government and Party officials have acknowledged the important role that voluntary social organizations play in helping to address China's social problems. Instead of supporting the development of civil society organizations that could help resolve social and economic issues, however, the Chinese leadership has imposed new restrictions on these groups that undermine their ability to provide assistance, forcing many to operate underground.\n\nGovernment repression of unregistered religious believers and ethnic minorities also contributes to instability. In 2005, the Chinese leadership refocused government attention on the traditional Party fear that religion and ethnicity are being used by \"hostile outside forces\" to infiltrate and destabilize Chinese society. As a result, instead of implementing China's new Regulation on Religious Affairs in a way that offers new redress to believers against errors and abuses by the state's religious bureaucracy and encourages faith-based social organizations, the Party directed local officials to \"control\" believers. Such tactics force religious expression underground and push otherwise law-abiding believers into conflict with the government.\n\nThe Chinese government relies on a combination of top-down rectification campaigns, political controls, and repression to achieve its version of social stability. These measures have failed to control corruption, local abuses, and social unrest, fueling additional resentment on the part of China's citizens. Citizen efforts to address government abuses are driven underground, while local officials enjoy even greater discretion to violate rights. Without full transparency, free information flow, independent political participation, a vibrant civil society, genuine autonomy for ethnic minorities and religious believers, enforceable constitutional and legal rights, and effective checks on administrative discretion, China's leaders will not achieve the goal of maintaining a stable internal environment as the foundation for continued national development.\n\nIII. Monitoring Compliance With Human Rights\n\nIII(a) SPECIAL FOCUS FOR 2005: CHINA'S MINORITIES AND GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REGIONAL ETHNIC AUTONOMY LAW\n\nChina's Ethnic Minorities and Minority Policy | Legal Framework For Minority Rights | Self-governance and minority representation | Economic autonomy | Educational autonomy | Religious freedom | Cultural expression | Language policy | Freedom from discrimination | Rights Violations in Xinjiang\n\nFINDINGS\n\nMinorities that are willing to accept state controls and the official depiction of their ethnic groups and histories have been able to preserve their cultures while joining Party and government ranks. Minorities that demand greater effective autonomy and control over their cultural identities, however, regularly confront government policies that violate the Constitution and the Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law. Government policy in Tibetan areas and in Xinjiang most often contravenes the Chinese Constitution and law. The government grants minorities in southwest China that have accepted central authority, like the Zhuang, Yao, and Yi, more freedom to exercise their lawful rights.\n\nSince 2000, China's autonomous regions have experienced increased economic output and improved transportation and communication networks, but central control over development policy and financial resources has weakened economic autonomy in minority areas and disproportionately favored Han Chinese in Tibetan, Uighur, and other border areas. Central government investment has expanded educational access for minorities since 1949, though minority literacy rates and levels of educational attainment remain below those of the Han. Government-sponsored Han migration to minority areas has exacerbated ethnic tensions, particularly in Tibetan areas, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia.\n\nChina's Ethnic Minorities and Minority Policy\n\nChina's ethnic makeup is complex.1 Fifty-five minority groups speak more than 60 languages2 and practice a variety of religions. Though they constitute less than 9 percent of the total population, minorities are spread across almost two-thirds of the Chinese landmass, chiefly along international borders. More than 30 minority groups have ethnic counterparts in neighboring countries,3 and Communist Party policies in minority areas stress loyalty to China. Government concerns over the loyalty of minorities have increased with the growth of popular movements in neighboring Central Asian states.4\n\nMinorities are typically much poorer than members of the Han majority.5 Chinese authorities argue that tensions between the Han and minorities result primarily from uneven levels of economic development. Officials stress that \"all minority problems\" can be resolved by promoting socialist development and increasing propaganda on the interdependence of the country's nationalities and on the \"correct interpretation of ethnic histories.\"6 Not all minorities support the central government's development approach, contending that economic advancements disproportionately favor Han Chinese.7 Nevertheless, central authorities report marked improvements in social and economic development within the autonomous areas. When the Party assumed power in 1949, less than 20 percent of the minority population had even limited Mandarin language competency, illiteracy rates were high,8 poverty was widespread, and transportation and communication infrastructure was nearly non-existent. Discrepancies in wealth between minorities and Han Chinese have increased since market reforms began in 1978,9 and literacy rates in many minority areas remain far below the national average.10 Central government investment in minority regions has, however, raised overall educational levels,11 improved transportation and communication networks, and trained a corps of minority cadres willing to work in government.\n\nThe Chinese Constitution, the 1984 Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law (REAL),12 and a number of related laws and regulations define minority rights. The Constitution entitles minorities to establish autonomous governments in territories where they are concentrated, but like all Chinese citizens, minorities must accept the leadership of the Party,13 \"safeguard the security, honor, and interests of the motherland,\" and place the interests of the state \"above anything else.\"14 The REAL grants autonomous governments the authority to formulate regulations reflecting local minority culture as long as they do not directly contravene central policy.15 The law allows autonomous governments to alter, postpone, or annul national legislation that conflicts with local minority practices, but the next higher level of government must approve such changes and they may not contradict the basic spirit of national policies.16\n\nImplementation of the REAL varies greatly by region and by minority group.17 The Chinese government prohibits all Chinese citizens from expressing sentiments that \"incite splittism\" or \"divide nationality unity,\" but monitors minorities more closely than Han Chinese.18 The government grants a degree of local autonomy to ethnic groups that accept the central government's authority, but silences those who attempt peacefully to advocate their rights under Chinese law. Mongol activist Hada, for example, is serving a 15 year prison sentence for organizing peaceful demonstrations for rights provided in the REAL. Minorities in the southwest have had more freedom to exercise their autonomy because they rarely challenge central authority.19 The government tightly restricts religious practices and expressions of cultural identity in Xinjiang, Tibetan areas, and Inner Mongolia, however. In contrast to southwestern minorities, the Tibetans, Uighurs, and Mongols live in cohesive communities largely separated from Han Chinese, practice major world religions, have their own written scripts, and have supporters outside of China. Relations between these minorities and Han Chinese have been strained for centuries.\n\nThe government continued to violate minority rights in Tibetan areas and Xinjiang throughout the year, but elsewhere Chinese authorities took some steps to improve the treatment of minorities. In May 2005, the State Council announced new Regulations on Implementing the Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law (REAL Implementing Regulations). The Regulations include provisions increasing compensation requirements for central government extraction of natural resources from autonomous regions,20 strengthening the monitoring and reporting mechanisms on REAL implementation,21 and developing guidelines for penalizing government officials who violate minority rights.22 The REAL Implementing Regulations also require local governments to educate minorities about their rights and to draft specific measures to protect their rights and interests.23 A university and several governments in autonomous areas announced new legal aid and social services centers throughout the year.24 In March, a group of Darhad Mongols successfully invoked rights provided in the REAL, United Nations regulations, and the national Land Administration Law to bar the construction of a Han Chinese-owned Genghis Khan theme park on a site overseen by Mongols since 1696.25\n\nDespite these positive steps, the REAL Implementing Regulations also increase the role of the central government in autonomous areas, reflecting a broader national campaign to increase Party controls over society. All of the new State Council measures are binding on autonomous governments, including specific economic development projects, language policies, and migration policies that the autonomous governments previously had the authority to determine themselves.26 Central authorities also tightened controls over minority cultural representation and launched an extensive propaganda campaign on the role of China's minorities in building a united, multi-ethnic nation.27 The same campaign stresses that future prospects for minorities depend on cooperating with the Han majority.\n\nLegal Framework For Minority Rights\n\nMinority rights protected under Chinese law may be roughly divided into seven categories: self-governance and representation, economic autonomy, educational autonomy, religious freedom, cultural expression, language use, and freedom from discrimination. Although the laws themselves contain provisions ensuring central control over minority areas,28 much of the discontent among minorities with central authority stems from uneven and incomplete implementation of the law rather than flaws in the legal framework itself.\n\nSelf-governance and minority representation\n\nThe Constitution entitles minorities living in concentrated communities to establish autonomous governments,29 though their autonomy remains limited in practice. The 1984 REAL grants autonomous governments all of the powers awarded other local governments and the right to formulate three additional types of regulations: self-governing regulations, separate regulations,30 and separate alterations to national laws. None of these regulations may contradict the \"basic principles\" of national laws or policies, though the local regulations may adapt national laws, regulations, and policies to suit local minority customs.31 Self-governing regulations establish each autonomous government's organizational structure and local economic, cultural, and public service development plans. Self-governing regulations must be approved by the next higher-level government before final submission to the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC). To date, the NPCSC has not approved any self-governing regulations of the five provincial-level autonomous regions,32 although 133 of the country's 30 autonomous prefectures and 120 autonomous counties have issued local self-governing regulations.33 Most of these self-governing regulations were passed between 1984 and 1992, and a number of their provisions have not kept pace with continuing changes in central government political, economic, and social policies.34\n\nAutonomous governments have passed 383 separate regulations and 68 alterations to national laws, but they are vaguely worded and address only a limited set of state-approved topics.35 Most of these rules lower the legal marriage age for minorities, and only a few give greater fiscal autonomy or control over local natural resources to the local governments.36 Several Chinese scholars argue that autonomous regulations fail to reflect local minority conditions, rendering the concept of regional autonomy \"purely cosmetic.\"37 The inability of autonomous governments to pass effective local regulations, combined with the poor implementation of such regulations and a lack of trained minority legal personnel, undermines the development of the rule of law in minority areas.38\n\nChinese legal analysts note that minorities would better accept the formal legal system if autonomous regulations accurately reflected minority customs.39 One minority scholar laments that minorities \"often simply give up on litigation and handle matters privately, through customary minority practice\" because the courts \"ignore the existence of minority customs\" and lack financial and political independence.40 Autonomous governments in Muslim areas, for example, have yet to pass legislation to legalize Islamic inheritance customs that directly conflict with the National Inheritance Law.41\n\nThe Chinese government has passed a number of laws and policies designed to increase minority representation within the government and state-owned enterprises, but minorities remain underrepresented and fill a disproportionate number of low-level positions in the government.42 The REAL requires that the head of each autonomous government be drawn from the titular minority and that state personnel be drawn equitably from local minority groups. The government has funded 13 institutes of higher education to train minority students and mid-level officials, and promotes minorities with \"solid political viewpoints\" that match state policies.43 But the educational level of minority government employees remains lower than their Han counterparts,44 and minorities are inadequately represented within economic agencies.45 Although minorities are well represented in the National People's Congress,46 the legislature remains subordinate to the Party and individual deputies wield little power.\n\nChinese law makes no provision for minority representation within the Party apparatus, where minorities constitute only 6.3 percent of the total membership and rarely hold high-level positions.47 In 2000, each of the 125 regional, prefectural, municipal, and county-level Party first secretaries in Xinjiang was Han, as were the first secretaries of all five provincial-level autonomous regions.48 Reflecting the sensitivity of the subject, neither the press nor scholarly journals discuss minority representation in the Party.49 The Party's official atheism, reflected in a rule prohibiting Party members from practicing religion, also undermines minority participation in Party affairs.50\n\nThe central government continues to place Han Chinese \"from the interior\" into key technical and political posts in autonomous areas and to encourage Han laborers and farmers to move into these regions.51 The government contends that this is necessary to \"lead\" economic development in these areas and combat efforts to undermine ethnic unity by \"hostile domestic and foreign forces.\"52 The policy has undermined minority autonomy and increased ethnic tensions, most dramatically in Xinjiang and Tibetan areas. Central and local directives emphasize that Han leadership is needed to spur development in autonomous areas due to the dearth of educated minorities,53 but the government encourages technically trained minorities to leave the autonomous areas while supporting the influx of both skilled and unskilled Han workers.54 The REAL Implementing Regulations require autonomous governments to \"guide and organize\" local residents to go to \"other areas\" in search of jobs and business opportunities.55 By government decree, officials that have been relocated to autonomous areas are better compensated than local administrators. The REAL Implementing Regulations increase the central government's commitment to transferring Han personnel \"from all fields and all levels\" to minority areas, extending a policy that the State Ethnic Affairs Commission boasts has already sent \"tens of thousands of cadres to the border areas since 1982.\"56\n\nEconomic autonomy\n\nAlthough the economies of the minority regions have grown substantially since 1949, central authorities often determine development strategies with little input from minority residents. Central authorities provide autonomous governments additional funds and financing options beyond those provided non-autonomous governments.57 At the same time, autonomous areas have become increasingly dependent on central subsidies to support their local operating budgets, particularly since the launch of the Great Western Development program in 2000.58 More than 60 percent of Xinjiang's economy is state-owned, for example, and centrally funded infrastructure projects and major natural resource extraction projects since 2000 have increased the central government's share of the Xinjiang economy. Minorities often complain that they are not benefiting from the central economic development programs,59 though such allegations are difficult to confirm given tight controls over reporting on certain types of economic information.\n\nChinese law grants autonomous regions the right to manage and protect their natural resources,60 but state policies often ignore such provisions. The Chinese Constitution states that all natural resources are owned by \"the state, that is, by the whole people,\" but the REAL grants autonomous governments the right to assign ownership of the pastures and forests within these areas and requires the state to give minorities some compensation for all natural resources extracted from their territories.61 Human rights groups and Western analysts note that central government grasslands policies threaten to destroy the nomadic lifestyle of many Mongols and Tibetans. These analysts also say that the minorities have been denied a voice in grasslands management.62 Increased Han immigration into Xinjiang has increased pressure on scarce water resources and contributed to rapid desertification.63 Many minorities complain privately that Han developers are stripping away their natural resources and that Han Chinese monopolize high paying jobs in resource extraction projects. The REAL Implementing Regulations require that all natural resource extraction projects in autonomous areas benefit local economic development and employment, though it is too early to tell if the Regulations will result in policy changes. The Regulations also mandate new compliance monitoring and reporting mechanisms and impose administrative and criminal penalties on those violating the Regulations,64 which may encourage greater compliance with the Regulations by developers.\n\nEducational autonomy\n\nAlthough the REAL grants autonomous governments the right to control their educational systems,65 the central government retains tight control over the curricula and promotes the use of Mandarin Chinese in the classroom. Autonomous governments and the central government have developed an array of special schools and programs for minorities, increasing the total number of ethnic students enrolled in classes more than 17-fold since 1949.66 Minorities accounted for only 1.4 percent of the total student population in institutes of higher learning in 1949, but the figure rose to 6 percent by 1999.67 Minorities are allowed to enter universities with lower test scores than Han and are eligible for special scholarships. The government has established special year-long preparatory classes for minorities requiring remedial assistance before they enter universities. More than 9,000 students attended such classes in 2001.68 The government has also set up special mobile classes catering to nomadic minority communities.\n\nMinorities are entitled by law to set their own curricula, but in practice the central government strictly controls the content of teaching materials in minority classes to ensure \"the proper understanding of nationality relations and advanced socialist thinking.\"69 Educators in autonomous areas report that the government controls the content of history textbooks strictly. They complain that textbooks written in the local minority script are translations of the standard Chinese texts.70 One Western study found that minority students have difficulty relating to the material in the standard Chinese curriculum and thus lose interest in learning.71\n\nReligious freedom\n\nThe Constitution entitles minorities, like all citizens of China, to freedom of religious belief, though Uighurs and Tibetans have been effectively stripped of this right. Religion is the central marker of ethnic identity for many minorities, and the government often equates the religious activities of these groups with \"ethnic chauvinism\" and \"local splittism.\" 72 The government represses Uighur and Tibetan religious practices [see Section III(d)—Freedom of Religion and Section VI—Tibet], though official policy concedes that minority religious beliefs are a \"long-term issue\" and \"cannot be forcibly resolved in the short-term.\"73 Minorities outside of Xinjiang and Tibetan areas who belong to one of the five officially recognized religions are generally allowed to practice their religions in registered religious venues managed by state-licensed clergy. Many minorities practice religions unique to their ethnic groups (and not one of the five state-recognized religions), which the government tacitly allows as a \"minority custom\" rather than as a religion per se.74 Autonomous governments are required to teach \"scientific thinking,\" a Party catchphrase for atheism, in the public school system and must prevent religion from \"infiltrating\" the educational system.\n\nCultural expression\n\nThe central government has tightened controls over political expression during the past 12 months throughout the country [see Section III(e)Freedom of Expression], including in minority areas. The government increased already strict controls over how minority cultural traits, histories, and religions are depicted in popular media and schools as well as in academic circles. Officials also tightened controls on cultural expressions about minority relations with Han Chinese and increased propaganda in 2005 highlighting both the achievements of Party minority policy and the official view of minority relations.75 In May, Central Chinese Television broadcasted a series of documentaries on the accomplishments of the regional autonomy system and a feature film set in Tibetan areas and Yunnan depicting \"the great melding of nationalities into a single whole, bound by blood and affection.\"76 Since 1949, the Party has monitored all forms of expression in autonomous areas to assure that minorities accept official Party historiography.77 As recently as 2002, authorities held public book burnings of minority-authored works that conflict with official histories depicting relations among the minorities as harmonious.78 To co-opt the histories of minority groups, the central government has invested in ethnic \"cultural enterprise centers\" where minorities conduct officially sanctioned research and attend approved cultural festivities and performances.79 The State Council's February 2005 White Paper on Regional Autonomy hails the expansion of minority language publications and broadcasts, artistic troupes, museums, libraries, and histories,80 but also stresses the role of the central government in each of these cultural enterprises.81\n\nLanguage policy\n\nThe REAL entitles minorities to use and develop their own spoken and written languages,82 though in practice language policy varies by region and ethnic group.83 The law says that minorities should use textbooks written in their own languages \"whenever possible\" and use these languages as the medium of instruction. Though many minorities continued to use their native languages in primary and some middle schools,84 the central government increased its efforts this year to promote universal competency in Mandarin Chinese throughout the country.85 In some minority areas, local groups reported decreased government support for minority language use, but few overt restrictions.86 In Xinjiang the policy appeared more coercive, as discussed later in this section [for more on language policy in Tibetan areas, see Section VI—Tibet]. Upward social, economic, and political mobility is increasingly dependent upon one's ability to use Mandarin Chinese. Many minority groups welcome the opportunity to develop their Mandarin skills, while emphasizing the importance of promoting their own minority languages.\n\nThe Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region government passed a new regulation in May which, if properly implemented, promises to expand the use of the Mongol language. The regulation calls for increased use of Mongolian in regional colleges, economic incentives for students in Mongolian language schools, merit increases for bilingual government workers, and increased Mongolian media broadcasts. It also mandates greater regional funding for minority language publications and broadcasts.87 The regulation contains more specific provisions for promoting the Mongol language and elevating the status of Mongolian speakers than found in national laws or other local regulations.88 The new regulation also contains enforcement clauses, making it more likely to be implemented than earlier official statements supporting minority language use.\n\nFreedom from discrimination\n\nThe Chinese Constitution states that all minorities are equal and prohibits all acts that discriminate against or oppress nationalities. Nevertheless, ethnic discrimination continues to exist throughout China, in both the government's controls over cultural and religious expression and in private and governmental hiring practices. Many Han Chinese entrepreneurs with businesses in autonomous areas intentionally recruit Han workers from neighboring provinces rather than work with local minorities.89 Employers favor those with fluent Mandarin language skills and, in some areas, certain job listings bar specific minorities from applying.90 In the Tibetan Autonomous Region, the highest paying jobs are largely staffed by Han Chinese.91 The central and Xinjiang governments announced personnel decisions in 2005 that explicitly favored Han Chinese over minorities. In April 2005, for example, the government specified that 500 of 700 new civil service positions in southern Xinjiang, where over 95 percent of the population is Uighur, would be reserved for Han Chinese.92 The government actively recruited Chinese from outside of Xinjiang to assume key posts in the autonomous region, while providing insufficient incentives to stem the flow since 1979 of more than 200,000 trained personnel from Xinjiang to the east coast.93 Han Chinese now constitute over 40 percent of the population in Xinjiang, compared to less than 6 percent in 1949. In April 2005, 9,000 workers from Han-populated poor counties in Gansu accepted \"long-term contracts\" to work on Production and Construction Corps farms in Xinjiang, despite high levels of unemployment among minorities living nearby.94\n\nRights Violations in Xinjiang\n\n95\n\nSince the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991 and independent states were established in Central Asia, the Chinese government has tightened controls over Uighur expressions of ethnic identity.96 Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States, the Chinese government has equated peaceful expressions of Uighur identity with \"subversive terrorist plots.\"97 The Xinjiang government has increased surveillance and arrests of Uighurs suspected of \"harboring separatist sentiments\" since popular movements ousted Soviet-era leaders in Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan.98 In May 2005, the Xinjiang government intensified its \"strike hard\" campaign against activities it characterizes as ethnic separatism, religious extremism, or international terrorism.99 In September 2005, Chinese authorities declared the \"East Turkestan forces\" the primary terrorist threat in China, and acknowledged that Xinjiang authorities have increased police surveillance and political controls throughout the region this year.100\n\nRecent government policies only exacerbate ethnic tensions in Xinjiang. The government's promotion of rapid economic development in the region disproportionately benefits Han Chinese and, together with restrictions on religious, linguistic, and cultural freedoms, and government-supported, large-scale Han migration into the area, has increased Uighur resentment and fears of coercive cultural assimilation.101 Although the extensive security apparatus in Xinjiang102 appears for the present to have crushed Uighur calls for greater autonomy, scholars report that \"the majority of Uighurs are unhappy with the system of autonomy and the course of politics.\"103 One prominent Western scholar notes that \"repression on this scale may temporarily succeed in subduing the expression of ethnic identity but in the long-term it can only increase the resentment that Uighurs feel . . . and fuel deeper conflict in the future.\"104\n\nMany of the rights granted by the REAL are given to autonomous area governments rather than to individual citizens, and the government carefully controls the appointment and training of all Uighur officials. According to one U.S. scholar, \"in the estimation of ordinary Uighurs, those Uighurs who have risen to top leadership positions have been selected not for their responsiveness to popular concerns but because of their tractability.\"105 Uighur officials, like ethnic officials in Tibetan areas, are subject to rigorous political indoctrination. As part of the ongoing national \"Advanced Culture\" campaign, the Xinjiang government insists that all Party members, who must be atheists, carefully study the \"correct relationship between religion and advanced socialist culture.\"106 A 2004 article in the Party's main theoretical journal reported that Xinjiang is intensifying political education for all government workers, particularly for those with \"paralyzed thinking . . . who fail to clearly distinguish between legitimate and illegal religious activities.\" 107\n\nThe government continued its campaign to restrict the use of the Uighur language in favor of Mandarin Chinese, despite provisions in the REAL protecting the right of minorities to use and promote their own languages. Government efforts to limit Uighur language use began in the 1980s, but have intensified since 2001 and throughout the past year.108 In May 2002, the Xinjiang government announced that Xinjiang University would change the medium of its instruction to Mandarin Chinese. A March 2004 directive ordered ethnic minority schools to merge with Chinese-language schools and offer classes in Mandarin.109 Despite a severe shortage of teachers in Xinjiang,110 the government is forcing teachers with inadequate Mandarin Chinese out of the classroom.111 Party Secretary Wang Lequan noted in April 2005 that Xinjiang authorities are \"resolutely determined\" to promote Mandarin language use, which he found \"an extremely serious political issue.\"112 The government favored Mandarin speakers when setting school admission requirements and in hiring government personnel.113\n\nUighurs have not been able to determine their own school curricula as provided by the REAL. The government demands that teachers place primary emphasis on political instruction over other subjects.114 Any mention of religion in the public schools is strictly prohibited. Primary and middle schools are barred from offering Arabic language instruction because according to the government \"Arabic has never been a language used by any of our minorities and has only been used as a religious language by a small number of people.\"115 In January 2005, Wang urged the Party to rewrite textbooks and \"increase the regulation of classroom instruction, academic forums, seminars, and community activities.\"116 He emphasized the importance of \"politicians managing education and politicians operating schools.\" Throughout the province, schools became the \"battlefront for strengthening the Party.\" 117 The Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture Educational Department criticized teachers for \"putting too much emphasis on teaching and not enough on politics.\"118 In April 2005, Wang announced that more than 1,700 college teachers had completed 20-day training classes on increasing political controls in schools.119\n\nGovernment controls over expression increased in 2005 as the Xinjiang and central authorities \"waged war\" against what they called \"new plots\" to divide the country by those \"raising the banner of 'human rights,' 'nationalities,' and 'religion.' \"120 A Xinjiang prefectural Party secretary alleged that splittists were using DVDs, popular music, movies, and literature to promote separatism. He also claimed it was necessary to intensify controls over all forms of media and art, increase Party propaganda, use loudspeakers and banners in every village, and remain diligent so that the Party can maintain national unity.121\n\nThe government continues to arrest Uighur journalists and authors who write news articles or literary pieces that the government charges \"incite separatism\" or \"disclose state secrets.\" The Xinjiang authorities define any discussion of \"important\" ethnic policies as a state secret.122 In February 2005, the Kashgar Intermediate People's Court sentenced Uighur author Nurmemet Yasin to 10 years imprisonment for publishing a short story in the Kashgar Literature Journal allegedly containing allegories \"inciting splittism.\"123 Doctoral candidate Tohti Tunyaz continues to serve an 11 year sentence imposed in 1999 for \"revealing state secrets\" in Japanese publications on Uighur history.124\n\nThe government has sentenced many Uighurs to long prison terms for peacefully expressing discontent with government policies. In August 1999, a Xinjiang court sentenced a group of 18 Uighurs to prison terms of up to 15 years for alleged separatist activities, none of which involved violence.125 The alleged leader of the group, Shirmemhemet Abdurishit, is serving a 15 year sentence.126 Although in March 2005 the government released Uighur businesswoman Rebiya Kadeer several months before the end of her eight year sentence for \"leaking state secrets,\" hundreds of Uighur prisoners of conscience remain in prison.127 Authorities began harassing Kadeer's relatives in Xinjiang after she publicly discussed the plight of the Uighurs from her new home in the United States.128\n\nNotes to Section III(a)—Special Focus for 2005: China's Minorities and Government Implementation of the Regional Autonomy Ethnic Law\n\n1 The Chinese government uses a Stalinist formula to determine which groups constitute unique minzu, variously translated as \"nationalities\" or \"ethnic groups.\" Accordingly, to be considered a nationality, a group must have a common language, territory, economic life, and culture. Stalin, J.V. \"Marxism and the National Question,\" in Works (Moscow: Foreign Languages University Publishing House, 1953), 302. More than 400 groups registered as separate nationalities in the 1953 census, with more than 240 requesting recognition in Yunnan Province alone. The government was only able to winnow the number to 55 after awkwardly gerrymandering ethnic boundaries by sending work teams of anthropologists and government officials to the countryside to determine which groups \"objectively\" constituted unique nationalities. Many groups continue to contest the government's classification system. For details on the classification process, see Katherine Palmer Kaup, Creating the Zhuang: Ethnic Politics in China (Boulder: Lynne Rienner Press, 2000); Katherine Palmer Kaup \"Regionalism and Ethnicnationalism in the People's Republic of China,\" 172 China Quarterly, 863–884 (2002); and Fei Xiaotong, Collected Works of Fei Xiaotong [Fei Xiaotong xuanji] (Fuzhou: Haixian Wenyi Chubanshe, 1996), 285.\n\n2 S. Robert Ramsey, The Languages of China (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987), 157–292. Many of the minority languages are further divided into mutually unintelligible dialects.\n\n3 The Uighurs, Kyrgiz, Kazahks, Uzbeks, and Tajiks in Xinjiang, for example, all have ethnic counterparts in neighboring countries, as do the Zhuang, Miao, Dai, and Shui in Yunnan and Guangxi.\n\n4 The Chinese government and the other five members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) signed an agreement on June 2, 2005, to take \"specific steps to step up the efficiency of cooperation in ensuring stability and security, including holding joint antiterrorist training exercises, training personnel and exchange of experience in fighting terrorism, separatism, and extremism.\" \"Kazakhstan: SCO Officials Express Concern Over Terrorist Levels in Central Asia,\" Almaty Interfax-Kazakhstan, 2 June 05 (FBIS, 2 June 05).\n\n5 Chinese President Hu Jintao noted in May 2005 that the per capita GDP in minority areas is only 67.4 percent of the national average and rural per capita income only 71.4 percent of the national average. Hu Jintao, \"Opening Speech to the Ethnic Affairs Work National Conference\" [Hu Jintao zai zhongyang minzu gongzuo huiyishang de jianghua], State Ethnic Affairs Commission Web site, 27 May 05. This figure, however, does not indicate the severity of economic discrepancies, as Han Chinese within minority areas typically have higher incomes than the minorities. The government tightly controls statistics on Han-minority economic discrepancies, and published statistics report figures based on regional differences rather than providing breakdowns by ethnic groups. Kaup, Creating the Zhuang, 149–53. Numerous factors contribute to minority poverty. Minorities are concentrated in harsh geographical terrains on China's periphery and lack the capital needed to extract natural resources in their territories. Poor infrastructure and low educational levels also contribute to their poverty. Government policies have exacerbated discrepancies in wealth between the minorities and Han. See Katherine Palmer, \"Nationalities and Nationality Areas,\" in China Handbook, ed. Chris Hudson (Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997), 276–85. Several Western analysts report that central development strategies in Xinjiang since the launching of the Great Western Development campaign in 2000 have disproportionately favored Han Chinese.

The report describes a meeting of the top-ranking government officials in Xinjiang called \"to transmit the Central Party's Comprehensive Work Plan Regarding Xinjiang's Economic Development and Social Stability, and to develop plans for implementing it.\" At the meeting, Wang Lequan, Politburo member and Party General Secretary of Xinjiang, urged \"all party and government officials from all levels within the autonomous region to earnestly study and adopt the spirit of the Center's comprehensive plan. We must focus all of our thinking on the spirit of the Center's directive, and, with a strong sense of enthusiasm and duty, quickly develop concrete implementation measures that blend each localities' and departments' concrete circumstances in order to rigorously promote all of these Xinjiang projects.\" Xinjiang's autonomy rests in how best to implement central directives according to local circumstances. In many cases, this results in policies more restrictive of individual liberties than those promoted by the central government. The report cited here, for example, advocates strengthening the role of the predominately Han, paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in order to promote regional stability.\n\n14 REAL, art. 7.\n\n15 Ibid., arts. 4–7, 19.\n\n16 Ibid., arts. 4–7, 20.\n\n17 The Chinese government has imposed the fewest controls on minorities that accept central authority, which in turn have made these groups more willing to cooperate with Han Chinese. Mutual distrust between Han authorities and several minority groups has led to tighter government controls in some areas, however, exacerbating ethnic tensions according to both Chinese and Western analysts. See, for example, Ma Mingliang, \"Muslims and Non-Muslims Can Coexist in Harmony in China, as They Do in Malaysia, If They Understand Each Other's Culture Better,\" Islam in China, 31 Jul 05 (FBIS, 6 September 05); Bovingdon, Autonomy in Xinjiang: Han Nationalist Imperatives and Uyghur Discontent.\n\n18 REAL, art. 9.

Although many of the minorities in southwestern China live in single-ethnicity villages, often these villages will be interspersed in close proximity to those of other minority groups. Southwestern minorities tend to be segregated by villages rather than by larger administrative areas, whereas distances between communities of different ethnic groups tend to be greater in the Northwest. Many of the southwestern minority groups are also internally divided and have little interest in mobilizing against Han Chinese authority.

Steven Harrel (Berkeley: University of California, 2001), 232–7.\n\n20 State Council Regulations on the Implementation of the REAL, issued 11 May 05, art. 8.\n\n21 Ibid., arts. 30 and 34.\n\n22 Ibid., arts. 31 and 32.\n\n23 Ibid., art. 2.\n\n24 \"South-Central Nationalities University Opens Legal Aid Clinic\" [Zhongnan minzu daxue chengli falü huanzhu zhongxin], Tianshan Net (Online), 21 March 05; \"Suzhou Wujiang City Establishes New Social Services System for Migrant Minority Workers\" [Suzhou Wujiang shi chuang xin wailai liudong shaoshu minzu fuwu tizhi], State Ethnic Affairs Commission Web site, 18 August 05; \"Jiangsu's Qiansu City Aggressively Expands New Approaches to Help Minority Migrants\" [Jiangsu Qiansu shi jiji shensu xinshi xia fuwu \"wailai\" yu \"waichu\" shaoshu minzu de youxiao tujin], State Ethnic Affairs Commission Web site, 18 August 05.\n\n25 \"Open Letter from the Darhad Mongols,\" Southern Mongolia Human Rights Watch (Online), March 2005.\n\n26 For example, Articles 15, 17, 18, and 22 of the State Council Regulations for the Implementation of the REAL require autonomous regions to give priority to border regions and minorities with small populations when making investment decisions. Bilingual education must be promoted, and autonomous governments are required to \"guide and organize\" local populations to seek jobs outside of their localities. Although the central government often encroaches on the autonomous governments' authority to determine their development strategies independently, the REAL in theory gave the autonomous regions the authority to control these policy decisions which are now determined by the central government.\n\n27 The Party monitors and imposes strict controls on how minority cultures are represented in popular, official, and scholarly discourse. Controls over minority representation have been imposed on all minority groups, not simply on those who have strained relations with Han Chinese and the predominately Han government. For example, though authorities regularly arrest Uighurs who display overt signs of ethnic pride, government authorities in Guangxi have criticized Zhuang authors who display too little ethnic pride. Kaup, Creating the Zhuang, 118–9.\n\n28 Article 7 of the REAL requires autonomous governments to \"place the interests of the state as a whole above anything else.\"\n\n29 The Constitution provides for the establishment of provincial-level autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties. The government began creating autonomous townships and villages in 1993 with the State Council's passage of the Regulation on the Administrative Work on Ethnic Villages [Minzu xiang xingzheng gongzuo tiaoli], issued 29 August 93.By 2003 the government had established five provincial-level autonomous regions, 30 autonomous prefectures, 120 autonomous counties, and 1,173 autonomous villages. The government decided which areas would be granted autonomous status \"through consultation between the government of the next higher level and the representatives of the minority or minorities concerned.\" General Program for the Implementation of Regional Autonomy for Minorities [Zhonghua renmin gongheguo minzu quyu zizhi shishi gangyao], issued 8 August 52, art. 9.Some members of the larger minority groups express concerns privately that the regional autonomy policy disproportionately favors smaller groups. Commission Staff Interviews. Many Uighurs and Zhuang note that within the provincial-level Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, several minority groups have their own autonomous prefectures or counties. Once established, these smaller autonomous areas are eligible for special development assistance funds that the central and provincial governments earmark for county-level autonomous governments. The Bayinguoleng Mongol Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang contains one-quarter of Xinjiang's total land. Although only 4.46 percent of the Bayinguoleng population is Mongol and 34.25 percent is Uighur, the Chinese Constitution and the REAL require that the head of the prefectural government be Mongol. In another example, a portion of Guangxi's poverty alleviation funds is earmarked for minority counties, which means that Bama Yao Autonomous County (17.24 percent Yao and 69.46 percent Zhuang) is eligible for certain development assistance programs not available to nearby Jingxi County, which does not have autonomous standing despite the fact that over 99 percent of its population is ethnically Zhuang. Article 16 of the Election Law also allows minorities with small populations a greater number of People's Congress delegates. PRC Election Law for the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses, enacted 1 July 79, amended 10 December 82, 2 December 86, 28 February 95, 27 October 04. Some Western experts believe the government consciously pitted minorities against one another when establishing regional autonomous areas in order to weaken their ability to confront the state. Gardner Bovingdon, \"Heteronomy and Its Discontents 'Minzu Regional Autonomy' in Xinjiang,\" in Governing China's Multiethnic Frontiers, ed. Morris Rossabi (Seattle: University of Washington, 2004), 117–154; Becquelin, \"Xinjiang in the Nineties,\" 86. Since 2000, the central government has explicitly stated that nationality development work will place a priority on the 22 smallest minority populations. Tang Ren, \"Ethnic Minorities Need Help: Government Pledges Another Round of Poverty Alleviation Reforms to Save the Country's 22 Small Ethnic Groups,\" Beijing Review (Online), 26 July 05. The May 2005 REAL Implementing Regulations require provincial-level governments to give priority to smaller minorities in their economic development and investment plans.\n\n30 Non-autonomous governments may also pass local legislation on issues not addressed by national law, but the autonomous areas have the power to pass local legislation expounding upon, or altering, national laws to suit minority customs.\n\n31 PRC Legislation Law, enacted 15 March 00, art. 66.\n\n32 Xinjiang has gone through eight drafts of its self-governing regulation since 1981. The Xinjiang People's Congress announced in January 2005 that it would restart the drafting process after the passage of the REAL Implementing Regulations, noting that \"many issues [in the self-governing regulation] require reaching a compromise between national and local interests so the process has been slow.\" \"Ten Issues Handled\" [Shi jian yianjian jiande dao chuli], Xinjiang Capital Daily (Online), 20 January 05.\n\n33 Article 19 of the REAL states that the self-governing regulations of autonomous regions must be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for approval before they go into effect. Self-governing regulations of autonomous prefectures and counties must receive the approval of the Standing Committees of the People's Congresses at the provincial or directly administered municipal level before becoming effective and then be reported to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.\n\n34 Governments in many autonomous areas have been revising their self-governing regulations over the last few years. Yunnan Province announced in October 2004 that all 29 of its autonomous counties and 8 autonomous prefectures would revise their self-governing regulations. \"Yunnan Province Comprehensively Pushes Revisions of Autonomous Prefectures and Counties Self-Governing Regulations,\" State Ethnic Affairs Commission Web site, 12 April 05.\n\n35 These alterations predominately deal with marriage, inheritance, elections, and grasslands legislation according to the State Council Information Office White Paper. \"Regional Autonomy f"
