It is not that ﬁlms displaying fantastical images or narratives of fantasy were unprecedented in Chinese ﬁlm history. It is, rather, that as the Chinese ﬁlm market (in the People’s Republic of China, PRC) has turned into the second-largest globally (a feat it achieved in 2012)1 and is on its way to becoming the largest (as projected to occur in 2020),2 a noticeably signiﬁcant proportion of the total ﬁlm production output is now devoted to movies that tap into the increasing popularity of fantasy genres or, in one way or another, exploit cinema’s capacity and propensity to oﬀer spectacular images of fantastic events, grotesque creatures, magical abilities, martial prowess and/or spiritual encounters. This volume of essays is a collective and concerted eﬀort to grapple with a rapidly growing body of contemporary cinema featuring the fantastic. The chapters focus on case studies of individual auteurs, important ﬁlms, innovative technologies and iterative themes, all of which arise out of the national/transnational Chinese cinematic industrial triangle of Hong Kong, Taiwan and the PRC. More speciﬁcally, as editors of this volume, we rely on the theoretical concept of ‘Sino-enchantment’ as a critical tool, not only to corral these exciting essays of varied interpretive approaches and foci into a coherent collection, but also to envision a hermeneutical boundary that is ﬂexible and porous enough for this wild thing one calls the fantastic in Chinese cinemas to run free, while also being solid enough to demarcate the critical and theoretical range the fantastic presents. In unpacking this particular theoretical turn of phrase, which we do in detail later in this introductory chapter, we argue that analysing the fantastic as Sino-enchantment unveils the cultural, political and ideological\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 1\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\n2\n\nKenneth Chan and Andrew Stuckey\n\ncomplexities, contradictions and complicities that the fantastic harbours, as it is located within the intersections of Chinese tradition and modernity. However, we also defend the potentialities that the fantastic, as genre and modality, can bring not only to Chinese cinemas aesthetically, but also to Chinese cultural politics in an ethically energising and transformative way. Therefore, Sino-enchantment, as a theoretical framework, is our means of productively capturing these cultural tensions that characterise the fantastic we see in contemporary Chinese cinemas. This introductory chapter features four sections, providing historical context and critical theory. The first section situates this volume within the definitional and discursive parameters of fantasy as a genre and as a modality in filmmaking and film studies generally. Zeroing in on Chinese films, the second section provides a brief survey of the history of the fantastic in Chinese cinemas, as well as a preliminary examination of the roles the fantastic has played in Chinese society and culture. We argue that fantastic films, throughout cinematic history, have relied on what Tom Gunning has called a cinema of attractions to engage and solidify audiences. This process, as a consequence, has transformed and hybridised the genres that are specifically popular to Chinese film-viewing audiences. As entrée to the chapters within this volume, the third section theorises the fantastic in Chinese cinemas as Sino-enchantment. We contend that the fantastic, in spite of its ideological problems, continues to resonate with audiences because of its capacity to re-enchant modern life with ethical possibilities for wonder and amazement. We conclude this introduction with the fourth section, which pulls and tugs at the theoretical threads that run through the various chapters of this book.\n\nThe Fantastic as Genre and Mode in Cinema Our use of the term ‘the fantastic’ naturally requires deﬁnition. But we do see this process of delimiting terminological boundaries as transcending the usual scholarly convention and obligation. In fact, ascertaining the critical semantics of the term helps position ‘the fantastic in contemporary Chinese cinemas’ within a Venn diagram (or as part of a series of overlapping concentric circles) that involves the fantasy ﬁlm and its modalities in Hollywood and global cinema and the place the fantastic occupies within ﬁlm studies in general. This deﬁnitional discourse, on one hand, points to the overdetermined nature of the cultural construct that is the fantastic, an overdetermination that includes the transnationality and the globality of ﬁlm as a cross-cultural commodity – in other words, the fantastic in Chinese cinemas is not a hermetically sealed\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 2\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\nIntroduction 3 cultural phenomenon. On the other hand, it also suggests, in apparent contradistinction, the notion that the fantastic in Chinese cinemas brings its own set of cultural speciﬁcities that deserve identiﬁcation and analysis. This oppositional tension, and the cultural anxieties that it evokes, ultimately leads us to our theoretical conception of Sino-enchantment as a critical device to provide, hopefully, some interpretive legibility. To begin, we see ‘the fantastic’ as a broad umbrella term encompassing the fantasy ﬁlm as a legitimate genre (with its subcategories and other related genre types) and fantasy elements as a genre mode permeating other non-fantasy genre categories. In her important essay on genre and melodrama, Christine Gledhill observes that the notion of ﬁlm genre, as a cultural construction, is complex in its constitution and evolution. For instance, she argues that ‘the life of a genre is cyclical, coming round again in corkskrew [sic] fashion, never quite in the same place’.3 She uses the word ‘modality’4 to argue not only that genre changes through time and in diﬀerent cultures, but also that the boundaries of genre are porous. In other words, genre conventions and expectations shift throughout ﬁlm history. Genres interpenetrate one another to create hybrid genres. Genres, to varying degrees, appropriate the modes and elements of other genres in the shifting processes of evolution and hybridisation. This ﬂuidity and malleability of cultural and aesthetic conventions, as they relate to the fantastic, understandably generate anxieties among genre purists and, at times, audiences at large (which is a testament to how well Hollywood and other global mainstream ﬁlm industries have trained their consumers). We devote the remainder of this section to examining some of these anxieties as a means toward highlighting the signiﬁcance of these deﬁnitional discourses to the fantastic Chinese ﬁlm.5 By conceptualising the fantastic as inclusive of fantasy as genre and mode, we are cognisant of the strategic taxonomy this binarism relies upon. But we are also aware that this theoretical structuring has had the beneﬁt of foundational debates from literary and ﬁlm scholars over the last ﬁve decades. By no means is this chapter able to replay in detail all the nuances of these debates, but some critical plot-points deserve cursory mention because of their resonance for this volume. For instance, ﬁlm scholars have argued that cinema, as a whole, is a fantastical medium. The beginning of French cinema was narrated as a battle between documentary realism (as championed by the Lumière brothers with their actualités) and ﬁctional ﬁlms of narrative fantasy (magically created by Georges Méliès). As this drama of ﬁlm history plays out, Méliès clearly won the ﬁght. But what this agonistic tale of narrative cinema’s birth does not tell us is the notion that cinema, as a medium, is intrinsically fantastical in its propensity for spectacular images and stories, and fantastical in its very technological\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 3\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\n4\n\nKenneth Chan and Andrew Stuckey\n\nmechanism. Joshua Bellin makes this general point about cinema’s roots in the fantastic by arguing that fantasy ﬁlm, as a genre and an idea, is inseparable from the birth, development, and identity of the cinema. Not only were some of the earliest narrative ﬁlms works of fantasy, but the history of ﬁlm more generally is a history of the fantastic, the illusion, the unreal.6 What Bellin is suggesting, then, is that cinema, even realist and documentary ﬁlms, relies on a fantastical sleight of hand to construct or reconstruct cinematic imagery to serve its narrative function. Making this point for us is Chapter 10 of our book, where author Yiman Wang foregrounds the deployment of the fantastic in Chinese ecocinema through examples from a wildlife documentary and the use of realistic footage of wild animals in a ﬁctional feature ﬁlm. But to stop at this deﬁnitional premise of all cinema being fantastical, or being inherently fantastical in its structural processes, is to deny the fantastic its more incisive usefulness. Brian Attebery correctly concludes that ‘a term broad enough to include both Conan the Barbarian and Cosmicomics threatens to become meaningless’.7 James Donald extends this argument further by suggesting that an overly expansive ‘category of fantasy becomes virtually useless as a means of distinguishing between diﬀerent types of ﬁlm’,8 a notion that would clearly unsettle audiences’ expectations of genre conventions and mainstream studios’ slavish attempts, through a vicious feedback loop, at catering to those conventions – one thinks of the overwrought superhero franchises like the Marvel and DC cinematic universes, or of the seemingly endless adaptations of the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien and J. K. Rowling. Like the term ‘realism’, it is the complex vastness of the fantastic that has led many literary and ﬁlm scholars to struggle with its deﬁnitional problematics by oﬀering taxonomic solutions. For instance, in his foundational structuralist text The Fantastic: A Structural Approach to a Literary Genre, Tzvetan Todorov splits what one would generally consider to be fantasy or the fantastic into three subgenres: the uncanny, the fantastic and the marvellous, with the fantastic ﬂoating between the other two categories and possessing the ‘hesitation experienced by a person who knows only the laws of nature, confronting an apparently supernatural event’.9 The limitations of Todorov’s categories, as Rosemary Jackson accurately surmises, rest on the notion that his work ‘fails to consider the social and political implications of literary forms’,10 hence diminishing its usefulness to a contemporary ﬁlm studies project like ours (a point we will return to in greater detail later in this chapter). What Todorov’s structuralist formulation does reveal, however, is not just the shortcomings of dogmatising categorical boundaries in genre studies, but also\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 4\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\nIntroduction 5 the cultural, political, aesthetic and academic anxieties exposed in the attempts to pin down this slippery object that is the fantastic. Another illustrative example can be seen in Brian Attebery’s similarly tripartite conﬁguration of mode, genre and formula. While he sees ‘the fantastic mode’ as ‘a vast subject, taking in all literary manifestations of the imagination’s ability to soar above the merely possible’, Attebery argues that, on the other end of the spectrum, lies ‘fantasy-asformula, which is essentially a commercial product’, whose ‘success depends on consistency and predictability’, and whose commercialism ‘tends toward triviality’. He then lands on the compromise of fantasy-as-genre to suggest that this ‘in-between category’ is ‘something varied and capable of artistic development’.11 This distinction between formula as commercial and genre as art serves to preempt the lack of cultural, critical, aesthetic and academic respect that the fantastic (in both literary and ﬁlmic forms) and studies of the fantastic often suﬀer. Steve Neale observes how adult audiences would deny their consumption of the fantastic by dismissing them as children’s ﬁlms,12 while David Butler bemoans the fact that the genre does not command academic and intellectual attention for precisely that reason.13 Built into the rationality of this marginalising of the fantastic is the genre’s exempliﬁcation of cinema as a mode of ‘escapism without any meaningful content or social function’,14 enabled by the presence of cinematic spectacles through special eﬀects15 (as if escapist spectacles and special eﬀects automatically diminish or are inherently devoid of cultural and intellectual signiﬁcance). Katherine Fowkes has so insightfully teased out the ideological assumptions of this dismissive logic, that escapist fantasy ﬁlms invite ‘audiences to abandon real-world problems and solutions for (usually) nostalgic and conservative illusions’16 and the triviality of play and playfulness is antithetical ‘to a world of rationality, work, and conformity’.17 In fact, playfulness is, precisely, one of the elements of the genre/mode that presents the fantastic with its potential for cultural and political subversion, which our conception of Sino-enchantment incorporates. Obviously, we strongly believe in the cultural, aesthetic and political significance of the fantastic; hence this particular volume of essays on fantastic Chinese ﬁlms. However, we do not seek to idealise the fantastic and are not blind to the pitfalls that the fantastic presents, including formulaic and unimaginative recycling of themes, plotlines and genre conventions, which one witnesses in Hollywood summer blockbusters, remakes and movie series. At the same time, we do disavow the cultural and intellectual elitism that characterises perceptions of the fantastic, especially in its B-movie format, as a genre that is unworthy of scholarly enquiry. For the study of the fantastic, in its varied and heterogeneous formulations, encompassing a range of cinematic quality and taste, and catering to a wide swath of diverse audiences, can teach\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 5\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\n6\n\nKenneth Chan and Andrew Stuckey\n\nus about the identities that we embrace, the desires that drive us and the ideologies that deﬁne us as a culture, a society and a species. Or as Joshua Bellin so aptly puts it, the fantastic ‘provoke[s] a perspective, provide[s] a context, produce[s] a way of seeing’ the world.18 This collection of essays, therefore, tackles a broad range of ﬁlms, from the B-movie Hong Kong archive of Shaw director Ho Meng-hua (Shi-Yan Chao’s Chapter 6), to the spectacular computer-generated imagery (CGI)-ﬁlled, mainstream Chinese co-productions of recent years (Jason McGrath’s Chapter 2 and Dan North’s Chapter 3), to the dipping of the fantastic into the intellectual Taiwanese art cinema of Hou Hsiao-hsien (Andrew Stuckey’s Chapter 5). This subject of the qualitative range of the fantasy ﬁlm provides a convenient point for us to pivot to the quantitative range of the genre’s typology, as we close this section of the introduction. The elasticity of the fantasy ﬁlm troubles ﬁlm critics and scholars into proliferating an entire taxonomy of subgenres and adjacent genres as part of fantasy cinema’s remit. When one thinks of the Hollywood fantasy ﬁlm, the adaptations of Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and Rowling’s Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts series come quickly and easily to mind. These ﬁlms, in part, establish magic as the fantastical quality deﬁning the diegetic worlds of the genre. But, obviously, the magical fantasy ﬁlm is only one of many genre types that scholars have identiﬁed as occupying the larger umbrella category of the fantastic, a list that includes the following: monster ﬁlms (King Kong, The Fly, Clash of the Titans, the Godzilla ﬁlms, Jurassic Park),19 science ﬁction, horror, wonder ﬁlms (Raoul Walsh’s The Thief of Bagdad, The Lost World, Fritz Lang’s Die Nibelungen, A Matter of Life and Death),20 epics and spectacles (Ben-Hur, Spartacus, The Ten Commandments, Cleopatra, The Greatest Show on Earth, The Towering Inferno, Earthquake, Apocalypse Now),21 sword and sorcery (Excalibur, Conan the Barbarian, The Dark Crystal, The Lord of the Rings),22 ﬁlm blanc or the supernatural romantic comedy (It’s a Wonderful Life, A Matter of Life and Death, Bruce Almighty),23 the fairy-tale ﬁlm (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Splash, The Princess Bride, Shrek)24 and magic realism (The Tin Drum, Orlando).25 The purpose of this short and cursory catalogue is, obviously, not meant to be exhaustive or prescriptive; its intent is to demonstrate the multiplicity of deﬁnitional nomenclature that has emerged out of critical work done on the fantastic, and to show how porous these subcategories are in their intersecting and overlapping characteristics. Ultimately, the lessons we can draw here for the fantastic Chinese ﬁlm are twofold. First, an understanding of the fantastic in American (and European) cinema reinforces the notion that Chinese ﬁlms are not culturally insulated; the fantastic in Chinese cinemas is aﬀected and inﬂected by the global crosspollination of cinematic cultures, trends and inﬂuences. For instance, in the\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 6\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\nIntroduction 7 sword and sorcery category, David Butler describes A Touch of Zen (Xianü, King Hu, 1971) as ‘an extreme example’ with ‘cultural and spiritual depth’,26 hinting at an international connectivity. Stephen Teo echoes this point by highlighting how ‘the swashbucklers of Douglas Fairbanks, Sr . . . were popular with Chinese audiences’ and that ‘Chinese ﬁlmmakers [of the Shanghai era] attempted to cash in on the popularity by creating a Chinese equivalent of these same genres.’27 It is crucial to observe that these cross-cultural connections are not one-way streets. Illustrating this point, in the late 1990s and the 2000s, is Hong Kong director Yuen Woo-ping, who was then in high demand as a martial arts choreographer, working on big-budget studio productions like The Matrix trilogy and Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill ﬁlms and, hence, having an impact on how Hollywood ﬁlms stage action and martial arts sequences.28 In underscoring this trans-Paciﬁc feedback loop between Hollywood and Chinese cinemas, we are not diminishing in any way the cultural speciﬁcities that Chinese cinemas bring to the fantastic, which is the second lesson we can take away from the genre typologies of the Hollywood fantasy ﬁlm. It is inevitable that Hollywood’s construction of fantasy ﬁlms shapes the taste of audiences globally. But the fantastic Chinese ﬁlm brings to the table culturally speciﬁc elements and, thus, redeﬁning and reconﬁguring Hollywood genre narratives and conventions for viewers of Chinese cinemas. Drawing on the animation techniques from Disney and DreamWorks in depicting monstrous creatures on screen, Monster Hunt (Zhuoyao ji, Raman Hui, 2015) generates imagistic energy from its Chinese classical literary sources, as Mei Yang notes in Chapter 11. Tom Cunliﬀe, in Chapter 7, traces the unique history of the rare Hong Kong science ﬁction ﬁlm by acknowledging the mimicry of Hollywood trends while bringing the Hong Kong cultural and political context to bear on these ﬁlms. And, as Elaine Chung analyses in Chapter 8, the ﬁlm blanc assumes Chinese guise (via the remaking of a South Korean ﬁlm, which remade Hollywood versions of the body-swap tale), all enabled by an East Asian cinematic regionalism. Aside from appropriating and hybridising Hollywood forms, fantastic Chinese ﬁlms also oﬀer culturally unique subgenres, such as the martial arts ﬁlm, which (in addition to Stephen Teo’s contention that it is a genre trend Hollywood has helped fan in the 1920s) has a long and distinguished history that originated from Chinese classic literature and opera.29 Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9 in this volume all deal with the martial arts genre in some shape or form, while Kenneth Chan’s Chapter 12 closes our book with a case study of the cinematic adaptation of the literary epic Journey to the West (Xiyou ji, c. sixteenth century), which has become a Chinese ﬁlmic institution of its own. Following in this vein, the next section of this introduction maps in greater detail the fantastic in Chinese cultural traditions and cinematic history.\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 7\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\n8\n\nKenneth Chan and Andrew Stuckey\n\nThe Fantastic in Chinese Culture and Cinemas As a narrative mode, the fantastic has a long precedence, hailing from some of the earliest stories still extant in cultures around the world. Of course, at the time of their initial narrative occurrence, these stories may not necessarily have been perceived as fantastic (though certainly unusual and awe-inspiring), but rather as factual recounting of actual events and individuals. From the viewpoint of the broadest understanding of the fantastic as a narrative mode, Aesop’s fables (talking animals), religious and social mythologies (Biblical stories, Greek mythology, the Hindu epics), literary epics (like Beowulf and Gilgamesh) and fairy tales can all be considered fantastic narratives. Chinese storytelling is no diﬀerent in this regard. To name merely two examples, the earliest sections of The Classic of Mountains and Seas (Shanhai jing) have been dated to the fourth century bce while surreal portions of the Zhuangzi also hail from the Warring States period (476–221 bce). In its earliest form, The Classic of Mountains and Seas integrated shamanistic practices connecting the human world with various gods and spirits, as well as knowledge of medicinal, mineral and animal anomalies.30 Early Chinese histories, likewise, often incorporate legends with fantastic elements. But it is really in the medieval period, with the advent of anomaly tales (in both the shorter, epigrammatic zhiguai and the more fully realised chuanqi versions), that fantastic storytelling comes into its own in Chinese literary history.31 After this point, fantastic elements can be found across the spectrum of narrative forms, and it is also at this time that notions of ﬁctionality began to develop into sophisticated systems.32 Whether it be the resurrection of Du Liniang at the heart of The Peony Pavilion (Mudan ting), the pervasive ghost and fox spirit stories that take up such a large proportion of Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio (Liaozhai zhi yi), or the heavenly stone which ﬁnds human incarnation in Dream of the Red Chamber (Hongloumeng), the fantastic continued to play a signiﬁcant role in Chinese literary narratives. Confucius famously said that he kept his distance from ghosts and spirits (jing guishen er yuan zhi),33 and so the most respectable literary forms – poetry and history – generally avoided discussions of supernatural personages or events.34 Indeed, one of the deﬁning features of anomaly tales is precisely the fact that they are not veriﬁable history.35 Nevertheless, despite its original low ranking – in cultural regard – especially of xiaoshuo (literally, ‘small talk’ or ‘hearsay’, though by the modern period the term means ‘ﬁction’) – much of this literature over time has come to be among the most highly esteemed literary work from China. In the early twentieth century, the literary revolution promoted by such ﬁgures as Liang Qichao, Hu Shih, Chen Duxiu and Lu Xun (among many\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 8\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\nIntroduction 9 others) reversed the longstanding literary hierarchies and promoted narrative ﬁction as the foremost of literary forms. In large part, this shift was understood as an anti-traditional step that would help propel China into the modern period, undoing its insular focus on its own literary and artistic traditions and instead reorienting outwards to the global literary community.36 However, in its emphasis on realist modes and styles, the new literature and art of the twentieth century, perhaps ironically, echoed Confucius’s leeriness towards spirits (and, by extension, the fantastic or other unveriﬁable phenomenon). Even so, in a certain parallel to earlier Chinese literary history, fantastic literature, especially of martial arts derring-do, persisted and even thrived in the newly created mass market of print publications. Literary reformers, however, continued to denigrate these works as lower art forms that were included in the catchall slur of Mandarin Ducks and Butterﬂy literature.37 This understanding of the general state of literary and artistic reception of fantastic modes and forms in China in the early twentieth century allows us to locate early Chinese ﬁlm within the hierarchical spaces of artistic and cultural forms during this time. Certain scholars of early Chinese ﬁlm have emphasised the element of ‘shadowplay’ (yingxi) as the ontological basis for early Chinese ﬁlm.38 Shadowplay is understood to emphasise display and performativity over representations of the proﬁlmic world. And in its emphasis on play, early Chinese ﬁlm, like early cinemas elsewhere in the world, engaged in what Tom Gunning has termed a cinema of attractions.39 This mode of ﬁlm highlights exhibition – including sight gags, novelties, slapstick and other performances relying on physicality, optical illusions and other cinematic trickery – while disregarding narrative immersion – continuity, psychological character development or other aspects of what came to constitute classical cinema. That is to say, the cinema of attractions is a mode of ﬁlmmaking that revels in amazing displays and seems to invite the audience (rather than immerse it in a continuous story) to acknowledge and admire the skill that has been presented in the ﬁlm.40 It is worth emphasising that this early Chinese cinema developed as part of what Alexander Des Forges, adapting the term from Régis Debray, calls a mediasphere: a uniﬁed textual system constituted by a wide variety of (not necessarily aligned) discrete units – newspapers, dramatic performances both traditional and new, ﬁlm, novels, radio programmes and tea house culture – that is characterised by overlapping mutual reference and inﬂuence.41 The discontinuous but coinciding nature of this mediasphere, like serialised ﬁction, is reﬂected in the attraction of early cinema that emphasises separate spectacles united in one ﬁlm. Likewise, Chinese cinemas developed as one portion of an entertainment culture, including amusement venues such as Shanghai’s Great World that capitalised on distorted\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 9\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\n10\n\nKenneth Chan and Andrew Stuckey\n\nvisions created by the ha-ha mirror and trick photography.42 In such an environment, the cinema of attractions was merely one among many of such entertainments that gained audiences because of the amazing (and fantastic) images it displayed. Chris Berry and Mary Farquhar argue that operatic ﬁlm, the earliest genre of Chinese ﬁlm, is especially inclined to a cinema of attractions.43 Likewise, the craze for martial arts extravaganzas (which Berry and Farquhar include as an outgrowth of opera ﬁlms), beginning in the late 1920s, was in no small part spurred and sustained by special eﬀects that displayed martial arts masters ﬂying across the sky and possessing other amazing powers.44 Still, it was also at about this same time that classical narrative cinema was cementing its dominance. And in a certain alignment of interests, a cohort of younger ﬁlmmakers, inﬂuenced by the May Fourth Movement and the new literature that it spawned, entered the industry and began to promote the modern and wholesome attributes that they presumed to adhere in realist modes.45 Nearly simultaneously, in 1931, in the lead-up to the implementation of the New Life Movement, the censorship bureau of the Nationalist Party’s government (which, as a revolutionary party, even if right-wing, was also committed to the modernisation of China) banned wuxia shenguai (martial arts and spirits) movies as feudal and immoral.46 After martial arts, ghost movies are perhaps the most obvious examples of fantastic ﬁlms in Chinese cinemas. Though technically not a ghost movie, and by the end the causes underlying the surreal images are revealed to be thoroughly mundane (if terrible), Maxu Weibang’s Song at Midnight (Yeban gesheng, 1937) can be seen to inaugurate the prominence of striking imagery and surreal events in Chinese horror ﬁlms.47 This remake of the 1925 The Phantom of the Opera (Rupert Julian) accentuates the (horrifying) image of the scarred visage as both narrative device and marketing tool.48 The vast treasure trove of Chinese ghost and demon stories, especially drawn from Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio, then went on to inspire the development of horriﬁc images and narratives in Chinese ﬁlm. Stephen Teo notes that Maxu himself was one of the most important directors who instigated this mode of ﬁlmmaking in the early postwar Hong Kong ﬁlm industry.49 Moreover, in its emphasis on folk religious beliefs, primarily of Daoist and Buddhist origins, there is a certain crossover between this genre of ﬁlm and that of martial arts.50 All the same, even if realist modes, especially in Shanghai’s left-wing cinema of the 1930s, and the narrative immersion of classical cinema were dominant, elements of a cinema of attractions persisted. To give just two brief examples, the short scene of the children’s talent show in The Goddess (Shennü, Wu Yonggang, 1932) displays the same sorts of dancing or other skills of movement in which\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 10\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\nIntroduction 11 a cinema of attractions indulges.51 Perhaps even more to the point, Street Angel (Malu tianshi, Yuan Muzhi, 1937) takes special pleasure not only in displaying magic tricks and other optical illusions but also in revealing how those tricks work. Here the display of the fantastic is enjoyed even as it is revealed to be based in mundane causes.52 The political exigencies of the Second Sino-Japanese War and then the Chinese Civil War that followed it, as well as a continued emphasis on realist narrative forms, left little room for fantastic ﬁlms or other modes of the cinema of attractions during this period. Likewise, after the wars, in both the Communist Party-controlled mainland and in the Nationalist Party-controlled Taiwan, the continued emphasis on modernity (whether it be socialist or capitalist) and realist forms meant a sharp de-emphasis on fantastic imagery or storytelling in the ﬁlms produced in these regions. Thus, in its commitment to establishing a socialist society, nearly all artistic work in the PRC went into reﬂecting on China’s recent historical past or else its contemporary moment of transformation employing the mode of socialist realism. Of course, attractions persist in, for example, the exhilarating action sequences of military battles, but fantastic ﬁlms, as such, were notably repressed. And in Taiwan, the government promotion of Healthy Realism (an outgrowth and extension of the earlier New Life Movement) similarly served to downplay fantastic modes in favour of modern, realist ﬁlmmaking. There are some exceptions, naturally, such as China’s ﬁrst animation feature ﬁlm Princess Iron Fan (Tieshan gongzhu, Wan Laiming and Wan Guchan, 1941), which relates an episode from the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West.53 This ﬁlm was produced within Japanese-controlled Shanghai and thus was not strictly subject to anti-feudal concerns. More important than this, though, is the fact that animation as a technology that represents characters and events but which is in no way restricted either to perspectival realism, to biology (such as the fact that nonhuman animals do not speak) or to Newtonian physical laws is an especially conducive form through which to consider fantastic ﬁlmmaking. Likewise, in Taiwan, the continued salience of market factors, as well as a commitment to traditional Chinese culture that helped demarcate the Nationalist Party’s claim to represent the Chinese nation in contrast to the Communist Party, mitigated the modernising and realist demands of Healthy Realism. Hence, on the one hand, the classic martial arts ﬁlm, A Touch of Zen, which is adapted from a story in Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio, was produced in Taiwan. On the other hand, in the PRC, the continuation of operatic ﬁlm in the form of model opera – especially inasmuch as that form revels in hyperboles of individual bravery and commitment – likewise marks the continuation of a cinema of attractions that can easily be thought of in terms of the fantastic.54 If, for the most part, the ﬁlm industries in Taiwan and the PRC eschewed fantastic modes and images, the Hong Kong industry continued making many\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 11\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\n12\n\nKenneth Chan and Andrew Stuckey\n\nﬁlms in this vein. Again, a focus on the operatic mode (and its outgrowths, the martial arts ﬁlm and costume drama [guzhuang pian]) is quite useful here.55 All three of these ﬁlm genres were popular and ﬁnancially rewarding for the studios which set up shop in Hong Kong during and after the Second Sino-Japanese War. If, in the 1940s and 1950s, the opera ﬁlm, especially of the huangmeidiao style, was in vogue, this overlapped with costume dramas (often recounting Chinese history or famous ﬁctional or dramatic works) and martial arts, which dominated this slice of the market by the 1960s and 1970s. A particularly interesting example, from our point of view, is The Love Eterne (Liang Shanbo yu Zhu Yingtai, Li Han-hsiang, 1963).56 The ﬁlm retells the famous folktale of lovers who, unable to be together in life, are transformed into butterﬂies. For most of the ﬁlm, though sung and accompanied with traditional dramatic gestures that engage the attractions of what Weihong Bao calls ‘technologies of the body’,57 the story is related in a thoroughly mundane manner. The ﬁnal moments of the ﬁlm, however, exploit a mechanically based special eﬀect when Liang Shanbo’s grave is ripped asunder, which then cuts to an animation of the two lovers transformed into butterﬂies ﬂuttering together through the air. The era of martial arts ﬁlms which soon afterwards dominated the cinema of Hong Kong, whether the historical–culturalist ﬁlms of King Hu or the masculinist ﬁlms of Chang Che,58 elaborated on this trend for intricate costumes and premodern customs with fantastic spectacles of martial prowess and supernatural skills. These trends continued and developed into Hong Kong cinema’s New Wave. Tsui Hark is perhaps the most prominent New Wave director building on fantastic elements. Stephen Teo describes his innovations in this way: Thus beginning with The Butterﬂy Murders [Diebian, 1979], Tsui based his postmodern agenda on mutating wuxia’s fantasy tradition. This formula was applied to Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain [Xin Shushan jianxia, 1983], based on the old school fantasy of Huanzhu Louzhu’s ‘Shu Shan’ series. Tsui inducted the genre into the age of Star Wars by using that movie’s special eﬀects experts to bring the conceptual fantasy world of Zu into life on the big screen. The ﬁlm’s incorporation of 1980s state-of-the-art special eﬀects technology and its association with science-ﬁction meant that fantasy was integrated into the genre without inducing the kind of debates about its harmful or superstitious aspects that aﬀected its development in Shanghai during the late 1920s.59 Teo seems to indicate, here, that, to a certain extent (at least in terms of the martial arts genre), the fantastic ﬁlmmaking in Chinese cinemas has come full circle. Indeed, there is much truth to this notion, especially with regard to\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 12\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\nIntroduction 13 the reliance on attractions achieved by means of special eﬀects to engage and address the audience. For, as Dan North, Bob Rehak and Michael Duﬀy rather artfully theorise about special eﬀects, ‘Encoded in any ﬁlm is a metanarrative about its own production, but this is rendered more starkly when the material traces of that production are written into the image in the form of ostentatious technique and marketable spectacle.’60 As these technologies for ﬁlmic special eﬀects advance and as they continue to play a major role in box-oﬃce receipts, it is inevitable that Tsui Hark’s ﬁrst forays into fantasy martial arts would translate eﬀectively into Chinese transnational co-productions, with titles like Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wohu canglong, 2000), Zhang Yimou’s Hero (Yingxiong, 2002), Chen Kaige’s The Promise (Wuji, 2005), John Woo’s Red Cliﬀ (Chibi, 2008), Peter Chan’s Dragon (Wuxia, 2011) and Wong Kar-wai’s The Grandmaster (Yidai zongshi, 2013), extending the attractions-based – and special eﬀects-fuelled – appeal of martial arts ﬁlm in the creation of fantastic images and stories. Simultaneous with the Hong Kong New Wave’s reinvigoration of martial arts ﬁlmmaking is a similar revival of horror (or at least ghost and monster) movies. As Ackbar Abbas notes, Hong Kong cinema always works within and between genres.61 The Hong Kong horror ﬁlm has typically centred on ghosts, reviviﬁed corpses (though distinct from zombies in the Hollywood style) and demons drawn from Buddhist or Daoist representations of the underworld.62 To pick up where we left oﬀ earlier, Maxu Weibang’s relocation enabled him to continue making horror ﬁlms in the Hong Kong industry, and a few others followed his example, often adapting tales from Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio. As with martial arts cinema, the eﬀorts of the New Wave ﬁlmmakers also reviviﬁed the horror genre, with A Chinese Ghost Story (Qiannü youhun, Ching Siu-tung, 1987), though not the ﬁrst in this trend, setting the standard for later examples. Stephen Teo notes that Tsui Hark, as producer of the Chinese Ghost Story series and director of a few other horror ﬁlms himself, also made his inﬂuence felt in this genre, as he did with the martial arts ﬁlm. Indeed, through an emphasis on state-of-the-art special eﬀects and the incorporation of martial arts-style action sequences, Tsui – and other directors who followed his example – ensured that the horror and martial arts genres remained ﬁrmly bound together.63 As we proceed into the post-1997 era, and as the production and especially the ﬁnancing of movies have migrated to the PRC, these thematic elements – folk religious beliefs, loosely tied to Buddhist and/or Daoist practices, underlying fantastic ghost or demon ﬁlms – are transposed into the contemporary moment. Just as with the example of martial arts ﬁlms, it is easy to see the inﬂuence that these Hong Kong horror ﬁlms from the 1980s and 1990s have on contemporary Chinese co-productions, such as Monster Hunt, The Great Wall\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 13\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\n14\n\nKenneth Chan and Andrew Stuckey\n\n(Changcheng, Zhang Yimou, 2016) and League of Gods (Fengshenbang, Koan Hui, 2016), all of which incorporate elements of martial arts-style action with monsters or spirits drawn from folk beliefs and literary sources. A few key points can be drawn from this historical overview of fantastic Chinese cinemas. First, the two main genres of fantastic ﬁlmmaking, horror and martial arts, while distinct, simultaneously also exhibit a self-reinforcing mutual inﬂuence that serves to draw them together, as well as bringing other related genres (costume/period ﬁlms, opera ﬁlms and literary adaptations of premodern texts) into their orbit. Second, the spectacles that constitute a cinema of attractions have relied (and continue to rely) on technical aspects of ﬁlmmaking that enable audiences to perceive impossible events, actions and creatures. If, in earlier moments, these eﬀects were created through optical and editing techniques, in the contemporary moment they are increasingly composed from computer-generated eﬀects and images. This, in turn, begs the question of what constitutes the nature of animation, especially its ontological relationship both to ﬁlm and speciﬁcally to fantastic ﬁlmmaking. It also complicates the notion of indexicality, the relationship between the cinematic image and its correlative proﬁlmic subject, in this era of digital ﬁlmmaking and what D. N. Rodowick describes as the virtual life of ﬁlm.64 Third, and ﬁnally, it would be remiss on our part to ignore the jarring absence (in our historical mapping above) of certain genres that are usually associated with fantastic Hollywood ﬁlm production, such as science ﬁction, a genre which is now making its mark in the rapidly expanding Chinese co-production industries, as a result of the accessibility and aﬀordability of digital animation technologies. Recent Chinese science ﬁction titles include Bleeding Steel (Jiqi zhi xue, Leo Zhang, 2017), Shanghai Fortress (Shanghai baolei, Teng Huatao, 2019) and The Wandering Earth (Liulang diqiu, Frant Gwo, 2019), the last of which is adapted from the work of Liu Cixin, who is best known for his Hugo Award-winning science ﬁction novel The Three-Body Problem (Santi, 2008).65\n\nSino-Enchantment The brief overview sketched out above is by no means comprehensive. Instead, our goal is to map out fantastic ﬁlmmaking’s constitutive presence in Chinese cinema history, as well as to outline a few of the more prominent branches it has developed over time. We have also conﬁned our account to mainstream cinemas and have focused primarily on martial arts and horror ﬁlms. Of course, and as several of the chapters in this volume demonstrate, fantastic ﬁlmmaking has not been, nor is it currently, restricted to mainstream ﬁlms. The boundaries separating mainstream popular cinema and art/experimental ﬁlm are much more\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 14\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\nIntroduction 15 porous than most anticipate, allowing for a dialectical dynamic to occur between the two. The fantastic as a cultural cinematic practice often crosses these boundaries, making it one of the central genre modalities in Chinese ﬁlm. Although it seems obligatory to cite Tzvetan Todorov in any discussion of the fantastic (ﬁlm or literature, East or West), we are not the only ones who have found his structural analysis wanting, as we have noted earlier. One could further argue that Todorov’s structuralism leads to a ‘totalizing’ approach,66 or that his fundamentally European and modern outlook translates poorly to the (premodern) Chinese context.67 While these are certainly valid criticisms, more important is the fact that his intriguing deﬁnition of the fantastic as ‘that hesitation experienced by a person who knows only the laws of nature, confronting an apparently supernatural event’68 is of limited value in actually analysing cultural texts. That is to say, if, as the subtitle to Todorov’s book seems to indicate, the fantastic constitutes its own distinctive genre, there are almost no texts which either strive for or actually achieve maintaining the fundamental ambiguity between the ‘laws of nature’ and ‘an apparently supernatural event’ from beginning to end. Instead, and we can think of almost no examples to the contrary,69 such texts inevitably either resolve into a straightforward account of a supernatural event or reveal the natural causes that led to the misapprehension of a mundane occurrence as supernatural. That is, in Todorov’s own terms, these texts become in the end either uncanny, ‘the supernatural explained’, or marvellous, ‘the supernatural accepted’.70 At best, then, Todorov’s notion of the fantastic describes a mood which may characterise certain moments or portions of a narrative but cannot delineate a deﬁning characteristic of a unique genre. In our opinion, Bliss Cua Lim oﬀers a more fruitful direction for a consideration of the fantastic ﬁlm. Lim examines the fantastic in the context of the modern(ist) disenchantment of the world.71 She argues that the fantastic persists as vulgar – popular, devalued, disreputable – or primitive in the midst of an Enlightenment-derived, disenchanted and scientiﬁc modern outlook that scorns the fantastic as backward, superstitious, unsophisticated and gullible.72 That is, the fantastic serves the modernising discourse of rationality as a negative example of what must be transcended, superseded and left behind in the course of a universal process of modernisation. Modernity is supposed to have displaced and replaced the fantastical enchantment of religion and mystical beliefs, for instance.73 But for Lim, ‘what is most provocative about the fantastic is its capacity to insinuate the failure of modern disenchantment to completely supplant nonmodern worlds’.74 In other words, the fact that the fantastic persists indicates the incompleteness of modernity as a global project. Lim’s study examines this incompleteness from the perspective of temporality: the fantastic bears a temporality which is incompatible with modern\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 15\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\n16\n\nKenneth Chan and Andrew Stuckey\n\ntemporality based in homogenous, empty time.75 She argues that the fantastic marks ‘immiscible temporalities’ because of their incompatibility with modern, disenchanted life.76 This is a valuable insight, especially with regard to the horror ﬁlms on which Lim focuses in her study. However, we do not think we need to be limited to temporal considerations of the fantastic. In addition to temporal recursions, the fantastic is also capable of striking more general blows against the ongoing process of disenchantment and in support of a certain re-enchantment of society and culture. Indeed, rather than the failure, per se, of a fully implemented modernism, the recent collection The Re-Enchantment of the World, edited by Joshua Landy and Michael Saler, has intriguingly argued that re-enchantment is an integral part of modernity’s disenchantment of the world.77 If the rationality of the bureaucratic administration of society in concert with the scientiﬁc exploration and explanation of natural cycles, events and processes has led to the loss of traditional opportunities for wonder and mystiﬁcation in human experience, these scholars argue that this disenchantment simultaneously opens up other, newer modes of wonder. Landy and Saler identify three modes in which re-enchantment may operate. First is the binary: ‘the notion that any lingering enchantment within Western culture must of necessity be a relic, a throwback, a corner of unenlightened atavism yet to be swept clean [by modern society]’. Second is the dialectical: ‘the notion that modernity is itself enchanted, unbeknown to its subjects, in a deceptive and dangerous way’. Third is the antinomial: ‘the fact that modernity embraces seeming contraries, such as rationality and wonder, secularism and faith . . . which simultaneously enchants and disenchants, which delights but does not delude’.78 Lim’s approach, though valorising to be sure, seems to work within this ﬁrst mode, the binary. She sees fantastic narratives as ways of resisting the homogenising forces of enlightenment and colonialism. The second mode, the dialectical – as in the Frankfurt School, perhaps especially Adorno, or as in Guy Debord – emphasises the arbitrary and ultimately human-centred and humancontrolled nature of so-called ‘scientiﬁc’ truths. Landy and Saler urge us to reject both the binary and the dialectical versions of enchantment within modern life, and their volume naturally focuses on the possibilities for clear-eyed and hardnosed awe in response to modern life, that embraces both the materialism of the world in which we live, as well as the possibilities for curiosity, exploration and discovery enabled by modernity. While we agree that the antinomial approach to re-enchantment has the best potential to be intellectually stimulating, we cannot accept Landy and Saler’s dismissal of the other two. The nearly exclusive focus their collection puts on Western (especially French and German) notions of re-enchantment probably\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 16\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\nIntroduction 17 blinds them to the political – localising and potentially liberating – uses that can be made of re-enchantment, which Lim brings out in her work. Moreover, in light of the huge resurgence of religious practices across China and of a large variety of denominations since Opening and Reform, practices which have persisted in Hong Kong and Taiwan even in the face of the development of capitalist modernity, we hesitate simply to dismiss religious faith (even if we may not share that faith) as these editors do: When we speak here of re-enchantment, we do not have in mind the periodic resurgence of traditional ideas and practices (for example, the survival in some quarters of exorcism rites), or again the sporadic generation of new creeds, such as spiritualism, that have sought to replace the old. As Camus would say, to embrace such a creed is not to solve the problem of disenchantment but rather to change its terms on the sly.79 The tone here (and elsewhere in the book) smacks of the worst sort of smug intellectual elitism. Beyond that, it is also blind to the resistant politics that religious faith may enable that works against modern disenchantment in similar ways to that which Lim describes. The Chinese state’s fear of the Falun Gong sect, and even more appalling the recent wholesale repression of Uighur Muslim faith that has been called cultural genocide, are evidence for the truth of this statement. Even if, in practice, such a politics seldom emerges or is, in fact, diverted by the modern enchantment of capitalist society that the dialectical mode critiques, the potential for such a politics stemming from religious faith remains, and we think it important to acknowledge that potential. In our attempt to draw into an, at times, conﬂictual, contradictory and/ or contestatory approach to understanding the fantastic Chinese ﬁlm in the context of the multiplicity and heterogeneity of Chinese modernities80 – forms of modernity that permit traditional Chinese cultures, ideologies and religions to co-exist with technologised, hybrid and diversely politicised modernities – we bring together the binary, the dialectical and the antinomial into what we term ‘Sino-enchantment’ to engage the fantastic that we see in contemporary Chinese cinemas. Our use of the ‘Sino’ preﬁx is not intended to be reductive in its cultural attribution – that is, referring solely to the PRC and its drive to dominate what it means to be Chinese; it is also meant to echo Shu-mei Shih’s theorisation of the Sinophone, which taps into ‘a network of places of cultural production outside China and on the margins of China and Chineseness, where a historical process of heterogenizing and localizing of continental Chinese culture has been taking place for several centuries’.81 The Sinophone of Sino-enchantment ‘frustrates easy suturing . . . while foregrounding the value\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 17\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\n18\n\nKenneth Chan and Andrew Stuckey\n\nof diﬃculty, diﬀerence, and heterogeneity’.82 The cultural hybridity and heterogeneity of Hong Kong in the years just preceding its retrocession to China seem also to have come to characterise China as a whole, hence impacting the ﬁlm culture of Chinese co-productions. ‘Socialism with Chinese characteristics’, the market economy sustained within an authoritarian regime and the condition of postsocialism are all quick shorthand versions with which we might indicate the contradictions inherent in such hybridity and diversity.83 Moreover, though diﬀerences exist between Hong Kong, the PRC, Taiwan, Singapore and other Sinophone communities, to be sure, the aspect of being caught in between surely also applies to each in its own way. Fantastic ﬁlms, in their invocation of traditional practices, beliefs and possibilities for transcendence by means of advanced special eﬀects, mark a certain recognition of how Sino-enchantment brings tradition and modernity into conﬂuence with each other. Finally, we aspire to heighten the theoretical play that Sino-enchantment brings to our understanding of the fantastic by envisioning the ethical potentialities and possibilities the concept can generate. In her illuminating consideration of enchantment in modern society, Jane Bennett contends that ‘the mood of enchantment may be valuable for ethical life’, because it can ‘be deployed to propel ethical generosity’.84 The fantastic as enchantment can induce in us ‘a condition of exhilaration or acute sensory activity’,85 whose material aﬀect may evoke joyful playfulness that ‘spills over into critical consciousness and tempers it, thus rendering its judgments more generous and its claims less dogmatic’.86 The implications here for our engagement with the fantastic Chinese ﬁlm is profound, in that Sino-enchantment teaches us not only to care for the aesthetic development of Chinese cinema as a whole, but also to reach ethical positions that value human connectivity and concern, that care for life in all its forms, and that mobilise a global politics of protection and preservation of this planet we call home.\n\nThe Chapters: Sino-Enchantment Deployed The chapters in this book are distributed into three segments. The opening part, entitled ‘Visuality/Virtuality’, foregrounds the signiﬁcant growth and popularity of the fantastic Chinese ﬁlm as a consequence of digital cinema’s dominance in the new millennium. All three chapters direct their attention to the work of Fifth Generation auteur Zhang Yimou and his place in the digital era. Originally published in Modern Chinese Literature and Culture and specially revised for this book, Jason McGrath’s important essay (Chapter 2) on director Zhang’s spectacles demonstrates how enchantment with his CGI-driven creations can lead to ideologically problematic readings. Taking a diﬀerent\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 18\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\nIntroduction 19 approach is Dan North’s examination, in Chapter 3, of the technological– industrial complex that supports a major production such as The Great Wall (2016). Rounding oﬀ the section is Chapter 4, where Li Yang revisits Zhang’s critically well-worn wuxia classic, Hero (2002), to study how the fantastic infuses the genre with a suﬃcient degree of spectacle for it to attain blockbuster status. The biggest portion of the book focuses on ‘Genres of Sino-Enchantment’, where various contributors handle a diverse array of fantastic cinema. The part opener features an illuminating analysis of how fantastical elements can redeﬁne the visual experience of art/experimental ﬁlm – Andrew Stuckey illustrates this in his examination of the critically acclaimed wuxia entry The Assassin (Cike Nie Yinniang, Hou Hsiao-hsien, 2015) in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 brings readers back in time to the Shaw Brothers archive, where Shi-Yan Chao tracks director Ho Meng-hua’s work in diﬀerent fantastical subgenres. This brief historical turn demonstrates the impact that Ho’s dabbling in the fantastic had on contemporary Chinese ﬁlms, in particular in his series of four ﬁlms adapting Journey to the West. Tom Cunliﬀe’s Chapter 7 ﬁlls a signiﬁcant historical lacuna (as illustrated in this introductory chapter) by cataloguing the rare instances of Hong Kong science ﬁction ﬁlms, hence showing how these ﬁlms lay the groundwork for the current rise of the Chinese science ﬁction blockbuster today. Chapter 8 analyses 20 Once Again (Chongfan ershisui, Leste Chen, 2015), a body-swap tale that could potentially be categorised as a ﬁlm blanc title. Elaine Chung approaches this ‘chick ﬂick fantasy’ through a postfeminist lens. The section ends with Ian Pettigrew’s Chapter 10, which takes on the ‘sacred spectacle’ in the recent Detective Dee ﬁlms by director Tsui Hark, hence examining the place religion, superstition and mysticism occupy in the newly reconﬁgured wuxia shenguai pian. The ﬁnal three chapters constitute the last part of the book, entitled ‘Ethics’. In Chapter 10, Yiman Wang criss-crosses the documentary–fantasy boundary to extract an analysis of the fantastic in two ecocinematic titles, thereby illustrating the expansive terrain that Sino-enchantment traverses, beyond the genres that one usually associates with the fantastic. Mei Yang shows, in Chapter 11, the classical origins of the popular mainstream ﬁlm Monster Hunt and connects the traditional Chinese notions of family and domesticity to contemporary conceptions of modern Chinese life and its ethics. Closing the section is Kenneth Chan’s Chapter 12, which not only places Stephen Chow’s adaptation of Journey to the West in the context of the long history of ﬁlmic adaptations of the religious classic, but also rethinks the ﬁlm’s notions of enchantment and disenchantment as two sides of the same discursive coin in an expanded Buddhist ethics of planetary connections. Finally, we oﬀer a brief coda to close out the book and point to the rich potentialities that\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 19\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\n20\n\nKenneth Chan and Andrew Stuckey\n\nSino-enchantment and the fantastic can oﬀer in this diﬃcult era of political, economic and health crises across the globe.\n\nNotes 1. ‘China becomes world’s second-biggest movie market’ (last accessed 28 November 2019).

The role of science ﬁction is really quite fascinating in this regard. Chinese-language science ﬁction literature (both translated and original) has enjoyed a high tide of popularity in the new century (with roots going back even further). And science ﬁction ﬁlms, such as Avatar (James Cameron, 2009) and the Transformers series (Michael Bay, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2014, 2017), have been exceptionally strong performers with Chinese audiences. But to date, there have been few successful science ﬁction ﬁlms produced in China. Science ﬁction, like the other mainstream industrial genres we have discussed, martial arts and horror, also relies on fantastic images\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 22\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\nIntroduction 23\n\n66. 67. 68. 69.\n\n70. 71.\n\n72. 73. 74. 75. 76. 77. 78. 79. 80. 81. 82. 83. 84. 85. 86.\n\nand narratives. Given the dearth of domestically produced science ﬁction ﬁlms, we have not addressed its impact in this chapter. But it is surely relevant and important to track the ways in which fantastic science ﬁction ﬁlms intersect with the trends described here. Campany, Strange Writing, 22–3. Zeitlin, Historian of the Strange, 7. Todorov, The Fantastic, 25. The one example that Todorov himself relies on is Le Diable amoureux (1772) by Jacques Cazotte.

The term ‘disenchantment’ is usually attributed to Max Weber, as coined in the early twentieth century, but as Andrea Nightengale, Linda Simon and Michael Saler show in their respective contributions to the collection Landy and Saler (eds), The Re-Enchantment of the World, 15–71, the basis for this understanding of modern life goes back much further in history and has also elicited a wide variety of responses in philosophy, literature and practice.

A little later in the broadcast, commentator Matt Lauer observed: Bob, a nation of 1.3 billion putting on a show like this, and people at home are not alone if they’re saying it’s both awe-inspiring and perhaps a little intimidating, but they told these drummers earlier in a rehearsal to smile more, and that’s taken some of the edge oﬀ of it . . . some [dry laughter]. What exactly was ‘ﬁerce’ or ‘intimidating’ about the performances hardly needed to be spelled out, nor was the metonymic relation of the performers to their 1.3 billion Chinese compatriots questioned. While NBC’s narration of the spectacle – staged by renowned ﬁlm director Zhang Yimou – mostly hewed to the themes of harmony and openness (‘one world, one dream’) that were the oﬃcial script of the ceremonies, moments like these clearly activated a dark yet familiar alternative image of the Chinese as an undiﬀerentiated, highly disciplined mass, a threatening ‘yellow horde’ that comes from an imagination fuelled by longstanding Western racism as well as Cold War fantasies of communism. As a television critic for the Orlando Sentinel bluntly put it, the opening ceremony ‘reduced performers to cogs in a machine’ and aimed ‘to celebrate Chinese militarism’ to the extent that ‘a dance to Mao and Cultural Revolution . . . would have been in keeping with the military themes’.1 The threat invoked is that of the loss of freedom through the total subsumption of the individual by the collective, a sense that is rhetorically emphasised\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 27\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\n28\n\nJason McGrath\n\nby describing the performers’ precision not just as ﬁerce or intimidating but as downright military. None the less, the NBC commentators themselves mostly attempted to present such issues in a polite, politically correct, culturally relativist frame. For example, as a vaguely traditionally costumed performer danced upon a surface held aloft by a multitude of people below her, the commentators remarked on ‘the symbolism of this one dancer being supported by these many beneath her’, explaining that it’s a fundamental issue in the nature of Chinese culture about the relationship between the one and the many, and Zhang Yimou, who’s a master of visual symbolism, obviously here sending a message that great accomplishments – great individual accomplishments – particularly in this society rely on much more than the individual alone. Indeed, the Western imagination activated here is one overdetermined not just by the threat of communism but by past stereotypes ranging from patriarchal Confucian family values to ‘Oriental despotism’; as Daniel Vukovich has argued, the demonisation of Chinese communism is deeply imbricated in the broader orientalist discourse about China in the West.2 There is, in fact, a fundamental irony to any Western fears of an overly uniﬁed and thereby threatening Chinese society. As Tong Lam has shown, the very concept of society did not exist in China until around the beginning of the twentieth century, and it was introduced into Chinese discourse mainly as a lamented lack, in that ‘many Chinese writers contended . . . that China did not have a real society’.3 The fear was rather that, as Sun Yat-sen himself put it, China was merely ‘“a heap of loose sand” (yipan sansha) made up of four hundred million individuals’ rather than ‘a cohesive “national social body” (minzu tuanti) as solid as a rock’, and that it was thus unable to stand up to imperialist aggression from more economically and militarily advanced nations.4 A century later, of course, in the context of China’s emergence as an economic powerhouse within a precarious global capitalist system, any Western paranoia over a Chinese society so solidiﬁed as to lack individual granularity contrasts with the ongoing fear within China of social disintegration in the face of the massive forces transforming the country. Westerners’ suspicious comments on the Olympic ceremony, in fact, are perhaps motivated equally by fears of uncontrollable global economic forces. The anxiety they reveal has to do not so much with Confucian tradition or Maoist ideology but rather with the idea that the Chinese economic machine, fuelled by a vast, disciplined social workforce, will overcome Western economic hegemony. Such conditions are additionally relevant to NBC anchor Jim Lampley’s description of the Olympic ceremony as ‘a spectacle without equal in\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 28\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\nHeroic Human Pixels\n\n29\n\nOlympics history – 15,000 cast members in a futuristic production that exceeds even the most lavish of Hollywood blockbusters’. Speciﬁcally, cinematic spectacle has become one of the areas in which competition from China oﬀers both a threat and an opportunity, just as the Olympic festivities themselves were judged at least somewhat negatively according to liberal Western criteria even as they were packaged and consumed abroad for the proﬁt of global media corporations such as NBC. It is at least partly in this context that we should understand the by-nowfamiliar story of the transition of director Zhang Yimou himself from being lauded in the West as a dissident artist to being criticised for selling out to an oppressive Chinese government. In this chapter I will look in particular at how Zhang has reimagined traditional Chinese culture and history through the use of CGI in special-eﬀects blockbusters in the latter stage of his career, as well as through his work on the opening and closing ceremonies for the Beijing Olympics. One issue I will examine is the claim that Zhang Yimou’s talents have been thoroughly co-opted by the Chinese communist authorities. In particular, his 2002 ﬁlm Hero (Yingxiong) and his Olympic ceremonies choreography have been accused of promoting what is at best the crass nationalism of a Chinese state on the rise and at worst a downright totalitarian or fascist aesthetic that celebrates mindless submission of the individual to state power. I will consider such views through selected Western and Chinese criticism, as well as through the critiques of fascist aesthetics oﬀered by Susan Sontag and Siegfried Kracauer. More importantly, however, I seek to complicate such a perspective by reference to a set of theoretical terms that enable an approach to the aesthetics of human ﬁgures in these works. These terms include the ‘digital multitude’, as conceived by Kristen Whissel in her analysis of special-eﬀects blockbusters, as well as Kracauer’s divergent discussions of the ‘mass ornament’ as a manifestation either of fascism or of capitalist modernity. I will suggest that the sorts of mass spectacles organised by Zhang Yimou in the end say more about the ‘harmony’ of contemporary China with globalised capitalism than about either totalitarian aesthetics or nationalist propaganda. In fact, of much more interest than their ostensible capitulation to Chinese nationalism is their demonstration of the logic of digital labour in a globalised economy, including the surplus value oﬀered by Chinese workers within a system of global labour arbitrage.\n\nCGI and the Cultural Imaginary The CGI-enabled Chinese martial arts cinema that has come to prominence since around the turn of the twenty-ﬁrst century often draws on funding and talent from across ‘greater China’ and beyond. Special eﬀects of one kind or\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 29\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\n30\n\nJason McGrath\n\nanother have been an important aspect of martial arts ﬁlms since the silent era of Shanghai cinema, but shortly after the turn of the century the use of CGI in particular was featured in global blockbusters in the resurgent genre such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wohu canglong, Ang Lee, 2000), Hero (2002), House of Flying Daggers (Shimian maifu, Zhang Yimou, 2004), Kung Fu Hustle (Gongfu, Stephen Chow, 2004) and Red Cliﬀ (Chibi, John Woo, 2008). In such ﬁlms, digital techniques were enlisted to create spectacular illusory eﬀects corresponding to stories and images from the Chinese narrative tradition – from the Buddha’s palm motif in Kung Fu Hustle to the trick torching of Cao Cao’s armada in Red Cliﬀ’s adaptation of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguo yanyi) story. The virtual reality of CGI enables an expressionistic illusionism that frees the ﬁlmmaker from the ontological realism of traditional photography and enables a remediation in particular of the wuxia (martial arts) tradition in Chinese vernacular narrative.5 A striking example of the use of CGI to achieve aesthetic eﬀects (and emotional aﬀects) that favour expressionism over photographic realism is the scene in Hero in which, just after Flying Snow defeats Moon in a swordﬁght, all the leaves in the surrounding birch forest change within seconds from yellow to a deep blood red. The scene makes no pretence to prosaic realism but rather allows Zhang Yimou, who, from his earliest ﬁlms, could be numbered among the most painterly of contemporary directors, to become so almost literally – at least in so far as, according to the hyperbolic assertion of new media theorist Lev Manovich, in the digital age cinema ‘is no longer an indexical media technology but, rather, a subgenre of painting’.6 In fact, the technological challenges of the scene in the birch forest introduce many of the issues we will be considering here, including the complicated relationship between the actual photographic realism of on-location shooting and the photo-realist illusionism of CGI added in postproduction, but also the more speciﬁc issue of the challenge of scale in generating images of massive numbers of the same things – in this case, the leaves themselves. Mary Farquhar has detailed how the scene was put together.7 The shooting location was a real birch forest in Mongolia, and the original yellow colour of the leaves results from ﬁlming the scene at exactly the right moment in the autumn when the leaves were changing colour and beginning to fall. The further change in colour to blood red, of course, was achieved by CGI in postproduction, but the ﬁlmmakers had another problem, which was that the leaves in the forest – though carefully selected by colour and gathered to form swirling masses during the original shoot – were not nearly great enough in number to achieve the desired eﬀects, and they were falling so quickly that the trees had become too bare by the late stages of on-location\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 30\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\nHeroic Human Pixels\n\nFigure 2.1\n\n31\n\nMoon ﬁghts Snow. Source: Hero (2002).\n\nshooting. Both problems were solved through compositing, by creating computer models from the original leaves and then adding texture, variation and swirling eﬀects to achieve the masses of leaves in the ﬁnal images in the ﬁlm – in which digital leaves mix seamlessly with the ‘real’ leaves in the forest from the original photographic footage (Fig. 2.1). The leaves thus became one incidental version of the ‘digital multitudes’ we will be examining here, even carrying the sense of danger that such multitudes generally represent (to be discussed shortly), in that ‘the whirlwind of golden leaves becomes Flying Snow’s weapon’ as she fatally defeats Moon.8 Particularly with their spectacular transition from yellow to blood red, the leaves additionally are relatively straightforward as a ‘painterly’ eﬀect in that, ‘unusually, the after-footage makes the special eﬀects transparent or “visible” in a celebration of colour, movement, and death’; the painterly use of CGI does not just play a supporting role but ends up being the main focus of the scene’s last few shots.9\n\nDigital Multitudes in Martial Arts Films A more explicit example of a digital multitude in recent Chinese martial arts cinema can be found in John Woo’s Red Cliﬀ. In an especially spectacular ‘tracking’ shot (in which the camera movement is not real but virtual), a released dove ﬂies from one military encampment across the Yangzi river to another one, passing in the process a giant armada of ancient warships. Not only is the camera movement an animated illusion, but most of what we see in the image is computergenerated. The multitude of ships is a composited image; there were only a few boats of diﬀerent sizes actually built as physical models, while all the others were\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 31\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\n32\n\nJason McGrath\n\ncreated digitally out of the photographic information from the actual ones. In an interview included as a special feature on the ﬁlm’s overseas DVD release, director John Woo conﬁrms that, for most of the shot, the bird, the ships and the river are all computer-generated, and he further asserts that his producer warned him that it might be the most expensive shot in ﬁlm history – though he proceeded with it anyway, helping to make Red Cliﬀ the highest-budget ﬁlm ever produced in Asia up to that time. The result, in the case of this shot, is an unprecedentedly awe-inspiring visualisation of Cao Cao’s vast armada, helping to renew the cultural imagination of this legendary historical event vividly for contemporary audiences both in China and abroad. Cao Cao’s digital armada recalls the one in the Hollywood epic ﬁlm Troy (Wolfgang Petersen, 2004), the armada of which is ﬁrst introduced in a spectacular shot that tracks backward rather than forward, revealing an ever-greater expanse of sailing ships. Kristen Whissel mentions this shot as one example of what she labels digital multitudes, or ‘massive CG armies, swarms, armadas, and hordes composed of as many as hundreds of thousands of digital beings’.10 Exempliﬁed by such images as the seemingly inﬁnite armies of orcs and Uruk-hai in the Lord of the Rings trilogy (Peter Jackson, 2001/2002/2003), the digital multitude evokes the sublime fear of a threat that appears overwhelming, portending apocalyptic, epochal historical change. Often, as in the case of the allies facing down Cao Cao’s force in Red Cliﬀ, the narrative leads up to a massive battle pitting a grossly outnumbered minority, led by the ﬁlm’s protagonists, against a vastly superior force. Whissel mentions Zhang Yimou’s Curse of the Golden Flower (Mancheng jindai huangjinjia, 2006) as among the ﬁlms employing digital multitudes, but she does not linger much on that case – perhaps because it lacks some of the elements that she ﬁnds in other ﬁlms such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Mummy (Stephen Sommers, 1999). While Curse of the Golden Flower employs CGI in several shots to multiply into vast armies the few hundred People’s Liberation Army soldiers who were actually used as extras, those armies represent not so much an ultimate threatening other but rather rival factions loyal to diﬀerent members of the royal family in a palace intrigue. A better example from among Zhang Yimou’s ﬁlms, more akin to Cao Cao’s vast armed force in Woo’s Red Cliﬀ, would be the army of China’s ﬁrst emperor, Qin Shihuang, as depicted in Hero. That army in Hero – based on the actual historical force immortalised in the form of the terracotta warriors that the Qin Emperor had placed in his tomb – is represented as a vast, threatening multitude from the perspective of the colourful array of assassins who hope to eliminate the Qin ruler before he can militarily overwhelm their home states and subordinate them to a newly uniﬁed China. These ﬁctional assassins – Nameless (Jet Li), Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai) and his apprentice Moon (Zhang Ziyi), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung)\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 32\n\n18/03/21 4:07 PM\n\nHeroic Human Pixels\n\n33\n\nand Long Sky (Donnie Yen) – must confront the massive army of the conquering Qin forces.11 In an early sequence, for example, the Qin army advances on a tiny settlement in the state of Zhao, housing a calligraphy school where some of the assassins are staying. Throughout the sequence, dozens of shots show tight bunches of foot soldiers and archers, their density strongly accentuated by the use of telephoto lenses. Whereas these shots employ hundreds of extras, there are repeated shots of a computer-generated multitude in a type of composition described by Whissel – high-angle extreme long shots that accentuate the army’s lateral extension along the x-axis, ﬁlling the frame and spilling oﬀ the wide screen into oﬀscreen space, as well as its depth along the z-axis, extending all the way to the horizon formed by distant mountains (Fig. 2.2). As with the digital multitudes Whissel examines, such a composition serves to spatialise time, with the vast army dramatically suggesting an epochal transition in which massive destruction will lead to a new order. At the same time, such images of the Qin soldiers in Hero seem to reference directly the familiar iconography of the terracotta army that protected the actual Qin Emperor’s tomb (Fig. 2.3). The digital army in Hero unleashes a deadly metonymic digital multitude when its archers begin ﬁring their arrows en masse toward the calligraphy school, a symbol of, among other things, the independence of the state of Zhao, which the Qin ruler is determined to conquer. The thousands of arrows that the Qin archers rain down upon the school are represented as digitally generated swarms in several types of shots. Shots from the perspective of the Qin army itself show the arrows being launched into the sky in great numbers. Extreme long shots from the perspective of the settlement show the masses of arrows rising from the distant army and then taking up ever more of the screen as they race towards the ‘camera’, thus beginning as an array of specks in the distance\n\nFigure 2.2\n\n6796_Chan & Stuckey.indd 33\n\nQin army ranks.

A brief but spectacular ‘tracking’ shot early in the sequence shows the arrows approaching the settlement, seemingly from the perspective of one of the arrows in ﬂight.12 More conventional groundlevel shots show them being shot by the army or landing at the settlement, which then bristles ever more densely with fallen arrows. During part of the sequence, Nameless and Flying Snow go outside on the roof of the calligraphy school to fend oﬀ the arrows acrobatically and protect the school. These shots often reach such a degree of expressionism that the images seem to come less from photographed reality than from a cartoon fantasy, with the arrows forming almost abstract patterns of lines that are implausibly scattered this way and that by the heroic characters. Indeed, Flying Snow in particular is shown as fending them oﬀ with little more than her long sleeves. The digital swarms of arrows thus reinforce the impression of the overwhelming numbers of the Qin forces, while the small band of assassins appear somewhat like the members of the ‘Fell"
