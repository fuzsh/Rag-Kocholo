        "text": "Ding-ling-ling~~\n\nIn the quiet master bedroom,\n\nZheng Xiuyan was playing the mobile game PUBG.\n\nThe sudden ring of her cell phone startled her.\n\nWhen she looked up, she saw Su Cheng making a shushing gesture to her.\n\n“”You play your game~”\n\nSu Cheng said.\n\nThen he answered the call from Da Mimi.\n\nSeeing this, Zheng Xiuyan played her game by herself……\n\nThis was her first time playing the mobile game PUBG.\n\nAlthough she had received some instruction from Su Cheng\n\n, she was still a beginner and was not very skilled. She played the game with difficulty, fearing that she would lose the gun accidentally or that the enemy would suddenly fire and kill her.\n\nWhile directing Zheng Xiuyan’s operation, Su Cheng asked Da Mimi,”What are you doing in the middle of the night?”\n\nDa Mimi threatened,”Checking to see if you have cheated on me.””\n\n“Do I need to steal someone that President Su likes?”\n\n“You are getting too much, you bastard! Don’t push me too far!”\n\n“What can you do if you are pushed into a corner?”\n\n“Of course I’ll bite you if I’m pushed too far”\n\n“……”\n\nSure enough.\n\nThere is no woman who doesn’t like to bite.\n\nIf there is.\n\nIt’s because she hasn’t been fully developed.\n\nSu Cheng didn’t bullshit her,”Just fart, busy.”\n\nDa Mimi pouted,”It’s only ten o’clock in the evening, you are a night owl, you won’t feel sleepy until one o’clock in the morning, what are you busy with?”\n\nSu Cheng looked down at Zheng Xiuyan who was puffing up her little face,”Busy teaching others to play games.”\n\nDa Mimi asked suspiciously:”Are you cheating on me again?!”\n\nThe word”again” is very spiritual.\n\nSu Cheng opened his mouth and said scumbag words,”Even if my body cheated, my heart still belongs to you.”\n\nDa Mimi was even more suspicious,”I saw the hot search today, you went to the airport to pick up Girls’ Generation, you won’t let go of Korean girls, right?!”\n\nIt’s worthy of being a pillow person who knows everything. Sure enough, I know Cheng brother very well!!\n\nSu Cheng said one thing and meant another,”What are you thinking? It’s just a simple cooperation. Do you think Girls’ Generation can have sex whenever they want?”\n\nDa Mimi thought so too.\n\nAfter all, they are the Yazhou group.\n\nI shouldn’t have thrown myself at Su Cheng the first time I met him…….\n\nShe then mentioned the main business,”I heard that your company is preparing a love movie? What’s the name of it?”Yanjing Meets Seattle》？”\n\n“Well-informed!….”\n\n“Of course, I want to play the female lead!”\n\n“The director is Ms. Xue from Beijing Film Academy. You can go find her.”\n\n“Teacher Xue? Xue Xiaolu?!”\n\n“Have you taken her class? If you want to play the heroine, go find her.”\n\n“You are the big money sponsor, wouldn’t it be better to choose you?!”\n\nDa Mimi said coquettishly,”Just say hello to her, and I can play the female lead in just one word, isn’t it?”\n\nSu Cheng shook his head,”The premise of my cooperation with Teacher Xue is that I cannot force her to interfere with her casting. I can mention it to her, but whether she chooses you or not is up to her.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nDa Mimi made a compromise,”I heard that Tang Ren has an original drama this year, and you wrote the script.”\n\nSu Cheng smacked his lips,”Why do you keep staring at my little piece of land? The entertainment industry is so big, don’t you have other companies?!”\n\nDa Mimi smiled and said,”Who told you that you are talented? I want to act in this drama!”\n\nSu Cheng asked back,”Aren’t you at odds with Sister Cai?!”\n\nAt the beginning, Cai Yinong took Tang Xuejian’s costume off Tang Yan and put it on Da Mimi.\n\nIt was not because of Da Mimi’s age.\n\nBut she wanted to sign her to Tang Ren.\n\nWho knew that Da Mimi turned around and tricked Cai Yinong.\n\nShe didn’t sign a contract with Tang Ren.\n\nAlthough Su Cheng intervened and let Da Mimi start a company early and follow Boss Yang’s path.\n\nBut Cai Yinong was still unhappy about it.\n\nDa Mimi was very thick-skinned,”It’s better to resolve a feud than to make one. At worst, I can accompany President Cai to drink and apologize. We are all your people now. Can she kill me?”\n\n“Don’t talk nonsense, Sister Cai is my sister, a real sister.”\n\n“I am your frivolous goddaughter, so if we round it off, aren’t we a family?”\n\n“You are flexible.”\n\n“This is my greatest strength~”\n\nSu Chengxin said, isn’t your greatest strength Da Mimi?\n\nBut he said:”Don’t worry about it, this drama is not only important to Tang Ren, but also to me, and the acting skills of the heroine are very high.”\n\nDa Mimi was unconvinced and said:”What do you mean? Am I not a good actor? Who didn’t praise Lucy in”Lucy”?”\n\n“Don’t you know who Lucy’s acting is because of?”\n\n“Even if you, the director, have 99% of the credit, doesn’t it mean that I, Da Mimi, don’t have 1% of the acting skills?!”\n\n“Even if you have 1000% acting skills, it won’t help. Tang Ren hired Fan Xiaopang for his new drama.”\n\n“Fan Xiaopang also acts in TV series?!”\n\nDa Mimi looked surprised.\n\nSu Cheng asked,”Aren’t you also acting in TV series?”\n\nDa Mimi shook her head,”That’s different. I have just started to get involved in the film industry, but Fan Xiaopang has been rooted in the film industry for a long time. Besides, I act in TV series because I have a company, and she doesn’t have this concern. How did you convince her?”\n\n“Persuade with charm”\n\n“Not relying on physical strength?!”\n\n“Be careful or I will sue you for defamation. I have nothing to do with her.”\n\n“……”\n\nDa Mimi was a little disappointed,”So, I have to find new works by myself?!” (To read exciting novels, go to Faloo Novel Network!)\n\nSu Cheng asked,”Has”Gu Jian Qi Tan” been filmed?”\n\nDa Mimi replied,”Almost.”\n\nSu Cheng advised,”Don’t rush to film the next drama. One high-quality work is better than ten bad movies and dramas. Quality is more important than quantity.”\n\nDa Mimi couldn’t help but complain,”I have to support the company. Mi Tao Media depends on me alone.” Su Cheng coaxed\n\n,”Since you want to be the boss, you can’t think about problems with an artist’s mindset. Don’t you know how to train new people? Don’t let others say anything. Just promote Reba first. Wouldn’t it be much easier for you?”[]\n\nDa Mimi’s main theme is”I rely on men and I am shameless,””You’ve already eaten Reba, why don’t you help me think of a solution?”\n\n“Let’s wait until”Gu Jian Qi Tan” is broadcast.”\n\n“It’s still early. This is a fairy tale drama, and you asked me to make it according to the quality standards. After the filming is completed, the post-production will take at least three to five months.~”\n\n“I will ask Sister Cai to arrange for her to play a few small roles”\n\n“Tang Ren has so many projects this year.”\n\nDa Mimi said:”Mi Tao Media is also your child, you can’t be too biased.”\n\nSu Cheng said:”Given the current scale of Mi Tao, I will arrange for you to produce several dramas at the same time, can you handle it?”\n\nDa Mimi:”……”\n\nSu Cheng:”Nothing, hang up now. My teammate is too bad. I want to play with her in a duo row.”\n\nDa Mimi is also an internet addict. She asked excitedly:”What are you playing? League of Legends? Add me in a 3p row.”\n\nSu Cheng chuckled,”Play League of Legends and eat PUBG at the same time. If you come over, you can play in a 3p row. It’s inconvenient because you’re too far away.”\n\nDa Mimi was full of question marks.\n\nIsn’t it enough to have an internet connection to play games?\n\nWhy can’t you play in a 3p row if you’re too far away?!\n\nHowever, Su Cheng didn’t give her a chance to ask. He hung up the phone directly.\n\nLooking at Zheng Xiuyan’s clumsy technique.\n\nSu Cheng couldn’t help shaking his head,”I’ll play with you in a duo row.”\n\nZheng Xiuyan was ashamed,”I’m sorry, Oppa, I’m already studying very hard.”\n\nSu Cheng touched her tender face and her hands that were a little stiff due to constant micro-manipulation,”I know you tried your best. I can see that you have no gaming experience. It doesn’t matter. I’m experienced. Just follow my pace.”\n\nZheng Xiuyan nodded obediently,”Oppa, please teach me”\n\n“Come, give me the 98K”\n\n“OK OK~”\n\n“Look, the first step in shooting is to be accurate.”\n\n“Wow, so accurate! Why is it bleeding?”\n\n“Because I shot him in the head. Don’t be afraid, you can still play.”\n\nA game had just started for a few minutes.\n\nAs a beginner, Zheng Xiuyan had just started to enjoy the fun.\n\nThe cell phone rang again.\n\nBut this time it was not Su Cheng’s phone.\n\nIt was Zheng Xiuyan’s.\n\nZheng Xiuyan looked at the caller ID and decisively chose to reject the call.\n\nAs a rhythm master, Su Cheng took her to experience the joy of double row, and asked,”Who’s calling?” Jung Soo- yeon is not like Su Cheng who can do two things at the same time. Seeing the enemy’s accurate shots, she was so scared that she trembled all over and stammered,”My sister~”\n\nSu Cheng’s heart warmed.\n\nf(x) is a second-generation Korean group.\n\nAlthough it is not as famous as Girls’ Generation, it was once very popular.\n\nSeveral members of the team: Choi Sulli, Song Qian, and Jung Soo-jung are all top-notch beauties.\n\nAmong them, Choi Sulli is a pity.\n\nAt such a young age, she was exposed online and died of depression.\n\nSong Qian later returned to China to develop.\n\nAlthough she is not a top star, she is also a popular star.\n\nSu Cheng’s favorite is Jung Soo-yeon’s sister Jung Soo-jung.\n\nThis girl debuted at the age of fifteen.\n\nHer figure and appearance are both top-notch.\n\nIf there is a chance, I will take her to play PUBG with her sister in a three-person team.\n\n……\n\nSu Cheng couldn’t help but be full of anticipation.\n\nZheng Xiuyan felt his anticipation.\n\nThinking of the message her sister had sent her before, she couldn’t help but blush.\n\nI’m dying!!\n\nWhy did the game suddenly become so exciting?……\n\nSu Cheng reminded her,”Your sister called late at night. Maybe she has something to do. Do you want to answer it?”\n\nZheng Xiuyan’s heart trembled,”But our game hasn’t ended yet.”\n\nSu Cheng smiled wickedly,”It’s okay, you don’t have to operate it, I’ll operate it, it won’t delay your call, answer it quickly.”\n\nSu Cheng directly pressed the answer button for her.\n\nRequest for custom order!
