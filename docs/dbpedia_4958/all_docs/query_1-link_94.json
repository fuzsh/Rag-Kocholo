        "text": "As the Fall 2018 television season is preparing to hit fit swing in the coming weeks, the return of Dancing with the Stars is quickly upon us. Season 27 of the long-running reality show will premiere in September with an all-new star-studded lineup decked out in glitzy, shimmering outfits as they hit the dance floor with their best moves.\n\nWith this in mind, here's everything for loyal DWTS devotees to know about Season 27.\n\nWhen Does Season 27 Air?\n\nABC's popular reality series is set to kick off on Monday, September 24 at 8 p.m. ET. Ballroom experts Len Goodman, Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tonioli are returning as the show's judges as well. As in previous runs, the celebrity contestants and their professional dance partner's fate in the competition will be determined by scores from the judges and feedback from the audience.\n\nWho Are The Pros?\n\nOn August 29, ABC revealed its lineup of professional dancers set to compete September. Fans, however, won't see Peta Murgatroyd and her husband Maksim Chmerkovskiy in the upcoming season. Despite this, here are the 13 dancers scheduled to appear on DWTS Season 27:\n\nBrandon Armstrong\n\nLindsay Arnold\n\nAlan Bersten\n\nSharna Burgess\n\nCheryl Burke\n\nWitney Carson\n\nArtem Chigvintsev\n\nValentin Chmerkovskiy\n\nSasha Farber\n\nJenna Johnson\n\nKeo Motsepe\n\nGleb Savchenko\n\nEmma Slater\n\nWhich Stars Have Been Cast?\n\nABC shared Wednesday Nancy McKeon, best known for starring on The Facts of Life, has signed on to compete for the Mirrorball Trophy. McKeon will be partnered with Chmerkovskiy. She's the only celebrity to be announced so far\n\n\"He is awesome,\" McKeon, 52, said on Good Morning America Wednesday. \"He is the most amazing partner. [He has] more patience than anyone I know...I'm so lucky!\"\n\nWho Is Rumored To Be Cast?\n\nWhile McKeon is the only official celebrity cast member to be unveiled so far, there have been rumors as to who else is slated to join her on Season 27. According to Reality Steve, Bachelor in Paradise star Joe Amabile and on-air radio personality Bobby Bones will compete as well.\n\n\"I haven't seen any DWTS spoilers, so if some outlet has already spoiled this, my apologies and I'll give them credit,\" Reality Steve tweeted Monday. \"But Grocery Joe is on DWTS this season.\"\n\nBurgess took to Twitter on Sunday to detail how practices have been going with her partner.\n\n\"I've been so immersed in prepping, rehearsal and my partner that I totally haven't hinted for you guys yet,\" Burgess, 33, tweeted. \"Here's what I'll tell you....we laugh A LOT, we work so hard every minute of rehearsal already. He's in this for the right reasons & with a heart of gold. In just 3 days he's grown so much already, and I think you're all going to adore him. I already do.\"\n\nReality Steve indicated Burgess' partner was Bones, tweeting Monday: \"Got emailed that Sharna's DWTS partner is Bobby Bones. Those people would know better than me. Regardless, Joe is definitely on DWTS.\""
