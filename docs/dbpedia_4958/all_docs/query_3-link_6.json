News at the time.\n\nCredit: David Fisher/Shutterstock\n\nJulianne Hough\n\nAppeared: Seasons 4-8\n\nReason for Exit: Hough admitted that she wanted to work on other projects. \"It's because I really, really want to focus on the music and, you know, kind of be taken seriously a little bit,\" Hough explained to Ryan Seacrest in 2009.\n\nShe returned in 2023 as the cohost of season 32 alongside Alfonso Ribeiro.\n\nCredit: MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nDerek Hough\n\nAppeared: Seasons 5-11, Seasons 13-21 and Season 23\n\nReason for Exit: In November 2016, Derek revealed that he wasn't sure whether he was coming back because he had \"a few projects\" coming up. \"I didn't think I was going to come back to the show a couple times now and ended up coming back. That show will always be my family,\" he told TV Guide, before joining World of Dance as a judge.\n\nHe returned to DWTS for season 29 for his first season as a full-time judge.\n\nCredit: Mediapunch/Shutterstock\n\nMark Ballas\n\nAppeared: Seasons 5-22, Season 25, Season 31\n\nReason for Exit: Ballas claimed in April 2018 that he didn't have plans to return. Four years later, he won season 31 with partner Charli D'Amelio. Ballas retired once more in March 2023.\n\n\"I've done 20 seasons now. I started this journey when I was 21, 22 and honestly being able to dance and perform for you fans — you guys are the best fans. ... Thank you guys for a lifetime of memories. I appreciate it. I'm not saying this is the end. This is just the last time I'll be dancing with a partner,\" he said during a live DWTS tour performance.\n\nCredit: Paul A Hebert/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nChelsie Hightower\n\nAppeared: Seasons 8-12 and Seasons 14-15\n\nReason for Exit: Hightower left after season 15 and later reflected on how her anxiety made it \"hard to stay motivated and push through the pressure of dancing on national TV.\"\n\n\"After my five-year run on DWTS, I finally moved home and started seeing a therapist and getting the help I needed to manage those feelings,\" she revealed to Dance Spirit in January 2019.\n\nCredit: Chelsea Lauren/Shutterstock\n\nAllison Holker\n\nAppeared: Seasons 19-21 and Season 23\n\nReason for Exit: Holker revealed that she wouldn't be returning after the season 24 lineup was announced. \"Hey guys, I wanted to be the first to reach out to all my family, friends and fans to say that I will not be returning to DWTS this season,\" she wrote on Instagram at the time. \"I truly adore my DWTS family, It's all love and I'm so excited for all of the competitors who are participating this season.\"\n\nCredit: MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nMaksim Chmerkovskiy\n\nAppeared: Seasons 2-5, Seasons 7-15, Season 18 and Seasons 23-25\n\nReason for Exit: Following his 2018 departure, Chmerkovskiy shared that he was looking forward to supporting the show from the sidelines. “I’m excited about all the opportunities. I keep saying the platform has been amazing. It’s great to see new faces especially representing ballroom dance,” he told Us in March 2020. “We’ve had an incredible wave of new people that are now representing the same way, and probably better.”\n\nCredit: John Photography/Shutterstock\n\nPeta Murgatroyd\n\nAppeared: Seasons 13-20, Season 22, Seasons 24-25 and Seasons 28-29\n\nReason for Exit: \"As many of you know, after 10 years with @dancingabc, I will not be returning for Season 30,\" she wrote on Instagram in September 2021. \"While I will miss being a part of the show, I’m excited to continue to focus on other projects and my business endeavors, along with spending quality time with family.\"\n\nCredit: Broadimage/Shutterstock\n\nLindsay Arnold\n\nAppeared: Season 16, Seasons 21-28 and Season 30\n\nReason for Exit: Arnold decided against returning for season 31, instead choosing to focus on her family. “As many of you know my family and I live in UT and in order to do DWTS I have to move myself and my daughter Sage out to LA and leave behind my husband Sam [Cusick] who works full time here in Utah,” she wrote via Instagram in August 2022. “Logistically there is SO much involved with making this happen and there is a lot of sacrifice that has to be made that unfortunately just did not feel right for us this time around.”\n\nCredit: John Photography/Shutterstock\n\nSharna Burgess\n\nAppeared: Seasons 16-27, Seasons 29-30\n\nReason for Exit: The Australia native announced in August 2022 that she would not be returning for DWTS season 31 in order to prioritize her newborn son, whom she is still breast-feeding.
