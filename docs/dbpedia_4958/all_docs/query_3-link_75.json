        "text": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy won't be competing on Monday's episode of \"Dancing With the Stars,\" ABC News reports.\n\nThe dancing pro sustained a calf injury on Friday while rehearsing with partner, former \"Glee\" star Heather Morris, which will force him to sit out of the competition this week.\n\nSEE ALSO: Adele at final 25 show: 'I don't know if I will ever tour again'\n\nAlan Bersten will replace Chmerkovskiy in the competition this week.\n\nSee photos of Maksim Chmerkovskiy:\n\nThe injury news comes just one week into season 24 of the show. Chmerkovskiy and Morris faced criticism before the competition even began because of Morris' background as a professional dancer.\n\nWhen we caught up with Chmerkovskiy ahead of the \"Dancing With the Stars\" season premiere, he called Morris' inclusion in this season's cast a \"huge step for everybody in the dance community\" and said that he's \"not worried about what people are going to say\" about her supposed advantage.\n\nIt's unclear how long Maks' Chmerkovskiy's injury will keep him out of the competition.\n\nSee photos from the \"DWTS\" premiere:"
