        "text": "3 Reasons to Scroll Past “What I Eat in a Day” Posts\n\nSocial media offers an open lens into the lives of whoever is willing to share. This is especially enticing for aspiring dancers who are hungry to gain access into a professional’s routine—how they’re both achieving and navigating a career. But a dancer’s newsfeed isn’t just home to inspiring choreography and pirouette hacks. It can also include performers narrating everything they do in a day, including their cross-training routine and the foods that go along with it.\n\nWhile the intent behind “What I Eat in a Day” posts is often harmless, the reality is that they can lay the groundwork for a dancer’s struggle with food. Dancers are already more vulnerable to harmful food and body beliefs that risk disordered eating—adding another source for comparison can leave dancers feeling doubtful; wondering if their choices are “good” or “bad,” and, potentially, inducing guilt if their meals and snacks don’t align with what is deemed acceptable for a dancer. As a dietitian for dancers, I encourage artists to think about the influence that “What I Eat in a Day” posts might have on them—and to consider scrolling right past them.\n\nThey’re Not a Reflection of Your Individual Needs\n\nComparing what one dancer eats to another dancer’s meal plan makes it difficult to both identify and honor the body’s individual needs. The types and amounts of food that are needed to support a dancer’s body are highly variable and dependent­ on many factors that go beyond what a single reel can depict. Simply put, what works for one dancer might not work for another. Those attempting to follow someone else’s eating routine might risk behaviors that leave them underfueled and undernourished—a recipe for injury.\n\nThey’re Often Inaccurate\n\nSocial­ media is a highlight reel and the missing factor in most of these posts is a dancer’s relationship with food. It’s unlikely that a dancer’s “What I Eat in a Day” is showing the complete picture. Additional helpings of food, impromptu snack times, or experiences that dancers might feel don’t live up to the misguided expectations set forth by diet culture are all examples of what might be cut out. And there’s the fact that a single day’s worth of meals and snacks isn’t all that is supporting a dancer’s performance potential. Eating patterns over time—this includes fueling and hydration efforts, along with sleep patterns and training routines—matter. One snapshot will never reflect enough of what is needed to support a dancer’s capabilities.\n\nThey Can Trigger and Worsen Disordered Eating\n\nRestrictive eating is unfortunately normalized in today’s wellness-driven culture, with “clean” eating being a common culprit. Since many dancers unintentionally partake in such eating habits, there’s the likelihood that any “What I Eat in a Day” vlog may represent a disordered way of eating. Whether it’s not eating enough calories or attempting to abide by strict food rules, dancers—who have unique nutritional needs because of their physically demanding art form—might be contributing to a narrative that supports disordered eating.\n\nAre Food Posts Totally Off the Table?\n\nThey don’t have to be. There’s a difference between sharing inspirational food content (like recipes and snack ideas) and then sharing that same content with nutritional advice alongside it. To help reduce the risk of disordered eating among dancers, it’s recommended to source food advice from registered dietitian nutritionists who are particularly familiar with the unique needs of dancers.\n\nThe post 3 Reasons to Scroll Past “What I Eat in a Day” Posts appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n“So You Think You Can Dance” Season 18 Kicks Off With a Slew of Changes\n\nWhen the new season of “So You Think You Can Dance” premieres on March 4, it will be with a host of changes both on screen and behind the scenes. Front of mind for many will be the absence of the late Stephen “tWitch” Boss, who served on the judging panel last season after being a beloved competitor and All-Star in previous seasons and whose death was widely speculated to be a factor in the show not returning in its usual summer slot in 2023. Boss’ widow, “SYTYCD” All-Star Allison Holker, joins the new-but-familiar panel of judges for Season 18 alongside Maksim Chmerkovskiy of “Dancing with the Stars” fame and returning Season 17 judge JoJo Siwa. (Siwa replaced Nigel Lythgoe on the panel after the executive producer stepped back from the show following allegations of sexual assault that were filed by Paula Abdul and others.) All-Star Comfort Fedoke also joins the judging panel for auditions.\n\nThe judging panel is not all that’s new. After the auditions round, 10 dancers will compete in challenges intended to reflect a freelance commercial-dance career, such as performing in music videos, football halftime shows, or Broadway numbers—a departure from dancing on a soundstage in short routines of rotating styles, the show’s signature. Rather than audiences voting live for their favorite dancers (filming reportedly began in Atlanta, rather than in Los Angeles as in previous years, in early December), eliminations will be entirely up to the judges.\n\nPerhaps the most eyebrow-raising facet of the show’s new format: While in previous seasons, short, behind-the-scenes packages of rehearsal footage and interviews introduced each routine, this season “viewers will get a documentary-style inside look at the contestants’ dynamics, following them throughout the competition as they go through their personal and competitive journeys, including the daily struggles, new relationships, personality clashes and more,” according to a release. What will the seemingly more “reality TV” angle mean for the dancers on the show, and will the winning competitor’s title still be “America’s Favorite Dancer” with voting seemingly out of the audience’s hands? Fans will have to tune in on Fox (or the day after on Hulu) to find out.\n\nThe post “So You Think You Can Dance” Season 18 Kicks Off With a Slew of Changes appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\n“SYTYCD” Auditions: A Contestant Brought Allison Holker to Tears with tWitch’s Memory\n\nIt’s baaack! After almost two years off the air, our favorite dance show (we love you, too, “DWTS”) made its revamped return to FOX for its 18th season. Host Cat Deeley described the new season as a “refresh,” and it is, considering the beloved dancers and choreographers sitting at the judges table—Allison Holker, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, JoJo Siwa, and Comfort Fedoke who’s stepping in to evaluate the talent at auditions.\n\nIn case you missed last night’s premiere, here are all the dancers who made it through, along with the touching tribute that even brought us to tears.\n\nRoman Nevinchanyi\n\nWatching 26-year-old Latin ballroom dancer Roman Nevinchanyi’s electrifying audition to “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” seemed like the best way to kick off round one of auditions.\n\nRoman, who left his hometown Kyiv and hasn’t seen his family (who are now safe in Germany) since the war began, was voted to continue in the competition after he proved his partnering skills with Maksim and a female ballroom dancer.\n\nEaston Magliarditi\n\nNext up, 19-year-old Easton Magliarditi, who previously auditioned for the “SYTYCD: The Next Generation,” blew us away with his remarkable control and aerodynamic quality. But we weren’t the only ones astounded. Allison said he was “powerful and graceful,” Maksim thought it was an “incredible” performance, and Comfort said it was “picturesque.” Which meant yeses all around—plus a standing ovation!\n\nOlivia Alboher\n\nA self-confessed “dancefluencer” with 2.2 million followers on TikTok and counting (we can see Maksim still shaking his head), 22-year-old Olivia’s proved that she isn’t just a social media dancer. Allison thought it was “beautiful” how she floated and used the stage. And Comfort was impressed by her split into grand plié and back. Seriously, so were we! No wonder Olivia received a “yes, yes, yes” from the judges.\n\nOshae “King Wavy” Young\n\nA breaker who was first inspired to dance by the movie You Got Served, Oshae proved his passion for dance was strong enough for him to be willing to risk his health. He has arrhythmia, and even though he had to get a pacemaker put in his heart, that hasn’t stopped him from dancing. The judges felt like he could have brought more heat to the performance and weren’t sure how versatile he’d be taking on other dance styles, but he moved on in the competition with two yeses from Allison and Comfort.\n\nDakayla Wilson\n\nAfter some eliminations and routines that weren’t quite ready for prime time, we met Dakayla Wilson. A trained gymnast who, according to Allison, could literally “step on any set right now” (we couldn’t agree more), Dakayla also hyped up the other judges with her routine. Maksim loved her facial expressions and Comfort called her performance “a breath of fresh air.” It’s clear she has the “it” factor needed to sustain a career in the dance industry—a resounding yes.\n\nJin Lee\n\nSo far, the season premiere showcased mostly contemporary and hip-hop performances—some great, others not so great, so we were intrigued when Jin told us what her performance style would be: bone breaking, Chinese folk, and waving. Her performance brought Comfort and Allison to tears, and it came as no surprise that her audition was a “yes” for all the judges.\n\nPost-performance, Jin honored her father, who recently passed, and thanked Allison for carrying on TWitch‘s dance legacy. “Stephen ‘tWitch’ Boss was and will forever be an icon and a legend because he was truly the best at what he did,” Holker tearfully said, “but also because he brought out the best in everyone around him.”\n\nHonoring “tWitch” and his enduring legacy in the dance community was the perfect way to end the first episode.\n\nThe post “SYTYCD” Auditions: A Contestant Brought Allison Holker to Tears with tWitch’s Memory appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\n“SYTYCD” Week 2 Auditions: The Dancer Who Was Told She Would Never Dance Again\n\nIt’s the second day of auditions in Los Angeles, and the search for America’s Favorite Dancer is on. So in case you missed last night’s episode, here are all the standout dancers who made it through day two.\n\nBraylon Browner\n\nBefore he even started dancing, it seemed that 18-year-old Braylon had already won the judges over with his upbeat, positive energy. But once he started moving, the judges were even more impressed. All three judges gave Braylon a standing ovation—and three yeses.\n\nMadison Rogue Alvarado\n\nThe judges had the chance to see Madison “Just Dance”—and more. After her jazz performance, Comfort asked Madison if she was pulling from personal experience during her performance, and it turned out she was: her two-year struggle with an eating disorder.\n\nMadison started to tear up while talking about her trauma, and Maksim stepped up to tell her that he is “in [her] corner.” Her audition earned a yes from Maksim and Comfort and an “absolute yes” from Allison, who thanked her for being vulnerable.\n\nArianna Santos\n\nNineteen-year-old Arianna brought something a little different to the “SYT” stage: a little flamenco, a little hip hop, and a whole lot of fusion. Though, for the judges, it wasn’t enough fusion. They saw more hip hop than flamenco and, initially, chose not to send Arianna through.\n\nBut (spoiler alert!) everyone loves a second chance, and the judges are no exception. After seeing another dancer perform, Allison voiced her concern, saying she was “kind of questioning one of [her] decisions.” With the sign-off of the other judges, Allison brought Arianna back in, and sent her through to the choreography round.\n\nKaylee Bays\n\nTwenty-seven-year-old Kaylee started dancing when she was only 3. But at 21, she was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and told she would never dance again. She decided to compete on “SYTYCD” not only to follow her dream but to raise awareness for her condition, for which there is currently no cure.\n\nAfter her stunning performance, the judges checked in with Kaylee to see if she felt her limited mobility would hold her back in competition. But Kaylee stayed strong, voicing that there is “no style [she] can’t adapt.” The judges took her at her word and moved her on to the next round.\n\nAvery Gay\n\nAvery entered the competition alongside two of her fellow dancers from her home studio in Tucson, Arizona. But it was her contemporary ballet routine, performed on pointe, that stood out to the judges. Though they asked her to really push herself moving forward and get out of her comfort zone, Avery made it through to the next round.\n\nCole Neville\n\nThere was something immediately a-heel-ing (sorry, not sorry) about 22-year-old Cole’s performance. But on a more serious note, we were so excited to see their performance and glad to hear Allison’s reminder of how hard it is to dance in heels like Cole did. It was a “resounding yes” from Maksim, Allison, and Comfort.\n\nJainil Mehta\n\nLast night’s episode featured all the fusion, and Jainil’s audition was no exception. He combined Indian dance with hip hop and contemporary to create a performance that didn’t just bring the technique, it told a story. Comfort loved that Jainil “brought something different,” and all three judges were easily in agreement: yes!\n\nKenidee Allen\n\nNext up was Kenidee from West Haven, Utah. Though she had serious health troubles growing up, Kenidee has since recovered and continues to pursue her dream of dancing.\n\nMaksim announced that he would be sitting this round of judging out, since he previously worked with Kenidee, when she appeared with him and his brother on their SAVOR After Hours tour (NBD, Kenidee). But that didn’t stop him from giving Kenidee honest feedback, telling her that it wasn’t his favorite performance of hers. Allison and Comfort, however, responded more positively to Kenidee’s classic jazz solo and put her through to the next round.\n\nNext week, we’ll see the audition round come to a close, and we’ll know exactly who will be competing for the title of America’s Favorite Dancer. And maybe we’ll even get to see Maksim cry at least one more time!\n\nThe post “SYTYCD” Week 2 Auditions: The Dancer Who Was Told She Would Never Dance Again appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\nThe Most Memorable Dance Moments From the 2024 Academy Awards\n\n2024 was a big year for dance at the Oscars, including a history-making performance, a heart-pumping ensemble number, and a surprise addition to the “In Memoriam” segment.\n\nWe’re still rooting for a “Best Choreography” category as dance continues to be an integral part to each year’s nominated films. But until then, we still enjoy seeing our beloved artform on the Dolby Theater stage.\n\n“Wahzhazhe” from Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nEight Osage Nation dancers joined Scott George and the Osage Tribal Singers in a historic performance of “Wahzhazhe (A Song For My People)” from Killers of the Flower Moon. George made Oscars history as the first Native American to receive a nomination for best original song with “Wahzhazhe.” He is also the first member of the Osage Nation to be nominated by the Academy.\n\nAs the dancers and singers followed the drum against a sunset backdrop, they invited the international audience to witness a simultaneously intimate and boundless celebration. A groundbreaking performance, it marked the first time members of the Osage Nation, or of any indigenous community, has danced on the Oscars stage.\n\n“I’m Just Ken” from Barbie\n\nIt’s safe to say that the Oscars felt the “Kenergy” after Ryan Gosling and his ensemble of Kens took to the stage with Barbie’s tongue-in-cheek power ballad, “I’m Just Ken,” which was also nominated for best original song. The number, choreographed by Mandy Moore, featured several members from the film’s original cast, including Simu Liu and Kingsley Ben-Adir, and was complete with a kickline, unapologetic melodrama, cardboard cutout–ography, and on-the-nose references to Jack Cole’s choreography for “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend.” Oh, and Slash.\n\nBest Actress winner Emma Stone later pointed to the performance as the culprit behind her tearing her dress. (Don’t worry, Emma, we were dancing too.)\n\nThe “In Memoriam” Segment\n\nA welcome surprise for some and an irritating visual distraction for others, this year’s “In Memoriam” tribute featured an ensemble of dancers that accompanied Andrea and Matteo Bocelli as they sang the former’s hit “Time to Say Goodbye.” This was not the first time dance has appeared in the segment; in 1996, Savion Glover tapped to “Singin’ in the Rain” in a tribute to the late Gene Kelly, who passed away that year. This year’s performance included a subtle and touching moment for the late Chita Rivera, who died on January 30—a simple weight shift and slow-motion hip sway, facing Rivera’s photo on the projection screen.\n\nWhile the dancers brought stunning synchronicity and reverent artistry to Moore’s second choreographed work of the night, the performance has earned pushback from audience members who found them and the Bocellis distracting.\n\nThe post The Most Memorable Dance Moments From the 2024 Academy Awards appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nHow a Secret Society of Dancers Is Making Their Voices Heard\n\nWhen Traequan Middleton was growing up in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, New York, it wasn’t unusual for him to corral his friends and design intricate dances on them. “I was always the person to lead the pack,” Middleton remembers. Today, his knack for leadership hasn’t waned. In fact, he created and directs one of the city’s most popular youth dance ensembles: Secret Society Dance Company.\n\nLike Middleton as a child, the dancers of Secret Society live in Astoria public housing, so when he looks at his students, he doesn’t just see their faces—he sees himself. That sense of connection has made his work as a teacher and mentor deeply personal. “What the youth can actually get now, I didn’t really have that when I was brought up,” he says. “So since I’m put in a position to show the youth how to be the next generation of change, why not go for it?”\n\nAlong with championing their biggest dreams, Middleton also ensures that if his students want to have careers in dance, they can. And when it comes to training, Middleton runs a tight ship. “This is their second [home],” he says with a laugh, noting the heaps of time the dancers spend in the studio. Over at least four days each week, the dancers, ages 11 to 21, rehearse and take classes weekly in a range of forms, including hip hop, contemporary, and step dance—and they seem to love every minute of it. “My favorite part about dancing with Secret Society is experiencing growth,” says Ramiyah Anderson, 11. As a dancer who hasn’t had much experience performing, Anderson says she values that Middleton and her peers want to help her become a stronger dancer. And as it stands, that hard work is paying off.\n\nThe 25-member group, which Middleton founded in 2014 and is part of the HANAC Astoria Cornerstone Youth Programming, has won numerous dance competitions in the tri-state area, coming out on top in two categories in 2022 at the Battle for the Belt event in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Part of what makes these victories so sweet, according to one of its newest members, is the group’s ethos of care. “I’ve been in a lot of dance companies,” Amiyah McArthur, 17, says, who joined the company in September. “Some dance companies are very competitive within the dance group, but Secret Society has been very welcoming.” From her first day with the troupe, she noticed that she was able to express herself freely without feeling judged. She attributes this inclusive environment to Middleton, who, she says, emphasizes that “we are actually all in this together to build each other up and to give back to the community.”\n\nThat focus on community has made Secret Society a major artistic force in New York City, allowing the dancers to leverage their popularity to help raise awareness around issues affecting their families and peers. Middleton, with the dancers, curates bimonthly performances for the community, each with a different theme. Their most recent performance addressed intracommunity violence. “We have members on the team who have lost their loved ones and parents to senseless acts of violence,” Middleton says. “So I just try to give the kids the opportunity to learn what somebody may be going through.” The group has also tackled issues like voting rights and LGBTQ+ equality, partnering with other dance teams throughout the city to amplify their messaging. Sometimes, these messages transcend city lines, spilling out to people all over the world through social media. In one of its popular YouTube videos, the group dances to a medley of songs to advocate for the protection of Black life. Sporting Black Panther Party–style berets and variations of white and black tops and bottoms, the dancers move with intensity and emotional range, encompassing sharp, full-bodied movements and smaller yet charged gestures.\n\nPerformances like this have helped the dancers appreciate how liberating dancing, and community, can be. “It’s always a plus when your peers [support] you expressing yourself, because some people need to have a little push,” Anderson says. “I think it’s really nice that we not only express ourselves, but express the topics that are going on in the community.”\n\nBeyond developing rewarding movement practices and deep community ties, the dancers say they are learning life lessons from Secret Society that they can apply to their everyday lives. “I’ve learned how to be more patient,” McArthur says. “I’ve learned that things take time, and there’s a process to everything.”\n\nBut they’re also witnessing what a combination of hard work, stamina, and vision can produce, a recipe that has helped Middleton get to where he is today. Through him, the students say, they see that their goals are within reach. “I can see many of us having professional dance careers because of the training that we get,” McArthur says. “Secret Society gives you a sense of discipline for the real world.” Artistically, she says, Middleton and the company are pushing her to think outside of the box, to go beyond the limits she puts on herself, and to “be comfortable with the uncomfortable.”\n\nFor Anderson, her time with Secret Society has taught her the importance of a solid work ethic. “When you dance, you have to work hard to get what you want,” she says. “You have to do multiple steps in life to get you to where you want to be.”\n\nMiddleton guides the dancers through the ups and downs that define these lessons, but still, the endgame for him is clear: building community. “It only takes one person who believes in them for them to continue to push for those that are coming up after them,” he says. “It’s really about creating a second family, a home, unity.”\n\nThe post How a Secret Society of Dancers Is Making Their Voices Heard appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\nSunny Choi Is Going to the Olympics!\n\nThis summer, breaking will make its Olympic debut at the 2024 Paris games, and b-girl Sunny Choi is ready to make history. In fact, she already did! This past October, Choi became the first American woman to qualify for the games after winning the gold medal at the Pan American Games.\n\nChoi spent her adolescence as a gymnast with Olympic aspirations, but knee injuries forced her to quit the sport at just 18 years old. Shortly thereafter, as a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania, she discovered some breakers dancing on campus who invited her to take class with them. She took them up on the offer and has been dancing ever since. “It started organically with going to practice where someone would teach me what I was observing,” she says. “Once I knew the first few basic steps, I would go and figure it out on my own after that. It was a lot of observing, experimenting, and pushing myself to get out of my comfort zone.”\n\nLeaving that comfort zone was a major challenge for Choi initially. “With gymnastics, I would repeat what I was taught to do over and over again until I got it perfect,” she says. “In breaking, you let mistakes happen, and you own them. I hated that I didn’t know how to be creative in those circumstances. I used to sit in the corner and watch and not participate.” Ultimately, though, Choi didn’t want to be defeated by her fears. She chose to overcome the obstacles that were holding her back and jump into dancing with both feet. Choi’s first exposure to breaking was in 2007, and just a couple of years later she attended her first local competition. By 2015 her talent and confidence had grown exponentially, and she was making a name for herself on the international breakdance competition circuit.\n\nSimultaneous to developing her dance talent, Choi began working corporate jobs and, most recently, was the director of global creative operations at Estée Lauder. “Dancing was a part-time hobby for me until 2023,” Choi says. “It wasn’t until this Olympic pathway presented itself that I felt like I could make a living off of it,” she says. In fact, it took Choi a long time to decide that she even wanted to pursue the Olympic games. “I knew I would have to quit my job and give up everything I had worked for to do it.” In 2021, shortly after breaking was approved for the 2024 Paris Olympics, all of the dancers surrounding Choi began talking about their aspirations to participate. “Everyone was dead set on doing it, but all I could think about were the sacrifices I’d have to make,” she says. “But over time I began to realize that it was actually just my fear of failure that was holding me back. I was standing in my own way.” So, instead of dwelling on the things that would make an Olympic run difficult, Choi became determined to succeed. “It was just like those early days of break dancing where I would stand paralyzed in the corner,” she says. “I couldn’t do that to myself again. I had to try.” In January 2024 she quit her job and started breaking full-time, and by November 2023 she was officially an Olympian.\n\nHere she talks about her journey to the Olympics, her goals for the games, and her advice for dancers with career aspirations like hers.\n\nHer Olympics training regimen “The first thing I did was find a strength and conditioning coach, as well as a therapist who focuses on sports psychology. I also worked out a schedule that allowed me to balance both training and the other obligations I have. My training time was split 50/50 between dance and the gym, followed by hours of recovery work and yoga. Beyond that, I was traveling to various competitions each week. It was a lot.”\n\nOn qualifying for the Olympics “There are a total of 16 men and 16 women who qualify. Five of those are winners of their respective continental games, one of them won the world championships this year, and 10 will have qualified through trials in May 2024.\n\nYou qualify based off of a world ranking, and that number comes from a point system from the Olympic circuit of events. None of those events were hosted in the U.S. One was in Canada, maybe two were held in South America, and the rest were in Europe and Asia. It was grueling for us to travel, but we had to try to get the points. I ultimately won my spot at the Pan American Games [the continental games for the Americas] but my world ranking also would have earned me a spot.”\n\nOn how it felt to become an Olympian “Weirdly, the initial feeling wasn’t excitement, it was just relief. I qualified. I did it. I’m halfway there. It still feels so far away, but I’m relieved I am guaranteed a spot, and now I just have to do what I do.”\n\nHer goals for the games “I want to have fun and be me. Sure, winning would be nice, but I would feel better about being both present and happy with the way that I danced or showcased myself to the world than coming home with a medal but not having enjoyed it.”\n\nHer advice for other breakers with Olympic dreams “Everyone has a different starting point, but at the end of the day it’s about looking at yourself and being honest. What do you want, and why do you want it? Be honest about what the sacrifices are, and if you are willing to make them. Then, just trust your gut and go for it. It’s scary, but that’s what makes it so much more rewarding.”\n\nThe post Sunny Choi Is Going to the Olympics! appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\nHow to Identify and Treat Plantar Fasciitis\n\nAmber Tacy, a personal trainer and the founder of Dancers Who Lift, an online strength training and nutrition program geared toward dancers, first experienced plantar fasciitis when she was in college. “I remember my feet screaming at 8 in the morning, and I was supposed to go through a 90-minute barre, and then modern and rehearsal right after that, and then another technique class,” she says. “I was distraught because I couldn’t imagine putting weight on my foot.”\n\nTacy’s experiences aren’t unusual, especially for dancers who are experiencing a dramatic ramp up in their activity level. Joshua Metzl, an orthopedic sports medicine physician at UCHealth Steadman Hawkins Clinic who works with dancers at Colorado Ballet, says that increasing the amount of time spent training—and the resulting potential for overuse—is the leading cause of plantar fasciitis among dancers.\n\nWhat Is Plantar Fasciitis?\n\nPlantar fasciitis is an inflammation of thick tissue on the bottom of the foot called plantar fascia. It often shows up in dancers as pain in the heel, especially when doing weight-bearing exercise. Metzl notes that it’s often most painful first thing in the morning, and symptoms can ebb and flow throughout the day.\n\nIn addition to a sudden increase in activity levels, plantar fasciitis can also be triggered by changes in footwear, like switching from pointe to flat shoes. The quality of the studio floor or performance surface can have an impact. Outside of the studio, walking more than normal and/or on different types of surfaces can lead to plantar fasciitis.\n\nAlthough plantar fasciitis is common amongst dancers, there are other conditions that could be causing similar pain. Metzl explains that the bones of the feet could also be to blame, with common bone-related plantar fasciitis doppelgangers instead being calcaneal stress fractures and calcaneal apophysitis, an inflammation of the growth plate in a younger dancer’s heel. An X-ray can help determine the root cause of this kind of foot pain.\n\nTreatment and Healing\n\nTreatment for plantar fasciitis usually involves working with a physical therapist to establish a daily stretching and strengthening program for the plantar fascia, Metzl says, adding that if the condition is more chronic and doesn’t respond to initial treatment, an MRI, corticosteroid injection, and/or a platelet-rich plasma injection, which acts as a localized anti-inflammatory, might be used as well.\n\nAt the onset of symptoms, Tacy recommends taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatories to ease pain, as well as employing gentle massage techniques. She says that icing—either by simply applying an ice pack to the bottom of the foot or by gently rolling out the sole with a frozen water bottle—can be helpful.\n\nIt’s also important to be strategic about daily footwear. Metzl says wearing orthotics or arch supports in your shoes can relieve symptoms by off-loading pressure from the plantar fascia. Tacy found that choosing shoes with a wide toe, which better mimics the natural shape of the foot, proved helpful. In more severe cases, a walking boot might also be recommended. Although plantar fasciitis does not always necessitate time off from dance, don’t underestimate the power of rest to ease and prevent pain. “There’s a really great saying: ‘If you don’t choose when to rest your body, your body will choose for you,’ ” Tacy says.\n\nIt’s All Connected\n\nWhen plantar fasciitis is severe, dancers might decide to modify their technique to mitigate pain. Although this might feel like a way to muscle through class or rehearsal, both Metzl and Tacy agree that this approach can cause more issues down the line. “The term we use in orthopedics is ‘kinetic chain’—all of these structures in the body are interconnected,” Metzl says. This means that untreated plantar fasciitis has the potential to lead to pain in other areas of the body, like the knees, calves, hips, and low back.\n\nWhen Tacy was dancing professionally in New York City, she suffered a serious injury that sidelined her for months. Although the injury involved an accident with a set piece and wasn’t directly related to plantar fasciitis, she believes that imbalances caused by her foot pain were a contributing factor to injury severity and recovery time. “As soon as I graduated college and got my first job, lo and behold, the foot that was most affected by plantar fasciitis was the one that I injured,” she says. “Looking back, I can see how it’s all connected. If I had taken care of my plantar fasciitis and strengthened and healed my foot in the correct way, I don’t think that my injury later would have been as severe or would have needed as much care.”\n\nTwo Stretches for Plantar Fasciitis\n\nJoshua Metzl, an orthopedic sports medicine physician who works with Colorado Ballet dancers, recommends these two stretches for dancers suffering from plantar fasciitis.\n\nCalf stretch with a towel roll\n\nRoll one edge of a towel.\n\nStand on the towel with one foot, with the rolled portion under your toes and metatarsal and the flat portion under your heel.\n\nAssume a small lunge position, with the back leg straight and on the towel, and the front leg slightly bent.\n\nFHL tendon glide\n\nThe flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon connects the calf to the big toe and plays a big role in pointing the toes and standing on pointe.\n\nPlace your feet flat on the floor.\n\nKeeping the heel and ball of your foot in contact with the floor, lift the toes.\n\nThe post How to Identify and Treat Plantar Fasciitis appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\n“SYTYCD” Week 3 Auditions: Who’s the Lebron James of Dance?\n\nLast night was the final round of solo auditions on “So You Think You Can Dance,” and it’s safe to say the competition was fierce. After all, who doesn’t want to be America’s Favorite Dancer? But before we head on to the next round of the competition, we have to recap the standout performances from all the dancers who made it through.\n\nAli Deucher\n\nTwenty-three-year-old Ali Deucher came to “SYT” auditions with some serious creds under her belt—including dancing last year with Katy Perry in Las Vegas. But after last night’s episode, she has another item to tack on to her resumé: a standing ovation from the three judges—Comfort Fedoke, Allison Holker, and Maksim Chmerkovskiy—and a place in the choreography round.\n\nJaylin Sanders\n\nWe have three words: isolations, isolations, isolations. That’s about all that comes to mind after watching Jaylin’s audition.\n\nThe judges seemed to agree, with Comfort even shouting out the skill during the middle of Jaylin’s performance. Allison gave Jaylin an “absolute yes,” and Maksim and Comfort joined her to give Jaylin three yeses, and a spot in the choreography round.\n\nMariyah Hawkins\n\nTwenty-one-year-old Mariyah first joined the “SYT” fam when she auditioned for “The Next Generation” back in 2016. But she’s back in 2024 older, wiser, and trying to be kinder to herself—something we absolutely love to see.\n\nThere was some disagreement between the judges when it came to Mariyah’s performance, though. Judge Maksim said that he wanted to see more of Mariyah’s personality when she performed, but Allison disagreed. Despite that, all three judges gave Mariyah a yes, and sent her on to the next round.\n\nAnthony Curley\n\nIt’s rare that the “SYT” judges don’t want to give critiques—that’s their job, after all. But 18-year-old Anthony Curley’s performance was the kind of rare that left judge Comfort unwilling to give any critique.\n\nShe was joined by Maksim, who called Anthony the “Lebron James of dance,” and Allison, who didn’t want Anthony’s performance to end. Needless to say, Anthony received three yeses from the judges.\n\nLihi Catriel\n\nLihi brought the funk—the jazz funk, that is. However, the judges had some concerns. Maksim seemed worried about Lihi’s range, though she assured him that she had training in all different styles of dance. And while Lihi did receive a yes from all three, Allison made it clear that her yes wasn’t coming easily, and that she wanted to see more from Lihi in the next round.\n\nJulian Carmolinga\n\nTwenty-seven-year-old Julian came to auditions with something heavy on his heart: He grew up in Chicago, surrounded by gang violence. His hope is that, with dance, he can help inspire the next generation to escape their own adversities.\n\nThat emotion came through in his performance. Allison told him that she could feel his pain when he danced. Julian received a yes from all three judges.\n\nJuicy Love Dion\n\nWe were beyond excited to see Juicy Love take to the “SYT” stage for a dazzling drag performance. She brought the energy, the personality, the acrobatics—and she did it in heels.\n\nJuicy got a standing ovation from the judges, with Allison calling her performance the “full package.” It was a yes from all three judges, and Juicy made it onto the next round. Shantay, you stay!\n\nVictor Ramos\n\nThirty-year-old Victor is coming into “SYT” just under the wire. After all, 30 is the upper age limit for contestants on the show. But for Victor, his audition wasn’t just a last chance, it was a new beginning.\n\nVictor’s performance earned the final standing ovation of auditions, and we could see why. But Maksim wanted to make sure that even at 30, Victor was still willing to learn and take in more. Victor said yes, and, in return, it was a yes from all three judges.\n\nWith that, auditions were over, and we had our full slate of dancers heading to the next round. Next week, these 35 talented performers will head to the choreography round, where we’ll see 35 turn into 10.\n\nThe post “SYTYCD” Week 3 Auditions: Who’s the Lebron James of Dance? appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n“SYTYCD” Week 4: Top 10 Revealed!\n\nWe’ve officially made it past the audition round on this season of “So You Think You Can Dance,” but that doesn’t mean that the hard part is over. The 35 dancers who made it through auditions now had to face the true test: the choreography round.\n\nAnd while, typically, this round could have gone on for a number of days to whittle the groups down, everything is different this year. Allison Holker revealed that this season the choreography round would last only one day, and would see 35 turn into 10!\n\nSo in case you missed last night’s episode, we’re here to recap all the best dancing, and the drama, plus which 10 talented dancers made it to the next round.\n\nFirst Cut: From 35 to 16\n\nFor the choreography round, the judges were joined by iconic L.A. choreographer Galen Hooks, who has previously worked with the likes of Justin Bieber, Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus, and Jennifer Lopez. For the first round of cuts, Galen led the dancers through an intense jazz routine.\n\nThe dancers began to perform in groups of five, and it was quickly clear that the judges weren’t playing. From the first five, only one dancer made it through: Easton Magliarditi—a standout from the first day of auditions.\n\nFrom the second group, Easton was joined by Ali Deucher and Mariyah Hawkins, along with Julian Carmolinga, and Roman Nevinchanyi. From the third group, Madison Rogue Alvarado andOlivia Alboher moved forward alongside Anthony Curley, who judge Maksim said already looked like a “front-runner.” In the fourth group, Dakayla Wilson, Avery Gay, and Braylon Browner made it through. The final group struggled a bit, and only Jaylin Sanders and Andrew Park went through and were warned by the judges not to disappoint in the duets.\n\nSecond Cut: From 16 to the Final 10\n\nAfter the first cut, it was time for some teamwork, and the judges had the chance to see the dancers perform in pairs. Galen tells Cat Deeley that this is an opportunity for the dancers to show “everything they can do” (our favorite kind of choreo).\n\nAfter the first two pairs performed for the judges, Maksim Chmerkovskiy spoke up, saying he was feeling frustrated that there wasn’t enough partner work, resulting in a lack of emotional connection between the dancers. But Allison disagreed, saying the dancers “smashed it.”\n\nThe second and third groups fared well, though the judges did voice some concerns that it seemed the choreography didn’t come quite as naturally to Jaylin, who had admitted in the first round that he was struggling with not having trained as extensively in jazz or contemporary. In the final group, it was Roman who seemed to have trouble, with Allison saying he wasn’t as “solid” as she had hoped for.\n\nOnce all 16 dancers had the chance to perform, it was time for deliberations. Cat called in the first eight dancers to hear their results, and it was a landslide—all eight were heading through to the top 10.\n\nBut in case your math isn’t mathing, that means only two of the dancers from the second group have a spot in the final 10. Ouch. In the end, only Jaylin and Avery make it through, and it’s an emotional, tear-filled moment.\n\nAnd with that, we have our top 10: Olivia, Madison, Braylon, Anthony, Avery, Mariyah, Easton, Roman, Jaylin, and Dakayla.\n\nBut on this season of “SYTYCD” there’s always another twist, and, in this case, there were actually two. First, it was announced that for the first time ever, all 10 dancers will not only be dancing together but also be living together as they go through the competition.\n\nThe final twist? The judges will be joined at the table by “Dance Moms” and “Dancing with the Stars” alum Jojo Siwa. So strap in, folks, we’re pretty sure this season is going to be a crazy one.\n\nThe post “SYTYCD” Week 4: Top 10 Revealed! appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\nDisney+’s Madu Follows Young Ballet Dancer’s Journey From Nigeria to England\n\nYou might remember Anthony Madu from a video that went viral in June 2020. Shared to millions on Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) by celebrities like Viola Davis and Cynthia Erivo, the video captured an 11-year-old Madu dancing barefoot and in the rain on a backstreet of Nigeria—and even then, the elements couldn’t dampen his lofty ballon.\n\nSoon, millions more will get a glimpse of not just Madu’s talent but his story, which, at present, is unfolding at one of England’s most prestigious training grounds for dance: Elmhurst Ballet School.\n\nComing to Disney+ on March 29, Madu follows the young dancer’s journey from Lagos to Birmingham, and the highs and lows of settling into the rigorous dance classes, academics, and social life at Elmhurst. We caught up with the star of the film about moving away from his family, his career aspirations, and what he hopes other dancers take away from the documentary.\n\nLet’s go back to when it all started: that viral video. What inspired you to film it?\n\nI actually wasn’t the one who filmed it; my old dance teacher [Daniel Ajala] did. I wasn’t meant to be in class that day. I just took class because I was bored. My teacher decided to film it, and he posted it on Instagram and boom!\n\nAnd that moment has catapulted you to a different country. What has the experience of moving and living abroad been like?\n\nWhen I first moved to England, it felt amazing, but also, at the same time, it was a bit hard because of the change of weather, missing home, and the food, and that sort of thing. But I think I’ve actually gotten used to things here.\n\nCan you talk a little bit about your early ballet training?\n\nWhen I started taking ballet at [Leap of Dance Academy], I used to take class on Saturdays, just in the mornings. But as time went on, I started taking class a bit more during the week and after school. And on weekends, I would train from 8 am to around 5 pm. It was kind of hard because it’s really sunny in Nigeria, but I think it was very worth it.\n\nAcross your training in Nigeria and now in England, have you encountered negative attitudes around being a male-identifying dancer?\n\nI don’t deal with that currently because we’ve got more male ballet dancers here than back in Nigeria, which has been really good for me. When I was in Nigeria, I kind of felt bullied for doing ballet. It wasn’t really seen as something that a guy should be doing.\n\nFor those dancers who are dealing with that same type of harm and others who are simply dreaming of pursuing careers in dance, what do you hope they take away from watching this film?\n\nThat they should never give up. They have to forget about the negativity, think more about how far they want to go, and always remember that it doesn’t really matter what people say; it just matters what you do and how you do it.\n\nAre there any dancers who have been a source of inspiration on your ballet journey?\n\nWhen I was training in Nigeria, I looked up to [American Ballet Theatre’s] Calvin Royal III. It was nice having someone you could look up to and look at them and be like, “I want to be like that someday.” But today—and I’m not saying this because he’s my current ballet teacher—I’d say [Joshua Barwick]. He is diligent, kind, and he wants to know [his students]. He talks to us.\n\nWhat is next for you?\n\nThis is a hard one. The film has brought up quite a lot of thought for me. I could stay with classical ballet completely, but I’m also interested in contemporary dance. When I came to Elmhurst, where we take contemporary lessons every week, it felt like finding a new thing that you love. And I think that’s one of the best parts of life, is to realize things that you never really thought would have happened. I like contemporary because you get to do more movement than you do with ballet. You get to try loads of weird stuff. I’m also interested in moving into acting.\n\nIt seems you’ve been bitten by the cinematic bug. How was your experience filming?\n\nThe camera crew and the creative team were amazing. At first, [filming] felt a bit weird, but then I got used to it. I recently watched the film with the whole school, and I actually thought it was quite good. I cried a bit at one scene—it was when I was leaving my family in Nigeria to come to the UK. It felt like the feeling of leaving my family came back. During the end credits, there were five minutes of applause. I wasn’t expecting that many people to enjoy it as much as they did, which made me cry again. It was really exciting.\n\nThe post Disney+’s Madu Follows Young Ballet Dancer’s Journey From Nigeria to England appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\nNew York City Ballet Dancer Christina Clark Is Celebrating Every Stage\n\nWhen Christina Clark saw her first Nutcracker performance at age 5, she didn’t immediately aspire to the roles of Sugarplum Fairy or Dewdrop—instead, she was fixated on the dozens of children in the cast. “I was determined to become one of those kids onstage,” she remembers. “Performing was the only goal.” Clark, a New York City native, was accepted into the School of American Ballet at age 7, became an apprentice with New York City Ballet in 2016, and was promoted to the corps de ballet in 2017.\n\nWith her elongated limbs and polished port de bras, Clark is a remarkably self-possessed dancer who uses her 5′ 10 1/2″ frame to fully inhabit every choreographic moment and musical note. She debuted in a slew of roles in 2023, including the Tall Girl in George Balanchine’s “Rubies” and the lead woman in Haieff Divertimento, which hadn’t been performed by NYCB since 1994. As more opportunities continue to come her way, Clark is determined to squeeze as much as possible out of each experience: “My overarching goal is always to continue growing—in my technique, my artistry, and my approach to new roles.”\n\nEmbracing the Unfamiliar\n\n“I love exploring different movement styles, even if they’re not my forte. When I was rehearsing Justin Peck’s sneaker ballet The Times Are Racing, I had to tackle questions like ‘How does my weight need to be distributed differently in a sneaker versus a pointe shoe?’ or ‘How can I syncopate the steps and accent certain moments that reveal different aspects of the music?’ ”\n\nUsing Imagination as a Tool\n\n“As an English major at Columbia University, I love storytelling. When preparing for a role, I imagine a character or story to inform my movement. Even for something plotless like Haieff Divertimento or ‘Rubies,’ there’s a certain flavor to each part. It’s helpful to think about steps in terms of analogies and images, ranging from moving my hands through water to embodying a strand of seaweed in the ocean.”\n\nA Recurring Pinch-Me Moment\n\n“Dancing Balanchine’s Serenade always feels like a career-reaffirming experience. I’ve performed it for many seasons, and every time, it hits me that I’m living in the tableau I dreamed of for so long. It’s such a community-based ballet, and one of my favorite things about this career is connecting with the dancers around me—they’re my best friends and greatest sources of inspiration. To dance as part of a group, especially in a ballet containing so much meaning and joy, will always be a highlight.”\n\nThe post New York City Ballet Dancer Christina Clark Is Celebrating Every Stage appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\nA Dancer’s Guide to Houston\n\nThe Houston dance community is as big and sprawling as the city itself.\n\nHouston, the fourth-largest city in the U.S., is recognized as more ethnically diverse than most cities of similar size. Its dance scene reflects that size and diversity, with a range of companies, schools, and choreographers.\n\nMost Houstonians divide the city into “inside the Loop” and “outside the Loop,” the Loop being Loop 610, the innermost circle of the freeway system.

So in case you didn’t catch last night’s episode, we’re here to fill you in on what you missed—the dancing, the drama, the Deeley of it all. And trust us, this episode was worth the wait.\n\nIf your past two weeks were as busy as ours, it’s easy to forget what happened at the end of the last episode. To recap: The judges picked our top 10 (!!), and they’re not just going to be dancing together this year, they’ll be living together, too, for the first time ever.\n\nWe also found out that JoJo Siwa will be joining the judges table. And the final twist? This year, the “SYT” dancers will be competing outside of a studio setting, taking on practical dance challenges every week. “This season we’re taking the challenges off the shiny floor and into the real world,” said longtime host Cat Deeley. NGL, we got chills.\n\nThe first challenge the dancers faced? Music videos. The top 10 were randomly split into two groups and put to the test with industry icons Luther Brown and Phillip and Makenzie Chbeeb. The first (contemporary) group was assigned to work with Phillip and Makenzie to re-create the video for Justin Bieber’s “All Around Me,” and the duo were joined by Avery Gay, Dakayla Wilson, Braylon Browner, Roman Nevinchanyi, and Jaylin Sanders (much to the disappointment of Jaylin, the sole hip-hopper in the top 10). The second (hip-hop) group was asked to replicate the video for Lizzo’s “Juice” with Luther, and consisted of Olivia Alboher, Mariyah Hawkins, Madison Rouge Alvarado, Easton Magliarditi, and Anthony Curley.\n\nThe dancers went from rehearsals into the actual video shoot, where the judges joined them to begin their judging. They reminded the dancers that they’ll be evaluated not just on dancing but also on other metrics, like professionalism, group dynamics, and star quality. We weren’t sure exactly how you evaluate star quality, but we were excited to find out.\n\nFirst up was the contemporary group’s performance. After watching the video in full, the judges gave their critiques. It seemed they couldn’t agree on who the star of the video was—for JoJo it was Dakayla; for Maksim Chmerkovskiy it was Jaylin. There’s that star quality we were looking for, folks!\n\nThe hip-hop group was up next, with a fun, upbeat performance. The judges loved the video but were concerned with Madison and Easton’s performances. They’re both strong hip-hop dancers, but they seemed to struggle a bit in the video. For Madison, the struggle was finding her groove with speed; for Easton, the struggle was standing out.\n\nNext up, it was time for the results. The judges selected six dancers who were safe and heading to the next round, which left four dancers at risk of elimination: Easton, Avery, Braylon, and Olivia. Each dancer on the chopping block had the chance to perform a solo routine to prove their mettle, and TBH, these performances gave us all the vintage “SYT” feels.\n\nThe judges seemed particularly impressed with Easton and Braylon’s performances, and, in the end, their dancing was enough to see them through to the next round. Sadly, that meant both Avery and Olivia were sent home. “This is not the end. This is just the beginning for you,” Allison told both of the talented dancers.\n\nAnd with that, we have our top 8. Who do you think will make it to the end as America’s Favorite Dancer?\n\nThe post “SYTYCD” Week 5 Recap: The Dancers Take On Lizzo and Bieber appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\nMeet Houston Ballet Soloist Eric Best\n\nWatching Eric Best navigate the sensuous curves of Stanton Welch’s Tapestry, during Houston Ballet’s Jubilee of Dance [in December 2023], the dancer’s flow and exactitude merged into a seamless whole. His generous port de bras caressed the space, drawing out Welch’s nuanced choreographic lines. With his crisp technique, subtle swagger, and beguiling fluidity, Best catapulted from the corps de ballet to soloist at the opening of the season, and audiences cannot get enough of him.\n\nCompany: Houston Ballet\n\nAge: 21\n\nHometown: Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nTraining: Dance Creations Academy, Houston Ballet Academy, Houston Ballet II\n\nDestination Houston: Best bonded with Houston Ballet during his first summer intensive there in 2018. “I improved so much and made so many friends. I felt this is a place where I can grow and learn,” he says. During his next summer, in Los Angeles at a Debbie Allen Dance Academy intensive, he met guest teacher Lauren Anderson, who is Houston Ballet Academy’s associate director of education and community engagement. “She said, ‘Oh, you need to get back to Houston, like, right away.’ So I did.”\n\nQuick rise: After joining Houston Ballet II in 2021, Best apprenticed with the main company in 2022, and sailed into the corps in 2023. After a flurry of lead roles, he was promoted to soloist at the beginning of the season, a time he describes as “taking that leap of faith and going along for the ride. I’ve surprised myself with what I was actually capable of doing and because of Stanton [Welch] and Julie [Kent]’s support and faith in me.”\n\nMidsummer doubleheader: Houston audiences got to know just how much Best was capable of when he landed major roles—Lysander and Puck—in both casts of John Neumeier’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream at the start of this season.\n\nWhat the co-artistic directors are saying: “Eric has such physical intelligence, his mind–body connection is extraordinary,” says Julie Kent. “There’s a divine quality to his dancing. Also, he looks great at every angle.” Stanton Welch shares that “Eric is a phenomenal talent. He is so musical, and brings such detail to my ballets. I get to choreograph without limit, and he makes me want to be a better choreographer.”\n\nSpeaking the same language: Best’s affinity for Welch’s intricate choreography comes through in the growing list of Welch’s ballets he’s performed thus far. “Now I can go into his new works knowing what he’s going to bring and what he’s looking for,” says Best. “I just try to come in with the same energy, ready to work.” Clear, originally created after 9/11, made a profound impact on Best. “Every time I watch this ballet or I perform it or rehearse it, I always find something new that ties to the narrative of it.”\n\nBeyond dancing: Best loves drawing and sketching. “Mostly self-portraits, people, sometimes superheroes. I’m very passionate about art and would like to take more classes,” he says. “I always want to make sure that I keep doing the things that interest me besides dance.”\n\nThe post Meet Houston Ballet Soloist Eric Best appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\nDancing From Australia to L.A.: Meet 19-Year-Old Seth Collier\n\nSeth Collier burst onto the international dance film scene in 2022 when he won the Inspired Dance Film Festival at just 17 years old. His runner-up? None other than Emmy Award–winning choreographer Derek Hough. Now, Collier is ready to take the professional performance industry by storm—starting with a move from Australia to L.A. this July.\n\nCollier chatted with Dance Spirit about his journey to dance, how he turned a school project into IDFF’s Best of the Fest–winning work, his goals for the future, and more.\n\nDance Spirit: Tell us a bit about your dance training.\n\nSC: I grew up on a farm, and my parents knew nothing about dance. They put me in rugby for six years, but when I saw my sister take a dance class at a nearby school called Just Dance, I immediately said I wanted to join too. At 12, I started dancing at a private school called West Moreton Anglican College. It had a good dance program and we competed against other schools. When I was in 10th grade, I traveled one day per week to train at Dynamite Studios [one of Australia’s premier dance studios] on the Gold Coast. After that first year, I joined the school full-time. It’s similar to a college dance program in the U.S. where you dance all day every day and finish with a qualification. While there I focused on commercial and musical theater dance, and I finished my full-time training with them in 2022.\n\nDS: What is the Inspired Dance Film Festival?\n\nSC: It’s an [Australia-based] competition of dance work on film, run by Adam Garcia—a former judge on Australia’s version of “Dancing with the Stars.” People from all over the world submit their dance films, and a handful of films are selected for the showcase in Brisbane. At the showcase the winner is announced.\n\nDS: Tell us a bit about your journey to winning the IDFF.\n\nSC: When I was 16, I choreographed, filmed, edited, and danced in River, as part of a school dance assignment. I didn’t have a crew or any real help filming it. I was happy with it, but I never expected anything to come of it. In 2022 my dance teacher, Kate Wormald, was an ambassador to the Inspired Dance Film Festival and posted about the competition. I submitted River, having no idea that I’d be competing with professionals like Derek Hough. I had no expectations that I would win. Surprisingly, I was chosen for the showcase and won Best of the Fest. I was completely shocked.\n\nDS: What other choreographic work have you done?\n\nI’ve choreographed and danced in films for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, including a kids’ film I did when I was 17 called Viv’s Silly Mango. I auditioned for the role of Brad in the film, and when they gave me the part they asked if I would be able to also choreograph and dance in the show. Other than that, I’ve done lots of live performances, as well as a music video for Alexa Curtis when I was 18 years old.\n\nDS: What was the turning point in your training when you realized you could make dance your career?\n\nSC: I’ve always danced without a career mindset—it was just something I loved doing. But during my year of full-time training at Dynamite, I got picked for some solo moments and lead roles in the dances, and any doubt in my mind of my ability to pursue it as a career left. The solidifying moment was when I signed with my agency, McDonald/Selznick [MSA] Associates, in October of 2023.\n\nDS: What challenges have you faced as a dancer?\n\nSC: I have had moments where I have felt like I wasn’t good enough, but the primary challenges to my dance training came from living on a farm out in the bush. It took me an hour and a half to get to my dance classes at Dynamite every day. My parents didn’t have a clue about the performing arts industry, so I had to navigate it all by myself, and that was really hard.\n\nDS: What are your dreams for the future?\n\nSC: I’ve got lots of plans and dreams. My current career plan is to move to Los Angeles this July and start working with MSA. I have landed a job at Gravity Space LA in Hollywood, and will work there as a Dynamite representative teacher and choreographer. Long term, I would love to work in the commercial world and be a backup dancer for an artist.\n\nThe post Dancing From Australia to L.A.: Meet 19-Year-Old Seth Collier appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\n“SYTYCD” Week 6 Recap: Broadway and a Budding Showmance\n\nWe’ve been totally WOWED by this new season of “So You Think You Can Dance.” After all, we’ve seen new judges, new dancers, and a whole new structure for the show, complete with new challenges every single week. And did we mention the contestants’ new on-camera living arrangements?\n\nThis week, we saw the top 8 take on a Broadway-themed challenge, with the help of some of our fave musical theater choreographers. As a bonus, we even got some hints of a showmance in the making.\n\nIn case you missed last night’s episode, we’ve rounded up all of the best dancing—and drama—for you here. Break a leg!\n\nOur top 8 dancers spent the week working with iconic Broadway choreographers Al Blackstone and Sarah O’Gleby on their musical theater performances. Unlike last week, they didn’t get any chances for reshoots or redos. We’re doing it live, folks!\n\nThe dancers were split into two groups to get started. The first group, working with Al, was made up of Anthony Curley, Dakayla Wilson, Jaylin Sanders, and Madison Rouge Alvarado. The second, working with Sarah, featured Braylon Browner, Easton Magliarditi, Mariyah Hawkins, and Roman Nevinchanyi—the last of whom admitted he had never seen a Broadway show before.\n\nBut Roman (and the other dancers) had to catch on quickly, because the choreographers weren’t holding anything back. Sarah started her group on a Cabaret-inspired number, while Al took his group through a routine reminiscent of On the Town. Both choreographers emphasized that while the dancers were performing in group routines, it was important for them to be individual and stand out.\n\nAfter learning a chunk of choreo, the dancers took a quick break—and fanned some showmance flames. Back at the house, Dakayla admitted to the other girls that she had a “baby” crush on one of her group members: Anthony. Cue the squeals.\n\nThe next day, the dancers transitioned from the studio to the stage, and a few of them struggled. Roman cited mental and physical challenges with the Broadway routine, but he drew inspiration from his fellow Ukrainians to push through. “People in Ukraine motivate me so much. They don’t give up,” said Roman. “I want to make my country proud.”\n\nWith rehearsals wrapping up, it was time for the dancers to perform. Al’s team stepped up first. The judges seemed to enjoy it but voiced concerns that the dancers weren’t emotionally connected enough—and that, at times, they got a little too goofy.\n\nNext up was Sarah’s group. Aside from concerns about a timing issue that led to a literal run-in between Braylon and Mariyah, the judges loved the performance, giving it a standing ovation. Easton even got a shout-out from judge JoJo Siwa for dancing so hard he caused a wardrobe malfunction. “I have a little saying,” said JoJo. “You are not going full-out enough until you split your pants.”\n\nAfter that, it was time for results. The judges picked the four dancers who were voted safe, leaving the other four in jeopardy. At risk for elimination? Anthony, Dakayla, Roman, and Braylon. Like last week, each dancer had the chance to perform a solo in the hopes of proving that they deserved to stay in the competition.\n\nThe judges seemed impressed by several of the solos, though Anthony’s was the only one to receive a standing ovation. And in the end, he and (potential showmance partner) Dakayla made it through to the next round. Unfortunately, that meant Braylon and Roman were headed home.\n\nWith that, our top 8 became our top 6—and we made it one week closer to finding out who will be America’s Favorite Dancer.\n\nThe post “SYTYCD” Week 6 Recap: Broadway and a Budding Showmance appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n2024 YAGP Winners Announced, Capping 25th Anniversary Celebration\n\nNew York City’s midtown streets were abuzz with bunheads last week—it seemed everywhere you looked, you’d see large groups of young dancers, hair slicked and garment bags in tow, rushing to a studio or to Lincoln Center’s Koch Theater for Youth America Grand Prix. It was a nostalgic moment; for much of its 25-year history, YAGP, the world’s largest student ballet scholarship competition, held its Final Round in New York City. It relocated its finals to Tampa during the pandemic—it’s logistically easier and more affordable for dancers and their families, said Larissa Saveliev, YAGP’s founder and artistic director. But with this being the competition’s 25th-anniversary season, coming back to New York City was top priority.\n\n“For us it’s really meaningful,” Saveliev said earlier this month during a phone interview. “It’s where we started.” (Finals will alternate between New York City and Tampa going forward, announced annually.)\n\nTo further celebrate the anniversary, this year’s festivities included a symposium for more than 20 company directors, co-hosted by Dutch National Ballet artistic director Ted Brandsen and American Ballet Theatre’s incoming executive director Barry Hughson. And on April 17, 353 YAGP competitors came together at New York’s Plaza Hotel to break the Guinness World Record for the most dancers to balance simultaneously on pointe for one minute.\n\nThe week also included two star-studded galas, including a Best of 25 Years gala featuring 36 artists from 15 companies around the world. Each piece included YAGP alumni, such as ABT’s Chloe Misseldine, Paris Opéra Ballet’s Bianca Scudamore, Dutch National Ballet’s Constantine Allen, Stuttgart Ballet’s Mackenzie Brown, Bavarian State Ballet’s António Casalinho, and many more. “There are so many dancers we wanted to feature that we couldn’t do it in one night,” said Saveliev. “Most of them are young principals and soloists, because we wanted to feature the next generation of superstars.”\n\nOriginally, the cast also included Maria Khoreva and Kimin Kim of Russia’s state-run Mariinsky Ballet, which drew objections from local leaders and the Ukrainian consulate due to the war in Ukraine. After being informed about possible protests on Thursday, YAGP leaders consulted with New York City Ballet, which manages Lincoln Center’s Koch Theater, and decided to cancel the dancers’ performances shortly before the show. (Protests by pro-Ukrainian activists went on as planned.) “It is a decision that gives us great pain,” YAGP said in a statement. “Art should unite us, not divide us.”\n\n“We are very sorry that our reunion did not take place,” Khoreva wrote in an Instagram post, “but art will always find a way to human soul.”\n\nThe Awards\n\nOver the course of the competition, 120 finalists—out of 2,000 dancers—were selected to participate in Wednesday night’s Final Round. The winners were announced at Saturday’s awards ceremony, along with many other dancers who received summer intensive scholarships, invitations to pre-professional training programs, and company contracts.\n\nGoing forward, Saveliev said, YAGP plans to create more opportunities for dancers outside of competition, as well as expand its Nervi Festival Summer Workshop (a one-week “company experience” program held each summer in Italy) to more cities in Europe. “We want to give young dancers opportunities to perform, not just compete,” she says.\n\nIf you missed the livestreamed awards ceremony, you’re in luck—we’ve compiled a list below. Congratulations to all of those who participated in this year’s Final Round, and a special shout-out to all of the hard-working teachers and parents who made these dancers’ dreams possible.\n\nSenior Division\n\nGrand Prix\n\nGeonHee Park, 18, Korea National University of the Arts, South Korea\n\nSenior Women\n\n1st place: Ivana Radan, 15, Ellison Ballet Professional Training Program, USA\n\n2nd place: Crystal Huang, 15, Bayer Ballet Academy & The Rock Center for Dance, USA\n\n3rd place: MinJi Son, 18, Korea National University of the Arts, South Korea\n\nSenior Men\n\n1st place: Martinho Lima Santos, 18, Princess Grace Academy, Monaco/Portugal\n\n2nd place: Joao Pedro Silva, 15, Balé do teatro Basileu Franca, Brazil\n\n3rd place (tie): Hang Li, 20, Beijing Dance Academy, China\n\n3rd place (tie): Carson Willey, 17, The Rock School for Dance, USA\n\nJunior Division\n\nJunior Women\n\n1st place: Tamison Soppet, 13, Convergence Dance Studios, New Zealand\n\n2nd place: Annie Webb, 13, Moga Conservatory of Dance, USA\n\n3rd place: Jolie Lavaux, 13, Boca Ballet Theatre, USA\n\nJunior Men\n\n1st place: Keenan Mentzos, 14, Ballet Bloch Canada, Canada\n\n2nd place: Eric Poor, 14, Cary Ballet Conservatory, USA\n\n3rd place: Eita Akita, 14, Wakui Ballet School, Japan\n\nPre-Competitive Division\n\nHope Award\n\nOwen Simmons, 11, The School of Cadence Ballet, Canada\n\nWomen, Classical\n\n1st place: Yuna Yamada, 11, Kinue Kobayashi Ballet Studio, Japan\n\n2nd place: SaRang Jang, 11, Maeen Ballet, South Korea\n\n3rd place: Anne Takahashi, 11, Flora Ballet, Japan\n\nMen, Classical\n\n1st place: Spencer Collins, 10, Westside School of Ballet, USA\n\n2nd place: Victor Rega Mas, 11, Synopsis Danse, France\n\n3rd place: Yuto Teranishi, 10, Panda Ballet School (Takako Mori Ballet School), Japan\n\nWomen, Contemporary\n\n1st place: Lior Wieder, 11, DanceWorks, Israel\n\n2nd place: Ellary Day Szyndlar, 11, Master Ballet Academy, USA\n\n3rd place: Anne Takahashi, 11, Flora Ballet, Japan\n\nMen, Contemporary\n\n1st place: Spencer Collins, 10, Westside School of Ballet, USA\n\n2nd place: Kohaku Kihara, 11, Skhole Ballet Art, Japan\n\n3rd place: Bogdan Eduard, 10, Dance Planet, Romania\n\nEnsemble Division\n\nClassical Pas de Deux\n\n1st place: Minji Son, 18, and Seungmin Lee, 19, Korea National University of the Arts, South Korea\n\n2nd place (tie): Núria Fernandes, 16, and Darius-Oriol Tamosi, 17, Conservatório Internacional de Ballet e Dança Annarella Sanchez, Portugal\n\n2nd place (tie): Yasmin Sabag, 15, and Joao Pedro Silva, 15, Bale do teatro Basileu Franca, Brazil\n\n3rd place: Sophia Jones, 17, and Colton Heath, 16, Feijóo Ballet School, USA\n\nContemporary Pas de Deux\n\n1st place: Núria Fernandes, 16, and Darius-Oriol Tamosi, 17, Conservatório Internacional de Ballet e Dança Annarella Sanchez, Portugal\n\n2nd place: Sachi Oza, 13, and Eric Poor, 14, Cary Ballet Conservatory, USA\n\n3rd place: Yasmin Sabag, 15, and Marcus Rufino, 15, Bale do teatro Basileu Franca, Brazil\n\nClassical Ensembles\n\n1st place: Bayer Ballet Academy, USA\n\n2nd place: The Rock School for Dance, USA\n\n3rd place: Colorado Ballet Academy, USA\n\nContemporary Ensembles\n\n1st place: Professione Danza Pescara, Italy\n\n2nd place: Cary Ballet Conservatory, USA\n\n3rd place (tie): Jun Lu Performing Arts, USA\n\n3rd place (tie): The School of Cadence Ballet, Canada\n\nCharacter Ensembles\n\n1st place: OAEC, USA\n\n2nd place: Ellison Ballet Professional Training Program, USA\n\n3rd place: Jun Lu Performing Arts, USA\n\nDuet/Trio\n\n1st place: DanceWorks, Israel\n\n2nd place: Amirian Ballet Academy, USA\n\n3rd place: The Rock School West, USA\n\nSpecial Awards\n\nMakarova Award for Artistry: Viktoria Papakalodouka\n\nShelly King Award for Excellence: Chloe Helimets\n\nOutstanding Choreographer Award: Krista King-Doherty; Andrea Astuto\n\nOutstanding School: Korean National University of the Arts, South Korea\n\nThe post 2024 YAGP Winners Announced, Capping 25th Anniversary Celebration appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\n“SYTYCD” Week 7 Recap: Film, “Footloose,” and Frankenstein on the Silver Screen\n\nIt’s lights, camera, action on Week 7 of this season of “So You Think You Can Dance.” Last week, two more dancers were sent home, narrowing our top 8 down to a top 6, and it’s safe to say the competition is really heating up.\n\nThis week, we saw the top 6 dancers take on an all-new challenge: movies. And to make it onto the silver screen, they were joined by two of our all-time fave choreographers. So in case you didn’t catch last night’s episode, here’s everything you missed. And…action!\n\nFor their movie-night challenge, the dancers worked with two legendary film choreographers: Chris Scott and Jamal Sims—and were split into two groups to get started. The first group, working with Chris Scott, had Easton Magliarditi, Madison Rouge Alvarado, and Jaylin Sanders. The second group, working with Jamal Sims, had Mariyah Hawkins, Anthony Curley, and Dakayla Wilson. That’s right, the members of our resident showmance, Anthony and Dakayla, had the chance to work together again.\n\nThe top 6 got right to work on their mini-movies. Chris’s team started on an In the Heights number, set to the song “When the Sun Goes Down.” And ICYMI, Chris was the choreographer for the In the Heights film, so, naturally, the pressure was really on for this team.\n\nThe second group, working with Jamal, started on their Footloose-inspired routine. The twist? Their movie would be Footloose meets Frankenstein, with Anthony performing as Mariyah and Dakayla’s monster/man.\n\nSoon after, the dancers traded the dance studio for the film studio. They were joined by the judges, who caught all the extra-exclusive, behind-the-scenes content, including which dancers were slaying and which were struggling. Jaylin, in particular, seemed to be having a tougher time. “He just doesn’t have a knowledge of his own body yet,” said Allison Holker.\n\nOnce it was quiet on set, it was time to hear from the judges. First, they watched Chris’s team on the big screen. And while Jaylin did his best to stand his ground, it seemed he fell behind in comparison to the other two dancers. Madison, on the other hand, was a standout, with the judges giving her acting and character performance high praise.\n\nNext up was the film from Jamal’s team. The judges were especially impressed by Anthony, who was decidedly the star of the show. But after watching their performance, Mariyah was disappointed in her own performance. “I was really proud of the work that I think I put in, and I suppose that I think I’m a bit deflated with the result because it felt so much different than it looks,” she said.\n\nFinally, it was time for the results. The judges picked the three dancers who were voted safe, leaving the other three at risk of being sent home. After much deliberation, Jaylin, Mariyah, and Dakayla were all left at risk of elimination. But luckily, this week, only one dancer would be sent home of the three.\n\nWhile Jaylin and Mariyah’s sudden-death solos were a bit more subtle, Dakayla did it big, and the judges were impressed. In the end, both she and Mariyah were chosen to dance another week, and Jaylin was sent home. “There’s a lot more up my sleeve that people don’t know I do. This is just the beginning,” he said.\n\nThat was a wrap on Week 7. With only five dancers remaining, who do you think will win the title of America’s Favorite Dancer?\n\nThe post “SYTYCD” Week 7 Recap: Film, “Footloose,” and Frankenstein on the Silver Screen appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\nStarbound National Talent Competition Combines 31 Years of Experience With Expansion\n\nAs Starbound National Talent Competition celebrates its 31st season, the team knows what keeps dance families coming back. “We’ve always been one of the leaders in this industry, and through listening to our clients’ feedback and making changes, we continue to set the standard higher,” says Sandra Coyte, founder and director.\n\nWith a calendar of more than 70 Regional competitions and five Nationals, Starbound’s events combine the glamour and innovation of a large-scale production and theater experience with the fairness and personal attention you’d expect from a family-run company. Starbound offers the industry expertise of a woman-owned business founded by a former dance teacher and studio owner.\n\n2025 is set to be a banner year for Starbound, with new and exciting opportunities for dancers and teachers alike. First, they’ll be adding even more cities to their extensive roster (including stops in Omaha, Nebraska, and Jacksonville, Florida). Dancers can look forward to the addition of an improvisation competition at every Regional event, while parents and teachers will appreciate the new assigned-by-studio dressing rooms. Starbound is also rebranding to keep up with the times while keeping the integrity of a name dancers can trust.\n\nStarbound’s scoring system is also getting a refresh. A dancer’s score will be broken down into four categories: technique, choreography, aesthetics, and performance. On the Tuesday following competition weekend, teachers can log in to Starbound’s virtual Teacher Center and see score breakdowns for every routine, as well as video critiques. Finally, to address the current hot topic of competition leveling, Starbound will also be adding specific, skill-based guidelines that ensure fairness and help take the guesswork out of registering routines.\n\nEven with all these exciting features, Coyte remains most proud of what has remained the same at Starbound over the past three decades. “We’ve always strived to keep our pricing simple and affordable,” she shares. “Our entry fees are the same no matter when you register, and we were the first competition to introduce rebates to the dance industry for registering early.” Starbound knows that affordability matters to its families, and Coyte notes that, although prices did not increase this year, the competition produces the same high-quality events that studios have come to expect. Additionally, free photos and videos are a long-standing hallmark of Starbound, and events are also livestreamed.\n\nThe competition also prides itself on the expertise of its staff. “All three judges on every panel are versatile experts in multiple styles of dance, and we always have at least one judge who is knowledgeable in tap,” Coyte says.\n\nStarbound is also committed to raising money for the Dancers Care Foundation. Since 2002, the company has donated more than $2.6 million towards cancer treatment and prevention in the dance community.\n\nLooking ahead, the 2025 season is shaping up to be Starbound’s best yet.

But what would tours be without dancers?\n\nThis week, the “So You Think You Can Dance” dancers were asked to take their show on the road and take on the challenge of dancing on tour. “International tours are a billion-dollar industry,” said longtime host Cat Deeley. “And while it’s the headliner that makes the headlines, any superstar will tell you that it’s their dancers who keep the energy going in their performances.”\n\nSo how did our top 5 fare in their tour de force performance? Let’s find out.\n\nWe’ve made it to the top 5, everyone! And these crazy-talented dancers are all one week closer to becoming America’s Favorite Dancer. They’ve taken on music videos, musical theater, movies—and in last night’s episode, they took on tours.\n\nThe dancers were joined by two iconic choreographers: Fullout Cortland and Kyle Hanagami. Between them, these choreographers have worked with everyone from SZA to Justin Bieber—which is to say, they’ve worked with everyone. And the dancers also had a shot to work with another incredible artist, T-Pain!\n\nEach dancer was asked to perform both routines. That means two sets of choreography, two sets of rehearsals, and two performances, all in one week. This is the big leagues, folks!\n\nThe dancers jumped straight into rehearsals for Fullout’s hip-hop performance and Kyle’s contemporary routine. Fullout picked Mariyah Hawkins for an extra-special front-and-center moment with T-Pain, and the pressure was officially on.\n\nIn Kyle’s rehearsal, the pressure was just as intense, and it seemed to get to Madison Rouge Alvarado a little bit, who hurt her hip during a run-through. But she said, “Even if it was hurting, I would not allow it to affect my dancing.” We love the drive, but please, dancers, take care of yourselves. Dancing through the pain is not a flex, we promise.\n\nFinally, it was time for the performances. And lo and behold, T-Pain finally arrived at the “SYTYCD” studios! The dancers performed Fullout’s routine alongside T-Pain and absolutely brought the house down. There was a quick minute for a quick change, and then it was time for Kyle’s routine.\n\nThe judges were impressed by both performances and they had feedback for all of the dancers. Madison got a shout-out for dancing on her injured hip (which we have mixed feelings about), and judge Maksim Chmerkovskiy told Dakayla Wilson that she was the absolute standout of the performance. In the end, both Madison and Dakayla were revealed as safe, leaving Easton Magliarditi, Mariyah, and Anthony Curley to dance for their lives and another week in the competition.\n\nEaston’s solo was amazing, as always, and Anthony delivered on a routine that showed the judges his range. But Mariyah struggled again with dancing outside of her comfort zone, and, in the end, the judges chose to send her home. “This has been such a beautiful experience, and I did exactly what I came to do,” she said.\n\nAfter another elimination, only four dancers remain in the competition. Who do you think will be the last one standing onstage?\n\nThe post “SYTYCD” Week 8 Recap: A Tour de Force With T-Pain appeared first on Dance Spirit.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nHow to Deal With Mid-Comp-Season Burnout\n\nWhile full of excitement and fun, competitions are also mentally and physically taxing. It’s easy to find yourself run down after months of rehearsing and performing for hours on end every week. How can both teachers and dancers keep normal fatigue from turning into burnout? By recognizing the telltale signs and making small but meaningful changes.\n\nSymptoms of Burnout\n\nAccording to Marissa Graham, a former professional dancer who is now a fitness and health coach focusing on burnout, dancers are particularly susceptible to burnout thanks to several compounding factors: Many have a perfectionistic, type A personality, they frequently deal with rejection, and they’re under physical stress.\n\nSigns of burnout can be both physical and emotional. “If you’re getting sick or injured consistently, or find yourself saying you’re tired all the time, you’re probably burnt-out,” she explains. “But the less talked-about signs of burnout also include a lack of empathy for the things and people you normally care about, as well as a lack of self-efficacy—feeling like your accomplishments no longer matter.”\n\nSlowing the Cycle\n\nIt’s easier to prevent burning out than it is to bounce back from it. Blake Piatczyc, owner of BPM Dance Complex in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, and a national director of In10sity Dance Competition, says team bonding activities and prioritizing personal mentorship can help ease the mental load for competitive students. “We’re also very careful to only schedule the rehearsals and technique classes that our dancers actually need, so they’re getting that conditioning and building stamina for competitions, but they have time to just be kids, too,” he says.\n\nSimilarly, Jenna Eberhardt, competition director of Dance Cavise Studios in Mamaroneck, New York, and judge for Journey Dance Competition, prioritizes her own rest during built-in holiday breaks from dance and encourages students to do the same. “As dancers we feel like we need to keep doing more and more, but I’ve actually found that after some time off, everyone comes back refreshed and the routines look cleaner,” she explains.\n\nFinding ways to keep competitive performances from feeling repetitive can also help students and teachers stave off burnout. Piatczyc aims for variety in the approximately 200 dances BPM enters into each competition, “so that dancers aren’t feeling stuck in any one style.” Eberhardt is open to making small choreographic changes, like turning dou"
