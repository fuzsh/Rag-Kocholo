        "text": "Tomorrow night, Thursday, September 14th – Mindi Abair and The Boneshakers to celebrate their new album release date of September 15th.\n\nBy: Judy Shields\n\nLos Angeles, California (The Hollywood Times) September 13, 2017 “I write 99% of the music, to me it is really the way to get much of you on a CD as possible and I think playing other people’s music is a blast, but sometimes you wish you wrote a song, you have to play it. I think writing music just really helps you emote and helps people to understand what is in your heart and where you are coming from. I always love to write the song and record it.” Mindi Abair told The Hollywood Times today.\n\nIt was great speaking to Mindi Abair this afternoon about her new album Mindi Abair and The Boneshakers: The EastWest Sessions. The album will be released this Friday, September 15, 2017. This album is full of wonderful songs written or co-written by Mindi Abair.\n\nThe album starts off with awesome saxophone music, then this amazing voice, soulful and gritty, it’s Mindi Abair! “Vinyl,” the first song on the album will get you up and dancing and if you are not able to get up off your seat, you will be tapping your feet.\n\nEach song has its own unique tone and style. Mindi has done a great job with the lyrics, the music and her saxophone playing. The fourth song “Pretty Good For A Girl” featuring Joe Bonamassa has turned out to be an Anthem song for all women to whom inspire us all and uplift women.\n\nThis is a must album for all music lovers, no matter what genre of music you enjoy; this is truly an album to add to your collection.\n\nIt will be available on itunes so you can have it to take along on your iphone or android for your listening pleasure everywhere you go. Click the link to https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-eastwest-sessions/id1264565123\n\nBut, before you can buy it this Friday, Mindi Abair and the Boneshakers will be at the Grammy Museum, right here at LA Live in Los Angeles to talk about the new album tomorrow, Thursday, September 14th. So what better way to inspire us, than give us the opportunity to listen to some of the tracks, live and in person!\n\nSo don’t miss this once in a lifetime opportunity. Tickets are still available. Here is the link for the Grammy Museum and your chance to get a ticket. http://www.grammymuseum.org/events/detail/mindi-abair\n\nThe cover was shot on Sunset Blvd and it took four tries for the shot. It came out great with the shadows of the band members. Mindi said it was taken at 7:15 in the morning.\n\nThe phone conversation went something like this:\n\nTHT: Was David Sanborn an influence for you?\n\nMA: Absolutely, yeah! I think he had an influence, probably everyone that came after him, whether they want to admit it or not. He was someone who played with huge pop and rock stars, singer, songwriters, the Paul Butterfield Blues band, he had a solo career that was just great. He was like the missing link for me. I was watching MTV and thinking, wow I want to be Tina Turner or Heart. I watched the energy they had, I didn’t know you could do that with a saxophone until David Sanborn came out with his music. It sounded like awesome rock that was on the radio, yet he was a lead singer with a saxophone in his hand, the coolest thing in the world.\n\nTHT: How did you get into music and playing the saxophone?\n\nMA: I grew up on the road with my Dad’s band, which was called The Entertainers, I was about five then. There was a lot of music every day. My Grandmother was an opera singer, so a lot of varied music growing up. When school started, I was lucky enough to have a band program and our band instructor, Ann Reynolds put a bunch of instruments out on the ground and said pick out which one appeals to you, sit down and learn how to play it. That is what I did and I picked the saxophone because I watched my Dad play it. His knees were knocking together and he was rocking out having a blast, so I choose the saxophone because it looked like a lot of fun and I choose well!\n\nTHT: You were a roadie at such a young age.\n\nMA: I was lucky that no one told me that it was odd for a girl to play a saxophone until it was way too late. Everyone just went with me, it was something that I found my identity with and I really love it and it became a part of who I really was. It became an extension of me and what a cool thing to have an instrument that helps amplify who you are and a voice bigger than you would normally have.\n\nTHT: How old where you when you played your first concert?\n\nMA: I would do anything they would allow me to do. My Dad had a recording studio in our house, there was my parent’s bedroom, my bedroom and the third bedroom was a recording studio. One day my Dad said you are coming along on this one, I was 10 years old, and he said so why don’t you join me since I need a horn section for this song we are recording. He recorded me and him and I thought that was pretty cool.\n\nTHT: When did you write your first song?\n\nMA: I would always be messing around in elementary, middle school and high school and just mouthing words of a song. I didn’t really write songs until I was in college. I was learning the words of music. Delving into what I was doing, some lessons in school and just playing and having a good time.\n\nTHT: Is this your first record with The Boneshakers?\n\nMA: This is actually our second record. Our first record was a live record. When Randy Jacobs, who is the Grand Poobah and founder of The Boneshakers, we decided to make it official in 2015 and we became to go with Mindi Abair and The Boneshakers. The band is so special and after three days of rehearsal we knew, it was incredible. Randy and I have been friends for over 20 years, we were in a rock band together when I first moved to LA. He would do back flips right into the audience and a tremendous performer. The Boneshakers were playing at the Newport Jazz Festival on one stage and I was playing on another stage. I went over and just sat in and it was just wonderful. What music should be and I stayed on the stage all night.\n\nThis is the way music should be, so much fun and that is what made us say, let’s just join forces. Our first show was in Seattle and it was recorded live and became our live recorded record, which came out in September 2015.\n\nMindi said that they are the currently number 3 on the radio Blues/Rock album chart radio and she is totally excited about it and she is having fun.\n\nMindi also spoke about her number 4 song “Pretty Good For A Girl” and how that song came about.\n\n“It has started to climb up the charts and take a life of its own. You never know what people are going to latch onto, what is going to rise above. “Pretty Good For A Girl” was a song I wrote about being a woman in a man’s world. A lot of us have done something amazing, and broken the glass ceiling or cracked it or done something like that and only to have someone would say ‘That’s pretty good… for a girl.’” I have had that said to me quite a few times over the years, so I thought I would write a tongue and cheek song about it. It has become this type of anthem. A motivation, a call of action and it’s been fun to watch the transformation.\n\nI made a website called Pretty Good For A Girl.net and I thought it would feature all these women who are doing incredible things and because sometimes we don’t celebrate each other like we should. It inspires me to see these amazing ladies.\n\nI created it mostly for me to have a place to pay homage to these wonderful women. But I want people to go there and be part of it. The incredible women that we are featuring every week, and are doing these great things.\n\nWe also put out a call to action. We are making a music video for “Pretty Good For A Girl” that I want to feature women in all walks of life doing amazing things. So there is a promotion we are doing asking women to send in 20 or 30 second videos of themselves of doing what you do in action. Whether you are an incredible skateboarder, an artist painting, a doctor saving someone’s life, a guitarist rocking out, we want to see so we can release the clips in this music video to empower woman. Check out the link below.\n\nBelow is a link to the PrettyGoodForAGirl website: https://www.prettygoodforagirl.net/\n\nMindi also works pretty tirelessly about having music back in schools. Kids getting an education in music is important. It’s a different way of learning and understanding language, and what you can accomplish in life. She is a trustee for the Recording Academy which puts on the Grammys. They are putting together something that is coming out in a couple of months. A dream would be to put a teacher in every school for music. If anyone could do it, she would hope that the Recording Academy can. It is something that can happen and be a better world to live in with music. She really believe that there is enough fire power out there to make a difference in bringing music back into school at an early age.\n\nTour Info: http://www.mindiabair.com/tour/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MindiAbair/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/mindiabair\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mindiabair/\n\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfjJsy3yK8wdvN6RyPh6jlg\n\nAbout Mindi Abair and The Boneshakers\n\nOne of the most recognized and sought-after saxophonists/vocalists, two-time GRAMMY nominee Mindi Abair has been electrifying audiences with her dynamic live performances and utter command of the saxophone since her debut album in 2000. No one since Junior Walker has brought saxophone and vocals in one package to the forefront of modern music, with a raucous tone and dynamic stage presence. She has garnered ten #1 radio hits, six Top 5 solo records and two #1 spots on the Billboard album charts. In 2014, Mindi received her first GRAMMY® nomination in the Best Pop Instrumental Album category, followed by a 2015 GRAMMY® nomination for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album for her solo LP Wild Heart featuring Gregg Allman, Joe Perry, Trombone Shorty, Booker T. Jones, Keb’ Mo’, and Max Weinberg.\n\nThe daughter and granddaughter of working musicians, Abair continues to captivate fans while evolving her sound. In 2014, after two seasons as the featured saxophonist on the hit series American Idol, Abair released Wild Heart. This LP showcased a compilation of grittier rock and soul tracks featuring some of the biggest names in music. To help translate this sound to her live shows, Mindi enlisted longtime friend and The Boneshakers founder Randy Jacobs (Bonnie Raitt, Was Not Was, Willie Nelson) to inject his brand of Detroit Blues Rock. The collaboration was undeniable, and it lead to an almost immediate decision to join forces creatively. Mindi Abair and The Boneshakers features band leader Mindi Abair (Saxophone, Vocals), Randy Jacobs (Guitar, Vocals), Sweet Pea Atkinson (Vocals), Rodney Lee (Keys), Derek Frank (Bass, Vocals), and Third Richardson (Drums, Vocals). Their first record together Mindi Abair and The Boneshakers LIVE in Seattle was released September 2015 to significant critical acclaim, and a 2 ½ year non-stop tour schedule across the US.\n\nIn April 2017, the band took a short break to record their first studio record. The EastWest Sessions was recorded over five days at legendary Hollywood recording studio EastWest Studios with renowned Blues Rock producer Kevin Shirley (Led Zepplin, Joe Bonamassa, The Black Crowes, Aerosmith). The album, which will be released September 15, 2017, is a powerful, bluesy, momentous, and deeply emotional journey. The album features a track with iconic blues guitarist Joe Bonamassa, and 2017 GRAMMY® winner in the Best Contemporary Blues Album category, Fantastic Negrito.\n\nShe authored the book “How To Play Madison Square Garden – A Guide to Stage Performance” and serves as a National Trustee for The Recording Academy.\n\nThe artists she’s toured with and/or recorded with are a testament to her talent: Aerosmith, Gregg Allman, Keb’ Mo’, Joe Perry, Bobby Rush, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Lalah Hathaway, Duran Duran, Adam Sandler, Lee Ritenour, The Backstreet Boys, Booker T. Jones, Jimmy Webb, Mandy Moore, Max Weinberg, Bill Champlin, David Pack, Mocean Worker, The Ides of March, Rick Braun, Teena Marie, Bobby Lyle, Jonathan Butler, and Peter White.\n\nLook Mindi Abair up on Wikipedia, there I some great info. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindi_Abair\n\nAbout the Grammy Museum\n\nEstablished in 2008 as a partnership between the Recording Academy and AEG, the GRAMMY Museum is a non-profit organization dedicated to cultivating a greater understanding of the history and significance of music.

From singer, songwriter and musician to actress and dancer, she embodies what it truly means to be an entertainer. A music prodigy, Gibson exploded on the Billboard Pop Charts at the tender age of 16 with the self-penned “Only in My Dreams.” The “Original Pop Princess” quickly became the youngest artist ever to write, produce and perform a No. 1 hit song, “Foolish Beat,” and entered the Guinness Book of World Records. To date, she is still the youngest female to hold that record. She has sold more than 16 million albums worldwide, performed for British Royalty and hosted “The American Music Awards,” produced by friend and legend Dick Clark.\n\nAfter conquering the pop world with three consecutive albums and world tours, she set her sights on the theater and starred in 17 musicals in 17 years. Gibson made her mark in the Broadway production of “Les Miserables” as Eponine. She broke box office records in the London West End production of “Grease” as Sandy. She then took the stage in the U.S. Broadway tours of “Grease” as Rizzo and “Funny Girl” as Fanny Brice. She also wowed critics as Belle in Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast,” Gypsy Rose Lee in “Gypsy,” Cinderella in the national production of “Cinderella,” with Eartha Kitt, Velma Kelly in “Chicago,” and Sally Bowles in the Broadway revival of “Cabaret,” with Neil Patrick Harris. Gibson bridged the gap between pop music and Broadway with her one-woman show, “Pop Goes Broadway.” She currently has two original Broadway musicals in the works, one with Jimmy Van Patten entitled “Flunkytown” and the other entitled “Skirts” as composer and lyricist with Hilary Carlip and Katie Ford. To fill her passion of mentoring and fostering young performers and songwriters, she also created Debbie Gibson’s Electric Youth, a series of performing arts camps and music boot camps. Gibson made her debut in the world of orchestration for Dr. Rutledge’s documentary “3 Billion and Counting,” about Malaria prevention in third world countries.

His work ethic and determination were evident even from a young age, but basketball was always what drove him. A stand-out guard in high school, he starred for Parkview Arts and Science Magnet High.

By 18, they were buying and flipping homes, and by their mid-20s they had a thriving real estate, design and renovation business with hundreds of clients. Scott’s love of acting began during elementary school. He then started doing improv, sketch and standup comedy while in high school.

He and Jonathan established “Scott Brothers Entertainment,” which produces award winning and engaging content in all genres for TV, film and digital platforms.

In 2015 the Scott brothers wrote and recorded two original tracks, “Hold On” and “Let the Night Shine In,” with music producers Victoria Shaw and Chad Carlson. “Hold On” hit the Billboard Hot Country charts within the first month of its release.

In January, Fisher’s take as Doody in FOX’s Emmy-winning broadcast of “Grease: LIVE” earned him critical acclaim and was deemed the show’s breakout star by MTV and People Magazine. That spring, he released his first single, “All About Us,” which was produced by Oak Felder (Alessia Cara, Arianna Grande, Rihanna) and melded influences of pop/soul/R&B. The song was the #2 most added song and a top 30 hit at pop radio. In August, Fisher released his self-titled EP, which debuted #18 on the Billboard Heatseeker album chart.\n\nAfter performing on The Today Show, the ESPY’s Red Carpet Special and opening for Alicia Keys at the Apple Music Festival, Fisher was tagged to perform the end title credit to Disney’s hit animated feature film “Moana” with award winning songwriter/producer Lin-Manual Miranda. Fisher, who has been called out by Miranda as “super-talented,” saw a lifelong dream of performing on Broadway come to fruition when he joined the cast of Miranda’s uber-hit “Hamilton,” where he took on the dual roles of John Laurens and Philip Hamilton.\n\nWhen ABC was curating the music for “When We Rise,” an eight-hour miniseries event with music guiding the four and a half decade storyline, they looked no further than Fisher to cover the 70’s classic, “I’d Love to Change the World.” The song opened the two-hour premiere, directed by Gus Van Sant.\n\nThe underlying thread to all Fisher’s success across the board is music. He’s not just a multi-talented performer but also a storyteller. His influences are diverse and can be traced back to his ays growing up in a football town outside of Birmingham, Alabama, where he cultivated his tastes by listening to everything from Luther Vandross to Metallica while simultaneous developing his acting skills at the Birmingham-based Red Mountain Theatre Company.\n\nWith a bright future in front of him, 2017 is sure to be another banner year as Fisher readies his debut full-length album. This fall he will release his new single “MESS” with Hollywood Records.

But after a brief sabbatical from WWE, the sisters began an astonishing reinvention, with Nikki cementing herself as the division’s mean-girl powerhouse and earning a Divas title reign that lasted a record-setting 301 days. Now, as a pivotal member of the SmackDown LIVE roster, Bella continues to test the limits of competition in a complete and totally fearless fashion.\n\nBella is the star of E!’s hit reality shows “Total Bellas” and “Total Divas.” She and Brie are continuing to grow their brand with their birdie bee apparel line and Belle Radici wine.

His extraordinary skills on the gridiron and elite athleticism raised the bar for Wide Receivers in the league. Owens is credited with being one of the most exciting and electrifying players to ever play the game, with 1078 Receptions, 15,935 yards and 153 touchdowns during the span of his 15 year career.\n\nOwens was born in Alexander City, AL, where he attended Benjamin Russell High School. There he excelled in several sports including football, basketball, baseball and track. After being recruited by the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC), Owens made a name for himself as an explosive receiver, earning first team All-Southern Conference honors and setting a school record for catching a pass 11 consecutive games.\n\nOwens was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the third round of the 1996 NFL draft, spending eight seasons with the team. He made his mark in the league by amassing a highlight reel of spectacular plays and performances. This includes a game-winning touchdown against the Green Bay Packers in a 1998 wild-card playoff games that was dubbed “The Catch II”; a record breaking day of December 17, 2000 when he surpassed the 50 year old mark for the single-game reception total; and his role in leading the 49ers to the second greatest comeback in NFL playoff history, which occurred against the New York Giants in 2002.\n\nIn 2004 Owens joined the Philadelphia Eagles, making an immediate impact on the team, averaging one touchdown per game. This helped the Eagles to win 13 of its first 14 games, paving the way to Super Bowl XXXIX. Despite a late season injury that doctors had projected would take weeks to heal, Owens started the game and had nine receptions and 122 yards in a disappointing loss to the New England Patriots. Owens went on to play for the Dallas Cowboys, embarking on another storied legacy. In his first season with the team, he led the league with 13 regular season touchdowns, and this despite a serious tendon injury to his finger. While doctors recommended season ending surgery, Owens elected to wait until the end of the season to repair the damage. In 2007 he set a Dallas Cowboys record with 15 touchdown receptions and helped lead the team to the NFC East divisional title for the first time since 1988. He also amassed 69 catches for 1,052 yards and 10 touchdowns in his last season for the Dallas Cowboys. Owens entered his 14th NFL season with the Buffalo Bills. It was in this season that he became only the sixth player to record 1,000 career catches. He also added stints with the Cincinnati Bengals and the Seattle Seahawks to his resume.\n\nOwens has garnered countless awards and accolades for his work on and off the field, including six Pro Bowl appearances, five-time Associated Press All-Pro, Recorded Five Seasons with 13 or more touchdowns, and the first to score a touchdown in seven straight “Monday Night Football” games. On September 15, 2008 in yet another remarkable Monday Night Game, Owens moved into second place on the NFL’s all-time career touchdown list. Owens’ work on the field is only mirrored by his accomplishments off the field, including partnering with the Alzheimer’s Association, which is near and dear to his heart. His beloved grandmother Alice succumbed to the disease three years ago. He also testified before Congress to raise awareness about the disease. Owens is also a respected and best-selling author, penning a children’s book, “Little T Learns to Share,” and a fitness book, “T.O.’s Finding Fitness.” His latest endeavor, the “What TO Do” Global Campaign, is an initiative aimed at empowering and motivating youth around the world through speaking, workshops and with the launch of an inspirational clothing line for men, women and children.
