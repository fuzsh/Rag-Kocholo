        "text": "Fortesa Hoti (24) is a Kosovo born Swedish actress. She moved to Sweden with her family in 1992, and is best known for her role as Roxana Nilsson in the Swedish TV series Andra Avenyn. Fortesa Hoti has also starred in Swedish movies such as Orion, Ciao Bella and the short film Påfågeln. You can see her as well in the music video for the Swedish music group Medina’s song Sagoland.\n\nIn an interview for the Swedish Webb-TV Show “The fabulous life of Ana Gina”, she says that people often mistake her for being as cocky as her character Roxana. Fortesa describes herself as a happy and outgoing person, the total opposite of Roxana. The Kosovo born actress loves heights, and lives by her own motto ”Live life before life itself lives you”. In the interview, Hoti also talks about her car accident. She was lucky enough to walk away with only a little scratch, which she got from trying to get her phone that was lying in the engine. Her family were just happy that she is alive considering how the the car looked after the accident.\n\nIn an interview with the Swedish radio station Sveriges Radio, Fortesa Hoti talks about how she got the role as Roxana in Andra Avenyn through a televised casting competition. Her expectation coming in to the competition were to have fun and just do something she hasn’t done before. She also saw it as a great opportunity to become an actress and create memories for life. When asked about the attention she gets since the TV Series started, Hoti says it’s both positive and negative. The positive is the acknowledgement and all the compliments, which she sees as a drive to continue her work. But it can be hard at times she says, when it comes to being recognized in the streets. Hoti laughs after saying that she sometimes wonders if it’s something wrong with her clothes because of all the staring.\n\nThe talented actress was nominated by the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, in the category “best female actress in a TV Series” in 2007 and 2008. Fortesa Hoti tells ”Sveriges Radio” that a huge door opened through that nomination and that the TV Series Andra Avenyn have a lot of dedicated fans. Hoti looks up to her favorite actress Julia Roberts and says that her dream role would be playing Erin Brokovich in a second movie.\n\nAccording to an article in Hn.se (Hallands Nyheter), in 2011 Fortesa Hoti finished shooting the Swedish film ”I främmande land,” which is about two Albanian families from Kosovo living in Sweden. The film deals with subjects as racism, religion, and cultural clashes. The film is directed by a Kosovar Albanian director, Nimon Mucaj.\n\nSee her interview for the Swedish webb-tv show “The Fabulous life of Ana Gina”\n\nSee the preview for her film “Orion”\n\nFortesa Hoti in Medina’s music video – Sagoland\n\nTony Dovolani is the winner of the Dancing With The Stars – All Stars. The finale was America’s most watched show of the season. Licia Cleaveland, a grandmother of three from Clayton, Georgia, shares her love for Tony and the pure joy for his win. Tony, born in Kosovo, is undoubtedly, one of the best ambassadors of Albanians abroad. He is a true champion of the dance and of the small nation.\n\nBy Licia Cleaveland\n\nI wanted to shout to the world MY TONY WON!!! Yes, last Tuesday night was one to remember for a lifetime. My Tony finally won Dancing With The Stars (DWST).\n\nI first saw Tony Dovolani about fifteen years ago as I was watching an International Ballroom Championship competition. It was the Latin finals. I was just dazzled by this man who was sooo sexy, I found myself watching him instead of his partner. I made a point to memorize his name and to continue to spot him at other competitions. Did I mention I love ballroom dancing?!\n\nSo on with my story. When DWST debuted on ABC, I signed up for life! What a great first year. Little did I know the best was about to come. The second year opened with introductions and I nearly fell off the sofa – Tony Dovolani was on DWTS and I could see him every week.\n\nLife could not get better than this!!!Then slowly reality set in….if he didn’t get a great partner people would never get to see his “stuff”. It seemed like forever, and then Season 8 arrived. Tony and the talented Melissa Rycroft were great. At last my Tony was shining, and everyone was watching him and then his beautiful story ended in third place.\n\nI was so sad. So close and yet so far. I continued to watch for years, I have never missed an episode of DWTS. And this year I hit the jackpot–my Tony got his talented partner (Melissa Rycroft) back, and everyone got to see his real talent!\n\nThere is a funny little “we are all connected” backstory in connection to MY TONY. My daughter and son-in-law were posted in Kosovo shortly after the war. My daughter taught English as a second language, and found a wonderful young man she thought would be an excellent exchange student for his last year of high school.\n\nEnter Behar Xharra to the Cleaveland (our) family. That was the fall of 2002. I know of Tony. He is another Albanian and a great dancer! That is the first thing I told Behar upon meeting him at the airport. Of course, as soon as DWTS came on, I had Behar in front of the TV introducing him to his fellow compatriot.\n\nNow fast forward to the spring of 2012, Behar was about to graduate from grad school (he was so charming, we just couldn’t seem to ditch him and now he has “favorite child” status), and Behar is putting on a special gathering of Albanian diaspora in New York. And you guessed it, he meets in person MY TONY!! My life is complete ….my two favorite Albanians are now friends!!!\n\nLicia Cleaveland lives in Clayton, Georgia , USA. She is a grandmother of three, a Life Master at Bridge, a hat collector, and a professional at Feng Shui. She has visited Kosovo in 2002, Tony’s homeland, and has hosted and supported a student from there throughout his secondary and tertiary studies in the United States.\n\nLicia has recorded the DWST Finals show! She gets to watch Tony and Melissa Win everyday now – it just puts a great big smile on her face. Pure JOY!!!\n\n********\n\nVideo segment from the DWTS Finale 2012\n\nTony Dovolani and Melissa Rycroft live at Jimmy Kimmel Show. Tony wishes all the Albanians Happy 100 Years of Independence\n\nRita Ora is a symbol of Kosovar resilience. Her story of a refugee transformed into a global sensation is an inspiration not only for young women from Kosovo but from around the world, wishing to follow their calling and potential. Her path to success attests that the past does not hold back young people of Kosovo; they present one of the most vibrant societies in Europe, continuously striving to create life and success beyond the hardships that fate brought to them a decade ago.\n\nRita Ora of Kosovo continues to be a sensation in the United Kingdom and beyond. Her debut album, O.R.A. has reached the Nr.1 spot in the UK Official Charts in just one week from its release. Her song How We DO (Party) remains in the Top Singles charts for several weeks.\n\nRita Ora is a symbol of Kosovar resilience. Her story of a Kosovar refugee transformed into a global sensation is an inspiration not only for young women from Kosovo but from around the world, wishing to follow their calling and potential.\n\nRita’s family fled Kosovo during the 1999 war, to settle as refugees in the UK. Her family was among the one million Kosovar Albanians to have been expelled by the Milosevic regime. She was one year old.\n\nFor a country of 1.8 million that came out of war just a decade ago, Rita Ora is a symbol of hope and the potential that Kosovo presents to the world. Her path to success attests that the past does not hold back young people of Kosovo; they present one of the most vibrant societies in Europe, continuously striving to create life and success beyond the hardships that fate brought to them a decade ago. The openness to the world and opportunities given to the young country have yet to show results. Other former Kosovar Albanian refugees include Xherdan Shaqiri (football player of FC Bayern Munich), Melinda Ademi (American Idol Contestant), Adrian Bujupi (Germany X Factor runner up), Fatmire Bajramaj (Fifa Ballon d’Or 2010 nominee), founders of Pizza Famiglia (New York City’s biggest Pizza Chain), Fatbardhe Hetemaj (UNHCR Refugee Woman of the Year).\n\nRita has become a champion of young and ambitious women in Kosovo. She is a role model to many. Her success has opened the doors for many young women to seek their dreams and reach their potential in the field of music, art, science and sports.\n\nRita Ora has recently announced that she will return to her homeland Kosovo for a concert. She has been invited by the President of the country, Atifete Jahjaga, as way to celebrate Kosovo and her reign in the world music. She will hold a concert for the 100th anniversary of Independence of Albania.\n\nKosovars across the spectrum have been celebrating the success of Rita Ora. It can be observed across the social media sites: Facebook, Twitter, personal blogs, news media, and even politicians. In her first video dairy, before she released any of her singles, Rita said: “I moved from Kosovo. And I wish I was around my people…I think Kosovo as a nation, we are very proud of where we’re from because it is such a small place, and everyone that succeeds from there its just a big deal. So I am doing it for my family and my country, as much as I am doing it for everyone else.” [see video from minute: 1.50]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-xlXNeZBsc\n\n***\n\nUpdated: Rita Ora released her single “Shine Ya Light” filmed in her birthplace Prishtina, Kosovo.\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH182aLsVig?feature=player_detailpage&w=640&h=360]\n\nBy Behar Xharra for the KosovoDiaspora.org blog\n\nBefore the war in 1999, very few people from Kosovo had the opportunity to travel and meet the world outside of the Balkans. Today, Kosovars not only reach corners of the world, but they also use their experience and skills garnered at home and abroad to contribute to their area of work. One such Kosovo young professional is Alban Pruthi, who hails from Gjakova and currently lives and works in Washington D.C., USA.\n\nWith a bucket of hard work mixed with enduring drive and ambitions, as well as few spoons of great luck, I’ve ended up working with a reputable multinational institution, the International Finance Corporation, utilizing the private sector for development goals. In an ocean of well-thought and intended objectives, my role is to help the process of building and or strengthening financial institutions worldwide. In plain words, unleash access to, transparency, soundness and stability of financial sector. And, I’d like to believe prosperity for all. I have only work to blame for taking me to extraordinary voyages around different parts of the world. Of course, the passionate drive for promoting my homeland, culture, people while learning about others is a culprit too.\n\nIn generous spirits, I would like to share few personal non-exhausting traveling souvenirs for your inspirational consumption. After all, St. Augustine was awfully right saying “The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.”\n\n1. The “Good Bay” of Extreme Contrasts\n\nLanding in Mumbai, India immediately brought close the humble, noble, lifeless, caring face of an Albanian icon, the one and only Mother Teresa. Given that India has not yet recognized Kosova, it helped to employ Loving-Mother-Of-All as a passport to introduce my homeland and its people to my new acquaintances.\n\nI found the “Good Bay” to be a megacity of extreme contrasts lacking a sound middle ground. On one hand full of heavenly and meticulously pristine and aromatized luxurious hotels, shops, restaurants and what not, accessible only to the rich and famous as well as tourists. On the other, heart/eye breaking pockets of slums full of dust, dirt, grayness inhabited by laborious and extra active hardworking people with eyes full of sparkle and life.\n\nAn energetic and dynamic city that allowed me to get a sense of how much is “a billion of people.” To experience the loud noise it makes, challenges it faces, and extremities it employs to charm and touch an innocent and ordinary Kosovar visitor, who ultimately ends up in a dilemma of choice between disdain and love. A place that truly fed and misused my sixth senses!\n\n2. Sweet Seoul, South Korea\n\nDeep down, I’ve always known I have a bit of an Asian gene in my DNA. This claim gains ground if one considers the mere fact that the Balkans, including Kosova, for centuries have been a very fertile crossroad of various cultures and all you can name it. It did help and filled me with enormous pride to be in a country that has recognized my beloved but work in progress homeland.\n\nAfter a 14 ½ hours air journey, walking in the hallways of Incheon International Airport, I forgot I was in a transportation facility. I thought I had landed in a mega cultural complex full of awesome activities ranging from live performances of Gangnam style—a Korean song that took the world by thunder— to painting classes and historical enactments of the rich royal past. It truly felt great being in the prosperous Korea!\n\nOnce in Seoul, I found a modern city wrapped in concrete and tall glass edifices often displaying architectural elegance embraced by traditional touches. The rich spicy cuisine and the brown rice green tea opened my mouth and allowed me to share interesting facts about my homeland with street acquaintances who spoke somewhat broken English. Yet, they possessed the latest tech gadgets.\n\nBut, I realized that modernity co-existed peacefully with the old past in the walls within walls of royal palaces with flying eagle roofs, including traditional meticulous neighborhoods with super cute Hanok, which is a term for homes. A once buried river brought to life by a green minded mayor, nourished downtown Seoul and its inhabitants. It gave me hope for the buried river in the centre of Prishtina, the dynamic capital of Kosova.\n\n3. Tasty 2-cities of Truly Asia Malaysia\n\nHappily escaping the cold weather of Northern Hemisphere, my lungs were greeted by the humid tropical air served freely at Kuala Lumpur, the inviting capital of Malaysia. My eyes cherished the warm welcoming and diverse faces of locals speaking good English. Walking on the land of another country that has recognized Kosova tricked me to forget the work waiting for me and the long journey I had to get there.\n\nWhile purposefully getting lost in the contemporary architectural and urbanized Kuala Lumpur and in the UNESCO city port of Melaka, I made sure to consume “all-I-could” from the tripartite cultural combo of Malay, Chinese, Indian and some leftovers of colonial Europe. The menu included numerous tropical mosques with lush palm gardens, humming smoky Chinese and Hindu temples bursting in colors and icons— a truly spiritual harmony of coexistence. Something shouting out loud: SAFEGUARD AND CHEERISH DIVERSITY. Something, my homeland would benefit recalling and embracing.\n\nHaving walked and walked in exploring these 2 cities, I’d often indulge on a BMW ride— a tasty banana, mango, and watermelon fresh smoothie, which made me and my tummy extra happy. All spicy delicious food aside that challenged my tongue, I surrendered to guava, mangosteen, longan, durian—tropical fruits I had never eaten before.\n\nFrom my window plane seat ascending to free skies, I made sure to say goodbye to slick omnipotent Petronas towers and other remarkable landmarks of the inspiring Malaysia. Good bye, until next time.\n\n****\n\nAlban Pruthi is a young professional in international development with over 5 years of varied experience in the field of credit reporting and other financial infrastructure cross-cutting themes, resettlement, rehabilitation, elections, media and broadcasting. Alban has a B.A. in Political Science and European Studies from the American University of Bulgaria and an M.A. in International Relations and Economics from School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of Johns Hopkins University. He is native in Albanian, fluent in English, has a good working command in Serbo-Croatian and Italian, as well as a rudimentary knowledge of French, German and Bulgarian. He is originally from Gjakova, Kosova but lives and works in Washington DC, USA.\n\nHe spends a lot of his time in Hollywood—in rehearsals, costume fittings, television appearances, choreography sessions, performances and training practices—but the Dancing With the Stars professional dancer calls Stamford his home\n\nAs soon as Tony Dovolani arrives at Stamford’s Parkway Diner, the lunch crowd begins to eat him up like the blue-plate special. A fan checks her false eyelashes and asks the Dancing with the Stars celebrity to pose for a picture. A group of middle-aged men discreetly text their wives. One beckons Tony to their booth with a special request: “She’s a huge fan,” he says about his wife as he hands Tony his BlackBerry and asks him to say hi.\n\nThe ballroom star has just gotten off a plane. He hasn’t seen his wife and three adorable kids in days, and he’s racked up enough frequent-flier miles in the past year to make him a first-class grouch. Still, his mood in the diner is relaxed and gregarious. “It’s me, Tony Dovolani from ABC’s Dancing with the Stars,” he says into the BlackBerry. “And I am here at the diner in Stamford where I used to work.”\n\nThis casual eatery on High Ridge Road, once called the Country Diner, is the place where Tony likes to say he took his “first steps.” It was here that the teenage Tony, a refugee from the war in Kosovo, learned English waiting tables. It is the place where the proud ethnic Albanian figured out a distinctly American truism: “If you make people happy, you get great tips and make a lot more money, which I did.”\n\nAnd Stamford is where he got his first taste of the salsa, the rumba and the cha-cha. Those sexy, powerful Latin dances would take Tony to the highest levels in international ballroom competition, making him a two-time world champion in American Rhythm style.\n\nThat title—as well as his dark good looks and abundant charm—would earn him his first turn as a professional partner on ABC’s popular reality ballroom competition. There, his nine-season quest (so far) for the tacky but coveted mirror-ball trophy would make him as much of a star as some of the major and minor celebrities he waltzed into the studio ballroom on our TV screens. And it all began in Stamford, says Tony, of his improbable rise from diner dishwasher to ballroom’s leading man.\n\nTony, who lived in Stamford for sixteen years after his family’s 1989 escape from Kosovo, has a story that is captivating for its Hollywood-movie plot lines. And we haven’t even covered the part where he proposed to his wife, Lina, on their first date, taught actor Richard Gere how to waltz and played ballroom bad boy in the 2004 movie Shall We Dance?\n\n“If someone told you his story—that he escaped to this country when he was just fifteen and became a star—people might think you were making it up,” says John DePalma, one of Tony’s first ballroom instructors in Stamford. “It is such an American dream story it almost seems impossible. But it’s all true. And if you knew Tony, you would understand how he made it all possible. He is that determined a guy.”\n\nComing to America\n\nRaised in Kosovo’s capital of Pristina, Tony (born Ditron) was the middle child in a middle-class family of ethnic Albanian Muslims. He led a life of privilege until his homeland was fractured by political and social conflict in the 1980s. His father Munir’s elite status as chief executive at a computer company made the Dovolanis targets for persecution, arrest, even murder. “We had to leave,” Tony says. “We were very much in danger and we had no choice.”\n\nGranted political asylum, Tony, his father, younger brother Fisnik and older sister Laura came straight to Stamford. (Tony’s parents are divorced and his mother remains in Kosovo.) Here the family had the support of Tony’s uncles, established stonemasons, as well as the city’s tight-knit Albanian American community. “Christian, Muslim, it doesn’t matter. If you are Albanian, they are there for you.”\n\nDespite the anchor of community, the upheaval was still enormous. “My dad went from being the chief executive to the doorman at the Regency Towers,” says Tony, who found work as a dishwasher and put his Kosovo dreams of being an architect on hold. In Pristina, math and science were his strongest subjects. Here, he tried Stamford High School but quit after four days. “It was a waste of time for me to learn things I already knew. My family needed the money more, so I walked out and went back to the diner.”\n\nQuickly promoted to waiter, the job became his course in all things American. “I knew three words, ‘Hi, I’m Tony.’” He messed up orders, bringing out salmon instead of an omelet on his memorable first day. But he always learned from his mistakes and survived by turning his\n\nlimitations into entertainment for his customers. “I made fun of myself. If I screwed up, I laughed. If they made fun of me, I didn’t mind. I wanted to learn. I am a very firm believer that if you want to be in America, you have to embrace the culture … and I wanted better tips.”\n\nThen, one fateful day, a diner cook showed Tony a flier. The former Fred Astaire Dance studio at the Ridgeway Shopping Center was offering a free lesson. Tony, who began studying Albanian dance at age three, worshiped iconic American dancers. “I loved Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly. I loved Michael Jackson. To me, America was musicals and happiness. Seeing Fred Astaire’s image on the flier was enough for me to check it out.”\n\nOn the Dance Floor\n\n“Let’s be honest here,” remembers John DePalma, who now owns the Metropolitan Dance Center at the Ridgeway and has been master of ceremonies on the PBS series Championship Ballroom Dancing. “Tony had more on his agenda than dance lessons. He also wanted to meet girls. Tony came to class wearing piles of gold chains, hip-hop clothes and spoke with a crude accent that made him sound like he was taking English classes in the Bronx.”\n\nBut when he danced, those rough edges were smoothed away. “We were all like, ‘Wow,’” recalls John. “Tony had no inhibitions when he moved. He just got it.”\n\nJohn says his teenage student was remarkable for his equal commitment to ballroom dancing and family. “Every time it was time for Tony to sign up for a new series of lessons, he would say, ‘First, let me go home and talk to my father.’ This was a family where everyone had to turn over their paycheck. But every time, Tony would come back and say, ‘My father would like me to continue.’”\n\nWithin a year, with his sights already set on professional dancing, Tony asked John about teaching, a bold request considering his lack of experience. “But there wasn’t a lot to discuss,” says John. “He was already better than most of the professionals on our staff.”\n\nTeaching would pay for Tony’s lessons and his first professional coach, Marianne Nicole, John’s wife. For nine years, while Tony taught and prepared for competition, he stayed at the diner for the tips, which grew as he entertained his customers, dancing his way to tables with plates lined up his arms.\n\nIn the meantime Tony began competing, first in American Smooth. Then he switched to Latin-themed American Rhythm when he partnered with Elena Grinenko. They won their world titles —a rarity for American dancers—in 2005 and 2006. “It was my proudest moment,” says Tony, who received the call to join the Dancing with the Stars cast shortly after the first title. “I felt like I was finally giving something back to this country.”\n\nTony’s fellow Dancing with the Stars professional Maksim “Maks” Chmerkovskiy says his best friend’s success has everything to do with his experience fleeing an oppressive regime. “When you come over here the way he did, dodging bullets, you take nothing for granted,” says Maks, who emigrated from Ukraine. “And Tony is an athlete. To get to the top of your game, in any professional sport, you don’t go out there thinking, ‘Oh I hope I come in second.’ You want to win.”\n\nTony reluctantly left Stamford four years ago as his TV career took off. Since the job and his other commitments require so much travel, he wanted his growing family closer to his siblings who now live near Stamford. “I think it kind of amuses the neighbors that one night I’m on T42V, and the next day they see me pulling in the driveway.”\n\nFeeling at Home\n\n“When I left Kosovo, Stamford really became my home and I miss it,” says Tony. “I like the vibe and the energy. I have my old students. My coaches. A lot of people who are important to me.”\n\nHigh on that list is Charlotte Johnston, a teacher at Turn of River Middle School. Tony calls his former ballroom student “my second mother.” She is honorary grandmother, or “TuTu,” to his children, and she often drives him back and forth to the airport. They became close after Tony coaxed her into taking a dance lesson with him at Stamford’s former Terrace Club, where they both went to dance social ballroom on weekend nights. They ended up touring the United States together as a winning Pro/Am team. “Charlotte taught me English, while I taught her to dance,” Tony says.\n\nCharlotte remembers a confident instructor eager to learn the American way. “Sometimes he would be in the studio and say something and immediately know it was wrong or off somehow. He would say, ‘Charlotte, what did I say? What did I do?’ He would ask me questions and I would explain things to him.”\n\nNothing about Tony’s success surprises Charlotte, including his choice to stay close to Stamford. “He is comfortable with a simple, middle-class life. Happy to come home to his family. He doesn’t have a need for a lot more,” she says.\n\nTony’s marriage to Lina, a doe-eyed fellow Albanian he met on a blind date arranged by his sister, has been a strong foundation as his fame grew, his close friends say. For years Tony was known for his playboy ways on and off the dance floor, but he seems to have settled easily into the role of family man. “I knew the minute I saw her walking across the parking lot that she was my wife,” says Tony.\n\nThe downside to celebrity is the lack of time Tony can give to his family. When we first met, he had flown home on a red-eye flight after Dancing with the Stars rehearsals. Though exhausted and eager to see his children—Luana, Adrian Ditron and Ariana—he sat down to chat and did not complain. “I wanted this,” he says. “All of it. I did it for my family and I embrace it. I don’t have a lot of patience for celebrities who complain, who won’t sign autographs or do interviews. I don’t understand it at all. I am like, ‘Excuse me? Didn’t you want to be famous?’”\n\nWhich explains his latest act. After Tony taught Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Stanley Tucci to dance for their roles in Shall We Dance?, he was cast in the film in the small but memorable part of Slick Willy. He liked the role enough to pursue more film work. Last month he began filming Pumping Up, an Angel Light Pictures production.\n\nYet Tony has no designs on leaving Dancing with the Stars. “I love the show, and I will come back as long as they will have me,” he says.\n\nThe guy from the diner still has that mirror-ball trophy to win.\n\n***\n\nThis article appeared in the March – April 2010 issue of Stamford Magazine\n\nSource: Beth Cooney.
