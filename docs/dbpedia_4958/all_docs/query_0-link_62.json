        "text": "Birdo's appearance for Derby Dead Pool\n\nFirst Appearance\n\nA Japanese game (1987)\n\nLatest Appearance\n\nPaper Mario 3DS (2012)\n\nHometown\n\nBen and Toad's Contest headquarters\n\nResidence\n\nOttawa, Ontario, Canada\n\nBirdo is a Super Mario character and a Nintendo character that is chosen to be a playable character in the Super Smash Bros. Bowl (series). She was lost to Jacquelynn Escalante, where she uses eggs to put in her mouth and a contestant on Wipeout Canada from Ottawa. Birdo, known in Japan as Kyasarin, is a fictional character in the Mario series of video games, who first appeared in Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic, which was localized for English audiences as Super Mario Bros. 2 and is an enemy to Mario. Since her appearance, Birdo has been a recurring character in the series, more frequently in the Mario sports games as a playable character, as well as Mario Party titles. Birdo has also made several cameos, particularly in the Super Smash Bros. series and the Wii video game Captain Rainbow.\n\nBirdo's gender in the original manual for Super Mario Bros. 2 asserts that Birdo is a boy who believes that he is a girl, and would rather be referred to as \"Birdetta\". Later releases of Super Mario Bros. 2 lacked any mention of her gender in either the game or the manual. Nintendo eventually established Birdo as female, first in Mario Tennis which depicted Birdo and Yoshi as boyfriend and girlfriend. However, several games portray her as male, such as Captain Rainbow, or refer to the gender confusion without assigning one, such as in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It has been suggested that Birdo is a post-op transsexual by transsexual video game developer Jennifer Reitz, while Over the Top editor Chris Kohler felt that it was a way of retconning her transgender status.\n\nBirdo has received mostly positive reception for her role in the Mario series; IGN editor Lucas M. Thomas suggested that Birdo was almost as well-known as Yoshi, a frequent partner of hers, in the sports games, while author Sherry Tuckle used Birdo as a demonstration of how Birdo's battle in Super Mario Bros. 2 presents a complex appearance yet sustains an assuring, rule-based world. However, some negative press exists, such as MTV Multiplayer editor Jason Cipriano, who criticized Birdo for being so popular over other Super Mario Bros. 2 characters. Birdo has made several appearances in other media, including the Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, as well as promotional material such as figurines.\n\nWhen N. Sapera, A. Ford and E. Cundal run the course, Birdo says \"Get back here, I don't want Pembroke, ON\". She begins to Walk Away.\n\nIn \"Wipeout Canada\", Birdo was mentioning Allen Ford from Pembroke in Ottawa but how can there will be a handsome arm wrestler like Kelsi Nielsen? She drives to Pembroke, Ontario and the song High School Musical from High School Musical 3 is heard during the drive to the house where Kelsi Nielsen lives and goes back to Ottawa where Tom Green lived longer than Kelsi Nielsen.\n\nBirdo is a Mario character and a Nintendo character in the Wipeout Canada series. She appeared with Kelsi Nielsen, and Olesya Rulin in the episode Chocolate Thunder. Her partner is Yoshi in most episodes expect Wipeout Workout.\n\nMain Article: Ontario contestants\n\nConcept and creation\n\nBirdo was born on April 16, 1984 in Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture. Birdo moved from Kobe to Ottawa when Birdo was five by having the DWTS judges voting her being out. Currently Birdo's voice actress is Yuko Kaida. As of 28 August 2024, Birdo has a red bow on her head. Birdo is a pink, anthropomorphic creature who wears a red bow on her head until an episode of Wipeout Canada that features Canadian arm wrestling, and has a round mouth that can fire eggs as projectiles.[1] Birdo also wears a large diamond ring on her finger. Birdo was originally featured in the Family Computer Disk System video game Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic (for Japan only) before it was converted to the Nintendo Entertainment System game Super Mario Bros. 2 for North American audiences.[2] In early art of Birdo, the character had an orange tone.Template:Citation needed Birdo's name was mistakenly switched with another Super Mario Bros. 2 enemy, Ostro, both in the manual and in the end credits.[3] The mistake persisted in the version of Super Mario Bros. 2 included in the Super Mario All-Stars compilation, but was corrected in the Game Boy Advance re-release titled Super Mario Advance.[4][5]\n\nFor Ben and Toad's Contest, Allen Ford said \"Judges have a double death of Birdo and Yoshi\" and Ford said \"They are never dead by the way. Besse Cooper is\". Birdo said on Jiroemon Kimura's death is that they are moving to Osaka Prefecture to meet their director Misao Okawa for being the oldest person living.\n\nSince the character's North American introduction, Birdo's gender has been an issue of discussion and speculation. The Japanese manual states the character's name is \"Catherine\", but it would rather be known as \"Cassie.\"Template:Citation needed However, in the first edition manual for the North American release of Super Mario Bros. 2, Birdo is referred to as a male who believes he is female and would rather be called \"Birdetta\".[6] In later printings, the second sentence was omitted, and no mention of Birdo being male was included in most later games featuring the character.[7] In the Japanese version of Super Smash Bros. Melee, Birdo, called Catherine, is described similarly to the original manual, though wanting to be called \"Cathy\".Template:Citation needed In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, it is said that Birdo is of \"indeterminate gender\".Template:Citation needed Birdo appears in the Wii Japan only video game Captain Rainbow, which delves into Birdo's gender.[8] Birdo is often lauded as the first transgender video game character.[2][7] The character was given a female voice actor in Super Mario Advance, a remake of Super Mario Bros. 2.[9] The Spanish language website for Mario Smash Football, while describing Birdo, suggests that the character's gender is indeterminate.[10] The European website for Mario Strikers Charged Football refers to her as a male character.[11]\n\nSince Birdo, Pearl Krabs and Allen Ford are friends, expect Allen Ford lives in Pembroke, Ontario. She has a relationship with Katara.\n\nShe owns the \"Kame Nakamura\" sign for the oldest people. On June 12, 2013, Birdo lost her bow, and was taken to Kyoto Prefecture to see the memorial for the death of Jiroemon Kimura.\n\nVoice\n\nBirdo's voice has changed a lot over the years. In Mario Tennis and Super Mario Advance (a remake of Super Mario Bros. 2), the character was given a high pitched female voice provided by Jen Taylor. However, in Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour, Birdo uses a muttering noise which has been used in subsequent games.\n\nBirdo has appeared in many episodes of Wipeout Canada: Party Edition.\n\nIn the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada quiz on Sporcle, she was ranked #4.\n\nWhen Birdo appeared in The Celebrity Apprentice 2, Birdo had a ring and Donald Trump telled her she was originally going to be fired in task 3 (along with Tom Green) by showing lousy leadership by sleeping in, but Wipeout rigs the votes and says yes.\n\nBirdo had a love interest on Lisa Rinna, Niki Taylor, NeNe Leakes, Marlee Matlin, Hope Dworaczyk, Dionne Warwick, Star Jones and La Toya Jackson, all from The Celebrity Apprentice 4 in team ASAP.\n\nBirdo was hired as Allen Ford's replacement during the Canada 2011 Census for Pembroke, Ontario. Birdo ranked 102 and then in the 2016 census, Birdo will be back in Ottawa.\n\nRelationships (Wipeout)\n\nHer relationship was Allen Ford in Canada's arm wrestling, Yoshi in some Mario games and some Wipeout Canada episodes, and Pearl Krabs in two episodes of Wipeout Canada.\n\nBirdo is mostly of an Eastern Ontario contestant, and Japanese. She was on all episodes of Wipeout Canada, and at the time the third episode aired, she turned 27, and is planning to live longer than female celebrities Jade Goody and Amy Winehouse, but Birdo lived longer than both of them.\n\nEpisode Gender Hometown Premiere Female Ottawa, Ontario The Bachelor Female Ottawa, Ontario Beauties vs. Geeks Female Ottawa, Ontario Athletes Edition Female Ottawa, Ontario Female Ottawa, Ontario\n\nDerby Dead Pool\n\nBirdo was on the Derby Dead Pool for 2011, 2012 and 2014. In 2014 Birdo has three jokers on her including the shocking Drop Dead Celebration. In 2014 she also said that Misao Okawa has a low chance of making it to the drop forty (because seriously there's no The Vydrolak) and Valerie Harper (from season 3) having a high chance. Birdo was off 2013 due to Yoshi being in the Drop Forty.\n\nShe said that \"The Good, the Bad and Cliff Richard\" almost had \"Vera Lynn, Jerry Lewis, Jiroemon Kimura, Chuck Berry and Christopher Lee because all five are at the bottom. Yoshi is better. He's a contestant. and There's Yoshi!\".\n\nShe is chosen by 26 teams in 2014, about like 20 or more of the number of teams needed for the Drop Forty.\n\nBirdo said in an interview that she can handle 2014's Derby Dead Pool having her off the drop forty. Birdo also said that she was chosen in a very long gap between Most Hits Ever and The 90's Are Dead, wanting that Puzlman's Passing Picks to pick Birdo. She said that she wanted Green Yoshi to appear once again, but Green Yoshi died in June 2013. She was happy with Toad's chosen DeathList 2014 person of hopefully Misao Okawa.\n\nBirdo was chosen by in 2014: (SERIOUSLY Guild of Master Reapers and Puzlman's Passing Picks NOT PICKING BIRDO?)\n\nAre You Still Dying, Darling?\n\nDave's Dead, Aye Dead Drunk\n\nDead And Don't Know It\n\nDead Ends\n\nWarning - Dying Can Be Hazardous To Your Health\n\nDiepod Shuffle\n\nDrop Dread Celebration\n\nFalling Off the Perch\n\nGray Panthers\n\nJoeRam\n\nLast Gasp Saloon\n\nLidders Late Lamentables\n\nLucky Pete\n\nMadonna's Hand of Bod\n\nMercarte\n\nMortem Omnibus\n\nMost Hits Ever\n\nThe 90's Are Dead\n\nThe Funeral Director 2014 (She was a director for the Yoshi Eggs)\n\nThe Good, The Bad and Cliff Richard (Last year was a theme team)\n\nThe Grey Horde\n\nThe Number of the Beast\n\nThe Old Ones Are the Pests\n\nWho Turned Out the Lights?\n\nYou Must Be Croaking!\n\nYou're Dead and You Know You Are\n\nBATC 1\n\nBirdo was one of the two captains on Unanimous, alongside Yoshi. Yoshi said \"They had some disappointing weeks and now improves further. With the shocking fire of Gilles Marini, this feels sad.\".\n\nIn week 4, she wanted to fire from either Adam Carolla, Vita Semerenko, Pamela Anderson or Bristol Palin, but Trump's decision said he decides to fire Kirstie Alley instead. They saved many low scores from Backbone in order to survive this week from losing the task and getting fired. In week 5, she plans to fire Ukrainian biathlete Vita Semerenko. However she wanted Justyna Kowalczyk to fall in the bottom 2.\n\nWeek 7 was very disappointing despite a whopping fire for three members of their team. Gilles Marini, Hélio Castroneves and Apolo Anton Ohno are surprisingly fired from BATC.\n\nAppearances\n\nSee: Birdo/appearances\n\nBirdo first appeared in the Family Computer Disk System video game Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic and its Western Nintendo Entertainment System conversion Super Mario Bros. 2 as a boss. The Super Mario Advance remake of Super Mario Bros. 2 features a large robotic version of Birdo called \"Robirdo\".[12] Since the character's appearance in Super Mario Bros. 2, Birdo has made several cameo appearances, including an early one teaching players the rules of the video game Wario's Woods. But to date, she hasn't entered any other Mario mainstream game.\n\nShe quitted the Drop Forty during 2012 due to not having Besse Cooper. She appeared in 2013, but not 2014. She left 2014 due to having Eli Wallach as the earliest birth, not Misao Okawa because Yoshi didn't like how the DDP picks in 2013 claim strong.\n\nBirdo has made frequent appearances in later Mario spinoff games, including Mario Tennis and Mario Golf, first appearing in the Mario sports games with the Nintendo 64 Mario Tennis. Though, Birdo was to be included in the Virtual Boy video game Mario's Tennis. Birdo also made her first appearance in the Mario Kart series in Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. In both of the above-mentioned titles, Yoshi acts as her partner. Birdo is an unlockable character in Mario Kart Wii. Birdo also has made appearances in the Mario Party series, first appearing in Mario Party 7. Birdo also makes appearances in multiple Mario role-playing games, including Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars as a minor boss in Valentina's castle and Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga as a decoy for Princess Peach. Recently, Birdo appeared in the Wii video game Captain Rainbow, which makes reference to the gender confusion. Birdo appeared in both Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl in the form of collectible items (known as trophies). Birdo has also appeared in both Mario Superstar Baseball for Nintendo Gamecube, Mario Super Sluggers, and Mario Strikers Charged for Nintendo Wii.\n\nIn other media\n\nBirdo was featured in the episode \"Episode 2: Jessica's Life of Peromance\" of The Wipeout Canada Movie series kidnapping Pembroke, Ontario's Nicky Sapera (as a judge) due to being near sighted, and believing that Evan Cundal, Bristol Palin and Allen Ford to be her son and she was fired in that episode. Birdo was featured in the episode \"Krusty Towers\" of SpongeBob SquarePants. She also went to the Pembroke location of Food Basics.\n\nShe was a helper for Unanimous on all of season 1 of Ben and Toad's Contest and she made it to the finale, placing her in first with Yoshi since June 12, 2013, and was voiced by Yuko Kaida, her current actress. Birdo had a crush on Taylor McKessie and Jessica Phillips. Birdo is a member of shuffle 3 of the All-Stars of Wipeout Canada. She was also on the Ben and Toad's Contest season 2 week 12, where Birdo was featured on the song by Jiroemon Kimura, Yoshi and Maria Filippov's song \"This is Arm Wrestling!\". She was mentioned by the Trumps twelve times.\n\nTrivia\n\nEvery time when a supercentenarian dies, she loses the round and Yoshi gets it.\n\nWhile week 4's fusion week is picking couples, she chose the one that died June 12, 2013.\n\nIn DDP 2014, Birdo was shockingly chosen to be your jokers for Drop Dead Celebration and Falling Off the Perch.\n\nKimura's passing gave Birdo and Yoshi the dances. On Derby Dead Pool, Yoshi and Birdo get fired in 2013, will sit out for 2014 and will return for 2015.\n\nBirdo and Yoshi liked how must of Unanimous (now Star Players) (not including Yoshi, Birdo, both Kimuras, and Cundal) performed to \"Ooh La La\".\n\nShe gave Esther Williams (who was on her team) the ring that she had on the first season of BATC only.\n\nCultural impact\n\nSince appearing in Super Mario Bros. 2, Birdo has received mostly positive reception. Birdo has appeared several times in promotional items, including figurines, plush toys, and other collectibles such as a chess set.[13][14] 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish described her as a favourite among fans.[15] IGN editor Lucas M. Thomas called her the \"transgender question mark,\" stating that Birdo was nearly as recognized as Yoshi in the Mario sports and racing games.[16] GamePro editor \"The Watcher\" praised the roster of Mario Superstar Baseball, commenting that while \"well-known\" characters like Princess Peach and Yoshi make appearances, so do \"lesser-known\" characters such as Birdo and Dry Bones.[17] Fellow GamePro editor \"The D-Pad Destroyer\" called Birdo \"everyone's favorite.\"[18]\n\nIn the book Life on the screen: identity in the age of the Internet, author Sherry Tuckle uses the pattern Birdo uses in boss battles as an example of something that, while complex, sustains the sense of a reassuring, rule-based world.[19] In Prima's Official Strategy Guide for Super Mario Advance, author Bryan Stratton describes Birdo as the hardest-working boss in video games due to her appearing more than a dozen times as a boss in Super Mario Bros. 2.[20] N-Sider editor Anthony JC commented that Birdo was a \"pushover\" compared to the other bosses in Super Mario Bros. 2.[21] GameDaily editor Chris Buffa listed her as one of the most unappreciated Nintendo characters, commenting that Bordo had appeared across web sites \"in less-than-flattering articles.\"[22] Official Nintendo Magazine listed her as one of the \"unsung heroes\" amongst the Mario series, stating that while \"Birdo does get more exposure than the other characters in this section (he's showed up in a few Mario spin-offs), but she/he's still not as popular as we'd like.\"[23] In a poll by Official Nintendo Magazine on its users, Birdo tied for eighth best female character on a Nintendo platform along with Midna and Kazooie. In their article about it, they express confusion at her being voted in.[24] UGO Networks listed Birdo as the 20th \"unsexiest sexy video game characters\", questioning whether or not the various sexual features, such as her \"O face\", were supposed to be arousing.[25] Birdo was ranked the ninth ugliest female video game character by ScrewAttack, who described her as resembling a \"retarded anteater\".[26] Games.net placed Birdo at #8 of their \"Top Ten Disturbingly Sexual Game Characters\" list.[27] GameDaily listed Birdo as one of the 10 worst Mario characters, stating that \"if Birdo wants to dress like a chick, all power to him. Eggs from the mouth, however... that's nasty.\"[28]\n\nBirdo also appeared in one of the McDonald's Happy Meal promotion of Mario toys which starred Mario, Donkey Kong, Yoshi and others. Wired editor Chris Kohler described her as well as other characters from Captain Rainbow as \"forgettable.\"[29] IGN editor John Tanaka found Birdo to be one of the more enjoyable guest characters in Captain Rainbow, associating his enjoyment with developer Skip's plot, which involves crossdressing and toilet humour.[8] In an article on MTV multiplayer discussing the best birds in video games, Birdo tied for second place with the chickens from Chicken Run. Tofuburger of the web site I Can Haz Cheezburger listed her as his favourite bird, calling Birdo the first transgender video game character and humorously praising her for her fearlessness about doing whatever she wants.[30] MTV Multiplayer editor Jason Cipriano questioned why Birdo and fellow Super Mario Bros. 2 enemy Shy Guy have been included in so many spin-off titles in the Mario series, commenting that they both \"kinda suck\", but enemies such as Wart and Mouser were not.[31]\n\n\"Birdo\", the first track of Horse the Band's album The Mechanical Hand, heavily references the character.[32]\n\nGender\n\nBirdo has been the subject of discussion relating to her gender issues. Gamasutra editor Simon Carless described Birdo as \"infamously gender-confused.\"[33] Birdo was praised by transsexual video game designer Jennifer Reitz. It is speculated by Wired editor Chris Kohler that the gender issue was retconned to make her female, while Reitz suggests that she received a sex change operation.[2][34] In the book Vintage Games: An Insider Look at the History of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the Most Influential Games of All Time, the authors describe Birdo as the most notable character in Super Mario Bros. 2 due to being the first transsexual character in video games.[35] GamesRadar editor Chris Antista has discussed Birdo in several articles. He listed Birdo #1. in his top seven \"That's a Dude?!\" game characters. He cited her bow, mascara, her being pink, and her being able to lay eggs as the identifying features of Birdo being female, while using the manual insert as the sole evidence to her being male.[36] In the article \"10 things you didn't know about Super Mario Bros 2,\" Antista listed Birdo's gender confusion, stating that the revelation was similar to when \"lead singer of Judas Priest came out to a legion homophobic metalheads dressed to the nines in skin tight leather left wondering if their dicks will fall off.\"[37] He also picked her as his first gaming crush, commenting that he worried that he would be outed once he read about her gender confusion in the manual.[38]\n\nIn his article \"Too Gay for the U.S.A.,\" editor Andrew Webster used the history of Birdo in the lead-in to his article, commenting on how Nintendo tried to hide Birdo's gender confusion, and how \"He's just one of a long line of Japanese videogame characters forced to hide their true sexual identity\".[39] GamesRadar UK listed Birdo as one of \"gaming's most repelling anti-babes,\" describing her as a \"pink, egg blowing, transvestite dinosaur with a mouth like a burst fire hose,\" thereby describing her as \"terrifying.\"[40] Morgan Webb of X-Play created a video titled \"Birdo WTF\", commenting that everyone initially thought of Birdo as a \"cute little dinosaur\". She also describes her as a very feminine male character if she really is a transsexual.[41] Nintendo Power listed Birdo as one of three weirdos, citing her change from being male to being a love interest for Yoshi. They described her gender as one of life's biggest questions, commenting on how she shoots eggs out of her mouth as another oddity.[42] IGN editor Lucas M. Thomas commented in his article about Yoshi that Birdo \"almost worthy of a whole other article,\" stating that she is \"the most gender-confused character in the history of Nintendo.\" He commented on the relationship Yoshi and Birdo formed in Mario Tennis, stating that \"Yoshi is supposedly a male, but lays eggs like a female. Birdo is supposedly a female, but was originally called a male. And now the two of them are a romantic couple? They were both sexually chaotic as individuals -- this new pairing just made your head hurt thinking about it.\"[43]\n\nEpisodes\n\nThe males of Episodes 7 and 9 has to be announced by Birdo.\n\nMatch of Beauties vs Geeks (Crystal Grierson and Ron Langton)\n\nAthletes Edition (Halley Van Muyen and Nicky Sapera), but wrong home\n\nEast vs West (Caroline Dalpe)\n\nChocolate Thunder (Pearl Krabs, Abigail Santos, Kelsi Nielsen, Jason Cross)\n\nHeroes Edition (Evan Cundal, who died in 2013)\n\nFood Fight (Lindsay Goldman and Dave Shugar)\n\nTight and Bright (same contestant as Chocolate Thunder, Pearl Krabs)\n\nThe Wipey Awards (Nicky Sapera)\n\nPhone Number: (613-203-1359 (Wipeout Canada episodes but some of them) but it's all about Allen)\n\nYoshi (613-???-0578) - Episodes 1 to 3\n\nPhone Number (Chocolate Thunder) : (613-281-2468) in Bet on It, when Birdo does not have a ring.\n\nBirdo also appeared in all episodes.\n\nSongs of Contestants\n\nBet on It (Reprise) - Chocolate Thunder\n\nAll for One - Chocolate Thunder and Beauties vs Geeks\n\nElementary School Musical\n\nRoar - Shakira ft Yoshi & Birdo\n\nGallery\n\nQuotes\n\n\"Play a film\"!\n\n\"November 29, 1896?\"\n\n\"We lost?

They had met at the 2013 MAVTV 500 for the trophy; where Germany and Argentina played; and Sceptile won the title over Birdo by the virtue of Argentina finishing 5th and Birdo finishing 6th.\n\nThe two met again in round 2 of the 2016 Angie's List Grand Prix of Indianapolis qualifying; with Sceptile beating Birdo by the lap time and advancing to the Firestone Fast Six.\n\nYoshi\n\nIn All-Star Brawl (Beauties) when Abigail Santos was shown with Kelsi, not Kelsi's sidekick, Birdo said \"Wipeout Canada is much more boring\". On the team \"First You're Born, Life is Hard, Then You Die\", Yoshi was there and had a joker of him and the night when they were dancing, they earned a shocking five. At the night of week 1 men, Birdo had a night where contestants are having her and Yoshi represent the men's team. They were both on the same team, and Donald Trump picked them because they have more help than Toad and Toadette on the men's team.\n\nIn week 1 of Ben and Toad's Contest, in season 1, they had both rings belonging to them, and wants a Priscilla Presley death date in 2013.

They are tied 1-1 on head to head. None of their meetings came during the IndyCar series part of the show. Birdo and Yoshi did not even meet at the 2015 Milwaukee IndyFest qualifying; that qualifying for the race was Croatia's first pole in their team history and a Germany failure to qualify. After the announcement of Auto Club Speedway not returning, Birdo and Yoshi sadly cried with the rest of the BATC season 1 cast.\n\nYoshi and Birdo will meet together at the Fictional BATC Family Feud episode against Romania on July 10, 2016; to avenge their 2013 Ribeirao Preto loss against them.\n\nTroy Bolton\n\nWhen Sharpay edits Wikipedia on the Olesya Rulin as Kelsi Nielsen's place page in Wipeout Canada, it is vandalism.\n\nKelsi Nielsen\n\nIn \"Chocolate Thunder\", Allen Ford was with Birdo in a relationship and then it changed to Kelsi Nielsen in arm wrestling.\n\nIn \"Wheel of Fortune\" Birdo's place was in the Capitals Week.\n\nBrandolynn Bentley\n\nBirdo on the course said it is much more boring for Brandolynn Bentley than Baby Daisy.\n\nAllen Ford\n\nWhen the course say \"Next is national arm wrestling champ Allen Ford but Kelsi said Kelsi 'The Piano Player' Nielsen and then it is not Allen 'The Hit Man' Ford from Pembroke, ON but Petawawa, ON\", Birdo said he is currently not from Pembroke but from Petawawa and Kelsi said on her cell phone currently from Pembroke.\n\nWhen Birdo, Kelsi and Abigail sing You are the Music in Me (Chocolate Thunder), others come later than usual. In \"Chocolate Thunder\", Birdo says \"but no buts\" about Pembroke.\n\nIn \"The Wipeys\", Birdo is in a relationship with him but in prom.\n\nIn \"Wheel of Fortune\", he and Kelsi appear as unlockables.\n\nAt Arm Melter 16, Ford and Birdo had to switch protect managers at the same time. Pembroke (which was by Ford) was John Keuhl and Birdo's choice was Eric Roussin. They both said \"This should be fun!\".\n\nIn week 12 of Ben and Toad's Contest in season 2, he was seen with her bow in top. He stole that from formers winners Jiroemon Kimura/Yoshi & Maria Filippov, the winners of season 1, but they had to change the name again to Yoshi. (Toad went there June 12, 2013)\n\nAllen Ford and Birdo have not met in qualifying for an IndyCar race before in a road or street course. Birdo leads Ford in the head to head 3-1 in the 2016 IndyCar series; with Ford's first shock win over Birdo at St. Pete after Power missed the race. Additionally the two decided to meet together in the Celebrity Family Feud episode IndyCar vs. Swimsuit Models.\n\nFroslass\n\nBirdo had met the Ice/Ghost type Froslass since the first IndyCar Series season since Froslass' existence. Froslass and Birdo had only won two races together, at the 2013 Firestone 600 and the 2014 Dual in Detroit Race 2. They were part of Germany's side that finished in the IndyCar standings; 2nd in 2013 and 2014 and 5th in 2015.\n\nBirdo was part of Froslass' team that won the pole at 2016 St. Petersburg, and eventually withdrew from the race.\n\nHélio Castroneves\n\nBirdo met Hélio Castroneves for the first time in Ben and Toad's Contest season 1. Neither of them qualified for the last 20.\n\nAdditionally, both of them were part of the Germany side that failed to qualify for the 2015 Milwaukee IndyFest.
