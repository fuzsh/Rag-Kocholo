Maksim and Peta attended Val's fashion show for his clothing line with former Dancing With the Stars troupe member Nicole Volynet, VALENTINNICOLE, which showed during New York Fashion Week.\n\nThe two weren't shy about showing lots of PDA at the event, Maksim sweetly kissing his fiancee on the cheek.\n\nWATCH: Peta Murgatroyd Gets Real About Her Post-Baby Bod, Enjoys 'First Date Night of 2017' With Maksim Chmerkovskiy\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe 37-year-old pro dancer was also snapped looking adoringly at Peta.\n\nGetty Images\n\nClearly, Maks appears to be more smitten with 30-year-old Peta than ever.\n\n\"Hottest chick in the spot!\" he Instagrammed alongside a pic of Peta at the show. \"That line next to the corner of the lip is my absolute favorite... #queen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Peta shared her own photo of the attractive couple, calling their outing \"Parents night out.\"\n\nThe two have found some alone time to spend together apart from son Shai in NYC. Earlier this week, Peta shared a makeup-free Instagram photo of her and her man taking a car ride. \"Typical, he's always on the phone while I'm trying to take a selfie #manhattanday away from #babychmerkovskiy,\" she joked.\n\nThough both Maks and Peta are definitely loving their new role in life. Last week, Maks Instagrammed a sweet video of Peta checking on their son.\n\n\"Never heard 'Wait, I'm checking on my baby,' right before a dance, but something about @petamurgatroyd saying it makes me very happy,\" he wrote.\n\nWATCH: Maksim Chmerkovskiy Reflects on Fatherhood -- 'I'm the Happiest Person That's Ever Lived'\n\nPeta gave birth to their first child together on Jan. 4. Last month, Val said being a father has \"changed\" his brother during an appearance on Good Morning America.\n\n\"I'm trying to be the best uncle I can be,\" Val added. \"I want to spoil him. I don't think he really understands much right now. But as soon as he's able to comprehend the love that he has around him, I think he's going to be a very spoiled young man.\"\n\nWatch below:\n\nRelated Articles"
