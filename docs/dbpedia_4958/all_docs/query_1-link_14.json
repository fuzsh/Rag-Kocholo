        "text": "One day after announcing that he was planning to leave Ukraine amid the ongoing Russian invasion, Maksim Chmerkovskiy confirmed to his Instagram followers that he had managed to make it aboard a train headed for Poland.\n\nThe Dancing With the Stars pro, who has been keeping fans abreast of the situation in Kyiv via his daily video updates, posted a paragraph to his Instagram Stories on Tuesday confirming that he is safe, albeit very uncomfortable. “I made it on the train. We’re heading to Warsaw (hopefully). Train to Lviv was not an option,” he began. “The situation at the train station is insane. AT first it feels manageable, but it gets A LOT worse when it comes time to actually board the train. Long story but all I can say now is that I’m a big man with nothing but a backpack it’s TRAUMATIZING. Currently I’m in a cabin with 4 adults and 7 kids (ages 2–11) which usually is only occupied by maximum of 3 people. There’s usually up to 30 people in this particular wagon. We were told we have to fit 135. Walkways are packed. People everywhere. It’s sweaty and claustrophobic.”\n\nBut Chmerkovskiy added that while his situation may but unpleasant, “What finally broke me is when I was watching an eight-ish year old boy, hysterically crying and not wanting to let go of his father. Verbatim: ‘if you stay I want to stay too because if they kill you I won’t be able to help.’” About 30 mins from the border of Poland, the dancer posted another video letting people know that they had stopped the train so they could change its wheels and were letting people walk around and get some fresh air. He also showed the train and the huge crowd of people waiting outside to get back on. And just a few hours ago, Chmerkovskiy confirmed that they have all arrived safely in Poland after 31 hours without sleep.\n\nThis trip comes just a day after Chmerkovskiy revealed that he was arrested by the police, which prompted him to decide to try and get out of the country for good. “That was probably the least traumatizing moment in this whole thing as far as Ukraine is concerned, but for me, it was just a reality check,” he explained. “I’m going to try and make my way out. I’m going to start making my way towards the border. I have options. Just a little nervous but I think it’s going to be alright. I know it’s going to be okay.”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair"
