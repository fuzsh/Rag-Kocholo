        "text": "Hollywood BFF's J.Lo and Leah Remini took it to the streets of West Hollywood on Wednesday as the pals were seen shopping at Fred Segal for some fashionable clothes and hats.\n\nThe 45-year-old sexy singer dressed for comfort in a maxi dress, a top bun and hoop earrings. On the other hand, her buddy Leah Remini dressed in a chic pencil dress that accentuated her curvy figure.\n\nThe 'King of Queens' star and J.Lo have been friends a long time and reportedly J.Lo helped her through her split from Scientology in 2013.\n\nJ.Lo recently shared a picture of herself with her bestie on Instagram and captioned it, \"West Coast we baaaack!! #goinbacktocali #backincali #weliveincali #westillNYgirlsthough\".\n\nRumors about J.Lo and DWTS dancer Maksim Chmerkovskiy are still emerging and reportly the couple is keeping the relationship on the D.L. But the two have been spotted getting cozy numerous times in the public eye so I guess its too difficult to deny that the two are an item for real.\n\nAnyway, lets not deviate from the topic. Check out more pictures of J.Lo shopping with her BFF.\n\nI like her lazy day look! She looks amazing doesn't she?\n\nI've been waiting for this for so so long and the official trailer of the film Fifty Shades of Grey is finally out.\n\nThis is probably one of the most awaited movie of the year. The film is an adaptation of the best selling novel of the same name by E.L James. (and I thank my stars I read it. Too dramatic? I'm sorry! :D)\n\nThe movie stars Dakota Johnson as Ana Steele and Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey. I like this little teaser of the film which depicts the first scene from the novel which is the first meeting between Ana Steele and Christian Grey. Later in the trailer, you'll see a series of steamy scenes which you'll be able to relate to IF you've read the novel.\n\nOn doing all kinds of sex scenes with Jamie Dornan, the actress said, \"I don't have any problem doing anything. The secret is I have no shame\". I don't know what to say about that except, good for her, I guess!\n\nTo cut it short, I'm super excited to watch this movie which is set to release next year February on Valentine's Day.\n\nAre you as excited as I am to watch Fifty Shades of Grey?\n\nI understand this subject is not really relevant to my blog but I have been reading news about the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash everyday since it happened and my heart melts every time I read the news updates.\n\nThis is the second Malaysian Airlines disaster since the disappearance of MH370 on 8th March 2014 which was en route from Beijing from Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe international airline took off from Amsterdam and was scheduled to land in Kuala Lumpur when the unfortunate event occurred. According to news updates, the flight was shot by Buk surface-to-air missile and crashed down somewhere near a village Hrabove in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine.\n\nIt is still a mystery weather the flight was shot down by the Ukrainian government, the pro-Russian separatists or it was an external terrorist attack. There are so many news revolving around this subject. But I'm stuck on just one thing; the precious lives that were destroyed in the attack. There were a total of 283 passengers in the flight which included 15 crew members. Can you imagine, NOT even a single survivor? This is sad! What was there fault?\n\nMy heart goes out to the families of all who lost their lives in this incident. May they rest in peace... ♥ †\n\nThe 'Rich Girl' singer, Gwen Stefani was spotted Wednesday looking absolutely fabulous as she visited her acupuncture clinic in the Koreatown, Los Angeles.\n\nThe 44-Year-Old hot mama wore a red sheer top that revealed her black bra, paired with blue denims, red peep-toe boots and wore her signature scarlet shade of lipstick which made her look all the more sexy.\n\nThe blonde diva looked so fit and in shape that she we almost forgot that she recently gave birth to her third child Apollo.\n\nStefani will replace singer Christina Aguilera in the seventh season of ‘The Voice’ while Aguilera would be off on her maternity break. She will join Pharrell Williams, along with returning regulars Adam Levine and Blake Shelton in the upcoming season. The show is scheduled to premiere in September.\n\nShe looks unbelievably amazing\n\nIt’s hard to forget how sexy Jennifer Anistonlooked in 2011 black comedy 'Horrible Bosses'. But that’s not it! The seductress orthodontist is back two and half years later with a sexier appearance. In the first installation of the movie, Aniston played Julia Harris who is a dentist and a boss to Dale Arbus (Charlie Day) who is sexually harassed by her. The new trailer for the sequel shows Jennifer Aniston flirting her way with Jason Bateman this time.\n\nIt has been revealed that Jennifer Aniston will play Dale’s ex-employer and the major focus will be on her dealing with sex addiction.\n\nThe production company, New Line Cinema released a teaser for the long awaited sequel and it is uh-mazing!\n\nPhoto via siblingcinema.com\n\nThe 1:40 minutes teaser shows the gang - Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis in some kind of trouble which according to the trailer looks bigger than what they did in the prequel. In one segment of the trailer the trio is seen kidnapping Chris Pine which, as expected will go horribly wrong.\n\nThe exciting trailer is accompanied with the famous soundtrack ‘Turn Down for What’ by DJ Snake & Lil Jon.\n\nThe film is directed by Sean Anders and slated to release November this year.\n\nLet’s just hope this sequel won't end up like ‘The Hangover’ series. I am so excited to watch this movie!\n\nIn the sequel, partners in crime Nick, Kurt and Dale quit their jobs and start up a new business but in order to make it a success they need to jump through hoops. Other actors in the movie include Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx and Chris Pine.\n\nCountry singer Taylor Swift revealed her sexy legs in SoHo Tuesday as she headed into a restaurant in the Lower Manhattan region.\n\nTaylor Swift can be a little annoying sometimes (no offense) but the girl knows how to dress and what cute outfits she has. The singer was spotted wearing this adorable floral playsuit as she headed to a restaurant in SoHo.\n\nThe 24-Year-Old paired her body hugging outfit with stylish mustard suede pumps, a classy vintage handbag and wore her signature red lipstick.\n\nPlaysuits are great for summers if you have the legs to pull it off and they come in various styles. Plus the floral print makes it even better. There are variety of options on Amazon for as less as $55. Check out some of the most fashionable styles of floral playsuits if you are looking for one."
