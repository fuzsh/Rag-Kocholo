        "text": "Professional dancers Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd are parents of two! Maksim, who goes by Maks, announced the arrival of the couple’s second baby, born on Father’s Day. “Happy Father’s Day to me!”\n\nMaks shared the news of the couple’s baby on his Instagram page with a photo of him holding his newborn baby. He blurred out the face of his little one in the image but the doting father can be seen gazing lovingly at his newborn. The day before, Maks revealed the couple were at the hospital prepared to welcome a baby boy. “It’s go time! [Peta] is the fantastic unicorn that she is and I can’t wait for another one of her best creations! She is an absolutely amazing boy mom and about to birth another lucky man into this world.” The Dancing with the Stars pros have not yet revealed the name of their second son.\n\nThe couple’s newborn joins the family with their son Shai Aleksander, who was born in January 2017. Since welcoming Shai, the couple struggled to conceive again. Peta suffered three miscarriage while the couple faced infertility. They also tried to conceive through in-virto fertilization (IVF), however, the dancer revealed that this pregnancy happened “all natural.”\n\nWhen Peta revealed her pregnancy in January, she thanked her fans for their support over the years. “I want to thank ALL OF YOU who’ve been on this fertility journey with me from the beginning. It feels like I’m sharing this news with my extended family. Thank you for sharing your stories and tips to get me through my IVF cycle and thank you for the plethora of encouraging comments and DM’s …I read them all.”\n\nCongraulations to Maks and Peta on welcoming their second son! We look forward to learning the name they’ve chosen for their new baby."
