        "text": "I think there’s a great many of us who would dearly love to be Glee star Matthew Morrison’s “man crush.”\n\nBut the lucky guy with that distinction is Justin Timberlake.\n\n“The guy can do it all,” Matt says in the People.com “One Question” video feature that asked him and other male celebrities who they’d like to have a bro-mance with. I’m kind of surprised that there was not one mention off Brad Pitt who seems to have been every straight guy’s man crush for nearly two decades now.\n\nMatt’s Glee co-star Mark Salling picked Morrison but not so Cory Monteith who Matt was sweet enough to give a little peck to during an Entertainment Weekly cover shoot.\n\nSo who’s Cory’s man crush?\n\n“It would definitely be Anderson Cooper,” he said. “He’s a smart man and that makes a man attractive.”\n\nWell Cory, that and that silver hair, gorgeous blue eyes and bulging biceps. Yeah, the brains are kinda hot too.\n\nHere are some of the other man crushes going on in Hollywood:\n\nNick Lachey: “My man crush is David Beckham.”\n\nJohn Legend: “I say George Clooney. He’s the man. He’s cool.”\n\nMaksim Chmerkovskiy: “Michael Buble for some reason. He just has that vibrant personality that makes you just want to be friends with him. I just want to call him Bubbles.”\n\nJesse Metcalf: “David Duchovny.” Then he looks in the camera and, addressing Duchovny asks: “Can I be your friend?”\n\nHunter Parish: “Chris Martin. Now that is quite the man.”\n\nLL Cool J: “I don’t have a problen with people who have man crushes. I personally don’t have one.”"
