        "text": "While he sets hearts a-flutter with his dance moves on ABC’s most popular reality show, Maksim Chmerkovskiy is also making moves in the real estate market.\n\nOne of the winningest professional dancers in “Dancing With The Stars” history, Maks is renting his Fort Lee, NJ, home for $18,000 a month. Gathering up that kind of monthly payment might require a bit of a hustle, but before you go twirling off in a tango, let’s take a look at what you’ll waltz away with.\n\nFor starters, the Fort Lee location can’t be beat. Offering five bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms, the 5,200-square-foot Colonial home is right across the Hudson River from New York City.\n\nFully furnished and ready to host your next big dance, the home was built in 2000, and everything about it exudes a feeling of place and comfort: The stone facade and solid wood doors are welcomingly elegant—and instantly inviting.\n\nThe chef-grade kitchen is stocked with old-school charm and the full complement of high-end stainless steel appliances. There are warm and delightful white cabinets, a marble-topped center island and a massive gas range outfitted with a commercial range hood and an artisan-tiled backsplash.\n\nThe home has a large finished basement, radiant heat in the floors (a big bonus during the winter on the East Coast), hardwood floors, soaring cathedral ceilings, marble baths and everything else you need to live like the stars.\n\nPresented by Polina Posner of Prominent Properties, this home is ready for you to two-step right on in.\n\nChmerkovskiy originally hails from Ukraine, and he is one of the creators of “Dance Team USA,” a non-profit organization that supports and trains young people for a future in dancing. In 14 seasons on the ABC show, Maks has five Top 3 finishes—including his first title in Spring 2014 with celebrity partner and Olympic ice dancing gold medalist Meryl Davis."
