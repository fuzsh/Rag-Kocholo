        "text": "On Valentine's Day 2023, pro dancer Britt Stewart and her season 31 partner, CODA star Daniel Durant, both took to Instagram to reveal their relationship. \"My Valentine,\" Daniel captioned this adorable photo of the couple. Britt, on the other hand, simply captioned a video of her new boo with a red heart emoji. We are so here for this! As of October 2023, their relationship is still going strong, with Daniel seen supporting Britt amid the latest season of DWTS.\n\nThe two professional dancers dated briefly in 2015 before going their separate ways. But after rekindling their romance in 2017, Val and Jenna tied the knot in April 2019. They welcomed their first child together, a baby boy named Rome, in January 2023. Congrats, you two!\n\nNikki Bella confirmed her relationship with her former professional dance partner, Artem Chigvintsev, in 2019. The couple met when they were paired together during season 25 in 2017 and are still going strong. They welcomed their adorable son, Matteo, in 2020, and tied the knot in August 2022.\n\nThe Bachelorette star and pro dancer lit up the dance floor in season 28, with their passionate dances taking them all the way to first place. Hannah and Alan continued to spark romance rumors for a short time even after the show wrapped, but both have since denied ever dating. They reunited for an Instagram Live chat in 2020, with Hannah saying they are \"still great friends.\"\n\nWhen Mario Lopez and professional dancer Karina Smirnoff were partnered together for season 3 of the show, the couple—and the audience—felt an attraction almost instantly. The pair dated for a little over two years before splitting in 2008.\n\nBoth Peta Murgatroyd and Maksim Chmerkovskiy have had their share of showmances during their time as professional dancers on the show. But in 2014, the two decided to partner up together—and got engaged the following year. The lovebirds welcomed their son, Shai Aleksander, in January 2017, before marrying a few months later in July. After sharing a difficult fertility journey with their followers, they welcomed their second child together in 2023. Yay!\n\nThe Pussycat Dolls singer and dancing pro were crowned the winners of season 10. As they celebrated their victory, people began to wonder if their chemistry extended off the dance floor. After the season ended, they were seen together, but nothing was ever confirmed.\n\nActor Brian Austin Green and pro dancer Sharna Burgess gave the world a peek into their relationship when they danced together in season 30, but unfortunately only placed 13th. They welcomed their first child, Zane Walker Green, in June 2022, and announced their engagement in September 2023.\n\nWhen the Shark Tank investor partnered up with professional dancer Kym Johnson, it was love at first waltz. The couple sparked romance rumors right from the start of the season (after being seen getting cozy at the premiere afterparty) and their relationship continued after the season was over. They tied the knot in 2016 and welcomed twins two years later.\n\nThe model (Alexis) and professional dancer (Alan) drove fans wild when they shared a lingering kiss on air while competing on season 25. They later confirmed that they were dating. But their romance was short-lived: Alexis announced their split on Instagram in December 2018, just a few months later.\n\nEven though it was Val's brother, Maksim, who was partnered with model Amber Rose during season 22, Val was the one she hit it off with off the dance floor. The pair dated for five months before calling it quits.\n\nThe couple proved to be the best on the dance floor, taking home the Mirrorball Trophy in season 2. As far as off the dance floor? The couple maintains that their relationship was strictly platonic, with Lachey's rep telling Us Weekly the rumors were \"completely false\" that the two had an affair.\n\nThe dance partners made headlines during season 10, not only for their performances, but for their apparent chemistry outside of the ballroom. However, as you've probably already learned with DWTS fandom, sometimes it really is just a rumor.\n\nTogether, Gleb Savchenko and Elena Samodanova were an international Dancing with the Stars power couple, as Gleb competes in the U.S. series and Elena has appeared on both the Australian and Russian counterparts. Sadly, the pair announced they were divorcing after 14 years of marriage in 2020. They share two daughters together.\n\nAs Chrishell and Gleb were going through separations—and eventual divorces—with their significant others, they leaned on each other during season 29. The Selling Sunset star and her pro partner \"definitely had a flirty relationship\" while on the show, an insider told Us Weekly. However, they never entered a serious relationship, with their spark seemingly fading after the show ended. The two still occasionally interact through Instagram, so it seems they remained friends.\n\nWhile things didn't seem to work out with Gleb, Chrishell found herself another DWTS man to date. She and pro Keo had a nearly three-month fling that ended in major drama. Shortly after their breakup in early 2021, she posted about hearing rumors that \"made me question if [Keo] could even order a coffee without lying.\" Yikes!\n\nWhen and where would be the ultimate place for two professional dancers to get engaged? A live taping of Dancing with the Stars, of course. After dating for five years, Sasha asked Emma to marry him on the dance floor and the whole cast came out to celebrate when she said \"Yes!\" The two married in 2018, but after four years of marriage, their rumored separation was confirmed by People.\n\nHayley joined the DWTS troupe in season 21, met Derek Hough (another pro dancer on the show at the time), and the two hit it off. The pair have been together since 2015, got engaged in June 2022, and tied the knot in August 2023.\n\nThe pair, who were matched up for season 18, apparently went on a date before the premiere, but nothing ever came of it. Throughout the season, both partners kept the record straight on their friendship, with James telling People that he was flattered by the rumors, \"but really, we're just here just to dance.\"\n\nThe former Cheetah Girl showed everyone she could strut like she meant it on season 5 of Dancing with the Stars—including her dance pro, Mark Ballas. The couple began dating during the competition, but ended things shortly after the show wrapped."
