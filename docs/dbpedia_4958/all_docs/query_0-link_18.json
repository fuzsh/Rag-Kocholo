        "text": "By Debra Stroiney, Fred Astaire dance instructor and Franchise Compliance administrator for Fred Astaire Corporate\n\nDancing With The Stars - Week 1\n\nAs this being my first blog for Dancing With The Stars, this may seem a little vague and varied on topics. The first week is overwhelming with the 3 nights, 2 dances and 2 contestants being voted off. Everyone had to learn their steps, how to dance, how to perform and how to wear ballroom dancing shoes and costumes! What we want to see is who picked up the steps the best, which one has a great stage presence, who may get by on votes alone?\n\nSo what level would the contestants be at if they started at a Fred Astaire studio with an introductory offer? If they danced 4 hours a day for 6 weeks that would be 24 one-hour lessons; on average this would put the student at the end of Social Foundation, and early Bronze level. Wow! Can you imagine your instructor asking you to be in a dance competition on national TV at the Social Foundation or Bronze level!\n\nEver since the first season, I do view the male contestants on the show differently. I think of the male students in our studios when they do their first competition. The male contestant must develop their leading skills, have good posture while also trying to remember the routine, clean footwork and having a presence out on the floor. The female contestant must also do many of these things but they do not have to worry about leading as much. They have a strong male lead to put them in the right spot, to highlight them in the correct character, and yes they still have to do it well but there is something about it that doesn’t seem as difficult as it is for the men.\n\nAnd, of course, this week on the show 2 male contestants were eliminated. In their circumstances, I feel that Ted did well in his Fox Trot when you consider that he had to do feather steps, telemarks and pivots in his routine! Fox Trot can be one of the hardest international dances to learn. But at Fred Astaire we start by teaching the Fox Trot because it is an opportunity for us to get the students to do what they already know…walking. I know that Dancing With The Stars is a competition and you have to do competitive moves to feel that you have a chance, but what happened to teaching some simpler moves, doing some easy tricks and teaching the stage presence, the posture, and the ability to go out there and present yourself well? I feel that some of the weaker dancers on the show may hear better comments from the judges if they were to start this way. Regardless of how they did perform they also have to get the votes… So when you pair a low mark with the fact that they haven’t won over the viewing audience and are not a well known star, then we have eliminations. This is also what can be said happened to Jeff Ross. He went out there with a great attitude but there were others that got higher marks and I have never heard of him before making it hard for him to last very long on the show.\n\nI feel that this season of Dancing With The Stars could be very exciting. On the first night I felt like there were many great performances and dancers. I could see the contestants that had previous training versus the ones who have not. Not everyone always sees this as fair but this is how it works in any ballroom dancing competition. There will always be the ones that have had more experience in one way or another. There will always be the ones that learn faster than others. There will always be ones that will get better marks for unknown reasons. But unlike ballroom dancing competitions, audience votes count! So if you see someone who you think did great but got low marks, vote for them! Trust me - it’s a great feeling that the audience loves you even if the judges don’t!\n\nBy Jackie Josephs, professional dancer and Fred Astaire Studio owner\n\nAnother season of \"Dancing with the Stars\" is upon us!!!! With a mix of so many different personalities and talent it's sure to be an amazing 12 weeks of dancing, drama, and excitement!!\n\nWeek 1-Day 1\n\nDances: Foxtrot/Cha Cha\n\nCody and Julianne(Cha Cha): These two are perfect for each other! Young, fresh and full of energy! As soon as they walked out onto the floor they looked amazing, their costumes were fabulous and his performance was a great way to start the show off! His technique was pretty good for his first time doing a rhythm dance, lines were strong and his timing was excellent. One area that he can improve on is his posture just a little bit. Sometimes his shoulders go up, which affects his lead. I also enjoyed the choreography. It was clean, easy and showed off his strong points. As for his performance, I thought that he had great feeling in this dance and really presented himself well by opening up his chest and presenting Julianne well by letting her do her thing. Overall he did a great job for his first dance and in my opinion he deserved a much better score than an 18!\n\nSusan and Tony(Cha-Cha): Well, first of all it's so exciting that our own FADS man made it back yet again for another season and got paired up with the beautiful and sophisticated Susan Lucci. As she walked onto the floor she looked beautiful in her sexy red dress; however, as the music began, the routine was a little rough on the eyes. Her leg action was not smooth and she got off time in a few areas. As the judges stated, she does look quite frail and safe. I think the smooth dances will be her stronger point. On the plus side, her constant smile during the routine was very pleasant and the choreography was well suited for her ability and age. I would like to see her open up more in the next rhythm dance that she does and get a little riskier.\n\nWarren and Kym(Cha Cha): I love this guy!!! He is such a big ball of fun and rhythm!! His sense of style and his natural ability of timing shined through this routine from start to finish. His confidence on the floor was fantastic and his \"freestyling\" was so enjoyable to watch. You could tell he was having so much fun the entire time. He is definitely the Emmitt Smith of Season 7. The only thing that he has to be more aware of is his foot action. His feet are so large that sometimes they\"plop\" onto the floor instead of keeping pressure into the floor. I feel that Kym did a great job with the choreography and let him show off his own moves as well as keeping the basic elements of the Cha Cha. I cannot wait to see more of him and see him get more and more comfortable with his size on the dance floor!\n\nCloris and Corky(Foxtrot): I'm not going to lie, I didn't know what to expect when she walked onto the floor; however, I was pleasantly surprised. Even though she is 82, she has proven that ballroom dancing is for all ages. She had a great fluid motion throughout the dance and Corky did a great job without overdoing it with her but at the same time challenging her. She had great pivots which was quite unexpected and she had a great sense of the sexiness and sass of the Foxtrot. My opinion is that for her to get out there and dance as well as she did that the judges could have been a little easier on her. Of course her movement and technique were not the best but I feel she still did an excellent job.\n\nToni and Alec (Cha Cha): First of all, I have to give props to Toni for getting out there and dancing with her heart condition - that's an achievement in itself. Her Cha Cha was very sexy and sultry and her footwork was pretty good throughout the majority of the routine. The area that bothered me the most was her posture. She kept her head up but her shoulders were too high, which made her frame look weak. The only thing that bothered me was that it was choppy, the transitions were not fluid and she \"hopped\" in some areas instead of staying grounded. Her score for me was a little too high.\n\nMax and Misty (Foxtrot): Legs, Legs, Legs!!!! She is sooo tall that Max definitely has his hands full with her to get them sexy and pretty and not too sporty looking; however, her stature demands attention. As soon as she walked onto the floor you could tell she was a true competitor and had her \"game face\" ready. I didn't really know if it was going to be fluid or not because she is so tall; however, she was great. Her frame was very good and she kept her shoulders down for the most part, which again is very difficult with no prior training. Her lines were beautiful, she definitely used her wing span to her advantage and her musicality was right on key. Overall I loved how graceful she looked and her enthusiasm is going to take her very far!\n\nKim and Mark (Foxtrot): Being the past winner of DWTS, Mark is dealing with a whole different level of talent with Kim. She is such a beautiful girl and she looked gorgeous in her dress. Her presence on the floor was pleasant and safe and her frame stayed pretty strong. However, her movement was not big enough in the basics and her face never changed throughout the entire routine, quite boring. The routine matched the musical hits well and her awareness of that was good in some areas; however, overall, she has to open up out of her shy shell and become more risky and demanding on the dance floor. With a partner like Mark, she's going to need to step up so he doesn't look like he is over dancing her.\n\nJeff and Edyta (Cha Cha): Well at least he's funny right?? I felt so bad for him because you can tell he tries so hard and put everything he had into with his broken eye and all but he has a lot of areas that he has to improve on if he's going to stay in this competition. His posture was not good and his footwork wasn't either. On the up side, he did the tricks well with Edyta and kept his energy up the entire time. He just didn't have much musicality and he's really going to need to buckle down in the studio to stay around in this competition. Edyta however did do a great job in bringing him this far with noooo dancing in his past. I like him though and I hope he can stick it out for a little longer!\n\nBrooke and Derek (Cha Cha): WOW!! From her sexy look and that pant suit she was ready for business. In the past, the models have not done well on the show but Brooke is changing that for sure. Her musicality and sass were hot and her extension was really surprising as well as her great understanding of hip action. To be a mom of four and have a body like that is impressive. She was fabulous for her first dance and the choreography was perfect, Derek did an excellent job. She is going to be around for a long time if she stays on this path!!\n\nRocco and Karina (Foxtrot): Rocco is definitely a cutie and like Jeff tries really hard, but has some major areas that he needs to improve on as well. The Foxtrot for the guy is all about the frame and finesse and his was a little askew. He was too jumpy during the basics where he should have been smooth and the exit of the trick they did was not smooth... it was a little scary. On the flip side, his musicality with the song and choreography was nice, and he had an adorable smile the whole time which showed he was truly enjoying himself.\n\nMaurice and Cheryl (Foxtrot): Being a runner, he definitely has fast feet and knows how to move quickly which will be a plus for him. During his Foxtrot, he had good posture and his footwork was good as well. Like Misty and Warren, you can see his sportsmanship and competitiveness come out as he's dancing and training. I felt that the choreography was too funky for Foxtrot though; Cheryl should have put more basic elements in it and showed the true concept of foxtrot rather than making it \"hip-hop\" looking. However, I think with his determination he will be around for a long time.\n\nLance and Lacey (Cha Cha): He was one of my favorites tonight! I knew that he would be talented anyway because he does have a dance background from being in 'N SYNC. Their Cha Cha definitely embraced the feeling of the dance. It was hot, edgy and very sexy. His timing was right on through the entire routine and the choreography was very different and cool. The only thing that he needs to be aware of is his base - it gets a little too wide and his head gets a little forward. Other than that he did a great job for the first night!!\n\nTed and Inna (Foxtrot): Ted was shockingly elegant and sophisticated. Very smooth throughout the dance and the choreography was nice and \"trotty.\" Frame was nice and strong and it looked like he was actually leading most of the time. His footwork was also the best of the evening. I'm hoping that he will be able to stick around longer and be able to improve from week to week!\n\nVitaliy and Lyudmila opened their new studio to a packed house this past Friday, September 12, dazzling the audience with performances from students and instructors alike. The crowd was electrified with energy from all of the different dances on display for them, ranging in character from the powerful Tango and Paso Doble, to cheeky and flirtatious Cha-Chas, Swings, and Quickstep, all the way to passionate Rumbas and romantic Waltzes among others performed that night. Even passers-by were captivated, stopping to watch from the windows. Vitaliy and Lyudmila were very honored and proud to host such a crowd and could not have envisioned the grand opening of their studio going any better. Requests for dance sessions are already pouring in and the studio is still abuzz with the energy from that night. The entire staff of Fred Astaire South Charlotte is looking forward to spreading their love of dance throughout the community, and would like to thank all that helped make their grand opening an outstanding success!\n\nBy Catherine Brill, Fred Astaire Corporate Copywriter\n\nTwelve years ago, Sasha and Olga Bylim came to the United States in search of a better life, both personally and professionally. Their move was a huge leap of faith. Although they had traveled around the world as professional dance competitors, they’d never been to America before, and their two-year-old daughter, Olesya, had to stay in the Ukraine with grandparents for a few months while they got settled. When they first arrived, they had an offer to work at an independent studio in Indianapolis. \"Thank God,\" Olga recalls, \"that didn’t work out. It went bankrupt within a year.\"\n\nWith the encouragement of Marina and Taliat Tarsinov and Darius and Jolanta Mosteika, the Bylims joined the Fred Astaire New York East Side studio. Now they are owners of two Fred Astaire franchises and honored members of our National Dance Board. \"We are living the American dream,\" Sasha says.\n\nSasha and Olga first met in a dance studio in their hometown in the Ukraine. They competed for 23 years with remarkable success: they were finalists in the 1990 Soviet Union 10-Dance, 3 Time Ukrainian Professional Standard Champions, 1996 Fred Astaire National Champions, 2000 U.S. National Rising Star International Standard Champions, 2000 U.S. National International Standard finalists, and finalists in many more major international championships. They also owned a dance studio in the Ukraine for 10 years.\n\nWhen Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, the Bylims were hopeful and excited that conditions might improve in their country. But as time went by and their hopes began to fade, they knew they had to leave their homeland. Meeting up with the Tarsinovs at a Blackpool Festival one year, they heard great stories about the Fred Astaire organization. \"It sounded as if life could be so much different and better in the U.S.\"\n\nThey taught at the NY East Side studio for three years before opening a new studio in Tarrytown, New York, 18 miles from New York City. The Tarrytown studio has been very successful throughout the years and will celebrate its 10th anniversary next year. Two months ago, Sasha and Olga branched out once again, and opened a franchise in Huntington Station, New York, along with Oleg Skrypnyk and Lena Tolochiy. This area in Long Island has great potential for additional studio locations and they plan on opening five studios there in the next 10 years.\n\nThe Bylims are very proud of the wonderful staff members in their studios – all former students of theirs from the Ukraine. \"They are wonderful dancers. We know for sure because we’ve watched them grow,\" Sasha says. They want their staff members to have the same kind of opportunities that they’ve enjoyed, and would like to help them move forward professionally. \"You can’t keep employees happy just by paying them well. Everyone needs incentives to grow in their career.\"\n\nIn January of this year, the Bylims became U.S. citizens, completing full-circle the journey they started twelve years ago. \"As immigrants to this country,\" Olga explains, \"it’s always been important to us to feel like we belong.\" We are fortunate that they found a new family with us at Fred Astaire.\n\nBy Armando Martin, Fred Astaire National Dance Director\n\nAmerica’s most prestigious Dance Championship was held in Orlando, Florida from September 2-6 2008. It is hard to believe that it has been 38 years since John Monte, Fred Astaire's longtime Dance Director, began with a dream of running the United States Championships and - with so much hard work and perseverance - made it into what it is today.\n\nUSDC is where everyone from all over the world goes to showcase their talents, win titles, and why not, go to Disney World afterwards and this year was no exception. Having more that 7000 entries and couples from more than 37 countries, USDC was once again the place to be the first week in September.\n\nIt is only fitting that a competition that was created by the Fred Astaire Company would have so many of our couples compete and, in some cases, win the TOP titles; in fact, couples that are or will be affiliated with FADS very soon won 4 of the TOP 5 titles at this year’s championships…something that we should all be very proud and ecstatic about.\n\nFirst and foremost, I would like to congratulate all of our FADS couples that participated all week long. Both Pro and Pro-Am couples truly made a great statement about the incredibly high caliber of dancing we have in our company today. There were times when I looked out onto the dance floor and saw two or three FADS Pro-Am couples in a final of a competition that started with 30 to 40 couples - very impressive.\n\nThe International Latin was won by our very own Riccardo Cocchi with his partner Yulia. The speed, power and precision that these two perfect Latin dancers displayed on the floor was incredible. They won all 5 dances with ease and conviction. Also in the Latin category, we had our longtime FADS National Latin Champions, Ilya and Nadia from New Jersey. Ilya and Nadia must have been very disappointed with their final result as I was; I thought their dancing was strong, classy, and full of their very own unique style.\n\nThe American Smooth was won by Jonathan Roberts and Valentina who have been doing a lot of work with our company since my first meeting with them last July and will be fully joining the company by October. Their dancing was fantastic and they had to be to uncrown last year’s champions the way they did. Valentina, as always, danced like a princess in some kind of perfect dream, never going outside of her character and always delighting the onlookers. Jonathan was the perfect partner to her, always showcasing her beauty and elegance.\n\nAlso in the Smooth final was one of my favorite couples in the competition, Misha and Gala from the New York East studio. They had the night of their lives! Although this couple has been coming up very quickly through the competitive ranks under the watchful eyes of Marina and Taliat Tarsinov, I believe that they surprised themselves with their placement, having never been in the US final before they jumped straight up to 4th place this year. Their dancing was inspired, beautiful and larger than life. If they continue to improve on this track, there is no title this great looking couple cannot win.\n\nOther couples who deserve an honorable mention in the Smooth are Vladimir & Vera Kosarev from our Rochester, NY studio; Warren and Babette Brown from our Jupiter studio, and Yuriy Simakov and Oksana Klyuchnyk from North Carolina. All three couples showed great promise and, I am sure, will have much success in the future.\n\nAlthough the standard competitions didn't produce any FADS winners, it was a great showcase for two very good couples in our company. Greg Fidurski and Gabriela Jileva from Montville, NJ were in the final of the Open to the World Rising Star competition and were also second in the Standard Showdance. This couple’s expression and musicality truly sets them apart when they are on the floor. Greg's happy-go-lucky personality is always a refreshing sight on the Standard floor, which is sometimes filled with very serious and focused faces.\n\nRuslan Meshkov and Sandra Nema from the Albany, NY studio had a fantastic USDC, placing second in the US Rising Star competition and fourth in the Open to the World Rising Star. This young, beautiful couple continues to improve by leaps and bounds. They have a very tall look on the floor while at the same time showing great depth in the use of their legs and feet. I haven’t seen this kind of combination since John Woods and Ann Lewis were the World Champions about 12 years ago. Keep watching for this couple in the future.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, the Open Rhythm competition did not showcase a FADS couple in the final, although Albina Habrle and Hayk Arshakian from Milwaukee danced well enough to have been in it. Aaron Desoto and Jaana Lillemagi turned out a great showing; they placed 6th in the Rising Star Rhythm, but in my estimation they could have been higher. They have a very good look on the floor and their dancing is getting better every time I see them.\n\nAnother couple to look out for is Ilya Velednitsky and Mandy Carlyle. I love this girl - she is a pleasure to watch and they have tons of talent and lots of time to develop it. Also Andrey and Elena from South Carolina made a good showing. Technically and visually, this couple has it all. If they could be a little more passionate and even wilder, they could really climb up the standing in this style.\n\nThe Cabaret competition was totally dominated by FADS. The top two couples fought a very good fight for the entire competition, no last names needed here…Eric and Georgia and Jesse and Kimalee, both trained by Luann and Bruno, were flawless in their performances. I had the difficult task of having to make a decision as one of the judges and I was well prepared to give the top ranking to Jesse and Kimalee until Eric laid Georgia flat on his head and began to spin as fast as was humanly possible. He stopped suddenly and she continued to spin on his head like a helicopter before coming down to a complete stop! Right then and there, my mark changed.\n\nBut I must congratulate both couples for their efforts, in a style that is full of some very weird even laughable performances. These four young people bring out all that is best in dance, athleticism and artistry.\n\nWell, that's enough from me this time, but listen, as they say on the NFL, the winners always go to Disney World, so you too can see these great performances again in October at the Fred Astaire National Dance Championships in Orlando, FL. Come and be entertained and amazed at the talent that our company has to offer! See you in Orlando.\n\nBy Stanley Mc Calla, US 10 Dance Finalist, Fred Astaire National Smooth Champion, Fred Astaire National Dance Board Member, Coach and Adjudicator, Fred Astaire Dance Board Examiner\n\nHello there! I hope everything is well with you. A competition that I recently judged gave me the inspiration to revisit an article that I had submitted to you in the past.\n\nWhile judging during that weekend of competition, I found myself rocking from foot to foot to an array of rhythmical melodies that were simply infectious to the soul. The energy projected and the fun expressed by the dancers brought me a nostalgic feeling that I couldn’t control. All the while I felt my essence swaying my body from left to right along with the competitors at the same time I was unconsciously wanting to help some of them with a better use of foot, leg and body action.\n\nThat’s why today I want to talk to you about Cuban motion and how you can practice it.\n\nCuban motion is described as the lateral motion of the hips which occurs as a result of the flexing and straightening of the knees and never a conscious swing of the hips. You can use this technique in the Rumba, Bolero, Mambo, Cha Cha, Merengue, and Salsa, to name a few.\n\nStand with your back straight, your shoulders lined up over your hips, your center pulled toward your spine, feet together with toes turned out. You should feel that your weight is poised towards the balls of your feet. Start by bending one knee at a time, and then straighten it. While doing this, you should control the movement through the center of your body. In order to feel your center, tighten your stomach muscles as well as your plexus muscle.\n\nYou should then feel the natural and lateral motion of your hips. If you don’t, then your posture is incorrect.\n\nOnce you feel the correct motion, try to use the same principle by taking a small step to the side with your left foot then slowly close your right foot to your left foot. All the while, remember your posture, the center, and bending and straightening your knees one at a time.\n\nMake sure that you confirm what you’re doing with your teacher.\n\nUntil next time, happy dancing!\n\nCheers,\n\nStanley McCalla\n\nIf you missed out on seeing the Fred Astaire Dance Studio's \"Jersey Boys\" showcase, go to www.dplab.com for great pictures. You can also order prints and a video of the show there.\n\nLocal stars cut a rug, Broadway-style\n\nDecked out in fancy costumes, local dancers showed off skilled moves Sept. 12 at the Willowbrook Ballroom in Willow Springs. They cut loose on the cha-cha, rhumba, two-step, foxtrot and more during the Chicagoland Fred Astaire Showcase.\n\nMore than 300 people attended the event to watch the \"Give My Regards to Broadway\"-themed show. Nearly a dozen dancers hailed from Northwest Indiana.\n\nDancers performed with instructors and, in some instances, with their significant others. There also were open dance segments allowing anyone to step up to the floor.\n\nA definite feeling of excitement permeated the air as couples performed to tunes from shows such as \"Phantom of the Opera,\" \"Cabaret,\" \"Annie Get Your Gun,\" \"Mama Mia\" and \"Moulin Rouge.\"\n\nThose watching the show also were treated to a performance by professional dancers. The showcase was held at the perfect time -- since ABC's \"Dancing with the Stars\" new season debuts Monday.\n\n\"There's no age limit when it comes to dancing,\" said Schererville resident Bill Davy, owner of Fred Astaire Dance Studios in Schererville and Tinley Park.\n\nDavy, who's been in the business for 30 years, said he's noticed the demographics have changed in a big way in ballroom dancing.\n\n\"Thirty years ago, you'd see people 60 years of age and older interested in ballroom dancing. As time has progressed, the ages have gotten younger,\" he said.\n\nAt his studios, he's taught everyone from teens to students 80 years old.For mother and daughter Donna and Diana Gescheidler, of Hammond, dancing provides them with an activity they can enjoy together.\n\nDuring the showcase, daughter Diana performed to \"Annie Get Your Gun,\" with instructor Jake Thomas, of Lansing. Her mother Donna delivered two dances, entertaining the crowd with the lyrical pirate-themed number titled \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" and a sweeping dance to music from \"Phantom of the Opera.\"\n\nDiana said she got interested in ballroom because of her mother's interest in dance.\"I took beginner's lessons and fell in love with it,\" Diana said, adding her mother gave her a gift certificate for lessons at the Schererville studio.\"I leave everything else behind when I dance.\" Donna said. She's also immersed in another type of dancing as a performer with the Indiana Ballet Theater in Merrillville.\n\nFormer teacher Rae Ann Ostenberg, of Crown Point, became so enamored of the craft she now owns a Fred Astaire Dance Studio in Burr Ridge.\"I was a public school teacher in the Crown Point school system for 23 years,\" she said. After a dramatic change in her life circumstances, Ostenberg decided to pursue her interest in dance.Maggie Cole, 14, of Munster, got bit by the dance bug after watching \"Dancing with the Stars\" on TV.\n\nCole, who performed to the soundtrack from \"Mama Mia,\" said her mother, who is a personal trainer and diabetes educator, encouraged her to take lessons. \"When I dance, it makes me feel happy,\" Cole said.\n\nOther region ballroom terpsichoreans who performed at Willowbrook include:\n\n* Charlene McCormick, Crown Point, is thrilled to trade in her business attire whenever she takes to the dance floor. A real estate agent dolled up as a flapper, McCormick pulled out all the stops during the showcase with her \"Sweet Charity\" number, which she performed with instructor Keith Clinton, of Valparaiso.\n\n* Debbie Davy, Lansing, is sister to Bill Davy, who owns the two Fred Astaire dance studios. Davy, who is a nurse in the plastic and reconstructive surgery department at University of Chicago Hospital, started taking lessons four years ago at her brother's behest.\n\n* Michael and Tamra Kenney, Schererville, decided to take ballroom dance lessons as a couple. She is a first grade teacher who \"always loved to dance,\" and he is an executive compensation consultant who said taking lessons has given them a chance to enjoy the activity as a team.\n\n* Madeline and Donald Casson, Dyer, performed a Viennese waltz to the lilting \"Edelweiss,\" from the \"Sound of Music.\" They started dancing two years ago -- and have been married for two years. Madeline is an accountant in Tinley Park, and Donald is a commercial garbage-truck driver for Allied Waste in Crestwood.\n\n* Rick Strohl, Schererville, started to dance to \"call my wife's bluff\" when she hinted he ought to try it. Strohl said it's good exercise, a great stress reliever -- and fun.\n\n* Becky Lovall, Highland, has only been cutting the rug in class for the past four months and says \"it's a blast.\"\n\nFYI: Fred Astaire Dance Studio, 121 E.

Aaron and Jaana from the Chicago North Studio placed first in all dances from a semi-final in the Open American Rhythm division. Chris and Simona, also from the Chicago North Studio, placed second in all dances from a semi-final in the Open American Smooth division.

Performances will be judged by national and international ballroom competition adjudicators, combined with live audience votes. American Rhythm Champions and Dancing With The Stars celeb dancers Tony Dovolani and Elena Grinenko will be joining this year's event.\n\nRead this excerpt from a Baynews9.com article about the Fred Astaire Dance Studio in Palm Harbor, Florida:\n\n\"At Fred Astaire Dance Studio in Palm Harbor, Ballroom dancing is on the menu, and Tampa Bay on Demand's Virginia Johnson sampled some of the following entrees.\"Latin dancing, swing dancing, fox trot, tango waltzes, rumba cha-cha, swing, mambo salsa, samba - you name it we teach it all,\" explained co-owner Carol Elliot.\n\nTwice a month-the dance studio throws a ballroom party complete with champagne, a free group lesson and a professional floorshow.\n\n\"It's wonderful-- you don't realize the muscles you aren't using until you start dancing,\" says student J.

Both students – Sarah Haworth and Susan Miller – showed the rest of the country that dancing the “Fred Astaire” way leads you to the top!\n\nSusan Miller also did very well at the USDC. Dancing with Arshakian, Susan placed 4th in International Latin and 2nd in American Rhythm (B division). She has danced for the past seven years, participating in every regional and national Fred Astaire event during that time. It’s hard to believe that she was reluctant to take lessons at first! In fact, it was her husband who originally encouraged her to go for it, and now she hates to leave the dance floor. Susan was the 2005 US American Rhythm Champion in her division and has won top student awards for the past four years. At this year’s 2008 Emerald Ball, she won second place in Latin (C division). Well known as the best-groomed lady on the dance floor around the country, Susan is a joy to dance with. “As an instructor, I wish every teacher would have a student like Susan,” Arshakian says, “She doesn’t let anything stop her from becoming the dancer that she wants to be.” Susan dedicates her dances to the memory of her late-husband, Robert, who was “her best friend and best supporter,” Albina Habrle owner of the Milwaukee Central studio, notes.\n\nSarah Haworth, with her partner Hayk Arshakian, came away from the USDC with first place wins in American Rhythm and International Latin (A division). She also came in second place in Pro/Am South American Show Dance. It was a remarkable achievement considering that she is only seventeen years old! Sarah became interested in ballroom after seeing how much fun her parents were having taking lessons at the Milwaukee Central studio; she began dancing 2 ½ years ago and hasn’t stopped yet! At this year’s Emerald Ball, she placed first in American Rhythm (A) and Open Latin (A) and at the 2007 Ohio Star Ball, she won the World Pro/Am Junior International Latin and World Pro/Am Junior American Rhythm Championships. Arshakian is proud of his partner: “Anything Sarah does, she does perfectly.” A straight-A student and captain of her high school’s color guard team, she has also started a popular ballroom dance club in her school. Her future aspirations include becoming a professional dancer and eventually owning her own studio.\n\nCongratulations to both Sarah and Susan! You did a terrific job of representing the Fred Astaire organization and we value and appreciate your commitment to dance!\n\nFred Astaire Spotlight & Trophy Awards at the Washington, D.C.

Each reduced the risk of developing dementia by 63% with dancing offering the most benefit!

It requires coordination with your partner, it requires remembering steps.

Dancing is a wonderful hobby for married couples. It brings them together and they love when it comes to touching each other.'\"\n\nIn debating the importance of classic black and white vs. color films in this article, the importance of Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers movies was mentioned:\n\n\"As for musicals, sure, you can name glorious Technicolor examples—adaptations of Broadway fare like The Music Man, My Fair Lady, and Oliver!, along with such originals as Singin’ in the Rain and An American in Paris. Yet even these take second place to nine black-and-white Fred Astaire–Ginger Rogers movies. Almost every great songwriter journeyed west to work with Astaire in the pre-color period, among them Irving Berlin, the Gershwins, and Cole Porter. Berlin, usually parsimonious with praise, said, 'You give Fred Astaire a song, and you could forget about it. If he did change anything, he made it better.'\n\nSo did Rogers. Astaire danced with other women in other movies, but the magic was no longer there. No matter how farcical or chaotic the plot, Astaire and Rogers established an island of elegance and passion. Their dancing 'was a vehicle of serious emotion between a man and a woman,' dance critic Arlene Croce observed.
