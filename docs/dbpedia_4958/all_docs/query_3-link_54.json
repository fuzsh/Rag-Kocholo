My marriage has lasted forty years. Our children like us, our grandchildren live close. We can afford life’s small luxuries. So why has a new love turned my once-gray hair blond and my nails long and red and replaced my professional suits with flouncing skirts? Why do I waste time talking about my desires and searching the Web for my passion? In academia, to worry about clothes and appearance is to lack seriousness. The sensible person I used to be knows that this new behavior is unsuited to my age and status. I do not care. I stand holding hands with a handsome man half my age. We are at the Heritage Classic DanceSport Championships in Asheville, North Carolina, about to perform the cha-cha. Scott Lazarov, my teacher, whispers reminders: “Straight legs,” “Direction and rotation.” He is a gifted teacher, and when he is pleased with me, I glow. Preparing for competition involves endless repetition of steps I thought I knew, and improvement is hard and slow. It also involves endless worries about appearance, hence the hair and nails. At the Heritage, Scott picks out a dress, bright red with purple bands and red and purple stones. Transparent fabric covers my stomach. A dress I would have once dismissed as tacky now looks glamorous. So do my makeup, my false eyelashes, my elaborate hair, and my high-heeled Latin shoes. Returning home, I wake at night longing for Asheville. My husband understands. In our years together, we have learned that for love to last, we need additional loves. We began weekly dancing lessons four years ago, and it was some time before Scott acknowledged my existence. At parties, many wanted to dance with him; he has a seemingly effortless charm. One time watching me dance the swing, Scott admired my skirt. Later, he asked me to dance and suggested that I take lessons with him. Seduction was easy; by then I would have fallen for any top teacher who suggested I could dance well. xi\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nBallroom dancing is about love and also about sex. When Scott and I work on the foxtrot, knees bend slightly, heads and chests are back, and torsos grind together. The correct leg position dictates that my right leg is between his legs and his left leg is between mine. None of this shows when we dance, because smooth dancing appears romantic, not sexy. The sensation of being held and floating along adds to the excitement and makes me feel light-headed and young. I joined the women’s movement in the 1960s, abandoning flirting and female artifice. I have helped countless women students achieve rich and independent lives. Over a recent lunch, a former student told me that dancing has weakened my messages. But age-inappropriate behavior is women’s last rebellion. I have always excelled at things that can be learned from books. Ballroom dancing involves physical and experiential learning. Sometimes I cannot master a technique after hours of trying, yet still I persist. The Heritage is full of women like me with successful careers and demanding lives. At work, most compete against men; many have broken through, or at least bumped against, the infamous glass ceiling. In dancing, they shed their professional armor, entering a place where men lead, women follow, and the only things that matter are how well you dance and how glamorous you look. I once asked Scott why he danced, an activity American men often avoid. This manly man said he dances for the moments when everything is perfect and the audience is yours. In performing, his face radiates absolute joy, and his connection to his partner is palpable. We all seek this feeling. I am in love with the dancing world and with the person I become when I join for a while. To establish my credentials as an insider in the dance world, I published the above piece in the Philadelphia Inquirer on September 5, 2006, at the start of my research. I often showed this piece to dancers I wished to interview. The headline read, “An Age-Inappropriate Last Rebellion” and continued with the byline of “Julia Ericksen is a sociology professor at Temple University who dances at DanceSport Academy in Ardmore.” At the bottom of the piece my email address was listed with an invitation to contact me. I received about seventy-five uniformly positive responses, from dancers, from former students, from others who saw aging as a time to let loose, and from those with passions other than mine.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWhen I am asked how I came to write a book on ballroom dancing, I typically joke that I did it because it gave me an excuse to hang around dance studios. Yet it is hard to imagine that I could have written it if I did not love to dance, a love I inherited from my parents, Harry and Kathleen Smith, who met on a blind dancing date. As a child, my father taught me to follow by dancing me around the living room. My parents did not live to see me write this book, but they did enjoy seeing my husband and me learn to dance, after many years away from it. Many people facilitated the writing of this book. First I must thank the dancers who gave of their time to be interviewed. The generosity of the professional dancers was amazing. For them, time is money, and I interviewed them in their studios, where they took long breaks from teaching to talk to me at length about all aspects of their dancing lives. I must thank my teacher, Scott Lazarov, for introducing me to professional dancers, when he and I went to compete in pro/am. He helped established my credentials and paved my way to later interviews after dancers went home. These dancers, in turn, introduced me to their students and to other teachers in their studios. Scott was particularly helpful with American dancers, and it would have been difficult to gain introductions to them without him. Paul Richardson introduced me to many of the top international-style dancers. Often it is difficult to get in touch with them, but Paul not only gave me email addresses; he told the dancers what I was doing and got them to agree to interviews. Again, this would have been difficult without Paul’s help. Both Paul and Scott became unofficial advisers to my research, answering my many questions, and I learned a lot about the organization of the dance world through discussions with them. Both were generous with their time and input, and Paul was particularly helpful in explaining the intricate politics of the dance world. John Larsen was also helpful in answering my questions, and he read my glossary of terms just to make sure I said everything correctly. xiii\n\nxiv Acknowledgments\n\nI must thank Jonathan Marion for his compelling photographs of every aspect of the dance world. Jonathan typically photographs professional competition, for that is his academic interest, and he took wonderful professional pictures for this book. He also took pictures of pro/am, pictures of studio parties, and pictures of lessons. His photographs illustrate my words, making the glamour and the emotions of the dance visual to the reader. His introductory chapter in this book adds a fascinating dimension to our understanding of the sociology of emotions. Jonathan read an early version of the manuscript, and his suggestions were helpful. Scott Lazarov and Barbara Capaldi were generous in letting me use their studios to photograph lessons and parties. I would like to thank all the students and teachers who allowed us to photograph them in lessons and at parties. I must also thank everyone who graciously let me use their photographs. Without the visual images, the book’s arguments would be weaker. Many of my colleagues were generous with their time and interest in discussing my work. Some have even seen me dance! In particular, I would like to thank Bill Overton, Sue Wells, Richard Immerman, Kevin Delaney, Judith Levine, and Dustin Kidd. Temple University provided me with the funds for travel and to pay student workers. Alyssa Richman was involved from the beginning undertaking a literature review on dance and performance, which helped me to get started. Veronica Burnazacki is a native Russian speaker, and she helped me in numerous ways. She went to the interviews with Russian speakers and helped translate when they ran into difficulty. Most had excellent English, but we occasionally ran into problems with idioms. Veronica also transcribed many of these interviews and was helpful in explaining what speakers were saying when I could not quite understand the tapes. Ocean Dull transcribed interviews. A former dancer with the Pennsylvania Ballet, Ocean had insightful comments about dancers’ motives. Three other students who ably transcribed interviews were Shea Ogden, Mairead Conley, and Clarissa Marks. Finally, I must thank Elizabeth Cozzolino. Beth took responsibility for creating a bibliography, for making sure all the pictures and their captions were in order, for proofreading the manuscript, and for editorial assistance. Her help was invaluable. My editor, Ilene Kalish, at New York University Press was helpful in every way. She believed in the book from the beginning, stayed in touch when I needed her, turned material around fast, and gave me great suggestions to improve the manuscript. I would also like to thank three anonymous reviewers, whose comments helped improve the book.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxv\n\nFinally, I wish to show my appreciation to my family. My children, Polly, Andrew, and Monica, have families of their own now but never fail to show enthusiasm for my endeavors. All have watched me dance numerous times and are lavish in their praise, even when praise is not due. My grandchildren, Miles, Drew, Blake, and Olivia, think I am a hip grandma, which is high praise in my world. Drew is a talented dancer in her own right and has been making tentative forays into the world of ballroom. Watching her come to terms with the physicality of partner dancing gave me insights into the learning experiences of young dancers. Finally, I must thank my husband of many years, Gene Ericksen. He, too, has taken dance lessons, in part to please me. He has also driven countless miles and attended numerous dance parties while I checked out the social dance scene. He constantly showed me newspaper articles that I might find interesting while working on this book. Ours is a relationship that involves the kind of intimacy only found when a relationship has lasted a long time and faced many different challenges. Gene is the most interesting person I know, so writing this book has been made more pleasurable by his presence. Readers will see that this book is a labor of love. The dance world has enhanced my life and given me permission to transgress our culture’s rules about aging.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction to Photographing Emotion Jonathan S. Marion\n\nW A L K I N G I N T H E door to DanceSport Academy in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, for the first time on July 28, 2010, the first person I see is dancer Jean Paulovich (figures 3.3 and 7.2), and although he does not recall my name, we instantly recognize each other based on a photo I took of him at his first professional competition, at the 2004 Yankee Classic DanceSport Championships in Boston, Massachusetts.1 That we each knew who the other was more than six years later — and both recalled the exact pose and costume in that single photograph — illustrates the power of image in the world of competitive ballroom. More than just a means of facilitating entry and access into ballroom,2 the inextricable intertwining of looking, seeing, and knowing3 enables images to convey understandings not possible from words alone. It is in this light that I hope you enjoy the images in this book and, more important, that they not only help illustrate the textual content but also provide insights. Paralleling Isadora Duncan’s comment, “If I could tell you what it meant, there would be no point in dancing it,”4 much the same can be said of photography: if I could tell you, there would be no need to show it. But photographs are tricky things. Because we each bring our own backgrounds, experiences, and understandings to the images we see, it is easy to mistake self-evident content and meaning as universal, enduring, and fixed.5 Indeed, “photographs are ambiguous. They may be worth a thousand words, but it can be any thousand words.”6 It is therefore important for scholars to think about and understand the strengths (and weaknesses) of both text and image7 and to harness and juxtapose these tools accordingly. “Used correctly photographs and words can work together to produce the desired ethnographic meanings,”8 and the following comments detail the considerations that went into the three interrelated processes of crafting, selecting, and captioning the images in this text. 1\n\n2\n\nIntroduction to Photographing Emotion\n\nCrafting Increasing understanding of the neurological links between perception and understanding9 explain how and why images have the potential to move viewers. This demands ever-greater attention to how social scientists take and use images in their work. Just as the anthropologists John Collier Jr. and Malcolm Collier suggest that “artistry is only a means, for the end is cultural authenticity” in ethnographic film,10 so too with photography. Which is not to say that there is ever an objective, true, or real “thing” to be captured in an image but rather that responsible visual research should always be informed by and reflect the visual cultures in question.11 So how then do I go about trying to take images that are not simply of ballroom dancing but are ballroom dancing? To start with, I try to craft images that are not only “good pictures” but that tell a story, using composition, movement, and emotion to do so. Compositionally, I try to depict what someone watching from my vantage point would actually “see.” As such, my default approach involves (1) shooting level images — since the human brain “corrects” for minor variations in angle — and (2) focusing on one couple at a time (since this is the basic “unit” of ballroom dancing).12 Indeed, to the extent that it is persons who dance — and not their arms, legs, or heads — I generally try to follow Karl Heider’s filmic guideline of framing whole bodies.13 This is not to say that I never take close-up images but to point out that I do so deliberately and for specific reasons, including the following: • If a couple, judge, or spectator is so close to me that I cannot see their whole bodies, all at once, with my naked eye • If I am focusing on a specific action that is not about the whole body, such as a competitor applying eyeliner or lipstick in a mirror • If I am trying to call attention to a specific element — such as an expression — that might not be visible unless cropped in on more tightly14 Likewise, I share Freeman’s perspective that “environment can add a greater sense of the context and the space in which the activities depicted are taking place,”15 and so I try to shoot in a way that captures the immediate surroundings as well, such as the ballroom floor, audience, or lighting.16 These compositional considerations also apply in postproduction. I try to do minimal editing, and, as with my original image composition, I try\n\nIntroduction to Photographing Emotion\n\n3\n\nto let myself be guided by what someone else would see if he or she had been in the same place at the same time. For example, whereas different light sources (e.g., tungsten, fluorescent, flash) all have different color temperatures, the human brain adjusts what is seen to eliminate the color casts captured by a camera’s sensor. For that reason, I will adjust color balance in postproduction. Likewise, while interesting angles make for exciting photographs — a tool I use in much of my more artistic, less ethnographic photography — my default approach in ethnographic settings is to shoot leveled images (whether vertical or horizontal), and straightening is one of the few postproduction manipulations I regularly perform. I may also crop tighter in postproduction, but only when deliberately directing focus and when I can use words (be it in a talk, as a caption, or in body text) to provide appropriate context. Where I use composition to provide focus and context, I try to capture the overall nature of ballroom dancing — interpersonal performance predicated on bodily action — by highlighting movement. This means many things, however, as dancers of different levels move in very different ways. For most starting dancers, for instance, lines and shapes are often brief and hesitant, so I need to click the shutter quickly, before the action disappears. This same approach does not work with elite competitors, however, who “hit” their lines and shapes and then continue to stretch until reaching their personal maximums.17 Here I need to stay focused on the couple, waiting and allowing them time to produce the pinnacle of their own movement in order to accurately represent the tone of their performance. Likewise, while I often use flash (a) to maximize the punch and color of my images and (b) to highlight the couple from the background (as our brain naturally processes for our eyes), I run the risk of having an image look posed. To counteract this, I seek to capture movement by waiting for maximal stretch or catching a dress or hair flying through the air. Finally, in crafting images that tell the ballroom story, I rely on the emotion that is being performed by focusing on competitors’ eyes and expressions. Here, when I say “focusing on,” I do not mean in a technical sense but rather that this is what I am looking at through my viewfinder before deciding whether to snap the shot in front of me. Since dancing is a partnered activity, I try (when possible) to take images where both partners’ faces can be seen. Likewise, I try to make sure that eyes are open and expressions appropriate (which can vary from dance to dance, as seen in the contrasting color images of Katusha Demidova and Arunas Bizokas). Although this has been a slow process (indeed, early on I was cutting off feet and hands as my\n\n4\n\nIntroduction to Photographing Emotion\n\nattention focused on eyes and expressions), with practice (and familiarity with my equipment) I have learned how to “feel” how tight I can get without regularly checking the bottom of the frame — and thus losing focus on the emotions being portrayed on the floor.\n\nSelecting The final photo selections for this book followed two parallel tracks. For many images, I sorted through my digital archives; others were shot on site (both at competitions I was attending and at the studios shown in this book). In each case, the two key questions were these: 1. Does this image add to what is being discussed? 2. Is it acceptable to those whom it depicts? Starting with Julia Ericksen’s original wish list, we therefore (1) identified topics amicable to visual depiction (e.g., not dancers’ ideas and feeling, which were already — and best — conveyed in their own words), (2) discarded images that only illustrated rather than explained (or duplicated the content of others), and (3) composited images where such juxtapositions evoked greater understandings.18 Equally important, however, was the recognition that “no photograph is more important than the wishes of its subject.”19 As such we tried to start by selecting competition images that we thought the people depicted would like and by getting permission to shoot all of the studio images taken for this book. Then, and most importantly, we got explicit permissions for each image used in this book. While the press was only concerned with my permissions (as the copyright-holding photographer), I am a visual anthropologist deeply aware of and committed to the ethical implications of working with visual imagery.20 Ericksen fully recognized and appreciated this perspective, and between us we received permission — in person, online, and by phone — for each of the photographs readers find here.\n\nCaptioning While images speak to each of us, they do not speak for themselves. Rather, “their meaning and significance are defined by context.”21 While this facili-\n\nIntroduction to Photographing Emotion\n\n5\n\ntates photo elicitations on the one hand (an underutilized and often invaluable ethnographic tool whereby research participants provide context to the researcher),22 it also mandates thoughtful and appropriate framing (i.e., contextualization) when images are used in and presented as part of scholarly discourse. “The ethnographicness of any image or representation,” as Pink has pointed out, “is contingent on how it is situated, interpreted and used to invoke meanings and knowledge that are of ethnographic interest.”23 Far too few scholars provide informative captioning, however, let alone link images to written text, thereby generating a dialogue between these different media and modes of representation. This is unfortunate, as deliberate attention to how visual and written data intercontextualize each other facilitates both broader and deeper understandings. This book has taken the linking of image and text very seriously from the outset. Unlike most such texts — where images are gathered post hoc from whatever sources are available — Ericksen chose to collaborate with only one photographer (in this case me). Although this certainly is not the only viable approach, it did allow us to build a common understanding of how images were going to fit into this work. Reading an early version of the manuscript before I started selecting archival images and shooting new materials for this book started the dialogue between image and text, a process that continued as we worked together to select the final images (as noted earlier). Finally, in preparing the captions, attention went to (1) what references were already in place (in the text), (2) what context was lacking, and (3) what elements in the image might need highlighting for those not “in the know” regarding ballroom culture and community. Additionally, and as part of the photo-permission process noted earlier, captions were adjusted to reflect the few instances when any concerns arose. Ultimately, then, careful attention to the relationship between text and image is the vehicle whereby the images presented herein reach their full potential to illuminate the issues at hand.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThanks to Julia Ericksen for inviting me to be part of such an interesting project and for her truly collaborative approach to producing the images in this book. Thanks also to the ballroom-competition organizers and photographers who have facilitated my ongoing research and photography, as well as to Guido Carlo Pigliasco and David Marion for critiques and input on earlier versions of these comments.\n\nIntroduction Entering the World of Ballroom\n\nI T I S T H E last night of the 2008 United States Dance Championships (USDC), and the most popular event is under way: the final of the Open to the World Professional Latin Championship. Six finalists dance the five dances that constitute every Latin competition: cha-cha, samba, rumba, paso doble, and jive.1 As the first dance ends, the crowd favorites, Riccardo Cocchi and Yulia Zagoruchenko, begin whizzing around the floor doing promenade runs to the fast-paced samba music with its heavy drum beat and complicated syncopation. They flirt with each other; they flirt with the audience; they smile and wink as they perform intricate movements in quick succession without missing a step. Their partnership is less than a year old, but both are experienced at engaging the crowd.2 As Yulia moves her long, slender legs, the movement of her dress accentuates their elegance and speed. The audience sits at tables around the edge of the floor or on stadium seating stacked up behind the front tables, or they stand wherever there is space. They are whistling, cheering, and calling out dancers’ names and competition numbers as the master of ceremonies encourages them with, “Who’s your favorite couple out there, ladies and gentlemen?” I am in a floor-side seat cheering and yelling with the rest of the crowd. As Ruud Vermeij3 notes in his advice book for Latin dancers, whereas theatrical dancers perform a role and thus “become the dance,” competition dancers perform as themselves, and their fans come to see them more than the dance.4 The audience has been anxious to see Riccardo and Yulia dance together, since they placed second a few months earlier at the Blackpool Dance Festival in England. Blackpool is the most prestigious and difficult competition in the world, and up to this point, Americans have rarely done this well.5 Color plate 1 shows the couple competing at USDC a year later, when they had moved up on the international stage by coming in first at Blackpool in the jive. The samba ends, and the men move their partners into new spots on the 6\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nfloor. In the rumba, as with several Latin dances, couples do not progress around the floor, so competitors pick spots depending on the direction they will take and where they expect others to go. They try to maximize the chance that each judge will have a clear view of them for at least some of the time and that the audience will notice them too. Inexperienced competitors sometimes crowd the center of the floor because they want the judges to see them, but these experienced finalists spread out. As the music starts, the dancers alternate clinging to one another and turning away. Rumba is a slow, erotic dance; the mood is hot and heavy, and the Latin rhythms are languid. The women bend and hyperextend their legs as they twist and turn around their partners. They slide their feet along the floor toes first, transferring weight from leg to leg and settling their hips after each move to produce rumba’s emblematic rolling hip action. Dimitry Timokhin and Natalia Petrova, another new couple, are dancing for Russia, and the audience gives them a warm welcome. Dimitry and his previous partner, Karina Smirnoff, had made the finals at Blackpool. But when Karina became a regular on Dancing with the Stars, the popular ABC reality show, she no longer had time to compete. Dimitry’s new partner, Natalia, is one of the fastest women on the floor, and after the fourth dance, the dramatic paso doble, excitement builds with the jive. Jive is the most energetic of the dances, and its position at the end tests dancers’ stamina; these finalists have already danced several rounds. This is the most exciting part of the show, as the dancers kick and spin at breakneck speed. Women’s dresses bounce and swirl, their rhinestones flickering in the lights; men slide across the floor; and the audience gets louder. This crowd knows how difficult it is to reach the skill level displayed before them. In Latin dancing, the action portrays a world of swaggering men and “their” women. The dancers depict a man’s world where women are beautiful objects with the power to inflame a man’s passion but not to reject his demands. Women follow the men’s lead and often supplicate their bodies before them. Sometimes they turn away, rejecting their partners’ overtures, only to be turned back face to face with fire and passion. The men strike dominant poses in tight-fitting shirts and pants set off by high Cuban heels. They appear to pull and push the women around, spinning and turning them, demanding their attention. Hips gyrate, legs flick in and out. The women glitter. They wear high-heeled strappy sandals, with bare legs or fishnet stockings, and skimpy clothing adorned with many crystals and sparkling necklaces, bracelets, and hair ornaments. Both men and women are deeply tanned.\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nI think back to my first competition, the Millennium DanceSport Championship, several years earlier.6 I had gone to compete as an amateur dancer with a professional partner, and at night we watched the professionals. The professional competition sent my head spinning, and I did not know where to look. Concentrating on any one couple meant ignoring others. My head flipped back and forth, and I was unable to take it all in. By USDC, I am an experienced enough dancer and competitor to have learned to focus on the dancers I want to see, and I can quickly distinguish the best couples. I understand good technique and can see who is fast but not artistic and who makes up for being slower by dancing with elegance and grace. I note which couples relate to the audience and how well couples connect with each other. The connection is key in ballroom; the dancers are always a couple, and they must show this to those who are watching. This is what I want to show in this book — how to read ballroom, where to look, and how to see the connections. Each dance is scored separately by each member of a panel of judges, and as expected, Riccardo and Yulia win the professional competition easily, losing only two first-place marks out of a possible ninety-five. The Russians come in second, and an exciting new Lithuanian couple, Justinas Duknauska and Ekaterina Lapaeva, come in third.7 The sixth-place couple, Delyan Terziev and Boriana Delcheva, had hoped to improve their results from the previous year, when they achieved third place. Since they also fell from third to fifth in the closed competition,8 Keith Todd, writing in Dance Beat magazine a few days later, suggests that they need an infusion of energy and that they rethink what they are doing.9 Even more surprising, Dimitry Kurakin and Violetta Kurakina, a relatively unknown couple who shocked everyone by winning the rising-star event in Blackpool, do not even place into the finals, although Todd is of the opinion that they probably should have. The other important competition on the last night is the Open to the World International Standard, a style of dancing that is called “ballroom” elsewhere in the world and sometimes in the United States.10 Here, too, there are new partnerships. Jonathan Wilkins and Katusha Demidova, who have won this event ten years in a row, ended their partnership several months ago. This year they are each competing with a new partner. Jonathan is now dancing for his native England with former Blackpool professional champion Hazel Newberry, and Katusha still dances for the United States with Blackpool amateur champion Arunas Bizokas. When Hazel has to withdraw after the first round, suffering from an ongoing shoulder injury,\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nthe open final becomes the same all-U.S. final as the closed final two days earlier. Arunas and Katusha have been scoring slightly ahead of Jonathan and Hazel in international competition, and the audience murmurs its disappointment not to see the couples compete against each other. Katusha is a crowd favorite, blond, elegant, and always beautifully dressed. I find her relationship with her new partner to be a little more aloof than her former partnership appeared to be. Arunas does not emote enough for my taste, although his technique is of the highest caliber. The judges may have felt this too, because the other top U.S. couple, Victor Fung and Anna Mickhed, challenge them more closely than previously, especially in the tango and the quickstep. The motif of ballroom dancing is “dancing as one,” and couples must maintain a closed hold throughout the dance. A closed hold means that they must stay in the classic ballroom hold, with the woman’s left hand on her partner’s upper arm and his right hand around her back. They hold each other’s free hand up and away from their bodies. Maintaining this hold is perhaps the most difficult skill in all of competition dancing, yet these couples speed around the floor with their bodies swinging and swaying together, making their steps look effortless. As with Latin, it is all about gender, but here the theme is romantic rather than erotic, and the lush music reflects this. Ballroom dancing is less exciting for the audience than Latin is; its lesser popularity is manifested by lower attendance, and the audience is less inclined to call out competitors’ names. The first rounds of the professional ballroom competition start early in the evening, and many in the audience have not yet arrived. The couples’ dancing as one makes it harder for audience members to have confidence in their own judgments about which couple is best, and since eye contact between audience and dancers is less frequent than in Latin, there is less opportunity for the audience to feel connected to individual dancers. If there is no connection, there is no emotional excitement, and that is what is most craved here — to feel the sex and the romance. Some couples, such as Igor Litvinov and Julia Ivleva, have been dancing together for over a decade. They bring their students to competitions and have no shortage of fans who call out their number. Even so, the noise level for ballroom dancing remains low compared to Latin. To paraphrase Vermeij, unlike Latin, ballroom becomes more about the dance than the dancers. For me, the sight of all six finalists carefully following the line of dance around the floor is more satisfying, if taken as a whole, though I do register a drop in audience enthusiasm.\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe professional dance competitions are the most eagerly awaited events, but they constitute a small proportion of the total. The bulk consist of pro/am competitions — professional teachers dancing with their adult students. Pro/am competition has been unique to America until recently. Elsewhere, dancers usually start as children dancing as amateur couples, rising through the junior to the adult ranks. They turn professional only after achieving success as amateurs. In the United States, few dancers start as children, although this is changing with the influx of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. However, dancers here may more easily turn professional, because many adults learn to dance as a hobby, which provides teaching jobs for the professionals. Some students become passionate enough to want to compete with their teachers, and this supports the competitive careers of many professionals. Only a few professional dancers are so highly acclaimed that they can support themselves by coaching and performing. Most take students to competitions and dance pro/am with them. Pro/am students often dance in several of the four different styles that constitute competition ballroom in America. The four styles include the two international styles described earlier, which are danced all over the world, and two American styles, smooth and rhythm, which are similar, but not identical to, ballroom and Latin. In the past, most Americans learned American style only, but the influx of foreign professionals has increased interest in international style. At the USDC, a day is given to each of the four styles, with a fifth day for events that cannot fit into the other four, such as preteen and junior competitions, and a variety of showdance and cabaret events.11 Each evening is confined largely to professional competition, when those who danced during the day turn out to watch their idols strut their stuff. The USDC is not the biggest ballroom competition in America, but it is arguably the most prestigious because this is where the national titles are bestowed on both professional couples and pro/am dancers. The governing body for professional dancers in America is the National Dance Council of America (NDCA),12 which is, in turn, a member of the international governing body the World Dance Council (WDC).13 The most prestigious titles in the United States for amateur couples are awarded by a different governing body, USA Dance,14 which has its own competitions and is a member of a different international organization, the International DanceSport Federation (IDSF).15 Both Riccardo and Yulia came to the United States as adults, having previously danced for their countries of birth — Italy and Russia, respectively.\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nThis gypsy existence is common for international-style dancers. Often they dance for one partner’s country of origin, but the example of Riccardo and Yulia is the norm with couples who dance for the United States. The names of the finalists in international style at USDC indicate that most of those dancing for the United States are immigrants. As is fitting for a nation where almost everyone’s ancestors came from elsewhere, the American audience takes Riccardo and Yulia into its heart and takes national pride in their accomplishments. The USDC is held at the Royal Pacific Hotel at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, but the dancers have little time to take in the theme park. The women spend their days in glittering dresses, sporting sleek hair that either does not move or swings perfectly back into place, rhinestone jewelry, lots of thick makeup, artificial tans, and high heels. The competition spawns a cottage industry, with designers and sellers of dresses, shoes, jewelry, and practice wear all hoping to attract the dancers’ attention. Everything is laid out to attract consumers (as can be seen in the pictures of shoes and jewelry in color plate 2). Some designers sponsor professional dancers or even top students, loaning them dresses to wear until an audience member decides to buy the dress literally off a dancer’s back. In addition, one can take coaching, have a massage, or have one’s makeup and hair done. Hair may be turned into the elaborate upswept designs favored by many professionals, enhanced by the addition of extra hair pieces. Photographers sell photographs of each dancer’s performances, and dancers may have their events videotaped to learn from their mistakes. Competitors may also buy books, music, instructional videos, and every conceivable accessory. In addition to competing, I am taking field notes on the competition for this book. I climb to the top of the bank of seats and watch the pro/am Latin competition below. I am interested in the relational aspects of ballroom, since this is what distinguishes it from other dancing. Latin dancing, as noted earlier, is all about the display of sexual interest and intimacy between partners. Ballroom is more subtle in its emotional display, but again connection is key. I especially note that when young professional men dance with older women, a few of them seem unable to emote. I quote from my notes spoken into a recorder as I watched: One man is dancing with an older woman wearing a black and brown outfit. He’s a beautiful dancer, but he’s not looking at her while they’re dancing. He’s looking all around the room instead. I don’t think he ever lays\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\neyes on her, in fact. Even when she looks at him, he does not return her look. He’s showing how great he is by dancing professional-level choreography. She’s really struggling to stand on her own and is having a hard time keeping up. She looks really uncertain as time goes on. I’ll switch to another couple and look at them, a Latino man dancing with an Asian student. The age difference is similar, but he’s much more relational with her. They’re looking at one another now. They’re connected. He’s hovering over her. It’s a completely different experience to watch them. He’s holding her, and he puts his hand on her face and looks into her eyes.\n\nThe experience of the teacher ignoring the student surprises me, because, at my dance studio, teachers do not treat older women this way. I cannot help but think that what I saw that day is a manifestation of our stereotypical ideas about gender and aging — that older women are not attractive and that intimacy between an older woman and a young man is somehow offensive. It is not that this teacher cannot look at the student; it is that he will not connect, he will not be intimate with her. Fortunately, it is a behavior seen in a minority of professionals. When the competition switches to beginners, I notice how many top professional competitors are on the floor. Unlike that first teacher, these dancers take noticeable care of their students. The competition I am watching takes place in the afternoon, before the Latin final described at the beginning of this chapter. Delyan Terziev, who will be a finalist in the evening competition, dances with several students during the day. In the Bronze Scholarship,16 he makes eye contact with his student, and he looks like he is interested in her and in dancing with her. The jive is fun rather than sexy, and she appears relaxed as she basks in his smiles. Delyan’s wife, Boriana Delcheva, sits on the sidelines with his two other students. She watches intently as he dances and will give the students detailed feedback. This is common when professional couples compete together and husbands take students to dance pro/am. Figure I.1 shows professional dancer Carolina Orlovsky-Telona watching her husband, Felipe Telona, dancing with his longtime student Ruby Yap. Although a few teachers are not particularly respectful, the majority are like Delyan, attentive to their students’ needs for care and preparation. The USDC is held during the first week of September, a week that marks the beginning of classes at Temple University, where I teach sociology. I am on study leave but still feel negligent of my duties as I try to make sense of an exotic culture bearing little resemblance to the academic life\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nFig. I.1.

Marion.\n\nthat constitutes my everyday world. This has been a long journey, one that started as a child watching my parents dance around the living room. In my early teens, I took group classes at my local village hall in the north of England. I stopped ballroom dancing in my late teens when it became unfashionable, but I always regretted leaving it behind. My husband and I have birthdays six weeks apart, and some years ago, he suggested that we celebrate them by taking dance lessons. He knew I would like the idea but was surprised when, a few hours after his casual suggestion, we were signed up for lessons. We started with a joint private lesson and quickly got hooked. We progressed to separate lessons, because it is easier to learn when your teacher focuses entirely on you. We increased the frequency of lessons over time. Competing took a little longer. I could not imagine wearing competition dresses or makeup, and the idea of holing up in a hotel, at a place I did not want to visit, seemed strange. My husband was the first to try, and he came home with such extravagant tales that I soon followed and fell hopelessly in love with the whole experience.\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany of the students who compete are professional women with lives like mine, and yet all are passionate about dancing and competing in a world that differs completely from their everyday lives. This book is my attempt to understand the fascination it holds for participants.17 Many of the women who dance have benefited from second-wave feminism on their paths to success. Yet they dance in a world that seems traditionally gendered, where appearance is all important, and where men lead and women follow. This is a world where men are men and women are girls, no matter their age. Why, I wondered, do successful women choose this world as the place to spend their precious leisure time? Why do they want to spend time and money visiting a world in which they would likely not want to live? What motivates teachers? How do they learn to satisfy students’ desires? At the same time, professional dancers earn a living by it, usually by teaching or coaching and sometimes by putting on shows. Students can spend tiny fortunes on lessons and competitions. What are they buying? What are the teachers selling? Ballroom dancing seems a perfect example of what sociologist Viviana Zelizer has called “the purchase of intimacy.”18 This phrase describes the commercialization of emotions in everyday life. In ballroom, professional competitors learn to display an emotional relationship for dance audiences to enjoy and consume. They also learn to provide students with an intimate experience. I argue that it is this intimate experience that seduces students, particularly women students, into the world of dance. Of course, both students and professionals have long-term relationships that they must manage in addition to the instant intimacy of the dance floor. Furthermore, students and their teachers develop complex relationships over time, relationships that can deepen over shared experiences and confidences, even while governed by the demands of the marketplace. This book explores the development and attractions of these emotions. In the beginning, I intended to confine the book to competition dancing, both professional and pro/am. The art of emotional display is most highly developed in professional competition, and in pro/am, adults are able to pay for the instant gratification of dancing with professionals and to enjoy the spoils of competition without devoting their lives to it. However, in preparation for my research, I started exploring the dance lessons and activities available in the Philadelphia area, where I live, and as I began to discover the offerings, I found a more nuanced picture than I originally imagined.\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nWhen my husband and I decided to learn, I contacted the studio most convenient to our work, a studio in the center of the city, where rents are high and lessons are correspondingly expensive. Students take private lessons by appointment, after which they leave and another student replaces them. Many students have “standing appointments,” locking up particular times for their lessons. The studio has weekly social dances, where students practice their steps. Instructors attend these parties and dance with each student in turn. At this particular studio, outsiders are unwelcome at parties, although that is not the case at all dance studios. At our current, more enlightened studio, in Ardmore, a suburb of Philadelphia, instructors see parties as a way of attracting new students. Figure I.2 shows studio owner Scott Lazarov dancing with four different students during a party in July 2010. In rapid succession, he danced with these among other students, finishing by dancing a polka with another teacher, Tim Jones, to celebrate Tim’s birthday. I discovered many classes and parties on the outskirts of Philadelphia, either in low-rent areas or in places used for other purposes, such as a local YMCA. These programs are less expensive to run, and studio owners offer group lessons, packing in as many students as possible in order to cover costs. For example, the Atrium Ballroom on the edge of Camden, New Jersey, an impoverished suburb, is nestled among liquor stores, strip joints, and fast-food places. It is on a major highway that can be reached quickly from over a large area; those within a forty-mile radius can drive to the studio within an hour or less. On Sunday afternoon, there is a “Ballroom Mix Party,” starting with a group lesson focusing on a particular dance, for example, a month of international tango. This is followed by several hours of social dancing, during which dinner is served to those who want it — and many do. The whole program costs twelve dollars. The generous parking lot is jammed, and by five p.m., folks are lined up for supper. Supper is a convivial affair, as can be seen in figure I.3. The standard of the social dancing is high. Dancers of all ages crowd the floor, and regulars move from partner to partner with ease. I counted over one hundred attendees on a typical Sunday, compared with perhaps thirty at the downtown studio parties described earlier. It did not take me long to realize that these social dancers should be included in my research — at least as a brief comparison — if I want to understand the passion for dancing among a variety of American adults. Many participants are older, single adults who know one another from years of\n\nFig. I.2. The hard work of a dance teacher.

Social dance students learn by dancing with each other and by rotating partners. Social dance differs from competition dance because it is aimed at the performers, not the audience.19 There is more emphasis on steps than on technique, because social dancers want to be able to dance with strangers. They are not being judged on form, and students do not learn choreography, although they often learn sets of steps. I decided to interview dancers of all kinds, although I confined myself to those who dance mixed Latin and ballroom, rather than those who focus on individual partner dances, such as salsa, East Coast swing, hustle, West Coast swing, or Argentine tango. Each of these single dances has passionate devotees who dance many nights a week in the venues available in most large cities.20 They concentrate on perfecting a particular dance rather than learning the variety of dances that the ballroom studios teach. Widening my scope to include each of these dances would have made the research unmanageable. Professional dancers follow a prestige ranking. At the top are those who compete in international competition, followed by those who compete in American style. The top dancers earn their livings doing shows and giving demonstrations, but these are few in number. Some supplement these activities by coaching amateur and professional couples. Most dancers who compete, however, teach students who want to compete with their teachers in pro/am competitions. The most successful teach only pro/am students,\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nbut most also teach private students who do not compete, at least not often, and they may give group classes in some aspect of the dance (for example, “Latin Styling”) for students and even other professionals who want to improve. After these dancers retire from professional competition, they usually continue to teach pro/am. Ranked below these professionals are those who teach social dancers. The top students are those who go to many competitions, dancing with the same professional teacher and paying for many hours of lessons. A larger group of dancers compete but not as often as they would like to, and these are also interested in social dancing. Another group of students takes private lessons but only performs at showcases organized by the studio. Under them are the social dancers who spend time in group lessons and attend many social dances. They may watch competitions but do not compete. Ballroom dance is an increasingly popular activity. As we shall see, teaching ballroom is one of the few ways that dancers can make a living through dance. Every large city has many studios, and students may choose to go dancing every night of the week. The popularity of ballroom dancing had been growing even before Dancing with the Stars began to appear on television, but that show has increased its popularity. The tenth-season premiere in March 2010 finished in a virtual tie with American Idol for the week’s top spot, with 24.2 million viewers.21 The large number of immigrants who love dancing, from both Asia and eastern Europe, has also helped to increase the number of studios. I conducted sixty formal interviews with all these types of dancers and found that the categories are more permeable than described here.22 Some professionals, particularly women, find that they have to teach social dancing in order to pay for their own lessons and to keep competing. Some professionals start out competing in amateur competitions, although this is more common in other parts of the world where pro/am does not exist. This is changing with the influx of immigrants from eastern Europe, and competitions often include amateur dancers, particularly children and adolescents. In addition, many studios, except for the top ones, supplement their income by teaching special-occasion dances, most commonly for weddings. And dancers change category. Some students compete for a while and then decide they prefer social dancing, or vice versa. Others do well in pro/am competition and turn professional, hoping to make a career out of their passion. For purposes of simplicity in discussing dancers, I have divided them into competition professionals, social dance professionals, competition\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nstudents, and social dance students. Each of these groups is divided by gender, making eight groups of dancers in all. Some do not fit such tidy packaging, but the typology works for the most part. In chapter 1, I lay out my arguments about ballroom and the commodification of intimacy, including an outline of my research questions and methodology.\n\n1 The Purchase of Instant Intimacy\n\ndiminutive woman in her sixties, had studied ballroom dance for over twenty years, dance had never lost its glow. She explained, “I don’t have a social life. I only have a dance life. . . . I sacrifice everything for it; friendships, family, they come second.” Phoebe had always loved to dance, and as a teenager, she had persuaded her father to pay for ballet lessons, after having, as she put it, “taught it to myself really.” She resumed these lessons in adulthood, and at one point, the instructor began to teach the class something he called “ballroom performance.” This involved teaching the students a choreographed number. They learned no technique, just steps, which bothered Phoebe because she wanted to dance correctly. Phoebe had also been taking private ballet lessons with the same teacher, she said, “for no particular reason, except to get better and because I loved it.” She decided to change the lessons to half ballroom and half ballet “to learn how to do it right.” Her teacher upped the ante: A LT H O U G H P H O E B E , A\n\nHe asked if I knew what a dance competition was, and I said, “No.” He told me, and he said, “There’s a division called ‘Newcomers.’ You dance with a teacher, and it’s for someone who’s only danced three months. You have to do only three steps in each dance.” He wanted to know if I might be interested in that, and I said, “Yes, it sounds like fun.” He then said, “Well, good, because it’s in three weeks, and I’ve already signed you up.” . . . I was . . . just sold. . . . Ballet class you get to perform in front of the mirror and whoever is in the class, but this is performing.\n\nPhoebe’s passion for ballroom competition continued. She described herself as being “as serious as any professional.” She was currently on her fourth teacher and planned to compete about six times over the coming year at some of the bigger competitions. Dance provided meaning and happiness in Phoebe’s life. She lived in a small apartment with only her cat for company and worked in a demanding but tedious job. On a lesson day, she said, “I’m always in a good mood, because this is my joy. It’s what I’ve 20\n\nThe Purchase of Instant Intimacy 21\n\nwaited all day to do. I wake up in the morning, and my first thought is, ‘Is this a dance day, or is this not a dance day?’ ” Phoebe practiced a double consciousness about the intimacy involved in the student-teacher relationship. She wanted to be the favorite student of every teacher, and she had had crushes on each of them. However, she added, “I know that it’s a crush. It’s not ever been real.” A previous teacher had had about “seven students, but a core group of four,” and, she said, “we all fought for his attention.” Phoebe added, “I think it was so immature, when I look back on it. We were all adults in our forties. . . . ‘Who’s the favorite?’ ” When this teacher retired, Phoebe thought that she would never “want to dance with anybody else.” However, she quickly discovered, “It’s not him at all. It’s the dance that I love.” The hope for a perfect dance relationship was important in framing Phoebe’s desire for closeness, but, in turn, the desire for intimacy helped create her love of dance. Phoebe’s commitment to dancing, and her desire for the connection that dancing provided, positions ballroom dancing as an example of what sociologist Viviana Zelizer has called “the purchase of intimacy,” that is, an understanding of intimacy as inevitably mixed with economic activity in the modern world.1 Intimacy, just like any commodity — a pair of shoes, a bag of potato chips — can be bought and sold. However, because we view intimacy and commerce as incompatible, people carefully negotiate the connections between the two. While we can see the economic basis of commercialized intimacy, such as sex work, we do not always recognize that close personal relationships, such as courtship and marriage, also depend on a complex set of economic entanglements. The dance world is somewhere between these two — more obviously commercialized than marriage but more genuinely close and personal than sex work.\n\nDance and Intimacy Ballet dancers who know the choreography can partner any number of dancers in a role,2 but ballroom dance partners learn together. This appears to require an intimate connection, something we think of as developing slowly by means of personal revelations and increasing mutual dependency. Yet, in ballroom, the emotional connection of the couple develops quickly. From the first lesson, the teacher’s warmth and apparent pleasure in the lesson create a feeling in the student of being special. Furthermore, dance professionals learn to display an emotional connection with their\n\n22\n\nThe Purchase of Instant Intimacy\n\nprofessional partners as well as their students, whether or not they feel it. In addition, dance involves a physical connection not normally available outside a sexual relationship.3 Dancers hold one another. They sweat together. Becoming comfortable with this can be difficult but pleasurable. Dance intimacy, then, involves a quick intimacy, a public display, and a physical connection. I call this “instant intimacy.” Instant intimacy is not only about the speed with which the relationship develops; it is also about physical closeness. Inside the dance studio, on the competition floor, and on the social dance floor, partners touch, hold hands, hug, and kiss with seeming abandon. Partners do bodily favors for each other, like massaging a sore back or pinning a pair of pants that have come unstitched. These same dancers, particularly if there is an age disparity between teacher and student, behave more formally in public spaces, only relaxing their guard in the safety of the dance space. Zelizer examined the way couples negotiate the economic implications of long-term familial relations. She looked at court records of cases involving fights over the appropriate economic rewards for intimate caring to see the ways that couples combine economic transactions and intimate relationships and the stories they tell to explain the intermingling of the two. I am interested in intimacy and its portrayal in relationships that are ephemeral, not lasting. I argue that the attractions of instant intimacy are a feature of a world with high divorce rates and late average age at marriage. In such a world, many people organize their lives around short-term relationships, forgoing the demands of more encompassing connections. Furthermore, even long-married persons often wish for a safe variety in their intimate life, one that is emotionally satisfying but limited. Phoebe explicitly purchased emotional connection. Her income was between fifty thousand and seventy-five thousand dollars per year, and she spent most of it on dance. Because she did not earn enough to cover both her day-to-day living expenses and dancing, her savings were dwindling. Although she was an extreme case, she was by no means unique in her willingness to put dance first. Zelizer notes in her book on money and its social meanings that money is not entirely fungible; that is, individuals segregate according to use.4 Phoebe recognized her dancing as an extravagance but was frugal in every other aspect of her life. Phoebe’s teacher and competition partner was a highly ranked professional. Although he worked as an independent teacher and did not have to share his fees with a studio owner, Phoebe’s lessons were costly.5 When asked how much she spent on dancing, Phoebe became nervous, saying,\n\nThe Purchase of Instant Intimacy 23\n\n“Oh, dear, I don’t want to go there. . . . I don’t want to figure it out. . . . I’d rather be ignorant.” In order to pay for competitions, she cut corners wherever she could. Where most student competitors eat hotel food, often with their teachers as part of the competition package, Phoebe took food with her and ate in her room.6 She stayed at the competition only on the days she was competing, which saved on tickets to the evening shows and on hotel bills but meant that she rarely got to watch the professional competition. She danced in one style only — American smooth — so she could usually confine the dancing to one day and use one dress at a time. She was spending about two thousand dollars per competition, which is less than most students pay. She attempted further economies, such as selling her old dresses — a difficult feat because many students have dresses to sell, and fashions change quickly. She had resolved not to buy new dresses but found this decision difficult to sustain. When she started dancing with her current teacher, the pressure to spend increased: Each one’s different. This one’s incredibly controlling. . . . I always have somebody do my hair, because I can’t do it, but I did my own makeup, and the first few times he didn’t say anything except, “You need more makeup.” I went, “I have so much makeup on.” “That’s not even makeup.” I put more on, and the last time, he said, “I don’t like your makeup. . . . It doesn’t look professional. I want you to have it done.” I went, “It costs more, come on.” He went, “No, I really insist.” So I had someone do it, and he was like, “See what a difference it makes? How many people came up to you and said how terrific, how beautiful you looked.” . . . I make mine a little more natural looking. When you’re older, I think you look better if it’s more natural looking. . . . I love black, and I had a black dress made. . . . This teacher, when he finally saw it on me . . . wasn’t very enthusiastic. . . . I saw a dress . . . that I really loved, and it’s red. . . . We tried it on, and he said, “It’s much too big. It can’t be fixed. My partner can make it for you.” We copied that dress, only we made it a lot better. . . . The back has three little scoops, and she said, “We could make the back open completely if you want.” I went, “Oh, I kind of like my back still.” She came back three days later and said, “No, he says it should be closed.” . . . I was just imagining him saying, “Oh, no! She’s too old.”\n\nHere we see the way in which money was the medium used to secure a relationship but also the way in which the relationship influenced Phoebe’s decisions about money. Phoebe wanted her teacher to care about her but\n\n24 The Purchase of Instant Intimacy\n\nworried that he viewed her as old. She interpreted his autocratic behavior as evidence of his interest, and she let herself be talked into wearing more makeup than she found flattering. Phoebe was explicit about her ambivalence over the commercialized nature of the intimacy she obtained from dancing. On the one hand, she described what she greatly valued: all the different kinds of relationships you can have with your teacher. You can be friends. You can flirt. . . . I used to tell [one], “Oh, my God, you’re so gorgeous,” but it was more to relax him. . . . He would say, “I know they’re all looking at my butt.” He could talk about it. You’re exploring the pro/am relationship, and I feel it can be a beautiful thing. It can be very supportive and very caring, and maybe it crosses the line.\n\nYet Phoebe worried about the commercial implications of her feelings: “It’s just a job,” I remind myself. “They’re getting paid for this. . . .” For me, it’s a passion, and I don’t want to exaggerate what they feel for me. Maybe they don’t. Maybe they — “Well, I like her, but it’s still just a job.” I always have to tell myself, “Maybe it’s not a friendship. . . . It’s just a job, and hopefully for them, it’s a pleasant job.” They usually say, “I love teaching. I love what I do.”\n\nHere we see the dilemma for teachers and students. Most teachers declare that teaching is more than just a way to make money and that they care about students and their performances. While it is clear that many do, students can never be certain, because they live in a culture with an apparent disconnect between caring and commerce. Phoebe attempted to reassure herself that her teachers genuinely cared by putting considerable effort into creating friendships with them that extended beyond the dance floor. She despaired of her current teacher, who had proved resistant to her overtures. If she asked him to have lunch with her at a competition, he would “take a rain check.” She fondly remembered the teacher over whom she had fought. She told me, “He preferred to be with us. He really didn’t want to be with his colleagues. He would say we protected him. . . . We’d just talk about everything in the world; music, show business, politics.” That is, Phoebe knew his feelings were genuine.\n\nThe Purchase of Instant Intimacy 25\n\nPhoebe noted, I would have trouble having that kind of conversation with some of the others. . . . Some are not very knowledgeable, or very educated, or they come from different cultures nowadays. . . . It has always been important to me to have a personal relationship with the person though. . . . I want to break that barrier, and I’m not happy until it’s broken. . . . The best way to do it is to show them how interested you are in their career, and I usually am. . . . I also like to find out about their life, their past. . . . You start sometimes even talking about your personal life. They may even ask little by little. You don’t talk during lessons, because that would be a waste of money. . . . At competitions, some include you afterwards, some don’t. It doesn’t hurt my feelings.\n\nThe former teacher had been born and raised in the United States, whereas the new teacher was an ambitious immigrant from one of the poorest countries in eastern Europe, so breaking down the barriers had proven difficult. However, Phoebe kept trying.\n\nIntimacy, Gender, and Commerce Ballroom dance always draws attention to two types of human bodies: male and female.7 For many students and audiences, the gendered nature of this dancing is part of its attraction. Phoebe’s husband had died shortly after she started. Male companionship was important to her; her main source came from dance lessons, always carefully calibrated in dollars. She described the dance relationship as one of equals. Although she understood that the man’s role is to lead and the woman’s is to follow, she argued that “the woman does fifty percent.” She even noted that “there are certain times when you’re leading the motion.” She saw smooth dancing as “simply a love story of a man and a woman, whether they’re fighting or flirting or playing or seducing.” However, she liked the idea of “ceding something to them” because she saw it as “very feminine.” In this way, dancing helped maintain her gender identity. While the performance of ballroom appears traditionally gendered, in reality gender plays out in complex ways. Masculinity in American society has been conceptualized as an endeavor that requires the approval of other\n\n26\n\nThe Purchase of Instant Intimacy\n\nmen.8 Men who dance professionally, however, transgress this understanding, because, while other men may be an important audience during a performance, male teachers spend most of their days relating to and pleasing women. The intimacy rules that male teachers follow involve a mix of traditionally gendered and transgressive behaviors. In contrast, professional women dancers must tread a fine line between telling male students what to do and showing them how to take charge. Some men find it difficult to be taught by a woman, which is one possible reason that there are many fewer male students than female. In addition, the flirting that is a part of studio life has a different and potentially more dangerous meaning when the student is male and the teacher female, rather than the other way around. The idea that money can buy intimacy helps explain why Phoebe looked to the commercial dance world for a dose of romance.9 Phoebe desired personal, but nonsexual, physical relationships with handsome young men, and she was willing to pay for them. At the same time, she was quite brutal in her description of the limits of these relationships, noting the emotional labor she undertook to achieve a closer connection.10 Romantic love is regarded in our culture as indispensible for true happiness.11 For those who have not found it, love can also be bought by those who can afford it. Commercial relationships permeate all aspects of modern life, putting love and romance up for barter like any valuable commodity. Phoebe understood that she had to pay for the romance of dance. However, she did not view it as just another product; dance was special and worth much sacrifice. This is common when intimacy and money intertwine. Phoebe was utilitarian in her approach to membership in the dance community, carefully calibrating how to cut corners without destroying the quality of the experience. She noted that her teacher found it “uncomfortable” to talk about money and that it was better when he could “make a joke of it,” underscoring a desire to deny that intimacy is commercialized. We prefer to think that there is one true love in our life, a relationship impervious to the vicissitudes of the marketplace. Indeed, Phoebe justified her teacher’s unwillingness to spend time with her by explaining that “he just wants to be with his partner, who is the love of his life.” Phoebe underscored this ambivalence over the commercialization of emotion in her description of her family’s initial reactions after she became enamored with competitive dancing. Until they met her teacher, they were suspicious of his motives and worried that she was “being taken advantage of by this young man who wants her money.” After her husband died,\n\nThe Purchase of Instant Intimacy 27\n\nPhoebe’s children questioned her motives more strongly. They were embarrassed by her ardor for dance, telling friends, “My mother’s lonely. She has nothing else to do. It’s a nice little hobby that she’s doing, but isn’t she getting totally carried away? . . . Isn’t it taking over her life? Why is she so obsessed?” Phoebe’s daughter, a high school student at the time, was particularly uncomfortable. When her daughter’s friends asked Phoebe how her dancing was going, the daughter would “freeze.” This had changed in recent years. Her children had watched her dance and seen how happy it made her, but they did not like her to “go on and on and on about it.” Some critiques of love under capitalism assert that love cannot flourish when it becomes subservient to commerce.12 Instead some people have argued that true love must be free of commerce, a view which has been called “one of the most important mythologies of our time.”13 I take the position that there exist many opportunities for people to purchase a romantic or intimate experience without the need for love. For example, when people go social dancing, they experience physical closeness and friendliness, but they typically leave alone.14 They do not necessarily see the intimacy they purchase as commercial, but it is an experience that is bought and consumed. Phoebe is but one example of many dancers I interviewed who saw love and romance as commodities, which enhanced their quality of life, and who had few qualms about their purchase. She and other students I interviewed saw the glamour of ballroom as additional evidence of its power to enhance romance. Phoebe called dancing “making love to these people.” In a study of the connections between love and late capitalism, Eva Illouz interviewed fifty couples about their romantic experiences.15 Particular commodities became essential components of the romance, while, at the same time, the culture of romance invested some commodities with an iconography of love. Her couples echoed the types of romantic relationships that are prized in our culture: getting out of everyday space, doing something glamorous and exotic, and most especially, marking the time as different and celebratory. The world of ballroom offers an ideal example of this type of romantic experience. While the relationship between commerce and romance is explicit, it has to be managed carefully. Even though romantic love is not involved, teachers understand that dancing provides an intimate and glamorous experience. Students expect to receive this, whether they are beginning social dancers or top pro/am competitors. The studio atmosphere contrasts with everyday life. Worries are to be left at the door. Students frequently\n\n28\n\nThe Purchase of Instant Intimacy\n\nreport being tired and distracted by work at the beginning of a lesson, only to find these feelings disappear after a few minutes. Pleasure is the order of the day, even when students are being exhorted to try harder. The combination of hard work and emotional reward makes every experience an occasion, and competitions feel “like running away to join the circus.” The pursuit of romance on the dance floor is largely, but not exclusively, a female endeavor, especially in pro/am dance studios which emphasize technique, long-term commitments, and competition. It is less true in social dance venues. Here one finds middle-age and older, lower-middleclass men who live alone and use the dance floor as a way to obtain a small measure of noncommittal intimacy. On the whole, men prefer to purchase other leisure activities. For example, baseball fans may attend fantasy camps and obtain coaching from retired players; 170 men each paid around forty-five hundred dollars to attend the 2008 Phillies camp in Clearwater, Florida,16 while eighty men each paid ten thousand dollars for a week’s practice with Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski.17 The intimacy that these men purchase — male camaraderie and an insider status in the masculine world of sports — is different from that achieved by dancing with a partner and synchronizing bodies and movement. Men are the major purchasers of the wide variety of explicitly sexual services sold all over America. Sociologist Elizabeth Bernstein argues in her book on the transformation of prostitution that professional men with demanding jobs are increasingly seeking a “girlfriend experience” with high-end sex workers; they want all the trappings of a successful sexual relationship without the commitment.18 The “girlfriend” is different from the dance teacher; girlfriends do a man’s bidding, but teachers have their own ideas about what should happen. One could argue that women students want a “boyfriend experience,” a relationship involving romance and commitment with physical affection but no sex. Women may well desire sex as much as men do, but even in a world of “hooking up,” there are costs involved in developing a strong commitment to sexual pleasure.19 Although some women are willing to pay the price for this — Bernstein’s middle-class sex workers, for example — it is safer, particularly for older women, to pursue the stereotypical feminine alternative of romance to be found in private ballroom lessons. In our culture, romantic love and affection are viewed as the prerogative of women, while men are seen as more concerned with the practical. Yet the practical is a way of loving, even if it is not always seen as such.20 Our\n\nThe Purchase of Instant Intimacy 29\n\nnorms about appropriate gender roles portray men as independent and dominant and women as dependent and incapable of practical action. In ballroom, these qualities are not so clearly gendered. Dance teachers embody a mixture of male and female qualities, and the mixture plays out differently by gender. Furthermore, as women have moved into the world of work and up the ladder of success, this description of the gendered nature of caring seems outdated. Yet career-oriented independent women who decide to enter the world of ballroom often revert to gendered stereotypes. Indeed, in an effort to recruit men, the Oxford University dance team sold T-shirts; the back of the women’s read, “The only place where men are still in charge: On the dance floor.”21 In an examination of advice books for women, Arlie Hochschild reported that the majority of them were “cool modern”; they counseled women that emotional life is commercialized and advised readers to defend themselves from emotional hurt.22 Although many women accept sexual desire as normal and, indeed, want to engage in sexual experimentation, love and romance continue to be important to them, and they sometimes despair of finding them.23 The world of ballroom provides a way to protect against hurt, because women understand what it is they are purchasing.\n\nA Brief History of Dance The Victorians had a different view of romantic love. Like many people today, they idealized it as a noncommercial relationship, but they also emphasized its spiritual importance. In 1892, when Clelia Mosher interviewed married middle-class women about the purpose of sex, the majority of her respondents approved of sex for nonprocreative purposes, but only if it led to a greater spiritual connection between the couple and, through that, to a closer connection with God.24 During that time, however, a wave of secularization was emerging, and romance began to replace religious faith as the goal of marriage. The marketplace responded by producing commodities to enhance the desirability of the wearer and leisure activities, which could lead to romance.25 One such activity was the commercial dance hall. Dancing had been popular for centuries in Europe and America, despite Protestant declarations against it.26 For most of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, closely chaperoned formal balls were held in private houses.27 Readers of Jane Austen will remember the ceremony of asking\n\n30 The Purchase of Instant Intimacy\n\nfor and accepting dances, the public commentary on who was dancing with whom, and the frequent partner changes during the dance, which allowed for little more than snatches of private conversation while on the floor.28 Those lower on the economic ladder took their pleasures at country dances, where partners changed during the dance and vigorous steps precluded much in the way of intimate conversation or close touching. The waltz was introduced at the beginning of the nineteenth century and was considered scandalous because of the close position of the dancers and the opportunity it provided for a longer private conversation between partners.29 The social changes accompanying the rapid urbanization of the late nineteenth century led to shifts in social mores and in what was deemed acceptable in social relations between men and women.30 By the end of the nineteenth century, there was greater acceptance of the waltz, but it was the introduction of ragtime music and the development of syncopated movements that created the dance craze of the early twentieth century. Ragtime developed among Black Americans, quickly becoming a craze in America and Europe. Many of the dances it inspired are no longer popular, but its endorsement of freedom and desire for rhythm continue. By 1910, the growing dance craze persuaded restaurants that dance floors would increase business, which led to the building of numerous dance halls.31 This trend continued after the end of the First World War.32 Social dancing was so popular between the wars that taxi-dance halls, memorialized in the song “Ten Cents a Dance,”33 flourished in America as places where single men, often immigrants, could obtain the company of women.34 When sociologist Paul Cressey wrote about the dance hall in the early 1930s, he viewed it as a place for sexual and romantic relationships, not for dance itself. One factor promoting the commodification of romance was women’s increased economic independence. In the late nineteenth century, young working women changed their leisure activities from family to peer-group events with opportunities to meet young men and fall in love.35 This gave rise to a heterosocial world of leisure centered on the movie theater and the dance floor. Spending one’s time this way quickly proved attractive to middle-class girls, and they followed their working-class sisters out of the home and into the dance hall. Commercial dance halls were, from their beginnings, associated with sex and romance. Dorothy Richardson, a teacher from upstate New York, moved to New York City around the turn of the twentieth century in order\n\nThe Purchase of Instant Intimacy 31\n\nto support herself.36 She was horrified to find that the women she worked with in various factories spent much of their earnings going to these “pleasure clubs.”37 The assumption that dance halls led to liaisons and even sex was a cause of concern, particularly since well-bred middle-class girls were anxious to experience the thrills and dangers of the public dance hall. Thomas Faulkner, the former proprietor of the Los Angeles Dance Academy, converted “from a dancing master and a servant of the ‘evil one’ to an earnest Christian and a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ.” He answered the question about potential harm in dancing by describing the inherent dangers of letting beautiful young daughters of wealthy parents learn the waltz.38 Faulkner’s may have been an extreme position, but the late nineteenth century was replete with advice on proper ballroom conduct, and debate raged as to whether ladies and gentlemen might waltz together, even at private dances.39 By the early twentieth century, recognizing that New York City was “dance mad,” writers began to call for reform to allow young people to enjoy the dance hall’s pleasures while avoiding its pitfalls: No girl comes to the dancehall night after night and remains as she was when she began coming there. You cannot dance night after night, held in the closest of sensual embraces, with every effort made in the style of dancing to appeal to the worst that is in you, and remain unshaken by it. No matter how wary or wise a girl might be — and she has enough things in her daily life in factory and store to teach her — she is not always able to keep up the good fight. It is always a matter of pursuit and capture. The man is ever on the hunt, and the girl is ever needing to flee.40\n\nWhen Beth Lindner Israels wrote these words in 1909, she did not agree with Faulkner that the inevitable end was prostitution, but she did think that girls who regularly went to ballrooms were “apt to lose the bloom of their youth.”41 The danger in the new dances, like the waltz and the twostep, lay in their emphasis on the couple rather than on the social group, so girls had little protection from men’s sexual demands. Of course, for girls seeking romance, this was a major reason for dancing’s attraction. After the Great War, Victorian ideals had mostly disappeared. Love as the basis for a happy marriage had replaced duty and friendship. By the 1920s, magazines were full of advice about how to keep the romance alive in marriage — this was seen as the key to a successful adult life.42 The popularity of the dance hall as a place to find romance continued to rise, and by\n\n32 The Purchase of Instant Intimacy\n\nthe 1930s, when my parents met while dancing, it was a desirable place to socialize and meet new people. In order to learn the new dances, young people needed lessons. The role of the dance teacher was long established, but the beginning of the twentieth century brought a rapid growth in opportunities to teach, partly fueled by the newly affluent middle classes. Dance instructor Arthur Murray began providing mail-order lessons in 1912. By 1925, he and his wife had founded their first studio, and in 1947, their chain was joined by a chain of studios from the Fred Astaire Organization. These two companies still franchise studios in the United States and, in the case of Arthur Murray, in thirteen other countries.43 Ballroom dancing continued in popularity throughout the first half of the twentieth century. New dances were added during this time, with the introduction of swing dancing and with a stream of Latin dances coming from Cuba, via New York. During the 1960s, however, dances such as the twist replaced partner dancing, and clubs replaced ballrooms. Many dance studios fell on hard times during this period, and it was not until the introduction of disco dancing and the hustle in the mid-1970s that a small revival began. Since the seventies, couple dancing has grown slowly in popularity, and some dances have experienced a boom. For example, the lindy hop, a type of swing dancing popular in Harlem in the 1930s and 1940s, began a revival in the late 1980s, starting in Southern California and spreading to the rest of the country.44 Mixed ballroom and Latin dancing has been experiencing a renewed interest due, in part, to the popularity of the television show Dancing with the Stars. College teams had started in Britain in the late 1960s and were popular by the 1980s.45 American colleges soon followed suit, and many now have competition ballroom teams as well as social dance lessons. With the 2005 release of Mad Hot Ballroom, a movie about teaching children to dance in the New York’s public schools, lessons in ballroom and Latin dance have swept across middle schools in America.46 The resurgence of interest in ballroom has been noted in the press.47 The influx of immigrants from places with a strong interest in ballroom, especially from eastern Europe and Asia, contributed to this increase in demand.48 By the beginning of the twenty-first century, the two studio chains, as well as many independent studios, were flourishing. Many eastern European ballroom dancers either immigrated with their families or were recruited to America to staff the growing number of dance studios. As a measure of this increase in popularity, membership in the United States\n\nThe Purchase of Instant Intimacy 33\n\nAmateur Ballroom Dance Association (USABDA) grew from two thousand in 1988 to more than fifteen thousand by 2005.49 Since the early years of ballroom, it has not been just a social activity. Beginning in 1910, when cabaret owners began to introduce ballroom acts, audiences have been willing to pay to watch dancing. The most popular couple in the early years, Irene and Vernon Castle, began dancing in 1912, and they helped professionalize exhibition dancing.50 The social class ramifications of ballroom have been written about elsewhere.51 From the beginning, teachers of dance were at pains to keep dancing respectable. They wanted to distance the popular dances from their origins in Latin America and the new urban neighborhoods of Black America. These origins were tainted with explicit sexuality, which could have jeopardized the developing ballroom profession among middle-class white Americans. Irene Castle noted in her autobiography that she and Vernon were careful not to dance passionately and that their status as a married couple increased their wholesome reputation.52 Even so, in 1914, one year after the Castles returned to the United States and brought the tango with them from Paris, the Vatican denounced it as immoral, along with the equally popular turkey trot.53 This kind of criticism kept the Castles and other teachers ever vigilant. If the Murrays, with their mail-order business and their franchise schools, had standardized social dancing, it was the British who set down the rules for professionals. Philip Richardson chronicled the explicit measures that English dance teachers took to agree on and to document the allowed steps and to remove the lower-class and non-European origins of some dances. Competitions started in England about 1919, and the Blackpool competition began in the 1920s. Concerned about the sexually explicit nature of the non-European dances, about two hundred teachers attended an informal meeting, which Richardson chaired. The participants began to legislate as to the permitted movements. They decried “dubious steps” originating “in low negro haunts” and agreed that there were to be no “dips, lift-ups, lifting of the feet, and other movements unsuitable in the ballroom.”54 They were particularly offended by the tango, which Richardson described as perfected “in the lower haunts”55 of Argentina. They also declared that moving with the feet turned out as in ballet was to be replaced by parallel feet. This “English style” spread throughout the world and is known in America as “international style” to distinguish it from the homegrown American version.56 Standardization continued over the next two decades. For example, Richardson called the rumba a “native dance of Cuba, purely Negroid in\n\n34 The Purchase of Instant Intimacy\n\norigin” and described the battles over which steps were to be allowed.57 When American GIs brought over the jitterbug, the English teachers developed a “not unattractive” version, the jive.58 Today, these dances are performed in more or less the same way as defined then, although constraints on the portrayal of sexual desire have loosened considerably, and technique has become more demanding. Out of these beginnings arose the ballroom and Latin sections of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dance (ISTD). The ISTD had started in 1904 but did not add ballroom to the curriculum until 1924. The ballroom curriculum was encoded in writing by Alex Moore in 1936, with Latin added in 1946.59 To this day, the ISTD offers a curriculum and levels of certification in which teachers can become credentialed.60 This successful decision to routinize the steps of ballroom and Latin dances has not been without controversy, particularly where Latin is concerned. Many people believe that it caused Latin dance to lose its authenticity. For example, one of the most popular Latin dances is the samba. As danced in Latin competition, it involves a pulsating motion, along with many twisting, rotating, and extended body actions. The parade around the floor is an important characteristic of ballroom samba.61 Samba originated in the Bahia region of Brazil but has its roots among the Yoruba of West Africa.62 Samba as practiced in Brazil is often danced solo, and dancers frequently stay in one place. Aficionados of Brazilian samba are quite scornful of the ballroom version, which they view as inauthentic.63 Much has been made of the racial implications of the decisions made by the British developers of the ISTD.64 Richardson’s writing shows a fear of lowering the class standing of ballroom dancing if any suggestion of crudity was allowed. However, the underlying concerns were economic. Dance teachers wanted to make a living. They were typically working class themselves, and it was to their financial benefit to market ballroom dancing as an elegant activity. There was a fine line between the intimacy of partner dancing and a more explicit sexuality, a line which dance teachers were careful not to cross. A second purpose of the strict curriculum was to anoint those who were qualified to teach. Richardson believed that the public would be reassured that ballroom teaching was a professional activity if everyone taught the same curriculum. This concern for credentialing, though only partially successful, has helped maintain the standing and income of teachers. Certification is more complicated in the United States, where a unique American style is taught in addition to international style. The American styles,\n\nThe Purchase of Instant Intimacy 35\n\ncalled “smooth” and “rhythm,” were pioneered by the chain studios, with each chain developing its own curriculum and certification. Independent studios in the United States use a third curriculum, DVIDA, so U.S. professionals may have any of a number of certifications, including ISTD. Regardless of the type of certification (if any), all teachers follow a similar curriculum.\n\nThe Life of a Dance Teacher In the chapters that follow, I argue that in addition to curriculum, intimacy is a crucial part of the dance experience. But what of teachers? What benefits do they get? Just as Phoebe represents students in this chapter, George is a stand-in for teachers. He is an attractive and personable forty-threeyear-old, with a charming southern accent, who has been teaching since he was nineteen. He was in his first year of college when a friend suggested that he might earn additional income teaching ballroom. He started out at a Fred Astaire studio, and as is typical of chains, he quickly began teaching, often finding himself just a few lessons ahead of the students. A former high school sweetheart, Susie, was also teaching at the studio, and George was quickly sold on dancing as a career: I dropped out of college and started to do dancing, because in college I was just having fun, sowing my oats and so forth. The manager who approached me about becoming an instructor . . . said, “George, you know there are some people who like the security of knowing that they show up for the job, they’re there for so many hours a day, and they make such and such a week. I like knowing that through my own efforts I can make as little as a few hundred dollars, or I could make as much as a few thousand dollars a week, but it’s all up to me.” He said, “How do you like dancing? Do you like traveling?”\n\nThis lifestyle appealed to George, but he saw other advantages also: “I saw that after four years of college, I would have the credentials to get my foot in the door and maybe begin to learn something about this trade or that trade. In the dancing,” he added, “I could learn the skill as I was going . . . and make money doing it.” To teach dance with so little experience was intimidating at first, but George is gregarious: “chatting with people and being with people of all\n\n36\n\nThe Purchase of Instant Intimacy\n\nages was nothing that made me nervous.” George is a master of instant intimacy. When I first met him at a competition, he was teasing and joking with me in no time as if we knew each other well. Later, when I visited his studio to interview him, he greeted me like an old friend. When he first started teaching, George said, he “felt inadequate in a lot of the different dances,” but then he added, “I considered myself a professional pretty soon, because I knew more than most people.” He was “doing it for four to six hours a day training,” so he quickly jumped ahead of students who were taking one or two lessons per week. Susie, who became George’s wife, was a major source of encouragement and an antidote to the reaction of his parents. George was the youngest of five in a working-class family and the only child to attend college. His father was upset with George’s decision to leave college before graduating. His father, George said, “had the idea that I wanted to be the best dancer in the world, and he’s looking at things realistically. I’m already nineteen, and I haven’t had all this training. He didn’t see the business side.” However, by age twenty-five, George and his wife owned a Fred Astaire franchise, and George described his father as now proud of him. George and Susie had struggled to make this happen, even sleeping in a small studio office at one point. Dancing provided George with a life of recognition and glamour that he had never imagined would be his. To become a business owner at age twenty-five with only a high school education was a heady experience. By the time they bought the studio, George had entered the world of DanceSport competition.65 This happened soon after he first learned to dance: Susie was the best girl there. I was the newest guy. She decided that we should dance together, so that she could help me to learn quickly. . . . There was a competition . . . three months from the day I started training, and she said, “We’re going to it.” I was so nervous, but I worked really hard, I mean, ’til four in the morning at times. . . . We got second place, but then, the nine competitions after that we got first place.\n\nAt Fred Astaire competitions, the level of dancing was lower than at national ones, where professional dancers have many years of experience. George explained that Fred Astaire had a “novice category” for teachers with less than a year of instruction. George felt proud that they had won at a national Fred Astaire competition early in their partnership. He quickly became hooked on American smooth and began competing in top national\n\nThe Purchase of Instant Intimacy 37\n\nevents. George explained that he loved smooth the best, “the oneness of it.” He realized that “there’s oneness in Latin and rhythm as well” but added, “When you’re sailing around the room and you’re one body, when it feels like a ride, it’s just a neat feeling.” In focusing on the nondancing motives for dancing, it i"
