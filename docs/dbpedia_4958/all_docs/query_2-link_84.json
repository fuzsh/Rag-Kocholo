        "text": "After days of using his Instagram account to keep his followers abreast of the minute-by-minute changes happing in Ukraine amid the Russian invasion, Maksim Chmerkovskiy has decided it’s time for him to try and leave the country after a close brush with the police.\n\nThe Dancing With the Stars coach shared a new update on Monday via a video on his Instagram account announcing that it’s time for him to go. “The streets are crazy. At one point I got arrested but again all good, promise,” he said. “That was probably the least traumatizing moment in this whole thing as far as Ukraine is concerned, but for me, it was just a reality check.” Chmerkovskiy did not elaborate on what led to his arrest, however, he encouraged his fans not to panic if he starts posting less and “disappears for a while” as he attempts to flee Ukraine. He continued, “I’m going to try and make my way out. I’m going to start making my way towards the border. I have options. Just a little nervous but I think it’s going to be alright. I know it’s going to be okay.” Chmerkovskiy’s plans to leave Ukraine might be more difficult than he originally anticipated, however, as on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky declared that it is forbidden for male citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 to leave the country.\n\nThe professional dancer also posted an emotional video on Sunday night about the state of Ukraine while sharing a handful of videos on his Instagram Stories of the explosions and destruction happening all around him in the country’s capital. “I’m in a very safe place but this is nuts and I think everybody is going through a lot of emotions and I think it’s time I expose mine in a more personal manner,” Chmerkovskiy confessed while on the verge of tears. “This is a war. This is a crazy situation. It’s insane and I’m losing my final little things. This is not a cry for help. I’m a big boy. I can handle myself…but I’m starting to not be able to just sort of keep my head.” He added that he’s grateful for everyone’s thoughts and prayers and for helping to spread the word about what’s currently happening in Ukraine, but concluded, “The reality is, I just want to go home. I’m just hoping for a safe ending to it all.”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair"
