        "text": "Dancing With the Stars‘ Maksim Chmerkovskiy will star in a Ukranian version of The Bachelor, he announced on his blog.\n\n“First thing first. I AM doing the Ukrainian version of our Bachelor. The fact that I’ve turned down the American version has NOTHING to do with my ‘dislike’ of American women. (The statement is so absurd that I can’t believe I’m even dignifying it with a reply),” wrote Chmerkovskiy.\n\nThe dancer, who came in third place on the ABC hit with partner Brandy last season, listed his reasons for doing the show: he’s “truly tired” from so much dancing, producers convinced him he could find “the one,” the first season will be the “most real” and he thinks he can “give back” to his native country.\n\nThe biggest reason? “This is the first thing in a VERY LONG TIME that I’m doing something for ME. For the first time, I don’t really care what people think. The first time that I’m not being ‘judged’, ‘placed’ or ‘criticized,’ be blogged."
