        "text": "Maks & Val will foxtrot across the stage this Saturday at Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall. Unless, of course, Val misses his tour bus — again.\n\nIt could happen, jokes brother Maks.\n\n“Val is probably going to miss a couple of buses,” Maks says about their new dance tour. “And we’re going to have to scramble to get to the next show. So we’re anticipating that.”\n\nVal defends himself against his older brother’s taunting. Don’t worry, he says, they’ll make it to Fort Myers on time.\n\nBesides, he says, he’s only missed ONE tour bus in their entire dancing career. But his brother won’t ever let him forget it.\n\n“It happened one time,” Val says and laughs. “And she was worth it!”\n\nAnyone who watches “Dancing with the Stars” knows that the hunky, passionate Chmerkovskiy brothers constantly poke fun at each other -- just like brothers tend to do. But the fleet-footed Maksim and Valentin can also be very entertaining.\n\nNow Maks & Val are bringing that same playfulness to Mann Hall for a night of glitzy costumes, ballroom dancing and their inspiring life story. There’s even a little hip-hop.\n\n“It’s a beautiful thing,” Val says about the show. “My motivation is to do for ballroom dancing what ‘Hamilton’ is doing for Broadway.\n\n“We want to add a different twist to this regal, classical genre and give it an authentic story that came from New York City, from Eastern Europe, and ended up in Hollywood. People are really gonna like it.”\n\nJust don’t expect stories or dance numbers from “Dancing with the Stars.” Instead, “Maks & Val Live On Tour: Our Way” focuses on what happened before the ballroom champions first appeared on the hit ABC reality show.\n\n“We don’t want any sort of tell-all,” Maks says. “We don’t want to talk about names, people, who’s your favorite partner, who’s your least favorite partner.\n\n“The thing is, everybody that followed ‘Dancing with the Stars’ and saw us among the rest of the pros, they know THAT story. But every sort of confusing choice of words by Maks and interesting choice of actions by Val, where does that come from?”\n\nBoth brothers were born in Ukraine and immigrated to Brooklyn in 1994 with their family. The new show talks about their upbringing, their parents, their early dance successes and the two cultures that shaped them.\n\n“It’s an interesting paradox, and I think it’s a beautiful dichotomy: Ballroom dancing being performed by Eastern European Jews from Brooklyn, New York,” Maks says. “We feel really comfortable doing the foxtrot in a three-piece suit to Frank Sinatra’s ‘My Way.’ But literally, half an hour later, we are even more comfortable putting on a hoodie and listening to some ‘Juicy’ by Notorious B.I.G.”\n\nIn fact, one number in the show brings both those songs together into a mash-up. “It’s a piece of choreography like nothing you’ve seen before,” Maks promises.\n\nThe brothers and a team of professionals will be doing all the dancing onstage at Mann Hall. Expect hip-hop, foxtrot, Latin and other dance styles.\n\n“It’s going to be us and how strange and weird we are,” Maks says. “We do foxtrot and say outrageous things. So that’s us.\n\n“Everything’s a mash-up… We’re not a type. We don’t have a type.”\n\nDon’t let the brothers’ constant ribbing fool you, either. They really do love each other, they say.\n\n“Maks and I, metaphorically and actually literally, shared a bunk bed as grown men,” Val says. “I don’t know if that should be revealed to the public, but there is some separation anxiety.”\n\nTheir parents constantly told the brothers to “love each other, love each other, love each other,” and Maks says it’s impossible to shake that conditioning.\n\n“We’re just a product of our parenting, and they just brainwashed us into loving each other unconditionally for the rest of our lives,” he says. “So if somebody keeps telling you do that from a very early age ... you have to do that, whether you like it or not.”\n\nVal says there’s no escaping it.\n\n“It’s like a Pavlov’s dog,” he says. “Every time he comes around, I feel love and I don’t know why!”\n\nThe brothers hope to dazzle audiences with their new show and also motivate them with their life story.\n\n“We want someone to walk out and go, ‘Damn, man, that’s inspiring!’” Maks says. “‘They’ve gone through a lot of things, and they’ve persevered.’”\n\nThe brothers have performed at Mann Hall before, but they said they’re particularly excited about this tour. It’s more personal.\n\n“I can’t wait to bring it to Fort Myers,” Val says, “and share the stage with my grumpy brother Maks.”\n\nMaks ignores that comment and goes for a joke, instead.\n\n“I’m not excited at all,” Maks says, playing it straight. Then he bursts into laughter. “I’m kidding! I’m kidding!”\n\nConnect with this reporter: Charles Runnells (News-Press) (Facebook) or @charlesrunnells (Twitter)\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: “Maks & Val Live On Tour: Our Way”\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Saturday\n\nWhere: Barbara B.
