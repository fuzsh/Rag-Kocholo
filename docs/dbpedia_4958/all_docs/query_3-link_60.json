        "text": "Getty Images\n\nLast week, on the orders of President Vladimir Putin, Russia began an invasion of Ukraine by air, land, and sea.\n\nMany celebrities took to social media to show their support for Ukraine, which has a population of 44 million and is the second-largest country in Europe.\n\nFor information on how to help those suffering in Ukraine and elsewhere, visit RedCross.org.\n\nAmong the stars to speak out was Ashton Kutcher, who is married to Ukrainian-born Mila Kunis, tweeted, ‚ÄúI stand with Ukraine.‚Äù\n\nRyan Reynolds and Blake Lively have pledged up to $1 million toward Ukrainian relief. Join them in donating to the UN here: UNRefugees.org.\n\nOn Thursday, Angelina Jolie wrote on Instagram, \"Like many of you, I'm praying for the people in Ukraine. My focus along with my @refugees colleagues is that everything possible is done to ensure the protection and basic human rights of those displaced, and refugees in the region. We have already seen reports of casualties and people starting to flee their homes to seek safety. It is too soon to know what will happen, but the significance of this moment ‚Äî for the people of Ukraine, and for the international rule of law ‚Äî cannot be overstated.\"\n\nIn another post, Jolie pointed out that \"50,000 people have fled Ukraine in less than 48 hours.\"\n\nUkrainian-born Milla Jovovich posted her anguish, writing: \"I am heartbroken and dumbstruck trying to process the events of this week in my birthplace of Ukraine. My country and people being bombed. Friends and family in hiding. My blood and my roots come from both Russia and Ukraine. I am torn in two as I watch the horror unfolding, the country being destroyed, families being displaced, their whole life lying in charred fragments around them. I remember the war in my father‚Äôs homeland of former Yugoslavia and the stories my family tells of the trauma and terror they experienced. War. Always war. Leaders who cannot bring peace. The never ending juggernaut of imperialism. And always, the people pay in bloodshed and tears.\"\n\nWaiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n\nMiley Cyrus took to her Instagram Story, writing, \"This morning was heartbreaking waking up to the news that Ukraine had been invaded. I had the most incredible experience filming 'Nothing Breaks Like a Heart' in Kyiv, and I will be forever grateful to the local community who welcomed me with open arms... I am standing in solidarity with everyone in Ukraine who is affected by this attack and with our global community who is calling for an immediate end to this violence.\"\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger tweeted, \"My thoughts are with the Ukrainian people. I have been asked to do several interviews, but I believe the news should continue to focus on what‚Äôs happening on the ground ‚Äî on the tragedy that has broken our hearts and on the courage of the Ukrainian people that has inspired us.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nBoxing Legends Vitali & Wladimir Klitschko Are Ready to Fight for Ukraine\n\nView Story\n\nSchwarzenegger also praised boxing legends Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko, who are planning to fight for Ukraine if the war continues.\n\nEiza Gonz√°lez wrote on her Instagram Story, \"What is happening in Ukraine at the moment is so utterly devastating. It's grotesque to witness what one man's ambition and ego can account for. I'm praying for everyone suffering and so angered and distraught by the state of the world. My heart goes out to the people trapped in this horrific situation.\"\n\nGigi Hadid took to the same social platform, writing, \"My heart is hurting for the Ukraine and all those affected by this unimaginable reality. Putin's actions are a threat to every Democratic country in the world and must be stopped. I pray that the support other countries provide can give the Ukrainians what they have voted for and deserve. Peace. Peace. Peace. HANDS OFF UKRAINE.\"\n\nMadonna shared a fan-made video using images from her \"Sorry\" music video with scenes of devastation in Ukraine, and that includes a juxtaposition of Vladimir Putin with Adolf Hitler. She wrote, \"Russia‚Äôs Pointless and Greed Driven Invasion Of the Ukraine MUST be stopped!! Please Send in Humanitarian Aid to help millions of citizens of the Ukraine who‚Äôs lives are being affected by this CRISIS at this very moment !! Putin has Violated Every Human Rights Accord in Existence. Putin has no right to try to erase the existence of the Ukraine. We support you President Zelensky!! We are praying for you and your country! üôèüèº. God Bless You All! Lets not feel helpless when confronted by Geo-political Actions of this magnitude.\" She included a link to an article offering ways to help Ukraine.\n\nSophia Bush shared a photo of Russian citizens denouncing Vladimir Putin‚Äôs ‚Äúbloodthirsty aggressions.‚Äù She wrote, ‚ÄúIn Russia, you can be jailed for 5 years for protesting. Many protestors were attacked and beaten by security forces. And still, these people gathered in solidarity and chanted 'No to war.' 'Shame!' and 'Ukraine is not our enemy!' People standing up to power change the world. There is a lot of pain and terror going on, and I‚Äôve linked lots of news in my stories. But here, I wanted to share with you all the vision of hope that brought tears to my eyes last night. United we stand.‚Äù\n\nShe added, ‚ÄúI send all my love and solidarity to Ukraine and everyone in Russia condemning what Putin is doing. I believe in us. Even in times of terror, I really do. #—è–Ω–µ–º–æ–ª—á—É ü§çüôèüèº.‚Äù\n\nAshley Judd showed her support of Ukraine with a series of photos from her trip with UNFPA. She wrote on Instagram, ‚ÄúLook at these halcyon images from my trip with @UNFPA supporting girls and women survivors of sexual and gender based violence from the earlier conflict in the east, who found resilience and tenacity with psych social support, and now are terrorized by the abject lunacy of this violent mayhem. My heart is wretched as together we hold both the fear and community hope that the sexual autonomy and rights of girls and women will be safe during this deranged violence. I fell in love with the families who hosted me, who fed me borscht from their garden plots, who shared their rope swings over creeks, who invited me for rest in wild flower strewn meadows. My most urgent thoughts are with all the people of Ukraine, for those cower, and those who senselessly agress, too. May all violence cease, at the level of action and at the level of thought. Thank you @UNFPA for standing with the sexual and reproductive health of vulnerable girls and women in conflict. #ukraine.\"\n\nShannen Doherty posted a photo from Ukraine and wrote on Instagram, \"This is happening now. Pay attention. Speak up. I can‚Äôt believe celebrities and influencers are posting about their latest success or newest bag when children, fathers, mothers, sons, daughters are being killed. While I realize that there is a limit to what social media can accomplish, I also think it can do much more than simply being a self serving platform. Ukraine I am praying for you Ukraine. #Ukraine #peaceforall.\"\n\nJamie Lee Curtis reposted a photo taken by photographer Alex Lourie, who shared a photo of a woman named Helena, who was ‚Äúsliced by a falling shard of mirror.‚Äù\n\nLourie wrote on Instagram, ‚ÄúRussia has invaded Ukraine. On the first morning of the invasion, they bombed a civilian apartment complex in Chuihiv, near Kharkiv.‚Äù\n\nLuke Evans posted another photo of Helena, adding, ‚ÄúThis is what war does, this woman‚Äôs face shows the hurt, the pain and the suffering and the misery it causes to the innocent caught in the middle. All in the name of what?? Archaic ideology and a complete ignorance of where we actually are, as a human race, in 2022!! #ukraine #stopthewar #pleasestop üíî.‚Äù\n\nMayim Bialik posted a photo of soldiers. She wrote, ‚ÄúI'll be off social media as the invasion of Ukraine unfolds. My thoughts and heart are with all of those impacted by war, divisiveness and violence.‚Äù\n\nKatheryn Winnick posted a photo of herself taken some time ago at the Motherland Monument in Ukraine.\n\nWaiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n\nOn her Instagram Story, Winnick wrote, \"I woke up this morning with texts from my Ukrainian family & friends saying 'it has begun.' Some fleeing, some taking shelter underground & some stayin to fight. We are a peaceful country. We do not deserve this war. #IStandWithUkraine.\"\n\nRegina Spektor posted a childhood photo of herself on a float ‚Äúduring a May 9th celebration in the former USSR.‚Äù She stressed the importance of celebrating peace on that day, emphasizing, ‚ÄúToday my heart hurts because no matter how many great works of art and music (Guernica‚Ä¶. Masters Of War‚Ä¶ Most of Okudzhava and Vysotsky‚Ä¶ Vonnegut‚Ä¶ Remarque‚Ä¶ all those films in all those languages‚Ä¶) portray the horrors of war, new Masters of War seem to rise up again in all the nations‚Ä¶ Sending new children to slaughter each other‚Ä¶ Yes there‚Äôs nothing funny about Peace, Love and Understanding‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so needed right now. There were, and still are, real Nazis in the world. But in Ukraine that are just millions of civilians being pulled into a war, and in Russia there are children being sent to fight and die for no reason other than the bottomless and horror filled ‚Äúmore more more more more more more‚Äù of politicians and corporations. And it‚Äôs terrifying‚Ä¶ this part of being a grownup sucks. Being this aware of how endless these circles seem to be.‚Äù\n\nWaiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n\nMaksim Chmerkovskiy is still in the center of Kyiv as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues.\n\nThe dance pro posted a series of updates on Instagram, as his wife Peta Murgatroyd prayed for his safety and asked fans to do the same.\n\nMaks Chmerkovskiy Gives ‚ÄòDire‚Äô Update on Ukraine, Peta Asks for Prayers\n\nView Story\n\nMaks, who had earlier said he was headed to a bomb shelter, posted a video saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm safe. We haven‚Äôt been told to move and I‚Äôm just following instructions. That‚Äôs all I can say.‚Äù\n\nMaks' brother Valentine wrote on Instagram, \"My parents fled this country for this exact reason. Not because it wasn't good to them, but because their kids would see war eventually. It's a cruel irony that 28 years later my brother [Maksim] is in a bombshelter in Kiev. If they hadn't left I would be on the front lines defending my home right now. And the most heartbreaking thing of all I would be either killing or dying at the hands of my fellow brothers. The Russian people don't want this!! We stood by each others side. We loved and celebrated one another. I speak Russian yes but make no mistake about it, I am a proud Ukranian and now the world will finally know the difference. Slava Ukraini all day every day! And to all my Russian friends this might be the best and only time t stand up to your dictator.\"\n\nPop act AJR has canceled its upcoming concert in Russia, which was set for October. They tweeted, ‚ÄúWe are sad to announce that we will be cancelling our upcoming show in Russia. Thank you to our Russian fans who oppose their country‚Äôs unprovoked and criminal behavior. Our hearts are with the people of Ukraine. At this point, the best thing you can do is share ACCURATE info.‚Äù\n\nThe statement went on, ‚ÄúThe EBU is an apolitical member organization of broadcasters committed to upholding the values of public service. We remain dedicated to protecting the values of a cultural competition which promotes international exchange and understanding, brings audiences together, celebrates diversity through music and unites Europe on one stage.‚Äù"
