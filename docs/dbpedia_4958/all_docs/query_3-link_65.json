        "text": "DWTS' Kym Johnson taken to hospital in ambulance\n\nDancing With the Stars pro dancer Kym Johnson had a scare today when she was rushed to the hospital after taking a nasty fall.\n\nBlame it on Friday the 13th? Kym Johnson, 34, and her dancing partner, Hines Ward, had an accident while rehearsing today for their Dancing With the Stars performance.\n\nJohnson, a pro dancer on the show, reportedly had an accident during rehearsals. An ambulance was called on location and Johnson was taken out in a stretcher with an oxygen mask on her face, reports E! Online.\n\nSources say she was rushed to a local Los Angeles hospital for treatment. ABC Entertainment spokeswoman Amy Astley said that she \"was taken to the hospital for precautionary measures, to assure she is OK.\"\n\n\"She's doing OK,\" her rep was quoted as saying to E! News. \"Better safe than sorry.\"\n\nJohnson and her dancing partner, NFL athlete Hines Ward, have gotten good reviews throughout the season -- and no word yet on how this accident will affect their upcoming performance.\n\nRalph Macchio suffered a ruptured knee cyst and tendonitis last week, however, he made it into the final four despite a shaky performance. Kirstie Alley and Chelsea Kane round out the final four on Dancing With the Stars.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nDancing With the Stars semifinals: Chelsea Kane dances to the top\n\nDancing With the Stars hit the semifinals round this week, forcing each dancer to bring their A-game in three different dances. Once again it was Chelsea Kane edging past Hines Ward on the leader board.\n\nThe semifinals of Dancing With the Starsgave Hines Ward, Kirstie Alley, Chelsea Kane and Ralph Macchio a chance to dance three different dances -- two choreographed numbers and a cha cha cha presented in group form. Once their individual dances were completed, there was a cha cha cha to the death. We know, it gets confusing at this point in the competition. Here's how the contestants stacked up as they inched closer to the mirror ball trophy.\n\nChelsea Kane and Mark Ballas crept to the top of the leader board with a fancy-footed Argentine tango and a rumba that Len Goodman felt very strongly about: \"Tonight, you have fulfilled your potential. You're there!\" He was really loving Chelsea Kane tonight.\n\nEveryone was wondering how Kym Johnson and Hines Ward would do after her tragic fall that we saw over and over and over again. Well, second place and a perfect 30 on their Argentine tango tells us exactly how she was doing. We have to make mention of Bruno Tonioli's take on their Argentine tango: \"Every emotion was out there for the taking. The battle of will between the man and the woman. Who's going to be the dominant partner? Ah, it was like group sex -- you never want it to end!\" Wow, Bruno, wow. Did we also mention they got a perfect 30 on their salsa?\n\nKirstie Alley's Viennese waltz was beautiful and special. There was nothing ordinary about it. She killed the paso doble and ate the floor alive with her passion. Again, another quote from Bruno: \"That wasn't a paso doble, that was Dance Trek 12, the Wrath of Kirstie! You were really going like a force of nature!\" We loved him last night! Kirstie Alley is pulling in high scores like mad lately, so she could be the dark horse.\n\nWe really thought Ralph Macchio was going to pull it together, but somehow he ended up just bellow Kirstie Alley on the bottom of the leader board. His and Karina Smirnoff's Argentine tango was lifeless at some points while his salsa was a bit too out there! Not sure what's happened to him over the weeks .\n\nThe cha cha cha for bonus points was weird, but here it goes. Hines Ward and Kym Johnson went against Ralph Macchio and Karina Smirnoff with Ward taking the round.\n\nNext, it was Kirstie Alley and Maks Chmerkovskiy against Mark Ballas and Chelsea Kane with Kane taking the round.\n\nSo, you know what that means: Hines Ward and Kym Johnson went against Chelsea Kane and Mark Ballas in a winner-takes-all battle for 15 extra points. Chelsea Kane and Mark Ballas snagged those points up, which is how they ended up so high on the leader board.\n\nWhat did you think of the Dancing With the Stars semifinals round?\n\n↧\n\nDancing With the Stars finale set: Hines Ward, Chelsea Kane and Kirstie Alley\n\nThe Dancing With the Stars finale is set! Were you sad to see Ralph Macchio wouldn't be a part of it?\n\nBefore we tell you how the Dancing With the Stars finale was decided, can we mention the awesome musical guests that were on the results show?\n\nHow crazy was it seeing Stevie Nicks on the most watched reality show? She is pure music royalty. It was also pretty fantastic watching Ne-Yo and Pitbull perform the hit song -- Give Me Everything!\n\nOn to the results! Hines Ward and Kym Johnson scored the first perfect 30 of the season -- and they did it twice! Despite Kym Johnson's nasty tumble that put her in the hospital, they secured a spot in the finals. Release the terrible towels all you Pittsburgh Steelers fans!\n\nLeader board hogs, Chelsea Kane and Mark Ballas, also managed to score a spot in the finals! That is going to make a showdown we can't wait to see. Not that Kirstie Alley and Maks Chmerkovskiy -- who also moved on -- aren't competitors, but Ward and Kane have gone head-to-head this season in high scores.\n\nNow that you know Hines Ward, Chelsea Kane and Kirstie Alley are set to battle for the mirror ball trophy, you might notice we didn't mention Ralph Macchio's name. That's because the Karate Kid didn't chop his way to the finals.\n\nWhat do you think of the dancers America chose for the Dancing With the Stars finale? Were you sad to see Ralph Macchio eliminated?\n\n↧\n\nDancing With the Stars finals recap: Hines Ward, Chelsea Kane on top!\n\nThe race for the Dancing With the Stars mirror ball trophy is pretty much over. Chelsea Kane, Kirstie Alley and Hines Ward left no stone unturned as they pulled out all the stops in a booty-shaking, hip-swirling finale that was highly entertaining. All that's left to do is crown the champion.\n\nChelsea Kane, Kirstie Alley and Hines Ward left it all on theDancing With the Stars floor in a final showdown for the trophy. The finalists were tasked at taking on two dances -- judges' choice and the popular freestyle dance. Here's how it all went down.\n\nChelsea Kane and Mark Ballas danced a samba that Carrie Anna Inaba said was, \"Hot! Hot! Hot!\" It was interesting to see the modern twists that Ballas added into the choreography. Their freestyle was what we were really waiting for because Mark Ballas always takes risks with his freestyles. It was all that and more. They rode out on a bike and then hit the floor hard with funk and hip hop and all kinds of crazy moves. We can't even quote Carrie Ann Inaba because she was so excited her words didn't really transfer into full sentences. They got a perfect 10 for that dance!\n\nKirstie Alley danced her samba right after Chelsea Kane wiped the floor with hers, so we give her credit for following someone who Brooke Burke pointed out was \"born in 1988.\" Way to make Kirstie Alley feel old. It felt like the judges were being kind and tiptoeing around the fact that it was a bit bland. They took the lift approach to their freestyle. We saw where Maks was going with this one. He added technical moves and lifts to prove she could do them -- and it really worked. Len Goodman made a good point, \"You gotta risk it if you want the biscuit.\" Wait, what?\n\nHines Ward and Kym Johnson danced a quick step that left us wondering why there wasn't smoke coming off their heels. How does he make his feet look like they're on air? He must get those moves from the football field. Len Goodman rained on our Hines Ward parade, but that's okay because everyone else loved him. The duo promised something never seen before in their freestyle dance and we got it -- a football halftime show on DWTS! Their whole freestyle centered around a football halftime show and it was marvelous. They even had drummers and their moves were pretty killer too. Carrie Ann Inaba said it wasn't a halftime show, \"It was the whole damn Super Bowl!\"\n\nAs it stands going into the results show Tuesday night, where they'll dance one more dance, Hines Ward and Chelsea Kane are tied with 59 and Kirstie Alley only trails slightly with 54.\n\nWho do you think is going to take the Dancing With the Stars mirror ball trophy?\n\n↧\n\nKirstie Alley has lost 38 inches on DWTS!\n\nKirstie Alley has danced away the pounds on this season of Dancing With the Stars. In fact, the 60-year-old has reportedly lost an amazing 38 inches since starting the show!\n\nThe incredible shrinking Kirstie Alley! The same costume that Kirstie wore on the premiere of Dancing With the Stars had to be taken in 38 inches for her to wear it again on the season finale! Alley and her dancing partner, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, will perform the same cha-cha they performed on opening night.\n\n\"We are constantly taking in and altering Kirstie's costumes,\" designer Randall Christensen said. \"Isn't she looking incredible?!\"\n\nSo, how much weight has she lost? \"There will be some reveal of that at some point, but I really didn't care,\" she said. \"As long as I kept changing and changing and changing, I really didn't care. It was like, keep whittling, whittling, whittling. And the other thing that's really more significant to me -- I mean, I love the whittling, I like being skinny -- I'm really strong and really agile and it gave me a new life.\"\n\nWhether she takes home the trophy tonight or not, it sounds like Alley has won the war on her weight!\n\nThe winner of Dancing With the Stars will be revealed tonight! Kirstie Alley, Chelsea Kane and Hines Ward are the final three! Who do you want to win?\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nWill Nancy O'Dell sign on for next year's DWTS?\n\nWho better to weigh in on tonight's Dancing With the Stars finale than a former contestant? Nancy O'Dell, the new co-anchor of Entertainment Tonight, spoke with SheKnows this afternoon about who she thinks will be victorious, and if another try at Dancing is in her future.\n\nNancy O'Dell's dream of competing on the eighth season of Dancing With the Stars was cut short by a knee injury in the early weeks of training. Now that she's back on her feet, the new co-host of Entertainment Tonight and spokesperson for the Hershey Center for Health & Nutrition's Moderation Nation campaign is weighing in on who will take home the mirror ball trophy tonight!\n\nWhen asked if she would consider going for Dancing With the Stars again, Nancy told SheKnows that concerns for her knee outweigh her desire to give it a try. \"You know, I had to have surgery on my knee, so I always think, 'Oh my God, what if I got injured again?' That would be really embarrassing if I had to pull out again.\"\n\nNancy continued, \"And I'm a little afraid. My meniscus was shredded in my knee, which isn't a corrective surgery they can do. They have to remove the torn tissue because it can catch on your knee. I think, 'Gosh, what if it happened again and they had to remove more?'\"\n\n\"It'd be fun to try it again but I don't know,\" Nancy added. \"There's a lot of injuries these days!\"\n\nNancy O'Dell's prediction for the Dancing With the Stars winner? She says, \"I think it's going to be Hines Ward. I was going to say Kirstie, she has a big fan base and a lot of people pulling for her, but I think Hines is the best dancer in the group.\"\n\nThanks to Nancy O'Dell for chatting with us. We'll find out tonight if her Dancing With the Stars winner prediction is correct!\n\nTHERE'S MORE DWTS HAPPENING HERE:\n\nDancing With the Stars finals recap: Hines Ward, Chelsea Kane on top!\n\nKirstie Alley has lost 38 inches on DWTS!\n\nDancing With the Stars: Hines Ward discusses his emotions\n\n↧\n\nDancing With the Stars: Hines Ward wins mirror ball trophy!\n\nThe race for the mirror ball trophy was finally decided on the Dancing With the Stars results show, as Hines Ward was crowned the new champion.\n\nAnother season of Dancing With the Stars has come and gone. With that brings a new mirror ball trophy champion -- Hines Ward.\n\nBefore he was crowned champion there was fun to be had. It wouldn't be a Dancing With the Stars finale results show without electric acts like the Black Eyed Peas and the return of booted dancers like Mike Catherwood, Kendra Wilkinson and Petra Nemcova.\n\nNemcova performed a beautiful waltz to Raise Me Up and got a special surprise -- Josh Groban. He flew in just to surprise her! It was a Kodak moment as she genuinely looked shocked.\n\nOkay, that was all fine and dandy but there were results to be dealt out.\n\nHow did it all go down? Well, Hines Ward and Chelsea Kane went into the results show tied at the top of the leader board with Kirstie Alley trailing slightly behind. They had one dance left, leaving it up to the judges to impact their scores from Monday night.\n\nAll the couples had to perform their favorite from the season. It was the night of perfect scores -- all of them got a 30.\n\nChelsea Kane and Mark Ballas flawlessly danced the Harry Potter-esque Viennese waltz from earlier in the season, while Kirstie Alley and Maks Chmerkovskiy reprised their cha cha cha from week one. Our pick -- Hines Ward and Kym Johnson -- took on their hot samba.\n\nThe first couple eliminated was Chelsea Kane and Mark Ballas, coming in third place. It was a true shock to see them not come in at least in second place.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers great Hines Ward and his partner Kym Johnson edged out Kirstie Alley and Maks Chmerkovskiy to take the mirror ball trophy.\n\nWhat did you think of this season of Dancing With the Stars?\n\n↧\n\nMaksim Chmerkovskiy quitting Dancing With the Stars?\n\nPro dancer Maksim Chmerkovskiy, who danced with Kirstie Alley this season, says this may be his last year of Dancing With the Stars. Say it isn’t so!\n\nHunky Ukrainian dancer Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Kirstie Alley lost this season's Dancing With the Stars to Hines Ward and Kym Johnson -- and he hints he may be hanging up his dancing shoes for good.\n\n\"It takes a lot out of you. When you invest that much of you into something that's supposed to be just work you [can] get misinterpreted. I don't know [if I'm coming back]. We'll see. Right now, I'm drained,\" Maks told AOL News.\n\nThe dancer, who was linked to his partner Erin Andrews last year and participated in the Ukrainian version of The Bachelor, wants to branch out. He says he would like to open up his own dance studio!\n\nMany DWTS pros have moved on after a successful stint on the show, including siblings Julianne Hough and Derek Hough. Maks, however, has yet to win the mirror ball trophy -- so has he given up that hope?\n\nNo official word from ABC, however, Kirstie Alley tweeted: \"You PROS have become STARS in your own RIGHT... U should be REVERED as such!!! In my book u are IRREPLACEABLE!!!!\"\n\n↧\n\nKirstie Alley reams David Letterman for fat jokes\n\nKirstie Alley took David Letterman to task for years of fat jokes at her expense.\n\nKirstie Alley has a great sense of humor, and she showed it last night when she good-naturedly reamed David Letterman for all the fat jokes he has made about her.\n\n\"I thought you loved me madly and then you talked about me being sort of chub,\" Alley said to the Late Show host.\n\nA newly slim Alley then took out a written list of some of the worst offenders and started reading.\n\n\"Kirstie Alley is joining Dancing with the Stars,\" the actress said. \"If you don't already own one, now might be a good time to get a wide-screen TV.\"\n\n\"Last night on Dancing with the Stars, Kirstie Alley fell on the dance floor. ...How many of you felt it?\" she continued. \"However, the judges scored her an 8 -- on the Richter scale.\"\n\nDavid Letterman gave an equally humorous apology.\n\n\"We do love you, and if you were skinny we would tell jokes about you. ... Ehh, probably not,\" he said.\n\nWatch Kirstie Alley on David Letterman:\n\nImage courtesy HRC/ WENN.com\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nKirstie Alley weight loss tally: 100 pounds!\n\nKirstie Alley was seen at New York Fashion Week looking slim and trim after losing 100 pounds. Check out her amazing weight loss photo below. Alley talks about her amazing weight loss and plastic surgery rumors.\n\nFans were stunned to see Kirstie Alley lose 38 inches in 10 weeks while competing on Dancing with the Stars– and now the 60-year-old actress reveals she has lost even more weight since the show ended. \"I've lost 100 pounds,\" she told reporters.\n\nAlley showed off her newly slim physique during the Zang Toi fashion show. Alley closed the show by walking down the runway in a blue rinestoned-studded gown.\n\n\"I feel like I'm back in my element,\" said the actress, who topped the scales at 228 at her heaviest. \"I honestly didn't even realize what I looked like.\"\n\nShe said she is enjoying her new size 4 figure. \"I have a lot more strength and stamina!\"Kirstie said, crediting DWTS. \"It's given me a new view of what I want to do in my life.\"\n\nDoes Kirstie plan on getting plastic surgery to go along with her rockin' bod? \"I haven't had plastic surgery and here's the reason: People do plastic surgery to make you look younger,\" she says. \"I don't think it makes you look younger. I think it can make you look weirder.\"\n\n↧\n\nKirstie Alley a size 4? Puh-lease says Tim Gunn\n\nKirstie Alley says she is now a size 4. Fashion critic Tim Gunn isn't buying it however, and is calling the actress out on her size statements while giving a lesson on a sneaky technique known as 'vanity sizing.'\n\nTim Gunn isn't falling for Kirstie Alley's claims that she's lost 100 pounds and now wears a size 4 dress. The Project Runway fashion consultant famous for telling contestants to 'make it work' is putting size in perspective for anyone willing to listen.\n\nEstimating Kirstie Alley's actual dress size Tim Gunn told Steve Kramer's morning radio show, \"I think she's between an 8 and a 10.\"\n\nYet it may not be all Kirstie Alley's fault her sizing is off. The actress shared previously, \"Before Dancing with the Stars, I bought these dresses from size 14 to 4... all the same dress, and I said, 'You know what I really want? I really wanna be in this dress in a 4.'\"\n\nTim Gunn explains, \"There is a phenomenon out there right now that I call the lying deceptive shell game of vanity sizing. In fact a 4 is really a 6 or an 8.\" The 58-year-old has even done an experiment to prove his 'vanity sizing' theory. He shares, \"We took a size 8 dress from 1980 one from 1990 and one from 2000 and compared them and the difference was two and a half inches in the waist alone!\"\n\nSo though the tag inside Kirstie Alley's little dress may say '4' Tim Gunn believes her true size is more like an 8 or 10.\n\nAt the end of the day Tim Gunn is supportive of Kirstie Alley's weight loss, saying, \"She looks fabulous. People are too size conscious. It's all about how you look and more importantly how do you look in your clothes!\"\n\nImage via WENN\n\n↧\n\nKirstie Alley denies weight loss surgery\n\nKirstie Alley is denying that her dramatic weight loss is due to gastric bypass surgery.\n\nPoor Kirstie Alley can't catch a break. Either the media is slamming her for being too heavy or questioning her methods for slimming back down. Now the Dancing with the Stars alum is striking back.\n\nAlley, who has dropped a whopping 100 pounds, has had to defend herself against critics like Tim Gunn who says she is lying about her size -- and now she has gone to her Twitter fans to set the record straight on her weight loss secrets.\n\n\"Thank you for all your SWEET comments,\" the star tweeted after her svelte new body was featured in People. \"NO surgery, NO flippin lasers, NO barfing, NO starving... Jeez... my products, organic food, dance.\"\n\nThe DWTS runner-up says that the intense dance training coupled with an organic diet and her own new weight loss program called Organic Liasons totally reshaped her body.\n\n\"I feel back to normal,\" a once 230-pound Alley told People. \"I have my game again.\"\n\n\"When I hit that mark, I went, 'That's it!'\" she said. \"I have more energy than I've ever had in my whole life.\"\n\nNow Alley is focused on her next goal: finding a man.\n\n\"What I'm looking for is to be madly, deeply in love,\" she said. \"For the first time in my life, I know exactly what I want in a man: I want someone who has my back, who is courageous and brave.\"\n\nAlley has been married twice; both ended in divorce.\n\nLook for Kirstie Alley in the upcoming ABC pilot The Manzanis.\n\nImage courtesy Pop/WENN.com\n\n↧\n\nDWTS’s Nancy Grace lost 10 lbs, too tired to eat\n\nNancy Grace is dancing the weight off! The HLN host reports she has already lost 10 pounds on Dancing with the Stars.\n\nDancing with the Starsmay want to change their name to Biggest Loser, as celebrity contestants sign up for the dancing show to lose weight! After weight loss success stories like Kirstie Alley, Kelly Osbourne and Marie Osmond, Nancy Grace says she has already lost 10 pounds since she started practicing for DWTS.\n\n\"I'm dancing five hours a day and I have no interest in food,\"said Grace, who is paired up with new pro dancer Tristan MacManus.\n\n\"I used to read about Angelina Jolie saying she was too tired to eat and I thought oh yeah, right. But you know what? Last night after dancing, doing my show and putting the twins to bed, I looked at my turkey hot dog, and I could not eat it,\" she said.\n\nHow much weight does Grace plan on losing? \"I just hope I don't lose any weight in my boobs!\" she joked.\n\nGrace was in the bottom three this week during the first eliminations of DWTS, along with Rob Kardashian and Ron Artest, with Artest going home.\n\nPhoto: WENN\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nRicki Lake is no Kirstie Alley, says Derek Hough\n\nRicki Lake has said that Kirstie Alley is her inspiration for being on Dancing with the Stars, however her dancing pro, Derek Hough, says enough is enough!\n\nRicki Lake was inspired by the amazing weight loss of Kristie Alley during her stint on Dancing with the Stars –and credits the slimmed down Alley as her inspiration during her own time on the show. Her dancing partner, Derek Hough, seems to be getting frustrated that Lake is more focused on her weight loss than her dancing ability.\n\n\"I'm hoping to pull a Kirstie Alley,\" she said. \"Every part of my body hurts. ... When I went in for a costume fitting, I've lost 8 ½ inches. Three inches in my waist. Three in my hips. Over an inch in my thighs and another inch and a half on my arms. It's crazy.\"\n\nThe former talk show host also has clothes in several different sizes, like Alley did. \"I have two sizes of Lucky Brand jeans: 8 and 6. Usually I wear the 8 because they are more comfortable but now even the 6 is too big. They used to be tight,\" she gushed.\n\nHer dancing partner, Derek Hough, says it's time for Lake to quit focusing on Alley, and to start focusing on herself.\n\n\"I told her, 'No more.' \"I said, 'This is about you. This is now time,' \" he said after Monday night's show.\n\n\"I'm me, I know, I know,\" Lake responded. \"That's probably good advice. I really love working with Derek. He's such a good teacher and I'm learning so much. He encourages me. I feel like I'm learning that way. He's really intuitive with me.\"\n\nThe pep talk must have paid off, as Lake and Hough were on top of the leader board after scoring 23 points for their jive.\n\n\"I'm having the time of my life,\" Lake said.\n\nPhoto: WENN\n\n↧\n\nKelly Preston: Kirstie Alley helped me drop the baby weight\n\nKelly Preston has lost 39 pounds since she gave birth to baby Benjamin Travolta last year -- and the actress credits Kirstie Alley in helping her achieve her weight loss goals.\n\nActress Kelly Preston was spotted at the 9th Annual TV Land Awards in a slinky gold dress looking skinnier than ever. Her secret? Kirstie Alley!\n\nPreston credits her BFF and fellow Scientologist's organic weight loss supplement system with helping her lose 39 pounds of baby weight she gained while pregnant with Benjamin.\n\n\"When I got pregnant at 48, I didn't know if my body would bounce back,\"she said. \"I lost 39 pounds, have more energy than I had 20 years ago — and I feel amazing. I'm going to be turning 50 next year — holy ! Hey, 50 is the new 30.\"\n\nKelly Preston talks about the silent birth of her miracle baby>>\n\nAlley reportedly lost 100 pounds after being on Dancing with the Stars and created The Organic Liaison weight loss program to help maintain and continue with her own weight loss.\n\nCheck out Kirstie Alley's dramatic transformation here>>\n\n\"I was so excited when my best friend created Rescue Me,\" Preston gushed over the Rescue Me kit that's part of the weight loss system. \"It's pretty much the most genius thing ever.\"\n\nDid we mention that Preston also just signed on as the spokesperson for Organic Liaison?\n\nAlley's weight loss program consists of supplements and a diet plan. \"Organic Liaison is a weight loss and diet plan that offers organic weight loss products, natural dietary supplements, and access to online diet and exercise tools to help you lose weight safely and effectively, all while having fun!\"the website says.\n\nBesides her new body and gig, Preston has another milestone to celebrate. \"We just celebrated Ben's first birthday,\" she says of her son with John Travolta. \"I can't believe it's already been a year.\"\n\nPhoto: WENN\n\n↧\n\nDancing With the Stars: All-Stars: Who should win?\n\nABC just announced the cast for Dancing with the Stars: All-Stars and the celebs are pretty much who we figured would be cast. Now the biggest question: Who should win?\n\nBy now, you've probably heard all about the cast of Dancing with the Stars: All-Stars— it includes a bunch of past winners and runners-up, including Kirstie Alley , Pamela Anderson , Helio Castroneves , Joey Fatone , gymnast Shawn Johnson , Drew Lachey , French actor Gilles Marini , speed skater Apolo Anton Ohno , Kelly Monaco , Bristol Palin , Melissa Rycroft and NFL star Emmitt Smith from season three.\n\nOh, and there's one more cast member to be named — it'll be Carson Kressley, Kyle Massey or Sabrina Bryan — depending on how fans vote at ABC.com.\n\n\"The level of competition is going to be quite intense,\"DWTS producer Conrad Green said during the Friday announcement.\n\n\"I think half of the people involved in this cast have never been eliminated from the show,\" Green added. \"Most of the people here have done most of the dances if not all of the dances before. We’re going to probably have to recalibrate the judges slightly otherwise we’ll be starting out with 9s and 10s right out of the box.\"\n\nIn other words, the show could be dreadfully boring with too much perfectness, unless Kressley makes it — he wasn't exactly Mr. Dance Machine during his time on the show, but he was super entertaining.\n\nSo, who will win? It's anyone's guess, especially since we're expecting the stars' rabid fans to do all they can to push their picks to the top. Let's take a look at each contestant's chances.\n\nKirstie Alley\n\nActress Kirstie Alley pretty much admitted that it was her dream to be on Dancing With the Stars. She definitely put in work during her time on the show, and it translated to major weight loss and a runner-up spot in the finale. We expect her to make it far in the competition, but we doubt she'll win.\n\nPamela Anderson\n\nEh, she won't make it that far. Next.\n\nHelio Castroneves\n\nRacer Helio Castroneves' infectious personality made it hard not to vote for him during season five. We can see him getting to the top five again, though we don't see him as a winner.\n\nJoey Fatone\n\nFormer *NSYNC'er Joey Fatone is definitely talented in the dancing department. However, it's been a long while since he's been on the show so we think he'll have to work extra hard to have a chance at the top.\n\nDrew Lachey\n\nSame goes for 98 Degrees singer Drew Lachey, though the regrouping of the boy band that made him famous might push his star power a little higher in the eyes of the voters.\n\nShawn Johnson and Apolo Anton Ohno\n\nThese two Olympic champs might benefit because of the hangover from the Summer Olympic Games. Plus, they're both super talented as dancers. We expect them both to make it top five — and it wouldn't surprise us if Ohno is named champ again.\n\nGilles Marini\n\nDon't foresee too much for French hottie Gilles Marini, though we hope he's around long enough so we can see a few close-ups of his super hot bod.\n\nKelly Monaco\n\nKelly Monaco has the soap fan backing, so we fully expect her to stick around for a while.\n\nMelissa Rycroft\n\nSame for Melissa Rycroft — she has the reality star backing. However, we don't know if her fan base will push her very far among these other competitors.\n\nBristol Palin\n\nWe can totally see Bristol Palin making it to the runner-up spot again, even though she's not as good as the others in the dance department. She surprised us once, so we don't see why she wouldn't do it again.\n\nEmmitt Smith\n\nWe're pulling for former Dallas Cowboys star Emmitt Smith to take home the trophy again. Why? He's just so darn lovable.\n\nImage courtesy WENN.com\n\nWhat do you think: Are we spot-on with our predictions, or dreadfully wrong?\n\n↧\n\nKirstie Alley awkwardly confesses her soulmate is John Travolta\n\nDWTS All-Stars' Kirstie Alley talks John Travolta in her new 20/20 interview with Barbara Walters. Alley says Travolta is \"the greatest love of her life.\"\n\nKirstie Alley, John Travolta and Kelly Preston — all three are close friends and followers of Scientology. Leave it to Alley to publicly shake things up — she recently revealed John Travolta is her soulmate. Awkward.\n\nThe 61-year-old Alley currently competes on Dancing with the Stars: All-Stars. She sat down to talk to Barbara Walters for an upcoming 20/20 interview, airing Friday, Nov. 9, 2012.\n\nDancing With the Stars: Who should win?>>\n\nAlley admitted to Walters that her love for Travolta almost destroyed her then-marriage to actor Parker Stevenson, back when Look Who's Talking filmed in the late 1980s.\n\n\"Believe me, it took everything that I had — inside, outside, whatever — to not run off and marry John and be with John for the rest of my life,\" said Alley to Walters.\n\nWhen asked to explain why she didn't divorce Stevenson, she continued, \"Because I feel like when you marry someone, you're supposed to work hard at it, and you're supposed to make it work.\"\n\nKirstie Alley and Parker Stevenson were married from 1983 until 1997.\n\nKelly Preston: Kirstie Alley helped me drop the baby weight>>\n\nTravolta went on to marry Kelly Preston in 1991. Preston was also an actress and model; notably, she lost out on the role of Emmeline in The Blue Lagoon to Brooke Shields. Kirstie Alley, John Travolta and Kelly Preston are all practitioners of Scientology, a controversial religion perhaps made famous by actor Tom Cruise. . Alley and Travolta remain close friends, and it's unclear what kind of strain Alley's admission of love for Travolta will cause between him and Preston because there's no word yet from Travolta regarding Alley's 20/20 interview.\n\nKirstie Alley is currently on ABC's Dancing with the Stars: All-Stars, which airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8/7c.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Michael Carpenter / WENN.com\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nKirstie Alley reveals 'secret relationship' with Patrick Swayze\n\nIt seemed as if the actress was happily married for 14 years, but it turns out she loved a few men over that time. And at least two of them are very recognizable names.\n\nJust a day after revealing that she felt John Travolta was her soul mate back in the Look Who’s Talking days, Kirstie Alley told Entertainment Tonight that she also had a secret relationship with actor Patrick Swayze. Alley was married to Parker Stevenson from 1983 to 1997, and she met Swayze when she worked with him on the Civil War miniseries North and South in 1985.\n\nAlley told Chris Jacobs with Entertainment Tonight that they tried to avoid \"going down that road\" but ended up falling in love.\n\n\"We did not have an affair. But again, I think what I did was worse,\" she told Jacobs, according to Yahoo!. \"Because I think when you fall in love with someone when you're married, you jeopardize your own marriage and their marriage. It's doubly bad.\"\n\nSwayze was also married at the time, to his wife Lisa Niemi, who asked Alley to speak at the late actor's funeral last year. The invitation makes it looks like the widow didn't know anything about the relationship. According to Yahoo!, Alley mentioned in the interview with Jacobs that she didn't know whether Niemi knew or not. But the two women have remained friends.\n\nAlley's career was in full force in the 1980s and 1990s, and she has only recently revealed her relationship with both men. And although her love for Travolta also never became an affair, she tells Barbara Walters on an upcoming 20/20 that it ended her marriage to Stevenson.\n\n\"Believe me, it took everything that I had, inside, outside, whatever, to not run off and marry John and be with John for the rest of my life,\" she told Walters. Travolta met wife Kelly Preston a few years later.\n\nThe 61-year-old actress is currently competing on Dancing with the Stars: All-Stars.\n\nPhoto courtesy HRC/WENN.com\n\n↧\n\nKirstie Alley's hot mess confession: Cocaine binge for days\n\nKirstie Alley drops another bombshell: The 1980s were filled with cocaine binges after her brutal divorce.\n\nKirstie Alley is talking to all sorts of press about all sorts of crazy confessions as if this were some kind of atonement. This week, she sat down with Entertainment Tonight and went into great detail about her cocaine binges that would sometimes last for days before she landed her role on Cheers.\n\nKirstie Alley reveals \"secret relationship\" with Patrick Swayze>>\n\nShe writes in new memoir, The Art of Men, \"I did enough cocaine to kill several people.\"\n\nEntertainment Tonight was surprised at the candid response Alley gave when asked about The Art of Men's cocaine revelations.\n\n\"Yeah, I did,\" said Kirstie, while nodding emphatically. When asked about her fear of overdosing, Alley explained the thought of death was prominent each time she used.\n\n\"I thought I was going to overdose almost every time. But I would do somuch at a time. I'd snort the coke and then sit there and take my pulse [thinking], 'I'm dying, I'm dying.' \"\n\nKirstie Alley awkwardly confesses her soulmate is John Travolta>>\n\nAlley told Entertainment Tonight that her cocaine use came from shame and depression following her divorce from her first husband. Alley cheated and the marriage dissolved. \"And so I kept going for that feeling, that feeling of being extroverted. And so, that would last for 60 seconds and then I was going to die for 30 minutes. And then the second I wasn't going to die, boom, I'd do it again.\"\n\nKirstie also reveals that the physical consequences of the drug didn't compare with the emotional and spiritual effects she faced as a result of her cocaine use. \"The thing I could feel with me more than my body was dying, was my soul was dying. I was killing my essence of myself.\"\n\nAlley credits Scientology with her remarkable sobriety and overcoming her cocaine addiction.\n\nKirstie Alley's memoir, The Art of Men, was released on Tuesday, Nov. 6, through Atria Books. The memoir highlights Alley's relationships with John Travolta, Patrick Swayze, Ted Danson, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, and Parker Stevenson.\n\nPhoto courtesy of HRC / WENN.com\n\n↧\n\nKirstie Alley \"was trying not to be a whore\"\n\nKirstie Alley goes on Jimmy Kimmel Live! to try to to set the record straight about her \"affairs\" with John Travolta and Patrick Swayze.\n\nKirstie Alley has been making a lot of noise this week, not for her performance on Dancing with the Stars, but for a few chapters in her new book, The Art of Men.\n\nThe actress stopped by Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Thursday to promote her new tome and to clarify a few salacious stories being passed amongst the tabloids. The 61-year-old set the record straight to the late-night talk show host.\n\nIn her interview with Kimmel, she said, \"Can I just clarify, these were not sexual affairs. I think John Travolta is and has remained one of my best friends for almost 25 years, 26 years.... before he was married [to actress Kelly Preston], and I was married. But I fell in love with him.\"\n\nThe two actors met during the filming of the 1989 movie Look Who's Talking, and the reality show star said that they now have \"the most brilliant friendship.\"\n\nAlley also mentioned that she has a close relationship with Travolta's wife.\n\nThings were a bit stickier with Patrick Swayze, whom she met on the set of North and South in 1985. They engaged in an emotional affair while they were both married. He was married to dancer Lisa Niemi until his death in 2009 from pancreatic cancer, and Alley was married to actor Parker Stevenson until they split up in 1997.\n\nWhile the Cheers alum is \"proud\" that she never slept with Swayze, it has to be tough for the deceased actor's widow to hear this news.\n\nIt doesn't seem as if Alley has lost any sleep over her revelations, though.\n\nAs she told Kimmel, \"My mother told me I would be a whore if I didn't marry someone I had sex with, so I was trying not to be a whore.\"\n\nOK, whatever works for you, Kirstie.\n\nImage courtesy of FayesVision/WENN.com\n\n↧"
