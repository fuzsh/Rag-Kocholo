        "text": "The singer can't stop the feeling—of wanting to celebrate Father's Day. In honor of the occasion, Justin expressed his appreciation for both his dad Randall Timberlake and stepfather Paul Harless.\n\n\"When I became a dad, I realized what an important role these two incredible humans have played in my life,\" the *NSYNC alum—who has two sons, Silas, 8, and Phinneas, 2, with Jessica Biel—wrote on Instagram. \"I'm so very grateful to have not ONE but TWO dads to learn from and lean on. I love you both so much!! Happy Father's Day to all the Dads, Daddies, and Papas out there!!!\"\n\nOn Father's Day, the retired quarterback expressed his appreciation for his dad Tom Brady Sr. and reflected on what it's like to be a father to his three children: Jack, 15; Benjamin, 13, and Vivian, 10.\n\n\"On this Father's Day, all I can think of is how grateful I am to have been raised by the world's best Dad, and to now have three beautiful angels of my own who I have the joy of watching grow up,\" Tom, who shares Jack with ex Bridget Moynahan and Benjamin and Vivian with ex Gisele Bündchen, wrote on Instagram. \"Being a Dad is the best thing in my life.\"\n\nHe then shared the lessons both his father and his children have taught him.\n\n\"I have learned so much about what it takes from my Dad and to be able to pass that on to Jack, Benny and Vivi means the world to me,\" the athlete continued. \"They have taught me how to be present (still working on this daily)and cherish every moment (mostly) that we have as a family, because that's what matters most. Their love for others and constant selflessness makes me so proud to be their dad, and I know those traits come directly from everyone who is part of their life. Thank you Dad, for being you, and thank you to my three amazing kids, for giving me the pleasure of being your Dad.\"\n\nThe Spice Girls alum sent love to husband David Beckham on Father's Day and shared a series of photos of him with their children: Brooklyn Beckham, 24; Romeo Beckham, 20; Cruz Beckham, 18, and Harper Beckham, 10.\n\n\"Happy Father's Day @davidbeckham,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"You really are our \"everything\"we love you so so much @brooklynpeltzbeckham @romeobeckham @cruzbeckham #Harperseven.\"\n\nIn honor of her love Tom Pelphrey's first Father's Day, the Flight Attendant star shared a series of sweet snaps with their 2-month-old daughter Matilda.\n\n\"Happy (first) Father's Day to Tildy's favorite person!\" she captioned the post. \"@tommypelphrey watching you become a dad has been the joy of my life! No one loves you more than that little lady (besides me) we [love] you forever and appreciate all you do for our family!\"\n\nGiving a shout-out to her dad, Kaley added, \"And to my dad ! The greatest pops and gramps on earth! Matilda is one lucky widdle chunk!\"\n\nThe Mindy Project creator celebrated her dad Avu Chokalingam by posting a picture of him with her two children Katherine, 5, and Spencer, 2.\n\n\"My dad shows up,\" she captioned her Instagram post. \"He was the one who drove me from the hospital after both my kids were born. To this day, he comes to the house at least once a day to play with the kids, take them to the farmers market, pick them up from school, or walk Spencer around the block in my son's precious blue toddler car. He also says yes to my kids insane plans like ‘let's spin Grandpa around in the round chair really fast.'\"\n\nMindy then reflected on how her bond with her dad has grown over the years.\n\n\"It's funny how my love deepened for my dad when he became a grandfather, the role he was born to play,\" she continued. \"I love him to the moon and back, which is what he says to my kids. Whoever it is for your family - husband, partner, grandparent, mom, wife, step-parent, nanny, sibling, old friend - I hope you have someone out there who shows up for you and your family! It is the great blessing of our life. Now I'm gonna cry. Okay! Love to everyone today!\"\n\nKicking off the Father's Day celebrations a day earlier, The Rock posted a video of himself with his daughter Tiana, 5, in which she pretended to be a doctor and he played a patient.\n\n\"Daddy the patient: 'Doc, is that the rectal thermometer?' Doctor Tia: Hmm mmm,'\" Dwayne—who in addition to Tiana shares daughter Jasmine, 7, with wife Lauren Hashian and daughter Simone, 21, with ex Dany Garcia wrote on Instagram. \"I know one day years from now, play dates with Daddy won't be cool anymore so I'll take every minute I can… rectal thermometers and all. Every man wants a son, but every man needs a daughter. #ProudGirlDadOfThree #HappyFathersDay.\""
