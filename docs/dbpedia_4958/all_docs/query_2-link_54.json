At that time he fled Ukraine through the Polish border.\n\nOn his Instagram page, the dancer appealed for help in sending supplies to the people of Ukraine.\n\n\"These towns are running out of space,\" Chmerkovskiy said. \"This is an actual problem, these few towns announced they cannot accept any more refugees. Currently where I'm in, in Warsaw, everywhere you go is Urkrainan. Everybody is a refugee.\"\n\nWATCH: Maksim Chmerkovskiy describes leaving Ukraine amid war\n\nHe's hoping to raise more money through his family's GoFundMe campaign.\n\nChmerkovskiy, who was born in Ukraine, escaped from Kyiv last month where he was filming a dance show.\n\nHe chronicled his ordeal on social media."
