        "text": "Ukrainian-American Ballroom dance champion, choreographer and instructor, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, was born on January 17, 1980 in Odessa, Ukraine. He began dancing at the age of four and by his teenage years, his talent had taken him to a competitive level. He was introduced to television audiences in 2006, when he first appeared on the second season of ABC’s #1 hit television show, Dancing with the Stars. Through the show, he garnered nationwide recognition and success as a world class dancer and fitness role model.\n\nMaks’ drive and determination fostered the creation of Maksim Chmerkovskiy Productions. Through MCP, he has contributed his expertise and choreography skills to shows including Le Rêve – The Dream at Wynn Las Vegas, Broadway’s Burn the Floor and a special television spot for AOL airing in 2013. Although he is playfully known as the “Bad Boy of Ballroom,” Maks always involves himself in charitable work. He is proud to be one of the creators and directors of Dance Team USA, a non-profit educational and charitable organization that is dedicated to recruiting, supporting and training DanceSport participants. Maks’ helping hand doesn’t end there; he is implementing and spearheading an Art Therapy program at Childhelp, the longest-running national nonprofit dedicated to meeting the physical, emotional, educational and spiritual needs of abused and neglected children."
