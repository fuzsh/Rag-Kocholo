Oh Maks\n\n\"After everything we’ve been through with miscarriages and IVF we’re beyond blessed and know we are uber lucky for this miracle to happen to us. We’re just so happy that we can finally tell you guys the good news.\"\n\nFans took to the comments section to share their name ideas as Murgatroyd requested.\n\nOne person has a pretty good suggestion: \"Pax - combines Peta & Maks and means peace or peaceful.\"\n\nAnother fan suggested: \"Nico or Luka.\"\n\nA third agreed Nico would be good in their comment: \"Alec or Nico.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a fourth added: \"I love the name Rhys.\"\n\nThe pro dancers will surely have their hands full with three boys."
