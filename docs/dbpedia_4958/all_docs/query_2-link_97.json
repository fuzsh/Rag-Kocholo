        "text": "DANCING With the Stars' pro Maksim Chmerkovskiy has explained Mauricio Umansky and Emma Slater’s ‘romantic ties’ in an exclusive interview with The U.S. Sun.\n\nTuesday night's jam-packed episode of DWTS featured a tribute piece for Len Goodman, a nod to the stars' memorable year and a steamy moment between rumored couple Emma Slater and Mauricio Umansky.\n\nMaks, who participated in the emotional dance number for Len, weighed-in on the romance rumors surrounding the 34-year-old pro dancer and the 53-year-old real estate mogul.\n\n\"He's an awesome dude. Emma is a cool girl. They're single. You think they're not going to look at each other and be like, 'Damn, you're hot and interesting and also fun to be with?' if they have a good relationship.\n\n\"If Emma and Mauricio find each other to be those people for them, I wish them nothing but butterflies and all the best,\" the DWTS alum told The U.S. Sun exclusively.\n\nWhile admitting that he doesn't know exactly what's going on between the partners, he did confess that he looks at the partnerships differently after leaving the show.\n\nWhen he was part of the show for 17 seasons, he recalled: \"Looking at other people before, I'd be judging. I'd be like, 'Oh, how dare they?\n\n'Oh my God, holding hands. Stop it.'\"\n\nBut, nowadays, he sees it as a more positive thing and would rather encourage an amicable partnership: \"Do you boo.\"\n\n'GREAT SIGN'\n\nWhile promoting his recently launched skincare line Maks & Peta- featuring a face mist and CBD pain cream - the 43-year-old dancer shared his initial reaction to Emma and Mauricio.\n\n\"Well, great. At least they're having a good time in rehearsal,\" he said.\n\n\"Because right now, week five/six is when you start to get into each other's face- a little annoyed, very tired, probably also hurt a little bit.\n\n\"These things catch up and it does play a role in your emotions, and so, at least it's a great sign for Mauricio and Emma on DWTS.\"\n\nThe Tetya KAPA Vodka founder couldn't help but feel sorry for his pal, Emma's ex, Sasha Farber throughout all of it.\n\nEmma filed for divorce from Sasha in February after four years of marriage. Their divorce is still ongoing.\n\nProclaiming himself \"Team Sasha,\" Maks explained: \"I love the guy. I wish for him a very bright and beautiful future.\"\n\nHe reasoned that men usually take the male's side when it comes to a breakup and that \"girls probably take the girl's side.\"\n\n\"For me, it's just what it is. And I wish everybody happiness and a beautiful future,\" he remarked.\n\nMeanwhile, Mauricio and his ex, Kyle Richards, announced their separation in July after 27 years of marriage.\n\nThey have yet to file for divorce as they are working through their issues and figuring out \"what's next for them and their family.\"\n\nREALITY OF THE SHOW\n\nMaks, for his part, celebrated his sixth wedding anniversary to wife Peta Murgatroyd, 37, in July.\n\nThey welcomed their second child, Rio, four months ago, after their firstborn, Shai, turned six earlier this year.\n\nMaks and Peta are just one of the many couples that met on the dance floor while competing for the mirror ball trophy.\n\nApart from Emma and Mauricio, the other rumored couple on season 32 is Harry Jowsey and pro dancer Rylee Arnold.\n\nThe choreographer continued: \"I mean, there's been certainly enough romantic ties that worked. Romantic rumors were just that, and then there were rumors that turned into relationships and the happy ever after.\n\n\"So I think there's a possibility that two people that spend as much time as a couple on DWTS - and if they don't have personal attachments elsewhere, sometimes even if they do - it turns into 'this is my person' because we're so close and all that.\"\n\nHe then went on to say that being on the show \"is not real life.\"\n\n\"A lot of times, you could say that you're going to be in each other's lives forever. The reality is when it's over, you go back to your lives and next season you have a different celebrity, maybe younger, hotter, and more single,\" he explained.\n\n\"I do know that DWTS is extremely time-consuming. You become part of each other's world and seemingly no one else's.\n\n\"So all these things are rumors until the show is over, and then you see whose relationship is actually going to stick around.\"\n\nBREAKING SILENCE\n\nThe rumor of Emma and Mauricio began after the pair was spotted holding hands on October 22 following a sushi date in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Agency founder and the realtor took to Instagram on Thursday to address the rumor that came out about them dating.\n\nMauricio told his fans in the video: \"We are not dating. We are really good friends. We've been dancing together now for six weeks, four hours a day, every single day.\"\n\nEmma added: \"It's intense, like. you really form a very, very special bond and I think we have similar personalities so we've got a super supportive...relationship. We're definitely there for each other and it's beautiful.\"\n\nMauricio then described their relationship as \"really great friends\" and said that the hand-holding was a \"blown out moment.\"\n\nThe remaining contestants will return to the ballroom on October 31 for a special Halloween-themed night."
