        "text": "After a harrowing journey out of Ukraine amid the ongoing Russian invasion, Maksim Chmerkovskiy is finally home in Los Angeles where he reunited with his wife, Peta Murgatroyd.\n\nThe Dancing With the Stars pro was photographed arriving at Los Angeles International Airport on Wednesday and immediately giving Murgatroyd a long, emotional embrace. Chmerkovskiy told Entertainment Tonight upon landing, “I just don't want to resent peace somewhere else because of what I just saw, that's the reality. I don't know really what to say right this second.”\n\nHe also spoke with photographers and reporters waiting outside the airport about the attacks on the country and his experience trying to return to the United States. “The reason why Ukraine is standing right now is because of the Ukrainian people. And the fact that the entire world is helping,” Chmerkovskiy said, pointing out that this conflict is something that many in the country have been anticipating would happen for years.\n\nHe continued, “Huge shout out to Poland, huge shout out to neighboring countries. The way I was treated through the whole process of leaving into Poland, I've just got to bow down to the Polish people.” However, he added, “If we don't get involved, this thing is going to go everywhere else. I think that in 2022, following this action, we have to completely rethink the way we do things as a planet. There can never again be one person who can do something like this ever again. We have to have checks and balances globally, not just one country at a time.”\n\nChmerkovskiy has been documenting every step of this journey on his Instagram account from the first day Russia invaded Ukraine. The professional dancer grew up in Ukraine when it was still a part of the Soviet Union before leaving in the '90s. He recently went back to Kyiv to serve as a judge on the country's upcoming season of World of Dance before Ukraine suddenly fell under attack. On Tuesday, he let his followers know that he had decided to leave the country and had made it aboard a train headed for Warsaw, Poland, labeling the entire experience, “TRAUMATIZING.”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair"
