        "text": "Guide to Night in Venice 2018 in Ocean City\n\nThe annual event takes place on Saturday, July 28\n\nOcean City’s 64th annual Night in Venice celebration kicks off at 7 p.m. Saturday (July 28, 2018).\n\nThe boat parade and decorated bayfront home contest provides a chance to be part of the highlight of the summer season in Ocean City. Thousands of spectators line the bayfront, and thousands more attend private parties at homes along the route from the Ocean City-Longport Bridge to Tennessee Avenue. This year, a fireworks display returns to cap off the bayfront festivities at the conclusion of the parade.\n\nThe optional theme will be “TV’s Greatest Hits,” a celebration of the greatest shows, characters and moments in television history. Grand marshals will include teen singing sensation Jackie Evancho and NFL-lineman-turned-magician Jon Dorenbos (who both were hits on “America’s Got Talent”), along with Laurie Hernandez and Maksim “Maks” Chmerkovskiy of “Dancing With the Stars” fame.\n\nThe stars will be part of shows, meet-and-greets, and other events throughout the rest of the weekend. Ocean City is proud to welcome ACME back as a presenting sponsor.\n\nHere’s our guide to 2018 Night in Venice.\n\nWhen is Night in Venice?\n\nThe parade starts at 7 p.m. on Saturday, July 28, 2018.\n\nWhere does the parade route begin and end?\n\nThe boat parade begins near the Ocean City-Longport toll bridge and travels along the bayside to Tennessee Avenue, looping in and out of lagoons along the way.\n\nWhere can I watch the parade?\n\nTo view the Night In Venice boat parade, grandstands will be set up at street ends along the bay from Battersea Road to 16th Street and also at Tennessee Avenue.

Tickets are on sale, $4 for children (ages 3 to 12) and $8 for adults. Gates open at 4:15 p.m. with the Good Tymes Band playing 5 p.m. until the first boats in the parade arrive. Children’s activities include crafts, games and face painting. Tickets may be purchased by cash, check or charge at: City Hall, 861 Asbury Avenue, any day 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. No alcohol is permitted, and no parking is available.

Violators will be ticketed and in severe cases, the vehicles will be towed if public safety is affected. This is to allow for safe passage of all pedestrian and vehicle traffic and emergency vehicle access to isolated areas of the bayfront.\n\nCan I watch from the Ninth Street Bridge?\n\nAll pedestrians and bicyclists should use the Shared Use Bike Path and stay to the south side shoulder for viewing. No persons will be allowed to bring chairs for seating onto the bridge. At no time will persons block the free movement of the Shared Use Bike Path.
