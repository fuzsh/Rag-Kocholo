        "text": "Currently the Light Up the Night Tour is traveling all across America! (Except the Upper Midwest but thats okay... Read below for info about Merchandise, the Meet and Greets, the tour cast, buses, and even a fun way to share your experiences!\n\n​merchandise\n\nIt's difficult to attend tour without spending too money on the merchandise. Here's a guide to what they have to offer so you can plan what you want to buy in advance and forget the stressfulness of the huge crowds around the booth.\n\nProgram $20\n\nBumper Sticker $5\n\nWhite T-Shirt $35-40\n\nBlack T-Shirt $35-40\n\nBeanie $35\n\nTote Bag $15\n\n​Makeup Bag $25\n\nGray T-Shirt $45-50\n\nBlanket $55\n\n* I will try to get better quality pictures once I attend the show\n\n​meet and greets\n\nIf you purchased VIP tickets you will get the chance to meet seven cast members. Lindsay Arnold, Jordan Fisher, and Frankie Muniz will be included in every meet and greet. Two members of the cast will be featured in the Meet and Mingle, in which you are able to take pictures with them on your phone. So far the Meet and Mingles have featured Brandon Armstrong, Alan Bersten, Morgan Larson, Hayley Erbert, and Jenna Johnson. The Meet and Greets will feature Jordan, Frankie, and Lindsay, along with two other cast members which could include Emma Slater, Sharna Burgess, Gleb Savchenko, Artem Chigvintsev, Keo Motsepe, Sasha Farber, Alan Bersten, and Jenna Johnson.\n\nFor the first few shows there seemed to be a pattern in which each member rotated in the same order. However recently there does not seem to be much pattern to the meet and greets. Honestly, I prefer this because it's fun to find out who you will be meeting right when you get to the venue, rather than anticipating and knowing in advance.\n\nSam Cusiak (Lindsay's Husband) is involved with the tour again, and you will most likely get a chance to take a picture with him as well.\n\n​If you did not purchase VIP tickets, there is still a chance you will get the chance to meet them after the show, just go wait by the buses! Unfortunately this doesn't always happen after every show, as I experienced last tour.\n\nmorgan\n\nAs many of you have heard by now, Witney unfortunately could no longer be a part of the tour as she has to stay with her family and care for her father in-law. Morgan Larson has filled in her spot and is performing with the DWTS Tour.\n\nMorgan has appeared in Teen Beach Movie, Teen Beach 2, La La Land, Austin and Ally, Shake it Up, and on many other films and TV Series. She also appears during the season of Dancing with the Stars filling a troupe type role in a few dances. Morgan is a great addition to the tour and I am excited to see her perform!\n\n​tour buses\n\nAs far as I know, there seem to be three buses with cast members in which they live on for the length of the tour. The members of each bus seem to include...\n\nBus 1: Alan, Keo, Sharna, Jenna, Hayley\n\nBus 2: Emma, Sasha, Lindsay, Sam, Ruby, Jordan, Brandon\n\nBus 3: Frankie, Gleb, Artem, Morgan???*\n\n*I am not sure where Morgan is placed, but I will update this if I receive any additional info.\n\n​bows\n\nIf anyone cares about the bows order at the end, it goes......\n\nBrandon\n\nMorgan\n\nAlan\n\nHayley\n\nKeo\n\nJenna\n\nSasha\n\nEmma\n\nGleb\n\nSharna\n\nArtem\n\nLindsay\n\nFrankie\n\n​Jordan\n\nI'm not exactly sure what goes into deciding this order but it must somewhat have to do with importance? Which is interesting to analyze. First of all who chooses the bows order? Mandy Moore? The tour captains? (Jenna and Artem) Obviously Lindsay will be the last pro since she is the reigning champ. And Frankie and Jordan at the end with Jordan being last as the winner of Season 25, but other than that there's no real significant order, besides the more inexperienced tour members (Brandon, Morgan) falling at the beginning of the lineup.

While I understand that things like this may happen, it is disappointing since I didn't get to see Rashad last tour and now I won't get to see Jordan. However, I am frustrated with the tour management on how they are handling this situation. They never even announced his absence until after he missed one show, and then even then tried to play it off quietly by saying he would be performing at the pro bowl and his next DWTS show will be on February 5th. I am trying to make things out so I can attend the show on February 6th in Rockford, IL, but I am not going to get my hopes up. I am obviously still very excited to see the pros on tour and appreciate the fact that I am able to attend tour in the first place.\n\n​Keep your eye out for more tour related posts including...\n\n1. My Experience at Tour\n\n2. Results of the Tour Experience Survey\n\n3. Videos of Every Dance on Tour\n\nI saw a few people asking about Emma and Sasha's Instagram Live, and especially since the wedding is coming up I decided to write a little recap on the video. I was lucky and caught it just as I was arriving home, and wanted to catch everyone up on any wedding info. I wasn't able to screen record it, but this is what I recall from my memory.\n\n​1. The Weather\n\nI think someone asked them if they \"froze\" in Pittsburgh. They said they did, but it wasn't as bad as when they were in Canada the previous week!\n\n2. Radio City Music Hall\n\nThey were both talking about how they were excited to perform at Radio City Music Hall. Sasha said he had never performed there before and Emma was confused because she thought Sasha had. But since he wasn't on the last winter tour only Emma has previously performed there.\n\n3. Wedding Date?\n\nSomeone asked them when the wedding was, and they were just like \"We can't tell you that!\" And so, not much information on that topic unfortunately. . . . .\n\n4. Wedding Planning\n\nEmma just said that Sasha has done a ton of planning for the wedding and listed a bunch of things, most of which I cannot remember except the only thing on the list I do remember is \"alcohol\" lol.\n\n5. Wedding Cakes\n\nEmma says she wants to have many flavors of wedding cake, and wants to pick one herself, to have Sasha pick one, her parents pick one, and Sasha's parents pick one. Sasha also wants Ruby to pick one, but Emma turned that suggestion down.\n\n6. Kids\n\nSomeone asked if they want kids and Sasha's response was \"Hell yes.\" Exact quote. And then someone inquired if Emma wanted kids as well and then she said yes.\n\n7. House Plans\n\nThis part I was kind of iffy on exactly what she meant, however I think Emma said that they are going to try to expand their house because they don't think the number of kids they want will fit in their house right now. She said they wanted to expand to a four bedroom, and that she was going to try to get Drew to help them, but he doesn't know that he is going to be helping them yet. Emma says since she got Drew to the finale he should be willing to help them out.\n\n8. Where They Were Headed\n\nAt the end, they just said that they were heading to see Sasha's sister for the day since she lives near NYC.\n\nThat is all I remember for the moment! I think I hit most of the main points, if you saw the live and remember any additional information, feel free to comment below!"
