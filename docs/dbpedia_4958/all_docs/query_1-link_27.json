The couple embrace for a long moment, and after separating Chmerkovskiy pulls her in for a second hug and a kiss.\n\nWhen asked for a statement on how he was feeling, the professional dancer and judge had few words.\n\n\"I just don't want to resent peace somewhere else because of what I just saw. That's the reality,\" he told ET. \"I don't know really what to say right this second.\""
