        "text": "This month's issue has featured a number of trailblazers in media and with it also being Women's Month, we truly enjoyed sitting down with Access Hollywood and Access Daily with Mario & Kit, Kit Hoover! We have enjoyed watching her from being in the first cast of MTV's Road Rules which was a social experiment that led to the early days of reality TV and competition shows. From there she parlayed her talents, optimisim, and energy at ESPN as a sports broadcaster and for the last 14 years has been at NBC navigating the day and night slots in entertainment. We talked about her journey, success, the show and her latest project, launching her podcast The Coop that highlights phenomenal women!\n\nATHLEISURE MAG: We have been a fan of yours since Road Rules as you’re a ball of energy and optimistic which is always nice to see! I mean you were the first group to do that and in many ways that show paved the way for Fear Factor and Survivor!\n\nKIT HOOVER: Can you believe? I was just telling that story the other day to someone about how fun it was!\n\nAM: I loved that the show!\n\nKH: Kimmie, you’re too young to know what Road Rules is!\n\nAM: Well, I’m 44 and I remember the first season and watched a number of them!\n\nKH: Well, you look great! I was 24 when I did it and now I’m 53. It was fantastic and I still reflect back because it was real. I mean at that time, there was no such thing as reality TV except for Real World. They had just done London and they were shooting San Francisco and it hadn’t aired yet. We had no idea what we were doing, nobody had an agenda to go on to get into TV, it was just real. Well now, everything is about trying to get your 15mins.\n\nAM: It’s so true and what’s interesting is that we have Brooke Burke (Wild On, Dancing with the Stars, Fool Us) in this issue as well as when I first became aware of her, it was on Wild On.\n\nKH: I loved her on Wild On!\n\nAM: We’re really excited to have a number of trailblazers who are women in this issue so it was really great to include you as well!\n\nYou have had such an amazing career from being on MTV, sports broadcasting with ESPN, and of course being on NBC for Access Hollywood and Access Daily with Mario & Kit! When did you realize that you wanted to be on TV?\n\nKH: So I majored in Communications and Journalism at UNC in North Carolina. I didn’t know that I wanted to be on TV, I thought that I was going to go into the advertising world or to be in something creative. It wasn’t until Road Rules that after that finished, I thought, ok I kind of got comfortable behind the camera. Let me give myself 1 year to see if I can parlay it into something on TV and if not, I want to do something totally different. Fame was never the goal, I never wanted to be on TV, it was just, after that I thought that I had a window and I just decided to try it. Literally, it was almost a year to the day that I got my first job from it and it was called American Journal and it was kind of off and running from there. It was trial by fire then! I didn’t know what the heck I was doing!\n\nAM: Watching you in Road Roles, I felt that you were someone that we would see on TV as you just have that authentic vibe and you wanted to hear what you had to say! It was natural and the TV just loved you.\n\nKH: First of all, were you cracking up when – you know the joke was, that I had gained about 20 pounds in the 4 months that we were doing it. But that was a lot because I’m 5’0” tall. And the joke was with the producers was that, “oh my gosh, the little one is getting heavier by the second!”\n\nWe were eating Power Bars, Taco Bell, and Mark Long (Road Rules, The Challenge, The Challenge: All Stars) and I would drink 10 Budweisers! We were in our 20s, we had a life on the road for that show, so all you’re going to do is eat bad stuff.\n\nAM: Well Power Bars are healthy though!\n\nKH: Well, I’d have 3 before breakfast! We had no idea, we were eating the craziest – craziest things!\n\nAM: Ok, well maybe 3 would do that for sure!\n\nKH: Looking back, I was like, I think that I look great! I mean I was just a little puffier.\n\nAM: But it’s also what happens when you’re traveling.\n\nKH: Anyone that is on a road trip knows that you’re not eating the best or taking the best care of yourself.\n\nAM: How did Access Hollywood come about? You have been on there since 2010!\n\nKH: First of all, for anyone and everyone reading this! I got this opportunity when I turned 40! Do you know how great that is as a woman? To be hired, it’s been 14 years, and I’m almost 54! How great? It was one of those calls that my boss who hired me, Rob Silverstein (AccessDaily, Access Hollywood, People - The TV Show!) said, “you know, what’s great about you Kit?”\n\nI said what, thinking that it was going to be a weird compliment. He said, “you’re not hired based on your looks” and at first I looked and said is that a compliment? But then I thought, that that may be the biggest compliment and it goes back to the Road Rules days where I never cared what I looked like. You’re on the road! There’s no makeup, there’s no bathroom, there’s no shower. I have just wanted to do the best interview that I could do or to do the best job that I could do. But I thought, what a compliment to be able to go into the entertainment world business. The call came in, I took a leap of faith as I was living in Connecticut and my husband and I moved out with the 3 kids and we thought that it would last 1 year and 14 years later, we’re still here!\n\nAM: I remember the show had been around for a few months and I started watching it when I was flying out for press trips as it would be on either in the hotel room or watching it on the plane. When I first saw it, I was like oh it’s the Road Rules girl who was on ESPN and now here!\n\nKH: It’s the Road Rules girl, she keeps popping up!\n\nAM: I love how your background has such a great mix of entertainment, sports, covering red carpets, etc!\n\nKH: Well, similar to you, it’s the art of the pivot right? I kind of was naïve when Road Rules ended. I thought, what’s next? Nothing was next. They said, you’re a great person, thanks for coming in. I think that a lot of people feel like that with their jobs. You get one and you think that you’re going to stay, but things end and things change. You have got to be like musical chairs.\n\nYou have to find your next chair. So, I’m a hustler, and I like to navigate and work hard and it’s all related too! You’ve probably found that too!\n\nAM: Oh yeah!\n\nKH: Whoever you work with, way back then with Road Rules, I just had a meeting with Clay Newbill (The Bachelor, The Mole, Shark Tank) the producer out here. Who you are at your core matters tremendously. I feel so blessed that I have worked with so many great people.\n\nAM: I tell people all the time I have a number of interests and things in my background from modeling, cheerleading, stylng, designing, etc - but the base of who I am as an organized person, storytelling whether through apparel or in interviews, that’s why people keep come back.\n\nKH: That’s why people keep coming back.\n\nAM: 100% they want your commitment, passion, integrity and those skill sets!\n\nWhen you’re preparing for interviews and talking with celebs and people of interest, what’s your process? I mean you’re covering those from all over so where do you like to start?\n\nKH: Probably the same way you do! I love the research, I’m a reader! So I research and do all the reading that I can on the people. I sort of visualize the outline I have in my head and then I let it go and I try to be present and in the moment. I like to just listen and if you have done the homework, you know where you are going. And you want to get good stuff. It’s not about following the card. It’s listening and seeing where that takes you. I think that that’s the good stuff.\n\nAM: You also have Access Daily with Mario & Kit! How is that for you to be on 2 very different shows, different time slots – I have a lot of respect for that! That’s not easy!\n\nKH: Thank you! I’m grinding! I’m grinding. I have a lot of tuition with 3 kids! I love it! Access Hollywood is the night time show. So that’s more glitz and glam and entertainment news and then the hour daytime show with Mario Lopez (The Golden Girls, Saved by the Bell, The Golden Boy) is so much fun because that’s our kids and marriage and talking about fun stuff! I love daytime talk. So to be able to stretch both of those muscles is so much fun for me!\n\nAM: That must have been amazing to know that you are helming both of those shows! I can’t think of anyone else that has that kind of double time right now.\n\nKH: It’s really great! And then I’m launching a podcast!\n\nAM: So excited as we’re going to talk about that as well!\n\nKH: I put that in just so that I could do the long format. So I get my daytime that I love and I get my night time and then the podcast lets me go deeper. So the kids, 2 of them are at of the house as you know and 1 is going to leave next year so I have to start because I have more time to fill.\n\nAM: You and Mario are neighbors!\n\nKH: Yeah, he literally lives right around the corner. We could carpool to work. It’s the best! I run by his house which is on my running route so I go by and I wave, it’s really fun! His wife is the best and I’m really good friends with Nicole!\n\nAM: You can see your chemistry too with one another which is really nice.\n\nKH: Yeah, I’m very fortunate.\n\nAM: What have been some of your favorite topics that you have covered from your Access Hollywood shows?\n\nKH: For the night time show, it’s more of a 22mins show so it’s just quick. For the daytime, we don’t really touch any zeitgeist stuff. We’re more of a wholesome, talking about family, fun, never a gotcha thing. We try to do great interviews and so I love the ones that are a feel good story. I love when we cover human interest stories of everyday people doing extraordinary things. I am so moved by their stories. So we have been doing a lot of those feel good stories and maybe it’s because it seems like we do so much celebrity things that we want to show the real heroes. Give me a teacher or a nurse, I’m all into it.\n\nAM: Well the podcast, I’m personally excited about that! To have women in their 40s as I am of that demographic as well that are these powerhouse women! Where did the concept come from, what can we expect, and where did the name come from?\n\nKH: You better text me after you listen as I want all of your notes! For the past 4 years, I was thinking that I wanted to do this now that I have the ability to do this and there may not be any listeners! I wanted to do it for me.\n\nAM: There will be listeners!\n\nKH: I get to interview these incredible women and each one, I feel like I learn a nugget from them! Do you ever feel like that the best advice you get is from your girlfriend when you’re talking? Like, “hey, you have to try this face cream.” Or for me as I’m menopausal, you need to get this patch! Try this school or get this shoe or whatever it is. So I wanted the podcast to be that feel. I like that it is 40 and over because maybe me getting the job at 40, I feel like I haven’t even hit my stride at 54 and in the old regime, women were done in their 30s which is what Halle Berry (Die Another Day, Catwoman, Moonfall) was telling me.\n\nI just like that feeling of what are we doing now? We have all this knowledge and wisdom, let’s effen go! So it’s Cindy Crawford that I just interviewed, it’s Katie Couric, it's Gabrielle Reece, Jenny McCarthy!\n\nAM: Love Gabby! We had her and our husband as a cover back in Oct last year.\n\nKH: Gabby! What I loved about them was their love story! They actually filed papers for divorce and never got that far and they got it back together. The tools that they learned to do that – they’re connected now as a couple. She is the most thoughtful. Didn’t you find her so thoughtful and poignant?\n\nAM: She’s so sweet and real –\n\nKH: And smart!\n\nAM: Yeah the co-founder of Athleisure Mag is also my boyfriend so when I have interviewed her, we have talked about how it is to run a business with the person you are involved with. It was interesting to hear her talk or to see how they interact with one another and to just have real responses to it. She’s like, you do the best that you can, but sometimes, things get f’d up!\n\nKH: She is fantastic. She said this thing in an interview where she said, “I don’t talk to anybody better than I do to Laird.” I thought about that and sometimes when we talk to our spouse and partner, you’re a little nastier. She told me that she works on it like you would an athletic career and I thought, that is so awesome. I want to operate on that frequency.\n\nWith Jenny McCarthy (The View, Two and a Half Men, Masked Singer), I was asking her about her love story with Donnie Wahlberg (Wahlburgers, Saw franchise, Blue Bloods) and she felt that she was lowering her frequency and gears to get a guy. She was tired of doing it and said that she needed to be met here and that that was Donnie.\n\nHaving Cindy Crawford talking about being an empty nester. What she and Randy Gerber are doing next because maybe that's where I am in my life right now. they’re going to a different state to buy property and they’re looking at dating each other. I mean, Cindy Crawford, if she’s thinking about all this stuff- it’s real!\n\nAM: But it’s like, we’re all women doing these things. To hear those nuggets whether or not you’re in that position or not, you’re going to get something from it.\n\nKH: I hope so!\n\nAM: You can also find ways to apply it to your own life!\n\nKH: And it’s rowdy! I have a little naughty side, so it’s a little bit of me asking everyone what is in their bedside drawer. Katie was like, I’m not telling you! Cat Cora (Iron Chef America, Tournament of Champions, Stars on Mars), one of my favorite chefs!\n\nAM: We had her as a cover!\n\nKH: Unbelievable, you should have heard what’s in her bedside drawer! I said, “Cat we’re going to have to bleep that out! I was blushing the entire time!”\n\nAM: I love me some Cat!\n\nKH: I love me some Cat! To think that she was told that she would never break into this business and that she should be barefoot and pregnant back in Mississippi! The ceiling breaker that she is as a chef –\n\nAM: And a dynamo!\n\nKH: And a dynamo.\n\nAM: Plus she’s stunning. It was a pleasure to style her for our cover shoot and we were with her for about 8 hours and she was truly sweet. I grew up watching her on Iron Chef!\n\nKH: I love that we have had the same women! This is so great! I am having a ball doing this!\n\nAM: How many episodes are in the first season?\n\nKH: I have just done 6 and we’re going to promote it on Kelly Clarkson which is going to air on April 5th. So hopefully we will just keep it growing from there! I’m thinking that we will do 1 a week or 1 every 2 weeks. The women who have participated, they are my friends and they have been so gracious. I hope it builds! For me, I don’t know about you, if I take the time to listen to a podcast, I want to feel good and that I am part of something. I want a takeaway.\n\nAM: I do want to hear things that will make me a better person or to sharpen a skill in an optimized way. How can you find the cracks in your own foundation to make it better or to just be ok with them.\n\nKH: I’ve done the interviews and then days later, they will resonate with me and I keep thinking about it and it was something that was really cool or poignant with what they said. I want to try that or I find this interesting.\n\nCindy Crawford said something really interesting! I said, “have you always had the ability to laugh at yourself?” She said, “Randy wouldn’t say so.” I asked her what she meant by that and she said, “as the mom, I’ll be cooking and cleaning and Randy and the kids will gang up on me and make fun of me in a playful way, but it leaves bruises. It hurts my feelings.” So many people can relate to that.\n\nAM: That’s so me. On the outside I’ll say whatever, but on the inside –\n\nKH: That’s so me! It was fascinating to hear how she is navigating that and for others who are listening that is so relatable.\n\nOoo we also have Laila Ali (Girlfriends, Black-ish, S.W.A.T.) , she’s back in Georgia. I’m from Atlanta. Have you guys interviewed her?\n\nAM: Yes, it was amazing to chat with her!\n\nKH: We’ve been friends and she used to cohost with me and her art of the pivot, my friend can literally do anything and with no guidance. Everyone has been so gracious because this is longform and it’s a totally different muscle which I love! I’m growing as a person learning from all of this. What’s great is, it’s not a studio, it’s just my thing because it feeds me and I hope that other people enjoy it.\n\nAM: It’s also a testament that people are so comfortable with you! What is the meaning behind The Coop?\n\nKH: When you look it up in Webster’s Dictionary, it’s a gathering of hens and chickens that protect one another, that grow together, and work together. That’s what I was thinking of my women friends. Come into your Coop, it’s your safe spot! Let’s fluff our feathers, learn, and protect and shelter one another.\n\nAM: I thought so, but then I was like maybe I’m thinking too Midwestern.\n\nKH: You knew! Also, Gwyneth Paltrow (Great Expectations, The Talented Mr Ripley, Iron Man franchise) told me that double letters are supposed to be successful letters. Like she has Goop, but I was like, “hey, I will take any extra advice!”\n\nAM: This is so exciting. Where do you see this brand going?\n\nKH: I would like to see it go into a Coop Conference to share all the knowledge that you have learned and to interview a great celebrity like a book party without a book.\n\nAM: I love the concept because women like to connect and we love partnering with one another because once you’re connected you see synergies and commonalities!\n\nKH: Even when we’re just talking about it, it’s just so real and it makes me excited and it’s happening!\n\nAM: And it’s yours!\n\nKH: That’s a neat thing for me as someone who has always been under awesome companies. I have always been with great companies MTV, FOX, ESPN, and of course NBC. But this one is just me!\n\nWe start off each Coop interview with 1 word to describe your life and where you are right now. What would that be for you Kimmie?\n\nOne word where you are right now!\n\nAM: Navigating\n\nKH: I like that!\n\nAM: Within our team we’re always talking about we’re riding various waves. There’s that which comes to us that we never thought, that which we want that’s on our list and then when you do whatever it is you do, how do you keep on advancing as you don’t want to lose the momentum. So I feel that navigating is where I have been for a bit. I’ve had the pleasure throughout my life to have received many opportunities, some planned, some not planned, whether it was starting off interviewing people at the age of 12, my first person was Oprah, it was such an honor, my second was Jessie Jackson. I’ve always been one that wants to take opportunities and then to figure out how they come together. We see that plan of what is needed, and can go out and draw on these waves and then we navigate it.\n\nKH: I just love that word navigating and so we take that word and then if I’m interviewing you, the whole interview with you would be about navigating. I’d ask how you started off and you’d tell me about Oprah and then I end each interview with, \"What makes you happy?\"\n\nAM: Silence.\n\nKH: I love that.\n\nAM: I get very little of that.\n\nKH: So it’s a buttoned up approach for my interviews.\n\nAM: I can’t wait to listen, I love a bookend.\n\nKH: I love a bookend!\n\nThe what makes you happy came when my my business partner’s daughter was in therapy and they did this sort of deep breath that you did 10 times and you were supposed to say what makes you happy. We started ending with it and it’s wonderful to hear. First of all, the 1 word of where you are right know, Jenny McCarthy said, needless. I said, “what a great word.” I don’t feel needless and how do I get that still? Then to end with what makes them happy, it’s fascinating!\n\nThen we also have a section called Let’s Get Random and then I can ask all of the fun stuff.\n\nIG @kithoover\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY COURTESY | Kit Hoover\n\nRead the MAR ISSUE #99 of Athleisure Mag and see HEART FELT STORIES | Kit Hoover in mag.\n\nAs we're less than a year away from Paris 2024, avid readers know that we enjoy chatting with Olympic athletes whether they're still competing or have retired from competing, but are still in the community. We caught up with 3X Olympian (Beijing 2008, London 2012, and Rio 2016), 2X Team USA Swimming Medalist, and Team US Olympic Team Captain, Elizabeth Beisel. Known for the individual medley as well as the backstroke, we wanted to find out about her Olympic experience, the importance that surfing has as a sport as well as a skill that has served her, how she works with USA Swimming Foundation to ensure that the next generation is able to swim and potentially be able to become athletes in the sport as well! She also talks about the importance of representation and inclusivity in the sport. In addition, we find out what she has been up to, her partnership with Dermasport, embracing her second passion as a violinist, and more.\n\nATHLEISURE MAG: I’m so excited to be able to talk to you as I enjoyed watching you during your Olympic journey and watching you compete and I know our readers are going to love to know more about your passion for the sport, competing, and what you’re up to now!\n\nELIZABETH BEISEL: Thank you for having me and I just want to say that it’s an honor to talk with you as you’re a bad ass!\n\nAM: Amazing and thank you!\n\nWhen did you first fall in love with the water?\n\nEB: Honestly, 6 months old! I went to the Mommy and Me classes at the YMCA. I grew up in Rhode Island which is the Ocean State. So luckily, my mom and dad had the means to put me into the YMCA Mommy and Me classes and introduced me to the water at an early age. I swear that I was the only baby there that wasn’t screaming bloody murder! I love the water! I would only sleep if I was in the water that day. Like it became a thing. I think from the beginning, I was in love with the water and that never left me. I did other sports and other activities growing up, but I think that stuff happening in the water was where I was most comfortable and passionate. So, that was pretty much my entire life!\n\nAM: I love hearing that!\n\nEB: It’s great!\n\nAM: You specialized in the backstroke and are known for your individual medley. What was it about these specialties that you wanted to compete in them?\n\nEB: So, a lot of swimming, you don’t necessarily get to choose the event, the event chooses you. What you're good at is what you morph into. For me, I was one of those swimmers with the individual medley which is all 4 strokes in one race (Editors Note: the medley includes the backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and freestyle). So I had pretty solid strokes across the board. But backstroke is definitely the one that I excelled in the most. So, since a young age, I kind of always swam all 4 strokes and then I really of honed in on the middle distances which is where my body thrives. I’m not necessarily a long distance swimmer, but I definitely have no sprint fibers in me. Like, I cannot run fast in a sprint, I can’t swim fast, it’s just who I am. I really found that happy medium in the 400m races and it really was just a matter of, “oh wow, I’m really good at these strokes,” in these events compared to everybody else. Why don’t I start focusing on these in practice and swimming on them more in meets. It’s kind of a snowball effect.\n\nAM: I love hearing that as we have interviewed a number of Olympic swimmers and I have never asked how they chose that particular one. But I like that you’re saying that it kind of finds you.\n\nEB: Yeah, trust me, if I had my choice, I’d be swimming a 50 free and be done in 20 seconds, but my body is not made for that!\n\nAM: You’re a 3X Olympian, you have 2 Olympic medals, you’ve served as the Olympic Swimming Captain. What was your Olympic experience like for you and what did you love so much about it?\n\nEB: I think that each Olympic experience was super different and for many different reasons. You know, my first one I was 15 and my last one I was 23. So that’s a completely different human! It was such an honor to be able to reach the pinnacle of the sport that I loved so much and be able to compete in it at that highest level for our country. I remember watching the Olympics when I was 7 years old on TV and having that be the first moment where I really grasped what the Olympics were and how monumental they were in my sport. I knew that I wanted to do that one day. That was my goal and I knew that I was going to make it happen. I’m just a small town kid from Rhode Island, I didn’t grow up in a family of Olympians and swimmers. I’m just like a lot of us where you have a dream. Maybe the fact that I was 7 years old and that kids have that beautiful way of just thinking nothing is impossible, I kind of went for it. I was like, “yeah, why not me? Of course!” It ended up being such an incredible experience and standing up on the podium, winning Olympic medals for your country and doing it alongside your teammates is so special. I have met the best people through my life in the sport of swimming. I think we’re forced to be pretty humble because, well, swimming is not an A-list sport. It’s not football, it’s not soccer, it’s not baseball. So we have once every 4 years to kind of shine at the Olympics and then nobody really cares about what we’re doing. We don’t make any money so it’s really a group of people that do it because they love it. I think that breeds a certain type of person and archetype. It’s just like the blue collar hardworking type of people that are really in it because you love it, not for the money, or the fame, or any thing like that. It’s just, “yeah, we love to swim.” Longwinded answer – Olympics are amazing!\n\nAM: So, we always love knowing how athletes stay fit and obviously, you’re in the water which is a huge part of it. What are the workouts that you do in and out of the water when you’re training or even now when you’re doing what you do?\n\nEB: I try to lift weights twice a week. I know that that doesn’t sound like much. When I was swimming, I was lifting 2-3-4 times a week depending on where we were at in the season. Towards the end of my competitive swimming career, I started implementing yoga and I’m now a certified yoga instructor, I love it that much. What I found while I was an athlete and now, and I still consider myself an athlete even though I am not actively competing, is that I leave yoga feeling so calm and like it’s almost like it’s opened up my body obviously, and my mind as well. I see things clearer, I think clearer, and it’s super relaxing. I’m kind of a 1 million miles a minute type of person so I need an outlet and something to force me. Because I’m not going to do it at home. I know myself. I’m not going to put on the meditation and do it at home. I wish I could. But I need to go somewhere and have somebody leading me and once I discovered yoga, not only did it help me athletically because you need to be stretching and you need to be opening your body and your muscle tissue. It helps with recovery a lot, but my mind too. It helps me slow down and shut off and just give myself that parasympathetic nervous system a break. So I would say yoga, lifting, and then I try to walk. It sounds simple, but I think that walking is good and I like to multitask and if I have calls, I will do it when I’m walking. So just nothing crazy to be honest and I think that’s the thing about Olympians, people probably think that we’re doing this out of the box really fancy stuff and it’s like, “no, we do the exact same thing that you guys do, we just do it 40 hours a week.” Instead of you doing it on the weekend or an hour here or there. But yeah, it’s just taking care of my body or anybody’s body is when you’re going to feel better. So that’s why I move now, because it makes me feel good.\n\nAM: It’s so funny because I have probably been doing yoga for the last 15/20 years or so and once I went to my 40’s I went from a love/hate relationship to desperately needing it because like you said, it’s calming your mind down and having someone else stopping me and forcing me to do the things that I do. Hot yoga is my jam!\n\nEB: Same! Oh my God! Give me a hot power vinyasa and I’m good!\n\nAM: Same! I get so happy with it, it breaks me down, and I can quiet everything around me and I so appreciate it now versus in my 20’s I was like this is something to do for my mobility and flexibility. Now it’s like, no I need it.\n\nEB: Exactly, this is like water and I need it.\n\nAM: So you partnered with Dermasport. Can you tell me about the brand and why it was synergistic with you to work for them?\n\nEB: Ok. So Dermasport is a skincare brand so it’s face wash, moisturizer, eye cream, and SPF. It’s designed by swimmers for swimmers. Right off the bat, synergy. Throughout my entire swimming career, I was always struggling to find – especially sunscreen, I was swimming at the University of Florida and I ended up swimming there for 8 years.\n\nThat’s 8 years of swimming under the sun outside and I really struggled finding a sunscreen that wouldn’t smudge my goggles and I know that that sounds crazy, that would stay on during the entire practice, would protect my skin, and on top of that, the chlorine itself is so bad for your skin. It strips away every good oil and thing that you have on your face. So I was struggling to find a post swim face wash that really felt like it got everything off. Not only the residue of the sunscreen, but also the chlorine that had seeped into my skin. Once Dermasport came out and approached me, and sent me samples for me to try out, I tried it out for a good 2 months indoor and outdoor swimming. I knew that this was the stuff. It was like I was the one going to them asking them that if they wanted me to do anything, to let me know. I think another thing is that element of protecting your skin. I lost my dad to cancer 2 years ago, although it wasn’t skin cancer, it was a huge wake up call for me being like, you’re healthy until you’re not. You’re cancer free until you’re not so what am I actively doing that’s preventative and ways that I can alleviate the possibility that I don’t ever end up having cancer. So sunscreen has been like, it doesn’t matter if it’s a cloudy day, if it’s the dead of winter, it’s part of my morning routine now. So it just really hit a lot of the elements that I am really passionate about in my life and so it was kind of one of those things where I was like the universe just bestowed this upon me and I thought it was beautiful.\n\nOf course, since retiring from competitive swimming, I really started to surf a lot now that I have time in my life to do things. It’s mineral based, the packaging is either recyclable aluminum or post consumer recycled bottles so I feel good about it across the board. It’s the best!\n\nAM: That’s amazing!\n\nWhat’s your discipline in surfing? What are you doing in surfing? Are you doing wake boarding or looking for the ultimate big wave?\n\nEB: Well, I interviewed Carissa Moore once so you and I have that in common!\n\nAM: Yup!\n\nEB: I’m sure you had the same experience, she was the nicest person in the world!\n\nAM: She was our FEB ISSUE #85 this year and it was on Super Bowl Sunday and we had a huge tie zone difference and she was the loveliest person.\n\nEB: Exactly and I was in Tokyo for the Olympics 2 summers ago and I was working with NBC and of course it was surfing’s first time in the Olympics. Carissa wins and part of my job was interviewing the athletes after they won. Carissa was not in a rush, she never made me feel like I was annoying her and trust me, the amount of press that she did on that day, like she did not need to talk to me. She was just phenomenal and she was beautiful and lovely as a human!\n\nI have been doing it for a few years now and it’s been really awesome because I love learning new things. I took to surfing easily because of my paddle strength and my arms. So I’m getting better I did a surf trip in the Maldives for a month in April and the thing is with anything, if you’re not doing it consistently, you’re not going to be better. Here where I am in Rhode Island, we get Hurricane Season waves in the fall and then nothing for 10 months. So, I’m trying to go on more trips to get better, but the camaraderie, the culture, I just love it! It’s amazing.\n\nAM: Do you think that you’ll go to Nazaré?\n\nEB: Ha! I’ll watch! Listen, I love to live my life and be alive! Like you know what’s even crazier Kimmie? The tow people with the jet ski! They have to be equally trained, if not more! You know, it’s unreal!\n\nAM: HBO's 100 Foot Wave, but you see it and you’re like, holy shit!\n\nEB: I know right?\n\nAM: What does your partnership look like with Dermasport? Are there events coming up or is it just organic integration?\n\nEB: A lot of it is organic. Obviously I have been sent the product as I need to use it in order to talk about it. We’re going to do some appearances at a lot of Masters meets so that is basically older swimmers just because I feel that those are really the people that are tuned into taking care of their skin and their health whereas kids may be a little harder. Mom says use your sunscreen and the kids are like, “but I’m invincible, why do I need that?” And then, just like genuinely and organically posting about it. I’m at the point in my life that if something doesn’t align with me, I don’t give it my time. We have too many things going on in our lives and so this is one of those things like I said earlier where it just hits every pain point in my life that I am genuinely passionate about – swimming, being in the ocean, surfing, and being in the sun. I’m a lifeguard too and I sit in the sun for hours throughout the day. My connection to cancer and so it’s a really genuine partnership. I’m so excited to be involved.\n\nAM: So tell me about Block Cancer. Why did you want to launch this, what is this lifestyle brand, and what can we expect to see from it?\n\nEB: I’m so excited! It launched July 19th. So I’ll give a quick backstory. When my dad was going through his diagnosis and treatment, I was going through all of the books and cancer had never touched my family. I didn’t know what to do and I was super green in that world and all the things I read said to give something to your loved ones to look forward to. So I thought that I had this amazing swimming platform and there’s an island off the coast of Rhode Island, that only 2 people have ever swum to and no female had ever done it. So I was like, “this could be something cool.” I could share my updates with dad and we called it Block Cancer because the island is called Block Island. It’s like a play on words.\n\nUnfortunately, I did the swim, but my dad passed away before I could complete the swim. I know that he knows that I did it because I fully believe that he was there that day. But after the swim, we were like we had this modest and humble goal of raising $5,000-$10,000 and we raised $665,000 all going to in lab cancer research. That was my thing.\n\nI didn’t want to be funding the renaming of a hospital wing, that’s not my jam. If there's no funding there's no research, no research, there’s no cure. So how can I bridge the gap between the oncologist and the researchers and actually making some progress. So after completing the swim, sitting on it for a little bit, digesting what had happened with my dad and all that stuff – I was really looking to relaunch it and I didn’t really know what that looked like. What it turned into being organically was this collaboration of creatives all designing really cool designs for Block Cancer and selling the merch and donating 90% of the net profits to a non-profit that I have worked with my entire life that funds lab research. It is 100% going to in lab research and I get to be apart of the vetting process and the grant writing process so it’s really really awesome. It’s not just hoodies, hats, and bracelets, but it’s also chemo hats, scarves, port shirts, and cancer care packages. I wanted to do something that really put the cancer patient first. I have also compiled resources like cancer diagnosis resources, grief resources, and when you get a cancer diagnosis, what the hell do you do? What questions do you ask, who do you go to and what do you do when you lose somebody?\n\nFor the past year and a half, I’ve been compiling all of that, putting it together and it’s just been this real passion project. It’s never felt like work. It’s a way for me to stay connected to my dad. Actually, Dermasport to bring it back in, we’ve been in talks to have the sunscreen be sold on Block Cancer and maybe a portion of the net-profits go to the Block Cancer Fund. It makes sense right? You use sunscreen and it protects you in skin cancer. Again, Dermasport fit in seamlessly to this beautiful passion project that I am working on and it felt like this beautiful symbiotic relationship. It’s all good stuff and I’m so excited! I have literally, my eyes are all over the place the place – I’m not a website builder, but I have done all this work myself because I don’t have an investor. I don’t have 15 grand to pay for a website developer. So it’s been actually great because I have learned a ton. I've learned skills that I otherwise wouldn't have had.\n\nAM: That’s great, because when you do all of the stuff, as you bring people on, you know exactly how long it takes, what it is – because when you can do it yourself, the person who you bring on who definitely has the skills to be able to do that should be above and beyond what you can do.\n\nEB: Of course! Yes, absolutely. I think that the website came along great.\n\nAM: What other projects are you working on beyond Dermasport and Block Cancer? Are there other things that we should keep an eye out for?\n\nEB: Actually, super exciting news! So I mentioned earlier that I did other activities growing up. So I grew up playing the violin. That was actually my equal love to swimming. But it always had to take a backseat to swimming because I would always choose swimming. So violin is beautiful because it is something that you can always do for the rest of your life. So I’m in a band called Laden Valley and we’re developmental, super early in our stages. But we got asked to play Newport Folk Fest – we’re a folk band.\n\nAM: That’s huge!\n\nEB: Yeah! Huge like Brandi Carlile, Paul Simon, we’re the opener on Fri of Newport Folk Fest and this is like – if this goes well, in the folk world if you’re playing Folk Fest in Newport, you’re doing well!\n\nAM: Oh I’m well aware, that’s why I perked up!\n\nEB: Yeah and we’re very excited, I got all of my outfits planned and I’m like, what are we wearing? So it’s me and 3 other guys and so I’m picking the outfits and the color scheme and they all have can match me.\n\nAM: That is so exciting congratulations!\n\nEB: Yeah and it’s one of those things where this – I don’t want to jinx it. But I truly believe that maybe it could be something, but we will see! It’s by far the biggest crowd that anyone of us have performed in front of. I think it’s 8,000-10,000 people, but for us, it’s like huge and it’s so exciting!\n\nAM: That’s exciting! The Newport Folk Festival is amazing and I knew what it was as soon as you said it as they don’t let just anyone play it. This year it’s Lana Del Rey, Jon Batiste, Maggie Rogers, that’s amazing.\n\nYou do so much! How do you give back to the sport that you originated in and how do you give back to the youth that is coming up?\n\nEB: Yeah, so I’m an ambassador for the USA Swimming Foundation and that’s the philanthropic arm of USA Swimming so what we are trying to do is save lives and impact communities. Saving lives is – ok we know that swimming is a fun sport and we get to win Olympic medals and stuff, but at the end of the day, nobody gets into the sport of swimming to become an Olympian. They get into the sport because it’s purely a skill. It’s a life saving skill, but if you come from a socioeconomic background, culture, or city where swimming isn’t really a part of your life or the people that you’re surrounded with – you’re not going to learn. Formal swimming lessons reduce the risk of drowning by 88%.\n\nSo it’s like, I don’t know if you heard the story of the quarterback a couple of weeks ago that drowned in the NFL. But what I try to tell people is listen, the water does not discriminate, it doesn’t care if you’re an Olympian, it doesn’t care if you’re an NFL quarterback, it doesn’t care if you’re a 5-year-old. You can drown. So what we do is basically go around the country on a tour and it’s every May. We provide grants to local Boys & Girls Clubs, YMCA’s and we’re like, “here’s $15,000. We ask that in the next year you provide transportation to kids that cannot afford swimming lessons. You bring them from school to the YMCA or the Boys & Girls Club whatever it is and you get them in the water and you teach them how to swim.” I kind of call myself the out of town hero right? We go there and it’s inner city kids in Detroit or in Chicago. They have never seen a pool before, we make it all shiny and fun for them, but it’s like there’s some follow up here. We’re kind of the catalyst and you just have to continue it. So that’s been really rewarding to give back to the sport. At the end of the day, those Mommy and Me Classes that I took with my mom, they’re weren’t about me winning medals. Not at all! They were for me to learn how to swim and to be safer around the water.\n\nThat's been the way that I have given back in the past few years since being done.\n\nIt’s awesome because it’s also a diversity thing. You watch the Olympics, there is 1 Black person on the Olympic Swim Team. There’s 1.\n\nAM: Yup.\n\nEB: Like, what a microcosm of society right? Because that is what swimming looks like. So, it’s like, we’re trying to come in and we have Cullen Jones – have you ever met Cullen Jones (2G, 2S)?\n\nAM: No, I have not, but I want to!\n\nEB: He was literally my first friend on the National Team. He’s my big brother. I cannot say enough good things about him. Cullen, the first Black person to win an Olympic Gold medal in swimming, to break a world record, the first of everything! He’s kind of like the face of this tour. To be able to do this on the road with him and to watch, because I can say something, but I’m white. It’s not going to resonate as much as when he does it. Watching I get chills, watching him talk to an entire auditorium of kids who honestly may not even know what the Olympics are, but he gets through to them because he can relate to them and they go into a pool and they’re inspired to learn how to swim. That’s what it’s all about. It’s so incredible! So, I mean that this is a 100 year project!\n\nAM: Oh yeah! That’s why representation is so important you have to have what needs to be reflected and if you have 1 maybe you get 4 and then 10. Like you said, it’s going to be 100 years for sure.\n\nEB: Yeah, it’s always safer around the water. It’s never completely safe as I said earlier, you, me – no one is completely safe. Being around and having that impact on the sport and who it is accessible to is like – that is way more than any Olympic medal – it’s saving lives.\n\nAM: Can you tell me about the Lead Sports Summit and what your involvement is with them?\n\nEB: So Lead Sports Summit was founded by one of my best friends on the Olympic Swim Team, Kara Lynn Joyce (4S). She saw a need for a summit for just women and female young teenage athletes. So 13-18 and she gets the all-star team from the Olympic Team. The heavy hitter names that you watch on NBC at the Olympics come to Lead Sport Summit and we have breakout groups, we have panels, we have really open and honest discussions and we give these teenage girls a safe place to talk about stuff that maybe they are dealing with on their team, in school, with relationships at home, it’s a judgement free zone. It’s cool because I think there is an element of humanizing Olympians and what we do. Maybe it’s inspiring because of what we do. It’s like, “oh wow, I was putting Katie Ledecky (7G, 3S) on this pedestal and I thought that she was untouchable, but now that I have met her, spent time with her, and I know she has dealt with the same issues that I have dealt with – now this scary thing that felt impossible is possible! It is something that I say to Kara all the time that she needs to have one just for adults because I would go. I tell her too that by the end of the weekend, I have cried 48 times and I feel that I have gotten more out of it then the actual teenage girls did! Also, I’m not in the social media world that they are in. You and I did not grow up with those same pressures.\n\nAM: Exactly.\n\nEB: So it’s super eye opening to hear them talk openly about the pressures that they feel from social media and society. It gives me chills and makes me say, how can we help? It’s an incredible event and it’s over Labor Day Weekend every single year. Kara is opening it up to other sports now and it’s taking on a life of its own which is really beautiful and I will be at the one in DC which is over Labor Day Weekend this year.\n\nAM: That's fantastic!\n\nEB: Yeah and I think that it’s sold out. Which doesn’t surprise me as it’s done that every single year. It really is worth every single penny. It’s the best!\n\nAM: I love that when people empower and infuse people. Even if something is for a lower age group, I always say that I feel like we’re adulting while we are dealing with our own traumas that are unresolved.\n\nEB: Yes! There’s some stuff that happened to me 15 years ago that I should probably figure out!\n\nAM: Without a doubt!\n\nIG @ebeisel34\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY COURTESY | Elizabeth Beisel\n\nRead the AUG ISSUE #92 of Athleisure Mag and see THE SKILL OF IT ALL | Elizabeth Beisel in mag.\n\nFor the last 10 years, we have enjoyed NBC's The Blacklist where we are introduced to Raymond \"Red\" Reddington (James Spader) a former ex-US Naval Intelligence officer who became a prominent criminal and has evaded the FBI and been on their Most Wanted fugitive list for decades. He voluntarily gives himself up to FBI and lets them know that he has created a list known as the Blacklist. In his exchange to inform on their operations, he wants to receive immunity from prosecution as long as he works exclusively with FBI Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone).\n\nWe learned about their relationship with this rookie agent, Blacklisters and Dembe Zuma, played by Hisham Tawfiq who is his number 2. We have seen him be his confidant and navigate his way to joining the FBI himself! We caught up with him to talk about his service in the military, being a first responder, how he got into the industry and his role in the series.\n\nIf you have yet to watch The Blacklist, this interview will include discussions about plot points about the show and specifically Season 9 and the current and final season, Season 10 which is airing now.\n\nATHLEISURE MAG: In doing the research into your backstory, you have always fostered your work in the arts as well as being a literal super hero with your time in the Marines and being a firefighter in the FDNY for 20 years while still focusing on being an entertainer, when you were growing up, what did you want to be?\n\nHASHIM TAWFIQ: When I was growing up, I had dreams of becoming a pilot! And I think that at the time, to be a pilot, you had to have 20/20 vision so that quickly left my vision. But I was always an outdoors type of person. I was always into physical activity and I think my dream was to be a football player, but then I got injured. I took a dance class and I fell in love with dance and that was my introduction into theater and that allowed me to make that transition. But, my ultimate dream was to be a pilot.\n\nAM: Tell us about your earliest memory as an actor and what was the path for you to decide that this was also something that you wanted to do?\n\nHT: In the 90’s I started to dance and theater and I was doing this intensive acting and I went to this workshop which also had students that included Denzel Washington and Debbie Allen. It was at that moment what I took that class that I realized that I really liked this and I could see myself doing this as a career. But at the same time, I was already a firefighter, so there was already this struggle between being a firefighter and pursuing this career as an actor.\n\nAM: How did you end up being a firefighter as you were Station Chief for the FDNY in Harlem?\n\nHT: So when I was in the Marines, I already started thinking about what I would do when I came out. I took all of the tests, I took police exams, corrections, and I knew nothing about the fire department. There was a flyer in my home from this organization called the Vulcan Society which is an organization of Black Firefighters (editors note: the Vulcan Society was founded in 1940 and is a fraternal organization of black firefighters in NYC). At the time I was coming out of the Marines, out of 10,000 NYC firefighters, less than 2% were African American. The Vulcan Society was active in the inner-city high schools to recruit people of color to the fire department. I came home and I saw that postcard and I filled it out. Like I said, I knew nothing about the fire department, but I filled it out and I started learning about the job and the hours. I was a physical person and I like to get dirty and dusty and all of those type of things. I found out that it was an exciting job and that it was something that I would love to do. At the time, I was a Correction Officer at Sing Sing when they called me and I left that and went to the fire department and never looked back.\n\nAM: Wow! A lot of people talk about the training or you see it when you’re watching shows like FOX’s 9-1-1, its spinoff 9-1-1: Lone Star and ABC’s Station 19 which are my favorite first responder shows. Did you find training to be a firefighter difficult?\n\nHT: No ha ha! I guess because I was just out of the Marine Corp and I think that that was the most toughest thing that I had ever experienced physically! So when I went into the firefighter training, it was kind of easy for me. I was a squad leader and I stood out. There was nothing really about the Firefighter Academy that was challenging for me. Like I said, I had just gotten out of the Marine Corps and that was the most challenging thing that I had done. I remember taking the physical and it was a breeze for me and I remember blowing through that. People were like, “oh man, this guy is moving through it!” Being fast, being physical and being strong is part of my attributes and that’s what led me to go towards those kind of jobs.\n\nAM: Were you still acting while you were being a firefighter?\n\nHT: By this time, I was dancing with a dance company ha! So, when I was a correctional officer and a firefighter, I would spend my weekends going to rehearsals for dance and I slowly transitioned that into the theater. So I started doing plays, but I always had my firefighter job and it was one of the reasons that I took it. Not only because of the adrenaline rush, but I knew that as a firefighter, I had a lot of time off and I used that time off to do all of the things that I was passionate about.\n\nAM: In your acting career, you have done a lot of things on the stage and a number of TV shows from NBC's Law & Order to The Blacklist, do you find when you’re preparing for a role for the stage vs. on TV that it is a different process for you?\n\nHT: Yes! I love the theater because you get time to really rehearse, practice and to really live in these spaces. When you're with the people that you’re working with, you get to create and work through the costumes. It’s just a different process that goes into theater that I really love! I love being being on TV too! There is a different way that you have to create and prepare for theater then you do with TV or film. I love that process in theater.\n\nAM: I remember when The Blacklist started that it would be a show that I was going to enjoy. I’m a huge fan of James Spader (Stargate, Secretary, Boston Legal) as well as Amir Arison (Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Billions, The Dropout) and Harry Lennix (The Matrix Reloaded, Ray, Billions) that are core and original castmembers with you. There have been so many people that have been guest stars with the show from Stacy Keach (Mickey Spillane’s Mike Hammer, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, Blue Bloods), David Costabile (Breaking Bad, Suits, Billions), Anthony Michael Hall (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, The Goldbergs) the late Lance Reddick (Oz, The Wire, BOSCH), etc. You play Dembe Zuma. How did you find out about the show and what did you know about your character when you read for the part?\n\nHT: I knew nothing! My character wasn’t in the pilot, but that was the only episode that I missed. After the pilot, James requested that he should have a team around him. So initially, I was this Muslim African Freedom Fighter who was rescued by Red from human trafficking as a child. So my audition was all improv. I had no lines so I just made up a backstory that came from my life and experience. It was only supposed to be for 1 episode, so there wasn’t really any pressure or angst about it. Then, it turned into something different than what I had anticipated or even expected! But that was that journey of that process. But it wasn’t like I was initially being brought into a series regular role! But this is where we are after 10 years!\n\nAM: You’re character has such a presence whether it was when he wasn’t talking, or he was a man of few words and now having more evolved storylines, how do you approach your character?\n\nHT: I really draw a lot from personal experiences! I take a lot from my personal life and I put it onto this character. I wouldn’t say that it was easy, but what I have learned especially in not taking the traditional route in acting – the hard thing for me was getting the training and learning how as well as what tools need to be used in order to tell a story. I pull from these experiences that I have had from getting into character and doing all of that, that’s the easy part because I have had such a colorful life. So it was just getting the training and learning about pulling the different emotions and experiences so I could put them into Dembe.\n\nAM: Up until Season 9, we see Dembe and Red and their dynamic and you really create a sense of humanity and a bit of a moral compass for him. What was it like to play off of James Spader?\n\nHT: The interesting thing was, I didn’t know anything about James Spader! Luckily for me I didn’t come in with all of these notions about him so it worked out great. As I started to work with him, that’s when it really became evident to me. He is so intense and that’s when I was like, “oh My God, this guy!” It’s not even that I’m working with James Spader – it was that I am working with this extremely talented human being. You know, our chemistry – we just have it! Anytime we got into a scene, it was like these sparks just flew whether we were improving certain things or reading off the page, we have always had this amazing chemistry. It’s an amazing thing to have and to play off of and I am greatly appreciative of!\n\nAM: In Season 9, your character joins the FBI! What do you think about this twist in the storyline and being able to work in a different way with other members of the cast? We’re assuming that you played off of things in your own life to bring these nuances to life as well for the switch in his character.\n\nHT: Absolutely, it was definitely different especially going from not really speaking that much to downloading the Task Force on who the next Blacklister is so it was definitely a shift. I went out and got myself an acting coach to make sure that I was approaching it right and putting on a whole other layer of Dembe which was challenging but also exciting. I welcomed it and also enjoyed it. A lot of people disagree and say that I should go back with Red! I think that as an actor, it was something that I definitely welcomed and I had fun playing with even though I missed the chemistry that I had with James.\n\nAM: Before we delve into the final season, how do you describe Dembe and what are the similarities between you and the character? Have you been able to give back feedback to the writer’s room in terms of how Dembe develops?\n\nHT: Oh absolutely! I think that in the beginning, because Dembe wasn’t scripted, there was just so much that we didn’t know. It wasn’t until Season 3, 4 or even 5 that I started having conversations with John Bokenkamp (The Call, The Blacklist, The Blacklist: Redemption), the creator of the show and we talked about who is Dembe and what did he look like? We knew he was Muslim and we didn’t get to see any of that so it was really important to me especially since I am Muslim that we make sure that we are authentic about that and that we show that. They agreed. We talked a lot and we had a lot of conversations and we see him praying and doing these things which meant a lot to me. That’s also hard to let go because I’ve been part of building this character and flushing him out as opposed to this character being presented to me. I enjoyed all of that!\n\nWho is Dembe? Dembe because of the evolution of how he came to be, Dembe is kind of me! I kind of consider myself a quiet guy and I think that the only thing that you won’t see Dembe do is that I’m a funny/silly guy! Sometimes we see Red and Dembe have these card games and to play like kids. We see a little bit of that. A lot of Dembe is really me minus the violence.\n\nAM: What can you tell us about the final season or what should we be looking for?\n\nHT: I think that we all know that all The Blacklisters are coming after Red. We also know that because they’re coming after Red and because of Dembe’s affiliation with him, now he is also in danger. It just sets the stakes really really high. I think that what it also does is that Dembe has dealt with conflict, but now he’s really conflicted because of not being with Red in this most dangerous time since he is on the Task Force. I think that what we’re going to see play out in Season 10 is this back and forth of being able to choose a side. At the same time, being this moral compass and what that conflict looks like.\n\nAM: You have been in this cast for the past 10 seasons. What are some of your favorite moments from the show?\n\nHT: I loved when I got to play with Mr. Solomon, Edi Gathegi (Twilight, The Twilight Saga: New Moon, X-Men: First Class) character – I love that episode with the pool balls and getting tortured and going after him. That one stands out. There are so many, but I also loved just because of how I came into acting and all of these people that I looked up to. I loved the time that I got to play with Benga who was in Season 9 – being my daughter and being kidnapped that was an amazing episode for me. I loved the episode where we got to explore my religion and faith not only personally, but also with Dembe. Then there are some amazing episodes in Season 10 that I can’t speak on, but I’m really excited about that. There’s one episode where we have never seen about Dembe. I’m excited to see how that played out. Out of 10 years, there have been so many beautiful moments as you know. But those are some of the moments that I really enjoyed.\n\nAM: What will be your biggest takeaway from being part of this production?\n\nHT: That’s hard, I learned so much watching James and how he works and how specific he is. Just how he approaches everything – that’s something that I will take away from it. Being prepared for the unexpected because this was definitely unexpected. In 10 years, I’ve grown so much, I’m a whole different person and there’s so much growth that I have had. Not just professionally, but also personally. The biggest takeaway in terms of the craft is just seeing how dedicated James was and learning how he approaches it and putting those tools in my pocket as I’m moving forward.\n\nAM: What will we see you doing next? Are there any projects that you’re able to share with us or things on your bucket list whether it’s in front of or behind the camera?\n\nHT: I’m a Sci-Fi geek, so I’d definitely like to do anything Sci-Fi! I love westerns so I would love to be a cowboy, but after a show like this, I’m also in love with doing something that doesn’t have fun and just a drama between me and my son, me and my wife or something like that. Anything and everything! I’ve also been working on a documentary about my life so all of those things, I would love to tackle. That’s the scary thing about not knowing what’s next up for me professionally. Like I said, I would love to be an astronaut in space or riding around on a horse!\n\nIG @hishamtawfiq\n\nPHOTGRAPHY CREDITS | PG 104, 106, + 113 Will Hart/NBC | PG 109 Virginia Sherwood/NBC | PG 110 Scott Gries/NBC |\n\nAM: I remember when I first saw you for Def Comedy Jam as a standup comedian and then you went onto SNL as a writer and a performer! What was that experience like?\n\nJBS: To me it was great. But again, you gotta make decisions on your movement because when I started on Def Comedy Jam and I was on BET and did all of these TV shows, guest-starring, touring in colleges, those road gigs, tours and all of the things that I have done, making the decision to move to LA, doing all of that stuff and making the decision to go on Cedric the Entertainer Presents, getting on Lyricists Lounge Show – doing guest spots on TV shows, doing my first CBS deal – all those things I’ve done.\n\nThen to sit there and say, “ok I have this audition for SNL.” My second time auditioning for SNL actually. I did it twice. I was going for cast member. For me, you sit there and you say, I’m going in for cast member and I didn’t make the show as a performer but I ended up making the show as a writer. Even when I got the offer for a writer, I was in the middle of a deal for a host of stuff of my own so I had to say do I put myself on hold to work on Saturday Night Live? So I sat and thought about it and decided that it would look great on my resume so I said, as more of a business move. I know that the percentage of shows that actually air are so small and back then it was REALLY hard! Back then we didn’t have streaming services. We didn’t have Netflix and Hulu and Amazon. We didn’t have any of this stuff. It was just regular TV, HBO and Showtime. We had the premium channels but those opportunities, we didn’t have as big of a chance to get someone to air. I had to sit there and say, “ok. If I put this to the side and do this, how can I make this work for me?” I said, I will do this and then figure it out later. But this is going to look great on my resume – SNL.\n\nSo I came to SNL and when I got here, I ended up doing sketches, I ended up being a writer on the show, I ended up doing monologues on the show and ended up doing all these amazing things for the show and doing warmups for my 3 seasons. So I ended up doing a lot of stuff and that was 4 different checks – that’s a NY hustle right there! But that’s also being someone who has different skills – who can be a utility person – 4 things at the same time. That helps me and shows how I can be versatile. I can do 4 jobs at once.\n\nFor me, it worked out perfect. I had the chance to be JB, I had a chance to be someone who's able to do all of these amazing things and at the same time, it allowed me to work and build my resume and network with these amazing guest stars of the show. So it was definitely a process. I can’t say that it was easy – it was hard work because you’re talking about someone going from being a standup comedian to being a writer. I wasn’t a traditional writer. I improvise a lot in my standup so for me it made more sense to take it, do all of my skills under one roof. I did 3 seasons over there and it looks great on my resume, so it served its purpose doing it that way.\n\nNone of those other opportunities went away, the opportunities for TV shows were still there, the opportunities for movies were still there and I was still able to leave there and do a bunch of movies – The Sitter, Hall Pass, Date Night all in a row. I got a chance to do all of that stuff and when I was working over at SNL, I did Conan O’Brien. Conan O’Brien’s show, he was still at NBC at that time and I did his show as a sketch artist 10 times. So I had a chance to get from behind the desk typing jokes, go downstairs on the elevator and do a sketch with Conan and then get back in the elevator upstairs to finish working. I got a chance to do so many things while I was over there. Again, it wasn’t easy and it was humbling in some sense. You’re in control on stage but you’re not in control on this show which is live TV. Everything is just fast. You have to sit there and write all night long for these sketches and it’s humbling because it’s like your trying out for the cheerleading team or the football team and you go in the hallway and they put the list up of who made the team. There was a piece of paper in the hallway that said whose sketch made it and you had to read that list on the wall and you’d say, \"damn, I didn’t get it.\"\n\nAM: Oh wow that happened every week!\n\nJBS: It was an amazing experience and I wouldn't change that for anything in the world. I would have rather taken this process that I have already completed rather than this fast and quick process that these young people are doing now. I had more time to smell the roses.\n\nAM: I’m a huge fan of Curb Your Enthusiasm, you joined it in the 6th season and I know that the 12th season is coming back, how did you get attached to the show and how involved are you in creating and evolving the character of Leon Black?\n\nJBS: Oh man! My wife told me that I was going to be on the show. We would watch the show, we loved the show and even when I was on SNL, we would talk about the show on our writing days. One day I said, that I would love to be on the show and man I got the opportunity. I always say that one thing has to step out of the way in order for something else to come through. I didn’t get renewed for my 4th season of SNL and I literally went from coming to LA for a friend’s memorial – my friend Oji Pierce who composed and produced This is How We Do It and I was there for his memorial service. I make moves because I trust my process and I trust my talent. I know I always bounce back from things. I had actually fired my agent – I fired every damn body! I knew that once I fired them, I wasn’t going back to SNL.\n\nThe agents are the ones that fight for you and keep you hired. They are the ones that call and make it go. I said, well if I fire my agent who I am not happy with, I know for a fact, that I will not get spoken about and they’re not going to push to keep me on the show if they’re not getting paid to do what they do. So I said, “well, I’m going to see what happens.” I fired them and I knew I wasn’t going back and for a fact that with no one there to speak for me, there was no way that I was going to be able to stay at SNL.\n\nSo I took that chance, I rolled the dice and I took that chance. Low and behold, I didn’t get renewed. I was out on the road for a month doing standup. Oji passed away, my wife already told me that I was going to be on Curb Your Enthusiasm and I got a phone call of my friend passing and I went to LA for one day. I signed with a new agent before I went to LA, went to meet them when I got to LA and one of the agents said, “man, I have an audition for you – how long are you in town?” I told them that I had come into town for 1 day to pay respects to my buddy and I was going back tomorrow.\n\nHe said he had an audition for me and I asked him what it was for and he said, Curb Your Enthusiasm. I said, “get out of here, you have to be kidding me!” I went on the audition and you know, I did what I did well which is improvise which takes these scenes and make them my own. Let me do what I do because I’m going to do what I do! Me and Larry hit it off in the audition. We hit it off to the point where we were in there laughing our butts off and having a good time. We became friends that day. I left there and said to myself, if someone gets that job, God bless them, but me and that man had a great time! That leads to me being on the greatest improvised show to me in TV history.\n\nSo, my process is, I’m an improv guy. I have been improvising my entire life and I think that that’s a life choice too. Improvising gives you the ability to change your mind in the moment where no one will ever know that you changed your mind! Improvising will give you the ability to sway someone in a different direction. Improvising gives you a way of reading energy and reading their body language – all of these great things that you can do by knowing the process and being able to improvise. It pays off in life, it pays off in acting, it pays off in real estate sales if you’re a realtor. You can be anyone you want, but if you improvise just a little bit, it allows you to pick up little nuances about people that you can use to your advantage.\n\nI think that that’s what helps me so much having to improvise in my standup career so much. It really allowed me to take that skill and to use that 1 little improv class that I took that summer before I started doing standup. I would tell anyone that they should take improv – I don’t care what you do. That allowed me to really hone in on my acting skills and to get in the moment which makes my standup shows so different. I’m literally listening to what this particular audience is laughing at which is what I apply to Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nWhatever is working for my character and sometimes, I don’t know what I will do with my character. Sometimes I don’t know. Sometimes I just go with what the scene is and I take that. Sometimes what I do is, I will decide in the moment if I want to have Larry’s back or if I want to go against Larry. I decide right there, do I want to be on Larry’s side or will I go against him – what is the better argument here? I really decide in the moment and it gives me the upper hand and let’s me drive that. It also lets me give him something new that he doesn’t know about the character every time I work with him. That way, I create these forks in the road – these branches to the character. My character has never been defined. We still don’t know where the hell he came from – so for me to be able to make that up over the 6 seasons that I have been there is great! I can still tell people a little more that they need to know about Leon which makes it fun!\n\nAM: You have been in so many series and films from Spider-Man movies, co-hosting – what do you look for when you’re sent projects and what goes into your decision on whether you’re going to participate in something?\n\nJBS: I go by this, which works for me: I read the script of course. If they specifically call for me, I’m kind of past the audition process at this point because I am established all these years. I get offers for things and I can say yay or nay to the offer. Once in a while, I have to read for something – once in a while. It could be something very specific or something that is outside of my lane and it’s to show that I can do something if it’s a drama or something like that. If I meet a director or a producer and they ask for me specifically and they say that they want me to make my character my own, that is the most precious words that I can hear for an improv guy or a guy that they can trust to do that character. When they say, “make the character your own JB. We love your voice and your sensibilities and we love what you do and we want you to be that character and vice versa.” So I’m like cool, let me make it my own and I take that character and I make them my own. This happens in movies, in TV, in commercials, in animations – it doesn’t matter. They let me do me and if it’s animations, I say let me see the character so I can see who it is and then I can take that character and then I can make that character my own.\n\nAM: You also have Four Courses with JB Smoove, why did you want to do this?\n\nJBS: You know what. I love talk shows and I love talking to friends and I’m good at it. I love to sit there and kick it and have a convo with people and that is what makes interviewing people so fun. I’m curious of the process. I’m curious about your path and I’m really engaged. I love to laugh and I love the stories. I love to tell stories and I love to be interviewed while I’m interviewing – you know what I’m saying? I think that’s fun. I love to be interviewed while I’m interviewing.\n\nAM: Last year when May I Elaborate? first came out, I knew I would be obsessed with it. I love hearing you and Miles Grose talking back and forth about various topics and it was a great way to start my day. Why did you want to create this podcast show?\n\nJBS: You know what? It was one of those things where everybody was doing podcasts. I knew that if everyone was doing podcasts, I had to do something that was funny, insightful and I like to give what I call, broken wisdom sometimes! I feel like there’s more than 1 way for you to be able to get it. For some people, you have to shake it out of their ass and then you have to shake it into them and then shake whatever the issue is out of them at the same time. I think of that tough hard love in a funny way and in a way that makes sense to people. I’m giving it to you in a way that is like a friend. I’m not a doctor, I don’t know it all, I know a lot about everything and a little bit about nothing. You need that balance! You have to tell people sometimes that, “I’m not sure but God damn, I know you got to give it to them like that and here’s what I would do.” I can’t say it’s going to work, but this is what I would do and this is how to get the process started. You sometimes have to get out of your own fucking head. If I can get you out of your own head, I’m halfway there! That’s the block right there. You’re like a controlled schizophrenic – you are battling yourself in your own head. Different versions of you don’t know how to handle certain things. So you’re stuck in a certain place and you just need to find some kind of way to talk to the right person in your head to get it moving in the right direction.\n\nWe fell in love with Laurie Hernandez's personality and energy when she competed in her inaugural debut at the Summer Games 2016 in Rio! She showcased her skill and commitment to the sport of gymnastics with the Final Five and left with a team gold medal and a silver as an individual.\n\nWe wanted to know what she has been up to since we last saw her on the global stage, how she maintained her training during the pandemic as well as a number of projects she has taken on - including, winning ABC's Dancing with the Stars in season 23 with her partner, Val Chmerkovskiy. We're also looking forward to seeing her in Golden, a docuseries on Peacock that takes us behind the scenes on what it takes to make the Team USA Women's Olympic Gymnastic team as she prepares for the Summer Games in Tokyo.\n\nATHLEISURE MAG: When did you fall in love with gymnastics and what was the moment that you realized that you wanted to go professional?\n\nLAURIE HERNANDEZ: I fell in love with the sport when I was watching it on TV as a little girl. The gymnasts were such an amazing mix of power and grace that I looked at my mom and told her “I want to do that!” and not long afterwards my parents started me in gymnastics.\n\nAM: What is a normal day or week like for you when you’re in training mode and do you have go to movements that you enjoy incorporating into your fitness routine?\n\nLH: I practice Monday-Friday around 5 hours a day and Saturdays for about 3 hours. I also have physical therapy twice a week to help with any aches and pains. Before training I use Hyperice tools like a Hypervolt gun to help with warming up my muscles and at home Normatec leg compression for recovery.\n\nAM: Did you always feel that the Olympics would be part of your journey as an athlete and what does it mean to you to represent the nation on such a global stage?\n\nLH: It was always a dream to go to the Olympics but of course when I first started I had no idea where it was going to lead.\n\nAM: In terms of the sport of gymnastics, we’re familiar with the activities that take place; however, do each of you have your specialties that you take on and if so, what are yours and why do you gravitate to them?\n\nLH: Absolutely! Every gymnast has their own strengths that they bring to the sport and that’s what makes it so fun to watch. I love to perform and get the crowd involved so floor exercise is one of my favorites!\n\nAM: At the Summer Games in Rio in 2016, you received a gold medal as the Final Five team and silver individually for beam. What was it like to be there for your first Olympics and competing with your team?\n\nLH: It was such an honor to represent the USA and I will never forget the feeling of standing on the podium, listening to the National Anthem with USA on our uniform. What hit me even more once I got home was the impact it had on the young Latinx generation. I had parents come up to me and tell them that their child had started gymnastics because they saw me at the Olympics and I looked like them which gave them the confidence to start the sport. That has really stuck with me and something I will forever cherish.\n\nAM: Last year at this time, the Olympics was in limbo although it seemed like it would be postponed. We have talked with a number of athletes about how they had to modify their workouts as they didn’t have access to their normal facilities. Did you find yourself doing workouts that were modified (ie Ryan Murphy was pushing a car up his hill, April Ross created a gym in her home, Steele Johnson was walking on his hands in his backyard) in order to get in a good workout and to stay on track?\n\nLH: Of course. I was doing stretches and yoga in my home to keep up my flexibility, going through routines mentally, running in my neighborhood, etc.\n\nAM: You just competed at the Winter Cup earlier this year which you choreographed and was Hamilton inspired – what was that like and what are your personal goals as you anticipate a second appearance at the Summer Games?\n\nLH: I loved being back out on the competition floor and had so much fun with my new floor routine! I did go back and do a few small choreography edits so stay tuned for my next competition. One of my biggest goals this whole journey is to comeback for myself and to have fun with the sport.\n\nAM: Tell us about Golden. I know that LeBron James and Maverick Carter’sUninterrupted are creating this docuseries that includes you and additional gymnast Olympic hopefuls to obtain the remaining 4 spots. What can we expect from this show, do you know when it’s available on Peacock and why did you want to participate?\n\nLH: It will focus on the day-to-day repetition it takes to become an elite athlete in our sport and a behind the scenes look at the ins and outs of our daily lives. I love all the girls that are participating alongside me and some are my close friends, so it made it a fun project!\n\nAM: The Road to Tokyo has a number of events to qualify for being on the team. What’s your schedule look like right now and what competitions should we keep an eye out for?\n\nLH: My next upcoming competition is the U.S. Classics on May 22nd.\n\nAM: Part of the fun of the Olympic Games in addition to the actual competition, is being able to navigate the city outside of the Olympic Village. As we’re all emerging from lockdowns, have you been given a sense of what being at the Summer Games will be like outside of when you’re training and competing?\n\nLH: We have not been given any specifics, but I know that without family and friends in the stands it will feel a bit different than previous Games.\n\nAM: After a successful debut at the Olympics, you took some time off and won ABC’s Dancing with the Stars, published 2 books and were the inaugural host of NBC’s American Ninja Warrior Junior – why was it important for you to take the time off to take on these projects?\n\nLH: It was super important for me to take time off and find out who I was and what I liked outside of gymnastics. Something my mom always told me was you are Laurie who just so happens to do gymnastics, there is much more to you than just one thing. Finding my love for dancing, acting, and hosting was very rewarding and also helped me realize I still loved the sport too.\n\nAM: How important is it for you to balance your competitive nature while also embracing positive mental health and fueling your creative side?\n\nLH: Extremely important. Mental Health awareness is something I am very passionate about sharing and embrace fully. This was actually another reason partnering with Little Words Project was a great fit. Spreading kindness and self-love is huge and I hope others benefit from wearing some of my favorite words and affirmations.\n\nWe can't tell you how many times we've enjoyed watching NBC's Law & Order marathons whether it's the flagship program, Criminal Intent or SVU. We love our fair share of True Crime and the squad members that we get to know each season. When Law & Order: SVU came back last fall, its 21st season (they have now been renewed for an additional 3 seasons), marking it as the longest running drama series in history. Along with more stories ripped from the headlines, advocating for victims and getting to know many of our faves, Jamie Gray Hyder joined the cast as Officer Katriona \"Kat\" Azar Tamin who is learning the ropes, coming in with her style of tracking criminals and learning how to grow with her squad.\n\nThis month's shoot for our 50th issue showcases a number of pre-Spring looks worn by Jamie Gray Hyder who is known for her voice acting work in the Call of Duty video games, HBO's True Blood and a number of other projects. We took some time to find out more about how she got into the entertainment industry, how she prepares for her roles as well as how it is to be in this acclaimed and iconic show!\n\nATHLEISURE MAG: We’ve been fans of yours since you’ve been on HBO’s True Blood, a number of our readers play video games and have enjoyed your voice acting on them. Can you tell us how you got into the entertainment industry?\n\nJAMIE GRAY HYDER: I’ve been acting since I was a kid. I’ve been a classically trained vocalist since I was really young. I have always been performing and then when I got into college and studying straight acting and kind of left the musical theater world, that’s when I sort of honed in on film and television and working on screens. So after college, I moved out to LA to try to get it going.\n\nAM: What have been some of the shows that readers have seen you in prior to NBC’s Law & Order SVU?\n\nJGH: My first sort of big break was on True Blood. They initially hired me to do a smaller part for 2 episodes and we all worked together really well and they liked the character. So I ended up staying for 2 seasons. For me, that was a huge learning experience and a huge validating experience. To work with HBO as my first home is something that I am really grateful for.\n\nAM: You are so extremely versatile. We’ve enjoyed seeing you in a number of ways such as David Guetta’s music videos. How do you prepare yourself for all of these different types of opportunities?\n\nJGH: You sort of have to find the through-line in what you bring to each one and for me that came down to getting comfortable with what I already bring to the table. Self-awareness is really important because that’s going to be the thread that binds it no matter whether you’re doing video games, television or music videos. If you’re not comfortable with yourself and comfortable with sort of what you provide on naturally, then you’re not really going to know where to go from there.\n\nFor me, becoming more comfortable with myself and increasing my self-awareness was a tool that I think has helped me through all of the different mediums.\n\nAM: So Law & Order as a franchise, we can’t tell you how many hours a week that we have enjoyed watching it. It’s something we love watching whether it’s Law & Order, Criminal Intent or SVU. How did you get the call that you are joining the cast?\n\nJGH: Initially, they brought me on to do a few episodes as a guest star and we were going to feel out her role as a regular. Then when they decided to keep me and called me, I lost it and I started crying. I couldn’t believe it because not only am I a part of such a legendary show, but such a historic season. So I get all the weight that comes with that even though this is my first season. So to be tied into such a monumental achievement for the show has been something that has is very rare and something that I am really grateful for.\n\nAM: Tell us who is Officer Katriona “Kat” Azar Tamin?\n\nJGH: Officer Kat and Jamie actually have a lot in common when it comes to being driven and sometimes stubborn and independent. Kat is more reserved when it comes to, I think, her personality, but when it comes to the way she approaches her work and fighting for these victims, she really leads with her heart. I think you’ll see her attempting to create more of a balance between her head and her heart as we continue on. Right now, she is still a little bit rough around the edges kind of learning how to conduct herself in this new world and this new set of rules and structure. While she is a little bit out of line here and there, I think that as she grows and becomes more comfortable with her role in the squad room I think you’ll see her settle in a little bit better.\n\nAM: What is it like working with this amazing cast of characters and people such as Ice-T and Mariska Hargitay. What is that like as we have a number of Law & Order fans who would love to know.\n\nJGH: I learned so much from them both professionally and personally every day. Ice has sort of had my back very much so from the beginning just like Finn has had Kat’s back from the beginning. He and I connected instantly over my work in the music industry. My side job in LA was working at a recording studio called Record Plant. So I worked there for 4 years and dealt with a lot of the same people and personality types and scenarios that Ice has kind of grown up in. So we shared a lot of those kinds of experiences. With Mariska, it’s sort of a daily lesson in how to lead and how to inspire and motivate people. All of my castmates have families and they all have children. They all come in and focus and bring a fresh energy every single day. That’s easy for me as a new person, but thinking into working on something for 5-10-20 years, you might get jaded. Every single one of my castmates comes in fresh daily which is something that I find super impressive.\n\nAM: You guys cover a lot of really heavy topics. In terms of preparing, as your episodes are inspired by cases that took place in real life, and I’m sure there is a lot of work in terms of understanding the victim, how you would play the role, how it would be like for them to come to you etc. How do you take that on as it seems like that would take a lot to be in those positions?\n\nJGH: Before we do each episode, we are sent a whole research packet that has a bunch of news articles and things that all deals with the scenario that we are dealing with on the show. While we don’t necessarily represent certain people or events, often times we are pulling from the news and real people. For me, it’s very much a motivating factor. You have to put aside whatever you’re dealing with personally and really give value to what you are doing because there are real people dealing with these types of issues in their real lives. While we have to keep it light on set as much as we can because we are dealing with heavy material every single day. I think that approaching it with a little bit of reverence is the way that we all really justify what we are doing and just knowing that there are real people out there that are being positively impacted by our show is something that is never lost on us.\n\nAM: So you guys are currently filming season 21 right now. What is a week like when you’re balancing between filming for the show and then what do you do when you’re not on set?\n\nWhen the holiday season hits we tend to think about the umpteen events we are invited to and of course, closing out the year which means something a little different depending on what you do! We caught up with Parveen Kaur as she is in the midst of tapings for her hit show, Manifest which debuted this fall and will be back from its midseason break on Jan 7th! We have been fans of a number of her shows including Saving Hope, FX’s The Strain and Freeform's Beyond. We sat down with her to find out about what it’s like during Pilot Season, playing Saanvi on NBC’s hit show, what’s coming up for the remainder of the season and how she takes time for herself in the midst of such a crazy schedule!\n\nATHLEISURE MAG: What was the moment when you realized that you wanted to be an actor?\n\nPARVEEN KAUR: Oh oh that’s a really good question! I don’t know if there was ever a particular moment, but I had always known that ever since I was really young that I was going to be in show business and I kind of went all over the place I remember at one point I was like, I am going to be a WWE wrestler and then I thought I wanted to be a stunt driver. Then I was like, I want to be a singer but it all kind of fell under this umbrella of wanting to be able to perform.\n\nWhen I moved to Toronto when I was 18, I just had a friend that encouraged me to take some classes and it was something that felt natural and I had a lot of fun doing it. I think that was around the time when I felt like, yeah let’s do it – I was working at the mall and I wanted to figure out what I actually wanted to do with my life. The stars just kind of aligned in that way and then I was able to get an agent pretty quickly and then I just kind of kept at it. I mean I just really loved it and I still really just love it!\n\nAM: That is a great story. What is Pilot Season and what is its duration as we always hear people refer to it, but it seems like there is so much that takes place within this.\n\nPK: Yeah – so Pilot Season is typically from January to March. It’s a couple of months where studios are just trying to throw their scripts at the wall and seeing what sticks, making new projects and seeing what will be the next big thing in a condensed period of four months. All the studios are putting out their scripts and seeing what can be made and what will hopefully be their next big hit. Now Pilot Season isn’t just about being between January and March – I think that timeline has grown a little bit, but that is definitely the most. You’re going on like 4-5 auditions a day, you’re getting the script the night before and then you’re auditioning the next morning and it’s very fast.\n\nIf you are lucky to be booked for something, the Pilot gets made and then you also keep hoping that it gets turned into a series – because there are no guarantees that this will happen. Pilot Season is VERY stressful.\n\nAM: That’s intense! So if you’re getting all of these scripts with different characters/personalities and going to the auditions, how do you prepare for all of them with so little time? What is the preparation for Pilot Season versus when you are working on a show like Manifest that you know has already been greenlit?\n\nPK: Well you don’t prepare for it in Pilot Season. It’s like a marathon and your stamina has to be there, you go in and you just hope that whatever little time that you do get that people will see you potential! You’re right that it’s such a short period of time and you’re hoping that you go into the room and that the casting director is mindful of the fact that there is such little time and that they are looking strictly for whether I could be this person and not so much that this person is the one. It’s just not a lot of time to prepare. Now when I am on Manifest, or when you are on a show, it’s such a luxury!\n\nAM: Knowing this, looking at you being on Manifest, how did you prepare for this role, what was the process like to be on this show and what was the audition like?\n\nPK: So ok, I have the quintessential sad actor story for how I got into Manifest. So I was in Pilot Season and I was really close to getting on another show as I had not read the one for Manifest yet. This script fell into my lap and I fell in love with it and it doesn’t happen so often – like in every Pilot Season you may get 2 or 3 that you really love or connect with. It’s just that it’s such a high volume season that you’re reading so many of them – it may be only 1 that you really love. When I found out that I didn’t get the other project, I was really devastated and that one hit me really hard! It was my third year doing pilot season and it is really draining and you start thinking, “Oh my God it’s never going to happen.”\n\nI was in this rut for a couple of days and then Manifest fell into my lap and then I read for Saanvi. I just took all that tension and weight that I was carrying from that rejection and I put it into my audition. It couldn’t have been more – I mean it’s that cliché of sometimes things are meant to be and happen in a certain way. Things were supposed to happen that way and I took that energy and put it into my Manifest audition and then the next day they were like, we’re going to have to fly you to NY to audition for David Frankel and I was still in kind of a funk because the same thing had happened to me for other shows. I’m based in Toronto, so you get that call and you’re being flown to LA or to NYC – where you are one step closer but it doesn’t turn into anything. So, I was still in that mind frame and when I went in to audition for David Frankel, I took the pressure off of myself and it ended up being the best audition that I have ever had in my life and it has forever changed the way that I now audition which is great!\n\nAM: How do you describe Saanvi and what do you see as similarities or differences between you and her?\n\nPK: Well Saanvi is a lot smarter than I am ha ha! When I had spoken to Jeff Rake showrunner and the creator of our show, he really described her to me as someone that is tough as nails, a fighter and someone that is really resilient. To me, that was very exciting to play someone like that. I feel that that part of her description is a common characteristic of her and I. Like, I have had an interesting upbringing and I have gone through a few things that made me resilient and maybe I have put up some walls and Saanvi has definitely done that as well – we haven’t seen her have any kind of breakdown like some of the other characters have had on the show. They are really struggling and Saanvi is really just pushing forward and just putting her head down and really just focusing on the work and looking at what happened. She just has this wall up and is guarded as well and I can understand that side of it. That will change as you will see when we get back to air as she has a huge turning point and I think fans will be excited to see this!\n\nAM: We were wondering if there would be more about her backstory – does she have a love life? Her head down approach has been great, but it felt like there should be more about her and we know that you can’t give it away!\n\nPK: No spoilers! I think that since the rest of the cast is so traumatized, not to say that she is not, but I think that she is a good balance and counterpart to the Stone family. I mean, they are really struggling as they have so much going on in their personal lives and she has been a good balance for them and the show. She is being shown as someone who has yet to absorb what has happened and she will! I’m so glad that the writers have waited to show this and I think that when people see what she is about to go through, I think that that will be really rewarding for the fans, everyone that watches and even for me as an actor. I have been patiently waiting for something to happen so when it does, I am really grateful.\n\nAM: What’s great about the show is that you have two major pillars, obviously what has happened in terms of what took place on that flight and then it’s the Stone family. But the way that the other characters are integrated, you don’t feel that they are side people – they are just as important as the family. It’s like looking at a diamond with a number of facets and I think that’s what draws people in. You end up finishing the episode and talking with others about it and going online to read theories and it makes it a fun show to watch and to talk about.\n\nPK: Do you have any theories?\n\nAM: What is your process when you are looking at a character that you want to play? Once again, I loved you in Billions (Showtime) – especially when these characters are so different. You have played a number of characters across shows and although I know it’s you – you bring such a different approach to each one. Some people when they portray roles, still bring a lot of themselves into each one – do you get what we’re trying to say?\n\nEA: Yes I do know what you are trying to say and I’m really touched that you say that because I think that is – it’s not a part of my mindful process so much as I guess, I don’t know coming from my sort of life reading a lot, and I was an English and Theater major in college and so I really love text. I love textual analysis so for me I guess, it all just comes from me really looking at the script and looking at what the writer is doing and then just imagining if I was that person in that place. So I don’t think about, “oh this is – I don’t judge my character in any sort of way\" and I really feel that I am just playing myself, but if it were me and my entire life was different and my development was different and I did this thing and these were the words that I say or at least that is 100% of my process for on camera stuff.\n\nFor theater, it’s a little different. Sometimes I will mostly think about how would this character sort of hold themselves physically different or how their voice would be physically different then mine. So it’s also sort of like, technical things that show up. But, then there’s – I don’t know – why I do the thing as there is some kind of magical thing that happens and if I just put myself in the situation then I am just suddenly this totally different person. So on my – I remember on The Slap, one of the producers, because it was like the first big thing that I did for TV. I had done a couple of small reoccurring things before. But a producer came up\n\nto me and we were in the middle of filming and really quickly he said, “I love your performance on this” and I thought, “I have a performance?” I mean I was just so focused on the thought of, what if I was a lawyer, a D.A. and got some wonderful thoughts from Ken Olin (Dir/Exec Producer - This is Us) – one of my favorite directors that I have ever worked with – I adore him. I incorporated those into thinking about what would be my life goals and what I would want to be. But I didn’t think of it as a performance and similarly, when I came in on my first day, I thought that I was just going to say the words and everybody was like, “oh I really love what you’re doing,” and I thought, “I’m doing something? Great, I’ll keep doing it.”\n\nWorking on The Sinner was just incredible – it was one of the greatest blessings on my life so far and part of what was so much fun about that was just that – th"
