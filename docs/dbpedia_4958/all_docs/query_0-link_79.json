        "text": "Gregory Boyle, the beloved Jesuit priest and author of the inspirational bestsellers Tattoos on the Heart and Barking to the Choir, returns with a call to witness the transformative power of tenderness, rooted in his lifetime of experience counseling gang members in Los Angeles.\n\nOver the past thirty years, Gregory Boyle has transformed thousands of lives through his work as the founder of Homeboy Industries, the largest and most successful gang-intervention program in the world. Boyle’s new book, The Whole Language, follows the acclaimed bestsellers Tattoos on the Heart, hailed as an “astounding literary and spiritual feat” (Publishers Weekly) that is “destined to become a classic of both urban reportage and contemporary spirituality” (Los Angeles Times), and Barking to the Choir, deemed “a beautiful and important and soul-transporting book” by Elizabeth Gilbert, and declared by Ann Patchett to be “a book that shows what the platitudes of faith look like when they’re put into action.”\n\nIn a community struggling to overcome systemic poverty and violence, The Whole Language shows how those at Homeboy Industries fight despair and remain generous, hopeful, and tender. When Saul was thirteen years old, he killed his abusive stepfather in self-defense; after spending twenty-three years in juvenile and adult jail, he enters the Homeboy Industries training and healing programs and embraces their mission. Declaring, “I’ve decided to grow up to be somebody I always needed as a child,” Saul shows tenderness toward the young men in his former shoes, treating them all like his sons and helping them to find their way. Before coming to Homeboy Industries, a young man named Abel was shot thirty-three times, landing him in a coma for six months followed by a year and a half recuperating in the hospital.

Bursting with encouragement, humor, and hope, The Whole Language invites us to treat others–and ourselves–with acceptance and tenderness.\n\nDiscover the USA Today bestselling self-help memoir from a former Army Ranger, a hero of the 2012 Benghazi siege, and the subject of the book and movie 13 Hours, as he shares life-changing lessons of discipline, motivation, success, and peace.\n\nThousands of people have heard Kris “Tanto” Paronto speak about his experiences in Benghazi on September 11, 2012.

A 23-year-old Black man, Jarvis was sentenced to death in the gas chamber. While in the maximum security section of Death Row, using the only instrument available to him–a ball-point pen filler–Masters’s astounding memoir is a testament to the tenacity of the human spirit and the talent of a fine writer.\n\nOffering us scenes from his life that are at times poignant, revelatory, frightening, soul-stirring, painful, funny and uplifting, That Bird Has My Wings tells the story of the author’s childhood with parents addicted to heroin, an abusive foster family, a life of crime and imprisonment, and the eventual embracing of Buddhism. Masters’s story drew the attention of luminaries in the world of American Buddhism, including Pema Chodron, who wrote a story about him for O Magazine and offers a foreword to the book.\n\nThirty-two years after his conviction, Masters is still on Death Row. A growing movement of people believe Masters is innocent, and are actively working within the legal system to free him.\n\nThis program is read by the author.\n\nFrom the host of the fabulous and popular show Bevelations on SiriusXM’s Radio Andy channel, Bevy Smith’s irreverent and inspiring memoir about learning to live a big, authentic, and unapologetic life–and how you can, too.\n\nBevy Smith was living what seemed like a glamorous dream as a fashion advertising executive, blazing a lucrative career for herself in the whitewashed magazine world. She jetsetted to Europe for fashion shows, dined and danced at every hot spot, and enjoyed a mighty roster of lovers.\n\nSo it came as quite a shock to Bevy when one day, after arriving at her luxury hotel in Milan, she collapsed on the Frette bedsheets and sobbed. Years of rolling with the in-crowd had taken its toll. Her satisfaction with work and life had hit rock bottom. But Bevy could not be defeated, and within minutes (okay, days) she grabbed a notepad and started realizing a truer path–one built on self-reflection and, ultimately, clarity. She figured out how to redirect her life toward meaningful creativity and freedom.\n\nIn her signature lively and infectious voice (there’s no one like Bevy!), Bevelations candidly shares how she reclaimed her life’s course and shows how we too can manifest our most bodacious dreams. From repossessing her bold childhood nature to becoming her own brand to envisioning her life’s next great destination (which will feature natural hair, important charitable giving, and a midcentury house overlooking the Pacific Ocean), Bevy invites listeners along on the route of her personal transformation to reveal how each of us can live our best lives with honesty, joy, and, when we’re in the mood, a killer pair of shoes.\n\nA Macmillan Audio production from Andy Cohen Books\n\n“Bevy knows what’s what, and she is the kind of woman you want in your corner.

Now she shares those strategies with people who are on their own journeys toward mental wholeness–and who want to discover how to be free to live an abundant life.\n\nIn this sixty-day guided journal, Williams leads you through the process of identifying the thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that leave you feeling overwhelmed, unfulfilled, and alone. Through her unique blend of tender, sometimes humorous, and often thought-provoking wisdom, Williams shows you how to overcome difficult circumstances and relationships with life-giving honesty and connection, offering\n\npowerful readings about overwhelming emotions and healing from hurt;\n\nkey scriptures that emphasize the importance of checking in with God, themselves, and others;\n\njournaling prompts for personal processing; and\n\nshort prayers to help you lean on God for insight, strength, and courage on their journey toward mental wholeness.\n\n#1 WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER * NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER * USA TODAY BESTSELLER\n\nARE YOU READY TO BELIEVE IN YOU?\n\n“Game-changing.

How to be resolute, do the right thing, persevere, find gratitude, and learn compassion are just some of the lessons in her inspirational life story.” –Ron FOGLEMAN, General (ret.), U.S. Air Force; former Air Force Chief of Staff\n\nCombining the soulful honesty of Make Your Bed with the inspiring power of You Are a Badass, America’s first female combat jet pilot and Arizona Senator Martha McSally shows you how to clear the runway of your life: embrace fear, transform doubt, succeed when you are expected to fail, and soar to great heights in this motivational life guide.\n\nMartha McSally is an extraordinary achiever whose inner strength and personal principles have helped her overcome adversity throughout her life. Initially rejected from Air Force flight school because she was too short, she refused to give up, becoming the first female fighter pilot to fly in combat and the first to command a combat fighter squadron in United States history. During her twenty-six-year military career, she fought to free American servicewomen stationed in the Middle East from restrictions requiring them to don full-body, black abayas and ride in the backs of cars – and won. McSally has continued to serve America, first in the House of Representatives, and now as a U.S. Senator from Arizona.\n\nMcSally is also a survivor. She shares how her experiences propelled her to become a fighter for justice in and out of the cockpit. In this powerful, uplifting book, McSally reflects on her successes and failures, shares key principles that have guided her, and reveals invaluable lessons to break barriers, thrive through darkness, and make someone proud in your life. “Courage isn’t magic or genetics. It is a choice. By choosing to do things afraid, you discover your own power to overcome.”\n\nFilled with fresh stories and insights, Dare to Fly will help each of us find the courage inside to break our barriers, endure turbulence, and keep flying high.\n\nThe founder of Recovery Management Agency–the world’s first agency devoted to helping addicts heal their addictions by reawakening their souls–uses her knowledge of depth psychology and her personal experience as a recovering addict to help you reconnect with soul, find meaning and live your purpose.\n\nOn her fifth anniversary of sobriety, Elisa Hallerman still awoke with a hurting heart. This is not right. I am not happy. Sobriety was supposed to fix her, right? Isn’t that what sobriety is all about?\n\nHallerman quickly realized that though she had freed her addiction to substances, she had not freed her soul. After years of trauma and substance abuse, she had only covered up the wounds, rather than truly healing them from within. Despite her sobriety, her current lifestyle – a top talent agent and partner at WME, representing the best of Hollywood’s elite – was making her sick. While she was no longer clinging to drugs and alcohol, she was still using food, men, work, ego-inflation and other addictive behaviors to push away the pain.\n\nAnd so she quit it all, in an effort to ignite her life and reconnect to her soul.\n\nSince then, Hallerman received a doctorate in Depth Psychology and established the first-ever Recovery Management Agency, one that helps addicts not only recover and their addiction but reawaken their soul connection and live their unique purpose. Leaning on her studies and expertise, Soulbriety brings together Hallerman’s story, philosophy, and methodology encouraging and facilitating us to use our soul as our map, as nourishment, and to create deep meaning in our lives.\n\nSoulbriety is not just about getting sober; it’s about true, soul-centered wellness. It starts when you slow down and grow down, in a way you’ve been yearning for–but probably didn’t quite know how to before. To explore your unconscious root system, plumb the depths of your soul, travel your own individual hero’s journey. Hallerman shows us exactly how to get there with step-by-step solutions and incredibly affecting storytelling. And Hallerman is not alone in this endeavor; she has affected thousands of lives, healed many wounds, and inspired countless others to take charge of their life by taking charge of their soul. As actress Jamie Lee Curtis says in Soulbriety‘s forward, Hallerman is “a crucial voice for these unprecedented times.”\n\nCharlamagne Tha God, New York Times bestselling author of Black Privilege and always provocative cohost of Power 105.1’s The Breakfast Club, reveals his blueprint for breaking free from your fears and anxieties.\n\nFear is holding you back. It’s time to turn the tables and channel your fears to actually fuel your success.\n\nBeing “shook” is more than a rap lyric for Charlamagne, it’s his mission to overcome. While it may seem like he’s ahead of the game, he is actually plagued by anxieties, such as the fear of losing his roots, the fear of being a bad dad, and the fear of being a terrible husband. Shook One chronicles his journey to beat those fears and shows a path that you too can take to overcome the anxieties that may be holding you back.\n\nIronically, Charlamagne’s fear of failure–of falling into the life of stagnation or crime that caught up so many of his friends and family in his hometown of Moncks Corner–has been the fuel that has propelled him to success. However, even after achieving national prominence as a radio personality, Charlamagne still found himself paralyzed by anxiety and distrust. Now, in Shook One, he is working through these problems–many of which he traces back to cultural PTSD–with help from mentors, friends, and therapy. Being anxious doesn’t serve the same purpose anymore. Through therapy, he’s figuring out how to get over the irrational fears that won’t take him anywhere positive.\n\nCharlamange hopes Shook One can be a call to action: Getting help is your right. Therapy and showing weakness are not always easy subjects, but if you go to the gym three or four times a week, why can’t you put that same effort and energy into getting mentally strong?\n\n“I know bad things are still going to happen to me. Struggles that I can’t even conceive of today are still going to trip me up from time to time down the road. Cops are still going to pull me over for no reason. I’m still going to worry about my kids. The anxieties are never fully going to go away. In the past, my focus was always on the things that cause stress. Moving forward, its’ going to be on the things that bless.”\n\nNarrated by Josh Peck\n\nA wonderfully candid memoir from one of the most recognizable faces of a generation, actor, writer, Youtuber, and television superstar, Josh Peck.

However, while he tried to maintain his role as the funniest, happiest kid in every room, Josh struggled alone with the kind of rising anger and plummeting confidence that quietly took over his life.\n\nFor the first time, Josh reflects on his late teens and early twenties. Raised by a single mother, and coming of age under a spotlight that could be both invigorating and cruel, Josh filled the cratering hole in his self-worth with copious amounts of food, television, drugs, and all of the other trappings of young stardom. Until he realized the only person standing in his way…was himself. Today, with a string of lead roles on hit television shows and movies, and one of the most enviable and dedicated fanbases on the internet, Josh Peck is more than happy, he’s finally, enthusiastically content.\n\nHappy People are Annoying is the culmination of years of learning, growing, and finding bright spots in the scary parts of life. Written with the kind of humor, strength of character, and unwavering self-awareness only someone who has mastered their ego can muster, this memoir reminds us of the life-changing freedom on the other side of acceptance.\n\n2010 Audie Award Finalist for Narration by the Author\n\nNow in paperback, the internationally bestselling heartfelt memoir from movie legend Patrick Swayze and his wife of over thirty years, Lisa Niemi, about Patrick‚Äôs remarkable career and brave battle against pancreatic cancer.\n\nAn entertaining and inspiring behind-the-scenes look at a Hollywood life and a remarkable love, told in the words of beloved actor Patrick Swayze and his wife, Lisa Niemi, shortly before he passed away.\n\nIn a career spanning more than thirty years, Patrick Swayze made a name for himself on the stage and screen with his versatility, passion, and fearlessness.

One of seven children to Nigerian immigrant parents, he grew up in the Crenshaw district of South Central Los Angeles during the 1980s and 90s, a time when the neighborhood was fraught with riots and gang violence. With dreams of playing professional basketball, Gbajabiamila found success not in the sport he loved, but in football. Late in his high school career, Gbajabiamila suited up with pads for the first time and was thrown into the complex sport of football. He climbed major hurdles to play college football and then professional football. After playing in the NFL, it was only after years of hard work behind-the-scenes in radio and television that he was offered the job to be the host of American Ninja Warrior.\n\nThrough his own inspirational underdog stories and interviews with modern-day ninjas who have accomplished extraordinary things in their own lives against the odds, Akbar proves in Everyone Can Be a Ninja that it doesn’t matter if you make it through every step of the obstacle course on the first try.

Enduring anti-Semitism in their native land, Val’s parents wanted a better life for their children–a desire that led them to leave everything they knew and start again thousands of miles away in a foreign country. It was a gamble that paid off–after years of practice and discipline, Val, along with his older brother Maks, have reached the pinnacle of success.

She sold her successful outdoor adventure business, upsetting her partner and boyfriend of twelve years and getting them both fired in the process. The emotional waters that would fester and erupt on the ensuing journey were often more challenging to navigate than the mighty river itself. With blistering lips and irradiated fingernails, Darcy would tackle raging Class Five whitewater for twenty-five days straight, barely surviving a dynamite-filled canyon being prepared for a new hydroelectric plant. She and her two companions would encounter illegal loggers, narco-traffickers, murderous Shining Path rebels, and ruthless poachers in the black-market trade in endangered species. They would plead for mercy at the hands of the murderous Ashaninka people who were convinced that they had come to steal their children’s organs.\n\nIn a desperate attempt meant to give her some pretense of control, Darcy even cut off all her hair before entering Peru’s notoriously dangerous “Red Zone” in hopes of passing for a boy and being seen as less of a target. At once a heart-pounding adventure and a celebration of pushing personal limits, Amazon Woman speaks to all of us feeling trapped by our desk-bound, online society. This a story of finding the courage and strength to challenge nature, cultures, social norms, and oneself.\n\nFrom renowned ABC News anchor/correspondent and former insomniac Diane Macedo, comes a practical, user-friendly guide to getting better sleep. The Sleep Fix flips the switch on common advice, illuminating the reporter’s relentless search for how to get a good night’s sleep and the surprising, scientific, and practical solutions she found along the way.\n\nRoughly thirty percent of the population is estimated to be living with insomnia, while many more unknowingly suffer from other sleep disorders. In The Sleep Fix, Macedo aims to change that with perspective-shifting research and easy-to-implement solutions based not just on science and experts, but also her own years-long struggle.\n\nAs an early-morning reporter and overnight news anchor, Macedo learned the hard way how valuable sleep is, and how it affects everything from our heart to our brain to our immune system. The longer Macedo struggled, the more her health deteriorated. Desperate, she tried standard sleep tip after standard sleep tip, but nothing worked – instead, it made her worse.\n\nFinally, after developing a tolerance to sleeping pills, Macedo decided to attack the problem as a journalist, interviewing sleep experts from all over the world to get to the bottom of what really keeps us from sleeping–and the various ways to fix it.\n\nAs Macedo explains, the solution to catching zzz’s isn’t as simple as giving up caffeine, or putting away your phone before bed. With her down-to-earth explanations and humor, she instead teaches us how to:\n\n* Understand sleep biology\n\n* Identify sleep obstacles\n\n* Flag sleep myths and separate fact from fiction\n\n* Try counterintuitive approaches\n\n* Shift our mindset\n\nMost importantly, Macedo — a busy, working mom — teaches us how to adjust and fit these solutions into our everyday lives. Offering expert wisdom, cutting-edge research, intimate sleep stories from public figures, and actionable advice, The Sleep Fix is the tell-it-like-it-is guide this sleep-deprived world has been waiting for.\n\nSupplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook.\n\nAn entertaining book “filled with inspirational anecdotes” (People) about second acts in life and reinventing yourself from beloved television actress Patricia Heaton–Emmy Award-winning star of Everybody Love’s Raymond, The Middle, Patricia Heaton Parties, and most recently, Carol’s Second Act.\n\nPatricia Heaton is one of TV’s most recognizable and beloved moms.\n\nShe’s won three Emmys, two for her starring role as Debra Barone on the long-running comedy Everybody Loves Raymond, and followed that career-making role with another gem as Frances Heck on the popular sitcom The Middle.

But as Rosie reveals, that success came after years of pain.\n\nWhen Rosie was only nineteen, the father of her newborn walked out with no warning. With no college degree, no career, and an addiction to emotional eating, Rosie was overwhelmed. How could she take care of a child when she could barely care for herself? Yet despite her lack of self-confidence, the courageous young woman rose from the ashes–only to fall again . . . and again. The journey included three husbands, three divorces, three children, and years of abuse, infidelity, broken promises, and sleepless nights. Rosie’s life was anything but easy, especially when her weight ballooned to 400 pounds. Yet she never, ever gave up. When one door closed in her face, she picked herself up and knocked on another one. Despite the pain, the rejection, and the disappointment, there were small victories and successes. Each one gave her the strength to keep on going. Eventually, she found the courage to take control of her life, lost 240 pounds, and found the life she’s always wanted.\n\nHers is a story of survival and triumph you will never forget.\n\nFor women who feel trapped, isolated, fat, ugly, invisible, or less than; for the motivated, girl-boss, bad bit*h, champions out there, The Girl with the Self-Esteem Issues unfolds with raw honesty, courage, and hope.\n\nInside every mother is a fierce, resilient, intuitive woman who has the ability to tap into an indomitable mindset and create heroic outcomes–for her children, her family, her community and for herself–she is a Warrior Mom.\n\nIn Warrior Mom, (previously published as Miracle Mindset), celebrity health expert and four-time New York Times bestselling author, JJ Virgin reveals how one life-altering event taught her to trust her instincts, pay attention to the details that matter and defy the odds–and she shares how you can too.\n\nIn 2012, JJ Virgin was in a hospital room next to her sixteen-year-old son who was struck by a hit-and-run driver and left for dead. She was told by doctors that he wouldn’t last through the night and to let him go. With every reason to give up, JJ chose instead to invest her energy into the hope that her son would not just survive, but thrive. In Warrior Mom, she shares the lessons that gave her the courage to overcome the worst moment of her life.\n\nDuring this difficult time, she learned valuable personal lessons that helped her rebuild her life and find success and purpose in herself, her work, and teach her sons and community how to face their own obstacles and trials. Lessons like “Don’t Wish It Were Easier, Make Yourself Stronger” and “Your Limitations Will Become Your Life” will lead you to your own personal power and purpose, even when the deck seems stacked against you.\n\nWith true stories from her life, her clients, and other well-known thought leaders, she can help you transform your mindset and your daily habits to endure the difficult battles that life sends your way. Insightful, personal, and completely relatable, this book proves that miracles are possible when you show up, remain positive, and do the work.\n\nFrom New York Times bestselling author and beloved Today show coanchor Hoda Kotb, an “inspirational page-turner” (Daily News, New York) about people who find their life’s purpose in unexpected ways, often surprising themselves and their loved ones.\n\nAre you where you belong? Many of us wonder. We float around in the half-empty glass, gaze out into the world of possibilities, and wonder if we should get off our raft and climb out. Maybe even today you asked yourself: Is it too late to do that thing that made me so happy when I was young? Could what matters most to me finally be the center of my life? Can I really trust this yearning voice in my head and longing in my heart?\n\nIn Where We Belong, Hoda Kotb explores the challenging journeys of people who found their true calling in life by following their passions, their gut, and their heart. The compelling stories include an investment banker who became a minister after years of working on Wall Street, a young woman from a blue-collar background whose passion took her to Harvard Medical School, a high-powered PR executive who was drawn to a unique close-knit community, and a once “no-kids” guy who now helps children all over the world. Hoda also interviews celebrities, such as producer Mark Burnett and actress/producer Roma Downey, comedienne Margaret Cho, and former boxer Laila Ali, all who’ve pursued their passions to fulfill their dreams. The stories told provide examples of perseverance, self-reflection, and new attitudes on life making Where We Belong a motivating guide to finding the right path for your personal journey.\n\nFinding Sarah is an extraordinarily personal memoir by Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York. As she spends time with Dr. Phil McGraw, she gains a new understanding of her relationship with herself and with others. Suze Orman helps Sarah unravel the poisonous money issues she suffers from. Martha Beck teaches her how let go of her negative self-image. Many other friends and experts populate these pages, and you will meet them all.\n\nSarah’s journey is, in so many ways, everyone’s journey, and as she shares her story, she also shares the advice and wisdom she benefited from along the way.

On every page of this book you will hear from Sarah’s friends and guides, her “real-life angels,” as they help her get to the root of her problems–from comfort eating to self-loathing, from reckless overspending to notorious mishaps. You will learn from them, as she did. In this way, Sarah hopes not only to talk to you as a friend but to inspire you, through her own experiences, to look closely at your own life and where you wish to improve it, then to encourage you to follow your instincts and find your true path. Sarah Ferguson did, and so can you.\n\nHere’s the Bright Side is a wise, moving, and funny book about what people gain from situations of loss. Using examples from her own life and from other people’s lives, Rollin inspires readers with stories that illustrate the value that can come from the hardest times in our lives and how the worst can lead to the best, resulting in happier, more powerful, richer ways of living.\n\nRollin writes both of lessons learned and happiness gained: about men, friends, power, and more. Rollin tells us about fair- and foul-weather friends, the usefulness of fear, the positive outcomes of failure, divorce, and widowhood and her own evolving joy as a cancer survivor.\n\nPoignant, timely, and universal, Here’s the Bright Side is a unique and inspirational view of how life is often enriched by loss and how people find surprising light in darkness."
