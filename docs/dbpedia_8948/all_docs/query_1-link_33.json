Wherever you were, it’s obvious that the world looks a whole lot different than it did back then. Soon after the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic, STYLECASTER embarked on a project to ask dozens of celebrities and public figures—from actors and influencers to supermodels and reality stars—what their lives look like in these unprecedented times. We’ve compiled their responses into Snapshots From Quarantine, a collection of original self-portraits and accompanying stories from these stars about how they’re dealing with social distancing, what they miss most about normal life and the first thing they’ll do once it’s safe to go outside again. Some have used this time to virtually connect with friends and loved ones. Others have taken the opportunity to pick up new hobbies, or catch up on TV shows they’ve been meaning to watch. And, much like the rest of us, they’re doing what they can to remain healthy, sane and hopeful that brighter days are ahead. As of May 13, 2020, there have been more than four million reported cases of COVID-19, and a quarter of a million deaths worldwide. A staggering percentage of both have occurred in the United States. Through this project, our goal is to offer an unfiltered view into how a wide range of people we admire are coping. We are deeply cognizant of the seriousness of this global crisis, and urge those who can to donate to organizations that help healthcare and essential workers, and those most in need of aid. With that said, we present Snapshots From Quarantine. Click through to see exclusive photos and hear from stars like Hannah Bronfman, Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt, Lea Michele, Jordyn Woods and many others—in their own words. Want to share your own quarantine story with us?

We cook together, we clean together and we play together. I’ve never had this much time to spend with my family so I’m taking advantage and learning so many other things. The most important thing is enjoying my family and taking care of my son. My life changed a lot. As a model I travel so much and now we have to stay at home. Also, this is the first time in the 10 years of my career that I was forced to stop working so I miss work. I’ve grown up in a family of teachers, my mom, grandma and aunties are all teachers, so I’ve always known how hard it can be and the patience they have. I miss the ability to move around freely. I’m excited to hug my family and friends when life returns to normal.\n\n\"My son is homeschooling through FaceTime and I just wanted to put out there how much respect I have for teachers.\"\n\nLais Ribeiro\n\nModel\n\nI am extremely grateful and fortunate to say that I don’t feel like my life has changed too much or been negatively affected by this pandemic, relatively speaking. I think almost everyone, in their own unique situation at this time, is experiencing anxiety and fear for different reasons. There are some things I have been doing to cope with the anxiety that I myself have been feeling. I have been focusing a lot on my mental, physical and spiritual health by having a consistent routine. I wake up in the morning, do an hour of meditation/yoga/breathing exercises and then try to do a fitness workout before starting the rest of my day. I try to make it a point to take a 20-30 minute walk outside in my neighborhood every day and feel the sun on my skin and breathe in fresh air. Listening to uplifting music throughout the day also helps me to stay positive. To stay creative, I have been reading, journaling, attending acting workshops/seminars on Zoom, dancing around my apartment, trying new recipes and watching inspirational interviews/Q&A’s with people I look up to. I miss being able to see my family/friends, sitting at cafés/restaurants and going to dance classes and fitness studios. I hope we will all come out of this more empathetic, aware and appreciative of everything we missed. I think the first thing I’ll do when the quarantine lifts is go with my husband to the beach, soak in the sun and thank nature for reminding me to never take anything or anyone for granted.\n\nRicha Moorjani\n\nactress on Netflix’s Never Have I Ever\n\nI think what we’re going through right now is absolutely horrific, but I have found that I’m connecting with friends more than I maybe ever have. We spend so much time with very brief text messages that really don’t have a lot of depth, and I think being where we are right now is such an opportunity for us to connect on a deeper level by speaking over the phone, which I don’t think people have done in a very long time. Now, these conversations aren’t just gossiping or sort of surface level. It’s, ‘How’s your family? How are you feeling? How are your emotions? How’s your stress?’ The most important thing for us as a family, my mom included, was that we came up with a really good schedule. We’ve never really felt super on top of each other because we make sure that everyone has their own individual space. I could definitely find myself being someone to get very sad by all of this. And it’s very anxiety-provoking, but we’ve really supported one another and made sure that we’ve kept our spirits lifted as much as possible.\n\nLea Michele\n\nActress and Singer\n\nThis week, I definitely feel like I’m more settled into a routine. For me, establishing a new routine is really important, as well as making goals, checking in with people and being kind to myself and my expectations for what this time will look like. I try to move everyday. I try to feel active, whether that’s an Instagram workout video, which I actually enjoy, because you can see how many people are participating, so there’s some sort of communal energy. It makes me giggle because I think of all of us doing awkward squats or dancing around in our living rooms, trying to stay sane together. That’s been a joy for me. I talk to my grandparents a lot more often. Thankfully, they both know how to FaceTime, so I look forward to that every week. It’s really overwhelming and it’s really heartbreaking, especially as I hear from more and more friends about how their parents are sick. It’s really sobering. It’s weird. You have free time, you want to lounge and you want to drink a ton of wine, but then at the same time, I guess I should be productive. Just taking it day by day. Checking in with yourself. Checking in with the people around you. Counting your blessings. I hope we can all come out of this more aware of each other. All of this shows how broken our healthcare system is and the discrepancy of how many people have money and those who don’t. You have to stay positive, but I also think it’s important to look at the way we’re failing certain people.\n\nAnnaSophia Robb\n\nactress on Hulu’s Little Fires Everywhere\n\nThis is a strange time for everyone right now, and I am just trying to do my part by staying in my house and following social distancing rules. I've been in my house for a month now with my sister and pets. We've been extra cautious as my mom has an immunity issue and she spends quite a lot of time here. I've been able to see my brother a couple of times and he's been quarantined even longer. To pass time, I've been writing and preparing a few shows that will go into development once we return to normal and safer times. We've been doing DIY projects, yoga, cooking, watching every show we can find and organizing the house. We might start some gardening too. I'm having \"date\" night with my boyfriend, Ben, through FaceTime. We have dinner and binge shows together. We are sharing our work via FaceTime as well, he's writing music and serenades me...I read him scripts I'm working on. It's challenging but you know....as they say, we are all in this together. I feel blessed that my family and friends have remained healthy; that's most important to me right now. Sure, being stuck at the house isn't fun but it's a small price to pay to keep others healthy. I mean look at all the essential workers...risking their health and those close to them so that they can take care of us. Heroes! What can I complain about? I'm looking forward to life returning to normal and wonder what that'll look like. I can't wait to see Ben, go to a movie and return to work. It'll just be nice to have the rest of the family and my friends over for dinner and give them a hug!\n\nBella Thorne\n\nActress and Singer\n\nW\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\nby Jason Pham\n\nb r a d m o n d o\n\nj u r n e e s m o l l e t t\n\nd i a n e g u e r r e r o\n\nbobby berk\n\njonathan daviss\n\nadrienne bailon-houghton\n\nalyson stoner\n\nI’m quarantining at home with my hubby and pup! This time has been extremely bizarre, albeit eye-opening. I’m really realizing how minuscule things I thought I needed before are now. I miss human interaction and being able to go in and out as I please, even to Starbucks! However, after this is over I think I will have a new outlook on life and a whole lot of gratitude!\n\nmodel\n\nHunter McGrady\n\nRight now is an extremely trying time in the world. There isn't a single individual who isn't affected in some way by this pandemic. I, and many of my friends, have lost the ability to connect with each other in person. I miss going to the gym and playing basketball, but I'm substituting with 2K and home workouts. I miss going to the movies, so instead I binge everything from home with my family. I miss going to concerts, but it’s forced me to dive into creating my own music and discover artists I wouldn’t normally listen to. These are hard times for all of us, but necessity is the mother of invention. It’s amazing to see people find new and creative ways to do all the things that once required us to be together, from home.\n\nactor on Netflix’s Outer Banks\n\nJonathan Daviss\n\nUnexpected and extreme scenarios magnify whatever is already inside—our defense mechanisms, relational instincts, our tendency to shrink or expand in conflict and how accountable we hold ourselves to contributing to society. In addition to leading my online community through weekly mental health check-ins, mindfulness exercises and movement courses, I’m getting involved with various cities and organizations to support kids and families who are facing a shortage of resources. Personally, I’m sticking to a daily regimen of exercise, meditation and fresh cooking to maintain normalcy, and reading Bodyfulness by Christine Caldwell and Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler. Sidenote: I’m delightfully ignoring my tweezers and razor and roots...maybe indefinitely?\n\n\"I’m delightfully ignoring my tweezers and razor and roots...maybe indefinitely?\"\n\nmultihyphenate artist and host of “Simplexity”\n\nAlyson Stoner\n\nI cannot think of a time where we have been forced to slow down, forced to think and forced to be comfortable in the uncomfortable without knowing when it will end. For myself, finding and sticking to a consistent routine has been so important to my productivity. Knowing that I have a constant with my routine, while everything else around me is changing and evolving, has helped me stay grounded and positive through all of this. My day to day has shifted but that doesn't mean it has slowed down. I have a business to run, partnerships to launch and a team to carry, all while being in the confines of a space that isn't mine. I am quarantining in Austin (as we have currently paused on the production of the next season of Queer Eye), and I am so grateful to have [my husband] Dewey and a couple of friends with me. I've been very fortunate to have the company and a safe place to quarantine in amongst the isolation but coming back home to L.A. and being in my own space will be a nice exhale. My bed, my friends and my team will be so much more of an appreciation now that we've been restricted of human contact and comfort. This unprecedented situation has allowed me and everyone to truly reflect, push pause and focus on each other. The world is slowing down and regenerating, people are looking out for each other, and people are focused on the larger picture, which is something I am focusing on to stay positive and happy.\n\ndesign expert on Netflix’s Queer Eye\n\nBobby Burke\n\nThe most important thing to me right now is staying healthy and keeping my immunity up. I’ve been really focused on what I consume, what I let into my spirit, what I eat and drink, and balancing what I watch and read. I’ve been listening to guided meditations and I love listening to worship music. Finding a great playlist that makes you feel at peace and finding shows that allow you to escape is awesome. I’ve been watching things that are simple, fun and not too deep like Curb Your Enthusiasm and Golden Girls. I think the biggest change, for most people, is the loss of work or adapting to work from our homes. It’s changed how we produce The Real and how I produce content for All Things Adrienne. We started taping The Real from home—so there will be all new episodes of The Real, LIVE from the quarantine, from our homes, shot by us. I’m really excited to be able to be back with the girls again and hope we can be a light for our audience at home, just an hour escape from boredom or stress, for girlfriend time.\n\ncohost on The Real\n\nAdrienne Bailon\n\nThis unprecedented situation has allowed me and everyone to truly reflect, push pause and focus on each other.\n\nIf I had a dog, he would hate me by now.

Since all production has stopped, my two current projects are being postponed. I am spending time hiking, binge-watching Schitt's Creek with my mom and dad, reading (I just finished re-reading an Alex Rider book, which is a series I've always enjoyed) and have been doing a little bit of driving for a local grocery delivery service. I recently got two new video games and actually played remotely with Gavin, who plays Moody from Little Fires Everywhere! I've also been participating in an online Bible study called \"Finding Peace.” We had to cancel our family vacation, so when the world returns to normal, that is definitely a high priority! But most of all, I look forward to getting back to work. We only have two weeks left on production for Panic with Amazon Studios, and then this summer, I am scheduled to start filming Superman and Lois for The CW.\n\nactor on Hulu’s Little Fires Everywhere\n\nJordan Elsass\n\nMy main priority while we are all social distancing has been staying positive and trying to stick to some sort of a schedule. I have been spending a lot of time on the couch playing Animal Crossing and binge-watching old movies to pass the time. But on a more productive note, shortly before the stay at home orders went into effect, I moved, so I finished all my unpacking and have been continuing to upload vlogs on my YouTube channel and remotely record my weekly podcast “Pretty Basic.” Squeezing in some at-home workouts and staying active is helping keep my immune system up and my mental health in check. When we get past all of this, I think I am most excited to reunite with my family and friends and give everyone a big hug. We will get through this, but until then, everyone please stay home and stay safe.\n\ndigital creator and cohost of “Pretty Basic”\n\nRemi Cruz\n\nDuring quarantine, I've been trying to stay as creative and active as possible. I've been meditating and working out a lot. I'm currently trying to reteach myself how to do the splits and a handstand! I've also been focusing on finishing writing a script I've been working on and writing songs! I miss hanging out with my friends, going to restaurants (lol), and also acting (being on set and going to auditions). I'm most excited to hug all my friends when all of this is done. We're planning on doing a self-care day once all of this is done which I'm definitely looking forward to! My biggest wish is for people to stay safe and inside. The more time spent inside during this time, the less time this pandemic will last.\n\nactress on Hulu’s Little Fires Everywhere\n\nLexi Underwood\n\nQ.U.A.R.A.N.T.I.N.E. Questioning everything I’ve done since the day I was born. Unpacked my luggage from my February cruise trip, finally. Alcohol seems to be the answer. Really need to wash my hair, but…I don’t want to? Always waking up at noon. Never cooked a day in my life, but suddenly I’m frying a whole fish. TikTok dance challenges are a religion. Insomnia is my middle name.\n\nactress on Freeform’s Good Trouble\n\nSherry Cola\n\nI’ve been playing a lot of Sims, watching more movies, doing more cooking, FaceTiming my family and friends more, creating more, and learning the value of slowing down in a fast-paced world. It’s forced me to focus on what I have instead of what I don’t, and that’s been very freeing!\n\nsinger\n\nNIKI\n\n“I try and take it day by day. Things are so touch and go for all of us right now; it’s important for us to stay informed, remind each other to stay present and make decisions as each day evolves. We’re all taking on new responsibilities and we make an effort to communicate with kindness and support of strategy to keep the household running in this time of unknown. We are practicing social distance, which is challenging at times, but it’s offered the gift of being with our children. Time moves so quickly and we remind each other to take the good moments as a gift. I miss going to bookstores with our children, taking them to museums, the park. And I’ve always considered myself a clean person, but I’ve never had bleeding knuckles before from washing my hands. When things resume to normal, I can’t wait to Impulsively make plans…outside.\n\nactress and author of You and I, as Mothers: A Raw and Honest Guide to Motherhood\n\nLaura Prepon\n\nSeeking the wisdom that’s to be found in all this uncertainty. Meditating, praying, breathing, journaling and being kind to myself in this time. Listening to what my body is telling me...If it tells me to go for a run, try a new handstand, read a book, eat chocolate while sitting with my tears, dance till I’m dizzy or write till my fingers feel numb...That’s what I do.\n\nactress on HBO’s Lovecraft County\n\nJurnee Smollett\n\nDuring this quarantine, I’m trying to be gentle with myself. At the start, I wasn’t feeling motivated. I felt lost and sad, and found myself feeling guilty for feeling that way. Then I realized THAT’S OK! When I gave myself permission to be human, that’s when I started to become more motivated and creative! I started running again for the first time in years, cooking and learning new recipes, writing music, and I’ve been doing an Instagram Live series on my page called “Hold The Phone with Katie Stevens!” where I interview friends with all different job descriptions, stories and skills! It’s been a wonderful way for me to feel connected and have something to look forward to every day. I’m trying to enjoy this time with my husband in our home, to slow down and realize what matters to me. I can say, I’m most excited to hug my family and friends when this is all over! If anyone out there is struggling, you are not alone and you will feel connected and motivated again. Be patient! You got this!\n\nactress on Freeform’s The Bold Type\n\nKatie Stevens\n\nI always knew I was lucky and blessed before this, but this moment in our history has really opened my eyes to see how blessed I truly am. Knowing how many are struggling out there has really pushed me to help as much as I can. Being in the privileged position to donate to my local food banks, rent reliefs and organizations like A Meal to Heal really keeps me sane knowing that I can help those incredible people out there who are literally saving lives every day and feels like the very least I can do.\n\nactress on Netflix’s On My Block\n\nJessica Marie Garcia\n\nHappy Social Distancing from Los Angeles! What a crazy time this has been! I tend to be a stubbornly optimistic individual, so I have spent this quarantine trying to look on the bright side and find the silver linings. It’s not always easy—if there’s anything I’ve learned about myself during this time, it’s that I need sunshine and socialization to feel normal—neither of which we’ve had during this time (who knew it could rain so much in L.A.) However, I’ve made the most of the bright spots literally and figuratively. I’ve been working out, sitting in the sunshine and catching up with friends and family via FaceTime. For someone who is never home, it’s also been nice to have an opportunity to be back and hack away at those little to-do list items that tend to pile up around the house. I had to laugh, though, since I was so excited to visit my friends and catch up with everyone while back home—however no one can get together with the outbreak. I’m so thankful we live in a period of time where we have technology that will keep us in touch even when we have to stay apart. I am quarantining on my own so being able to reconnect with folks virtually has been my saving grace during this time and such a huge help in dealing with the emotional ups and downs that come with this strange way of living. Just like everyone else, my life has changed drastically—as someone who travels at least once every 10 days, it’s been odd being in one place and not interacting with humans. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve woken up in the middle of the night worried that I need to pack for something but I can’t remember for what—which just ended with me laughing at myself and going back to sleep. We need to keep our senses of humor to keep our sanity. I think the biggest takeaway we can all glean from this is that it’s been a beautiful way to come together as a community while the world heals itself. To reconnect on a human level in a world that lately has been so divided has been a gift. The creativity, the humanitarianism, the memes and the innovation are all representations of the human spirit that persists despite what hardships we go through. As someone who comes from a family of health and medical professionals, my heart goes out to everyone who works in the healthcare industry who is tirelessly exerting themselves to heal the humanity, the world and solve this problem. So much respect also goes out to all of the frontline workers who keep our world running while we ride this out. And I send my love to all as we struggle to make sense of what is happening while keeping our wits about us. Together, we will get through this. And when it’s all over, I’m going to gather my friends and hug them all tight, go on a long hike in the fresh air, and then head straight for a giant feast at my favorite Mexican restaurant. Once those boxes are checked, I'm headed to the airport and escape to some adventure destination—don't worry, I'll send you a postcard ;) Until then, I will continue to self-care and dream of the day when the world finally heals and life returns to normal. Xx\n\nactress on The CW’s Arrow\n\nKat McNamara\n\nIt’s obviously an interesting season that we are all living in right now. What remains at the forefront of my mind is that as a species, we humans are built to adapt and acclimate and survive and I think where society is concerned, we are actually doing that pretty well. There are a couple of other really important things that I keep in the forefront of my mind. Like the way that the Earth is able to take a deep breath at this moment. This is something that is really beautiful to me since I haven’t seen L.A. this green, with the air this clear, probably since I have lived here, which has been a very long time. I also think about the fact that when all of the lights turn back on and everybody’s functioning quote-unquote “business as usual,” I get excited to think about the reinvigorated kind of energy that everybody will have. For Dear Evan Hansen and the rest of the Broadway community, we’re all having to deal with and cope in different ways, but I think something that we’re all really excited about is just the energy that every theater will see and feel and experience when all of the shows get an opening night again. I mean, even the ones that have been on Broadway for years and years, decades even, it’s exciting to think about. But in the meantime, here in L.A., I’m laying low. I’m very fortunate to be able to stay busy. I stream daily on Twitch from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. PT. Other than that, I am writing music, hanging out with my fiancé and catching up on TV and films. It’s some downtime that we are all forced to take right now in the name of safety. So, we’re all doing the best we possibly can and ultimately, I’m OK and I’m happy.\n\nactor on Broadway’s Dear Evan Hansen and Netflix’s To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You\n\nJordan Fisher\n\nThese days I'm learning the art of saying and doing LESS. And for me, that's doing a lot! I've never been as present as today. I find myself reflecting back to the good times with family and friends, and digging into memorabilia to cherish the moments \"I made time.” When I get out of this quarantine, I want to continue this mindfulness. I don’t want to resume a crazy life, I want to take a bit of this lesson the quarantine taught me to live in the moment and appreciate EVERYTHING. Even fresh air.\n\ncohost on The Real\n\nJeannie Mai\n\nStrangely, my day-to-day life hasn’t changed all that much with the quarantine. I have had long stretches of time between jobs and have developed a way to sustain my creative energy whether I am filming or not—thankfully it has translated well with the stay-at-home orders. I love to make all kinds of things. I bake, I make pottery, I illustrate, I knit. I have been sewing all of my own clothes now for about five years and making many of my own shoes. I’ve built furniture for our home, reupholstered armchairs and foot stools. Keeping my hands busy was a way to occupy my mind when I was a little kid because I spent a lot of time home alone. I'm also an introvert, so I’ve always felt most energized being by myself. My mental state however is a whole other story. I am exhausted from worrying about everyone’s health and terrified of the devastating impact this will continue to have on communities of color and working class families. I have never felt so powerless. Or so privileged. I have a good support system, and I am a strong part of other people’s support systems, so that feels good. I miss the regularity of my moods, I miss the myth of thinking everyone is safe...and I miss getting dressed up and going out! And impromptu coffee dates! And auditions! The thing I am looking forward to most is the institutional change that must and will take place after we begin to recover from the pandemic. It’s hard, but I remain optimistic.\n\nactress on ABC’s The Good Doctor\n\nJasika Nicole\n\nIt’s 2:04 p.m. as I type this, and I basically just woke up. That’s the short version of how my quarantine is going. My sleep schedule has completely shifted, so if I go to bed before 6 a.m. I consider that a win. I’ve been watching all the reality TV, baking, and I’ve spent more time on FaceTime than I think I have in the entire rest of my life. I’ve been working out pretty much every day, but not in the annoying “’let’s not gain weight during the lockdown!” way, but in the “if I don’t get these endorphins in me, I don’t want to know what’s going to happen” way. (Seriously, we’re going through a global pandemic. It’s a traumatic event. Gaining a couple pounds during this time is not a big deal, promise.) Walks are basically my lifeline. If I had a dog, he would hate me by now. My cat does hate me now, so there’s that. I’ve actually yet to organize anything, but that’s the plan for this next month. I miss brunch and coffee dates more than I can explain. I miss hugs and kisses and handholding, and if my friends thought I was clingy before, they’re really in for a treat after this thing is over. I miss my job. Like, a lot a lot. It’s been hard for me to stay creative and tap into characters, so I’m excited to go back to a character I’ve known for so long she’s basically become a part of me. I really miss being able to head to the beach or go on a hike. I even kind of miss my insanely long commutes to work...kind of. Anyway, when all of this is over you can find me attached at the hip to my loved ones at all the brunches and finishing up the fourth season of One Day at a Time! It’s going to be glorious!\n\nactress on Pop’s One Day at a Time\n\nIsabella Gomez\n\nI’m getting used to partying by myself, but it’s really not that bad. You can have some pretty great conversations with yourself after a few tequila beverages. I miss touring and performing for people, especially since I just released my debut album, Lady Like, but I’m excited to get back out on the road once everything is safe. If anything, I enjoy the down time and the fact that I can wear the same outfit everyday and no one cares.\n\nsinger\n\nIngrid Andress\n\nDuring quarantine, I’m spending a lot of time baking lots of treats, continuous dates with my goofball of a boyfriend, trying on dresses in my closet and organizing my perfume.\n\ndigital creator and singer\n\nGabi DeMartino\n\nHey, hi outside world! Chase here. Honestly I’m sort of a homebody to begin with so I’ve been doing literally what I normally do. Definitely getting a little cabin fever with not being able to get my normal workouts in, but making do with finding new ways to get a sweat. Thanks, YouTube. Since the lockdown, I’ve been watching a ton of New Girl (Nick Miller from the streets of Chicago), and just like the rest of the world, I am equally obsessed with Joe Exotic and Tiger King. I recently got into meditation, which has helped slow my mind and control the anxiety that comes with being stuck at home. Also me and a few of the gang from OBX decided to hunker down together and turn the living room into a giant tent, so that’s been quite fun. On a serious note. It’s a beautiful thing to see our community during a time as insane as this come together and stick with the initiative of staying indoors. Also not just taking care of ourselves, but each other and trying to kick this virus in the ass. Let’s keep on keeping on, stay positive, stay in tune with yourself and keep working together for the future!\n\nactor on Netflix’s Outer Banks\n\nChase Stokes\n\nThis time spent at home and in quarantine has reminded me how grateful I am every day for my health, family (pups included) and close friends. It has been an opportunity to pivot in a book tour and get creative about connecting with people online about their forgiveness journey. I am so beyond grateful for everyone in the medical field and first responders for going to work every day and risking their safety and wellbeing to keep us all safe. I know this has been an incredibly challenging and unpredictable time for so many, and I hope we can continue to support one another as we navigate this new world together. I can’t wait for this to be over, to continue to applaud all those who have taken charge and guided us through this unrealistic time, and to hug loved ones again.\n\nauthor of The Gift of Forgiveness\n\nKatherine Schwarzenegger Pratt\n\nAs artists, we must stay creative! We are either expanding or contracting. It’s been a conscious effort to turn the uncertainty and fear around into seeing this time as a blessing. Meditation has helped quiet my mind. I don’t believe we will ever have this slower pace of time, so I am actually embracing and enjoying it, fortunately with my family. It’s nice not to feel pressure when it comes to time...so there has been a lot of reflection, breathing, and collectively I think everyone is focusing on health and self care. For me, it’s mental, physical and spiritual. I have moments when I feel the anxiety creeping in and then I remember we are all in this thing together...\n\nsinger and member of The Pussycat Dolls\n\nCarmit Bachar\n\nDuring quarantine, I appreciate the simple things in life more than ever. Before this, I was always on the go, but now that we’re forced to slow down, I’ve done my best to keep a positive outlook and a happy spirit. I have my ups and my downs, but I’ve realized that I am fully capable of being happy just being home with my husband. I’m listening to music and dancing like I would when I was growing up, which has been an amazing way to decompress. I’ve also been praying a lot more for our healthcare workers and our world. I definitely miss the in-person human connection. As a Latina, it’s in my blood to always want to show love through physical touch! I’m blessed to have my husband with me during this time, but I can’t wait to hug my full family when this is over.\n\nfashion designer, entrepreneur and founder of Camila Coehlo Collection\n\nCamila Coelho\n\nHi, everybody! I hope that you all are staying safe and healthy during this time. What I’m doing to cope during this time is a lot of baking, a lot of cooking, talking on the phone a lot, watching movies and cuddling with my cats, which has been really nice. And sleep! That has been an added bonus. What I miss the most about normal life is of course performing, being on tour. I was on tour and then I had to postpone due to COVID sadly. I miss that. And I miss hugs a lot. I’m a hugger, y’all. I’m from Texas, and I’m a hugger. And I really, really, really miss giving hugs. What I’m excited to do when life returns to normal would be, of course, I can’t wait to go and fly to San Antonio, Texas, and see my family. I miss them terribly. Of course, I cannot wait to go back out on tour. It’s going to be awesome when that day comes. Love you, guys. Sending you so much love.\n\nsinger\n\nAlly Brooke\n\nI have my moments of anxiety, but overall I am handling it well. My heart bleeds every time I think of those who don’t have the option to stay home, and families and businesses that are greatly struggling. I find comfort in the fact that everyone is taking this pandemic seriously and taking all the necessary measures to keep one another safe while also trying to stay connected and positive, even towards complete strangers. I have had to find new ways to collaborate with brands and photographers, for example FaceTime photo shoots. I miss my friends; work allowed me to see them on nearly a daily basis. I really miss being on set. I really enjoy the company of every person I work with. It’s always incredibly fun on set. So it’s not about the work really; it’s about the people I work with.\n\nmodel\n\nGrace Elizabeth\n\nI’m doing well! Keeping my routine and getting ready just a little bit everyday has kept me the most sane while we are all quarantined. I have also continued to vlog for my YouTube channel and remotely record my podcast “Pretty Basic” with Remi Cruz, so that helps keep a small piece or normalcy in my life. I miss my friends and family the most. Once we are finally through this, I can’t wait to do things that I’d take for granted like a simple hug.\n\n\"I miss my friends and family the most.\"\n\ndigital creator and cohost of “Pretty Basic”\n\nAlisha Marie\n\nTo say quarantine has been an odd time is an understatement, but I have actually been taking this opportunity to really appreciate slowing down. I have been traveling a lot for the last three years, and between various home and office moves, I haven't really been in one place for an extended period of time. We began quarantining with four friends not knowing how long we'd be together, and having six of us in one house together to cook, hang out, nest, do housework and other projects has felt like a real treat. It feels like we're back in college (but we're the only ones there! ;) ). It's hard to reconcile the calmness I feel with the immense sadness and worry that comes with these circumstances, but I'm doing my best to take it one day at a time and remember that it is out of my control. All I can do is be a responsible citizen and neighbor by staying home, so that's what I'm doing. And when I get restless, I put on a dress and have a dance party, because...why the hell not?!\n\nDJ, entrepreneur and founder of HBFit\n\nHannah Bronfman\n\nAs a hairdresser and entrepreneur during these times, I’ve been dreaming about the day I get to touch hair again and see my XMONDO Hair family. Since I can’t leave the house, I’ve taken the time to master new photography skills and learn every TikTok dance possible so I can compete with the 15-year-olds on the app.\n\n\"I’ve been dreaming about the day I get to touch hair again and see my XMONDO Hair family\"\n\nprofessional hairstylist and CEO of XMONDO Hair\n\nBrad Mondo\n\nBeing in quarantine has been an adjustment to say the least. I used to think I wanted more alone time but that was because so much of my time was spent being around others and socializing. Now that I have all the alone time in the world, I've realized how much being around others energizes me. It's been a life-saver having FaceTime and Zoom to connect and hang out with my friends and family. I will say though that having all this time at home has been a nice change of pace. It's really allowed me to get into a routine and do things I felt I didn't have the time for like practicing my French, playing piano or drawing. I really do miss a good brunch and going to the movies. I love hosting, so when we're able to, I'm so excited to invite people over and have a game night. I can't wait.\n\nactress in Amazon’s Upload\n\nAndy Allo\n\nI miss everyone so much! Hope you’re all staying safe. I know it can be hard to stay positive, but I’ve been trying to keep busy doing some of the things I love most like cooking my favorite recipes and watching way too much TV! I’ve also been hard at work putting the finishing touches on some new music, so I can share with you all very soon! In the meantime, hope you’re loving “Kings & Queens”! Sending so much love to everyone and can’t wait to be together again soon!\n\nsinger\n\nAva Max\n\nj o r d y n w o o d s\n\nj o r d y n w o o d s\n\ncarmit bachar\n\ningrid andress\n\nkat mcnamara\n\njordan fisher\n\njessica marie garcia\n\nkatie stevens\n\nniki\n\njordan elsass\n\nremi cruz\n\nhannah bronfman\n\nlaura prepon\n\nannie leblanc\n\nDuring quarantine, I’ve been trying to experience new things that I haven’t had the time to try before, such as drawing and cooking. My life has changed drastically, as I was so used to going out every day—whether it was for work or seeing friends. I definitely won't take that for granted again. What I miss the most is going out to eat or just being social with friends. When life gets back to normal, I’m most excited about late nights with friends, filming my new show, Side Hustle, and traveling.\n\nActress and Singer\n\nAnnie LeBlanc\n\nI am a really social person who likes to stay active, so this shelter-in place directive is not easy! Since all production has stopped, my two current projects are being postponed. I am spending time hiking, binge-watching Schitt's Creek with my mom and dad, reading (I just finished re-reading an Alex Rider book, which is a series I've always enjoyed) and have been doing a little bit of driving for a local grocery delivery service. I recently got two new video games and actually played remotely with Gavin, who plays Moody from Little Fires Everywhere! I've also been participating in an online Bible study called \"Finding Peace.” We had to cancel our family vacation, so when the world returns to normal, that is definitely a high priority! But most of all, I look forward to getting back to work. We only have two weeks left on production for Panic with Amazon Studios, and then this summer, I am scheduled to start filming Superman and Lois for The CW.\n\nActor on Hulu’s Little Fires Everywhere\n\nJordan Elsass\n\nMy main priority while we are all social distancing has been staying positive and trying to stick to some sort of a schedule. I have been spending a lot of time on the couch playing Animal Crossing and binge-watching old movies to pass the time. But on a more productive note, shortly before the stay at home orders went into effect, I moved, so I finished all my unpacking and have been continuing to upload vlogs on my YouTube channel and remotely record my weekly podcast Pretty Basic. Squeezing in some at-home workouts and staying active is helping keep my immune system up and my mental health in check. When we get past all of this, I think I am most excited to reunite with my family and friends and give everyone a big hug. We will get through this, but until then, everyone please stay home and stay safe.\n\nDigital Creator and Cohost of Pretty Basic\n\nRemi Cruz\n\nDuring quarantine, I've been trying to stay as creative and active as possible. I've been meditating and working out a lot. I'm currently trying to reteach myself how to do the splits and a handstand! I've also been focusing on finishing writing a script I've been working on and writing songs! I miss hanging out with my friends, going to restaurants (lol), and also acting (being on set and going to auditions). I'm most excited to hug all my friends when all of this is done. We're planning on doing a self-care day once all of this is done which I'm definitely looking forward to! My biggest wish is for people to stay safe and inside. The more time spent inside during this time, the less time this pandemic will last.\n\nActress on Hulu’s Little Fires Everywhere\n\nLexi Underwood\n\nQ.U.A.R.A.N.T.I.N.E. Questioning everything I’ve done since the day I was born. Unpacked my luggage from my February cruise trip, finally. Alcohol seems to be the answer. Really need to wash my hair, but…I don’t want to? Always waking up at noon. Never cooked a day in my life, but suddenly I’m frying a whole fish. TikTok dance challenges are a religion. Insomnia is my middle name. No one’s asking for it, but I’m going live on Instagram three times a week. Everything’s gonna be OK!\n\nActress on Freeform’s Good Trouble\n\nSherry Cola\n\nI’ve been playing a lot of Sims, watching more movies, doing more cooking, FaceTiming my family and friends more, creating more, and learning the value of slowing down in a fast-paced world. It’s forced me to focus on what I have instead of what I don’t, and that’s been very freeing!\n\nSinger\n\nNIKI\n\nSeeking the wisdom that’s to be found in all this uncertainty. Meditating, praying, breathing, journaling and being kind to myself in this time. Listening to what my body is telling me...If it tells me to go for a run, try a new handstand, read a book, eat chocolate while sitting with my tears, dance till I’m dizzy or write till my fingers feel numb...That’s what I do.\n\nActress on HBO’s Lovecraft Country\n\nJurnee Smollett\n\nDuring this quarantine, I’m trying to be gentle with myself. At the start, I wasn’t feeling motivated. I felt lost and sad, and found myself feeling guilty for feeling that way. Then I realized THAT’S OK! When I gave myself permission to be human, that’s when I started to become more motivated and creative! I started running again for the first time in years, cooking and learning new recipes, writing music, and I’ve been doing an Instagram Live series on my page called “Hold The Phone with Katie Stevens!” where I interview friends with all different job descriptions, stories and skills! It’s been a wonderful way for me to feel connected and have something to look forward to every day. I’m trying to enjoy this time with my husband in our home, to slow down and realize what matters to me. I can say, I’m most excited to hug my family and friends when this is all over!

Even fresh air.\n\nCohost on The Real\n\nJeannie Mai\n\nDuring quarantine, I’m spending a lot of time baking lots of treats, continuous dates with my goofball of a boyfriend, trying on dresses in my closet and organizing my perfume.\n\nDigital Creator and Singer\n\nGabi DeMartino\n\nHappy Social Distancing from Los Angeles! What a crazy time this has been! I tend to be a stubbornly optimistic individual, so I have spent this quarantine trying to look on the bright side and find the silver linings. It’s not always easy—if there’s anything I’ve learned about myself during this time, it’s that I need sunshine and socialization to feel normal—neither of which we’ve had during this time (who knew it could rain so much in L.A.) However, I’ve made the most of the bright spots literally and figuratively. I’ve been working out, sitting in the sunshine and catching up with friends and family via FaceTime. For someone who is never home, it’s also been nice to have an opportunity to be back and hack away at those little to-do list items that tend to pile up around the house. I had to laugh, though, since I was so excited to visit my friends and catch up with everyone while back home—however no one can get together with the outbreak. I’m so thankful we live in a period of time where we have technology that will keep us in touch even when we have to stay apart. I am quarantining on my own so being able to reconnect with folks virtually has been my saving grace during this time and such a huge help in dealing with the emotional ups and downs that come with this strange way of living. Just like everyone else, my life has changed drastically—as someone who travels at least once every 10 days, it’s been odd being in one place and not interacting with humans. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve woken up in the middle of the night worried that I need to pack for something but I can’t remember for what—which just ended with me laughing at myself and going back to sleep. We need to keep our senses of humor to keep our sanity. I think the biggest takeaway we can all glean from this is that it’s been a beautiful way to come together as a community while the world heals itself. To reconnect on a human level in a world that lately has been so divided has been a gift. The creativity, the humanitarianism, the memes and the innovation are all representations of the human spirit that persists despite what hardships we go through. As someone who comes from a family of health and medical professionals, my heart goes out to everyone who works in the healthcare industry who is tirelessly exerting themselves to heal the humanity, the world and solve this problem. So much respect also goes out to all of the frontline workers who keep our world running while we ride this out. And I send my love to all as we struggle to make sense of what is happening while keeping our wits about us. Together, we will get through this. And when it’s all over, I’m going to gather my friends and hug them all tight, go on a long hike in the fresh air, and then head straight for a giant feast at my favorite Mexican restaurant. Once those boxes are checked, I'm headed to the airport and escape to some adventure destination—don't worry, I'll send you a postcard ;) Until then, I will continue to self-care and dream of the day when the world finally heals and life returns to normal. Xx\n\nActress on The CW’s Arrow\n\nKat McNamara\n\nAs artists, we must stay creative! We are either expanding or contracting. It’s been a conscious effort to turn the uncertainty and fear around into seeing this time as a blessing. Meditation has helped quiet my mind. I don’t believe we will ever have this slower pace of time, so I am actually embracing and enjoying it, fortunately with my family. It’s nice not to feel pressure when it comes to time...so there has been a lot of reflection, breathing, and collectively I think everyone is focusing on health and self care. For me, it’s mental, physical and spiritual. I have moments when I feel the anxiety creeping in and then I remember we are all in this thing together...\n\nSinger and Member of The Pussycat Dolls\n\nCarmit Bachar\n\nDuring quarantine, I appreciate the simple things in life more than ever. Before this, I was always on the go, but now that we’re forced to slow down, I’ve done my best to keep a positive outlook and a happy spirit. I have my ups and my downs, but I’ve realized that I am fully capable of being happy just being home with my husband. I’m listening to music and dancing like I would when I was growing up, which has been an amazing way to decompress. I’ve also been praying a lot more for our healthcare workers and our world. I definitely miss the in-person human connection. As a Latina, it’s in my blood to always want to show love through physical touch! I’m blessed to have my husband with me during this time, but I can’t wait to hug my full family when this is over.\n\nFashion Designer, Entrepreneur and Founder of Camila Coelho Collection\n\nCamila Coelho\n\nHi, everybody! I hope that you all are staying safe and healthy during this time. What I’m doing to cope during this time is a lot of baking, a lot of cooking, talking on the phone a lot, watching movies and cuddling with my cats, which has been really nice. And sleep! That has been an added bonus. What I miss the most about normal life is of course performing, being on tour. I was on tour and then I had to postpone due to COVID sadly. I miss that. And I miss hugs a lot. I’m a hugger, y’all. I’m from Texas, and I’m a hugger. And I really, really, really miss giving hugs. What I’m excited to do when life returns to normal would be, of course, I can’t wait to go and fly to San Antonio, Texas, and see my family. I miss them terribly. Of course, I cannot wait to go back out on tour. It’s going to be awesome when that day comes. Love you, guys. Sending you so much love.\n\nSinger\n\nAlly Brooke\n\nThis time has truly emphasized my appreciation for my family and loved ones and focus on the little things that make me happy. It’s important to embrace slowing down and performing small acts of self care when possible, and showing support for those that mean the most to us, as well as for those who are on the front lines every day to keep us all safe.\n\nModel and Eylure Brand Ambassador\n\nJordyn Woods\n\nThis time spent at home and in quarantine has reminded me how grateful I am every day for my health, family (pups included) and close friends. It has been an opportunity to pivot in a book tour and get creative about connecting with people online about their forgiveness journey. I am so beyond grateful for everyone in the medical field and first responders for going to work every day and risking their safety and wellbeing to keep us all safe. I know this has been an incredibly challenging and unpredictable time for so many, and I hope we can continue to support one another as we navigate this new world together. I can’t wait for this to be over, to continue to applaud all those who have taken charge and guided us through this unrealistic time, and to hug loved ones again.\n\nAuthor of The Gift of Forgiveness\n\nKatherine Schwarzenegger Pratt\n\nI have my moments of anxiety, but overall I am handling it well. My heart bleeds every time I think of those who don’t have the option to stay home, and families and businesses that are greatly struggling. I find comfort in the fact that everyone is taking this pandemic seriously and taking all the necessary measures to keep one another safe while also trying to stay connected and positive, even towards complete strangers. I have had to find new ways to collaborate with brands and photographers, for example FaceTime photo shoots. I miss my friends; work allowed me to see them on nearly a daily basis. I really miss being on set. I really enjoy the company of every person I work with. It’s always incredibly fun on set. So it’s not about the work really; it’s about the people I work with.\n\nModel\n\nGrace Elizabeth\n\nI’m doing well! Keeping my routine and getting ready just a little bit everyday has kept me the most sane while we are all quarantined. I have also continued to vlog for my YouTube channel and remotely record my podcast Pretty Basic with Remi Cruz, so that helps keep a small piece or normalcy in my life. I miss my friends and family the most. Once we are finally through this, I can’t wait to do things that I’d take for granted like a simple hug.\n\nDigital Creator and Cohost of Pretty Basic\n\nAlisha Marie\n\nAs a hairdresser and entrepreneur during these times, I’ve been dreaming about the day I get to touch hair again and see my XMONDO Hair family. Since I can’t leave the house, I’ve taken the time to master new photography skills and learn every TikTok dance possible so I can compete with the 15-year-olds on the app.\n\nProfessional Hairstylist and CEO of XMONDO Hair\n\nBrad Mondo\n\nBeing in quarantine has been an adjustment to say the least. I used to think I wanted more alone time but that was because so much of my time was spent being around others and socializing. Now that I have all the alone time in the world, I've realized how much being around others energizes me. It's been a life-saver having FaceTime and Zoom to connect and hang out with my friends and family. I will say though that having all this time at home has been a nice change of pace. It's really allowed me to get into a routine and do things I felt I didn't have the time for like practicing my French, playing piano or drawing. I really do miss a good brunch and going to the movies. I love hosting, so when we're able to, I'm so excited to invite people over and have a game night. I can't wait.\n\nActress on Amazon’s Upload\n\nAndy Allo\n\nI’m quarantining at home with my hubby and pup! This time has been extremely bizarre, albeit eye-opening. I’m really realizing how minuscule things I thought I needed before are now. I miss human interaction and being able to go in and out as I please, even to Starbucks! However, after this is over I think I will have a new outlook on life and a whole lot of gratitude!\n\nModel and Founder of All Worthy\n\nHunter McGrady\n\nRight now is an extremely trying time in the world. There isn't a single individual who isn't affected in some way by this pandemic. I, and many of my friends, have lost the ability to connect with each other in person. I miss going to the gym and playing basketball, but I'm substituting with 2K and home workouts. I miss going to the movies, so instead I binge everything from home with my family. I miss going to concerts, but it’s forced me to dive into creating my own music and discover artists I wouldn’t normally listen to. These are hard times for all of us, but necessity is the mother of invention. It’s amazing to see people find new and creative ways to do all the things that once required us to be together, from home.\n\nActor on Netflix’s Outer Banks\n\nJonathan Daviss\n\nUnexpected and extreme scenarios magnify whatever is already inside—our defense mechanisms, relational instincts, our tendency to shrink or expand in conflict and how accountable we hold ourselves to contributing to society. In addition to leading my online community through weekly mental health check-ins, mindfulness exercises and movement courses, I’m getting involved with various cities and organizations to support kids and families who are facing a shortage of resources. Personally, I’m sticking to a daily regimen of exercise, meditation and fresh cooking to maintain normalcy, and reading Bodyfulness by Christine Caldwell and Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler. Sidenote: I’m delightfully ignoring my tweezers and razor and roots...maybe indefinitely?\n\nMultihyphenate Artist and Host of Symplexity\n\nAlyson Stoner\n\nThe most important thing to me right now is staying healthy and keeping my immunity up. I’ve been really focused on what I consume, what I let into my spirit, what I eat and drink, and balancing what I watch and read. I’ve been listening to guided meditations and I love listening to worship music. Finding a great playlist that makes you feel at peace and finding shows that allow you to escape is awesome. I’ve been watching things that are simple, fun and not too deep like Curb Your Enthusiasm and Golden Girls. I think the biggest change, for most people, is the loss of work or adapting to work from our homes. It’s changed how we produce The Real and how I produce content for \"All Things Adrienne\". We started taping The Real from home—so there will be all new episodes of The Real, LIVE from the quarantine, from our homes, shot by us. I’m really excited to be able to be back with the girls again and hope we can be a light for our audience at home, just an hour escape from boredom or stress, for girlfriend time.\n\nCohost on The Real\n\nAdrienne Bailon-Houghton\n\nI cannot think of a time where we have been forced to slow down, forced to think and forced to be comfortable in the uncomfortable without knowing when it will end. For myself, finding and sticking to a consistent routine has been so important to my productivity. Knowing that I have a constant with my routine, while everything else around me is changing and evolving, has helped me stay grounded and positive through all of this. My day to day has shifted but that doesn't mean it has slowed down. I have a business to run, partnerships to launch and a team to carry, all while being in the confines of a space that isn't mine. I am quarantining in Austin (as we have currently paused on the production of the next season of Queer Eye), and I am so grateful to have [my husband] Dewey and a couple of friends with me. I've been very fortunate to have the company and a safe place to quarantine in amongst the isolation but coming back home to L.A. and being in my own space will be a nice exhale. My bed, my friends and my team will be so much more of an appreciation now that we've been restricted of human contact and comfort. This unprecedented situation has allowed me and everyone to truly reflect, push pause and focus on each other. The world is slowing down and regenerating, people are looking out for each other, and people are focused on the larger picture, which is something I am focusing on to stay positive and happy.\n\nDesign Expert on Netflix’s Queer Eye\n\nBobby Berk\n\nI miss everyone so much! Hope you’re all staying safe. I know it can be hard to stay positive, but I’ve been trying to keep busy doing some of the things I love most like cooking my favorite recipes and watching way too much TV! I’ve also been hard at work putting the finishing touches on some new music, so I can share with you all very soon! In the meantime, hope you’re loving \"Kings & Queens\"! Sending so much love to everyone and can’t wait to be together again soon!\n\nSinger\n\nAva Max\n\n“I try and take it day by day. Things are so touch and go for all of us right now; it’s important for us to stay informed, remind each other to stay present and make decisions as each day evolves. We’re all taking on new responsibilities and we make an effort to communicate with kindness and support of strategy to keep the household running in this time of unknown. We are practicing social distance, which is challenging at times, but it’s offered the gift of being with our children. Time moves so quickly and we remind each other to take the good moments as a gift. I miss going to bookstores with our children, taking them to museums, the park. And I’ve always considered myself a clean person, but I’ve never had bleeding knuckles before from washing my hands. When things resume to normal, I can’t wait to impulsively make plans…outside.\n\nActress and Author of You and I, as Mothers: A Raw and Honest Guide to Motherhood\n\nLaura Prepon\n\nTo say quarantine has been an odd time is an understatement, but I have actually been taking this opportunity to really appreciate slowing down. I have been traveling a lot for the last three years, and between various home and office moves, I haven't really been in one place for an extended period of time. We began quarantining with four friends not knowing how long we'd be together, and having six of us in one house together to cook, hang out, nest, do housework and other projects has felt like a real treat. It feels like we're back in college (but we're the only ones there! ;) ). It's hard to reconcile the calmness I feel with the immense sadness and worry that comes with these circumstances, but I'm doing my best to take it one day at a time and remember that it is out of my control. All I can do is be a responsible citizen and neighbor by staying home, so that's what I'm doing. And when I get restless, I put on a dress and have a dance party, because...why the hell not?!\n\nDJ, Entrepreneur and Founder of HBFIT\n\nHannah Bronfman\n\nThis is a strange time for everyone right now, and I am just trying to do my part by staying in my house and following social distancing rules. I've been in my house for a month now with my sister and pets. We've been extra cautious as my mom has an immunity issue and she spends quite a lot of time here. I've been able to see my brother a couple of times and he's been quarantined even longer. To pass time, I've been writing and preparing a few shows that will go into development once we return to normal and safer times. We've been doing DIY projects, yoga, cooking, watching every show we can find and organizing the house. We might start some gardening too. I'm having \"date\" night with my boyfriend, Ben, through FaceTime. We have dinner and binge shows together. We are sharing our work via FaceTime as well, he's writing music and serenades me...I read him scripts I'm working on. It's challenging but you know....as they say, we are all in this together. I feel blessed that my family and friends have remained healthy; that's most important to me right now. Sure, being stuck at the house isn't fun but it's a small price to pay to keep others healthy. I mean look at all the essential workers...risking their health and those close to them so that they can take care of us. Heroes! What can I complain about? I'm looking forward to life returning to normal and wonder what that'll look like. I can't wait to see Ben, go to a movie and return to work. It'll just be nice to have the rest of the family and my friends over for dinner and give them a hug!\n\nBella Thorne\n\nActress and Singer\n\nThis week, I definitely feel like I’m more settled into a routine. For me, establishing a new routine is really important, as well as making goals, checking in with people and being kind to myself and my expectations for what this time will look like. I try to move everyday. I try to feel active, whether that’s an Instagram workout video, which I actually enjoy, because you can see how many people are participating, so there’s some sort of communal energy. It makes me giggle because I think of all of us doing awkward squats or dancing around in our living rooms, trying to stay sane together. That’s been a joy for me. I talk to my grandparents a lot more often. Thankfully, they both know how to FaceTime, so I look forward to that every week. It’s really overwhelming and it’s really heartbreaking, especially as I hear from more and more friends about how their parents are sick. It’s really sobering. It’s weird. You have free time, you want to lounge and you want to drink a ton of wine, but then at the same time, I guess I should be productive. Just taking it day by day. Checking in with yourself. Checking in with the people around you. Counting your blessings. I hope we can all come out of this more aware of each other. All of this shows how broken our healthcare system is and the discrepancy of how many people have money and those who don’t. You have to stay positive, but I also think it’s important to look at the way we’re failing certain people.\n\nAnnaSophia Robb\n\nActress on Hulu’s Little Fires Everywhere\n\nI was fortunate that right before quarantine I came to LA with my son, mom and sister to visit my fiancé and we stayed here. We cook together, we clean together and we play together. I’ve never had this much time to spend with my family so I’m taking advantage and learning so many other things. The most important thing is enjoying my family and taking care of my son. My life changed a lot. As a model I travel so much and now we have to stay at home. Also, this is the first time in the 10 years of my career that I was forced to stop working so I miss work. I’ve grown up in a family of teachers, my mom, grandma and aunties are all teachers, so I’ve always known how hard it can be and the patience they have. I miss the ability to move around freely. I’m excited to hug my family and friends when life returns to normal.\n\nLais Ribeiro\n\nModel\n\nI think what we’re going through right now is absolutely horrific, but I have found that I’m connecting with friends more than I maybe ever have. We spend so much time with very brief text messages that really don’t have a lot of depth, and I think being where we are right now is such an opportunity for us to connect on a deeper level by speaking over the phone, which I don’t think people have done in a very long time. Now, these conversations aren’t just gossiping or sort of surface level. It’s, ‘How’s your family? How are you feeling? How are your emotions? How’s your stress?’ The most important thing for us as a family, my mom included, was that we came up with a really good schedule. We’ve never really felt super on top of each other because we make sure that everyone has their own individual space. I could definitely find myself being someone to get very sad by all of this. And it’s very anxiety-provoking, but we’ve really supported one another and made sure that we’ve kept our spirits lifted as much as possible.\n\nLea Michele\n\nActress and Singer\n\nI am extremely grateful and fortunate to say that I don’t feel like my life has changed too much or been negatively affected by this pandemic, relatively speaking. I think almost everyone, in their own unique situation at this time, is experiencing anxiety and fear for different reasons. There are some things I have been doing to cope with the anxiety that I myself have been feeling. I have been focusing a lot on my mental, physical and spiritual health by having a consistent routine. I wake up in the morning, do an hour of meditation/yoga/breathing exercises and then try to do a fitness workout before starting the rest of my day. I try to make it a point to take a 20-30 minute walk outside in my neighborhood every day and feel the sun on my skin and breathe in fresh air. Listening to uplifting music throughout the day also helps me to stay positive. To stay creative, I have been reading, journaling, attending acting workshops/seminars on Zoom, dancing around my apartment, trying new recipes and watching inspirational interviews/Q&A’s with people I look up to. I miss being able to see my family/friends, sitting at cafés/restaurants and going to dance classes and fitness studios. I hope we will all come out of this more empathetic, aware and appreciative of everything we missed. I think the first thing I’ll do when the quarantine lifts is go with my husband to the beach, soak in the sun and thank nature for reminding me to never take anything or anyone for granted.\n\nRicha Moorjani\n\nActress on Netflix’s Never Have I Ever\n\nLife in quarantine has been challenging. It’s been interesting learning new ways of how to be in the world. Like wearing masks and using disinfectant more than I’d like to. This experience has certainly put my life in perspective. Seeing how essential workers and communities of color are endangered and disproportionately affected by this virus has opened my eyes even more to the incredible inequalities in this country. Universal healthcare is imperative and I will never be OK with the economy being more important than people’s safety. Mother Earth is hurting and we have to be the solution. I hope we all are paying attention! We all have to fight against this government and other institutions like this one who are hurting and killing people. If you think you didn’t have skin in the game, think again. Because I am aware of these injustices, I am supporting organizations like the Farmworkers Relief Fund and the Immigrant Legal Recourse Center, who is fighting for our incarcerated and detained community. At home I’ve created a schedule for myself that is based on self-improvement and building healthy habits. I wake up and drink hot water and lime and sometimes gargle with baking soda, lime and apple cider vinegar to kill any bacteria I may have in my throat. My mom sends me all types of recipes to help with the times. I then take an hour to read (having this in my schedule has really helped since reading does not come easily yet). This has been rewarding because it’s helped my creative process quite a bit. I’m interested in poetry and working through some of my feelings that way. Physical fitness is important to me so keeping this a part of my daily routine keeps me healthy and ready for anything. I then dedicate time for work, which includes overseeing projects I’ve already started and continuing my education with research that pertains to the work I’m already invested in. I also have days where I’M JUST NOT FEELING IT, so I cope with TV, pizza, chocolate, and I thank God I can fuck off on my couch with no one to bother me. So yeah, I’m enjoying quiet time for the first time; I’ve learned to embrace this slower pace and not rush to the imaginary finish line. I look forward to embracing my loved ones again, perhaps on a beautiful beach somewhere.\n\nActress and Author of In the Country We Love\n\nDiane Guerrero\n\nWant to share your own quarantine story with us?

Wherever you were, it’s obvious that the world looks a whole lot different than it did back then. Soon after the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic, STYLECASTER embarked on a project to ask dozens of celebrities and public figures—from actors and influencers to supermodels and reality stars—what their lives look like in these unprecedented times. We’ve compiled their responses into Snapshots From Quarantine, a collection of original self-portraits and accompanying stories from these stars about how they’re dealing with social distancing, what they miss most about normal life and the first thing they’ll do once it’s safe to go outside again. Some have used this time to virtually connect with friends and loved ones. Others have taken the opportunity to pick up new hobbies, or catch up on TV shows they’ve been meaning to watch. And, much like the rest of us, they’re doing what they can to remain healthy, sane and hopeful that brighter days are ahead. As of May 13, 2020, there have been more than four million reported cases of COVID-19, and a quarter of a million deaths worldwide. A staggering percentage of both have occurred in the United States. Through this project, our goal is to offer an unfiltered view into how a wide range of people we admire are coping. We are deeply cognizant of the seriousness of this global crisis, and urge those who can to donate to organizations that help healthcare and essential workers, and those most in need of aid. With that said, we present Snapshots From Quarantine. Click through to see exclusive photos and hear from stars like Hannah Bronfman, Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt, Lea Michele, Jordyn Woods and many others—in their own words.

I've been in my house for a month now with my sister and pets. We've been extra cautious as my mom has an immunity issue and she spends quite a lot of time here. I've been able to see my brother a couple of times and he's been quarantined even longer. To pass time, I've been writing and preparing a few shows that will go into development once we return to normal and safer times. We've been doing DIY projects, yoga, cooking, watching every show we can find and organizing the house. We might start some gardening too. I'm having \"date\" night with my boyfriend, Ben, through FaceTime. We have dinner and binge shows together. We are sharing our work via FaceTime as well, he's writing music and serenades me...I read him scripts I'm working on. It's challenging but you know....as they say, we are all in this together. I feel blessed that my family and friends have remained healthy; that's most important to me right now. Sure, being stuck at the house isn't fun but it's a small price to pay to keep others healthy. I mean look at all the essential workers...risking their health and those close to them so that they can take care of us. Heroes! What can I complain about? I'm looking forward to life returning to normal and wonder what that'll look like. I can't wait to see Ben, go to a movie and return to work. It'll just be nice to have the rest of the family and my friends over for dinner and give them a hug!\n\nBella Thorne\n\nActress and Singer\n\nW\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\nby Jason Pham\n\nb r a d m o n d o\n\nj u r n e e s m o l l e t t\n\nd i a n e g u e r r e r o\n\nbobby berk\n\njonathan daviss\n\nadrienne bailon-houghton\n\nalyson stoner\n\nI’m quarantining at home with my hubby and pup! This time has been extremely bizarre, albeit eye-opening. I’m really realizing how minuscule things I thought I needed before are now. I miss human interaction and being able to go in and out as I please, even to Starbucks! However, after this is over I think I will have a new outlook on life and a whole lot of gratitude!\n\nmodel\n\nHunter McGrady\n\nRight now is an extremely trying time in the world. There isn't a single individual who isn't affected in some way by this pandemic. I, and many of my friends, have lost the ability to connect with each other in person. I miss going to the gym and playing basketball, but I'm substituting with 2K and home workouts. I miss going to the movies, so instead I binge everything from home with my family. I miss going to concerts, but it’s forced me to dive into creating my own music and discover artists I wouldn’t normally listen to. These are hard times for all of us, but necessity is the mother of invention. It’s amazing to see people find new and creative ways to do all the things that once required us to be together, from home.\n\nactor on Netflix’s Outer Banks\n\nJonathan Daviss\n\nUnexpected and extreme scenarios magnify whatever is already inside—our defense mechanisms, relational instincts, our tendency to shrink or expand in conflict and how accountable we hold ourselves to contributing to society. In addition to leading my online community through weekly mental health check-ins, mindfulness exercises and movement courses, I’m getting involved with various cities and organizations to support kids and families who are facing a shortage of resources. Personally, I’m sticking to a daily regimen of exercise, meditation and fresh cooking to maintain normalcy, and reading Bodyfulness by Christine Caldwell and Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler. Sidenote: I’m delightfully ignoring my tweezers and razor and roots...maybe indefinitely?\n\n\"I’m delightfully ignoring my tweezers and razor and roots...maybe indefinitely?\"\n\nmultihyphenate artist and host of “Simplexity”\n\nAlyson Stoner\n\nI cannot think of a time where we have been forced to slow down, forced to think and forced to be comfortable in the uncomfortable without knowing when it will end. For myself, finding and sticking to a consistent routine has been so important to my productivity. Knowing that I have a constant with my routine, while everything else around me is changing and evolving, has helped me stay grounded and positive through all of this. My day to day has shifted but that doesn't mean it has slowed down. I have a business to run, partnerships to launch and a team to carry, all while being in the confines of a space that isn't mine. I am quarantining in Austin (as we have currently paused on the production of the next season of Queer Eye), and I am so grateful to have [my husband] Dewey and a couple of friends with me. I've been very fortunate to have the company and a safe place to quarantine in amongst the isolation but coming back home to L.A. and being in my own space will be a nice exhale. My bed, my friends and my team will be so much more of an appreciation now that we've been restricted of human contact and comfort. This unprecedented situation has allowed me and everyone to truly reflect, push pause and focus on each other. The world is slowing down and regenerating, people are looking out for each other, and people are focused on the larger picture, which is something I am focusing on to stay positive and happy.\n\ndesign expert on Netflix’s Queer Eye\n\nBobby Burke\n\nThe most important thing to me right now is staying healthy and keeping my immunity up. I’ve been really focused on what I consume, what I let into my spirit, what I eat and drink, and balancing what I watch and read. I’ve been listening to guided meditations and I love listening to worship music. Finding a great playlist that makes you feel at peace and finding shows that allow you to escape is awesome. I’ve been watching things that are simple, fun and not too deep like Curb Your Enthusiasm and Golden Girls. I think the biggest change, for most people, is the loss of work or adapting to work from our homes. It’s changed how we produce The Real and how I produce content for All Things Adrienne. We started taping The Real from home—so there will be all new episodes of The Real, LIVE from the quarantine, from our homes, shot by us. I’m really excited to be able to be back with the girls again and hope we can be a light for our audience at home, just an hour escape from boredom or stress, for girlfriend time.\n\ncohost on The Real\n\nAdrienne Bailon\n\nThis unprecedented situation has allowed me and everyone to truly reflect, push pause and focus on each other.\n\nIf I had a dog, he would hate me by now. My cat does hate me now, so there’s that.\n\n- isabella gomez\n\nWant to share your own quarantine story with us?

Since all production has stopped, my two current projects are being postponed. I am spending time hiking, binge-watching Schitt's Creek with my mom and dad, reading (I just finished re-reading an Alex Rider book, which is a series I've always enjoyed) and have been doing a little bit of driving for a local grocery delivery service. I recently got two new video games and actually played remotely with Gavin, who plays Moody from Little Fires Everywhere! I've also been participating in an online Bible study called \"Finding Peace.” We had to cancel our family vacation, so when the world returns to normal, that is definitely a high priority! But most of all, I look forward to getting back to work. We only have two weeks left on production for Panic with Amazon Studios, and then this summer, I am scheduled to start filming Superman and Lois for The CW.\n\nactor on Hulu’s Little Fires Everywhere\n\nJordan Elsass\n\nMy main priority while we are all social distancing has been staying positive and trying to stick to some sort of a schedule. I have been spending a lot of time on the couch playing Animal Crossing and binge-watching old movies to pass the time. But on a more productive note, shortly before the stay at home orders went into effect, I moved, so I finished all my unpacking and have been continuing to upload vlogs on my YouTube channel and remotely record my weekly podcast “Pretty Basic.” Squeezing in some at-home workouts and staying active is helping keep my immune system up and my mental health in check. When we get past all of this, I think I am most excited to reunite with my family and friends and give everyone a big hug. We will get through this, but until then, everyone please stay home and stay safe.\n\ndigital creator and cohost of “Pretty Basic”\n\nRemi Cruz\n\nDuring quarantine, I've been trying to stay as creative and active as possible. I've been meditating and working out a lot. I'm currently trying to reteach myself how to do the splits and a handstand! I've also been focusing on finishing writing a script I've been working on and writing songs! I miss hanging out with my friends, going to restaurants (lol), and also acting (being on set and going to auditions). I'm most excited to hug all my friends when all of this is done. We're planning on doing a self-care day once all of this is done which I'm definitely looking forward to! My biggest wish is for people to stay safe and inside. The more time spent inside during this time, the less time this pandemic will last.\n\nactress on Hulu’s Little Fires Everywhere\n\nLexi Underwood\n\nQ.U.A.R.A.N.T.I.N.E. Questioning everything I’ve done since the day I was born. Unpacked my luggage from my February cruise trip, finally. Alcohol seems to be the answer. Really need to wash my hair, but…I don’t want to? Always waking up at noon. Never cooked a day in my life, but suddenly I’m frying a whole fish. TikTok dance challenges are a religion. Insomnia is my middle name.\n\nactress on Freeform’s Good Trouble\n\nSherry Cola\n\nI’ve been playing a lot of Sims, watching more movies, doing more cooking, FaceTiming my family and friends more, creating more, and learning the value of slowing down in a fast-paced world. It’s forced me to focus on what I have instead of what I don’t, and that’s been very freeing!\n\nsinger\n\nNIKI\n\n“I try and take it day by day. Things are so touch and go for all of us right now; it’s important for us to stay informed, remind each other to stay present and make decisions as each day evolves. We’re all taking on new responsibilities and we make an effort to communicate with kindness and support of strategy to keep the household running in this time of unknown. We are practicing social distance, which is challenging at times, but it’s offered the gift of being with our children. Time moves so quickly and we remind each other to take the good moments as a gift. I miss going to bookstores with our children, taking them to museums, the park. And I’ve always considered myself a clean person, but I’ve never had bleeding knuckles before from washing my hands. When things resume to normal, I can’t wait to Impulsively make plans…outside.\n\nactress and author of You and I, as Mothers: A Raw and Honest Guide to Motherhood\n\nLaura Prepo"
