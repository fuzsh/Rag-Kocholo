        "text": "Carmit Bachar, the fire-hot redhead, is as talented as she is beautiful. Her mother is of Dutch/Indonesian decent and her father is Israeli. Being a native of Los Angeles and coming from a family of entertainers has led her down the path of working with some of the most successful artists in music: No Doubt, Beyonc√©, P. Diddy, Macy Gray and Janet Jackson to name a few. She has numerous feature film and commercial credits - her \"bon-bon\" was most recognized as Ricky Martin's La Vida Loca girl! Carmit is one of the most respected dancers and choreographers in the business.\n\nNot to be limited to just one genre, she attended Hamilton Academy of Music, in order to hone her sultry voice and piano chops. She also studied dance and viola. And she was a rhythmic gymnastics national team member and placed 5th at the '92 Olympic Trials.\n\nCarmit has been putting her heart and soul into the Dolls since the underground movement began in 1995. \"Individual personality makes this group sassy,\" she says, which is where her nickname 'Foxy' comes from. \"You have to be comfortable in your skin and exude confidence.\"\n\nBorn with a cleft lip/palate, Carmit's success has given her the desire to give back to children. She is in the process of founding a non-profit organization, Smile With Me, for the community of cleft children in Los Angeles. Carmit believes in limitless possibility and having overcome her own obstacles, she feels compelled to instill passion and creativity wherever she goes. With her inspirational personality, powerful presence and determination, she is sharing that light with one child at a time."
