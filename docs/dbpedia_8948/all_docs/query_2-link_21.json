        "text": "Federline Ate My Baby! said:\n\nxolondon nailed it on the head, I think.Ã‚Â Aside from Nicole (and arguably, Melody), the sole purpose for the other four pop 'idles' in the Pussycat Dolls is to be 'eye candy.'Ã‚Â They don't sing, and their dancing is certainly nothing particulary memorable.Ã‚Â If one's sole purpose to look good/sell sex, and you're not remotely attractive, you have no claim to your own 'celebrity.'\n\nI think the point Diamond Doggie Bag was making was the fact that comments along the lines of Carmit and the others being 'too old' or 'too ugly' or 'not singing on the records' has been done to death on these boards a million times.Ã‚Â If no-one has anything new, interesting or witty to add (and the above posts would suggest a big fat juicy zero for all three) then it's probably high time we left it at that.Ã‚Â If the problem is that they're being 'rewarded undeservedly' why contribute to such rewards by paying such undue attention?\n\nOh, and as for the 'not doing anything' comment - it didn't stop quite a few of the same people banging on about S Club 8 in the earlier days of the board, despite the fact that at least half of that group have probably never set foot in a recording studio.\n\nMike said:\n\nI think the point Diamond Doggie Bag was making was the fact that comments along the lines of Carmit and the others being 'too old' or 'too ugly' or 'not singing on the records' has been done to death on these boards a million times.Ã‚Â If no-one has anything new, interesting or witty to add (and the above posts would suggest a big fat juicy zero for all three) then it's probably high time we left it at that.Ã‚Â If the problem is that they're being 'rewarded undeservedly' why contribute to such rewards by paying such undue attention?\n\nOh, and as for the 'not doing anything' comment - it didn't stop quite a few of the same people banging on about S Club 8 in the earlier days of the board, despite the fact that at least half of that group have probably never set foot in a recording studio.\n\nI think the point several of you are missing is that this thread was about Carmit: whether or not she is old, ugly, and useless; whether or not she is talented and attractive enough to warrant her status as a pop star.Ã‚Â That is one of the things we DO here...discuss banal and trivial aspects of pop stardom.Ã‚Â This is not mutually exclusive to serious discussions of music or the business.Ã‚Â Frankly, one of the reasons I love this place is that I can find 23 other people who want to discuss minutiae of songs themselves as well as who's a right old hag.\n\nClearly the Pussycat Dolls have struck a chord with people.Ã‚Â No one's forcing anyone to post about Carmit anymore than Girls Aloud.Ã‚Â No one's forcing you to keep reading about it either.Ã‚Â I love Rachel Stevens, but I avoid any thread with her in the title like a plague--I don't feel the need to read the same argument over and over.Ã‚Â But clearly some people feel the need to rehash.Ã‚Â\n\nC'est la forum.\n\nIf you find the discussion tedious or uncalled for...well, there are several other threads for your viewing pleasure.Ã‚Â To my knowledge, no one has broken any board rules in this thread--everything's been expressed relatively well; no one's talked about the Pussycat Doll's midweek status; no one's posted an mp3 of the \"Hot Stuff\" remix or insinuated that Carmit enjoys the company of men, ladies, or animals.\n\nIronically, I don't really care one way or the other about Carmit; I do not find her attractive but, as I pointed out, my main compulsion for contributing to this discussion is that throughout the multiple threads about the PCD and/or their members, which I (and apparently several of you) have visited, someone's always using the excuse \"Carmit has a cleft lip!Ã‚Â You can't think she's ugly!\"\n\nIndeed, the cleft lip is hardly noticeable and the least of Carmit's worries.Ã‚Â I just resent being told what I can or cannot feel about someone who is subjecting themselves to public scrutiny.\n\nSimilarly, I resent being called a \"moron\" for my opinion, which thanks to diamond doggie bag's eloquence has brought us to this point...\n\nNow, we've all seen to it that this thread will be shut down soon.Ã‚Â Not that I have much more to say regarding Carmit, mind you.Ã‚Â But my point is that those of you who have decided to be the 'moral compass' of Popjustice have actually harmed a discussion which harms no one.\n\nI'd argue that unless you yourself are Carmit Bachar, you've no right to call any of your fellow posters \"morons\" in this thread or elsewhere on the board.Ã‚Â Posting a comment like that is, in fact, a grievous indictment of your own character, rather than one of others' behaviour.\n\nI don't think anyone's trying to be a moral compass. I'd just rather the board stayed fresh, varied and interesting, and it's been heading in the opposite direction for quite some months now. I don't personally care about Carmit or any of the Pussycat Dolls really, but that doesn't alter the fact that there's nothing clever, original or interesting about saying someone is ugly and looks like a man, which is essentially the sum total of what's been said here.\n\nI also find the argument about her having 'no right to celebrity status' somewhat bizarre and outdated in 2006. Celebrity status has never meant less. As someone (possibly Maureen) pointed out elsewhere, as soon as five people have heard of you and one of them's taken your picture, you're a celebrity. What (if anything) you have done to 'deserve' it is something of a moot point nowadays.\n\nIn any case, to what extent is Carmit really a 'celebrity' in the sense you refer to? How many people would answer you with anything other than a blank stare when you said the name 'Carmit Bachar' to them?\n\nMike said:\n\nI also find the argument about her having 'no right to celebrity status' somewhat bizarre and outdated in 2006.Ã‚Â Celebrity status has never meant less.Ã‚Â As someone (possibly Maureen) pointed out elsewhere, as soon as five people have heard of you and one of them's taken your picture, you're a celebrity.Ã‚Â What (if anything) you have done to 'deserve' it is something of a moot point nowadays.\n\nIn any case, to what extent is Carmit really a 'celebrity' in the sense you refer to?Ã‚Â How many people would answer you with anything other than a blank stare when you said the name 'Carmit Bachar' to them?\n\nIf we were discussing Ashely Breathe or a random person miming to Madonna on YouTube, that would be one thing (and certainly something someone should post about should they so choose).Ã‚Â But we are discussing a member of one of the most successful pop groups of the year, for better or worse.Ã‚Â Playing naive and shrugging off her celebrity status won't work in this case.Ã‚Â Asking someone what they think of 'Carmit Bachar' would probably elicit a blank stare, but asking someone what they thought of the 'the Old Ginger Woman From The Pussycat Dolls' would probably get a definite response.\n\nThat's all I have to say about Carmit.Ã‚Â I'm going to--gasp--do a little self-moderating and continue the rest of this in the appropriate forum.\n\nThe rest of you, feel free to continue on whether or not Carmit's old and/or ugly.\n\nI think Carmit looks like a weird big monster from outer space, and I find her gorgeous. I think she could actually be more important than you'd imagine. She could be as pivotal for her group as Nicola and Ringo have been for theirs.\n\nI didn't follow Pop Stars: The Rivals, but when the groups were decided I caught a quick rerun of that process on TV. I thought the girl group looked OK, and when Nicola was picked I just had to smile. Her relief was so sweet - and I think that that was actually the moment I became a fan of the group. It just felt so right and compelling. There's no doubt that she's not as cutesy beautiful as the four others, but she's got the right dignity, the right style, the right warmth, the right niceness.\n\nAnd I think this is true for Ringo and Carmit too. Ringo is hardly the best musician in the world, let alone the best vocalist, but he's got the right niceness. It's genuine, and reflective of the music. And it anchored the stratospheric success of that group to the ground, which was helpful too. I know less about Carmit, obviously, but at least she's got those vibes about her. That feel-good factor.\n\nI think there's some weight in the well known theory, 'The Gary Barlow Effect' (otherwise known as; \"Every pop group needs an ugly one\")\n\nMaybe it's members like Carmit, Mutya and Nicola Roberts that make their groups successful.\n\nI'm not saying either are ugly, but in the public domain they have a 'perceived uglyness' which really is all that matters.\n\nI think in the case of Girls Aloud it has made all the difference. 5 stunners of Cheryl Tweedy proportion would have made the group too threatening.\n\nWith Take That, the ugly girls could aspire to be with Gary Barlow, and that (to them) didn't seem like too unrealistic an aspiration. And maybe girls similarly less confident in their appearance can look at a Nicola Roberts or Camit and realistically aspire to be like that popstar.\n\nAnyway, just a thought.\n\nIt can kinda be confirmed by noting that pop groups where every member is a stunner never seem to work. We have yet to see whether the new, hotter, Sugababes v.3 has 'worked', and look at V!\n\nI for one could never get involved with the 'music' of V becuase I couldn't help but be distracted by the fact that I wanted to have sex with every single one of them.\n\nBefore I start, this post is NOT from a moderators point of view, but my own personal opinion. I would never go and start deleting posts just because I didn't agree with them.\n\nI think a lot of you make valid points, and as usual I agree with some and not woth others. The original poster I think was commenting more on her age than her looks, and it kind of descended a little into slagging Carmit off. I know there's free speech on here and all (to a certain extent) but there are certain things I think we can do without on the board. Things like \"Javine is a slag\", or some of the comments made about Carmit I don't like, that's probably my own opinion, but I don't really like personal insults like that. It would be the same if someone started throwing personal insults around about another poster. If anyone's ever visited the Digital Spy messageboards, they'll know what I'm talking about. Some of the stuff said about Grace from Big Brother for example was shocking, even if she wasn't the nicest person ever.\n\nBy all means I think people should put their opinions across, however I think it should be done in a better fashion than just a personal insult.\n\nFeel free to disagree!"
