The Scar Free Foundation is focusing research into not just scarring issues for cleft lip/palate sufferers but also on a wider level, to find out why bodies scar the way they do and how scientists can fi nd a way of solving the problem entirely.” For Carmit, having a facial scar is a constant reminder of her birth defect.\n\n“No one should let scars and feeling different stop them from doing what they want in life. I truly believe that but I’m hoping science might lead us towards living in a scar-free world in my lifetime.” l Carmit Bachar is an ambassador for The Scar Free Foundation.
