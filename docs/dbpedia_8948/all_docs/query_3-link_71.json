        "text": "Why did Carmit Bachar quit the Pussycat Dolls?\n\nThe reason that Carmit Bachar quit the Pussycat Dolls was because she says she wished to \"pursue other things\". It was really because of Nicole's control, she was one of the main vocalists, including Melody Thorton, Nicole Scherzinger, and her, Carmit Bachar. Nicole is noww singing every single not of every single song on the Doll Domination album. She even told them in the photo shoot that she was the only one who could wear a popping color top so the others got the chance to have their intitals on the motor cycles in the shoot. Nicole is only there to pursue her fame and try to make herself the star since she has her failed album still yet to be released. Carmit is the only member of the group who was there as long as Robin Antin. Carmit wanted a chance to sing on a track, but they wouldn't let her since Nicole is the favorite, which, personally, is not true because Ashley Roberts and Melody Thorton can sing mountains around her if they had the chance to sing. If you look up their live concert on YouTube, they all sing solo songs. Jessica Sutta and Melody Thorto and trained vocalists and are the on the verge of quittingand Ashley Roberts is going to if they don't change some things around like letting them all sing. They all have singles written and I personally believe that Ashley Roberts, Melody Thorton, and Jessica Suta are the best singers and Nicole is decent. Kimberly Watts only did that relaity show for exposure because she was on the verge of quitting as well. They're contracts aren't neogitable since any member can quit when they want- and get fired. They get no percent of records sells, ticket sells, and no percent of products introduced by them. Carmit had enough and is tired of not getting paid what she and the other 4 dolls (Melody, Ashley, Kimberly, and Jessica) deserve. Nicole gets paid more than all of them, and she even tried to change the name of the Pussycat Dolls to Nicole and the Pussycat Dolls. If the label doesn't shapen up, all but Nicole will leave."
