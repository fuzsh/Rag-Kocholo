        "text": "Carmit Bachar - artist, performer, television personality, and philanthropist - is best known as the only original member of multi-platinum and Grammy-nominated recording group The Pussycat Dolls (Interscope/A&M Records). As one of the three main vocalists in the burlesque-inspired girl group along with Nicole Scherzinger and Melody Thornton, this distinctive red-haired beauty with the sultry voice rose to international fame as an overnight pop sensation with The Pussycat Dolls' chart-topping hit singles including \"Don't Cha,\" \"Buttons,\" and \"StickWitU.\" Their debut album PCD (2005) sold almost 7 million albums and spawned a phenomenon that dominated the teen market and beyond, including PCD clothing, the interactive PCD Music Lounge, and The Pussycat Dolls Lounge in Las Vegas at Caesar's Palace. Carmit was also featured with the Dolls in several episodes of The CW's hit reality show \"The Pussycat Dolls Present: The Search for the Next Doll\" and in campaigns for Cingular Wireless and the 2007 NBA season.\n\nAs a founding member of the original Pussycat Dolls cabaret show, which began in Los Angeles' famed club venues The Viper Room and The Roxy, Carmit performed as a singer and dancer alongside many guest stars including Carmen Electra, Charlize Theron, Paris Hilton, Christina Aguilera, Nikka Costa, Pamela Anderson, and Gwen Stefani. Carmit graced covers of Maxim Magazine, Interview Magazine, and Blender Magazine. She also appeared with the original group in numerous film and television projects including Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, NBC's Las Vegas, Jimmy Kimmel Live, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Late Show with David Letterman, and Last Call with Carson Daly. Prior to the release of The Pussycat Dolls first album, Carmit also worked as one of the top professional dancers and choreographers in the business and gained attention touring with Ricky Martin as the \"La Vida Loca girl.\"\n\nCarmit, born and raised in Los Angeles, is of Israeli, Dutch, Indonesian, and Chinese descent and comes from a family of entertainers. She competed internationally as a rhythmic gymnast for 10 years, and placed 5th in the Olympic trials in 1992. During her career competing on the National Team, she attended Los Angeles' renowned performing arts high school Hamilton Academy of Music, excelling in her training in music, dance, piano and viola.\n\nCarmit's creativity and passion for dance, music, performing and true artistry led her to another venture in 2001 that she co-founded called \"The Zodiac Show,\" which began as an underground live performance event. Carmit has hosted, performed in and co-produced this refreshingly unique event for six years at some of Hollywood's biggest venues, gaining the respect and admiration of many celebrities and creatives in the entertainment industry.\n\nAn avid philanthropist, Carmit is a Smile Ambassador for Operation Smile and is active with her own charity \"Smile With Me\" for the benefit of Operation Smile. Carmit was also named one of FHM's Top 100 Sexiest Women in the World for 2008."
