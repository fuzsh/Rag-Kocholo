        "text": "Born Keana Alexis Texeira in California. Keana is the oldest of five children and resides in Los Angeles, CA. Signed to Warner Music Japan, Keana released her debut single \"Could You Be The One\" in March 2010 in Japan, which quickly climbed to #1 beating out Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Avril Lavigne, and Ke$ha. Creating media frenzy during her visit to Japan, Keana was featured in numerous prime time Japanese TV shows, major newspapers, and magazines. News of her success quickly traveled to the USA and was also widely featured amongst US press/media. She released a 2nd single, \"Need to Know\" in May, which quickly rose to #1 on the Japanese charts and iTunes, and most recently launched her 3rd single \"Lucky Color\" in August, which also climbed to #1 its first week. Her debut album, \"Still in a Dream\" was released September 22nd, 2 days before her Sweet 16. In a few short months, Keana became the youngest, most downloaded international artist in Japan for 2010.\n\nKeana is working on her new original music with award-winning producer Andrew Lane (High School Musical, Backstreet Boys, Ciara, Tony Braxton) who produced her first singles, \"Butterflies\", \"Daredevil\", and \"Could You Be the One\" for her Japan album. She is excited to reveal her world and her new material, including the shocking pop gothic tribute \"Next New You\", the up-tempo song \"Train Wreck\", the suspenseful \"Scream Queen\".\n\nThis young actress has worked with a number of the industry's biggest stars in a variety of diverse and challenging roles. She won rave reviews and a Critics Choice Movie Award nomination for her powerful work on the feature film, Brothers (2009), opposite Tobey Maguire, Natalie Portman and Jake Gyllenhaal. She played the young \"Betty Ann Waters\" in Fox Searchlight's Betty Anne Waters (2010), with Hilary Swank and Minnie Driver.\n\nMost recently, Bailee had a starring role in producer Guillermo del Toro's thriller, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010), with Katie Holmes and Guy Pearce, Bailee was recommended for the role by her Brothers (2009) co-star, Natalie Portman. She played a withdrawn child being haunted by insatiable demons; the film was released in August 2011. Bailee starred as the daughter of Marisa Tomei and the granddaughter of Bette Midler and Billy Crystal in the film Die Bestimmer - Kinder haften für ihre Eltern (2012), a co-production between 20th Century Fox and Walden Media.\n\nIn 2011, Variety named Bailee an honoree for her philanthropic efforts with \"Alex's Lemonade Stand\" at the \"Variety Power Of Youth Awards\", which pays homage to the industry's most talented young activists. A driven and talented young actress, Bailee is equally committed to using her public profile to raise awareness for those less fortunate. Between filming major motion pictures, Bailee has been devoting her time and energy to \"Alex's Lemonade Stand\", an organization that encourages children, nationwide, to raise money to find a cure for childhood cancer through running their own lemonade stands.\n\nHer other feature films include Letters to God (2010) and Hallmark's A Taste of Romance (2011) with Teri Polo. For her role in Columbia Pictures' comedy, Meine erfundene Frau (2011), with Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston, Bailee earned rave reviews with \"The Wall Street Journal\".\n\nBailee captured audiences hearts with her role of \"May Belle Aarons\" in Disney's Brücke nach Terabithia (2007), and has left lasting impressions with her performances in the independent film, Phoebe in Wonderland (2008) (starring Felicity Huffman and Elle Fanning), and on television in NBC's Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999). She appears as \"Maxine Russo\" in Disney Channel's Die Zauberer vom Waverly Place (2007), for its fourth and final season. When Bailee isn't working or studying, she loves cooking with her family.\n\nWhen Bailee's not traveling, she loves spending time at home with family and friends, barbecuing, swimming, and playing on her swing set. Of course her dog, Maddy, is always by her side.\n\nSandra Annette Bullock was born in Arlington, a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C. Her mother, Helga Bullock (née Helga Mathilde Meyer), was a German opera singer. Her father, John W. Bullock, was an American voice teacher, who was born in Alabama, of German descent. Sandra grew up on the road with her parents and younger sister, chef Gesine Bullock-Prado, and spent much of her childhood in Nuremberg, Germany. She often performed in the children's chorus of whatever production her mother was in. That singing talent later came in handy for her role as an aspiring country singer in The Thing called Love - Die Entscheidung fürs Leben (1993). Her family moved back to the Washington area when she was adolescent. She later enrolled in East Carolina University in North Carolina, where she studied acting. Shortly afterward she moved to New York to pursue a career on the stage. This led to acting in television programs and then feature films. She gave memorable performances in Demolition Man (1993) and Walter & Frank - Ein schräges Paar (1993), but did not achieve the stardom that seemed inevitable for her until her work in the smash hit Speed (1994). She now ranks as one of the most popular actresses in Hollywood. For her role in Blind Side - Die große Chance (2009) she won the Oscar, and her blockbusters Selbst ist die Braut (2009), Taffe Mädels (2013) and Gravity (2013) made her a bankable star. With $56,000,000, she was listed in the Guinness Book Of World Records as the highest-paid actress in the world.\n\nMiranda Taylor Cosgrove was born May 14, 1993 in Los Angeles, California, to Christina (Casey) and Tom Cosgrove, who owns a dry-cleaning business. She was discovered at a young age singing and dancing around a table in a restaurant, where an agent saw her talent and quickly signed her. Miranda's career started with commercials for Burger King, McDonalds and more as she auditioned for many roles and finally won her first role as the band's manager in the movie, School of Rock (2003).\n\nWhile filming School of Rock (2003) in New York, she was informed that her pilot Drake & Josh (2004) had been picked up. She co-starred as Drake and Josh's little sister, while making brief appearances on other Nickelodeon shows, before landing in her own show for the network, iCarly (2007). Her iCarly (2007) popularity helped her launch a singing career, and she was named an MTV Pop Rookie for 2009. Her debut album, \"Sparks Fly\", was released in 2010 and reached #8 on the Billboard 200 chart, along with two EPs: \"About You Now\" in 2009, and \"High Maintenance\" in 2011.\n\nWhile continuing her singing career, Miranda has expanded upon her voice-over work for the children's movies, including Here Comes Peter Cottontail: The Movie (2005), and the Ich - Einfach unverbesserlich (2010) films and related shorts, as well as expanding her film work with Deine, meine & unsere (2005), Keeping Up with the Steins (2006) and Das Geheimnis des wilden Mustangs (2009). Her TV reach has extended beyond Nickelodeon, with an appearance on the CBS legal drama Good Wife (2009) during the show's second season. She has served as a spokesperson for Neutrogena skin care products since 2010.\n\nShe lives in Los Angeles with her family.\n\nMiley Ray Cyrus was born Destiny Hope Cyrus on November 23, 1992 in Franklin, Tennessee and raised in Thompson's Station, Tennessee to Tish Cyrus & Billy Ray Cyrus. She has five siblings - two half-brothers, a half-sister, and a younger brother and sister. Her parents named her because they hoped she would achieve greatness. Her childhood nickname, Smiley, due to her cheerful disposition, was eventually shortened to Miley. Her paternal grandfather was Democratic politician Ron Cyrus.\n\nCyrus was initially educated at Heritage Elementary School in Tennessee. When she turned eight, her family moved to Toronto, Canada, where Cyrus' father Billy Ray took a role in the TV series Doc (2001). It was around this time that Cyrus decided she wanted to act too. Her first role came alongside her father in Doc (2001). She also scored a small role in Tim Burton's Big Fish - Der Zauber, der ein Leben zur Legende macht (2003).\n\nIn 2005, Cyrus was cast as the lead in the Disney series Hannah Montana (2006), about a teen leading a double life as a pop star. Again her father acted alongside her. The show was a smash and hit records, sell-out tours and merchandising deals soon followed. Cyrus became a teen superstar.\n\nFollowing the success of Hannah Montana (2006), Cyrus made the move into other roles - including playing Ronnie Miller in Mit Dir an meiner Seite (2010) and Lola in LOL - Laughing Out Loud (2012) alongside Demi Moore.\n\nA tall, strikingly attractive blue-eyed natural blonde, Cameron Diaz was born in 1972 in San Diego, the daughter of a Cuban-American father and an Anglo-German mother. Self described as \"adventurous, independent and a tough kid,\" Cameron left home at 16 and for the next 5 years lived in such varied locales as Japan, Australia, Mexico, Morocco, and Paris. Returning to California at the age of 21, she was working as a model when she auditioned for a big part in Die Maske (1994). To her amazement and despite having no previous acting experience, she was cast as the female lead in the film opposite Jim Carrey. Over the next 3 years, she honed her acting skills in such low budget independent films as Last Supper - Die Henkersmahlzeit (1995); Minnesota (1996); and Kopf über Wasser (1996). She returned to main stream films in Die Hochzeit meines besten Freundes (1997), in which she held her own against veteran actress Julia Roberts. She earned full fledged star status in 1998 for her performance in the box office smash Verrückt nach Mary (1998). With her name near the top on virtually every list of Hollyood's sexiest actresses, and firmly established as one of filmdom's hottest properties and most sought after actresses, Cameron Diaz appears to possess everything necessary to become one of the super stars of the new century.\n\nHannah Dakota Fanning was born on the 23rd of February 1994, in Conyers, Georgia, USA, to Heather Joy (Arrington) and Steven Fanning. Her mother played professional tennis, and her father, now an electronics salesman, played minor league baseball. She is of German, Irish, English, French, and Channel Islander descent. Before her debut into the cinematic world, Dakota did her own acting around her house. She was very active for her age, and often put a blanket under her shirt and pretended to be having a baby, using her younger sister, Elle Fanning, who is also an actress now, as the baby. Dakota went to a playhouse near her home, where the children that attended put on a play every week to show to their parents. But the people running the playhouse noticed that Dakota stood out, and advised her parents to take her to an agency. They believed that she was extremely talented.\n\nThe Fanning family were advised to spend six weeks in Los Angeles, a long way from their home in Georgia. But there Dakota managed to get her first work; to star in a national Tide commercial. She was chosen out of many, many other children.\n\nThe family then decided to move to Los Angeles permanently, for it looked like Dakota's career was looking very good. After they moved, Dakota signed with a professional agency, and soon won a role in the movie Tomcats (2001). She then went onto a small project called Father Xmas (2001) as Clairee.\n\nBut Dakota's big break-through was yet to come. She auditioned for one of the main characters in Ich bin Sam (2001), and the director and the rest of the crew were amazed by her extraordinary talent. Dakota was cast, and starred in the movie as Lucy Diamond Dawson, alongside major Hollywood stars Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\nAfter Ich bin Sam (2001) her talent was immediately recognized around the world. She went straight onto 24 Stunden Angst (2002) as Abby Jennings, alongside Charlize Theron, then played the younger version of Reese Witherspoon in 2002's Sweet Home Alabama - Liebe auf Umwegen (2002) But Dakota still had two more movies to come in 2002. Firstly she got a huge role in Steven Spielberg's Taken (2002), the mini-TV series, and narrated the ten whole episodes, as well as having a part. This was a little more challenging, as she was playing a troubled alien child, but she managed to do brilliantly. Her last movie for 2002 was the children's movie Hansel & Gretel (2002) as Katie.\n\n2003 was also a brilliant year for Dakota, as she starred in a number of exciting projects. Firstly, it was as Sally Walden in Ein Kater macht Theater (2003) with Mike Myers, then she played Lorraine \"Ray\" Schleine, a bratty little girl, in the sweet comedy Uptown Girls - Eine Zicke kommt selten allein (2003) alongside Brittany Murphy. She then voiced preschool Kim in Kim Possible: Mission zwischen den Zeiten (2003).\n\nIn 2004, Dakota appeared in the violent thriller, Mann unter Feuer (2004), alongside Denzel Washington. Her reviews were excellent.\n\nFirst in 2005 was Nine Lives (2005), as Maria, then the chilling Hide and Seek - Du kannst dich nicht verstecken (2005) alongside Robert De Niro. By now, she was the busiest child actress in Hollywood, with a resume to die for. Her younger sister, (Elle Fanning), had also been discovered a few years earlier.\n\nAfter Hide and Seek - Du kannst dich nicht verstecken (2005) came Krieg der Welten (2005), which was one of her major movies out of everything she'd worked in. Not only did it make her more popular, but she got to play the daughter of A-list Hollywood actor Tom Cruise. They had four very successful premieres; the first in Tokyo, Japan, the second in France, the third in London, England and the fourth in New York, USA. The reviews were outstanding, especially Dakota's. She then voiced Lilo in Lilo & Stitch 2 - Stitch völlig abgedreht (2005).\n\nActress and singer Selena Gomez was born on July 22, 1992 in Grand Prairie, Texas. She is the daughter of Mandy Teefey and Ricardo Gomez. Her mother is of part Italian ancestry, and her father is of Mexican descent. She was named after Tejano singer Selena, who died in 1995.\n\nHer first acting role was as \"Gianna\" in the popular '90s children's television show Barney & Freunde (1992), alongside Demi Lovato from 2002-2004. Gomez also had roles in Spy Kids 3: Game Over (2003), Walker, Texas Ranger: Feuertaufe (2005), and House Broken (2006).\n\nGomez moved to Los Angeles, California when she booked the lead role of \"Alex Russo\" and rose to fame in the Disney Channel series Die Zauberer vom Waverly Place (2007). She then starred in Another Cinderella Story (2008) on ABC Family, had her first voice-role in the animated film Horton hört ein Hu (2008), and co-starred with childhood friend, Demi Lovato, in Prinzessinnen Schutzprogramm (2009).\n\nIn 2009, Gomez released her first album with her band called \"Selena Gomez & the Scene,\" which ranked #9 on the Billboard 200 album charts. Gomez later released two other albums with her band and starred in Plötzlich Star (2011), Spring Breakers (2012), and Hotel Transsilvanien (2012).\n\nIn 2013, she released her first solo album \"Stars Dance\" and the lead single \"Come & Get It\" from the album, became Gomez's first top ten entry on the Billboard Hot 100 list. She starred in Getaway (2013), Rudderless (2014), and Behaving Badly: Brav sein war gestern (2014).\n\nIn 2015, she released her second solo album \"Revival,\" which debuted #1 on the Billboard 200 list, and starred in Hotel Transsilvanien 2 (2015), Umweg nach Hause (2016), Stürmische Ernte (2016), and Bad Neighbors 2 (2016). She made her third solo album \"Rare\" in 2020.\n\nAshley Michele Greene was born in Jacksonville, Florida to parents Michele (Tatum), an insurance broker, and Joseph Lacy Greene, US Marine who runs a concrete business. A self-confessed tomboy and \"daredevil\", Ashley loved to try to keep up with her older brother Joe, taking on activities such as taekwondo and winning several awards. Ashley says she was not allowed to spar the girls in taekwondo class because she \"beat the girls up\". She even accidentally once gave a boy she liked a bloody nose and lip while sparring. Ashley admits she is a \"competitive little sucker\".\n\nDuring her early teen years, Ashley found herself hanging out with older girls, which impacted her self-esteem when she found them to be more mature and, in her mind, prettier than she was. Ashley describes herself as a \"hot mess\" as a teenager. Ashley's mother put her into modeling classes to improve her confidence, and Ashley began to consider becoming a model as a career. After being told she was too short to be a model, Ashley considered becoming a lawyer and getting a degree in psychology. She actually convinced her parents to let her leave her private school to attend a public one which had a law and psychology program. However, after taking a commercial class, which led to acting class, Ashley knew what she wanted to do - acting.\n\nLuckily for Ashley, her parents were supportive and allowed her to move to LA at seventeen years of age. Due to her excellent grades and extra credits, she was able to graduate high school early to follow her acting dream.\n\nFor three years, Ashley struggled to find acting roles. She picked up small roles here and there in TV shows such as Punk'd (2003) and Crossing Jordan: Pathologin mit Profil (2001), and some very small film roles in Shrink - Nur nicht die Nerven verlieren (2009) and King of California (2007).\n\nAshley's big break came when she got to audition for the film, Twilight - Biss zum Morgengrauen (2008), based on Stephenie Meyer's popular book series. She originally auditioned for \"Bella\", but, as she says herself, \"I was no Bella\". She was called back to audition for the role of \"Alice Cullen\". After a long auditioning process, Ashley was finally told she got the part.\n\nAshley had previously worked in restaurants but, like the rest of her fellow \"Twilight\" cast-mates, Ashley found herself suddenly thrust into the limelight. Though she says she doesn't get the same kind of insanity as the boys - especially Robert Pattinson. She says most fans relate to her on a \"best friend\" level rather than screaming at her hysterically.\n\nAshley has already begun filming other roles and has high hopes for her career outside of the \"Twilight\" franchise. She has said she wants to be a superhero, a Bond girl and possibly Wonder Woman in future projects."
