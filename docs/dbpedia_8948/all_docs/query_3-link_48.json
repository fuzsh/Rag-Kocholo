        "text": "THE claws are out among the Pussycat Dolls again – after Carmit Bachar publicly blamed Nicole Sherzinger for vicious online trolling by her fans.\n\nNicole dressed as a golden warrior princess this week for a performance at the Atlantis Concert for Earth in Portugal.\n\nBut following the gig, ex-bandmate Carmit posted an open letter to her, claiming she was being targeted with “hateful” messages.\n\nAnd she told how some vile fans had posted abuse on her ten-year-old daughter’s page.\n\nCarmit wrote on Instagram: “Congrats on your recent performance @nicolescherzinger.\n\n\"Kindly requesting you communicate to the multiple Scherzy fans that are harassing and bullying my child by tagging her and writing hateful comments about me under her posts to please STOP immediately.\n\n“It is beyond disrespectful, dangerous and unbecoming.”\n\nThe open letter, which comes six months after the Dolls reunion was axed, seems to show that ­tensions between the girls are still alive and well.\n\nAnnounced in 2019, news of the US pop group’s comeback — featuring Nicole, Carmit, Jessica Sutta, Kimberly Wyatt and Ashley Roberts — thrilled their millions of fans.\n\nBut plans to tour the UK and Australia were hit by the Covid pandemic.\n\nAnd ­further trouble came with reports that Nicole was being sued by band founder Robin Antin for “refusing to participate.”\n\nIn January, frontwoman Nicole announced that the reunion tour would not go ahead.\n\nBut her revelation sparked a backlash from Carmit and Jessica, who only learned of the cancellation through social media.\n\nIn a joint statement in ­January, they wrote: “We want to say how incredibly disappointed we are to learn of an announcement made on Instagram that the Pussycat Dolls reunion tour is cancelled.\n\n“To the fans, we love you. This is not the outcome we had hoped for.”\n\nWhat a shame that some fans seem to be fuelling the feud between the Dolls they once backed.\n\nGaga gets the ball rolling\n\nLADY Gaga’s fans have had to wait two years for her Chromatica Ball tour, but there’s no doubt it was worth it.\n\nThe pop superstar exploded on to the stage at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium on Friday and the energy – and trademark outrageous costumes, inset left – never let up.\n\nKicking off with smash hits including Bad Romance, Just Dance and Poker Face, Gaga then plunged into her newer catalogue with tracks Chromatica, Alice and Replay.\n\nBabylon was dedicated to tragic Brit fashion designer Alexander McQueen.\n\nAnd while introducing 1,000 Doves, Gaga thanked the audience for inspiring the show – her most complex to date.\n\nShe told the crowd: “We made this show in the UK, did you know that? It was inspired by your love, your passion, your art, your fashion.\n\n“I want to dedicate this to anyone who struggles . . . with anything.”\n\nIn a further tribute to her army of fans – the Little Monsters – she added: “Thanks for being a weirdo like me. I’m not the only one – I’m not special.\n\n“There’s lots of weird motherf***ers like me.”\n\nThere are – and 60,000 of them were cheering her every word.\n\nCan't stand me meditating\n\nTHE Libertines have left their wild partying behind them.\n\nWe can reveal hell-raising Pete Doherty and Carl Barat prefer meditating with their bandmates backstage.\n\nA source said: “On their tour rider, they want a ‘quiet room’ filled with ­cushions, candles and incense sticks.”\n\nDuo Nova Wav – Brittany “Chi” Coney and Denisia “Blu June” Andrews – co-wrote half of the superstar’s new album Renaissance and they praised Bey’s down-to-earth nature.\n\nBrittany said: “Our favourite thing was to sit down with her as a person, see her as a human being, sit together as friends. Eat pizza, talk about how we shouldn’t be eating pizza.\n\n“She’s just a regular human being who wants greatness and she wants love for everybody.”\n\nDenisia added: “We went to her house in 2020 and I had been working out and shed like 40 pounds.\n\n\"As soon as I walked in, she said, ‘Oh my God, Blu, you are snatched!’\n\n“And I started laughing and she was like, ‘No, I’m serious, you look good.’ And that gave me so much confidence going into creating those songs.\n\n“I’m sure she gets compliments all the time, but to give them to someone else, it just meant a lot to me.”\n\nWe’re Bey-ond impressed . . .\n\nGeri's PR Firm AXE\n\nGERI Horner has parted ways with her long-term publicity firm, we can reveal.\n\nThe Spice Girl called time on her agreement with the Outside Organisation last week and brought in Premier Communications to look after her PR.\n\nA source said: “Geri felt it was time for a change, so she has parted ways with Outside.”\n\nThe shift in Geri’s camp comes as sources told how tensions have broken out among the Spice Girls over her refusal to commit to future tour dates.\n\nEmma Bunton, Mel C and Mel B have all voiced their hopes for a tour next year, with Geri the only member still holding back on the project.\n\nIt is understood Victoria may join the band for some gigs – but not the entire tour.\n\nThe source said: “There is a frustration among the other girls, who are keen to go ahead.”\n\nWe have our fingers crossed that this will still happen.\n\nBond Girl? Yas please\n\nDOCTOR Who actress Yasmin Finney, who is playing new sidekick Rose on the Beeb show, has pledged to be the first openly trans Bond girl.\n\nSpeaking at the Attitude Pride Awards, she said: “I would love to. I love James Bond, and every film I’ve seen I’ve always thought I would love to be that cool, sexy Bond girl.\n\n“A queer Bond girl would be amazing. I love Daniel Craig – he is incredible.”\n\nIf she lands the gig, Yasmin would be following in the footsteps of trans model Caroline Cossey, who appeared in 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only.\n\nWe think she’d slay."
