She is a former member of the pop groups The Pussycat Dolls (2003–2008) and LadyStation (2011–2016). As a dancer, she has been on tour with Beyoncé, Janet Jackson, Ricky Martin and No Doubt and in music videos for various artists, such as Michael Jackson, Jennifer Lopez, The Black Eyed Peas, The Offspring, Aaliyah and Beyoncé.\n\nIn 1993 Bachar began a successful career as dancer, appearing in television commercials and movie dance scenes, such as And the Band Played On (1993), North (1994) and Good Burger (1997). In 1995 choreographer Robin Antin asked Bachar to join her new project, The Pussycat Dolls, a burlesque dance troupe, with a repertoire of 1950s and 1960s popular music and dressed in pin-up costumes. In the following years, they performed live weekly at The Roxy Theatre, in West Hollywood, and were featured in magazines, specials for MTV and ad campaigns. During that time, she also participated on tours for Ricky Martin, No Doubt and Beyoncé, and danced in various music videos, such as Michael Jackson's \"Blood On The Dance Floor\", Jennifer Lopez's \"Ain't It Funny\", The Black Eyed Peas's \"Shut Up\", Aaliyah's \"Rock the Boat\" and Beyoncé's \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\".\n\nFollowing The Pussycat Dolls growing popularity, music producers Jimmy Iovine and Ron Fair became involved in 2003 to transform the dance troupe into a musical group. After some reformulations and tests with singers and dancers, the musical group was formed by Nicole Scherzinger, Melody Thornton, Ashley Roberts, Kimberly Wyatt, Jessica Sutta and Bachar – the only troupe member remained in the final lineup.[9] The group achieved worldwide success with the singles \"Don't Cha\", \"Buttons\" and Grammy Award–nominee \"Stickwitu\", and their multi-platinum debut album PCD (2005). Despite their commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict due to the emphasis on Scherzinger and the subordinate treatment of the other members, causing Bachar's departure from the group in March 2008.\n\nIn 2008, Bachar said that she was recording her debut solo album. On her MySpace, she uploaded two solo songs: \"Overrated\" and \"Carmasutra\". In 2009, Bachar announced that her album would be called Formerly Of... and would be released that year. The album was being produced by Grammy Awards–winner Jared Lee Gosselin and would feature songs like “Cupid”, “Love Is a Weapon”, “Me” and “Cream”. Despite this, Bachar failed to sign a record deal and the album was cancelled. Two unreleased songs, \"Fierce\" and \"Cream\", were reused on rapper Detroit Diamond's 2010 EP, with Bachar featured on three songs. In 2011 Bachar formed the electropop duo LadyStation, along with DJ Sammy J (Samantha Powell), and they released their debut single, \"Body in Motion\".\n\nIn the following years, they released other singles, such as \"Loud\", \"Motivation\" and \"Nurse U Back to Life\", and performed live at electronic music festivals and nightclubs. LadyStation's last release before disbanding in 2016 was the EP Voices on June 1, 2015. On February 24, 2017, Bachar release her debut solo single, \"It's Time\", as an independent artist. On April 18, 2018 she released her second single \"How Far\".\n\nOn November 29, 2019, The Pussycat Dolls confirmed their comeback and, on February 7, 2020, they released a new single, \"React\", with a live performance on the finale of The X Factor: Celebrity. They announced a 36-date world tour, but plans were canceled due the worsening situation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the group ended the reunion in 2021. On May 27, 2021 she released her third single, \"Questions\".\n============\nnet worth 2023,carmit bachar,tia mowry net worth 2023,brandon davis net worth 2023,tia mowry's lifestyle & net worth 2023,net worth,kimberly wyatt net worth,richest actors in the world 2023,richest actress in the world 2023,richest actresses in the world 2023,carmit,bachar,corey harrison net worth,sharrell's world net worth,met gala 2023,celebrity net worth,top 10 richest actresses in the world stats 2023,halle bailey net worth,frank fritz 2023\n============",
