        "text": "Post by 4Ms on\n\natop.proboards.com/post/4000/thread\n\nWhat's the big deal about Adam Lambert?\n\natop.proboards.com/post/4000/thread\n\nActually, Adam has many fine qualities. Adam is intelligent, eloquent, thoughtful, compassionate, generous and, well, you get the idea. He is, also, extraordinarily good looking and sexy as hell.\n\nMost of his fans wouldn't know that about him, though, if they hadn't fallen in love with The Voice*, first.\n\n*NBC totally stole this title for a singing competition program. ;D\n\nCassie's Vocal Masterclass* Threads:\n\nUp and Running!\n\natop.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=vocal&action=display&thread=28\n\nWhat note????\n\natop.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=vocal&action=display&thread=426\n\nOur resident vocal expert, cassie*, offered these examples in answer to the question above and for Juneau and Xena's radio program:\n\nA Beginner's Guide to Adam Lambert\n\n1. Come to Me, Bend to Me - Brigadoon (Live)\n\nThe voice is pure heaven, the technique flawless, the emotion palpable, and the instrumentation sparse so the voice is front and center. 200% proof of the extraordinary voice.\n\n2. Whole Lotta Love - Fantasy Springs Concert.\n\nNeed I say why?\n\n3. Feeling Good - American Idol (Live)\n\nLive or studio.\n\nRecognized by many vocalists to be one of his best. Shows range, diversity, power, interpretation, technique.\n\n4. Can’t Let You Go - FYE Album (Studio) — big rock song with insane technique.\n\nDon’t know another singer out there who can sing that high and powerfully while singing actual WORDS. The few who can hit those notes do it with an open vowel sound, but can’t articulate lyrics. Also shows range of emotion from beginning to end.\n\n5. My Conviction - Hair (Live)\n\nFor the “Shit! That can’t be Adam Lambert, can it???” factor.\n\n6. Ring of Fire - American Idol (Live)\n\nFor originality of arrangement, turning a song on its head, blowing our minds and also, again, the technique behind it is extraordinary. Who sings like that? Very difficult to execute.\n\n7. Heaven on their Minds - Broadway Unplugged (Live)\n\nRated by the rock guys at DDD as his best live performance.\n\n(This video has the audio turned up.)\n\n8. Mad World - American Idol (Live)\n\nIdol live or studio. It’s the one he was most known for on the show, and the one that won him many new fans.\n\n9. Soaked - Atlanta Concert (Live)\n\nSoaked - Nashville Concert (Live)\n\nLive acoustic. Often cited as having almost operatic vocals. Dynamic range great. Great emotional content.\n\n10. Sleepwalker - Tonight Show With Jay Leno (Live)\n\nLeno, or possibly Brisbane, which many fans consider the best version from his (GNT) tour.\n\nFierce. Wide range. Great emotional range.\n\nMy Note: I found Leno!!!\n\nNow on to the business of this thread!\n\nPost by 4Ms on\n\nQuick List of YouTube Links to Performances Part 1\n\n(All songs are listed, YouTubes available only for those in blue.)\n\nChildren's Theatre Network (CTN)/\n\nMetropolitan Educational Theatre (MET2)\n\n1991\n\nYou're A Good Man Charlie Brown\n\nLinus\n\nAnnie\n\n1992\n\nPeter Pan\n\nThe Fiddler On The Roof\n\nRussian\n\nMotel Kamzoil, the tailor\n\n1994\n\nBig River\n\nHuck Finn\n\n1996\n\nJoseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\n\nJoseph\n\n1997\n\nThe Wizard Of OZ\n\nCowardly Lion\n\nScarecrow\n\n1998\n\nThe Secret Garden\n\nDickon/Uncle Archie (both male leads)\n\n1999\n\nPeter Pan\n\nPeter\n\n*No Date\n\nBeauty and the Beast\n\nEllipsis\n\nMount Carmel High School Performances\n\nMusicals\n\nSpring 1997\n\nThe King and I\n\nSpring 1999\n\nThe Secret Garden\n\nUncle Archibald\n\nSpring 2000\n\nThe Pirates of Penzance\n\n(Gilbert and Sullivan - Comic Opera)\n\nFrederic\n\nNon-Musicals\n\nFall 1997\n\nSophomore Year.\n\nThe Crucible by Arthur Miller\n\nWillard - the marshal\n\nFall 1998\n\nJunior Year\n\nThe Matchmaker by Thornton Wilder\n\n(the non-musical inspiration for “Hello, Dolly!”)\n\nHorace Vandergelder\n\nFall 1999\n\nSenior Year\n\nA Midsummer Night’s Dream\n\nNick Bottom\n\nOther MCHS\n\n!999\n\nJazz Singers Ensemble\n\nBlue Moon\n\nMarch 18, 2000\n\nMCHS Airbands 2000 Competition\n\nLead Dancer - War\n\nEarly April 2000\n\nMCHS Classical Vocal Ensemble\n\nSpotlight Awards Finalist - Solo Performance\n\nDorothy Chandler Pavilion\n\nLincoln Center\n\nNew York NY\n\nJune 2000\n\nMCHS Graduation\n\nIt's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday\n\nStarlight Theatre (Bowl)\n\nSan Diego Civic Light Opera Association\n\nBalboa Park\n\nSan Diego CA\n\n1998\n\n(semi-pro)\n\nHello, Dolly!\n\nEnsemble\n\nCamelot\n\nEnsemble\n\nMoonlight Stage Productions\n\nMoonlight Amphitheater\n\nVista CA\n\n1999\n\nChess\n\nFrederick HeWhoCannot ameder\n\nPity the Child.\n\nSummer 2000\n\nBroadway at the Moonlight Gala\n\nSwingtime G.I.
