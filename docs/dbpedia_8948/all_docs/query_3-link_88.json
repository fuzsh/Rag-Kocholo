        "text": "Nicole Scherzinger is opening up about the unique dynamic of the Pussycat Dolls.\n\nThe 45-year-old singer and stage star got candid in a new interview with People about her time in the “Don’t Cha” girl group, and admitted that it was mostly her vocals on the songs released by herself and bandmates Kimberly Wyatt, Melody Thornton, Jessica Sutta, Ashley Roberts and Carmit Bachar.\n\nKeep reading to find out more…\n\n“Our group was never set up like the Spice Girls,” she said.\n\n“Our group was set up where I would be the quarterback, and I would lead us. The girls are extremely strong, talented dancers, and I had to work hard to be able to stand next to them.”\n\nShe went on to say that she recorded the majority of the vocals on the albums.\n\n“I always used to be made to feel like…I don’t know, not ashamed, but…I’m very proud that the albums are my music. I put the work in after all these years, and that’s OK that I have the credit because everybody has their own strengths. And this is what I bring to the table,” she says.\n\n“Those were world-class pop records that had many No. 1s around the world. And I love my girls, and I’ll always have love for them — I only wish them the best.”\n\nAfter they reunited in 2020 and released “React” with plans for a tour, it was later scrapped amid a lawsuit between Nicole and the group’s founder Robin Antin."
