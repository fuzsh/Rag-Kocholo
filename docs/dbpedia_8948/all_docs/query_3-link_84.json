        "text": "THE PUSSYCAT Dolls were an iconic girl group in the early 2000s that released hits like When I Grow Up, Buttons, and Don't Cha.\n\nThe group was made up of members Nicole Scherzinger, Kimberly Wyatt, Ashley Roberts, Carmit Bachar, Melody Thornton, and Jessica Sutta, and now fans want to know what they're up to now.\n\nWhere are the Pussycat Dolls now?\n\nThe Pussycat Dolls started as a burlesque troupe but by the early 2000s had formed a powerhouse girl group.\n\nIt was initially formed by actress, entrepreneur, singer, dancer, choreographer, and clothing designer Robin Antin who also created the girl groups G.R.L., Girlicious, and Paradiso Girls.\n\nHere's a look at where the members are now:\n\nNicole Scherzinger\n\nArguably one of the most famous Pussycat Dolls is Nicole Scherzinger.\n\nAfter the group broke up in 2010, she launched a successful solo career and went on to work with the likes of Sean Combs, Will.i.am, Snoop Dogg, T.I., and more.\n\nShe also served as a judge on several competition shows, including The Sing-Off, The X Factor US, The X Factor UK, and Australia's Got Talent.\n\nSince 2020, she has been in a relationship with Thom Evans.\n\nKimberly Wyatt\n\nAlong with serving as a singer in the band, Kimberly Wyatt was also as a choreographer of the Pussycat Dolls.\n\nAfter leaving the group, she went on to serve as a judge on Sky One's show Got To Dance.\n\nShe also competed and won Celebrity MasterChef in 2015 and was a member of the dance duo Her Majesty & the Wolves.\n\nSince 2014, she has been married to model Max Rogers. The pair share three kids, Willow, Maple, and Ford.\n\nAshley Roberts\n\nAshley Roberts was famous before the Pussycat Dolls, but it was her association with the group that put her on the map.\n\nAfter leaving the band, she competed on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! in 2012 and finished second behind actress Charlie Brooks.\n\nTwo years later, she released her debut solo album Butterfly Effect.\n\nCarmit Bachar\n\nCarmit Bachar left the band in 2008 to try and launch a solo career, but it was not until 2017 that she released her first official single.\n\nNowadays, she can often be found posting about her life on Instagram.\n\nShe is married to long-time boyfriend Kevin Whitaker and has one child.\n\nJessica Sutta\n\nLike Bachar, Jessica Sutta also wanted to leave the band to launch a solo career.\n\nShe previously told Life and Style magazine that she felt like \"nothing more than a backup dancer in seven years.\"\n\n\"I basically felt like nothing more than a glorified back-up dancer after seven years with the group,\" she told the outlet, via heart.co.uk.\n\n\"I wasn't feeling like I was growing in the situation. It was something I had to do. Breaking my rib is what sent me over the edge.\"\n\nAfter leaving, she proved she could make it on her own by releasing the single Show Me, which reached number one on the Billboard Dance Club Songs Chart.\n\nIn 2017, she then released her debut solo album I Say Yes.\n\nSince 2019, she has been married to Mikey Marquart. They now reside in Monte Nido, California, with their baby boy Michael Jesse \"MJ\" Marquart.\n\nMelody Thornton\n\nMelody Thornton was one of the youngest members of the Pussycat Dolls, having joined shortly after graduating high school.\n\nShe ultimately left the band to work on solo music and has since been seen competing on the reality shows Popstar to Operastar, Dancing on Ice, and the Australian version of The Masked Singer, which she won in 2022.\n\nAre the Pussycat Dolls doing a reunion tour?\n\nAfter disbanding in 2010, most fans gave up hope that the group would get back together.\n\nHowever, they reunited 10 years later and announced a reunion tour.\n\nSadly, the tour was ultimately canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Thank you to everyone who had tickets to see PCD- were are so appreciative of your support and loyalty,\" Scherzinger wrote in a statement at the time.\n\n\"With the ever-evolving circumstances surrounding the pandemic, I understand the decision that the tour dates had to be canceled.\n\n\"I have invested a huge amount of time, creative energy, and my own finances into bringing this project back to life.\n\n\"And while I'm naturally incredibly saddened by this decision, I am also very proud of what we were able to achieve in the short amount of time we had together before COVID.\n\n\"I can't put into words the amount of love, admiration, and gratitude I have for the other girls in the group and the fans that have supported us.\n\n\"Stay safe and healthy – love and blessings. Nicole xo.\""
