        "text": "BUFF FILM FEST\n\nphoto courtesy of David J Bevan.\n\nOver 1000 people attended the BUFF FILM festival, (sponsored by Jilali Argan Oil UK) over 4 days at Channel 4, Odeon West End, Oxford House (Bethnal Green) and Genesis Cinema. Actress Zawe Ashton (‘Fresh Meat’ & ‘Dreams of a Life’) hosted the opening night gala in Leicester Square, which was also attended by actor Andre Royo (Bubbles from HBO’s ‘The Wire’) for the UK premiere of ‘Calloused Hands’ in which he stars and co-produced. Actress Anjela Lauren Smith (‘Babymother’) hosted the closing night UK premiere of ‘Bloody Lip’ – an award-winning mockumentary about boxing, from the Genesis Cinema in Whitechapel. Also in attendance during the festival was Cass Pennant (on whom the movie ‘Cass’ was based on), actor Nicholas Pinnock (Top Boy) and David Essex (musician and actor) whose movie ‘Traveller’ received its’ world premiere at BUFF in Whitechapel starring his son Billy Cook, Lois Winstone & Jason Maza. The festival is now in its 8th year and is currently in discussions with Channel 4 about a broadcast partnership in relation to its’ selection of short films from this year’s event.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the film The Fade, about men’s barbers across the world by documentary filmmaker, Andy Mundy-Castle. A doc about the culture of the barbershop, the male relationships forged via the intimacy of male hair care, the artistry it forges (not just on the scalps of the customers, but with the ambitions of the barbers too). Uniquely, Andy structured the doc to trace the route of the Transatlantic slave trade, so it features singular stories (with their narratives inter-cut) of barbers in Ghana, Jamaica, America and the UK. I loved that it included musicians among the clientele – Aidona, Elephant Man, Pharrell, Jay Sean, DJ Envy and Joe Budden. All give testimony about their relationships w/ their barbers, the importance (and competitive nature of male grooming) esp within the music industry.\n\nSTRICTLY COME LAUGHING\n\nComedy nights at Hackney Empire are in my heart, blood and funny bone! I’ve been attending them regularly for the past 2 decades! It’s a brilliantly consistent venue for urban comedy, and does well by engaging the local community, as well as a multi-cultured audience from far and wide. Last Sunday was one such event with a twist. A regular evening full of great urban comedians but in aid of a Ghanaian village which the strictly come laughing brand have been supporting for 10 years now!\n\nThe evening was like a BBC Red Nose Day show, hosted by the elder statesmen of comedy (they wont like me saying that!), Eddie Nestor & Robbie Gee, with comedians Slim, Axel, Glenda Jaxson, Richard Blackwood, A Dot, Kane Brown, Kat, Stephen K Amos and dame Baptiste. We also had musical performances by gospel Jermain Jackman, onstage set accompaniment music from DJ Abrantee, and a special guest appearance from Lenny Henry.\n\nI’ve watched many of these acts come up, and their development and stage confidence has grown leap and bounds. Even the younger acts content is now very distinct, and they are laying their own style and flava ground. I recall when Kane Brown first hit the scene; he was a nervous stilted comic, now he’s on fire! This 39 old comic had us roaring at his old skool vs new skool jokes where he compared crisps brands like Pringles vs Golden Wonder and cars with chokes! Former CHOICEFM and MTVBASE host Kat played a black Puck character in his green tights and red codpiece adding a pantomime silent clown character to the night.\n\nEastenders legend Rudolf Walker, talked about the Ghananian charity Friends of Tafo, which is a charity that aims to empower as well as help the people of Kwahu-Tafo, an impoverished rural town in Ghana, via responsible giving that generates a capacity for self-development in education, job-creation, and quality of life and infrastructure.\n\nThey work in close partnership with the community of Kwahu-Tafo to ensure that the projects chosen and the resources allocated reflect local needs and priorities.\n\nFriends of Tafo was founded in 2001 by the friends and family of TV Producer Humphrey Barclay, after his installation as Nkosuohene (Development Chief) in the ancestral home town of his friend, the late Ghanaian actor Gyearbuor Asante, who played the African eternal student ‘Matthew’ in the Channel 4 TV sitcom Desmond’s. Humphrey spends three periods of up to two months each in Tafo every year, working with the Progress Council and documenting progress.\n\nHumphrey along with his co-producers Beverley & Paulette Randall and Sarah Moore of GeeStor Productions have produced Strictly Come Laughing! (Formerly THe Empire Strikes Black) for the past 10 years and have to date raised over £100,000 for Friends Of Tafo.\n\nNext, comedy Newcomer south London’s Dame Baptiste sounded nervous for about 2 seconds, before getting into his groove and killing it, with his very new original style and content.\n\nComic Quincy is a big guy and bounded onstage with his longer than long locks. He had us roaring as he acknowledged that singer Jamelia had been stating publicly, that there should be more black faces on UK TV, and here she was, on a show called ‘’I love my country’’. He then extoled the power of Levi Roots brand now that there were Reggae Reggae crisps. He said ‘’we all know he just mixed ketchup and pepper to make his sauce and now he even has a crisp line’’ We were rolling!\n\nI bought a few raffle tickets, as the prizes were great! Amongst the things I could’ve won were tickets to the royal variety performance and x factor, but what I wanted were the Eurostar and 3 nights in Paris. I didn’t win, but Strictly Come Laughing did make a grand total of £ on the night. Great example of arts making the world a better place.\n\nLONDON’S BIGGEST BREAKFAST\n\nNEIL FOX, BORIS JOHNSON AND JUNIOR MASTERCHEF FINALIST TJ DOBSON\n\nI ended the week with a 7am breakfast at City Hall where Magic 105.4 and The Mayor’s Fund for London, were broadcasting live in aid of London’s Biggest Breakfast. Their aim was to raise awareness to expand the Breakfast Club project and feed thousands more school children across the City.\n\nMany children come to school too hungry to learn. Currently 1 in 4 school children only have one healthy meal a day (school lunch) and 32% regularly miss out on breakfast.\n\nIt’s a campaign that has seen Magic FM and the Mayors Fund come together to deliver 10,000 daily breakfasts to 50 primary schools across seven of London’s most deprived boroughs, feeding nearly 2000 children each morning! One headmistress at the event told me that families are so poor nowadays, that often the parents join their children, for this daily essential at her school.\n\nTransmitting live for the first time from the rooftop-London’s living room- were Magicfm DJ Neil fox. Joining Neil to perform live with his band was Westlife’s Shane who did a great job entertaining the 50 young school children from a nearby school.\n\nWESTLIFE’S SHANE SINGS FOR THE BIIGEST BREAKFAST.\n\nAlso in the house was TV Chef and London restaurateur Cyrus Todiwala– the very cool ‘’spice man’’, who told me he likes to cook a spicy breakfast like a chili omlette and had us taste one made by Barnet school boy – junior master chef finalist- 12 year old TJ Dobson. TJ’s mum told me it was his grandma that encouraged his passion for cooking at a young age when she allowed him and only him from their family to watch her make her secret BBQ sauce. TJ told me he loves making BBQ chicken with blue sauce and crème brulee!\n\nWESTLIFES SHANE, JASMINE, TJ DOBSON AND CELEB TV CHEF CYRUS TODIWALA.\n\nT J told me “I know that I and my twin sisters would find it really hard to concentrate at school if we didn’t have breakfast in the morning. All we’d hear is our tummies rumbling! I’m excited about giving the Mayor some good cooking tips too.”\n\nTJ DOBSON WIT HIS MUM, GRANDMA AND SIBLINGS.\n\nBoris Johnson told us: “It’s unacceptable that many of our young Londoners are going to school hungry. I hope that London’s Biggest Breakfast on 12th September will encourage more people to get involved so that this initiative can reach more children across the capital.”\n\nNeil Fox added “My three children always go off to school with a good breakfast inside them, but not all kids are so lucky. London’s Biggest Breakfast will help pave the way to healthier and happier children who are ready to learn at the start of their school day.”\n\nCyrus Todiwala OBE said” A nutritious breakfast is key to the well being of our minds and bodies and especially for school kids who need to start the day fit and ready to concentrate on their lessons. Not just parents but kids themselves have to learn the value of a good, balanced breakfast and it should become part of their cooking repertoire, cooking being an indispensible life skill. You don’t have to be a trained chef to prepare a nutritious breakfast. London’s Biggest Breakfast is a great initiative to support the healthy future of London’s young people.”\n\nThe positive impact of the Breakfast Clubs is clear with 93% of head teachers saying they result in increased concentration and energy amongst pupils. Lets ensure that our nations youth leave home daily with a healthy meal inside them. A happy tummy equals a smart functioning brain!\n\nJASMINE WITH SO SOLID CREW AT THE MOBO18 NOMINATIONS LAUNCH.\n\nMany businesses’ don’t last a decade, let alone 18 years, so salute and applaud the brand that is MOBO, who celebrate their 18th birthday this year!\n\nMOBO CEO KANYA KING WITH JESSIE J\n\nTheir annual nominations launch party this week at the Grand Connaught Rooms, was the best one ever in my humble opinion. Its true there have been launches in the past with more car crash celebs in attendance, but this year really upped the ante in all areas. The ballroom was set up like an awards show, with beautifully dressed tables. Each table had bottles of water, wine and champagne.\n\nGRAPHICS HEAD HONCHO TROY DAVIS, PHOTOGRAPHER PAUL H AND TALENT MANAGER/PHOTOGRAPHER RICHIE P ENJOY THE SWEETIE CORNER!\n\nIn each corner of the room was an exciting thing to engage with. In one corner, a sweetie station with old skool sweets like cola cubes and sherbet spaceships, in another, a giant group sized photo booth by the Phototainment Company which had the best instruction video with poses that had party goers shrieking in delight. Everyone passed through the Guest Stars photo booth and had their MOBO 18 pictures printed and tweeted throughout the night.\n\nCopious amounts of mini food platters like fish and chips and mini burgers and beverages galore were served on silver platters. I have been to every MOBO launch party and can tell you, the mainstream most certainly takes the scene more seriously now!\n\nA LADY THAT BROUGHT UP A GENERATION OF YOUNG TV VIEWERS ON PLAYSCHOOL- FLOELLA BENJAMIN!\n\nEverything about this years launch felt different. Media and celebs were scanned in using HTC One devices, which were also on display throughout the venue. The tables were well decorated with Table Art coloured pixels tubesThe glamorous set up, the stage running order which saw a gorgeous Sarah Jane Crawford from Radio1Xtra hosting, a speech by long time UK music manager Kwame Kwaten, an introduction by CEO Kanya King, a totally surprising performance by So Solid Crew which brought the house down, and a similarly great set by newer act Fuse ODG and Jahmene Douglas!.\n\nTHE FUSE ODG DANCERS BROUGHT THE HOUSE DOWN-THEIR HAIR WAS AS SLICK AS THEIR MOVES!\n\nThe vibe in the room felt VERY positive. Hilariously, this night always see’s people in attendance that slag off the MOBO brand all year round, but kill themselves to attend the evening. As Kwame mentioned in his speech, it can’t be everything to everyone at all times. The public vote dictates who wins.\n\nUP FOR BEST ALBUM- ANGEL!\n\nAs many a black music act from Jazzie B to Tina Turner, to Destiny’s Child and Fugees, reflected in their MOBO speeches many years ago- MOBO was the first brand to award them recognition, even after they’d been in the industry many years.\n\nFORMER KISS100FM RADIO HOST-NOW RADIO1XTRA- CLARA!\n\nMainstream brands like the Brits have years when urban music is in favour, and others where it isn’t, so we always need MOBO to be the stable brand that supports year in and year out.\n\nTHE MAN MAKING MOST OF THE CURRENT TEAMUK HITS- NAUGHTY BOY!\n\nPeople I spotted or caught up with in the house included a lady that brought up my generation-national treasure Floella Benjamin with her very handsome distinguished hubby, Sway, Fuse ODG whose dancers had us all mesmerised (we wanted dance classes with them!), Kanya King in a foxy red frock, Adam Deacon trying as usual to stay understated but being mobbed by fans wanting pictures.\n\nKOJO IN ‘THAT’ LEATHER LOOK VEST!\n\nAlso spotted- ChoiceFM breakfast show host Kojo in a leather look vest which I kept teasing him about, music industry legend Mervyn Lyn ( Puffy, Alicia Keys), Paul H- the only photographer to the UK urban scene, Paola Lucktung- the go-to-lady at Adidas, Kwame Kwaten- one time member of music act D’Influence, now music manager of acts like Laura Mvula, Taponeswa Mavunga from Atlantic Records, old skool singer Gabrielle who is being brought back with a fresh sound by Watford super producer Naughty Boy, Baby Blue looking sweet in her dress and having fun in the photo booth, Kel Le Roc looking as usual, red hot in a body con dress, Richie Pascoe- the only photographer favoured by young sexy chicks wanting foxy pics LOL, DJ Dave VJ, Radio1Xtra breakfast host Twin B, A&R Benny Scars, Island Music’s Darcus Beese and many more.\n\nA VERY MUSIC INDUSTRY CLIQUE- INCLUDING REMEL LONDON, TROY DAVIS, RICHIE P, DAVE VJ, PAUL H, COOKIE, LINDSEY WESKER.\n\nBackstage, I managed to have a nice catch up with So Solid boys Harvey and Romeo, where we discussed their current life situations and music news. Both seemed older, wiser, and more level-headed and very happy with their now, much more settled lifestyles. A touching moment was when we spotted Harvey welcoming new younger acts, and giving them tips and advice on his regrets in dealing with business. Lisa Maffia wasn’t in the house due to other business commitments so I attempted to make my pitch to fill in- alas, not sure if the boys took me seriously! So Solid really needs to be praised for their contribution to the UK urban music scene. They were the first act that really caught the nations youth up in excitement, and represented the British youth lifestyle and experience.\n\nADIDAS BIGWIG PAOLA LUCKTUNG AND RICHIE P WITH JASMINE.\n\nIt’s hard for some of you to imagine the climate of UK black music 18 years ago. Nowadays its normal to see acts like Tinie Tempeh, Wretch32, N Dubz and so on in the national tabloid press, invited onto mainstream TV shows and charting well in our music charts. 18 years ago this was practically unheard of unless you were Sade or the like. Acts back then just weren’t taken seriously by the mainstream or broadcasters playlists-thankfully we’ve proved them all wrong. Black music teams were uninspired by mainstream rejection, and many of us who worked in the industry, were determined to fight and make the change to see a genre that we loved make it big. MOBO is just one of these brands that fought to make the urban lifestyle scene today what it is, and for that we are applauding it!\n\nADIDAS VIP HIP HOP KARAOKE AT CONCRETE/ SHOREDITCH!- #unitealloriginals @adidasuk @adidasoriginals\n\nTHE BEST HIP HOP KARAOKE ACT OF THE NIGHT- ATHLETE JEANETTE KWAKYE WITH HER SONG PARTNER SINGER JACOB BANKS.\n\nThe very next day the industry was still abuzz as adidas dropped its new social soiree- hip-hop karaoke at the Concrete venue in Shoreditch. Adidas always pushes its social engagement both with the public and street corner pop up sports events, as well as industry engagement, with parties and fun. Usually I wont let go of the mic at karaoke but was feeling wary of this hip-hop karaoke as I usually sing (tine deaf kill an animal with my shrieking type attempts). But this time there were only rap songs on offer.\n\nJAS WITH PRINCESS NYAH!\n\nIn the house on the night were most of the London urban music industry from djs, to record label staff, to music bloggers,to PR, to Adidas associated athletes, to real rappers and stylish fashion folk. On arrival I wondered if it would be a success, as even though the venue was full, we- the cynical, cutting industry heads- were all apparently too shy to add names to the performers list.\n\nROLL DEEPS MANGA KICKED IT ALL OFF!\n\nHowever as soon as our DJ Target kicked the night off, with the gold jacketed, pretty eccentric hip-hop karaoke host, it was a non-stop rap fest. Manga from Roll Deep kick-started the sets and did really well, then a couple of younger dandy’s showed their skills, before rappers Wretch32 and J2K did their version of Kano’s P’S&Q’S to the crowds delight!\n\nWRETCH AND J2K DO KANO’S P’S & Q’S\n\nGorgeous young thing-the foxy Princess Nyah, jumped onstage to help with a version of So Solids 21 Seconds- no pressure but Romeo was also in the house!.\n\nNYAH HAS 21 SECONDS TO GO…….\n\nDJ MANNY NORTE JOINS J2K IN A DUET\n\nJEANETTE AND JACOB- STARS OF THE NIGHT!\n\nMy favourite moment of the night though was undoubtedly when athlete Jeannette Kwayke and singer Jacob Banks jumped onstage together for ‘Ni*&* in Paris’. The venue went wild and the high was non stop from there on in. everyone attending agreed that Adidas has to make this a regular event- its nice to see each other at awards and shows but having a function where no ones working and all are simply enjoying themselves is key to a successful music community! So two brands that I adore, made this fortnight a better place for all involved! kudos!\n\nTHE ADORABLE WRETCH CHILLING OUT AND HAVING FUN AT THE ADIDAS HIP HOP KARAOKE EVENT AT CONCRETE-SHOREDITCH!\n\nJAZZIE B AT KEW THE MUSIC 2013\n\nSo the last of the summer music festivals is approaching and I’ve done a few this year. I can honestly say the best in terms of new, fresh crowd, musical experience and overall enjoyment was Soul to Soul and Leona Lewis at Kew Gardens for the annual Kew the Music stage. Wireless used to be great, but alas has turned into a London version of the worst of Aiya Napa meets Ibiza, with cheap sleazy audience in a giant car park. Glastonbury see’s its usual die hard camping fans try and out fashion Kate and Cara.\n\nBut Kew Gardens was uniquely the new best-kept secret this year. Thousands of very classy people, bringing picnic blankets, candelabras and champagne, set in a stunning, natural venue with amazing acoustics. The event planning is extremely well organized, with great views from all across Kew Gardens. The stage is flanked by breath taking lakes and foliage whilst the food was in a league of its own. It’s the only festival I’ve ever attended that doesn’t sell chips! It does however, do copious amounts of pink bubbly, steak and roasted veg, gourmet burgers, falafel and posh coffees. Juxtapose that with Jazzie B and his crew and it’s the menu for an unforgettable night out. See you there next year!\n\nSo here we are, September 2013, the end of BBC Proms territory. Whilst the Royal Albert Hall in West London plays host to the biggest names in classical music, Channel 4 have begun airing Series 2 of Top Boy- their gritty drama about inner city street life.\n\nOn one side, press and pro social groups slam Top Boys violence and glamorization of gangs and drug culture. Critics call for a balance in programming.TV picks up formats that are brought to its attention. There ARE balanced stories out there, but not everyone knows where to find them, or how to tell them.\n\nTop Boys critics say ‘’why aren’t there any positive stories about the black community? Why are we only shown in a negative, criminal light? Well, there are positive, soaring stories; it’s just that commissioners and TV don’t seem as interested in them, or only want to perpetuate the stereotypes of what black music and culture’ is. (Stand up Miley Cyrus!).\n\nThere are thousands of young music lovers who appreciate classical music. Instead of a TV show that makes us all feel like the great BBC has charitably extended its hand and opened its doors to urban acts (FAZERS URBAN SYMPHANY), why not champion and highlight black role models who are leaders in their fields of work in classical music? Youth want to see leaders like Jay Z who are winning in their chosen fields. They don’t like charitable hands reaching down to help them. Tell them about winners in classical music so they too can aspire to be like them. This is the hip-hop generation – they are aspirational, they want to see winners.\n\nJASMINE WITH SHIRLEY THOMPSON\n\nWinners like Shirley Thompson who’s a rarity in this country: A black composer AND educator at the University of Westminster. Make a TV show and include people like Shirley instead of ‘’poor inner city youth who need to be lead to the classical music well to drink’’.\n\nShirley is warm, driven, approachable and ageless. She recalls being intoxicated with the sound of the piano from the age of 4 years old, in a little box room, in her Jamaican parents East London home. She recalls ‘’it was normal to have a piano in the home in those days. My mother did whatever she could to help us progress and develop as human beings. There was always soul, gospel and reggae music playing in our house, I saw classical music as the same, I came across classical music in TV and films. I loved pop music as a child, Sounds of Blackness and Marvin Gaye, Al Green, very classic soul voices. I was always into local music festivals. I started the violin at age 11, which is late in that world so always felt as if I were playing catch up, but my area-Newham- was musically creative back then as it is now with grime and classical talent’’.\n\nShirley left an extremely successful performing career to pass on her passion to younger students ‘’I’ve been teaching at Westminster Uni for 10 years-10 years ago recorded music was seen as the most important aspect of the music world instead of live performance. Nowadays its all about the live performance-its changed phenomenally. My students come from local state schools to public schools. A lot of them want to be singer songwriters and music producers in grime, classical, rock, hip-hop and indie’’.\n\nSHIRLEY THOMPSON MEETING THE QUEEN.\n\nA big moment for Shirley was in 2002 when she met the Queen after creating a symphony for her with a 200-piece orchestra. Then In 2007 Shirley was commissioned to compose music for the opening of the Parliamentary exhibition The British Slave Trade: Abolition, Parliament and People, which marked the 250-year anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic trade in enslaved African people. It’s of course an honour to be asked, but like many from the BAME community, Shirley has had to fight hard not to be pigeonholed by her skin colour. ‘’I resisted with institutions like the Arts Council who wanted to dub me a ‘’black composer’’, my culture has made me who I am but I don’t want to be pigeon holed and objected to that. Being Jamaican has given me that extra edge, my ancestors were very driven persistent people, so I love that, but I don’t want to be labelled like that’’\n\nIn 2010 Shirley was announced in the Evening Standard’s “Power List of Britain’s 100 Most Influential Black People 2010” ‘’it meant a lot to be acknowledged by the community and that classical music was being considered to be important in the community, I’d always struggled with being taken seriously in my community as they said classical music was a white persons game. I’m interested in finding a channel for my talent…the bible says that if you have been given a talent you must use it well’’\n\nRegards her future ambitions she smiles ‘’I’ve got lots of operas and orchestral works still to come, my symphonies for the Royal Albert Hall and more!’’\n\nSo there you have it TV commissioners. The stories exist. Do you have the teams and the balls to make them?\n\nHe’s going from deadlines to headlines. 28 year old Shahid Khan, is the tall, big built, chubby cheeked, infectiously excitable new #TEAMUK music star that goes by the stage name Naughty Boy.\n\nJASMINE WITH SHAHID KHAN, AKA NAUGHTY BOY!\n\nIn a quiet ground floor studio in the leafy suburb of Ealing, a young Asian man is making music history, and breaking cultural stereotypes simultaneously.\n\nIn a world where the biggest celebrities have always had big talent, coupled with a big personality- Naughty Boy is about to join the ranks of those grand players on the list.\n\nThe talent of frank Sinatra, Richard Branson, Kanye West and their ilk cannot be denied, but what takes them to transcend their specialist boundaries into household name forte, are their larger than life personalities. NB is very enthusiastic, likable and has a huge personality for a relative newcomer to the music industry.\n\nHe’s young, understatedly dressed and grounded but already showing serious signs, of Roc A Fella legend boss, Dame Dash style opulence that threatens to sweep him off his feet.\n\nOne of the first things that happen, as I am welcomed into the music-making den, is an ‘extremely important telephone call that NB has to take’ from his sister. He politely explains ‘’excuse me-this could be god news. I lost my diamond ring earlier today, at my mums in her bidet in the toilet, so my sister said she’d search for it’’\n\nTen seconds later he breathes a sigh of relief and reveals ‘‘that’s amazing, she found it, that’s saved me 10k’’. As I stare open mouthed, he attempts an explanation that still gob smacks me, ‘’I can’t wear gold so I waited until I could afford diamonds’’. That’s cleared that up then.\n\nNAUGHTY BOY MAKING THOSE HITS!\n\nDuring the 10k diamond ring call, I take it all in. his Ealing film studio based lair, a tiny all black studio, dark walls, sofas, totally cluttered with creativity. A multitude of sights hit you all simultaneously. A large colourful fish tank where previous piranha fish have been overfed leaving just goldfish, a fluffy tiger print cat called Bob, who chills out sedate, whilst all around him the buzzing bee colony works, a lone Emeli Sande plaque for a million sales on one wall, a table over flowing with favourite water to the stars- Figi water, piles of Musicweek magazines which mention NB and his worldwide chart positions (‘’ I’m No 1 in Poland and top 5 in 20 countries!), a remote control helicopter (has rapper DMX been here? That’s a different story!), a piano, numerous computers, flickering screens at various stages of ‘download complete’, left over take away food and a cross trainer right behind the producers chair ‘’I like to hop on for 20 minutes daily to keep myself healthy and give myself a break’’.\n\nNB’S STAIRMASTER AND FISH AQUARIUM.\n\nStacked up all alongside one wall ,are boxes piled high of Nike sneakers, which also trail along the studios exterior wall. It’s the sponsorship freeness that comes with success.\n\nAs he welcomes me to look around, and gestures for me to take a seat, NB proudly states ‘’look! I’m posh, eating bread and olive oil’’. A statement that tells us a million things in eight words.\n\nNAUGHTY BOYS STUDIO TABLE, CHAOS!\n\nIt’s clear that whilst he still lives at home with his parents in Watford, this studio space is his first home. Bottles of moisturizer, body wash and scented candles are piled onto the sound desk, muddled with notes about his work with his now colleagues and friends including Alesha Dixon, JLS, Lily Allen, Alexandra Burke Jennifer Hudson. Professor Green, Cheryl Cole, Tinie Tempah and more.\n\nJust a few days earlier, taking my place on the same sofa were American singer Britney Spears, as well as her new albums producer William Orbit ,who NB says he’s always been a fan of ‘’ I’m a fan of Ray of Light which he did for Madonna, so was very excited to have him here at the studios’’. These should be dizzying heights for the new boy on the scene, but he’s taken to it like a fish to water.\n\nNoticing me smiling at the Figi water bottles, he states ‘’oh I like Fiji water because when I went to see Simon Cowell, who said I was a music genius, he had lots. It’s now on my rider along with Grey goose vodka. Oh, and chicken wings’’.\n\nHowever on the subject of his chicken wings, he’s quick to chortle ‘‘Emeli and me rejected a black card from Nandos (which celebs get free meals with), because you practically have to sell your soul to get one, and then you have to promote it all day long. I personally believe, that once you make a success of yourself, you can pay for your own chicken, and don’t need to pimp yourself out for a free dinner’’. Very admirable. A young star with strict morals, clearly in the game for longevity, as opposed to selling his brand cheaply to anyone who wants a part of him.\n\nNAUGHTY BOYS PARTNER IN RHYME-EMELI SANDE SITS PROUD ON HIS STUDIO WALL.\n\nThe ‘’Emeli’’ he refers to is the one and only songstress Emeli Sande.\n\nNB is the mad wizard character behind Brit success story Emili Sande. Whilst Emile seemed to fly constantly into our reality around the Olympics, appearing on every live show and TV set, NB was quietly rubbing his hands with glee at their success. I myself was one of the cynical journo’s that was sick over being bombarded by Emeli during that time- until I met NB and heard their story. Now, I’m respectful of their tenacious journey.\n\nThe story of how NB met Emeli, and bought her down from her hometown of Glasgow, to record in his little Ealing studio, is now legendary in music circles.\n\nBoth were young and struggling. Emile had plans on becoming a doctor, whilst NB had dropped out of a marketing degree, was working as a pizza delivery guy and at his nearby Watford Hospital as well as at the Townhouse Studios as an apprentice, where he would learn to use the equipment when he wasn’t making Elton John and others cups of tea.\n\nAfter dropping out of uni in 2005, he did two things that both bore fruit. He applied for a Princes Trust grant that funded him £5000 for equipment. Speaking to the Watford Observer in 2009 about the opportunity at the time, NB said “The Prince’s Trust has a scheme where they want to help people who they feel can set up their own business. I wanted to make music but I didn’t have any equipment. They said they wanted to help me’’. He also applied to appear on Noel Edmonds Deal or no deal, where he won a mind blowing £44,000.\n\nWith these funds he was well on the way to building his Ealing based music studio, to replicate his mum and dads shed where he usually worked, and spotted Emile singing at industry showcase event ILUVLIVE and from here they gelled. NB put her up in a nearby hotel whilst they made music. The first set that made it successfully to the publics ears, were hits for Chipmunk ‘’Diamond rings’’ and Wileys ‘Never be your woman’, both featuring, a then unknown, Emeli Sande.\n\nThereafter they continued to make music together, resulting in Emeli getting a record deal with Virgin Records, and subsequently NB song writing and producing the majority of her debut album, Our Version of Events.\n\nWith Emeli’s star rising ever higher, record labels wanted the money maker behind her too, and so In 2012, NB signed a three-year publishing deal with Sony ATV, as well as a recording contract to release one album on Virgin. That album ‘Hotel Cabana’ is released August 26th 2013. ‘’Hotels intrigue me cos they’re bad places. I love the idea of what goes on at luxury hotels. Affairs, the fact that they’re designed for sex. Sexually themed. That’s what inspired me. I’m fascinated by it. My album is one man’s journey into Hotel cabana, a fantasy world’’\n\nNB’s debut album features a stellar line up of UK music names. Of course his muse Emeli features, as well as chart topper Tinie Tempah who introduces the album playing the Justin Timberlake role to Jay Z’s Magna Carter. Ed Sheeran also takes part AND NB exclaims incredulously ‘’I’m bringing back Gabrielle!’’ (She of ‘Dreams can come true’’ nineties fame). Everything about NB is different. Even his music marketing. The album already has a trailer hosted by future star George the Poet. Like Jigga famously said recently ‘’New Rules’’\n\nDuring our chat, NB isn’t alone. I’ve walked in at the end of an all day session he’s having with two young, Caucasian men, Moos and James, who go by the producer duo moniker Mojam. I nod a perfunctory greeting, as NB reveals Mojam are now signed to him, but used to be a part of the huge rabble of young, chart topping boys from Chingford, Essex called Blazing Squad. Suddenly I’m more intrigued! Both seem much more grown up and wizened since their hip hop boy band days, and are clearly a good duo for NB to bounce off daily in the studio, as they banter amicably together throughout our chat.\n\nWhilst there is laughter, whoops and shrieks as well as regular booming music from the speakers, Bob the cat is unusually chilled. NB laughs and tells me Bobs used to it ‘’ Bob is my and Emeli’s cat, we got her as a kitten to keep us company in the early days. He’s the most pampered cat alive. We regularly take Bob to Harrods animal spa where he has blueberry facials. He has many personas. Sometimes he’s Bobby Brown, other times he’s Bob Marley and on occasion Michael ‘’Bob’’ le!’’. With that last statement NB is clearly made for this business and already tiptoeing into Mariah Carey pet decadence areas. (It may amuse you to know that, in disbelief I googled blueberry facials for pets at Harrods and they do exist!). He continues “I welcome and embrace the good life, why not?,I grew up on a council estate. My dad’s a taxi driver’’.\n\nNB clearly wants the best for his cat and himself. Defending his decision to pay exorbitant rent in a location as coveted as Ealing Film Studios he justifies ‘’ it is expensive rent but what’s money compared to such an inspiring location? I see them filming Downtown Abbey here, Madonna shoots videos here , I walk past Rowan Atkinson often- it gives me bigger ambition’’\n\nWhen I probe as to whether he see’s himself as a new producer turned artist like Timberland, Scott Storch and Kanye West before him, he shakes his head violently ‘’Me and Emeli signed to Virgin at same time. I always saw myself as a producer, not producer/ artist. I had an idea for a hotel inspired concept album. So I made it’’.\n\nHe loves the music rock and roll lifestyle, but doesn’t like his face to be too prominent, preferring to remain slightly mysterious. Whilst I’m with him, he plays me the then as yet unreleased video for his latest single ‘’lifted’’ featuring Emeli. Neither appears in the video except for a cameo in a picture frame. He is familiar with the concept of over saturation in the media already. ‘’ I’m not rushing in and rushing out of this game. I want longevity. I wanna bring something diff to this generation, I want people to connect to my name. I love art; I could be the Banksy of the music world. I’m excited about art and Banksy. Banksy excites people, I wanna excite people’’.\n\nWith this statement, the verbal peddling just rolls faster and faster down the mountain with all of NB’s enthusiasm for life spiraling out ‘’ I also have an alter ego… not a messiah but a naughty boy. I’m cheeky but not bad, I’m mischievous! I couldn’t believe when I did a phoner interviewer this week for an Australian radio show and they swore and said pussy on air!, I’m saving to move my family out to Dubai!. I also want a property in Kensington!. I’m No 1 in the UAE! I’ve gotta get in with the Qatari Prince, that would be a good look!’’\n\nClearly NB knows who to connect with and who the next new stars will be, months before we do. I ask him to name some. He champions ‘’ a new singer called Charlie- she’s really good, a band called Chasing Grace and a rapper called Mic Righteous’’\n\nNB WITH HIS CAT-THE INFAMOUS ”BOB”\n\nGuts, sweat and years of hard work and skills, have poured the cement, for Naughty Boy to forever stand tall in the walk of fame. He has a firm grasp on what’s new, and more importantly; what’s next. According to the diary on his studio wall, where August 26th is a circled reminder for his albums release to the public- he is!\n\nJASMINE WITH HER OLD NEMISES- GIGGS!\n\nNext it was off to see my old mate Giggs who had invited me to a screening of his brand new video for his Mark Ronson single ”Is it gangsta-yes yes yes”\n\nDirected by Amy Winehouse’ one time boyfriend-the actor and director Reg Travis- the video was like a mini movie and really showed a great new side to Giggs…the actor!\n\nThe short film was shot very well, in a classic Only Fools and Horses style where Giggs is seen as an intense, broody character at a card game that gets caught up in a beef but ends up slipping onstage to join his band at a big live performance just in the nick of time. The ending is classic comedy gold!\n\nIn the house for the very special east end cinema screening were influential faces like CHOICEFM’s Manny Norte, actor Femi, music manager Trenton, a very suave looking Reg Travis and more.\n\nGiggs and his business partner Buck were both very professional suited and booted slickly,they welcomed us all, thanked us for coming and introduced the film to us very eloquently.\n\nSN1 presented a film and asked ”is it gangsta?”. It most certainly was!\n\nJASMINE WITH HER FRIEND- MOBO CEO- KANYA KING.\n\nI ended the week at the Grand Connought Rooms in Holborn, for the annual MOBO nominations panel. this is my 18th year- yes -i’ve been at every one!. This year it was opened up to a lot more taste makers and music industry peeps. invited alongside me were music managers, record label staff, dj’s, bloggers, writers, music fans and PR company heads.\n\nTHE MOBO NOMINEE PANEL 2013!\n\nThe debates and banter about who should and shouldn’t make this years shortlist was heated and intense-the way it should be- especially when it came to Best hip hop and Best African categories. Can’t wait to hear the finalists? Make sure you’re at the MOBO nominee party next week!\n\nMeanwhile, KK presented me with a MOBO- for best posing since 1996!\n\nJASMINE WITH ACTOR MUCISIAN SHAKKA AND PLAYWRITER NADIA FALL AT THE NATIONAL THEATRES SHED FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ”HOME”.\n\nWhat a cultured week I’ve had. Honestly we live in the best country in the world when it comes to access for everyone to arts and culture! So much of it is free, you just need to know where to look and be spontaneous. This week alone I have seen urban culture reflected in classical music, theatre, literature and pop music.\n\nFirstly, I was invited by the National Theatre to come and see a play called ‘Home’ at their annual pop up theatre THE SHED. Home is the diversity of stories, of the millions of young homeless youth across the UK. Its told in an engaging and extremely entertaining way. Most of us will take for granted that we live in a safe, secure, stable home, but for thousands of youngsters across the nation this is not the case. The play is set in a cube shaped intimate space, which the audience shares, in a very in- the- round- Brecht- like style. The audience plays the invisible ‘’interviewer’’, who asks residents and staff at a homeless hostel in East London about their stories. The script is taken from real life interviews with homeless youth, at the Foyer in East London. The script uses music like grime, hip-hop, pop and more to tell their stories. It’s a very cleverly written (by Nadia Fall) piece of theatre, which immediately has the audience’s full attention, not just due to the intimate set, but we also become a part of the story. The cast is a small group, of mostly young actors (including up and coming music act Shakka), who play characters that really brought home the horror of youth homelessness. Each actor plays 2 characters, and the way this is done is very clever, simple and effective. The young Eritrean girl human trafficked to the UK, the young man violently abused by his family, young single mothers thrown out of their homes and so many more. The writing is fast paced, sharp and at many occasions even humorous on life in a typical youth hostel. Home is playing on the South Bank at the Shed until September 7th- if you want an evening of entertainment that’s emotional, riveting and musical, I recommend you take the family to see it!\n\nNext I was sent a book titled Feral Youth by Polly Courtney. The book is set in a South London estate and is the story of a fictional character called Alesha who tries to survive life on the streets without a home, making money in a gang, befriending her school piano teacher. It’s not just another urban hood street life book. It’s told from a young girls perspective of life in the inner city in 2013 and the reasoning behind so many young peoples actions. It was such a gripping, easy read, that I finished it in 48 hours. I simply couldn’t put it down, so enticed into Alesha’s world and her next steps was I. I was carrying it around in my handbag reading in shopping queues, whilst making breakfast and even in the car in case I could take in another chapter. By the last chapter I was on the edge of my seat and teary as the story came to its conclusion. A brilliantly captured story about the minds of young people living very desperate lives today. A great read for both the young and adult alike.\n\nJASMINE WITH WRETCH- THE STAR OF THE BBC URBAN PROM.\n\nA most coveted ticket was gifted to me, by Robert Pascoe (Universal Music) and his brother Richie, for the first ever, BBC URBAN PROMS, at the Royal Albert Hall, where Radio 1 and Radio 1Xtra alongside Bigga Fish, hosted an evening, which brought together the two worlds of classical music and urban music.\n\nThe BBC Orchestra were absolutely amazing, led by Jules Buckley, whilst the urban acts were all presented to us by our wonderful hosts- BBC broadcasters, the very quickly rising star Charlie Sloth and the ever husky voiced stunner Sarah Jane Crawford. Both looked amazing with Charlie keeping it hip-hop by juxtaposing his slick blazer and shirt with jeans and trainers, whilst Sarah Jane glowed in a classy long ball gown. They did a cracking job but presenters can only ever be as good as the scripts they are reading from, and there was general consensus that air both DJ’s are very articulate and informative, so their urban proms script seemed pretty poor with awkward, immature, stilted banter, rather than engaging the audience with a few fascinating facts of distinction about the upcoming acts.\n\nHowever that didn’t detract from the greatness of the evening, which saw Maverick Sabre, Laura Mvula, Fazer, Lady Leshurr, Wretch32, Jacob Banks and Labrinth put on a once in a lifetime show. Each act performed around 3 times each, scattered through the running order.\n\nFazer’s name alone brought repeated screams from his fans, he switched from a casual beige sweater and trousers look to a more formal suit in his sets and really showed off his production and musical skills as he both played the piano and rapped with intense energy.\n\nMaverick sabre was confident, strong and held the audiences every mood, singing his hits ‘Let me go’, ‘These days’ and ‘I need’, with the gravitas of a seasoned performer.\n\nMany of the younger audience members were more excited about host Charlie sloth than the acts, and many a young fan (to my amusement!), was heard to be screaming ‘I love you Charlie’ as he spoke.\n\nNewest kid on the block, Jacob Banks mesmerized the crowd with his powerful, deep roaring vocals. I overheard someone behind me claim, “he’s the new generation Marvin Gaye!”\n\nThere was a standing ovation for Laura even more she opened her mouth to sing-such is her following growing in every demographic. She calmly let her voice command the royal albert halls attention and gave the whole event a really magical, dreamy vibe with her tracks ‘Sing to the moon’, ‘Father, father’, and ‘That’s alright’.\n\nThe stand out break through act of the night for me was most definitely Lady Leshurr who was the first to really get the audience participation going with her dynamic, explosive, energy. She was the first act to really bring the “urban” with her Usain Bolt paced, patois, spitting lyrics, and had the crowd chanting and clapping! Go girl! She really had us smiling incredulously as she spun the whole orchestra back again as if in a dance, by rewinding her track ‘’Look at me now’’, a mash up of Busta Rhymes and Chris Browns hits.\n\nThe social responsibility angle to the night, came in the form of a group called ‘’7 chapters’’ brought together by Fazer (apparently), who ‘wanted to find a group of talented young artists to give them a chance to perform with the BBC Symphony Orchestra’ at this event. Whilst I’m certain it gave the seven youngsters involved a great experience, and a BBC3 TV show to be screened next month will also come of the project, I’m not sure it really worked. I think having each youngster perform 16 bars with each of the established performers may have worked better. In action this part of the show felt awkward and more like a community voices box ticking exercise.\n\nWretch32 was, as ever, the charismatic chilled out, established, big name of the night, who kept it presidential in his first set where he donned a white shirt with black cap and trousers, to perform ‘Blackout’ where he had the whole RAH audience chanting his catchphrase ‘’ah yeah!’’, then later a more casual sporty look. Wretch’s energy on ‘Tracktor’ brought the show to its peak as audience members finally stood to dance and bounce in their formal attire before the whole cast reunited onstage to sing the classic Bob Marley hit ‘One love’.\n\nIt must be mind blowing for any music act, not only to hear their work being performed on such a huge scale by a critically acclaimed orchestra like the BBC’s, but also at a venue this historic. The sound was most definitely panoramic and high definition and this was most certainly a huge achievement for all involved!.\n\nJASMINE WITH TOP BOY’S LEAD ASHLEY WALTERS!\n\nChannel 4’s gritty mini series Top Boy, returns this month with its second series. A mind-blowing ratings success for the broadcaster, its lead characters Dushane and Sully are back with their daily grind, about inner city life in East London.\n\nSeries 1 had the fans praising the incredible cinematography (continued by director Jonathan van Tulleken in this new series), as well as the really real story line. It also had its critics citing glorification of gangs, drugs, black male stereotypes and violence. Many middle classed journalists actually questioned the storylines and suggested they were unreal and exaggerated. That’s the golden nugget right there. To many, this is fiction that they refuse to believe is happening mere meters away from their own doorsteps. To others, this storyline is their day-to-day reality. Every neighbourhood in London has its ‘’pharmaceutical warring areas’’, even the more affluent locations. Notting Hill and Holland Park have Ladbroke Grove, Canary Wharf has Hackney, Hampstead has Kilburn, Dulwich Village has Peckham and on and on and….\n\nIf you grew up in London, then you can relate to every storyline and character in Top Boy. The mentally ill mother leaving her son to raise herself, junkie parents that are so desperate to earn a living they resort to illegal activities, the excluded student paying bills by selling weed, the Chinese men-not just known for selling DVDs in the hood- but having the best weed, the bullied child wanting to fit in and be a part of the crowd, the parentless kids who need a sense of family so fall into the arms of the local gang. All of these, an everyday reality for many. Other untold stories are even more tragic.\n\nTHE TOP BOY PANEL DISCUSSION POST SCREENING AT THE BFI\n\nOne of the reasons Top Boy has been so successful, is that it’s not simply a shoot em up gangland visual fest. It’s an extremely well written drama by Ronan Bennett, which has also been nominated for a BAFTA. In series two, life on the Summerhouse Estate comes head-to-head with the world of organised crime, property development and corporate greed – and the police start to close in on past crimes committed. One of the criticisms of series one was that there was no police presence in the drama. Oh the irony! In reality, this façade takes place across inner city neighbourhoods daily, and there tends never to be a police presence tackling it! So series one was actually nearer the truth than acknowledged. However, Top Boys writers did address that point and series two immediately shows a much stronger police presence in the storyline from the jump off.\n\nAnother area, which is more balanced, is the notion that criminal activity at this level is never just made up of fully black youth. Watching series one you may have thought that the case, however series two brings in the Albanian gangs, the Chinese weed barons and a more diverse, realistic reflection.\n\nScreen one at the BFI was sold out on Monday night as Channel 4 and Cowboy Films held a screening of the first show from series two, and it stood up to being just as gripping with its storylines unfolding cleverly from scene to scene.\n\nAfter a rapturous applause for the cast and crew, the two main characters Dushane and Sully, played by actor/musician Ashley Walters and music star Kano took part in a Q&A session with the director and a moderator.\n\nJASMINE WITH MUSICIAN/ ACTOR KANE ROBINSON- TOP BOY!\n\nKane Robinson, known to his music fans as Kano admitted that with so many people constantly asking him if the drama was returning there had been some nerves returning and wanting this series to be as strong as its predecessor. Director Jonathon enthused “its a gift to get given a show that’s so amazing I had to make it as good as series 1”. Ashley, known to his music fans as So Solids Asher D, added “we were so keen to return we happily shot in winter in the snow, it was tough’’\n\nWhat was it about season 1 that gripped people? Ashley seems to be as flummoxed about its success as many others and attributes it to good timing. ‘’We as a nation were depressed. We’d had the UK riots. Tensions were high, especially in London. The show had captured everyone’s desperation and frustration. Kane and me asked ourselves whilst filming all through series 1 “will this ever make it to air on channel 4 or get sold cheaply to channel 5!”\n\nKane added-‘’a lot of people could identify with this. For others it was an eye opener. Seeing Ridley Rd Market in that context for a lot of people is scary’’.\n\nAshley was obviously displeased having to defend the storyline and drama in regular interview’s with the mainstream press ‘’. We don’t question Only Fools and Horses about sterotypes, why do they question us? We all know it goes on. It’s the first thing I’ve done that I feel is really real. We worked on the script to ensure it was as realistic as possible. ” Between myself and Kane We’ve already done 28/31 years of research so know how real this storyline is! ‘’\n\nAsked about how much fun compared to his other roles, acting the part of Dushane was, Ashley admitted “I love being on the show but my characters boring compared to Sully. On set the others are fighting, shooting and doing stunts. I’m always the big man on the phone going ” where u at LOL?”\n\nThe great thing about urban culture in the UK is, that since our British music acts started charting successfully, youth have aspired to musical directions. Similarly when urban comedy started making a name for young urban comedians like Eddie Kadi and Kojo, youth were shown another road to success. Nowadays with leaders in their fields like actor/director Noel Clarke having proven that urban dramas work commercially, Top Boy is a whole new platform for new, young acting talent. Watching series two, its clear that there are even fresher, new faces than before. Young Brits being given roles that haven’t acted before. (You may recall the pandemonium in Hackney a few months ago at an open audition where hundreds gathered desperate to get their first big TV break)\n\nDirector Jonathon added ‘’Cowboy films gave me a lot of power to cast series two. We had too many good people to choose from. Music acts Bashy and Nolay and Roxanne are still to make their Top Boy debuts.\n\nThe director also revealed that many of the scenes are improvised so that the youngest actors don’t sound as if they’re reading lines. This makes for an even realer script and slanguage within the show. It also leads to a variety of comedic one-liners that weren’t anticipated. Kane actually burst out laughing at one scene, which apparently wasn’t meant to be funny when shot, but had a classic comedic moment as the whole of the BFI chortled loudly.\n\nOf course, the music journo’s were keen to hear when we could expect new music from both the lead actors-if ever… Kane offered “I’m in the studio now finishing up my new music. I started enjoying the acting halfway through shooting season one, I found a love for it and if the right film script came along I’d consider it’\n\nAshley, who seems to be onscreen acting in a new drama or film regularly, was more realistic about his endeavors back to the music industry “its difficult juggling music and acting. Sometimes the music world can be very unforgiving. I’ve made some very bad publicly seen decisions in the past that I’m still paying for. I can’t consistently put out music with my acting and kids. You have to focus on music to make it really work”. Ashley also explained why he loves acting in TV more than the film world citing “TV is better to development a character for me than a 3 hour film”\n\nAsked about his own transformation from criminal to screen star Ashley admitted “everyone has a moment of enlightenment. The hardest thing was for me to turn my back on some people that were in my social environment. I wouldn’t ever tell anyone what to do, for me it was watching my father die, prison and needing to feed my children that were life changing moments”\n\nYou can just imagine how much fun filming a drama like this must be. Director Jonathon described it as the type of fun that soldiers have in the trenches together, but you can see the banter and camaraderie between them all is strong. Throughout the Q&A session Kane would regularly heckle Ashley. A particular stand out moment was when Ashley mentioned he had “dabbled” in this Top Boy world as a kid. “Dabbled!!?” Kane loudly questioned much to the audience’s mirth.\n\nOne of the strongest elements of the way Top Boys shows are structured are the Eastenders cliffhanger endings at the end of each episode. Director Jonathon said he was aware of how powerful these had to be to bring the viewer back gagging for more. And they are gagging. The Internets been trending #TOPBOY throughout its first run and will no doubt be bigger, better and stronger than ever on its second outing. Be sure to tune in. its not the prettier side of life, but it is happening right here, right now. Ignore the realest reality show on TV at your peril.\n\nJASMINE ON THE RIVER NILE IN UGANDA!\n\nThe harder I work, the luckier I get. Last week I was blessed to have been invited out to Uganda, East Africa, where I was one of 4 judges for the Club Video Music Awards, (the country’s premier annual music awards ceremony), which takes place in Kampala, in September later this year. I was invited by my one time MTV International colleague Jandre Louw, who is doing extremely well out in Africa with his own company and is now a player and leader on their music scene. Uganda is called the Pearl of Africa and it certainly lived up to its precious name.\n\nThere were two reasons for my fascination for the trip. One; in the past 5 years, the exodus of British people to Africa for business has been huge. The continent is an untapped industry that’s ready to blow up in media, arts, culture and business, and many are getting on the bandwagon early, to make the most of an opportunity much of the western globe seems to be oblivious to. Even Chinese business out there,are taking over, in droves. The second reason is of course, my late fathers East African connection. He was born and bred in neighboring Kenya, (which I am still to explore), and often-mentioned Uganda in his memories of back home. So to have the opportunity to get so near to my fatherland and experience their rich heritage and culture was a blessing.\n\nKLM- THE WORST CHOICE TO FLY TO AFRICA.\n\nEvery cloud has a silver lining. And every silver lining has a cloud. Our cloud on this trip was flying Dutch airline KLM. The European leg of the trip is akin to many an airline carrier, but once on the African leg it’s a whole different story. The aircraft are old planes in dire need of updating. The staff and air stewardess are in urgent need of a grooming expert. All our crew looked like they had been dragged through a hedge backwards. Perhaps a hairbrush brand like Mason Pearson can lend them a helping hand. Their gate protocol was also unnecessarily unorganized. Huge queues for no apparent reason. Security for baggage at the gate meant that even water bottles bought from departure shops had to be confiscated, and left you parched and thirsty for 2 hours at the gate. A fellow African passenger shared ‘’yes its always this way, they have no respect for African journeys, we are always treated this way, we are used to it’’. Next time I would fly direct via BA!\n\nJASMINE AT THE CLUB VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS PRESS CONFERENCE WITH FELLOW JUDGES AND MAIN SPONSOR- SAM.\n\nHowever, that was the only cloud to an otherwise glorious experience. On landing at Entebbe airport, we were greeted on arrival by a protocol agent ,and hurried to our waiting car, which whisked us off to our hotel- the Kampala Protea. A very efficient hotel, in the heart of Kampala’s business district, where the rooms are absolutely huge, and decorated in a unique minimally stylish manner. The staff couldn’t do enough to help in their very welcoming, friendly manner, and it’s the first place we noted, just how softly spoken the Ugandan people are. It’s also the first hint of the influence of the Asian community ,once upon a time in Uganda (before Idi Amin took offense to their presence). Their teas are ‘chai spiced’, and their hotel room service menu’s sport many an Indian nod, from samosa’s to chicken tikka’s.\n\nJASMINE WITH HER FELLOW JUDGES AT THE 2ND PRESS CONFERENCE FOR THE CLUB VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS ,UGANDA.\n\n3 days of work were followed by two days of pleasure. For three long days, my fellow judges and I were to narrow down hundreds of submitted music videos to just four in each of the 13 categories. Categories included the usual big ones like best male, best female, best video, best newcomer and so on. More technical categories included best cinematography, best special effects, best choreography and more. My fellow judges were manger of Channel O (most widely distributed channel across African households), Leslie ‘’Lee’’ Kasumba, talent and music manager for Trace TV (the no.1 pan African music TV channel) Phillip Nwankwo, and South African film maker and very highly regarded video director Matthew Stonier. The thinking behind having judges that were not connected deeply to the Ugandan music scene was so that there were no bias or unfairness in the initial voting process. Not knowing who was already big in Uganda, meant that we could judge the videos purely on the art of their visuals, as opposed to being swayed by the artist’s personal brand. I was the only international judge, so came with no pre conceptions at all.\n\nA TYPICAL UGANDAN VIEW-THIS ONE FROM THE AMIN PASHA HOTEL.\n\nDaytimes were spent viewing hundreds of videos; evenings were spent seeing live music at venues like Cayenne, a Maurice Kirya gig and more. My favourite evening was at The Emin Pasha Hotel, which is Set in Two Acres of Peaceful Park-Like Tropical Gardens. Big Mature Trees, Flowering Shrubs and Scented Vines. We ate a delicious dinner and took over the outdoor poolside house band as they sang, with the men in our group showing off with a bit of karaoke!\n\nAs with any judging process, the debating was intense and at times heated. We laughed, acknowledged talent, froze at videos that made us sit up for a multitude of reasons, debated authenticity, accents, quality of filming, originality and more. I noted that most of the videos were in need of Ofcom style compliance rules advise, so that product placement, dangerous and imitable behaviour, smoking, drinking and soft porn during daytime playlists could be avoided. One thing that intrigued me was that it seemed that 99% of all music videos submitted, seemed to come straight from Jamaica, such is the passion of Ugandans brought up on dancehall music. With full patois accents and dancehall dance moves, it was like judging a Caribbean set of acts, as opposed to African. It reminded me of the early UK urban music scene when we imitated American hip-hop videos and accents before finding our own voices. Leslie informed me that in fact, dancehall is deeply entrenched in Ugandan culture. (This means that if you love reggae and dancehall culture then Uganda is the perfect spot for your next vacation as the music and food is very akin to Caribbean).\n\nAnother observation was that like many new acts around the world, their videos highlight sexy, scantily dressed girls gyrating wildly and rappers surrounded by their version of material wealth. All understandable, as this is what success looks like from many viewers points of view, I was eager to point out that this isn’t always what playlist managers are looking for though. After all, is it still sexy after your 1000th booty shot? Do we care about rappers that continue to tell us about their material wealth purchases? It was good to note that UK acts played in Uganda included Chip, Tinie, Estelle, Rita Ora, Skepta and L Marshall. #TeamUK!\n\nConsidering how young the Ugandan music industry is, I can see that the passion and D.I.Y attitude of the artists and filmmaker’s means that this is a market that will grow rapidly with increased reach of their acts the same way west African artists from Nigeria have broken into international music playlists recently.\n\nThe work being done in Uganda to give these acts a platform via the CVMA team is sure to develop, nurture and grow the local music industry to build a lasting legacy. Right now it may seem that only West African music and culture have infiltrated our shores, but after this trip I can confidently state East Africa and Uganda are getting ready for their take over!\n\nAT THE START OF THE RIVER NILE CRUISE!\n\nMy final two days were spent exploring. The range of adventure in Uganda is wide and hair-raising. Activities include game viewing, fishing trips, water fall cruises, silverback gorilla safari treks, white water rafting, African rainforest camping, chimp trekking and swamp walking. So of course I ,chose the sedate activity of cruising down the Nile, with our new Ugandan friend Ambrose, a guide and my friend Jodie.\n\nDay one was spent travelling 2 hours outside of Kampala to the River Nile. The car journey showed the poorer side of the country. Ramshackle corrugated iron huts, wooden roadside stalls, dusty dry hot roads, the toil of the land by both men and women, churches, mosques, kingdom halls, produce and groceries sold at roundabouts, all juxtaposed to make a buzzing, thriving, happy roadside community.\n\nWe arrived at the Jinja Nile Resort late afternoon, and enjoyed a drink and pizza in the treetop wooden bar house, overlooking the cross-section of the Nile and Lake Victoria. I felt disappointed by the menu of English breakfast, pizza and beer options mingled with really loud European dance music and Rihanna hits. At a sight this majestic I think tourists would prefer a wider variety of food options- at least a healthy salad to be at one with nature. Music could be authentic to Africa or classical, but European chart remixes really spoilt the nature and wildlife’s ambience. We instead focused to our left, from where we could hear regular screams of jubilation as bungee jumpers threw themselves off the sky-high platform overlooking one of the greatest sights in the world. There were also small cabins and tents scattered around where more hippy style tourists were getting their ‘at one with nature’ groove on. (I had a hilarious moment in the ladies washroom as I struggled to zip up my pants and run out with toilet paper flying around, as a giant flying insect of some sort resembling a huge bumble bee, kept noisily buzzing and circling my head. I managed to keep it together and not sprint outside screaming like a Carry On movie-I didn’t want the locals to laugh at me thinking ‘’mazunga’’-the local name for white/foreign people!)\n\nTHE SOURCE OF THE RIVER NILE.\n\nThe sunset Nile cruise was like being in paradise. An experience where you could practically hear David Attenborough describe the fascinating range of squawking, multi coloured birds that inhabited all the trees lining the river. Mini mangroves acted as giant speakers as we sailed past their choir of crickets chirping and wildlife anthems. A variety of exotic water birds like skinny meerkats dipped their necks in and out of the river, surrounding our boat as if giving us nature’s most beautiful escort along the Nile. Randomly scattered troupes of monkeys scurried around in the trees as we filmed them.\n\nA SHOP. SLAP BANG IN THE CENTRE OF THE NILE. SURROUNDED BY WATER!\n\nSuddenly ,we spotted, slap bang in the centre of the river Nile- a store. Not bankside but dead in the centre!. A craft store that sold tourist knick-knacks. I had to jump out of our boat and explore. Proof that you can shop anywhere these days!.\n\nWITH MY WOODEN BOAT WITH 3 ROWING MEN..”ANYTHING JOANNA CAN DO…”\n\nI had just watched the Joanna Lumley TV series ‘’Joanna Lumley on the Nile’’ before heading out to Uganda, and had noted that at the end of her series,she had bought a wooden boat with a man rowing and released it at the source of the Nile and watched it float gently along. I bought a small wooden boat with 3 African men rowing. (one upmanship on the Nile Lol!) Anything Joanna Lumley can do, I can do three times better I reasoned. Our guide suggested releasing it at the crossroads of the Nile and Lake Victoria, near a bird island where the current was much calmer. I agreed with glee. We set off as I prayed and blessed the wooden boat, thanking an unnamed higher spirit for allowing me this amazing adventure. I placed the boat ceremoniously into the river, with all watching, and it immediately flopped onto its side. It floated though. Not the way I had romantically envisioned it may one day reach Egypt ,but it floated. Oh how we laughed! (Never take on Joanna Lumley!).\n\nMY LITTLE BOAT COULDN’T QUITE STAY UPRIGHT LOL!\n\nEn route back home to Kampala, Ambrose suggested we stop off at the Mabira Rainforest Lodge off the main highway between Kampala and Jinja. He had described it as a dwelling like a village in the forest. Not expecting much ,we peered with trepidation into the dark night ,as our van took us deeper into a dark, quiet, wild forest. Suddenly, once again, we were surprised to find a majestic surprise!. A huge, colonial style tree house hotel -restaurant -bar, which was quiet, tranquil and akin to an oasis in the centre of wilderness. The formal waitress served us from an adventurous menu. We stayed safe Brits and tried the cream of beetroot soup and pots of spiced tea as we talked into the night. As the whole venue is open air it’s very easy to watch the endless parade of butterflies, birds, monkeys, etc., pass by. The forest itself is gorgeous: lush and dense and packed with all of the creatures you’d want to see. A magical end to a magical day.\n\nAT NIGHT IN THE RAINFOREST HOTEL.\n\nThe next day we had been invited to the very opulent Serena Kampala Hotel to sample their spa and Sunday brunch. After a tour that showed us just why this hotel is said to be the best in the city (with its bar that stays open until the last guest is ready to leave, U shaped bedroom suites, a pool that’s straight out of a tropical holiday brochure and the biggest and best gym/dance studio I’ve ever seen in any hotel globally), I enjoyed a deep tissue massage. The spa is a lush Moroccan themed oasis that’s tranquil and up to date with the latest treatments, which are sold, at extremely reasonable rates. Each spa room is named after a flower like lavender, lilac, mimosa, rose. I was led to my private room aptly named jasmine. My masseuse Hanifa, really had the strongest most inquisitive hands I’d ever experienced. The heated pillow was out of this world too. Every single muscle in my body was given its due and proper attention leaving me a blissful, jellylike splodge on the heated massage table at the end.\n\nJASMINE WITH HER FRIEND JODIE, POOLSIDE AT THE SERENA KAMPALA HOTEL.\n\nThe brunch was as decadent as its surroundings with fresh cuts of lamb, fish, beef, a turkey roast and the most delicately, tender spiced minute steak. Brunch was accompanied by a band, which performed soothing African covers and made the whole experience just perfect. Guests seemed a mix of high-end families, movers and shakers as well as businessmen and loved up couples. The classic location for a vacation or business!. For now, Uganda remains a best kept secret for western vacationers. But I predict, not for much longer!\n\nSHAKKA PERFORMING AT THE TABERNACLE.\n\nI was invited by ThisIsWired in partnership with Raymond Weil, to new up and coming music act SHAKKAs – The Tribe EP Launch at West London’s The Tabernacle,\n\nYou can tell when an act will be huge by the potential number of music industry heads that turn out to witness their talent early on. This one shows that Shakka is very much in demand with A&R’s representing from Island, Atlantic, EMI, Universal Publishing and Eagle I Publishing.\n\nSHAKKA KEPT HIS AUDIENCE ENRAPTURED AT HIS EP LAUNCH!\n\nHaving recently released his debut single Sooner Or Later, a serendipitous ode to his own ascension as an artist, Shakka is ready to release his first official body of work as he steps out to headline the launch of his EP. Past collaborations include Wretch 32, Basement Jaxx, Angel and Tanya Lacey so we expected some special guest appearances on the night. The high-impact, multi-talented McNasty (as seen on this year’s BGT) provided main support on the night, and Kiss FM’s DJ Melvin played throughout the night too!\n\nArtists representing in the venue for Shakka were Wretch 32, Daley, Angel, Basement Jaxx and Kelly Le Roc (who looked stunning in a figure hugging dress and heels…). It was a hot Friday night and the venue was buzzing. On arrival, people were eating and drinking in the courtyard as well as the packed bar. The gig kicked off at 9pm to a sold out audience. A solo drummer graced the stage as he gave us his rendition of some of the hottest tracks right now. Shakka, who entered the stage to rapturous applause, swiftly followed this. The crowd was mainly 20 something and very hip… an eclectic mix of hipsters and the ladies were out in force! The eclectic crowd greeted the dapperly dressed Shakka who wore a bright orange blazer and jeans. “Go Lady” was the first track and the crowd –impressively-knew all the words! Actually they knew the words to every song. He has a strong fan base who hang on to his every word.\n\nAnother track, ‘On This Thing’ – was a definite anthem with the crowd merrily singing along. ‘Take our time’ is a slower, which saw the ladies swooning. But then the guys were also catered to when Shakka performed ‘Strength of an Ox’. During his set, the ever-humble Shakka thanked the crowd and told us he was so amazed that they have sold out and to be in his own neighbourhood made it very special for the whole audience. Just as the night felt like it couldn’t get any better…enter chart topper Wretch32 – the crowd went wild as Wretch and Shakka hugged and began to perform their chart-topping duet ‘Black Out’.\n\nShakka’s next single to be released from the EP is ‘Spin’ which already has early support and has been spot played every day this week on Radio 1. The TEAMUK unity is still going strong, and long may it live on!\n\nLADIES TALK, JASMINE WITH HER FELLOW PANELISTS; JACQI JOSEPH, JACKIE MICHAEL AND LISA BENT, LISTS JAQCI JOSEPH, JAC, HOST ANGIE LE MAR AND GUEST RICHARD BLACKWOOD!\n\nThe all female star line up hosted by Angie Le Mar called Ladies Talk is back for another series!\n\nLadies talk series 2 is back on Vox Africa on SKY 218. Originally with a panel of 5 ladies including myself, this series see the panel open up and more pre-recorded tips by each panelist.\n\nAs well as being broadcast in the UK, it also transmits in another 20 English speaking and 20 French speaking countries across the globe including Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, Tanzinia, Kenya Nigeria, Sierra Leone ,Zimbabwe, Benin, Lesotho and Gambia. (So I might not be a star here, but I may be in Uganda).\n\nIts not just the front of camera line uo that work hard to put shows like this on air. The key, powerful influencers and decision makers like Rodney Borde-Kuofie, MD Vox Africa TV Network helps. He explained his support of Ladies Talk. ‘’After the success of Season 1, LT returns bigger and better with a new set, more great guests, fantastic new additions to the studio panel as well as young roving reporter, Remel London engaging the public on the streets of London. Season 2 also features other new elements such as Men’s Talk. The introduction of Men Talk will appeal to men, who will see their perspective incorporated into a unique womens show that now aims to appeal to a broader audience. Like season 1, season 2 is a first on UK television. Where the UK BME community can be heard and seen giving it’s opinion on mainstream news, current affairs and entertainment, as well as looking at items that have a particular resonance with our audience’’.\n\nProducer and star of the show, writer, actor and director Angie le mar added ‘’ Ladies Talk is back bigger and better, we’ve all worked hard on the show, and have been truly committed to creating a platform that we can be proud of, a show that our audience look forward to seeing, and guests enjoy being a part of. This year we have comeback a lot slicker, we have also introduced a few sections, a roving reporter and a special section for men, ‘Men’s Talk’ so no one is left out.”\n\nThe first show in the new series saw June Sarpong return to UK TV to tell us about her new endeavors and share her thoughts on Nelson Mandala. ‘” It’s not often you are in the presence of greatness, we throw that word around, other people are good… Nelson Mandela is great- HE EVEN COMMENTED ON MY SHOES!”’’.\n\nThe second show saw an interview with gang member turned author Robyn Travis who has a book published about his stories and what he learnt from life on the road. We also spoke to actor and presenter Richard Blackwood who is still working in the west end in theatre and starting to write his one man show which he will bring to the public in early 2014. Richard also shared his reasons for being an ambassador for prostrate cancer awareness. By a strange timing of fate he revealed that when the charity asked him to help spread the word about testicular cancer as its highest amongst black men, his dear mother had only just recently also been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. In a strong but heart breaking tale Richard shared his experiences on having been tested for it live on terrestrial TV and more. If you want to catch the whole show where we also discusses our usual array of topics-which this week included ‘’why aren’t black men and women getting married?’’ ‘‘Does your name define you’’ and more stay tuned!\n\nJAS AND ALEX GRAN A SUSHI LUNCH.\n\nHad an extended sushi lunch with African businessman and entrepreneur of all things blingtastic and fab- Alexander Amosu. Alex won’t touch it if it doesn’t sound mister big Willie style. He started off, twenty years ago, by inventing the R&B ringtone mobile phone company. Then went to spend his millions on making gold plated IPads, macs and cell phones as well as the most expensive suit in the world made with real gold threads, all sold in Harrods. He’s got the midas touch- everything he touches really does turn to gold! Then he appeared on African Nigerian version of Dragons Den as a judge, next he bought the African rights to the Sunseeker Yacht business, as well as starting a joint venture with Warner Music to bring in African music acts from the African continent and now is looking to add more to that impressive list, but I am forced to secrecy until his permission to disclose.\n\nJASMINE WITH SINGER TERRI WALKER AND MISHA B’S MANAGER CHARLENE GRANT.\n\nHad an evening out with my mate, singer Terri Walker. I invited her to join me at the Urban Development showcase night at Cargo in East London, where young music hopefuls were performing their work. Urban collective are an organization that stand at the crossroads where new underground talent meets the music industry. Across their 13-year-old history, artists they’ve helped and worked with are now household names. Amongst the funders and ambassadors for the evening we also hung out with Misha B’s manager Charlene Grant.\n\nFounded in 2007 by Labrinth, his sister ShezAr and led by Shola Ama, more recently the Urban Development Vocal Collective (UDVC) have performed for the BBC Radio 1 Hackney Weekend. Over the last four years the UD Vocal Collective has provided vocals for Wretch 32, Bashy and Omar and performed at festivals such as Rise, Paradise Gardens and Lovebox as well as Urban Development’s flagship events Re:Definition and Industry Takeover. Honing song writing and vocal skills, the UD Vocal Collective project develops industry knowledge and creates shows that raise the bar for live performance.\n\nOn arrival we were welcomed by UD boss Pamela McCormick, who introduced us to her guests, and told us a little about the evening. The young performers didn’t disappoint, in fact they were bold, confident and very vocally gifted. They performed their own written material, much of which I could quite easily see charting. They were professional and after a mini showcase to VIP guests, they performed a longer live show on the main stage to a very enthusiastic audience.\n\nSpeaking to some of the young music acts I was told ‘’UDVC is a group of inspiration. It’s a collective of voices that come together and create things that are unique and fill a room when you hear them. There isn’t anything or anyone similar to UDVC, which makes us really unique. When you’re around everyone else and on a high from the music, you can bounce of each other, which creates an incredible vibe whether rehearsing, performing or creating new songs.”\n\nAnother young vocalist told us ‘‘we come together once a week for three hours in the evening. If we’ve had a performance in the last week, we’d look back on it and evaluate it. What we thought went well, what could be improved etc. If not, we write songs as a collective and practice effective vocal warm up and techniques. We also have workshops with artists who come in and help us. In the past year, we’ve performed at a lot of corporate events and in 2012 we were invited to perform for the Deputy Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street. Performing at BBC Radio 1’s Hackney Weekend and opening the entire festival was probably one of my and the groups highlights. It’s most certainly one of, if not the biggest thing we’ve ever done. We’ve collaborated with a number of artists including Jay Norton, Maverick Sabre, Devlin & Wretch 32.” Now I’m hoping that Terri will get involved and help mentor urban developments talented youth. No pressure Terri. Just do it.\n\nJASMINE WITH STYLIST TO THE STARS -RICHARD SHOYEMI\n\nFinally I caught up with stylist to the stars Richard Shoyemi. I first noticed Richard years ago at social parties where id be thinking ‘’who is that big, very flamboyant man??’’ finally I was informed he was a new stylist on the scene and was working with a number of music acts.\n\nRichard is now a staple on London’s flossy circuit where he can be seen in many music stars entourage backstage at TV and radio studios, model shoots for vogue and more. I wanted to share his very inspiring story with you all as I know there are numerous budding fashionistas amongst my readers.\n\nHe grew up in the areas of Shoreditch, Hoxton, Hackney. As a child he attended youth club where they did fashion workshops where they would be taught to make basic fashion. He used to live in Adidas tracksuits as he was influenced my Missy Elliott’s line. His dress sense has since become extremely flamboyant and fabulous. Even on the hot summers day that he meets rapper Eve and myself for lunch, he claims he is ‘’understated’’ in black trilby, black leather and studs. (Once at a D&G party I saw him in an Asian sari, drummer hat and metallic gold booty shorts with guests like Solange and Queen Latifah all asking ‘’who’s that?!).\n\nAs a teenager Richard impressed, went to London College of fashion at aged 16 and entered a competition, won and consequently went onto GMTV. He wanted to get his fashion designs out more, and thought he might be able to get his brand out easier if he styled. Next thing he networks for all he’s worth and Sony Music called him to style for a group called ‘Big Bruvas’ ,and ever since then the rest is history. He now dresses American acts like Nicki Minaj, Macy Gray, Lupe Fiasco, Pharrell and Eve as well as British acts like Alesha Dixon, Sabrina Washington, Preeya Kalidas, Shystie and more.\n\nHe’s had loads of great moments where his acts have looked just drop dead stunning on red carpets and beyond, but I wanted to know the horror stories.\n\nHis worst moment he can recall to date involved Nicki Minaj- WHO HE ABSOLUTELY ADORES SO WAS MORTIFIED AT THIS MOMENT. He was meant to travel to Australia with her but asked for the 24-hour flight to be upgraded. Richard recalled ‘’there’s no way I could do a 24 hour flight in economy-look how big I am!, the record label couldnt foot the bill so after agreeing it with Nicki, I sent my assistant which they were happy with. Unbelievably, my assistant missed her flight and so all shit hit the fan. I knew Nicki wouldn’t be happy and I felt awful. However Nicki understood that I should’ve had a better flight. Finally she agreed I could style her via skype so that’s how we worked it on the night. It went on for a week. That was hard but we are both professionals and I had to make it work’’\n\nRichard says ‘’people have a perception of me which I often try to unsteady, to me my fashion is effortless but to others looks very put together’’\n\nYou have to see Richards home to appreciate his fashion extends well beyond his clothes. His furniture is breath taking. Stand out looks include a Swarovski table, which he put together with gold specks and a huge black mannequin covered in blinging gold jewelry. So its not surprising that he is currently in talks to do business with some major Bollywood people for which he is traveling to Mumbai very soon. Go forth and make the world more opulent Richard. May the force of Anna Wintour be with you!\n\nJASMINE WITH EVE AT THEIR ALFRESCO LUNCH 2013!\n\nEvery big rap clique these days has their token 1st lady. Whether its So Solids Lisa Maffia or Cash Money’s Nicki Minaj. Back in the day Foxy Brown was aligned with Jay Z and Rah Digga with Busta. Some ladies fell off, and lets be real, others weren’t as sharp as their male counter parts or couldn’t take the pace. Ruff Ryders were a force to be reckoned with as honcho DMX blew up charts, cars and clubs with his hard hitting hits. His 1st lady Eve, was just as strong with her songs like ‘who’s that girl’, ‘let me blow your mind’ and ‘gangsta loving’’. Like many she had her fame early, fast and furious. After taking a decades break she’s flown back onto the scene this year with her new album ‘Liplock’’. Eve invited me to catch up, and so I took her for an al fresco lunch in Ladbroke grove.\n\nJASMINE AND EVE 10 YEARS AGO MAKING AN EPK FOR UNIVERSAL MUSIC!\n\nAfter welcoming her back, I reminded her that the last time we had been together ,was when we made her EPK for Universal 10 years ago. We laughed at the memories.\n\nIt’s been sooo long since we’ve had a female MC return to the scene with no gimmicks-just flow. Eve explained that ‘‘my TV show took up 4 years of my life so had a break from music. A few Years back I had a whole album ready to go with my single ‘’tambourine’’ but it got shelved’’ by my then record label and then it took me a few years to get free from the record label, which was mentally exhausting. I did my own thing for a while and even put out a dub step record with Benga-I kept it moving’’\n\nThis time around it must feel like being a new act coming back to a totally revived, switched up scene. She agreed ‘’Yes there was no big social media when I first came out. I forget to instagram cos I’m always in the moment. My fans get mad with me cos I don’t tweet enough, I have to remind myself to do it, if I had the choice I wouldn’t do it, I prefer to stay private. I’m excited though, everything’s different and new and it’s exciting! I’m exploring again. No one could’ve predicted the growth of the hip-hop monster’’.\n\nWe laughed about our memories of her one time boss DMX and his obsession with remote control toys and eccentricities. I explained to Eve that Wiley was a similarly eccentric but genius UK character, . Eve admitted she doesn’t talk or even see DMX anymore. ‘’We did shows last year but this solo album had to me just me. I will always be ruff ryders for life but this had to be my journey’’\n\nEve has put out her new music on her own label ‘’From the rib’’ which I guessed must be a gift and a curse? ‘‘Yes of course, I grew up on a major label, there are pro’s and con’s. What’s better on a label is that u have a machine that are pushing constantly for the song and video, when you’re solo your teams reach is smaller so that’s a risk and a frustration. I am very lucky with my teams right now and I’ll keep working my ass off’’. Impressively Eve is a fierce rapper not afraid to make a few musical left turns. Her new music highlights sounds as diverse as west coast bangers, afrobeats and dance music. She jumps ‘’now that I’m staying here in the UK I wanna work with more British acts and producers, I really need to do my homework on who’s hot’’. I told her Wiley and Naughty Boy should most definitely be on her research list.\n\nWith her new album Liplock, Eve has collaborated with a few old skool names. ‘‘My only preconceived notion before making the album was a mix of my past and present, I listen to hip-hop, afro, dance and you can see that on this album. My Missy, Snoop and Swiss collabs came out of friendships. Also with Game, I know him personally, and knew he’d be down with the record. The remix to ‘’Bad bad’’ used Pusha T on the remix , and is dope, Dawn Richards I didn’t really know but my PR dude made me love her and so I went with that ,but there are some newer acts from the new generation that are still wary of working with me as they don’t know if I’m going to be big again and that’s cool too’’.\n\nEve has also mentioned that she’d love to work with Andre 3000 and Lauryn Hill but with all Lauryn’s tax and money drama’s I assume this wont be happening any time soon. Eve shrugs ‘’money problems happen to all of us, it happened to me, you gotta watch the people that’s watching your money, artists do need to have this education early on in their career. I learnt to attend the board meetings, I used to hate them and be bored, now I go over every bit of paperwork they send me. Even though I trust my teams now, I always go over all my paperwork’’\n\nHowever, we also discussed how business and fame dramas don’t just affect long-term legends; even newbies to the game get caught up, hello Justin Bieber! ‘‘He’s young, 19 and smoking some weed, that’s what he should be doing, he’s a kid’’ Eve laughed adding ‘’don’t do drugs kids!’’ but on a serious note Eve does think that one hit wonders on the internet can be a lazy way of making it to the top ‘’ There are so many more 1 hit wonders today than there ever were back then due to internet YouTube stars, in my day you had to do the hard slog, tour, gain respect, do the underground/street kind of thing, young artists miss out on their coming up here’’\n\nEVE AT HER 1ST EVER GUMBALL RALLY WHERE SHE MET HER NOW PARTNER-GUMBALL BOSS!\n\nEve now lives in the UK with her boyfriend who runs the infamous Gumball Car Rally. Comparing life in the UK vs USA? ‘’I still feel like a tourist in the UK and see something new daily. In the USA people recognize me easier so its not as easy for me to disappear. I know my American peeps are wrong about British food, the food is here if you know where to find it. The Sunday roasts and sticky toffee pudding is to die for!. I don’t cook myself though, I can do breakfast, my boyfriend gets excited when I finally get in the kitchen lol’’\n\nGoing into detail about her she got together with her English gent and issues with cross culture relationships she revealed ‘’Puma had asked me to do Gumball, I met my guy there, I’m all about experiences. With me and my guy it wasn’t planned, I was trying not to be in a relationship, Gumball was my way of escaping my last relationship. He and I met on the rd carpet, the rest of that week we were like ‘’hi’’. When we first got together it was like weird, id never dated a white guy, he had never dated black, we would just stare at each other. Now we’re planning a vacation for me and his 4 kids. The vibe between us is perfect; the problems only come from other ignorant people who are insecure. But I think I’m opening up conversations in the states about positive interracial dating. I thought cos he runs gumball he would be a player but he is such a committed family man, I need that stability. It’s a nice dynamic. I don’t believe in soul mates. I just go with feelings and emotions. He’s my go-to person, best friend and homie. My test for couples? if you can drive for hours together on a road trip and assemble Ikea furniture with no drama, then you’re good!\n\nJASMINE WITH EVE AND STYLIST TO THE STARS RICHARD SHOYEMI!\n\nOn that good note, we both looked up to find stylist to the stars Richard Shoyemi waiting for us with fresh raw fruit juices. Richard himself is a London based young black man really making moves with his very high profile clientele. I’ll be telling you all about him- next week!\n\nPREEYA KALIDAS BIRTHDAY DINNER\n\nPREEYA TAKES CENTRE STAGE AT HER BIRTHDAY DINNER AT RETRO FEAST!\n\nActress and musician Preeya Kalidas hit me on Friday morning with a last minute.com invitation to her birthday dinner that night at retro feast in old Burlington street. It’s a pop up restaurant that used to be the celeb filled, drug fuelled, and tabloid haunt of yesteryear-called Embassy.\n\nI rocked up punctually at 8pm as requested knowing Preeya is a great timekeeper and always 5 minutes early to anything I’ve ever invited her to. Arriving at the bar I was happy to spot our mutual friend Celena Cherry- lead singer of girl band The Honeyz. Also in the vicinity were singer Nate James, who would post dinner double up as DJ Nate James!. Other music peeps in the house included singer songwriter Celetia and performer Royston. Arriving together were PR lady Vanessa Amadi and her client/friend- Sugababe lead singer-Keisha Buchanan. Preeya arrived wearing a sexy short, backless red dress and 100inch vertiginous platform stilettos. She was smiling from ear to ear as the paparazzi outside snapped away at her. I noted that Preeya and Celena were both rocking red frocks and just as I was about to point it out to Celena she asked me ‘’why aren’t you wearing red? Preeya requested it’’. Huh? My text said nothing about red garms. Just as I was cussing Preeya for forgetting to tell me and simultaneously calling my other half to ask whether he’d bring one of my red numbers up when he arrived, I noted that the guests weren’t all adhering to that request and stuck to my cream ensemble. For a minute I had felt like the wedding guest who had turned up wearing white to insult the bride!\n\nWITH ACTRESS KAREN, BIRTHDAY LADY PREEYA AND HONEYZ LEAD LADY CELENA CHERRY!\n\nWe took our seats at the long dinner table and wolfed down the tasty food laid on by Retro Feast. Most of us had crab on toast to begin and steak to follow. Awkward moment when the waiter held aloft starters with a confused look and 2 of us shouted out ‘’we both have crabs! ‘LOL\n\nAll was washed down with their in-house cocktails and house wine. Then dessert was courtesy of Preeya’s friend Greg, who runs a healthy protein ice cream brand called WheyHey. (Only particular eater Preeya would have a healthy ice cream option lol!)\n\nPost dinner all were up and out of their chairs dancing until the early hours to old skool R&B whilst the paparazzi peeked through the dark night sky still getting shots of Preeya winding sexily up and down surrounded by all her mates. Happy birthday lady!\n\nON NOEL CLARKE’S LATEST FILM SET FOR THE ANOMALY WITH NOEL AND FRIENDS!\n\nNOEL CLARKE FILM SET – THE ANOMALY!\n\nOne hot afternoon actor director and friend noel Clarke invited myself and a group of friends down to his latest film set in east London for his new movie Sci Fi thriller, The ANOMALY. I finally found the studio in the depths of the east end world, where a film crew who had all been intensely hard at work since 6am that morning, to get those all important shots, were still looking intense and passionate, huddled around TV playback monitors. Noel had insisted we come on the Thursday. I soon found out why. One actress said ‘’ooh you should’ve come yesterday-we did all the naked scenes and all the actors were running around with just tiny g strings on’’!!!. I smiled at noel and accused him of holding out on us all. Oh how we laughed!. Noels right hand on the film- Phil- showed us around the sets and studios when the cameras weren’t rolling and it was truly fascinating to see all the intricate work and cost that goes into every few seconds of a film. Working in TV, we film fast and air fast. Film needs a lot more patience, something I don’t have much of. Noel was particularly fascinating to watch as he multitasked like a champion both directing his cast as well as himself. His fellow actor Ian Somerhalder (‘Damon’ from vampire diaries), was intense in his scenes with noel and it looks like the final cut will be a great piece of work especially watching the off-screen camaraderie between ian and noel bantering all day long.\n\nThe screenplay by Simon Lewis, follows the travails of a traumatized ex-soldier who wakes up in the back of a van, alongside a kidnapped boy, only to know he has less than ten minutes of consciousness to work out why and how he got there. On set I witness high intensity action, a bit of sexy time and a huge aircraft ready for action. Next week they all fly to New York to continue filming. Noel continues to graft hard and break down those barriers. Salute mister Clarke!\n\nWITH KING HOST OF COMEDY SHOWS- KOJO!\n\nUK KINGS OF COMEDY\n\nFinally I attended the Hackney Empire for the UK KINGS OF COMEDY show at the weekend, when my former presenter Kojo, who was hosting the weekend, invited me. The show was back-to-back laughs with the best of the best! Kicked off by Eddie Kadi, followed by my fave UK comic Slim, the line up was completed by Richard Blackwood. All the comedians had fresh, very current jokes about everyday topics. Subjects covered included Tulisa, the Woolwich tragedy, all cultural nationalities, relationships, government and so much more. Sitting right in front of me in the stalls were actresses Jocelyn gee and Tameka Epsom. Also in the house were Charlene White, Music star Angel, actor Freddie Kruger, R&B group Fundamental,\n\nYou have to hand it to the UK urban comedy circuit. Bigger and better than it’s ever been, with sold out venues all across the country, this scene has gone from pretty good in the nineties, to slick, professional and a sustainable business in 2013. These teams put on regular shows with the type of punctuality and professionalism I don’t recall from back in the day. The new #TEAMUK COMEDIANS are really killing it. Whether they are on mainstream TV doesn’t even matter any more. The black pound is being taken and kept in the community whilst the corporate broadcasters are making repeated reality fodder with no ratings. Hilarious. On every level. Especially these talented artists bank accounts!\n\nSARAH , ADE, JASMINE, RUDOLF AND SHONA!\n\nOn Sunday I was invited by one of my favourite actors, EastEnder’s Rudolph Walker OBE, to the launch of his 2013 Inter School Drama Awards (RWiSDA), which take place on the 14th July. RWiSDA was 1st pioneered in the 70’s in Brixton by this highly respected and much-loved actor. The awards take place between young people and schools nationally and internationally in a way that helps young people use their spare time in a positive way, offering an alternative to ‘hanging around’ after school and build young people’s confidence and self esteem.\n\nACTOR’S DIANE PARISH AND NITIN GANATRA AT RUDOLFS LAUNCH.\n\nThe launch, sponsored by Glen Insurance, was held at the award winning Parson’s Restaurant in Waltham Abbey run by chef Adebola Adeshina for a small intimate group of us and after a mouth watering dinner I sat down for the speeches and auction with the other guests who included Keith Vaz MP, , actors Jimmy Akingbola and Chizzy Akudolu from Holby City, EastEnders stars including Diane Parish, Lindsey Coulson and Nitin Ganatra, Martina Laird and Cyril Nri, Birmingham International Film Festival head Dean Alexander and comedy agent Sarah Moore. The auction raised £2,000 for the RWiSDAs, unfortunately I couldn’t persuade my friend to bid for the beautiful diamond necklace kindly donated by Diamond Thoughts. Rudolph’s beautiful daughter Sheona acted as auctioneer on the night and has clearly inherited his gift to entertain!\n\nRUDOLF TAKES THE MIC TO LAUNCH THE NIGHT!\n\nThe food which chef Ade presented was unique with twists to all usual options. There wasn’t one boring dish on the menu. On Fridays he makes a mean Chicken curry pot pie. Sometimes he pops a giant bone marrow on the plate too-which some people find offensive but he’s just trying to open their minds. People come from all over to attend Parsons –it’s a destination restaurant.\n\nHe puts it down to his Nigerian background where ‘’meat is important in every meal’’. Ade is very strict about changing up his menu every few weeks as he likes his food to be real and seasonal as opposed to genetically modified food.\n\nRudolph explained the inspiration behind his foundation. ‘‘In 1973 during height of TV shows like ‘Love thy neighbour’ we used to have the stop & search SUS Law. In those days I used to visit schools. Kids said to me ‘’we leave school and get stopped by police all the time and its really frustrating and hinders our lives’’. So I Launched a school competition for 2 Brixton schools where kids in groups of 10 would write, direct and perform their own play. Their school selected the 3 best to enter into the competition. There were Prizes for the best. This lasted for 4-5 years but then ended as housing estates took over the schools’’.\n\n‘’The competition is back now though and in its 3rd year and we continue to have phenomenal feedback from schools and teachers. There was a slight hitch when in the 1st year some of the boys set off fire alarm, which delayed things, but it still happened. It’s about giving them self focus and confidence”\n\nRudolph wants to take it the foundation nationally and internationally and want youth to have the focus and confidence to take responsibi"
