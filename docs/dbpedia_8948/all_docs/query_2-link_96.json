        "text": "Ok… I’m back and now I will post about the girls’ (PCD) lives and careers.\n\nOk, now let’s start with… Ahh! Here’s one:Nicole… Scherzinger. Yeah. Nicole Scherzinger, the PCD’s lead singer.\n\n*NICOLE SCHERZINGER*\n\nScherzinger was born in Honolulu to a Filipino father and a Hawaiian/Russian mother. Her mother Rosemary was eighteen at the time of Scherzinger’s birth and lived in an inner city neighborhood and separated from her father when she was a baby. The family moved to Louisville, Kentucky when she was six years old, with her sister Ke’ala and stepfather Gary Scherzinger. She stated she had a “conservative Catholic” upbringing. Scherzinger began her life as a performer in Louisville, attending the Youth Performing Arts School at duPont Manual High School and performing with Actors Theatre of Louisville. Scherzinger majored in theater arts at Wright State University but put her studies on hold in 1999 to sing backing vocals for the rock band Days of the New.\n\nScherzinger appeared on the second album by Days of the New, released in 1999. She also recorded two songs with Barry Drake’s F.O.B, which were released in 2001. In 2001, Scherzinger competed in the premiere season of The WB’s television show Popstars, on which she earned a spot in the all-girl pop group Eden’s Crush. She became one of the main vocalists for the group. The group’s 2001 single “Get Over Yourself (Goodbye)” peaked at number one in sales and hit the top ten on Billboard Hot 100. “Love This Way” was the second went on to co-write with Scherzinger for PCD, Doll Domination and Her Name Is Nicole.\n\nIn November 2007, Scherzinger spoke of her time in Eden’s Crush\n\n“ …It was hell… I was in a band with five other girls and every day was torture for me. We were on TV all the time and the atmosphere was awful…. Every day I was in that band I cried my eyes out. The band was meant to be fun and frivolous but the reality was that it was miserable…. I was too sensitive back then, but I got toughened up. I couldn’t have gone into the Dolls without my experience in Crush. ”\n\nAfter the disbanding of Eden’s Crush, Scherzinger made a few promotional solo appearances under the stage name of Nicole Kea, including covering “Breakfast in Bed” for the soundtrack to 50 First Dates in 2003. This track was produced by Nick Hexum who was her boyfriend for three years.\n\nScherzinger worked with Yoshiki of Japanese rock band X Japan on in his Violet UK project. She sang the English version of “I’ll Be Your Love” live with the Tokyo Symphonic Orchestra. The track also appeared on the 2003 Various Artists album Exposition of Global Harmony.\n\nIn May 2003, Scherzinger joined the Pussycat Dolls burlesque troupe, who were being re-cast as recording artists. She had first seen them performing on The Late Show with David Letterman in November 2002, where Carmen Electra sang “Big Spender” from the Bob Fosse musical Sweet Charity. In 2006, Scherzinger said “It caught my eye because I’d played Velma Kelly in [Fosse’s] Chicago in college.” The Pussycat Dolls now have world-wide status as a popular singing group, with “Don’t Cha”, “Buttons”, “Stickwitu” and “When I Grow Up” as Top 10 hits in the U.S.. The album PCD went double-platinum in 2006. Scherzinger sang nearly all lead vocals on the album, with Carmit Bachar and Melody Thornton also contributing.\n\nScherzinger on stage with the Pussycat DollsScherzinger is the only group member with songwriting credits on PCD; she co-wrote “I Don’t Need a Man” with Kara DioGuardi and producer Rich Harrison, and co-wrote “Buttons” with producer Sean Garrett. Another collaboration with DioGuardi, “Flirt”, became a B-side to “Stickwitu” and a bonus track on PCD.\n\nBirth name: Nicole Elikolani Prescovia Valiente\n\nAlso known as Nicole Kea\n\nBorn: June 29, 1978 (1978-06-29) (age 30)\n\nHonolulu, Hawaii, United States\n\nGenre(s): Pop, dance-pop, R&B, hip hop\n\nOccupation(s): Singer, songwriter, dancer, actress, model\n\nYears active: 2001–present\n\nLabel(s) Polydor, A&M, Interscope\n\nAssociated acts: Pussycat Dolls, Days of the New, Timbaland, Sean Combs, Keri Hilson, T.I., Will.I.Am, Sean Garrett, Will Smith, Nelly, Rihanna\n\nWebsite: http://www.hernameisnicole.com\n\nOk… now we’re done with Nicole… The next one is… let’s see… Ahh! here’s my favorite: Melody…Thorton.

After three years of performing with the burlesque group she moved on to join the recording Pussycat Dolls along with members Nicole Scherzinger, Melody Thornton, Jessica Sutta and Kimberly Wyatt. As with the other group members she is a salaried employee of Interscope Records.

Her mother is Catholic.\n\nShe came to the attention of choreographer Robin Antin, who cast her with the Pussycat Dolls in 2002. As with all the other Dolls, Sutta is a salaried employee of Interscope Records. She is nicknamed “Pin-up Doll” for her pin-up styles.\n\nSutta on stage with the Pussycat DollsSutta sang co-lead along with Carmit Bachar and Ashley Roberts in the “Stickwitu” single b-side, “Santa Baby”.\n\nAfter the departure of Carmit Bachar from the group, Sutta took the parts that Bachar used to sing.

Prior to her departing the group, both Bachar and Melody Thornton used to co-lead with Nicole Scherzinger, and after Bachar’s departure, Sutta and Thornton now co-lead with Scherzinger.\n\nShe also recorded a solo song “If I Was A Man” like all the Pussycat Dolls for the Deluxe Edition of their second studio album Doll Domination.

But if you want me to include the old members, ok fine!\n\n~~~ OLD MEMBERS OF PCD~~~\n\nWait… Hold up!!! There’s an old member that I won’t (and can’t) include because she doesnt have an article in Wikipedia. Her name is Kaya Jones. She has been active in the PCD for 2 years (2003-2004) so sorry that I cant include her. But search for her anywhere if you like.\n\n*CARMIT BACHAR*\n\nBachar was born in Los Angeles, her father is Israeli and her mother is of Dutch, Indonesian, and Chinese descent. She was raised in Encino, California. Both parents were dancers; her mother worked as a dance teacher and her father worked with Elvis Presley and Marcel Marceau. Bachar competed internationally as a rhythmic gymnast for 10 years, and placed 5th in the U.S. Olympic trials in 1992. During her career competing on the U.S. National Team, she attended Hamilton Academy of Music in Los Angeles, studying music, dance, piano and viola.\n\nBachar joined the Pussycat Dolls in 1995 while they were a burlesque show. She was a member of the Dolls longer than any other performer. Most of the current members, including lead singer Nicole Scherzinger and Melody Thornton, were casted by founder Robin Antin in 2002 or 2003, when the group was being transformed into pop recording artists. As with the other Dolls, she was a salaried employee of Interscope Records.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, she toured with the Dolls in support of their multi-million selling album PCD. She was one of the three main lead vocalists in the group.\n\nIn February 2008, reports surfaced that she was leaving the Pussycat Dolls to pursue solo projects. On March 8, 2008, Carmit officially announced her departure from the Pussycat Dolls on the group’s official website.[2]\n\nMelody Thornton gave Bachar special thanks in the ‘Thank You’ section of The Pussycat Doll’s newest album ‘Doll Domination’.\n\nBorn: September 4, 1974 (1974-09-04) (age 34)\n\nOrigin Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nGenre(s): Pop, pop rock, R&B, dance\n\nOccupation(s): Singer, dancer\n\nYears active: 1995 – March of 2008\n\nLabel(s): A&M (2004 – 2008)\n\nCheyenne, Polydor (2001 – 2002)\n\n*ASIA NITOLLANO*\n\nNote:This girl was NOT one of the orginal PCD. Just read the article to find out why.\n\nNitollano is the daughter of R&B musician Joe Bataan and has a four-year-old daughter. She has African-American, Filipino, and Puerto Rican ancestry. Before her entry into the group, Nitollano was a dancer for the New York Knicks. In 2007 she became one of the nine finalists on the CW reality television series, Pussycat Dolls Present: The Search for the Next Doll. During the season finale of the show, she was chosen to become the newest member of the group by judges Robin Antin, Ron Fair and Lil Kim. According to judge and Pussycat Doll founder Robin Antin, while Nitollano wasn’t the strongest vocalist of the final three, she had greater stage presence and is an all-round better performer due to her experience in dancing.\n\nIn July 2007, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Nitollano, who was never contractually obligated to join the Pussycat Dolls, had decided to embark on a solo career. According to Dawn Ostroff, head of the CW Network, Nitollano was not fired from the group, but opted to go solo after the final episode of the show was aired or in short, after the season was completely filmed in the summer of 2006. Nitollano’s position in the group had been questioned for months, since she had never performed with the group (except on the finale of the show) and has been absent from the group’s high-profile performances, most notably Live Earth, held in July 2007.\n\nShe has appeared in adverts for P. Diddy’s clothing line Sean John Women’s collection.\n\nAs of July 2008 her MySpace page states she is working on a solo album. She is currently signed to Murder Inc.\n\nAsia quitted the group becaus she said she wasn’t ready to be one of the PCD.\n\nI’ll give a last article about the PCD’s competition where Asia joined and won.\n\n>>>Pussycat Dolls Present: The Search For The Next Doll<<<\n\nContestants:Brittany Diiorio\n\nJaime Benjamin\n\nSisely Treasure\n\nMariela Arteaga\n\nAnastacia Rose McPherson\n\nMelissa Smith\n\nChelsea Rocka\n\nMelissa Reyes\n\nAsia Notillano\n\nBrittany Diiorio entered the competition at the age of 20. It has been suggested that a vague similarity to Jessica also prevented Brittany’s advancement in the show. Originally from Chesapeake, Virginia, Brittany now lives in Virginia Beach, managing a night club and pursuing a dancing, singing, and modeling career. Brittany now goes by the name Danielle Diiorio (Dani D) to avoid comparisons to Britney Spears and has undergone a major look change and has released three songs on her Myspace called Let me Breathe, Girlfriend and Higher. She later replaced them with another one called Non-Exclusive. She has also been on the cover of Way too social Magazine.\n\nAt the age of 21, Jaime Benjamin originally from Philadelphia, now lives in NYC and works as a production assistant.. Some say Jaime was eliminated too suddenly, possibly prompted by her resemblance to both Kimberly and Ashley. Following her elimination, she stated her favorite experience on the show was getting ready to perform on stage in front of a live audience. Jaime is currently negotiating a record deal with major labels for her CD. She has recently created a Music Myspace where she released a sneak preview of it containing 4 songs: Fame, Lifetime and Lovin’ me (normal and Hell’s Kitchen mix version),. She has also posted several videos on Youtube including song performances and sneak peeks, thank you to fans and silly videos (sometime with Melissa R.). She has proven to be quite popular, being ranked 3rd on the CW Lounge, while being 8th on the show. She also performed solo at Sony in NYC on August’s 17th\n\nThe oldest of the group was Sisely Treasure (24). Former member of Cooler Kids, she lives in Los Angeles, working as a dance instructor. Sisely, has released 3 songs on her Myspace: Smoke and Ashes, The Other side and Do the Robot, although the former two have since been removed. She and her group (Sisely Treasure and the Safety Pin-ups) are also selling a limited edition of Do the Robot on Teen Acide records. She is now a dancing performer in the group Gunn Metal Grey under the name Luci Glitoris Since early 2008, Sisley has been tapped as the new lead singer of electronic rock band Shiny Toy Guns. She co-wrote and recorded with them for their second album, Season of Poison, and is touring with them throughout the fall.\n\nMariela Arteaga resides in Miami, Florida and was 21 when she entered the competition.\n\nPrior to the series, Anastacia Rose McPherson from West Hollywood, was a backup dancer for The Pussycat Dolls’ music video “Don’t Cha.“ Ironically, in a post-show interview, the 23-year-old named her final performance, a burlesque themed act, as her favorite performance. She worked as a make-up artist and song lyricist. Anastacia has released 4 songs on her new Myspace Music page called: Share, Checkin you out, Get Away and I want in Anastacia has also worked as a backstage interviewer at SmackDown!, making her debut at on the 12th October show, until her release from the company shortly after on the 8 January 2008. She also appears in Famouz’s video for Wriggle. Anastacia has also had an appearance on a new game show called “Duel” as a “chip girl” where she hands out and takes away the chips of the contestants.\n\nMelissa Smith (24) is an aspiring singer, dancer, and actress in Los Angeles. She was also a contestant in Making The Band 3 but didn’t make the girl group Danity Kane. She has starred in TV shows, theatre shows and independent films. She also has appeared in music videos for Celine Dion and JC Chasez whilst appearing in many commercials. She has done promotional modeling for Miss Fitness, Detroit Automotive Show, Microsoft, Xbox, Sketcher and Dickies Girls. She hosted the Detroit auditions of Pussycat Dolls Present: Girlicious Season 2. She has recorded two songs ‘So Hot’ and ‘Maybe’ and released her first single called ‘I Believed’ on 10th June 2008 to iTunes, she also released a music video which includes another song ‘Lost in Love’ at the beginning. She is signed to 4847 Records.\n\nMiss West Broward USA 2007, Chelsea Korka (20) is rumoured to have a 4 octave vocal range just as Christina Aguilera. Rumours speculate that Chelsea’s resemblance to Jessica was why she was eliminated, despite her vocals or state that her vocals might be undesirable because they could upstage Nicole, the PCD lead singer. Chelsea has released two songs on her myspace site: “Give Me A Sign” and “Better Than”. She is also expected to perform at the Las Vegas PCD Lounge with both Melody Thornton and Robin Antin, making her the first contestant to officially perform with the PCD outside the show.\n\nRunner-up Melissa Reyes (18) appeared in Paris Hilton’s Promo Tour 2006, as Pilot/Series Regular in Nickelodeon’s Giggle Club, Paris Hilton’s video Nothing in this World (as a cheerleader cameo), Mariah Carey’s video Get Your Number (cameo), B5’s video You Got Me (as a featured girl), Lil’ Romeo’s video My Girlfriend (cameo) and Keak da Sneak’s video 3 Freaks (cameo) Melissa was also in Corbin Bleu’s video, “Deal With It” and NLT’s video, “That Girl” dancing with V. Online rumours accuse Robin Antin of a tendency to choose Asia over Melissa R. because of Melissa R.’s uncanny resemblance to Nicole (both are of Filipino descent). She was Audrey Magazine’s cover girl for the June/July issue, which included a five-page article titled A Real Doll where she states that she hopes to become a recognized artist. She went on to appear on musical videos such as Corbin Bleu’s “Deal With It” (filmed before the show’s airing), Marques Houston’s “Wonderful”, in all of which she plays the singer’s love interest and in NLT (band)’s “That Girl” where she was one of the four love interest. She has also appeared in some Keshia Chanté videos, such as Let the Music Take You while she was in Toronto Canada. She has been a special guest at the Northern California dance contest in Hayward, CA where she gave a pre-show performance. She has an album underway and has released two songs on iTunes. She is scheduled to play the lead part in a television show called ‘Unity’ , as a character names Melissa, coincidentally. The pilot will air near the end of 2008.\n\nWinner Asia Nitollano (18) is a young mother to a baby daughter; she and the father are still together, despite her being promoted on the show as a single mom. Some fans of Melissa R. and Chelsea have made the popular assumption that Asia was chosen on purely an image point of view, as Nicole is the only Pussycat Doll who sings consistently. After being declared the winner of The Search for the Next Doll several online rumours surfaced that claimed Asia was kicked out of the group due to lack of musical ability, others claimed the other dolls couldn’t deal with her diva attitude. As a final verdict to discredit the rumours, CW’s head of programming, Dawn Orstroff explained that, though Asia was not booted out of the group, she will not be the next doll, because in an overtly bold move, she skipped all the way to pursuing a solo career. However, lack of confirmation by either Robin Antin or the Pussycat Dolls themselves have caused many fans to wonder if Asia’s split with the group was completely her own decision. Some fans also point out the inconsistency of Asia’s claims throughout the show of how much she wanted to be the next doll against the decision to go solo before even one tour or album with the Dolls. Critics point out that fans of Asia will definitely be disappointed as they will not be seeing her on stage nor purchasing one of her albums for a while because she has not been signed.\n\nAfter the show Melissa Smith, Melissa Reyes and Chelsea Korka performed the Pink Panther/Fever Medley with the English burlesque group Girlesque at the Fashion cares event,this has led fans to believe that they had started a group which turned out to be false.\n\nBrittany Diiorio, Sisely Treasure, Mariela Arteaga, Melissa Smith and Melissa Reyes have all been temporary members of the Paradiso Girls at some point but all have left since. In July 2007 Antin offered Korka to be part of the final line-up, consisting of her and 4 original members (Aria Crescendo, Lauren Bennett, Kelly and Shar). They will be releasing their first album next year under Interscope Records and will be a pop/dance-pop/RnB girl group. Each girl represents a country and the group has no lead singer unlike the Pussycat Dolls.\n\n<<>>\n\n1st episode:Kelli, Ewa, Jasmin, Natascha, Robyn, Anjelia, Sandra, Shauntae, Catherine\n\n2nd episode:Brittany\n\n3rd episode:Jaime\n\n4th episode:Sisely\n\n5th episode:Mariela\n\n6th episode:Anastacia\n\n7th episode:Melissa Smith\n\n8th episode:Chelsea and Melissa Reyes\n\nWINNER:Asia\n\nSo there, world!!!
