The people in this thread are not saying that they’re only Asian, they’re just calling attention to their Asian blood since they do not appear to have any. I'm simply saying calling these celebrities Asian is really that big of a deal because it depends on the individual of what they consider an Asian person. We have few Asian celebrities overseas so I can absolutely understand the pride that some Soompiers have when they discover that the celebrities they recognize (especially in American entertainment industry) have Asian descent.\n\nNana: I think you misunderstood what I was trying to say. You are right that these celebrities are mixed and are not only Asian, but we can already tell that Tiger Woods has African American blood in him & Mark Paul Gosselaar has Caucasian blood, so it’s not entirely necessary to point that out. The thread starter wants to emphasize that they have Asian blood too, and the term “mixed” is too general and misses the point the thread starter is trying to make. I mentioned Obama and Cecilia because generally people don’t refer to Obama or Cecilia as “mixed”, only as African American and Asian, but very few have problems with that. Obama has as much African American descent as maybe half of those listed here have of Asian descent.\n\nI understand what you guys are saying, and you both make good points.\n\nCe’nedra: Normally, I would call the celebrities listed as mixed as well, but my issue is the controversy over calling them Asian.

Obama has as much African American descent as maybe half of those listed here have of Asian descent.\n\nIn that case, I agree with you\n\nI think the reason why me and a few others seem like we're jumping onto such a trivial matter (considering it's simply a fun thread online) is the fact that soompi is known to be quite a 'Eurasian-obsessed' forum and you can see the tip of the iceberg emerging (not amongst everyone, but some). Still, I don't think there's much to be proud about for someone like Kate Beckinsale if the reason for being proud is due to her distant Asian heritage. It would defeat the purpose because I'm sure Hollywood didn't recruit her because of that. I highly doubt she stands for anything Asian in Hollywood. A typical Asian girl/woman would not be able to relate to her as an Asian woman.\n\nAbout Obama, I do think it's unfair that Obama is viewed upon only as a black man. Again, it goes back to the \"one drop\" rule and that's a very ignorant viewpoint. He is as much a white man as he is a black man (he is half half after all) but because of his colour, mainstream society won't see beyond that. On the flipside, I do get the feeling that Obama identifies himself as simply a black man (I could be wrong) so if he does, then I guess we should respect that.\n\nAnd like I said already, Cecilia is technically mixed, but she is predominantly Chinese (75% ...I hate to write in percentages, doesn't feel right but whatever) so of course she'll be viewed as an Asian (I would think it's offensive if she WASN'T considered Asian by people). I think a more fitting example would be Michelle Reis who is as much white as she is Asian.\n\nAnyway, I'm starting to sound VERY repetitive so I'll stop at that lol."
