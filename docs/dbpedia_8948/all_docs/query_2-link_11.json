        "text": "You may know Carmit Bachar as one of the original members of the multi-platinum, Grammy nominated, recording group The Pussycat Dolls!, who rose to international fame as an overnight pop sensation with chart-topping hit singles including “Don’t Cha,” “Buttons,” and “StickWitU.”\n\nWhile making her mark in the arts, she has also been recognized as an ambassador for Operation Smile, a medical charity that provides cleft lip and palate repair surgeries to children worldwide. Inspired by her own experience of being born with the condition, she hopes to help raise awareness about the importance of building self-esteem and inspiring the imaginations of these children through the arts and activities.\n\nCreative stimulation can build imagination, which results in freedom and full expression. “I truly believe that each of us must give back and create community to overcome the stigma and challenges associated with many different causes,” says Carmit. “Being born with cleft lip and palate has given me a direct purpose. As I have been so fortunate, I am filled with the desire to share and give back. I have been able to live my dreams of performing all over the world, so it’s only natural that I want to reach children through my passion for creative arts. It builds self-esteem and acceptance for ones uniqueness as well. The arts have truly changed my life, and now my mission is to inspire children to smile with me!” How can I be a part of this, you ask? Get involved and buy a m.a.m.a. e a r t h wish bracelet to help fund the missions that change lives. Let’s explore the endless possibilities of spreading compassion and love! Let’s go!\n\nCarmit Bachar is one of the most visible dancers in the industry today having toured with acts like No Doubt, Janet Jackson, Black Eyed Peas and Beyonce. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Carmit is of Israeli, Dutch, Indonesian, and Chinese descent and comes from a family of entertainers. Carmit’s creativity and passion for dance, music, performing and true artistry led her to another venture in 2001 that she co-founded called “The Zodiac Show,” which began as an underground live performance event. Carmit has hosted, performed in and co-produced this refreshingly unique event for six years at some of Hollywood’s biggest venues, gaining the respect and admiration of many celebrities and creatives in the entertainment industry. She is truly an amazing woman and hot m.a.m.a., no doubt!\n\nm.a.m.a. e a r t h thanks Carmit for supporting m.a.m.a. e a r t h’s mission from the beginning. She has graced the m.a.m.a. e a r t h stage several times, once with a duet of Bob Marley’s “Turn Your Lights Down Low” with Bruno Mars.\n\nWe also congratulate her on the rite of passage into motherhood with her beautiful baby daughter on the way!"
