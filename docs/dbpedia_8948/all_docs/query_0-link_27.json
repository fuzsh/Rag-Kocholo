        "text": "The Pussycat Dolls were an American girl group consisting of Nicole Scherzinger, Carmit Bachar, Jessica Sutta, Kimberly Wyatt, Ashley Roberts, and Melody Thornton. The group was founded in 1995 by Robin Antin in Los Angeles, California as a burlesque troupe. They released their debut single, \"Sway\", from the soundtrack for Shall We Dance?.\n\nThe Dolls achieved worldwide success with their debut album, PCD, which spawned several hit singles such as \"Don't Cha\", \"Buttons\", \"Stickwitu\", and \"Beep\". The group achieved further success with their second studio album, Doll Domination, and had the hit singles, \"When I Grow Up\", \"I Hate This Part\" and \"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\".\n\nIn 2010, the group officially disbanded after completing their second world tour. The group was plagued by internal conflict due to the emphasis on Scherzinger, the group's lead vocalist, and the subordinate treatment of the other members, which led to the end of the Pussycat Dolls. In 2019, the group reunited for a reunion performance on the The X Factor: Celebrity and announced their reunion tour, as well as a new album. Thornton was involved in the discussions of the reunion but chose to focus on her solo career. The tour was set to begin in 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After several more delays and a lawsuit between Antin and Scherzinger, the tour was officially cancelled in 2022, which left the group's fate uncertain.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Dolls previously started as a burlesque group created by choreographer, Robin Antin back in 1995. The other members included Carmit Bachar, Kasey Campbell, Cyia Batten, Staci Flood, and Nadine Ellis. The group would regularly feature celebrity members such as Carmen Electra, Christina Aguilera, and Gwen Stefani. It was later formed as a music group with Jessica Sutta, Ashley Roberts, Kimberly Wyatt, Batten, and Campbell hired as dancers, and who were all from the burlesque group. Four vocalists were hired, Bachar, from the original burlesque group, Nicole Scherzinger, Melody Thornton, and Kaya Jones. Kaya, Cyia, and Kasey left the group before the release of the group’s first studio album, PCD, while Robin became the group's manager. The album included hit singles such as \"Don't Cha\", \"Buttons\", \"Stickwitu\", and \"Beep\", as well as having guest appearances from Timbaland and will.i.am. They went on their first world tour, the PCD World Tour.\n\nThe group went on hiatus after the tour. In 2008, Carmit announced her departure from the group and Jessica took over as third vocalist. The band released their second album, Doll Domination in 2008. The Dolls’ embarked on their second world tour, the Doll Domination Tour, and toured North America as the opening act for The Circus Starring Britney Spears. Around this time, displeasure within the group occurred and each Doll announced their departures from the group and the group officially disbanded in 2010. Ten years later, the Dolls announced their reunion and performed on the X Factor UK and released their comeback single, \"React\" in 2020. However, Melody did not return to the Dolls to continue to focus on her solo career. The Dolls were set to embark on their tour, Unfinished Business, but it was postponed due to the ongoing 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDisbandment\n\nDuring the groups's second world tour, Sutta suffered a back injury and was sent home for the rest of the tour. After the conclusion of the tour, each member announced their departures from the group, leaving Scherzinger as the last member standing.\n\nReunion\n\nIn October 2017, social media sites were set up for a reunion. On April 25, 2018, during an appearance on The Chris Ramsey Show, Wyatt claimed that the band could reunite before the end of 2018. \"We're all just in a place where we're kind of ready to live it all again, and make it fun and enjoy it and everything,\" she said. \"So yeah, we're looking at the possibilities.\"\n\nLater in September 2019, Entertainment Tonight reported that Scherzinger has joined former members of the Pussycat Dolls for new studio sessions and the band would be reuniting for a \"greatest hits\" tour in 2020.\n\nOn November 28, 2019, the group then confirmed their reunion on British radio station Heart, confirming that Bachar, Roberts, Scherzinger, Sutta, and Wyatt had been recording new music and have announced nine tour dates around the United Kingdom in 2020, with their The Pussycat Dolls Tour. It has been expanded to include dates in Australia and New Zealand. During the interview, Scherzinger remarked that it had been around ten years since the group's last tour and that the time felt right, \"it's been a long time coming, but this feels like the perfect time to remind the world what it means to be a Pussycat Doll.\" According to group founder Robin Antin, Thornton would not be taking part due to her feeling like the time was not right. The group have stated that they are leaving the door open for Thornton and she would be welcome back if she decided to join them later down the line.' The tour, however, was pushed back to 2021 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSecond disbandment\n\nIt was reported in September 2021 that Antin had sued Scherzinger over a dispute with the contract that had originally been signed for the reunion tour. According to court documents, Scherzinger refused to do the tour and had wanted an increase of 75% of the profits as opposed to the 49% she had agreed to, as well as requesting full creative control. Filed documents showed that Scherzinger committed to 45 shows and would receive 32.5% of earnings from the tour, with Sutta, Wyatt, Roberts, and Antine each reaching 12.5% and Bachar receiving 5% reflecting her departure before the group's second album. The legal dispute came from Scherzinger wanting to negotiate the terms of PCD Worldwide, a new business venture that would handle future earning from the group and brand from existing terms of 49% to an increased 75%, to reflect \"opportunities she would have to forego to continue to engage in the partnership with Antin and the band as her reason for demanding a bigger share\".\n\nScherzinger's lawyer claimed that Antin received a $600,000 advance from Live Nation to support the tour and accused her of \"trading on Nicole's name without her consent\".\n\nAfter the report of the lawsuit, in January 2022, Scherzinger confirmed the tour's cancellation on Instagram, quoting the COVID-19 pandemic as the reasoning. However, all the other members have stated they had no idea about the cancellation until seeing Scherzinger's post online. Bachar and Sutta released their own joint statement saying \"We want to say how incredibly disappointed we are to learn of an announcement made on Instagram that The Pussycat Dolls reunion tour is canceled. As of now, there has been no official notification of that.\" Wyatt has expressed she had \"done all [she] can\", as she was the motivator for the reunion for years. She confirmed that both she and Roberts still wanted the tour to happen. Wyatt also said she found out through Twitter while she was competing on Dancing on Ice.\n\nMembers\n\nDiscography\n\nPCD\n\nDoll Domination\n\nTours\n\nHeadlining\n\nPCD World Tour\n\nDoll Domination Tour\n\nSupporting\n\nHonda Civic Tour\n\nBack to Basics Tour\n\nThe Circus Starring Britney Spears\n\nCancelled\n\nUnfinished Business\n\nGallery"
