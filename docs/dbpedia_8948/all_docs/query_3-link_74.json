        "text": "The cancellation of Pussycat Dolls’ upcoming tour came as quite a surprise to fellow group members Carmit Bachar and Jessica Sutta, who say they first learned of the cancellation via Nicole Scherzinger’s Instagram post.\n\nOn Friday, Scherzinger shared the news via a statement on her personal account: “Thank you to everyone who had tickets to see PCD â we are so appreciative of your support and loyalty!Â With the ever evolving circumstances surrounding the pandemic, I understand the decision that the tour dates had to be cancelled. I have invested a huge amount of time, creative energy and my own finances into bringing this project back to life, and while I’m naturally incredibly saddened by this decision, I am also very proud of what we were able to achieve in the short amount of time we had together before COVID.Â I can’t put into words the amount of love, admiration and gratitude I have for the other girls in the group, and the fans that have supported us. Stay safe and healthy – Love and blessings.â\n\nHowever group members Bachar, Sutta, Ashley Roberts and Kimberly Wyatt, say they were shocked to hear the news. Sutta and Bachar claimed that Scherzinger did not share with them the decision to end the tour prior to her public statement, saying: “We want to say how incredibly disappointed we are to learn of an announcement made on Instagram that the Pussycat Dolls reunion tour is canceled. As of now, there has been no official notification of that. Either way, it seems as though it’s the end of a chapter to an incredible, life altering experience filled with some awesome memories that we will forever be grateful for. To the fans, we love you. Trust us, this is not the outcome we had hoped for. We wanted it as much as you because we appreciate you all so much and it hurts our hearts you had to wait so long for an answer, but unfortunately it’s out of our control.âÂ They concluded:Â âThank you to all the fans that supported us unconditionally and love us to no end. We will always honor the essence of what the true definition of being a Pussycat Doll is. This tour may have come to an end but it is not the end of the Dolls story. We created a sisterhood that will live on…”\n\nThe Pussycat Dolls reunited in 2019; however due to the coronavirus pandemic, both the tour and new music were sidelined. In 2021, Scherzinger was also sued by the group’s founder, Robin Antin, for alleged breach of contract.\n\nEditorial credit: s_bukley / Shutterstock.com"
