        "text": "Not to be confused with Melanie Thornton.\n\nMelody Thornton (born September 28, 1984) is an American singer and television personality. After graduating high school, Thornton became one of the main vocalists of the pop girl group the Pussycat Dolls and released the albums PCD (2005) and Doll Domination (2008) becoming one of the world's best-selling girl groups. As part of the group, she has received a Grammy Award nomination.\n\nFollowing her departure from the group in 2010, Thornton independently released a mixtape, P.O.Y.B.L (2012), and an EP, Lioness Eyes (2020). Outside her music, she has competed on reality shows, Popstar to Operastar (2011), Dancing on Ice (2019) and won the fourth season of the Australian version of The Masked Singer (2022). She has also done several stage works, including playing Rachel Marron in the musical The Bodyguard.\n\nEarly life\n\nMelody Thornton is a native of Phoenix, Arizona and was born on September 28, 1984, to a family of Mexican and African-American descent. She was educated in Camelback High School. Her first performance was at her school, where she sang \"This Little Light of Mine\" at the age of six, and continued to perform at local talent shows in Arizona. After high school, she majored in music engineering for one semester.\n\nCareer\n\n2003–2010: The Pussycat Dolls\n\nMain article: The Pussycat Dolls\n\nAt the age of 19, Thornton traveled to Burbank, California to audition for the Pussycat Dolls. The group's founder Robin Antin, struck a deal with Interscope Geffen A&M Records' Jimmy Iovine to develop the Pussycat Dolls into a brand and create a separate recording pop group. Thornton was selected to strengthen their vocal ability and joined Carmit Bachar, Ashley Roberts, Nicole Scherzinger, Jessica Sutta, and Kimberly Wyatt, and signed a contract with the Pussycat Dolls partnership, receiving a percentage of the group's revenues. Thornton along with Bachar supplied vocals as secondary vocalists, while Scherzinger assumed the majority of the vocals as the lead singer. Thornton was the youngest and the only member who did not have a background in dance. The group released their first single, \"Don't Cha\" (featuring Busta Rhymes), which stands as group's most successful single to date peaked number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and reached the top in other 15 countries. Thornton didn't like the song in the beginning, as she found too controversial. They released their self-titled debut album in September 2005. Subsequent singles, \"Stickwitu and \"Buttons\" also reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. PCD went on to sell seven million copies worldwide and established the Pussycat Dolls as viable in the music industry earning them a reputation among the century's few breakout successes.\n\nThornton was featured on Jibbs' single \"Go Too Far\", which was released on March 2007; it entered the top-twenty on the New Zealand Singles Chart. Their second and final studio album Doll Domination was released in September 2008, the album attained its highest peak position on the US Billboard 200, but it is considered a commercial disappointment selling less than 400,000 copies in the US. Doll Domination included the singles \"When I Grow Up\" and \"I Hate This Part\", which reached the top twenty on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. In January 2009, the group embarked on the Doll Domination Tour, their second headlining concert tour, which highlighted stops in Europe, Oceania and Asia, and grossed over $14 million. Following the release of the group's single 2009 \"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\", tensions in the group rose due to Scherzinger being billed as a featured artist on the release. This would go on to lead to a public outburst by Thornton during the group's tour appearance while opening for The Circus Starring Britney Spears. The group would then announce a hiatus towards the end of the year.\n\nThornton then appeared as a panelist on E!'s Bank of Hollywood in which contestants must appeal to a celebrity panel to receive money. It lasted for one season. In June 2010, Thornton confirmed she had departed the Pussycat Dolls and was working on a solo album.\n\n2011–present: Independent releases, television, and stage work\n\nMain article: P.O.Y.B.L\n\nSince her departure from the group, Thornton has remained an independent artist. In June 2011 she participated in the second series of Popstar to Operastar, a British television programme in which pop stars were trained to sing opera; she was eliminated in the third week. The same month she released her debut single \"Sweet Vendeta\" which preceded the release of her debut mixtape, P.O.Y.B.L (Piss On Your Black List), the following year. It contains ten tracks which consistst of five covers and four songs solely written by Thornton. In 2013 she collaborated with Bizzy Crook, LL Cool J, and Prince Kay One for their respective albums released that year.\n\nIn 2017, Thornton returned to British television by appearing on the second series of Celebs Go Dating and Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls. She then landed the lead role of Rachel Marron in the musical The Bodyguard, which toured in China for several months. In 2019, Thornton was eliminated on the eight-week and placed fifth on the eleventh series of Dancing on Ice. This was followed with stage roles on Rip It Up – The 70s, a show inspired by music of the 70s and played the part of Cinderella in the New Wimbledon Theatre production of the family pantomime, Cinderella. Thornton opted out to join the November reunion of the Pussycat Dolls in order to focus on her solo endeavors. She collaborated with UK DJ producer Harrison on the dance track \"Freak Like Me\" and released her first solo track in seven years, \"Love Will Return\". A ballad that is a nod to her heritage and serves as the lead single for her debut EP, Lioness Eyes. The EP, which includes seven songs was released on August 7.\n\nIn 2022, Thornton competed and won the fourth season of the Australian version of The Masked Singer as \"Mirrorball\" and the following year reprised her role as Rachel Marron in the 2023 UK and Ireland production of the musical The Bodyguard.\n\nIn February 2024, Thornton participated in the fifth series of The Masked Singer UK as the character \"Maypole\". She was eliminated and unmasked in the sixth episode.\n\nArtistry and musical style\n\nThornton was inspired to sing after her father's favorite artists, B. B. King, Aretha Franklin, and The Jacksons. In another interview, she named Mariah Carey as a vocal inspiration. Her vocals were likened to Christina Aguilera's.\n\nDiscography\n\nExtended plays\n\nList of extended plays, with track listings Title Album details Lioness Eyes\n\nReleased: August 7, 2020\n\nLabel: Self-released\n\nFormats: Streaming\n\nTrack listing\n\n1. \"Pray For Me\"\n\n2. \"Goodbye To Happiness\"\n\n3. \"Love Will Return\"\n\n4. \"Sing About You\"\n\n5. \"I Will Wait\"\n\n6. \"Lioness Eyes\"\n\n7. \"Phoenix Rise\"\n\nMixtapes\n\nTitle Details P.O.Y.B.L\n\nReleased: March 15, 2012\n\nLabel: Independent\n\nFormats: Digital download\n\nSingles\n\nList of singles, showing album name and year released Title Year Album Ref. \"Sweet Vendetta\" 2011 P.O.Y.B.L \"Love Will Return\" 2019 Lioness Eyes \"Phoenix Rise\" 2020 \"I Will Wait\"\n\nFeatured singles\n\nList of singles as featured artist, with selected chart positions, showing album name and year released Title Year Peaks Album NZ\n\nUK\n\n\"Go Too Far\"\n\n(Jibbs featuring Melody Thornton) 2006 17 126 Jibbs Featuring Jibbs \"Freak Like Me\"\n\n(Harrison featuring Melody Thornton) 2019 – – Non-album single\n\nAlbum appearances\n\nList of album appearances, showing album name and year released Title Year Other artists Album(s) Ref. \"Space\" 2008 The Pussycat Dolls Doll Domination \"Ease Off the Liquor\" 2009 Timbaland Shock Value 2 \"Something About You (Love The World)\" 2013 LL Cool J\n\nCharlie Wilson\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire Authentic \"Mittelfinger\" Prince Kay One Rich Kidz \"24/7\" \"I'll Be Fine\" Bizzy Crook 84\n\nMusic videos\n\nTitle Year Other artist(s) Director(s) Ref.
