        "text": "When did the ultra-Orthodox first receive an exemption from military service? How have Haredi demographics influenced this issue?\n\nThis is a timeline of the central milestones affecting the issue of Haredi conscription.\n\nIn new research, IDI experts Shlomit Ravitsky Tur-Paz and Gabi Gordon find that conscripting even a small percentage of eligible Haredi men would save the Israeli economy billions of shekels annually. They found that drafting even 20% of Haredi men would significantly reduce the number of days necessary for reserve duty and save 2.5 billion shekels in budgetary expenses by 2050. Full conscription of the ultra-Orthodox men would eliminate the need for reserve duty by 2045 and save the Israeli economy between 8-10 billion shekels.\n\nA new survey by the Israel Democracy Institute's Viterbi Center for Public Opinion examined what should be the highest priority in terms of Israeli national interest: military action in Rafah or a deal to release the hostages held by Hamas.\n\nIDI's Dr. Gilad Malach explains what a fair draft law for the ultra-Orthodox would look like. One that would distribute the burden over Israel's security more equally while enabling young Haredi men to integrate into the job market.\n\nIDI's Prof. Karnit Flug, VP of Research and the William Davidson Senior Fellow for Economic Policy joined Jeff Schoenfeld, Chair of the Jewish Federation's Israel and Overseas Committee and Bloomberg's Galit Altstein to discuss the implications of the ongoing war in Gaza on Israel's economy.\n\nYohanan Plesner, president of IDI and Prof. Yuval Shany, a Senior Fellow at the Center for Democratic Values and Institutions met with reporters to discuss the historic Supreme Court hearing on the repeal of the reasonableness doctrine.\n\nWith the Knesset set to hold its final vote on curtailing the “reasonableness standard,” what happens next? What are the implications of removing this type of oversight on governmental decisions, and is there still a possibility for compromise ahead of the vote?\n\nThe effects of the judicial overhaul on Israel's economy and foreign relations: Jeffrey Shoenfeld, Chair of the Jewish Federations of North America in conversation with Prof. Karnit Flug, IDI's Vice President of Research and William Davidson Senior Fellow for Economic Policy and Elliot Abrams, Council of Foreign Relations and former senior advisor to presidents Reagan, Bush & Trump.\n\nThe Jewish Federations of Cleveland was joined by Dr. Amir Fuchs, senior researcher the Israel Democracy Institute at the Center for Democratic Values and Institutions to discuss how Israel is undergoing many changes in its government.\n\nModerated by Judge Dan A. Polster."
