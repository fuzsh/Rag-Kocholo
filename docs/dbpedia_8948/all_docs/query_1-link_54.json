        "text": "You cannot ask your Israeli colleagues to forget about October 7 massacre as if it‚Äôs ancient history, even in a world where yesterday‚Äôs events already seem like old news and a long month has passed. You cannot ask us to forget it, not because we lost family and friends, not because we witnessed pure evil rising as if it was right from our grandparents stories about the holocaust, not because we are still grieving a collective tragedy of 1400 people who were brutally murdered that day, innocent people, kids, babies - targeted with a single goal of killing them all in the name of hatred. Not because they were burned alive, not because heads were cut off, not because parents were tortured and slaughtered in front of their children, and children were tortured and slaughtered in front of their parents. You cannot ask us to forget October 7 for two simple reasons: 1) There are 240 innocent people held hostage in Gaza, including babies. 2) There is no way we can allow October 7 to repeat itself. There was a ceasefire in October 6. Help Israel and the IDF bring peace back to our hurting country, free Gaza from Hamas, and bring us all 240 innocent souls back home to their families.\n\nI feel so sorry them. They must be relieved to see him and know he's alive, but not knowing if he'll die like so many others, if he'll ever come back. I would be going out of my mind. Their message will NOT pressure Netanyahu one iota. He's a HEARTLESS, CALCULATING, EVIL, poor excuse for a man. Here's that leaked video from 2001: https://lnkd.in/eNHd2hRc Showing who it is our governments are supporting in his GENOCIDAL aims. The same man who held up a map wiping out Palestine, just a few months ago in the UN, talking about how he never planned to honour the Oslo accords and how he can EASILY MANOEUVRE the US. He never wanted a two state solution, talking about how to hit Palestinians to cause them pain, and previously said he wanted to \"GET RID OF ALL THE ARABS in the next war\": https://lnkd.in/eRSNruXq This man and Israel's aims have been GENOCIDAL since it's inception. Hamas has wanted to EXCHANGE HOSTAGES and for a path to FINALLY END THE OCCUPATION, to end the forever war. But Netanyahu wants ENDLESS OCCUPATION, to kill many and drive out the rest of the Palestinians and would rather the Israeli hostages died in Israeli bombings, along with so many other hostages and thousands of Palestinians, and will just casually blame Hamas for killing them, even though they have not been killing hostages, ISRAEL HAS. And the world is letting the GET AWAY with it. They are a SACRIFICE he is willing to make to hold on to STOLEN LAND. He would rather they were killed than end the occupation. Just like Israel RUTHLESSLY killed many of those 1,139 murdered on Oct 7th, themselves, and did not care, just thought they'd get away with pinning all the murders on Hamas.** (**see comments) After all these months and anguish, I'm surprised these families have it in them to be TOE THE POLITICAL LINE and not call out the obvious. It's like in the GENOCIDAL state of Israel it's actually controversial to say, the HOSTAGES LIVES are the priority, yet they USE AND ABUSE them for their campaign posters to demand support for their GENOCIDAL CAMPAIGN. Would they rather remain SILENT on the MOST IMPORTANT thing that Netanyahu needs to do, to bring back THEIR FAMILY members ALIVE? I truly don't understand. There is next to NO PRESSURE on Netanyahu to force him to get them back. He's going to let them die there.üò• And INSANE Israel supporters have the audacity to clap back at peace protestors with, \"release the hostages\", as if they care about them, and like WE can release them. It's like it's just a GAME to them, just a LINE they throw back at us. If they REALLY wanted them back ALIVE and PEACE, they would engage with the REALITY of the situation. They would be MARCHING WITH US, demanding a permanent CEASEFIRE, HOSTAGE EXCHANGE and to END THE OCCUPATION. https://lnkd.in/ehVRtJq5\n\nOur lives in Israel the past few days are like a horrifying nightmare that we can‚Äôt wake up from. We thought that the stories we‚Äôd heard from our grandparents about the Nazis would never happen again and not only is it happening, it‚Äôs happening in the only land the Jews have, Israel. Entire towns were destroyed by blood thirsty terrorists. Babies, kids, women, elderly were butchered and slaughtered, separated from each other and kidnapped into Gaza. Women were raped next to their friends bodies. This is all being documented by these barbaric terrorists whose actions are being justified as the ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù movement. When it comes to Jews there are always justifications that we deserve this, even when the truth is out there, showing that Hamas is just like ISIS, and people around the globe saying that we had it coming. There is no justification for raping women and slaughtering families. Over 1,000 people were murdered and there‚Äôs no end in sight. 1,000 people in Israel are equivalent to 34,300 Americans. In the Palestine support rallies around the globe, we see Palestinian flags along with Swastikas. In Israel, we spend our resources on education, health and culture, while the Palestinians spend it on terror infrastructure and hate. Israel developed the ‚ÄúIron Dome‚Äù 12 years ago. Without the \"Iron Dome\" Israel could have been exterminated countless times, but the world still can‚Äôt see why Israel has the right to defend itself. Israel is the only democracy, upholding human rights in the Middle East, but when you see these horrific events, you are speaking out against us, or staying silent. We are heartbroken and devastated that our beloved country and beautiful people are under the attack of pure evil. Just like our grandparents survived the holocaust, we will win this battle of light against darkness Stand with Israel üáÆüá±\n\n‚ÄèIt is no longer possible to use so-called anti-Semitism as a weapon to gain support for Israel. What Israel is doing is indefensible to anyone with a shred of conscience. ‚ÄèKilling civilians by the thousands, demolishing homes, and preventing food and water are the practices of those who say they were subjected to the Holocaust. Is there a Holocaust more horrific than this? ‚ÄèI say to the Europeans that the story of anti-Semitism is a way to blackmail you. They have even gone so far as to accuse the Arabs of anti-Semitism, knowing that the Arabs are the Semitic Semites. As for the Jews, not all of them are Semites, especially those European Jews, as most of them are Khazars, and the Semitic Jews are the Jews who lived among the Arabs. ‚ÄèIsrael, or rather the Zionists, are accustomed to falsifying facts ‚ÄèIsrael was founded on lies, claiming self-defense, knowing that the establishment of Israel is an attack on the owners of the land. ‚ÄèThere are not ten percent of Israelis whose father or grandfather was born in Palestine and who transferred it to Israel."
