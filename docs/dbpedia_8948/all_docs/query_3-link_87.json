        "text": "Carmit Bachar and Jessica Sutta claim they weren't told about the cancellation of several Pussycat Dolls tour dates until they saw the news on bandmate Nicole Scherzinger's social media.\n\nThe group was due to go on tour together later this year, having delayed the shows several times since the originally scheduled start date of April 2020.\n\nRead more: Kimberly Wyatt defends Pussycat Dolls costumes\n\nBut this week, Scherzinger posted an Instagram Story declaring that the tour was cancelled due to the \"ever-evolving circumstances surrounding the pandemic\".\n\nBachar and Sutta issued a joint statement on their own Instagram pages, saying they were \"incredibly disappointed\" to learn of the news in this way and that \"there has been no official notification\" of the cancellation.\n\nThey wrote: \"Either way, it seems as though it's the end of a chapter to an incredible, life altering experience filled with some awesome memories that we will forever be grateful for.\n\n\"To the fans, we love you. Trust us, this is not the outcome we had hoped for.\n\n\"We wanted it as much as you because we appreciate you all so much and it hurts our hearts you had to wait so long for an answer, but unfortunately it's out of our control.\"\n\nRead more: Ofcom hit with complaints after Pussycat Dolls performance\n\nAshley Roberts and Kimberly Wyatt — the other two members of the group — are yet to respond to the cancellation.\n\nSinger and choreographer Robin Antin, who founded the group in 1995, shared her own statement in which she cryptically wrote that \"there are truths to this situation, I just hope one day they see the light\".\n\nWatch: Kimberly Wyatt wants an end to Nicole Scherzinger lawsuit drama\n\nAntin added: \"All of us have made personal and financial sacrifices, but that's what it takes to be a team player in a 'BAND'.\n\n\"Let's not forget there are five other members of this group who I care for deeply, who deserve to be heard.\"\n\nRead more: Scherzinger and boyfriend swap clothes in lockdown dance routine\n\nAntin and Scherzinger have been embroiled in legal struggles since September, when the former filed a lawsuit accusing Scherzinger of refusing to participate in the reunion unless she was given creative control and a majority share.\n\nScherzinger's attorney subsequently told Page Six that Antin's claims were \"ludicrous and false\".\n\nThe Pussycat Dolls were formed as a burlesque troupe in the 1990s before transitioning into the mainstream pop music scene in 2003 with the addition of Scherzinger as lead vocalist.\n\nDebut album PCD was released in 2005, with lead single Don't Cha becoming a worldwide hit.\n\nRead more: Ashley Roberts defends Pussycat Dolls amid sexist \"double standards\"\n\nSubsequent top 10 hits followed with the likes of Stickwitu and Buttons, as well as Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny) from the movie Slumdog Millionaire.\n\nThe group split in 2009, but announced their reunion in 2019 with the release of new single React coming in 2020 and the announcement of the now-cancelled tour."
