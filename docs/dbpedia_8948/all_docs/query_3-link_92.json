        "text": "THE Pussycat Dolls are known for being one of the HOTTEST girl groups in the world.\n\nThe band reunited in 2020 after ten years apart - but things have quickly turned sour again.\n\nWho's in the Pussycat Dolls?\n\nThe Dolls started off as a burlesque troupe but in 2003 Nicole Scherzinger, Melody Thornton and Kaya Jones joined Carmit Bachar, Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta and Kimberly Wyatt to form the group.\n\nKaya went solo in 2004 and Carmit left in 2008.\n\nThey split for good in 2010 but got back together in 2020.\n\nNicole Scherzinger\n\nNicole Scherzinger is still very much in the hearts and minds of the British public.\n\nShe has had stints as judge on The X Factor and most recently has been a judge on the celebrity version of the show.\n\nShe also became a solo artist and had a UK number one hit with Don't Hold Your Breath.\n\nNicole is the lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls.\n\nKimberly Wyatt\n\nKimberly Wyatt is not only a singer but also a choreographer.\n\nAfter leaving the Pussycat Dolls she became a judge on Sky One's show Got To Dance, which lasted for five years between 2009-2014.\n\nThe Missouri native has also taken part in Celebrity MasterChef, which she won in 2015.\n\nWyatt has started a family since leaving the group and got married in February 2014.\n\nThe couple have three children, Willow, Maple and Ford Senna.\n\nAshley Roberts\n\nAshley Roberts first gained fame in the UK away from the Pussycat Dolls with her appearance on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! in 2012.\n\nShe was a fan favourite and went on to finish second behind former EastEnders actress Charlie Brooks.\n\nShe also had a stint co-presenting on Ant And Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway from 2013-2016.\n\nAshely's time on British television continued with an appearance on 2018's Strictly Come Dancing, where she finished runner-up.\n\nCarmit Bachar\n\nCarmit Bachar returned to the group in 2020 after announcing her departure in 2008.\n\nShe split from the group at that time to try and pursue a solo career.\n\nIn February 2017, Carmit released her first official single It's Time under her stage name Carmit.\n\nShe is married to Kevin Whitaker and have a daughter called Keala Rose.\n\nJessica Sutta\n\nJessica Sutta was born in Miami, Florida.\n\nIn 2010 before the band officially broke up, she claimed she wanted to leave to pursue a solo career, saying to Life and Style magazine via heart.co.uk she felt like \"nothing more than a backup dancer in seven years\".\n\nShe released her debut single Show Me and it reached number one on the Billboard Dance Club Songs Chart in the US.\n\nHer debut solo album I Say Yes was released on in 2017.\n\nWho is Pussycat Dolls founder Robin Antin?\n\nRobin Antin is an American actress, entrepreneur, singer, dancer, choreographer and clothing designer.\n\nIn 1995, she founded the modern burlesque troupe the Pussycat Dolls.\n\nBy 2003, Robin had turned the group into international popstars.\n\nSince then, she has gone on to create other girl groups, including G.R.L., Girlicious and Paradiso Girls.\n\nWhy are the Pussycat Dolls in a legal battle?\n\nNicole announced in November 2019 that the band was reuniting for a tour across the UK and Australia.\n\nThey also released single React, which became their first Top 40 hit in 11 years.\n\nBut in September 2021 Nicole has now said the tour is “impossible” after a huge fall-out with the band’s founder, Robin Antin who is suing the singer for “extortion”.\n\nShe alleges that Nicole is refusing to take part in the reunion unless she gets a larger share in the group’s latest business venture, PCD Worldwide.\n\nThe company was intended to manage the band’s brand into the future and could have included the launch of their own dance studio and a “next generation” spin-off version of the Dolls featuring new singers.\n\nRobin claims Nicole is demanding her 49 per cent holding in the firm is increased to 75 per cent, giving her creative control of the group and “final decision-making authority”.\n\nHowever, Nicole has issued a statement through her lawyer, Howard King, in which she branded Robin’s claims as “ludicrous and false”."
