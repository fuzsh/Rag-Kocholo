        "text": "ITV Dancing on Ice star Kimberly Wyatt will follow in the footsteps of her former band Melody Thornton and take to the ice this weekend for the first time.\n\nKimberly is best known as a singer and dancer for girl band The Pussycat Dolls.\n\nREAD MORE:UK's biggest family The Radfords issue devastating health update\n\nKimberly is partnered with Scottish skater Mark Hanretty, who has previously skated with former Loose Women panellist Saira Khan and TOWIE's Billie Shepherd on the ITV show.\n\nThe Pussycat Dolls were made up of Kimberly, Melody, Nicole Scherzinger, Ashley Roberts, Carmit Bachar and Jessica Sutta and together the girls released multiple hit singles and albums.\n\nHowever, things weren't as they seemed and Kimberly was involved in a bitter feud with fellow bandmate Nicole Scherzinger.\n\nYou can sign up for all the latest TV and Showbiz content here\n\nAfter the band split in 2010, Kimberly and Nicole fell out and didn't speak to each other for years as their careers continued individually.\n\nLifting the lid on the feud, Kimberly told The Mirror in 2013: \"I have not spoken to or seen Nicole in quite some time... and that’s not through lack of trying.\n\n\"I’ve made enough first moves now, I feel the ball is in her court.\"\n\nShe added: \"But I just hope that Nicole is actually happy as a person,” she added. “Our dealings together weren’t always easy – it wasn’t an easy situation to be in, in the Pussycat Dolls, period.\n\n\"But I have a lot of love for Nicole and if she offered (an olive branch) I would accept it with open arms.\n\n\"I have a lot of understanding but, at the same time, I wish we could get past that and just move on.\n\n\"I mean, jeez, let’s grow up and enjoy our lives.\"\n\nThe pair settled their differences and The Pussycat Dolls - without Melody who chose not to return to the group - announced their reunion in 2019 and a subsequent tour in 2020.\n\nThe tour was pushed back to 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic however in March, the group announced they would be pushing their tour back again.\n\nLast week, Nicole Scherzinger released a statement on Instagram announcing that the tour had officially been cancelled due to the rising coronavirus cases."
