        "text": "What is Carmit Bachar's Net Worth?\n\nCarmit Bachar is an American singer, dancer, model, actress and showgirl who has a net worth of $5 million dollars. Born September 4, 1974 in Los Angeles, California, Carmit Bachar is best known as a former singer for the pop/R&B group the Pussycat Dolls. Born with a cleft palate, Bachar's first operation was at the age of six months old and her parents were told she would need an operation every year until she was 16 years old. When Bachar joined the Pussycat Dolls in 1995, the group was a burlesque show rather than a pop singing group. In 2002, Bachar brought her friend Gwen Stefani to perform at the Pussycat Dolls' show and Stefani brought along Interscope Records' Ron Fair and Jimmy Iovine. As a result of that introduction, the Pussycat Dolls were later signed to Interscope Records.\n\nBachar left the Pussycat Dolls in 2008. Her long-time fianc√© had been pushing her to get married, but she was so career-driven that she kept putting the actual marriage off. News of an unexpected pregnancy in early 2011 culminated in the birth of daughter Keala Rose on September 18, 2011. Bachar is currently a member of the electro/pop due LadyStation. She is also an ambassador for The Cleft Lip and Palate Association (CLAPA) which supports those affected by the affliction."
