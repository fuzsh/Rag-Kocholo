        "text": "Stunning former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts is on the prowl for a new love and reckons a British bloke would be just purrfect.\n\nBeautiful Ashley, 32, has not been short of admirers since she braved the Aussie jungle in I’m A Celebrity.\n\nBut now she is living permanently in London, after becoming a Dancing On Ice judge, and hopes a Brit will have the courage to ask her out.\n\nShe admits: “I don’t even know the last time I was on a date. I feel British men are more gentlemanly – they’re not as aggressive.\n\n“Sometimes with guys over here I’m like: ‘Is he gonna ask me out?’.”\n\nAshley faces the opposite problem in the States. She says: “The guys in America are like: ‘Hey!’, giving you the really bad one-liners. There needs to be a middle ground here, guys.”\n\nWhen we meet in a Central London park, Ashley’s hair is tied back and wearing trainers, black leggings with a checked shirt slung around her waist to front a new fitness challenge.\n\nBut she is still impossibly gorgeous, with an amazing figure honed from years of performing the Dolls’ infamously sexy dance routines.\n\nIt easy to see why her exes, including Declan Donnelly, of Ant and Dec fame, and This Morning TV presenter Matt Johnson, 31, found her so desirable.\n\nShe is unlikely to be on a shelf for long but, for now, enjoys being unattached romantically and musically.\n\nYet, she would not turn down Mr Right if he came along. She says: “I think I’m more ready now to be open for something. Before, I don’t know if I was. I was really kind of enjoying running around, doing my own thing and being selfish.\n\n“If it came along, I’d be open for it but it’s gotta be... top notch! I want my partner in crime, I want my best friend. You know, I want it all and I believe\n\nyou can.”\n\nAshley would love to start a family but is in no rush. She says: “I believe in divine timing, that everything happens for a reason.\n\n“So I’m on the journey that I’m supposed to be on and I’m exactly where I need to be.”\n\nIt was Ashley’s stint in the jungle in 2012 which propelled her to solo fame. She became the surprise hit of the series, eating a camel’s private parts and finishing runner-up to EastEnders actress Charlie Brooks, 33.\n\nShe had split up from long-term US dancer boyfriend Kenny Wormald in 2011 and caught the eye of the show’s co-host Dec, 38. At the time, the Geordie joked: “Oh my gosh. Everything I want to say is unbroadcastable or illegal – or career-ending.” Their romance was short-lived though and now Dec has gone on to find love with his manager, Ali Astall, 34.\n\nSince the jungle, Ashley landed a coveted Dancing On Ice role and has worked with Dec on Saturday Night Takeaway.\n\nAshley has also topped countless lads’ mags sexiest woman alive polls but is wary about how airbrushing and photoshopping can change someone’s look.\n\nShe says: “People have seen me in the jungle so they know how I look waking up naturally on HD TV so what they see is what they get. You do look at something and you have to realise it has been touched up and photoshopped. They want you to look and compare themselves to that.\n\n“I think sometimes when they do a bit, like when you have a zit or tired under-eye circle I feel like that’s fine.\n\n“When they really start reshaping the body it gets a bit too much. I did a photoshoot one time with this guy and he gave me the touched-up ones and I was like: ‘Is that even my face?’... ‘What?! That’s not what I look like!’\n\n“Do I think some people can overdo the airbrushing? Yes, 100%. It’s unfortunate but that is what happens. We all have our own insecurities that we have got to work on.”\n\nAshley grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, and was 21 when she joined The Pussycat Dolls. With her bandmates, Nicole Scherzinger, Carmit Bachar, Kimberly Wyatt, Jessica Sutta and Melody Thornton, the group sold more than 50 million records with hits, including Don’t Cha, Buttons and Stickwitu. For six years, they dominated the charts then, in 2010, they sensationally split.\n\nAshley claimed it was because she and the others were fed up with lead singer Nicole taking the limelight. During her stint in the jungle, she said: “Even in the group I wasn’t allowed to talk, we were told to be quiet. Only Nicole was allowed to talk, we’d occasionally pitch in.”\n\nCarmit has claimed previously that Nicole was jealous of Ashley, saying: “She felt threatened by her – like people would prefer her because of the way she looked.\n\n“Ashley had that iconic American thing going on – blonde hair, blue eyes. It was the look Nicole seemed to want but could never have. No one could understand why Nicole was so jealous. She was an exotic beauty with a look that most girls would kill for.” But despite those rumours, Ashley says she’s still in touch with Nicole – as well as the other Dolls. “Kim just got married to a Brit so she’s officially a Brit,” she jokes. “She lives here in London. Nicole goes back and forth. The other girls are in LA.”\n\nAnd she hints there may be a Dolls reunion in the future. “You know, never say never but, at the moment, I think we’re all just doing our own thing.”\n\nCurrently, she is relishing the chance to show people who she really is. “I loved being in the Dolls, being on stage dancing and singing. I loved that part of my life but now as I’ve gotten older it does feel really rewarding to be on my own. I can put my life stories into my music.”\n\nIn fact she has followed in the footsteps of singer Taylor Swift – by writing songs about her ex-boyfriends. She is set to release her debut solo album later this year and laughs: “You’ve gotta have stuff to pull from.” For now TV is on the back burner. “I’m just switching gears and getting back to my roots of everything.”\n\nHer new single, Clockwork, is out this month. “I’m really excited and proud of it. It’s been a crazy journey so I’m stoked to get it out there.”\n\nAnd even though she admits she is not always happy with herself. “I have definitely got some insecurities for sure but I try my best to love what I have and to work on it.” There’s plenty to love, which her too-gentlemanly admirers need to appreciate."
