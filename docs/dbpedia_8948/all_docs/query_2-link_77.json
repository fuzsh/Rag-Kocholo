        "text": "The girl group that keeps on giving. Mess, that is.\n\nDon't Cha wish the lead singer of your burlesque troupe/pop group/dance ensemble informed you of the cancellation of your world reunion tour?\n\nI am, of course, referencing the iconic '00s girl group The Pussycat Dolls, aka a formative part of my childhood.\n\nIn the latest instance of the members being, like, not entirely on the same page with regard to performances and hierarchies within the group, lead singer Nicole Scherzinger announced on her Instagram story yesterday that PCD's long-awaited (and COVID-delayed) reunion tour would be canceled as a result of the ongoing Omicron wave.\n\n\"Thank you to everyone who had tickets to see PCD â€” we are so appreciative of your support and loyalty! With the ever-evolving circumstances surrounding the pandemic, I understand the decision that the tour dates had to be cancelled,\" she wrote.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that the other members of the group, like Jessica Sutta and Carmit Bachar, were not aware of the update. In a joint statement posted to their Instagrams, the two wrote, \"We want to say how incredibly disappointed we are to learn of an announcement made on Instagram that The Pussycat Dolls reunion tour is canceled. As of now, there has been no official notification of that.\"\n\nThey continued, \"Either way, it seems as though it's the end of a chapter to an incredible, life-altering experience filled with some awesome memories that we will forever be grateful for. To the fans, we love you. Trust us, this is not the outcome we had hoped for.\"\n\nJessica also posted a selfie of the two on her story, while Carmit posted a video of the pair walking hand in hand to the group's second debut single, \"Stickwitu.\" The members also vowed in their statement that the tour \"may have come to an end, but it is not the end of the Dolls story. We created a sisterhood that will live on...\"\n\nFor her part, PCD founder Robin Antin posted her own statement on social media after Nicole's announcement, saying that both she and the group have been waiting on rescheduled dates and have been \"working so hard to make it happen.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that Robin currently has a lawsuit pending against Nicole. According to the former, Nicole was originally supposed to make 49% of the reunion profits. With the pandemic-induced cancellation, Nicole is apparently refusing to perform until her contract is renegotiated to 75% and she's given complete creative control.\n\nThe tension escalated as Nicole's lawyer, Howard King, hit back at the suit, calling it \"ludicrous and false\" and \"a desperate attempt to divert blame for her own failures by trying to impose obligations on Nicole that simply do not exist.\"\n\nAs of right now, Live Nation's UK website boasts a new lineup of rescheduled dates that are yet to be confirmed. There are currently no tickets available for purchase, and it's unclear whether previously purchased ones will be refunded or transferred.\n\nIDK about all of you, but I hate this part right here!\n\nShare This Article"
