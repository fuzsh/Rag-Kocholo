        "text": "Carmit Bachar has traveled the globe many times over, whether through modeling, dancing, acting, or performing with the world-renowned Pussycat Dolls. Carmit and the Dolls reunited after almost a decade in 2020, releasing their new single \"React\" earlier in 2020 and gearing up for a reunion tour before the Covid-19 pandemic threw an unexpected wrench into their plans.\n\n\"When The Pussycat Dolls Reunion Tour was cut short due to Covid, it was an abrupt halt in every way,\" Carmit shared. \"At first, I don't think anyone knew it would last this long, but eventually, we all accepted the unknown.\"\n\nCarmit herself has had a very tough year. She struggled with various health issues this year, which prompted her to seek treatment so she could be the best version of herself and her family and loved ones.\n\nMental Health has been an issue for many, especially during the pandemic. In a KFF Health Tracking Poll, they found about 4 in 10 adults in the U.S. have reported anxiety or depressive disorder symptoms during the pandemic.\n\nFor Ms. Bachar, it became a year of prioritizing wellness and taking care of her mental health, and she is on a mission to help other women do the same. A battle with debilitating tinnitus in 2020 led to a personal discovery of mental, spiritual, and emotional growth, seeing her launch her subscription box service for cleansing/protection.\n\n\"I've always had a list of ideas to tackle, but this one was in alignment with what I had just experienced, and it came together with ease,\" said Carmit. \"I'm enjoying this new adventure.\"\n\nHealth Took Centerstage in 2020\n\n\"2020 was like the ninja of rollercoasters,\" Carmit shared. \"On top of the world issues, I personally had a health crisis that was debilitating and rocked me to the core. I think stress and fear took everything over the edge for me. It forced me to prioritize my health, so I began my journey to uncover why everything came crashing down physically and mentally. I experienced some of the darkest moments in my life, and it was scary.\n\nCarmit shared that she was diagnosed with tinnitus. Tinnitus is when you experience ringing or other noises in one or both of your ears. When you have tinnitus, what you're hearing is not external, meaning others can't hear what you're hearing. It affects about 15% to 20% of people and is especially common in older adults.\n\n\"Tinnitus triggered my anxiety, especially when I was told there was no cure.' It is an unfair thing to say when multiple underlying reasons could trigger any ailment and need to be sussed out,\" said Carmit. \"It was like a death sentence. I didn't know how I could live the rest of my life with the constant, loud ringing.\"\n\nTinnitus is caused by an underlying condition, such as age-related hearing loss, an ear injury, or a problem with the circulatory system. For many people, tinnitus improves with treatment of the underlying cause or with other medicines that reduce or mask the noise, making tinnitus less noticeable.\n\nCarmit set off on her own research, determined to figure out what might be causing this issue. \"I was on a scavenger hunt with integrative doctors, which eventually uncovered several issues: brain inflammation. That is creating anxiety, negative looping thoughts, brain fog, and probably contributing to the tinnitus. Eventually, it all traced back to an abscess under a root canal. The process took months of many modalities to get back to homeostasis.\"\n\nThis journey is one reason she wants to bring awareness around investing in your emotional wellness and Neurofeedback. Neurofeedback uses real-time displays of brain activity, most commonly electroencephalography (EEG), to teach brain function self-regulation.\n\n\"It was instrumental in my healing with Neuroplasticity and has made the tinnitus tolerable,\" she said. \"If you haven't heard of it, I highly recommend looking into it. I also learned how vital brain health is, and taking supplements to support the brain is necessary for us all. Oh, the lessons this past year! Grateful to say I have come a long way and feel much healthier. Things are far from stable globally, but I think the growth and a shift in myself make me feel more resilient. 2020 gave me 2020 vision and clarity, that's for sure!\"\n\nThe Grace & Gratitude Box\n\n\"Your mental state is everything. It's the context from which you live your life,\" Carmit stated. \"Being happy is a choice most of the time, so when I felt out of that control due to my health issue, it gave me anxiety. There are so many layers to it. A lot has to do with healing which is something different and personal for everyone. Then there are health-related things, and sometimes they can all be triggered by extreme stress.\"\n\nMore than 2 in 5 U.S. residents report struggling with mental or behavioral health issues associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, including anxiety, depression, increased substance use, and suicidal thoughts, according to new findings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCarmit's personal experiences with her health and anxiety led her to create the Grace & Gratitude Box.\n\n\"We all need to reconnect with ourselves and others. That in itself is a necessary practice,\" Carmit advised. \"It's almost as if we have to permit ourselves to take a moment. Working hard is ingrained, and there are so many distractions to keep us busy nonstop. I know for me, I actually have to schedule in time to make sure I self-care. I felt a responsibility to share some of the tools that helped me get through my tough times. That is why this is so personal to me. So this particular box has elements that will cleanse and protect you energetically.\"\n\nThe Grace & Gratitude Box includes a non-toxic cleansing candle and smudge spray containing 100% essential oil blends. It also consists of a Selenite & Black Tourmaline Crystals, Palo Santo, Sage, and an affirmation card divinely picked by Carmit's nine-year-old daughter.\n\n\"For centuries, indigenous tribes have burned sage to cleanse, purify and pray,\" she explained. \"Old energy can block your blessings, especially when you are around other people. Everyone has experienced being around someone's lively or heavy energy. It can be contagious or linger, so it's important to reclaim your space! I know everyone who receives a box will feel the continued benefits. It's the practice of setting intentions to manifest anything you put your mind to. We are super powerful when we use all our tools!\"\n\nAdvice and The Future\n\nWhen asked what advice she'd have for other working parents who may be potentially grappling with their mental health, she answered, \"I'd say one moment at a time. I get overwhelmed when I look at everything as a whole. A lot is going on in the world right now. So take care of yourself so that you can take care of your family. The world is shifting, and it's calling on us to rise. You need self-care, whether that looks like meditation, a bath, exercise, or a creative class with nothing to do with the list of things you have to do! My advice more than ever now is to do at least one thing for yourself every day. Also, it doesn't hurt to ask for help. Therapy, a coach, or even a friend can be your lifeline. We don't have all the answers all the time. Don't forget to breathe!\"\n\nAnd things are looking up for Carmit as the Pussycat Dolls tour has new dates, and the girls will hit the road later this year. 2021 will also see new music from Carmit as a solo artist and surprise business endeavors announcing soon.\n\nIn addition, Carmit recently graced famed fashion bible Harper's Bazaar Vietnam as its December 2020 cover - which was a full-circle moment coming out of her health battles to leaving 2020 on top of the world literally."
