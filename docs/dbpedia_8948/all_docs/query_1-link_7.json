        "text": "(music-news.com ) - Carmit Bachar has quit the Pussycat Dolls. The singer - who joined the band in 1995 when it was a burlesque group - announced yesterday (28.02.08) she is leaving to \"pursue other projects\". Carmit was one of the band's three main vocalists along with Nicole Scherzinger and Melody Thornton. It is thought they and the group's other members - Kimberly Wyatt, Jessica Sutta and Ashley Roberts - will continue as a five-piece. Carmit was the longest serving member of the Pussycat Dolls. Former Dolls include Christina Applegate - who helped create the troupe - and one-time 'Baywatch' babe Carmen Electra. Most of the current members, including Nicole, were cast in 2002, when they were transformed into a singing group. Their first single, 'Sway', was released in 2004 but worldwide success only came in 2005 with 'Don't Cha'. They have since gone on to enjoy several hit singles and a multi-million-selling album. A host of stars have made guest appearances with the Pussycat Dolls over the years, including Eva Longoria Parker, Pamela Anderson, Denise Richards, Nicollette Sheridan, Salma Hayek and Jaime Pressly."
