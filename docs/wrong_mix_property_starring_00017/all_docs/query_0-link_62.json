        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\n\"Love Actually\" came out in 2003, but fans still may not have noticed these sneaky details.\n\nJamie's novel pages look mostly blank, and Natalie misspells Christmas in her holiday card.\n\nAfter being mentioned twice, Claudia Schiffer makes a cameo at the end of the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly some members of the prime minister's staff have ID cards.\n\nWhen the prime minister shows up for his first day of work, some of the people he walks by have ID cards, but others don't.\n\nIt appears that anyone visiting him or on his security team has a badge clipped to their top, but the members of his house staff don't.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarry's office is decorated with things from his family.\n\nAlthough his morality is called into question throughout the film as he's tempted by his assistant, Mia, in his first scene, Harry is introduced as a family man.\n\nIn his office, there's a wall of family photos and pictures that seem to have been drawn by his children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSam has a variety of stickers on his bedroom door, along with a chalkboard that he uses during the movie.\n\nDaniel and his stepson Sam grow closer throughout the movie, but at the start of the film, Sam hides away in his room.\n\nHis bedroom door is decorated with stickers and a chalkboard, which he uses to tell Daniel to leave him alone. But he writes different messages on it later in the film.\n\nSome of the stickers say \"Don't drop anything, you won't find it again\" and \"If your name's not Sam, you're not getting in.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of the pages Jamie's working on appear to be blank.\n\nWhen Jamie is working on his book outside by the lake, most of the pages that fly away as Aurelia lifts his cup seem to be blank.\n\nThere's a handful with words typed on them, but even the piece of paper in his typewriter looks like it's empty at the top.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the US president visits the prime minister, he inexplicably has Washington-state license plates.\n\nWhen the president arrives at Downing Street, his car can be seen pulling into the gates.\n\nThe black car has American flags on the side of it, but it doesn't have the proper government plates that are on the real president's car, Cadillac One or \"The Beast.\"\n\nThe license plates shown on the car in the film aren't even for Washington DC, they're for Washington state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dolls that Karen insults are actually Ken dolls.\n\nKaren holds up two dolls that she's gift wrapping for her daughter's classmates and insults both of their looks.\n\nThey appear to actually be male Ken dolls restyled and dressed in drag before being packaged in unlabeled boxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMark turns the television off immediately after the announcer says not to.\n\nMark is watching a Billy Mack interview on TV before Juliet comes over.\n\nHe grabs the remote and shuts the television off immediately after the TV announcer says, \"Do not switch off!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSarah's clock changes inconsistently when she's in her room with Karl.\n\nWhen Sarah and Karl are in Sarah's bedroom, a small clock can be seen on the nightstand to the left of her bed.\n\nWhen the couple is first in her room, the clock reads five minutes to 12. But later in the scene, the clock goes back in time to about 10 minutes to 12.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the few non-Billy Mack items in Joe's home is a \"Jaws\" poster.\n\nBilly Mack's manager, Joe, has a ton of the singer's memorabilia in his home.\n\nThere are Billy Mack posters and pictures all around, including one poster that shows an album cover titled \"Moments of Madness.\"\n\nOne of the only posters in Joe's home that doesn't feature his rock-star client is a large \"Jaws\" one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNatalie spells Christmas wrong in her holiday card.\n\nNatalie confesses her feelings for the prime minister in a Christmas card.\n\nShe writes about being sorry about what happened and ends by saying that she's his.\n\nThe letter is a nice romantic gesture, but there's a pretty big spelling error — Christmas is missing its \"r.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nChristmas details you missed Holidays\n\nAdvertisement"
