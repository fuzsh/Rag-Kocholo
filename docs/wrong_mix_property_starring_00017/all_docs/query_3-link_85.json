        "text": "Since 2003, every Christmas is marked by the traditional viewing of Love Actually. This rom-com that we’ve watched about ten times still manages to melt the most frozen hearts. Led by a golden casting and a solid script that needs no introduction, Love Actually is revealed in eight secrets decrypted by Vogue.\n\nThe masters of the “made in UK” romantic comedy\n\nIf Love Actually is Richard Curtis’ first film as a filmmaker, he isn’t at his first try when it comes to rom-coms. The filmmaker started as a scriptwriter on previous successful projects: Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Bridget Jones’ Diary. All of these classics of the romantic comedy have a major asset: Hugh Grant. If the British actor is slowly getting rid of his slick image, notably in the show The Undoing, he was for a long time the imaginary boyfriend of many who fell under the charm of his characters.\n\nTwo films in one\n\nOriginally, Richard Curtis was working on preparing two different films, centered around the characters of Hugh Grant, the Prime minister, and Colin Firth, the cheated-on husband who flees to write a novel. Through working on the scripts, Richard Curtis saw similarities between the two stories. He finally decided to mix them together and to create the choral film we know today, in homage to his favorite film: Magnolia by Paul Thomas Anderson.\n\nA five-star casting\n\nReleased in 2003, Love Actually instantly became a classic. His script evidently is one of the reasons, but what first attracted the public to the dark rooms is the golden casting put together by Richard Curtis. Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman for the men. Emma Thompson, Laura Linney, Keira Knightley for the women. The total? Almost 250 million dollars at the international box-office.\n\nA tailor-made role\n\nThe fans of Love Actually are unanimous: the most memorable duo of the film is David and Natalie’s. Cupid’s arrow hits the Prime minister straight in the heart when he meets one of his 10 Downing Street colleagues. During the writing phase, Richard Curtis had already chosen the actress Martine McCutcheon. He wanted her so much in the role that he had previously named the character Martine. Though the British actress didn’t pursue an international career after the jumpstart offered by Love Actually, her on-screen romance with Hugh Grant remains one of the most memorable.\n\nA real scene\n\nIf Love Actually is a portrait of the different faces of love, the filmmaker Richard Curtis wanted to bring as much authenticity as possible to his film. The opening scene is a direct proof. It was shot in Heathrow airport in London in order to capture moving reunions between lovers, children and parents, loved ones and friends without them noticing. If the filmed sequences could appear in the film, the filming crew then asked the permission of the people filmed to use the images.\n\nKeira Knightley and Thomas Brodie Sangster\n\nAfter having appeared in the very popular Pirates of the Caribbean, Keira Knightley joined the prestigious casting of Love Actually. Even though her role isn’t major, the scene in which Andrew Lincoln declares his love for her on her doorstep is today one of the most romantic in cinema. At the time, the British actress was only 18 and already playing an adult character. But she isn’t the only one to have barely reached eighteen. Liam Neeson’s on-screen son is played by a young actor getting his start in Love Actually: Thomas Brodie-Sangster. Aged only 13, the actor seemed much younger than Keira Knightley when they are only five years apart. For the role, Thomas Brodie-Sangster had to learn to play the drums. Having become the queen of historical romances and the muse of Joe Wright, Keira Knightley is today one of the most prolific actresses of the UK. Thomas Brodie-Sangster, on his side, recently blew up on the screen along Anya Taylor-Joy in The Queen’s Gambit.\n\nA family film\n\nThe magic of Christmas, the aura of love… Love Actually is the ideal feel-good film for the holidays. Its heartwarming atmosphere is boosted by a few camos that only a trained eye will notice. In 2015, the author and life partner of Richard Curtis, Emma Freud, revealed a few Love Actually filming secrets on her Twitter account. We learn that the child with the Spiderman makeup and the little girl in a lobster costume who play in the nativity scene are none other than Jake and Scarlett Curtis, the couple’s children. The cleaning lady at 10 Downing Street – the Prime minister’s residence – is Emma Freud’s mother. Richard Curtis even appears in his own film as a harmonica player.\n\nLove Actually 2\n\nIn May 2017, the cast of Love Actually reunited for an exceptional short film of more than 16 minutes. Still directed by Richard Curtis, Love Actually 2 was meant for television for the occasion of Red Nose Day, an NGO which helps children in precarious circumstances. Called Red Nose Day Actually, the clip checks back, 14 years later, on what became of the film’s heroes. We find Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon, Keira Knightley and Andrew Lincoln, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Liam Neeson, Colin Firth and Lucia Moniz. That year, the Red Nose Day raised more than 80 million euros to fight famine in Ethiopia.\n\nTranslated by Maria Atallah\n\nAlso on Vogue.fr :\n\nNetflix: 7 Christmas movies to watch\n\nLove Actually in 20 cult scenes"
