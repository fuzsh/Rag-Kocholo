Before his acting career, he had worked as a fork-lift driver at a Guinness factory, and a truck driver. He even spent a short amount of time playing for Bohemians, a professional Irish football club, due to prowess in football while he was enrolled in college.\n\nCareer[]\n\nIn his first film appearance, he starred as Jesus Christ in the religious film Pilgrim's Progress directed by Ken Anderson. His movie and TV roles include Dr. Peyton Westlake in Darkman, Oskar Schindler in the 1993 film Schindler's List, the Star Wars prequel trilogy as Qui-Gon Jinn, in Kingdom of Heaven as Godfrey, The Chronicles of Narnia where he voiced Aslan and Batman Begins as Ra's al Ghul. In the 2007 movie, Taken, he plays a retired Central Intelligence Agency agent who travels to Europe to save his daughter from kidnappers, who intended to sell his daughter. This has since become a cult film and one of his most famous roles, which skyrocketed him to fame as an action hero icon. He has also played real-life characters, including Michael Collins, Alfred Kinsey and Oskar Schindler. He was starred as John \"Hannibal\" Smith in the A-Team movie released on June 11, 2010.\n\nAppearances/Characters[]\n\n(3 films)\n\nFilmography[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1978 Pilgrim's Progress Jesus Christ / Evangelist 1979 Christiana Greatheart 1981 Excalibur Gawain Time Bandits Timmy 1983 Krull Kegan 1984 A Woman of Substance Blackie O'Neill Ellis Island Kevin Murray The Bounty Charles Churchill 1985 Lamb Michael Lamb The Innocent John Carns 1986 Hold the Dream Blackie O'Neill If Tomorrow Comes Insp.
