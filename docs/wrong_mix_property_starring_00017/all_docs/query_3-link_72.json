        "text": "December 2003. Twenty years ago. It was a special time for moviegoers. That’s because it was the first holiday season in which “Love Actually” could actually be part of one’s Christmas time festivities. (Richard Curtis‘ ensemble romantic comedy was still playing to healthy crowds in cinemas.)\n\nWhile the film would not figure into that year’s Academy Awards race, the cast did feature a handful of past Oscar contenders — and a few winners. Sho which “Love Actually” cast member will be next to earn an Oscar nomination?\n\nThe most noticeable of those winners was Emma Thompson, 1992’s Best Actress for “Howards End.” She tried (unsuccessfully) for acting awards three more times, including for 1995’s “Sense and Sensibility.” For penning that script, she accepted the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for superbly adapting the classic novel by Jane Austen.\n\nThe other “Love Actually” cast member with an Oscar in their possession was Billy Bob Thornton, who had what was effectively a cameo role in the movie. Thornton had accepted the Best Adapted Screenplay award for 1996’s “Sling Blade.” He also competed for Best Actor for that film, and later for Best Supporting Actor for 1998’s “A Simple Plan.”\n\nTwo other “Love Actually” actors had Oscar nominations on their resumes. Liam Neeson had been cited for Best Actor for 1993’s Best Picture “Schindler’s List.” And Laura Linney had made the Best Actress shortlist for 2000’s “You Can Count on Me.” Linney would receive a Best Supporting Actress nom for playing Neeson’s wife in 2004’s “Kinsey.” And she had another shot at Best Actress for 2007’s “The Savages.”\n\nIn the years since the release of “Love Actually,” several more of its stars have gone on to compete for Academy Awards.\n\nKeira Knightley was a proud Best Actress nominee for 2005’s “Pride and Prejudice.” Almost a decade later, she was back in the game going for Best Supporting Actress for 2014’s “The Imitation Game.”\n\nColin Firth brought 2009’s “A Single Man” a single nomination — for Best Actor. He then ruled the derby the following year for “The King’s Speech,” delivering Best Actor acceptance speeches at virtually every awards show (including the Oscars). Colin really did become “King.”\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor became the next talent from the “Love Actually” roster to receive an Academy Awards invite, for his starring role in 2013’s Best Picture “12 Years a Slave.”\n\nAnd just last year, Bill Nighy became the latest “Love” legend to be singled out for Oscar recognition — as a Best Actor nominee for “Living.” Interestingly enough, Nighy’s BAFTA-winning performance might have made him the “Love Actually” thespian who actually came closest to getting an Oscar nom. (Let’s face it, he would have been a much cooler choice than Alec Baldwin in “The Cooler.”)\n\nBut let’s hope that Nighy won’t be the last “Love Actually” alumnus to advance to Oscar-nominated status. And assuming that he isn’t, who will be next?\n\nIf we’re thinking in terms of someone overdue, then Hugh Grant would logically make the most sense. He was overlooked for his roles in Best Picture contenders like 1994’s “Four Weddings and a Funeral” and 1995’s “Sense and Sensibility.” He appeared to be close to getting in for 2016’s “Florence Foster Jenkins,” but likely just missed.\n\nOf course, it could be someone like Andrew Lincoln or Martin Freeman.\n\nOr heck, it might end up being Thomas Brodie-Sangster. After all, his screen dad was the Oscar-nominated Neeson. (Like father, like son – right?)\n\nOscars or not, “Love Actually” deserves lots of love.
