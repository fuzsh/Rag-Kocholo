Following their success with Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Bridget Jones' Diary, they turned a $25 million budget for Love Actually into nearly $250 million in worldwide grosses, the mass majority of which coming from outside of America, where the film's charm didn't connect as well. It was the kind of episodic production nominated for ensemble cast awards, featuring a screenplay that examines romance in contemporary times through several love affairs and marriages that cross nearly every conceivable socio-political boundary. Familiar names carry both the lead roles and cameo appearances throughout the picture, led by crowd and critic favorites Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant. So authentic are the depictions of each couple's struggles and triumphs that Love Actually is a rare entry in the genre that sidesteps the cheese factor almost entirely. Curtis' mastery of the balance between comedy and truly serious concepts of romance makes the film a tear-jerker in the all the right ways. The soundtrack for the film was also well managed; like all of the director's films of this variety, an intelligent combination of classic and contemporary rock songs was licensed for prominent placement in mostly transitional scenes. Leading these songs were the Pointer Sisters' \"Jump\" for an entertaining scene with Grant and Dido's \"Here With Me,\" a song for a moment of solitude on the streets that was experiencing an explosion in popularity at the time. Unlike the aforementioned Curtis films, though, Love Actually also gave a prominent role to an original score. Although these films had included work from names as popular in London as Patrick Doyle and Trevor Jones, the production turned to Glasgow's own Craig Armstrong for this assignment.\n\nGiven Armstrong's success in building bridges between sensitive, intimate topics and his extensive experience as an arranger of accompaniment for pop songs, not to mention the high praise that he was still enjoying from the monumental success of his compositional and arrangement work for the phenomenal Moulin Rouge, he was a smart choice for the job. Armstrong's score for Love Actually, despite consisting of mostly short, disconnected cues, occupies some of the most poignant scenes in the film, underlining both the incredible sorrow of some of the storylines while offering jubilant, fully orchestral exuberance for others. The material that Armstrong provides to Love Actually was so effective, in fact, that its three most engaging themes became a strong accompaniment to the rock songs for the demographic of women most interested in the film and soundtrack. Despite Universal's attempt in America to push the score for major awards consideration, Armstrong was shut out of that season across the board, likely due to his contribution's perceived short running time and its placement in the shadow of the songs. Still, for enthusiasts of the composer's relatively sparse but fruitful output in the first ten years of his film scoring career, Love Actually is a lovable entry with ten to fifteen minutes of music that belongs on any compilation of light orchestral romance. Three of the major relationships receive consistent thematic development, led by the Glasgow theme for the bittersweet, doomed interaction between Knightley's character and her new husband's best friend. This piano piece is pure Armstrong at his best, devastatingly lovely in a tragic sense, using descending lines much like the love theme for Christian and Satine in Moulin Rouge. Highlighting the devastating scene of the original cue title \"Mark's Video,\" it's also the best recognized track from the score, the only one to appear on all of the commercial song compilations for Love Actually. Joining it is the Portuguese theme representing Colin Firth's funny interactions with his Portuguese chambermaid, culminating in a full-ensemble, grand expression in the restaurant proposal scene.\n\nThe most surprising theme in Love Actually is the one of stately stature for Grant's Prime Minister, reminiscent of the broadly realized excitement in a political environment that Marc Shaiman so memorably wrote for The American President. Heard briefly in \"Press Conference,\" this distinctly British theme at the height of its orchestral bombast erupts for extended treatment in the latter half of \"Joanna Drives Off,\" summarized in a slightly altered form as \"PM's Love Theme\" on the European song compilation album. The remainder of the score generally reprises these ideas in less obvious incarnations and sometimes expands their purposes. The Portuguese theme, for instance, debuts in \"Opening Titles\" and occupies \"Croissants in France\" and \"The Lake House.\" The Glasgow theme extends to \"Total Agony\" and \"Sarah & Karl Go Wrong.\" The Prime Minister's love theme is tied well to that particular love story, occupying all cues with \"Natalie\" in their title, but its elements also extend to the Sam and Joanna characters as well, dominating the late cues \"Joanna Drives Off\" and \"Sam & Joanna.\" The expansion of the other two themes represent a bit of additional potential misdirection from Armstrong, as those identities find themselves with other characters, too. But this application was the innocent result of the composer and director attempting to tie together common themes of romance, with the Glasgow theme largely representing failure and sadness in particular. Two other melodies actually tie the score together as well, though the extent of neither was revealed on the original album presentations for Love Actually. The first, termed the \"Greenshoots\" motif by Armstrong, is a hopeful little clarinet melody of European character that sounds like a carryover from vintage Rachel Portman romance works. It debuts in \"First Day\" and continues in similar form in \"In Love With Karl\" and \"I'm In Love.\" The other minor motif is a rising series of piano figures also highly reminiscent of the somber portions of Moulin Rouge, heard in \"Sam's Bedroom,\" \"On the Bench,\" and \"Bad Policies.\" Nearly every cue in the score makes use of one of these themes, Armstrong hesitant to evolve them far beyond their basic iterations.\n\nInstrumentally, the piano is, as usual for Armstrong, the heart and soul of Love Actually's score, though it is joined by acoustic guitar and strings for appropriate depth. (The composer performs most of the solos on piano and guitar himself.) The only notable brass and percussion usage comes in the major renditions of the Prime Minister's theme, and the clarinet anchors the slightly humorous and melancholy portions. Occasional flute flourishes for the late cues of romance realized are a nice touch despite their overexuberance, as is the electronic pulse underneath the climax of \"Joanna Drives Off.\" More of this synthetic effect would have been a welcome addition to other cues. Collectors of Armstrong's lighter dramatic works will be familiar with this instrumental palette, and the composer often succeeds with the \"less is more\" approach. The one standout comedic cue in Love Actually is the rhythmically calm but maddeningly impatient \"Wrapping the Necklace\" for the famed Rowan Atkinson scene; a hint of vibraphone joins the pluckiness of this cue. The full score is pleasantly innocuous even in the most contemplative moments, stringently adhering to the major key, which Armstrong admits was a struggle given his preference for morbid minor mode drama. He succeeds well at capturing the positive major key spirit of the story, however, proving this assignment to be lovely practice for fuller treatment of largely the same kind of ideas in 2020's remarkable The One and Only Ivan. Listeners unsatisfied with the rather short development of the themes in Love Actually will find solace in that unlikely successor's similar expressions. On album, Armstrong enthusiasts didn't receive much satisfaction from the American song compilation for Love Actually at the time of the film's release; only the \"Glasgow Love Theme\" appeared on this product. But the European variation, targeted at the greater mass of viewers of the film, rearranged the songs considerably (adding and omitting some) and appended three Armstrong score cues representing seven minutes of the three major themes at the end. These tracks truly are the highlights of Armstrong's score, making the European song and score combination album a recommended product for general fans of the film.\n\nFor film score collectors, Universal offered twenty minutes from the Love Actually score on an official \"for your consideration\" promotional pressing aimed at AMPAS members at the end of 2003. The sound quality of the promo is slightly muted compared to the cues presented on the song compilations, but simple volume adjustment can solve most of this problem. On the promo, the \"Restaurant\" track mirrors the \"Portuguese Love Theme\" from the European song album, and the \"Mark's Video\" track likewise mirrors \"Glasgow Love Theme.\" There was some editing involved in cutting \"Joanna Drives Off\" down to the version of \"PM's Love Theme\" on the song album, and the promo really excelled for listeners wanting the extra performances of this robust idea. The \"Glasgow Love Theme\" cue also appeared on a short-printed Armstrong compilation in 2005 and a Ghent Film Festival compilation souvenir in 2007. The cue \"Restaurant Proposal\" additionally appears on the latter. It was surprising and disappointing that the highlight of the score, so clearly the Prime Minister's theme in full performance, doesn't represent the score on these compilations and the American song album, for it is truly among the most satisfying single themes of 2003. In 2021, La-La Land Records expanded the film presentation of Armstrong's score to a full 50 minutes, finally revealing all the variants of the primary three themes and two supporting motifs. That product also includes several versions of the \"Christmas is All Around\" song that dominates the film and for which Armstrong arranged into a score-like instrumental for the film's major introductory scenes. Both the film and album takes of that song by Billy Mack are included, as is the \"PM's Love Theme\" suite that never actually comprised a cue in and of itself. The longer album may not support the light weight of the music for all listeners, but it finally allows for a strong narrative appreciation of Armstrong's addressing of the story. Even in a twenty-minute suite, some collectors may consider the score for Love Actually to be insignificant. But its impact on the heart-warming film is more memorable than most others in this genre, earning Armstrong well deserved recognition for working his original music so effectively into environments otherwise dominated by songs. This is \"warm and fuzzy\" film music of the best kind. @Amazon.com: CD or Download\n\nMusic as Written for the Film: ****\n\nMusic as Heard on the American Song Compilation: **\n\nMusic as Heard on the European Song Compilation: ****\n\nMusic as Heard on the Promotional Album: ****\n\nMusic as Heard on the 2021 La-La Land/Back Lot Album: ****\n\nOverall: ****\n\nBias Check: For Craig Armstrong reviews at Filmtracks, the average editorial rating is 3.83 (in 12 reviews)\n\nand the average viewer rating is 3.42 (in 45,182 votes).
