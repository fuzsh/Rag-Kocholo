        "text": "Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle+\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nEvery Christmas when our favourite wintry romcom movies return to our screens, we realise we still can’t name a single Love Actually character\n\n“You know – Emma Thompson’s character?!” “The cheating husband… what’s his name… Alan Rickman!” “Prime Minister, Hugh Grant.” “I forgot Rowan Atkinson was in this….” Even as the film celebrates it’s 20th anniversary, the best way to name all the Love Actually characters is by the famous British actors who played them.\n\nCan you remember any of the character names off the top of your head? Don’t worry, we’ve IMDb’d them so you don’t have to.\n\nEmma Thompson – Karen\n\nSo simple… how do we not remember this!\n\nAlan Rickman – Harry\n\nThis is quite amusing given he was also starring in the Harry Potter franchise at the time.\n\nHeike Makatsch – Mia\n\nHarry’s affair partner… who did not deserve that necklace! Poor Emma Thompson – I mean, Karen.\n\nRowan Atkinson – Rufus\n\nA Christmas angel? The jeweller whose slow gift-wrapping eventually gets Harry caught-out for buying a necklace for Mia instead of Karen.\n\nHugh Grant – Prime Minister/ David\n\nJust Prime Minister, or David.\n\nMartine McCutcheon – Natalie\n\nThe Prime Minister’s secretary and love interest who does not have “thighs like tree trunks!”\n\nKeira Knightley – Juliet\n\nThis makes sense with the whole ‘forbidden love’ element to her story and that famous cue card lament at her front door.\n\nAndrew Lincoln – Mark\n\nOf course, the Romeo to Keira Knightley’s Juliet… Mark.\n\nWho was completely oblivious to the fact his best friend, Mark, was quite literally madly in love with his wife, Juliet.\n\nLiam Neeson – Daniel\n\nLovely, widowed Daniel whose scenes with his young, lovestruck stepson, Sam, bring a tear to everyone’s eye.\n\nThomas Brodie-Sangster – Samuel (Sam)\n\nHe’s 33-years-old now!\n\nColin Firth – Jamie\n\nThe newly single writer whose girlfriend cheated on him with none other than his own brother. We’d run away to French countryside, too…\n\nLúcia Moniz – Aurélia\n\nThe Portuguese housekeeper at the cottage Jamie retreats to, who he falls in love with despite the language barrier.\n\nBill Nighy – Billy Mack\n\nThe washed-up rockstar who is the first major character that we meet out of this massive ensemble as he unwillingly records a Christmas song.\n\nGregor Fisher – Joe\n\nBill’s manager, Joe, who turns out in the end Bill expresses is the platonic love of his life.\n\nLaura Linney – Sarah\n\nSarah’s the one with the office crush on Karl, which transpires into a love connection. However, Sarah’s care responsibilities for her brother, Michael take priority over the budding relationship.\n\nRodrigo Santoro – Karl\n\nThe handsome Chief Designer, who in the end can’t make this work with Sarah.\n\nKris Marshall – Colin Frissell\n\nThe self-proclaimed “god of sex.”\n\nJoanna Page – Judy\n\n“Just” Judy is the girl-next-door character who falls in love with John after meeting in a rather unconventional way.\n\nMartin Freeman – John\n\nAfter meeting Judy on a filmset where they are both professional body-double stand-ins for a sex scene, the two end up engaged by the end of the film."
