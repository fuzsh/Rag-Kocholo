        "text": "Can you believe Thomas is now 32?! His acting career is still going from strength to strength, having scored roles such as Jojen Reed in Game of Thrones and Newt in the Maze Runner film series. Most recently, he played Benny Watts in the Emmy-winning Netflix mini-series The Queen's Gambit alongside Anya Taylor-Joy and is currently filming for the upcoming Disney+ series The Artful Dodger.\n\nJoanna is Sam's crush. You know, the girl he describes as \"heaven\"? She sings 'All I Want for Christmas' at the school concert, and producer Richard Curtis later revealed she was so good, the audio was edited in post-production to make it sound more realistic.\n\nOlivia is now 30 and working as a singer and voice-over artist in her hometown, Los Angeles. We've checked out her Instagram, and no surprise, she's still gorgeous. Following her role in Love Actually, Olivia never fully pursued acting but had various voice roles in the likes of Phineas and Ferb and The Powerpuff Girls, but she has been mainly focusing on her music work since (She even appeared on The X Factor: Celebrity back in 2019).\n\nLiam's life tragically mirrored Daniel's when his wife (Natasha Richardson) died in 2009. Together they had two sons, Micheál and Daniel. On the professional front, Liam has seen success, starring in the hit action trilogy Taken from 2008-2014. He went on to star in a slew of other action films, such as Cold Pursuit, Honest Thief, The Marksman, and The Ice Road - although he has expressed his desire to retire from the genre and try a new role.\n\nBefore David Cameron, we had another David running the country. His romance with his assistant Natalie was possibly our favourite in the movie, and don't get us started on that dancing scene. Tony Blair even spoke out about being compared to the fictional PM: “I know there’s a bit of us that would like me to do a Hugh Grant in Love Actually and tell America where to get off. But the difference between a good film and real life is that in real life there’s the next day, the next year, the next lifetime to contemplate the ruinous consequences of easy applause.” Classic Tony.\n\nRom-com king Hugh Grant's best days were arguably already behind him once Love Actually was released in 2003 (Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary, About a Boy), but he's still one of Britain's most famous faces. He has starred as villainous Phoenix Buchanan in the Paddington franchise, took on the role of Jonathan Sachs in The Undoing alongside Nicole Kidman, and we can also soon expect to see him in the fantasy adventure film Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves. On the personal front, Hugh married TV producer Anna Elisabet Eberstein. They share three children.\n\nMartine didn't know it at the time, but the role of Natalie was written with her in mind after Richard Curtis saw her playing Tiffany in Eastenders. She's had a few small acting roles since and regularly appeared on ITV's Loose Women. Following her pop career in the 90s, she released her fourth studio album, Lost and Found, in 2017. Her last on-screen role was in 2018. Martine has since been vocal about her Lyme disease on social media.\n\nThe legendary comedian behind Mr. Bean has been a staple on television screens and went on to star in the hilarious action movie franchise Johnny English. He will also star alongside Timothée Chalamet in the upcoming movie Wonka. On the personal front, Rowan shares a five-year-old daughter Isla with his wife, Louise Ford. He also has two children, Ben and Lily, with his ex-wife Sunetra Sastry.\n\nHarry is the unfaithful husband who has an affair with his secretary, Mia. Such a cliche. We didn't explicitly see it, but writer Emma Freud has since confirmed it was definitely \"sex and a necklace.\"\n\nHeike is a German actress and singer. While filming Love Actually she was living with her ex-boyfriend Daniel Craig (!) who she met on the set of Obsession in 1997. After their break up in 2005 she got together with Max Martin Schröder and together they have two children. They split in 2014. She's most notably starred in A Sound of Thunder (2005) and The Book Thief (2013).\n\nOne of our favourite actresses of all time, Emma Thompson hasn't stopped her acting conquests. She has gone on to star in the Harry Potter films Beauty and the Beast, Nanny McPhee, Bridget Jones's Baby and Saving Mr. Banks, to name just a few. Most recently, she starred in the sex comedy-drama Good Luck to You, Leo Grande, as well as the terrifying Miss Trunchbull in the film adaptation of Matilda the Musical.\n\nAndrew has done pretty well for himself, landing the starring role of Rick Grimes in the hit US show The Walking Dead from 2010-2018. He reprised his role as Rick as a cameo appearance in the series finale earlier this year.\n\nSince the film's release, we've fully realised what a terrible person Juliet is. Ok, baker boy hats may have made a comeback, but fashion aside, kissing your husband's best friend is a bit wrong isn't it? Don't even get us started on \"I look quite pretty, don't I?\"\n\nWith Pirates of the Caribbean and Love Actually both released in the same year, Keira was transported to mega-stardom. She went on to score roles in Atonement, Pride & Prejudice, The Imitation Game, Begin Again and Colette. She's also been involved in many theatre productions, making her Broadway debut in the title role of Thérèse Raquin in October 2015. She is married to musician James Righton, and they have two daughters.\n\nUnlucky-in-love Colin Frissell brought us some of the best comedy moments of the movie. He flew out to Wisconsin in America to find himself a girlfriend, meeting Elisha Cuthbert, January Jones and Ivana Milicevic - does it get much better?\n\nApparently, Kris enjoyed his scene with the American girls so much, he offered to hand back his paycheque. Besides Love Actually, he's probably most famous for his part in the BT adverts running from 2005-2011. He also played Detective Inspector Humphrey Goodman in the BBC drama Death in Paradise and took on the long-running role in the historical drama, Sanditon.\n\nWho can forget the classic line: \"Hey kids, don't buy drugs - become a rock star and people give you them for free!\" Love Actually wouldn't be the same without Billy Mack, the singer who unexpectedly scores a number one with 'Christmas is all Around'.\n\nBill has starred in countless films since 2003, including the Pirates of the Caribbean movies and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1. He collaborated with Richard Curtis again on the 2013 rom-com About Time. He is currently winning critical acclaim in the movie Living, which had its world premiere at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nColin has seen a lot of success since Love Actually, receiving a BAFTA for his leading role in Tom Ford's directorial debut A Single Man (2009) and his first Academy Award for his leading role in The King's Speech (2011). Most recently, he starred as Michael Peterson in the TV adaptation of The Staircase alongside Toni Collette.\n\nSarah is the American who works at Harry's graphic design company and is not-so-secretly in love with her colleague, Karl. They finally get together at the Christmas party but their night is interrupted by her mentally ill brother, Michael, phoning from a care facility.\n\nLaura is a powerhouse who has won two Golden Globes and a further four Emmys since Love Actually. Laura has been also been nominated for three Academy Awards and five Tony Awards. She most recently starred in the critically-acclaimed Netflix drama Ozark.\n\nOne of Brazil's most successful actors, 47-year-old Rodrigo has starred in 300, Focus, and most recently the HBO show, Westworld. He's been in a relationship with actress Mel Fronckowiak since 2013, and together they have a daughter called Nina.\n\nEveryone now knows Joanna as Stacey Shipman from the BBC comedy Gavin & Stacey, which ran from 2007-2010. She recently appeared on The Masked Singer, and switched over to presenting for shows such as Shop Well For Less and The Pet Show. She's married to English actor James Thornton, and together they have three children."
