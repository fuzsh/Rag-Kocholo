Before starring in Love Actually as the prime minister who falls in love with his secretary, Natalie, Grant already had several breakout roles. He’s known for his roles in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), which earned him a Golden Globe, Notting Hill (1999), Bridget Jones’s Diary (2001) and Two Weeks Notice (2002), among others. Since Love Actually, Grant has starred in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (2004), The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) and Florence Foster Jenkins (2016).\n\nMartine McCutcheon\n\nMcCutcheon’s road to fame started during her childhood when she was featured in several billboard ads. Her first acting role was Mandy in the show Bluebirds in 1989. Her big break was in the soap EastEnders, where she played the character Tiffany from 1995-98. In Love Actually, she played David’s secretary, Natalie, and the two fall in love by the movie’s end. Her biggest role since Love Actually was in 2008 when she played Susan Penwarden in the show Echo Beach. She’s also a singer with several studio albums to her credit.\n\nEmma Thompson\n\nThompson's had a prolific acting career. In college, she was in Cambridge University’s drama club, Footlights.

She’s known for her roles in The Remains of the Day (1993) Howards End (1993), which won her a best actress Oscar, and Sense and Sensibility (1995), which earned her a writing Oscar for best adapted screenplay. In Love Actually, Thompson starred as Karen, the prime minister’s (Hugh Grant) sister, and as Harry's wife (who's played by Alan Rickman). Her character experiences a lot of inner turmoil when she realizes her husband is cheating on her with his secretary.

In 1978, he moved to Dublin’s Abbey Theater, and he was cast in the 1981 film Excalibur when director John Boorman noticed him.
