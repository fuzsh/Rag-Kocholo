        "text": "Confirmed: Love actually is all around. Our favorite holiday movie — OK, one of our favorite movies in general—Love Actually is finally getting the sequel it deserves after 14 years of waiting.\n\nVariety reports that the 2003 film's director Richard Curtis has reunited with the original cast to create a short film that checks in with the characters we know and love for the U.K. charity Comic Relief. The sequel, titled Red Nose Day Actually, will premiere as part of Red Nose Day in the U.K.\n\nOfficially returning for the sequel are stars Hugh Grant, Martine McCutcheon; Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln Liam Neeson, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Colin Firth, Lucia Moniz, Bill Nighy, Marcus Brigstocke, Olivia Olson, and Rowan Atkinson. Unfortunately, Emma Thompson, Martin Freeman and Chiwetel Ejiofor won't be involved in the sequel; nor will Alan Rickman, who died in 2016.\n\n\"I would never have dreamt of writing a sequel to Love Actually, but I thought it might be fun to do 10 minutes to see what everyone is now up to,\" Curtis said in a statement. \"Who has aged best? I guess that’s the big question — or is it so obviously Liam? We’ve been delighted and grateful that so many of the cast are around and able to take part — and it’ll certainly be a nostalgic moment getting back together and recreating their characters 14 years later. We hope to make something that’ll be fun and which we hope will help bring lots of viewers and cash to the Red Nose Day shows.\"\n\nRed Nose Day Actually, which reportedly begins shooting this week, will hit airwaves in the U.K. on March 24 before coming stateside to NBC on May 25. In the meantime, our wasted hearts will be waiting.\n\nRelated: Your FAVORITE Love Actually Romance Was Actually Kind of Real"
