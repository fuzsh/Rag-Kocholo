They had met while working on Excalibur (1981). Interviewed by James Lipton for Inside the Actors Studio, Neeson said Mirren was instrumental in him getting an agent.\n\nNeeson met his future wife, actress Natasha Richardson, while performing in a revival of the play Anna Christie on Broadway in 1993. They married on 3 July 1994.\n\nIn August 2004, Neeson and his wife purchased an estate in Millbrook, New York.\n\nOn 18 March 2009, Richardson died when she suffered a severe head injury in a skiing accident at the Mont Tremblant Resort, northwest of Montreal. Neeson donated her organs following her death. She and Neeson had two sons together, Miche√°l Richard Antonio (born 22 June 1995, in Dublin) and Daniel Jack (born 27 August 1996, in New York City).\n\nA heavy smoker earlier in his career, Neeson quit smoking in 2003, while working on Love Actually. When he took the role of Hannibal for the 2010 film adaptation of The A-Team, Neeson had reservations about smoking cigars (which is a signature trait of the character) in the film due to being an ex-smoker, but agreed to keep that personality trait of Hannibal intact for the film. In August 2009, Neeson said that he had been naturalised as a United States citizen. In March 2011, he was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF. Neeson is a patron of Belfast based charity and film festival CineMagic, which encourages and helps young people to get involved in the movie industry.\n\nIn June 2012, Neeson's publicist denied reports that Neeson was converting to Islam. However, the actor has expressed an affection for the Adhan, the Islamic call to prayer, that he grew accustomed to while filming Taken 2 in Istanbul: \"By the third week, it was like I couldn't live without it. It really became hypnotic and very moving for me in a very special way. Very beautiful.\" He also expressed admiration for the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nNeeson first stepped on stage at age 11 after his English teacher offered him the lead role in a school play, which he accepted because the girl he was attracted to was starring in it. From then on, he kept acting in school productions for the following years.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nGreek Mythology Appearances \"Disney's Hercules\": \"Clash of the Titans (2010)\": \"Wrath of the Titans\": \"Once Upon a Time\": \"Hercules 2014\": \"Immortals\": \"Myths\": Absent Appears Appears Absent Absent Absent Absent \"Rain of the Furies\": \"Clash of the Titans (1981)\": \"For the Love of Zeus\": \"PJO & the Lightning Thief\": \"PJO & the Sea of Monsters\": \"Strange Case\": \"More in Heaven and Hell\": \"Alternate Realities\": Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent TBA TBA TBA"
