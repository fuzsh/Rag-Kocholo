        "text": "As Christmas fast approaches, there's one film that's pretty much guaranteed to be on our collective watchlists: Love Actually, of course.\n\nWith an all-star cast including the likes of Hugh Grant, Keira Knightly, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson side-by-side, Love Actually holds its own as a Christmas classic - originally airing back in 2003. Plus, some of the movie's younger cast members (remember Sam and Joanna?) have grown up to star in some of our favourite new films and TV shows too.\n\nSo, if you're rewatching Love Actually this winter, here's a run through of what the cast look like now, and what they've all been doing in the 18 years since the film was released.\n\nEmily Gulla was Cosmopolitan UK’s Former Editorial Assistant/Junior Entertainment and Lifestyle Writer, covering celebs, TV and film for the site, magazine and video. She’s interviewed the casts of your favourite TV shows, from Bridgerton to Derry Girls and Stranger Things, as well as dozens of Love Islanders. She also loves getting stuck into long-read features, writing on all things digital culture (including her favourite topic: memes), and dating - having appeared on the radio to discuss dating.\n\nEmily's work has also been published on ELLE, Women's Health, Harper's Bazaar, Digital Spy and more. She holds a First Class degree in English with Film Studies from King's College London, and even wrote her dissertation on Love Island. You can find Emily on Instagram and LinkedIn, and can see more of her work on her website."
