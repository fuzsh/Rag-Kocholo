        "text": "Hi Todd,\n\nI completely agree with Dave here (congrats to your son, btw ‚Äì he has the most enviable of choices to make!)\n\nRegarding NYU with full scholarship vs. Harvard, there are two main issues here:\n\n1. How certain is your son that he wants to pursue an academic career? If he‚Äôs dead set on it, then Harvard and Yale probably do win, with or without money at other top-10 law schools. You need to realize, however, that such a decision is really difficult to make before even stepping foot in law school. What if he changes his mind and decides to do corporate law? Or get into politics with the hopes of becoming a judge? Or join the Justice Department? Or become a public defender? Or federal prosecutor? The list goes on‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not saying that Harvard will be ill-suited for such pursuits (quite on the contrary); however, NYU will arguably be just as good of a choice, one that will save him the equivalent of a downpayment on a mortgage. Furthermore, while there are indeed more HLS alums as Supreme Court clerks, professors, and SCOTUS justices, these statistics don‚Äôt confirm that HLS is vastly superior to NYU in preparing its students to join these elite ranks. You are looking at a self-selected sample: what if HLS students are merely more likely to compete for such positions in the first place? There is also an outcome bias here, judging a decision based on the outcome alone. If he‚Äôs a student at or near the top of his class at NYU, with stellar mentoring and no debt, there will be nothing ‚Äì NOTHING ‚Äì to stop him from pursuing whatever career he wants ‚Äì even in academia or the judiciary. The first step will be securing a federal clerkship with a feeder judge, something a top NYU Law student is just as likely to secure as a HLS student.\n\n2. Is cost a considerable factor here? If your son plans to borrow money to attend Harvard or Yale, even with their excellent loan forgiveness programs, the debt will be a burden that may shape the future decisions he makes. Having no debt will give him a lot more freedom than even the best loan forgiveness program in the world. Of course, if cost is not a factor ‚Äì i.e. he or you will be paying for his education out of pocket ‚Äì then by all means, let him go to Harvard! üôÇ The name has a nice ring to it, and it‚Äôs a wonderful place to spend 3 years. (I went there, I know :-). Needless to say, your son needs to visit both schools and get a feel for each.\n\nOne decision may be wiser than the other, but there is no ‚Äúwrong‚Äù choice here. Let us know what you guys decide to do!\n\nHey Cody,\n\nThanks for the question! This is a tough one. I‚Äôm generally quite anti-debt, but there are times when it‚Äôs reasonable to take some debt on. This might be one of those times, so let‚Äôs look at some factors:\n\nI‚Äôm a Houston fan. I think the law school is up-and-coming, and the overall school profile is growing nationally (the recent success of the football team cannot be discounted in that; anything that gets the school name in front of more people is a good thing).\n\n2. Relatively speaking though, UT is simply the bigger, more recognized name, and it has national presence. Houston only has regional presence. That is, however, offset by your desire to stay in Texas after graduation.\n\n3. When it comes to specific specialties, I don‚Äôt give those much weight. First, most employers don‚Äôt really think about them. employers hire on school name and class rank/grades, and not so much on which school are the best at environmental law. Second, as you readily admitted, your interests are far from certain, and can and likely will change once you get into school. So, using the IP ranking as a factor here doesn‚Äôt seem like a good idea. In the same way, the relative clerkship success at UT also doesn‚Äôt influence me, although it is in fact a reflection of the definably higher prestige associated with attending Texas. There no way of knowing if you‚Äôll want to go the clerkship route, although one can say that going to Texas preserves that option whereas going to UH lessens it.\n\n4. The free ride at UH is pretty attractive üôÇ I mean, zero debt more or less speaks for itself, and its why this is a debate at all. On the other hand, the Texas debt is at least manageable. If you can come out under $50K for a T15 law school education, that‚Äôs pretty solid. with your EE background, you‚Äôd probably be in better shape than the average grad, something that I also factor into the equation.\n\nSo, all that said, this is a classic ‚Äúhigher prestige with debt‚Äù vs ‚Äúlower rank but free‚Äù argument. If it was me, I‚Äôd probably lean very slightly towards UT, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a wrong answer here, and that‚Äôs the good news: you either come out of this with a free law school education (which I find wildly attractive) or a top-level degree and low-level debt. All in all, you‚Äôre the real winner here üôÇ\n\nPlease let me know if this helps. Thanks, and definitely keep me posted on what you decide!\n\nHey Nikki,\n\nOk, so the latest situation is:\n\nFordham, which results in $195K debt after the $35K per year is applied\n\nOR\n\nCardozo, which results in $90K debt total\n\nIn other words, about $100K more in total debt to attend Fordham. Oh boy, this is not easy at all! Law is often a rankings game, and Fordham comes in at #37 whereas Cardozo is #74. Knowing that you want Biglaw in NYC, obviously Fordham has the edge (and it‚Äôs a fairly big edge as Cardozo doesn‚Äôt produce many biglaw associates. See https://www.lstreports.com/schools/cardozo/ and https://www.lstreports.com/schools/fordham. Plus, here‚Äôs an anecdotal example supporting the same conclusion: http://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/the-best-and-worst-new-york-law-schools-f‚Ä¶). But, the debt worries me a lot, and I know it worries you too, especially given your age. I‚Äôm also concerned about how Biglaw firms will view you as a 33 year associate‚Äìyou may encounter some hesitation on their part (I‚Äôve heard of such in the past). Then again, your paralegal background can help offset that and would ease the concerns of a law firm, especially on the theory that you‚Äôd acclimate even faster and be more efficient. It literally is impossible to call here so I‚Äôm going to make a unusual suggestion that may or may not work. I think you should call the hiring office of a biglaw firm or two and see if you can‚Äôt find someone who will give you advice here. Explain your situation in a very brief, concise nutshell (don‚Äôt go more than 30 seconds) and ask if they have any thoughts. It‚Äôs a longshot, but if you could find one person who could almost serve as a ‚Äú5-minute mentor,‚Äù it might set you at ease about your chances and your decision.\n\nI personally fear the debt we are talking about here, because $195K is nothing to sneeze at. But, neither is $90K, so you already know you‚Äôre going down that path to some extent, it‚Äôs just a matter now of how far. Is the better ranking worth the extra $100k? It might be but only if you do well (and I can see that you know that by the comment you made about one bad final). It comes down to your commitment to Biglaw, because for that Fordham is the way to go. But I don‚Äôt think the extra money is really worth the extra boost because once you have that debt, you‚Äôre stuck with it.\n\nSo, I suppose I‚Äôd go with the lower debt, but I understand why this is difficult. That lower debt comes with lower opportunity. Either way, you will need top grades but you‚Äôll have to be top 5-8% to pull a Biglaw job. That is a lot of pressure üôÅ\n\nI wish I could do more here, but there isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúbest‚Äù answer, just what is best for you. Thanks!\n\nHey Dakota,\n\nWell, what you have is the classic name vs money decision, which is probably the toughest one in the admissions world. Whereas in some cases I have a strong feeling about what to do, in this one I don‚Äôt. So, let‚Äôs break it down. First, what‚Äôs the exact financial outcome for each. I‚Äôll use the LST Reports:\n\nhttps://www.lstreports.com/schools/fordham/ ‚Äî Non-discounted cost of $307K ‚Äì $135K scholarship = $172K debt.\n\nhttps://www.lstreports.com/schools/penn/ ‚Äî Non-discounted cost of $320K ‚Äì $0K scholarship = $320K debt.\n\nSo, a significant difference there. And one, that as you rightly note, could follow you around and affect the rest of your life.\n\nNow, are the job prospect differences enough to make a difference. Again, back to LST:\n\nFordham: Employment score = 66.8% / Under Employment = 17.8%\n\nPenn: Employment score = 89.8% / Under Employment = 4.9%\n\nAgain, a significant difference, and you can see that while you pay more, your job outcomes are better from Penn (and they better be, for that price!). By the way, pay close attention to the graduate outcomes box in the lower right. Penn has 66.3% grads going into large firms and 10.6% into Federal clerkship jobs (highly coveted). Fordham? 33.7% grads going into large firms and 1.7% into Federal clerkship jobs. In other words, Penn provides a 76% chance of large firm/clerk jobs, whereas Fordham is about 35%. they are, as you say, in very different classes.\n\nAt this point, it‚Äôs about what happens with the individual. Because although at Fordham you have less leeway for a bad exam or bad day, when you look at Penn there are still people struggling coming out of that school. Not everyone gets what they want, and there‚Äôs problem: if you could guarantee that you are in the positive outcome group, then Penn is a reasonable call, but you can‚Äôt guarantee that. And so it comes down to how you feel about all sorts of factors, including the environment at each school, how confident you are in your abilities, and so on.\n\nI don‚Äôt know the best decision here for you, mainly because I don‚Äôt know you üôÇ I am generally debt-averse but I understand the pull of Penn here. Do you have any other admittances in the T14 or even T20 that gave you money that you could use to bargain with Penn? For example, maybe Duke gave you $20K a year? If so, use that as leverage and ask Penn for an improved aid package.\n\nSorry, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúright‚Äù answer here but hopefully this gave you something to think about. Good luck!\n\nHi Mary,\n\nThanks for the reply! I‚Äôm glad that your visit to BC went well‚ÄìBoston is obviously a great town (by the way, I hear great things about St. Louis as well‚ÄìI‚Äôve had a number of friends spend time there who actually loved it). If this is down to BC vs WashU, the debt is so similar as to be non-determinative. It‚Äôs really down to which school you like better and which one you think will help you to perform as well as possible. Your first grades will be key to your job prospects, and thus you need an environment where you will do as well as possible.\n\nThe alternative here is that if WashU was really an option, to go back to them and ask them to sweeten the offer to a number that you would fine irresistible (or, as they say in The Godfather, you want them to make you an offer that you can‚Äôt refuse :). However, I only recommend that approach if you know that there is such a number and that you would indeed attend‚Äìto me, honesty in negotiation is absolutely essential, and I would only open up a negotiation with WashU if there is a chance they could change your mind. And if they can, be clear about the number that it would take to do that.\n\nAs far as BC, it‚Äôs interesting to me that they stood firm. Sometimes schools will do that, other times not. It depends on a lot of different factors, including your numbers and how their own applicant pool is shaping up. Thus, from year to year things will change, and that makes it very tough to predict how a school will act. Did you just send a letter to them about the debt? I ask because maybe it would be in your best interest to call them up and talk to the person who sent you your reply. A real live conversation can sometimes get a school to change their offer‚Äìhearing a person is so much different than reading a letter and impersonally replying to it. Perhaps you call them up, thank them so much for taking the time to reply, and let them know if they could just sweeten it a little‚Äìsay $4K a year or sometime rather minor‚Äìyou‚Äôd sign on the dotted line right then, you might be able to turn them over on this. And if not, what‚Äôs the harm? You can still tell them you love the school and want to attend.\n\nI get the sense you are leaning towards BC here, and given that the alternative is WashU, I think you are good there. The debt is very similar but BC has better prospects for what you seek.\n\nPlease let me know if this helps. Thanks!\n\nHi Dov,\n\nThanks for the question! As a quick reference for you, earlier in this thread we had a Cardozo vs Fordham discussion, and you can find that here: http://blog.powerscore.com/lsat/scholarship-vs.-prestige-when-to-take-th‚Ä¶. The discussion and analysis there was a bit different since both choices resulted in some debt ($90K vs $195K, with that $90K being enough that it affected my recommendation, actually), but the basic idea‚ÄìFordham with more debt vs Cardozo with significantly less, is similar.\n\nIn that situation, there were certain stated employment goals that made Fordham more attractive than usual (since both resulted in a lot of debt, the extra debt was less troublesome), so in reading that please keep that in mind. In your case, I‚Äôm inclined to agree with you‚Äìif it‚Äôs going to be basically free to go to Cardozo, that‚Äôs incredibly attractive. Law school debt is non-dischargeable, so you are stuck with it no matter what. Thus, I always tend towards debt-free outcomes whenever possible.\n\nJob outcomes here are obviously critical, and you should carefully peruse the LST Reports: See https://www.lstreports.com/schools/cardozo/jobs and https://www.lstreports.com/schools/fordham/jobs. Fordham has the edge, BUT is it worth going about $218K into debt for? I have a *very* hard to believing it is worth that.\n\nAt the end you ask about negotiating with Fordham, and that‚Äôs a smart move that I fully support. I‚Äôm currently working on a short article about negotiating with law schools, but I don‚Äôt think it will be about for about two weeks. The bottom line is that you should try it here because there‚Äôs clearly a chance you‚Äôd go to Fordham if they offered you more money (and you should have that figure in mind when you write them‚Äìdon‚Äôt be swayed because they offered you a little bit more; know beforehand exactly what number you think they need to reach to make it persuasive). I usually recommend negotiating by using offers from similar or more highly-ranked schools, but you don‚Äôt quite have that option here. So, be direct with them. Explain that Cardozo (and St. Johns, to make your case even stronger) has given you a full ride and that you find that attractive. Tell them that you prefer Fordham (assuming that‚Äôs the case), and ask not only for them to increase their offer but name a figure if you can. I‚Äôd think there‚Äôs a high chance they just sit tight here‚Äìwhile Cardozo is in the same area, Fordham is solidly higher in the USNews rankings than Cardozo (#36 vs #65, although neither school is in the top 50 according to the Above the Law rankings). Often when a school feels that the other school isn‚Äôt in their bracket they just ignore them and won‚Äôt negotiate. So that might happen here, but so what? Better to try it and see rather than wonder about it later. You unfortunately don‚Äôt have much leverage here (if Cornell had accepted you it would have been a card you could have played) so give it your best shot and see what happens.\n\nPlease let me know if that helps. Thanks!\n\nHi Roy,\n\nThanks for the question! I‚Äôm going to weigh in, but before I do so I‚Äôll make a general request for anyone else to weigh in as well about the point I‚Äôll raise, namely whether one should go to a better-regarded school or one that is lower-ranked but has a specialty program in your area of interest.\n\nMy experience is that you should typically go with the better school. The specialty programs are nice, but law firms/judges/companies/governmental organizations all seem to look for the students with the best grades from the best schools. Specialty programs are considered a bonus, but they are window dressing of sorts‚Äìemployers want the best lawyers, and they assume the best lawyers come from the better schools. So for me, W+L jumps right off the page as not only well-regarded across the board, but also priced basically the same as Northeastern. And, look at the W+L job numbers when they compare to the other two schools‚Äìit‚Äôs not even close. This is the better-regarded school with far better job outcomes, all at the same cost. Plus, on the personal side, I‚Äôve sent several students who were friends there who loved it, so I have anecdotal experience about the school that is very positive.\n\nAs far as location, I always say that it depends on the person. But, you‚Äôve already thrived in a similar VA environment (your words!) and so you know that won‚Äôt be an issue. And you will have far better job options after graduating, and can then choose a city option (and, to be honest, you don‚Äôt want city distractions while in law school if you‚Äôve never experienced them‚Äìyou should be a study hermit while in school!).\n\nLast, my compliments to both Loyola and Northeastern here‚Äìthey‚Äôve made this a legit argument by doing what smaller schools need to do to compete against better ranked schools: specializing in interesting programs and creating programs that appeal to narrow but highly committed bands of users. I can‚Äôt give them enough compliments here for that and it‚Äôs a strategy I strongly endorse for other schools in similar positions.\n\nOk, so I think I‚Äôve stated my position here pretty clearly: aside from all the attractions and specialties elsewhere, I‚Äôd be all in on W+L given the job, cost, and prestige factors. However, you should seek alternate opinions. Ask some current law students and attorneys what they think about specialty programs and how they should be weighed vs overall job numbers and rankings. I‚Äôll also tweet this out from my personal account (https://twitter.com/DaveKilloran) and see if anyone wants to add their thoughts. And if anyone else is reading, by all means add your thoughts if you have any!\n\nOne more point: I‚Äôm a believer that the only opinion that counts is yours. If you feel like one of the other schools is the best call for you personally, then go with your gut. Only you know what will be best for you. Grades mean everything, and if another school puts you in the best spot to produce high grades, then it might be the better choice.\n\nPlease let me know if this helps, and good luck with the decision. I‚Äôd love to know which way you decide to go so please post back along the way! Thanks!\n\nHi Claire,\n\nFirst off, as a native Minnesotan and lifelong Vikings/Twins/Gophers fan, let me apologize to you for your parents deciding to raise you in Wisconsin. That was cruel and unusual of them. You choosing to go to UW is all on you though üôÇ\n\nAll joking aside, you have the classic debt vs prestige argument you see all over these pages. Here‚Äôs what you should do: go look at the debt you would accrue‚Äìboth via tuition/school costs and moving/living costs in Michigan‚Äìand then take a look at the monthly fee needed to service that debt. It‚Äôs a sobering number. Now, go to the UW number and consider that resulting monthly debt. It‚Äôs $0 or close to it. So, whatever decision you make here is going to have to result in it being worth the monthly payment of the first number. And it can‚Äôt be a hope‚Äìit has to be a guarantee. That takes us to a comparison of the relative position of the two schools.\n\nAnd here I don‚Äôt see that big number being justified. This isn‚Äôt #8 vs a 4th tier school; this is #8 vs #30. Wisconsin has an extremely well-regarded law school (not quite as high as Minnesota‚Äôs though üòâ and you will have solid prospects when you graduate.\n\nSecond, let‚Äôs look at jobs and geography. If you were dead-set on a biglaw job in NYC and the school in question was Harvard or Columbia vs Wisconsin, then again I could see this debate being more intense. But you‚Äôre looking at Milwaukee and the other school in question is geographically proximate Michigan. Even if you moved to Chicago, both schools still play well in that market. So again I don‚Äôt see it being worth the money.\n\nLast, let‚Äôs talk about your friends who are basically insisting that you take on $273.5K in debt. Two questions: did they receive scholarships to their schools or not (in other words, did they make the same debt-laden choice) and if not, could this be a case of others wanting to pull you down into the same position since misery loves company? Because I can‚Äôt imagine a current law student isn‚Äôt at least aware of the fact that there is no such thing as a guaranteed outcome for any school. Sure, Harvard gives you a better chance at certain killer jobs, but there are students at Harvard who are finishing in the bottom half of class and aren‚Äôt finding it simple, easy, or guaranteed. An internet search should reveal lots of discussions about this exact issue, and it‚Äôs in no way commonly accepted that pay full ride at a top school is the obvious or right choice!\n\nThe motivation of your parents may be monetary, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they are wrong. This is #30 vs #8‚Äìit‚Äôs close enough that I would stick with the feeling you seem to have that Wisconsin is the better choice (that actually means more than usual given my antipathy towards Wisconsin üôÇ\n\nThe only way I think you should consider changing your thoughts on this is if Michigan were to come up with a very attractive financial aid package, along the lines of more than 50%.\n\nPlease let me know if this helps. Thanks!\n\nHey Mike,\n\nThanks so much for adding in this update! Just so everyone can see the rankings‚Äìwhich do matter since they reflect general perceptions‚ÄìI‚Äôm going to add those in here:\n\nU Miami Tuition non-discounted (150k) ‚Äì 75k scholarship = 75k debt\n\nemployment/unemployment scores 60.4/19.9\n\nUSNews: #77 ATL: Unranked\n\nFlorida tuition non-discounted (67k) ‚Äì 9k scholarship = 58k debt\n\nemployment/unemployment scores 76.2/16.2\n\nUSNews: #41 ATL: 30\n\nCardozo tuition non-discounted (168k) ‚Äì 114k scholarship = 54k debt\n\nemployment/unemployment scores 67.7/16.9\n\nUSNews: #65 ATL: Unranked\n\nSt. Johns tuition non-discounted (165k) ‚Äì 141k scholarship = 24k debt\n\nemployment/unemployment scores 69.8/15.3\n\nUSNews: #72 ATL: Unranked\n\nHofstra tuition non discounted 55k ‚Äì full ride = no debt\n\nemployment/unemployment scores 65.8/22.6\n\nUSNews: #118 ATL: Unranked\n\nIn your earlier comment, you also said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Long Island and want to get into NYC big law.. at least that‚Äôs my plan for now. I also went to undergrad in florida so have interested in heading down south‚Ä¶Being in Florida would be awesome but I wouldn‚Äôt want to ruin my chances at a good NYC job.‚Äù\n\nOk, all of that together allows us to start making some evaluations. As usual, my disclaimer is that this assumes all else is equal, and that each school is a school you want to attend and would be a good place for you. Only you know the true answers there, so rely on your own judgment üôÇ\n\nI grouped the two Florida schools together due to market proximity. In the case of Florida and Miami, that lower tuition makes Florida cheaper, and then you can see that their rankings are stronger. Importantly to me, Florida made the ATL Top 50 list, and I like their reliance on costs and job outcomes. So, between Florida and Miami, I‚Äôd choose Florida. I like Miami‚Äôs big city location‚Äìand better proximity to the small, tough, but growing Miami biglaw market‚Äìbut it‚Äôs hard to beat better reputation and less debt.\n\nWith the New York area schools, it would probably be St. Johns for me. I love Hofstra‚Äôs no debt outcome, but St. John‚Äôs is only $24K in total debt, and they are much more highly regarded overall (which is reflected in the rankings). I generally like Cardozo, and I know their big firm placement is slightly better than St. John‚Äôs, but overall job stats are a shade worse and it‚Äôs also $30K more than St. John‚Äôs.\n\nSo, that reduces the field to Florida and St. Johns for me. Now you get into real decision problems based on where you want to practice and debt levels. Florida has the better reputation and ranking, but costs $34K more, and it‚Äôs miles away from that NYC market and so doesn‚Äôt do quite as well with big firm placement. I‚Äôd probably go Florida but it‚Äôs a coin toss. In NYC maybe the uniqueness of being a Florida grad gets you some passing interest vs being a grad of a local school they see tons of people from. I don‚Äôt like the higher cost but I do like the higher ATL ranking. Tough call.\n\nPlease let me know what you think of that breakdown. Thanks!\n\nHi Breanne,\n\nThanks for the message! This is a tough one too. In this case you have a Top 25 law school in Minnesota that looks to be near free for you vs a Top 5 law school in Chicago, which has national and international recognition. I find decisions of this sort (good vs great) to be a real challenge, mainly because I know that if I were in your shoes I‚Äôd be facing the exact same mental arguments, and perhaps one even closer to you than you think since my whole family is from Minnesota and I graduated high school from the area (Minnetonka represent! üôÇ So, in this case, I feel like I understand all the non-personal factors in play very well but even with all that knowledge, I don‚Äôt have a clear answer for you.\n\nSo, let‚Äôs reduce this down to what it really is: you‚Äôre paying $250K to go to a higher-ranked school. That‚Äôs pretty much the simple trade here, and it‚Äôs basically as if someone walked into your living room and said give me a check and instead of Minnesota you can go to UChicago. When I put it that way to you, does it change your outlook in any way? Do you suddenly think that maybe that‚Äôs a mistake? Or do you think to yourself that that sounds like a good deal, and it‚Äôs one you‚Äôd make every day of the week? How you respond there can tell you which way you are leaning so listen closely to your gut reaction.\n\nThe other thing to do is to go look at exactly what $250K in debt looks like in monthly payments. Check out these two sites:\n\nMichigan Law Debt Wiz Calculator: https://www.law.umich.edu/financialaid/debtwizard/Pages/Debt-Wizard-Calc‚Ä¶\n\nWashington Post Student Loan Debt Calculator: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/business/student-loan-debt-‚Ä¶\n\nThat will help give you a sense of whether this is a good decision for you. Obviously, Chicago gives you opportunities that you don‚Äôt see at a lot of schools, even Minnesota. But it‚Äôs a trade of opportunities for cash. For many students that works out well, but not for everyone so examine the options closely.\n\nLast, when other people see a high-level door open to someone else, the natural tendency is to tell that person to take the opportunity. Years ago, this wouldn‚Äôt have even been a conversation. But since the economic meltdown and the subsequent difficulties in the legal profession, this is not longer a slam-dunk yes to Chicago. So, that‚Äôs my way of saying that you should devalue what your friends say. Look at the facts instead as much as you can:)\n\nPlease let me know what you think, and definitely let me know what you decide! Thanks and good luck!\n\nHey Chase,\n\nThanks for the message! First off, congrats on the amazing choice you have here. Both schools are fantastic, and to get money at Harvard is great but to also have no tuition at Penn is fabulous. There aren‚Äôt enough adjectives to describe how nice your position is here.\n\nThere are two parts where I think I can provide assistance: the debt/job question and the geographic reach of Penn. Let‚Äôs start by referring to something you said, namely that: ‚ÄúThe more I read about BigLaw, the more scared I get. I don‚Äôt want to spend the first ten years of my professional life, stuck in an 80 hr/week job, with no time to settle down and start a family. This is really important to me, and I‚Äôd take a much lower starting salary (than the 180K) in a smaller firm if it meant less hours/cutthroat/anxiety.‚Äù That comment jumped off the page at me because you are quite clear there that being bogged down by a lot of debt and having to take a BigLaw job that grinds the life out of you is NOT something you are at all interested in. It‚Äôs also really great that you already know that and can articulate it at this point in the process. Many students don‚Äôt realize that they feel this way until they are actually in one of those jobs, and ordering Chinese food at 11 PM while working in the office on a Saturday night. So, while $60K is still a significant amount of debt, with the employment prospects of Penn it is certainly manageable. And, actually, $189K is also manageable when you have Harvard on your resume. So either choice here would work out, but obviously when you are so clear about debt-avoidance (or really, BigLaw associate avoidance), that tends to tilt the decision towards Penn in my mind. I believe you also feel that way, and it‚Äôs why you raised the concern over Penn‚Äôs geographic influence.\n\nSo let‚Äôs talk about Penn‚Äôs national reputation. Penn is a perennial T14 school (ranked #7 this year, as you surely know), and they are generally a well-known school nationally and internationally. Are they quite as well-recognized as Harvard or Stanford? No, they aren‚Äôt on that level. Those schools live in a special strata that includes the most famous universities in the world (like Oxford and Cambridge in England). Penn is one cut below those schools from a reputation standpoint. But still that is quite excellent. To analogize, it‚Äôs like saying that a player isn‚Äôt Michael Jordan. Ok, so the player isn‚Äôt the best in history but that doesn‚Äôt mean the player isn‚Äôt good. Maybe they are Charles Barkley or Kareem or Magic‚Äìstill great in their own right. One way to see that is to examine the job placement of Penn grads (via LST Reports at https://www.lstreports.com/schools/penn/jobs/), where you can see that federal clerkships go to 10.6% of the class. Clerkships are prestigious and highly desirable, and 10% is an extraordinarily high figure (compare it to #15 Georgetown, for example, which sends 3.5% of its students to federal clerkship positions (which is actually a great number compared to most other schools, but is nowhere near the class of Penn). Second, where do Penn grads go to practice? Are they locally constrained and forced to stay in the area? No, they aren‚Äôt. Only 12.5% practice in Pennsylvania (compare that to a school like Minnesota that has 55% of its grads practicing in MN). Per LST, Penn‚Äôs geographic placement is as follows:\n\nNY: 48.8%\n\nPA: 12.5%\n\nDC: 9.6%\n\nTexas: 5.8%\n\nSo, Texas is the fourth state on the placement list, and probably the figure could be higher if more Penn grads applied for Texas jobs. In other words, the school will play well in Texas, and you shouldn‚Äôt have any problems having a degree from there when seeking employment in TX.\n\nBottom line is that if you want to avoid debt then you can safely choose Penn and feel good about it: it‚Äôs a great school with a strong national reputation, and because of that the grads do well in both quality of position as well as location. It‚Äôs a top 10 school, and given the lowered debt you‚Äôd leave with, it‚Äôs an incredibly attractive offer. If you instead choose Harvard, well, you‚Äôve got Harvard on your resume and after that all you need to do is punch out some solid 1L grades and you‚Äôll be set.\n\nLast, if you still can‚Äôt decide, put deposits down at both schools and buy yourself some time. It‚Äôs a totally practice, adn this decision is big enough that if you need more time, then it‚Äôs worth paying for. See http://blog.spiveyconsulting.com/multiple_deposits/ for more info if needed.\n\nPlease let me know if that helps, and please let me know what you decide to do!\n\nHello!\n\nI have been struggling with a very tough decision for a few days now, so I‚Äôm SO glad I stumbled across this blog!!\n\nSo, first of all, some background: I live in Little Rock, AR, and my original intent to go to law school was to practice law in this area (kind of interested in getting involved in local politics; my ultimate goal is to eventually become a judge ‚Äî but not exactly sure what kind of law I want to practice when I get out). I got accepted to the local law school here in downtown Little Rock, William H. Bowen School of Law, with almost a full-ride scholarship. I‚Äôm not even sure what they‚Äôre ranked, but it‚Äôs not in the top 100 ‚Äî the benefit here is that I *think* this is where I want to practice, and I could get out of school with only maybe $10,000 or so in debt.\n\nHowever, I was also placed on the priority wait list at Emory (#22), and I went to visit the campus this past weekend. When speaking with the dean of admissions, he made it sound like I had a pretty good chance of getting in (they said they only didn‚Äôt admit one or two people from the priority wait list in recent years). If I do get the call that I‚Äôm admitted (which could be at any time), I will only have 48 hours to make my decision (!!!). Hence my anxiety about this.\n\nFrom visiting Emory law school and speaking to students/faculty, it is clear that this is a FAR superior law school than what I would have if I stayed at home, but I would most definitely come out of school with AT LEAST $100,000 in debt (if you combine the cost of tuition + the cost of moving and the cost of living in a new city), even with a decent scholarship (they typically don‚Äôt award more than half the cost of tuition, which is around $50K per year). The appeal here for me, I think, is that even though I am pretty sure I want to end up back in AR, I feel like I wouldn‚Äôt be limited to that if I got my education at a school that is recognized on the national level.\n\nThe question I‚Äôm wrestling with is whether or not paying that much more for that superior education would be worth it? Do you think it would have the potential to open up more doors even here in Little Rock if I did return? Or is taking the money and going to school locally going to actually wind up establishing better connections for myself in the future?\n\nALSO‚Ä¶not to complicate things further, but I also applied to Vanderbilt and am still waiting to hear back from them. Going to school there has always kind of been my dream, and it is a little bit closer to home (only about 4 hours instead of 8.5) ‚Äî so if I got in there, even without a scholarship, I feel like that might be even harder to pass up. But I‚Äôm still faced with the same question: would it be worth it? And more importantly: am I completely stupid for passing on that kind of opportunity if I do decide to stay here in Little Rock?\n\nThanks in advance!!\n\nHi Melissa,\n\nThanks for the message! First off, while this may be a difficult choice, the nice thing is that you have two excellent options to select from, and so I don‚Äôt think you can make a bad decision here üôÇ\n\nIf we break down the numbers (excluding cost of living for now), then what you have told me so far reduces to the following:\n\nVanderbilt: $54K a year ‚Äì $27K scholarship = $27K/year = $81K over three years\n\nMichigan: $58K a year ‚Äì $20K scholarship = $38K/year = $114K over three years\n\nSo, as you clearly saw, those apparently small differences added up to a final $33K difference in tuition costs! Now, if we stop right there it looks like Vanderbilt has a significant edge. But Michigan is in Ann Arbor, a relatively small town, and Vanderbilt is in Nashville, a larger city (and an awesome one too, in case you‚Äôve never been there). That makes a difference since the Cost of Living (COL) in Ann Arbor is generally less than Nashville. According to LST, it‚Äôs the following (includes books and living expenses):\n\nNashville, TN Cost of Living: $24,910/yr = $74,730 total\n\nAnn Arbor, MI Cost of Living: $19,010/yr = $57,030 total\n\nThat difference favors Ann Arbor by about $17.7K, and makes the final debt totals closer:\n\nVanderbilt: Tuition $81K + COL $74,730 = $155,730\n\nMichigan: Tuition $114K + COL $57,030 = $171,030\n\nThus, when COL is added in, the gap narrows to $15,300. That‚Äôs still significant, but much closer than before.\n\nOk, now that we have a firm grasp of the numbers, the first consideration is for you to go look at some debt calculators (which you may have done, but I‚Äôll repeat the advice here for the benefit of others). Check out:\n\nMichigan Law Debt Wiz Calculator: https://www.law.umich.edu/financialaid/debtwizard/Pages/Debt-Wizard-Calc‚Ä¶ (which is extremely convenient since Michigan is one of the choices here)\n\nWashington Post Student Loan Debt Calculator: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/business/student-loan-debt-‚Ä¶\n\nNext, let‚Äôs look at the job outcomes at both schools to see if the extra $15.3K might be justifiable:\n\n*Vanderbilt*\n\nUS News Ranking: 17\n\nATL Ranking: 14\n\nEmployment Score: 78.9%\n\nUnder-employment Score: 13.5%\n\nLarge Firm: 37.3%\n\nSmall Firm: 4.3%\n\nFederal Clerkship: 9.7%\n\nPublic Service: 11.9%\n\n*Michigan*\n\nUS News Ranking: 8\n\nATL Ranking: 13\n\nEmployment Score: 85.0%\n\nUnder-employment Score: 10.5%\n\nLarge Firm: 50.8%\n\nSmall Firm: 1.4%\n\nFederal Clerkship: 10.2%\n\nPublic Service: 12.7%\n\nSo, are those numbers enough to justify a slightly higher price tag? I think so. Overall employment results are better, especially at the more desirable large firm and clerkship jobs. Toss in some smaller but useful considerations (such as bar passage: Vandy 85.7% vs Michigan 93.7%) and I feel like there is a reasonable argument for thinking that Michigan is worth the extra $15.3K. That said, something you mentioned in your initial message also makes me feel that the extra money is warranted, mainly your comment that, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to attend Michigan.‚Äù So, that‚Äôs the school you want to go to, and since the costs are so close and the job outcomes are a bit better, I see no reason for you not to go ahead with it. If it is indeed the environment where you will be happiest, then that has an economic value since happy students typically perform better overall than unhappy or less happy students.\n\nSo, to make a long story short, I think you have all the evidence and justification you need to support your desire to go to Michigan üôÇ\n\nPlease let me know what you decide to do‚ÄìI‚Äôd love to know. Thanks!\n\nHi Christine,\n\nThanks for the message. Wow, having to make a major life-changing decision in only 48 hours is a tough spot to be in! So, knowing that you could be faced with that prospect, you need to do everything within your power right *now* to put all of the relevant information and decision-making tools at your finger tips. That way, when the time comes, you can move quickly and confidently to make the best decision for you. With that in mind, let‚Äôs talk about it.\n\nFirst, you need to assemble all of the financial information that you can, and be as detailed as possible. Start researching now what it would cost to live in Atlanta or Nashville (prepare for all outcomes, not just the most likely ones). Consider things like flights from those cities back home, or the cost of gas if you were to drive. Do that for each year and then multiply it out by three, for each year of law school. Get detailed! If you don‚Äôt have some of the info, ask. Put together a spreadsheet for each school and fill in every possible item. that way, instead of thinking that your debt would be at least 100K at Emory, you will be able to state the exact figure.\n\nSecond, use some financial calculation tools to get a sense of what different debt levels look like. Here are two that you can start with, but there are others:\n\nMichigan Law Debt Wiz Calculator: https://www.law.umich.edu/financialaid/debtwizard/Pages/Debt-Wizard-Calc‚Ä¶\n\nWashington Post Student Loan Debt Calculator: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/business/student-loan-debt-‚Ä¶\n\nPut in different numbers to get a sense of monthly payments, how long it would take to pay off certain debt numbers, etc. This is an important step because it makes the debt real. It‚Äôs really easy in these conversations to toss number out like $53K or $181K and have them not feel real. A monthly debt service payment makes it feel a lot more real üôÇ\n\nOk, you should both of those things as soon as you can. Next, let‚Äôs place the schools in perspective by comparing them to each other. In that process I‚Äôll use rankings from US News and Above the Law, and as much as I think rankings systems have natural flaws, they are useful because they reflect how other people perceive the schools.\n\n*Emory*\n\nUSNews Rank: 22\n\nATL Rank: 38\n\n*Vanderbilt*\n\nUSNews Rank: 17\n\nATL Rank: 14\n\n*Arkansas-Little Rock*\n\nUSNews Rank: 134\n\nATL Rank: Unranked (not in top 50)\n\nSo, as you‚Äôve noted, there‚Äôs a big difference in perceptions between Emory and Vandy vs UALR. You also sensed that when visiting Emory, since you said that ‚Äúthis is a FAR superior law school than what I would have if I stayed at home.‚Äù\n\nNext, as we will see, that rankings/perception difference has a significant impact on job prospects (all numbers drawn from LST Reports at https://www.lstreports.com/schools/):\n\n*Emory*\n\nUSNews Rank: 22\n\nATL Rank: 38\n\nEmployment Score: 75.0%\n\nUnder-employment score: 15.9%\n\nLarge Firm: 26%\n\nSmall Firm: 15.3%\n\nFederal Clerkship: 3.9%\n\nPublic Service: 17.5%\n\n*Vanderbilt*\n\nUSNews Rank: 17\n\nATL Rank: 14\n\nEmployment Score: 78.9%\n\nUnder-employment score: 13.5%\n\nLarge Firm : 37.3%\n\nSmall Firm: 4.3%\n\nFederal Clerkship: 9.7%\n\nPublic Service: 11.9%\n\n*Arkansas-Little Rock*\n\nUSNews Rank: 134\n\nATL Rank: Unranked (not in top 50)\n\nEmployment Score: 44.4%\n\nUnder-employment score: 23.8%\n\nLarge Firm: 0.8%\n\nSmall Firm: 22.2%\n\nFederal Clerkship: 0.8%\n\nPublic Service: 23%\n\nI‚Äôm going to be honest: the Bowen numbers aren‚Äôt good. Not just a bit worse than Vandy or Emory, but a lot worse, and plain bad on their own without being compared to a T25 school. The one thing that gives me some pause is that their bar passage rate is 76.3%, which isn‚Äôt bad especially since the Arkansas bar is rumored to be somewhat harder than average.\n\nSo then, one of your main questions was whether the extra debt is worth it. We don‚Äôt have the exact debt numbers so we can‚Äôt judge that yet, but from the above employment figures there is certainly a very reasonable chance that extra debt would indeed be worth it.\n\nThe second main question you had involved your area of practice vs where you went to school. The general rule is that at a certain level, big names open doors no matter where you are. The Harvards of the world allow you to go to any city and be competitive. When we talk about Vanderbilt and Emory, we move down a step and one would say that both schools have more of a regional presence than a national presence. Of the two, Vanderbilt is closer to having a full-scale national presence than is Emory; Emory is decidedly more a southern region school than a national reputation school, but it is still well-known in legal circles. As a comparison, although the data was limited, only 22.2% of Vandy students stayed in Tennessee and 12.2% of students went to New York:\n\n‚Ä¢ TN: 22.1%\n\n‚Ä¢ NY: 12.2%\n\n‚Ä¢ TX: 8.1%\n\nAt Emory, 56.7% stayed in Georgia (much greater percent indicating stronger local ties as well as a stronger Atlanta legal market), and for New York it was also good, at 10.1%:\n\n‚Ä¢ GA: 56.7%\n\n‚Ä¢ NY: 10.1%\n\n‚Ä¢ FL: 6.7%\n\nThe numbers show the top 3 practice states for the grads of each school. The larger point is that both Emory and Vanderbilt are Top 25 schools with excellent reputations, and each has a strong enough reputation to allow their grads to go to the big legal arenas like NYC and compete for jobs. When you moved back to Little Rock, the reputation of each school will help you, and in many ways it might be worth it to have a degree from one of those schools as opposed to just being another UALR grad (as a reference, here are the Bowen numbers: AR: 71.2%; TX: 6.7%; MO: 2.9%. In other words, 4 out of 5 Bowen grads stay in the area, and thus they flood the market each year. One question here is do you want to be one of those many grads looking for a job or would you prefer to be coming in from out of town with a brighter, shinier degree? Who do you think looks more attractive to prospective employers?). Bottom line is that the fact that you hope to be in Little Rock is not a reason for you to automatically select Bowen. All else being equal, I‚Äôd personally take a degree from either Emory or Vandy vs Bowen as I think I‚Äôd prefer to stand out. And, of course, a Bowen degree basically limits you to Little Rock; a degree from Emory or Vanderbilt gives you many more options if something doesn‚Äôt open up for you in LR.\n\nThe last thing I‚Äôll suggest is for you to read all of the comments in this blog. In each case, the student has described the choice they are making, and then I reply and discuss the relevant factors. I want you to read each situation because it will help you see the types of choices and considerations other students faced, and it will also allow you to see the way I prioritized each factor. For example, I tend to be very debt-averse, but I‚Äôll let better job prospects outweigh debt in certain cases. But, if the schools are fairly similar, then I‚Äôll almost always go for the money (example, full ride at Northwestern vs full tuition at Chicago; I take Northwestern since it‚Äôs a top school and you graduate with no debt). In your case, the schools in play are very different, especially in the employment results. While I can‚Äôt see your final debt numbers, I can take a guess at them and I have a strong suspicion that if I were in your shoes I‚Äôd be leaning towards Emory/Vanderbilt.\n\nOk, that‚Äôs a long post but it‚Äôs important for you to run the numbers here and think about this choice very carefully, and to do so as quickly as possible. Please let me know what you think, and good luck!\n\nHi Taylor,\n\nThanks for the question! This is a challenging decision, and I tend to think that no matter what you decide you‚Äôll have some uncertainties over whether it was the right decision, and that is because there are positives on both sides here.\n\nWhile reading what you wrote, there were two things that jumped out at me, and the first was your statement that ‚ÄúI am shooting for a federal clerkship and then biglaw for a few years in either NY or DC.‚Äù If that was the only consideration, then obviously UVA would be the better choice as shown by large firm/clerkships percentages: UVA = 54.5%/15.8% vs BYU = 7.5%/2.3%. That‚Äôs 70% vs 10%, or a 7 times better chance at the path you seek at UVA. Basically, the two schools are on different planets as far as job placement, which is to be expected when one of them is a T10 school. I realize that BYU has a strong alumni network (and one that tends to have stronger personal relationships than many others), but it can‚Äôt compete with the sheer power of the UVA name.\n\nSo, based on the above it would seem that I am advocating for UVA. But then the second consideration comes in, which your friends nicely summed up by saying, ‚Äúunless one gets into HYS, they should go to BYU.‚Äù This is a saying you hear with some frequency, and the reason it is so popular is that there‚Äôs a degree of truth to it. The HYS schools are like the superpowers of the law school universe, and offer a name that opens doors no matter where you go. UVA, while outstanding, is a cut below those schools (maybe two cuts if you look at the CCN trio as its own level). You are rightly concerned about going into $231K of debt, and I personally have a hard time justifying taking that on. That is especially the case since BYU is generally considered one of the best deals in the law school world ‚Äî a well-regarded school at a relatively reasonable price.\n\nSo, that probably didn‚Äôt help much üôÇ I think that given your background and comfort with Provo and the BYU school environment, I‚Äôd probably say avoid the massive debt and go with BYU. It‚Äôs a very good school and the price is very nice. But I understand the siren call of a top-ranked school like UVA, and in one sense you are directly lowering your chances of obtaining the career path you seek if you choose BYU. Interestingly enough, in this case we can quantify that trade, as those improved job outcomes cost exactly $143,000 more. Is that too much to bear? I can‚Äôt say, but I would urge you to use something like the Michigan Law Debt Wiz Calculator: https://www.law.umich.edu/financialaid/debtwizard/Pages/Debt-Wizard-Calc‚Ä¶ to get a sense of how that extra $143K affects monthly payments.\n\nJust as an aside, a decision like this has elements of game theory behind it, but one way to look at this is that UVA offers a wider array of outcomes, including both good and bad results. The potential job outcomes are seemingly better on the top end, but if things didn‚Äôt go well the debt load could result in some very negative results. BYU, on the other hand, could be characterized as resulting in a narrower set of outcomes, with few potential bad outcomes but also fewer topline results. You could consider this the choice of locking in a more reliable set of middle-range outcomes (and again, this is generalizing; you could go to BYU and have a result that is the best possible one for you) vs a more risk-taking approach that increases the possibilities at both ends. If it helps, you should consider what type of person and risk-taker you are‚Äîdoes one of those two characterizations immediately feel more comfortable to you?\n\nPlease let me know if that helps. Thanks!\n\nHey Alex,\n\nInteresting set of choices! Would you mind breaking down each school‚Äôs ranking/finances/employment numbers in the manner I‚Äôve done above? That‚Äôs where we start with every discussion simply so the numbers are as clear as possible to you. Here are the links we use to obtain the info:\n\nhttps://www.lstreports.com/schools\n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/law-rankings\n\nhttp://abovethelaw.com/careers/2016-law-school-rankings/\n\nAnd here‚Äôs an example of how it looks for one sample school:\n\nFlorida\n\nTuition non-discounted (67k) ‚Äì 9k scholarship = 58k debt\n\nemployment/unemployment scores 76.2/16.2\n\nUSNews: #41 ATL: 30\n\nI‚Äôll sometimes go deeper if there are specific practice states or job types in play, and since you mentioned biglaw, if you could, add in the job type percentages from LST Reports (such as Large Firm, Small Firm, Fed Clerkship percentage, etc) as so:\n\nLarge Firm 11.2%\n\nSmall Firm 27.4%\n\nFederal Clerkship 2.6%\n\nPublic Service 16.2%\n\nOnce you have that info posted, I have a feeling we‚Äôll start to see some of the choices rise to the top and others fall‚Äìsuch as the full ride at Case will knock out UConn pretty easily üôÇ I keep a close eye on this blog, so when I see you post back, I‚Äôll come back in as quickly as I can and provide some further thoughts on the school choices.\n\nOk, while we wait for that, let‚Äôs talk transferring. Here‚Äôs my basic rule for transferring: There‚Äôs no guarantees when it comes to transferring, so don‚Äôt attend a school unless you‚Äôd be happy graduating from the school. That said, the reason there are no guarantees is because your ability to transfer will rest on your first year grades and the quality of the school you are transferring from. The grades are huge, and that can be a challenge because the typical 1L law school grade is derived solely from the final. So, nail the final and doors start to open up. But if you have one bad day or exam, then it‚Äôs over. And law school is so unusual that even if you‚Äôve been a great student your whole life there is no guarantee that that will continue in law school.\n\nNow, let‚Äôs say you go out and do quite well, and your class rank is high. From there, it depend son how high your rank is as well as the school you attend. In general, the rule is that the better the school, the more room you have with your grades. For example, if you were trying to transfer to #10 Duke, if you were coming from #23 Minnesota you could transfer over with slightly lower grades than if you were coming from #51 Baylor. In other words, the lower ranked your starting school is, the higher your grades need to be. And, past evidence shows that at a certain point, the top schools stop taking students. For example, Harvard just doesn‚Äôt take transfer students from the bottom tier of law schools. However, when you slide down the rankings scale, it loosens up. So, when you talk about transferring up, we have to consider not just grades but that starting school as well (that said, Case would allow you to transfer into the T14, maybe even higher if you absolutely killed it on the grades).\n\nLast note, if you transferred out of Case, you lose the scholarship at that point. You probably know that, but it‚Äôs worth mentioning here for others.\n\nThanks and I look forward to hearing back from you!\n\nHi Drew,\n\nThanks for the question! Well, this is more or less the quintessential question behind the blog title here: should you go for the free ride at a lower-ranked school or go into debt for the prestige of a highly ranked name? The answer for each person is different, and as I‚Äôve spoken with all the students in this comments section I‚Äôve found that each person has slightly different ways that they value and analyze the elements in play. Nobody likes debt, and if you‚Äôve read the other discussions you‚Äôve seen me repeatedly recommend that applicants considering going into debt should look at the repayment schedules and truly understand what $150K-$250K of debt looks like on a monthly basis. It can be significant and overwhelming, but you have to face the reality of the financial consequence of choosing that path. For some students the answer is that it‚Äôs too risky but for many others it‚Äôs not. I know that going to the debt-free school represents a safer pathway in a financial sense, because we can see a black and white difference in the monetary obligations that those individuals bear upon graduation. But it also often represents a demonstrably lower chance of securing the so called elite jobs in big firms and clerking for judges. This is where your goals and aspirations really do play a major role. For example, do you want to be a law professor? Then your chances increase more as the rank increases at the school you attend. In your case, I don‚Äôt get the biglaw/clerkship pathway as being something you have your heart set on. Will Michigan give you a better shot at any job compared to Wayne? Yeah, to be honest it will, and that goes even for those in-state jobs. Plus, so many of those Michigan grads leave the state because they can; the name gives them the clout to do so (and it also pulls in many more people form out of state than Wayne, which is also why they leave upon graduation).\n\nI think your decision needs to be driven by your comfort with these schools. Which one do you think will make you happier? Both will be competitive‚Äìjust because Wayne is ranked lower doesn‚Äôt mean that there won‚Äôt be pressure in class to perform or on the exams to ace them‚Äìbut if you feel Wayne is more to your liking, then you get a free education at a school you like. I don‚Äôt know you well enough to really contribute to this decision (I wish I did‚Äìit would be easier, right? üôÇ This decision has to be driven by deep introspection on your part about what you want out of law school and what you are willing to pay for the experience. Ask yourself how you feel about those monthly payments, and how you would feel about passing up the big name school. Talk to the people who know you best and ask their opinion. they can‚Äôt decide for you, but maybe they‚Äôll help you best understand your personal values and how those relate to the costs involved here.\n\nPlease let me knwo if that helps, and good luck‚ÄìI‚Äôd love to know what you ultimately decide!\n\nHi Kelly,\n\nThis is a bit tougher for me, and I would first off recommend that you do the basic analysis that I‚Äôve done in prior posts. That should always be your first step because citing numbers in a vacuum‚Äìsuch as an 81K scholarship‚Äìdoesn‚Äôt give a fully-realized idea of what the debt involved actually is. You need to know exactly what the final number as far as your debt at each school is. And by the way, this isn‚Äôt for me‚Äìit‚Äôs for you. As I‚Äôve said multiple times in the comments here, it really helps when *you* see what the monthly payment is for each school after you graduate. This is especially the case here since I don‚Äôt have any info about your financial situation, so the evaluation on this point has to be done entirely by you.\n\nOk, that said, this comes down to a balance between that monthly debt number and what kind of name recognition is worth the extra fee for you in NYC and then possibly later in international job markets. Vandy is a great school in one of the coolest towns in this country, but if you are trying to get a job in a city where they don‚Äôt know Vandy, then it isn‚Äôt worth as much to you. This is why it‚Äôs good that you are looking at the job numbers‚Äìthese tell the truest picture of how a school‚Äôs reputation works. I get the feeling that Vandy‚Äôs placement power surprises you a bit, but this is why you want to look at the stats and not go on perceptions.\n\nAs far as intentional placement, I can‚Äôt speak to that as much since Asian markets are quite varied and I‚Äôm not a specialist on placements in the various cities, and also because you are talking about that in several years time, not now. Also, the classes offered have little to no effect on my recommendations simply because so many students find that once in law school their interests turn out to be far different than what they expected (and because most law school courses are basically the same in the first year plus, meaning a high percentage of your legal education is the same at each school).\n\nIn the final analysis, I unfortunately don‚Äôt have enough information from you to give solid advice here. Your financials, your job location preferences and the chances of you staying here vs Asia, and even how you feel about Nashville all are blind spots to me right now. They aren‚Äôt to you though, and i would weigh each of those options and then decide if it‚Äôs worth the extra money per month that you have to pay to go to Cornell. Only you know the answer there, but if you approach it systematically and with stats, I think you can do a pretty good job of deciding üôÇ\n\nGood luck!\n\nHi Dennis,\n\nThanks for the reply! The first place I‚Äôm going to refer you to is the LST Report on OSU: https://www.lstreports.com/schools/osu/. This gives a very nice thumbnail sketch on how the school performs when it comes to job placement, salaries, and bar passage. You should also compare that to GW: https://www.lstreports.com/schools/gw/.\n\nThe comparison between those two would suggest to me that the full ride at OSU is generally the better choice. First, it‚Äôs free, whereas at GW she‚Äôd be walking out with a six figure debt load. Second, in comparison to GW, OSU also performs well in employment, which is really important to me when evaluating offers. The downside is that OSU places a LOT of grads into Ohio (80%), so her options for practice would most likely be in-state unless she is at the very top of her class (which is not easy at all to guarantee). GW places about half of their grads in DC and about 10% in NYC, so there is a bit broader feel to the options when you attend GW. However, you mentioned that she‚Äôs torn between DC and Ohio as practice locations, so for her it may be that this isn‚Äôt a big issue. To me, this is a critical point, and question she *really* needs to ask herself is: where do I want to practice and what type of job do I want? If Ohio is great, then take the money at OSU and don‚Äôt look back! If she‚Äôs a ‚Äúbit‚Äù interested in DC or ‚Äúkinda‚Äù would like to have the option, then again I‚Äôd say go with OSU. However, if she‚Äôs adamant that she wants a big-city practice or for sure wants biglaw, that‚Äôs when other options aside from OSU come into play.\n\nIf the latter is the case (and I suspect it isn‚Äôt based on your initial comments), then she has either a half scholarship at GW or the option of a year off for a try at a higher LSAT score. The decision factors involved get very personal here, and aren‚Äôt of the type that I can easily evaluate. Given her performance with minimal prep, I suspect she can raise her LSAT score further, which as I‚Äôve mentioned earlier would open doors at more highly-ranked schools as well as increase her financial aid packages. The cost is the extra year off, which is a huge cost! However, that cost is weighed against the debt load from GW, and through that prism I don‚Äôt think the cost looks so bad. Let‚Äôs say she could raise her score into the upper 160s. At that point, her aid package at a place like GW might well be increased a full ride, meaning she‚Äôd save something like $150K overall. In that light, taking a year off actually would make some sense. If she could do even better, then perhaps she‚Äôd be looking at great aid packages at even better schools, meaning even more would be saved (or gained, it depends on how you look at it).\n\nThus, in my opinion, her situation reduces to two primary questions:\n\n1. This is the question I posed above, namely, ‚Äúwhere does she want to practice and what type of job does she want?‚Äù Depending on her answer, then she‚Äôd either accept the OSU offer, or alternately consider my second question.\n\n2. This question only gets asked if the answer the first question shows that Ohio isn‚Äôt where she wants to end up, and her opinion on that is *very* strong. The question is: ‚ÄúHow much better could she do on the LSAT if she had another year to prepare for the exam?‚Äù If the answer is, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can improve much,‚Äù then take the OSU offer and don‚Äôt worry about this option. But if the answer is that she believes with good reason that she could do 5-6 points better (or more), then she should consider retaking the exam, and then re-applying, especially to schools in the T14 and schools with good rankings in larger cities (such as GW or Georgetown).\n\nI think this is an interesting situation, and although I‚Äôm generally anti-taking a year off, you can see how in her case it might actually make some sense. But for that to be the case, she has to be fully committed to what she wants because that course of action requires considerable time and effort. It could very well be worth it both economically and job-wise, but it‚Äôs not a path for the faint of heart.\n\nPlease let me know what she says‚ÄìI‚Äôm really interested in hearing what she think about the options. Thanks!\n\nHi Eliza,\n\nI‚Äôm actually from Minneapolis, which helps a bit in this case üôÇ\n\nThe Minneapolis legal market is pretty tight, and while the U is ranked well above both MH and UST, both MH and UST do pretty well placing grads into the Mpls market. The U tends to have the power to place grads a bit further afield (the #23 ranking helps there), so you see a lower placement rate into Minnesota and greater placement in larger legal markets like NY, IL, and CA. You probably know that, but it‚Äôs worth noting because it‚Äôs part of the reason their financial offer wasn‚Äôt as good as the other two.\n\nSo, we can see relative rankings but that doesn‚Äôt answer your question. And I‚Äôm not sure there is a perfect answer. Some would say take the ranking, others would say take the free ride. I tend to avoid debt as much as possible, but part of this depends on your career path, the type of firm you want to practice at, etc. So let‚Äôs start with job outcomes:\n\nMinnesota: https://www.lstreports.com/schools/minnesota/jobs/ ‚Äî 80.1% in Bar Passage Required jobs / 3.3% Unemployed\n\nMitchell Hamline: https://www.lstreports.com/schools/mitchell-hamline/jobs/ ‚Äî 61.6% in Bar Passage Required jobs / 17.5% Unemployed\n\nSt. Thomas: https://www.lstreports.com/schools/stthomas/jobs/ ‚Äî 58.5% in Bar Passage Required jobs / 5.5% Unemployed\n\nFederal circuit IP isn‚Äôt normally the province of solo practitioners or very small firms, so the job placement above makes some difference. I would spend serious time researching who is doing the representation at the federal level.\n\nNext, to your comment about you ‚Äúwould bust my butt to be in the top 5 at a regional school.‚Äù I like that sentiment a lot, but I‚Äôm going to be a realist here: every student enters with that mindset. Law school is very different than ‚Äúnormal‚Äù university, both in learning required and how exams are your entire grade. One good day or bad day can make or break you, and so I always tell students not to count on being at the very top of the class. There are just no guarantees.\n\nNext, about your connections. How good are they? Will they hire you no matter where you went to school? Because if not, then again there‚Äôs no guarantee.\n\nSo, at this point you are probably thinking, ‚ÄúOk then, I‚Äôm off to the U!‚Äù But then the financials kick in, and with the U costing about $230K over three years, if your aid is 18K a *year*, then you will be left with around $175K in debt. That‚Äôs a lot, almost $2K a month for the next decade. And so you have to balance that kind of cost against what your career goals are. This is why I suggested you take a close look at your connections and who practices the type of law you want to enter to see if you can take the free ride route, or whether that is going to require more name-brand power. That‚Äôs the part I can‚Äôt tell you about because I don‚Äôt have all the information that you do, but it gives you a starting point for a deeper analysis.\n\nPlease let me know if that helps. Thanks!\n\nHi George ‚Äì thanks for the questions! Let me try to take them one at a time üôÇ\n\nFirst, as to your age and family situation, there‚Äôs absolutely nothing that I‚Äôm hearing that makes me think you wouldn‚Äôt be an excellent candidate for law school! You‚Äôre what‚Äôs considered a non-traditional applicant due to being a little older than the average 1L (first year student), but schools appreciate diversity so that won‚Äôt be viewed negatively. It simply means you‚Äôll have some slightly unique choices to make when applying, like collecting your letters of recommendation from your professional career rather than your academic life‚ÄìI doubt you‚Äôre still in touch with college professors from your undergrad days, anyway‚Äìand whether you‚Äôd want to attend full-time in law school, or enter a part-time program which many schools offer.\n\nThose are decisions only you can make, of course, but on the whole there‚Äôs zero reason to think that you‚Äôre not a qualified candidate üôÇ\n\nSecond, schools in the LA area and scholarships. LA really has a wide variety of options nearby, from the quite prestigious USC and UCLA programs, to some great mid-range schools in Loyola and Pepperdine, to less highly-ranked but still attractive options like Southwestern.\n\nScholarships are available at each institution, however you‚Äôll find that a ‚Äúfull ride‚Äù is going to require very different, and sometimes unpredicted, elements at each. For instance, a full academic ride to UCLA is likely to require an undergrad GPA of nearly-4.0 and an LSAT score of at least 169+ (and probably more like 173+). You‚Äôll also need strong ‚Äúsofts‚Äù like a great personal statement, excellent letters of rec, and a compelling resume since you‚Äôve been out of school for at least 20 years I suspect.\n\nBut a full ride to Southwestern is going to be far easier to attain‚Äìthe LSAT score in particular can likely be at least 8-12 points lower than the UCLA numbers I gave and still leave you competitive‚Äìso it‚Äôs an entirely different metric.\n\nSo here‚Äôs your best bet right now. First, take a full, timed practice LSAT if you‚Äôve never done so before (or if it‚Äôs been a while, like more than 2-3 months ago). There‚Äôs a free one you can download here: https://www.lsac.org/docs/default-source/jd-docs/sampleptjune.pdf\n\nPrint it out, find some privacy, and then take the full test start to finish as four back-to-back sections of 35 minutes each. It‚Äôll take around 2.5 hours total.\n\nOnce you finish, create an account on our free self-study site so you can score your test: http://students.powerscore.com/self-study/index.cfm\n\nYou‚Äôll enter your answers and get comprehensive feedback on how you performed, so you‚Äôll know both your starting score as well as your natural strengths and weaknesses (and immediate areas for improvement). Based on that starting point, look at the local LA schools I mentioned and see how your starting score stacks up‚Äìyou can easily google data on each‚Äìas that will give you a better sense of how far you are from being financially attractive to these schools (for instance, UCLA‚Äôs median LSAT score is around a 167 whereas Southewestern‚Äôs is a 152).\n\nThen you can decide how best to prep to get your score up to a level to make you scholarship-competitive, depending on which school you‚Äôd like to attend and what‚Äôs most realistic! Just check out our prep options on our main LSAT page http://www.powerscore.com/lsat/ and let us know if you have any questions!\n\nI hope that helps!\n\nHi Justin,\n\nSorry for the delay in replying! Yours is a tough question, and I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs a clearly right‚Äîor wrong‚Äîdirection to take here. The base comparison between Arizona, Florida, and UNLV shows a lot of similarities, although you are correct about the biglaw placement differential at UNLV (on the other hand, they perform better on the clerkship front, which could partially be a product of location: see https://www.lstreports.com/compare/arizona/florida/unlv/). I will note that Florida is a larger school than either Arizona or UNLV, and graduates just under 3 times as many students each year (despite that, UF is on an upward trend and should see some rise in the rankings in the next few years).\n\nSo, assuming for a moment that those schools are pretty similar, let‚Äôs look at two things you said:\n\n1. ‚Äù I‚Äôm 37 years old, so the thought of an extra 60k in debt (at least) from Emory when I graduate at 41 feels a bit scary.‚Äù\n\nI think this is an important consideration, because your earning horizon is shorter than for younger grads. Given all else you‚Äôve mentioned, I have a hard time justifying taking on debt when you can avoid it by going to other schools where you‚Äôd feel just as comfortable. Yes, Emory does well at biglaw, but the rest of their employment numbers aren‚Äôt so great as to suggest it‚Äôs a great trade to take on debt.\n\n2. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd feel most comfortable living in Las Vegas (I have family and friends there)‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI am a big fan of attending the school where you will feel comfortable, since comfort often helps ease that transition you go through as a 1L. I like the fact that you‚Äôd be content anywhere (which is probably also a partial product of you being 37) but it sounds like you are already familiar with Las Vegas and have a support system there. If you can perform well out of the gate, it makes a HUGE difference to your employment prospects, because 1L grades are everything when it comes to jobs.\n\nI think that your base question was about passing up Emory, and while I don‚Äôt have all the data, what I see tells me that it wouldn‚Äôt be a bad choice for you to do that. As for the remaining schools, I see advantages to each one, so it really comes down to how you feel about each, but a free education from any one of them is hard to beat üôÇ\n\nPlease let me know if that helps. Thanks!\n\nHi Dave,\n\nThank you for the swift reply! I apologize, it is a bit of a specialized question. I would say amongst more recent grads it is true there is a T20 if not a T10 bias. Having gotten into UCLA and waitlisted at a T10 I think I could get into that tier if I reapplied in two years, but probably would have to take on debt. I am trying to weigh the opportunity cost of waiting and graduating later vs. going now to a lower ranked school with somewhat concerning employment numbers. Of Northeastern‚Äôs grads who are employed, the vast majority (25%) are employed in public interest, so that is good, but still a 28% underemployment rate is concerning to me.\n\nAs to your second question, many people working in my area of interest have both the JD & MPH, with some only having one of the other, but the vast majority who only have one degree have the JD, and those that have both typically only worked for two years not seven before going back to school, so are graduating at 30 with two degrees. I have gotten mixed advice so far as to whether my experience will help or hurt me. ( As a note if I didn‚Äôt say above, I would also be getting a full ride for the MPH)\n\nCan I prevail upon your expertise in the changing nature of the legal job market? My thought is that if I wait and reapply more law schools will be accepting the GRE which will help my numbers, but also presumably means there will be many more applicants who also have great GRE scores and passable LSAT scores. I am trying to weigh whether this means my chances are better or worse. Also, I know there has been a huge bump in law applications this year, and it seems more people accepting offers, meaning if I go to school now I will be entering the job market at the same time as that pool, and from a less competitive school. But if I wait, I‚Äôll be graduating two years later and those people will already be in the job market.\n\nGiven all this what do you think is the strategic decision?\n\nThank you,\n\nAlessandra\n\nHi Alessandra,\n\nTo be honest, I‚Äôm not sure what the best strategic decision is, mainly because there are so many moving parts here, and what you‚Äôve told me about your field isn‚Äôt definitive enough to make a judgment. So instead, I‚Äôll tell you what we *think* will happen in the legal field as well as with law school applications in general. hopefully, that will give you a better perspective on your choices!\n\nFirst, there has been an increase in applicants this year, but the problem has moreso been that the applicants in the 165 to 180 range increased significantly. So, you had more applicants but more applicants in particular with great LSAT scores. Lots of reasons for that, but the new no-limit‚ÄìLSAT policy helped a lot there. Next year we expect that bubble to get smaller, meaning we expect about the same number of applicants but not as many in that high score range.\n\nSecond, despite that increase this year, law schools are still not at the capacity they were 6-7 years ago, and so they have the ability to take more applicants. In other words, they can meet increased demand, and that mitigates the problem that larger applicant pools pose to applicants in general.\n\nThird, if the ABA stays on course, the GRE will begin to become more accepted. That means that right now it‚Äôs still really about LSAT scores, but in 2-3 years the GRE will be much closer to equal footing. If you went for that MPH now, if you tried law school later then you‚Äôd see a benefit from those high GREs.\n\nLast, the legal field in general is name conscious and always has been, and you‚Äôve already seen that in the employment stats you have cited. The bigger names *tend* to get better overall jobs, but keep in mind that it is always about individual performance. The top grads at Northeastern do just fine, and the bottom grads at UCLA will struggle. 1L grades are the world, and no matter where you go that will be the key to the job opportunities you have.\n\nIn the final analysis, I don‚Äôt think I can make a definitive call here. There are too many variables floating around, and I feel like you have so much more of the relevant info (including your exact debt tolerance, your true job desires, etc). That‚Äôs a sort of cop-out on my part, but I think I‚Äôd be remiss to state a strong opinion when I don‚Äôt have one that I feel certain about üôÇ\n\nHopefully this helped a little bit though. Thanks!\n\nHi Andrew,\n\nI was glad to see Nikki weigh in with some thoughts, because there is no substitute for hearing from someone at the school, especially someone who faced a similar decision.\n\nGoing back to my comment above in reply to Nikki, the point I made was that it wasn‚Äôt an easy choice, and I didn‚Äôt feel Cardozo was a slam dunk by any means. As I said, there literally was ‚Äúno best answer.‚Äù Your case is actually not much different. The thing with Nikki‚Äôs choice was she was looking at an extra $100K to attend Fordham, which, as it turns out, is very much the same situation you are in with Fordham and St. Johns. I‚Äôve stated elsewhere that I‚Äôm debt averse when it comes to these decisions, but you also have to know exactly what you are paying for, as well as whether that‚Äôs worth it to *you.* There are times when paying more is somewhat obviously the best decision and others where it is not. In your case, I get the feeling you are leaning toward Fordham since the biglaw employment numbers are better (an undeniable point, as seen here: https://www.lstreports.com/compare/stjohns/fordham/) and more or less want to know if it‚Äôs okay to take on that $127K. There‚Äôs a good chance it could be, and also a chance it‚Äôs not‚Äîthis is the unfortunate problem everyone faces when making these decisions. The one advantage you have over Nikki is that even though your margin costs are the same (the $100K), your overall cost is lower since you will come out with $127K total. That figure may be reasonable enough to you to make it worth the much better big firm/clerkship chances.\n\nI suppose that‚Äôs a long-winded way of saying that the lower overall debt does make a difference in my opinion, although again you have to be comfortable with what that looks like on a monthly basis. I always say plan for the worst as far as 1L grades, that way you know the worst possible outcome, but fortunately most people don‚Äôt end up in the worst-case scenario.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs a perfectly clear answer, but hopefully it helps a bit. Please let me know. Thanks!\n\nHi Dave,\n\nI‚Äôm in the boat of people who don‚Äôt know where they would like to practice law after school. For that reason I want to go to a school with a more national reach so I can be flexible. Unfortunately I‚Äôm not in a position where I‚Äôm deciding between T14 schools. The highest ranked school that I‚Äôve been admitted to is UCLA and I‚Äôm doing everything I can to make that option affordable for me. I think it‚Äôs a great fit for me because I am interested in immigration/public interest law and they have a great program for that. They are supposed to come out with their scholarship offers at the end of this month, but based upon what I‚Äôve read online my best guess is that if they gave me anything it would be between 40-60K total.\n\nMy options right now are between that and UCI at 67K, GW at 75K, and Minnesota at full ride. While I know Minnesota is ranked rather high and they‚Äôve given me full ride, I‚Äôm not so sure I want to be stuck there after graduation. I‚Äôm using my full ride offer and an offer of 120K from UC Davis to negotiate for more at UCI and hopefully then using that higher offer from UCI to negotiate with UCLA. GW has stated explicitly that their offer is meant to be final but that there is an application I can fill out for them to reconsider the offer. However, they would only be able to tell me if they are able to increase my scholarship offer after the deadline to reserve my seat. I‚Äôm not sure if there is any way of getting around that to negotiate a higher offer, but I‚Äôm working with the assumption that that will be my final offer.\n\nGiven that, I was wondering your thoughts on, if it came down to it, ~100K in debt from GW vs. ~100K in debt from UCLA. I would be happy in either a CA or DC market, and from what I understand UCLA has some good connections to the DC market too. I am also wondering if that amount of debt is worth it for those schools or if I should take the money from UCI, Davis or Minnesota and run.\n\nThanks.\n\nHi Brian/Dave/everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm in the luckiest position I can imagine and have gotten in to a lot of great schools. I have it (roughly) narrowed down to Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and NYU, with the possibility of full-tuition public interest scholarships at both Columbia and NYU, and I am expecting zero need-based aid from Harvard and Yale. I am fully 100% committed to public interest, but I‚Äôm not sure exactly what I want that to look like ‚Äî I could easily see myself in a legal services/public defender career, or something more policy-oriented eventually, and I don‚Äôt know enough about clerking to know if I want to clerk. There‚Äôs also a chance I might want to move abroad at some point. I don‚Äôt think I want to do academia (unless we‚Äôre talking about clinical professorships, which seem to be a different beast) but again, don‚Äôt really know. So‚Ä¶basically I want to keep my options open, with the knowledge that I definitely want to do public interest and would be fully relying on the LRAP programs at Harvard and Yale (and ostensibly at NYU/Columbia for cost of living loans).\n\nMy instinct is that Yale > Harvard if I‚Äôm paying sticker. The only doubt I have about that is around Harvard‚Äôs larger network/greater name recognition if I‚Äôm living overseas and need connections. Do you think this is a legitimate doubt? That aside, would you agree that Yale > Harvard in terms of creating opportunities for most public interest-oriented people? Any other comments on that?\n\nThat aside, paying sticker to Yale might be stupid if I get a public interest scholarship at NYU or Columbia. The NYU scholarship is named (it‚Äôs the RTK) while the Columbia one isn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt really have a sense of how much better these opportunities would be compared to Yale at sticker with my goals. I have a feeling that Columbia has better overseas recognition than NYU, but the Root program has additional benefits that can‚Äôt really be measured because of the level of support and the network it provides.\n\nBut I‚Äôm conflicted, because I also am really drawn to Yale‚Äôs lack of grades and general chiller/theoretical atmosphere! Also it‚Äôs Yale (who turns down Yale?)! I guess I‚Äôm asking how stupid it would be to choose Yale over the Root, since my goals are not super specific at the moment and I don‚Äôt really have a reason that Yale would uniquely help me get to wherever I‚Äôm going (except maybe int‚Äôl prestige). Their LRAP is obviously great but it‚Äôs also a LOT of debt, and who knows what life could throw at me.\n\nAny commentary you might have on any element of this situation/general panic would be amazing. The people I love are great, but they don‚Äôt really get law school stuff, and I don‚Äôt have too many people to talk to about this decision.\n\nThank you so much.\n\n-Ella"
