        "text": "Callaway Chair of Law Emeritus Ronald L. Carlson has been a member of the University of Georgia School of Law faculty since 1984. A prolific scholar, Carlson began writing about and analyzing evidentiary rules during the early stages of the Federal Rules of Evidence. In December 2000, when Federal Rule of Evidence 703 was amended, the Federal Rules Advisory Committee relied upon Carlson's Vanderbilt article on expert witnesses in the official Federal Advisory Committee Notes.\n\nHis articles on litigation and evidence practice have appeared in the Cornell, Duke, Northwestern, Vanderbilt, Georgia and Minnesota law reviews, just to name a few. Additionally, he is the author of 22 books on evidence, trial practice and criminal procedure, and his law school course book on the law of evidence, published with Carolina Academic Press Publishing Company, went into its eighth edition in the fall of 2018. Highly popular with the members of the bar is the book Carlson on Evidence, co-written with his son, Fulton County Executive District Attorney Michael Carlson. Decisions from 2013 (the date of Georgia's new evidence code) to 2024 by both the Georgia Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals relied upon his writings to reach conclusions in important civil and criminal cases. Approximately 75 Georgia appellate decisions have relied upon Carlson on Evidence to reach a result in a disputed appeal.\n\nCarlson draws upon his writings and background as a trial lawyer and U.S. Commissioner when lecturing to lawyers and judges about litigation and evidence. He has spoken at CLE seminars across the country. Along with the late U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Myron Bright, they presented the program \"Objections at Trial II in over 70 cities, from Boston to San Francisco. He also leads seminars for judges and lawyers in Georgia. In 2015, he and his copresenter received the Education Leadership Award from the Institute of Continuing Judicial Education, presented at the Superior Court Judicial Conference where Carlson was speaking.\n\nCarlson also informs the public about the law and legal issues through his commentary in the media on high-profile cases. He has been the source of legal analysis for The New York Times, Newsweek, USA Today and NBC News.\n\nIn July 2000, he was awarded the ALI-ABA's Harrison Tweed Award for Special Merit in Continuing Legal Education, the top recognition for significant contributions to CLE at the national or state level. He has also been awarded the Josiah Meigs Award for Teaching Excellence from UGA, the first School of Law professor to receive this accolade; the 1987 Roscoe Pound Foundation's Richard S. Jacobson Award, honoring a single national law professor for the teaching of trial advocacy; and the Earl W. Kintner Award, the Federal Bar Association's highest honor for distinguished service to the federal bar. The Georgia Trial Lawyers Association recognized him with their GTLA Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nAlthough he took emeritus status in 2001, Carlson continues to work closely with the law school's award-winning advocacy programs.\n\nCarlson's educational travels have taken him, either as a full-time, summer or visiting professor to the law schools of the University of Texas, Ohio State University, the University of Tennessee, Wayne State University, Washington University, Saint Louis University and the College of Law of the University of Iowa.\n\nHe has received every faculty honor presented by the law school student body: the Student Bar Association Faculty Book Award for Excellence in Teaching, which is now the C. Ronald Ellington Award for Excellence in Teaching, the John C. O'Byrne Memorial Award for Furthering Student-Faculty Relations and the Student Bar Association Professional Responsibility Award. The Professional Responsibility Award recognizes the professor who best succeeds in inspiring professional responsibility \"through his instruction and through his example.\" On four occasions he has been selected by senior classes to serve as class marshal at School of Law graduations.\n\nCarlson is a charter member of the UGA Teaching Academy, and he is one of the founding members of the present-day Clarke-Carley Inn of Court, an organization dedicated to teaching and mentoring law students and young attorneys. In 2005, he delivered the university's Founders Day Lecture.\n\nCarlson has litigated numerous trial and appellate cases and has argued appeals before the U.S. Supreme Court. He appeared as one of the trial counsel in Eckerhart v. Hensley, a landmark federal case establishing the right of mental patients to adequate and humane treatment and was one of the authors of the Federal Bar Association's amicus curiae brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in Upjohn Co. v. United States, a major case involving the corporate attorney-client privilege.\n\nCarlson earned his bachelor's degree from Augustana College, his law degree from Northwestern University and his Master of Laws from Georgetown University. At Northwestern, Carlson was a member of the Board of Editors of the Northwestern University Law Review and president of his senior class. At Georgetown, he was an E. Barrett Prettyman Fellow in Trial Advocacy. He worked as a lawyer and U.S. Commissioner prior to joining the University of Iowa law faculty. He taught at Iowa for eight years, then joined the law faculty at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, where he remained until accepting the offer to join UGA.\n\nARTICLES\n\nBOOK REVIEWS\n\nBOOKS\n\nCHAPTERS\n\nOTHER\n\nARTICLES\n\nDavis Violations Dissected:'New' Georgia Law and the Crisis in Evidence, 9 J.
