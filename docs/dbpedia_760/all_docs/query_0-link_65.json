He served as an adjunct instructor in banking law regulation and enforcement at Boston University. Among the wide array of actions led by Howard over the course of his career, the matter of which he is most proud is the successful representation of fellow alumnus Andrew McCabe, JD ’93, former Acting and Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in an action involving wrongful termination and other claims, the settlement of which, in the words of Mr. McCabe, “encourages the men and women of the FBI to continue to protect the American people…without fear of political retaliation.”\n\nHoward earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of Rochester in 1976. He was elected as a member of the Washington University Board of Trustees in 2010, serves as the chair of the law school’s Board of Advisors since 2014 and with his wife Caroline, served on Washington University’s Parent Council.\n\nHoward and Caroline established and endowed the Howard and Caroline Cayne Distinguished Professorship in the School of Law.

She graduated with the first cohort in 2015.\n\nAfter 20 years working with the G.W. Goldnadel Law office as a senior attorney, Valérie created her own law firm in Paris in 2019.

The care of the pupils is comprehensive: education, food, and medical follow-up (general medicine, vaccinations, dental and ophthalmological care). Support is also provided to families. The level of education of girls is a sign of a country’s degree of freedom and democracy.\n\nValérie helped to create the Chamber orchestra of the Paris Bar in 1999 where she was a founding member until 2022.
