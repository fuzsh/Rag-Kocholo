        "text": "First-Year Admission\n\nThe undergraduate admissions committee reviews each application in a holistic and individualized manner, with a goal of getting to know each student through the application process. Some of the things assessed during this process include the following:\n\nAcademic potential and preparation\n\nPersonal characteristics and qualities\n\nAccomplishments and involvement\n\nAdmission to Washington University is both selective and competitive. The university receives applications from far more students than it is able to admit each year. Students who come to Washington University have challenged themselves academically and personally during their high school years and are required to have earned a high school diploma or its equivalent, including home-schooled students and students holding a GED. Most applicants take advantage of honors, Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate, and/or Dual Enrollment courses, if offered by their high schools. The admissions review takes each applicant's individual context, circumstances, and opportunities into account.\n\nMost candidates' transcripts include the following:\n\nFour years of English\n\nFour years of mathematics; calculus is strongly recommended for majors in Architecture, Business, and Engineering; science majors in Arts & Sciences; and those who intend to pursue a pre-medicine path\n\nThree to four years of history or social science\n\nAt least two years of the same foreign language since ninth grade\n\nThree to four years of laboratory science; chemistry and physics are strongly recommended for Engineering majors and for those who plan to do course work in the sciences and/or pre-medicine\n\nImportant components of a student's application also include the following:\n\nThe student's academic performance (transcript), including course selection, grades, and class rank, if provided by the secondary school\n\nCounselor and teacher recommendations\n\nEssays\n\nExtracurricular and community involvement, including positive impacts on home and community (students who work for pay and/or have time-consuming family responsibilities should include this in their activity list)\n\nStandardized testing, if provided (see below)\n\nStandardized Testing\n\nWashU has a test-optional policy for applicants for admission in the fall semester of 2025. Applicants have the option of whether to submit standardized test scores. Students who are unable to or who elect not to submit their test scores will have the requirement automatically waived and will not be penalized. For those who do submit test scores, either SAT or ACT scores are acceptable, and neither the writing section nor SAT Subject Tests are required. Test results from any of the student's high school years are acceptable and we consider only the highest individual scores, whenever they occurred. Students may also submit additional testing (such as SAT Subject Tests, AP or IB exam scores, or other forms of testing) in addition to, or in lieu of, the SAT or ACT.\n\nApplying for Admission\n\nFor a student's application file to be complete, we must receive the following materials by the deadline for the decision plan selected:\n\nCommon Application or Coalition Application\n\nNonrefundable $75 fee or a simple fee-waiver request\n\nAll required additional materials as outlined in the Office of Undergraduate Admissions guidelines, including a teacher recommendation, a school report, and official transcripts\n\nWashington University also accepts applications through the QuestBridge Match process.\n\nDecision Plans\n\nWashington University offers two binding Early Decision options (Early Decision I, with a deadline of November 1 and notification by December 15, and Early Decision II, with a deadline of January 2 and notification by February 14) and Regular Decision, with a deadline of January 2 and notification by April 1 each year.\n\nIf Washington University is a student's first choice, we encourage the student to consider applying under an Early Decision plan. Applying Early Decision signifies a binding commitment that the student will attend Washington University if admitted. This option requires the applicant to submit a nonrefundable enrollment deposit within two weeks of receiving notification of admission. If admitted, the student must withdraw applications at other schools. A student may apply to only one school through a binding Early Decision plan.\n\nSelecting a Division\n\nWe encourage students to think about where their interests may lie at the time they apply in terms of a major and a degree path to pursue. Applicants must select one of the academic divisions (Architecture, Art, Arts & Sciences, Business, or Engineering) or the Beyond Boundaries program as the primary point of interest. This allows us to assess proper preparation in the application review process and to provide effective academic advising from the start to help students realize their goals. Once admitted to a division, a student must spend at least one full semester in that division before requesting a change to another undergraduate division at Washington University. Students wishing to switch undergraduate divisions after the first semester do so by meeting with their dean's office. (Note: Olin Business School considers transfer requests after the first year.)\n\nIf English Is Not the Student's Primary Language\n\nInternational applicants for whom English is a second language are required to demonstrate evidence of English language proficiency by submitting results from the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language), IELTS (International English Language Testing System), or Duolingo English Test. Applicants may also seek a waiver, based upon specific circumstances. Students should refer to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions for additional guidance.\n\nPortfolios\n\nIn addition to the application materials referenced above, applicants to the College of Art are required to submit a portfolio of their work and applicants to the College of Architecture are encouraged to do so. All College of Art students will be considered for the Conway or Proetz Scholarship in art; Architecture students who submit portfolios will be considered for the Fitzgibbon Scholarship.\n\nApplicants should submit their portfolios through SlideRoom and should include 12 to 15 pieces of recent work, which may include drawings, two- and three-dimensional pieces, and photographs. (If an applicant is submitting an architecture portfolio, they should not include CAD drawings or examples of their drafting skills.) The applicant may include additional information about each piece, such as the title, medium, dimensions and date completed.\n\nDeferred Enrollment\n\nAdmitted students who have submitted their enrollment materials but wish to begin their studies at a later date may request to defer enrollment at Washington University for a period of one year, with extension possible for an additional year depending on individual circumstances. Requests to defer enrollment (“take a gap year”) are reviewed individually on a case-by-case basis and must be received by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by May 15.\n\nDeferred enrollment is designed for students who wish to engage in a substantive personal growth experience before enrolling or students completing compulsory national service and/or a religious commitment. Students who have deferred enrollment should not enroll as a full-time student at another institution. If a student pursues any course work during deferred enrollment, any courses taken during the deferred period are typically not accepted for credit. Final decisions about the transferability of any credit lies with the dean's office in each division.\n\nStudents interested in deferring enrollment should contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions for important deadlines and procedures. Note: students deferring enrollment must reapply for financial assistance during the application cycle immediately preceding the date of desired entry.\n\nPlease visit the Admissions website for more information.\n\nStatement of Admissions Conduct\n\nWashington University in St. Louis is committed to the highest ethical and professional standards of conduct as an integral part of its mission, the promotion of learning. To achieve this goal, the university relies on each community member’s ethical behavior, honesty, integrity and good judgment. Each community member should demonstrate respect for the rights of others. Each community member is accountable for his/her actions. Therefore, an offer of admission and a student’s enrollment at the university are contingent upon the accurate and complete representation of information within the application for admission, as well as successful completion of their current studies. Applicants are obligated to notify the university of any changes in the information provided or responses submitted as part of their application. Washington University in St. Louis reserves the right to rescind an offer of admission or revoke a student’s enrollment at any time if we receive information that, in our sole judgment and discretion, indicates that the information provided in the application is inaccurate or misleading or if new information leads the university to determine that a student is no longer a positive presence for study or participation in our community.\n\nTransfer Admission\n\nTransfer admission to Washington University is selective; the university receives more applications each year than it has space to admit. Architecture, Art, Business, and Engineering only accept applications for transfer admission for entry in the fall semester; Arts & Sciences accepts applications for both the fall and spring semesters.\n\nAn applicant should apply as a transfer student if they meet all of the following requirements:\n\nThe applicant has finished secondary school and completed some college study.\n\nThe applicant would like to be considered for admission with advanced standing (as a second-year or third-year student) at Washington University.\n\nThe applicant is interested in enrolling full-time in an undergraduate degree program with a specific academic focus.\n\nThe applicant has never attended any of Washington University's full-time, degree-granting schools.\n\nFor information about transfer application deadlines, please visit the Admissions website.\n\nPreparation for Transfer\n\nTransfer applicants are reviewed for their preparation to successfully enroll in their division of interest. Available space in each division varies every year. Generally speaking, strong applicants will have achieved at least a B+ average from a two- or four-year college in courses across a broad academic curriculum.\n\nSome academic divisions require specific academic achievement and the completion of specific course work. For example, students with interests in business must demonstrate strong performance in math course work, including calculus, and students interested in engineering or the physical or biological sciences must demonstrate strong performance in science and mathematics course work, including calculus. Applicants are advised to review the suggested guidelines and specific course work needed for their intended area of study or intended professional pathway (e.g., pre-med); this is available on the Admissions website.\n\nAdditionally, transfer applicants must have left their current institution and all previous institutions in good standing and be eligible to return. If an applicant has been away from a formal academic setting for more than two years, we require the applicant to complete at least one year (30 units) of work at another college or university before applying for transfer admission.\n\nDue to the very limited number of transfer spaces available, transfer applicants are ineligible to request deferred enrollment from one year to the next.\n\nFor additional admissions information on how to apply as a transfer applicant, please visit the Admissions website.\n\nTo apply as a transfer applicant, applicants must submit their high school transcript(s), their application, official transcripts of all previous college work, a Transfer Academic Evaluation (letter of recommendation), a Transfer Registrar Report (College Report), and the nonrefundable $75 application fee (or fee waiver) to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Transfer applicants have the option of whether to submit standardized testing, such as the SAT or ACT.\n\nDetailed information about applying for financial aid is available on the Student Financial Services website and in this Bulletin.\n\nTransfer admission information for individual schools is listed as follows.\n\nTransferring into Arts & Sciences\n\nEach year, a number of students from other colleges and universities transfer into the College of Arts & Sciences. Upon their admission, the transfer student advisor reviews and evaluates their previous academic work. Full credit is normally granted for courses taken at accredited institutions, provided that the university offers comparable courses and that the student has completed the courses with a grade of C or better. Please note: With the exception of course work taken during the 2020-21 academic year, online course work will not be considered for transfer credit. In addition, transfer credit may be counted where applicable and upon department approval toward major or minor requirements. Transfer students must be enrolled for at least four consecutive full-time semesters, excluding summer terms, to satisfy the residency requirement. They must complete a minimum number of units at Washington University and a minimum number of units in the College of Arts & Sciences in accordance with the table found under the heading \"Transfer Students\" on the Arts & Sciences Degree Requirements page of this Bulletin.\n\nAll transfer students are assigned an academic advisor. When they declare a major, they also meet with an advisor in the major department. The full range of curricular opportunities offered through the college is open to transfer students when prerequisites are satisfied. An applicant should direct specific questions about transfer credit and course sequences at Washington University to the College of Arts & Sciences.\n\nTransferring into Architecture\n\nPlaces for transfer students are extremely limited and require strong performance in an arts and sciences curriculum, preferably with preparation in the visual arts. Placement into the design studio sequence is determined by a portfolio review and an evaluation of prior course work. To assist with appropriate placement, an interview with the associate dean of students, while not required, is strongly recommended. The applicant should bring a transcript to the meeting. The applicant's previous work should parallel as closely as possible the course work outlined on the Architecture Degree Requirements page.\n\nTransfer applicants to the College of Architecture are required to submit a portfolio consisting of 12 to 15 pieces of recent work for review by the faculty through SlideRoom on the Common Application. This should include examples of work that indicate the applicant’s technical and conceptual level of accomplishment. Some drawing should be from direct observation. If possible, applicants should submit examples of work in different media to demonstrate a range of art and design experiences.\n\nTransferring into Art\n\nThe number of studio art credits that a transfer applicant has already earned, in combination with an evaluation of the applicant's portfolio, determines the level at which the student is admitted. As much as possible, the studio art courses taken at other institutions should correspond with the program at Washington University as outlined on the Art Degree Requirements page. To assist with appropriate placement, an interview with the associate dean of students, while not required, is strongly recommended. The applicant should bring a transcript to the meeting.\n\nTransfer applicants to the College of Art are required to submit a portfolio through SlideRoom on the Common Application for faculty review. The portfolio should consist of 12 to 15 pieces of recent work and show a variety of art experiences, including drawings, work utilizing design principles, and some work in color. Applicants should include examples of work from basic drawing and design classes that indicate their technical and conceptual level of accomplishment, and some drawing should be from direct observation. If possible, applicants should submit examples of work in different media to demonstrate a range of art and design experiences. If applying to the second- or third-year level, some of the work should be in the area of the applicant's intended major.\n\nTransferring into Business\n\nThe Olin Business School offers transfer enrollment during the fall semester. The strongest candidates for admission are able to demonstrate solid academic performance at a two- or four-year college that mirrors most of the academic requirements that our students complete during their first or second year of study. For a sophomore-level transfer candidate, this would include Calculus II at the college level. Microeconomics is recommended. For a junior-level transfer candidate, this would include financial accounting, microeconomics, and perhaps macroeconomics and managerial accounting. All transfers to the Olin Business School must have completed an equivalent to Calculus II at the college level. Students who are admitted to the Olin Business School should expect a written course evaluation from the transfer student advisor within two weeks of receiving their offer of admission; this letter will indicate the courses that will be accepted by the business school. A maximum of 60 credits will be accepted toward our undergraduate degree. Students must earn at least a C grade in the course for the units to transfer to Washington University. Typically, courses taken online are not accepted as transfer credit. However, online courses taken during the COVID-19 pandemic (Spring 2020 through Summer 2022) will be transferable. Grades will not transfer to Washington University.\n\nAll transfer students are assigned an academic advisor. Transfer students must be enrolled for at least four consecutive full-time semesters to satisfy the residency requirement.\n\nPlease refer to the Degree Requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree.\n\nTransferring into Engineering\n\nApplicants may apply for admission if they have completed a minimum of one year of college work elsewhere; however, the McKelvey School of Engineering does not accept transfer students who have already completed a bachelor's degree. The transfer applicant must demonstrate academic achievement (i.e., a grade average of B+ or better), with strength in mathematics (calculus) and science (chemistry/physics). Transfer applicants to the McKelvey School of Engineering should have completed one semester of an English composition course, two semesters of calculus-based physics, and sufficient calculus (typically three semesters) to be prepared for differential equations. Applicants interested in biomedical engineering should also have completed at least one semester of chemistry with lab and an introductory biology sequence that includes cellular, molecular and developmental biology as well as genetics. Applicants interested in chemical or environmental engineering should have completed at least one biology course and sufficient chemistry to be ready to take organic chemistry. After completing the application process, an evaluation of the applicant's record will be made to determine the transfer of college credit. Grades earned do not transfer, but the applicant must earn a letter grade of C- or better for the course credit to transfer. Courses taken on a pass/fail basis do not transfer.\n\nTo be recommended for any bachelor's degree, a transfer applicant must satisfy applicable requirements of the McKelvey School of Engineering as shown in the Degree Requirements section of this Bulletin. Please note that all students earning an undergraduate engineering degree are required to complete a minimum of 60 course units at Washington University.\n\nPre-Matriculation Credit Units\n\nPre-matriculation credit units are earned before an applicant's enrollment at Washington University as a first-year student and can be applied toward a Washington University degree. A maximum of 15 units of pre-matriculation credit may be counted toward an undergraduate degree; these units of credit will count toward graduation but will not count toward the distribution requirements/meet general education requirements.* Sources for pre-matriculation credit units include Advanced Placement (AP) examinations, International Baccalaureate (IB) courses, British Advanced (A) Levels, course credit earned by proficiency (e.g., Back Credit), and college credit earned after the student's sophomore year in high school. Credits earned via Arts & Sciences Pre-College Programs are considered to be pre-matriculation credit units and are subject to the same regulations. A transcript notation is made of all pre-matriculation credit units earned before enrollment in Washington University.\n\nStudents who wish to receive pre-matriculation credit from their College Board AP examinations, International Baccalaureate courses, and British A-Level examinations should submit their official score reports to Washington University. All appropriate test scores will have course equivalents assigned to them and will be noted on the transcript. However, a maximum of 15 units of pre-matriculation credit will be awarded, provided credit has not been already designated as the result of college course work having been transferred as well. If a student takes a course in residence for which they have already received AP/IB/A-Level credit, the AP/IB/A-Level credit will be removed automatically.\n\nCollege Courses Prior to Washington University\n\nA maximum of 15 units of pre-matriculation credit may be awarded for college courses completed at another college or university prior to matriculation, provided no other pre-matriculation credits have been awarded. In the College of Arts & Sciences, Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Arts, Olin Business School, and McKelvey School of Engineering, college courses completed at another college or university prior to matriculation must meet the following standards:\n\nTaken after the sophomore year in high school\n\nTaken at a fully accredited college or university\n\nTaught on a college or university campus\n\nTaught by a college or university faculty member\n\nEnrolled in primarily by matriculated college students (i.e., high school graduates)\n\nNot listed on the high school transcript, did not count toward the high school diploma/graduation requirements, and was not part of a high school/college dual credit program\n\nStudents in the College of Arts & Sciences who would like to apply to receive pre-matriculation credit for college courses completed at another college or university prior to matriculation should visit the College of Arts & Sciences website.\n\nStudents in the Olin Business School who would like to apply to receive pre-matriculation credit for college courses completed at another college or university prior to matriculation should contact the Olin Business School.\n\nStudents in the Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Arts who would like to apply to receive pre-matriculation credit for college courses completed at another college or university prior to matriculation should visit the Sam Fox School website or contact the Sam Fox School registrar.\n\nStudents in the McKelvey School of Engineering who would like to apply to receive pre-matriculation credit for college courses completed at another college or university prior to matriculation should contact the McKelvey School of Engineering or email their questions about the transfer course equivalency review process to EUSS@wustl.edu.\n\nSecondary School Course Work\n\nWashington University does not recognize credit for courses taken in secondary schools (high schools) and taught by secondary (high school) instructors, even when offered under the aegis of a university. The university accepts credit for courses taken at a college or university and taught by faculty of a college or university, provided the course has not been credited toward the high school diploma.\n\nProficiency and Placement Examinations\n\nSuperior results on proficiency and placement examinations allow students to enter advanced courses at the beginning of their college career, to fulfill some requirements for a major or a minor by examination rather than by course work, and to earn credit toward their degree. Students will have all accepted pre-matriculation credit noted on their transcript so they may go directly into advanced courses.\n\nFour types of examinations are recognized:\n\nWashington University Placement Examinations. Placement examinations are administered by various departments and have different requirements for advanced course placement.\n\nInternational Baccalaureate. Students who have earned the International Baccalaureate diploma or who have successfully passed examinations in the program should consult a dean in their undergraduate division of the university about advanced course placement and credit. These scores may be used for placement or granting of degree credit, according to the recommendations of the various departments. Subsidiary-level scores are not recognized.\n\nAdvanced (A) Levels (A-Levels). These grades may be used for placement or granting of degree credit, according to the recommendations of the various departments.\n\nAdvanced Placement (AP) Examinations. These are used for placement, partial fulfillment of major or minor requirements, and the granting of degree credit, according to the recommendations of the various departments. Examinations are given by the College Board in May of each year for secondary school (high school) students who have been enrolled in college-level courses in the same subject or subjects of the exam. For the most current policy information, visit the College of Arts & Sciences Advanced Placement webpage. Students who wish to receive pre-matriculation credit for their AP test scores must have their AP test scores sent to Washington University by contacting the College Board at www.collegeboard.org or 1-888-225-5427 (College Code 6929).\n\nSAT Subject Tests: These examinations in modern languages are administered by the College Board. They are required for study in certain languages.\n\nCollege Level Examination Program (CLEP): These scores are not accepted for credit or placement.\n\nBack Credit Policy\n\nEast Asian Languages\n\nCredit is typically awarded for completing the following courses with a grade of B- or better.

Receipt of these credits has no bearing on the fulfillment of chemistry requirements for pre-medicine or any science major and cannot be used to satisfy prerequisites for Organic Chemistry. All students who receive a score of 6 or 7 should enroll in Chem 111A rather than Chem 105. All students who wish to pursue a major or a pre-professional preparatory curriculum requiring general chemistry must take Chem 111A and Chem 112A and the associated labs, Chem 151 and Chem 152. Please note that, in certain instances, students may substitute Chem 105/Chem 106 for Chem 111A/Chem 112A. Please consult the Department of Chemistry’s Director of Undergraduate Studies for details. Students who wish to pursue another major or a pre-professional preparatory curriculum requiring general chemistry must take either Chem 105 and Chem 106 or Chem 111A and Chem 112A (specific requirements are defined by the major program) and the associated labs, Chem 151 and Chem 152. Students who wish to exempt either the first or second semester of general chemistry, including the labs, must pass a placement exam administered by the Department of Chemistry during the first week of classes in the fall.\n\nGrade 7, 6: 6 units of credit: 3 units each of Chem 103 and Chem 104. These units do not replace Chem 111A or Chem 112A.
