        "text": "I am only in my foundational year, and as I came directly from a psychology BA program, much of the information is redundant. Some of the work seems overly hard to maintain the institutions reputation, more than it is meaningful and educational. Comparing my program to others, mine seems to prefer more work, and hides behind the guise of accreditation as an explanation, despite other programs not having the amount of workload.\n\nHow will obtaining an advanced degree after 44 years in the workforce help to achieve my lifetime goals? Most people at age 74 would rather choose to sit back and enjoy retirement. Not me! Upon graduation from Albany Law School in 1976, my thoughts and goals included an LLM in Taxation. My legal aid service resulted in my name being placed on the Southern Poverty Law Center Wall of Tolerance in 2004 in recognition of efforts on behalf of Native Americans.\n\nSo here it is 44 years later and I am doing what is the most enjoyable part of law for me, taxation. Syracuse University welcomed me as a veteran with open arms. In a year and a half, I completed a double major in History and Economics graduating in December 1972 Summa cum Laude.\n\nWashington University School of Law St. Louis, Missouri has an online program to achieve an LLM in Taxation in one year. The program is online which allows me to complete the coursework without having to move on campus.\n\nAs an international student, the overall experiences in Washington University in St. Louis Brown School so far is fairly exciting, it is the top social work program in the Us, it's very rigorous, but the diversity and inclusion they brand is not as much as I expect, you do see the diversity students here, but there are so many difficulties that international students facing that can not be addressed properly or in a timely manner.and some of the mandatory course setting doesn't make sense to me."
