        "text": "Morse became an assistant professor of law in 1929. At age 31, this made him the youngest dean of any law school accredited by the ABA. In 1944, Morse won the Oregon US Senator seat – and a 24-year tenure in the Senate, 1945-69.\n\nMorse left a deep legacy of commitment to democratic representation, the rule of law, and intellectual independence in his service to the University of Oregon, the State of Oregon, and the nation. He displayed this commitment in his work as a law professor and dean of the University of Oregon School of Law, a labor arbitrator, and while serving the State of Oregon as US senator.\n\nOregon Law established the Wayne Morse Chair of Law and Politics in 1981 and the Wayne Morse Center for Law and Politics in 2000.\n\nYasui, a “double-duck”, earned a BA from the UO in 1937. In 1942, the Hood River native and former member of phi Beta Kappa and ROTC purposely violates the military curfew on Japanese-Americans.\n\nHis case, Yasui v. United States, was the first case to test the constitutionality of the curfews targeted at minority groups, made it all the way to the United States Supreme Court. Yasui later became a renowned civil rights attorney in Denver. In 2015, Yasui was post-humously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.\n\nTo honor his legacy, the School of Law established The Yasui Endowment, which honors the legacy of a School of Law graduate of uncommon courage and principle. In 2016, the Minoru Yasui Fellowship was established, and in 2017, the Oregon Law Minoru Yasui Justice Award was created to honor Yasui’s legacy of civil rights.\n\nFrohnmayer taught law at the University of Oregon from 1971 to 1981. He then went on to serve as Oregon’s 12th Attorney General, from 1981-1991. In 1994, he was appointed as president of the University of Oregon and Charles O’Kelley served as acting-dean (1994-1997). Frohnmayer retired in 2008.\n\nIn 2002, the Frohnmayer Award for Public Service was established in honor of the family and work of Frohnmayer. The award recognizes a graduate, faculty member, or friend of Oregon Law whose public service brings honor to the school.\n\nIn 2016, Oregon Law established the largest endowment for a named faculty position, the Dave Frohnmayer Chair in Leadership and Law. With this new faculty position, Oregon Law became one of the few law schools in the nation to offer a specialization\n\nDean Strickland served through 2002. A legal historian of Osage and Cherokee heritage, Professor Strickland was considered a pioneer in introducing Indian law into university curriculum. The Annual Rennard Strickland Lecture Series was established in 2006 to honor the legacy of Distinguished Professor Emeritus Rennard Strickland by examining native leadership and vision for environmental stewardship in the 21st century.\n\nAt the occasion of his passing in January 2021, Oregon Law posted a memorial of his oustanding legacy.\n\nA former trial lawyer and federal prosecutor, alum Laird Kirkpatrick JD ’68, taught evidence and evidence related courses at Oregon Law for more than 30 years. During his time as a student at Oregon Law he was Editor-in-Chief of the Law Review. He graduated as a member of the Order of the Coif. He was honored in 2019 with The John E. Jaqua Distinguished Alumnus Award for his personal and professional achievements and loyalty to Oregon Law."
