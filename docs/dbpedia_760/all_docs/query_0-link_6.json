        "text": "Washington University School of Law provides a top-flight legal education amid a beautiful campus that brings the magic of Oxbridge to the Midwest. Warm students, a city that combines urban opportunities with a low cost of living, and an administration committed to raising the school's profile make WashULaw an attractive choice for many a prospective law student.\n\nHistory\n\nWashington University School of Law’s proud 150-year history dates to 1867, when a group of St. Louis visionaries officially founded the school. Since that auspicious year, this progressive school has flourished—becoming rich in tradition, innovation, and achievement.\n\nPursuing excellence in legal education since 1867 WashULaw’s technological advancements, international relations, and diversified coursework have grown over 150 years. Still, its mission remains the same: to equip students with knowledge and skills to ethically and effectively practice law and pursue justice in a dynamic and globally interconnected legal environment.\n\nAdmissions\n\nStatistics\n\nThe 1L class at Washington University in St. Louis has an LSAT score in the top percentile. The median score is 170, with a 25th percentile score of 163 and a 75th percentile score of 171. This means that the average student's GPA is also high, with a median GPA of 3.93. The 25th percentile GPA is 3.56, and the 75th percentile GPA is 3.99. This indicates that most students who attend Washington University School of Law have excellent academic backgrounds.\n\nAdmissions Stats Class of: 2020-2021 2021-2022 25th - 50th - 75th percentile LSAT 162 - 169 - 170 163 - 170 - 171 25th - 50th - 75th percentile GPA 3.41 - 3.88 - 3.95 3.56 - 3.93 - 3.99 Acceptance rate 20.3% 15.9% Applications received 4545 5958 Acceptances 923 946 Matriculants 1368 1306\n\nAdmissions Process\n\nWashington University School of Law takes a holistic approach to [1] decisions, considering many qualities candidates offer as community members, in addition to the traditional credentials, such as LSAT and GPA. In conjunction with the Center for Empirical Research in the Law, analysis of historical information allows WashULaw to take a data-driven approach to support admission decisions based on factors not traditionally considered or given much weight by the legal education system. Due to this innovative approach, some applicants may be asked to provide additional information or documentation to support their admission based on an expanded set of criteria we will consider in the admission process. The interview process is a critical part of the holistic approach to the admissions process.\n\nCandidates can apply through the Law School Admissions Council (LSAC) or may begin with WashULaw's web-based application. There is a nonrefundable $70 fee for applications submitted through LSAC.org, but the school is generous with fee waivers, so be sure to contact Admissions first.\n\nPersonal Statements and Addenda\n\nWashULaw requires a personal statement of two to three pages. This open-ended essay allows applicants to let the WashULaw Admissions Committee get to know them as individuals. According to the school's website, \"Successful applicants have written about significant experiences and sources of personal motivation.\"\n\nAdditionally, applicants may submit other essays for consideration. Examples of additional essays include diversity statements outlining a history of poor standardized testing results and explanations of periods of poor academic performance due to external factors.\n\nApplicants must answer several Character and Fitness questions regarding criminal charges and academic disciplinary action; any such records must be explained in the addenda to the application. For personal statements and application essays, check out the TLS Guide to Personal Statements.\n\nResume\n\nApplicants are required to submit a current resume showing all academic, professional, and volunteer experience.\n\nLetters of Recommendation\n\nLetters of recommendation are not required for admission, but they are strongly encouraged. These letters typically come from professors, although employers often provide strong recommendations, especially for applicants returning to law school after a gap in their education. For additional advice on obtaining letters of recommendation, click here.\n\nInterviews\n\nAll candidates for admission are required to complete an interview with the admissions staff. Interviews are conducted only by invitation from the Admissions Committee, which bases the invitation to interview on the strength of the application.\n\nBinding Early Decision Program\n\nWashULaw's Binding Early Decision program is designed for candidates who have researched law schools carefully and are certain that Washington University School of Law is their first choice of school. All applicants admitted through the Binding Early Decision Program will be awarded a full tuition scholarship for 3 years. If admitted, applicants must withdraw all applications at other law schools and may not initiate any new applications after being notified of admission. You must apply by December 1st, and you will receive a decision within 2 weeks of receipt of your application materials. For example, you may take the December LSAT and receive a decision within 2 weeks of receipt of your LSAT score. Early Decision applicants are either admitted with full scholarship or transferred to Regular Decision for further review. To read a TLS article about deciding between ED and RD (or Regular Decision), click here.\n\nTuition and Expenses\n\nCost of Attendance\n\nCost of Attendance, 2021-2022 Tuition $64,488 Room $8,910 Board $5,958 Books $1,500 Misc $5,000 University Health & Wellness Fee (mandatory) $576 Student Bar Association Fee $70 Legal LAUNCH Week Fee $70 University Health Insurance $2,232 Total Costs $88,804\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nNeed-based financial aid is available in the form of student loans.\n\nScholarship\n\nAll students admitted into Washington University School of Law are automatically considered for merit-based scholarships, and most students receive some merit scholarship. A merit scholarship is granted based on a student's past academic record and performance on the LSAT, in addition to other factors.\n\nTo encourage diversity among the student body, additional scholarships are available for African-American and Native-American students and a handful of candidates with a demonstrated commitment to public service. Applicants are automatically considered for all scholarships, except those who want consideration for the public interest Webster Society Scholarship must submit an additional essay.[viii]\n\nPublic Interest Support\n\nThe Loan Repayment Assistance Program (LRAP) at Washington University School of Law is designed to help graduates with significant student loan debt manage their monthly payments. The program offers interest-free loans and grants to eligible graduates, which can be used to repay student loans or cover living expenses. LRAP is available to both full-time and part-time graduates who are employed in public interest jobs. To be eligible for LRAP, graduates must have a law degree from Washington University School of Law and be employed in a public interest job that pays less than $50,000 per year.\n\nThe Office of Student Financial Services administers LRAP. Don't hesitate to contact the Office of Student Financial Services at (314) 935-5900 or lrapinfo@wustl.edu.\n\nTransfer Admissions\n\nStudents who have completed their first years at other ABA-accredited law schools can apply to finish their degrees at WashULaw as transfer students. Required application materials include an official law school transcript, resume, and a letter of good standing from the originating law school's dean of students. The personal statement must address a candidate's reasons for transferring. Transfer students are fully integrated into the student body as soon as they make a tuition deposit, with full access to Career Services Office resources (including on-campus interviews) and the journal write-on competition. To read a fantastic article about transferring, click here.\n\nLaw School Culture\n\nAt least among TLS members, Wash U students have few complaints about their fellow students or the school's overall feel. One writes:\n\nIt's a pretty laid-back, non-competitive atmosphere, and everyone talks to everyone. I was surprised at how nice everyone was...The horror stories about how douchey law students are were vastly exaggerated...at least at WUSTL.[ix]\n\nAnother notes that friendships develop quickly and that the school encourages a friendly ethos through social events:\n\nThe atmosphere is very collegial. I was stunned when I got here and met all my classmates because everyone was friendly and open. I didn't expect it, but everyone has a unique story, and each person is interesting. Everyone has been down to earth as well. The school offers a \"happy hour\" every Friday, sponsored by different student groups, where everyone gathers in the common area and socializes from 4:30-6:30. Also, there is a bar review every Thursday night at a different bar each week that is very well attended.[x]\n\nDiversity\n\nWashington University considers diversity for admissions and scholarship offers. The Washington University Law community is home to some student groups, initiatives organizations, and resources focused on creating communities of diversity and acceptance. According to one TLS poster, this diversity extends beyond racial and ethnic lines:\n\nWUSTL has people from every walk of life. I don't think any culture or type is more predominant than another. Anyone can fit in. Some people wear really expensive clothes to class; others wear hoodies and jeans. Honestly, I probably wouldn't look twice if someone tried to wear pajama pants to class.[xii]\n\nAcademics\n\nWashington University School of Law provides a comprehensive education in legal theory and practical skills. In addition to the traditional JD program, the school offers joint degree programs with other graduate schools and advanced post-JD programs. This variety of courses ensures students are trained to excel in legal reasoning and practice techniques.\n\nCurriculum\n\nThe first year of Washington University Law is highly structured: 1Ls take three substantive classes each semester that give a broad survey of American common law: Contracts, Property, and Torts in the fall, followed by Civil Procedure, Criminal Law, and Constitutional Law in the spring. First-years are also required to take Legal Research and Writing classes; WUSTL splits these into two courses (Legal Practice and Legal Research Methodologies), both of which span the entire 1L year. A TLS member describes the organization of first-year sections, which become the first and closest social circles for many law students:\n\nDuring your 1L year, you'll be split into 6 sections of approximately 45 students each (A, B, C, D, E, F). You are then paired with another section to form a \"super-section\" of about 90-100 students. Your \"super-section\" has the same 3 core professors, but you don't always have a class with them.[xiii]\n\nAfter taking 30 structured credits as first-years, students choose their classes for 2L and 3L years. Upper-level students fulfill 56 credit hours by tailoring their studies to fit their interests. Students may take various courses to meet the upper-class writing, ethics, and applied lawyering / professional skills course requirements. Faculty members and administrators guide course selection. In total, 86 credit hours are required to complete the JD.\n\nGrading System\n\nThe University School of Law is among the most prestigious law schools in the country. Located in Washington, D.C., the school offers a world-class education to its students. The school provides an excellent learning environment for its students with a faculty that includes some of the nation's top legal scholars.\n\nThe school's grading system is based on a 4.0 scale. A student's grade point average (GPA) is calculated by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of credit hours attempted. The school's GPA requirements are as follows:\n\n1.0-1.9 = D 2.0-2.9 = C 3.0-3.9 = B 4.0 = A\n\nThe school offers various courses, including constitutional law, criminal law, and civil procedure. In addition to its academic offerings, the school also provides opportunities for students to participate in extracurricular activities, such as moot court and student government. The school's clinics and externships provide students with real-world experience in the legal field.\n\nThe American Bar Association accredits the University School of Law. The school is also a member of the Association of American Law Schools.\n\nProfessors\n\nWashington University Law's greatest strength is its faculty. They are nationally and internationally recognized experts in fields ranging from international law and constitutional law to corporate and other private law fields. They come from a broad array of practice and disciplinary backgrounds and utilize diverse methodologies, such as empirical studies, law and economics, and critical race theory. Many law faculty have graduate degrees in other fields and have joint appointments with other schools and departments at Washington University, including political science, business, economics, history, architecture, philosophy, and environmental engineering. Complementing their extensive research and scholarship, law professors head the law school's three centers and one institute, devoted to empirical research, innovation and economic growth, work and social capital, and international law.\n\nAccording to Leiter, frequently cited law professors at Wash U include Pauline Kim (Labor and Employment) and Francis Foster (Wills, Trusts, and Estates), and Brian Tamanaha (Jurisprudence). Tamanaha is also popular among students, having \"developed a huge group of fans\" despite being new to the university. TLS posters describe the average professor as approachable and friendly, and say that few professors still employ an entirely Socratic teaching demeanor.\n\nClinics and Externships\n\nWashULaw students are guaranteed placement in the school's top-ranked clinical program. Students can work directly with practicing lawyers, judges, and legislators in 18 clinical and externship programs worldwide, from St. Louis to Washington, D.C. and New York City to Africa and South America. The clinics are in various specialty areas, including a Prosecution Law Clinic and a Low Income Tax Clinic.\n\nOther clinics include the Appellate Clinic, which allows students to argue cases before the Eighth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals, and the Civil Justice Clinic, which deals largely with family issues in the St. Louis area. External placements include the Congressional and Administrative Clinic, which sends dozens of 2Ls and 3Ls each year to the nation's capital to work for a member of Congress, government agency, or non-governmental advocacy or research organization. One way to individualize the clinical experience is through the Semester-in-Practice externship, where students can explore their niche. The school helps students find a full-time placement in a nonprofit, government, or in-house corporate law office in their preferred area of practice and in the geographic location of their choice.\n\nInterdisciplinary Focus and Joint Degrees\n\nWashULaw's location on the main campus of one of the nation's top universities gives students easy access to a wealth of resources. The university offers several joint degree programs, including a JD/MBA in concert with Olin Business School and a JD/MSW with the premier Brown School of Social Work. Law students may count up to 9 credit hours toward the JD outside the formal joint degree programs.\n\nIn addition to its joint degree programs, WashULaw offers an Interdisciplinary Environmental Law Clinic in which environmentally-conscious law students collaborate with science graduate students to help solve community issues. The law school also brings in noted academics from various fields through its Center for the Interdisciplinary Study of Work and Social Capital. There are many other opportunities for interdisciplinary engagement outside the School of Law. For example, three law students co-teach an undergraduate course on Women & the Law each semester.\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nWashington University Law offers myriad study abroad opportunities, including exchange programs with 12 law schools in 10 countries scattered among three continents. A Summer Institute for Global Justice, operated in conjunction with Utrecht University and Case Western Reserve University, takes students to the Netherlands for a six-week, six-credit program on international and comparative law. WUSTL students may also participate in the study abroad programs of other ABA-approved law schools.\n\nLaw students who want truly international careers may be drawn to the Transnational Law Program, which allows students to earn a J.D. as well as an LL.M. from Utrecht University, Queen's University Belfast (Northern Ireland), the University of Trento (Italy), or the Catholic University in Portugal. WashULaw students spend four years total completing both degrees: five semesters in St. Louis and three in Europe.\n\nWashULaw also enables students to take advantage of ad hoc study abroad opportunities at schools with whom the law school does not have an exchange agreement. Many foreign law schools have a \"visiting foreign student\" status, whereby students may attend classes at a lower tuition rate. Law school students have taken advantage of these programs to spend a semester at schools in the United Kingdom, Korea, Japan and China.\n\nGraduate Programs\n\nWashULaw offers a wide variety of graduate law degrees for both American and foreign-trained lawyers. LL.M. degrees in Taxation and Intellectual Property & Technology Law give lawyers specialized training in technical disciplines; the former can be combined with a J.D. in six or seven semesters. An LL.M. in US Law is aimed at lawyers who received law degrees from foreign institutions and want to learn about the American legal system for educational or professional reasons. While earning an American LL.M. does not allow foreign lawyers to sit for the bar in most states, it does qualify them for the bar exams in New York and California, two of the most popular destinations for foreign-trained attorneys. Applicants to this program do not need to take the LSAT, but they must prove English proficiency.\n\nTwo additional graduate programs cater to very different situations. The Master of Legal Studies is a non-professional degree for people like patent agents who want some exposure to legal training. The J.S.D. is an advanced, independent, research-driven degree intended for those with original research ideas and serious interest in legal academia.\n\nStudent Activities\n\nWhile law school academics take up plenty of time, WashULaw students stay busy outside of the classroom and library with almost four dozen student organizations, as well as many competition options. Some of these activities are professional in focus, like the Criminal Law Society or the Public Interest Law Society; others are just for fun, like the Fitness Club or the Sidebar Wine Society. Students can seek out the thrill of competition in both intramural and external moot courts that range from general appellate contests to specialties like Environmental or Intellectual Property Law, and in Client Counseling, Negotiation, and Mediation competitions.\n\nJournals\n\nAcademic journals provide editing and writing experience, as well as an attractive resume line. WashULaw currently publishes four journals: the general-interest Washington University Law Review, the symposium-based Journal of Law and Policy, the Global Studies Law Review, and the newest addition, the Jurisprudence Review.\n\nJournal members are selected on the basis of first-year grades and a mandatory writing competition held at the end of spring semester (there is a separate competition for transfer and LL.M. students). Students who finish 1L year in the top 3% of their class and complete the writing competition \"in good faith\" can automatically join their first-choice publication; others are evaluated solely on write-on performance. The writing competition comprises an editing exercise and a case comment of about 20 pages (including endnotes). One student writes that while competition for Law Review is stiff, \"almost everyone I know who completed the write-on got something\" among the remaining journals.[xx]\n\nFacilities\n\nWashington University's campus, which takes its architectural cues from the quintessentially academic feels of Oxford and Cambridge, rivals the visual appeal of many Ivy League universities. Though the law school's Anheuser-Busch Hall was built in 1997 and Seigle Hall in 2008, their Collegiate Gothic architecture does not disappoint, blending in well with the rest of the university's Danforth Campus. The interiors are also impressive and surprisingly modern given the buildings' Old World looks.\n\nAnheuser-Busch Hall's 175,000 square feet house classrooms, offices, two courtrooms, and the Law Library. This library contains 700,000 print volumes, extensive online database subscriptions, and a reading room that one TLS member likens to \"something out of Harry Potter.\"[xxi] The building features high-speed fiber optic network access and an advanced video-on-demand network; classrooms and courtrooms have advanced projection and recording technology. Plenty of commons space, including a large, glass-roofed courtyard, gives students room to relax and socialize. The in-house Law Café was completely renovated in 2014 and offers coffee, breakfast, and lunch, with occasional evening hours.\n\nSeigle Hall, directly adjacent to Anheuser-Busch Hall, houses several seminar and lecture-style classrooms, along with offices for the four student publications, the Center for Empirical Research in the Law (CERL), the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute, and the law school's graduate programs. Although it's another building, students will never have to hoof it far across campus between classes - Seigle Hall is about 30 feet from Anheuser-Busch Hall.\n\nEmployment Prospects\n\nCurrent students receive massive support from Washington University Law's very proactive Center for Career Development. With 11 staff members dedicated to finding meaningful career placements, the CCD ensures no student is left behind. WashULaw's career strategists double as J.D. Advisors, providing hands-on support to students from the get-go. A student will meet with a strategist in the first semester of the 1L year and discuss their goals: where they want to go, what they want to do, and everything they need to do during the three years of law school to meet those goals. The J.D. Advisor helps the students plan their entire law school experience toward their long-term goals, from the classes they choose to take, to the activities they're involved in, to the kind of summertime employment they should seek. CCD partners with students from day one to guide them through their career paths and offer extensive career services programming throughout their time here. The individualized approach is key to successful employment outcomes. This approach also enables CCD to work with employers to match students with job opportunities expertly.\n\n*Percentages do not add to 100%. Historically, a good chunk of WashULaw grads have stayed in Missouri. WashULaw-trained associates at large area firms like Bryan Cave and Thompson Coburn typically have good grades and other credentials. They sometimes must fight to convince local employers that they are not flight risks. Prospective students concerned about finding employment in the St. Louis area should rest assured that St. Louis is WashULaw's #1 employment market, with Chicago, DC, and New York close behind.\n\nOn the other hand, some potential applicants worry about Wash U's ability to send graduates to coastal markets. As indicated in the table above, graduates do make it to East Coast destinations like New York and Washington, D.C. (the decline in the percentage of graduates heading to the South Atlantic region from 2008 to 2009 may reflect the tightening of what has historically been a very competitive market). A smaller percentage also makes it to the West Coast. The National Association of Legal Employers database can be filtered by law schools at which the employer does on-campus interviews. Although multiple offices of large national firms are counted twice, there are actually more employers listed for markets like D.C. and the Bay Area than for St. Louis. The school also provides this list of employers in each state who \"actively recruit\" WUSTL students. Moreover, the Career Services Office makes significant efforts to bolster the school's reputation in non-Midwestern cities. Still, shooting for competitive coastal markets makes good grades a necessity - top-third seems to be the cut-off for consideration by many firms - so those committed to working in specific coastal cities should at least consider options closer to their target markets.\n\nPrivate Practice\n\nWashington University School of Law makes every effort to assist students with fulfilling their professional goals. Obtaining a professional and appropriate position after graduation is key to the school’s mission. Graduates go on to secure important jobs in many areas of law. For the Class of 2016 approximately 49% of students were employed in big law or in a clerkship. Washington University Law is not a regional school and graduates are able to interview with firms across the country. Proud alumni are located in all 50 states and 24 countries.\n\nClerkships\n\nFor some highly qualified law students, the first stop after graduation is not a large firm, but instead a judicial clerkship. Clerks basically serve as personal assistants to judges, doing legal research for cases and dealing with day-to-day issues of the court. Some clerks write bench memos or even first drafts of opinions, and many gain a well-connected lifelong mentor. Conventional wisdom holds that clerks learn legal skills and courtroom mechanics more quickly than first-year associates at law firms, and clerking for the right judge can lend significant cachet to a résumé.\n\nFor the last two years, about 8% of WashULaw graduates went on to clerkships, with many working for Article III judges at the district or appellate level. There is a great clerkship for every WashULaw student. Students meet with a dedicated Faculty Clerkship Committee, Peer Advisors, the Career Center, and alumni. Our team approach ensures each student is positioned for the greatest success in their clerkship search.\n\nGovernment and Public Interest\n\nIn recent years, WUSTL has sent about 8-10% of each class to government employment not counting judicial clerkships, and another 4-6% to public interest organizations. Government employment can range from prosecutor and public defender offices to federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and Securities & Exchange Commission. Public interest organizations usually provide legal services to a population who would not otherwise be able to afford them, or advocate for a set of issues.\n\nAlthough some government and public interest employers come to on-campus and regional interview programs, the hiring process is not as streamlined as it is for many law firms. Making connections is key, as is building a resume that demonstrates a long-term interest in service-oriented work. To the latter end, those who want to work for the government after graduation should pursue government internships or externships, or consider participating in the Congressional & Administrative Clinic. Similarly, those who want to work in non-profit public interest should consider a clinic and take advantage of the summer public interest stipend program. Students work directly with the Center for Career Development throughout their three years to secure top employment in these areas.\n\nHousing and Transportation\n\nFor those comparing Wash U to other urban law schools, cost of housing will almost definitely weigh in favor of the St. Louis school. One TLS member writes:\n\nFor those of you coming in from NYC/DC/LA etc., you are going to be absolutely blown away by the low cost of living. I pay $500 a month ($1,000 total, since I have a roommate) for a fully-furnished, really nice apartment with new furniture, appliances, and a washer/dryer unit in the apartment. The most I've heard of anyone spending is $1,000 a month, but [that person has] a really swanky place in Central West End. You can easily keep your rent in the $500-600 range if you take on a roommate, and if you're paying over $750 a month, you're in the expensive range.[xxxi]\n\nThe city offers a range of neighborhoods that should suit most tastes. Many law students choose University City for its convenience: the university and a metro stop are within easy walking distance. Central West End, slightly farther away from campus, attracts a large number of law students with its shopping, dining, and nightlife options. Other popular areas include Clayton, a quiet suburb within a few minutes' drive of the law school, and a revitalized Downtown area with plenty of restaurants and bars as well as Busch Stadium, home of the beloved Cardinals.\n\nThough most students live in non-university affiliated apartments, Wash U's Quadrangle Housing maintains some graduate and professional housing in the University City, Central West End, and Skinker DeBalievere neighborhoods.\n\nA car is not a necessity thanks to a light rail and bus system -Wash U students get a free pass - and the availability of housing within walking or biking distance of the university. Parking is readily available in many neighborhoods, although those interested in neighborhoods like Central West End and Downtown should be mindful of some parking and traffic issues.\n\nQuality of Life\n\nSt. Louis residents enjoy the amenities and entertainment options of a big city - the Greater St. Louis area has almost three million residents - without the high cost of living and traffic problems that plague many urban centers. While the city is somewhat notorious for violent crime, Wash U students on TLS do not report feeling unsafe in any of the areas frequented by law school students, and seem to enjoy St. Louis. A forum user has this to say:\n\nIt's not a booming cosmopolitan metropolis, but it holds its own in having fun things to do: tons of museums, Forest Park, three major professional sports teams (well, two and a half, considering the Rams), some beautiful theaters, and enough of nightlife to keep a law student busy and not bored.[xxxii]\n\nThough not a world cultural capital, St. Louis has good food in lots of variety - with one possible exception:\n\nI've tried just about every Mexican place around here that I've seen or heard of, and have yet to find anything better than \"meh.\" If you're looking for something along the lines of Texas or SoCal, prepare to be disappointed. But with that said, we do a lot of other ethnic foods really well. If you want good Thai, Vietnamese, Indian, Ethiopian, Brazilian, or Japanese/Sushi, you're in luck. The Hill [a neighborhood] is awesome for Italian. And if you want a good BBQ, try Pappy's.\n\nWhile the areas around WUSTL and SLU have their fair share of college bars, St. Louis nightlife also offers some diversity, as one TLS member attests:\n\nThere's a hip collection of bars in the Tower Grove Park area on Manchester, which is just southeast of Forest Park. Kind of the indie-rock crowd. The Delmar Loop is pretty urban/progressive/yoga-ish as well. And there are some other dive bar establishments on South Grand Ave. Further east of Manchester is a couple of gay bars. Downtown on Washington Ave. there's more of an urban-chic crowd, but it's more of a late-night clubbing atmosphere. Central West End is kind of a yuppie-chic crowd, but everything around here closes early (1am). Laclede's Landing by the river has some sports-oriented bars and pubs. And downtown Clayton has some more suburban, lower-key bars.[xxxiii]\n\nAs with any law school or city, there is no substitute for visiting. Three years is a long time, and an experience as stressful as law school is best done in a comfortable place, so anyone seriously considering attending Wash U should check the place out in person.\n\nSynopsis\n\nWashington University in St. Louis has a nationally respected law school with a top clinical program, a dedicated Career Services Office, and enough of an urban feel to satisfy all but the most excitement-craving law students (oxymoron?). For the foreseeable future, job prospects for those without top grades or other standout résumé lines may not justify sticker price for students without significant financial resources. Still, especially for applicants who land scholarships, there is much to recommend the oldest continuously operating law school west of the Mississippi.\n\nWashington University School of Law\n\nAdmissions Office\n\nCampus Box 1120, One Brookings Drive\n\nSt. Louis, MO 63130-4899\n\nPhone: (314) 935-4525\n\nE-mail: applylaw@wustl.edu\n\nWebsite: apply.law.wustl.edu\n\nSummary\n\nEstablished 1867 Location St. Louis, MO Dean Russell K.
