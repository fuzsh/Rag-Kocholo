        "text": "Washington University School of Law is one of the top 20 U.S. law schools and conveniently located in the center of the United States in Saint Louis, Missouri. Along with the traditional JD degree, it offers LLM degrees for foreign-trained lawyers in US Law, Intellectual Property Law (IP), Negotiation and Dispute Resolution (NDR), and Tax. The Law School also offers a Master of Legal Studies (for non-lawyers) and a JSD degree (doctorate). Recent law-school graduates as well as seasoned practitioners from over 30 countries add to a culturally-diverse and intellectually-stimulating environment, where international students take 90% of their classes with American peers from the JD programs. Outside the classroom, LLM students can participate in several Moot Court competitions such as the Jessup Moot Court. They can also participate in the Judicial Learning Experience Program (JELP) where they are paired up with a local judge. For those students interested in scholarly writing opportunities, they can be part of the International Student Advisory Board of the Global Studies Law Review. As far as career development, students participate in the yearly West Coast Career Fair in February and can apply for a summer internship (eg., World Bank)."
