        "text": "Stroke MD\n\n2020\n\nBuilt for the Department of Surgery at the WashU Med School, the Stroke MD app offers acute care providers a step-by-step algorithm to simplify acute ischemic stroke decision-making.\n\nBreast Feeding Friend App (BFF)\n\n2017\n\nDevSTAC developed an Android app for a study at the Washington University School of Medicine. BFF is a handheld personal lactation consultant which provides detailed information for new mothers about breastfeeding.\n\nDevSTAC built this application from the ground-up, gathering requirements, creating both app and web portal, and performing system and integration testing.\n\nWUSTL Mobile Transportation Module\n\n2017\n\nDevSTAC enhanced iOS version of the WUSTL Mobile iOS app by replacing the “Circulator” module with a “Transportation” module.\n\nThis change created a more modular back-end system for adding new transportation options, and allows members of the Wash U community to see the location of the Metro Green Line, Campus Circulator, West Campus Shuttle, and other transportation options in real-time.\n\nCOVID Forecasting\n\nA website which Forecasts COVID-19 cases in the US under different levels of social distancing.\n\nWashU Institute for Public Health\n\nA website for the WashU Institute for Public Health, whose mission is to harness the strengths of Washington University in St. Louis to address the complex health issues and health disparities facing the St. Louis region and the world.\n\nAfrica Initiative\n\nWebsite for The Africa Initiative at Washington university, an interdisciplinary endeavor committed to expanding knowledge and creating teaching, learning, and cultural opportunities for faculty, staff, and students.\n\nTrees.WUSTL Website\n\n(2018) Facilities Planning & Management hired DevSTAC to create a website to spotlight significant trees on WashU’s campus; aligning with WashU’s goal to become a Level 1 Arboretum.\n\nThe project included building a WordPress website, taking standard and 360 degree photography of the trees, and designing signs with QR codes that were mounted on the trees themselves. When scanned, the QR codes present the user with detailed information about the tree.\n\nThe project will continue as we add more trees being to the site and add photos of existing trees at various times through the year.\n\n3D Data Preservation website\n\nAn inclusive, interdisciplinary community of librarians, researchers, engineers, and designers who collaborate to develop better and more intuitive digital 3D data preservation practices.\n\nContraceptive Education Website\n\n(2019) The obstetrics and gynecology department hired DevSTAC to work on the development of a tool that presents information about contraceptives organized from most to least effective based on entered personal information/preferences.\n\nThe data it would draw from would be from the US Medical Eligibility Criteria for contraception. It would need to be easily updatable as more information or new contraceptive options become available.\n\nSTS Printer Status Webpage\n\n(2018) The STS printer status webpage allows you to check the status of any lab printers managed by Student Technology Services. Low on toner? Out of paper? You can check before you print!\n\nWhile the webpage isn’t new, DevSTAC enhanced the application to make it more accurate, minimize down-time, align with best-practices in regards to documentation and coding and improve and streamline administrative functionality.\n\nAperio Examen Website\n\n(2016) Aperio Examen is a website, built using the software framework Ruby on Rails, which allows students to report cognitive behavioral data for a class taught by the Business School’s Jackson Nickerson.\n\nSummer Conferences Policies Website\n\n(2017) Summer Conferences wanted to save money and go green by replacing paper pamphlets with a website filled with maps, FAQs and information about parking and safety.\n\nFor this website, WordPress was the way to go, allowing Summer Conferences to make future changes to the content themselves.\n\nCPN-CD Calculator\n\nA clinical prediction tool for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.\n\nWashU Academic Integrity Quiz\n\nA project to revamp the video and test currently taken by incoming students as part of orientation.
