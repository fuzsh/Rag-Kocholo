        "text": "apostrophe\n\nUse an apostrophe to indicate that a noun is possessive.\n\nAdd an ’s for the following:\n\nPlural nouns not ending in s: women’s rights, the alumni’s contribution.\n\nSingular nouns not ending in s: the professor’s office, the horse’s food, the student’s room.\n\nFor compound words apply the apostrophe or ’s to the word closest to the object possessed: the major general’s decision, the major generals’ decisions, the attorney general’s request, the attorneys general’s request, Martin Luther King Jr.’s father.\n\nFor joint possession and individual possession, use a possessive form only after the last word if ownership is joint: George and Mary’s car. Use a possessive form after both words if the objects are individually owned: George’s and Mary’s cars.\n\nDescriptive phrases not ending in s: a children’s hospital, a people’s republic.\n\nPlurals of a single letter: Mind your p’s and q’s. He learned the three R’s and brought home a report card with four A’s and two B’s. The Oakland A’s won the pennant.\n\nAdd only an apostrophe for the following:\n\nPlural nouns ending in s: states’ rights, the horses’ food, the professors’ lounge, the students’ class gift.\n\nNouns plural in form, singular in meaning: mathematics’ rules, measles’ effects. The same rule applies for the formal name of a singular entry: General Motors’ profits, the United States’ wealth.\n\nSingular proper nouns ending in s: Achilles’ heel, Hercules’ labors, Arkansas’ schools, John Adams’ legacy. However, if a composition title or trademarked name uses an ’s after a singular proper noun, the ’s should be preserved.\n\nSingular nouns ending in an s sound (e.g., ce, x, z) followed by a word that begins with s: for appearance’ sake, for conscience’ sake, the justice’ seat.\n\nContractions, omitted letters and figures: it’s, don’t, ’tis the season, rock ‘n’ roll, the class of ’62, the Spirit of ’76, the ’20s.\n\nSee “AP Stylebook” possessives entry for additional guidance.\n\nbrackets\n\nUse brackets to add clarification or correct quoted material: “I couldn’t believe that he [Jackson] would hit three home runs,” said the manager. Use the Latin word sic, which means intentionally so written, in brackets to indicate that an error in the quoted material is being reproduced exactly: “We were disappointed to find out that only five in the class is [sic] signed up for the program.”\n\ncolon\n\nThe colon is a mark of emphasis and/or anticipation. Its most frequent use is at the end of a sentence to introduce a list or text: She narrowed her decision to three colleges: Dartmouth, Boston College and GW.\n\nCapitalize the first word after a colon only if it is a proper noun or the start of a complete sentence: She had one major condition: The school must have a strong history department. She also wanted a college that offered her two favorite sports: volleyball and rugby.\n\nDo not use a colon between a verb and its compliment or object:\n\nRIGHT: Her three favorite teams are the Cardinals, Eagles and Bears.\n\nWRONG: Her three favorite teams are: the Cardinals, Eagles and Bears.\n\nRIGHT: There were many considerations including cost, location and curriculum.\n\nWRONG: There were many considerations including: cost, location and curriculum.\n\ncomma\n\nUse a comma to separate elements in a series: He ate bread, meat and pie. Also use the comma (not the semicolon) for a simple series: They had fruit, custard, cake and ice cream, peanut butter and jelly and pudding. In a more complex series that may involve names, titles and degree notations for more than one person, use a semicolon (see semicolon entry).\n\nDo not use the serial comma in a simple series: red, white and blue.\n\nUse a comma after a long introductory phrase or clause: After stealing the crown jewels from the Tower of London, I went home for tea. If the introductory material is short (a rule of thumb is five words or less), do not use the comma: After the theft I went home for tea. But use the comma if the sentence would be confusing without it: The day before, I’d robbed the Bank of England.\n\nUse commas to offset a person’s name, as in this case: He introduced his wife, Anne, to the mayor. Do not use a comma in this sentence: He attended the party with wife Anne.\n\nUse a comma to separate independent clauses that are joined by and, but, for, or, nor, because or so: We are visiting Washington, and we also plan a side trip to Williamsburg, Va. As a rule of thumb, use a comma if the second clause can stand alone as a sentence:\n\nCOMMA: Mark went to the meeting, and he took notes.\n\nNO COMMA: Mark went to the meeting and took notes.\n\nUse a comma to set off a nonessential word or phrase but do not use if a word or phrase is essential. Correct: The company chair, John James, spoke at the meeting. (Because a company can only have one chair the name is not essential to the sentence.) The Smiths ate dinner with their daughter Julie. (In this case because the Smiths have more than one daughter, the inclusion of Julie’s name is critical if the reader is to know which daughter is meant.) Julie and her husband, Jeff, went shopping. (Again because Julie has only one husband his name should be set off by commas.)\n\nUse a comma to separate elements of an address: the Virginia Science and Technology Campus is located in Ashburn, Va., in the Dulles technology corridor.\n\nUse a comma between proper names and titles: Vittorio Bonori, president of Zenith, chaired the meeting.\n\nUse a comma to introduce a complete sentence or quote that is a complete sentence: The president said, “I am happy to be a part of such a rich tradition.”\n\nAlso use a comma before quote attribution. “I am happy to be part of such a rich tradition,” the president said.\n\nDo not use a comma to introduce a partial quote: The president called the event a “rich tradition.”\n\nIn use with quotes, commas always go inside quotation marks.\n\ndash\n\nAn em dash — a long line exactly like the one used in this sentence — is what should be used to enclose a word or word group that interrupts the main structure: We will fly to Paris in June — if I get a raise. Smith offered a plan — an unprecedented plan to raise revenues.\n\nThe dash also can be used within a phrase that otherwise would be set off by commas when there are series or words that must be separated by commas within the phrase: He listed the qualities — intelligence, humor, independence — that he liked in an executive.\n\nThe em dash is not to be confused with its shorter relative, the en dash. The en dash, which should be used in noting page numbers, dates and game scores: In the 2022-23 men’s basketball season, the team won the championship 98–85. The en dash should not be used in place of a hyphen.\n\nellipsis\n\nWhen using, treat the ellipsis as a three-letter word with three dots and a space on each side.\n\nUse the ellipsis to indicate the deletion of one or more words in condensing quotes, texts and documents. Be very careful to avoid deletions that would distort the meaning.\n\n“I ... tried to do what was best.”\n\nIf the words that precede an ellipsis constitute a grammatically complete sentence, either in the original or in the condensation, place a period at the end of the last word before the ellipsis. Follow it with a regular space and an ellipsis: I no longer have a strong enough political base. ...\n\nexclamation point\n\nUse sparingly to express a high degree of surprise, incredulity or other strong emotion. Place the mark inside quotes when part of quoted material. Place it outside of quotes when not part of the quoted material. Do not use a comma or period after the exclamation mark.\n\nRIGHT: “Never!” she shouted.\n\nhyphens\n\nUse to join adjectives and avoid ambiguity. Consult “AP Styleguide” and “Webster’s New World Dictionary” for guidance on hyphenations with prefixes.\n\nAdditional guidelines:\n\nCompound modifiers: When two or more words that express a single concept are used before a noun, use a hyphen to link them with the exceptions of the word “very” and adverbs that end in “ly”: a high-profile case, a 19,000-square-foot building, a full-time job, a poorly performed play. Most of the time these combinations are not hyphenated after a noun: She works full time.\n\nCompound nouns: Many noun compounds are hyphenated: brother-in-law, well-being, 18-year-old.\n\nWith numbers: Hyphenate the written form of compound numbers and fractions: One-fifth of my income is spent on rent.\n\nBetween a prefix and proper name: mid-Atlantic.\n\nCapitalization: When hyphenated words are used in headlines, both words should be capitalized: Blue-Green.\n\nSuspensive hyphenation: He received a 10- to 20- year sentence in prison.\n\nparentheses\n\nUse sparingly to insert necessary background or reference material. Punctuation: Place a period outside parentheses if the material inside is not a stand alone complete sentence (like this fragment). Otherwise, place periods inside parentheses.\n\nperiod\n\nUse with the following:\n\nAt the end of a declarative sentence: The style guide is finished.\n\nAt the end of a rhetorical question if the statement is more of a suggestion than a question: Why don’t we go.\n\nAt the end of an indirect question: He asked what time it was.\n\nUse a single space after a period at the end of a sentence.\n\nquestion mark\n\nUse with the following:\n\nAt the end of a direct question: Who attended the lecture?\n\nIn the middle of an interpolated question: You told me — Did I hear you correctly? — that we should meet in the conference room.\n\nAt the end of a full sentence with multiple questions: Did he plan the event, book the guests and write the opening remarks? However, it is acceptable to use question marks with each question for emphasis: Have you finished planning the event? Booked the guests? Written the opening remarks?\n\nPlacement with quotation marks: A question mark can be inside or out depending on the meaning: He asked, “How much will it cost?” What is the Louvre’s most famous painting after the “Mona Lisa”?\n\nA question mark supersedes the comma that normally is used when supplying attribution for a quotation: “Who won?” he asked.\n\nquotation marks\n\nUse with the following:\n\nDirect quotations: Plato said, “Necessity is the mother of invention.”\n\nWith personal nicknames: Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.\n\nWith words used in an ironical sense: The “debate” turned into a free-for-all.\n\nQuotes may be used with unfamiliar terms or phrases on first reference: A defensive offsides call is known as “encroachment.” Do not put subsequent references to encroachment in quotation marks. Quotation mark placement with other punctuation:\n\nPeriods and commas always go within quotation marks.\n\nDashes, question marks and exclamation points go within the quotation marks when they apply to the quoted matter only. They go outside when applied to the whole sentence. This second rule helps the reader attribute the meaning and emotions of these remarks to the right source: The first sentence of Barack Obama’s fundraising letter was, “I need your vote!” I thought John McCain was very forceful when he said, “I need your vote”! The first sentence indicates Obama’s emphasis and excitement. The second sentence indicates the author’s emphasis and excitement.\n\nSemicolons go outside of quotation marks.\n\nsemicolon\n\nUse semicolons with the following:\n\nTo clarify a series, especially when individual segments contain material that also must be set off by commas: The meeting was attended by several graduates: Joe Alumnus, B.A. ’88, J.D. ’92; Martha Alumna, B.A. ’77, M.A. ’79, Ph.D. ’85; and Harry Hippo, M.F.A. ’67.\n\nTo link independent clauses, especially when coordinating conjunctions such as “and,” “but” or “for” not present: The package was due last week; it arrived today.\n\nPlace semicolons outside of quotation marks."
