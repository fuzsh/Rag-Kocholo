        "text": "The LLM programs at GW Law allow students to combine traditionally taught courses with in-depth seminars, internships, and skills training for a complete approach to legal education. LLM students take courses with JD students, and the resulting exchange of ideas and perspectives is rewarding for both groups. Graduates of our programs become leaders in business, international organizations, the judiciary, government, and private legal practice throughout the world. Full-time faculty members in each specialized field provide instruction, academic advising, and thesis supervision.\n\nLLM Programs\n\n*Business and Finance Law\n\n*Energy and Environmental Law\n\n*Environmental Law\n\n*General LLM\n\n*Government Procurement Law\n\n*Government Procurement and Environmental Law\n\n*Intellectual Property Law\n\n*International and Comparative Law\n\n*International Environmental Law\n\n*Litigation and Dispute Resolution\n\n*National Security and Cybersecurity Law\n\n*National Security and U.S. Foreign Relations Law\n\nFor more details on GW's LLM Programs, visit www.law.gwu.edu/academics.\n\nExperience the International Reach of a GW Law Degree\n\nLast year, more than 200 students from 50 countries found that there is no better place to earn an LLM than at The George Washington University Law School in the heart of Washington, D.C.\n\nWith our campus just blocks from the White House, World Bank and International Monetary Fund, U.S. Department of State, Organization of American States, and countless other government agencies, nonprofit agencies, and international organizations, GW Law offers students unmatched networking opportunities to engage in innovative internships and programming throughout Washington, D.C.\n\nEstablished in 1865, The George Washington University Law School is the oldest law school in the District of Columbia, and has produced some of the finest minds across the spectrum of legal scholarship. That tradition continues today, as GW Law graduates use the knowledge and skills they gain here to influence the critical legal conversations of our times.\n\nFor more details on GW Law, visit http://www.law.gwu.edu/School/Pages/Glance.aspx\n\nProfessor Roger Schechter\n\nOur faculty of world-renowned scholars and practitioners challenges and engages students with a stimulating curriculum\n\nthat teaches legal skills through extensive practice, academic coursework, and scholarly research. In addition to publishing widely cited books and articles, our professors litigate before the U.S. Supreme Court, international tribunals, and other courts; provide commentary to the news media; file briefs on behalf of members of Congress; testify on Capitol Hill; and serve as consultants to various governments around the world. Our adjunct faculty includes judges and seasoned practitioners both in private practice and in the highest levels of government. Their hands-on experience helps students build bridges between the opportunities of GW Law and the nation's capital.\n\nFor full faculty profiles, visit www.law.gwu.edu/faculty.\n\nApplicants with a JD from a U.S. or Puerto Rico law school must hold a BA or equivalent degree from a regionally accredited college or university and a JD or equivalent degree from a law school that is a member of the Association of American Law Schools (AALS) or is accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA).\n\nApplicants with a law degree from a law school outside of the United States must have earned the degree from a recognized institution. Non-U.S. law school graduates may also need to meet the minimum language test requirement (see below).\n\nAll candidates for admission must have demonstrated excellence in academic standing and professional achievements or positions indicating their capacity for performing master’s-level work.\n\nFor more information, visit www.law.gwu.edu/llm-application-information.\n\nApplications for the fall and spring semesters are accepted on a rolling basis.\n\nFor priority review, especially for scholarship consideration, applications for fall admission should be received by March 15th but will continue to be accepted on a space-available basis until June 1.\n\nFor spring admission, the priority deadline is November 1.\n\nFor more information, including admissions requirements and assistance, visit www.law.gwu.edu/llm-admissions.\n\nWashington, DC\n\nCalled the most livable city on the East Coast, Washington, D.C. offers a vibrant cultural life, a highly educated and multinational population, and numerous family-friendly neighborhoods. GW Law students can easily access almost any part of the D.C.-metro area using public transportation. From the Foggy Bottom-GWU Metrorail stop, located right on campus, students can arrive within minutes at internships on Capitol Hill, a baseball game at Nationals Park, or an exhibit at the National Gallery.\n\nFor more on DC and GW, visit http://www.law.gwu.edu/dc-gw-law\n\nGW Law's active, diverse student body has formed more than 50 student groups, and the law school is home to nine student-run law journals. Because of our location and the connections of our faculty, our students interact with prominent guest speakers and visitors, including Supreme Court justices and international political leaders.\n\nOur facilities are spacious, comfortable, and technologically advanced. GW Law is home to the world-renowned Jacob Burns Law Library, and our students enjoy the resources of a large urban university. Our students are supported and engaged by both a faculty committed to teaching and a staff dedicated to service.\n\nTo learn more about student organizations and student life at GW Law, visit http://www.law.gwu.edu/student-organizations"
