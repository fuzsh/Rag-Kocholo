A variety of output tools will be used but we will focus primarily on the planning for and use of laser cutters, 3D printers, and CNC routers. We will develop, design, and manufacture components that, when combined with readily available materials, can be used to create sculptural forms. This class will use iterative processes that move between digital and analog model-making and sketching. Students will be introduced to the concept of kitbashing, and the modification of salvaged and found parts. This course introduces these concepts to artists, designers, engineers, and anyone interested in exploring the possibilities of digital fabrication tools towards the creation of sculpture.

We will think through sculpture as alchemy, considering how a shift in material changes an object's meaning. We will learn to adapt objects through both digital and physical processes, applying 3D printing and mold-making techniques. Our studio practice will be supported by a discussion of artists working in the field, with readings, guest lectures, and group discussions that situate our studio conversation in a contemporary art dialogue.

This understanding of site includes built architecture, landscape, social order, public space, the exhibition space, our living space, the fictional space, even the digital space. At its core, site-work is the practice of deeply considering the intricacies of a place, then using this inquiry as a starting point to drive the work's creation. Moving from research to production, students will create a response to their chosen site that transforms, augments, or adapts a viewer's relationship to that space. A key challenge will be the choice of medium. The course will provide support for students to consider and practice a wide range of choices, from the traditional sculptural techniques of woodworking, metalworking, and moldmaking, to expanded media options that include sound and video installation, digital projects and augmented/virtual reality.\n\nSame as F20 ART 314T\n\nCredit 3 units.

Historically, portraits were painted of the royal or wealthy to document an accurate likeness and to display status and power. However, with the advent of photography, artists were freed to develop interpretations in style, process, and medium. With subjects such as family, friends, strangers, celebrities, and the self, the portrait has been used to reflect culture, identity, and the relationship between the artist and the sitter. Issues of race, sexuality, gender, vanity, and status continue to be relevant to contemporary practice. This is primarily a drawing class; students combine the study of contemporary portrait artists with a studio practice that encourages the development of a unique voice. Students consider how pose, gesture, lighting, and other factors work together to support their intentions. Initial assignment prompts progress to guided independent pursuits.

We will also consider displacements throughout history and value systems embedded in the construction of a sense of place. Is one's relationship to place personal? Is it collective, is it cultural, is it rooted in the surrounding environment? What are the marks that define a sense of place, and is there residue or lingering evidence that can be perceived? The medium of photography has unique capacities to address these questions. This studio course builds knowledge through photographic practice with accompanying readings, seminar discussion and guided assignments. Students will participate in an active process of exploring diverse concepts of place in relationship to the built environment. Students will be introduced to a range of ways of making and thinking about the subject of place, including looking at place as site, as geography, as memory, as non-place, as urban space, as rural space, as community, and as ecological site.

But how does that image snapped with your smartphone arrive on your screen? As technology marches forward, we have images literally at our fingertips, yet the actual process of producing the picture is, ironically, more elusive. In this course, we will dive into experimental processes and examine how physically making the picture can affect the content of that picture. As you craft images, ideas become tied to process and suggest new directions, strategies and subjects. We will begin with cameraless techniques, such as the photogram and cyanotype; we will investigate the principle of the camera obscura; we will test out rudimentary cameras such as the pinhole and disposable models; and we will experiment with printing techniques such as Polaroid and Xerox transfer, examining artists using these various techniques along the way.
