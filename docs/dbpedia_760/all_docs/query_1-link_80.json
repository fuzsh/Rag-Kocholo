        "text": "Western Washington University, public, coeducational institution of higher learning in Bellingham, Washington, U.S. It comprises Fairhaven College (an interdisciplinary studies program); Woodring College of Education; Huxley College of Environmental Studies; colleges of business and economics, fine and performing arts, and arts and sciences; and a graduate school. In addition to undergraduate studies, the university offers a range of master’s degree programs in business, sciences, humanities, fine arts, and education. The university’s Shannon Point Marine Center is an 87-acre (35-hectare) research area located at Anacortes; its equipment includes a fleet of research vessels. Other research facilities include the Institute for Watershed Studies, the Vehicle Research Institute, and the Small Business Institute. Total enrollment is approximately 12,000.\n\nWestern Washington University was founded in 1893 as New Whatcom State Normal (teacher training) School. Instruction did not begin until 1899. The school began granting degrees in 1933, and in 1937 it became one of Washington’s three colleges of education. It became a state college in 1961 and a university in 1977."
