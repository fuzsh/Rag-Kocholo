        "text": "Sullivan & Cromwell’s relationship with George Washington University Law School dates back to 1911, when John Foster Dulles, a major figure in the history of both the Firm and international diplomacy, joined as an associate. In addition to his service as chair of the Firm, Dulles went on to become a United States Senator and then Secretary of State under President Eisenhower.\n\nToday, alumni of George Washington University Law School at Sullivan & Cromwell practice within a broad range of areas under our General Practice (corporate) and Litigation groups in both our domestic and international offices. Four S&C partners are graduates of GW Law: Ari Blaut (GW ’07), a partner in S&C’s Finance & Restructuring Group and Co-Head of the Firm’s U.S. Credit & Leveraged Finance Practice; Audra Cohen (GW ’92), who serves as Co-Managing Partner of the Firm’s General Practice Group globally and as a partner in its M&A and Corporate Governance Practices; Bob Downes (GW ’91), who serves as Co-Head of the Firm’s Capital Markets Group; and Sam Woodall (GW ’01), a Washington, D.C.-based General Practice partner."
