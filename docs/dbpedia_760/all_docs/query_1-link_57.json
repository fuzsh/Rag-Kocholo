In addition to being a place to explore between classes, our proximity to courthouses, government offices, and non-governmental organizations makes our location ideal for students participating in externships. We are also a short walk from diverse and vibrant neighborhoods including Hayes Valley, with its shops and restaurants, and South of Market, home to some of the biggest names in technology. Weâ€™re also just a few subway stops away from Union Square, the beautiful Ferry Building with its famous outdoor markets, as well as neighborhoods like the Castro and the Mission.\n\nLaunch Experience"
