        "text": "School-specific borrowing and earnings data on this page come from the United States Department of Education, except for the estimated monthly payment. In calculating the estimated monthly payment, the Education Department has used unwarranted assumptions. In 2019, ED used an imputed rate over 7%, which could only have been a proper weighted interest rate for some (if any) borrowers. In 2020, ED used an imputed rate of 4.3%, which would have been the weighted interest rate for zero borrowers. Instead, LST calculated an interest rate for each cohort based on the interest rates from all years those included graduates borrowed. For the current page's year, we used a rate of 6.3%."
