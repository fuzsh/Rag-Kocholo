        "text": "In high school, students often are given the impression that the study of history simply requires memorization of names, dates, and other facts about events in the past. At the college level, however, the study of history facilitates the development of research, analytical, evaluative, and interpretive skills. The study of history involves a careful search through existing evidence to determine what happened in the past, but understanding how and why that evidence was created and then saved stands at the center of the discipline. It’s all about asking tough questions.\n\nHistory/Social Studies focuses on locating and accessing a wide range of sources to analyze historical evidence, including textual and visual sources to evaluate historical interpretations, and to develop and support one’s own interpretations. The quantity of writing and discussion required in history courses also helps students to develop effective communication skills. The required courses in economics, geography, and political science are intended to prepare students to teach these subjects in middle and high schools.\n\nThat’s why the History major at Western prepares students for many different careers. Due to the quantity of reading, writing, and discussion, History majors have strong communication and analytical skills, which are valued by all employers, including businesses and government agencies. History majors learn how to locate and access a wide range of sources, to analyze evidence, including textual and visual sources, to evaluate competing interpretations, and to develop and support their own interpretations. They can help make sense of the kinds of challenges faced by almost any organization or business.\n\nThe History/Social Studies major at Western is designed to prepare students to teach history and social studies in secondary schools. However, this major also prepares students for a wider range of careers. The History/Social Studies degree does not require that a student pursue a teaching certificate. History/Social Studies majors interested in a Secondary Education certification must apply separately to the certification program in Woodring College of Education.\n\nThe History—Elementary major at Western is designed for students who plan to become elementary school teachers. In their history courses, History—Elementary majors learn how to locate and access a wide range of sources, analyze historical evidence including textual and visual sources, evaluate historical interpretations, and develop and support their own interpretations. The quantity of writing and discussion required in history courses also helps students to develop effective communication skills.\n\nThe History—Elementary major satisfies the academic major requirement for teacher certification with an endorsement in elementary education and must be accompanied by the professional preparation program in Elementary Education. See the Elementary Education section of the University catalog for program admission, completion, and teacher certification requirements.\n\nWestern’s History Department is part of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences.\n\nLiberal Arts and Sciences majors show some of the highest gains in critical thinking and analytical skills, the skills employers consistently say that they want most. History majors, in addition, learn to think about other cultures past and present, an important career skill in an increasingly diverse world. In short, History majors’ skills prepare them to be effective citizens, lifelong learners, and to have successful careers. Some choose to work in history-related fields such as teaching, library science, museum studies, or public history. The vast majority of History majors, however, go on to successful careers in business, government, and the nonprofit sectors. Studies show that History majors have some of the largest gains in earning over time because of their impressive skills.\n\nEmployers of Recent Western Graduates:\n\nGoogle\n\nLos Angeles Museum of the Holocaust: Processing Archivist\n\nSkagit County Public Works: Records Assistant\n\nUnited States Postal Service\n\nKing County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office: Legal Administrative Specialist\n\nFriedman Rubin Trial Lawyers: Investigator\n\nCEP Felipe II (Madrid, Spain): Language/Culture Assistant\n\nWestern graduates who pursue graduate studies are doing so at such schools as:\n\nUniversity of Maryland: Library and Information Science (MLS)\n\nWestern Washington University: Archival Studies and Records Management (MA)\n\nThe knowledge students acquire and the skills they develop in their history and social science courses prepare them for law school; graduate programs in teaching, public policy, or international affairs; and careers as journalists, government officials, and attorneys.\n\nThe History—Elementary major at Western is designed for students who plan to become elementary school teachers.
