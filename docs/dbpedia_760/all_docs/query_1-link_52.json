        "meta_description": "WashU Hillel has enhanced the lives of thousands of college students throughout St. Louis and helped Washington University cultivate one of the most vibrant campus Jewish communities in the country. We are honored to play an important role in advancing the Universitys goal of knowing every student by name and by story, and are the only organization that fosters Jewish pluralism on campus. We have a beautiful home on Forsyth, but we are more than just our building and the programs that take place there. WashU Hillel seeks to support and empower Jewish students along their own unique paths wherever they are and in whatever ways are most meaningful to them. Through social justice programs, Birthright Israel trips, Shabbat and holiday meals, Israel engagement, Jewish learning, social events, religious services, our popular DIY opportunities (helping students gather among friends for a Shabbat or holiday meal on their own), and so much more, we are committed to helping students make lasting friendships, find community, and develop their own enduring Jewish traditions. As a result of the pandemic, rising antisemitism, and the ongoing mental health epidemicweve learned to support students through all kinds of challenges.  Our Hillel currently serves approximately 1,850 Jewish undergraduates attending Washington University. Students from other universities throughout the St. Louis region enjoy our programming as well. During the 2022-23 academic year, WashU Hillel engaged almost 2,500 students, including over 1,000 Jewish undergraduates. Weve also taken hundreds of students to Israel our trips are open to all undergraduates in or from the St. Louis area and their friends ages 18-22. Our next trips will take place December 26, 2023 - January 5, 2024 and May 2024. More information about our Birthright Israel program can be found at washubirthright.com. WashU Hillel is a community partner of the Jewish Federation of St. Louis and is affiliated with Hillel International, connecting our organization to a vast network of Jewish college students throughout the world. To learn more about our Hillel or for information on how you can get involved or join one of our Birthright Israel trips, visit our website or find WashU Hillel on Instagram (@washuhillel) or Facebook (fb.me/washuhillel).This Hillel serves: Washington University in St. Louis; Fontbonne College",
