        "text": "This is a story about being out in the cold. And fittingly, albeit arbitrarily, it begins in winter, proceeds leapfrogging from one winter to another, and ends in this more or less sodden summer during which the pages of the books I have read – unless they are electronic ones – have seemed to fox beneath my fingertips, super-saturated as they've been with a very English atmosphere. This is a story about exile – not a dramatic, physical exercise to a real Siberia, but an internal exile, a driving out of a human awareness from a place of relative psychic safety, to one where all bets are off and anything may happen. A place – to expand the definition of place itself – where up may be down, and the solitary wanderer in a sea of fog observes, horrified, as its dank clouds and sinister volutes are inexorably modelled by the soughing winds into a likeness of his own anguished face.\n\nIn the winter of 1981-82 I was infesting an icy-cold house in the Jericho neighbourhood of north Oxford. My housemates had gone off for the Christmas holidays, but I had stayed behind. I lay on the three mattresses I had piled up to make a bed and looked at frost stars on the inside of the windows while I listened to the inadequate gas heater whiffle. The room was as narrow and high-ceilinged as a fish tank, painted a pale blue and embellished with a filigree of damp patches. I had laid the wardrobe on its side and piled all my books up, higgledy-piggledy in a narrow alcove. I had one picture in the room: a postage stamp-sized portrait of Heinrich von Kleist torn from one of these books and Blu-tacked to the wall above my wonky divan; and I had a solitary companion: a midget cactus, which, despite its having flowered in the week leading up to Christmas, I still became convinced – in one stoned fugue or another – was a plastic model, and so tore it from its little pot, only to discover its pathetic rootlets.\n\nWas I modernist then, a modernist with a homemade waterpipe, the body of which comprised a large Hellmann's mayonnaise jar in which floated a platoon or so of 002-scale American marines? Sucking on a length of plastic tubing and squirting out smoke, I watched the news on a four-inch television: as minute Soviet tanks rolled into Gdansk to suppress the Solidarity protesters, I revelled in the set's shrinkage of the enormity of this neo-Stalinism. If I was a modernist, I was an unconscious one – I would've been hard pressed to give you a close definition of the ascription then, and frankly, despite being a little more clear-headed, I'd find it just as hard to come up with one now. All I can recall is that aged 20 I was already finding conventional English prose fiction quite as constricting as I did conventional English society. No, that's an understatement: the simple past in which she did this and he did that; the omniscient and unnameable narrator who moves she and he about on the page as if these pronouns were chess pieces; the assumption of discernible motivations for these characters; and despite, as much as because of, a sprinkling of Freudian \"depth psychology\" across their features, the pathological woodenness of these fictive pawns – all of this was not irksome to me, but painful.\n\nBut in retrospect the portrait of Kleist was non-accidental: I had read The Marquise of O, and while it may have been the German Romantic's suicide pact that gripped me, the novella's exposure of the far more viciously constricting social mores of the early 19th century, and Kleist's opposition to them of a restless and uncertain self-consciousness, spoke to my own sense of being fundamentally ill at ease. I had gone to university to read politics and philosophy because I was interested in them and because an early exposure to then modish literary deconstruction (while doing an English S-level) had convinced me that critiquing fictional texts was not the right direction to go in if you wanted to create them. And create them is what I most fervently wanted to do. I can be guilty of overstatement in many areas – but this is not one of them: I felt a passionate desire to write fiction from about the age of 14, and I feel it still. That this passionate desire still seems to have been – even on the cusp of publishing my 14th work of narrative prose – unconsummated is, I suspect, a function of how the modernist pathology has slowly but inexorably metastasised through my murky mind.\n\nAs a bookish adolescent I sopped up texts as if I were blotting paper and they were fluid. My unstructured absorption of the European canon was only intensified by my refusal to submit to the strictures of a conventional English literature degree course: I never took in the historicist perspective that leads ineluctably from Sweet's Anglo-Saxon Primer, through Spenser and Shakespeare to the robust, door-stopping certainties of Victorian triple-decker novels. Instead, already by the time I lay in that Jericho aquarium, I was a devotee of those works marked by an inability to suspend disbelief in their own formal properties. Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel, Cervantes's Don Quixote, Sterne's Tristram Shandy, Melville's Moby-Dick and Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time – these works spoke paradoxically directly to me in their very sense of indirection. I understood intuitively rather than systematically that all these works were examples of a form we might call \"pre-modernism\", insofar as they anticipated the same existential problems that afflicted Joyce, Woolf, Djuna Barnes, Eliot and other literary modernists to come. That the novel in its inchoate state was more capable of self-questioning experimentation is unsurprising for all sorts of social, cultural and historical reasons, but we can equally ascribe to the writers themselves a sensitivity to what Gabriel Josipovici, in his book What Ever Happened to Modernism?, characterises as an essentially timeless awareness: the simple impossibility of going on, if to go on is to continue with well-established ways of depicting the world in art.\n\nFar from going on, however, I couldn't so much as get going. I might take time here to expatiate on my own lost years; instead, let's give Circe a swerve and fast-forward to the winter of 1986-87 when I found myself living in another damp room, this time in a squat on Haverstock Hill in London. Once again I was lying on a makeshift bed, once again I was reading ferociously – the only real difference was that I was now an unemployed and painfully sober 25-year-old, instead of a pretentious and intoxicated student. I don't mean to imply that I didn't read any naturalistic narrative novels when I was young – I still read some (albeit not many) now. But while I could lose myself for a time in the painstaking tableaux of Dostoevsky's The Idiot, or Stendhal's Red and Black, eventually the mirror of life – adopting Stendhal's own characterisation of art – would begin to be occluded by my own constipated Caliban features.\n\nI felt blocked, unable to see a way to write that wasn't either regressive, or which turned the \"modernist moment\" into an exercise in callow navel-gazing. The man I was living with was a moody and occasionally aggressive Tankie cineaste, who drove an East German Wartburg car. But besides giving me a place to crash, the great service he did me was to introduce me to the novels of Louis-Ferdinand Céline. What Céline's Journey to the End of the Night and Death on Credit did for me – albeit through Ralph Manheim's translations – was to free up my sense of how prose could combine thought and speech into a sort of \"prose libre\", that incorporated both Mandarin and demotic locutions. Céline's increasingly phantasmagorical rants against the 20th century were experienced, by me, as a liberation from those constrictions of the contemporary English novels that I saw being read and exaggeratedly praised all around me – novels that seemed as fusty as Victorian drawing rooms cluttered with over-stuffed furniture, and glass domes beneath which once-fluttering thoughts had been imprisoned.\n\nJosipovici begins his book on modernism by saying that it was precisely this sensation that afflicted him when, in the 1950s, he came to this country to do a master's in English literature, and his tutor suggested some contemporary novelists whose works he should read. For Josipovici – now a distinguished Oxford academic and critic – these works by Angus Wilson, Iris Murdoch et al appeared to have been written in a state of willed ignorance about the fictive innovations of Proust, Joyce and Kafka. The English novelists lauded by the literary establishment had no difficulty in getting on, felt no repugnance from conventions that, to Josipovici, reduced the business of composition to an act of craftsmanship, suggesting as they did that all novels – like all tables – should be endowed with horizontal narrative planes, and supporting legs of an indisputably vertical solidity.\n\nIn the winter of the following year I was living – in slightly more congenial circumstances – a few miles away in Barnsbury, north London. The flat was better-heated, but the chill winds of modernism were still blowing through my mind. I was reading JG Ballard's novels – or, rather, rereading them, because as an adolescent SF fan I had gobbled them up along with Asimov's and Heinlein's, never pausing to consider that Ballard's psychic probe into what he termed \"inner space\" was an altogether more seriously artistic endeavour. But in 1987 I got it: reading especially The Atrocity Exhibition, and then Crash, I was gripped by an unaccustomed sense of traction – I could see a way to get on. It was an experience I hadn't had since, on reading Kafka's Metamorphosis for the first time, aged 16, I had this epiphany: that of all the arts, fiction is the most powerful, since, with no materials other than a pen and paper, a writer can convince a reader that a man has changed into a monstrous vermin.\n\nIn his memoir Miracles of Life, Ballard writes about his own Josipovici- (or Self-)style modernist moment: a prolonged rubbing and itching induced by the old-style corsetry of English fiction in the 1950s. Ballard turned to science fiction – he said – because \"what interested me were the next five minutes\", rather than a simple past to be evoked by the simple past tense. Ballard, who I knew personally, could be a little disingenuous about the extent of his own influences, preferring to be seen – in literary terms, at least – as entirely sui generis, but this is a forgivable foible in a powerfully original writer. Apart from the advanced experimentation of The Atrocity Exhibition, which exhibits elements of the \"cut-up\" and \"fold-in\" methods originated by the Dadaists and channelled into English by William Burroughs and Bryon Gysin, the great majority of Ballard's fiction has altogether traditionally realist formal properties. Indeed, it's the juxtaposition of these hokey characters and straightforward plot lines with the outlandish psychogeographic content of Ballard's fictive inscape that makes the books so profoundly unsettling, and ensures that they have remained surfing the zeitgeist to this day.\n\nMost of all it was Ballard's introduction to the 1973 French edition of Crash that lit a path for me. In it he united his own modernist sensibilities with what he termed \"the death of affect\", a wholesale loss of feeling occasioned by the impact of the atomic bombs that ended the second world war, and then irradiated through the emergent mass communications technologies of the postwar period – in particular TV. It was this, Ballard wrote, that made it impossible any more to suspend disbelief in those omniscient and invisible narrators of naturalistic fictions, whose tendency to play god with their characters had surely always been a function of their own status as personations of God. Burroughs had been another writer whose modernist impulse received a kick-start at Hiroshima – in Ted Morgan's biography Literary Outlaw he describes Burroughs and Kerouac wandering the streets of New York on VJ Day, oblivious to the cheering crowds, and thinking only of how now all writers must follow Aleister Crowley's dictum that anything is permissible. A year or so after my reimmersion in Ballard's oeuvre, while I was commuting to work at a Southwark office from the flat I shared with my first wife in Shepherd's Bush, I began to work seriously on what would become my first published book, the story cycle The Quantity Theory of Insanity.\n\nIn What Ever Happened to Modernism? Josipovici made some intemperate-sounding remarks on the English writers of the half-generation immediately preceding my own. He accused Julian Barnes and Martin Amis – among others – of, inasmuch as they responded to the modernist moment at all, reacting with a degree of puerility that saw them mistaking the graphic depiction of the devilish detail – often gynaecological – for the wholesale abandonment of the possibility of naturalistic verity in the novel that such insights demand. In one of those rare irruptions of high-cultural debate into the British newspapers, Josipovici received his mandated three minutes of fame – after all, the British intelligentsia enjoy shaking the snow globe of their complacency, even if they soon set it to one side again and return to their immemorial ways. But I felt the sting of these remarks – even if they weren't, so far as I know, intended to include my own fictions.\n\nLike Ballard, on the whole I have been content as a novelist and short-story writer to deploy difficult content in lieu of formal experimentation. Like Martin Amis I have mixed a melange of different voices together, believing that the solution would prove corrosive enough to eat away at the English class system. For myself, I have also believed that the fantastical and antic cast of my tales would propel them away from the surly gravity of the conventional, while my own satirical bent would be enough to warp them in the direction of those fabulists – Borges, Poe, Gogol, Kafka – whose writings defy commonplace realism, while perfectly limning the veridical. I can't say that it's been any conscious cravenness that's led to this failure on my part to properly acknowledge how impossible it is to go on, even as I was compelled to do it. True, I do remember that when I submitted my most obviously modernist story \"Scale\" to my then agent he called me up and said he didn't understand it, and was disinclined to submit it to my publisher. (Vindication came in the form of upwards of 100,000 sales in the Penguin 60s edition.) But it wasn't this that held me back, oh no.\n\nIn the early 1990s John Carey published The Intellectuals and the Masses, a clever and calculated attack on the high modernists of the late 19th and early 20th century that sought to smear them as elitists who hated universal literacy – and by extension the universal franchise – to such a degree that it hustled them in some instances into the thorny embrace of fascism. Reading Carey's book at the time, while marvelling at the irony that it had been written on the basis of Carey's TS Eliot Memorial Lectures, and with the acknowledged support of the modernist poet's widow, Valerie, I was also rived by its particular tone: a curiously patrician form of pro-populism. Carey's twitting of the pretensions of the Bloomsbury set verges, at times, on a highbrow version of Daily Mail Little Englanderism, a cast of mind that puts down modernism – and indeed all artistic innovation since the time of Trollope – as the sort of muck you'd expect dirty foreigners to serve up. Josipovici puts Carey in the same class as Barnes and Amis, and damns them all as \"sniggering prep schoolboys\", whose visceral self-disgust masquerading as Olympian world-weariness owes everything to Larkin and nothing to learnin'. But I'm English enough to feel something of a gut-reaction to modernism, to continental philosophising and anything that smacks of a refusal to pay attention to the forensics: the empirical facts on the ground. (\"I refute it thus,\" was how Samuel Johnson responded to philosophical idealism, while kicking a conveniently positioned stone.) I'm also possessed of enough Larkinian self-disgust to have indulged in plenty of puerile sniggering about the body in my fiction. Indeed, my novella Cock – which, come to think of it, must have been written immediately after I read The Intellectuals and the Masses – actually opposed just such bodily revulsion, rendered incarnate, against the experimental pretensions of the novella's own form, as if trying to enact a sort of meta-fictional Socratic dialogue.\n\nBesides, who'd want to be a modernist writer in the English-speaking world? True, the demise of the late David Foster Wallace has been greeted with an exaggerated outburst of chest-beating (often by writers whose own fictions stick doggedly to the well-worn pathways), but I can't help but feel that this has as much to do with his suicide as his prose. (After all, if, as Ballard said, \"For a writer death is always a career move,\" then to be a felo de se is to exit dramatically, and pursued by bears.) No, the dominant school of fiction, still more so in Britain than in the States, remains character-driven and narrative ratcheted, and whatever the changing nature of its cast and content – the underclass of Irvine Welsh, the denizens of Rushdie's fables and those of other postcolonial Booker shoo-ins – it remains unperturbed by the idea that modernity simply cannot be accommodated in such securely cosy forms. To write \"jolly good reads\" with a beginning, a middle and an end – including almost mandatory redemption for a previously morally vacillating protagonist – is the very stuff of books, just as it's the stuff of life on this right, tight little island.\n\nIf I had the time and the space I'd expatiate on the fiendish parallels between this literary anachronism and the anachronism of our political system, and how the shadow play of our public life and the cardboard cut-out of our beloved fictions have an almost exact synchrony, but suffice it to note that the rather more enthusiastic embrace of so-called \"postmodernism\" by the British – in their crap architecture still more than their novels – represents, in my view, a determination to vault over all the quicksand of the 20th century, in order to gain the seemingly safer ground provided by a cut-and-paste job on the styles and modes that antedated it.\n\nFor myself, I haven't been content to carry on producing books that merely strain against the conventions – as I've grown older, and realised that there aren't that many books left for me to write, so I've become determined that they should be the fictive equivalent of ripping the damn corset off altogether and chucking it on the fire. In 2010 I published Walking to Hollywood, a book which exhibited all the continental pretensions we – and I say \"we\" advisedly – instinctively abhor: the incorporation of the writer as a character in his own work, the abandonment of plot, the banjaxing of realism etc etc. Among the British – and the Scots in particular – the critical reception was good, but the sales tanked. If I had been motivated by seeking a readership – in the way Blairite focus groups sought an electorate – then I might have tried to rein back these tendencies in my next novel; instead, I found myself unable to do this. Never before – not even in those cold winter days of the early 80s – have I felt myself to be so at odds with everything, including my own facility with words. In the winter of last year I was staying in a flat in Dartmouth in Devon, which has been lent to me for 20 years now as a writing bolthole. It was bitterly cold, and as I hammered at the keys of the typewriter, I felt a dreadful intractability about the text I was working on – no matter that I had eschewed the simple past and dived into the dangerous waters of the continuous present; no matter that I had struck out from the safe shores of the third-personal to embrace the slippery evanescence of the stream of consciousness, still I felt the corset cutting into me, still I felt mired in convention.\n\nThe results of this cold fictional fusion are now available for you to read – some have read the novel already, and said they liked it. Some of those who liked it have said things such as \"I actually found the characters rather sympathetic, and it's also terribly well plotted …\" at which point an icy dagger has lanced my heart, and I've cried out internally: \"Failed again!\"\n\nWill Self will launch his new book Umbrella at the Southbank Centre on 13 September and curate a series of events on modernism throughout the autumn. He will be appearing at the Edinburgh International Book festival on 25 August."
