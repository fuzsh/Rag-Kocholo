It was kept from the top spot only by The Beatles and their demand for ‘Help!’ The second track on Dylan’s album, ‘Tombstone Blues,’ features more than a dozen named characters, including one who might be William S. Burroughs.\n\nNow I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill\n\nI would set him in chains at the top of a hill\n\nThen send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille\n\nHe could die happily ever after."
