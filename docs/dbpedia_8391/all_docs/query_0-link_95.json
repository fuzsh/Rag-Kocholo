        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nSylvère Lotringer, ed. Burroughs Live: The CollectedInterviews of William S. Burroughs, 1960-1997. Los Angeles: Semiotext(e), 2001. 845p. Lance Rubin Arapahoe Community College Sylvère Lotringer's exhaustive, lively, and endlessly fascinating 800-plus-page BurroughsLive: The CollectedInterviews ofWilliam S. Burroughs, 1960-1997opens with an unconventional editorial decision. Radier than beginning where her title seems to promise, with Burroughs in I960, she includes a never-before-published 1975 radio interview between Charles Ruas and Allen Ginsberg in which the two are talkingaboutBurroughs. In this short piece, Ginsberg, speaking ofBurroughs' influence on him, sets up what is clearly the overriding \"theme\"—ifthere is one— that comes across after reading the remarkable and exhaustive collection: \"It is stupid after all that experience to still be clinging to a notion ofa permanent self, a reliable self, the self feeling terror or present bliss\" (25). Although Ginsberg is referring to the experiences he shared widi Burroughs under the influence ofLSD, the line stays with die reader as Lotringer presents a man whose ideas on life, art, and himselfduring the final decades ofthe twentieth century continuously evolved at the same time diey influenced the literary and cultural evolution ofthose years. As he remarks during a 1972 interview with David Bowie published here, \"Only politicians lay down what diey think and diat is it. Take a man like Hitler, he never changed his mind\" (229). To be sure, some may question the need for yet another book of Burroughs interviews. Allen Hibbard's excellent Conversations with William S. Burroughswas, after all, just published in 1999 and his invaluable 1969 project TheJob with Daniel Odier (which combines interviews with essays and fiction) as well as Victor Brokis' star-studded With William Burroughs: A Report From the Bunker (recently revised in 1996) all are available in most libraries and bookstores and are indispensable to Burroughs studies. However, Lotringer's more varied compilation presents us with a broader range of interviewers writing for a more eclectic range of publications than these other collections. And for those studying Burroughs or the Beats, diis book would seem indispensable; Jaguar, S.F. Horizons , GaySunshine, TheRocket, SearchandDestroy, TheEastVilhgeEye, and Rocky MountainMusicExpress, among many odier lesser known magazines and journals in which Burroughs granted interviews which Lotringer includes here, are not going to be found in university or community libraries. In addition to these less \"academic\" periodicals, Lotringer also transcribes several radio interviews and translates into English a number ofinterviews previously available only in Euro88 * ROCKY MOUNTAIN REVIEW * FALL 2003 Reviews pean publications. Eight ofthe 99 interviews are published here for the first time anywhere. The interviewers—whose knowledge of Burroughs and journalistic agendas vary widely—bring their own concerns with them to the interviews, and Lotringer's collection may have some crossover appeal for students and scholars ofother areas. Included here are Burroughs' conversations with Tennessee Williams ,Timothy Leary, Brion Gysin, musicians such as David Bowie and Devo, and other Beat writers such as Ginsberg and Gregory Corso. Burroughs appears to be comfortable—though at times impatient—conversing on the extensive range of subjects they introduce, from the deadi of his wife, to pornography, addiction, die student protests in the '60s, homosexuality and gay rights, his literary \"cutups ,\" L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology, punk music, science fiction, the Kennedy assassination (he claims Oswald acted alone), Wilhelm Reich's Orgone Box, government , censorship, Oliver North, popular fiction, television, love, overpopulation , suicide, life on other planets, advertising, terrorism, the Ugly Spirit, and cats. Casting awider net than previous collections ofinterviews, Lotringer allows us to see Burroughs from several perspectives as he shares his always fascinating, occasionally hilarious, sometimes contradictory, and often uncannily prophetic thoughts over four decades. For example, his responses to questions about terrorism —\"The only viable weapon for a revolution now are biological and chemical weapons,\" he claimed in a 1973 interview (193)—are absolutely chilling to read after September 1 1th. The bold decision to open with an interview in which Burroughs is not even present is one ofa number ofeditorial decisions with which some may question. Lotringer admits not only to trimming certain interviews but also, in order to make some ofthem read more gracefully, to editing diem, re..."
