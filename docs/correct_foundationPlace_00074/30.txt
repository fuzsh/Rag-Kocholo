The month of May is Asian Heritage Month, honouring the lives and contributions of people of Asian origin.

This year, I would like to talk about one common issue among Asians—speaking up, or the lack thereof.

How often do you stop yourself from saying what needs to be said?

One of the biggest cultural differences that could hold Asians back is our tendency not to speak up. Since I was a kid, my parents and grandparents conditioned us to keep our heads down. Focus on your work, and as long as you do good work, your work will speak for itself.

This is all fine, except that in Western culture, certain behaviours are perceived as the norm. Leaders are expected to be vocal and own the stage.

I have seen firsthand very capable Asian people not getting promoted because they don’t say much. I have seen investors criticizing Asian founders for not having a take-over-the-world demeanour. In one specific example, a founder was having trouble raising capital despite the company doing really well. An existing investor (also Asian) told me privately that the main reason was that this founder didn’t act like a typical American founder.

Ouch! I instantly knew what he meant.

Speaking from my own experience, it took me decades to overcome this issue. I can’t speak for other Asian cultures, but in Hong Kong, during the era when I was growing up, parents would put masking tape on a kid’s mouth if they spoke too much. My parents never did this to me because I rarely said anything. 🙂 Even today, I have to constantly push myself to speak up. On some occasions, I still err on the side of not speaking up enough because it is still very unnatural for me. Your culture stays with you for life.

I can’t tell you exactly how to overcome this issue. To a degree, it has to come from within. You have to find your own way. For me, I kept telling myself I needed to err on the side of speaking up too much. Trust me, even with that, the end result is that on many occasions I still find myself thinking I could have spoken up more, even today. So, imagine if I didn’t give myself a little nudge. It took years of practice to overcome my own emotions. Eventually, I got used to it. Well, most of the time.

However, I don’t mean to say that it is all on Asians’ shoulders to overcome this. Asian or not, great leaders have the responsibility to create a safe environment for everyone to speak up in the first place.

Humility and kindness are great traits in Asian culture. Keep them. It is also okay to push yourself to be more vocal. The barrier is totally breakable, especially one step at a time. You just have to keep pushing. After all, speaking up is not mutually exclusive with your heritage!

In the early 2010s, when Wattpad began raising capital from Silicon Valley, Valley VCs didn’t ask me ‘if’ I would move the company or open a second office there; they asked ‘when.’ They argued that Toronto lacked great product people and scale-up leaders, although we had top engineering talent. At that time, it was common for Valley VCs to ask non-Valley companies to move to the Valley as a condition for funding.

But I told them, ‘I won’t move.’

While their argument had a point, Valley VCs failed to see my “big-fish-small-pond” advantages. I don’t need to hire a million great people. After raising one of the largest funding rounds by a Canadian-based company at the time, I was absolutely sure we could hire “enough” great people to help us build a world-class company based in one of the most populous metropolises in North America called Toronto. Paradoxically, it could even work to our advantage. As one of Toronto’s biggest fish, we could hire the best. I couldn’t say the same thing if we moved to the Valley. Besides, building a company culture with a single office location was much easier.

It was a contrarian bet that few people saw, but it was so obvious to me. In hindsight, it was clear that it was the right call.

It all worked well until it didn’t. While the Toronto ecosystem went from strength to strength during the 2010s, it also meant that the talent competition became very fierce towards the end of the decade. The small pond became a much bigger pond, and there were a lot of big fish in it, including many Valley-based companies setting up shops here.

The tipping point for me was when someone bought the old building next to Wattpad HQ. Initially, we had no idea who wanted to turn it into an office tower until Google announced that it would hire a few thousand people. Where? Right next to Wattpad HQ.

My first-mover advantage has eroded. I had to figure out a new plan to regain my big-fish-small-pond advantage.

My solution was to establish a second HQ in a less populous city with a thriving tech ecosystem and an abundance of post-secondary institutions, where we could be the big fish again and have enough talent to enable us to continue to grow rapidly. It had to be a Canadian city because I wanted a few existing Wattpad employees to relocate there to help us “seed” the culture. It was far harder for me to pull it off if it was cross-border.

I toured around the country. I was impressed by what I saw. There were a handful of cities that met our criteria. I knew we could make it work.

At that time, I was already very familiar with Halifax, having been involved in the local ecosystem for a while. While there, I took advantage of the opportunity to grab dinner with Jevon McDonald, whom I had known for a few years. Nothing compares to talking to a local guru.

Jevon gave me the rundown of all the nuances I couldn’t find on Google search. But when I asked him to name one thing that he didn’t like about Halifax, this was our conversation:

Jevon: “I have a few employees in San Francisco. Going there is very painful as I have to catch a 5am flight to connect through Toronto first.”

Me: “So, there is no direct flight from Halifax to SF?”

“Nope.”

“Great!”

“What?!”

It’s a short flight between Toronto and Halifax. There are numerous daily flights between the two cities, so day trips are super easy. However, the lack of direct flights to the Valley means Valley-based companies won’t show up any time soon. An unfair disadvantage became my unfair advantage. The lack of direct flights became my talent moat.

The rest is history. Wattpad established its second HQ in Halifax. We hired a lot of fantastic people there. I have been the biggest champion of Atlantic Canada ever since, as I have encouraged other Toronto-based companies to do the same.

It was another contrarian bet that few people saw, but it was so obvious to me. It was the right call.

These are just a couple of examples. There were many more that Wattpad did, like establishing a movie studio or investing in something unproven called AI more than a decade ago.

Similarly, some of our best investments in Two Small Fish Ventures, such as Sheertex or BenchSci, had a very tough time raising capital early on because very few people saw what we saw.

Of course, I am not suggesting that one should be contrarian for the sake of being contrarian. But when a contrarian bet results in a first-mover advantage in a big opportunity that no one else saw, that will almost always generate an amazing outcome with outsized returns.

Don’t tell anyone.

When Eva and I were on stage yesterday at Entrepreneurship Week at the University of Toronto, moderator Bianca Bharti from BetaKit asked us:

“Given we are celebrating women and raising awareness about related issues this week, what do you want to tell the audience here today?”

Here is what I said. When I was Wattpad’s CEO, we didn’t just talk about diversity or run flashy programs just to make us look good. Instead, we invested in it. We allocated real resources, dollars, and people’s time to create a truly diverse and inclusive culture at Wattpad.

The business reason was simple – half the world’s population is female. If we want to properly capture this market, do you really think a bunch of male guys in the room can figure this out?

The end result is that we achieved gender parity at BOTH the employee level and the leadership team level. However, the numbers don’t tell the whole story. Anyone who worked for Wattpad can testify that we have created a truly inclusive culture.

Personally, I would consider this one of our biggest achievements.

But that was only the first chapter of the story. At Two Small Fish Ventures, we carry the same DNA. It was mostly Eva’s work, as I only started to be more involved in recent years. Through inspiration, advocacy, and mentorship, we achieved 50% female founders in our portfolio. In fact, many of our rocket ships are female-led.

Our job is not done yet. Together, we can change how the world operates.

One of the three things that CEOs only do is to “make sure there is enough cash in the bank” (see job #3 here). Although CFOs may be responsible for much of the heavy lifting, keep in mind that CEOs’ job #1 is to communicate vision and strategies to all stakeholders, which certainly includes potential and existing investors. It is very hard to raise capital to build a great company without great storytelling skills, something almost all great CEOs possess.

Clearly communicating a bold vision is especially important for early-stage venture-backed companies. These companies are usually pre-revenue, pre-product-market-fit, and definitely pre-scaling. From the VCs’ perspective, they invest not only in where the company is today, but also where the company would be, could be, and should be. In many cases, investors buy into the company’s second, third, and fourth acts in the future, as very few great companies are one-trick ponies.

SRTX is the perfect example. Last week, we went to the grand opening of their mega-factory in Montreal. To my knowledge, it is now the largest textile factory in Canada. The pictures and videos don’t do justice to the massive scale of this facility.

This is especially impressive when you know that 180 days ago, when they took over the facility, the roof was leaking, there were no walls, and there was no electricity. The SRTX team moved mountains, rock by rock and at lightning speed, to get the factory ready for production.

I wish I could share some pictures inside the factory. Unfortunately, I can’t share their secret sauce. If you really want to have an insider view, you have to become an investor 😉

It took 7 years from its inception for SRTX to begin evolving into a fully verticalized behemoth through innovations in advanced material, hardware, and software to deliver traceability, sustainability, durability, and cost advantages, which is now giving them an “unbreakable” advantage – pun fully intended!

Today, millions of Sheertex unbreakable pantyhose are sold. They became THE best-selling pantyhose, unbreakable or otherwise, in North America, not bad for a 15-person company based in Bracebridge, Ontario, a town with a 15,000 population and a 2-hour drive north of Toronto when Two Small Fish Ventures invested!

Now, they are ready to license the IPs of their rip-resistant technology to other textile companies. That’s their second act. Watertex, one of the world’s most hydrophobic polymers that is engineered for unparalleled water resistance for use in, say, swimwear, is their third act. There are other IPs that are in the works. I would call them their fourth act.

But please don’t use the word pivot here. Pivot implies ‘nothing works, let’s try something else.’ Since the early days, Katherine was very clear that selling pantyhose online was the necessary first act to give her the economy of scale before she could begin her second act, third act, and fourth act. What we see today is exactly how she articulated her bold vision when we invested in the seed round five years ago. We bought into her vision, joined the journey, and now, what she told us is becoming a reality. We wouldn’t have invested in a company that was merely selling pantyhose online, even if millions were being sold.

The power couple, Katherine Homuth and Zak Homuth, are not your typical founders. SRTX is rewriting the rules of textiles through innovations. I can’t wait to watch the second, third, and fourth acts unfold right before our eyes from my front-row seat.

I wrote 80% of this post a while ago, but the slew of companies making CEO changes (e.g., check out this list from Betakit: Canadian Tech Companies Making Executive Leadership Changes) prompted me to finish it.

Silicon Valley’s founder CEO worship definitely has its merits. As a CEO backed by many valley VCs, I have immersed myself in that view for decades (e.g., Ben Horowitz’s Why We Prefer Founding CEOs). I get it, I understand where it comes from, and I do mostly agree. That’s why TSFV backs founding CEOs almost 100% exclusively.

Great founding CEOs tend to have all three traits: 1) Comprehensive knowledge of the entire company (including knowledge of every employee, product, technology decision, customer data, and the strengths and weaknesses of both the code base and the organization), 2) moral authority, and 3) total commitment to the long-term, while professional CEOs often don’t.

On the other hand, being a great CEO is more than just starting a company. It’s a super stressful job that nobody can learn overnight, and it’s definitely a different ball game than being a founding CEO of a five-person company. However, founders who can’t scale with the company can’t stay in the captain’s chair forever.

If the two jobs are so different, why do we still prefer founding CEOs, even though many are learning on the job? Because it gives the company the best chance to become ultra-successful.

Typically, a company goes through four stages of growth. I call it the “4S’s”:

Start: where everything begins, with just the co-founders and a tiny team.

Sprout: achieving product-market fit, with the CEO calling most of the shots in a mostly informal setting.

Scale: rapid growth, hiring functional leaders, building depth, and starting to establish business processes. This is often where founder CEOs, especially first-time founder CEOs, stumble as they might lack experience in hiring and leading large teams.

Success: achieving a major milestone like an IPO or a massive liquidity event.

But the growth of a company isn’t a waterfall. An innovation company can’t stop innovating once its (first!) product has achieved product-market fit and cannot simply switch gears overnight to focus on business optimization. The most successful companies aren’t one-trick ponies; they need second and third acts long after their first product takes off.

Based on my own experience and my observation of hundreds of CEOs’ personal growth, I can confidently say that it’s far easier for a founding CEO to learn leadership than for a professional hire to become innovative and visionary. When the company hits scale-up mode, a founding CEO’s leadership needs to be solid, but any gaps can be filled by hiring strong leaders. Most founders can successfully make this jump.

On the flip side, pushing someone to be innovative and visionary is much harder, as is finding a team of leaders who can fill that gap for a professional CEO. That’s why it’s tougher for professional CEOs to succeed, though it’s not impossible. It is also possible to hire an “entrepreneurial” professional CEO, although they are rare gems.

However, this is all pretty generalized. Generalization tends to default to pattern recognition without thoughtful consideration of the specificity of the company’s situation. The ideal scenario is a founding CEO leading all the way, but sometimes, if a professional CEO is the only option, that’s what we have to work with.

The good news for TSFV’s portfolio CEOs is that you’ve got a founding CEO who’s been through it all – me! These days, I spend a lot of time helping founding CEOs fast-track their learning to operate more effectively on the job. For our professional CEOs, I offer guidance to help them think and act more like founders. Helping our portfolio CEOs is the best use of my time to ensure our portfolio companies’ success. It is also extremely high-leveraged because sometimes, even a 30-minute conversation with me can help change the trajectory of a company. After all, if our CEOs aren’t successful, it’s nearly impossible for our portfolio companies to be successful, isn’t it?

As a refresher, a CEO does only three things:

Sets the overall vision and strategy of the company and communicates it to all stakeholders.

Recruits, hires, and retains the very best talent for the company.

Ensures there is always enough cash in the bank.

These responsibilities might seem straightforward, but they encompass a vast array of tasks and decisions.

For instance, ensuring there is always enough cash in the bank could imply that a CEO needs to double as a CFO, but clearly, CEOs should not be CFOs. Similarly, hiring the very best talent could include all people functions, but of course, it should not.

In other words, even with just three things, CEOs will never run out of things to do. So how should they prioritize?

One guiding principle is that CEOs should only do things that they can uniquely do. Let someone else take care of the heavy lifting.

When Wattpad started to scale, this mindset shift really helped me prioritize. This problem is much more common than you may think. Based on my observations, I would even say that at some point, most inexperienced CEOs spend too little time on things that they can uniquely do. Failing to do so, the problem could manifest itself as people in the company chronically waiting on you before they can take their next actions on projects. You lose all the leverage you have in hiring a team.

You already paid them so much money to do the job for you. Don’t do their job for them!!!!

Although this lesson is mostly for CEOs, the same principle also applies to other leaders and managers. There is a bucket called ‘only you can do.’ Note that this bucket is not called ‘I can do it better‘ because who can do a better job or who can do it faster is not the issue here. Resisting the temptation to take on a task when your team can (should!) handle it can greatly help you improve your productivity and turn you into a much more effective leader.

I’m a 3x entrepreneur. I was the CTO of my first company, which failed. I was the CEO of my second one, which was acquired when it was still very tiny.

Wattpad was my third and last company, but it was my first one as a scale-up CEO. It was a very different beast. The learning curve for me was extremely steep.

Thankfully, I was very privileged to have many world-class VCs and their firms invested in Wattpad. Being surrounded by world-class investors and their network not only helped me surmount that learning curve but also helped TSFV become a much better VC firm. More on that in a different post.

One of these firms is Union Square Ventures. The first and most important thing I learned from USV’s Fred Wilson is, “What does a CEO do?”

A CEO does only three things:

Sets the overall vision and strategy of the company and communicates it to all stakeholders.

Recruits, hires, and retains the very best talent for the company.

Ensures there is always enough cash in the bank.

A CEO should delegate all other tasks to his or her team.

In my experience, it’s rare to find great CEOs and consequently, great companies, not getting these three things right. Conversely, dysfunctional companies usually get at least one of these three things really wrong.

I frequently talked about these three things with my team at Wattpad. My leadership team and all the employees knew what to expect and could hold me accountable. And they did.

So much is packed into these three things. They are deceptively simple, and yet they are extremely nuanced. There’s enough material here for a book! So, expect multiple blog posts in the future on this topic.

However, this post alone is already a great guiding post for any CEO whose company has achieved (or is beyond) product-market fit, or the team is ready to scale, say, roughly 10 people, and even for companies of much larger size.

This post is the foundation of CEOs’ leadership, and everything flows from here. I learned it, I lived it, and I can testify that this is the first thing that any CEO must get right and keep getting right throughout their tenure.

And that’s precisely why this is the inaugural post in the Two Small Fish Ventures Masterclass Series.

One of the most unusual practices I used as CEO was writing an internal blog called “Allen’s Thoughts” on Wattpad every day. My preferred form of communication is the written word, a key reason behind co-founding Wattpad.

Although it might sound time-consuming – and it is – blogging helped me tremendously in clarifying my thinking. More importantly, context matters. The 30-60 minutes I spent each day aligned and interacted with hundreds of employees, arguably making it the most effective activity in terms of leveraging time. Here’s what I explained on Allen’s Thoughts about why I needed to do this:

“Wattpad is an incredibly complex company. We are a tech company, a media company, a book publisher, an advertising company, an influencer network, an AI company, a movie studio, a social network, a community, and also an entertainment company that makes people happy.

What links us together is our common vision, mission, values, and culture. Allen’s Thoughts is less about the numbers and company updates, which you can get on Slack, email, Google Docs, or other channels. This blog is more about sharing the context, the whys, and the intangibles in a narrative that helps you navigate that complexity so that you can make the best possible decisions and do your best job.

This blog is one of my unique superpowers that connects everyone.”

I started Allen’s Thoughts in 2013 and stopped daily blogging after stepping down in May 2022. My final post, “IT’S THE FINAL CURTAIN CALL. A NEW STORY BEGINS,” was shared publicly on allensthoughts.com.

Do I miss it? Absolutely, yes. However, after writing half a million words, I became too mentally exhausted.

After a long break, I am fully recharged and ready to reactivate my public blog. Although the Wattpad story is well-documented, many challenges and triumphs weren’t shared externally. These backstories are valuable case studies in business, leadership, entrepreneurship, venture capital and even time management. Re-reading my old posts, I realized they are a startup treasure trove, offering insights from scaling from two co-founders to a scaleup with hundreds of employees and 100 million users. I plan to share these lessons, along with many new topics.

Of course, I will also share my perspective on the startup investment landscape, our investment thesis, and our areas of focus – i.e., AI, protocols, and sustainable computing – among other topics.

This material will be part of our “School of Fish” Masterclass Series, more on this later.

I don’t plan to write daily. Frequency is not the most important aspect; it’s more about when inspiration strikes. My goal is to share high-quality, high-leverage, and impactful content. I will use Allen Thoughts to think things through “in public,” writing for my own enjoyment and hoping it benefits many others. After a hiatus, I’m eager, hungry, and excited to do it again!

The stories behind this picture we took in Muskoka a few weeks ago captured four incredible world-dominating startups.

From left to right: Sally Daub, Zak Homuth, Katherine Homuth, Eva Lau, Allen Lau, Dennis Bennie

Eva and I started our careers at Delrina in the ’90s. Delrina was a fledgling startup with a modest team of just over 20 when she joined. When I joined nine months later, it reached nearly 100 people. Less than four years later, when Dennis Bennie, the CEO and co-founder, brokered a half-a-billion-dollar deal with Symantec, the company employed just under 800 people and became one of the world’s top 10 PC software companies. With over 90% of the market share, Delrina’s products were so dominant that we crushed all our competitors. Truly legendary.

Post-acquisition, Eva went to work for ATI, where she crossed paths with Sally Daub, then served as its General Counsel. ATI and its chief rival Nvidia emerged as the two world’s leading graphics chip players. In 2006, ATI was acquired by AMD for $5.4 billion. The transaction is one of the largest Canadian tech acquisitions. Probably still in the top three to date.

I’ll be succinct about Wattpad—it’s a story many are familiar with. We pioneered mobile reading, user-generated fiction, AI-and-audience-backed movies and many areas that resulted in billions of story uploads in over 50 languages, numerous world’s most-watched movies and 100 million users in virtually every corner of this planet.

Katherine and Zak Homuth’s Sheertex needs no introduction. In seven short years since its founding in Muskoka, the company became a world-famous household name and synonymous with unbreakable pantyhose. Three years ago, it took over the largest hosiery factory in Canada. To keep up with the demand, it is now moving into a space in Montreal three times larger. There is still so much headroom for growth.

These four Canadian companies are all world-dominating category creators.

As a passenger on the rocket ship, being the captain of the rocket ship and funding the rocket ship are three different skills. And yet, they’re intertwined, each amplifying the other. If you have never been on a rocket ship, it would be hard to imagine what a rocket ship looks like and spot the next one.

Eva and I have been immensely fortunate to wear multiple hats as employees, founders, and investors in many rocket ships. The timeless adage rings true: Surround yourself with the best. If you aim to be the best, work for the best and work with the best will help you learn from the best.
