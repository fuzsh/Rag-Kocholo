        "text": "A Series of Forbes Insights Profiles of Thought Leaders Changing the Business Landscape: Larry Levy, Founder and CEO, Appinions...\n\nContent marketing is a booming business as marketers act to fill their social media, mobile and web channels. In fact, marketers will spend some 25% of their budgets creating content, accounting for $4 billion in spending. Appinions is a SaaS based platform that sits at the intersection of social media and technology. Founded by serial entrepreneur Larry Levy, Appinions is built on research from Cornell University. The platform processes the full-text from over 3 million offline, online, and social sources to help marketers figure out what to say in terms of content creation that will generate the most impact amongst key influencers and provides the tools and analytics to measure its value.\n\n“This all started in 2007. I'd just sold a previous company and saw this massive influx of content from brands, from newspapers, onto the web. Over the course of just six months I saw that the number of pages online went from 6 billion to 22 billion, and I thought that with this exponential growth of data and information flowing online that keyword search alone was just not going to cut it. Coming out of the semantic web business that I'd known so well, I looked at this and came up with this hypothesis that if I could filter all of the discussions that were going onto the web based on people's thoughts, feelings and statements, then I was giving a different slice, a different filter on the web, and steering clear of data with facts and dealing with much richer, colorful opinions,” says Levy.\n\nLevy’s journey to test this hypothesis took him to Cornell and to Claire Cardie, who was the professor of computer science that was in charge of the research where they were actually doing this kind of work. Professor Cardie had spent a decade trying to figure this problem out. “I'd also been involved with the National Science Foundation and was one of the panelists for their SBIR grant process. So I knew some of the best colleges that were producing great work in this area. I put a team onto doing the research to find me people that were pulling together the best innovation in and around this area. That's how I got to Cornell,” says Levy.\n\nGetting Professor Cardie and Cornell on board with Levy’s idea for a business venture was no simple matter. “First time round, Claire basically told me to take a hike. She was very comfortable with her life in academia. It took a couple of goes around, including me driving up in a snowstorm to Ithaca to go and speak to her. I started speaking to her about anaphora resolution and semiformal ontologies and disambiguation, and once she heard that I actually knew technically a lot about the space and the science, she just opened up. We just decided pretty much there and then that this was probably going to be a good thing, let's give it a whirl,” says Levy. With Cardie on board, he then had to cut a deal with the Cornell University technology transfer office for an exclusive license.\n\nOnce the team was in place, he began focusing the company’s efforts on building a system designed to help institutional investors better understand investor sentiment as a planning tool. He personally funded the first 18 months of the operations, worked to get the platform and code ready to go. Then his two most interested companies Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers both imploded with the global financial melt-down of 2008-2009.\n\n“We went back to the drawing board, opened up the API and basically said ‘I don't know what's going to pop out of 2010, but whatever does, let's just be ready.’ We then started really focusing on this idea that if we can find the most interesting discussions, find the most interesting people, who and when they speak or write about this issue, who really get a lot of attention and reaction, then that became definitely a marketing problem that we'd solved. And so we aimed the whole thing at marketing” says Levy of the company’s pivot from investing tool to marketing. As luck would have it, influencer marketing and content marketing were all starting to come into focus as real disciplines with increasing interest and expanding budgets from the marketing community. Today the company is growing on average 35 percent quarter on quarter and has done so for the last 5 quarters and is building true scale to the business. So far, Levy has not sought out venture capital to fund the growth of the business and has relied solely on angel investors.\n\n“The next stage of growth for us is coming from this explosion of companies who are turning towards content marketing to get the attention of prospects and drive their sales pipelines. Especially in B2B, the resources are there for content initiatives, but managers and practitioners are living with a lot of day-to-day guesswork. Appinions gives them a data-driven solution that clarifies the process of planning, execution, and measurement. It’s easier for CMO’s to be comfortable with their big new content investment when data is driving strategy and tactics. For us providing that data is a billion-dollar opportunity,” says Levy.\n\nLevy’s journey to successful entrepreneur and content marketing technology pioneer is not the typical route. “I grew up in a little town in South Africa called Springs. It's about 40 minutes drive out of Johannesburg, and it's on what's called the East Rand, which is where all the gold mines are. Our favorite hobby was taking dirt bikes and riding them up these 200, 300 foot mine docks,” says Levy.\n\nHe was born into what he refers to as “tough love” way of training. His father was a shop keeper and entrepreneur of sorts himself. Levy worked in the shop from a very early age. “If somebody walked in and the cash register didn’t ring by the time they walked out, I used to get pay docked as a result. So it didn’t matter if I sold the guy a hankie, a pair of socks, or one shoe, but if that cash register didn’t ring, then I was on the hook,” continues Levy on how he learned about human nature and the art of selling.\n\nHe studied accounting and is a chartered accountant, but decided he did not want to be an accountant for the rest of his life. He married his British born girlfriend, left South Africa to travel through Europe and eventually got a work permit for the UK and wound up in London. “We wound up in this pokey little dive, which didn’t have a TV and three months later she was pregnant. We had to figure out whether we went back to South Africa (pre Mandela release days), or we had this baby in London with literally existing from hand to mouth. We decided to stay in London and I then landed my first entrepreneurial job with a Canadian company called Delrina which had an interesting product called WinFax,” says Levy.\n\nHe started the European business and in three years captured 80 percent of the fax market. The business was sold in 1995 to Symantec. Levy left Symantec after the sale and started a company called Protégé which focused on internet-based companies and to help them build up their presence in Europe, and decided to ask them for stock as his compensation, based on the strike price at the time of the deal. “It ended up being an amazing business with an unbelievable business model, until the beginning of 2000. When that internet bubble popped, I had 300 people and a $2 million a month in burn, and life was not good,” says Levy.\n\nAfter the crash and the humbling of his business, he managed to salvage a business called Semagie in 2001, which was based on technology in the semantic web space out of the University of Georgia that allowed you to see people’s connections on the Web long before Linkedin or Facebook. That business was consolidating very quickly and so he sold it to Warburg Pincus and spent nine months helping them with the integration. “That’s when I started working on this idea that with the explosion of data on the web there would be value in being able to measure all of the opinions people were sharing, the influence they were displaying, and the attention it was generating. Once I had that realization, I went to work.“ says Levy of his journey to the founding of Appinions."
