We are honored and grateful that you have chosen `{`us`}` to support us in our mission to foster stability and resiliency, and provide a safety net for performing arts and entertainment professionals over their lifespan.\n\nI am writing to say a Giant Thank You to everyone at the Foundation for awarding my daughter Jaylee Baldo the scholarship for this past season ...THANK YOU so much for affording my daughter the same opportunity as everyone else to continue to grow under one of the best dance instructors out there. Not only is Miss Debbie a great teacher, but she is also a great friend & mentor towards my daughter as well as our entire family.\n\nI wanted to thank you and the Tana Quigley Foundation for yet another wonderful donation. The ShopRite gifts cards come in handy in helping to provide food to our residents placed in Hotels, due to Covid-19.

From the pack and play cribs, to the sheets and blankets, the refrigerator and now the gift cards, every item donated is truly appreciated. While the COVID-19 Pandemic has had a catastrophic impact worldwide, it has also taken a massive toll on victims of Domestic Violence in our communities. . The items donated are used on a daily basis and help give our residents some comforts of “Home” while they are virtually “Homeless. We truly appreciate your support during these trying and difficult times."
