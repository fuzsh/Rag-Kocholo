We will return to our proceeding 7 now. 8 9896 Madam Secretary. 9 9897 MS BÃNARD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 10 9898 The first presentation will be by 11 CATAAlliance, Mr. David Paterson. 12 9899 THE CHAIRPERSON: Good morning, Mr. 13 Paterson. 14 PRESENTATION / PRÃSENTATION 15 9900 MR. PATERSON: Good morning, Mr. 16 Chairman, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for the 17 opportunity to make our presentation here this morning. 18 9901 The CATAAlliance has more than 1,000 19 members, in all aspects of the high-tech sector. Most 20 are in information technology and communications, but 21 biotechnology, aerospace, and advanced manufacturing 22 technology are also well represented. We do not 23 believe that we have a single member who does not use 24 the Internet in some aspect of their business. 25 Internet use ranges from simple e-mail through Web StenoTran 2309 1 sites, to products and services which are totally 2 dependent on the growth of the net for their success. 3 All of our members will be affected if the CRTC takes 4 any steps which in any way handicap their use of the 5 net. Rather than address the concerns of particular 6 Internet players, we wish to present the views of the 7 broad range of industries which CATA represents. 8 9902 The scope of this proceeding extends 9 well beyond the CRTC's traditional purview. The 10 Internet is a global phenomenon, not Canadian. It is 11 not broadcasting, it is an entirely new way of 12 communicating. It affects the entire economy, not just 13 the broadcasting industry and its suppliers. It is 14 evolving at tremendous speed. A previous intervenor 15 suggested that a new vocabulary is needed, that the old 16 one does not serve when discussing the net. We agree 17 entirely. Attempting to apply the terminology of the 18 old media to the new ones will only lead to problems. 19 Even apparently simple concepts like time are different 20 on the Internet. Time is measured in Webyears, which 21 are only two or three calendar months long. 22 9903 CATA members' initial response when 23 these proceedings were announced in July was to express 24 extreme concern that the CRTC wanted to regulate the 25 Internet. They view regulation as something which StenoTran 2310 1 would be extremely damaging to Canada's position in the 2 burgeoning world of the global Internet. Anything 3 which interferes with the pace of technological change, 4 prescribes Canadian content, or raises costs handicaps 5 Canada in the race for success on the Internet. We are 6 grateful that the CRTC has addressed the implications 7 of the new media through this open forum, which allows 8 intervention by concerned parties from all sectors of 9 the economy. 10 9904 As a first principle, CATA members 11 question the need for CRTC intervention. They do not 12 perceive any shortage of Canadian content on the net. 13 There are hundreds of sites offering Canadian content 14 and products of all kinds. Many of these products are 15 regarded as world leaders, the best in their class. 16 Access is not a problem, as Web sites are easy for a 17 content provider to establish. Success is dependent on 18 the creativity of the provider, on the attractiveness 19 of their product to the consumer. 20 9905 Some content providers report that it 21 is difficult to finance development of new media 22 content. The situation resembles that of the software 23 industry a decade ago. There is a learning curve in 24 investment, as in all professions. Until investors 25 become sufficiently familiar with the dynamics of a new StenoTran 2311 1 business, it is hard to raise money. Once that 2 happens, money begins to flow, to sound management 3 teams backing business plans that promise a solid 4 return to investors. The Canadian software industry is 5 now awash with money. Providing public funding is not 6 a panacea, it will not confer success on content for 7 which there is only a tiny market. As Dennis Bennie, 8 the co-founder of Delrina, has pointed out, \"There are 9 thousands of great ideas, but only a few great 10 companies.\" 11 9906 Our members' greatest fear is that 12 the CRTC will decide to tax the Internet. Content 13 providers have suggested a scheme similar to that which 14 prevails in broadcasting, a 5 per cent tax on ISPs' 15 revenues which would go into a fund for the development 16 of Canadian content. That would raise the cost of 17 access for everyone doing business on the net. The 18 current taxes on broadcasting affect only a small 19 fraction of Canadian companies. A tax on the Internet 20 will affect the fastest growing part of the economy. 21 It will be a further competitive handicap, atop the 22 higher communications charges Canadian users face, 23 compared to their American competition. There are 24 already several government programs to fund new media 25 development, most prominently the $30 million StenoTran 2312 1 Multimedia Fund launched by Heritage Minister Copps in 2 June. The need for further support from an Internet 3 tax is not obvious. 4 9907 It would also contradict government 5 policy. In a speech at ITAC SOFTWORLD '98 in 6 September, the Prime Minister said, \"A revenue neutral 7 taxation regime will ensure that you are not taxed 8 twice.\" On September 29, Revenue Minister Dhaliwal, in 9 responding to his Advisory Committee on Electronic 10 Commerce, said, \"We're not interested in creating new 11 taxes that will create new barriers for electronic 12 commerce.\" To protect the integrity of the existing 13 tax system and ensure full compliance, four technical 14 advisory groups have been established to assist the 15 Minister. Canada will also consult other countries, so 16 that Canadian tax policy harmonizes with policies 17 around the world. 18 9908 There are a host of practical 19 questions about regulating the Internet. One is simply 20 whether it is technically feasible to apply Canadian 21 regulations to a global system. The other is speed, as 22 the Web evolves at warp speed. Between the 23 announcement of these proceedings at the end of July 24 and the presentation of your report in April, three 25 Webyears will have elapsed. Regulating anything that StenoTran 2313 1 moves that fast appears beyond the resources of any 2 organization. 3 9909 CATAlliance's key concern is the 4 potential impact of CRTC regulations on electronic 5 commerce. We are all familiar with the forecasts of 6 phenomenal growth for e-comm. IDC predicts that global 7 electronic commerce will grow from U.S. $33.5 billion 8 in 1998 to U.S. $435 billion in 2002. The Gartner 9 Group reports that 70 per cent of Internet traffic is 10 business to business. Canadian businesses are anxious 11 to participate in that growth. Several of the leaders 12 in e-comm are Canadian. Canada has an export driven 13 economy. Among our members, it is not unusual for more 14 than 90 per cent of revenues to come from foreign 15 markets. Internet taxes and regulations which places 16 Canadians at a competitive disadvantage in global 17 e-comm will slow the growth of the entire economy. 18 9910 While the CRTC is examining the 19 situation of new media in Canada, many countries have 20 set out to attract Internet businesses to their shores. 21 Ireland, Bermuda, The Bahamas and Barbados have been 22 cited by previous intervenors during your hearing. The 23 United States, the leader of the Internet, has a 24 natural attraction for Web businesses. Any obstacles 25 placed in the paths of Canadian new media businesses StenoTran 2314 1 will make these venues more attractive. They will 2 divert creativity, investment and employment away from 3 Canada. A Web site can be moved with a click of a 4 mouse and the impact is not trivial. The Gartner Group 5 reports that the cost of a passive Web site is U.S. 6 $3,600 to $7,200 per year, basic e-comm Web sites U.S. 7 $40,000 to $96,000, and full blown transaction 8 processing sites U.S. $200,000 and up. E-comm can 9 create many jobs. 10 9911 I know of a Web site which was 11 recently moved from Vancouver to Bellingham, 12 Washington. Many intervenors have cited other 13 examples. While some policy analysts dismiss such 14 reports as anecdotal, statistically invalid. In the 15 world of Webyears, by the time a statistically 16 significant longitudinal series of anecdotes is 17 compiled, the game is over, and it is too late to 18 correct the problem. 19 9912 In your deliberations you must never 20 forget that any action representing the Internet will 21 affect the entire economy, not just the broadcasting 22 business. Phenomenal growth is forecast for the 23 Internet and electronic commerce. Canadian businesses 24 of all kinds are positioning themselves to seize a 25 share of that growth. To do so, they must have a level StenoTran 2315 1 playing field. Taxes or regulations which handicap 2 Canadian businesses on the Internet will reach far 3 beyond the CRTC's traditional constituency. They will 4 affect almost all parts of the economy. Jobs and 5 investment will flow to other countries. It is 6 essential that the CRTC lift the cloud of uncertainty 7 that has formed since these proceedings were announced. 8 It must be made clear that nothing will be done which 9 will damage the competitive position of the Canadian 10 industry. 11 9913 The Prime Minister announced the 12 Canadian Electronic Commerce Strategy on September 22. 13 Its objective is: \"For Canada to be a world leader in 14 the development and use of electronic commerce by the 15 year 2000.\" We respectfully submit that the CRTC can 16 support this objective by accepting the advice of many 17 of the intervenors who have appeared here, and 18 concluding that regulation of the Internet is beyond 19 the scope of the Broadcasting and Telecommunications 20 Acts. Thank you. 21 9914 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you, Mr. 22 Paterson. 23 9915 I will turn the questioning to 24 Commissioner Grauer. 25 9916 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: Thank you, Mr. StenoTran 2316 1 Chairman. 2 9917 Since you have made your views very 3 known with respect to the role of the CRTC and the 4 jurisdiction of the Broadcasting Act with respect to 5 the Internet I don't need any questions of 6 clarification there. So, in not using our time going 7 through those things, it's not a lack of interest on 8 our part, but your views are on the record and well 9 known. I am very interested in exploring some other 10 areas in your submission. 11 9918 Could you give me an idea of who some 12 of your members might be, just so I have a larger and 13 smaller? 14 9919 MR. PATERSON: The largest members 15 are IBM, Bombardier, Pratt & Whitney. It extends 16 through -- well, you could no longer classify 17 Newbridge, of course, as a medium-size company. But it 18 extends across the information technology sector 19 through newer companies, like Entrust Technologies. 20 The ones that are of particular interest in the e-comm 21 business, for example, are Entrust Technologies, 22 Impacta Media in Montreal and then it goes on 23 through -- down to we have a newly formed effort to 24 attract people in the SOHO business, the small 25 office/home office, the individual practitioners, which StenoTran 2317 1 is building up at a rapid pace. 2 9920 All of these people, without 3 exception, are users of the net in their business. 4 9921 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: We have heard 5 from some. IBM was here last week and made a 6 presentation to us. 7 9922 Just so you understand, part of what 8 we are doing in this proceeding as our Chair Colville 9 said on the opening day, is that we also need to be 10 looking at how the Internet will impact on traditional 11 broadcasting and telecommunications, so that we have a 12 sense of how to monitor those developments. 13 9923 Secondly, in having a public forum, 14 we will be looking at recommendations we can be making 15 to government in ways that they can also be helping in 16 the development and support of these new emerging 17 businesses. So that's the framework in which I would 18 like to pursue some questions. 19 9924 One of the things that IBM talked 20 about when they were here is they referred to a Boston 21 consulting group report on e-commerce. The Boston 22 consulting group was not able to include Canadian 23 transactions or e-commerce in their report because 24 there isn't enough activity taking place here. 25 9925 Now, I know you have referred to the StenoTran 2318 1 size of the e-commerce market in the United States or 2 the total of it I guess by OECD estimates, and then you 3 refer to high broadband costs already handicapping 4 Canadian industry, on the second page of your report. 5 9926 So, I have two questions. First, do 6 you have any explanation for why Canada is lagging the 7 U.S. in the development of e-commerce, and if you think 8 the high broadband costs might have anything to do with 9 it? 10 9927 MR. PATERSON: Basically, I believe 11 that the reason that Canada has lagged behind the 12 United States, there are areas in the economy where we 13 are ahead. There are, unfortunately, much broader 14 areas where we are behind. 15 9928 The banking industry, the financial 16 industry in Canada has a very highly regarded position 17 in the world of e-commerce. The Canadian banks have 18 made much more progress in the use of the net than 19 their American counterparts have. 20 9929 In the broader area of business to 21 consumer Internet activity, we have definitely lagged 22 behind. There are not the attractive Web sites, there 23 are not the efficient business models in Canada that 24 there are in the United States and it's hard to explain 25 that, except I think in the context that we have -- StenoTran 2319 1 Canada has often lagged behind the United States in new 2 retailing ideas. 3 9930 I can't picture this happening in the 4 United States either, but a lady who was interested in 5 collecting Pez packages started a company called E-Bay, 6 which has just exploded. It is this sort of an 7 imaginative thing where the Americans tend to be a 8 little bit ahead of us and that I think is the 9 explanation for that. 10 9931 On the question of the higher costs, 11 it has been identified to me as the reason why Canadian 12 Web sites -- Canadian companies operate Web sites in 13 the United States. It's simply cheaper to do it down 14 there. 15 9932 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: I see. 16 9933 MR. PATERSON: The example -- the 17 Vancouver example which I quoted, the site was moved to 18 Bellingham because the broadband communications was 19 available down there. 20 9934 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: So it was 21 directly related to the cost of the broadband 22 facilities? 23 9935 MR. PATERSON: Right. 24 9936 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: We have had 25 some suggestions, in fact from some of the large ISPs, StenoTran 2320 1 U-Net, Internet Direct, the ISP Group I think they call 2 themselves, and others that we should look at -- I 3 don't know how familiar you are with the 4 tele-communications regulations, but that we might 5 allow ISPs access to unbundled loop rates and 6 co-location. 7 0920 8 9937 They have argued that in fact their 9 inability to access these networks the last mile has 10 really inhibited -- has kept the costs high and has 11 inhibited the development and application of 12 technologies, fax, Internet, telephony and some other 13 products which might in fact really contribute to the 14 further development of e-commerce. 15 9938 I am just wondering if you have any 16 comments on that. 17 9939 MR. PATERSON: I am not intimately 18 familiar with the telecom's regulations and I don't 19 believe I am qualified to answer that sort of question. 20 9940 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: Okay. I think 21 you are the first that has told us that the Canadian 22 software industry is now awash with money. I am 23 interested in that and I appreciate your point on 24 public funding. 25 9941 We have had many recommendations here StenoTran 2321 1 which talked about broadening the existing tax 2 incentives, stimulating R&D and encouraging investment 3 in Canadian new media companies. 4 9942 We heard from IMAT, we heard from 5 Torstar. I can read you the recommendations, but I 6 wonder if you have any comments on that? Do you want 7 to know what they said? 8 9943 MR. PATERSON: I have read a set of 9 transcripts which have followed the proceedings as they 10 went along. 11 9944 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: So you are very 12 familiar. Wonderful. 13 9945 MR. PATERSON: Basically, our view is 14 that there is an absolutely enormous market out there 15 which ought, we feel, to be a sufficient incentive. 16 Certainly it has been a sufficient incentive for some 17 of the intervenors who have reported here. It wasn't 18 Ms Hoffman herself, but her company was represented 19 here and made it very obvious that in their opinion, 20 there is no need for support. 21 9946 I have had a decade in dealing with 22 the software industry when I was with Industry Canada 23 until recently. Basically the problem is that unless 24 the entrepreneur can put together a decent business 25 plan backed by an adequate management team, the funding StenoTran 2322 1 will not be available. 2 9947 The idea itself may appear 3 attractive, but there has to be a certain level of 4 business knowledge in the package to get it going. 5 There is a small scale funding problem at the less than 6 $2 million level venture capital. 7 9948 Two million dollars of venture 8 capital can be had for any decent deal right now. It's 9 when you are in the transition stage from your basement 10 to your first office in the back of the mall that you 11 need a quarter of a million dollars. That's where the 12 problem is. 13 9949 No one has ever been able to organize 14 that little market there. The Business Development 15 Bank of Canada has an active campaign under way that 16 was recently, in the last budget, given a substantial 17 piece of money to focus on precisely that area of the 18 market, but essentially it is a commercial decision. 19 It is based on sound financing principles. 20 9950 The question of incentives especially 21 designed for new media content producers, there are 22 numerous ones already available, as I cited. On the 23 tax side, not Revenue Canada but Finance Canada has an 24 extremely gloomy view of incentives based on the Income 25 Act. They quickly demolished the ones that sprang up StenoTran 2323 1 when some of the traditional film financiers tried to 2 use the same scheme to finance software companies. I 3 don't think you should anticipate anything from there. 4 9951 I don't believe that new media 5 content development passes the rules for the SR&AD tax 6 credits. 7 9952 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: I don't believe 8 so. 9 9953 MR. PATERSON: I think that given the 10 great difficulty which the high tech industry of all 11 varieties has had with that whole program for the past 12 couple of years that either Finance or Revenue Canada 13 would be willing to -- they might be willing to look at 14 it, but I doubt very much if they would be willing to 15 launch something like that in the immediate future. 16 9954 The high tech associations have a 17 major program on under way with Revenue Canada right 18 now to try to straighten out the problems in the SR&AD 19 program. I think until that is dealt with, they might 20 be a little reluctant to look at another class of 21 applicants. 22 9955 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: We look forward 23 to hearing from them. 24 9956 What we are trying to do here in this 25 kind of an exploratory forum is look at a number of StenoTran 2324 1 issues, part of which is the health of this industry 2 and its potential for future development. 3 9957 As someone has said here earlier, we 4 need to ensure we have a climate of innovation. So in 5 looking at these things, I think what we want to hear 6 is what are the kinds of things that people out there 7 in the business world think the government should be 8 doing to ensure we have a climate of innovation and a 9 climate in which these businesses can thrive and 10 develop. 11 9958 I am less concerned, frankly, at this 12 point about how the government would respond as opposed 13 to whether we come up with some suggestions from 14 industry that we think makes sense to pass on. That's 15 the context in which I was soliciting your views. 16 9959 MR. PATERSON: Our view on that issue 17 would be that the appropriate climate is one where 18 there is the absolute minimum of barriers to Canadian 19 companies in whatever business having an opportunity to 20 compete in the marketplace, whether it be the Canadian 21 market or the global market, that the incentives in 22 terms of the potential returns on investment, the size 23 of the markets, the broad scope. 24 9960 If you go online, you immediately 25 open yourself up to business opportunities around the StenoTran 2325 1 world. The incentives are there. The mechanisms for 2 achieving success are open to any entrepreneur who 3 wishes to seize the opportunity. 4 9961 We don't see any great advantages 5 conferred on Canada by special measures designed to 6 meet the needs of individual sectors. We are looking 7 for a level playing field where everyone has an 8 opportunity to compete and perform. 9 9962 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: With respect to 10 any recommendations we might make to government or in 11 fact with respect to any of the regulations that are in 12 place, our regulations now, are there any barriers that 13 you think should be removed? 14 9963 MR. PATERSON: Beyond encouraging you 15 to recommend you encourage the greatest possible 16 competition in the telecommunications services, we 17 believe that things should be left alone as they stand 18 now, that no effort should be made to regulate the 19 Internet or attach conditions to the Internet or to use 20 the Internet as a source of funds. 21 9964 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: I just have one 22 more question. Our Chair, Commissioner Colville, asked 23 one group if we at the CRTC should consider as a policy 24 to pursue a policy of universal access or ubiquitous 25 access to broadband or high speed. Should this be a StenoTran 2326 1 policy goal for us? I would just like your comments on 2 that. 3 9965 MR. PATERSON: I think it's an issue 4 which you should be examining as you go forward. It 5 isn't available now. There aren't a lot of providers 6 of services and products at this time which require it. 7 It does focus very much on your traditional 8 constituency, the entertainment world. 9 9966 I have not personally seen WebTV, but 10 I gather it's not exactly an inspiring experience if 11 you are getting it over a modem, but it works 12 reasonably well on cable. 13 9967 The very high speed access is an 14 issue which affects that part of the world that uses 15 the Internet. It is an issue which I don't think is 16 going to go away because as progress is made in 17 Internet technology, it will become more widely 18 demanded. It's an issue that needs to be pursued. 19 9968 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: I guess I 20 should have been a bit more specific. I was actually 21 referring on the telecom side, as we move forward with 22 a competitiveness agenda if this as a policy which 23 informs our decisions and regulations will be wise. 24 9969 MR. PATERSON: Yes. I believe that 25 it would. StenoTran 2327 1 9970 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: Thank you very 2 much. 3 9971 I don't know if you have anything 4 else to add. I appreciate you taking the time to come 5 here today. 6 9972 MR. PATERSON: Thank you. I enjoyed 7 the opportunity. 8 9973 THE CHAIRPERSON: Mr. Paterson, just 9 on the very last line, just to clarify for me a little 10 bit of the questioning that Commissioner Grauer did. 11 9974 When you say regulation of the 12 Internet is beyond the scope of the Broadcasting and 13 the Telecommunications Act, picking up a point that 14 Commissioner Grauer raised with you that in fact some 15 of the Internet service providers themselves suggested 16 that in many jurisdictions around the world they are 17 treated as telecommunications carriers for the purpose 18 of having the opportunity to interconnect with former, 19 incumbent telephone companies or cable companies or 20 whatever. 21 9975 In view of that aspect, would you 22 still take the view that Internet or ISPs should be 23 considered beyond the scope of the Telecommunications 24 Act? 25 9976 MR. PATERSON: I think that it's StenoTran 2328 1 essentially a different type of business than regular 2 telecom companies pursue. I think you would want to be 3 extremely cautious about rolling them into it. I 4 understand that they are considered telecom carriers in 5 some parts of the world. 6 9977 THE CHAIRPERSON: Including the 7 United States. 8 9978 MR. PATERSON: I wasn't aware that 9 the United States was one of those countries. 10 9979 THE CHAIRPERSON: If that activity 11 was to overcome the problems that resulted in this 12 company moving from Vancouver to Bellingham, would you 13 see that as a positive thing that should be looked at? 14 9980 MR. PATERSON: If that approach would 15 solve the problem, that would definitely be a plus. 16 9981 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Thank you 17 for your views here this morning. 18 9982 Madam Secretary. 19 9983 MS BÃ©NARD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 20 9984 The next presentation will be by the 21 Information Technology Association of Canada, 22 Association Canadienne de la Technologie de 23 l'Information. 24 9985 Mr. Duncan. 25 PRESENTATION / PRÃSENTATION StenoTran 2329 1 9986 THE CHAIRPERSON: Good morning, Mr. 2 Duncan. 3 9987 MR. DUNCAN: Good morning, Mr. 4 Chairman. As you are well aware, I am unaccustomed to 5 be sitting on this side of the hearing room. 6 9988 Good morning, Chairman and 7 Commissioners. 8 9989 ITAC is grateful for the opportunity 9 to contribute the views of Canada's information and 10 communication technology industry to this important 11 proceeding. 12 9990 You should know that from the very 13 day of the announcement of your hearing we have 14 supported this. We believe you have finally provided a 15 forum where this issue can be publicly debated. 16 9991 ITAC is the voice of the Canadian 17 information and communications technology industry. 18 Together with our partner organizations, we represent 19 more than 1,300 companies in the computing, 20 telecommunications, hardware, software, services and 21 electronic content sectors. 22 9992 This network of companies accounts 23 for more than 80 per cent of the 418,000 jobs, $70 24 billion in annual revenue, $3 billion in annual R&D 25 expenditure and $20 billion in annual exports that IT StenoTran 2330 1 contributes to the Canadian economy. 2 9993 We would like to begin our 3 presentation this morning with a very, very short video 4 clip from the recent Canadian Information Productivity 5 Awards. It features the company that not only won in 6 its class but was judged best in show. 7 9994 We believe that it provides a 8 succinct answer to the first question this proceeding 9 has posed and that was what kinds of new media services 10 are either currently available or can reasonably be 11 expected to emerge in the future. 12 9995 Video, please. 13 --- Video Presentation / prÃ©sentation vidÃ©o 14 0935 15 9996 MR. DUNCAN: Thank you. 16 9997 Bid.Com is a Canadian success story 17 that effectively bridges the emerging domains of new 18 media and electronic commerce. It competes head-on in 19 the dynamic world of on-line auctions with rivals from 20 around the world. Over the past two weeks, it has been 21 the volume leader on the TSE, where its share prices 22 have quintupled since October 19. The Bid.Com home 23 page is one of the most frequently visited on the 24 Internet. As the clip showed, 30,000 visitors per day. 25 It employs 35 Canadians and engages the expertise of StenoTran 2331 1 Canadian-based system partners such as Media Serve. 2 9998 Bid.Com is just one of many Canadian 3 companies who are early adopters of the exciting new 4 possibilities of electronic commerce. And e-commerce 5 is just one of many applications of the new media. 6 9999 I am now going to, I guess, disagree 7 with some of the comments that were made by the last 8 witness. E-commerce is a world in which Canada is 9 currently demonstrating significant leadership. This 10 leadership is manifest in major policy forums, such as 11 the recent OECD Ministerial Conference hosted by 12 Industry Minister Manley in October. But it is also 13 manifest in our economic activity. IDC, which does 14 survey Canadian e-commerce numbers, shows that Canada's 15 share of the $13 billion global e-commerce market in 16 1997 was 5.3 per cent, double our share of the world 17 GDP. 18 10000 We are world leaders in this area and 19 one of the reasons is that Canada has been able to 20 assert its leadership is from the fact that we enjoy a 21 relatively free and unregulated environment for 22 e-commerce to flourish. And more generally, this 23 relatively unfettered approach is serving Canada well 24 in other domains of the new media. 25 10001 New media companies are an StenoTran 2332 1 extraordinarily dynamic force in the new Canadian 2 economy. ITAC believes that unnecessary regulations 3 would only hobble their potential. They would have the 4 unintended and unfortunate consequence of holding back 5 the introduction of leading-edge services into the 6 Canadian and global market. And this in turn would 7 inhibit customer choice and restrict the potential for 8 wealth and employment creation. 9 10002 This Commission has wisely elected to 10 forebear on regulation of the Internet up to this 11 point. Mr. Chairman, we are encouraged by your opening 12 statements that you are not looking to apply old 13 regulatory models to new media. This is indeed a wise 14 point of departure. The Internet and the rest of the 15 new media are like nothing else in our current frame of 16 reference. 17 10003 For example, the Internet is a 18 global, democratic forum for the exchange of 19 information of all natures and descriptions. It 20 embraces everything -- from teenagers complaining about 21 their parents in chat rooms, from parents complaining 22 about their teenagers in chat rooms, to astrophysicists 23 debating the nature of neutrinos. It is a chaos 24 system, as rich, diverse and inscrutable as humanity 25 itself. And it is dynamic, changing and expanding in StenoTran 2333 1 functionality with each passing day. We have no way of 2 knowing what it will look like a year from now. We 3 only know it won't be identical to what we have today. 4 This mercurial quality makes regulation challenging, if 5 not impossible. 6 10004 The Internet presents other 7 challenges to regulation. It carries everything from 8 text -- in a multitude of languages -- to interactive 9 games, audio programs and video. And this, of course, 10 creates a puzzle for this Commission. 11 10005 Shouldn't a program carried to a 12 viewer on his PC be subject to the same scrutiny as one 13 brought to his television set? Repurposed content, 14 such as the many radio and television programs that 15 currently populate the home pages of Canada's 16 broadcasters, is already caught within the net of 17 regulation under the rules that govern broadcasting. 18 In other proceedings, this Commission must ponder 19 whether or not even this level of regulation is 20 appropriate. 21 10006 However, we do believe that 22 programming uniquely created for the Internet should 23 not be subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as 24 programming designed for broadcast. 25 10007 We believe that Canada's regulatory StenoTran 2334 1 regime must keep pace with developments in the 2 marketplace of ideas and services. It must also keep 3 pace with the convergence of technologies. This pace 4 is far more rapid than anything we have experienced in 5 the past. 6 10008 Recent decisions taken by this 7 Commissioner reflect your deep understanding of this 8 imperative. In the face of globalization, you have 9 elected to forebear on many aspects of 10 telecommunications and cable television distribution. 11 The result of this enlightened approach is that 12 Canadians today enjoy and profit from one of the most 13 open communications markets in the world. Consumers 14 benefit from a wider choice of service and price 15 options. And the companies that deliver these services 16 are faster and more innovative than they were when they 17 were burdened by regulation. Over the past decade, 18 this Commission has made many positive advances toward 19 a regulatory regime in keeping with the demands of a 20 global, information-based economy. To regulate the 21 Internet or any other aspect of new media would be a 22 huge step backward on this progressive path. 23 10009 I said earlier that the Internet and 24 new media are as complex as humanity itself. This 25 means, of course, that not every message will be StenoTran 2335 1 salutary or useful. Hate infects it as it infects 2 mankind. But anyone who's ever witnessed the speed and 3 ruthlessness with which hate is \"flamed\" in news groups 4 or chat rooms can be encouraged by the prospect of a 5 new standard of tolerance among net-heads and 6 cyberpunks. 7 10010 Nevertheless, there is offensive 8 content on the Internet and in new media. But Canada 9 has laws that address hate and pornography and those 10 laws are as applicable to new media as they are to 11 traditional media. New regulations uniquely applicable 12 to new media are unnecessary. 13 10011 It is our job in the information and 14 communication technology industry to act responsibly as 15 we develop this dynamic new resource. It is our 16 responsibility to ensure that the solutions and the 17 services we develop protect privacy, respond to the 18 legitimate concerns of individual consumers and user 19 and provide effective avenues for redress. We believe 20 that no one has a greater stake in ensuring that the 21 new public spaces provided by Internet and other new 22 media are hospitable, non-threatening environments for 23 users. 24 10012 We support the call for a voluntary 25 code of conduct expressed by the Canadian Association StenoTran 2336 1 of Broadcasters and others. ITAC was a major catalyst 2 in the movement for light-handed privacy legislation 3 and consumer protection. Our experience over the past 4 decade strongly suggests that the best safeguards are 5 those developed by the players themselves. 6 10013 What, then, is the role of 7 government, and this Commission in particular, in the 8 exciting new world of new media? There is a huge job 9 to be done to ensure that this exciting new resource 10 reaches its potential. 11 10014 We believe that there are at least 12 seven actions that must be taken either alone or in 13 association with others to ensure a strong Canadian 14 share of voice in the world of new media. 15 10015 First and foremost, you must forebear 16 from regulation of new media. Instead, we believe you 17 must focus on framework issues such as privacy and 18 consumer protection. 19 10016 Second, you must monitor the 20 marketplace to ensure that what we celebrate as a free 21 and open environment remains that way. 22 10017 Third, access to capital continues to 23 be a huge stumbling block for new media, indeed for 24 most information technology entrepreneurship. This 25 should be your third focus. Public funds, such as StenoTran 2337 1 Ontario's recently launched Multimedia Fund and 2 Heritage Canada's Fund, as well as private funds 3 operated by the telephone and cable companies, help. 4 But they would benefit from additional support. We 5 would also benefit from some new thinking. We would 6 suggest that tax incentives, such as those directed at 7 film production, would attract capital to new media. 8 10018 Fourth, government can serve as model 9 users of new media for delivery of government programs 10 and services. They can seize more readily perhaps than 11 the private sector the opportunities that are apparent 12 in new technologies. As model users they can lead the 13 way for the rest of us, improving the efficiency and 14 the effectiveness of service delivery. The federal 15 government has shown leadership in the use of 16 technology to conduct its business. The CRTC, with its 17 informative and up-to-date Internet site, is part of 18 this trend and this role must continue. Introducing 19 and speeding the introductory date of digital TV would 20 be another example of model users. 21 10019 A fifth area for action is developing 22 the skills resource to continue to fuel Canadian 23 innovation in new media. Centres of excellence in new 24 media, such as the Bell Centre at Centennial College, 25 the Rogers Centre at Ryerson, and at Sheridan College StenoTran 2338 1 should be supported and emulated throughout Canada. 2 10020 A sixth area for your focus has got 3 to be the international arena. The Canadian government 4 must work to ensure a level playing field and 5 consistency of treatment for new media in all 6 jurisdictions. We want to avoid a situation where the 7 rules in Canada are inconsistent with the rules in 8 Germany. The world of new media is truly a world 9 without borders and our government must continue to 10 carry that message around the globe. 11 10021 And lastly, and above all, the most 12 important role for government is to keep the vision 13 alive. ITAC believes in and supports the vision of a 14 Connected Canada leading and prospering in a global 15 knowledge-based economy. There has been considerable 16 progress toward this goal. We can point to superb 17 initiatives like SchoolNet and the Community Access 18 Program as major advances that have been taken. But 19 there have also been false starts as well. The 20 industry has learned from them and continues to 21 advance. This Commission must continue to champion a 22 more rapid progress toward the realization of the dream 23 of a Connected Canada. Undue regulation of the new 24 media would simply not advance this objective. 25 10022 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. StenoTran 2339 1 10023 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you, Mr. 2 Duncan, and welcome to our proceeding. 3 10024 When I read your original letter to 4 the Commission in the first round submission, you 5 talked about the Association wants to see this enormous 6 economic contribution enhanced, that being all the 7 activity around us, by \"the application of a forward 8 look and policy framework for new media.\" Would the 9 seven points that you have highlighted at the end of 10 your presentation this morning, is that what you had in 11 mind when you talked about a forward looking policy 12 framework? 13 10025 MR. DUNCAN: They would constitute 14 part of the framework. I think expanding on the first 15 point, focusing on building the framework pieces, the 16 rules for privacy, the rules for consumer protection, 17 focusing on existing legislation and applying it 18 heavily to the new media, whether that's hate or 19 pornography. Those are all pieces of the framework, 20 yes. 21 10026 THE CHAIRPERSON: Maybe in a few 22 minutes then we will go down through those and see what 23 role we can play in this. 24 10027 I guess one of the -- you quoted the 25 comment at the outset of the hearing here and I notice StenoTran 2340 1 a lot of the submissions that we received have talked 2 about -- and you have used the phrases in your 3 submission here this morning, unnecessary regulation or 4 the burden of regulation. I guess the Commission is 5 looking at this whole proceeding and this issue from 6 the point of view of trying to understand to what 7 extent some of this content may well be captured by 8 some of our existing rules. But I think we are as much 9 concerned about whether or not the current regulations 10 that we have might either do now or might inhibit the 11 development of the Internet and its content, whether it 12 be electronic commerce or other content and whether 13 that be broadcasting or telecommunications issues. 14 10028 So, I guess I am wondering whether 15 you have a sense of the regulations from that 16 perspective? I know that a lot of people have 17 expressed the concern that there is a considerable 18 amount of uncertainty in the marketplace with respect 19 to the role of the Commission, and I believe you and 20 your members have voiced some particular concern in 21 that regard. 22 10029 I would like to get a bit of an 23 understanding about to what extent you think this 24 uncertainty has been a problem and what we should be 25 doing about that to overcome that problem? StenoTran 2341 1 10030 MR. DUNCAN: Uncertainty has affected 2 investment by multinationals in Canada. We have 3 examples and, unfortunately, because they are member 4 specific I can't name them, but we can, if necessary, 5 dig them out for you, of multinationals who have 6 decided not to invest in projects and products in 7 Canada because of the uncertainty. 8 10031 We have been quite specific about the 9 degree of uncertainty. There have been senior public 10 servants and members of this Commission who have in the 11 past voiced wonder as to whether or not the Internet 12 should be regulated. That in and of itself was 13 sufficient to affect investment decisions. 14 10032 The issue of whether or not we 15 believe you are caught within your own rules as to 16 whether you must deem jurisdiction over multi-media, 17 new media, I guess goes back to the foundation of why 18 we started to regulate. We began with the scarce 19 resource. We had to regulate in order to allocate that 20 scarce resource. 21 10033 After we started regulating we began 22 to add additional hooks to the fact that we were 23 already intervening in the market and for just cause 24 regulation of scarce resources was justifiable, and we 25 added Canadian content rules. We didn't start with StenoTran 2342 1 Canadian content rules. We ended there. 2 10034 I look at -- sorry, now we are 3 dealing with the issue of should the Internet be 4 regulated and we are starting with Canadian content. 5 We are starting with the content issues. I think we 6 have backed our way into the problem. 7 10035 Part of the difficulty that I believe 8 you face and I believe is faced in the United States is 9 that given the existing forms of regulation, it's 10 easier to solve it by regulating anew. I believe that 11 is contrary to the position that this Commission has 12 taken for the last several years, decade plus, where 13 you have been going into the deregulation mode, 14 recognizing that competition in the marketplace was the 15 appropriate mode of control. 16 10036 THE CHAIRPERSON: I guess it is 17 probably fair to say that originally the Commission, 18 the government, got into the business of regulating 19 broadcasting because of a scarce spectrum, but in more 20 recent times the concern was probably as much an 21 economic one in terms of the question of access of 22 Canadian product, which was referred to several times 23 yesterday here as long-form programming and the 24 economic disincentive for that product to get access to 25 broadcast distribution technologies, whether they be StenoTran 2343 1 using scarce resources or not and, in fact, the 2 Broadcasting Act, as you know, was changed in the early 3 nineties to include other forms of technology, whether 4 wire optical or -- and, in fact, I think the Act says 5 \"or other technologies\". 6 10037 Because of the economic problem 7 facing content creators, Canadian content creators 8 getting access to the distribution because the 9 economics meant it was always cheaper for a purchaser 10 of content to buy American product and put it on. And 11 so, the Parliament of Canada tried to overcome that by 12 making changes to the Broadcasting Act and providing 13 the Commission with the powers to deal with that issue. 14 10038 While it has often been characterized 15 I think as regulating content, it has been more a 16 question of trying to ensure that there is a Canadian 17 presence, whether it be recorded music or long-form 18 programming. 19 10039 I guess part of our concern has been 20 whether or not if you change the delivery technology 21 that economic problem with respect to that sort of 22 programming still exists, or whether by the nature of 23 the new technology you can overcome those problems. I 24 am wondering whether you would have a view on that? 25 10040 MR. DUNCAN: There are two aspects to StenoTran 2344 1 the access issue. The first is access by the user and 2 the second is access by the content provider to a 3 distribution channel. 4 10041 In October of this year we 5 commissioned a survey of Canadian adults over the age 6 of 20 in terms of their access to the Internet. 7 Thirty-three point nine per cent of Canadian adults 8 four years after the advent of the Internet now have 9 access to the Internet; 23.8 per cent from their own 10 home. 11 10042 I think what we are seeing on the 12 Internet side is access by the user to this 13 distribution channel is growing faster than any other 14 technology that has ever been introduced in Canada. 15 10043 In terms of access by the content 16 provider, it is a whole new world. Any content 17 provider can put up its own Web page at trivial 18 expense. The cost is the production of the content. 19 That has not gone down. Internet content is as 20 expensive as producing a movie, producing a CD. 21 10044 I don't believe that trying to 22 regulate the distribution mechanism is going to have 23 any impact at all on the cost of producing the content. 24 In fact, if you truly believe that regulating the 25 distribution mechanism is important, and I do believe StenoTran 2345 1 your Act says, \"and any other distribution medium,\" 2 Blockbuster Video should be licensed by you. It's a 3 distribution medium of content and it's heavily 4 American. Why don't you impose a requirement that the 5 first 10 films that you see when you walk into 6 Blockbuster be Canadian? Because you recognize, I 7 believe, that that is not a distribution medium that 8 you want to get into the business of regulating. I say 9 the same thing with regard to the Internet itself. 10 10045 The problem you have posed, which is 11 a very legitimate and I refer to it in my testimony, a 12 very legitimate issue, is how do we produce and promote 13 more Canadian content? That, I believe, is a 14 legitimate issue and should be addressed by government. 15 I believe you should be making recommendations and some 16 of the points I have raised in my seven point action 17 plan address that. 18 10046 I think we need new creative thinking 19 on how we promote Canadian content, but I believe we 20 have moved away from the concept of protecting it. 21 10047 THE CHAIRPERSON: Do you have a sense 22 of whether or not or when the Internet is likely to 23 have the capacity to be able to deliver broadcast-like 24 long-form programming? 25 10048 MR. DUNCAN: The answer again is an StenoTran 2346 1 access issue. It can today on the canary backbone. It 2 will, even more so, on CA-Net 3, but that's restricted 3 access. At the moment that's academic institutions, 4 research institutions, et cetera. That is rolling out. 5 10049 Can I put a time frame on it? 6 Probably -- I'm in the midst of a conflict. It's 7 rolling out as fast as the communications carriers can 8 invest in the technology to deliver broadband to the 9 home and not nearly fast enough from the point of view 10 of the new media industry. 11 10050 It's a market pressure. The new 12 media industries need that broadband into the home and 13 the carriers have capital cost issues in terms of the 14 rate at which they roll it out. 15 10051 I think the move towards competition, 16 towards allowing all carriers to do that last loop is 17 going to speed up the rate at which it gets adopted. 18 Do I believe it's in the next three to five years to 19 get to 50 per cent of Canadian homes? No, I don't. Do 20 I believe it's more than 10? No. 21 10052 THE CHAIRPERSON: So somewhere in the 22 five to 10 year time range. 23 10053 Getting back to this uncertainty 24 question and around this broadcasting question. You 25 mentioned the video stores and we don't get involved StenoTran 2347 1 with the video stores because it doesn't form a means 2 of telecommunications in the delivery. 3 10054 I guess one of the issues that has 4 been raised in the proceeding is whether or not -- not 5 so much whether or not we want to go out and grab this 6 from a regulatory grab point of view, but whether or 7 not with the current definition of program or 8 broadcasting some of the material that is carried or 9 might be carried over the Internet would be captured by 10 the current definition. I am wondering whether you 11 have any thoughts on that with respect to this 12 uncertainty question and what the Commission could 13 specifically do to clarify that? 14 10055 I am mindful in asking this question 15 of a former life, that we worked together in commenting 16 on early stages of this Broadcasting Act when you and I 17 both worked for the Government of Nova Scotia, so you 18 are not unfamiliar with this. 19 10056 MR. DUNCAN: The preferred conclusion 20 of this hearing would be that you do not -- or this 21 technology does not fall under the wording of the Act. 22 That would be a very clear, strong signal. 23 10057 The wording in my testimony was, 24 well, if perchance technically some of the product does 25 fall under the Act, that you immediately forebear and StenoTran 2348 1 announce that that is your intention. That will send a 2 second signal, not as good, but a better signal than 3 the one that is out there now which is unclear. 4 10058 I think we are caught in -- Mr. 5 Paterson I think used some good language. We are 6 caught in definitions from the old technology and we 7 are trying to move them to the new technology. It's 8 time for a mind warp. New media delivered over the 9 Internet is not broadcasting. It's a different animal. 10 10059 THE CHAIRPERSON: I guess some of the 11 concern that was raised yesterday is the concern that 12 old media delivered over the Internet may be broadcast. 13 10060 MR. DUNCAN: But, as I said in my 14 testimony, the old media, if that is a program that has 15 been produced and is now put up on the Web page, has 16 already been regulated. 17 10061 THE CHAIRPERSON: If it's being 18 delivered by an existing licensed broadcaster. 19 10062 MR. DUNCAN: If it has been 20 broadcast. 21 10063 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yes. 22 10064 MR. DUNCAN: If it's CBC that 23 broadcasts -- does CBC do Canada A.M.? CTV does Canada 24 A.M. -- I'm sorry if they are in the audience. If CTV 25 broadcasts Canada A.M. and then puts that show up on StenoTran 2349 1 its Web page, it has already been regulated. Don't 2 regulate twice. 3 10065 THE CHAIRPERSON: I guess the issue 4 is that if you were able to do Canada A.M. without 5 broadcasting it, just doing it on the Internet pipe is 6 that still broadcasting? 7 10066 MR. DUNCAN: A new way. 8 10067 THE CHAIRPERSON: And I think that is 9 what some of the parties were raising yesterday, and if 10 the definition then captures that, but that for 11 economic or other reasons there is no need to regulate 12 it, how do we treat the definitions in terms of 13 resolving this uncertainty problem and saying even 14 though it might be captured by the definition, we could 15 provide this interpretation. 16 10068 You mentioned the term \"forebear\". 17 We have the power to forebear on the Telecom Act and i 18 the Broadcasting Act we have the power to examine. 19 Some parties have suggested -- or the power to exempt, 20 but some parties have suggested that that wouldn't 21 necessarily relieve this uncertainty because you can 22 always lift that power in any event. 23 10069 MR. DUNCAN: I'm sorry, I made the 24 point, fall outside the Act is the strongest possible 25 signal you can send. Forebear and exempt is good, StenoTran 2350 1 better than what we have today, but not as good as 2 saying it's your conclusion that it's outside the Act. 3 10070 I think we have to go back -- in 4 terms of your first point, we have to go back and 5 reconceive what a broadcaster is. We entered the 6 concept of broadcasting from the distribution point of 7 view. Broadcasters are really producers and buyers. 8 They are not distributors. 9 10071 They are today, over the airwaves and 10 down the cable channel, but that's not where they are 11 evolving to. If I was to look at CBC and link it to 10 12 years from now on the Internet, I don't know whether we 13 would have an engineering side to CBC, a distribution 14 side to CBC or the debt problems that we have with CBC. 15 10072 I do believe we would have a content 16 producer and buyer. 17 10073 THE CHAIRPERSON: Switching over to 18 the telecom side for a minute or two, as I indicated 19 and Commissioner Grauer did with Mr. Paterson earlier, 20 and the issue came up last week from a number of ISPs 21 about this question of getting access to high speed 22 broadband capability, do you have a view on that 23 question about whether or not we should be using some 24 of the powers under the Telecommunications Act? 25 10074 Telus last Friday suggested we should StenoTran 2351 1 initiate a proceeding following this one to take a look 2 at that whole issue of how we could best ensure the 3 development -- I'm paraphrasing what they said and I 4 apologize if I am not quite capturing it correctly, but 5 to take a look at the whole question of high-speed 6 access and what we could do perhaps to encourage a 7 faster roll-out, by allowing for perhaps, and these are 8 my words, greater competition between the ISPs perhaps 9 and the cable companies and the telephone companies. 10 10075 MR. DUNCAN: I have a strong urge to 11 fall back into my prior role. Why is there a problem, 12 Mr. Chairman? 13 10076 THE CHAIRPERSON: I'm sorry, why is 14 there a problem? 15 10077 MR. DUNCAN: Why is there a problem 16 with the ISPs? 17 10078 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, they claim 18 there is a problem in their inability to get access to 19 infrastructure, perhaps co-locate some of their 20 equipment in central offices of the telephone 21 companies, and again I am paraphrasing their position I 22 guess. Largely they are seen as customers of the phone 23 companies, rather than, shall we say, co-carriers, more 24 as partners I suppose in developing this infrastructure 25 in this country. StenoTran 2352 1 10079 MR. DUNCAN: Co-carrier -- words like 2 \"co-carriers,\" \"partners\" and whatnot are market words. 3 They are not regulatory words. If they haven't put 4 forward the appropriate business case, why would we 5 turn to regulation to force something? And if they 6 have a good business case, then why are the existing 7 carriers not responding? 8 10080 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, I guess the 9 issue would be is this not unlike the situation of 10 either the interchange carriers or the local collects 11 getting access to the bottleneck facilities in order to 12 be able to compete and provide service? 13 10081 MR. DUNCAN: And there are regulatory 14 reasons why they can't get access? 15 1005 16 10082 THE CHAIRPERSON: They are suggesting 17 there are. 18 10083 MR. DUNCAN: Then let's deregulate 19 that part. 20 10084 THE CHAIRPERSON: Let's deregulate 21 it? 22 10085 MR. DUNCAN: Yes. Let's let two 23 companies come together with a business case and 24 provide a unique new service. 25 10086 THE CHAIRPERSON: Do you think if we StenoTran 2353 1 deregulated the business the telephone companies would 2 provide that access? 3 10087 MR. DUNCAN: I didn't say the 4 telephone companies. The providers will. You have 5 multiple companies out there now. 6 10088 THE CHAIRPERSON: I'm sorry. Who are 7 the multiple companies? 8 10089 MR. DUNCAN: We have cable. We have 9 telephone. We have wireless. We have electricity 10 which is now carrying signals. Technologically, we 11 don't have an issue here. We have market players that 12 are doing weird things, but that's also true in some of 13 the regulated areas. 14 10090 THE CHAIRPERSON: So your view would 15 be that there is already enough competition in the 16 marketplace through having cable and the telephone 17 companies, LMCS, MMDS, satellite, that the ISPs should 18 simply present their business case to those various 19 players and there is no need to take any regulatory 20 action to ensure that they would have the sort of 21 access, say comparable access that we have ordered for 22 the CLECs to provide competition to local telephone 23 service. 24 10091 MR. DUNCAN: We walk down a long and 25 dangerous road, Mr. Chairman. I believe the framework StenoTran 2354 1 is there. 2 10092 Do I believe it's happening in the 3 market yet? No. It's starting. I understand the 4 frustration from the ISPs, but do I believe you have 5 produced a framework in which competition will begin 6 and it has begun, is changing the market behaviour, is 7 changing the availability of services to individuals. 8 Yes, I do. 9 10093 THE CHAIRPERSON: So it's your view 10 that the existing framework is enough to accommodate 11 the concerns of the ISPs. 12 10094 MR. DUNCAN: I don't think I feel 13 comfortable saying that there isn't a technical issue 14 in the existing regulations that should be addressed, 15 but it should be addressed in the framework of we are 16 deregulating and we are letting market forces take 17 over, totally contrary to the entire discussion on 18 moving in to regulate the Internet. 19 10095 THE CHAIRPERSON: When you use the 20 term deregulation, because it was used last week by Ms 21 Langford from IBM, and we had a bit of a discussion 22 about that. She was using the term deregulation, I 23 think, when she was meaning we should create more 24 competition. We should take whatever steps we might 25 need in terms of taking a look a look at our regulation StenoTran 2355 1 of communications in order to encourage more 2 competition. 3 10096 Are you using the term deregulation 4 in that sense? 5 10097 MR. DUNCAN: Well -- 6 10098 THE CHAIRPERSON: Deregulation is 7 often used in that sense. Deregulation and 8 competition, those terms are often used synonymously 9 when I view them as being different. 10 10099 MR. DUNCAN: Yes. I'm having trouble 11 with the question. Deregulation simply says that there 12 will be less government intervention in market forces. 13 Market forces does not necessarily guarantee there will 14 be more competition. 15 10100 THE CHAIRPERSON: Exactly. 16 10101 MR. DUNCAN: It creates an 17 environment. I do believe that we are seeing the 18 environment where more competition is coming in where 19 you have been deregulating, but they are not 20 synonymous, no. 21 10102 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. We have 22 taken the steps to put in place a framework that will 23 provide for competition. 24 10103 MR. DUNCAN: It allows for, but does 25 not guarantee. StenoTran 2356 1 10104 THE CHAIRPERSON: Exactly. 2 10105 MR. DUNCAN: That's correct. 3 10106 THE CHAIRPERSON: Here's where I draw 4 the distinction between competition and deregulation. 5 I see putting in place that framework as being a 6 pro-competition policy. 7 10107 Somewhere down the road when we are 8 satisfied that the former monopolist has satisfied the 9 parameters for deregulation, we would then foreborn 10 from regulating tariffs of the former monopolist. 11 That's deregulation. 12 10108 MR. DUNCAN: I agree with that point. 13 Unnatural market behaviour is captured under other 14 legislation. The fact that you have deregulated does 15 not mean there may not be unnatural market behaviour. 16 10109 THE CHAIRPERSON: Right. If we look 17 at the seven components of the framework you have put 18 forward, seven actions that must be taken either alone 19 or in association with others to ensure a strong 20 Canadian share of voice in the world of new media, you 21 talk about first and foremost you must forebear from 22 regulation of new media. 23 10110 We have talked about this issue of 24 clarifying the uncertainty around the definition of 25 broadcasting and whether or not some of the activity on StenoTran 2357 1 the Internet may be captured by existing framework. I 2 appreciate your position on that. You may want to 3 think about what particular action that we could be 4 taking when you prepare your final argument for this 5 proceeding. 6 10111 When you go on to say you must focus 7 on a framework of issues such as privacy and consumer 8 protection, were there particular issues that you 9 thought that the Commission should undertake in this 10 respect? 11 10112 MR. DUNCAN: No. I was hoping that 12 you would recommend in your final decision. There are 13 other actors who have true jurisdiction there. Justice 14 clearly on privacy, Industry Canada on consumer 15 protection. 16 10113 You are in the unique position right 17 now of being the only game in town. You have an 18 opportunity to express a view of how this should evolve 19 that includes actors other than the Commission. That 20 was why we supported this hearing from the very 21 beginning. 22 10114 THE CHAIRPERSON: We know there are a 23 number of actions that are already under way with 24 respect to this. I think Industry Canada -- I don't 25 know whether there's is seven point, but I think it's StenoTran 2358 1 in that sort of range -- 2 10115 MR. DUNCAN: Five. 3 10116 THE CHAIRPERSON: -- of initiatives 4 that they have undertaken with respect to privacy and 5 encryption and so on. I presume you are reasonably 6 satisfied with what's happening there with respect to 7 those issues. 8 10117 MR. DUNCAN: I will refer to an 9 article in yesterday's National Post where I responded 10 to a release by President Clinton and Vice-President 11 Gore to a new series of actions in the United States 12 dealing with e-commerce. I said, and it was quoted so 13 I will stand behind it: 14 \"Welcome to the world, Mr. 15 Clinton. Canada has been there 16 for the last two years. We are 17 very supportive of the existing 18 framework that is coming out of 19 Industry Canada under Minister 20 Manley in the e-commerce 21 strategy, the connectedness 22 strategy.\" 23 10118 Yes. 24 10119 THE CHAIRPERSON: The second point. 25 You have said: StenoTran 2359 1 \"You --\" 2 10120 I presume the CRTC. 3 \"-- must monitor the marketplace 4 to ensure that we celebrate as a 5 free and open environment, that 6 what we celebrate remains that 7 way.\" 8 10121 Did you have something in particular 9 in mind here in terms of what we would be monitoring? 10 10122 MR. DUNCAN: Yes, I did. I believe 11 that this hearing has resulted in a significant 12 learning experience, not only for the Commissioners, 13 for the staff, but even for those of us who have been 14 testifying. 15 10123 There is a highly enhanced awareness 16 of what the current state of new media and Internet is. 17 I don't believe that that is something that should 18 happen at another hearing two years from now. I 19 believe that's something that should be an active part 20 of the daily life of all of the players. 21 10124 We must continue to be part of this 22 new media so that we understand how it changes, so that 23 we don't have a requirement to create a new forum to 24 start really from scratch. 25 10125 Looking for abuses, playing the role StenoTran 2360 1 of monitor in terms of content, stimulating reaction by 2 other government agencies when the wrong kinds of 3 content appear, using the existing legislation that is 4 available to them. These are all, I think, very 5 legitimate roles for the Commission. 6 10126 THE CHAIRPERSON: One of the issues 7 that I don't think you have covered off here is the 8 whole question of rights with respect to content 9 creators. 10 10127 What's your view in terms of the 11 activity that has been under way dealing with those 12 issues? A lot of the parties that were here yesterday 13 were expressing concerns about whether or not their 14 property is going to be protected from a rights point 15 of view if it is used on the Internet. 16 10128 MR. DUNCAN: Would you like an eight 17 point plan instead of a seven point plan? 18 10129 We do have a position on the existing 19 copyright issues and the need to amend the Canadian 20 legislation to at least move up to the state of the 21 international agreements that we signed a year and a 22 half ago that dealt with databases. 23 10130 I think we have an additional new 24 challenge on how we protect copyright on the Internet. 25 I don't have a solution yet. I guess the one position StenoTran 2361 1 we have taken is we are opposed to the concepts like a 2 bit tax to go into a copyright collective. That's not 3 just not an approach that we favour. 4 10131 I do admit there are increasingly 5 more complex and difficult copyright issues on the 6 Internet than there have been in all prior 7 technologies. Cut and paste is two buttons. At least 8 in the past we had to walk over to the Xerox machine 9 and turn the pages. 10 10132 The concept of copyright in finding 11 tools, including the collectives' approach to protect 12 it, we are highly supportive of that. We are just not 13 supportive of a broad based tax everything that goes by 14 approach. I didn't help you with that answer. 15 10133 THE CHAIRPERSON: Well, I guess we 16 have said on a number of occasions that copyright 17 doesn't fall squarely within our jurisdiction, although 18 as some parties have suggested kind of indirectly the 19 way we have dealt with broadcasting issues has 20 indirectly dealt with a number of issues. 21 10134 As has been pointed out to us, those 22 copyright issues are being addressed in another forum 23 in the government. 24 10135 MR. DUNCAN: Not fast enough. If I 25 was to ask you to make any statement on copyright, it StenoTran 2362 1 would be that we speed up. The government by its own 2 admission has dealt with all modernizing copyright 3 issues except new technology. Well, it's time. The 4 new technology is here. 5 10136 THE CHAIRPERSON: The next few of 6 your suggestions are pretty clear. The sixth area you 7 talked about was the international arena. I'm 8 wondering what particular role you would see for this 9 Commission in the international arena in this respect. 10 10137 MR. DUNCAN: This Commission is 11 already active in taking the lessons it has learned and 12 the experience that it has had into the international 13 arena and talking to other jurisdictions that are 14 wrestling with how do you regulate both telecom and 15 broadcasting. That should continue. 16 10138 More importantly, the belief that 17 there should be a common open system at the core of 18 running and living in the Canadian new technology, that 19 belief should be spread into other jurisdictions. 20 10139 Whether that is consistency in 21 consumer protection, consistency in the treatment of 22 personal information, consistency in the access to the 23 technology, the messages are all the messages that we 24 are delivering here in Canada, but I believe should be 25 delivered and negotiated, if necessary, through StenoTran 2363 1 international agreements internationally. 2 10140 THE CHAIRPERSON: Finally, you have 3 said that the Commission must continue to champion a 4 more rapid progress toward the realization of a dream 5 of a connected Canada. 6 10141 Is there anything beyond what we have 7 talked about here that we should be doing in that 8 respect? 9 10142 MR. DUNCAN: I think Minister Manley 10 has raised the bar. He has taken this vision, taken a 11 technical type discussion and converted it into a 12 social policy vision, an economic policy vision and he 13 has taken it to the general public. 14 10143 This Commission is not generally 15 known for talking to the general public. It's known 16 for talking to its licensees, to the government. Yes, 17 I do believe this implies an additional step for the 18 Commission. 19 10144 I believe it means going out in a far 20 more public proactive way in talking about why the 21 decisions you have taken technically have an impact on 22 my life, both economically and socially. 23 10145 THE CHAIRPERSON: I think we have 24 started to recognize that problem with the vision 25 exercise we went through about a year ago. I take your StenoTran 2364 1 point. I think we have recognized that we have to do a 2 better job of that than we traditionally have. 3 10146 MR. DUNCAN: You have a wealth of 4 information, a wealth of experience, a view of how this 5 piece of our life which is becoming a critical point of 6 the Canadian economy, is evolving and how it can 7 evolve. Please deliver the message. 8 10147 THE CHAIRPERSON: Last point. What 9 about statistics? Commissioner Grauer raised the issue 10 with Mr. Paterson about this study that was referenced 11 to us. In fact, I think it was Ms Langford who raised 12 the issue last week about this study that the Boston 13 group has done. 14 10148 Canada's numbers weren't included in 15 that because our e-commerce numbers were so small that 16 we didn't show up on the radar screen. 17 10149 You on the other hand have provided 18 us with some numbers here this morning in your oral 19 presentation which suggest that we are 5.3 per cent, 20 more than double Canada's share of the GDP in terms of 21 global commerce on the Internet, I guess, the number 22 is. 23 10150 Is there a problem, particularly 24 given the newness of this business in terms of our 25 ability to get meaningful statistics so that one could StenoTran 2365 1 then know where we stand and whether or not there are 2 problems inhibiting the development and where one might 3 take the look at focusing on resolving those problems? 4 10151 MR. DUNCAN: The absolute simple 5 answer is yes. We do have statistics. I'm sorry the 6 Boston group was referenced because they did not do an 7 analysis of Canadian numbers. 8 10152 IDC, International Data Corps, does. 9 I would be happy to provide you with additional 10 statistics to give you a feel for what's going on in 11 the market. This is activities by Canadian adults in 12 the months of August and September of this year, very 13 recent data. 14 10153 The number one piece of e-commerce 15 that we did not survey is the use of the Internet for 16 sex, pornography. The next two largest items are 17 hardware and software and related products. 18 10154 The next, and it should be of great 19 interest to this Commission, after the top three, is 20 fundamentally music. It's actually listed under music, 21 games and movies, but when you break it down, it's 22 fundamentally music. 23 10155 In the months of August and 24 September, 150,000 Canadian adults purchased music over 25 the Internet. The next largest, which was 100,000 StenoTran 2366 1 Canadian adults, purchased non-IT related publications. 2 The usual quote here is amazon.com. The next go 3 figure, the next, 90,000 Canadians in the months of 4 August and September purchased clothing. 5 10156 None of us when we forecasted what 6 would happen on the Intenet had clothing ranked as 7 number five. It wasn't on the horizon. That's true 8 because in the months of August and September a year 9 ago, about 5,000 Canadians purchased clothing, so from 10 5,000 to 90,000 in one year. 11 10157 We do have statistics on the Canadian 12 market, but we getting them by doing surveys. Again, 13 if you can make a statement in your final report, 14 Statistics Canada is not providing us with this kind of 15 information. 16 10158 It's the only piece of the economy 17 where industry has to go out and survey to find out 18 what's going on and then come back and tell government. 19 10159 THE CHAIRPERSON: A couple of points. 20 The numbers that you have just given us, are they out 21 of this study that you referenced this morning? 22 10160 MR. DUNCAN: They are, and I would be 23 happy to -- 24 10161 THE CHAIRPERSON: Could you file 25 those for the record? StenoTran 2367 1 10162 MR. DUNCAN: I will file. This is of 2 the Internet Growth and Security, A Joint Briefing by 3 ITAC and IDC Canada. 4 10163 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay. Let me throw 5 the ball to you then. When you file your final 6 comments on this, if there are particular statistics or 7 a particular aspect of this that you think should be 8 focused on rather than just kind of a blanket statement 9 that Statistics Canada should do a better job in 10 arriving at these numbers, that might be helpful as 11 well. 12 10164 Commissioner Grauer. 13 10165 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: Thank you. 14 10166 I just have one follow-up question on 15 this discussion on e-commerce. I am trying to 16 reconcile these different reports. 17 10167 I read the Globe and Mail report this 18 morning, the OECD report on Canada, which cited 19 Canadians lagging in the adoption of new technologies. 20 It didn't give any detail. I have no idea what the 21 substance of the report is. 22 10168 I am just wondering for our purposes 23 as we move forward if there isn't some comparative data 24 that would be useful in some of these areas of 25 e-commerce. You have given us some of the real StenoTran 2368 1 numbers. 2 10169 I think the questioning is not to 3 suggest that there is anything missing in the 4 government's agenda, but if in fact we are 5 proportionately lagging some other countries, maybe 6 there are some things we can be looking at in terms of 7 prescriptions that aren't already under way. Do you 8 have any comment? 9 10170 MR. DUNCAN: I have not read this 10 morning's Globe. I was busy reading my testimony for 11 you. 12 10171 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: I understand. 13 I was preparing as well. 14 10172 MR. DUNCAN: I am puzzled by the 15 reference to the lagging adoption of technology. 16 10173 Canada is by all measures considered 17 an early adopter of technology and I would be happy to 18 try and find the various studies that have shown that 19 in terms of credit card, ATM, debit card, telephone, et 20 cetera. I don't think the issue here is adoption of 21 technology. 22 10174 There is a concern over productivity. 23 That's a real problem because we are still measuring 24 productivity under the total factor of productivity 25 measures that really were very appropriate in a bricks StenoTran 2369 1 and mortar and primary industries economy, but don't 2 seem to take into account any of the knowledge-based 3 economy issues. 4 10175 ITAC is worried about that. We are 5 talking internationally about how we find new measures 6 that will allow us to gauge our economic performance 7 against those of our new competitors as well as our old 8 competitors. 9 10176 I didn't answer the rest of what you 10 said. 11 10177 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: I guess it's 12 just whether or not there is comparative data between 13 Canada and the U.S.. I don't know if it's there. 14 10178 MR. DUNCAN: Okay. There is 15 comparative data. We will table the study done by 16 WITSA, World Information Technology Services 17 Association. That showed numbers in terms of gross 18 expenditure. 19 10179 On that basis, Canada fairly 20 consistently ranked seventh in the world. However, 21 that's the size of our economy so that's kind of where 22 we should rank. WITSA is currently adjusting that 23 report to include per capita ratios 24 10180 When you switch to per capita, we 25 generally rank about third in the world. If, for StenoTran 2370 1 example, you take total expenditures on information and 2 communications technologies in the economy, we are 3 seventh. Per capita we are third behind the United 4 States and Japan. Yes, we will get some of that 5 comparative information for you. 6 10181 The concern that we have at the 7 moment, and it's early to get on a soapbox and talk 8 about it but it's not too early to start seriously 9 thinking about it, the trend is that our standing on a 10 per capita basis is declining. It's tending down, not 11 up. Early signals say that we may actually have a 12 problem, but at the moment no, we are ranked generally 13 about third in penetration rates and usage rates and 14 what not. 15 10182 We will get some of those statistics 16 for you. 17 10183 COMMISSIONER GRAUER: Thank you very 18 much. 19 10184 THE CHAIRPERSON: Commissioner 20 Pennefather. 21 10185 COMMISSIONER PENNEFATHER: Thanks. 22 10186 I just wanted to clarify a couple of 23 things. The list of uses of the Internet that you read 24 to us, those were transactions? In other words, is 25 that an activity that using the Internet to purchase? StenoTran 2371 1 10187 MR. DUNCAN: That's correct. These 2 were purchases in the months of August and September by 3 Canadian adults. 4 10188 COMMISSIONER PENNEFATHER: So the 5 music reference was to the purchase of a disc or 6 record, not listening to the music. 7 10189 MR. DUNCAN: That's correct, but I 8 don't know that level of detail. If there was the 9 ability to purchase a soft copy, that would have been 10 included as well, but that was not listening. These 11 were actual purchases. 12 10190 COMMISSIONER PENNEFATHER: My other 13 question was in your written submission, you refer to 14 Canadian cultural materials on the Internet. What did 15 you mean by cultural materials? It is in reference to 16 the proliferation and success of Canadian cultural 17 materials of considerable importance to the culture 18 halls of Canada and the contribution. You go on, as 19 you did this morning, to talk about the best way to 20 promote this material. 21 10191 I am just curious what you meant by 22 cultural material. 23 10192 MR. DUNCAN: All forms of Canadian 24 content. It includes access to the library, the 25 museum, to books, to literature, to music to what we StenoTran 2372 1 will be getting, versions of live theatre, this. 2 10193 COMMISSIONER PENNEFATHER: Right. 3 10194 MR. DUNCAN: This. Well, this is 4 live theatre. I would rank it also as entertainment. I 5 don't think you come under music, games and movies. 6 10195 COMMISSIONER PENNEFATHER: Thank you 7 very much for those clarifications. 8 10196 MR. DUNCAN: Okay. 9 10197 THE CHAIRPERSON: Counsel Pinsky. 10 10198 MS PINSKY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 11 10199 As part of the framework that you 12 have proposed that government adopt, you have indicated 13 that you considered that the CRTC and/or various 14 government departments should focus on framework issues 15 such as privacy and consumer protection. 16 10200 Do you have any particular consumer 17 protection issues that you consider ought to be 18 addressed? 19 10201 MR. DUNCAN: Yes. It's a 20 jurisdictional issue. It's currently a hot debate. 21 10202 On the Internet, if I purchase a 22 product -- let's pick from Cuba just to be difficult -- 23 do the consumer protection laws of Cuba or of Canada 24 apply? What are my rights of redress and what if the 25 product never arrives? That's a framework issue. StenoTran 2373 1 10203 There are arguments saying that 2 Canadian consumer protection laws should apply. That 3 causes huge issues with the vendors. There are 4 arguments that the Cuban laws should apply and that 5 causes equally huge issues with regard to consumers. 6 10204 I don't have a solution. I do 7 believe internationally we have to negotiate and find a 8 solution. 9 10205 The other day I suggested that since 10 I am likely to be paying for that purchase with my 11 credit card, why don't we just foist the problem on to 12 the bank. Not unreasonable. 13 10206 Livent went under the other day. 14 There was a lovely large headline that said \"If you had 15 purchased your tickets directly from Livent or 16 TicketMaster or anywhere else with cash, you were out 17 of luck, but if you purchased with Visa or MasterCard, 18 you got your money back\". 19 10207 It seems to me that's a model for 20 saying the consumer protection issue really is a matter 21 between me and my credit card issuer and it's up to the 22 credit card issuer to figure out what jurisdiction it 23 rests with vis-Ã -vis the supplier. 24 10208 It's not an unreasonable idea. It's 25 a little radical, but they have got deeper pockets than StenoTran 2374 1 I do. 2 10209 MS PINSKY: Thank you. 3 10210 When will you be in a position to 4 file each of the IDC stats and the WITSA stats? 5 10211 MR. DUNCAN: The WITSA study we can 6 deliver today. The other statistics, please give me 7 some time. We will have to go back and do some 8 digging. 9 10212 MS PINSKY: I think the Independent 10 Data Corps. 11 10213 MR. DUNCAN: That's tendered. 12 10214 MS PINSKY: You have them with you. 13 Okay. No problem today. Thank you. 14 10215 The other ones you can perhaps 15 indicate to us a specific date when you would intend 16 them to file them so for the public record other 17 parties will know. 18 10216 MR. DUNCAN: Okay. 19 10217 MS PINSKY: Thank you. 20 10218 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you, counsel. 21 10219 Thank you very much, Mr. Duncan. We 22 appreciate your presence here today. 23 10220 MR. DUNCAN: My pleasure. 24 10221 THE CHAIRPERSON: We will take our 25 morning break now and reconvene at a quarter to eleven. StenoTran 2375 1 --- Short recess at 1034 / Courte suspension Ã 1034 2 --- Upon resuming at 1050 / Reprise Ã 1050 3 10222 THE CHAIRPERSON: We will return to 4 our proceeding now. 5 10223 Madam Secretary, the next party. 6 10224 MS BÃNARD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 7 10225 The next presentation will be by the 8 Internet Advertising Bureau of Canada, l'bureau de la 9 publicite internet. 10 PRESENTATION / PRÃSENTATION 11 10226 MR. BOYD: Good morning. 12 10227 Mr. Chairperson, members of the 13 Commission, my name is Ted Boyd and I am the Vice-Chair 14 of the Internet Advertising Bureau of Canada. In 15 addition, I am the VP Director of New Media 16 Technologies at Young & Rubicam. On behalf of the 17 members of IAB Canada, thank you for the opportunity to 18 appear before you today. On my left is Gary Anderson, 19 General Manager, Internet Business Development at 20 Medialinx Interactive, and on my right is Graham Duffy, 21 President of CANOE. Both Gary and Graham are IAB 22 Canada Directors. 23 10228 Let me begin by introducing IAB 24 Canada. We are a non-profit volunteer organization, 25 comprised of advertisers, agencies and Internet StenoTran 2376 1 publishers. IAB Canada is the national advocate for 2 marketing and advertising on the Internet. We also 3 aspire to bring structure and standards to the on-line 4 advertising industry in Canada. To this end, IAB 5 Canada is the only body in Canada that has taken upon 6 itself the task of researching the Canadian on-line 7 advertising industry. For the purpose of these 8 hearings, the views of IAB Canada are significant in 9 that they reflect shared opinions of a wide range of 10 stakeholders who frequently share differing views on 11 many other subjects. This agreement stems from a 12 common recognition of the needs of on-line advertising 13 and the benefits it offers Canadian new media. 14 10229 Before proceeding further, it is 15 important to first describe what IAB Canada understands 16 new media to mean for purposes of this presentation. 17 First, IAB Canada is only addressing the issue of 18 regulation of the Internet and is not to be taken to 19 have made any comments regarding new media content that 20 may be delivered by some other delivery mechanism such 21 as CD-ROM or DVD-ROM. 22 10230 Second, IAB Canada notes that the 23 development of the Internet results from the union of 24 two distinct sectors. The first, new media 25 infrastructure, consists of the routers, protocols and StenoTran 2377 1 transmission paths that make up the Internet. In other 2 words, it is the roadways and traffic signals that make 3 up the information highway. 4 10231 The second, new media content and 5 services, consists of the video, audio, graphic and 6 textual content that is carried over the new media 7 infrastructure. Using that familiar information 8 highway analogy again, it comprises the vehicles that 9 travel on the highway. For purposes of these 10 proceedings, IAB Canada takes no position on the 11 regulation of new media infrastructure and my comments 12 here today should be understood to apply only to new 13 media content and services. 14 10232 Given this focus, IAB Canada observes 15 that new media and on-line advertising are 16 demonstrating a mutually supporting relationship. As 17 the Internet grows it attracts an increasing number of 18 advertisers. As advertising revenue is injected, 19 further growth of the Internet is encouraged. IAB 20 Canada's latest research indicates that Web-based 21 advertising revenues in Canada continue to double from 22 $9.5 million in 1997 to $8.0 million in just the first 23 half of 1998. This growth is forecast to continue with 24 revenues expected to total $20.7 million in 1998 and 25 $37.7 million in 1999. Notably, this advertising is StenoTran 2378 1 not being driven primarily by computer-related goods 2 and services. Traditional consumer goods and services 3 companies are being drawn to this new medium, with 4 companies from the financial services sector 5 contributing the most. 6 10233 I would like now to address the area 7 of regulation of new media in general. To appreciate 8 IAB Canada's position on regulation, it will be useful 9 to examine, in a very crude way, advertising dynamics 10 and Internet economic reality. At its most basic, 11 advertising dollars will be spent where the message of 12 the advertiser can be communicated the most effectively 13 to the greatest number of people at the most reasonable 14 cost. Therefore, as more people go on-line and as 15 technical improvements permit more creativity in the 16 crafting of messages, more and more advertisers are 17 being drawn to the Internet. 18 10234 Perhaps not unexpectedly, the sites 19 that attract the greatest number of visitors are also 20 attracting the greatest amount of on-line advertising 21 revenue. 22 10235 With respect to Internet economics, 23 as others have described and will describe in greater 24 detail, there are only a few ways to generate revenues 25 over the Internet; subscription, pay per use, StenoTran 2379 1 e-commerce transactions, sponsorship and advertising. 2 Very few commercial Web sites are able to operate 3 successfully without the assistance of advertising. 4 Any that seek to offer universal access to their site, 5 other than purely transactional sites, must have 6 advertising or sponsorship to be commercially viable. 7 That suggests that the healthy and competitive growth 8 of Canadian new media is inextricably linked to a 9 healthy and competitive on-line advertising industry. 10 10236 Now, let's consider the potential 11 impact of regulation on this dynamic relationship. As 12 many others in these proceedings have observed, the 13 Internet is indeed a global medium. It is not 14 technically possible to restrict Canadians from 15 accessing content that originates elsewhere. It is 16 also not possible to keep content developers from 17 moving their operations to other jurisdictions or to 18 require service providers that cater to Canadians to be 19 based in Canada. In addition, other jurisdictions, 20 most notably the United States, have taken a regulatory 21 hands off approach to the Internet. 22 10237 As a result, the imposition of 23 regulation in Canada that adds costs or administrative 24 burdens or that causes delays in implementing business 25 strategies will encourage content developers or StenoTran 2380 1 distributors to establish operations elsewhere, most 2 likely in the United States. If this content is 3 available from the United States, then Canadians will 4 visit these American sites to locate the content they 5 seek. The more that Canadians visit these sites, the 6 more attractive they will become to Canadian 7 advertisers. 8 10238 As a result, Canadian advertising 9 dollars will flow out of the country along with the 10 content and distributors, making it difficult for 11 remaining Canadian sites to attract the necessary 12 revenues to operate. Even in the existing environment, 13 almost 70 per cent of participants in IAB Canada's 14 Internet Advertising Survey are aware that Canadian 15 advertising dollars are being spent in the United 16 States. 17 10239 I don't wish to be seen as 18 overstating the case. Even in light of regulation, 19 some companies will, of course, choose to remain in 20 Canada and, presumably, some will develop content that 21 is sufficiently attractive that Canadians will visit 22 and thereby attract some of the advertising budgets of 23 Canadians advertisers. But this is not enough. I 24 believe all of us participating in these proceedings, 25 including the Commission itself, are interested in the StenoTran 2381 1 development of a thriving Canadian new media industry 2 that materially contributes to the economic and social 3 fabric of the country. IAB Canada, and clearly many 4 others in these proceedings, believe that this cannot 5 happen if the regulatory environment actively 6 encourages industry participants to operate elsewhere. 7 10240 Accordingly, IAB Canada endorses the 8 position that the CRTC not regulate the Internet. 9 10241 I would now like to take a moment to 10 address the potential introduction of new regulations 11 on Internet advertising in particular. However, rather 12 than explore the negative economic impacts of this, 13 which are similar to those just discussed, I would like 14 to turn this issue on its head. Rather than ask \"why 15 not regulate?\", IAB Canada suggests that the proper 16 question is \"why regulate?\" 17 10242 Regulation should, of course, be 18 designed to address some perceived problem or abuse. 19 To the knowledge of IAB Canada, nothing has been 20 introduced in these proceedings to suggest there are 21 any issues that cannot be addressed within the present 22 framework. Existing legislation, such as the 23 Competition Act and the Trade-Marks Act, offer 24 comprehensive regimes that are directly applicable to 25 the Internet. StenoTran 2382 1 10243 In addition, the advertising industry 2 has been very effective in self-regulation and will 3 continue to be so. Codes of conduct, complaint systems 4 and accepted dispute resolution mechanisms have been 5 developed by the advertising industry and function very 6 effectively. 7 10244 As one example of the industry itself 8 addressing important issues, IAB Canada is working with 9 the industry to develop standardized measurement 10 criteria to ensure that ad performance can be 11 adequately analyzed and compared. This will make it 12 far easier to advertisers to justify Internet 13 advertising expenditures and, thereby, attract the 14 revenues that the new media needs to grow. 15 10245 The last matter I would like to 16 discuss is the type of support needed to help the new 17 media industry and the on-line advertising industry to 18 grow. I will not be proposing any specific mechanisms, 19 but, instead, will identify the kinds of support that 20 IAB Canada sees as necessary. 21 10246 At a very general level, IAB Canada 22 supports any initiative that encourages the production 23 of Canadian Web content. Given what I have said 24 previously regarding the negative incentives flowing 25 from regulation, a clear policy statement from the StenoTran 2383 1 government that it is committed to an unregulated 2 environment would encourage investment in Canada. 3 Other types of support may be more proactive, including 4 tax credits or accelerated depreciation periods, 5 grants, loans or lines of credit. 6 10247 Advertising on the Web, which, as I 7 suggested earlier, is necessary to achieve universal 8 access, would be encouraged by ensuring a level playing 9 field with other media. Some program to provide 10 on-line advertisers with the same encouragement as 11 offered in section 19 of the Income Tax Act would be 12 extremely beneficial. Ensuring that appropriate 13 research is conducted will also be invaluable to 14 produces, publishers and advertisers. Accordingly, IAB 15 Canada would greatly appreciate the assistance of 16 StatsCan or Strategis in performing such research. 17 10248 Finally, assistance is required in 18 the training and retention of competent personnel to 19 stem the costs of talent migrating to the U.S. This 20 assistance should not be restricted to content creators 21 but also marketing professionals, since the success of 22 the industry is largely dependent upon its ability to 23 market itself to Canadians and indeed to the world. 24 Programs that could encourage this might include labour 25 tax credits, tax incentives for training programs and StenoTran 2384 1 funding or support for intern or mentor programs. 2 10249 These kinds of support for new media 3 are important. As an industry in its infancy, it 4 requires all the support possible to acquire the 5 strength it will need to compete. For that growth and 6 strength to be acquired, and for new media to be 7 universally accessible, new media must receive the 8 support of a strong and healthy advertising community. 9 If the Commission has any questions about how IAB 10 Canada feels that can be accomplished in addition to 11 the comments I have made, I will be happy to answer 12 them. We thank you for your consideration of our 13 comments here today. 14 10250 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much 15 for your presentation. 16 10251 I will turn the questioning to 17 Commissioner Wilson. 18 10252 COMMISSIONER WILSON: Good morning, 19 gentlemen. Thank you for being with us this morning. 20 10253 As you probably are aware, there has 21 been a lot of discussion about the role of advertising 22 on the Internet in this new environment, not only from 23 the point of view of finding viable business models for 24 new media, but more importantly for us I think in terms 25 of the examination that we are doing here as an StenoTran 2385 1 indicator of just how significant this medium will be 2 for the country on a going forward basis. 3 10254 What I would like to do is start by 4 reviewing some of the information that you provided in 5 your written submission, following by a couple of 6 questions about the data that you presented which was 7 prepared by Ernst and Young. Then, I would like to 8 pose some questions, some more general questions to you 9 about advertising that have arisen out of submissions 10 made by other parties and just try and get your views 11 and solicit your expertise in that area. 12 10255 The first thing I want to do though 13 is ask you about your organization because I know that 14 you have said that it's a young organization. When was 15 it founded? 16 10256 MR. BOYD: In its current form, 17 December of last year. 18 10257 COMMISSIONER WILSON: So almost a 19 year old? 20 10258 MR. BOYD: That's correct. 21 10259 COMMISSIONER WILSON: How many 22 members do you have? 23 10260 MR. BOYD: We have 32 members now, 24 which while in absolute terms may seem small is highly 25 representative of the industry, in that we are a StenoTran 2386 1 tripartite organization representing publishers, 2 advertising agencies and advertisers. We include on 3 that list organizations such as CANOE, Simpatico, the 4 Globe and Mail, Southam and agencies such as Young & 5 Rubicam, McLaren and McCann, advertisers such as Molson 6 and so on. So, we are fairly representative of the 7 industry and "
