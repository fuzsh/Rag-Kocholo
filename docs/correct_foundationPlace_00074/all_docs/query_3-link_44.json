When an emergency incident occurs in a hazardous location, the system goes into muster mode. A Hazardous Location is a defined area that can have multiple entry and exit card readers. When the system is in muster mode, mustering out of a hazardous location area and into a safe location area is required. A Safe Location is a defined area with muster readers that are configured to be used in the event of an emergency incident.
