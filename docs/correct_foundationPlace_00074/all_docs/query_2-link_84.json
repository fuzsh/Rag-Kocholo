Our vast customer base allows Evercom to keep a finger on the pulse of the Corrections industry, thus allowing us to identify trends in inmate calling and adapt to a constantly evolving telecommunications industry. J II:> EVE ReOM EXECUTIVE SUMMARY A SUBSIDIARY OF SECURUS TECHNOLOGIES SUPERIOR SECURITY THROUGH TECHNOLOGY Evercom's commitment to technology is more than just words. As a technology company, we proudly hold 44 inmate·calling patents. Among the many technological advances we have made to our Inmate Phone System, there are a few that clearly differentiate us from the competition. Superior Security through Technology - 3· Way Call Detect/on - Proven voice biometrics - Automated Remote Monitoring • Word Search Our IPS is internally designed, built and supported by Evercom employees. Evercom believes its role in Corrections is more than a provider of inmate calling services, we are more than the typical collection of computer servers, telephone lines, and a commission check offered by other companies. We view our applications as comprehensive law enforcement tools that we constantly adapt to meet the next opportunity presented by the challenging correctional environment. Our internally developed and patented law enforcement tools will provide the Arizona DOC with the following functionalities that go beyond the capabilities of other systems: • 3-Way Call Detection (U.S. Patent #5,319,702) While it is true that 3-way Call Detection provided by other vendors may be an imprecise technology that does not prevent inmates from accessing the numbers that would normally be blocked such as victims or witnesses. Evercom's patented 3-Way Call Detection provides a proven, patented technology that performs almost flawlessly. No other vendor can claim a proven, patented solution for this most common fraud type. Our technology prevents telephone abuse and harassment of witnesses and other parties involved in criminal prosecution and protects the community from fraudulent, threatening, or harassing calls. Our technology team has just deployed an enhanced 3-Way Call Detection process that is providing extremely precise detection of 3-Way Call attempts and we have eliminated the ability of the inmate to mask the 3-Way Call attempt by corrupting the channel though noise diversion, such as blowing into the phone handset during the 3-Way attempt. • Recording and Monitoring The Inmate Phone System is extremely user friendly because the recording and monitoring applications are fully integrated into our system to allow for ease of use. The system also allows for immediate, real-time live monitoring • Advanced Recording & Monitoring Features - Web-based application to actively obtain Information about people, places, things, and events from a wide array of public and private data sources • Integration capabilities & experience ) ,.- 'C '-'.

This application displays concise descriptions of activity for each phone. The Investigative Reports Application allows quick and easy access to call detail records and call recordings. The IPS also allows for any specific telephone number to be marked as \"Private,\" which prevents the call from being recorded, and prohibits monitoring of the call. This is to address calls of a privileged nature which may include attorneys, medical personnel or clergy. The Evercom solution will enable DOC staff to anticipate and effectively respond to many intelligence gathering based requirements and provides the ability for authorized users to remotely dial In by desktop, or perhaps a laptop, and access the call data in that manner. Investigators In the field would have the ability to retrieve call data and monitor calls. This feature is perfect for use in surveillance-type operations or lengthy field investigative actions, where confidentiality is paramount to the success of the operation. ) ) • Covert alert Providing real-time mobility to enhance investigator efficiency, Covert Alert is an integrated IPS feature that enables automated remote forwarding of flagged inmate calls to an investigators' telephone for remote monitoringno matter where the investigator Is located. This feature will allow your facility's investigators to \"multi-task\", even off-site, without the risk of missing important investigative information. This mobility means increased productivity and greater operating efficiencies for the Arizona DOC. • Scan Patrol This exclusive Evercom feature allows an investigator to listen to customizable number of seconds of a call in progress and then moves on to the next call, bypassing any inactive line. This feature enables an investor to efficiently sample calls without the burden of manually selecting each individual call. When the investigator hears something in a conversation that is of interest, he or she just clicks on the call in progress to move it into full time monitoring mode. Further, facility personnel can forward a live call to an outside number for monitoring without alerting the inmate or called party. :;tb~~~~Efd~~~~Jt1~~~,~@~~~~~~tl~~~1'ci;<\",.

This solution makes it possible for the investigators to search for and replay specific words or phrases within audiO recordings. • SECUREvoice ™ System The Evercom IPS provides as an optional feature SECUREvolce™ inmate telecommunication identification service as a powerful method of biometric authentication of a person's identity. Compared to other biometric techniques it is quick, natural, non-intrusive, method of identifying the exact inmate placing each call. SECUREvoice™ is based on the realization that each person's voice contains a unique signature, which cannot be imitated. As a means of identification, a person's voice is as reliable as a fingerprint. Evercom first implemented SECUREvoice™ in 1999 and each month performs more than 2.2 million voice verifications on inmate calls. SECUREvoice™ would provide a much greater security level for the Arizona DOC's new Inmate Phone System by preventing PIN sharing, ensuring inmates are accountable for their actions when placing calls. • Electronic Dragnet Electronic Dragnet is a Web-based data search application that allows users to utilize centralized database repositories including hundreds of data pOints from our 3100+ facilities and state of the art technologies in order to assist investigators in their quest to protect citizens of the State of Arizona and the United States.

Traditionally collect calling has dominated inmate communications and more recently inmate collect calling has been complemented by the addition of prepaid and debit calling. Evercom offers a comprehensive program that Includes collect prepaid and debit calling options. We view our mission as a conduit for secure communications between inmates and their friends and families. In order for us to be most successful In our mission, we need to both complete more traditional collect, debit, and prepaid calls to maximize the existing calling base, as well as, to create new communication opportunities which will result in new revenue opportunities.

Any time a new telephone number is called, that call will be allowed to complete, even for customers that historically have not been allowed to complete a call cause of the inability to bill the call to talk to the inmate for a limited duration. Both parties are informed during the call that future calls will not be permitted unless the called party makes the appropriate billing arrangements and we provide the information about how to set up billing during the call. Quickconnect - Quick Connect is scheduled for introduction in early 2007 and will allow friends and family to have calls completed to various numbers e.g. home, work, cellular (if permitted), etc. If there is no answer at the number dialed the system automatically calls the next number designated by the account holder. A call detail record will be created from the inmate's phone to the number that is ultimately contacted regardless of the initial dialed number to preserve the Integrity of any security investigations and to ensure accurate billing. Accountconnect - Account Connect is a combination of several programs that enable end users to establish a new account or access information on their existing account 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year.
