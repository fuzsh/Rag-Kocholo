        "text": "LEADTOOLS supports reading and writing of the following 1-bit formats that are commonly used in FAX transmissions:\n\nTIFF\n\nTIFF CCITT. These are compressed TIFF files that are commonly used for FAX transmission and document imaging.\n\nTIFF CCITT Group 3. These are TIFF CCITT files in a format that is more advanced and more compressed than TIFF CCITT. LEADTOOLS supports both 1-dimension and 2-dimension variations of this format.\n\nTIFF CCITT Group 4. These are TIFF CCITT files in a format that is more advanced and more compressed than TIFF CCITT Group 3.\n\nTIFF Class F. Class-F is the TIFF extension for fax documents. LEADTOOLS supports Class-F compatible tags.\n\nRegions are saved automatically inside TIFF files. For more information, refer to Saving a Region. Note, however, that the ability to save a region inside a TIFF file must be unlocked. This requires a Document Imaging or Medical Imaging toolkit.\n\nFor more information refer to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF).\n\nCALS\n\nCALS Raster(Type 1, 2, 3, and 4). These are CCITT Group 4 CALS raster files. CALS is a United States government standard. CALS3 are multipage files.\n\nThis format does not support regions.\n\nThe file constants associated with this file format are:\n\nConstant\n\nRead Support\n\nWrite Support\n\nDescription\n\nCals\n\n1 BPP\n\n1 BPP\n\nCALS Raster file.\n\nCals2\n\n1 BPP\n\n1 BPP\n\nCALS CCITT G4 compressed.\n\nCals3\n\n1 BPP\n\n1 BPP\n\nCALS Fax Group 4 compressed.\n\nCals4\n\n1 BPP\n\n1 BPP\n\nCALS CCITT G4 Tiled.\n\nRequired DLL: Leadtools.Codecs.Cal.Dll. For a listing of the exact DLLs needed, based on the toolkit version, refer to Files To Be Included With Your Application .\n\nSee table below\n\nIOCA\n\nIOCA (ICA). This is the Image Object Content Architecture developed by IBM. LEADTOOLS supports these files in an MO:DCA wrapper with embedded 1-bit CCITT Group 3 or Group 4 images. LEADTOOLS also supports IOCA files without an MO:DCA wrapper.\n\nFor more information refer to Image Object Content Architecture Format (IOCA/MODCA).\n\nWinFax\n\nWinFax Group 3. This is a FAX format created by Delrina for Group 3 support.\n\nWinFax Group 4. This is a FAX format created by Delrina for Group 4 support.\n\nThe file constants associated with this file format are:\n\nConstant Read Support Write Support Description TifxJbig 1 BPP 1 BPP TIFF-FX format.
