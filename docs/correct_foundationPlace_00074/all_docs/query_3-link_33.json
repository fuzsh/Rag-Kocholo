        "text": "Make tough decisions when it comes to your products.\n\nExecutive Brief\n\nAnalyst perspective\n\nCorporations face the pivotal decision of acquiring, expanding, or discontinuing product lines in the dynamic business arena.\n\nThe expansion strategy involves either forming new alliances or creating products from scratch. This method allows for greater customization and oversight but also requires a significant investment of time, expertise, and financial resources.\n\nOn the other hand, the acquisition strategy is often product-centric, with companies sourcing components from select partners. This approach enhances the integration process and meets the demands of discerning buyers who prefer partners that provide a broad range of services, including cloud solutions, technical assistance, integration, education, and ongoing support.\n\nThe discontinuation strategy is employed when a product line fails to meet its expected value or return on investment, prompting companies to sever ties and reallocate resources to more lucrative endeavors.\n\nTo adeptly maneuver through these strategies, firms must employ a rigorous self-evaluation process to pinpoint their strategic goals and source products that align with them. A versatile framework for product evaluation and selection is critical, particularly when addressing the needs of exacting customers. This strategic mindset is essential for companies to remain nimble, make well-informed choices, and maintain a competitive edge in their swiftly changing sectors.\n\nJoanne Morin Correia\n\nPrincipal Research Analyst, Marketing Advisory\n\nInfo-Tech Research Group\n\nExecutive summary\n\nPain Points\n\nProduct roadmap plans require decisive, hard choices that may involve cutting losses or redirecting resources for the company's greater good.\n\nObjective decision-making in product roadmaps is often clouded by personal bias that hinders alignment with company strategy.\n\nProduct roadmap decisions are complex. Insufficient strategic frameworks impact lifecycle management.\n\nConsumer preferences overlooked: A lack of insight into buyer preferences leads to misinformed product development and neglected market needs.\n\nObstacles\n\nMarket competition and changing business models limit time for in-depth evaluation and fact-based decision-making for future product planning.\n\nExecutive decision-makers demonstrate a resistance to reflect and adopt a framework for appraisals.\n\nSenior development executives hesitate to integrate external partners into their strategic planning, instead relying on internal capabilities.\n\nUndisclosed product-related financials and critical metrics hinder the due diligence required for well-informed decisions.\n\nInfo-Tech's Approach\n\nUpgrade decision-making acumen by integrating contemporary methodologies and analytics, transitioning from speculative to data-driven strategies.\n\nPerform a thorough self-review to pinpoint necessities for achieving business objectives.\n\nEmploy a structured assessment method to gauge company competencies and identify potential obstacles and opportunities.\n\nYield well-prioritized, strategically-aligned product choices with business goals for products, services, or revenue generation activities.\n\nTip!\n\nCEOs should rigorously assess internal needs and evaluate product roadmaps to minimize strategic errors,\n\ncontrol development costs, and speed up growth realization.\n\nProduct roadmaps are for tough decisions\n\nHalting or altering a product line is challenging and requires an unbiased, objective framework to accomplish effectively.\n\nA strategic product roadmap, rooted in deep self-analysis and comprehensive external assessment, is essential for aligning with customer value and driving business success.\n\nSuch evaluations are crucial for aligning the company's product portfolio with its financial objectives and market needs.\n\nThe roadmap must be laser-focused on delivering value to customers by meticulously selecting and defining products or partnerships that propel the business toward its goals.\n\nA product line's success and longevity hinge on the collective value it provides to all stakeholders involved.\n\nA strategic product roadmap is a plan that outlines a product's vision, direction, and progression over time. It is a strategic document that connects a product's future to the organization's high-level strategic goals.\n\nA strategic product roadmap is…\n\nA strategic product roadmap is not…\n\nGuiding: It guides teams to understand the product's lifecycle and the steps required to accomplish the roadmap.\n\nFlexible: It is adaptable to change, as it must account for market shifts, technological advancements, and customer feedback.\n\nValue focused: It aligns product development with customer needs and business objectives, emphasizing value creation.\n\nDispassionate and data driven: It relies on objective data and analytics rather than subjective opinions.\n\nFixed: It is not a rigid schedule or a commitment to specific features or dates, as this would limit its adaptability.\n\nProduct specification: It doesn't include detailed specifications of features or technical design documents. It's a strategic tool that prioritizes based on strategic value rather than just operational efficiency.\n\nOnly for developers: It is not a document exclusively for the Development team; it should be understood across the organization.\n\nWhat stops companies from managing their product decisions?\n\nExecutives can manage product decisions successfully when they can overcome critical obstacles and pain points.\n\n\"What's keeping your teams from achieving their goals?\n\nIs outdated technology holding you back?\n\nDisparate tooling?\n\nIs it your process?\n\nLack of visibility and alignment?\n\nOr, are you stuck in a stage of analysis paralysis because you don't know what your customers want?\"\n\nSource: Cprime, 2022\n\nState product roadmap goals clearly\n\nA product roadmap can have many goals depending on the organization's objectives and the product's purpose. Some of these goals include:\n\nStrategy description: A product roadmap can describe the product's vision, helping the product team take strategic initiatives.\n\nStrategy execution: A product team may curate a product roadmap to outline guidelines for executing its strategy.\n\nStakeholder alignment: A product roadmap can align all internal stakeholders.\n\nExternal stakeholder alignment: A product roadmap can help the team communicate with customers and other external stakeholders.\n\nDiscussion facilitation: A product roadmap can facilitate scenario planning and other discussions by getting everyone on the same page.\n\nA product roadmap is a visual summary of the priorities, direction, progress, and vision surrounding a product over a specific time frame. It is a plan aligning the organization's short-term and long-term goals.\n\nAvoid common product decision gaps\n\nVision\n\nLeadership\n\nProduct lifecycle management\n\nValue realization\n\nFocusing solely on backlog grooming (tactical only)\n\nFailing to align product roadmap to enterprise goals\n\nNeglecting operational support and execution\n\nMaking decisions based on opinion rather than market data\n\nIgnoring or missing internal and external threats to your product\n\nFailing to include feedback from all teams who interact with your product\n\nUsing a command-and-control approach\n\nViewing product owner as only a delivery role\n\nActing as a proxy for stakeholder decisions\n\nAvoiding tough strategic decisions in favor of easier tactical choices\n\nFocusing on delivery and not the full product lifecycle\n\nIgnoring support, operations, and technical debt\n\nFailing to build knowledge management into the lifecycle\n\nUnderestimating delivery capacity, capabilities, or commitment\n\nAssuming delivery stops at implementation\n\nFocusing exclusively on on-time/on-budget metrics\n\nFailing to measure a 360-degree end-user view of the product\n\nSkipping business plans and financial models\n\nLimiting financial management to project/change budgets\n\nIgnoring market analysis for growth, penetration, and threats\n\nOptimize for faster decisions and risk management\n\nMaking a product's lifecycle decisions underscores the importance of cross-departmental collaboration and strategic risk assessment in the product roadmap. Accurate cost estimation, informed decision-making, and rapid market entry should all be emphasized.\n\nEnhanced integration cost projections: The financial implications of product integrations often elude businesses. A dedicated team should be mandated to provide nuanced insights into the compatibility of varying systems, enabling more precise projections of the time, resources, and financials required, thereby setting more grounded expectations for the business.\n\nOptimized decision-making process: By ensuring the representation of all relevant departments at the strategic discussion table, a diverse array of information can be exchanged swiftly and effectively. This approach is critical to facilitating expedited, accurate decision-making and streamlining the path from concept to execution.\n\nStrategic risk management: Through a refined process where partners delineate potential risks with greater specificity, the business can achieve a higher level of precision in forecasting risk-related costs. This enables the development of comprehensive internal and external business strategies and risk mitigation plans.\n\nAccelerated market entry: Improve the partner evaluation process to create synergy among all business functions, which is crucial for swifter integration. Begin integration planning before finalizing deals to enter the market seamlessly and quickly while maintaining competitive agility in the product lifecycle.\n\n\"Complacency is the enemy of growth. That is why companies pursue adjacent and breakout business opportunities. What sets outperformers apart is that they do it discerningly.\n\nC-suite leaders who pursue adjacent businesses where they have a 'right-to-win' by leveraging unique capabilities and customer or value chain connections position their companies to generate the strongest shareholder returns.\"\n\nSource: McKinsey & Company, 2023\n\nMeasure a product's success by its ability to support business goals and timelines.\n\nUpper management measures a product's success based on how it supports the underlying reasons for the business change.

Even without formal authority, they may have informal yet substantive relationships with your stakeholders.\n\nSee also: Mature and Scale Product Ownership\n\nClearly state and agree on goals before assessment.\n\nYou won't have a clear vision for the product if every stakeholder has a different objective.\n\nEach goal must contribute to a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the product's position and competitiveness in the market.\n\nProduct portfolio adjustment: Assess the viability of expanding or consolidating the product lineup through strategic alliances or discontinuations.\n\nResource reallocation: Evaluate and decide whether to enhance, repurpose, or phase out existing resources and partnerships based on technological, geographic, and market relevance.\n\nOperational cost efficiency: Methodically analyze and decide to share or restructure financial liabilities. Aim to enhance, outsource, or eliminate operations that do not contribute to significant cost savings.\n\nStrategic market positioning: Evaluate market reach enhancement tactics. Pinpoint products to develop, acquire, or discontinue to maximize productivity, adaptability, and overall market opportunity.\n\nCustomer-base rationalization: Evaluate your partnerships with critical organizations based on long-term value and decide whether to maintain them, dissolve them, or form new ones by expanding your customer base.\n\nCapital allocation and financial strategy: Determine which products could lead to either an infusion or a divestment of capital, depending on their potential to strengthen strategic business growth.\n\nOperational streamlining: Optimize or reduce operational costs by cosharing or fully taking on the financial responsibilities of initiatives where appropriate.\n\nMarket reach and product viability: Assess product opportunities with the aim of enhancing or streamlining the portfolio for improved productivity and business agility. This may entail discontinuing unprofitable lines to minimize opportunity costs.\n\nMetrics to consider\n\nCase study\n\nReview this company's post-investment relaunch, product roadmap, and timeline alignment.\n\nCategory\n\nEnterprise Planning\n\nHQ Location\n\nSouthern Asia\n\nRevenues\n\nLess than $20 million\n\nIndustries\n\nFinancial Services, Insurance, Public Sector, Retail & Logistics, Telecom\n\nProblem\n\nA company used funding it received in the winter of 2022 to hire a new C-suite and heads of Product Management and Marketing in the Spring of 2023.
