        "text": "The month of May is Asian Heritage Month, honouring the lives and contributions of people of Asian origin.\n\nThis year, I would like to talk about one common issue among Asians‚Äîspeaking up, or the lack thereof.\n\nHow often do you stop yourself from saying what needs to be said?\n\nOne of the biggest cultural differences that could hold Asians back is our tendency not to speak up. Since I was a kid, my parents and grandparents conditioned us to keep our heads down. Focus on your work, and as long as you do good work, your work will speak for itself.\n\nThis is all fine, except that in Western culture, certain behaviours are perceived as the norm. Leaders are expected to be vocal and own the stage.\n\nI have seen firsthand very capable Asian people not getting promoted because they don‚Äôt say much. I have seen investors criticizing Asian founders for not having a take-over-the-world demeanour. In one specific example, a founder was having trouble raising capital despite the company doing really well. An existing investor (also Asian) told me privately that the main reason was that this founder didn‚Äôt act like a typical American founder.\n\nOuch! I instantly knew what he meant.\n\nSpeaking from my own experience, it took me decades to overcome this issue. I can‚Äôt speak for other Asian cultures, but in Hong Kong, during the era when I was growing up, parents would put masking tape on a kid‚Äôs mouth if they spoke too much. My parents never did this to me because I rarely said anything. üôÇ Even today, I have to constantly push myself to speak up. On some occasions, I still err on the side of not speaking up enough because it is still very unnatural for me. Your culture stays with you for life.\n\nI can‚Äôt tell you exactly how to overcome this issue. To a degree, it has to come from within. You have to find your own way. For me, I kept telling myself I needed to err on the side of speaking up too much. Trust me, even with that, the end result is that on many occasions I still find myself thinking I could have spoken up more, even today. So, imagine if I didn‚Äôt give myself a little nudge. It took years of practice to overcome my own emotions. Eventually, I got used to it. Well, most of the time.\n\nHowever, I don‚Äôt mean to say that it is all on Asians‚Äô shoulders to overcome this. Asian or not, great leaders have the responsibility to create a safe environment for everyone to speak up in the first place.\n\nHumility and kindness are great traits in Asian culture. Keep them. It is also okay to push yourself to be more vocal. The barrier is totally breakable, especially one step at a time. You just have to keep pushing. After all, speaking up is not mutually exclusive with your heritage!\n\nP.S. This blog is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

At that time, it was common for Valley VCs to ask non-Valley companies to move to the Valley as a condition for funding.\n\nBut I told them, ‚ÄòI won‚Äôt move.‚Äô\n\nWhile their argument had a point, Valley VCs failed to see my ‚Äúbig-fish-small-pond‚Äù advantages. I don‚Äôt need to hire a million great people. After raising one of the largest funding rounds by a Canadian-based company at the time, I was absolutely sure we could hire ‚Äúenough‚Äù great people to help us build a world-class company based in one of the most populous metropolises in North America called Toronto. Paradoxically, it could even work to our advantage. As one of Toronto‚Äôs biggest fish, we could hire the best. I couldn‚Äôt say the same thing if we moved to the Valley. Besides, building a company culture with a single office location was much easier.\n\nIt was a contrarian bet that few people saw, but it was so obvious to me. In hindsight, it was clear that it was the right call.\n\nIt all worked well until it didn‚Äôt. While the Toronto ecosystem went from strength to strength during the 2010s, it also meant that the talent competition became very fierce towards the end of the decade. The small pond became a much bigger pond, and there were a lot of big fish in it, including many Valley-based companies setting up shops here.\n\nThe tipping point for me was when someone bought the old building next to Wattpad HQ. Initially, we had no idea who wanted to turn it into an office tower until Google announced that it would hire a few thousand people. Where? Right next to Wattpad HQ.\n\nMy first-mover advantage has eroded. I had to figure out a new plan to regain my big-fish-small-pond advantage.\n\nMy solution was to establish a second HQ in a less populous city with a thriving tech ecosystem and an abundance of post-secondary institutions, where we could be the big fish again and have enough talent to enable us to continue to grow rapidly. It had to be a Canadian city because I wanted a few existing Wattpad employees to relocate there to help us ‚Äúseed‚Äù the culture. It was far harder for me to pull it off if it was cross-border.\n\nI toured around the country. I was impressed by what I saw. There were a handful of cities that met our criteria. I knew we could make it work.\n\nAt that time, I was already very familiar with Halifax, having been involved in the local ecosystem for a while. While there, I took advantage of the opportunity to grab dinner with Jevon McDonald, whom I had known for a few years. Nothing compares to talking to a local guru.\n\nJevon gave me the rundown of all the nuances I couldn‚Äôt find on Google search. But when I asked him to name one thing that he didn‚Äôt like about Halifax, this was our conversation:\n\nJevon: ‚ÄúI have a few employees in San Francisco. Going there is very painful as I have to catch a 5am flight to connect through Toronto first.‚Äù\n\nMe: ‚ÄúSo, there is no direct flight from Halifax to SF?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNope.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs a short flight between Toronto and Halifax. There are numerous daily flights between the two cities, so day trips are super easy. However, the lack of direct flights to the Valley means Valley-based companies won‚Äôt show up any time soon. An unfair disadvantage became my unfair advantage. The lack of direct flights became my talent moat.\n\nThe rest is history. Wattpad established its second HQ in Halifax. We hired a lot of fantastic people there. I have been the biggest champion of Atlantic Canada ever since, as I have encouraged other Toronto-based companies to do the same.\n\nIt was another contrarian bet that few people saw, but it was so obvious to me. It was the right call.\n\nThese are just a couple of examples. There were many more that Wattpad did, like establishing a movie studio or investing in something unproven called AI more than a decade ago.\n\nSimilarly, some of our best investments in Two Small Fish Ventures, such as Sheertex or BenchSci, had a very tough time raising capital early on because very few people saw what we saw.\n\nOf course, I am not suggesting that one should be contrarian for the sake of being contrarian. But when a contrarian bet results in a first-mover advantage in a big opportunity that no one else saw, that will almost always generate an amazing outcome with outsized returns.\n\nDon‚Äôt tell anyone.\n\nP.S.

When I was Wattpad‚Äôs CEO, we didn‚Äôt just talk about diversity or run flashy programs just to make us look good. Instead, we invested in it. We allocated real resources, dollars, and people‚Äôs time to create a truly diverse and inclusive culture at Wattpad.\n\nThe business reason was simple ‚Äì half the world‚Äôs population is female. If we want to properly capture this market, do you really think a bunch of male guys in the room can figure this out?\n\nThe end result is that we achieved gender parity at BOTH the employee level and the leadership team level. However, the numbers don‚Äôt tell the whole story. Anyone who worked for Wattpad can testify that we have created a truly inclusive culture.\n\nPersonally, I would consider this one of our biggest achievements.\n\nBut that was only the first chapter of the story. At Two Small Fish Ventures, we carry the same DNA. It was mostly Eva‚Äôs work, as I only started to be more involved in recent years. Through inspiration, advocacy, and mentorship, we achieved 50% female founders in our portfolio. In fact, many of our rocket ships are female-led.\n\nOur job is not done yet. Together, we can change how the world operates.\n\nP.S. This blog is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Although CFOs may be responsible for much of the heavy lifting, keep in mind that CEOs‚Äô job #1 is to communicate vision and strategies to all stakeholders, which certainly includes potential and existing investors. It is very hard to raise capital to build a great company without great storytelling skills, something almost all great CEOs possess.\n\nClearly communicating a bold vision is especially important for early-stage venture-backed companies. These companies are usually pre-revenue, pre-product-market-fit, and definitely pre-scaling. From the VCs‚Äô perspective, they invest not only in where the company is today, but also where the company would be, could be, and should be. In many cases, investors buy into the company‚Äôs second, third, and fourth acts in the future, as very few great companies are one-trick ponies.\n\nSRTX is the perfect example. Last week, we went to the grand opening of their mega-factory in Montreal. To my knowledge, it is now the largest textile factory in Canada. The pictures and videos don‚Äôt do justice to the massive scale of this facility.\n\nThis is especially impressive when you know that 180 days ago, when they took over the facility, the roof was leaking, there were no walls, and there was no electricity. The SRTX team moved mountains, rock by rock and at lightning speed, to get the factory ready for production.\n\nI wish I could share some pictures inside the factory. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt share their secret sauce. If you really want to have an insider view, you have to become an investor üòâ\n\nIt took 7 years from its inception for SRTX to begin evolving into a fully verticalized behemoth through innovations in advanced material, hardware, and software to deliver traceability, sustainability, durability, and cost advantages, which is now giving them an ‚Äúunbreakable‚Äù advantage ‚Äì pun fully intended!\n\nToday, millions of Sheertex unbreakable pantyhose are sold. They became THE best-selling pantyhose, unbreakable or otherwise, in North America, not bad for a 15-person company based in Bracebridge, Ontario, a town with a 15,000 population and a 2-hour drive north of Toronto when Two Small Fish Ventures invested!\n\nNow, they are ready to license the IPs of their rip-resistant technology to other textile companies. That‚Äôs their second act. Watertex, one of the world‚Äôs most hydrophobic polymers that is engineered for unparalleled water resistance for use in, say, swimwear, is their third act. There are other IPs that are in the works. I would call them their fourth act.\n\nBut please don‚Äôt use the word pivot here. Pivot implies ‚Äònothing works, let‚Äôs try something else.‚Äô Since the early days, Katherine was very clear that selling pantyhose online was the necessary first act to give her the economy of scale before she could begin her second act, third act, and fourth act. What we see today is exactly how she articulated her bold vision when we invested in the seed round five years ago. We bought into her vision, joined the journey, and now, what she told us is becoming a reality. We wouldn‚Äôt have invested in a company that was merely selling pantyhose online, even if millions were being sold.\n\nThe power couple, Katherine Homuth and Zak Homuth, are not your typical founders. SRTX is rewriting the rules of textiles through innovations. I can‚Äôt wait to watch the second, third, and fourth acts unfold right before our eyes from my front-row seat.\n\nP.S.

As a CEO backed by many valley VCs, I have immersed myself in that view for decades (e.g., Ben Horowitz‚Äôs Why We Prefer Founding CEOs). I get it, I understand where it comes from, and I do mostly agree. That‚Äôs why TSFV backs founding CEOs almost 100% exclusively.\n\nGreat founding CEOs tend to have all three traits: 1) Comprehensive knowledge of the entire company (including knowledge of every employee, product, technology decision, customer data, and the strengths and weaknesses of both the code base and the organization), 2) moral authority, and 3) total commitment to the long-term, while professional CEOs often don‚Äôt.\n\nOn the other hand, being a great CEO is more than just starting a company. It‚Äôs a super stressful job that nobody can learn overnight, and it‚Äôs definitely a different ball game than being a founding CEO of a five-person company. However, founders who can‚Äôt scale with the company can‚Äôt stay in the captain‚Äôs chair forever.\n\nIf the two jobs are so different, why do we still prefer founding CEOs, even though many are learning on the job? Because it gives the company the best chance to become ultra-successful.\n\nTypically, a company goes through four stages of growth. I call it the ‚Äú4S‚Äôs‚Äù:\n\nStart: where everything begins, with just the co-founders and a tiny team.\n\nSprout: achieving product-market fit, with the CEO calling most of the shots in a mostly informal setting.\n\nScale: rapid growth, hiring functional leaders, building depth, and starting to establish business processes. This is often where founder CEOs, especially first-time founder CEOs, stumble as they might lack experience in hiring and leading large teams.\n\nSuccess: achieving a major milestone like an IPO or a massive liquidity event.\n\nBut the growth of a company isn‚Äôt a waterfall. An innovation company can‚Äôt stop innovating once its (first!) product has achieved product-market fit and cannot simply switch gears overnight to focus on business optimization. The most successful companies aren‚Äôt one-trick ponies; they need second and third acts long after their first product takes off.\n\nBased on my own experience and my observation of hundreds of CEOs‚Äô personal growth, I can confidently say that it‚Äôs far easier for a founding CEO to learn leadership than for a professional hire to become innovative and visionary. When the company hits scale-up mode, a founding CEO‚Äôs leadership needs to be solid, but any gaps can be filled by hiring strong leaders. Most founders can successfully make this jump.\n\nOn the flip side, pushing someone to be innovative and visionary is much harder, as is finding a team of leaders who can fill that gap for a professional CEO. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs tougher for professional CEOs to succeed, though it‚Äôs not impossible. It is also possible to hire an ‚Äúentrepreneurial‚Äù professional CEO, although they are rare gems.\n\nHowever, this is all pretty generalized. Generalization tends to default to pattern recognition without thoughtful consideration of the specificity of the company‚Äôs situation. The ideal scenario is a founding CEO leading all the way, but sometimes, if a professional CEO is the only option, that‚Äôs what we have to work with.\n\nThe good news for TSFV‚Äôs portfolio CEOs is that you‚Äôve got a founding CEO who‚Äôs been through it all ‚Äì me! These days, I spend a lot of time helping founding CEOs fast-track their learning to operate more effectively on the job. For our professional CEOs, I offer guidance to help them think and act more like founders. Helping our portfolio CEOs is the best use of my time to ensure our portfolio companies‚Äô success. It is also extremely high-leveraged because sometimes, even a 30-minute conversation with me can help change the trajectory of a company. After all, if our CEOs aren‚Äôt successful, it‚Äôs nearly impossible for our portfolio companies to be successful, isn‚Äôt it?\n\nP.S.

Similarly, hiring the very best talent could include all people functions, but of course, it should not.\n\nIn other words, even with just three things, CEOs will never run out of things to do. So how should they prioritize?\n\nOne guiding principle is that CEOs should only do things that they can uniquely do. Let someone else take care of the heavy lifting.\n\nWhen Wattpad started to scale, this mindset shift really helped me prioritize. This problem is much more common than you may think. Based on my observations, I would even say that at some point, most inexperienced CEOs spend too little time on things that they can uniquely do. Failing to do so, the problem could manifest itself as people in the company chronically waiting on you before they can take their next actions on projects. You lose all the leverage you have in hiring a team.\n\nYou already paid them so much money to do the job for you. Don‚Äôt do their job for them!!!!\n\nAlthough this lesson is mostly for CEOs, the same principle also applies to other leaders and managers. There is a bucket called ‚Äòonly you can do.‚Äô Note that this bucket is not called ‚ÄòI can do it better‚Äò because who can do a better job or who can do it faster is not the issue here. Resisting the temptation to take on a task when your team can (should!) handle it can greatly help you improve your productivity and turn you into a much more effective leader.\n\nP.S.

I was the CTO of my first company, which failed. I was the CEO of my second one, which was acquired when it was still very tiny.\n\nWattpad was my third and last company, but it was my first one as a scale-up CEO. It was a very different beast. The learning curve for me was extremely steep.\n\nThankfully, I was very privileged to have many world-class VCs and their firms invested in Wattpad. Being surrounded by world-class investors and their network not only helped me surmount that learning curve but also helped TSFV become a much better VC firm. More on that in a different post.\n\nOne of these firms is Union Square Ventures. The first and most important thing I learned from USV‚Äôs Fred Wilson is, ‚ÄúWhat does a CEO do?‚Äù\n\nA CEO does only three things:\n\nSets the overall vision and strategy of the company and communicates it to all stakeholders.\n\nRecruits, hires, and retains the very best talent for the company.\n\nEnsures there is always enough cash in the bank.\n\nA CEO should delegate all other tasks to his or her team.\n\nIn my experience, it‚Äôs rare to find great CEOs and consequently, great companies, not getting these three things right. Conversely, dysfunctional companies usually get at least one of these three things really wrong.\n\nI frequently talked about these three things with my team at Wattpad. My leadership team and all the employees knew what to expect and could hold me accountable. And they did.\n\nSo much is packed into these three things. They are deceptively simple, and yet they are extremely nuanced. There‚Äôs enough material here for a book! So, expect multiple blog posts in the future on this topic.\n\nHowever, this post alone is already a great guiding post for any CEO whose company has achieved (or is beyond) product-market fit, or the team is ready to scale, say, roughly 10 people, and even for companies of much larger size.\n\nThis post is the foundation of CEOs‚Äô leadership, and everything flows from here. I learned it, I lived it, and I can testify that this is the first thing that any CEO must get right and keep getting right throughout their tenure.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs precisely why this is the inaugural post in the Two Small Fish Ventures Masterclass Series.\n\nP.S.

My preferred form of communication is the written word, a key reason behind co-founding Wattpad.\n\nAlthough it might sound time-consuming ‚Äì and it is ‚Äì blogging helped me tremendously in clarifying my thinking. More importantly, context matters. The 30-60 minutes I spent each day aligned and interacted with hundreds of employees, arguably making it the most effective activity in terms of leveraging time. Here‚Äôs what I explained on Allen‚Äôs Thoughts about why I needed to do this:\n\n‚ÄúWattpad is an incredibly complex company. We are a tech company, a media company, a book publisher, an advertising company, an influencer network, an AI company, a movie studio, a social network, a community, and also an entertainment company that makes people happy.\n\nWhat links us together is our common vision, mission, values, and culture. Allen‚Äôs Thoughts is less about the numbers and company updates, which you can get on Slack, email, Google Docs, or other channels. This blog is more about sharing the context, the whys, and the intangibles in a narrative that helps you navigate that complexity so that you can make the best possible decisions and do your best job.\n\nThis blog is one of my unique superpowers that connects everyone.‚Äù\n\nI started Allen‚Äôs Thoughts in 2013 and stopped daily blogging after stepping down in May 2022. My final post, ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS THE FINAL CURTAIN CALL. A NEW STORY BEGINS,‚Äù was shared publicly on allensthoughts.com.\n\nDo I miss it? Absolutely, yes. However, after writing half a million words, I became too mentally exhausted.\n\nAfter a long break, I am fully recharged and ready to reactivate my public blog. Although the Wattpad story is well-documented, many challenges and triumphs weren‚Äôt shared externally. These backstories are valuable case studies in business, leadership, entrepreneurship, venture capital and even time management. Re-reading my old posts, I realized they are a startup treasure trove, offering insights from scaling from two co-founders to a scaleup with hundreds of employees and 100 million users. I plan to share these lessons, along with many new topics.\n\nOf course, I will also share my perspective on the startup investment landscape, our investment thesis, and our areas of focus ‚Äì i.e., AI, protocols, and sustainable computing ‚Äì among other topics.\n\nThis material will be part of our ‚ÄúSchool of Fish‚Äù Masterclass Series, more on this later.\n\nI don‚Äôt plan to write daily. Frequency is not the most important aspect; it‚Äôs more about when inspiration strikes. My goal is to share high-quality, high-leverage, and impactful content. I will use Allen Thoughts to think things through ‚Äúin public,‚Äù writing for my own enjoyment and hoping it benefits many others. After a hiatus, I‚Äôm eager, hungry, and excited to do it again!\n\nP.S. This blog is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Less than four years later, when Dennis Bennie, the CEO and co-founder, brokered a half-a-billion-dollar deal with Symantec, the company employed just under 800 people and became one of the world‚Äôs top 10 PC software companies. With over 90% of the market share, Delrina‚Äôs products were so dominant that we crushed all our competitors. Truly legendary.\n\nPost-acquisition, Eva went to work for ATI, where she crossed paths with Sally Daub, then served as its General Counsel. ATI and its chief rival Nvidia emerged as the two world‚Äôs leading graphics chip players. In 2006, ATI was acquired by AMD for $5.4 billion. The transaction is one of the largest Canadian tech acquisitions. Probably still in the top three to date.\n\nI‚Äôll be succinct about Wattpad‚Äîit‚Äôs a story many are familiar with. We pioneered mobile reading, user-generated fiction, AI-and-audience-backed movies and many areas that resulted in billions of story uploads in over 50 languages, numerous world‚Äôs most-watched movies and 100 million users in virtually every corner of this planet.\n\nKatherine and Zak Homuth‚Äôs Sheertex needs no introduction. In seven short years since its founding in Muskoka, the company became a world-famous household name and synonymous with unbreakable pantyhose. Three years ago, it took over the largest hosiery factory in Canada. To keep up with the demand, it is now moving into a space in Montreal three times larger. There is still so much headroom for growth.\n\nThese four Canadian companies are all world-dominating category creators.\n\nAs a passenger on the rocket ship, being the captain of the rocket ship and funding the rocket ship are three different skills. And yet, they‚Äôre intertwined, each amplifying the other. If you have never been on a rocket ship, it would be hard to imagine what a rocket ship looks like and spot the next one.\n\nEva and I have been immensely fortunate to wear multiple hats as employees, founders, and investors in many rocket ships. The timeless adage rings true: Surround yourself with the best. If you aim to be the best, work for the best and work with the best will help you learn from the best."
