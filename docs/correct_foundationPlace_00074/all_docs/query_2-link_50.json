Times, July 31, 1987, at 4\n\nThe Department of Justice has determined that from 1988 through July 1994, a period during which the number of personal computers in the United States virtually exploded. Microsoft Corporation successfully used a variety of unlawful and \"anticompetitive\" practices to maintain its monopoly position in the market for \"operating systems\" for use with personal computers. As a result of these unlawful practices, Microsoft has been able to preclude any meaningful competition in the market while increasing the installed base of Microsoft operating systems from well under 20 million in 1988 to approximately 120 million in 1994.\n\nThis memorandum1 will show that under established economic theory, this now- massive installed base will enable Microsoft, if unchecked, both to maintain its monopoly in the operating systems market, and to leverage its installed base to dominate and monopolize the markets for applications and other software products. This brief also will show that the Department's proposed decree completely fails to address the consequences of the huge increase in installed base that Microsoft has procured through illegal practices. Instead, the Department simply proposes to shut the barn door now that the horse has already gone.\n\nUnder established economic theory, it is clear that the proposed decree will neither result in an increase in competition in the operating systems market, nor prevent Microsoft from monopolizing the remainder of the software industry. These amici accordingly urge the Court to require further submissions from the Department, both by way of expert affidavits and the production of documents, to explain how permitting Microsoft to profit from its illegal conduct not just by continuing, but by expanding, its monopolization of the software industry can be argued to be in the \"public interest.\"\n\nI\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY\n\nThis Court has been asked to endorse the proposed Consent Decree between the Department of Justice and Microsoft without being provided with any of the information upon which a meaningful determination under the Tunney Act could be based. Thus, for example, the Department's investigation ostensibly inquired regarding \"alleged false product preannouncements\" by Microsoft. 59 Fed. Reg. 59,426, 59,427 (Nov. 17, 1994). At the September 29, 1994 hearing on this matter, the Court referred to this issue, noting that in the book Hard Drive,2 Microsoft was said \"time after time\" to predatorially preannounce products \"with the intent [to] freeze other people from coming out with their product.\" Tr. of Status Call, Sept. 29, 1994, at 16:21-22. The following colloquy then took place between Microsoft's counsel and the Court:\n\nThe Court: [H]ow do you answer those charges? Mr. Urowsky: Those charges we believe are entirely false. The Court: In other words, the vaporware charge is false? Mr. Urowsky: That's correct.\n\nId. at 15:7-12, 16:18-17:1.\n\nMicrosoft's representations, however, are belied by Microsoft's own documents, produced to the Government during the course of its investigation. (Examples of such documents are attached hereto at Appendix Exs. 21 and 22.)3 Thus, for example, a Microsoft manager was involved in spearheading two product preannouncements during one six-month period. In one instance, the manager wrote that in response to \"Borland's announce[ment of] TurboBASIC at the November Comdex,\" he simultaneously worked \"to develop a [Microsoft] spec[ification] that could beat TurboB,\" while also formulating a promotional campaign \"that could hold our position until [QB3, the Microsoft product] hit the market.\"4 He stated that he \"reviewed [this] promotion plan with Bill G. before implementation.\" Id. The Microsoft documents state that Steve Ballmer, one of Microsoft's top executives, favorably commented on this strategy, saying that the \"best way to stick it\" to Borland was such a \"QB3 preannounce to hold off Turbo buyers.\"5\n\nIn the same document, the Microsoft manager wrote that Microsoft was \"not as far along on the response to [Borland's] Turbo C,\" a second product, because Microsoft was \"further from product announcement.\" According to the Microsoft document, the Microsoft manager:\n\ndeveloped a rollout plan for [Microsoft's products] QuickC and CS that focused on minimizing Borland's first mover advantage by preannouncing with an aggressive communication campaign.6\n\nThe manager was given the highest possible rating on his performance review (a \"5-\") for his \"public relations\" handling of this \"C preannouncement.\"7\n\nPerhaps even more striking than the incongruence between Microsoft's representations and its own documents is the silence by the Department, both in its written submissions and in its oral presentation to the Court, regarding its findings on this and other matters. The Department has not taken the position (nor, presumably, could it, without some explanation of the documents that have been submitted to it) that Microsoft has not engaged in practices such as predatory, preannouncements, or the seeding of what are referred to as \"undocumented calls\" (secret elements in an operating system that make a competitor's applications program operate less well than a rival Microsoft program).8 Instead, the Department simply has asserted that it had determined that \"no further action was warranted\" on these matters -- presumably a conclusion that it asks this Court to take completely on faith, since it has provided the Court with literally no explanation for its decision.\n\nMost remarkable of all, however, is the absence of any information in any of the Department's submissions regarding the adequacy of its proposed remedy for Microsoft's illegal monopolistic conduct. Based on the Department's own allegations, from 1988 to 1994 Microsoft used a variety of illegal tactics to maintain its monopolistic share in the rapidly growing operating systems market -- and thus increased the size of its installed base through the use of illegal tactics from no more than 18 million9 to approximately 120 million users.10 Having acknowledged that Microsoft thus illegally acquired its massive installed base, the Department nonetheless has failed to proffer any basis for concluding that simply prohibiting these practices in the future will remedy the unassailable position that Microsoft has gained as a result of its unfair and illegal practices.\n\nCertainly no one in the industry believes that the Department's proposed remedies will have the slightest effect in unseating Microsoft from the position that it now illegally occupies. As one competitor observed after the consent decree was announced, \"[t]he consent decree seems to have set [Microsoft] free .... Now, they are running rampant over everything.\"11 Microsoft entirely agrees. As Bill Gates observed in his response to the proposed decree:\n\nNone of the people who run [Microsoft's seven] divisions are going to change what they do or think or forecast. Nothing. There's one guy in charge of [hardware company] licenses. He'll read the agreement.\n\nElizabeth Corcoran, Microsoft Deal Came Down to a Phone Call, Washington Post, July 18. 1994, at Al (Ex. 42).\n\nNor have events since the decree was proposed provided the slightest basis for believing that the Department's proposed remedy will have any effect. In a nationally televised press conference on July 16, 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno predicted that the Department's settlement with Microsoft would have two results: it \"will save consumers money [and] enable them to have a choice when selecting operating systems.\"12 In fact, however, in the six months since the proposed settlement was announced, press reports indicate that Microsoft has literally doubled the price of its operating system to computer manufacturers.13\n\nMoreover, far from the decree leading to an increase in competition in the operating systems market, a key competitor in that market, the maker of DR DOS, has subsequently withdrawn from the market. The competitor observed in withdrawing from the market that \"the battle for the desktop is over and MS DOS and Windows have won.\"14 The withdrawal of DR DOS from the market is of particular note since it was DR DOS that the authors of Hard Drive pointed to as providing the most likely source of meaningful competition to Microsoft in the operating systems market. See Hard Drive, supra, at 398.15\n\nHaving failed to explain how its proposal will remedy Microsoft's illegal acquisition of its massive installed base in the operating systems market, the Department's submission does not even touch on Microsoft's use of that illegally acquired installed base to leverage into -- and acquire market power in -- other software markets. In analyzing the strength of the Department's case against Microsoft, Hard Drive identified Microsoft's weakness in application programs as the principal reason (apart from the competition provided by products such as DR DOS) why Microsoft's dominant position arguably would not hurt consumers. With respect to application programs, the authors in 1992 argued that\n\nMicrosoft does not come close to dominating the Big Three of applications--word processing, databases and spreadsheets. WordPerfect is far ahead of Microsoft Word, Lotus 1-2-3 is still ahead of Excel, and Microsoft has nothing to compete against Ashton-Tate's dBASE.\n\nHard Drive, supra, at 398.\n\nWhat a difference three years can make -- at least when, like Microsoft, a company can leverage its installed base in operating systems, and finance early losses in applications with monopoly profits from operating systems. Under the headline \"MICROSOFT'S DOMINATION,\" Dataquest Inc. has reported the 1994 market revenue and share figures for the applications market:\n\n\"Lotus 1-2-3, WordPerfect, dBASE, Paradox and Harvard Graphics once dominated their respective categories,\" said Dataquest analyst Karl Wong. \"Today, Microsoft products have replaced each of these one-time product category leaders.\"\n\nMicrosoft's Domination, San Jose Mercury News, December 21, 1994, at 1F (Ex. 35).16\n\nMicrosoft did not achieve its dominant position in operating systems and applications through free and open competition on a level playing field. Rather, it used the illegal tactics challenged in the Government's complaint to create a huge installed base in operating systems. Then, it took unfair advantage of its installed base to give its own applications group a head start and its programs a performance advantage over applications competitors -- precisely the concern voiced in Hard Drive17 and echoed by this Court.18\n\n\"Microsoft has never had a hit among its MS-DOS applications programs.\"19 Yet, in the past few years, Microsoft has come from nowhere to provide the lion's share of business application programs.20\n\nAs explained in this brief, Microsoft achieved that result by the illegal tactics charged by the Government, and by illegal tying techniques, monopoly leveraging, and otherwise predatorially exploiting its monopoly position in one market to achieve market power in other markets. Because of the type of economic forces that prevail in these markets, rigorous economic analysis predicts that, unless restrained by Government action, Microsoft will succeed in using its dominance in operating systems to monopolize all other aspects of transaction software, from desktop applications to online systems. Microsoft's goal is to identify and control every \"strategic component,\" \"choke point\" or \"leverage point\" in the information economy.21 And Microsoft is already close to achieving a complete lock-in in desktop applications.\n\nThis Memorandum of Amici argues that the Proposed Final Judgment is not in the public interest and should not be entered by this Court. Indeed it is economically impossible to achieve the stated goals of greater choices and lower prices for operating systems without (1) addressing the increase in installed base that Microsoft has procured through illegal practices and (2) restraining Microsoft's use of that installed base to dominate the markets for applications and other software products.\n\nThis Memorandum of Amici is divided into seven sections. This first section provides a summary and overview of the brief. The second section addresses the scope of investigation and power of this Court under the Tunney Act. In particular, the second section argues that, under 15 U.S.C. ï½§ 16(e), the Court not only can but should consider the effect of the proposed decree beyond the operating systems market. The section further argues that the Department's submission falls far short of providing the Court with an adequate record upon which to act, and provides no factual predicate for concluding that the decree's remedy is even arguably within the \"public interest\" under Section 16(e).\n\nThe remainder of the brief explains that the Government cannot effectively restore and maintain competition -- even in the operating systems market -- without addressing both the consequences of the \"installed base\" that Microsoft increased through illegal means, and the use of Microsoft's resulting market power more broadly. Section III describes the markets and technologies in which Microsoft operates and lays a foundation for an understanding of Microsoft's conduct and strategic direction. The section begins by describing the interrelationships among complicated software technologies and demonstrates that the various markets in which Microsoft competes are parts of a large network that can be entered by a competitor's product through a few key gateways, the principal gateway being the desktop operating system. Using economic analysis, the section then argues that the economic characteristics of the technologies and markets at issue differ markedly from other, more conventional industries, in that these products (software products) and markets (networks) exhibit \"increasing returns,\" also sometimes called \"network effects.\" The section discusses the underlying characteristics of the technology that gave rise to these conditions and the likely consequences that these circumstances will produce.\n\nSection IV of the brief explains Microsoft's strategy and evaluates Microsoft's prospects for complete domination of all of the interconnected software markets. The section begins by explaining that Microsoft increased its \"installed base\" in operating systems through the illegal practices charged in the Government's complaint. The section then explains and documents the fact that Microsoft pursues a strategy of leverage from \"gateway\" markets, like the desktop operating system in which it is dominant, to strategic markets in which its competitive position is weak (as was the case in applications). Microsoft targets such strategic markets, establishes marketing and technological links to those markets from established monopolies in gateway markets, and leverages its power to monopolize the target markets. In other words, it transfers the installed base of a gateway market it dominates to create an installed base in the strategic target market. The section focuses primarily on the desktop market, describing in some detail the method by which Microsoft (according to the Government's Tunney Act filing) used illegal activities to increase its installed base in operating systems and then leveraged its monopoly over the operating system to dominate applications. In particular, the section describes Microsoft's tactics of bundling and unbundling functions into and out of its operating system to disadvantage its competitors in the applications market.\n\nSection V of the Memorandum of Amici applies \"increasing returns\" economics to suggest that Microsoft likely will achieve a monopoly position for its products throughout the entire personal computer network unless restrained by Government action. The section rejects various arguments that could be put forward to justify such monopolization, including the arguments (1) that alternative networks created by alliances of competitors will provide competition, and (2) that the benefits derived from integration of a single product line are worth the cost in loss of free competition throughout the network. The section concludes by suggesting that absent meaningful governmental intervention, the American software industry will be monopolized by Microsoft, with the only competition coming from protected markets and competition abroad.\n\nSection VI evaluates the possibilities and prospects for governmental intervention from the legal 'perspective. The section begins with an evaluation of the proposed Final Judgment, observing that the Government's Tunney Act filing concedes that Microsoft. through the use of illegal practices, has acquired an enormous installed base that constitutes an overwhelming barrier to entry. The only sanction proposed by the Government, requiring Microsoft to cease the behavior that permitted it to acquire this entrenched installed base, will have no effect in diminishing the installed base, easing barriers to entry, or otherwise precluding Microsoft from using the illegally acquired installed base to monopolize the operating system market or other markets. The section considers specific strategies for relief adopted by previous Administrations in comparable situations and analyzes legal precedents supporting such strategies.\n\nFinally, Section VII of the brief proposes procedures this Court may wish to adopt in order to exercise its appropriate role in Tunney Act proceedings. The section urges the Court to order the production of key Microsoft documents and to require the Government to produce detailed and predictive economic models of the type previously employed to support consent decrees adopted through Tunney Act procedures.\n\nII\n\nTHE PERMISSIBLE SCOPE OF THIS COURT'S REVIEW\n\nIn 1974 Congress enacted the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (\"APPA\"), also known as the \"Tunney Act.\" 15 U.S.C. .. 16(b)-(h) (1994), out of concern with \"prior practice, which gave the [Justice] Department almost total control of the consent decree process, with only minimal judicial oversight.\" United States v. American Tel. & Tel., 552 F.Supp. 131. 148 (D.D.C. 1982) (\"AT&T\"), aff'd sub nom. Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. I001 (1983). To remedy this practice, Congress sought to eliminate \"judicial rubber stamping\" of such consent decrees,22 providing that \"[b]efore entering any consent judgment ... the court shall determine that the entry of such judgment is in the public interest.\" 15 U.S.C. ï½§ 16(e). Circuit Judge Aldrich, sitting by designation in United States v. Gillette Co., 406 F.Supp. 713 (D. Mass. 1975) (cited by both the Department and Microsoft), observed upon reviewing the legislative history of the Act:\n\nThe legislative history shows clearly that Congress did not intend the court's action to be merely pro forma, or to be limited to what appears on the surface. Nor can one overlook the circumstances under which the act was passed, indicating Congress' desire to impose a check not only on the government's expertise -- or at the least, its exercise of it -- but even on its good faith.\n\nId. at 715.23\n\nDespite this clear statutory intent, the oral and written submissions in the present case have suggested that the Court's review should be circumscribed in ways not supported either by the statute or by existing case law. First, the submissions may be taken as suggesting that the Court should look only to the impact of the proposed decree on the operating system market in determining whether the decree is in the public interest. See, e.g., 59 Fed. Reg., at 59,429. The law, however, plainly is otherwise. For example, in United States v. BNS Inc., 858 F.2d 456 (9th Cir. 1988), -- a case relied upon by the Department -- the Court observed that \"the statute suggests that a court may, and perhaps should, look beyond the strict relationship between complaint and remedy in evaluating the public interest.\" 858 F.2d at 462 (quoting United States v. Bechtel Corp., 648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1083 (1981)). While the court's public interest determination may not be based on a different market from the one identified in the complaint, the Ninth Circuit emphasized that this did not mean that only effects on that market can or should be considered:\n\n[T]he statute clearly indicates that the court may consider the impact of the consent judgment on the public interest, even though that effect may be on an unrelated sphere of economic activity. For example, the government's complaint might allege a substantial lessening of competition in the marketing of grain in a specified area. It would be permissible for the court to consider the resulting increase in the price of bread in related areas.\n\nId. at 463 (emphasis added).\n\nUnder the Department's own authority, therefore, the Court's inquiry is not limited to the effect of the proposed judgment on the operating system market. To the contrary, the Court can (and, it is submitted, should) determine the effect of the proposed judgment on other areas impacted by Microsoft's monopolistic conduct. As will be discussed in more detail in Section IV, infra, for example, Microsoft has used its illegally acquired market position to leverage into and acquire a monopoly in other related markets. The failure of the decree to \"break up or render impotent [this] monopoly power found to be in violation of the Act.\" AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 150 -- indeed, its tacit decision to leave Microsoft free to profit from its unlawful market power by leveraging into other software markets -- is something that the Court should consider in evaluating the public interest served (or disserved) by the proposed decree.\n\nA second limitation implied in the submissions to the Court also is without authority in the case law. namely, that the Court is limited to considering those matters that the Department has identified in its complaint. That is not the law. See, e.g., BNS, 858 F.2d at 462 (\"a court may consider matters not discussed in the complaint\"); Gillette, 406 F.Supp. at 715 (\"Congress did not intend the court's action to be... limited to what appears on the surface\"). Indeed, simply accepting at face value the Department's analysis -- and even its good faith -- amounts to precisely the kind of \"rubber stamping\" that the APPA expressly rejects. The Court is required, in evaluating the Department's proposed decree, to determine whether it \"meets the requirements for an antitrust remedy -- that is, if it effectively opens the relevant markets to competition and prevents the recurrence of anticompetitive activity.\" AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 153. If the Department has determined not to address a practice -- for example, Microsoft's \"bundling\" of operating and applications programs, discussed in more detail in Section IV, infra -- which forecloses any meaningful chance of competition in the operating systems market, that fact must be considered by the Court in assessing the adequacy of the decree as a remedy for the charged violations. That is so regardless of whether the Department has chosen to turn a blind eye to the consequences of such bundling on the effectiveness of its proposed decree.\n\nFinally, prior submissions to the Court have emphasized that in assessing whether the decree is in the \"public interest\" under Section 16(e), the Court should not \"determine whether the resulting array of rights and liabilities is the one that will best serve society, but only to confirm that the resulting settlement is within the reaches of the public interest.\" United States v. Western Electric Co., 900 F.2d 283, 309 (D.C. Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 911 (1990) (citations and quotations omitted; emphasis in original). This standard clearly is correct. but the parties' further assertion -- that the submissions already made by the Department are sufficient to satisfy this standard -- equally clearly is not.\n\nA comparison of the information provided in those cases relied upon by the Department, with that provided here, highlights just how far short the Department has fallen in providing this Court with an adequate record upon which to act. For example, the Department relies heavily upon the Court of Appeals' decision affirming a modification of the consent decree in United States v. Western Electric Co., Inc., 993 F.2d at 1572. See 59 Fed. Reg. at 59,429.24 However, in finding that there was a sufficient \"factual foundation for the judgment call made by the Department of Justice and to make its conclusion reasonable,\" 993 F. 2d at 1582, the Court of Appeals in that case expressly pointed to the \"array of prominent economists (including two Nobel laureates, Stigler and Arrow),\" who had submitted affidavits in the record that supported the Department's position. These affidavits provided detailed support for the factual predicates underlying the Department's proposal, including the view that the Bell operating companies would not be able to discriminate or engage in cross-subsidization: that government oversight would be effective in regulating their behavior; and that the proposal would enhance competition in the relevant markets. See id. at 1578-82.\n\nThis Court, by contrast, has not been provided with the affidavit of any economist, or for that matter of anyone else, that would provide a factual predicate for any of the matters that it must decide in reviewing the adequacy of the proposed decree. The Department has provided no factual basis (other than its say-so) for believing that the remedies proposed in the decree would be sufficient to \"pry open to competition\" the operating systems market, AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 150; that Microsoft's other anticompetitive practices (undocumented calls, predatory preannouncements, anticompetitive bundling and unbundling, early disclosure to Microsoft applications programmers) will not undermine the effectiveness of the decree; and so forth. Although this case involves an industry of unquestioned significance to the future of the American economy -- one of comparable importance to AT&T itself -- the Department has in fact given this Court nothing to go on other than the purest ipse dixit. Indeed, it is hard to imagine how the Department could claim that its request for approval of the decree amounts to anything but a request for a \"rubber stamp\" when it has so notably failed to say anything other than \"trust us.\"\n\nNor does the Department's submission compare favorably with the information available to other courts in cases cited by the Department. In Gillette, for example, which first formulated the \"reaches of the public interest\" standard, see 406 F. Supp. at 716, Judge Aldrich concluded that he was able to make an independent determination regarding the adequacy of the proposed decree because \"the record [in the case] is both open and extensive.\" Id. at 715. Here, the record is neither. Indeed, the transcripts of the hearings on September 29, 1994 and November 2, 1994 are replete with inquiries by the Court regarding matters inextricably tied to the adequacy of the proposed remedy -- inquiries that repeatedly failed to yield any information at all, or (even worse) information that is at odds with the record.\n\nThe example of preannouncements already has been discussed above: despite Microsoft's unequivocal denial, and the Department's silence, the documentary record shows that such predatory preannouncements in fact are used by Microsoft. Nor is this the only example highlighted by the transcript. Equally striking is the Court's effort to ascertain whether the Department had concluded that a \"Chinese Wall\" exists between Microsoft's operating system and applications divisions. Noting the discussion of this point in Hard Drive, the Court may have been left with the impression during the hearing that such a \"Chinese Wall\" in fact exists. See Tr. of Status Call, Sept. 29, 1994, at 27:11-28:1. Certainly that is the impression that Microsoft previously has sought to convey, dating all the way back to 1983.25 Indeed, throughout the spring and summer of 1991, after the FTC announced its investigation of Microsoft in March 1991, Microsoft persisted in its claim that the company's applications and systems development groups were separated.26\n\nNow, however, at the end of a long footnote in its written submission, Microsoft disavows that any such \"Chinese Wall\" exists -- and, indeed, derides the idea as \"irrational.\" See Microsoft Mem. at 7 n. 12. The Department, again, has been silent. Was its determination that \"no further action [is] warranted\" on this issue, 59 Fed. Reg. at 59,427, based on Microsoft's earlier representation that a \"Chinese Wall\" in fact exists? Was it based on the conclusion that there is no \"Chinese.Wall,\" but it does not matter? If not, why not'.)\n\nThe answers to these and other questions may remain unanswered because no satisfactory answer is available. As shown in Sections III through VI, infra, the Government cannot effectively restore competition in the operating systems market without addressing the consequences of Microsoft's illegally-acquired \"installed base,\" and its broader use of its acquired market power. The Government's proposed consent decree, however, fails to do either.\n\nIII\n\nTHE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY\n\nSection III is divided into two parts. Subsection A provides background by describing the structure of the software industry and how it has changed over time in response to Microsoft's prior conduct in the market. Subsection B describes the economic characteristics of the technologies and markets at issue here.\n\nMarket And Technology Background\n\nThe relevance of much of the material in this section, particularly the schematic diagrams, is fleshed out and explained to a great extent in the subsequent sections. If the Court is unfamiliar with these markets, the Court may find it useful at this point to read The Economist27 article, and the Harvard Business Review28 article, both found in the Appendix.\n\nAt the outset, two characteristics of these markets and technologies should be emphasized. First, the products at issue are software products, composed almost entirely of intellectual property content. Because of the nature of software, there can be greater flexibility in the formation of vertical relationships than often is present with respect to more conventional products. Unlike a pipeline, for example, many competitors can vertically link their software, through software compatibility, to products in the markets above and below them. So, for example, a number of different companies can make word processing application programs that work equally well with Microsoft's operating system so long as they all have the same technical information on a timely basis. It is not necessary for Microsoft to bundle -- or literally tie together -- its operating system and word processing program in order to ensure that the two programs work well together. With software, the efficiency benefits of vertical integration can be achieved without foreclosing access to competitors.\n\nSecond, the Stipulated Complaint and Final Judgment in this case focus on the Personal computer operating system and the applications that run on top of it. Together, the personal computer operating system and the applications that run on it are sometimes known as the \"business desktop.\" But the desktop is really only an interrelated component of a network that contains desktops (or \"clients\") and \"servers.\" These software networks bear many of the characteristics that economists have associated with networks in other industries, including \"increasing returns\" or \"network effects,\" as described in Subsection B. Indeed, software networks manifest increasing returns, or demand-side economies of scale, more strongly than networks in more conventional industries.\n\nThe network at issue here has four components, two on the \"business\" side and two on the \"home\" side. On both the home and business sides, there is a desktop, or \"client,\" component, and a \"server\" component that links the desktop into a broader network. The network as a whole can be diagramed as follows:\n\nBOX 1\n\nHOME CLIENT\n\nApplications Multiple Layers Connected to Server\n\nby Windows 95\n\nBOX 4\n\nINTRABUSINESS CLIENT\n\nApplications 5 Layers Connected to Server by\n\nWindows 95'\n\n^\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\nHome-to-Business\n\n(\"On Line Services\")\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\nv ^\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\nIntrabusiness\n\n(Enterprise Server)\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\nv\n\nHome-to-Business\n\nServer 8 Layers Connected to Home\n\nClient and\n\nIntrabusiness Server\n\nby Windows NT\n\nHOME-TO-BUSINESS\n\nBOX 2 <------------------------------->\n\nIntrabusiness Server 8 Layers Connected to\n\nIntrabusiness Client\n\nand Home-to-\n\nBusiness Server by\n\nWindows NT\n\nENTERPRISE SERVER BOX 3\n\nFigure 1\n\nThe following description attempts to provide some explanation for each of these boxes: the intrabusiness client, which runs on the \"desktop\"; the enterprise \"server,\"' meaning the hardware and software applications that run on a more centralized computer and that link the clients together; the home \"client;'\" and the home-to-business server, that similarly links home personal computers (\"PCs\") into a. larger network. This brief then discusses two particular technologies that play a critical role in understanding Microsoft's strategy: OLE and Windows.\n\nThe Business Desktop\n\nThe personal computer or \"PC\" was initially devised as a stand-alone device, but today it is usually used as part of a network. This is certainly the case in business, and will increasingly be the case in the home.29 The PC, both stand-alone and as part of a network, is often referred to as \"the desktop.\" The FTC Investigation and the DOJ investigation of Microsoft have focussed on the desktop.\n\nPrior to Microsoft Windows, the intrabusiness \"client side\" or desktop could have been thought of as having four layers.\n\nLevel Name Examples 4 Applications Lotus 1-2-3, dBASE, WordPerfect, Harvard Graphics 3 Development Tools Basic, Pascal, C 2 OS Apple, CPM, MS DOS, DR DOS 1 Hardware IBM, Apple, Kaypro\n\nFigure 2\n\nToday, the market looks more like Figure 3 below. It reflects two principal changes, each of which will be explained in Section IV, infra. First, Microsoft succeeded in forcing the market to migrate to a new operating system or \"OS\" (Windows), thereby inserting a new layer, the \"graphical user interface\" (GUI) layer (layer 3), between the operating system and the applications. Second, using its leverage in layers 2 and 3, it has become dominant as well in development tools (layer 4) and business applications (layer 5).30\n\nFigure 3\n\nThe Justice Department investigation of Microsoft has focussed primarily on operating systems (Levels 2 and 3 in Figure 3), -- but the Government's Tunney Act submission also considers the applications layers (Levels 4 and 5) insofar as they impact competition in operating systems. In order to evaluate the proposed Final Judgment, a slightly more detailed understanding of the operating system layer is necessary.\n\nThe Government's complaint defines the market as operating systems that run on the Intel chip set (known as \"X86\" chips). 59 Fed. Reg. at 42.847 (Complaint \"¶ 13). There were formerly three principal operating system vendors for this market -- Microsoft (MS DOS and Windows), Novell (DR DOS) and IBM (PC-DOS and OS/2). Novell, as indicated above, has withdrawn from this market, and Microsoft is unquestionably a monopolist, currently enjoying a greater than 90% market share.31 Software written for the current version of Windows (v. 3.1) and prior versions will also run on the IBM OS/2 operating system. However, software written expressly for Microsoft's next release of Windows (Windows 95), due out in August of 1995, will not run on the IBM OS/2 operating system. Don Clark and Laurie Hays, Microsoft's New Marketing Tactics Draw Complaints, Wall St. J., Dec. 12, 1994, at B6 (Ex. 41).\n\nThere are a few other competing desktop operating systems that run on different chip sets. For example, Apple's Macintosh operating system runs on a Motorola chip set. And the UNIX operating system generally runs on a specially designed chip, such as the \"RISC\" (reduced instruction set) chip designed by Sun Microsystems.\n\nEven including these other operating systems in the same market as those that run on the Intel chip, Microsoft has an overwhelming market share, with well over 85 %. As the Government's Complaint correctly points out, applications software written for an Intel chip operating system will not run on the Apple Macintosh or Sun RISC workstation without significant modification -- known as \"porting.\" Frequently, porting application software to a new chip set and operating system entails a significant re-engineering of the software. Hence. the Government does not include operating systems for the different chip sets within the same antitrust market.\n\nHowever, the Government fails to point out that the only companies in the market for developing business application software for the operating systems sold by Apple and Sun, for example, are also the business application vendors on the Windows platform -- e.g., Novell/WordPerfect, Lotus, Borland, etc., and Microsoft, itself, of course. The significance of this fact is discussed in greater detail infra. The point here, however, is that if Microsoft were able to monopolize the market for business applications software, it would severely inhibit competition from vendors of operating systems that run on other chips but nevertheless compete with the Microsoft operating system (e.g., Apple and Sun).32\n\nFigure 4 shows what the intrabusiness client side probably will look like once Microsoft's strategy of vertical integration of markets within the client is completely executed. It shows the completion of Microsoft's leverage from layers 2 and 3 to further its domination of all aspects of layers 4 and 5.\n\nLevel Name Examples 5 Applications Desk-top Applications, e.g., Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, and Client Server Applications 4 Development Tools MS Basic, MS C, MS C + +, Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft Visual C + +, OLE 3 Graphical User Interface MS Windows 2 Operating System MS DOS 1 Hardware X86 PC Hardware and Other Hardware in Figure 3\n\nFigure 4\n\nThe Intrabusiness Server\n\nThe \"server\" is the direct lineal descendant of the mainframe computer. Prior to the advent of the personal computer, companies operated using a mainframe, to which \"dumb\" terminals were connected. Personal computer technologies now allow many computing functions to be performed on the desktop by an individual worker, but workers within a business still need to share information with each other and access a body of data simultaneously. The \"server,\" a dedicated hardware platform with its own server operating system, allows this to happen. Indeed, increasingly, workers within a business will want simultaneous access to several bodies of data and several different application programs, so that, for example, textual documents containing spreadsheets can be prepared by a number of employees working at the same time.\n\nThere are two basic components of the server markets. The intrabusiness server is the backbone of business. Microsoft has projected that there will be 300 million servers in the business community, running everything from phone systems, to copying systems, to cash registers. J. William Semich, The Long View From Microsoft: Component DBMSs. Datamation, Aug. 1. 1994, at 40 (Ex. 10). If a Single company controls all business server markets and applications, that company has far greater market power in various sections of the economy than, say, mere control of the desktop would bestow. The second server component. home-to-business, will be described in a subsequent section.\n\nToday, the \"server\" side of the intrabusiness environment has approximately eight layers. It would unnecessarily complicate this brief of amici to describe the intrabusiness server markets in great detail. There are, however, three important points about the intrabusiness server markets that are relevant for this Court's consideration. First, the most important layer in the server market is the operating system level. The two leading competitors in this market at present are Novell's \"Netware\" product and Microsoft's NT product.33 The operating system is important because the other products in the server market run on top of the server operating system in much the same way as desktop applications run on top of Windows. The operating system level is also important because it is the level through which the server is connected to the business desktop and (through on-line services) to the home client.\n\nSecond, as was the case on the desktop four years ago, competition is vigorous at all levels of the server market. At each of the eight levels, there are a number of competitors, each striving to make better products at cheaper prices. This condition represents a significant (and welcome) departure from the state of the computer industry prior to the advent of personal computer and server technology. In an earlier period, there were only a few vertically integrated companies in the computer industry, such as IBM, DEC and Wang. These companies attempted to supply all aspects of computer technology -- from the underlying chips and operating systems, to applications, to distribution, and even including service and support of previously sold computers. Generally speaking, consumers have benefitted enormously by the fragmentation of the industry into horizontal layers characterized by vigorous competition. Consumers have been able to choose the technologically superior and most cost effective product at each level and combine those products into a system that addresses the consumers' needs. The pro-competitive benefits of the industries' current horizontal alignment is discussed in some detail in the Economist article (Ex. 14).\n\nFinally, Microsoft is pursuing a vertical integration strategy on the intrabusiness server side similar to that pursued on the business desktop side. This strategy is only briefly discussed elsewhere in this paper. The Court can get further information concerning Microsoft's strategy, goals and prospects for success from the following articles found in the Appendix: Stuart J. Johnston and Ed Scannell, Server Suite Could Squeeze Market, Computerworld, Oct. 10, 1994, at 4 (Ex. 7); How Microsoft's Server Strategy Will Change The Industry - Parts I & II, Report by Summit Strategies Inc.; J. William Semich, Datamation, Aug. 1, 1994, supra, at 40 (Ex. 10). Obviously, after complete execution of this strategy, Microsoft products would be dominant or exclusive on each of the server layers.\n\nThe Home-to-Business Server\n\nThe second aspect of server technology is the home-to-business server market, sometimes known as \"online services.\" Today, most online services run off mainframe computers the way LEXIS and NEXIS do. Businesses will increasingly need to sell directly into the home through online services in order to remain competitive. Control by a single company of the home-to-business server market would have significant economic ramifications.\n\nAlthough there is a vigorous online services market in place, the home-to-business server does not yet exist, except in Microsoft's plans. It can be readily assumed that the home- to-business server would look much like the intrabusiness server, with only Microsoft products being vertically integrated.\n\nLevel Name Examples 8 Vertical Applications Home banking, home shopping, news, product support, portfolio management, plus other \"Marvel\" (the Microsoft online service) applications 7 Horizontal Applications 6 Development Tools Same as Intrabusiness Server, plus Blackbird (OLE-based development tools; see InfoWorld 10/24/94) 5 Server Applications Microsoft EMS E-mail; Microsoft Tiger Video Distribution 4 Database Services Microsoft SQL Server (bundled with Marvel) 3 OS Services Windows NT (bundling MS Services) 2 OS Networking Windows NT (with Marvel Server Code) 1 Hardware Intel or Alpha (DEC) chip\n\nFigure 5\n\nHome Computer Market\n\nThe home computer market is in its incipiency. The most important applications programs on the home client are \"home banking\" (also sometimes known as \"personal finance\") and tax preparation.34 The most successful company in this market, Intuit, Inc., makes the largest selling home banking (\"Quicken\") and tax preparation (\"TurboTax\") programs. The only substantial competition to Intuit's products comes from Microsoft. Yet, despite a very. substantial commitment in marketing staff and resources, Microsoft has gained only a 10% share. Microsoft has therefore elected to take over the home finance market by purchasing the leading software developer, Intuit, rather than by making better products to compete against it. The Microsoft acquisition of Intuit was announced on October 13, 1994 and is still under review by the Department of Justice. It is the largest acquisition in the history of the industry with Microsoft paying twice as much for Intuit as that company was worth in the stock market.35\n\nThe Microsoft acquisition of Intuit is highly strategic. It is a key element in Microsoft's plans to dominate all of information processing and will be discussed in a subsequent section. If the Microsoft-Intuit deal is consummated, it is not difficult to project what the home client will look like given Microsoft's recent announcement concerning \"Marvel\" (described in a subsequent section).\n\nLevel Name Examples 5 Applications Microsoft Works, Quicken (Intuit), TurboTax, Encarta. etc. 4 Development Tools For example, language features of Microsoft Excel 2-3 GUI/OS/Networking Windows 95 with Marvel Client Code 1 Hardware PC Hardware\n\nFigure 6\n\nIn summary, in each of the four components of the software industry, Microsoft's overall business approach and strategy is based on the creation of technological linkages between layers within the same market (e.g., DOS to Windows on the desktop) and between layers in one market and corresponding layers in another market (e.g., Windows NT to the Microsoft Network to Windows 95 on the home client). To fully understand Microsoft's strategy and its economic implications, however, it is necessary to understand two additional strategic Microsoft technologies: OLE and Windows. This Memorandum of Amici will address each in turn.\n\nOLE\n\nOLE (object linking and embedding) is a strategic technology for Microsoft on both the client and server side. It is the Microsoft-imposed standard for sharing information both among applications, and between applications and the operating system. During the Justice Department investigation, desktop application companies complained that Microsoft seeded OLE to its own application developers before giving it to ISV's (independent software vendors), thereby giving its own applications a lengthy head start over the competition.36 As set forth in a subsequent section, these charges are supported by ample evidence and constitute the clearest examples of Microsoft's use of operating system information and specifications to achieve an unfair head start in the application markets. This is precisely the issue raised by this Court.37\n\nEven more striking is the fact that Microsoft continues to exercise the very same strategy on the server side. See, e.g., J. William Semich, Datamation, Aug. 1. 1994, supra, at 40, 41-44 (Ex. 10) (\"If you think OLE is everywhere in the future, the answer is yes\"). Microsoft has made it clear that OLE will be strategic technology for the home-to-business server market, but Microsoft has not provided sufficient specifications to independent database server providers to enable them to release equally well-behaved products on the same time schedule as Microsoft's own products.38\n\nWindows\n\nThe business desktop connects to the server through the Windows operating system (\"OS\") and the home-to-business server (\"online services\") also connect to the home computer through the Windows operating system. Microsoft has several different Windows products that provide OS, GUI and networking capabilities. A brief (and superficial) description of these products is included at this point to avoid confusion.39\n\nDesktop\n\nMicrosoft's first Windows products were targeted for the desktop and were built on top of Microsoft's dominant desktop operating system MS-DOS. Because of their DOS legacy, these products are unable to take full advantage of the capabilities of the 32-bit microprocessors they run on. Microsoft's current product in this area is Windows 3.1, which. due in part to the illegal per-processor licensing challenged by the Government, is pre-installed on most desktop systems presently sold.\n\nMicrosoft plans to proliferate Windows 95 (also known in the press as \"Chicago\" or \"Windows 4.0\") widely next year as the successor to Windows 3.1. Windows 95 is a true 32-bit operating system, but it is being targeted to the mainstream personal computer market. It also includes advanced networking features.\n\nWindows NT was Microsoft's first true operating system for 32-bit microprocessors. NT's principal use is in the server market (discussed below) but Microsoft has also targeted its NT marketing to power users running high-end personal computers or workstations.\n\nServer\n\nWindows NT can also be used as an operating system for a network server. Microsoft markets a version of NT with advanced server capabilities, called Windows NT Advanced Server, as an enterprise-wide computing solution. Microsoft offers a suite of applications for Advanced Server called \"BackOffice\" that includes database services, electronic mail, systems management, and connectivity to mainframe and minicomputers.\n\nMicrosoft's vision for enterprise computing is being marketed through its plans for a replacement for Windows NT currently code-named \"Cairo.\" Cairo brings object-oriented technology into the file server and operating system. Microsoft already controls object standards through it OLE specification, discussed in the next subsection. See J. William Semich, Datamation, Aug. 1, 1994, supra, at 41-44 (Ex. 10).\n\nFree Market Forces in lncreasing Return Industries\n\nIn some industries, companies generally compete on a \"level playing field.\" In such industries, diminishing returns to scale ensure that the forces of the free market will naturally gravitate toward an equilibrium point which maximizes the production of goods and services and results in the most efficient allocation of resources. Under such conditions, antitrust enforcers as well as business executives can count on the fact that superior products will necessarily prevail in free and open competition.40\n\nFree market forces in other industries -- including those at issue here -- do not exhibit such qualities. Rather, they exhibit \"increasing returns.\" In such industries, there is more than one equilibrium point and there is no reason to expect the free market to reach equilibrium at a point that most efficiently allocates resources.41 The markets in such industries can easily be manipulated by a company with a large \"installed base,\"42 with the result that superior products of competitors are not likely to prevail in the free market.43 Indeed, in \"increasing returns\" industries, there is every reason to believe that consumers will get \"locked into\" the first product that appears on a new platform, even if the product is technologically inferior.44 Similarly, a company with a large installed base in one market can give its inferior product in a second market an insurmountable advantage over competitors in the second market by integrating the products from the two markets together technologically.45\n\nSome of the early economic research in the area focused on perceived anomalies -- particular standards that became locked in, notwithstanding their obvious inferiority. Stanford economist Paul David identified several such examples, the most famous of which is the layout of the common typewriter keyboard, known as the \"QWERTY\" configuration because of the order of the keys in the second row of the keyboard.46 Primitive typewriters were unreliable mechanical devices and the QWERTY keyboard, at least according to the folklore, was therefore deliberately designed to be dysfunctional so that typists would not strike the keys so rapidly that the device would jam. Obviously. modem software and computers can process keystrokes far more quickly, yet consumers are locked into the QWERTY standard. There are even allegations \"that the combination of constant repetitive motion and inefficient finger movements that QWERTY requires is the ticket to the most well-known [repetitive stress injury.] RSI. carpel tunnel syndrome.\" yet we go right on teaching it in elementary schools.47 Superior keyboard layouts were developed years ago but were unsuccessful in dislodging the clearly inferior design that established itself as an early standard.48\n\nBy the late 1980's, economic analysis was finally able to explain such situations more clearly. Economists at Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley published \" leading articles demonstrating that market characteristics long viewed as anomalous were, in fact, widespread in high technology industries.49 By the mid-1990's, increasing returns economics has become widely accepted as mainstream economic analysis.50 There is now extensive theoretical literature with direct empirical application to many leading industries, including telecommunications, broadcasting, computers, and ATMs.51\n\nIncreasing returns are present in industries throughout the economy, but two high technology market situations, in particular, give rise to increasing returns. First, users of high technology products are frequently electronically connected in a network. Networks exhibit and produce certain important economic results. Because the purpose of a network is to enable communication with others, the value of the network increases with the total number of users who join the network.52 Consequently, once a network such as a telephone network is in place. a competing network would have to enter the market with at least as large a number of nodes in order to displace (or even compete meaningfully with) the first network.53\n\nA second factor that gives rise to increasing returns is referred to as \"compatibility\" in the economic literature. Unlike more conventional industries, the value of the technology to end users in increasing returns industries increases with the number of users who use compatible technology. While the \"network\" feature draws its force from physical interconnection, the \"compatibility\" factor arises from a dependency of mutual use by consumers without regard to actual physical interconnection.54 For example, although manual typewriters were not connected in a physical network, new users adopted the QWERTY keyboard because it was in wide use by others.55\n\nEconomic analysis demonstrates that superior products do not necessarily prevail in markets and technologies that exhibit increasing returns. Rather, these markets are easily susceptible to \"tipping\" -- once moved off of equilibrium by an event, the market tends quickly toward a single standard that dominates the market:\n\n[N]etwork markets are 'tippy': the coexistence of incompatible products may be unstable, with a single winning standard dominating the market. The dominance of the VHS videocassette recorder technology and the virtual elimination of its Betamax rival is a classic case.\n\nSee Stanley M. Besen and Joseph Farrell, Choosing How to Compete, J. of Econ. Perspectives, Spring 1994, at 118; see also Michael Katz and Carl Shapiro, J. of Econ. Perspectives, Spring 1994, supra, at 106. Once a market is \"tipped\" in favor of a particular competitor, it would take truly massive forces to return the market to a state of equilibrium (i.e., competition). See, e.g., W. Brian Arthur, Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy, supra, at 2, 10-11.\n\nCreating a large installed base is the key to dominating such an increasing returns market.\n\nBecause of the compatibility and network benefits, all else equal, a new user prefers a vendor with a larger total installed base of users. Thus installed bases have a tendency to be self-perpetuating: they provide the incentive for the provision of products (software and hardware) that is compatible with the installed base which in turn attracts new users to the installed base further swelling its ranks ....\n\nGarth Saloner, Econ. Innov. New Tech., 1990, supra, at 140. Indeed, \"de novo entry into a market occupied by vendors with large installed bases is exceedingly difficult.\" Id. at 140.\n\nThe self-perpetuating nature of an installed base in an increasing returns industry causes particular products to become \"locked-in.\" W. Brian Arthur, Scientific American, Feb. 1990, supra, at 99 (Ex. 36). The costs to a consumer of using or switching to a different system are so high that the vendor with the installed base has a substantial advantage over competitors and can, once the base is established, charge consumers supracompetitive prices.56\n\nBecause increasing returns markets are particularly susceptible to \"tipping,\" a company with a monopoly in one market that faces competition in a second market can use the locked-in installed base of the first market to wipe out competition in the second market by \"tipping\" the second market. The monopolist might achieve this result by releasing a \"predatory preannouncement\" with regard to a product in the second market. In markets that feature increasing returns, users will want to be on the same standard as other users, so expectations (what users believe will happen) dominate user choice in the second market -- as opposed, for example, to the inherent technological quality of competing product offerings,57\n\n[A] preannouncement can sometimes secure the success of a new technology that is socially not worth adopting, and that would not have been adopted absent the preannouncement.\n\nJoseph Farrell and Garth Saloner, Amer. Econ. Rev., Dec. 1986, supra, at 942.\n\nSimilarly, a monopolist that is cash rich from monopoly profits in the first market might also \"buy off\" early adopters to create a \"band wagon effect\" in favor of its product in the second competitive market.58 This technique of predation is known in the economic literature as \"penetration pricing.\"\n\nAn installed base advantage might also be achieved by \"penetration pricing,\" the technique of offering low prices to early customers so as to build up an installed base and influence the choice of later adopters. Penetration pricing seems a natural strategy in network industries, and appears prominently in the theory.\n\nSee Stanley M. Besen and Joseph Farrell, J. of Econ. Perspectives, Spring 1994, supra, at 122; see also Janusz A. Ordover and Garth Saloner, Predation, Monopolization, and Antitrust, supra.\n\nFinally, a monopolist with a large installed base in one market might \"tip\" a second competitive market in favor of his product in that market by technologically linking the two products, or by outright bundling of the functionality of the second product into the first product, thereby eliminating the need for the competitor's product in the second market. For example, by subtly altering the tying product so that rival products in the tied market become incompatible with the monopolist's \"standard,\" the monopolist can quickly dominate the second market.59\n\nThe Justice Department's complaint in this case recognizes the critical importance of an \"installed base.\" The complaint alleges that the \"lack of a sizable installed base of users\" constitutes a \"substantial barrier to entry\" for Microsoft's operating system competitors. 59 Fed Reg. at 42,847 (Complaint ï½¶ 15). The complaint also alleges that Microsoft used \"anticompetitive contracting practices\" including \"per processor licenses\" starting as early as 1988 to \"significantly increase the already high barriers to entry.\" Id. at 42,847, 42,848 (Complaint ï½¶ï½¶ 18, 20, 26). The complaint appears to assume that Microsoft's monopoly was lawfully acquired. Id. at 42,847 (Complaint ï½¶ 19). But since Microsoft's installed base of operating system users has increased six-fold since 1988, it must follow that the \"anticompetitive licensing practices\" with which Microsoft is charged had the result of increasing its own installed base at the same time it impeded the development of competitors' installed bases. As set forth in the next section, Microsoft has used its installed base both to preclude competitive entry into the operating system market, and to stifle competition in related markets.\n\nIV\n\nMICROSOFT'S TACTICS AND PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESS\n\nThis section of the Memorandum of Amici will examine Microsoft's overall strategy, the tactics that Microsoft has used in pursuing that strategy, and the likelihood that Microsoft will accomplish its aims. Microsoft, by the admission of its own Chief Executive Officer, intends to dominate all of data and information processing.\n\nThere's no level of performance or specific application of corporate information systems that we don't intend to go after... [and] there won't be anything we won't say to people to try and convince them that our way is the way to go. That's because this new, electronic world of the information highway will generate a higher volume of transactions than anything to date, and we're proposing that Windows be at the center, servicing those transactions.\n\nBrent Schlender, Fortune, Jan. 16, 1995, supra, at 40 (emphasis in original).\n\nTo accomplish these aims, Microsoft has pursued licensing practices that the Government has denominated as \"anticompetitive,\" and has engaged in classic predatory behavior by using its monopoly in one market to achieve monopolies in other markets. This section applies increasing returns economic analyses to Microsoft's behavior and concludes that, unless restrained by Governmental intervention, it is highly likely that Microsoft will achieve its goal of dominating the entire national information infrastructure.\n\nMicrosoft's Strategy\n\nEven if Microsoft's initial monopoly was lawfully obtained, its enormous market power (and particularly the power to leverage into related markets) comes from its installed base in operating systems. That installed base, according to the Complaint, was procured as a result of anticompetitive practices. Indeed, Microsoft's installed base of operating system users has increased more than six-fold (from 18 to 120 million) since 1988, when the company began its anticompetitive practices. Microsoft has used its monopoly and its installed base in a classically predatory manner. It has used its monopoly revenues in one market to drive competitors out of other markets. It has also used its operating system installed base in a predatory manner to \"tip\" adjacent competitive markets in the direction of its own product in those markets, to the detriment of competitors.\n\nMicrosoft's strategy at any particular point on the network (for example, at the home client or at the business desktop) can only be understood and evaluated in the context of Microsoft's overall strategy. Microsoft pursues a strategy of leverage from product markets in which it is dominant, to markets in which its competitive position is weak. It targets particular markets, establishes marketing and, in particular, technological links to those markets from established monopolies, and then leverages its power to monopolize the target markets.\n\nAs used in this brief, \"leverage\" means that Microsoft uses the installed base in a market it dominates (for example, the operating system) to create an installed base in a new market (for example, desktop applications). It uses predatory subsidization, and both marketing and technological linkages, to accomplish leverage, as explained in greater detail in the succeeding pages. For the sake of easy example, Microsoft's horizontal tie-ins within, a single layer represent the most trivial example of its marketing strategy. Thus, Microsoft has trundled for sale a number of desktop applications (under the name, the \"Microsoft Office\"), putting companies like Lotus, WordPerfect and Borland at a competitive disadvantage. Carole Patton, Bundles Are Bad News, Computerworld, Nov. 14, 1994, at 57 (Ex. 8). Microsoft is executing the same tactic on the server side by bundling its \"BackOffice\" products to foreclose meaningful competition at the \"server applications\" layer. See Stuart J. Johnston and Ed Scannell, Computerworld, Oct. 10, 1994, supra, at 4 (Ex. 7).\n\nMicrosoft also pursues other tactics. In particular, Microsoft derives leverage from its control of Windows products and logo; from its use of a consistent graphical user interface; and from its tight technical integration between interconnected machines through the control of standards such as OLE. After establishing market power on one level, Microsoft will target an adjacent layer, subsidize the creation and sale of products at that layer from the monopoly it derived on the first level, establish proprietary technological linkages to the target layer, and then leverage its market power to establish market power in the next layer. Two examples of this within the desk-top side are DOS to Windows, and Windows to desktop applications. In addition, Microsoft uses its market power from one side of the network (server or client) to leverage to the other side, again by establishing linkages. Microsoft is already attempting to leverage its control of the desktop into a control of servers. It will also use its market power in the PC-based financial and text software market, through the acquisition of Intuit, to leverage into the server.60\n\nObviously, control of certain layers in the various markets of the network create greater potential for leverage than control of other layers. In particular, there are a few \"gateway\" layers into the network. Control of these layers represents the most effective platform for leverage (i.e., moving the installed base). Generally speaking, the operating system layers in each box represent the most powerful platforms for both horizontal and vertical leverage.61 For example, Microsoft has already leveraged control of operating systems to desktop applications. It can also leverage control of the desktop operating system (Windows 95) to the server operating system (Windows NT).\n\nControl of the \"gateway\" layers provides greater possibilities for leverage because control of the architecture at those levels effectively controls all higher vertical levels, and also provides significant power at the horizontal interface between the client operating system and the server operating system. This brief uses the term \"architecture\" in the same way as that term is used in the Morris and Ferguson Harvard Business Review article -- namely, the complex of standards and rules that define how programs and commands will work and how data will move around the system. Charles R. Morris and Charles H. Ferguson, Harv. Bus. Rev., Mar. 1993. supra, at 88 (Ex. 16).\n\nBy owning the installed base at a gateway, Microsoft can control not only the architecture at that level but also at all higher vertical levels. For example, by controlling the desktop operating system architecture, Microsoft can easily obsolete or render inoperable Lotus 1-2-3, merely by making a minor change to the architecture. Microsoft can pretextually or otherwise claim the change to be an \"upgrade\" or a \"bug fix,\" but it is the effect of the power to control architecture that is more important than Microsoft's subjective intent.\n\nIf Microsoft controls the architecture at a \"gateway,\" it can loudly proclaim its system to be \"open\" while in truth its architecture remains closed. Thus, for example, Microsoft can claim that its desktop operating system will continue to work with Lotus 1-2-3 or that its server operating system will continue to work with the database products offered by Microsoft competitors (and, to that extent, its system is \"open\"). Because Microsoft can easily obtain competitive advantage over (or outright displacement of) vertically related competitors by upgrades to the architecture, however, its nominally \"open\" system does not provide for effective competition on higher vertically related levels.62\n\nAll companies try to use leverage to some extent,63 but Microsoft has a powerful advantage over its competitors. It has used \"anticompetitive\" licensing practices to acquire a huge installed base and it uses the power of this installed base against competitors in adjacent markets. Microsoft employs multiple linkages and leverage from the different markets (and, in particular, from the gateways) it controls into a single target market, so as to completely outflank and overrun existing competitors in that market.\n\nIn the beginning (for our purposes), IBM had a monopoly in computers and the market for computer products was, generally speaking, vertically integrated. (This necessary background is explained in The Economist, supra, at 3-18 (Ex. 14).) How IBM got this monopoly was the subject of much conjecture and years of litigation, but is irrelevant for our purposes. What is relevant is the fact that IBM, in its rush to get out a personal computer, did not leverage its own power from mainframes. Rather, it procured chips from Intel and an operating system from Microsoft (\"DOS\"), thereby transferring its market power to them as the market for personal computers expanded to displace mainframes and IBM's imprimatur established a standard. In short, IBM empowered Microsoft and Intel to control the architecture for the next generation of computers, and has been playing catch-up ever since. See Charles R. Morris and Charles H. Ferguson, Harv. Bus. Rev., Mar. 1993, supra, at 86, 92 (Ex. 16). See. also Elizabeth Corcoran. Washington Post, Nov. 13, 1994, supra, at H6 (Ex. 44).\n\nBill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, secured control of the personal computer market by riding IBM's coattails. The success of the IBM PC opened a lucrative market for compatible computers, or \"clones.\" At the time, Microsoft was the sole source for a compatible operating system. Accordingly, Microsoft was able to license the operating system (\"DOS\") to compatible makers at significantly higher rates than those charged to IBM. Hence, as the Government's Complaint (¶ 19) explains, \"Microsoft quickly dominated and gained a monopoly in the market for PC operating systems.\" 59 Fed. Peg. at 42,847. More precisely,\n\nDOS would have been worth relatively little had Gates not retained the right to license its use to IBM's rivals. This arrangement -- the source of Gates' wealth and power -- became clearer as IBM set the standard for the burgeoning PC market. By the mid 1980's every rival except Apple computer felt that the only way to compete against IBM was to sell a clone of IBM's PC. Making a clone required, among other things, licensing DOS from Microsoft. Over time DOS became a kind of annuity for Microsoft: buying DOS was the price of admission for entering the PC business.\n\nSee G. Pasquel Zachary, Showstopper: Breakneck Race To Create Windows NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft, 27 (1994).\n\nAs new technologies overcame the old mainframe market, the market for computer products formed into a number of horizontal markets that are vertically related to each other. Charles R. Morris and Charles H. Ferguson, Harv. Bus. Rev., Mar. 1993, supra, at 8 (Ex. 16). There are many competitors at each level that aggressively compete with each other to develop more powerful products at lower prices. Generally speaking, consumers have benefitted from the formation of horizontal markets. Consumers can put a system together using the best and most cost effective products at each level, even if the products are made by different manufacturers. But by using its installed base in operating systems to \"tip\" each of these markets in favor of its own products, Microsoft undermines the competitive process. From the initial monopoly bestowed on it by IBM and the huge installed base secured by anticompetitive practices, Microsoft has leveraged and linked a series of powerful monopolies with the intent of forming a new verticality on the market. After establishing several monopolies with enormous leverage potential, the positive feedback from the verticality imposed by Microsoft will in short order eliminate competition on all horizontal layers within the server and online markets, .just as it is eliminating competition in the horizontal layers on the desktop.\n\nThe Business Desktop\n\nThe Justice Department's Tunney Act filing alleges that Microsoft has monopolized \"the market for PC operating systems worldwide\" for \"almost a decade.\" 59 Fed. Reg. at 42,850. As noted previously, in 1988 Microsoft had an installed base of approximately 18 million operating system users.64 In 1988, Novell (formerly Digital Research, Inc.) entered the X86 operating system market with a competitive product, DR DOS, and it was in response that Microsoft began the \"anticompetitive licensing practices\" identified by the Government. Microsoft continued these practices through mid-1994, and, as noted previously, it was during this period that Microsoft was able to increase its installed base by more than 100 million users.65 As the preceding section explains, it is the size of Microsoft's installed base, rather than merely its market share, that determines the company's true market power. Accordingly. through practices that the Government has identified as \"anticompetitive,\" Microsoft has increased its market power many fold.\n\nHaving gained this market power, Microsoft has used it both to maintain its monopoly in operating systems (described in subsection (a) immediately below) and to obtain a monopoly in desktop applications (subsection (b)). The remainder of this section (subsections (c) through (f)) describe how Microsoft has used its market power to engage in other predatory, conduct in the desktop markets.\n\nEffect of the Monopoly on Operating Systems\n\nMicrosoft's strategy, which was based at the outset on an installed base created in part through anticompetitive licensing practices, succeeded in monopolizing the desktop OS and threatening desktop applications. Once Microsoft had control of the operating system, which is the key architectural technology for desktop computing, it was able to maintain its share, even with an inferior product. The introduction of DR DOS from Novell showed that Microsoft had failed to keep MS DOS abreast of leading technology.66 Yet Novell's compatible offering in the DOS market (DR DOS) stopped selling when Microsoft made it clear that Microsoft would create versions of Windows that were incompatible with DR DOS. It is common for \"better\" products to fail if a competitor controls the architecture in which the product operates. See Charles R. Morris and Charles H. Ferguson, Harv. Bus. Rev., Mar. 1993, supra, at 89-91 (Ex. 16).\n\nMicrosoft was also able to raise prices for its operating system, as its monopoly position continued to solidify and its installed base increased. In the early 1980's, Microsoft licensed MS DOS for $2 - $5 per copy. By 1988, the price was up to $25 to $28. Once Microsoft drove DR DOS out of the operating system market, it was able to double the price it charged, with recent press reports indicating that it is demanding as much as $70 per copy of the forthcoming version of its operating system.67\n\nOverall, Microsoft's strategy has been enormously successful in maintaining its monopoly in operating systems while expanding its installed base. Microsoft's share of all desktop operating systems is a staggering 85 %. See supra note 32. Microsoft's share of the operating system market that runs on X86 chips is even larger -- more than 90%. See id.\n\nEffect of the Monopoly on Applications\n\nHaving entrenched its operating systems monopoly, Microsoft has aggressively leveraged this monopoly to gain a monopoly in business applications. In 1991, Microsoft's senior vice-president Mike Maples expressly stated the company's intention to monopolize the software applications market:\n\nIf someone thinks we're not after Lotus, and after WordPerfect and after Borland, they're confused... My job is to get a fair share of the software applications market, and to me that's 100 percent.\n\nSee Jane Morrissey, Microsoft's Application Unit Seeks Market Dominance, PC Week, Nov. 18, 1991, at 1.\n\nMicrosoft used the monopoly revenues from licensing the operating system to fund the development of applications to run on DOS, in competition with software vendors which had no operating system control (for example, Lotus, Borland. and WordPerfect). But because of the relatively open nature of DOS, competitors like Novell could make \"compatible\" operating systems -- operating systems that would run applications written for Microsoft's MS DOS without modification. Therefore, Microsoft could not exercise sufficient control to give its own applications a strong competitive advantage over the application programs of competitors. The competitors' products were the first developed on DOS and had therefore acquired significant installed bases, as to which powerful network externalities had attached. In order to displace these competitors, Microsoft needed to create a new operating system platform so that its own applications would reach the market on the new platform before its competitors' products.\n\nMicrosoft \"solved\" this problem by (1) developing a new operating environment (Windows) that it totally controlled, (2) targeting a function performed in the application layer that it could either embed in the operating system (for example, the \"graphical user interface\" or \"GUI\" feature) or link with the operating system, and (3) using its power over DOS to migrate users to Windows. Microsoft thereby got more control over the OS, added value to the OS it controlled, and forced independent application publishers to rewrite all of their applications twice (once for Windows and a second time for OLE, as described below). The forced migration that Microsoft effected with the GUI and Windows may be depicted as follows:\n\nBEFORE (See Figure 2) AFTER (See Figure 3)\n\nDOS GUI/Applications GUI/Applications GUI/Applications\n\nDOS/Windows GUI Applications Applications Applications\n\nFigure 7\n\nMicrosoft, in effect, added a new layer to the architecture of the desktop, moving the industry, from Figure 2 to Figure 3 above. Controlling architectures is the key to dominating competition. See Charles R. Morris and Charles H. Ferguson, Harv. Bus. Rev., Mar. 1993, supra (Ex. 16).\n\nMicrosoft leveraged its control over the operating system to control desktop applications, following a carefully crafted plan that utilized the market power of its installed base. First, Microsoft emulated the application program of the market leader in that application (e. g., Lotus, WordPerfect or Borland), breaking the network externality of the installed base by providing file and keystroke compatibility. Microsoft funded the development, marketing, and below-market pricing of its applications from the profits it reaped on the six-fold increase in the installed base of its operating system. Microsoft's\n\nstronghold in operating system software . . . financed Microsoft's push into applications software.\n\nVictor F. Zonana, $l4-Million Deal Microsoft Buys Software Competitor, L.A. Times, July 31, 1987, at 4.68 For years, Microsoft funded \"many versions\" of applications programs before they \"were good enough to grab substantial market share.\"69 But\n\n[b]ecause Windows gives Microsoft a \"pervasive presence on any desktop that matters, Microsoft can subsidize its loss leaders [in applications] and leverage its desktop heritage\".\n\nBarbara Darrow, Developers Brace for Shakeout, Computer Reseller News, Feb. I, 1993 at 28 (quoting Don DePalma, senior industry analyst for Forrester Research). ACCESS, Microsoft's database program, is a case in point. It\n\ncost a staggering $60 million to develop .... By contrast, the [entire 1992 development] budget at Borland was $50 million. At Lotus, it was $35 million. That's not all. Microsoft also had the money to offer an introductory price of $99 for ACCESS -- less than one-third the retail price for similar packages. Result: Microsoft sold 700,000 copies in just three months. The entire market in 1992 was only 1.2 million units.\n\nKathy Rebello, et al., Business Week, March 1, I993, supra, at 88.\n\nUnfair Early Access\n\nMoreover, because of Microsoft's installed base in operating systems, it was able to provide an unfair advantage to its applications in a variety of other ways, as well. For example, Microsoft based its own application programs on components m the operating system that it had unique or early access to. Microsoft claimed it was \"open,\" but actually used hidden features and functions to gain a competitive advantage. Brian Livingston. InfoWorld, Nov. 16. 1992, supra, at 98 (Ex. 19). That is, Microsoft provided a proprietary architecture with a supposedly \"open\" system. See Charles R. Morris and Charles H. Ferguson, Harv. Bus. Rev.. Mar. 1993, supra. The most well-known such example involves Microsoft's \"OLE\" (object linking and embedding) standard.\n\nMicrosoft created interoperability among its own applications, and between its applications and its operating system, by creating a new standard, OLE, which copied functionality from Hewlett-Packard's product New Wave. Stuart J. Johnston, Dangerous Liasons, InfoWorld, April 8, 1991, at 44. With market power on both sides of the interface (i.e., in both the applications and the operating system), Microsoft easily displaced the existing standard in favor of OLE. It embedded OLE functionality into both its operating system and applications, and it heavily marketed this new functionality using profits from its market position in operating systems.70\n\nDuring the very same time period that the Government contends Microsoft was using \"anticompetitive licensing tactics\" to harm OS competitors, applications competitors repeatedly complained that Microsoft was using its knowledge of new operating system features to give its own applications programs a head start and performance advantage over applications competitors. As stated in Section II of this memorandum, throughout the 1980's and early 1990's Microsoft responded to this criticism by asserting that it had erected a \"Chinese Wall\" between its operating system developers and applications developers. According to Steve Ballmer, the senior vice-president for Microsoft's system divisions:\n\n[T]here is a very clean separation between our operating system business and our applications business .... It's like the separation of church and state.\n\nBusiness Week, Nov. 21, 1983, supra, at 114 (Ex. 2).\n\nIn the face of mounting criticism, Microsoft executives adhered to the party line. For example, in 1989, Steve Ballmer again disputed \"the charge that his people gave their counterparts in applications previews of their upcoming systems products.\"71 Microsoft executives repeatedly told the press that a \"Chinese Wall\" was in place. See, e.g., Laurie Flynn and Rachel Parker, Infoworld, Aug. 7, 1989, supra, at 43. Indeed,\n\nGates insisted that Microsoft kept the playing field level by erecting an imaginary barrier between the company's operating systems group and its applications division.\n\nHard Drive, supra, at 308. Even into early 1991, Microsoft executives were claiming that the company had an \"ISV-independent program\" that treated Microsoft applications \"the same as any other ISV [independent software vendor].\"72 Although the FTC began investigating Microsoft in 1990, Microsoft continued to maintain that it had a \"Chinese Wall\" well into 1991.73\n\nBut Microsoft's head start in using OLE in 1991 to the detriment of applications competitors put the lie to such claims. Microsoft incorporated OLE into its Windows operating system and shipped its first completed application incorporating OLE, Excel 3.0, in February. of 1991. at the very same time it was releasing a \"beta version\" of OLE -- not suitable for commercial distribution -- to ISV's. Indeed, the February 1, 1991, issue of Byte Magazine reports the two events in the same issue.74 Microsoft's applications competitors suffered delays of many months as they were forced to rewrite their own applications to make them perform under Windows as well as Microsoft's Excel, which had a head start in using OLE. It was not until many months later that the first third-par"
