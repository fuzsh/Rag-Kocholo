        "text": "Commit, a Vancouver, Canada-based startup that has a unique approach to matching up engineers looking for a new job to early-stage startups that want to hire them, today announced that it has raised a $6 million seed round. Accomplice led the round, with participation from Kensington Capital Partners, Inovia and Garage Capital.\n\nThe company, which focuses on working with remote-first startups, launched in 2019, with co-founders Greg Gunn (CEO) and Beier Cai (CTO), who met as early employees at Hootsuite, bootstrapping the company while they worked out the details of how they wanted Commit to work.\n\n“I was an EIR [at Inovia Capital] and I just saw all these amazing founders that were coming in with world-changing ideas. They raised money, but their biggest challenge was getting an engineer to join them,” Gunn explained.\n\nIn his experience, founders typically look for senior full-stack tech leads to join their company, but it’s exactly those senior engineers that are often already in very comfortable roles at larger companies and taking a bet on an early-stage startup — or even a succession of early-stage startups — is often not the most pragmatic choice for them.\n\nAfter talking to dozens of engineers, the founders realized that many didn’t want to lose the support network they had built inside their current company, both from fellow engineers but also the kind of institutional support you get through formal and informal mentorship and personal development opportunities that most large tech companies offer. In addition, as Gunn noted, “hiring at early-stage startups sucks.” Senior engineers don’t want to have to go through a bunch of technical interviews anymore that test their whiteboarding skills but say very little about their actual capabilities as an engineer.\n\nSo the team decided to figure out ways to remove these barriers. Like a VC firm, it vets the startups and startup founders it works with, so the engineers that come to Commit know that these are serious companies with at least some prospect of raising funding and allowing their engineers to shape their trajectory and grow into what is potentially an early leadership role.\n\nMeanwhile, it vets the engineers by giving them a technical interview so they can get started without having to do another one for every interview with the companies that partner with Commit. As Gunn noted, so far, the average engineer Commit has worked with only met 1.6 vetted founders before they started a pilot project together.\n\nTo mitigate some of the fiscal risks of leaving a large tech company, Commit actually pays the engineers it works with a salary until they find a job. Currently, around 90% of the engineers that start pilot projects with their prospective employees end up in full-time employment.\n\nIn addition to matching up founders and engineers, it also offers its community members access to an active remote-first community of fellow engineers for peer support and career advice, as well as coaching and other transition services.\n\nIn the backend, Commit uses a lot of data to match founders and engineers, but Gunn noted that while the team is very selective and has a tight profile for the people it partners with, it is committed to building a diverse pool of founders and engineers. “The thing we’re combating is the fact that these opportunities have been unevenly distributed,” he said. “Even within the Valley […] you have to be from a socio-economic class to even have access to those opportunities. For us, our whole business model is live where you want to live, but then get access to whatever opportunities you have.” Later this year, Commit plans to launch a project that specifically focuses on hiring diversity.\n\nCommit’s startup partners currently include Patch, Plastiq, Dapper Labs, Relay, Certn, Procurify, Scope Security, Praisidio, Planworth, Georgian Partners and Lo3 Energy. The team started out slowly, working with fewer than 100 engineers so far, but hopes to expand its community to 10,000 engineers within the next 12 months. Starting today, engineers who want to join the program can get on Commit’s waitlist.\n\nSeries C round comes amid growing global demand and larger deployments of OTTO’s proven AMR technology\n\nOTTO Motors, a division of Clearpath Robotics, today announced it has closed $29 million (USD) in Series C funding for the continued expansion of its autonomous mobile robot (AMR) platform. The investment, which follows years of rapid growth, was led by Kensington Private Equity Fund with participation from BMO Capital Partners, Export Development Canada (EDC), and previous investors iNovia Capital and RRE Ventures.\n\nOTTO Motors enables the world’s largest companies to create safer and more productive workplaces with autonomous material handling. This funding will be used to expand OTTO’s global network of delivery partners and accelerate its product roadmap for enterprise customers with emphasis on its industry-leading autonomous technology.\n\nDemand for AMRs has been growing worldwide as manufacturers have struggled to find workers to serve critical needs. The skills gap is projected to leave 2.4 million positions unfilled between 2018 and 2028, according to a 2018 study by Deloitte and The Manufacturing Institute, and the need for automation is projected to grow as companies seek ways to improve business continuity during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Mobile robots are no longer a luxury in the workplace; they are a necessity,” said Clearpath CEO and co-founder Matthew Rendall. “In a post-COVID world, AMRs enhance worker safety and bring resiliency to supply chains. As enterprises adapt, AMR demand will accelerate globally. This investment will enable us to grow to meet the evolving needs of the factories and warehouses of the future anywhere in the world.”\n\n“Clearpath and its OTTO autonomous mobile robots have been on our radar for some time. We see strong trends favouring the acceleration of industrial automation generally, with Clearpath positioned very strongly to benefit from this rapidly growing sector,” said Rick Nathan, senior managing director at Kensington. “OTTO’s technology leads the market for core infrastructure for the factory of the future. It is becoming increasingly important for customers across all manufacturing and a compelling opportunity for our investors.”\n\nOTTO has helped Berry Global Group, a Fortune 500 manufacturer, meet increasing customer demand despite labor shortages at a plant in Kentucky. Berry Global’s fleet of 19 OTTO AMRs operate 24×7 supplying cases to and from automated production machines.\n\n“Our mission to ensure a safe and productive work environment, along with the challenges of persistent labor constraints, has led us to increase investments in creative automation solutions,” said Scott Spaeth, director of corporate automation at Berry Global. “The OTTO vehicles address those challenges and deliver improved operations reliability, while enhancing the working environment for our employees.”\n\nSince launching in 2015, OTTO Motors has emerged as a leader in enterprise AMR deployments. Over 70% of the AMRs installed by OTTO are in Fortune Global 500 companies, including GE, Toyota, Nestle, and Berry Global. In recent months, OTTO has also seen a surge in demand from essential businesses responding to increased operational risks associated with COVID-19, including food, beverage and medical device manufacturing.\n\nIncluding this Series C round, OTTO Motors has now raised $83 million (USD) in funding.\n\nAbout OTTO Motors\n\nOTTO Motors is the industrial division of Clearpath Robotics. OTTO Motors provides autonomous mobile robots for material handling inside manufacturing facilities and warehouses. OTTO is trusted for mission-critical deliveries spanning the most demanding of industrial environments.

On Wednesday, Brightspark is announcing that it has raised $6-million in a deal led by Toronto investment firm Kensington Capital Partners. “They’re building a corporate finance machine” that enables Brightspark to quickly and efficiently raise money from investors, Kensington managing director Rick Nathan said.\n\nTypical venture-capital firms invest in high-risk startups. VC firms usually raise a pool of money from investors and put the cash to work over a fund’s life, charging management fees of 2 per cent of invested capital annually and keeping 20 per cent of gains.\n\nBrightspark’s approach is different. It creates a mini-fund for each startup the partners want to back, typically Canadian firms in flourishing markets such as mobile or artificial intelligence, ideally with a product in market and generating $1-million in revenue.\n\nThe Brightspark team typically commits to invest a range, then turns to a network of more than 2,500 individual “qualified investors” – people with $1-million in assets and an income of at least $200,000 – they have cultivated to finance the fund.\n\nMr. Skapinker co-founded Brightspark in 1999 after selling two successful software firms, Delrina Corp. and Balisoft Technologies, in the previous four years. Ms. Forest, then an investing partner with the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec’s venture investing arm, joined Brightspark in 2003 after previously financing Balisoft and Brightspark’s first fund. Brightspark managed two conventional VC funds launched in 1999 and 2006 that raised $60-million to $65-million apiece, posting a better-than-average annual internal rate of return of 66 per cent after backing Think Dynamics and Radian 6, which both sold for huge gains.\n\nBut when the partners set out to raise a third fund in 2012, they ran into difficulty. The only large investors still backing Canadian venture capital firms at that point either had specific demands – such as governments wanting investments tied to jobs, regions or specific sectors – or urged Brightspark to raise substantially more money than they had in the past.\n\nBut individuals who’d backed Brighstpark’s earlier funds were keen to invest in the deals Brightspark found interesting.\n\nSo the team decided to raise funds one investment at a time to try the model out, starting with a Toronto business-to-business marketplace startup called Hubba Inc. in early 2014. Brightspark charged a management fee of just 1.5 per cent and a 15-per-cent take of the profit. After bringing in friends and family for the first deal, they expanded their network and are hoping to further increase their investor pool by making deals available to clients of wealth management firm Richardson GMP.\n\nSo far, Brightspark has completed nine deals, investing $15-million. The company hit its stride this year, investing $7.5-million in six deals, and aims to invest $10-million or more a year, on par with a venture capital firm investing from a $100-million fund.\n\nVANCOUVER, B.C., Nov. 30, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Announced today, Vancouver-based connected car cloud platform company, Mojio, has secured $30 million CAD in Series B funding to accelerate the global growth of its carrier-grade connected car solutions. Despite multiple offers from global investors, Mojio has deepened its Canadian roots by selecting Toronto-based Kensington Capital as lead investor. The company’s Series B round attracted new investment from Trend Forward Capital and innogy Ventures. All current investors participated again, including the Amazon Alexa Fund, BDC IT Venture Fund, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners and Relay Ventures.\n\nThe connected car movement is accelerating as consumers demand more from their cars. While some new vehicles roll off the assembly line with built-in connected car technology, a huge gap remains for the drivers of the over one billion unconnected cars, who are eager for a user-friendly and affordable upgrade.\n\n“People don’t want to wait for their next vehicle to access valuable safety and security features, let alone another 10 to 15 years for the promise of self-driving cars,” explains Mojio CEO Kenny Hawk. “But they are willing to spend $10 to $15 per month to access actionable, real-world data that empowers smarter decision making around family safety, driving behavior, vehicle maintenance, and that offers a hassle free Wi-Fi hotspot that doesn’t drain your smartphone.”\n\nCurrently operating in five countries with seven wireless carrier customers, including the big three in Canada (Bell, Rogers and TELUS), Mojio’s business model leverages the brand and distribution of major wireless network operators to deliver greater access to affordable connected car services through the combination of a plug and play device and a handy mobile app. The Series B funding will accelerate Mojio’s roll-outs with network operators across the globe. The funding will also fuel product innovation and patent development, including the advancement of machine learning initiatives, ensuring that Mojio’s growing team of engineers, designers, and developers continue to preempt the needs of drivers worldwide.\n\nMojio had the luxury of selecting its funding partners based on strategic merit, not just access to capital. The company chose Canadian firm Kensington Capital to lead the round based on close alignment with Mojio’s core values and growth strategy.\n\n“We are excited to be leading the Series B financing for Mojio, which is exactly the kind of company that we want to partner with,” said Rick Nathan, Managing Director of Kensington Capital, “From its Vancouver headquarters, Mojio is building a world class team with an innovative technology platform gaining rapid customer traction, scaling a global business at the intersection of the IoT and automotive industries.”\n\nMojio has already connected over 500,000 vehicles around the world, ranging from an almost ancient 1996 Audi A4 to a brand new 2018 Volvo V60.
