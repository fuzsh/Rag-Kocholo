Software is a unique construction, incorporating both creative and functional aspects. While creative aspects of software are protected under copyright law, the functional aspects of software may be protectable via patent law. The interaction between patent law and open source licenses is the focus of this chapter.\n\nA patent gives its owner the right to exclude others from making, using, and selling the claimed invention. In contrast, open source licenses grant broad rights to modify, compile, distribute, and use the software. Absent explicit treatment in the license, the patent-related right to exclude and the open-source-granted right to use are at least apparently in tension.\n\nA number of open source licenses address this tension explicitly by including a patent grant in the text of the license. However, just seeing the word “patent” or not in an open source license is not enough to identify whether there is an effective grant of patent rights. For example, the Open Source Initiative has stated its view that all open source licenses implicitly include a patent grant, relying on the text of elements 1 and 7 of the open source definition. Further, even when there is an explicit patent grant, the scope of the patent grant may not be well-defined. Finally, the distribution of open source-licensed software may have implications for patent exhaustion.\n\nThis chapter presents materials related to four separate but related issues:\n\nExplicit licenses: Express language in open source licenses granting patent licenses;\n\nImplicit Licenses: The existence and scope of implied patent licenses in open source licenses;\n\nExpress but Non-specific Licenses: Express grants in open source licenses that do not include the term “patent;” and\n\nPatent Exhaustion: The doctrine of patent exhaustion and its applicability to the distribution of open source software.\n\nStatutory Law\n\nEach area of intellectual property law reserves particular rights to the owner of the corresponding intellectual property. The exclusive rights granted under copyright law are different than the exclusive rights granted under patent law.\n\n17 U.S.C. § 106 - Exclusive rights in copyrighted works\n\nSubject to sections 107 through 122, the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following:\n\nto reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;\n\nto prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;\n\nto distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;\n\nin the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly;\n\nin the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly; and\n\nin the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.\n\n35 U.S.C. 271 - Infringement of patent\n\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this title, whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the United States, or imports into the United States any patented invention during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the patent.\n\nOpen source license analysis begins with the text of the governing statutes. Each license grants to users one or more rights that would otherwise be exclusive to the rightsholder. For both patents and copyrights, there are key terms associated with each right that usually appear in the license text, although in some cases license authors have chosen to use new terms or imprecise language.\n\nThe function of the court system is to interpret the license texts in light of the statutory grants to identify the extent to which a licensor has given permission for the person receiving the code to do things that would otherwise infringe on the applicable patent.\n\nExplicit Patent Licensing\n\nSelections from Open Source Licenses\n\nAbout half of all open source licenses include express patent grants, but the scope of those licenses may vary depending upon the language of the grant. Below are a number of widely-used or noteworthy open source licenses that expressly include a patent grant.\n\nAcademic Free License 3.0\n\nExcerpt from the Academic Free License, Version 3.0\n\n2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.\n\nApache 2.0\n\nExcerpt from the Apache License, Version 2.0\n\n6. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted….\n\nEclipse Public License version 2.0\n\nExcerpt from the Eclipse Public License, Version 2\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS […] b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\nGNU General Public License 2.0\n\nExcerpt from the GNU General Public License License, Version 2.0\n\nPreamble\n\n[…] Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.\n\n[…]\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nGNU General Public License 3.0\n\nExcerpt from the GNU General Public License License, Version 3.0\n\n11. Patents.\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\n\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\nMozilla Public License 2.0\n\nExcerpt from the Mozilla Public License, Version 2.0\n\n2. License Grants and Conditions\n\n2.1. Grants\n\nEach Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n\n[…] under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n\n[…]\n\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n\nThe licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n\nfor any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n\nfor infringements caused by:\n\nYour and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or\n\nthe combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or\n\nunder Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.\n\nDiscussion\n\nHow does the wording of the grant affect its scope? For example, what are the substantive differences in scope between grants covering:\n\n“patent claims … embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor” (AFL3)\n\n“patent claims … that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted” (Apache2)\n\n“combination of the Contribution and the Program if … such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents” (EPL2)\n\n“patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.” (GPL3)\n\nHow do the different open source licenses treat the licensing of subsequent derivative works? Can patent-claim-implementing code be extracted from an open source project and used in a different context?\n\nHow do the different licenses treat the issue of later-acquired patent rights?\n\nThe GNU General Public License, version 2, purports to condition the use of the code on the statement that any applicable patent “must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.” Is this language effective as a patent license?\n\nImplied Patent Licenses\n\nOpen source software licenses are designed to spread: They maximize the ease of distribution and minimize the friction associated with ordinary license negotiations. Typically, an open source license is self-executing , meaning that the a new license grant is automatically given to each person receiving a copy of the covered work upon receipt. As described in De Forest, this act of freely licensing the source code may give rise to an implied patent license:\n\nAny language used by the owner of the patent, or any conduct on his part exhibited to another from which that other may properly infer that the owner consents to his use of the patent in making or using it, or selling it, upon which the other acts, constitutes a license and a defense to an action for a tort.\n\nAs you read this case and the follow-on cases that have further refined the scope of implied licenses, think about whether any of a) the statements in the license itself, b) the actions of the licensor in applying the open source license and distributing copies to the public, or c) the self-executing nature of open source licenses may reasonably give rise to an implied patent license.\n\nCases\n\nDe Forest Radio Telephone Co. v. United States\n\nUnited States Supreme Court (1927)\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims dismissing the petition of the appellant, on the 4th of May, 1925. This was before the effective date of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, by which direct appeals from the Court of Claims under §§ 242 and 243 of the Judicial Code were repealed and the review by certiorari was substituted.\n\nThe De Forest Radio Telephone Telegraph Company filed its petition in the Court of Claims against the United States, seeking to recover for an alleged unlawful use by the Government of certain patented vacuum tubes or audions, used in radio communication. The suit was brought under the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 423, 36 Stat. 851, as amended by the Act of July 1, 1918, c. 114, 40 Stat. 704, 705. The Act of 1910 provided that whenever an invention described in and covered by a patent of the United States should thereafter be used by the Government without license of the owner or lawful right to use it, the owner could recover reasonable compensation for the use in the Court of Claims, provided that the United States could avail itself of all defenses, general or special, which might be pleaded by any other defendant charged with infringement. The amending Act of 1918 enlarged the scope of the Act by providing that the recovery by the owner should include compensation for patented inventions used or made by or for the United States.\n\nThe petition showed, that the two patents involved in the suit were granted to De Forest and by him were duly assigned to the appellant, the company bearing his name, and that that company executed and delivered to the Western Electric Company a written instrument conveying certain rights in the patents, which were subsequently conveyed to the American Telephone Telegraph Company. This contract was set out in the petition. In consideration of one dollar and other good and valuable considerations, it granted a license to make, use, install, operate and lease, and to sell or otherwise dispose of to others for sale, installation and operation, apparatus and systems embodying or made or operating in accordance with the invention. It purported to give this license for the full terms of the patents and for all transferable rights of the De Forest Company in the inventions, except such as were expressly reserved by that company. The reservations included nonassignable rights for the purpose of making the articles in question for, and selling them to, the United States Government for its use. The instrument further provided that the Western Company and the De Forest Company might respectively institute and conduct suits against others for any of the patents within the fields in which each respectively possessed rights, but that all such suits should be conducted at the expense of the party bringing them, that party to retain any judgment recovered in any such suits.\n\nParagraph 12 of the instrument provided that the Western Company might transfer to others, in whole or in part, the rights granted by the instrument, and might assign rights thereunder, or grant licenses, to various persons, firms or corporations for the several uses to which the inventions were applicable. The petition further alleges that the United States, being engaged in war, informed the American Telephone Telegraph Company that it desired to have large numbers of the audions made promptly for it by the General Electric Company and others; and that the American Telephone Telegraph Company replied by writing to the Chief Signal officer of the Army that it would not do anything to interfere with the immediate manufacture of the audions, provided it were understood and agreed that the Telephone Telegraph Company “waived none of its claims under any patents or patent rights owned by it on account of said manufacture, and that all claims under patent rights and all patent questions be reserved and later investigated, adjusted and settled by the United States.” The plan was accepted by the United States, and the orders for said audions were thereafter given by the United States to the General Electric Company and the Moorhead Laboratories, Inc., who made them and delivered them to the Government, which used them.\n\nThe petition further alleged, that, for the purposes of assisting the United States to obtain said audions promptly, pursuant to the orders given, the American Telephone Telegraph Company furnished information, drawings and blueprints to the General Electric Company, and permitted representatives and experts of the United States and of said General Electric Company to witness and study the manufacture of said audions by the Telephone Telegraph Company, all to the end that the audions might be the more promptly made and delivered to the United States for use in the war in which it was then engaged.\n\nAfter the filing of the petition in the suit, it was amended by an averment that, after the audions were made and used by the United States, negotiations were carried on between it and the American Telephone Company, and that the latter company executed a release to the United States and all manufacturers acting under its orders of all claims for compensation for the making and use of the audions, and that the release included “all claims which had arisen or might thereafter arise, for royalties, damages, profits or compensation for infringement of any or all letters patent owned or controlled by the Telephone Telegraph Company, whether expressly recited therein or not, for the manufacture or use prior thereto, and for use by the United States occurring thereafter.”\n\nThe petition was demurred to, the demurrer was sustained and the petition dismissed. It is conceded by the parties that, on the face of the petition, with the contracts which were made exhibits, the De Forest Company and the American Telephone Telegraph Company had each the right to license to the United States the making and use of these audions, and that, if either did so license them, it would be a complete defense to a claim by the other for damages for the tort of infringement.\n\nThe sole question, therefore, which the Court of Claims considered, and decided against the appellant, was whether on the facts recited in the petition the American Telephone Telegraph Company had in fact given a license to the United States to have made and to use these audions, covered by the patents. In other words, was the claim which the American Telephone Telegraph Company had against the United States for the manufacture and use of the audions, based on a contract, or was it based on a tort? If it was the former, it was a full defense to any claim by the De Forest Company. If it was the latter, the De Forest Company was entitled to recover under the Act of 1918.\n\nThe appellant says that the necessary effect of the allegations of its petition is, that the Telephone Company said to the United States, in answer to the United States’ notice that it wished to make and use the audions, “You will be infringing my rights. I shall not stop you but I notify you that I shall hold you for such infringement,” and therefore that the subsequent acts of the United States and its manufacturers were torts. We think a different construction should be given the allegations. The agreement by the Telephone Company that it would not do anything to interfere with the immediate making of the audions for the United States, interpreted in the light of its subsequent action in assisting the United States to a prompt making of the audions for its use, in furnishing the needed information and drawings and blueprints for such manufacture, and in giving to the experts of the United States and its manufacturers the opportunity to witness and study the manufacture of audions by the Telephone Company, to the end that the audions might be more promptly manufactured and delivered to the United States for use in the war, made such conduct clearly a consent to their manufacture and use, and a license, and this without any regard to the effect of the subsequent release by the Telephone Telegraph Company of compensation for such manufacture and use. No formal granting of a license is necessary in order to give it effect. Any language used by the owner of the patent, or any conduct on his part exhibited to another from which that other may properly infer that the owner consents to his use of the patent in making or using it, or selling it, upon which the other acts, constitutes a license and a defense to an action for a tort. Whether this constitutes a gratuitous license, or one for a reasonable compensation, must of course depend upon the circumstances; but the relation between the parties thereafter, in respect of any suit brought, must be held to be contractual and not based on unlawful invasion of the rights of the owner. Concede that if the owner had said, “If you go on and infringe my patent, I shall not attempt to enjoin you, but I shall subsequently sue you for infringement,” the tort would not be waived — that is not this case. Here the circumstances show clearly that what the Company was doing was not only fully consenting to the making and using by the United States of the patent, but was aiding such making and using and, in doing so, was licensing it, only postponing to subsequent settlement what reasonable compensation, if any, it might claim for its license. The case of Henry v. Dick, 224 U.S. 1, in its main point was overruled in the Motion Picture Patents Company v. Universal Film Company, 243 U.S. 502; but that does not shake the authority of the language of the Court in the following passage (p. 24):\n\n“If a licensee be sued, he can escape liability to the patentee for the use of his invention by showing that the use is within his license. But if his use be one prohibited by the license, the latter is of no avail as a defense. As a license passes no interest in the monopoly, it has been described as a mere waiver of the right to sue by the patentee,” citing Robinson on Patents, §§ 806 and 808.\n\nIn this case the language used certainly indicated the purpose of the Telephone Company not to seek an injunction against infringement, and not to sue for damages therefor, but only to sue or seek for an amicable settlement by payment of just compensation. Such action by the Telephone Company was a license, and constituted a complete defense against a suit for infringement by the De Forest Company.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nWang Laboratories, Inc. v. Mitsubishi Electonics America, Inc.\n\nWang Labs., Inc. v. Mitsubishi Elecs. Am., Inc., Fed. Cir. 1997\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nJames Clayton, the named inventor in the patents in suit, joined Wang Laboratories in the fall of 1982. At the time, computer memory components remained relatively large, expensive, and difficult to upgrade. In the spring of 1983, Clayton developed the SIMM as a smaller, lower cost, replaceable form of computer memory. On September 2, 1983, Clayton, with Wang as assignee, applied for a patent on the SIMM invention, application serial number 528,817.\n\n[…]\n\nMitsubishi first met with Wang regarding SIMMs in December 1983. In their meetings, Wang supplied drawings and other details to Mitsubishi and repeatedly requested that Mitsubishi manufacture SIMMs. Mitsubishi researched the possibility of producing SIMMs for Wang, but did not proceed with the project at that time. After Mitsubishi began making 256K memory chips, however, Mitsubishi decided to assemble 256K SIMMs, incorporating the new chips into a SIMM similar to Wang’s, for sale to Wang and others. Mitsubishi declined to assess engineering costs to Wang, contrary to its asserted practice when creating a custom product exclusively for a particular purchaser.\n\nIn 1985 meetings, in the context of ongoing contacts between the two companies, Mitsubishi and Wang discussed Mitsubishi’s new 256K SIMMs. [Footnote Omitted] In one meeting, Clayton suggested that Mitsubishi modify its SIMM by placing the decoupling capacitors on the same side of the substrate with the chips, as in the original Wang design. Mitsubishi complied. Mitsubishi went on to mass produce 256K SIMMs; and in 1987, Wang began buying Mitsubishi SIMMs. Wang never informed Mitsubishi of its patent applications, patents, or of any intent to execute a license or receive royalties until a December 22, 1989 letter accusing Mitsubishi of infringing the ‘605 and ‘513 patents, which had issued in 1987 and 1988 respectively.\n\nWang sued Mitsubishi for infringement on June 4, 1992, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Wang argued that Mitsubishi literally infringed the ‘513 patent and infringed the ‘605 patent under the doctrine of equivalents. Mitsubishi had the case transferred to the United States District Court for the Central District of California and filed counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity, non-infringement, and unenforceability, as well as alleging assorted state and federal antitrust violations. Mitsubishi also asserted several affirmative defenses, including the defense that Wang’s conduct created an implied license.\n\n[…]\n\n…Wang and Mitsubishi fought over the formulation of the implied license instruction to the jury. Wang submitted legal estoppel language; Mitsubishi objected and offered equitable estoppel or estoppel by conduct as the basis of its license. The final instruction merged the parties’ competing proposals into one instruction which read as follows:\n\nOne who owns a patent as patentee or assignee, having the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling what is claimed, may agree to let another do one or more of those acts. This is called a license, and the person allowed to do the set of acts is a licensee.\n\nAn implied license is a form of implied-in-fact contract. In order to proved [sic] the defense of implied license, [\\Mitsubishi] must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) there was an existing relationship between Wang and [Mitsubishi]; (2) within that relationship, Wang transferred a right to use SIMM invention to [Mitsubishi]; (3) the right was transferred for valuable consideration; and (4) Wang has now denied the existence of the right it transferred to [Mitsubishi].\n\nIn deciding whether [Mitsubishi has] proved the existence of an implied license, you may consider statements and conduct of Wang from which one would reasonably infer Wang’s consent to Mitsubishi’s making, using, or selling products to persons other than Wang under the patents.\n\nIf you find that a right to make, use, or sell the SIMM invention granted to [Mitsubishi] then you should find and [sic] implied license was granted to [Mitsubishi] by Wang.\n\nThe relevant question to the jury on the Special Verdict Form read, “Has Mitsubishi proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Wang licensed Mitsubishi to make, use, or sell the subject matter of the ‘513 patent?. The jury answered “Yes.” […]\n\nAfter the verdict, the court held a hearing on Mitsubishi’s equitable defenses, then directed Wang to draft a proposed judgment and findings of fact and conclusions of law adopting the jury’s determinations on the equitable defenses, which Wang did. Mitsubishi objected to Wang’s drafts and protested that, although the findings and conclusions did not cover the implied license, Wang wrote findings on other issues which contradicted and undermined the jury’s implied license verdict. Furthermore, Wang had written that the jury found an implied license, “under the doctrine of legal estoppel.. Notwithstanding Mitsubishi’s objections, the court entered both the Judgment and the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\n\nOn March 6, 1995, the parties argued six motions to the district court. Wang’s motions addressed the implied license defense. First, Wang moved for Rule 50(b) JMOL because Wang believed that no reasonable jury could find Mitsubishi provided valuable consideration for a license, as required by Wang’s formulation of implied license elements based on legal estoppel. Second, Wang sought a partial new trial on the implied license defense. Third, Wang moved to amend the judgment based on its theory that the implied license conclusion mandated a finding that an implied contract existed and that, assuming an absence of other consideration, Mitsubishi must have promised royalties to Wang.\n\n[…]\n\nANALYSIS\n\nWang appeals the partial summary judgment of non-infringement of the ‘605 patent based on prosecution history estoppel, and the resolution of the implied license issue to negate infringement of the ‘513 patent. Mitsubishi cross-appeals from the judgment on best mode, nonobviousness, and infringement.\n\n[…]\n\nThe ‘513 Patent: Implied License\n\nMitsubishi argued at trial that Wang’s conduct had created an implied license to it under the ‘513 patent. The parties agreed to submit Mitsubishi’s implied license defense to the jury and the jury found an implied license to exist. The district court entered judgment on the verdict, and added the rationale that the implied license arose “under the doctrine of legal estoppel. Focusing on the legal estoppel rationale, Wang moved for JMOL or a new trial on the implied license issue because, according to Wang, a reasonable jury could not have found facts to support legal estoppel and because the court misapplied the law of legal estoppel. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) and 59(a). Wang also moved the court to infer contract terms requiring Mitsubishi to pay royalties to Wang as part of the implied license. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). The district court denied the motions. Wang now seeks a reversal of the judgment or new trial on the implied license defense. In an appeal from a judgment following denial of JMOL, we must affirm factual findings that are supported by substantial evidence, we then review legal conclusions to determine whether the factual findings can bear them. Railroad Dynamics, Inc. v. A. Stucki Co. 727 F.2d 1506, 1512, 220 USPQ 929, 935-36 (Fed.Cir.1984); Perkin-Elmer Corp. v. Computervision Corp., 732 F.2d 888, 893, 221 USPQ 669, 672-73 (Fed.Cir.1984). We review the denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. Railroad Dynamics, 727 F.2d at 1512, 220 USPQ at 935-36.\n\nBecause the second step of this review will require us to determine whether the factual findings support the conclusion of law, we must first ascertain what facts the jury found relating to Mitsubishi’s implied license defense. Id. The Special Verdict Form asked the jury to answer only the ultimate question of whether an implied license exists, so the jury instructions serve as our most direct guide to what the jury decided.3 See Newell Cos., Inc. v. Kenney Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 757, 765, 9 USPQ2d 1417, 1423 (Fed.Cir.1988) (we accept factual findings presumed from jury verdict, subject to substantial evidence test). In order to arrive at its affirmative answer on the implied license question, the jury necessarily found that (1) a relationship existed between Wang and Mitsubishi, (2) within that relationship, Wang granted to Mitsubishi a right to use its SIMM inventions, (3) Wang received valuable consideration for that grant of right, (4) Wang denied that Mitsubishi had an implied license, and (5) Wang’s statements and conduct created the impression that Wang consented to Mitsubishi making, using, or selling Wang’s patented inventions, including sales to consumers other than Wang. Separately, the jury found that Mitsubishi made, used, or sold several versions of SIMMs that would infringe the ‘513 patent but for the license.\n\nWith regard to the factual component of our review, Wang challenges only the finding of valuable consideration. Before we can apply the substantial evidence test to this finding, however, it becomes necessary to look beyond the jury instructions and verdict to discover what the jury understood to constitute “valuable consideration.. The district court’s order denying Wang’s motion for JMOL identified three benefits conferred on Wang: (1) by agreeing to manufacture and sell SIMMs, Mitsubishi contributed to a “high volume supply and downward pressure on [the] price” of SIMMs, which benefited Wang as a purchaser of SIMMs; (2) Mitsubishi absorbed development and tooling costs; and, (3) Mitsubishi redesigned its SIMMs to conform to Wang’s preferred design. The district court ruled that each form of consideration was supported by substantial evidence.\n\nLooking to the record in search of substantial evidence, Wang’s own statements show that when the company introduced its SIMM design in June 1983, Wang intended to buy SIMMs from other producers rather than produce SIMMs itself. Eventually, Wang hoped to “get the advantage of the cost reduction because of the volumes involved.. The evidence indicates that Wang considered lower prices and a larger market to be of value to it, as they obviously were as a large user of SIMMs. In time, JEDEC adopted Wang’s SIMM design as a standard in what became a multi-billion dollar market. The market grew; prices dropped. The record contains evidence that Mitsubishi contributed to this advantageous outcome. Clayton’s notes about Mitsubishi, for example, contain references to prices “dropping to mid-teens.. Wang introduced evidence that dozens of producers have participated in making the SIMM market, and that Mitsubishi sold $361 million worth of SIMMs between April 1985 and March 1994. A reasonable person could conclude from the evidence that Mitsubishi supplied consideration to Wang by helping Wang achieve the market scenario it sought and valued.\n\nSubstantial evidence of the second and third benefits also appears on the record. Mitsubishi personnel testified that they made design changes to accommodate Wang’s needs: specifically, moving the capacitors onto the same side of the substrate as the memory chips. Similarly, testimony indicated that Mitsubishi declined to assess development and tooling charges to Wang because it understood Wang was permitting Mitsubishi to sell SIMMs to other customers. Clayton’s notes reveal that, from the first meeting onward, he closely followed Mitsubishi’s development and tooling of SIMMs with 64K or 256K chips in PLCCs. Clayton clearly wanted Mitsubishi to make 64K SIMMs, which Mitsubishi decided against, but Clayton also sought “to open [communication with] Japan for us on a 256K X9 SIMM. All the while, Wang and Mitsubishi exchanged designs and samples. A reasonable person could conclude that Wang received something it valued because Mitsubishi was persuaded to follow Wang’s design suggestions, but was led to believe the resultant SIMMs were not custom products for Wang and did not assess charges. Although Wang points to contrary evidence, we cannot reevaluate credibility or substitute our choices for those of the jury. Perkin-Elmer, 732 F.2d at 893, 221 USPQ at 672-73. Therefore, these findings survive the substantial evidence test.\n\nWith the findings of fact firmly in hand, we now turn to the legal conclusion that an implied license exists. See Met-Coil Sys. Corp. v. Korners Unltd., Inc., 803 F.2d 684, 687, 231 USPQ 474, 476 (Fed.Cir.1986) (implied license is question of law). In patent law, an implied license merely signifies a patentee’s waiver of the statutory right to exclude others from making, using, or selling the patented invention. Spindelfabrik Suessen-Schurr Stahlecker & Grill GmbH v. Schubert & Salzer Maschinenfabrik Aktiengesellschaft, 829 F.2d 1075, 1081, 4 USPQ2d 1044, 1048 (Fed.Cir.1987). In the words of the Supreme Court,\n\nNo formal granting of a license is necessary in order to give it effect. Any language used by the owner of the patent, or any conduct on his part exhibited to another from which that other may properly infer that the owner consents to his use of the patent in making or using it, or selling it, upon which the other acts, constitutes a license and a defense to an action for a tort.\n\nDe Forest Radio Tel. Co. v. United States, 273 U.S. 236, 241, 47 S.Ct. 366, 367, 71 L.Ed. 625 (1927). Since De Forest, this court and others have attempted to identify and isolate various avenues to an implied license. As a result, courts and commentators relate that implied licenses arise by acquiescence, by conduct, by equitable estoppel (estoppel in pais), or by legal estoppel. See AMP, Inc. v. United States, 182 Ct.Cl. 86, 389 F.2d 448, 452 nn. 4-5, 156 USPQ 647, 649 nn. 4-5 (1968); Robert L. Harmon, Patents and the Federal Circuit § 6.2(c) (3d ed. 1994 & Supp.1996); 6 Ernest B. Lipscomb III, Walker on Patents § 20:14-20:17 (3d ed. 1987 & Supp.1995). These labels describe not different kinds of licenses, but rather different categories of conduct which lead to the same conclusion: an implied license. The label denotes the rationale for reaching the legal result.\n\nOne of our predecessor courts observed that “courts generally have first looked for facts which give rise to an estoppel in the process of concluding that there is an implied license.” AMP, 389 F.2d at 452, 156 USPQ at 649. The opinions that hew most closely to the De Forest language and the “entire course of conduct” analysis rely on the doctrine of equitable estoppel, because De Forest requires that conduct of the patentee led the other to act. Bandag, Inc. v. Al Bolser’s Tire Stores, Inc., 750 F.2d 903, 925-26, 223 USPQ 982, 998-99 (Fed.Cir.1984); Stickle v. Heublein, Inc., 716 F.2d 1550, 1559, 219 USPQ 377, 383 (Fed.Cir. 1983). In Bandag, we reversed a conclusion of implied license because the infringer failed to show an awareness of the conduct which supposedly created the license. Bandag, 750 F.2d at 925-26, 223 USPQ at 998-99. In Stickle, we affirmed that no implied license existed absent the required nexus between the patentee’s conduct and the infringing actions, given that the course of infringing action only began later and distinct from the cited conduct. Stickle, 716 F.2d at 1559, 219 USPQ at 383-84.\n\nNeither this court nor the Supreme Court, however, has required a formal finding of equitable estoppel as a prerequisite to a legal conclusion of implied license. See AMP, 389 F.2d at 453-54, 156 USPQ at 651. To do so would remove all distinction between the doctrines. Rather the estoppel doctrines serve as guidelines. See id. at 451-52, 182 Ct.Cl. 86, 389 F.2d 448, 156 USPQ at 649-50. The primary difference between the estoppel analysis in implied license cases and the analysis in equitable estoppel cases is that implied license looks for an affirmative grant of consent or permission to make, use, or sell: i.e., a license. See Stickle, 716 F.2d at 1559, 219 USPQ at 383-84. Equitable estoppel, on the other hand, focuses on “misleading” conduct suggesting that the patentee will not enforce patent rights. A.C. Aukerman Co. v. R.L. Chaides Constr. Co., 960 F.2d 1020, 1041-44, 22 USPQ2d 1321, 1335-38 (Fed.Cir.1992). In Aukerman, we described a typical equitable estoppel situation as one in which (1) the infringer knows of the patent, (2) the patentee objects to the infringer’s activities, (3) but the patentee does not seek relief until much later, (4) thereby misleading the infringer to believe the patentee will not act. Id. at 1042-43, 960 F.2d 1020, 22 USPQ2d at 1335-36. Thus, the two doctrines are not conterminous. Illustratively, both the jury, in its advisory capacity, and the district court decided against Mitsubishi on the defense of equitable estoppel per se, with misleading conduct as a required component of that defense.\n\nLegal estoppel refers to a narrower category of conduct encompassing scenarios where a patentee has licensed or assigned a right, received consideration, and then sought to derogate from the right granted. Spindelfabrik, 829 F.2d at 1080, 4 USPQ2d at 1048; AMP 389 F.2d at 452, 156 USPQ at 649-50. In AMP, for example, a patentee granted a license to, and received payment from, the United States for use of an “idea” which later became the subject matter of its patent. Id. at 453-54, 182 Ct.Cl. 86, 389 F.2d 448, 156 USPQ at 651. The patentee then discovered a preexisting patent covering an aspect of the invention. Id. at 451, 182 Ct.Cl. 86, 389 F.2d 448, 156 USPQ at 648. After acquiring the preexisting patent, the patentee sued the government for infringement of the preexisting patent. Id. The Court of Claims held that an implied license barred patentee from using the preexisting-but-after-acquired patent to derogate from the express license negotiated under the other patent. Id. at 454, 182 Ct.Cl. 86, 389 F.2d 448, 156 USPQ at 651.\n\nWe review issues of law, like the implied license defense, de novo. Guinn v. Kopf, 96 F.3d 1419, 1421, 40 USPQ2d 1157, 1159 (Fed.Cir.1996). In this process, we review judgments rather than opinions. See, e.g., Baxter Healthcare Corp. v. Spectramed, Inc., 49 F.3d 1575, 1582, 34 USPQ2d 1120, 1125 (Fed.Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 906, 116 S.Ct. 272, 133 L.Ed.2d 194 (1995). Moreover, we may affirm a district court’s action where the record offers a route to affirm that neither expands nor contracts the rights established for either party by the judgment. Consolidated Aluminum Corp. v. Foseco Int’l Ltd., 910 F.2d 804, 815, 15 USPQ2d 1481, 1489 (Fed.Cir. 1990). Here, we agree with the district court that the factual findings support the jury’s legal conclusion on the implied license defense, although we do not necessarily agree with all of the district court’s reasoning. The jury’s findings may support an implied license in the nature of legal estoppel given the transfer of a right for consideration and the subsequent suit for infringement, but we instead follow the lead of our predecessor, the United States Court of Claims, and focus on an alternative form of estoppel. See AMP, 389 F.2d at 452, 156 USPQ at 650 (rejected equitable estoppel and affirmed based on legal estoppel).\n\nAlthough judicially implied licenses are rare under any doctrine, Mitsubishi proved that the “entire course of conduct” between the parties over a six-year period led Mitsubishi to infer consent to manufacture and sell the patented products. See De Forest, 273 U.S. at 241, 47 S.Ct. at 367. Furthermore, the level of interaction between the parties while Mitsubishi designed and made SIMMs distinguishes this scenario from Bandag where the infringer based its failed defense on conduct unknown to the infringer when the infringement occurred. See Bandag, 750 F.2d at 925-26, 223 USPQ at 998-99. The record shows that Wang tried to coax Mitsubishi into the SIMM market, that Wang provided designs, suggestions, and samples to Mitsubishi, and that Wang eventually purchased SIMMs from Mitsubishi, before accusing Mitsubishi years later of infringement. We hold, as a matter of law, that Mitsubishi properly inferred consent to its use of the invention of Wang’s patents.\n\nThe findings that Wang bestowed “a right to use the SIMM invention” and that Mitsubishi supplied valuable consideration to Wang, support our holding that Wang’s conduct created a license. This falls short of the express licenses or assignments usually discussed in conjunction with legal estoppel, but it constitutes part of a course of conduct that transcends “unilateral expectations ..․ of one party.” Stickle, 716 F.2d at 1559, 219 USPQ at 383. Wang not only led Mitsubishi to infer consent, Wang obtained payment. Wang publicly announced its desired compensation. Wang also manifested this desire in other ways, for example, by Wang’s efforts at JEDEC to have its SIMM designated a standard. With the contributions of Mitsubishi and others, Wang received exactly the remuneration it desired: Wang’s design is an industry standard, and the benefits of a large market and lower prices for SIMMs redound to this day. In sum, Wang consented to Mitsubishi’s use of the invention, granted the right to make, use, or sell the patented SIMMs without interference from Wang, and received consideration. Therefore, we agree with the district court’s determination, reiterated in denying Wang’s motion to amend the judgment, that Mitsubishi possesses an irrevocable royalty-free license under the ‘513 patent.\n\nBecause the jury’s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and the jury reached the correct legal conclusion based on its findings, we affirm the judgment regarding Mitsubishi’s implied license defense. In reaching this result, we hold that Mitsubishi’s implied license is in the nature of equitable rather than legal estoppel, because the license arose from an accord implicit in the entire course of conduct between the parties as discussed in De Forest and subsequent cases relying on equitable estoppel as a guideline. We further hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Wang a partial new trial on this issue.\n\nA. C. Aukerman Co. v. R. L. Chaides Construction Co\n\nExcerpt from A. C. Aukerman Co. v. R. L. Chaides Constr. Co., Fed. Cir. 1992\n\nAn [equitable] estoppel case … has three important elements. [1] The actor, who usually must have knowledge of the true facts, communicates something in a misleading way, either by words, conduct or silence. [2] The other relies upon that communication. [3] And the other would be harmed materially if the actor is later permitted to assert any claim inconsistent with his earlier conduct.\n\n[…]\n\nThe first element of equitable estoppel concerns the statements or conduct of the patentee which must “communicate something in a misleading way.” The “something” with which this case, as well as the vast majority of equitable estoppel cases in the patent field is concerned, is that the accused infringer will not be disturbed by the plaintiff patentee in the activities in which the former is currently engaged. The patentee’s conduct must have supported an inference that the patentee did not intend to press an infringement claim against the alleged infringer. It is clear, thus, that for equitable estoppel the alleged infringer cannot be unaware–as is possible under laches–of the patentee and/or its patent. The alleged infringer also must know or reasonably be able to infer that the patentee has known of the former’s activities for some time….\n\nThe second element, reliance… is essential to equitable estoppel. The accused infringer must show that, in fact, it substantially relied on the misleading conduct of the patentee in connection with taking some action….\n\nFinally, the accused infringer must establish that it would be materially prejudiced if the patentee is now permitted to proceed.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe De Forest court found that the patent owner’s statements and ongoing conduct implied a license even when the patent owner indicated that royalties might later be assessed. What kind of common actions by companies releasing code under an open source license might similarly give rise to an implied patent license?\n\nThe Wang court lays out different circumstances under which a court may infer a patent license. One of those is “an affirmative grant of consent or permission to make, use, or sell.” Is distribution of source code, that, when compiled, implements a patented method or embodies a patented system an affirmative grant to “make” or “use” that method or system?\n\nAnother fact pattern identified by the Wang court is legal estoppel: “scenarios where a patentee has licensed or assigned a right, received consideration, and then sought to derogate from the right granted.” In the context of open source, rights are licensed to recipients via the open source license. Does the use of the code by others provide the necessary consideration to support a theory of legal estoppel? (Cf. the establishment of the SIMM as a standard in Wang, and the following in Jacobsen v. Katzer: “The lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration, however. There are substantial benefits, including economic benefits, to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties.” Jacobsen v. Katzer, 535 F.3d 1373, 1379).\n\n“Equitable estoppel… focuses on “misleading” conduct suggesting that the patentee will not enforce patent rights.” (Wang at 1271). Is distribution of source code or binaries under an open source license the sort of conduct that suggests non-enforcement of patent rights? Is the name of the copyright holder on the license enough to make the user of the open source aware “of the patentee and/or its patent”? (Aukerman at 1042)\n\nLimitations on Implicit Patent Licenses\n\nThe general rule is that the existence of an explicit patent clause in an agreement will foreclose the finding of any implied license with a broader grant.\n\nThe following cases discuss the scope of patent grants when there is ambiguous express language dealing with the issue. Think about how these cases might apply to the GPL version 2, which discusses patents but does not include specific grant language.\n\nState Contracting & Engineering Corp. v. Florida\n\nState Contr. & Eng’g Corp. v. Florida, Fed. Cir. 2001\n\n… The contract in question was drafted by the State of Florida, and was lengthy. It incorporated what are known as value engineering provisions – designed to encourage contractors to develop better methods of doing the job. As noted above, the contract provided for additional payments to the contractor if it developed such methods and allowed the state to use these methods on the contract and on option contracts free of charge.\n\nThe relevant portion of the contract, section 4-3.5.8 of the FDOT Standard Specifications, entitled “Department’s Future Rights to a VECP,” provided:\n\nIn the event of acceptance of a VECP, the Contractor hereby grants to the Department all rights to use, duplicate or disclose, in whole or in part, in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or to permit others to do so, data reasonably necessary to fully utilize such proposal on this and any other Department contract.\n\n(emphases added [in original]). These provisions were not limited to the contract in question, but extended to all future State of Florida use. The district court found this language to be unambiguous and held that “Plaintiffs agreed in the VECP to allow FDOT to utilize their then unpatented data, without any agreement to compensate Plaintiffs for future use, beyond the instant contract savings and any optional work included in the original contract.” Final Order, slip op. at 12-13. While we agree with the district court that this language is unambiguous, we disagree with the district court’s interpretation of this language. We conclude that the contract does not provide a license for patent rights to the private contractors.\n\nWhether express or implied, a license is a contract ‘governed by ordinary principles of state contract law.’” McCoy v. Mitsuboshi Cutlery, Inc., 67 F.3d 917, 920 36 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1289, 1291 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (quoting Power Lift, Inc. v. Weatherford Nipple-Up Sys., Inc., 871 F.2d 1082, 1085, 10 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1464, 1466 (Fed. Cir. 1989)). Although we apply Florida law in construing the contract, it is significant that the Supreme Court has recognized that patent rights and trade secret rights are quite distinct, and that a contract may provide for different treatment of the two. For example, in Aronson v. Quick Point Pencil Co., 440 U.S. 257, 262, 59 L. Ed. 2d 296, 99 S. Ct. 1096 (1979), the Supreme Court held that even though a patent application had not issued, the parties’ agreement for the payment of a royalty for the use of proprietary technology was valid, because “state law is not displaced merely because the contract relates to intellectual property which may or may not be patentable.” So too in Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 474, 491-93, 40 L. Ed. 2d 315, 94 S. Ct. 1879 (1974), the Supreme Court held that Ohio’s law protecting trade secrets was not preempted by the federal patent laws because the trade secret law did not clash with the objectives of the federal patent law.\n\nThe right to use State Contracting’s proprietary technology on the original contract was covered by the supplemental VECP agreement itself as discussed above. The only rights that the state acquired for future contracts were by virtue of section 4-3.5.8. To be sure, the provision apparently contemplated that State Contracting’s “proposal” would be used on “other Department contracts.” But that section only conveyed rights to use “data” in future contracts, and did not in terms convey the right to manufacture the sound barriers using plaintiffs’ design or to use plaintiffs’ manufacturing method. Most significantly the section did not explicitly convey any patent rights, require the contractor to surrender its rights to the technology, or bar the contractor from securing a patent on the invention.\n\nThe contract’s failure to explicitly provide for the licensing of patent rights is a glaring omission, particularly where, as here, the contracting parties clearly contemplated that there might be relevant patents. Section 7-3 of the FDOT Standard Specifications, entitled “Patented Devices, Materials and Processes,” provides: “It is agreed that, without exception, contract prices are to include all royalties and costs arising from patents, trademarks, and copyrights, in any way involved in the work.” The provision for licensing of patents is limited to work under the contract and does not convey any license to future use of the patented technology. The existence of this provision shows that, if the parties had intended to convey other patent rights, they would have done so explicitly.\n\nUnder these circumstances we think it clear that the contract did not in fact provide a license for patent rights to the private contractors under future contracts. The State of Florida drafted the contract, and Florida law requires that it be construed against the drafter. Golden Door Jewelry Creations, Inc. v. Lloyds Underwriters Non-Marine Ass’n, 117 F.3d 1328 (11th Cir. 1997). Therefore, we vacate the district court’s grant of summary judgment to the private contractors on the patent infringement counts (counts III and VII), and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nHilgraeve Corp. v. Symantec Corp.\n\nHilgraeve Corp. v. Symantec Corp., 265 F.3d 1336, Fed. Cir. 2001\n\n[…]\n\nIV. Symantec’s Licensing Defense\n\nSymantec urges that even if we vacate the district court’s grant of summary judgment of non-infringement, the judgment can be affirmed on an alternative ground, namely that Symantec was licensed to practice the patent. We cannot agree.\n\nThe district court held that Symantec had no license defense for the period prior to March 2, 1999, because the purported transfer of patent rights from Delrina (Delaware) to Delrina (Canada) under the June 30, 1993 SDCS agreement was ineffective. While the district court appears to have been correct, we believe that there is a more fundamental defect in Symantec’s license defense argument - Delrina (Delaware) itself never acquired a transferable license to practice the ‘776 patent, and Delrina (Delaware) therefore could not sub-license the ‘776 patent either before March 2, 1999, or thereafter.\n\nUnless the ‘776 patent was licensed under the June 30, 1993 Agreement, Symantec agrees that it could not acquire a license. Symantec also admits that there is no express language in the June 30, 1993 Technology Transfer Agreement licensing or transferring rights to the ‘776 patent or any other Hilgraeve patent. Instead, Symantec points to language in the paragraph 2.1 of the Agreement providing that “HILGRAEVE sells, conveys, assigns and transfers to DELRINA DELAWARE and to HILGRAEVE, as joint tenants and not as tenants in common, all copyright rights in the Software, “ and that Hilgraeve acknowledged in paragraph 9.1 that as part of the transfer “HILGRAEVE has also agreed to transfer the necessary know-how and technical expertise to DELRINA DELAWARE with respect to the Software.” On the basis of this language, Symantec urges us to find that:\n\n‘Software’ is more than source code and object code. . . . When read in conjunction with the . . . ‘know-how’ and ‘technical expertise’ transferred to Delrina (Delaware), Delrina (Delaware) essentially acquired Hilgraeve’s entire knowledge base with respect to [Hilgraeve’s] products. Since the Software included in-transit anti-virus features, Delrina acquired Hilgraeve’s knowledge base with respect to those in-transit anti-virus features and could use that knowledge base as it pleased.”\n\nIn summary, Symantec urges us to find that “the Technology Transfer Agreement covered the technology in this case, which is allegedly covered by the ‘776 Patent.”\n\nWhatever the definition of “knowledge base” proposed by Symantec, we cannot conclude that rights to the ‘776 patent were transferred by the Technology Transfer Agreement. Under Ontario law, “effect must first be given to the intention of the parties, to be gathered from the words they have used . . . .” Consol. Bathurst Exp. Ltd. v. Mut. Boiler & Mach. Ins. Co., 1 S.C.R 888, 888 (Can. 1980). When the language of a contract is clear and unambiguous, only the contract is considered for interpretation, not extrinsic evidence. Indian Molybdenum v. The King, 3 D.L.R. 497, 502 (Can. 1951). Here, the contract provided for Hilgraeve to transfer “all copyright rights in the Software,” but failed to mention the transfer of patent rights. From the terms of the contract we cannot conclude that the parties intended to transfer any patent rights. Symantec relies on Allan v. Bushnell T.V. Co., Ltd., 1 D.L.R. (3d) 534, 539 (Ont. High Ct. 1968) for the proposition that “unexpressed terms [are implied] to implement [the] parties’ presumed intention.” Allan, however, stated that\n\nthe presumption is against the adding to contracts of terms which the parties have not expressed. The general presumption is that the parties have expressed every material term . . . . But . . . there may be cases where obviously some term must be implied if the intention of the parties is not to be defeated, some term of which it can be predicated that ‘it goes without saying’, some term not expressed but necessary to give to the transaction such business efficacy as the parties must have intended.\n\nId. Allan was a case involving a contract between a broadcasting company and a news service in which the unexpressed term which was implied in the contract was that the news to be supplied to the company by the service had to be “accurate.” Here, we cannot say (and it does not “go without saying”) that where the contract provided for the transfer of copyrights in the software, but failed to mention the transfer of patent rights, that we must imply such a term to the contract. The contract has a business efficacy without adding this unexpressed term to it.\n\nMoreover, in the subparagraph immediately following the paragraph 2.1 pertaining to the transfer of copyrights, the contract refers to other intellectual property rights. In paragraph 2.2, the parties agreed that Hilgraeve “shall not assert against DELRINA DELAWARE, any other intellectual property right, including patent rights, it has or may have in the future, with respect to the production, copying, licensing of the Software, or the exercise by DELRINA DELAWARE of any rights transferred hereunder.” Since the contract specifically mentions patent rights in paragraph 2.2, we cannot say that the omission of mention of patent rights in paragraph 2.1, which transferred rights to copyrights in the Software, was accidental or that the transfer of patent rights is implicit anywhere the contract. Cf. State Contracting & Eng’g Corp. v. Florida, 258 F.3d 1329, 59 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1498 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (applying Florida law to construe an agreement).\n\nSymantec also contends that the covenant not to sue for patent infringement in paragraph 2.2 is equivalent to a freely transferable license to the patent. This court has stated that “licenses are considered as nothing more than a promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee.” Jim Arnold Corp. v. Hydrotech Sys., Inc., 109 F.3d 1567, 1577, 42 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1119, 1127 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The covenant not to sue in paragraph 2.2 does not grant a transferable license to the patent.\n\nDiscussion\n\nA typical rule of interpretation is that contracts are “construed against the drafter,” and that “effect must first be given to the intention of the parties.” How might these rules apply in the context of open source licenses, where the party that drafted the license is probably not the party using the license to release code, and there might not be a unity of interest between the licensor and licensee?\n\nThe court in State Contracting found that there was licensing of both trade secrets and patents, but only the future use of trade secrets was contemplated under the contract. To what extent is it relevant that the contract in State Contracting “only conveyed rights to use ‘data’ in future contracts,” as opposed to language that implied patentable elements like processes?\n\nIs it significant that the contract in Hilgraeve provided for the transfer of copyrights, as opposed to the licensing of the copyrights? Would a court be more likely to find that the repeated granting of a license, such as occurs in open source licensing, to support an implied right to use any implicated patents?\n\nExpress but Non-Specific Licenses\n\nOne issue that comes up in the context of open source licenses is license ambiguity. Many open source licenses were not written by people with legal training, and other licenses were written at a time when software was not widely believed to be patentable. As a result, many open source licenses are ambiguous relative to the question of patent rights: The licenses include express language that suggests the existence of a patent right, such as the term “use,” but the specific terms “patent” or “patent license” are not part of the text of the license.\n\nAs discussed above, the existence of some patent language in a license will usually prevent the finding of an implicit patent license. But an express grant with ambiguous scope may constitute an express patent license.\n\nSelected Open Source Licenses\n\nThe licenses below are some of the shortest and most permissive open source licenses available. As you read the licenses below, note any use of language that may implicate the reserved rights under patent law (to make, use, offer to sell, sell, and import).\n\nThe BSD License\n\nThe 2-Clause BSD License , 1999.\n\nNote: The “original” BSD License had four clauses. The 4-clause version was superseded by 3-Clause and 2-Clause BSD licenses, each removing one of the original conditions. The preamble has remained the same in all versions of the license.\n\nCopyright (c) <year>, <copyright holder> All rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\nRedistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\nRedistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS “AS IS” AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Is that a patent grant or verbal shorthand for “create copies of the software in a computer memory and interpret the copy by means of a processor”? Could it be both?\n\nTo what extent does the right the “distribute [the] software … with or without fee” implicate the patent-reserved right to “sell” or “offer to sell” the patented item?\n\nSoftware has both expressive (copyright-protected) and functional (patent-protected) elements inextricably bound together. In the case of a “mixed” work such as software, does the copyright-denominated license to “copy” or “make derivative works” necessarily implicate the patent-denominated right to “make” the patented item?\n\nAs noted before, it is a standard rule of contract interpretation to construe the terms of the license against the drafter. But typically, the open source licensor is not the same person as the license drafter. Further, open source licenses are fixed, and not subject to negotiation. Organizations choose to use particular open source licenses for many reasons. Can the use of a license that was not drafted by the licensor be construed against the licensor?\n\nCases\n\nThe discussion in the previous section was focused on license terms that specifically reflect or at least implicate reserved rights under patent law. A careful review of the language, however, shows that there are also broad, but unspecific grants of rights in many open source licenses. For example, the MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software… to deal in the Software without restriction…\n\nThe GNU GPL, version 2:\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted…\n\nAs you read the following cases, think about whether these statements may act as express patent licenses granted to recipients of the open source software.\n\nA. Natterman & CIE GmBH v. Bayer Corp.\n\nA. Natterman & CIE GmBH v. Bayer Corp., 428 F. Supp. 2d 253, E.D.Pa, 2006.\n\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\n\nANITA B. BRODY, District Judge.\n\nIn this patent infringement action, Plaintiffs A. Nattermann & Cie GmbH (“Nattermann”) and Aventis Behring L.L.C. bring suit against Defendants Bayer Corporation and Bayer Healthcare LLC for alleged infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,565,427 (“the ‘427 patent”). Defendants bring counterclaims against Plaintiffs and Counterclaim Defendant Aventis Behring GmbH. Plaintiff Nattermann is the owner of the ‘427 patent, Counterclaim Defendant Aventis Behring GmbH has a non-exclusive license to the patent, and Plaintiff Aventis Behring L.L.C. has a sublicense. The ‘427 patent involves a drug used in the treatment of hemophilia. Plaintiffs claim that an anti-hemophilila drug marketed by Defendants under the name KOGENATE® FS infringes the ‘427 patent. Defendants bring counterclaims against Plaintiffs for, inter alia, breach of a 1998 Supply Agreement entered into by Bayer and Centeon L.L.C., a predecessor of Plaintiff Aventis Behring L.L.C., under which Bayer was to manufacture its KOGENATE® product for Centeon L.L.C.\n\nBefore me is Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on their fourth affirmative defense of license under the ‘427 patent. Defendants claim that the 1998 Supply Agreement between Bayer and Centeon L.L.C. granted Defendants an express license under the ‘427 patent and that this license is a complete defense to the instant patent infringement suit. Also before me is Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on Defendants’ affirmative defense of license and Defendants’ third counterclaim for breach of contract. Plaintiffs seek a judgment that Defendants have no express or implied license under the ‘427 patent and that, as a result, Defendants’ counterclaim for breach of contract fails as a matter of law. For the reasons that follow, I will deny both motions.\n\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nFor purposes of the instant motions, the relevant undisputed facts are as follows.\n\nA. The 1993 Patent Settlement Agreement\n\nIn 1993, Defendants’ predecessor Miles Inc. (“Miles”) and Rhône Poulenc Rorer Inc. (“RPR”), parent company of Centeon L.L.C.’s predecessor Armour Pharmaceutical Co. (“Armour”), signed an agreement (“the 1993 Patent Settlement Agreement”) settling their previous patent litigation. As a result of the 1993 Patent Settlement Agreement, Bayer AG, the parent company of Miles, received an express license to certain patents, known as the “Scripps patents,” involving recombinant factor VIII technology used in the treatment of hemophilia.\n\nB. The 1994 Supply Agreement\n\nAs part of the 1993 Patent Settlement Agreement, Miles and Armour, the predecessors of Bayer and Centeon L.L.C. respectively, entered into the 1994 Supply Agreement. The 1994 Supply Agreement obligated Bayer to supply Centeon L.L.C. “with certain defined quantities of recombinant factor VIII (the ‘Product’ as further defined below). . . .” The “Product” of the 1994 Supply Agreement consisted of Bayer AG’s first-generation KOGENATE 0 product. Under the 1994 Supply Agreement, Bayer supplied Centeon L.L.C. with KOGENATE®, and Centeon L.L.C. sold this product under its own HELIXATE® trade-name.\n\nSection 9 of the 1994 Supply Agreement states:\n\nNo license, express or implied, is granted by one party to the other hereunder, save for those purposes which permit performance, by each party, of its obligations under this Agreement.\n\nC. The 1998 Supply Agreement\n\nFrom 1997 to 1998, Bayer and Centeon L.L.C. renegotiated the 1994 Supply Agreement and formed the 1998 Supply Agreement. Bayer and Centeon L.L.C. renegotiated the Supply Agreement, in part, so that each party could secure continued access to future recombinant factor VIII products. Under the 1998 Supply Agreement, Bayer agreed to “continue to provide quantities of human recombinant Factor VIII to Centeon under the terms and conditions specified herein. . . .” The 1998 Supply Agreement was to be “considered part of the Settlement Agreement between Bayer AG and Armour just as the 1994 Agreement was part of said Settlement Agreement.” The parties incorporated Section 9 of the 1994 Agreement into Section 10 of the 1998 Agreement.\n\nD. KOGENATE® FS and the 1998 Supply Agreement\n\nWhen the parties negotiated and signed the 1998 Supply Agreement, Bayer was marketing its first-generation KOGENATE® product, which does not infringe the ‘427 patent. The 1998 Supply Agreement provides that Centeon L.L.C. and its successors would receive access to later improvements of Bayer’s KOGENATE® product. One such contemplated improvement that was specifically contemplated in the Agreement was called KOGENATE® II. KOGENATE® II was defined in the 1998 Supply Agreement as “an antihemophilic Factor VIII (Recombinant) protein to be formulated as a sterile, stable, purified, freezedried concentrate, purified and formulated without the use of albumin.” Bayer has assigned the trademark KOGENATE® FS to the KOGENATE® II Product referenced in the 1998 Supply Agreement. At the time Bayer and Centeon L.L.C signed the 1998 Supply Agreement, Bayer had not provided Centeon L.L.C. with full specifications for any future recombinant factor VIII product in development, including KOGENATE® FS.\n\n[…]\n\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\nDefendants move for summary judgment on the affirmative defense of express license under the ‘427 patent. Plaintiffs cross-move for summary judgment on Defendants’ affirmative defense of license, seeking judgment as a matter of law that Defendants have no license to the ‘427 patent, either express or implied. Plaintiffs also move for summary judgment on Defendants’ third counterclaim (breach of the 1998 Supply Agreement), which they assert is dependent on a finding that the Agreement created a license to the ‘427 patent. All of these issues boil down to the single question of whether Defendants were licensed under the ‘427 patent.\n\nA. Background\n\nA license, whether express or implied, is a defense to patent infringement. [FN8] See Carborundum Co. v. Molten Metal Equip. Innovations, 72 F.3d 872, 878 (Fed. Cir.1995). The alleged infringer has the burden of establishing this affirmative defense. Id. It has been observed that:\n\n[n]o formal granting of a license is necessary in order to give it effect. Any language used by the owner of the patent, or any conduct on his part exhibited to another from which that other may properly infer that the owner consents to his use of the patent in making or using it, or selling it, upon which the other acts, constitutes a license and a defense to an action for a tort.\n\nWang Labs., Inc. v. Mitsubishi Electronics Am., Inc., 103 F.3d 1571, 1580 (Fed.Cir. 1997) (quoting De Forest Radio Tel. & Tel. Co. v. United States, 273 U.S. 236, 241, 47 S.Ct. 366, 71 L.Ed. 625 (1927)). Defendants claim that the 1998 Supply Agreement between Plaintiffs’ predecessor Centeon L.L.C. and Bayer gave Defendants an express license to manufacture KOGENATE® FS, the drug that Plaintiffs allege infringes the ‘427 patent. The determination of whether there is an express license or an implied license to a patent is “governed by ordinary principles of state contract law.” State Contracting & Eng’g Corp. v. Florida, 258 F.3d 1329, 1339 (Fed. Cir.2001) (quoting McCoy v. Mitsuboshi Cutlery, Inc., 67 F.3d 917, 920 (Fed.Cir. 1995)).\n\nHere, the parties agree that Connecticut law applies to the interpretation of the 1998 Supply Agreement upon which Defendants’ claim of express license is based. Under Connecticut law, “[a]lthough ordinarily the question of contract interpretation, being a question of the parties’ intent, is a question of fact, where there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law.” Hanks v. Powder Ridge Restaurant Corp., 276 Conn. 314, 885 A.2d 734, 739 (2005) (internal citations omitted).\n\nB. Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment\n\nDefendants do not dispute that no license to the ‘427 patent is explicitly mentioned in the 1998 Supply Agreement or any of its precursors. However, Defendants claim that Section 10 of the 1998 Supply Agreement created an express license to the ‘427 patent:\n\nNo Express or Implied License\n\nNo license, express or implied, is granted by one party to the other hereunder, save for those purposes which permit performance, by each party, of its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n(Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. Ex. A at 27 (emphasis added).) Defendants claim that the plain meaning of Section 10 is to create express licenses to such patents as “permit performance, by each party, of its obligations under this Agreement.” Defendants claim that because a license to the ‘427 patent was essential to Bayer’s performance of the contract, this provision creates an express license to that patent. They cite various other provisions of the Supply Agreement in support of the contention that Bayer required a license to the ‘427 patent in order to perform its obligations under the Agreement.\n\nIn order for Defendants to obtain summary judgment on the question of express license, it would have to be clear from the four corners of the 1998 Supply Agreement that Section 10 grants Bayer an express license to the ‘427 patent. The fact that the provision is entitled “No Express or Implied License” and provides, in part, that “[n]o license, express or implied, is granted by one party to the other hereunder” is at least enough to raise sufficient ambiguity to preclude summary judgment for Defendants.\n\nC. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment\n\nPlaintiffs raise several arguments for why summary judgment for Defendants is improper and why, in fact, summary judgment should be granted in Plaintiffs’ favor: (1) Centeon L.L.C. never had the right to license the ‘427 patent to Bayer in the first place; (2) even if it did, the plain terms of the 1998 Supply Agreement foreclose any express or implied license to the ‘427 patent; and (3) even if the Supply Agreement were construed to grant an express or implied license to patents necessary to the performance of the parties’ contractual obligations, the ‘427 patent would not fall within the scope of such a license. An absence of genuine issues of material fact as to any one of these three issues might entitle Plaintiffs to summary judgment. Thus, I will address each argument in turn.\n\n[…]\n\n2. Whether the 1998 Supply Agreement forecloses any license to the ‘427 patent\n\nPlaintiffs also argue that the plain terms of the 1998 Supply Agreement unambiguously negate the existence of any license to the ‘427 patent, express or implied. Under Connecticut law, contract interpretation is a question of fact for the jury unless the parties’ intent is “clear and unambiguous” from the four corners of the contract, in which case it becomes a question of law for the court. Peter-Michael, Inc. v. Sea Shell Assocs., 244 Conn. 269, 709 A.2d 558, 562 (1998); see also McCann Real Equities Series XXII, LLC v. David McDermott Chevrolet, Inc., 93 Conn.App. 486, 890 A.2d 140, 153 (2006) (“When only one interpretation of a contract is possible, the court need not look outside the four corners of the contract.”). The parties’ intent is not clear and unambiguous from the four corners of the 1998 Supply Agreement with respect to whether the Agreement grants licenses to patents necessary for the performance of the parties’ contractual obligations.\n\nSection 10 of the 1998 Supply Agreement provides:\n\nNo license, express or implied, is granted by one party to the other hereunder, save for those purposes which permit performance, by each party, of its obligations under this Agreement.\n\nIn order to grant summary judgment for Plaintiffs on this question, I would have to find that the language of Section 10 clearly and unambiguously forecloses any express or implied license to the ‘427 patent. Section 10’s plain terms do not do this. Plaintiffs would have me read this provision as stating simply that “no license, express or implied, is granted by one party to the other hereunder.” Such a statement would indeed have been an unambiguous expression that the contract foreclosed any express or implied licenses.\n\nYet Section 10 does not say that; rather it states that the Agreement creates no express or implied licenses “save for those purposes which permit performance, by each party, of its obligations under this Agreement.” A plausible reading of this provision would thus be that it does grant such licenses as are necessary to the performance of the 1998 Supply Agreement.\n\nAt the very least, Section 10 does not clearly and unambiguously rule out an implied license to the ‘427 patent. [FN12] To the contrary, the provision seems to contemplate the possibility that one or more patent licenses would be necessary to the performance of the Agreement, and carves out such licenses from the general statement that “no license, express or implied, is granted by one party to the other hereunder.” Thus, Plaintiffs are not entitled to summary judgment because the 1998 Supply Agreement does not, as a matter of law, foreclose the possibility of a license to the ‘427 patent. There is a genuine issue of material fact as to this question.\n\nPlaintiffs also argue that, read as a whole, the 1998 Supply Agreement cannot be interpreted to create a license to the ‘427 patent, because it incorporates express licenses to other patents while making no mention of the ‘427 patent. Plaintiffs rely on the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius, under which the express mention of one thing (such as the grant of a license) in a written document is presumed to exclude another that is not mentioned. The problem with this argument is that nowhere does the 1998 Supply Agreement expressly grant any patent rights to either party. Plaintiffs claim that because the 1998 Supply Agreement was considered part of the 1993 Patent Settlement Agreement settlement between RPR and Miles, predecessors of Plaintiffs and Defendants respectively, the 1998 Supply Agreement incorporates the express license to the Scripps patents that was included in the 1993 settlement. The failure to mention the ‘427 patent explicitly in the 1998 Agreement, Plaintiffs argue, coupled with the express license of the Scripps patents in 1993, creates a presumption that the 1998 Agreement creates no new licenses.\n\nIf the 1998 Supply Agreement itself had explicitly mentioned a license to the Scripps patents, or to some other patent, and conspicuously omitted any mention of the ‘427 patent, Plaintiffs’ argument might have some force. See, e.g., State Contracting, 258 F.3d at 1340 (“The provision for licensing of patents is limited to work under the contract and does not convey any license to future use of the patented technology. The existence of this provision shows that, if the parties had intended to convey other patent rights, they would have done so explicitly.”); Hilgraeve Corp. v. Symantec Corp., 265 F.3d 1336, 1345 (Fed.Cir.2001) (“Here, the contract provided for Hilgraeve to transfer `all copyright rights in the Software,’ but failed to mention the transfer of patent rights. From the terms of the contract we cannot conclude that the parties intended to transfer any patent rights.”). However, because the 1998 Supply Agreement is completely silent on the issue of licenses to intellectual property (aside from Section 10, which I have already found to be ambiguous), Plaintiffs’ argument fails.\n\nThere are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the 1998 Supply Agreement was intended to create a license to the ‘427 patent as a patent necessary to the performance of the parties’ contractual obligations.\n\n3. Whether a license to the ‘427 patent was necessary to Bayer’s performance of its obligations under the 1998 Supply Agreement\n\nFinally, Plaintiffs argue that even if the 1998 Agreement granted express or implied licenses to those patents necessary to the performance of the parties’ obligations, the ‘427 patent was not such a patent. The parties devote much of the briefing of the instant motions to debating whether Bayer could have fulfilled its obligations under the Agreement without infringing the ‘427 patent. This question presents genuine issues of material fact.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nBecause there are genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment to either party on the issues raised in the instant motions, I will deny both parties’ motions for summary judgment.\n\nSelected footnotes from A. Natterman & CIE GmBH v. Bayer Corp:\n\n[FN8]: An express license is merely “[o]ne which is granted in direct terms.” Black’s Law Dictionary 920 (6th ed.1990). The definition of “implied license” in this context is slightly more nuanced. In patent law, the term “implied license” has been used to refer to “different categories of conduct which lead to the same conclusion,” namely, “a patentee’s waiver of the statutory right to exclude others from making, using, or selling the patented invention.” Wang Labs., Inc. v. Mitsubishi Electronics Am., Inc., 103 F.3d 1571, 1580 (Fed.Cir.1997). “[C]ourts and commentators relate that implied licenses arise by acquiescence, by conduct, by equitable estoppel (estoppel in pais), or by legal estoppel.” Id. These distinctions as to implied licenses are not relevant for purposes of the instant motions.\n\n[FN12]: Plaintiffs “move for summary judgment of no license—either express or implied.” Because I find that the plain terms of the 1998 Supply Agreement do not, as a matter of law, necessarily foreclose an implied license to the ‘427 patent, I do not address whether they foreclose an express license to the patent.\n\nIn re Davidson Hydrant Techs., Inc.\n\nIn re Davidson Hydrant Techs., Inc., 2012 Bankr. LEXIS 1120, (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2012).\n\nORDER\n\nW. H. DRAKE, Bankruptcy Judge\n\nBefore the Court is the Motion to Reject Exclusive Marketing Agreement with Windsor Distribution Corporation, filed by Davidson Hydrant Technologies, Inc. (hereinafter the “Debtor”). Windsor Technologies Corporation, f/k/a Windsor Distribution Corporation (hereinafter “Windsor”) objects to the Motion. Windsor asserts that section 365(n)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code applies to permit Windsor to retain certain rights allegedly provided under the agreement between the parties. This matter is a core proceeding, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(A), over which this Court has subject matter jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1334.\n\nBACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nDebtor owns patents in fire hydrant technology and manufactures and sells the patented products to both end-users and manufacturers. Debtor signed marketing agreements in 2003 and 2005 with Windsor before entering into the current marketing agreement in 2007 (hereinafter the “Agreement”). By its terms, the Agreement will last through December 2018, with a five-year right of renewal granted to Windsor at the end of the stated term.\n\nThe pertinent aspects of the Agreement are as follows:\n\nDavidson hereby engages Windsor, and Windsor hereby accepts such engagement, to market and promote the Products, Davidson’s training, and installation services within the Territory, all strictly in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Subject to Section 10, Davidson engages Windsor on an exclusive basis within the Territory during the Term. Agreement, § 2A.\n\n[…]\n\n…Essentially, the parties disagree over whether Windsor is a licensee of a right to Debtor’s intellectual property, either expressly under the Agreement, or by virtue of an implied license arising from the parties’ conduct.\n\nDebtor argues that Windsor’s sole duty and right under the Agreement was to market and promote Debtor’s products and services, which did not require or result in a license of a right to use, sell, or offer to sell Debtor’s intellectual property. In support of its position, Debtor states that the Agreement provided Debtor the right to accept or reject any purchase order submitted by Windsor, and the Agreement only provided Windsor with a license to use Debtor’s trademarks, which are excluded from the Bankruptcy Code’s definition of intellectual property. The Debtor further submits that no implied license to offer the products for sale arose because Debtor lacked the requisite intent to grant Windsor a license and Windsor gave no consideration for the alleged implied license.\n\nIn response, Windsor argues that the Agreement grants Windsor a right to use intellectual property because it permits Windsor to offer for sale Debtor’s products and gives Windsor the right to use and create works of authorship owned by Debtor. In the alternative, Windsor submits that the parties mutually departed from the written terms of the Agreement, thus resulting in a modified contract, under which Windsor had the authority to directly sell products to customers, or that Debtor’s conduct gave rise to an implied license of the right to offer for sale and sell Debtor’s products.\n\n[…]\n\nThe Bankruptcy Code does not define the terms “licensor” or “license.” According to federal law applicable to patents, a “license” is essentially permission to use, make, or sell intellectual property and a “promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee.” A. Natterman & CIE Gmbh v. Bayer Corp., 428 F.Supp.2d 253, 258 (E.D. Pa. 2006); In re Spansion, Inc., 2011 3268084, * 7 (D. Del. July 26, 2011). Under the Bankruptcy Code, “intellectual property” includes a trade secret; invention, process, design, or plant protected under title 35; patent application; plant variety; work of authorship protected under title 17; or mask work protected under chapter 9 of title 17, “to the extent protected by applicable nonbankruptcy law.” 11 U.S.C. § 101(35A). Accordingly, a “licensor of a right to intellectual property” within the meaning of section 365(n)(1), is a party who has been authorized to use, make, or sell a trade secret, a patented invention, process, design, or plant, a plant variety, a copyrighted work of authorship, or a mask work. Spansion, 2011 WL 3268084 at *7.\n\nFurther, under federal patent law, a patent is considered to be a “bundle of rights.” See Carborundum Co. v. Molten Metal Equip. Innovations, 72 F.3d 872, 878 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Each “stick” in the bundle can be licensed to another party. Here, Windsor asserts that the right to offer for sale a patented product is such a “stick” in the bundle of rights. This assertion is consistent with patent law, which permits the holder of a patent to sue a party for patent infringement if the party offers to sell a product using the patent holder’s patent without authorization. See 35 U.S.C. § 271(a).\n\nWindsor contends that the Agreement permits Windsor to offer Debtor’s products for sale. If so, the authorization to offer the products for sale without being subject to suit for infringement of Debtor’s patent constitutes the license of a right in the patent. For purposes of determining whether particular conduct constitutes an “offer to sell,” the term “offer to sell” is “interpreted according to its ordinary meaning in contract law, as revealed by traditional sources of authority.” Rotec Indus., Inc. v. Mitsubishi Corp., 215 F.3d 1246 (Fed. Cir. 2000)….\n\nB. Whether the Agreement Grants a License of Intellectual Property\n\nUnder federal patent law, a license of intellectual property can be either express or implied. See Bayer Corp., 428 F.Supp. at 258. “An express license is merely ‘[o]ne which is granted in direct terms.’” *Id, n.8 (quoting BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 920 (6th ed. 1990)). Whether a contract includes a license to intellectual property is a matter of contract interpretation. Wisconsin AlumniResearch Foundation v. Intel Corp., 656 F.Supp.2d 898, 910 (W.D. Wis. 2009) (citing State Contracting & Engineering Corp. v. Florida, 258 F.3d 1329, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2001)). Here, the parties agree that Georgia contract law applies.\n\nUnder Georgia law, “the cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to determine the intent of the parties. . . .” Flynt v. Life of the South Ins. Co., 2011 WL 5305431, 4 (Ga. App. 2011) (citations omitted). To ascertain the intent of the parties, the Court must first determine “‘if the contract language is unambiguous, and if so the court enforces the contract’s clear terms.’” _NW Parkway, LLC v. Lemser_, 709 S.E.2d 858, 861 (Ga. App. 2011) (quoting _Eckerd Corp. v. Alterman Properties, Ltd._, 589 S.E.2d 660 (Ga. App. 2003)). In determining a contract’s nature, a court looks at the plain meaning of the contract provisions. *Id. (quoting Ga. Real Estate Properties, v. Lindwall, 692 S.E.2d 690 (Ga.
