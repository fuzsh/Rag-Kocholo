        "text": "Michela v St. Thomas of Villanova Catholic School may give parties a glimpse into the Court’s position\n\nWhile Canadians focus on flattening the curve of new cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases, wrongful dismissal plaintiffs and their counsel are hoping for a “bump” of sorts. The millions of Canadians now unemployed probably as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic declared by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 and subsequent recession are hopeful that judges award additional notice period damages.\n\nDuring this time, employers are terminating their workers’ employment at an alarming rate. According to Statistics Canada, the unemployment rate has risen from 7.8% in March, to 13% in April, 2020. While job loss may be inevitable, employers must ensure that they adhere to Federal or Provincial employment standards legislation as well as the common law, where applicable. Otherwise, employers will risk exposure to potential damages for breach of statute and wrongful dismissal.\n\nThe common law (or judge-made law) presumes that employees hired for an indefinite period are entitled to reasonable notice of the termination of their employment by their employer. Notice periods are given in order for the employee to continue to obtain their pay while attempting to find alternative employment. As the Court stated in Lin v Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan,2016 ONCA 619 (CanLII).\n\nAt its foundation, reasonable notice is the period of time it should reasonably take the terminated employee to find comparable employment.\n\nCommonly, employers will provide “pay in lieu of notice,” where the former employee will receive a lump sum compensation of their pay, or a salary continuation, as if they continued working normally.\n\nWhen an employee commences a dispute over a notice period, today’s judges still follow the 1960s case of Bardal v Globe & Mail Ltd., 1960 CanLII 294 (ON SC) The Bardalfactors are considered by the Court to determine the length of time of a reasonable notice period. They include:\n\nAge of the employee;\n\nLength of service;\n\nCharacter of the employment; and\n\nAvailability or job market of similar employment taking into consideration of the experience, training and qualifications of the employee.\n\nThis list is not exhaustive. A broad range of other factors, such as health issues, manner of dismissal and language comprehension, can also be considered.\n\nEach wrongfully dismissed employee’s circumstances are particular, and the appropriate notice period will be determined on a subjective basis rather than an objective one. In Paquette v TeraGo Networks Inc.,2015 ONSC 4189 (CanLII), rev’d on other grounds 2016 ONCA 618 (CanLII), the Court stated: “The determination of a reasonable notice period is a principled art and not a mathematical science.”\n\nNotice Period in Times of COVID-19\n\nDuring these extraordinary times of COVID-19, neither employees nor employers are immune from the pandemic’s impact. Dismissed employees will struggle to find alternate employment, much less comparable employment. Standard notice periods may be insufficient to bridge an employee to a new position.\n\nBoth employers and employees will most likely be in a position of financial difficulty, and it is presently unclear as to which party will bear the burden. Will employers be ordered to “bump up” employee notice periods in order to ensure that employees receive pay during a prolonged period of unemployment? Or will employees have to make do with the notice period given to them by their financially-strapped employers?\n\nEmployers may take the position that no notice period should be awarded based on the concept known as frustration of contract in common law and pursuant to the statutory exception in Termination and Severance of Employment, O Reg 288/01 s 2.\n\nThough judges and decision makers may not have case law dealing specifically with termination of employment during a global pandemic to which they can refer, jurisprudence of a similar nature is insightful. Cases in which employers were in financial distress and have had to fire staff may be analogous.\n\nOne of the leading cases which addressed this situation is Michela v St. Thomas of Villanova Catholic School, 2015 ONCA 801 (CanLII). In that decision,the Ontario Court of Appeal addressed the question of whether an employer’s financial circumstances are relevant in determining a wrongfully dismissed employee’s reasonable notice period entitlement, and stated:\n\nIt is important to emphasize, then, that an employer’s poor economic circumstances do not justify a reduction of the notice period to which an employee is otherwise entitled having regard to the Bardal factors.\n\nNotice Periods in Difficult Economic Circumstances\n\nIn many decisions, both pre-and post-Michela, the Court has asserted that a poor economy may increase a plaintiff’s reasonable notice period entitlement.
