COMMERCIAL BANKS IN 1993 In 1993, U.S. commercial banks had their best year since World War II. The return on assets reached 1.21 percent, nearly one-third higher than in 1992. The return on equity also reached a postwar high, exceeding 15 percent for the first time. Profits increased primarily because of a decline in provisions for loan losses. They continued to be boosted by relatively wide net interest margins, strong gains from trading activities, and high income from fees. Last year's profit performance allowed banks to increase dividends sharply and still to boost capital by retaining a very high share of income. Substantial issuance of equity and subordinated debt, when added to the high level of retained earnings, led to further increases in capital ratios. With profits high and capital ratios comfortable, banks appeared to be more willing to expand their balance sheets. The growth in bank assets picked up with securities holdings continuing the rapid expansion of recent years and bank loans rising strongly after two years of decline. Bank loan growth picked up further in early 1994, reflecting an acceleration of business and consumer loans. 511 STATEMENTS 1994 Industrial production rose 0.3 percent in April after gains of 0.5 percent in each of the three preceding months. At 116.0 percent of its 1987 average, industrial production was 5.0 percent higher in April than it was a year earlier. The utilization of total industrial capacity held steady, at 83.6 percent. CONGRESS John P. LaWare, member, Board of Governors, presents the views of the Board on several topics related to hedge funds and says that the Federal Reserve will continue to work with other U.S. agencies and with foreign central banks to monitor important developments in financial markets and to ensure that it is in a position to react promptly to any problems that might arise, before the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, April 13, 1994. 517 Governor LaWare discusses the Board's views on H.R.3447, \"The Securities Regulatory Equality Act,\" and says that the Board has several concerns about the approach of H.R.3447, which would prohibit banks from directly conducting most securities activities, because it believes that the prohibitions of H.R.3447 would stifle competition in the marketplace for securities services and significantly increase costs to small banks without improving supervision of their securities activities, before the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, April 14, 1994. 522 508 INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND CAPACITY UTILIZATION FOR APRIL TO THE ANNOUNCEMENTS Joint statement of the North American Financial Group.

Helfrey provided research assistance. In 1993, U.S. commercial banks had their best year since World War II. The return on assets reached 1.21 percent, nearly one-third higher than in 1992. The return on equity also reached a postwar high, exceeding 15 percent for the first time (chart 1). Profits increased primarily because of a decline in provisions for loan losses. They continued to be boosted by relatively wide net interest margins, strong gains from trading activities, and high income from fees. Last year's profit performance allowed banks to increase dividends sharply and still to boost capital by retaining a very high share of income (table 1). Substantial issuance of equity and subordinated debt, when added to the high level of retained earnings, led to further increases in capital ratios. With profits high and capital ratios comfortable, banks appeared to be more willing to expand their balance sheets. The growth in bank assets picked up with securities holdings continu- 1.

Bank loan growth picked up further in early 1994, reflecting an acceleration of business and consumer loans.1 Banks benefited from the good performance of the U.S. economy in 1993. Real gross domestic product increased about 3 percent, while inflation remained relatively low. Short-term interest rates were little changed over the year, as the Federal Reserve made no adjustments to the stance of monetary policy. Long-term rates, however, fell substantially during the first three quarters, with the thirty-year Treasury bond yield shedding about IV2 percentage points between January and October. Long-term rates turned upward late in the year but still finished 1993 down a full percentage point from the beginning of the year. This environment helped bank profits in two ways. First, the continued economic expansion and the low interest rates contributed to an improvement in the quality of bank assets: Firms reduced their debt burdens, and commercial real estate 1. Except where otherwise indicated, data in this article are from the quarterly Report of Condition and Income (Call Report) for insured domestic commercial banks and nondeposit trust companies. The data, which cover all such institutions that filed at least one Call Report, consolidate information from foreign and domestic offices and have been adjusted to take account of mergers. Size categories of such institutions (hereafter called banks), which refer to assets at the start of each quarter, are as follows: small banks, those not among the largest 1,000 banks; medium-sized banks, those between numbers 101 and 1,000 by size; large banks, those between numbers 11 and 100 by size; and the ten largest banks. At the start of the fourth quarter of 1993, the ten largest banks had assets of more than $36 billion, large banks had assets between $6 billion and $36 billion, medium-sized banks had assets between approximately $300 million and $6 billion, and small banks had assets of less than approximately $300 million. Data for 1985-92 have been revised to reflect uniform definitions across time and to incorporate updated Call Report information. Because of report changes, data for the years preceding 1985 are not strictly comparable to the more recent data. In the tables, components may not sum to totals because of rounding. 484 1.

The health of the banking sector may have contributed to the improvement in the economy, as banks eased their lending terms and standards thereby increasing the availability of bank credit. The decline in long-term interest rates had negative implications for bank profits, however. Because bank assets generally have longer maturities than bank liabilities, the flattening of the yield curve should cut bank interest margins as assets mature or reprice. The decline in long-term rates also encouraged households to refinance home mortgages, cutting interest income from mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and, for banks with mortgage-servicing portfolios, eroding the value of purchased servicing rights as serviced mortgages were prepaid. Finally, the low level of long-term interest rates encouraged firms with access to the capital markets to substitute long-term financing for bank loans, thereby reducing bank revenues. These negative effects were offset, to some degree, by the capital gains that banks earned on their securities and by the fee income that they earned from refinancing activities. The improved condition of the banking sector is clearly reflected in measures of bank distress. The number of banks classified by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as \"problem banks\" fell more than 45 percent, to 426. Total assets at these banks declined about 40 percent, to $242 billion. Only 42 banks failed last year, the lowest annual total since 1982 and far fewer than the 100 banks that failed in 1992. The consolidation of the banking industry continued, with a pickup in bank mergers and a further decline in new charters. According to FDIC figures, 482 mergers occurred in 1993, compared with 428 in 1992. Only 59 new charters were issued, the fewest in one year since the early 1950s. All told, the number of banks declined more than 4 percent last year. Despite this reduction, full-timeequivalent employees increased about 1 percent, reversing a three-year slide. BALANCE SHEET DEVELOPMENTS In 1993, the balance sheets of commercial banks expanded at the briskest pace since 1986 (table 2). On the asset side, bank loans increased for the first time in two years, while securities holdings continued to expand rapidly. On the liability side, deposit growth picked up slightly, but bank issuance of subordinated debt fell back from the high rate of 1992. Other liabilities expanded rapidly. Equity capital increased at nearly the same pace as in 1992. Assets Total bank assets grew nearly 53/4 percent in 1993, more than twice the increase in 1992. After two years of runoffs, bank loans increased 6 percent, as credit demand picked up and banks eased lending terms and standards. Securities growth remained at about the same high pace as that in 1992. Loans Commercial and industrial loans edged up for the first time since 1989. Real estate loan growth picked up to its fastest pace since 1990. Primarily, however, the strong rebound in bank loans reflected a substantial acceleration in consumer loans. Commercial and industrial loans. Commercial and industrial loans, which had declined 4 percent in 1992 and 9 percent in 1991, grew V2 percent in 1993. The turnaround resulted from slower runoffs at the ten largest banks and moderate growth at banks in the other three size categories. In contrast, all four size groups had registered declines in 1992. Profits and Balance Sheet Developments at U.S. Commercial Banks in 1993 On the supply side, loan growth was bolstered by an easing of loan standards and terms. Responses to the Federal Reserve's periodic Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (LPS) indicated that banks began to ease terms and standards on commercial and industrial loans in the second quarter of 1993, reversing at least a part of the tightening registered in 1990 and early 1991 (chart 2). Respondent banks—about sixty banks, most of them quite large, located in all twelve Federal Reserve Districts—reported easing for borrowers of all sizes, although terms were relaxed 2. 485 less for smaller borrowers. Respondents attributed the more accommodative terms and standards to a more favorable economic outlook, to fewer problems in specific industries to which they lend, and to improvements in their expected capital positions owing to better asset quality. The LPS responses show that the terms eased most were loan and line fees and spreads of loan rates over base rates. Data on loan spreads from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Terms of Bank Lending to Business suggest, however, that the overall narrowing of spreads last year was fairly small and Annual rates of growth of balance sheet items, 1 9 8 5 - 9 3 Percent Item 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 8.92 9.62 7.93 2.16 13.78 13.53 7.74 7.90 7.45 3.98 17.56 17.17 2.00 3.08 3.01 -1.94 16.58 17.13 4.38 4.08 5.97 1.88 12.49 12.06 5.42 5.67 6.31 3.01 12.82 13.15 17.20 11.58 9.50 16.47 18.07 22.49 15.81 28.19 12.12 4.54 19.64 11.92 12.10 26.15 23.60 30.20 8.66 17.01 5.79 -.91 12.37 13.82 18.52 11.52 19.48 .84 4.55 12.05 1.71 -5.33 7.16 7.27 14.65 3.37 12.82 27.03 7.66 13.92 5.04 -3.07 1990 1991 1992 2.65 2.25 2.40 -.69 8.80 8.56 1.36 2.01 -2.62 -9.08 2.78 2.95 2.24 2.58 -.98 -4.06 2.01 2.64 5.69 6.57 6.07 .59 6.14 6.18 5.79 7.62 16.25 9.50 14.02 3.00 6.23 12.17 3.55 -.91 -7.42 3.66 14.07 4.53 10.45 16.65 .52 1.93 -.16 -5.69 -18.63 6.88 7.81 14.39 4.92 -2.34 -2.49 4.41 -5.93 -4.92 -23.38 7.97 7.58 14.25 3.27 -17.80 -1.49 -1.95 -1.24 -4.26 -15.57 4.77 11.08 8.97 3.79 4.66 8.93 13.27 6.54 10.08 1993 Total assets Interest-earning assets Loans and leases (net) Commercial and industrial Real estate Booked in domestic offices Construction and land development Farmland One- to four-family Multifamily residential Nonfarm nonresidential Booked in foreign offices Consumer Credit card Installment and other Other loans Loan loss reserves and unearned income Securities Investment account U.S. Treasury U.S. government agency and corporation State and local government Other Trading account Other interest-earning assets Non-interest-earning assets 9.13 15.96 14.06 5.41 9.61 9.97 10.32 1.68 44.41 4.94 7.51 -.00 -4.16 3.32 2.99 -5.78 10.31 5.10 4.07 -13.76 .38 8.45 8.19 3.51 -3.75 16.25 14.44 32.07 -4.66 12.30 11.46 23.97 -6.10 12.28 8.11 7.26 -3.98 33.02 32.80 41.40 9.22 4.62 53.59 -12.64 74.73 6.21 6.96 6.67 25.47 -13.94 48.75 -23.88 .22 -5.08 22.58 -12.06 11.19 8.58 -5.78 6.51 33.54 -11.37 11.89 20.62 2.54 3.62 24.02 -11.50 -2.07 11.87 -11.68 5.49 15.90 -12.22 5.90 38.89 2.82 -3.10 12.79 -1.99 -7.50 21.02 1.60 -.27 9.61 8.53 4.19 51.95 -8.02 -.87 Total liabilities Deposits Booked in foreign offices Booked in domestic offices Demand Other checkable Savings' Large time Small time Subordinated notes and debentures Other liabilities 8.86 7.94 1.34 9.22 8.96 17.79 16.83 4.29 3.67 43.86 12.67 7.74 7.81 -2.49 9.66 13.17 32.76 17.54 -1.41 15.85 7.12 2.18 2.31 8.86 1.26 -10.77 7.81 -.74 12.15 7.53 3.72 1.46 4.09 4.11 -7.77 6.16 .64 7.61 1.10 9.28 14.41 -4.26 4.32 5.49 4.80 -1.08 5.68 .34 2.41 .44 5.04 17.20 20.43 8.40 2.40 3.87 -5.88 5.24 .67 6.36 6.48 -5.67 14.04 19.94 -5.37 1.04 1.59 3.82 1.31 -2.02 14.82 14.38 -19.52 -.34 4.03 -2.01 1.40 .39 -5.85 1.19 12.48 18.54 13.18 -26.34 -11.64 34.89 5.25 5.11 2.07 15.06 .52 5.70 5.09 3.57 -9.17 -6.07 10.82 20.61 9.79 7.71 -.67 8.81 4.34 6.62 5.95 13.78 12.71 -3.53 -6.11 -5.10 -6.09 -1.30 12.30 Equity capital MEMO -1.00 2 Commercial real estate loans Managed liabilities n.a. 9.17 n.a. 3.08 NOTE.

Net percentage of selected large commercial banks that tightened credit standards, 1990:Q2-94:Q2 more rapidly than spreads on smaller loans last year. On the demand side, a substantial pickup in investment spending by businesses likely spurred credit growth. The LPS responses indicate a pickup in demand for business loans last year, especially by small and medium-sized firms. Some LPS respondents noted that competition from the capital markets trimmed the demand for business loans by large firms. Issuance of corporate bonds was boosted by declines in long-term rates during much of the year. Gross issuance of bonds by nonfinancial firms reached an all-time high early in 1993 and remained strong by historical standards until long-term rates rose in the fall (chart 4). In many cases the funds raised were used, at least in part, to retire bank debt. Similarly, the strength of the stock market encouraged firms to issue equity, and they likely used a part of the proceeds to pay down bank debt. These factors helped to account for the continued weakness in commercial and industrial loans at the larger banks last year. that spreads on loans to small and medium-sized borrowers remained wide at year-end relative to historical norms (chart 3). As suggested by the LPS responses, measured spreads on large loans fell Real estate loans. Real estate loans grew 6 percent in 1993, more than three times the rate in 1992. Most of the growth came in the residential sector, as it has for several years, with loans for one- to four-family mortgages rising 11 percent. Both demand and supply factors boosted home mortgage lending last year. The continued strength in the economy, coupled with the lowest level of mortgage rates in more than twenty years, led to a pickup in the demand for housing. At the same time, some of the LPS respondent banks indicated 3. Loan rate spread over average federal funds rate, by size of loan, 1987-94:Q1 4.

Profits and Balance Sheet Developments at U.S. Commercial Banks in 1993 that they eased standards for making mortgage loans to individuals for home purchases in the second half of the year. Home mortgage loans on banks' books probably also received a temporary boost from the high level of refinancing activity last year. As mortgages were refinanced, banks held the new mortgages until they were sold to federal agencies or securitized directly by the banks. Moreover, some households likely took the opportunity provided by refinancing to extract some equity from their housing investment to pay down higher-cost consumer debt and to use for other purposes. Banks also increased their indirect financing of residential mortgages by purchasing a substantial volume of mortgage-backed securities. Although these securities offer a lower yield than direct mortgage lending, they are attractive because of their greater liquidity, better diversification, lower capital charge, and—for Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) securities—government backing. Last year, mortgage-backed securities held by banks accounted for 373/4 percent of total commercial bank financing of residential mortgages (loans plus mortgage-backed securities), up from 31V2 percent in early 1990. Commercial real estate loans declined about 1V4 percent in 1993, considerably less than in 1992. Responses to the LPS suggest that, although banks stopped tightening standards for such loans, lending standards remained tight relative to those in place a few years ago (chart 2). In part, this continued stringency reflects a needed correction to relatively low standards in the late 1980s. Also, overbuilding left many commercial real estate markets burdened with high vacancy rates and soft prices. Nonetheless, commercial real estate markets appear to be recovering. Vacancy rates for industrial real estate, although high, have declined for two years, and vacancy rates for office properties began to fall sharply in 1992 and at the end of 1993 were well below their 1989 level (chart 5). According to the FDIC, almost 40 percent of the examiners and liquidators surveyed in January 1994 thought that the commercial real estate market in their area was improving, and only 5 percent thought it was worsening. Slightly more of them reported increasing prices than reported decreasing prices. The better condition of the market allowed several banks to sell large blocks of troubled real 487 5. Vacancy rates for commercial real estate, 1 9 8 9 - 9 3 SOURCE. CB Commercial Real Estate Group, Inc. estate loans to investor groups and thus to reduce the volume of such loans on their books. In addition, many banks reduced their holdings of other real estate owned, which declined more than onethird, to just less than $17 billion last year. Consumer loans. Consumer loans supplied much of the impetus to total loan growth last year. After two years of runoffs, consumer loans grew nearly 9 percent. The increase reflected double-digit growth in credit card lending, as well as a substantial pickup in the growth of other consumer loans, and occurred despite an increase in auto leasing and the possible paydowns of consumer debt with the proceeds of mortgage refinancings that were noted above. Three factors contributed to the rapid growth in consumer loans in 1993. First, strong consumer spending boosted the demand for credit. Total consumption expenditures increased 5Vi percent in nominal terms, and the consumer durables component rose about 9 percent. The effects of this spending on consumer borrowing were reflected in the responses on the LPS, which showed a pickup in 488 Federal Reserve Bulletin • June 1994 demand for consumer loans over the course of the year. Second, banks were more aggressive lenders, with an average of about 20 percent of the LPS respondents reporting increased willingness to make consumer loans last year. The survey responses were consistent with the data on consumer lending rates: The average rate charged by banks on forty-eight-month auto loans fell about 1 percentage point, over a quarter point more than the decline in auto loan rates at finance companies and more than the declines in deposit and market rates. Similarly, the average rate charged on banks' most common credit card plans fell more than a percentage point. Third, convenience use of credit cards likely increased. Both the card-issuing banks and the major credit card interchange systems contributed to the increase—the former by offering new promotions for card use and the latter by expanding the acceptance of credit cards at nontraditional outlets, such as grocery stores. The higher balances resulting from increased convenience use are more likely than other balances to be paid off within the typical interest-free grace period; nonetheless, they boost both the average level of consumer debt outstanding on any given day and bank revenue because the merchant pays the bank a fee when the latter's credit card is used. Securities Bank holdings of securities expanded 12^4 percent last year, almost exactly the same rate as in 1992. Investment account securities rose 8 percent, down from IIV2 percent in 1992. This slower growth in investment account securities was offset, however, by a sharp jump in trading account assets, which grew more than 50 percent last year. Bank holdings of investment securities were likely affected last year by the accounting changes required under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 115 (FASB 115). FASB 115 applies to financial statements in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993, but some banks implemented it as of year-end 1993. Other banks may have adjusted securities holdings in anticipation of its implementation. These changes require banks to mark to market investment account securities that they do not intend to hold to maturity, just as they do securities held in trading accounts. Cap- ital gains and losses on such investment account securities do not affect reported income, as is the case for trading accounts, but they are reflected in a bank's equity account under the new generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, reported bank capital is likely to be more volatile. Surveys suggested that banks would respond to FASB 115 by shortening the maturities of their securities holdings, thereby reducing the additional volatility imparted to reported capital. In early 1993, about a quarter of the LPS respondents indicated that the desired average maturity of their securities portfolio had declined, largely because of existing or anticipated rules on the valuation of securities portfolios. Similarly, a survey conducted in late 1992 by Ernst and Young indicated that FASB 115 would lead banks to shorten the maturity of their securities holdings. Thus far, however, the evidence suggests that the decline in the average maturity of bank investment account securities has been fairly small. The distribution of securities by maturity reported in the December 1993 Call Report shows a small shift toward shorter maturities (table 3). These data, however, likely overstate the actual expected maturities of bank securities holdings because banks must report the maturity of mortgage-backed securities based on the stated final maturity of the underlying mortgages rather than on their expected maturities, which reflect anticipated prepayments. 3.

Profits and Balance Sheet Developments at U.S. Commercial Banks in 1993 This problem is most severe in the case of collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Most of the CMOs in banks' investment accounts have reported maturities of more than five years, but LPS data indicate that these securities have an average expected maturity of well under five years. As a result of this reporting problem, the Call Report data may not adequately capture changes in the expected maturity of bank securities. The American Bankers Association Portfolio Managers Survey avoids this difficulty by asking banks for the \"average weighted life\" of their securities portfolios after taking into account expected prepayments on mortgage-backed securities. The most recent survey indicates that the average weighted life of the respondents' investment account securities was 3.3 years at the end of 1993, down only slightly from 3.4 years at the end of 1992. It is possible, however, that banks delayed adjusting their portfolios until after the implementation of FASB 115. In the May 1994 LPS, half of the surveyed banks said they had shortened the average maturity of their securities portfolio because of the new accounting rules. In addition, a significant number of banks reported increased hedging activity. Even taking into account the difference between reported and expected maturities, bank holdings of securities appear to have longer maturities than bank loans. Thus, the maturity of bank assets may have increased slightly in recent years because of the shift of bank assets from loans to securities. On the liability side, the maturities of bank time deposits have increased since 1990. The share of time deposits in total deposits has declined rapidly, however, and so the average maturity of all deposits may have decreased. The average maturity of liabilities has been boosted, however, by increased issuance of subordinated and senior debt with relatively long maturities. In addition, banks have increased their reliance on equity finance. Investment account securities. Growth of securities held in investment accounts slowed in 1993, and growth rates were more uniform across various types of securities. In previous years, Treasury and agency securities had paced the growth of securities. Last year, however, the growth of U.S. Treasury securities fell sharply, to 7 VA percent from more than 20 percent in 1992 and more than 30 per- 489 cent in 1991. The growth of U.S. government agency securities, which peaked at more than 30 percent in 1989, fell further, to about 9Vi percent in 1993. Within this category, the level of agency CMOs actually declined in the fourth quarter. In contrast, municipal securities, which had run off since a tax law change in 1986 reduced their attractiveness to banks, expanded 8V2 percent last year. According to a recent LPS, at the end of 1993 nearly half of the dollar volume of the respondents' municipal securities holdings had been purchased before the tax change. Such securities were grandfathered under the favorable pre-1987 rules. About three-quarters of their remaining tax-exempt securities were \"bank-qualified\" instruments. These securities, which also retain the pre-1987 tax treatment, are obligations of local government entities and charitable organizations whose total annual issuance is less than $10 million. The gross issuance of long-term bank-qualified securities has been very strong in recent years, and these securities account for much of the recent increase in holdings of tax-exempt instruments. In addition, yields on tax-exempt securities rose last fall relative to those on comparable taxable securities. Several LPS respondents indicated that this increase had led them to purchase tax-exempt instruments. Finally, a few banks noted that improved profitability or exhaustion of net operating loss carryforwards made tax-exempt securities more attractive. Trading account assets. Assets held in trading accounts expanded rapidly in 1993, primarily because of a large increase in the trading accounts of the top ten banks. These banks' trading accounts, which include more than 80 percent of the trading account assets at all banks, expanded more than 45 percent last year. Trading accounts at other banks grew even more rapidly, almost doubling in 1993. These large increases suggest that the high level of trading profits last year may have encouraged banks to increase their trading activities. Liabilities Total bank liabilities rose 5 percent last year, the largest increase since 1989. The growth in total liabilities resulted from continued expansion of 490 Federal Reserve Bulletin • June 1994 transaction deposits, albeit at a slower pace than in 1992, a less rapid runoff in time deposits, and strong growth in other liability categories. Transaction Deposits Transaction deposits expanded in 1993, although more slowly than in 1992. Domestic demand deposits rose 5 3 A percent, and other checkable deposits grew more than 5 percent. Demand deposits had increased rapidly in 1992 as a result of the decline in short-term rates, but their growth slowed last year as short-term rates stabilized. The slower growth in other checkable deposits reflected the decline in rates on these accounts relative to money market rates. For example, the average yield on NOW accounts fell last year, responding with a lag to the reduction in market rates in previous years (chart 6). Transaction deposit growth would have slowed further but for the surge in mortgage refinancings generated by last year's decline in long-term rates. 6. Selected interest rates, 1 9 8 7 - 9 4 : Q 1 Refinancings temporarily increase the level of transaction deposits because mortgage servicers must hold prepayments of mortgages securitized by GNMA or the Federal National Mortgage Association in transaction accounts for up to six weeks before distributing the money to the holders of the security. Nontransaction Deposits Nontransaction deposits declined on the whole last year, with a small increase in savings deposits more than offset by the continued decline in time deposits. Savings deposits (including money market deposit accounts) increased 3V2 percent, well below the 13 percent rise posted a year earlier. The slower growth reflected the decline in rates on savings accounts relative to market rates as deposit rates continued to adjust to previous declines in market rates. Both large and small time deposits fell last year, although less rapidly than in 1992. Rates on small time deposits declined last year, but not as much as rates on NOW and savings deposits. The low rates on bank deposits, the steep yield curve, and the strong performance of stocks and bonds in recent years have encouraged savers to shift from deposits to stock and bond mutual funds (chart 7). Net monthly sales of shares of long-term bond funds averaged $11.6 billion, an increase of more than 20 percent since 1992. Sales of equity fund shares, boosted in large part by the quadrupling of inflows to international equity funds, accelerated more than 60 percent. With this large increase, sales of shares of equity funds reached 7. N e t sales of long-term mutual fund shares, 1 9 8 5 - 9 4 : Q 1 deposit accounts. SOURCE. Federal Reserve Monthly Survey of Selected Deposits. Profits and Balance Sheet Developments at U.S. Commercial Banks in 1993 about the same level as those of long-term bond funds, averaging $11.7 billion per month last year. In contrast to the declines in domestic nontransactions deposits, deposits booked in foreign offices grew 15 percent, accounting for the bulk of the growth in deposits. The increase in funding abroad may be the result of lower U.S. dollar funding costs in Europe and Japan, owing to the weakness of their economies and the resulting low level of demand for funds. Indeed the spreads between Eurodollar interest rates and U.S. interest rates were relatively narrow last year by historical standards. Other Liabilities Banks also increased borrowing from other sources in 1993. Subordinated notes and debentures expanded more than 10 percent, but this increase was well below that posted in 1992. Other liabilities increased more than 20 percent, with much of the increase coming in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase and in other borrowed money. Federal funds and repurchase borrowing rose 8V2 percent, while other borrowed money grew more than 40 percent. The category \"other borrowed money\" includes, among other items, senior debt. Press reports indicated that senior debt issuance was heavy in 1993, as improved capital ratios allowed some banks to issue relatively low-cost senior debt rather than more expensive capital-augmenting subordinated debt. This anecdotal evidence is consistent with the slowing of subordinated debt issuance. Off-Balance-Sheet Items Banks continued to expand their off-balance-sheet activities last year. Unused loan commitments increased more than 14 percent, doubling the gain posted in 1992 and suggesting a further advance in credit availability. At year-end, unused commitments totaled nearly $1.5 trillion—more than twothirds of total loans. As they have been in recent years, unused commitments were divided fairly equally between credit card lines and commercial and industrial credit lines. Other types of commitments, including home equity lines of credit, amounted to less than 10 percent of the total. 491 The volume of commercial and standby letters of credit outstanding leveled out after declining for two years. Performance standby letters of credit declined more than 10 percent, while commercial and similar letters of credit changed little. Financial standby letters of credit, which make up more than 60 percent of total bank letters of credit, rebounded, rising 5V£ percent after having fallen 12 percent over the previous two years. The increase in financial standby letters of credit is likely the result, in part, of the banking industry's strong recovery over the past two years. Since letters of credit increase risk-weighted assets, the improved capital position of U.S. banks may have increased banks' willingness to provide them. Bank activities in derivatives markets also expanded last year. The credit-equivalent value of all interest rate and exchange rate contracts rose about 2 percent, to more than $200 billion. The credit equivalent value is an estimate of the credit exposure on an off-balance-sheet derivatives contract that is intended to be comparable to the on-balance-sheet credit exposure created by a loan. The estimate is the sum of the current exposure (the replacement cost) and an estimate of the potential future increase in credit exposure (a small fraction of the notional principal value of the contract). The total credit equivalent value of bank interest rate contracts (including the value of interest rate swaps, futures contracts, forward contracts, and option contracts) increased 44 percent, reaching 2lA percent of bank assets at year-end. In contrast, the credit equivalent value of all foreign exchange contracts (including the value of exchange rate swaps, commitments to buy foreign exchange, and option contracts) declined I6V2 percent, to less than 3lA percent of bank assets. As in the past, the vast majority of these derivatives contracts were held by the ten largest banks. TRENDS IN PROFITABILITY Net income at commercial banks rose 37 percent in 1993 and lifted the return on assets 29 basis points, to 1.21 percent. The return on equity rose 2% percentage points, to \\5Vi percent. Nearly all of the increase in net income from 1992 to 1993 was attributable to lower loan loss provisions, which fell to 0.47 percent of assets (table 4). The net 492 4.

Percentage of average net consolidated assets. noninterest margin narrowed considerably to a minus 1.81 percent, also boosting net income; and, despite a flattening of the yield curve, the average net interest margin was about unchanged, at 3.90 percent of assets. Banks in all size categories improved their profitability, but the ten largest banks showed the largest gain. These banks cut their rate of loan loss provisioning almost in half, to an average 64 basis points. This decline, along with a narrower net noninterest margin, nearly doubled these banks' average return on assets to 1.13 percent, just below the industry average. Lower loan loss provisions and narrower noninterest margins also accounted for most of the increase in net incomes of banks in other size categories. Bank income varied widely by Federal Reserve District (table 5). Although some of the largest improvements in earnings in 1993 were among Districts that had experienced returns on assets below the industry average in 1992, increases were more uniform than in 1992. Consequently, banks in the Boston, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts remained the least profitable on average.

Return on assets is net income as a percentage of average net consolidated assets. where banks earned an average return on assets of 1.99 percent. The high profits in this District and in the Minneapolis District partly result from the regional concentration of credit card banks, which have much higher average rates of return on assets than other banks have. The strong 1993 profits for banks showed through to the results for bank holding companies, whose return on assets averaged 1.14 percent. 2 The return on equity for bank holding companies jumped to 14 percent. Their assets grew 8VA percent. The pace and composition of asset growth were similar to those for banks—securities at holding companies rose 11 percent, and loans and leases grew 6V2 percent. Loss Provisions and Asset Quality High loan loss reserves and improved asset quality allowed banks to reduce provisioning in 1993 (table 6). Delinquent loans (those that are more than thirty days past due or that are on nonaccrual status) fell sharply and ended 1993 at about 3.5 percent of total loans, down from more than 6 percent in early 1991. Small banks had the lowest delinquency rate, but differences among the categories narrowed. Net charge-offs as a share of loans fell to 0.85 percent, down from 1.30 percent in 1992.

Delinquency and charge-off rates for real estate loans tumbled, in part reflecting improvements in commercial real estate markets and bank sales of troubled real estate loans. Measures of consumer loan quality returned to levels attained before the recession, as the economic expansion strengthened the financial position of households.

Net interest rate margins, which began to widen in 1990, peaked at 4.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 1992, before falling back slightly throughout 1993. Even though the yield curve flattened somewhat last year, as intermediate- and long-term rates fell and shortterm rates held steady, banks buffered the decline in interest margins partly by reducing deposit interest rates. The decline in interest rates on NOW accounts and savings deposits reestablished more typical relationships between these rates and money market rates. And although rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) declined less than those on liquid deposits last year, CD rates had declined substantially in previous years, allowing banks to pay lower rates than they had been paying on maturing longer-term CDs. Banks also bolstered interest income by maintaining wider-than-average spreads between business loan rates and market interest rates, at the expense of faster loan growth. As a consequence, the average return on loans declined less than that on securities, supporting the gross return on assets. The pattern of net interest margins across banksize categories changed little in 1993 (chart 10). The ten largest banks continued to have the narrowest margins. These banks finance a smaller share of their assets with transaction accounts and retail deposits, which carry lower interest rates than other types of liabilities. As a result, interest expense at these banks is much higher than that at other banks. Gross interest income as a percentage of average assets was again the highest for the ten largest banks and the small banks. Differences in interest income among the size categories are driven primarily by the returns on loan portfolios. The ten largest banks and the small banks, on average, earn 50 to 100 basis points more on their loans than do banks in the other size categories. In contrast, while the ten largest banks have the highest return on securities, the differences among the other size categories are small. 10.

Noninterest income also rose for banks in other size categories. An increase in service charges on deposits and in securities trading gains lifted noninterest income at large banks. The increase in noninterest income at small and medium-sized banks was concentrated in \"other noninterest income.\" Noninterest margins advanced less at small banks, which posted a larger increase in wages and salaries. Expense For the banking system as a whole, the negative spread between noninterest income and expense narrowed in 1993 for the second straight year, as noninterest income rose 18 basis points and noninterest expenses edged up 8 basis points. Securities trading gains rose sharply last year and accounted for half of the increase in noninterest income. Another source of growth in 1993 was in the broad category of \"other noninterest income,\" which includes mortgage servicing and refinancing fees. Further declines in mortgage interest rates and the resultant waves of refinancings likely helped to boost this income category. The increase in noninterest expense partially reflected salaries, which rose 3 basis points as a share of assets. Other noninterest expenses, a category that includes deposit insurance premiums, advanced 6 basis points. Insurance premiums have tripled since 1989 and have added about 10 basis points to noninterest expense over this period. Changes in Capital Bank capital surged in 1993, as higher profits enabled banks to increase retained earnings even as they hiked dividends 50 percent. The higher level of retained earnings, along with additional sales of equity and capital transfers from parent holding companies, lifted equity capital as a share of assets from IV2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1992 to 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993. The proportion of industry assets at the end of 1993 at wellcapitalized banks—adjusted for bank examiners' ratings—rose to almost 82 percent, up from 30 percent at the end of 1990.

Equity capital increased about 20 percent at large banks, but only 4 percent at small banks, which have the highest capital ratios (table 7). Retained earnings accounted for about 70 percent of the increase in capital at the ten largest banks, but only 40 percent of the increase at other large banks, as the latter depended more on sales of equity and capital infusions from their parent bank holding companies. The increase in equity capital boosted risk-based capital ratios, with the ten largest banks experiencing the largest increase (chart 12).3 The rapid growth in bank stock prices slowed in 1993, especially in the case of regional banks (chart 13). Stock prices of money center banks rose 20 percent—more than twice as fast as the S&P 500 stock index—but regional bank stock prices edged up only 3 percent. A sell-off following the announcement of first-quarter results erased gains made early in the year. While money center stocks rebounded over the summer, regional bank stocks performed less well. Bank stock prices were battered again in the fall, following the announcement of third-quarter results, but recovered somewhat late in the year. 3. The agencies' risk-based capital guidelines are based upon the Basle Accord and were modified by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. Tier 1 capital includes mainly common equity and certain perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital consists primarily of subordinated debt, non-tier 1 preferred stock, and loan loss reserves. Risk-weighted assets are calculated by multiplying the amount of assets and the credit equivalent amount of off-balance-sheet items in each risk-weight category by a factor accounting for the credit risk of that category. For a summary of the evolution of risk-based capital standards, see Allan D. Brunner and William B.

Banks raised the prime rate about in line with the increase in money market rates, maintaining the wide spread that has prevailed during the past three years. Broad stock prices were mixed, with regional bank stocks outperforming money center stocks. Many analysts have indicated that market participants expected the enactment of interstate branching legislation and a consequent acceleration of mergers among regional institutions, which would increase the value of potential target banks. 13.

Profits and Balance Sheet Developments at U.S. Commercial Banks in 1993 sumer installment loans and continued easing of terms and standards on commercial and industrial loans. Deposit growth remained weak, in part because banks only sluggishly adjusted deposit interest rates to rising market rates. Investors responded to the decline of securities prices by reducing acquisitions of long-term mutual fund shares and by stepping up purchases of money market mutual fund shares. Bank profitability appears to have remained strong in the first quarter of 1994, although a bit below the record level attained in 1993. Net interest margins likely declined somewhat, but loan loss provisions remained low. In contrast to 1993, trading gains fell at several large banks, moderating the effect of one of last year's sources of income. In the first quarter, asset growth accelerated at the domestic offices of U.S. commercial banks. Banks, apparently seeing the higher yields as attractive, purchased a large volume of government securities toward the end of the quarter. Other securities expanded briskly as well; but this expansion resulted almost entirely from the federal banking agencies' adoption of an accounting rule that requires banks to report, except under special circumstances, the fair-market value of off-balancesheet items. (Before the rule change, banks had been permitted to report only the net amount of unrealized gains and losses from off-balance-sheet items.) Consumer and commercial and industrial loans also expanded more rapidly in the new year.
