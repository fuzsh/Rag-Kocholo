        "text": "Jeff Klein passed away September 5, 2021 from cancer. He was born to Sally and Jim Klein on December 27, 1958 and was preceded in death by his brother Kurt in 1974 and his wife Amy Comunale Klein in 2007.\n\nHe leaves his parents and daughters, Emma and Julia Klein, as well as many surviving members of the Klein, Comunale, Miller, Orzechowski, and Straub families.\n\nJeff was a graduate of St. Sebastian grade school and Walsh Jesuit High School, and holds both bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Virginia. He was a scholarship student that earned all state high school honors and participated in four years of UVA basketball including the NIT in 1980 and the Final Four in 1981. Jeff's business career includes leadership positions, entrepreneurship, and international management consulting. The family is incredibly grateful for the loving care provided by the Cleveland Clinic, specifically by Dr. Molly Scantling and the staff of the Justin T. Rogers Hospice Center.\n\nA Mass of Christian Burial will take place on Thursday, September 9, 2021 at 11 am at St. Sebastian Church. A private family interment will take place at Holy Cross Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Stephen A. Comunale, Jr. Family Cancer Foundation."
