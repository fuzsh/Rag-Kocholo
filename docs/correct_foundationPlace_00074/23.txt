Beyond Multimedia Authoring: On the Need for Mulsemedia Authoring Tools

The mulsemedia (Multiple Sensorial Media (MulSeMedia)) concept has been explored to provide users with new sensations using other senses beyond sight and hearing. The demand for producing such applications has motivated various studies in the mulsemedia ...

Correcting Flicker in Color Motion Pictures

DICTA '05: Proceedings of the Digital Image Computing on Techniques and Applications

Despite active research work in the field of flicker correction, all the published work to date only deals with black and white motion pictures. In this paper, we will take flicker correction into the color space and propose a method to solve the ...

Structured multimedia authoring

Authoring context sensitive, interactive multimedia presentations is much more complex than authoring either purely audiovisual applications or text. Interactions among media objects need to be described as a set of spatio-temporal relationships that ...
