In a deal that adds over $6 million to its coffers, Jetform (Ottawa, Ontario) has amended its 1996 Asset Purchase agreement with Delrina (Cupertino, CA). By accelerating its quarterly payments to Delrina, Jetform will save approximately $6.4 million in the total amount payable. In addition, the total value of Jetform stock available to Delrina has been raised to $21 million for the next four payments and $14 million thereafter. The agreement, which significantly reduces Jetform's future interest charges, "is an exceptional deal" according to Jetform CFO Ken Killin.
