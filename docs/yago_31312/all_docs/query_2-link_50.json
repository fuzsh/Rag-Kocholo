        "text": "In January 2015 a hoard consisting of 23 medieval coins issued between the years 1443-1444 was brought to the National History Museum of Romania. The hoard was found with a metal detector in the forested area of Rotbav, Brașov County. The hoard contains coins issued by Vladislaus I, as king of Hungary, and by John Hunyadi in mints from Transylvania. Although the archaeological context in which the pieces were found hasn't offered much information, due to the missing of some basic field researches, this hoard could be linked with the military preparations made by John Hunyadi in order to organize an efficient military force for the anti-ottoman campaign that concluded with the battle of Varna. The numismatic evidence for the tumultuous history of Hungary from the middle of the fifteen century indicates that the hoarding phenomenon during the reign of Vladislaus I (1440-1444) and during the regency of John Hunyadi (1441-1456 as voivode of Transylvania and 1446-1452 as regent of Hungary) is not so well represented. This is most probably due to the extremely low value of the coins issued during this period, which had a low content of silver. Therefore, the uncovering of a hoard that contains coins issued by Vladislaus I and John Hunyadi, in Brașov County, is an important historical document that illustrates the struggle of these two to construct a strategy in order to face the ottoman danger. *** Concerning the context of the finding, the 23 coins hoard discussed here was recovered in January 2015. The hoard was found with a metal detector on the top of a small hill 1 , in the forest area located at a distance of 6 kilometers west from Rotbav, a village which is part of Feldioara commune, Brașov County. According to the finder's explanations, the coins were found scattered on a surface of approximatively two square meters, around a shrub, whose roots probably caused the spreading of the coins on such a large area. Also, it is important to mention that the coins were found at a depth of maximum 10 centimeters. The fact that the coins were preserved near the surface of the soil is proved by the conservation status of the coins. Containing a high"
