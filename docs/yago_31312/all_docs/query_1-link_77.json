        "text": "Elisabeth of Bavaria, known as Sissi, was Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, wife of Emperor Franz Joseph I. Born on December 24, 1837, in Munich, Elisabeth was famous for her beauty, independent personality, and enigmatic charm. Raised in a free and unconventional environment, her life changed dramatically when she married Franz Joseph in 1854. Despite the marriage, Sissi found it difficult to adapt to the strict etiquette of the Habsburg court and often distanced herself from Vienna, seeking solace in travel and nature. Devoted to Hungary, she significantly contributed to the Austro-Hungarian reconciliation of 1867. Her life was marked by personal tragedies, including the death of her son Rudolf. Elisabeth was assassinated in 1898 in Geneva by an Italian anarchist, Luigi Lucheni. She has remained an icon of beauty and freedom, immortalized in numerous films and literary works."
