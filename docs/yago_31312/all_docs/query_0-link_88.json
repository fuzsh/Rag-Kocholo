It fills key lacunae in the field, broadening conversations about gender and power by addressing constructions and performances of masculinity as well as engaging with women’s roles, expanding beyond a European framework of analysis, and breaking down conventional barriers between premodern periods. It examines not only rulers and elites in positions of political or religious authority but also others who exerted power in economic, cultural, and symbolic forms.\n\nEditorial Board\n\nElena Woodacre, University of Winchester Carole Levin, University of Nebraska Simon Doubleday, Hofstra University Susan Broomhall, University of Western Australia\n\niii\n\nMEDIEVAL WOMEN, MATERIAL CULTURE, AND POWER MATILDA PLANTAGENET AND HER SISTERS by\n\nJITSKE JASPERSE\n\niv\n\nBritish Library Cataloguing in Publication Data A catalogue record for this book is available from the British Library. © 2020, Arc Humanities Press, Leeds\n\nCopyrighted work available under Creative Commons Attribution only licence CC BY 4.0.

The articles published in Dietrich Kötzsche, ed., Das Evangeliar Heinrichs des Löwen. Kommentar zum Faksimile (Frankfurt am Main: Insel, 1989) and Jochen Luckhardt and Franz Niehoff, eds., Heinrich der Löwe und seine Zeit. Herrschaft und Repräsentation der Welfen 1125–​1235, 3 vols. (Munich: Hirmer, 1995) appear in the footnotes but have been omitted from the bibli‐ ography. The focus in the select bibliography is on material culture, women, and power. I have anglicized most names, including German emperors and places like Braunschweig (as Brunswick) and Hannover (Hanover), but have made some exceptions, including Marie (of Champagne) and Alix (of Blois). The name Leonor of Castile is pre‐ ferred over that of Eleanor in order to avoid confusion between the queen of Castile and her mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. To enhance readability, dates of death of major figures are largely absent in the introduction; instead these are given in the subsequent chapters.\n\nix\n\nPREFACE\n\nMy Matilda book, as I have been calling it over the years, has accompanied me\n\nfrom Amsterdam to Madrid, only to be finished in Berlin. It was my former PhD super‐ visor and dear friend Wendelien van Welie who introduced me to Duchess Matilda when I was her student in Amsterdam. Her interest in Matilda has never ceased and I am happy that she read some of my findings. My scholarly journey would have been impos‐ sible without my mentor, good friend, and eagle-​eyed editor Therese Martin, with whom I closely cooperated in Madrid. She has inspired and supported my research from the start, and generously offered to read my manuscript, for which I am immensely grateful. I sincerely hope that one day I will be able to reciprocate all that she has done for me. Many others have also contributed to the arrival of this publication and I want to express my deepest thanks to all of them. I found a stimulating environment at the Universität Bonn in 2018 when I presented some of my findings from the first chapter at the workshop “Macht und Herrschaft: Pre-​Modern Configurations in a Transcultural Perspective,” organized by Emma O’Loughlin Bérat and Irina Dumitrescu. Cartographer Sebastian Ballard created the fabulous map that accompanies the first chapter. My colleague and sister-​in-​arms Marije Osnabrugge carefully read the chapter on coins and seals; small objects that she knows how to appreciate. Marie-​Adélaïde Nielen kindly sent me a copy of her book on the seals of the French queens and their offspring, and Clément Blanc-​Riehl and Jean-​Luc Chassel equally kindly gave me free use of the images at the Archives nationales in Paris. And I much appreciate Brigitte Bedos-​Rezak’s extensive reply to my enquiries about some seal issues. Amanda Dotseth, Laura Cleaver, Amanda Luyster, Therese Martin, and Chris Woolgar were so good as to discuss with me possible approaches to the gospel book of Henry and Matilda during IMC Leeds 2018. Although the chapter on Matilda’s manuscripts is different from what I had at first envisioned, and probably deviates from what we discussed together, I am happy that they agreed to meet and share their knowledge. The chapter on textiles has greatly benefitted from the invaluable expertise of Ana Cabrera Lafuente, María Judith Feliciano, and María Barra Rios. Justine Moreno, from the Département de Maine-​et-​Loire, kindly responded to my inquiries into the will of Joanna Plantagenet in which textiles are mentioned. And with their insightful comments Martin Aurell and Laurent Macé helped shape this chapter as well. My colleague and dear friend Annika Rulkens read the draft of my epilogue and for that I am grateful, as I am to Heidi Gearhart and Stephanie Pearson, who generously shared their ideas on the index. I also want to express my thanks to Barbara Klössel-​ Luckhardt for sharing with me her article on German noblewomen’s seals as well as for digging up the photo of the so-​called Mathildenbändchen kept at the Niedersächsisches Landesarchiv at Wolfenbüttel, of which Julian Hartig provided me with photos. My thanks are due to student assistant Edouard Compere for kindly checking the footnotes and bibliography.\n\nx\n\nx\n\nThe writing of this book was made possible by the Women’s Funding (Frauenfördermittel) granted by the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, which helped to subsidize the copyrights and images used here. That same university funded my research leave (Freiräume), which I also used to inish this book, and facilitated its Open Access publication through the support by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Open Access Publication Fund of HumboldtUniversität zu Berlin. Deserving special thanks are the two anonymous peer reviewers for Arc Humanities Press, who with their stimulating and thoughtful comments aided me to strengthen my argument and pointed out errors of sense and logic, though whatever shortcomings remain are fully my own. Finally, thanks are owing to Erika Gaffney and Simon Forde at Arc Humanities Press for steering the book through to completion.\n\nJitske Jasperse Institut für Kunst- und Bildgeschichte Professur für Bildkulturen des Mittelalters Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin [email protected]\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION: MATERIAL CULTURE AND PERFORMANCE OF POWER Brunswick, Germany, June\n\n24, 1935. In the Church of St. Blaise the graves belonging to Henry the Lion (1131/​1135–​1195), duke of Saxony and Bavaria, and his wife Matilda (1156–​1189) are unearthed at the behest of the Nazi Party. Henry the Lion was the only child of Duke Henry the Proud and Duchess Gertrud; through his mother, Henry the Lion was the grandson of Emperor Lothar and Empress Richenza. The 1935 excavation was part of a campaign to convert the Christian temple into a Nazi shrine commemorating the Lion. His consort Matilda, as the eldest daughter of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine, as well as the granddaughter of the Empress Matilda, had an equally impressive pedigree, but she was of no use to Nazi propaganda. The redecoration campaign resulted in a profoundly altered church interior featuring heavy granite, large curtains decorated with an eagle and swastika, and aggressive black-​and-​ white sgraffiti on the walls replacing the medieval decoration.1 Reviving Duke Henry was a means to connect the Nazis’ expansionist politics towards Eastern Europe with the duke’s historical conquest of Slavic lands: the duke served as a glorious model of a past that needed to be restored.2 For Matilda little role is evident in this appropriation—​and abuse—​of history, as she was merely the “wife of,” and English rather than German to boot.3 Yet the excavations had another impact as well: the material remains of the ducal couple were photographed and published, allowing modern viewers to glimpse the life and afterlife of Henry and Matilda (Figure 1).4 1 Karl Arndt, “Missbrauchte Geschichte: Der Braunschweiger Dom als politisches Denkmal 1935/​45,” in Heinrich der Löwe und seine Zeit. Herrschaft und Repräsentation der Welfen 1125–​1235, ed. Jochen Luckhardt and Franz Niehoff, 3 vols. (Munich: Hirmer, 1995), 3:88–​95.\n\n2 Karl Arndt (see note 1) points out that the project mainly had a local impact and was only of minor interest to Hitler, who focused on contemporary monumental building projects in Berlin, Munich, and Nuremburg. Nevertheless, St. Blaise was not a unique project; Heinrich Himmler searched for the bones of King Henry I in the Church of St. Servase at Quedlinburg in 1936. See Uta Halle, “936 Begräbnis Heinrich I –​1936 die archäologische Suche nach den Gebeinen in Quedlinburg und die NS-​Propaganda,” Mitteilungen der Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Archäologie des Mittelalters und der Neuzeit 16 (2005): 14–​20.\n\n3 How the Nazis exactly valued Matilda’s presence, as well as that of other medieval elite women, deserves further investigation, but goes beyond the scope of this book. Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg mentioned the medieval queen Matilda (d. 968) when he said that “the first truly great German ruler … is King Henry I [of East Francia] whose wife [Matilda] prided herself on being a direct descendant of Duke Widukind.” Cited in Halle, “936 Begräbnis Heinrich I,” 17.\n\n4 Jörg Weber, “Bericht über die Freilegung der Gruft Heinrichs des Löwen im Sommer 1935,” in Heinrich der Löwe, 3:cat.

Photo: Niedersächsisches Landesarchiv, Wolfenbüttel.\n\nLong after World War II, Duke Henry the Lion managed to captivate the interest of historians, art historians, literary specialists, and numismatists.5 Although Matilda 5 Joachim Ehlers, Heinrich der Löwe: Eine Biographie (Munich: Siedler, 2008), with references to the vast number of publications that appeared concerning Henry the Lion; Johannes Fried and Otto Gerhard Oexle, eds., Heinrich der Löwe. Herrschaft und Repräsentation (Ostfildern: Thorbecke, 2003); Jochen Luckhardt and Franz Niehoff, eds., Heinrich der Löwe und seine Zeit. Herrschaft und\n\n3\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nwas a crucial part of the story of Henry’s rise to and fall from power, scholars have not accorded her a prominent place in the duke’s daily affairs, neither in his rise nor fall. This scholarly oversight is all the more surprising given the survival of no fewer than four twelfth-​century visual representations of the royal couple: Matilda and Henry appear together on a coin, in a psalter, and twice in a gospel book. This indicates that Matilda’s involvement mattered to Henry the Lion. Indeed, it would only be through Matilda that he and his family were able to stay at Henry II’s court between 1182 and 1185 after the duke had been exiled from Germany by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Yet Matilda is rarely considered to have played an active role in Saxon politics, and this is partly due to the scarcity of references to Matilda in charters and chronicles. As we will see, Matilda is not completely absent from the chronicles, which provide basic information on her birth, status, marriage, and motherhood, but fail to offer much more than that. Many medieval elite women of Matilda’s time shared the same fate, mainly because most chroniclers were producing their narratives for male rulers and religious institutions led by men, while also pursuing their own clerical agendas. Given Matilda’s royal status we would, however, expect her to appear in charters issued by her husband, who was of lower status. In fact, only three such documents are known. A charter dated February 1, 1168, known through a seventeenth-​century copy, tells that Henry and Matilda were engaged in Minden Cathedral on that day.6 Matilda appears in the charter’s recognitio—​indicating place and time—​as Machtildem filiam regis Anglie. The filiam regis Anglie expression is far from unusual, since it can be found in almost all of the other written sources, but its presence in Henry’s charters evinces that it was important to the duke as well. The second charter dates from 1170 and is known to us from a sixteenth-​century cartulary. The document’s closing protocol states: “All these things were done with the consent of the glorious Lady Matilda, duchess of Bavaria and Saxony, and also with the devout permission of Lady Gertrud, daughter of Henry and Clementia; prosperous until eternity.”7 Matilda is designated as domine Matildis, Bawaria et Saxonie ducisse. Lady—​or female lord—​refers to Matilda’s marital status, through which she had obtained the title of duchess, sharing in her husband’s authority as duke of Bavaria and Saxony. Since Matilda is merely mentioned as domina, rather than uxor Repräsentation der Welfen 1125–​1235, 3 vols.

Two conclusions may be drawn from the mention that Gertrud had granted her permission: first, that Gertrud was still Henry’s only heir and was therefore entitled to inherit; and second, that because of her right to inheritance, she was in a position to wield influence.\n\n4\n\n4 Introduction\n\nor coniunx, this may indicate that Henry and Matilda had as yet not shared a bed, which would be understandable considering that Matilda was still only fourteen at the time. When turning to the third and final charter, which has survived in its original form, this situation has changed. This document mentions Henry’s donation to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem (1172). Matilda, who did not join Henry on his journey due to her pregnancy, is not presented as a co-​donor, nor does she give her consent or act as a witness, but instead she is cited as one of the beneficiaries.8 Both Matilda’s descent and her authority as duchess are specifically stated. The addition of uxoris mee is meaningful, as it not only declares that the relation between Matilda and Henry is legitimate, but also implies that she is responsible for Henry’s offspring, for whose spiritual wellbeing the donation was also made. Of the 123 charters connected with Duke Henry, only these three mention Matilda, but they give an important insight into the development of her position from young bride to young mother.9 We should be wary of interpreting Matilda’s absence from Henry’s ducal documents as clear evidence of her absence in his lordship, especially given that she, as we shall see, appears in visual sources. Rather, it fits the charter evidence for the Saxon lands where women’s names were rarely included, even though these women do appear in chronicles and lists of properties owned by monas‐ teries and churches as well as on coins.10 Apart from the challenging written source material, another explanation for the lack of a more detailed analysis of Matilda’s actions must be sought in the scholarly assumption that Matilda mainly embodied status and monetary value. This percep‐ tion springs from the many chroniclers who mentioned Henry’s marriage to the filia regis Anglorum (daughter of the king of the English) and spoke of the great treasures she brought with her.11 Their entries have been read as a confirmation of the wealth of 8 “Notum sit omnibus tam presentibus quam futuris sancte matris ecclesie filiis, quod ego Henricus per dei gratiam Bawarie et Saxonie dux misericordie instinctu tactus pro remissione omnium peccatorum meorum et inclite uxoris mee ducisse Matildis, magnifici Anglorum regis filie, et eorum, quos deus misericordie sue dono michi dedit, heredum nec non et totius generis mei tres lampades perpetuo ad honorem dei ardentes in dominice resurectionis ecclesia locari constitui et ordinavi.” MGH DD HL, 143–​45, no. 94.

Before her death Duchess Gertrud (d. 1143), Henry the Lion’s mother, appears in three charters, each time together with her son. Clementia of Zahringen, Henry’s first wife, appears in one of his charters (MGH DD HL, 22, no. 13) and is represented together with Henry on his coinage. See also chap. 2, p. 44–45. Sophie, the wife of Henry’s competitor Albrecht the Bear, who was margrave of Saxony (r. 1138–​1142) and margrave of Brandenburg (1150, 1157–​1170), features four times in documents issued by her husband.

To counter and nuance that narrative, this book argues that the impressive range of belongings that I connect to Duchess Matilda—​textiles, illuminated manuscripts, coins, chronicles, charters, and literary texts—​allows us to perceive elite women’s performance of power, even when they are largely absent from the official documentary record. It is especially through the visual record of material culture that we can hear female voices, allowing us to forge an alternative way toward rethinking assumptions about power for sparsely documented elite women.14 The eldest daughter of the king and queen of England, Matilda was among the most elite of women and, as I will make clear, she was far from a passive pawn. That she exerted power from 1170 to 1189 as daughter, consort, regent, patron, and mother is corroborated by the traces of the many artefacts connected to her. At this point it is worthwhile to return to the grave of Henry and Matilda. From an art historical perspec‐ tive what surfaced is quite disappointing: no jewellery, no clothing, and no precious grave goods, even though “pearls of rosaries, bronze pins, and the remains of sarcoph‐ agus hinges” were found.15 In addition a tablet-​woven band—​perhaps covering a lock—​ and a bright spot of silver tarnish were discovered on the leather shroud covering one 1889), 4:234; Annalen van Egmond, Containing the Annales Egmundenses, Annales Xantenses, het Egmondse leven van Thomas Becket, ed. and trans.

Forty years later, the excavation report together with its interpretations were critically analyzed; the consensus is now that it was Henry the Lion who was buried in the leather sack and thus the textile is thought to belong with his remains.17 A modern in-​depth study of the weaving’s material and technical qualities combined with an analysis of comparable tablet weaves might help to establish the band’s function and meaning, and perhaps even its origin of manu‐ facture.18 Unfortunately, such an enterprise may never be undertaken because the band’s current whereabouts are unknown. The textile archaeologist Karl Schlabow, who was the director of the Industriemuseum Neumünster where the tablet-​woven band was studied and reproduced after it was excavated, estimated that this 6 mm wide band was woven using nineteen tablets, each with four holes, resulting in a warp of seventy-​six threads. The band was made of a brightly coloured purple silk with patterns in gold brocading, a technique of adding “a floating, supplemental weft thread to the ground weave.”19 This textile trace, like the many objects discussed in the present study, goes beyond a simple narrative focusing on the duke as it offers an example of the value of material culture for elite people to shape medieval life—​and afterlife—​regardless of their sex. It is through these objects rather than charter evidence that history, from visual to social to cul‐ tural, can be told because they are vivid reminders of the importance of communicating wealth, prestige, and power. Which brings me to the most compelling reason for writing about Matilda and her sisters; that is, to investigate the connections between women and power through the lens of material culture, still an under-​developed approach in medieval studies with its continued focus on the written record. Before addressing how I deal with power and performance, however, the term “material culture” deserves some explanation. 16 Tilmann Schmidt, “Die Grablege Heinrichs des Löwen im Dom zu Braunschweig,” Braunschwei­ gisches Jahrbuch 55 (1974): 9–​71 at 12. 17 Schmidt, “Die Grablege Heinrichs,” 9–​71.\n\n18 The tablet-​woven band found on Henry the Lion’s body does not necessarily indicate that it belonged to him. Of course, the same caution is in place when the band was thought to be Matilda’s.

The definition of brocading is from Nancy Spies, Ecclesiastical Pomp and Aristocratic Circumstance: A Thousand Years of Brocaded Tabletwoven Bands (Jarrettsville: Arelate Studio, 2000), 71. The warp consists of lengthwise organized threads, with a single thread running through each of the holes in the tablets (a square tablet has four holes and therefore a maximum of four threads). By turning the tablets a shed is created through which the weft is passed.\n\n7\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nFigure 2. Mathildenbändchen. Wolfenbüttel, NLA WO 250 N, Nr. 205.

Often, the emphasis has been on everyday objects—​varying from tools to pottery, and from textiles to furniture.20 However, as Roberta Gilchrist has pointed out, these artefacts are not so ordinary because they either have survived or were documented. In addition, many of these items belonged to higher social levels of society, the silk tablet-​woven band found in Henry the Lion’s grave being a case in point.21 Indeed, items made for and used by elites, as well as artefacts related to the practice 20 Anne Gerritsen and Giorgio Riello, “Introduction: Writing Material Culture History,” in Writing Material Culture History, ed.

For example, artefacts can help us to recall a person or an event, triggering our senses and emotions. The term material culture also suggests that the widest variety of objects can be studied, and it rejects a hierarchy of media, something that long has dominated art history with its emphasis on the “high arts” of painting and sculpture. In the present case, not only luxury manuscripts but also coins and seals, which I study from formal and semiotic perspectives in order to shed light on personal and collective identities, provide evidence of the communicative powers of objects and the networks of relationships connecting people and things.23 Thinking of artefacts and their “affective, social, cultural and economic relationships” with people has resulted in some innova‐ tive ways of rethinking medieval artworks, both whole and fragmentary.24 For example, the materiality of objects has been studied in terms of their social value by taking into account what they are made of, their size, and their biography (the social life of things).25 Another way of approaching materiality takes into account the theological, philosoph‐ ical, and somatic ideas concerning matter and reality.26 This, in turn, has resulted in studies that investigate haptic, sensory, and performative aspects of artworks.27 I address material culture as items that are closely linked to the elite society in which they were produced and activated.28 The works are analyzed in relation to their mul‐ tiple users, acknowledging that objects themselves have agency.

In a thought-​provoking article, Marie Kelleher pointed out that despite the influence of Michel Foucault’s understanding of power as not being “unidirectional” nor “necessarily belonging to one set of public institutions,” the focus still was on women and public power; that is, elite women’s power exercised through institutions.31 As a consequence, the conclusion often has been that women held less or different power. Foucault’s analysis of power as a matter of gov‐ ernment, which includes “political structures or the management of states,”32 does not sit easily with twelfth-​century realities of power, which, as Thomas Bisson has insisted, were inextricably linked with lordship, that is, the personal command over dependent people.33 Regrettably, female lordship plays no part in Bisson’s analysis, a fundamental omission given that Kimberley LoPrete has argued that women exercised authoritative lordly powers.34 However, from a gendered perspective Foucault’s idea of government has had its merits, as it also includes “modes of action, more or less considered and calculated, that were destined to act upon the possibilities of action of other people.”35 In the case of medieval women the latter exercise of power has been labelled agency or\n\n29 For a definition of agency that includes the impact actors and actions have, see Gilchrist, Gender and Archaeology, glossary at xiii.

This does no jus‐ tice to the range of possibilities that both women and men had at their disposal to affect others, such as financing civic architecture, creating alliances, or gathering an army. Nor does it agree with the reality of men’s lives when they are treated as a homogenous group that held and shared in power equally, without acknowledging that their leverage greatly differed and depended on multiple economic and social circumstances.37 Kelleher’s proposed definition of power “as the ability to take action that has the potential to affect the destiny of others” acknowledges exactly the breadth and inclu‐ siveness of Foucault’s analysis.38 Inclusiveness allows us to investigate the power of a woman such as Matilda, whose government has not been formally documented in char‐ ters, chronicles, or ceremonies of fealty. We can focus on the question of how women “actually used [power], individually, as part of a ruling couple, as a parent, or collec‐ tively.”39 Recent studies on medieval women have demonstrated that material culture is a fruitful way of exploring objects as an important nexus between women, dynasty, and power.40 36 See also Mary Erler and Maryanne Kowaleski, “Introduction,” in Women and Power in the Middle Ages, ed.

For one, because both men and women interacted with artefacts by commissioning, donating, and displaying them. While particular objects, such as a given sword or book, may be labelled male or female, textile donations in the central Middle Ages, for example, do not neatly fit these categories, a useful reminder that these binaries did not exist in the extreme or were not always that evident. Further, thinking along those lines of opposites suggests that men and women are stable catego‐ ries, always acting out their identities in the same way (e.g. by giving gender-​specified gifts), without acknowledging the impact of political and economic developments, as well as changes in lifecycle, such as age and widowhood.42 Reaching a senior age or being a widow could support women in gaining and exercising power in what some scholars perceive as the public sphere inhabited by men, indicating women’s actions were not necessarily limited to their household. But more importantly, the analytic dichotomy public–​private does not do justice to how medieval people must have experienced their lives: could a woman’s gift to a church or an ally really have been considered a private affair, devoid of any sense of public authority? And how to value women’s (and men’s) display of elaborate dress within the confinement of the castle while discussing military strategies: a public or private affair? As these questions show, material culture helps us to shift away from binaries that tend to be central to documentary sources. Analyzing material culture as a pathway for perceiving women’s power also aids in understanding “power as the outcome of dynamic (rather than fixed) processes, and as the result of social structures rather than individual agency,” which includes women’s connections with men and women’s interactions with women.43 The dynamics of power relations have also been pointed out by Foucault, who remarked that it can result in a “strategy of struggle, in which the two forces are not superimposed, do not lose their specific nature, or do not finally become confused. Each constitutes for the other a kind of permanent limit, a point of possible reversal.”44 Material culture can be recognized as a manner in which to demonstrate power as well as part of the struggle for obtaining and maintaining that power. In both cases, there is a clear awareness of the presence of other parties involved in the exercise of power. Thus, in my analysis of the artefacts connected to Matilda, the negotiation of power through artworks, and the potential conversion of their meaning in the hands of new owners is explicitly taken into account. Precisely because material culture is part of the exercise and negotiation of power, and holds an active potential, the term “performance” is used here. Here performance means\n\n41 Kelleher, “What Do We Mean by ‘Women and Power’?,” 114. Kelleher also warned against denying or ignoring that women’s expressions of power can play into negative gender stereotypes, such as scold or gossip. 42 Erler and Kowaleski, “Introduction,” in Gendering the Master Narrative, 2.\n\n43 Gilchrist, Gender and Archaeology, 28.

And it also includes the agency that artefacts themselves have, such as keeping memories alive, eliciting emotions, triggering donations, or spurring people to visit places. It is through cultural acts, in which objects play a dynamic role, that power relations are constructed and power itself is displayed.45 Material culture empowered women to create, activate, manipulate, and promote their present ambitions and preserve the future of their dynasties.46 “Performance of power” thus refers to the instrumental character of artefacts and buildings: through the items with which societies interacted, high-​born women like Matilda sought to impact their own lives as well as those of their natal and marital families. My concern here is the agency of objects and the interactions between objects and people in medieval society, and not the unsolvable question of Matilda as the primary person commissioning artefacts. In an excellent analysis of patronage for the Bayeux Tapestry (actually an embroidery), Elizabeth Carson Pastan argued that the model of a micro-​managing Renaissance patron fits uncomfortably with medieval material and that the focus on Odo of Bayeux has led to extensive (and not necessarily fruitful) speculations.47 Further, the identifying of depicted figures as sponsors tends to over‐ shadow the object’s materiality as an indicator for possible patronage.48 For example, the ninth-​century purple pillow discovered in the tomb of St. Remigius at Rheims demonstrates that patronage per se is not the most fruitful category of analysis. While the gold embroidered inscription mentions Bishop Hincmar as the person ordering it to be made, it was Alpais (d. after 852), the sister of Emperor Charles the Bold, who col‐ lected the materials, embroidered and presented it. 45 The idea of performance as a constitutive act is borrowed from Judith Butler, although she defines performance in a different way; that is, as repetitive acts that construct construction of gender identity (sexed bodies), and thus have a differing potential. Butler’s ideas about gender and performance have not gone unnoticed by medievalists; see Erler and Kowaleski, “Introduction,” in Gendering the Master Narrative, 2; Madeline H. Caviness, Visualizing Women in the Middle Ages. Sight, Spectacle, and Scopic Economy (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001); Virginia Chieffo Raguin and Sarah Stanbury, Women’s Space.

He indeed ordered it so, but she happily carried this out and made the work you see here. By the occasion of the new honor [the translation of the relics and dedication of the new church] she made this little pillow, which will support the sweet and venerable head of Remigius. Through the merits of Alpais everywhere, may her prayers be furthered beyond the stars.49\n\n13\n\nValerie Garver has brought to the fore that, while the inscription hails Hincmar as the patron who commissioned the work, the text clearly praises Alpais as instrumental in executing the little pillow. Alpais used her work to document her virtue, found a way to interact with St. Remigius, and sought to keep her own memory alive.50 That the inscribed presence of women’s names can very well indicate their active participation in the making process has been put forward convincingly by Therese Martin. She proposed an important new direc‐ tion in rethinking the relationship between medieval women and art by introducing the concept of women as makers. Her argument that women should be viewed as makers of art and architecture originates from the (me) fecit inscriptions found on objects and buildings, which often held flexible meanings, enabling us to see women’s contributions as “patrons and facilitators, producers and artists, owners and recipients.”51 Envisioning Matilda and other women as makers encourages a rethinking of objects that either have been consid‐ ered from the perspective of male patronage, or have been largely ignored because they are anonymous. Moreover, the term “maker” is more powerful than “patron,” as it suggests an action performed through art that is meant to achieve something: from commemoration through prayers, to salving the wounds of conflicts, to making rulership omnipresent, to communicating social networks. This empowering impact of material culture is at the heart of this book. In order to contextualize Matilda’s engagement with material culture, it is neces‐ sary to consider other elite women. The selection of these women is primarily based on Matilda’s natal network, meaning that artefacts connected to her sisters Leonor and Joanna are included. Matilda’s parents, Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, also feature, as do her half-​sisters Marie of Champagne and Alix of Blois. Colette Bowie’s study of the daughters of Henry II and Eleanor has been pivotal in understanding the importance of the natal family to Matilda, Leonor, and Joanna.52 The spread of Thomas Becket’s cult 49 Cited in Valerie L.

Yet the author’s emphasis on written over visual evidence means that Leonor, whose life can best be traced through textual sources, receives disproportionate attention. Bowie’s book is of immense value to scholars working on the Angevins, but I demonstrate here that shifting the focus to material culture paints a different picture of Matilda’s relative power than Bowie and other scholars have acknowledged. Viewing the duchess as a maker of artworks reveals the otherwise undocumented ways in which objects empowered her and enabled her to cement significant social connections. How elementary artefacts were to medieval culture is evident if we once more return to the graves of Matilda and Henry. Even though fragmentary, the tablet-​woven band, pearls of rosaries, bronze pin, and traces of silver offer material evidence of the desire to be buried, commemorated, and resurrected according to their highborn status. Back in 1935, this was of no interest to the Nazis. They only wanted to appropriate Henry the Lion as a bellicose role model, while largely denying Matilda any part in their history. But as scholars have shown in recent decades, the roles in lordship played by medieval women were crucial, even if they can be difficult to discern in documentary sources, and so it is through a focus on their objects that a more comprehensive picture of Matilda’s power and that of other elite women is painted. As Chapter 1 demonstrates, Matilda treasured her royal descent and could rely on her natal family when she and Henry were exiled in 1182 as the result of Henry’s ongoing refusal to comply with the demands of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa,54 yet the duchess spent most of her time in Saxony, where at least some goods that I connect to Matilda were manufactured. My focus on women’s material culture means that the ducal couple’s exile between July 25, 1182 and September 1185 plays a minor role.55 Surely Daughters of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, by Colette Bowie, sehepunkte.

One of the first to draw attention to the importance of the daughters in the spread in the Becket cult was Kay Brainard Slocum, “Angevin Marriage Diplomacy and the Early Dissemination of the Cult of Thomas Becket,” Medieval Perspectives 14 (1999): 214–​28. For recent research on the cult, including the role of the Plantagenet sisters, see Paul Webster and Marie-​Pierre Gelin, eds., The Cult of St Thomas Becket in the Plantagenet World, c.1170–​c.1220 (Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 2016), to which Colette Bowie also contributed.\n\n54 The events that led to Henry the Lion’s downfall and exile are more complex than can be dealt with here. I refer the reader to Ehlers, Heinrich der Löwe, 317–​44 (in which references to primary sources and the most important scholarship are given) and 354–​66 (for a discussion of the period 1182–​1185).\n\n55 The departure date of July 25, the feast day of St. James of Compostela, suggests that the punish‐ ment with exile also had a penitential component. Ehlers, Heinrich der Löwe, 354 and 357.\n\n15\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nMatilda interacted with artefacts while travelling through Normandy and England and remaining at Henry II’s court, as is corroborated by the English Pipe Rolls in which the expenses the king made for his daughter, son-​in-​law, and their household are recorded.56 Food, wine, and horses, as well as travel and entertainment, were all subsidized by the king. And the importance of garments and furs, which will also be discussed in the first chapter, clearly surfaces from the Pipe Rolls, demonstrating the value Henry II attached to the appearance of his family members. While we can imagine that textiles, like horses and food, played a crucial role in the performance of power, with the Pipe Rolls as the main source it is difficult to establish how Matilda used such items to impact the lives of others. The richness of the material culture with which the duchess engaged is best documented for Saxony, where Matilda undoubtedly had more leverage than at the Anglo-​ Norman court, where she ultimately was a guest. Importantly, it was in her marital land that the coin type on which Matilda and Henry are depicted circulated. In Chapter 2, this coin type is contextualized by taking into account other coins as well as seals because these miniature items render visible how women’s power was displayed, experienced, and exercised. In Saxony Matilda also presented generous gifts to religious communities on at least three occasions. The ducal couple donated a gospel book to the Church of St. Blaise in Brunswick, which was part of their Burg. In Chapter 3, an analysis of the gospel book together with their psalter—​made in the same workshop—​clarifies how the self-​ fashioning of their personal and dynastic identity helped the rulers to stage their power. Later, as we shall see in Chapter 4, Matilda gifted luxurious vestments to Bishop Ulrich of Halberstadt and presented textiles and vasa sacra to the Cathedral in Hildesheim. I argue that she strategically engaged with textiles in order to enforce relations with churchmen. By following the material traces connected to Matilda, along with those of some of her contemporaries, I show the importance of women as makers of material culture, as well as the dual agency of women and their objects in the consolidation of their very real, if all but unwritten, power.\n\n56 See PR 30 Hen II, 134, 135, 138, and 145; and PR 31 Hen II, 9, 206, and 2015.

The same argument can be made for Joanna when in 1177 she married King William II of Sicily. Whether Matilda’s younger sister Leonor (1161–​1214) was given Gascony as dowry when she married Alfonso VIII, king of Castile, is debated among historians, since no English records make mention of such a grant.3 While Alfonso certainly went to great lengths to claim Eleanor of Aquitaine’s land, it was never successfully consolidated in his kingdom. The absence of dowry was compensated for by the auxilium—​payments made by his subjects, in this case to facilitate the marriage—​Henry II raised: Matilda brought £5,102 sterling to Saxony, a sum higher than the £4,549 he would later collect for Joanna’s marriage in 1177. Matilda’s auxilium matched that of the money spent by her great-​grandfather King Henry I on the occasion of his daughter Matilda’s engagement to the German king (and later emperor) Henry V, who received 10,000 Cologne marks of silver, which corresponds to £5,000.4 Even though no similar large sums of money are documented for Leonor, it is only reasonable to assume that she brought a substantial sum of silver into her marriage with Alfonso. In addition to the silver, Matilda was accompanied by many treasures that are exam‐ ined here to demonstrate the ongoing importance of artefacts in marriage politics.5 1 A vast amount of references to scholarly discussions of dowry, dower, and their developments as well as a critique of the general idea that medieval transformations in property management are evidence of a loss in status for women, can be found in Cynthia Johnson, “Marriage Agreements from Twelfth-​Century Southern France,” in To Have and To Hold: Marrying and Its Documentation in Western Christendom, 400–​1600, ed. Philip L. Reynolds and John Witte (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), 215–​59. The documents she studied are concerned with immobile prop‐ erty and money. Although moveable goods are sometimes mentioned, they are never specified. 2 For their dowries and dowers, see Bowie, The Daughters, Part III.\n\n3 José Manuel Cerda Costabal, “La dot gasconne d’Aliénor d’Angleterre. Entre royaume de Castille, royaume de France et royaume d’Angleterre,” Cahiers de civilisation médiévale 54, no. 215 (2011): 225–​42.

A Cologne mark differed from an English mark in that it was worth half a pound, not two thirds of a pound. 5 For the different meanings the word treasure could hold to medieval people, see Elizabeth M. Tyler, ed., Treasure in the Medieval West (York: York Medieval Press, 2000). For sumptuous\n\n18\n\n18 Staging the Bride and her Treasure\n\nThese treasures included gold, silver, vessels, vestments, chairs, saddles, and many other items. By asking how such pieces reflected the royal status of Matilda’s natal family and added to the creation of her social identity, Matilda’s sumptuous goods can be understood as a first step in the performance of power of royal daughters. To this end, comparisons are made with moveable objects that can be connected to her paternal grandmother Empress Matilda (d. 1167) and to the younger Matilda’s sisters in the con‐ text of their respective marriages. In a way, Princess Matilda followed in the footsteps of her eponymous grandmother, who as an eight-​year-​old had journeyed to Germanic lands to meet her future husband, King Henry V (d. 1125). Matilda’s sister Leonor went to Iberia to become the wife of King Alfonso VIII of Castile (d. 1214) while Joanna was to marry first King William II of Sicily (d. 1189) and later Count Raymond VI of Toulouse (d. 1222). Matilda, Leonor, and Joanna were twelve, eight/​nine, and eleven respectively when they entered the households of their husbands-​to-​be. In Colette Bowie’s discussion of the marriages of the three sisters, she traced Leonor’s and Joanna’s travel routes; together with the possible routes I suggest for Matilda, it is possible to map the way-​stations on the journey of each to her new court (see Map 1).6 Henry II placed his daughters strategically across western Europe, dispersing them as he did other gifts.7 Equally importantly, the artefacts as part of a woman’s marriage arrangements in the early medieval period, see in the same volume: Leslie Webster, “Ideal and Reality: Versions of Treasure in the Early Anglo-​Saxon World,” 49–​59 at 51; and Pauline Stafford, “Queens and Treasure in the Early Middle Ages,” 61–​82.

Design: Sebastian Ballard.\n\n20\n\n20 Staging the Bride and her Treasure\n\nyoung women’s travels demonstrate that their journeys were a vital part of the commu‐ nication of the English king’s power.8 Each journey can be seen as a theatrical stage that allowed Henry to promote himself and his daughters through the display of both goods and people, from bishops, counts, and dukes to the princesses’ personal entourage and other relatives. At the same time, this ostentatious representation was a means to reconnect with sometimes estranged allies, and also to acknowledge the high prestige of the future bridegrooms. After all, these marriages were political actions as well as political events, strategically conceived by the English king and his carefully selected sons-​in-​law. Based on the material, visual, and performative aspects of the sisters’ travels, these journeys should be understood as formative experiences for Henryʼs daughters. They learned that the display and gifting of artefacts were crucial when aiming to impact others. My analysis of the materiality of these objects also shows that the precious items themselves held agency. Here, materiality refers to the materials used to craft the artworks (such as silver, gold, silk, and fur) as well as to the communicative meaning these materials held in the eyes of the beholder. The underlying assumption is that viewers were aware of the history of materials and their symbolic and economic value.9\n\nFrom England to Saxony\n\nArrangements for the marriage of Matilda and Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony and Bavaria, commenced in April 1165, when she was nearly nine years old.10 This marriage, like that of her grandmother the Empress Matilda as well as those of her sisters Leonor and Joanna, provided ample opportunity to display the status and wealth of the young princess and her natal family during the long journeys to their new homes. From the entries in the Pipe Rolls, in which expenditures concerning England were recorded, it is possible to distil a general impression of what Matilda brought with her. Between July and September 1167 envoys from Germany had arrived in England to accompany Matilda to Saxony. In September of that year, the princess and her mother travelled from Winchester (?) to Dover, accompanied by Henry the Lion’s and Henry II’s envoys, who took Matilda to Saxony while her mother stayed behind.11 Matilda departed from England in a royal ship (esnecca), accompanied by six other vessels, clearly displaying her royal status.12 The 8 For medieval brides’ travels and dynastic politics, mainly focusing on the later Middle Ages, see Karl-​Heinz Spieß, “Unterwegs zu einem fremden Ehemann.

The goods were carried by thirty-​four pack mules (sumar) to be loaded onto the ships.13 From this entry, it is possible to get an idea of the exotic nature of the cloths in Matida’s holdings, silks that in all likelihood originated from Byzantium and Iberia.14 Introduced by the Muslims, silk production in Spain was booming in the twelfth cen‐ tury and was exported to the rest of Europe, with London as an important centre for the trade of silks and furs. Drap de Mulce frequently appears in French and English romances, and it is possible that pannis de Musce refers to the cloth made in Murcia.15 The sable furs were imported as well. Sable, a Siberian animal of the marten family, has very valuable fur;16 Henry II paid £16 for the twelve sables he gave to Matilda, which is more than he paid for the seven chairs and seven saddles she also brought with her. Sable fur reappears in the Pipe Rolls, indicating that it was held in high regard, with its costliness further underscored when mentioned together with other high-​priced items, such as scarlet and silk. The samite cloth, also a silk, is the only piece that provides some insight into its appearance, as it refers to a specific weaving technique.17 Woven fabrics were used for clothing as well as for decorating chambers, widows, and tables. The gilded chairs of Matilda’s dowry were suitable to be covered with cloth, such as scarlet (scarleta or escarlata), which is a fine woollen shaved cloth that was dyed with kermes from the Mediterranean.

Matilda’s cargo also included twelve sable furs (sabilinis), a riding horse (palefrido) and a hunter (fugatore). The palfrey and hunter, for which thirty-​seven shillings were paid, are spec‐ ified as being Matilda’s and were meant for hunting, an event also suitable to display status, wealth, and privileges. Like the silks and distinctly coloured materials, the furs and horses wielded symbolic, economic, and aesthetic agency. Evidently, King Henry II sent off his daughter with sufficient pomp when he bestowed upon her an impressive variety of textiles, although the Pipe Roll entry lacks references to their colour. Equally, no explicit allusions to the appearance of Matilda’s outfits are made, whereas entries referring to mantles lined with fur (pelliciis) or a large pallium of the finest wool dyed with red kermes and lined with sable fur (pallio magno de escarlata de bissis cum sabellinis) do exist for other members of Henry’s household.18 Visual sources, such as the seal belonging to Matilda’s sister Joanna and a miniature in Henry and Matilda’s psalter, which we will examine in detail in Chapters 3 and 4, demonstrate the presence of fur-​lined mantles in the wardrobe of elite men and women (Figure 15 and Figure 17). In their psalter, Henry and Matilda are humbly depicted at the foot of Christ’s cross. Henry’s red mantle has slipped from his shoulders, but the grey and white fur collar is still visible. Matilda’s green mantle is trimmed with similar fur, with the grey fur perhaps being vair, which is the grey winter fur of the red squirrel. The highest quality of winter squirrel furs was found in Scandinavia and Russia; they were exported to Western Europe via the Baltic.19 On her seal matrix, Joanna wears the same type of cloak held together by as tassel. With her left hand, Joanna touches this fringed cord that fastens the mantle. The lining of her mantle is prominently displayed and its pattern suggests that it could be miniver; that is, vair furs stitched together so that only the white bellies and some grey around them remained. The small size of vair furs meant that large numbers were needed for lining mantles, making them very costly.20 The colour, texture, and size of furs, whether real or represented, were wrapped around the bodies of men and women to communicate their wearer’s position in society; they signalled wealth, prestige, and fashion. Sybilla Schröder’s extensive analysis of the material culture mentioned in the Pipe Rolls has revealed that textiles were an important part of Henry II’s royal representa‐ tion and that of his familia.21 Acquiring, shipping, and presenting fabrics and vestments 18 For Queen Margaret in 1175/​1176, see PR 22 Hen II, 198: “Et pro 4 ulnis et dimidia escarlatiet pro 1 pena varia et pellicia et 1 sabelina et 32 ulnis linee tele ad opus filie regis Francie contra Pascha 4l. et 5s. et 6d. per breve regis.

A further examination of the Pipe Rolls may reveal more about the gendered nature of material culture.\n\n23\n\nStaging the Bride and her Treasure\n\n23\n\nto friends, family, and followers was a way to show off status while simultaneously cementing alliances. In this respect Matilda’s endowment was not unusual, for the crown’s expenses were certainly not limited to marriages. This is evidenced, for example, by Henry’s expenditures for his daughter-​in-​law Margaret of France, wife of Henry the Young King and daughter of Louis VII and Constance of Castile. On several occasions she received a roba, which can mean a complete outfit as well as baggage containing textiles and perhaps also non-​textiles. For Margaret and Henry’s coronation in Winchester in 1172, their robes cost over £88, a huge amount compared to other expenses made for Margaret’s apparel.22 Henry II took care of Margaret’s needs not only because she belonged to his family, but also because she herself was a royal daughter, and she there‐ fore required trappings that acknowledged and displayed both qualities. Yet what makes Matilda’s sumptuous silks different from Margaret’s is that she took them overseas to a new court. Matilda could have used part of these goods to adorn her new home, but her father knew very well that golden vessels and saddles also made for desirable gifts and would therefore aid the young Matilda to consolidate her position in Saxony. Gold and silver vessels had a material and artistic value, as well as a functional and representational one since they could be used during liturgy, meals, and court rit‐ uals. The two gemellions, or basins, donated by Matilda’s brother, John Lackland, to his nephew King Otto IV (Matilda’s son) should be understood this way.23 The water basins from Limoges—​located in the centre of Angevin territory—​are adorned with the three Angevin lions. Decoration and recognizable place of manufacture served as vivid and enduring reminders of the German king’s Angevin connections, as the basins would have been used not only by Otto, but were the type of objects that we can imagine to have been displayed permanently. The ships accompanied Matilda to Dover and it seems likely that from there the cargo moved onto other ships or carts that set sail to Wissant (Witsand) in Flanders, as can be inferred from other journeys the royal family undertook from Dover to the main‐ land.24 The Flanders route was the shortest way to reach the continent. While there is not enough data to reconstruct Matilda’s route from Wissant to Saxony in detail, two pos‐ sible routes are the most likely for this interregional travel (Map 1). The first would have been to continue over water from Flanders (Bruges, Ghent, or Antwerp), taking the River Scheldt and then passing a network of waterways up north until reaching the Dutch lakes IJ and Almere. The count of Flanders, Philip of Alsace (d. 1191), and Matilda’s father were well acquainted, although the relationship was not without tensions due to feudal disputes.25 Nothing in the written sources suggests that the strained relations impacted 22 PR 18 Hen II, 144: “Et in Soltis per breve Regis pro Roba Regis filii Regis et Regine sue in corona‐ tion eorum apud Wintonia 88l. et 10s. et 4d. per breve Regis et per testimonium Aedwardi Blundi.”\n\n23 Jitske Jasperse, “Is It All about Empire?

From the Low Countries Matilda would have con‐ tinued over the North Sea, going either to Bremen via the River Weser, or to Hamburg via the Elbe. Both Bremen and Hamburg were within the lands her future husband claimed; from there it was relatively easy and safe to reach Brunswick. The second travel option would have entailed an overland route: after her arrival at Wissant, Matilda would have passed through Boulogne and, via Tongres (Tongeren) and Maastricht, she then would likely have visited Aachen and Cologne. From there the rest of the travel continued through Henry the Lion’s territories, halting at abbeys and monasteries such as the Abdinghof in Paderborn before reaching Brunswick. Whatever Matilda’s route may have been, we know that she had arrived by February 1, 1168 at her final destination: on that date, her union with Duke Henry was formalized by Bishop Werner in Minden Cathedral, according to a charter issued by Henry.26 Transport on land from Wissant to Minden would have been approximately 600 kilometres and over water about 1,000 kilometres. Despite such great distances, it is unlikely that Matilda and her entourage needed four and a half months for this journey, even when taking into account that they might have been slowed down by carts loaded with goods and the winter weather conditions, not to mention upstream travel. It is pos‐ sible that along the way the princess and her retinue spent time at important places, engaging with influential people. Or Matilda might have arrived at Brunswick weeks before the marriage, so that she could get acquainted with her future husband and his court. If we are to believe Albert of Stade (writing 1204–​1264), the nuptial feasting occurred at Brunswick in great splendour, perhaps an indication that after the reli‐ gious ceremony at Minden the crowd travelled to Brunswick to magnificently celebrate Henry’s marriage to a princess.27 Although no details about these festivities are known, it is likely that Henry the Lion would have taken the opportunity to present his royal bride with much pomp. As the daughter of the king of England, Matilda deserved a great feast that acknowledged her high status and integrated her into the court, while also allowing the duke to present himself in a most favourable light. As noted above, the Empress Matilda, grandmother of Duchess Matilda, had also journeyed from England to Germany when she, as an eight-​year-​old, was on her way to marry King Henry V in 1110.28 Accompanied by a magnificent company, the future empress brought with her an impressive dowry of 10,000 marks in silver along with 26 “Acta sunt hec Minde anno dominice incarnationis MCLXVIII, indictione I, quando Heinricus dux Bawarie et Saxonie Machtildem filiam regis Anglie ibidem subarravit, kalendis februarii. Data Minde per manum Hartwici Utledensis Bremensis canonici.” MGH DD HL, 111–​13, no. 77. The subarravit (espoused) and the absence of the words uxor (wife) and ducissa could indicate that Henry and Matilda were engaged, but not yet married. If this was the case, the nuptial feast men‐ tioned by Albert of Stade (see note 83) may have been the actual wedding ceremony. 27 “Dux Heinricus repudiata sorore ducis Zaringiae Bertoldi, duxit filiam regis Anglorum, relictam regis Franciae et nuptias Brunswich magnifice celebravit.” Annales Stadenses, ed.

The couple proceeded on to Utrecht for a formal ceremony of betrothal at Easter, and a few weeks later, on July 25, 1110, Matilda was crowned Romanorum regina at Mainz Cathedral. There Archbishop Bruno of Trier was appointed her guardian, and he took her to Trier in order to teach her German and to further educate her.30 In January 1114, Matilda and Henry were married in Mainz; the anonymous so-​called Imperial Chronicle (ca. 1114) provides some details: The nuptials were attended by such a great concourse of archbishops and bishops, dukes and counts, abbots and provosts and learned clergy […]. So numerous were the wedding gifts which various kings and primates sent to the emperor, and the gifts which the emperor from his own store gave to the innumerable throngs of jesters and jongleurs and people of all kinds, that not one of his chamberlains who received or distributed them could count them.31\n\nClearly this wedding feast was filled with elite attendees, who brought wedding gifts for the imperial couple, were entertained lavishly, and perhaps even returned home with luxury objects the emperor had given to them. The Imperial Chronicle makes no references to women who attended the feast, perhaps an indication that the writer was not interested in their presence or that women did not partake in the mentioned celebrations. The festivities were overshadowed by disgruntled territorial princes—​ including bishops—​whose honour was affronted by Henry’s harsh treatment of some of their peers.32 Notwithstanding the historical reality of the day, the event was deemed important enough to be illustrated in the chronicle by a pen-​and-​ink drawing, which 29 The Ecclesiastical History of Orderic Vitalis, vol. 5: books IX and X, ed. and trans.

The crowned couple are flanked by two clerics and served by two cupbearers. This drawing visualizes a key moment in the history of Henry V, a history that was mag‐ nified by incorporating Matilda, who, according to the Imperial Chronicle, “was held to bring glory and honour to both the Roman empire and the English realm.”34 The chron‐ icle also includes a painted miniature depicting the crowned Henry V receiving the orb from Bishop Ruthard of Mainz.35 Both episodes from Henry’s life are narrative scenes, breaking with the tradition of static, enthroned images that represent his royal and imperial predecessors in the same manuscript.36 Even though the visual depiction of this festive matrimonial meal is unique, written descriptions of nuptial celebrations in chron‐ icles appear relatively frequently. In the Chronicle of Frutolf (ca. 1103) the 1044 marriage celebrations of Emperor Henry III and Agnes of Poitou in Ingelheim are commemorated. By contrast with the largesse Henry V displayed towards jesters and jongleurs, here we are told that Henry III “left many performers and jongleurs not only without gifts, but even let them go without food and drink.”37 Franz-​Reiner Erkens has pointed out that Henry III’s behaviour was the result of his religious belief that entertainers disrupted the aura of sacred kinship. By withholding their reward, the emperor promoted himself as a supporter of the church reformers.38 Nonetheless, jesters and jongleurs were part of the festive, political, and public nature of wedding celebrations, and their presence helped to represent and affirm rulership. The public act of a wedding feast would have been the culminating moment of the long journey from England of Matilda and her entourage, serving as an excellent stage for the dual roles of king/​daughter and duke/​consort to be performed through the dis‐ play of material culture. On the occasion of Henry the Lion’s marriage, Helmold of Bosau (writing 1163–​1172) states that the envoys “brought homewards the daughter of the English King together with gold and silver and extensive treasures.”39 Might the writer, who was well-​informed about Henry the Lion, have actually seen the costly goods, or did he simply know of King Henry’s wealth? In the Draco Normannicus (1167–​1169), Helmold’s contemporary Stephen of Rouen—​a monk at Bec Hellouin—​wrote of Matilda’s treasure that “no one was able to count the large amounts of gold and silver.

What and how many royal ornaments of different variety and value the royal princess carried is beyond description.”40 To Stephen, it must have been obvious that King Henry II—​one of the main characters in the Draco—​would bestow on his daughter many precious objects because this reflected positively upon his own rule and showed that he respected his future son-​in-​law, who—​as the chronicler points out—​was the cousin of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Although written only a couple of years after Matilda arrived in Saxony, with the event of the marriage still fresh in memory, the tales told by both Helmold and Stephen describe the precious items in terms of impressive quantities of silver and gold rather than detailing the ornaments in the treasures. Chroniclers referring to the event decades after it had taken place used similar wording, although Ralph Niger distinguishes between vestments and vessels, perhaps reflecting the common liturgical division between the two.41 Despite the topoi in these descriptions, their insistence on Henry II’s wealth bestowed upon the ducal couple in terms of the movement of gold, silver, treasure, ornament, vestments, and vessels demonstrates a clear representational understanding of such things. At the same time, the active potential of these riches surfaces if we interpret their mobility not merely in terms of wealth going from England to Saxony, but as transmitters of status, stories, and connections.\n\nEntering Palermo Resplendent with Regal Garments\n\nThat artefacts were made to work with and for people becomes even more evident when turning to Matilda’s sister Joanna. Negotiations for Joanna to marry King William II of Sicily were carried out during the summer of 1176. The planning for this marriage involved the coming and going of ambassadors, and with them gifts must have been brought back and forth. The reliquary pendant of Queen Margaret of Sicily (d. 1183), mother of William II, serves as an example of such gift-​giving (Figure 4a–​b). Queen and bishop are depicted on the back of the small gold pendant, with Margaret holding out her hands as if to receive the precious object from Reginald, who raises his right hand to bless her. They can safely be identified by the inscription around the border: ISTUD REGINE MARGARETE SICULOR[UM] TRA[N]‌SMITTIT PRESUL RAINAUD[US] BATONIOR[UM] (That [which] was transmitted to Queen Margaret of Sicily by Bishop Reginald of Bath).42 The text running along the edge on the front reveals that it once held parts of Thomas\n\n40 “Cum quantis opibus dicere nullus habet. /​ Aurum quis numeret, argenti copia quanta, /​ Vasorum species mens memorare nequit. /​Quam varii generis, pretii, quot regia virgo /​Ornamenta tulit, scribere nemo valet.” (v. 199–​204).
