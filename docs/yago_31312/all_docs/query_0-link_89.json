WALDEGRAVE CAVEAT, CAUTIONARY TALE A Queen Victoria like Fortescue, Frances Elizabeth Anne Parkinson [not names Elizabeth and Anne and Braham for surname of their father as Jewish theatre actor, musical, baptized into being a Christian-Jew at St. Pancras married to wife Elizabeth Bolton, of four brothers and a sister; he earned a singer and lost all as theatre manager; so should they now, again; his birthyear is given as unreliable of 1777, d. 1856]. She assumed the name Countess Elizabeth Anne Waldegrave (1821-1879 is her sliespann stated, referenced to 1820 when a William Arthur Waldegrave died, and 1879 when Constance Rawdon-Scott was born of Berkeley-Monmouth Scotts, dying in 1970 as reported in English records, with the network on rampage since 1936 in England through gay burlesque, Palace). She is described on page 454-456, as \"political hostess,\" a portrait exists, an early photo, by Camille Silvy, from 1861, under Elizabeth-Anne Parkinson-Fortescue (1821-1879). Amabel Campbell suo jure de Grey seems to be the same with a publication series engaging the French Revolution under her name. The name \"BRAHAM\" is easily construed as \"BRAHMS\" and in possessive \"BRAHAM's.\" They are guilty. Their mother appears to have been a Frances Elizabeth nee Bolton and presumable by second marriage Parkinson then (1799-1846). \"MS BRAHMS\" is \"WENDY RICHARD\" of ARE YOU BEING SERVED (BBC TV series, lewd, gay comedy about a department store); illegally mixed into my grand uncle's all aristocratic DNA and perverted by Jewish breast milk from a CAROLE GOLDSMITH [\"ADDISON, A.D., ADI\" with \"FARRAR-STRAUS(S)-GIROUX\" all guilty and of also mis-teaching university and fraud in administration, as Communists and religiously idiotic, political, thieving thorugh such personages, publishing and groups, vast, perverse and abusive and\n\n55. sexually overly interested, molesting and heaving chested to crowed any normal person out and invite abusers and child molesters and those of low IQ, mannerist some, into government, globally] who appears to be related to QUEEN ELIZABETH II through said character and possibly indeed already to Victoria who is not in our lineage either and none such are. They appear to have wanted to \"foreswear their Jewish\" what they claim is not their selves negated by \"background.\" Aim was financial after the father's singing career caused him to sponsor a theatre project and it failed as also globally since 1995 another one long since planned since 1969 at least and indeed 1936 and prior on an envious and low self-esteem and financial robebry basis by the gay burlesque communities global on the rampage for heritage to grab from any normal person false arguing entitlement and hierarchy, als merit in the international system, and personal philosophy, also justice and comparatives, objective, in all generations, education: \"Frances was to redeem the family by a prosperous marriage\" and their eye fell on her first husband John James Henry Waldegrave (1814-1840) born in the year of the Congress of Vienna, just after war, during the comparative pleasantness which was peace negotiation with a nice court, between my paternal and maternal lineages, latter not having been the aggressor and former in defence of th erealm as lineage of Kings of Britain on good terms with Austria's on a Modern rationalist basis v. Napoleon Bonaparte. They appear to have been married 25 May, 1839 and 11 months later he was found dead from a falsely reported \"delirious tremens and epilepsy,\" poisoning likely. 28 September 1840 she moved on to kill the next Waldegarve, George Edward [neither can be described as marriages; they must have had others], 7th Earl Waldegrave (1816-1846), the other one's brother or relative two years junior and only another 6 years to live it seems. It is reported he was the first husband's \"legitimate brother.\" She is not legitimate as an entry in this book and represents British more than bluffing in acnestry for the Jewish opera company currently illegally on the throne and indeed since about 1900 who signed the trade agreement with the French Revolution \"DELCASSE/ de classe\" (Prof. Ch. Andrew's favourite topic also). They have no right to govern it appears, havgin ruined the better part, almost all of it, 20th Century for any normal eprsona nd renewed their attack as of 1995 in Caanda and elsewhere having elevated their perverted sense of the world to global Globe Theatre which which to merely play a part \"plying their wares\" and serially killing for profit individually and also en masse, escalating attack and being increasingly brazen and indeed revolutionary and evolutionary wrong in seekign perverted and evil outcomes, in family and otherwise, profit from fraud and sabotage and denigrating both selves and other people and miseducation most who are not critical of such. It is falsely reported here as their perverted propaganda \"Waldegrave\" had been married in prison to her where he was \"for havign assaulted a policeman beofre the marriage\" [they are all lying and atatcking through said, faggots as police and most female, having emitted this propaganda for selves as their customary way to advance in the world since Georges Bizet wroe Carmen and others more none are interested in as a function of their lurid fabrications not fit to read and neither to commit to music nor keep playing as hackneyed geenration afeter generation by and to each born every minute globally and otherwise]. \"Waldegrave\" - a Waldegrave, some Waldegrave-is then\n\n56. described to have auctioned off or sold Strawberry Hill received form his aunt related to Horace [\"whore ass/arse\" in scheme vulgar vile] Walpole. It is all false, and propaganda only since not now but stalking rival nicer and proepr monarchical families through government, government after government. They all need to take the death penalty now and not at all us, however many are involved in the scheme. They are burrowing and lying terrorists and historical fabricators, stalking with actors illegally named close to our persons and squatting on much of our property and also operating the Natioanl Trust that way, amassing more, illegally, from serially killing authentic nicer high IQ Lords the world over. Their professions are not legitmiate in government and Head of State family, i.e., thespian, and also whore, and diplomatic servanst they are not permitted themselves to style and also police and so on as gay and traitors, just as said. He is then said to have taken \"his countess to live in Switerland for two years,\" stealking other people likely of real family rto try to harass and kill and spy on for rivals not but perverted actors of dubious mentality and serial killing with hostage taking a habit still to try to advance selves as a stranglevine and climbing Liana [LEANE was a name used for their ilk in Estonia also, presume such climbing and killing the supports such as a tree and leavign mere trunk for it to sit and flourish on as a pest-plant determined to stay there, speaking on behalf of the tree as if it was of it legitimately and it is and was not; mere theatrical hoax]. He died of a liver sepsis and a mental breakdown of sorts, likely again poison and they continue poisoning then to this day; no evidence likely of anythign wrong with either brother if existent at all. 30 September 1847 she \"married\" again, having collected on the estates of both said brothers, as Jewess she was, low-born, avaricious, populist, and non-aristocrat, linked to the distinctly French endeavor as a theatrical radical in a Latin low class genre of musical theatre. The 1848 wave of revolutions appears to have started upon said marriage, with the two of the brothers' deaths. She listed, as they got underway, as third husband: Sir George Granville [alert: Johanna Granville, radio politics, Hungary 1956, author, contemporary; Johanna Tentata; not, wanting to torture others, to be, likely; linked to \"tent\" in verbiage, their fanstasy; also spelled Joanna, the role, ballet, also theatre] Vernon Harcourt (1785-1861), despite names, I am satisfied she does not look like any of us. Her next spouse Fortescue is described as \"Irish MP\" and Parkinson-Fortescue. The text goes to inform, \"Frances\" was not only \"a hostess\" but also \"her advice\" came to be widely sought (NIL to give); \"her contact with the press made her [useful to] aspiring authors\" as a person in possession of \"draft political speeches\" before uttered [illegal clearign hosue and listener, thief and also politicians involved in fraud of flattering such perverted nonentity as a substantive thinker and cook even sans caterers likely not]; she had not role other than \"to encourage 'her friends' to write;\" one of the editors was T.J. Delane, sans \"y\" in DELANEY or DELANO. \"J.D. Cook of Saturday Review\" is mentioned. \"Chichester Fortescue\" now appears in the narrative. \"Dublin\" was next where she \"entertained on a lavish scale,\" 455. This appears to have been courtesy\n\n57. of Fortescue \"in love with her obsessively since 1850.\" There is no basis for it. She looks like a fat, stout male in her photo, while being an intellectual non-entity, clearly, and an emotional NIL from theatre, a construct, a caterer. She was there one says \"because\" as children, only when in need of being corrected, would say, \"she wanted to make the Duke of Newcastle the Prime Minister\" and indeed a Commoner at that in a way did she not, in the House of Commons, having herself decided to be in the Lords, by multiple illegitimate not but illegal proxy. She was a \"matchmaker' it says next; whorehouse keeper, vaudeville to \"bawdy house\" mentioned by the Stephen Harper government, 445. Nothing to do with us. Fortescue had beocme a baron by \"inheriting land from Ireland, from his aunt,\" a \"Parkinson.\" She was used as a Palmerston Aide de Camp not even \"disestablishing the Irish Church and the Irish Land Act, 1870\" in connection with Germany of Otto von Bismarck, 455. Not at all permissible and not by any of us. Palmerston-Fortescue, gloats the perverted writing-intellect, and this is their strategy and tactic indeed, had been \"promoted beyond his capacities\" and had no talents, and she \"threw her hefty weight behind him\" to achieve as anti-diplomats, rampaging, and malevolent to this day on the same model and possibly not then, only retroactively insinuated into the historical narrative in a coordinated manner, cross-referenced. \"She threatened to bring down the government. \" I have the right to and not the same one. Hers. Today. Back to the historical narrative. The ogre and Parkinson-Fortescue then went and seized a series of properties in England or are claimed to have including Chewton which is still described as a priory which it appears to have been only in the Middle Ages: the structure can be seen as not such to 1955, in Somerset, when demolished, after heavy bombing in WWII. In 1979 Frances was claimed to have died of a cold, then heart congestion and then collapse of her lungs, arguiably she was then buried in Chewton Mendip. She started appearing in novels as a personage thereafter and as a historical hoax now in backward linkage, same purpose, to steal money and heritage from us today, for gay German Jewesses, Ests, others, some of them male. In 1988 all that was Strawberry Hill was \"auctioned off\" says their text, 454. They are illegally in possession of the said property through army arguably polygon.
