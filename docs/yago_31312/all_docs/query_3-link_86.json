        "text": "1 The crown of Rudolf II.\n\nThis crown is a masterpiece of European goldsmithing. Since the crown of the Holy Roman Empire (Room 11) was only used for coronations. Thus later rulers required a private crown for other public appearances. The crown of Emperor Rudolf II. (1552–1612) is the only one of these private crowns that survived. Under the reign of Emperor Francis II./I. (1768-1835) the crown was designated as the crown of the Austrian Empire.\n\n2 Mantle of the Austrian Emperor\n\nThe mantle with train is made of red velvet and studded with a pattern of golden-threaded embroidery. It consists of double eagles holding a sword an imperial orb in their talons and bearing the Crown of Rudolf II on their heads. Given the fact that Austria did not have its fires emperor until 1804, it was necessary to create such vestments from scratch.\n\n3 Mantle of the Coronation Vestments of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia\n\nFollowing Napoleon’s defeat and abdication, Europe was reorganised at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The northern Italian provinces that had fallen to Austria were combined into the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia. Therefore Emperor Franz Joseph also bore the title King of Lombardy and Venice.\n\n4 Christening Set, donated by Maria Theresa\n\nAt court, christenings were not a family affair but a festive act of state to introduce the newborn child into public life. This Chistening Set was also used for the baptisms of the children of the imperial couple Franz Joseph and Elisabeth.\n\n5 Hungarian Opal Jewellery\n\nPrincess Stéphanie of Belgium received this matched set of jewellery as a gift from the city of Budapest on the occasion of her marriage to Crown Prince Rudolph on 10 May 1881. The extremely colourful ensemble consists of a belt, necklace, ear-pendants, two bracelets, five hairpins and then bodice clasps.\n\n6 Four pieces of jewellery from the possession of Empress Elisabeth of Austria\n\nThe last pieces of Empress Elisabeth's jewellery open to the public are on display in the Imperial Treasury. The four brooches bear witness to the splendour of the empress's public appearance.\n\n7 Monstrance of the Order of the Starry Cross\n\nAccording to tradition, the monstrance with the precious particle of the Holy Cross was recovered after a devastating fire in the Vienna Hofburg Palace. Miraculously the wood of the Holy Cross was undamaged. In gratitude, the Order of the Starry Cross was founded, the highest order of ladies in the House of Austria, which still exists today. The head and patroness was always the Empress.\n\n8 Cabinet for the Keys to the Coffins of the Habsburgs\n\nThe key to Empress Elisabeth's coffin in the Capuchin Crypt is also kept in this cabinet. The black hearse, built for the funeral processions of reigning members, can be found in the Imperial Carriage Museum. It was used for the funerals of Crown Prince Rudolf (1889), Empress Elisabeth (1898) and Emperor Franz Joseph I (1916), among others."
