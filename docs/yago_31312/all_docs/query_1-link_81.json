For example, her mother’s sister was Hedwig of Andechs, the wife of Duke Heinrich I of Silesia. Other notable figures in her line of ancestry included Vladimir the Great of Kievan Rus.\n\nShe lived in the castle of Posonium until the age of four. Soon after her fourth birthday, Saint Elizabeth of Hungary was brought to the court of the rulers of Thuringia in central Germany. It was here that she was betrothed to Louis IV of Thuringia. This union was done to create political alliances.\n\nFrom that day on, Saint Elizabeth of Hungary was raised by the court of Thuringia. At the age of fourteen, in 1221, she married Louis. They were happily in love.\n\nSaint Elizabeth’s Turn to the Church\n\nIn 1223, the Franciscan friars visited Saint Elizabeth of Hungary. During their visit, she learned of the ideals of Francis of Assisi. She also started to live by these ideals, and Louis seemed not to be opposed to this.\n\nDuring this time, the priest and later inquisitor Konrad van Marburg gained influence over Elizabeth. As a result of this, he became Elizabeth’s confidant. In 1226, great floods and natural disasters began to plague Thuringia. As a result of the floods, Louis represented Frederick II at the Imperial Diet held in Cremora.\n\nAs Louis was absent at home, control of the home was given to Saint Elizabeth. It was here that her charitable work was more noticed by the public. She distributed alms to all parts of their territory and gave away state robes to the poor as well as state ornaments.\n\n11 September 1227, the day that Saint Elizabeth’s beloved died in Italy The loss of her beloved absolutely devastated her. Furthermore, there were also several bitter arguments over the dowry owed to Saint Elizabeth after the passing of her beloved. As a result of this, she moved from the court at Wartburg to Marburg, Hesse.\n\nFollowing the death of her beloved, Saint Elizabeth made solemn vows to Konrad. These vows were like those of a nun and included celibacy and complete obedience to Konrad as her confessor and spiritual dictator. This proved to be a mistake on the part of Elizabeth. Why?\n\nThis is because Konrad’s treatment of Elizabeth was harsh, with several punishments involving physical beatings and sending away her three children. Saint Elizabeth was also held somewhat hostage in Pottenstein, the castle of her uncle. This was because this was a vow to get Elizabeth to remarry. Against this, she threatened to cut off her own nose so nobody would find her attractive enough to marry.\n\nAs part of her charitable work, which she held so dear, she continued throughout this time to carry it out. Saint Elizabeth also built a hospital at Marburg. This hospital was for the poor and sick. She used the money from her dowry to build the hospital and stayed there with her companions to look after patients that needed care.\n\nThe Death and Canonization of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary\n\nAt the ripe young age of 24, in 1231, Saint Elizabeth of Hungary passed away in Marburg. She was canonized on May 24, 1235, by Pope Gregory IX in Italy. Her body was laid to rest in a golden shrine, which can still be seen today in Marburg.\n\n5 Interesting Facts About St. Elizabeth of Hungary\n\nSaint Elizabeth’s shrine was the absolute center of German\n\npilgrimages during the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\nA church was built in her name, called the Elizabethkirche. It is\n\nmainly a Protestant church but has spaces for Catholic worship.\n\nAfter her death, the Teutonic Order adopted Saint Elizabeth as\n\ntheir secondary patroness.\n\nSaint Elizabeth of Hungary is remembered by the Church of England.\n\nwith her feast day celebrated on November 18.\n\nAfter her death, it was reported that miracles happened at her\n\ngrave and at the hospital she built.\n\nPrayer to St. Elizabeth of Hungary\n\nDear Saint Elizabeth, you were always poor in spirit, most generous toward the poor, faithful to your husband, and fully consecrated to your Divine Bridegroom. Grant your help to widows and widowers and keep them faithful to their heavenly Lord. Teach them to make use of their time in the service of God, our Lord. Amen."
