        "text": "She’s the subject of hit Netflix series The Empress, which was renewed for a second season last autumn, and two new films: Sisi & I, due later this spring, and IFC Films’ Corsage (now in theatres), which stars Vicky Krieps (Phantom Thread) and was shortlisted for the best international feature film Oscar.\n\nWho was she? And why is she everywhere? We talk to Krieps and Hadley Meares, a historical journalist, to find out more about the reluctant royal.\n\nWho was Empress Elisabeth of Austria?\n\nElisabeth, nicknamed Sisi, was just 16 when she was married, against her will, to Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria in 1854. Beloved for her compassion toward the sick and poor, she also fought for the rights of the people of Hungary, which was part of her husband’s empire.\n\nBut privately, Sisi struggled with mental illness as well as grief following the deaths of her son and sister. She was assassinated by an Italian anarchist in 1898 at age 60, after 44 years on the throne.\n\nEven then, “I could feel there was something much darker and more melancholy behind what I was reading,” Krieps says. “My parents raised me so freely, and then the minute you go to school, people tell you what not to do and how to behave. This painful experience of society trying to fit you into something connected me to her pain.”\n\nHow were Sisi and Princess Diana alike?\n\nAnd like Diana, who was killed in a car accident in 1997 at 36, Sisi was known for her great beauty.\n\n“She was one of the first real modern celebrities,” Meares says. “Her very long hair, her tiny waist … her fashions were all copied in books and magazines for women, and were all breathlessly reported in newspapers.”\n\n“Sisi is such a good example of somebody who not only was trapped by those conventions of beauty, but also internalised them,” Meares says. “She’s really an interesting person when you think about the gender dynamics that we’re still grappling with to this day, and how much damage patriarchy and misogyny and the male gaze has done to women over the centuries.”\n\nWhy is she having a pop culture moment right now?\n\nMost famously, actress Romy Schneider starred as a young empress in the Sissi film trilogy in the late 1950s, before playing her again in 1973’s Ludwig.\n\nIn the latter, “she portrayed a much more realistic version of Sisi”, Meares says. “She finally got to play her not only as this charming nymph, but more as who she really was: a deeply troubled woman who wrote beautiful poetry and had real ideals and was forever wandering this Earth searching for something she could never really find. Sisi got an anchor tattooed on her arm when she was 51, which was unheard of for any ‘proper’ woman of the time.”\n\nSisi was perfectly imperfect, Krieps says, which is why she continues to captivate and inspire."
