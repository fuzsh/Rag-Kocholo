HERZOGE von POMMERELLEN [POMORZE]48\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Pomeranians emerged in the 9th century as one of the important Slavic tribes in the area of the future state of Poland . They were based in the north around the cities of Wolin, Kamien, Szczecin, Stargard, Pyrzyce, Bialogard and Kolobrzeg. These new city states were economically more advanced than the rest of Poland, although heavily dependant on maritime trade . They strongly resisted the influence of the Piast dynasty of the Polanian state, but did not at that time develop their own central dynastic leadership . Dzięcioł suggests that \"the Slavs\", led by the Saxon count Wichmann who was related to Hermann Billung dux in Saxony and whose victories over Mieszko I Prince of Poland in 963 were recorded by the chronicler Widukind of Corvey, may have been western Pomeranians .\n\nThese western Pomeranians were defeated in 967 by the Poles, in alliance with Boleslav I Duke of Bohemia, when Wichmann was killed in battle . This opened a period of increased Polish influence in Pomerania. The Pomeranians had an organised pagan religion with priests and temples. After the establishment of the archbishopric of Gniezno in 1000, the bishopric of Kolobrzeg [Kolberg] was founded in Pomerania as part of the new Polish ecclesiastical organisation, with Reinbern as its first bishop. The western Pomeranians liberated themselves from Piast influence in [1013] during the Polish-German war and the bishopric was abandoned. The Pomeranians were finally forced to abandon paganism by the Poles in the early 12th century .\n\nThe earliest references to princes in Pomerania date from the mid-11th century. At that time, two distinct families of rulers can be identified, the descendants of Wartislaw [I], who later became dukes of Pomerania (see Chapter 1.A), and the so-called Swantiboriez/Swantiboren family who descended from another Wartislaw, son of Swantibor, who were recorded as castellans of Szczecin and Gützkow in the early 13th century but who died out in the male line before the end of the same century (see Chapter 2). There are indications that the two families had a common ancestry, as shown in Chapter 1.A, but this has not been confirmed beyond all doubt.\n\nThe creation of the duchy of Pomerania was confirmed by Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa in 1181 in favour of Duke Bogislaw I (see Chapter 1.B). The development of a distinct political identity in Pomerania was encouraged by its geographic separation from the kingdom of Poland which resulted from Brandenburg's expansion to the east in the 13th century, as well as the increasing German influence over the territory which followed. The territory of the Pomeranian duchy was split between the two sons of Duke Barnim I on his death in 1278. Barnim´s older son Bogislaw ruled the area to the west known as Vorpommern, with his capital at Wolgast on the Baltic coast on the left bank of the Oder estuary. This area is today part of the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Barnim´s younger son Otto ruled Hinterpommern to the east, which forms the north-west coastal area of the republic of Poland in the present day. Otto´s capital was at Stettin (Szczecin) on the left bank of the river Oder, to the south-east of Wolgast. The duchy of Pomerania-Stettin (see Chapter 1.C) existed as a separate entity until 1464 when it was inherited by the dukes of Pomerania-Wolgast. Pomerania survived as an independent duchy until 1637. It was occupied by Sweden during the Thirty Years War and finally incorporated into the kingdom of Prussia after the Napoleonic wars.\n\nThe island of Rügen in the Baltic Sea to the north of Wolgast is recorded as a separate principality from the late 12th century (see Chapter 3). The princes of Rügen were suzerains of the kings of Denmark. The last independent prince of Rügen died in 1325, when his territory was incorporated into the duchy of Pomerania-Wolgast.\n\nThe separate state of Pommerellen (Pomorze in Polish) developed in the 13th century to the east of Hinterpommern, in the northeastern coastal area of present-day Poland (see Chapter 4). It should be noted that all 13th century charters which are quoted in this document refer to the dukes of Pommerellen/Pomorze as \"dux Pomeranorum\" (or variants) or \"princeps in Dansk\", while the dukes of Pomerania are mostly referred to in the same documents as \"dux Slavorum\". The last independent prince of Pommerellen bequeathed his principality to one of the Polish princes of the Piast dynasty in 1294. This was challenged by the Markgrafen of Brandenburg, who were granted Pomorze as a fief in 1306 by Václav II [Wenzel] King of Bohemia who also claimed the Polish throne. The Poles repelled the Askanian invasion of Gdansk in 1308 with the help of the Teutonic Knights, but the latter subsequently refused to leave the area .\n\nThe reconstruction of the families of the dukes of Pomerania, princes of Rügen and princes of Pomorze in this document is based in part on the genealogies published in Europäische Stammtafeln . Primary sources which confirm the relationships have not yet been identified to justify the relationships of these families after the 14th century. The family of the later dukes of Pomerania has been included in this document for the sake of completeness, even though they fall outside the main chronological scope of Medieval Lands. The decision has been taken to use the German, rather than Polish, forms for the names of the members of the Pomeranian dynasties in the present document because of the dominant German influence in the area in medieval times.\n\nChapter 1. DUKES of POMERANIA\n\nA. ORIGINS\n\n[Three] brothers, parents not identified:\n\n1. WARTISLAW [I] (-killed Stolp [1135/36]) . A charter dated 3 May 1153, under which Adalbert Bishop of Pomerania confirmed the foundation of Kloster Stolp, states that the site was where \"principe Wartizlauo\" had been killed and that \"Ratiboro tunc nostre principe\" founded the Kloster .\n\n- see below, Part B.\n\n2. RATIBOR [I] (-1155 or 7 May 1156) . His relationship with Wartislaw [I] is confirmed by the charter dated 18 Apr 1177 under which \"Boguslaus Pomeranorum Dux\" donated property to the church of Havelberg, with the consent of \"fratre nostro Boguzlao\", by charter dated 18 Apr 1177, which names \"patruus noster Ratiborus consorte sua Pribislaua frater noster Kazimerus\" , read together with Helmold who records that \"Kazemarus et Bugezlavus, duces Pomeranorum\" founded Kloster Stolp in memory of \"patris sui Wertizlavi\" . Adalbert Bishop of Pomerania confirmed the donations to Kloster Grobe made by \"domnus Ratiboro cum coniuge sua Pribizlawa\" by charter dated 8 Jun 1159 . Konrad Bishop of Pomerania confirmed the possessions of Kloster Grobe, including donations by \"dominus Ratiboro cum consorte sua Pribizlaua successores eius Bogozlauus et Cazimerus\", by charter dated 1168 . \"Boguslaus Pomeranorum Dux\" donated property to the church of Havelberg, with the consent of \"fratre nostro Boguzlao\", by charter dated 18 Apr 1177, which names \"patruus noster Ratiborus consorte sua Pribislaua frater noster Kazimerus\" . m ([1136]) PRIBISLAVA [Iaroslavna, daughter of IAROSLAV Sviatopolkovich Prince of Vladimir & his third wife --- Mstislavna of Kiev] (-[1156]). Baumgarten names the wife of Ratibor and states her origin but cites only another of his works as the one secondary source in support . Adalbert Bishop of Pomerania confirmed the donations to Kloster Grobe made by \"domnus Ratiboro cum coniuge sua Pribizlawa\" by charter dated 8 Jun 1159 . Konrad Bishop of Pomerania confirmed the possessions of Kloster Grobe, including donations by \"dominus Ratiboro cum consorte sua Pribizlaua successors eius Bogozlauus et Cazimerus\", by charter dated 1168 . \"Boguslaus Pomeranorum Dux\" donated property to the church of Havelberg, with the consent of \"fratre nostro Boguzlao\", by charter dated 18 Apr 1177, which names \"patruus noster Ratiborus consorte sua Pribislaua frater noster Kazimerus\" . Ratibor & his wife had [three] children:\n\na) SWANTOPOLK (-after 20 Jan 1205). \"Kasimerus Pomoranorum princeps filius Wartizlai\" donated property to Kloster Grobe by charter dated 13 Nov 1175, witnessed by \" Szenthepolc filius ducis Ratheburni\" . Duke of Pomerania. \"Swentopelcus dux Pomeranie\" decreed that \"castellania Slupensis\" {Stolp} \"seniori Wladislao duce Polonie dominante\", which he had captured from \"rex Dacie Waldmarus\", should fall within the archdiocesis of Gnesen by charter dated 27 Dec 1180 . \"Swantepoltus dux tocie Pomeranie\" donated \"Ziraua et Zukow\" to the bishop of Camin by charter dated 20 Jan 1205, witnessed by \"dominus Barnym dux Stettinensis, Mestuwinus primogenitus, comes Dubegnewa\" .\n\nb) [BOGISLAW [Boleslaw] . Pope Gregory IX confirmed donations to the Knights Hospitallers of Jerusalem in Moravia of property \"de Salwo in Colber Gostina et Meslino domos\" made by \"clare memorie Ratiborius princeps Pomoranie ac Boleslaus filius eius\" witnessed the charter dated 1235 under which \"Barnym dux Pomeranorum\" by bull dated 20 Mar 1237 . It is not certain that this document relates to Ratibor [I], as it would be somewhat surprising that the document refers to the donation by someone who died nearly 100 years earlier. It is therefore possible that another, otherwise unrecorded Pomeranian prince named Ratibor, is indicated. Whatever the identity of \"Ratiborius\", it is likely that \"Boleslaus\" was an error for Bogislaw. Yet another possibility is that the document was intended to refer to Ratibor [I] and his nephew Duke Bogislaw I.]\n\nc) MARGARETA . Arnold's Chronica Slavorum names \"Margaretam filiam Ratibor principis Pomeranorum\" as wife of \"Bernardum\" . [1162]. m (before 1162) BERNHARD [I] Graf von Ratzeburg, son of HEINRICH von Badewide Graf von Ratzeburg & his wife --- [of Denmark] (-[1190]).\n\n3. [SWANTIBOR . The parentage of Swantibor is not known. However, a charter dated 1244 of \"Barnym dux Pomeranorum\" confirmed a donation to Kloster Colbaz made by \"agnatus noster dominus Zuantoborus filius Kazemeri\" (who was the great-grandson of Swantibor) . Assuming that \"agnatus\" was used in this document in its strict sense of relative on the paternal side of the family, Swantibor may have been another brother of Wartislaw [I] and Ratibor [I]. No document has yet been found which names Swantibor in his personal capacity other than as father of Wartislaw.] m ---. The name of Swantibor´s wife is not known. Swantibor & his wife had [two] children:\n\na) WARTISLAW (-1196) . The Annales Colbazienses record the death in 1196 of \"Wartizlaus filius Svantobori\" .\n\n- see Chapter 2.\n\nb) [WALBURGIS (-before 18 Apr 1172) . \"Boguslaus Pomeranorum dux\" donated property to Kloster Grobe, for the soul of \"coniugis nostre Walburgis\", by charter dated 18 Apr 1177 . It is possible that Duke Bogislaw´s first wife was the sister of Wartislaw, as shown by the charter dated 1173 under which \"Buguzlaus Pomeranorum dux\" granted protection to Kloster Colbaz, founded by \"cognato nostro Wartizlao\" , the term \"cognatus\" frequently (although not exclusively) indicating brother-in-law. If this hypothesis is correct, Walburgis may have been her husband´s first cousin, daughter of his possible paternal uncle Swantibor. On the other hand, the editors of the Codex Pomeraniæ Diplomaticus suggest that Walburgis was \"wahrscheinlich eine dänische Prinzessin\", citing Suhm´s Historie af Danmark which states that \"Walborg\" was the sister of Valdemar I King of Denmark but does not cite the primary source on which this statement is based . m as his first wife, [her first cousin] BOGISLAW I Duke of Pomerania, son of WARTISLAW [I] & his wife --- ([1130]-18 Mar 1187).]\n\nB. DUKES of POMERANIA 1181-1278\n\nWARTISLAW [I], son of --- (-killed Stolp [1135/36]) . According to Saxo Grammaticus, Wartislaw \"waged continual hostilities with the Danes and the Poles\". In [1127/29], Niels King of Denmark counter-attacked against the fort of Uznam and subsequently Wolin. Wartislaw was made prisoner after boarding a Danish ship to negotiate peace but freed after the intervention of Knud \"Lavard\" of Denmark . A charter dated 3 May 1153, under which Adalbert Bishop of Pomerania confirmed the foundation of Kloster Stolp, states that the site was where \"principe Wartizlauo\" had been killed and that \"Ratiboro tunc nostre principe\" founded the Kloster .\n\nm ---. The name of Wartislaw's wife is not known.\n\nWartislaw & his wife had [three] children:\n\n1. BOGISLAW ([1130]-18 Mar 1187) . \"Cazimerus Pomeranorum princeps\" donated property to the church of Havelberg, with the consent of \"fratre nostro Boguzlao\", by charter dated 16 Aug 1170 . Helmold names \"Kazemarus et Bugezlavus, duces Pomeranorum\" when recording their part in the rebellion of the Obotrites against Heinrich \"der Löwe\" Duke of Saxony in 1164, recording in a later passage that they converted to Christianity, founded a monastery at Stolp in memory of \"patris sui Wertizlavi\", and founded \"episcopatum Uznam\" . Valdemar I King of Denmark occupied Wolgast and imposed Danish suzerainty in 1164 . BOGISLAW I Duke of Pomerania. \"Buguzlaus Pomeranorum dux\" granted protection to Kloster Colbaz, founded by \"cognato nostro Wartizlao\", by charter dated 1173 . \"Kasimerus Pomoranorum princeps filius Wartizlai\" donated property to Kloster Grobe by charter dated 13 Nov 1175, witnessed by \"dominus Bochzlaus dux Pomeranie \" . \"Boguslaus Pomeranorum Dux\" donated property to the church of Havelberg, with the consent of \"fratre nostro Boguzlao\", by charter dated 18 Apr 1177, which names \"patruus noster Ratiborus consorte sua Pribislaua frater noster Kazimerus\" . Emperor Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\" invested him with the duchy of Pomerania at Lübeck in 1181, to guarantee his loyalty against Heinrich \"der Löwe\" ex-Duke of Saxony . Knud VI King of Denmark compelled Duke Bogislaw to become his vassal in 1185 . The Annales Colbazienses record the death \"1187 XVI Kal Apr\" of \"Boguzlaus dux\" . m firstly ([1150/59]) [his first cousin,] WALBURGIS, daughter of [SWANTIBOR & his wife ---] (-before 18 Apr 1172). \"Boguslaus Pomeranorum dux\" donated property to Kloster Grobe, for the soul of \"coniugis nostre Walburgis\", by charter dated 18 Apr 1177 . It is possible that she was the sister of Wartislaw, as shown by the charter dated 1173 under which \"Buguzlaus Pomeranorum dux\" granted protection to Kloster Colbaz, founded by \"cognato nostro Wartizlao\" , the term \"cognatus\" frequently (although not exclusively) indicating brother-in-law. If this hypothesis is correct, Walburgis may have been her husband´s first cousin, daughter of his possible paternal uncle Swantibor. The editors of the Codex Pomeraniæ Diplomaticus suggest that Walburgis was \"wahrscheinlich eine dänische Prinzessin\", citing Suhm´s Historie af Danmark which states that \"Walborg\" was the sister of Valdemar I King of Denmark but does not cite the primary source on which this statement is based . m secondly (26 Apr 1177) ANASTASIA of Poland, daughter of MIESZKO III \"Stary/the Old\" Prince of Greater Poland & his second wife Ievdokia Iziaslavna of Kiev (before 1164-after 31 May 1240). The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum refers to, but does not name, the daughters of Mieszko III, naming (fourth in the list) \"dux Maritime Boguslaus\" as his son-in-law . \"Anastasia mariti viduata consortio cum filio ipsius et meo Boguzlavo\" confirmed a donation to Kloster Grobe by charter dated 18 Mar 1188, witnessed by \"Wartizlauus Szvantiboris, Odolanus filius Kazimari \" . \"Buguzlaus et frater noster Kazimarus Pomeranorum principes cum matre nostra Anastasia\" donated property at Treptow to St Maria by charter dated 1208, witnessed by \" Conradus prepositus et Bartolomeus et Kazimarus fratres \" . \"Anastasia ducissa Pomeranorum\" donated property to Kloster Belbog, with the consent of \"dominarum relicte filii mei Bugzlai et alterius filii Kazemari relicte\" by charter dated 7 Jul 1224 witnessed by \" Barnota filius domini Jaromiri de Ruia \" . Bogislaw I & his first wife had [four] children:\n\na) RATIBOR ([1160]-14/15 Jan 1183, bur Stolp) . \"Boguzlaus Pomeranorum Dux\" confirmed a donation of property to the church of Havelberg by \"beate memorie Cazimerus frater meus\", with the consent of \"filiis nostris Ratiburone et Wartizlao\", by charter dated 1182 . The Annales Colbazienses record the death \"1183 Kal Feb\" of \"Ratibor filius Boguzlai\" . \"Boguzlauus Dux Pomeranorum\" donated property to Kloster Stolp, on the intervention of \"cognato nostro Wartizlauo\", for the soul of \"Ratibori filii nostri qui ibidem sepultus est\", by charter dated to 1183, signed by \"Suantoboiz Wartizlauus \" . m (before 1177) SALOMEA of Poland, daughter of MIESZKO III \"Stary/the Old\" Prince of Greater Poland & his second wife Ievdokia Iziaslavna of Kiev (-11 May ----). The primary source which confirms her parentage and marriage has not yet been identified.\n\nb) WARTISLAW (after 1160-18 Feb 1184, bur Klosterberg). \"Boguzlaus Pomeranorum Dux\" confirmed a donation of property to the church of Havelberg by \"beate memorie Cazimerus frater meus\", with the consent of \"filiis nostris Ratiburone et Wartizlao\", by charter dated 1182 . \"Boguzlauus Dux Pomeranorum\" donated property to Kloster Grobe to found a new monastery \"ad montem sancte Marie in quo filium nostrum Wartizlawm sepulture voluimus iam quatriduam defuncti\" by charter dated 20 Feb 1184 .\n\nc) [daughter . It is possible that the wife of Jaromar [I] von Rügen was the daughter of Bogislaw I Duke of Pomerania & his wife ---. This is suggested by the charter dated 4 Aug 1218 under which \"Bogesclauus Pomeranorum dux\" confirmed donations to Kloster Ilda made by \"quondam dominus Jaromerus Rujanorum princeps cognatus noster\" , the term \"cognatus\" frequently (although not exclusively) indicating brother-in-law. If this parentage is corrected, the chronology suggests that Jaromar´s wife must have been born from her father´s first marriage. m JAROMAR [I] Fürst von Rügen, son of RATZE & his wife --- (-[1217/4 Aug 1218]).]\n\nd) daughter ([1162/72]-) . The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum refers to \"dux Pomeranie\" as the father-in-law of one of his sons but does not specify which son (although he is named second in the list) or name the son's wife . The chronology suggests that she must have been born from her father´s first marriage. m ([1187/89]) BOLESŁAW of Poland, son of MIESZKO III \"Stary/the Old\" Prince of Greater Poland & his second wife Ievdokia Iziaslavna of Kiev (1159-3 Sep 1195). He succeeded in 1194 as Prince of Kujavia.\n\nBogislaw I & his [first/second] wife had [one child]:\n\ne) [DOBROSLAWA (-after 1220) . Lady of Zlanene [Schlawe und Gützkow]. According to Europäische Stammtafeln, Dobroslawa was the same daughter of Duke Bogislaw I who married firstly Bolesław of Poland . No primary source has been found which indicates that this is correct, although it is possible that the widow of Bolesław returned to Pomerania after her husband´s death and married secondly a local nobleman. However, it is not certain that Dobroslawa was the daughter of Duke Bogislaw at all. This affiliation depends on the charter dated 23 Apr 1200 under which \"Boguslaus et soror mea Dobroslaua de Slauna\" donated \"villas Scarnino, Cosmacevo\" to the Knights of St John of Jerusalem . It is not clear that \"Boguslaus\" in this document was Bogislaw II Duke of Pomerania, especially as this is the only charter which has so far been found which does not accord him the title \"dux\". Nevertheless, it is clear that Dobroslawa was a person of importance, as demonstrated by the charter dated 1220 under which \"Ingardis Pomeranorum ducissa [et] filius meus Wartizlaus parvulus\" donated property to Kloster Grobe, for the soul of \"patris sui mariti mei bone memorie domini Kazimari\", witnessed by \" Domina de Zlauene\" . m (before [1200]) WARTISLAW von Gützkow Castellan of Stettin, son of BARTHOLOMÄUS Castellan of Gützkow [Swantiboriden] & his wife --- ([1175/80]-1233).]\n\nBogislaw I & his second wife had two children:\n\nf) BOGISLAW (-24 Jan 1220) . \"Boguslaus, Barnim et Otto Duces Slauorum\" confirmed the possessions of Kloster Gramzow by charter dated 22 Mar 1289, which names \"patris nostri bone memorie domini Barnim et avi nostri junioris Bugslai, nec non proavi nostri senioris Bugslai\" . He succeeded his father in 1187 as BOGISLAW II Duke of Pomerania.\n\n- see below.\n\ng) KASIMIR [II] ([1180]-before 20 Jun 1219) . \"Buguzlaus et frater noster Kazimarus Pomeranorum principes cum matre nostra Anastasia\" donated property at Treptow to St Maria by charter dated 1208, witnessed by \" Conradus prepositus et Bartolomeus et Kazimarus fratres \" . \"Kazimerus Pomeranorum dux\" donated property \"villam Warkentyn\" to Kloster Arendsee by charter dated to [1224] , but which should be dated earlier if this document refers to Kasimir [I] and if the latter's death date is correct as shown above. \"Nicholaus et Johannes domini de Werle et Johannes eadem domicellus de eodem\" donated property \"villam Warkentin quondam per Hinricum dominum de Werle nostrum patruum bone memorie\" to Kloster Arendsee by charter dated 2 Oct 1314, which also refers to the previous donation by \"Kazimarus et Wartislaus eius filius\" . \"Nicolaus et Heinricus fratres et domini de Rozstoch\" confirmed possessions of Kloster Arnesse made by \"Kazimarus necnon filius eius Wartizlaus\" by charter dated 20 Jun 1219 . m (before [1208/10]) INGERD [Ingeborg], daughter of [KNUD IV King of Denmark & his wife Gertrud von Sachsen [Welfen]] (-before 1236). \"Ingardis Pomeranorum ducissa [et] filius meus Wartizlaus parvulus\" donated property to Kloster Grobe, for the soul of \"patris sui mariti mei bone memorie domini Kazimari\", by charter dated 1220, witnessed by \" Domina de Zlauene\" . Her Danish royal origin is indicated by the charter dated 1225 under which her son \"Wartislaus dux Pomeranorum et Diminensium\" donated property to Kloster Dargun, sealed by \"ducis Worzlai e sanguine regis Danor\" . From a chronological point of view, it seems likely that Ingerd was the daughter of King Knud IV: the children of Knud´s brother King Valdemar II were born too late for one of them to have been the mother of Wartislaw Duke of Pomerania, and King Knud´s father, King Valdemar I, is already recorded with a daughter named Ingebjörg. Another possibility is that she was descended from the Danish royal family in the female line. The date of her marriage is estimated assuming that the date of birth of her son Wartislaw is correctly estimated as shown below. \"M[yroszlava] et Hyn[gardis] ductrices Slavie cum filiis nostris et ducibus Barnym et Wartizlao\" donated property to Kloster Mogilno in Colberg by charter dated to [1223/24] . \"Anastasia ducissa Pomeranorum\" donated property to Kloster Belbog, with the consent of \"dominarum relicte filii mei Bugzlai et alterius filii Kazemari relicte\" by charter dated 7 Jul 1224 witnessed by \" Barnota filius domini Jaromiri de Ruia \" . \"J ducissa Sclauie\" confirmed a donation to Kloster Dargun made by \"Rochillus castellanus noster in Dimin\" by charter dated to [1226/27] . \"Dominus Barnym dux Slauorum et fratre meo germano domino duce Wartislao\" renewed the donations to Kloster Mogilno made by \"mater nostra domina Myroslaua post mortem domini mei Boguslai [et] mee matertere Hyngardis domina terre Slauie relicta ducis Kazimari\" by charter dated 1236 . Kasimir & his wife had [two] children:\n\ni) WARTISLAW [III] ([1209/11]-17 May 1264). \"Ingardis Pomeranorum ducissa [et] filius meus Wartizlaus parvulus\" donated property to Kloster Grobe, for the soul of \"patris sui mariti mei bone memorie domini Kazimari\", by charter dated 1220 . \"M[yroszlava] et Hyn[gardis] ductrices Slavie cum filiis nostris et ducibus Barnym et Wartizlao\" donated property to Kloster Mogilno in Colberg by charter dated to [1223/24] . \"Wartislaus dux Pomeranorum et Diminensium\" donated property to Kloster Dargun by charter dated 1225, sealed by \"ducis Worzlai e sanguine regis Danor\" . The absence of his mother´s name in this document suggests that Wartislaw had already been declared of age at the date of the charter, probably recently as his mother is named with him in the charter dated to [1223/24]. As Wartislaw was described as \"parvulus\" in the charter dated 1220, it is likely that the age of majority in his case was young, say between 14 and 16 years old, which would place his birth in [1209/11]. \"Nicholaus et Johannes domini de Werle et Johannes eadem domicellus de eodem\" donated property \"villam Warkentin quondam per Hinricum dominum de Werle nostrum patruum bone memorie\" to Kloster Arendsee by charter dated 2 Oct 1314, which also refers to the previous donation by \"Kazimarus et Wartislaus eius filius\" . \"Barnim et Wartislaus Slauorum ac Dyminii duces\" confirmed donations to Kloster Dargun, founded by \"domino Swantopolco\", by charter dated 8 Jul 1253 . \"Wartislaus dux Demminensis\" bequeathed property to Kloster Bukow in his testament dated 1264\" . \"Barnim dux Slauorum\" confirmed the donation to Kloster Bukow in accordance with the last wishes of \"consanguineus noster dominus Wartislaus dux Demminensis\" by charter dated 31 Mar 1265 . m [as her first husband, SOPHIE von Arnstein, daughter of [ALBRECHT I Graf von Arnstein] & his wife ---. This marriage, together with her possible parentage and her second husband Pribislaw de Slawia Herr von Wollin, is shown in Europäische Stammtafeln . The primary source which confirms her parentage and marriage has not yet been identified.] Pope Gregory IX issued a dispensation to \"--- duci Pomeranie\" for his marriage to \"neptem Regis Dacie\" despite 4o consanguinity, dated 4 Sep 1238 . The editors of the Codex Pomeraniæ Diplomaticus suggest that this dispensation refers either to Duke Barnim I and his first wife or to Duke Wartislaw, whose mother´s relationship with the Danish royal family is already recorded . It is not clear that Wartislaw [III] married at all. No record of his wife has been found in any of the numerous charters in which he is named.\n\nii) [BARNIM (-after 12 Oct 1227). The editors of the Codex Pomeraniæ Diplomaticus name Barnim as the second son of Kasimir [II] and his wife Ingerd, adding that he is named in documents until 1227 . However, this is probably incorrect, as shown by the charter dated 12 Oct 1227 under which \"Wartizlaus dux Pomeranorum et Ingert mater ipsius ducissa eorundem\" confirmed the foundation of Kloster Treptow, in the presence of \"fratris nostri Barnimi et matris ipsius\", by charter dated 12 Oct 1227 . The reference to \"matris ipsius\" demonstrates that the mother of \"Barnimi\" was not \"Ingert\", and he was most likely Wartislaw´s first cousin despite his being called \"fratris nostri\" in the document.]\n\n2. KASIMIR [I] (-[6 Jun 1181/1182]) . Helmold names \"Kazemarus et Bugezlavus, duces Pomeranorum\" when recording their part in the rebellion of the Obotrites against Heinrich \"der Löwe\" Duke of Saxony in 1164, recording in a later passage that they converted to Christianity, founded a monastery at Stolpe in memory of \"patris sui Wertizlavi\", and founded \"episcopatum Uznam\" . Despite the order of the names given by Helmold, the charters quoted below all indicate that Kasimir was the younger brother of Bogislaw. \"Domino Iaczone, Domine Bogozlauo, Domino Cazimero principibus, Domino Wartizlauo castellano de Stetin, Zauist castellano Caminensi, Venzezlauo castellano Iuliensi, Gustizlauo castellano Uznomienis, Dirskone castellano Diminensi, et Budowoy cognato eius\" subscribed the charter dated 1168 under which Konrad Bishop of Pomerania confirmed the possessions of Kloster Grobe . \"Kasemarus princeps et dux Slavorum\" donated property to Kloster Lund by charter dated 1170 . \"Cazimerus Pomeranorum princeps\" donated property to the church of Havelberg, with the consent of \"fratre nostro Boguzlao\", by charter dated 16 Aug 1170 . \"Kazimarus Diminensium et Pomanorum princeps\" defined the limits of Kloster Granzen by charter dated 1174 . \"Kasimerus Pomoranorum princeps filius Wartizlai\" donated property to Kloster Grobe by charter dated 13 Nov 1175, witnessed by \"dominus Bochzlaus dux Pomeranie, Conradus episcopus secundus Pomeranie, dominus Iohannes frater eius Szenthepolc filius ducis Ratheburni\" . \"Kasimarus Dux Slavorum\" donated property to Kloster Stolp by charter dated 5 Dec 1176 . \"Boguslaus Pomeranorum Dux\" donated property to the church of Havelberg, with the consent of \"fratre nostro Boguzlao\", by charter dated 18 Apr 1177, which names \"patruus noster Ratiborus consorte sua Pribislaua frater noster Kazimerus\" . \"Kazimarus Dux Slavorum\" donated property to Kloster Stolp by charter dated 6 Jun 1181 . \"Boguzlaus Pomeranorum Dux\" confirmed a donation of property to the church of Havelberg by \"beate memorie Cazimerus frater meus\", with the consent of \"filiis nostris Ratiburone et Wartizlao\", by charter dated 1182 . m --- (-after 1175). The name of Kasimir´s wife is not known. She is referred to, but not named, in the charter dated to [1175/76] under which \"Kasimarus Pomeranorum princeps\" donated property to Kloster Camin \"pro me et uxore mea et liberis contuli\" . Kasimir & his wife had [two or more] children:\n\na) other children . The fact that Kasimir had more than one child is shown by the charter dated to [1175/76] under which \"Kasimarus Pomeranorum princeps\" donated property to Kloster Camin \"pro me et uxore mea et liberis contuli\" .\n\nb) [ODOLAN (-after 18 Mar 1188). \"Anastasia mariti viduata consortio cum filio ipsius et meo Boguzlavo\" confirmed a donation to Kloster Grobe by charter dated 18 Mar 1188, witnessed by \"Wartizlauus Szvantiboris, Odolanus filius Kazimari \" . It is not certain that the witness Odolan was the son of Kasimir [I] Duke of Pomerania, although the inclusion of his father´s name indicates that he was a person of some standing. However, Duke Kasimir [I] was not the only noble named Kasimir in Pomerania at the time, and it is probable that, if Odolan had been his son, a reference to the family relationship would have been included in the document. It is would also be surprising that, if Odolan was the son of Kasimir [I], no other reference has been found to him in any of the other contemporary charters in Pomerania.]\n\n3. [WOISLAWA (-Althof near Doberan [1172], bur Doberan Abbey) . The death and burial of fundatrix Woizlav is recorded in an inscription at Althof . Europäische Stammtafeln shows the wife of Pribislaw as the possible daughter of Wartislaw [I] .

It is unlikely that \"principe Barnimo\" indicates Barnim I Duke of Pomerania. It is true that Duke Barnim had succeeded his father in Jan 1220, but at that date he must have been an infant under the guardianship of his mother. It is therefore unlikely that he would have been present at a donation unaccompanied. In any case, Duke Barnim is consistently named in charters with his ducal title. It is therefore likely that Barnim was a more senior member of a junior branch of the Pomeranian ducal family whose parentage cannot yet be identified precisely.\n\n2. [sister (-after 1242) . Her family origin is suggested by the charter dated 25 Mar 1220 under which her son \"Suantoborus filius Kazemari cum matre mea\" agreed with Kloster Colbaz, in the presence of \"principe Barnimo patruo meo\", the boundaries of a donation made by him and \"matre mea\" . In its strict sense, patruus would indicate the paternal uncle of the donor. However, no other record has been found of members of the \"Swantiboriden\" family being accorded the title \"princeps\" in contemporary charters, which suggests that the term was used to indicate the donor´s maternal uncle. It is also possible that \"patruus\" was used broadly to indicate a close relative, maybe a cousin (more strictly \"patruelis\"). If this is correct, it is still unlikely that Barnim would have been a member of the donor´s paternal family. m KASIMIR, son of WARTISLAW & his wife --- (-[1219/Mar 1220]).]\n\nBOGISLAW von Pommern, son of BOGISLAW I Duke of Pomerania & his second wife Anastasia of Poland (-24 Jan 1220) . \"Boguslaus, Barnim et Otto Duces Slauorum\" confirmed the possessions of Kloster Gramzow by charter dated 22 Mar 1289, which names \"patris nostri bone memorie domini Barnim et avi nostri junioris Bugslai, nec non proavi nostri senioris Bugslai\" .

He dismisses Iaropolk Prince of Buzsk on the basis that any of his daughters would have been too old, and Iaropolk of Suzdal on the basis that his branch contracted no known western marriages as they had orientated themselves towards Byzantium, leaving only Iaropolk Romanovich Prince of Smolensk.]\n\nm [secondly] MIROSLAWA von Pommerellen, daughter of MESTWIN I Herzog von Pommerellen & his wife Swinislawa --- (-after 18 May 1233). \"M[yroszlava] et Hyn[gardis] ductrices Slavie cum filiis nostris et ducibus Barnym et Wartizlao\" donated property to Kloster Mogilno in Colberg by charter dated to [1223/24] . \"Anastasia ducissa Pomeranorum\" donated property to Kloster Belbog, with the consent of \"dominarum relicte filii mei Bugzlai et alterius filii Kazemari relicte\" by charter dated 7 Jul 1224 witnessed by \" Barnota filius domini Jaromiri de Ruia \" . \"M[iroslawa] Sclavorum ducissa et filius meus B[arnim] dux\" donated property to Kloster Zuckau by charter dated to [1229], witnessed by \" uxore domini Sambory Machtelde \" .

According to Europäische Stammtafeln, Dobroslawa was the same daughter of Duke Bogislaw I who married firstly Bolesław of Poland . No primary source has been found which indicates that this is correct, although it is possible that the widow of Bolesław returned to Pomerania after her husband´s death and married secondly a local nobleman. However, it is not certain that Dobroslawa was the daughter of Duke Bogislaw at all. This affiliation depends on the charter dated 23 Apr 1200 under which \"Boguslaus et soror mea Dobroslaua de Slauna\" donated \"villas Scarnino, Cosmacevo\" to the Knights of St John of Jerusalem . It is not clear that \"Boguslaus\" in this document was Bogislaw II Duke of Pomerania, especially as this is the only charter which has so far been found which does not accord him the title \"dux\". Nevertheless, it is clear that Dobroslawa was a person of importance, as demonstrated by the charter dated 1220 under which \"Ingardis Pomeranorum ducissa [et] filius meus Wartizlaus parvulus\" donated property to Kloster Grobe, for the soul of \"patris sui mariti mei bone memorie domini Kazimari\", witnessed by \" Domina de Zlauene\" . Wartislaw & his wife had [one child]:\n\ni) [daughter . Her parentage is suggested by the charter dated 12 Nov 1249 under which her son \"Johannes filius Jaczonis de Cotscowe\" donated property to Kloster Ilda, witnessed by \"frater noster Conradus \" . Jaczo´s acquisition of Gützkow would best be explained by his marriage with its heiress. m JACZO, son of --- (-before 12 Nov 1237). Vogt von Salzwedel. \" Dominus Jaczo advocatus de Salwedele\" subscribed the charter dated 18 May 1233 under which \"Mirozlawa Pomeranorum ducissa et filius eius Barnim dux\" confirmed a donation to Kloster Grobe . \"Conradus Episcopus Caminensis\" donated revenue to Kloster Stolp, for the soul of \"fratris nostri Jaczonis memoria\", by charter dated 12 Nov 1237 .]\n\n2. WARTISLAW (-[1230/32]).

Castellan of Stettin. m ---. The name of Wartislaw´s wife is not known. Wartislaw & his wife had two children:\n\na) BARTHOLOMÄUS (-after 17 Jun 1249). \"Bartholomeus filius Wartizlaui iunioris\" witnessed the charter dated 1235 under which \"Barnym dux Pomeranorum\" granted protection to Kloster Colbaz . His parentage is confirmed by the charter dated 1274 under which \"Kazimarus filius Suantobori\" confirmed donations made to Kloster Colbaz made by \"bone memorie Kazimari avi nostri, fratrisque sui Wartizlavi, et filii sui Bartholomei, patrisque nostri Suantobori, et cognati nostri Wartizlaui, Bartholomei filii, predecessorum nostrorum\", by charter dated 1274 . \"Bartholomeus filius Wartizlai iunioris \" witnessed the charter dated 1240 under which \"Barnym dux Pomeranorum\" confirmed property of Kloster Colbaz . \"Barnym dux Pomeranorum\" confirmed a donation to Kloster Colbaz made by \"agnatus noster dominus Zuantoborus filius Kazemeri\" by charter dated 1244, witnessed by \"Suantoborus ipse et Kazimerus filius eius, Bartholomeus filius Wartizlaui \" . m ---. The parentage of the wife of Bartholomäus is suggested by the charter dated 17 Jun 1249 under which \"Barnym Slauorum Dux\" donated property to Kloster Colbaz by charter dated Jun 1249 witnessed by \"Bartolomeus cognatus noster \" . The term \"cognatus\" is frequently (although not exclusively) used to indicate brother-in-law. It is therefore possible that Bartholomäus married Duke Barnim´s sister. However, the same document also named \"ducis domini Wartislaui cognati nostri\", which suggests that the term was not used strictly.\n\n3. KONRAD (-1233). Canon at Kammin Cathedral 1176/1186, provost 1186/1189 and 1208. \"Buguzlaus et frater noster Kazimarus Pomeranorum principes cum matre nostra Anastasia\" donated property at Treptow to St Maria by charter dated 1208, witnessed by \" Conradus prepositus et Bartolomeus et Kazimarus fratres \" .

The name of Kasimir´s wife is not known. \"Suantoborus filius Kazemari cum matre mea\" donated property \"villam Smirdniza, hereditario iure michi pertinentem\" to Kloster Colbaz by charter dated to [1220], witnessed by \"Wartizlaus filius Bartholomei \" . Her family origin is suggested by the charter dated 25 Mar 1220 under which her son \"Suantoborus filius Kazemari cum matre mea\" agreed with Kloster Colbaz, in the presence of \"principe Barnimo patruo meo\", the boundaries of a donation made by him and \"matre mea\" . In its strict sense, patruus would indicate the paternal uncle of the donor. However, no other record has been found of members of the \"Swantiboriden\" family being accorded the title \"princeps\" in contemporary charters, which suggests that the term was used to indicate the donor´s maternal uncle. It is also possible that \"patruus\" was used broadly to indicate a close relative, maybe a cousin (more strictly \"patruelis\"). If this is correct, it is still unlikely that Barnim would have been a member of the donor´s paternal family. 1242. Kasimir & his wife had [two] children:\n\na) [SWIETOSLAWA [Swiatochna] (-after Aug 1217) .
