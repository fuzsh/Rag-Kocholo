        "text": "On March 13, 1194, the real King Richard reached England after his involuntary stay in Germany. My fictional Richard has just landed. I am happy to report that Lionheart is now in British bookshops at long last. It is also available as an e-book. And it looks as if Richard is going to get bragging rights over Henry again, which, if I know my Angevins, is going to tick Henry off‚Äìroyally, of course. My British publisher tells me that Lionheart debuted as #21 on the UK hardback bestseller list‚Äîsorry, Henry.\n\nThis seems like a good time to discuss a book I mentioned in the Lionheart AN. I recommended a number of books relating to the research I did for Lionheart, primarily chronicles. I did list several biographies, too, among them Frank McLynn‚Äôs Richard and John, published in the UK under the more memorable title Lionheart and Lackland. I explained that I had not read the second half of the book that deals with John‚Äôs reign, but I found Richard‚Äôs section to be historically accurate. I should have been more specific, saying that I read the portions of the book that began with Richard‚Äôs coronation. I had not read the earlier sections as they were not relevant for my research. Well, recently I browsed some of these chapters and I was taken aback by the very negative views he takes of both Geoffrey and Henry. I most definitely do not agree with his conclusions about either man. I still say read the book if you are interested in the time period, just do not accept his ‚Äútake‚Äù on Geoffrey and Henry as gospel. We know that mine is the accurate depiction, after all. üôÇ\n\nIn terms of research and historical accuracy, I think the definitive biographies of Henry and Richard remain the ones written by W. Warren and John Gillingham. There is no definitive biography of Eleanor, but there are a number of them out there, more than for her husband‚Äîsorry again, Henry. Ralph Turner‚Äôs biography is particularly good on his analysis of the scandal in Antioch. I highly recommend Eleanor of Aquitaine, Lord and Lady, a series of essays about our favorite queen. The biographies by Amy Kelly and Marion Meade are beautifully written, but their views on the Courts of Love must be discounted as they are very outdated. For some reason, biographies do not seem to have proof readers, for I am sure many of the mistakes about names are just that, errors due to fatigue or a momentary mental lapse. For example, McLynn tells us that William Marshal‚Äôs father was named Geoffrey, not John. I‚Äôm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt there. Same for Dr. Kessler‚Äôs excellent German biography of Coeur de Lion, Richard I. Lowenherz, when she misidentifies the brothers, Lord of Gorz, whom Richard encounters on his ill-fated journey home from the Holy Land.\n\nBut I‚Äôd be the last one to lambaste someone for fumbling a name after my latest mental lapse. I was answering a Facebook reader‚Äôs question about the name of Richard‚Äôs illegitimate son, Philip, assuring her that he was not named after the French king, Philippe Capet. I then pointed out that Richard‚Äôs own name was not a common one in either of his parents‚Äô families. So far, so good. But then I had to mention his second son, Fulk, whose existence has not been confirmed, saying that was unusual, too. Yikes. As my friend Chuck kindly reminded me, Fulk is an Angevin staple. How could I have forgotten Henry‚Äôs grandfather, the fifth Fulk of that name to rule Anjou, who went on to wed the Queen of Jerusalem. Or the notorious Fulk Nerra, who‚Äôd probably give the Demon Countess of Anjou a run for her money. I lost track of all the penitential pilgrimages he had to make to the Holy Land, but I remain haunted by the fate of his wife, who‚Äôd been reckless enough to take a lover. Fulk had her burned at the stake in her wedding gown. So I cast no stones for name mishaps.\n\nIt is more difficult to explain another historian‚Äôs faux pas; he tells us that when a teenage John invaded his brother Richard‚Äôs lands in Aquitaine, he was accompanied by his brother Geoffrey, the future Archbishop of York. Definitely the wrong Geoffrey there, sir. I was truly taken aback by David Boyle‚Äôs speculation that Richard I could have been a secret Templar. And I remain infuriated with the French historian Jean Flori who labeled Henry a pedophile for his alleged affair with the unhappy Alys of France. As I‚Äôve said repeatedly, I have no problems whatsoever if someone concludes that there was indeed an affair, for these rumors were current during their lifetimes. I was rather disappointed, in fact, when I concluded that these rumors were political slanders put about by Henry‚Äôs multitude of foes and given some credence by his history of womanizing. Writers crave drama the way my dogs crave liver, and what could be more dramatic than a man seducing his own son‚Äôs betrothed? What wonderful scenes I could have written‚Ä¶sigh. But no one suggested any liaison between Henry and Alys before Rosamund Clifford‚Äôs death, when Alys was in her 17th year. Now today an older man and a seventeen year old girl would likely stir up some disapproval, but this was the 12th century, Monsieur Flori. By his standards, Llywelyn Fawr would be a pedophile for wedding Joanna at age fourteen. Now John did raise some eyebrows by bedding his twelve year old bride, Isabelle a‚ÄôAngouleme, but that is another story for another time.\n\nOkay, end of rant. I should alert my British readers that the Lionheart Author‚Äôs Note is lengthy even by my self-indulgent standards‚Äî11 pages. The novel itself weighs in at a brisk 600 pages. I thought it might be fun to include physical descriptions of my Angevins. Here is a contemporary account of Richard‚Äôs appearance. ‚ÄúHe was tall, of elegant build; the color of his hair was between red and gold; his limbs were supple and straight. He had long arms suited to wielding a sword. His long legs matched the rest of his body.‚Äù\n\nFrom the Itinerarium peregrinorum et gesta regis Ricardi by Richard de Templo.‚Äù\n\nHere is one of Henry, his sire. ‚ÄúHe was a little over medium height, a man blessed with sound limbs and a handsome countenance, one upon whom men gazed a thousand times, yet took occassion to return. In physical capacity he was second to none, capable of any activity which another could perform, lacking no courtesy, well read to a degree both seemly and profitable, having a knowledge of all tongues spoken from the coasts of France to the river Jordan, but making use of only Latin and French.‚Äù\n\nFrom De Nugis of Walter Map.\n\nAnd here is a wonderfully detailed one of Henry by Peter of Blois. ‚ÄúThe lord king has been red-haired so far, except that the coming of old age and gray hair has altered that color somewhat. His height is medium, so that neither does he appear great among the small, nor yet does he seem small among the great. His head is spherical‚Ä¶his eyes are full, guileless, and dove-like when he is at peace, gleaming like fire when his temper is aroused, and in bursts of passion they flash like lightning. As to his hair he is in no danger of baldness, but his head has been closely shaved. He has a broad, square, lion-like face. Curved legs, a horseman‚Äôs shins, broad chest, and a boxer‚Äôs arms all announce him as a man strong, agile and bold‚Ä¶ he never sits, unless riding a horse or eating‚Ä¶ In a single day, if necessary, he can run through four or five day-marches and, thus foiling the plots of his enemies, frequently mocks their plots with surprise sudden arrivals‚Ä¶Always are in his hands bow, sword, spear and arrow, unless he be in council or in books.‚Äù\n\nFrom the Epistolae of Peter of Blois (1070-1117)\n\nHere is one of Geoffrey and John. John, King of England, son of Henry II (1166-1216)\n\nGeoffrey and John both ‚Äúwere of rather short stature, a little below the middle height, and for their size were well-shaped enough.‚Äù\n\nFrom The Topography of Ireland by Gerald of Wales John‚Äôs body was exhumed in 1797 and measured at five feet, six inches and half, as related by Valentine Green in The Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine, 67, pt 2, 1797.\n\nNotice who is missing? Yes, while they praised her great beauty, not a single medieval chronicler thought to mention the color of Eleanor‚Äôs hair or eyes. That did not stop Frank McLynn, though, from telling us she had black hair and eyes and a voluptuous figure. I don‚Äôt mean to pick on him, but he has strayed into the province of the historical novelist here. I can do that; so can Elizabeth Chadwick. As novelists, we have to be able to paint a word picture for our readers. But writers of non-fiction need to throw in a ‚ÄúI think‚Äù or ‚Äúit is likely‚Äù before presenting their readers with such a detailed description.\n\nHowever, thanks to a Saracen chronicler who actually sounds rather smitten, we do have this poetic image of Isabella, Queen of Jerusalem, an important character in Lionheart. Isabella of Jerusalem ‚ÄúOne of the daughters of heaven; her face, shining white, appeared like the morning in the night of her very black hair.‚Äù\n\nFrom the ConquÈòæe de la Syrie et de la Palestine par Saladin of Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani\n\nAnd here is Richard‚Äôs nemesis, Heinrich von Hohenstaufen, the Holy Roman Emperor. Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, son of Frederick Barbarossa and Beatrix of Burgundy, father of Frederick II (1165-1197)\n\n‚Äú[His] face was pleasant but very thin, and he was only moderately tall with a slight and frail physique.‚Äù\n\nFrom Burchard of Ursperg.\n\nAnd while Heinrich‚Äôs son does not appear in Lionheart, his birth is dramatized in my first ever short story, so here are two remarkably contrasting views of this extraordinary man. Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and king of Sicily, son of the Emperor Henry VI and Constance of Sicily, grandson of Frederick Barbarossa and Roger II of Sicily (1194-1250)\n\n‚ÄúThe Emperor was covered with red hair, was bald and myopic. Had he been a slave, he would not have fetched 200 dirhams at market.‚Äù\n\nFrom the Muntazam by Sibt Ibn al-Jawzi\n\n‚ÄúHe could read, write, sing, and compose music and songs. He was a handsome man, well-built but of medium stature.‚Äù From the Cronica of Salimbene.\n\nMost of the time, historical novelists have to rely upon happenstance to get a contemporary description of the people we write about. One of my favorites comes from the chronicler who explained that when Llywelyn Fawr‚Äôs son Gruffydd attempted to escape from the Tower of London, the knotted sheets broke, plunging him to his death, because he was such a large man and had grown corpulent in captivity. In the final analysis, though, we can only image what these historical figures actually looked like‚Ä¶.unless they have effigies that the gifted Jude Maris can resurrect for us. If you have not seen her work on YouTube, you‚Äôre in for a treat. Here is the link. Click onto it and you will watch as Eleanor and her favorite son Richard come to life like Sleeping Beauty. Say what you will about the Angevins, they were a very good-looking family. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvCodhi9nXU&list=UUTy1lP38Za7MgbfWsJ-2u-A&index=7&feature=plcp And http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVOFwLfchWA\n\nFor my readers who‚Äôve already read Lionheart, thanks for indulging me in this. For my British readers, I hope you find the Richard of Lionheart to be as surprising as I did.\n\nMarch 28, 2012"
