        "text": "St. Elizabeth of Hungary\n\nJuly 7, 1207 - November 17, 1231\n\nSt. Elizabeth, Queen of Hungary, was only twenty-four when she died. But what a beautiful life she had led!\n\nHer father was a king. Her aunt was St. Hedwig. When Elizabeth was very young, she married Louis, a young noblemen, who soon became king. She was sweet to her husband and loved her children.\n\nIn the midst of this wealth and prestige of royalty, Elizabeth knew that queens must be very good to the poor and sick. So she took care of them in the palace. She nursed them in the hospitals. Her husband grew concerned. \"That's no work for a queen.\" he said. One day she went to visit the poor. Her cloak was full of provisions. Her husband met her. \"Are you carrying food like a servant?\" he demanded. He pulled open her cloak. Out fell, not food, but lovely red and white roses. Her husband asked her forgiveness. He knew she was a saint!\n\nHer husband died when she was still very young. The next king treated her very badly and threw her out of her palace. But, she trusted God, and God took her swiftly to His palace in Heaven.\n\nElizabeth is the patron saint of bakers, nursing homes, brides, and beggars. Her Feast is celebrated on November 17."
