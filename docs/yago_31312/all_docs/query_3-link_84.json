        "text": "Born to wealth and royalty, Saint Elizabeth [1207 -1231] married the King of Thuringia [central Germany] at a young age and was widowed by the time she was 20. A contemporary of Saint Francis, she felt a great conflict between her royal status and the living standards of the poor.\n\nIn 1222, she encountered the Franciscan Friars, embraced what Saint Francis was preaching, and turned her life-style more towards his. She assumed control of the royal household, distributing alms, giving away state garments and selling ornaments from her castle to help the poor. She arranged and paid for a hospital to be built for the poor and would make daily visits.\n\nPope Benedict XVI said, “Elizabeth diligently practiced works of mercy: she would give food and drink to those who knocked at her door, she procured clothing, paid debts, cared for the sick and buried the dead. Coming down from her castle, she often visited the homes of the poor with her ladies-in-waiting, bringing them bread, meat, flour and other food. She distributed the food personally and attentively checked the clothing and mattresses of the poor.”\n\nThis behavior was reported to her husband, who not only was not displeased but answered her accusers, “So long as she does not sell the castle, I am happy with her!”.\n\nElizabeth loved and respected the Friars Minor and in 1227, she joined the Secular Franciscan Order.\n\nPope Benedict also testifies, “We can discern a certain mystical experience in Saint Elizabeth similar to that of Saint Francis: the Poverello of Assisi who in his Testament, declared that serving lepers, which he at first found repugnant, was transformed for him into sweetness of soul and of body [Testamentum, 1-3].\n\nElizabeth spent her last three years in the hospital she founded, serving the sick and caring for the dying. She always tried to carry out the most humble services and repugnant tasks. She became what we might call a consecrated woman in the world and, with other friends clothed in grey habits, lived a religious life. It is not by chance that she is the Patroness of the Third Order Regular of St Francis and of the Franciscan Secular Order.\n\nElizabeth died in November of 1231. Only four years later, Pope Gregory IX, after hearing countless testimonies of her virtue, declared her a Saint.\n\nHappy feast day of Saint Elizabeth!"
