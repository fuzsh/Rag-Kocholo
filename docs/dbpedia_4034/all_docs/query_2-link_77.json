        "text": "British royal recognitions\n\nThe New Year Honours 2000 for the United Kingdom and New Zealand[1] were announced on 31 December 1999, to celebrate the year passed and mark the beginning of 2000. The Honours list is a list of people who have been awarded one of the various orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom. Honours are split into classes (\"orders\") and are graded to distinguish different degrees of achievement or service, most medals are not graded. The awards are presented to the recipient in one of several investiture ceremonies at Buckingham Palace throughout the year by the Sovereign or her designated representative. The Prince of Wales (now Charles III) and The Princess Royal deputised for The Queen.\n\nThe orders, medals and decorations are awarded by various honours committees which meet to discuss candidates identified by public or private bodies, by government departments or who are nominated by members of the public.[2] Depending on their roles, those people selected by committee are submitted either to the prime minister, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, or Secretary of State for Defence for their approval before being sent to the Sovereign for final approval. As the \"fount of honour\" the monarch remains the final arbiter for awards.[3] In the case of certain orders such as the Order of the Garter and the Royal Victorian Order they remain at the personal discretion of the Queen.[4]\n\nThe recipients of honours are displayed here as they were styled before their new honour, and arranged by honour, with classes (Knight, Knight Grand Cross, etc.) and then divisions (Military, Civil, etc.) as appropriate.\n\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nLife peers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2000 New Year Honours list 6 people were made Life Peers through being made a Baron or Baroness.[5]\n\nSir John Birt, Director-General, BBC.\n\nThe Right Honourable Sir Leon Brittan, QC, lately Vice-President, European Commission.\n\nSally Greengross, Lady Greengross, OBE, Director-General, Age Concern.\n\nJoel Goodman Joffe, CBE, Chairman, OXFAM.\n\nAdam Hafejee Patel, Vice President, Blackburn Community Relations Council and Counsellor, Muslim Council of Britain.\n\nSir Charles David Powell, KCMG, Director, Jardine Matheson Holdings.\n\nMembers of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Order of the Companions of Honour is an order with 65 members who have been rewarded for outstanding achievements in the arts, literature, music, science, politics, industry or religion; three people were invested into the order in this list.[6]\n\nRichard Hamilton, artist.
