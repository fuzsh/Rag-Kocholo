The highest award, Companion of Honour, went to Mr Brown, while Sir Alan was knighted in recognition of his campaigning around the Post Office Horizon scandal.\n\nActress Imelda Staunton and fashion accessories designer Anya Hindmarch were made dames, while writer Armando Iannucci was made a CBE and cyclist Mark Cavendish was knighted. Singer Rebecca Ferguson, Duran Duran frontman Simon Le Bon, Countdown’s Susie Dent and Strictly Come Dancing’s Amy Dowden were among the showbiz names to be made MBEs.\n\nREAD MORE: Post Office scandal campaigner Alan Bates gets knighthood in King's Birthday Honours\n\nIn the sporting world, former cyclist Chris Boardman and former Liverpool midfielder Graeme Souness were made CBEs, while former England footballer Karen Carney was made an OBE.\n\nThe youngest recipient in the list was 20-year-old Shamza Butt, who received a British Empire Medal for her work at the voluntary development programme National Citizen Service on behalf of young people. Harold Jones was the oldest recipient, who at 100 years old received a British Empire Medal for his fundraising for motor neurone disease charities in Sutton Coldfield in the West Midlands.\n\nAward organisers said 64 per cent of recipients were people who showed “outstanding work” in their communities either in a voluntary or paid capacity, adding that 66 per cent of recipients lived outside London and the South East.\n\nOf the 1,077 people honoured in the 2024 list, 509 were women – representing 48 per cent of the total – and 10 per cent of all successful candidates were from an ethnic minority background.
