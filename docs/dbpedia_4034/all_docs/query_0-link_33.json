        "text": "\"Your ancient and native kingdom of Scotland is in a mighty distemper. It is incumbent on your Majesty to find out the disease, remove the cause, and apply convenient remedies. The disease in my opinion is contagious, and may infect the rest of your Majesty's dominions. It is a falling sickness, for they are like to fall from you, and from the obedience due to you, if, by removing the cause, and application of wholesome remedies, it be not speedily prevented. The cause is a fear and apprehension, not without some reason, of changes in religion, and that superstitious worship shall be brought in upon it, and therewith all their laws infringed and their liberties invaded. Free them, sir, from this fear, as you are free from any such thoughts; and undoubtedly you shall thereby settle the State in a firm obedience to your Majesty in all time coming. They have no other end but to preserve their religion in purity, and their liberties entire. That they intend the overthrow of monarchial government is a calumny. They are capable of no other, for many and great reasons; and ere they will admit another than your Majesty, and after you your son and nearest of your posterity, to sit upon your throne, many thousands of them will spend their dearest blood. You are not like a tree lately planted, which oweth a fall to the first wind. Your ancestors have governed theirs, without interruption of race, two thousand years or thereabouts, and taken such root as it can never be plucked up by any but yourselves. If any others shall entertain such treasonable thoughts, which I do not believe, certainly they will prove as vain as they are wicked.\n\n\"The remedy of this dangerous disease consisteth only in your Majesty's presence for a space in that kingdom. It is easy to you in person to settle their troubles, and to disperse these mists of apprehension and mistakingimpossible to any other. If you send down a commissioner, whatever he be, he shall neither give nor get contentment, but shall render the disease incurable. The success of your Majesty's affairs, the security of your authority, the peace and happiness of your subjects, depend upon your personal presence. The disease is of that kind which is much helped by conceit[182] and the presence of the physician. Now is the proper time and the critical days. For the people love change, and expect from it much gooda new heaven and a new earth; but, being disappointed, are as[126] desirous of a re-change to the former estate.\n\n\"Satisfy them, sir, in point of religion and liberties, when you come here, in a loving and free manner; that they may see your Majesty had never any other purpose, and doth not intend the least prejudice to either. For religious subjects, and such as enjoy their lawful liberties, obey better and love more than the godless and the servile, who do all out of base fear, which begets hate. Any difference that may arise upon the Acts passed in the last Parliament, your Majesty's presence, and the advice and endeavour of your faithful servants will easily accommodate. Let your Majesty be pleased to express your favour and care of your subjects' weal by giving way to any just notion of theirs for relief of the burdens these late troubles have laid on them, and by granting what else may tend to their good; which your Majesty may do with assurance that therein is included your own.\n\n\"Suffer them not to meddle or dispute of your power. It is an instrument never subjects yet handled well. Let not your authority receive any diminution of that which the law of God and Nature and the fundamental laws of the country alloweth; for then it shall grow contemptible; and weak and miserable is the people whose prince hath not power sufficient to punish oppression and to maintain peace and justice.\n\n\"On the other side, aim not at absoluteness. It endangers your estate and stirs up trouble. The people of the western parts of the world could never endure it any long time, and they of Scotland less than any. Hearken not to Rehoboam's counsellors. They are flatterers, and therefore cannot be friends; they will follow your fortune, and love not your person. Pretend what they will, their hasty ambition and avarice make them persuade an absolute government that the exercise of the same (may be put) on them, and then they know how to get wealth . . .[183]\n\n\"Practise, sir, the temperate government. It fitteth the humour and disposition of the nation best. It is most strong, most powerful, most desirable of any. It gladdeth the heart of your subjects, and then they erect a throne there for you to reign. Firmissimum imperium quo obedientes gaudent. Let your last act there be the settling the offices of State upon men of known integrity and sufficiency. Take them not upon credit and other men's recommendation; they prefer men for their own ends and with respect to themselves. Neither yet take them at a hazard, but upon your own knowledge, which fully reacheth to a great many more than will fill those few places. Let them not be such as are obliged to others than yourself for their preferment; not factious nor popular; neither such as are much hated; for these are not able to serve you well, and the others are not willing if it be prejudice to those upon whom they depend. They who are preferred and obliged to your Majesty will study to behave them well and dutifully in their places, if it were for no other reason yet for this, that they make not your[127] Majesty ashamed of your choice.\n\n\"So shall your Majesty secure your authority for the present, and settle it for the future time. Your journey shall be prosperous, your return glorious. You shall be followed with the blessings of your people, and with that contentment which a virtuous deed reflecteth upon the mind of the doer. And more true and solid shall your glory be than if you had conquered nations and subdued a people.\n\n\". . . . pax una triumphis Innumeris potior.\"[184]\n\nThis sagacious letter might be elaborately annotated from contemporary history. There was no sentence in it which future events were not to justify abundantly, save that optimism about Scottish opinion which was to prove to Montrose a deceptive light. What could Argyll offer on the other side? It would be a mistake to take too seriously the gossip about his monarchical ambitions. The chief of the Campbells was far too shrewd a man to let a glittering dream divert him from a practicable purpose. His aim was to be dictator of Scotland, and his abilities were adequate to the task. Had he had military genius, he might well have played in Scotland the part of Cromwell, and wholly upturned the old foundations of sovereignty. But what had he to put in its place? Another autocracy without the sanctions of the old. He had made the cumbrous mediæval Parliament a more efficient and representative thing, but this reform merely strengthened the hands of the new oligarchy. He was sworn to the creed of intolerant Presbyterian domination in its extremest form. Above all, he was the clan chief, who supported his friends and did not forgive his enemies. To Montrose the alternative was unthinkable, for it would bring to Scotland not peace but a naked sword. He himself, in his young enthusiasm for the national religion and liberties, had been led into courses which were alien to his beliefs. He had assented to the constraint of private consciences, when he approved of the compulsory signature of the Covenant; he had given his approval to feudal barbarities when he signed Argyll's commis[128]sion for the subjection of the North. But his eyes were now opened, and he hastened to draw aside from that perilous road.\n\nMontrose was an ingenuous conspirator, for in his eagerness to discover like-mindedness and make converts he talked freely to the wrong people. At Scone, during a visit to Lord Stormont, he heard from Atholl, Stewart of Grandtully, and John Stewart of Ladywell, the commissary of Dunkeld, reports of treasonable speeches made by Argyll during the Perthshire expedition of the previous year. He spoke of them to his friend, Mr. Robert Murray, the minister of Methven, who mentioned them to Mr. John Graham, the minister of Auchterarder, who repeated the story to the Auchterarder presbytery, whence it came to the ear of Argyll. Graham and Murray were asked for their authority, and they named Montrose, who accepted responsibility and in turn cited his evidence. His witnesses, he said, were Lindsay of the Byres, Cassilis, Mar, and Stewart of Ladywell. The witnesses were summoned before the Committee of Estates, and proved unsatisfactory. Lindsay remembered the conversation, but said that he had not named Argyll. Ladywell stood by his words, signed a written statement, and was thereupon, on 31st May, sent to Edinburgh castle.\n\nThere something happened. Either Ladywell's nerve broke down, or he was worked on by friends of Argyll, like Balmerino; for next day he saw Argyll, recanted the charges against him, and declared that he had forged them out of malice. He did more, for he confessed that he had been privy to discussions between Montrose, Napier, his nephew Sir George Stirling of Keir, and Keir's brother-in-law, Archibald Stewart of Blackhall, and that, acting on their instructions, he had sent a report of Argyll's treason to the king. The messenger who carried it was a certain Walter Stewart of the Traquair family, and on the return journey he was captured by the Committee. Among the papers found on him was a short note from the king to Montrose about his coming to Scotland, to which no[129] exception could be taken, and certain papers written in a strange jargon, which was in all likelihood the product of Stewart's own half-witted fancy, but which to the Committee had an ugly look of a secret cypher. Stewart was ready with a confused but dark-sounding interpretation, and on this document Montrose, Napier, Stirling, and Stewart of Blackhall were arrested and confined in separate rooms in the castle.[185]\n\nIt is not likely that Ladywell's first story was true. Argyll was too cautious a man to speak rashly on such matters in uncertain company; if he talked of the deposition of kings, it is probable that it was as an abstract proposition of kings in general. Nor did he show the desire of the rest of the Committee for the summary punishment of Ladywellwhich would have been natural if Ladywell had been an inconvenient witness whom it was politic to silence. We know from Guthry, a hostile witness, that he consulted the Lord Advocate to see if a more lenient sentence could not be imposed.[186] The wretched man was duly convicted under the old Scottish statute of \"leasing-making,\"[187] and publicly beheaded in Edinburgh on 28th July.\n\nMeantime there was the far graver business of Montrose. Argyll could afford to neglect the wild gossip of the commissary of Dunkeld, but it was another matter to have responsible Scottish nobles, with influence in the army, negotiating behind his back with the king. Napier was offered release as a favour, but declined to accept it; he declared that if any one was guilty he was, and he would not be separated from his companions. Montrose refused to answer any question before the Committee, and demanded a public trial by his peers. Traquair angrily denied any complicity with his preposterous kinsman, Walter Stewart. The king wrote on 12th June to Argyll to clear himsel[130]f; his letter to Montrose was \"fit for me to write, both for the matter, and the person to whom it is written;\"[188] he had made no promise to any one as to the distribution of offices; he was coming to Scotland for no other purpose than to settle the affairs of the kingdom \"according to the articles of the treaty.\" This might seem sufficient to clear Montrose, but his opponents, having got him under duress, did not intend to let him readily go. His house was broken into and his papers ransacked, but nothing more dangerous to the peace of the realm could be found than a paper justifying the Cumbernauld Bond, and \"some letters from ladies to him in his younger years, flowered with Arcadian compliments.\"[189] On 27th July he was brought before Parliament, and declared that he had nothing to confess or to defend. \"Truth doth not seek corners, it needeth no favour.\" He awaited their lordships' questions or commands. \"My resolution is to carry along with me fidelity and honour to the grave.\"[190] They could make nothing of such a man, and sent him back to prison. He was brought again before Parliament on 6th August, and a third time on 14th August.[191] On the evening of the latter day the king arrived in Edinburgh.\n\nCharles's determination to come to Scotland, so puzzling to Clarendon, was due to the belief that he had still a powerful following in that kingdom, which needed only to be heartened by his presence. But a few days in Edinburgh were sufficient to disillusion him. With Lennox and Hamilton as his companions he recovered neither popularity nor authority. He had come north largely in the hope of securing part of Leslie's army for use in the struggle which he saw to be imminent in England, and for this he was prepared to pay a high price. He paid the price, but he did not secure his end, for Leslie's army was disbanded. Non-Covenanting nobles like Lennox, Hamilton, Morton, and Roxburgh were compelled to take the Covenant. Hamilton, always, as Charles said, \"very active in his own preservation[131],\" made his peace with Argyll. Henderson became the royal chaplain, and the king was obliged to listen to many sermons and attend endless services conducted under the austerest Presbyterian forms. He was prepared to ratify the Acts of the unconstitutional Parliament of 1640, but he was not permitted. These Acts, he was curtly informed, were already valid, and he was instructed merely to sanction their proclamation.[192] Parliament demanded, and he granted, a control over the executive and judiciary far more complete than anything claimed by the English Parliament at Westminster.[193] Its triennial meeting was guaranteed, independent of the royal assent. Loudoun was nominated Chancellor; for Treasurer, the king's suggestions first of Morton and then of Almond were vetoed, and the office was put into commission. There was no proposal of the Covenanters, however drastic, to which the king did not assent. In return he received much lip loyalty and many fine speeches, but no general popularity or confidence. As was his fatal habit, he had been too late in his concessions, and what, if voluntarily given, might once have re-established his power, now, taken by force, left only distrust and contempt.\n\nMeanwhile, what of Montrose, now fast in prison? Was he to go the way of Strafford? There was an ominous sentence used by Argyll at the opening of Parliament in his reply to the speech from the Throne, when he spoke of the State as a ship in distress and the need of casting out \"some of the naughtiest baggage to lighten her.\"[194] The old statute against \"leasing-making\" might be used as a weapon against nobler game than the humble commissary of Dunkeld. On 15th September Sir Patrick Wemyss wrote to Ormonde that the king had promised Montrose not to leave Scotland till he was brought to trial, \"for, if he leave him, all the world will not save his life.\"[195] On 28th August the four prisoners were called before Par[132]liament, when the king nodded friendlily to Napier,[196] but their case was postponed. It would have been highly inconvenient to Argyll and Hamilton to have Montrose at this juncture pleading his cause before his peers.\n\nBack again in the castle, Montrose was in a state of miserable anxiety and impotence. He heard of the new Act making the choice of Ministers dependent upon the will of Parliamenta piece of constitutionalism which, lacking the machinery and safeguards of modern government, was simply a premium set upon faction and sectarian tyranny. He heard of the decision that no one who had shown himself active on the king's side should be eligible for office. He must have exclaimed with Perth: \"If this be what you call liberty, God give me the old slavery again.\"[197] He heard that among the nobles there were many who, whatever their past attitude, now saw with alarm the road which Argyll was taking. His one hope was Charles. He alone, if he clearly understood the situation, had the power of making it clear to Parliament and checking this drift towards oligarchy. Twice he wrote from prison praying for an interview with the king, that he might reveal matters \"which not only concerned his honour in a high degree, but also the standing or falling of his crown.\"[198] These matters could only have been Hamilton's previous duplicity and Argyll's present ambitions. The third time he put his cards on the table, and on 11th October offered to prove that Hamilton was a traitor to the commonwealth. Charles was impressed, and prepared to lay the business before the Chancellor and others of the Privy Council.\n\nBut in the meantime there had begun the curious performance known to history as the \"Incident\"a thing as obscure in its origins as the Popish Plot. For some weeks there had been a mysterious influx of armed men into the capital, against which Loudoun, on 5th October, had warned Parliament.[199] We know that Hamilton and Argyll had 5,000 of their friends, and in[133] the other faction Lord Ker, Roxburgh's son, had 600 Borderers. On the evening of 11th October, the day on which Montrose's third letter was received, Hamilton went to the king in the garden of Holyrood, complained of being traduced, and asked permission to leave the court.[200] Next day Charles told this story to Parliament, but on that morning Hamilton, Argyll, and Lanark had retired to the Hamilton house of Kinneil, near Bo'ness. Their story was that they had learned through Leslie that there was a plot against their lives.[201] For a day or two king and Parliament faced each other in a strange mood, the former protesting with tears against the insult done to his honour, the latter in complete bewilderment. A Committee of the Estates investigated the business, and Montrose's correspondence with the king was laid before them; but no definite conclusion was reached, and the truth must remain one of the secrets of history.\n\nCharles was clearly innocent; so was Montrose, who at the time was close in prison. No doubt there were nobles, such as Ker and Crawford, with bands of retainers at their heels, who would gladly have taken the old Scots way of settling matters with their enemies. There were others, such as Carnwath, who made no secret of their view that there were now three kings in Scotland, and that two of them could be dispensed with. But the study of the confused evidence leaves a strong impression that the whole affair was a trick, a device of Hamilton's and Argyll's to escape from the difficulties in which Montrose's third letter might have placed them. Argyll was a master of electioneering ingenuities, and he knew that the suspicion of being in peril is a supreme asset to a leader. The impression abides, too, that there was an agent provocateur at work behind the scenes, and this may well have been William Murray, a gentleman of the king's bedchamber, the son of the minister of Dysart and the nephew of Montrose's[134] friend, the minister of Methven. Beginning as the king's whipping-boy, he was to finish his career as Earl of Dysart, and the father-in-law of Lauderdale. By general consent he was one of the most degraded characters of the age, and he was already suspect of meddling with the king's letters; it is at least possible that the Incident was mainly his work, a bogus conspiracy staged to give Hamilton the chance of discrediting his opponents.[202]\n\n1641-42\n\nOn 28th October, while the Incident was at its height, the king was playing golf at Leith, when a letter was put into his hands. It contained the news of the outbreak of the Irish rebellion. In a week the atmosphere in both England and Scotland had become tense and ominous, fear of popery spread like a flame, and the king's enemies had no need to create suspicion, for suspicion rose like a mist from every corner of the land. Charles could not linger in the north. On 18th November, at eight o'clock in the morning, he rode south, leaving for ever the country which he had so loved and misgoverned. He departed with a lavish shower of honours. Henderson was made dean of the Chapel Royal at Holyrood, Wariston was knighted, Loudoun and Leslie[203] became earls, and Argyll was made a marquis.[204] The day before the king left, Montrose and his friends were released on probation, and in March 1642 the case against them was finally closed.[135] The four gentlemen, who had been five months in prison without trial, were informed that they owed their escape only to the clemency of Argyll. Montrose had engaged, ingenuously and amateurishly, in the difficult game of subterranean Scottish politics, and had taken a heavy fall. The new marquis could afford to be generous to an antagonist whom, in the business of plots and counterplots, he had so signally outplayed.\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE RUBICON\n\n(1642-44)\n\nIn all questions of wide and deep interest it is scarcely less than a fatal necessity that the best cause should be the worst defended; the consequence of which is, the temporary victory of the false and the superficial, and its establishment in the chair of learned as well as popular opinion. The cause is in the instinct of the mind to aim at the highest in the first instanceand hence with imperfect means, and in the absence of all the main conditions of its attainment.\n\n—Coleridge, Notes, Theological, Political, and Miscellaneous.\n\nI\n\n1640-41\n\nDuring these years of ineffectual politics, Montrose, in his long journeys and in quiet hours of retreat at Kincardine, was steadfastly endeavouring to clarify his own mind. Some time between the autumn of 1640 and the summer of 1641 he set down his views on the principles of government in a letter to a \"noble sir,\" who may have been Lord Napier or Drummond of Hawthornden. The paper was found by Mark Napier in a small quarto in the handwriting of Robert Wodrow, and is among the manuscripts in the National Library of Scotland.[205] It is one of those confessions of faith by which, at all periods in history, sorely perplexed men have striven to ease their souls. The seventeenth century saw no more searching political treatise, for it reveals a capacity for abstract thought rare at any time in a man of action, and especially rare in an era when, as soon as the lists were set, half-truths were vested with the authority of Sinai.\n\nHe begins by laying down a doctrine of Sovereign Power. If a land is to [137]be stably governed there must be some unquestioned centre of authority which he calls Sovereignty, \"a power over the people, above which power there is none on earth.\" It is limited indeedby the laws of God and nature, the laws of nations, and the fundamental laws of the country; but these limitations are moral, religious, and constitutional, and inherent in its very being; it cannot be limited by division among competing authorities. Springing ultimately from a free people, it may in practice be delegated to a king, as in Britain; a council of nobles, as in Venice; or the estates of the people, as in ancient Rome. It \"cannot subsist in a body composed of individuities\"; if it is \"divided amongst several bodies there is no government, as if there were many kings in one kingdom there should be none at all.\"\n\nMontrose holds no brief for monarchy, except in so far as it is the form of sovereignty which has been accepted by the British people. He proceeds to analyse the nature of kingship. It is strong when it is temperate and recognizes its moral and constitutional limitations. \"It is weak . . . when it is extended beyond the laws whereby it is bounded; which could never be at any time endured by the people of the western part of the world, and by those of Scotland as little as any.\" But the ills flowing from undue restraint are not less than the ills which spring from undue extension. No section of the people can seize a part of sovereignty, for, if sovereignty be divided, there follows anarchy, \"the oppression and tyranny of subjects, the most fierce, insatiable, and insufferable tyranny in the world.\" He desires free and frequent parliaments and stern dealing with any law-breaking king; but he insists that, when sovereignty has been granted on conditions, it must be inviolable so long as these conditions are observed. Parliaments are guardians of the subjects' liberties, but not less of the delegated rights of the sovereign king.\n\nHe passes to the menaces to sovereigntyand therefore the causes of anarchyand he finds them in \"the ambitious designs of rule in great men, veiled under the specious pretext of religion and the subjects' liberti[138]es, seconded with the arguments and false positions of seditious precedence: first, that the king is ordained for the people, and the end is more noble than the means; second, that the constituter is superior to the constituent; third, that the king and people are two contraries, like the two scales of a balancewhen the one goes up the other goes down; fourth, that the prince's prerogative and the people's privilege are incompatible; fifth, that what power is taken from the king is added to the Estates of the people.\" On this text he preaches an acute sermon. The two first points, as he explains them, do not mean that he holds that there is any absolutism in a free monarchy, but that, the choice of monarchy having been made by the people, such monarchy, which is their own creation, must be reasonably exalted, since in its exaltation lies their security. With the fear of the encroachments of the nobility and the Kirk in his mind, he appeals to the commons of Scotland:\n\nIt is the old profound lesson of history, eternally taught and eternally forgotten. After anarchy comes the dictator; the successors of the Gracchi are the Cæsars; the fury of the French Revolution is stamped out by Napoleon; the confusion of a Russia emancipa[139]ted from her old masters is imperfectly disciplined by a harsher tyranny. In the England of that moment the \"One\" of whom he prophesied was already walking about in his sober country clothes and great buff boots. Montrose, it is to be noted, preaches the organic nature of the State to the common people, but to the Kirk and the nobility he addresses a different argument. He only warns them that their ambition will failthe preachers, that the nobles will use them for their own interest, \"as a cunning tennis-player lets a ball go to the wall where it cannot stay, that he may take it at the bound with more ease\"; the nobles, that, like Æsop's dog, they will lose the substance for the shadow in the well. It would seem that he had made up his mind that the Kirk and the aristocracy were no longer amenable to reason.\n\nWe must be on our guard against reading into this philosophy of politics more than Montrose intended. If he saw beyond his age, he was also the child of that age. Much in his creed is not new. Fortescue in the fifteenth century had laid down the doctrine of constitutional monarchy. \"The King of England cannot alter nor change the Lawes of the Realme at his pleasure; for why, he governeth his people by power, not only royall but politique.\" The Tudor monarchs had established the principle of an indivisible sovereignty by suppressing local immunities and crushing all rival authorities. But Montrose shows in many respects a startling originality, especially as contrasted with the writers of his own political party. He does not, like James I., identify sovereignty with monarchy;[207] he is willing to accept any form of government, provided it fulfils the requirements which are indispensable in all governments. Unlike his friend Drummond of Hawthornden, he has none of the contemporary belief in Divine Right, and he is no advocate of passive obedience.[208] He is primarily a realist, and he is curiously free from mediæval ideas on monarchy or on religion. His central principle may[140] deduce from Bodin, but its application was based upon his personal observation of Scots affairs.\n\nTo orientate his political creed in relation to his age would require a treatise. Many philosophers of diverse schools, like Hobbes and Milton, accepted his doctrine of sovereignty. Montrose did not go into the metaphysics of political origins, the question which has agitated thinkers from Aristotle to Rousseau, whether the title to rule be natural or conventional. He would have accepted Hooker's view that sovereignty should be founded on consent, and while agreeing with Milton that sovereignty is from the people, he would have shrunk from Milton's addendum that the popular liberty of decision is only to be respected so long as the people accept a particular creed.[209] In the realism of his method of thought he has affinities with Hobbes, but not in his conclusion: he has much in common with Samuel Rutherford, whose Lex Rex, published in 1644, lays down the thesis that sovereignty comes from the people, who may, in time of extreme necessity, resume this power, and nothing in common with Sir George Mackenzie, whose reply to Buchanan's De Jure Regni[210] is a proof of the extravagant lengths to which a Scot could go in defending the alien dogma of Divine Right. His doctrine of sovereignty is at the opposite pole from that of Strafford, who believed that the security of a nation depended in emergencies upon an executive authority above and outside the ordinary law, an inalienable and overriding prerogativea view which in one form is a truism to-day, but which in the seventeenth century, if generally accepted, would have put an end to popular liberties.[141]\n\nBut Montrose is not a metaphysician. He is a student of history and an observer of facts. His inquiry is a practical onehow to stave off anarchy, and the maxims which he offers have their direct contemporary applications. He is modern in his doctrine of the organic unity of the State, but in two matters he is very clearly of his age.\n\nThe first is his attitude towards parliamentary government. \"It is curious to observe,\" says Coleridge of the early seventeenth century, \"that the thinner the realm was (the less both in wealth and influence, and the less they were diffused) the greater was the division of power.\"[211] In the constitution of that age there was no clear determination of function between the executive, the judiciary, and the legislature. \"The 'rule of law,' which the power of the state existed to enforce, worked through no specialized machinery, the organization was still fluid, only here and there hardening into conventions. . . . The conception of an exclusive sovereignty, inherent in any one branch of the Constitution, was still far distant.\"[212] In strict theory, the true sovereign was the law fundamental, the \"law of the land,\" which was regarded as beyond the reach of legislative change. Magna Charta had been a solemn embodiment of one portion of that law. In 1604 the Speaker of the House of Commons divided the laws into (1) the Common law, not mutable; (2) the Positive law, to be altered by the occasion of the times; (3) customs and usages which have time's approbation. The distinction appears in Sir Walter Raleigh's Prerogative of Parliaments; Sir Edward Coke maintained that the function of king and parliament was not jus dare but jus dicereto declare the law; in 1659 Nicholas Bacon told Richard Cromwell's Parliament that, as regarded bicameral government, \"long usage hath so settled it, as Acts of Parliament cannot alter it.\" The doctrine of the legislative supremacy of Parliament was still in the womb of time.[213]\n\n[142]\n\nMontrose held firmly to this conception of a law immutable and fundamental; it was the code to which both he and Charles appealed at their trials, and it moulded his view of sovereignty. With this adamantine sanction in the background, which no other power could change, he was compelled to think of a constitution as a thing of delicate balances, of authority as a commodity scrupulously weighed out and studiously limited, and of a central delegated sovereignty as inhering in a monarch rather than in any Parliament. National health, he maintained, depended, like bodily health, upon each member playing its own part without encroachment. The monarchy seemed to him the most vital part of a nicely adjusted mechanism, since upon its proper functioning the working of all other parts specially depended. He places the emphasis on the Crown, though he gives it no autocracy. He could not foresee that this delicate adjustment would end in stagnation, and that in a later age it would be necessary to aggrandize the power of one part in order to make the wheels revolve. It was difficult for any thinker of his time to accept the legislative sovereignty of Parliament, to which the Long Parliament tried to feel its waythe notion of the \"law fundamental\" forbade it; but it was doubly difficult for Montrose. For the Parliament which he knew was the Scots Parliament, with its bad traditions of incompetence and servility. It may be that Argyll had a vision of parliamentary government denied to his contemporaries, but it was a vision, for a sober survey of the facts seemed to render it impossible. A wise and impartial king might hold the balance between conflicting interests, but the Scots Parliament, swung alternately between Kirk and nobles, would, if unfettered, produce only despotism or anarchy.\n\nThe second matter in which Montrose is a man of his time, is his attitude towards what we call democracy. He believed that from the whole nation came the sanction of sovereignty, but he was not a democrat [143]in the modern sense, for the common people in his day were scarcely conscious of political rights, and asked rather to be wisely protected than to be endowed with ill-understood duties. But, both in his theory and in his practice, he was more democratic than most of his generation. He held that the laws were the only safeguard of the plain man, the true monarch of which the king was but the creature. He saw that any disturbance of the equipoise in the distribution of public duties would not add to popular liberties, but, by increasing confusion, would augment the power of this or that oligarchical faction. He heldand what student of the period will dissent?that the contemporary commons of Scotland were \"more incapable of sovereignty than any other known.\" The people, as a political force, did not come within the imagination of seventeenth-century Britain. \"They care not what Government they live under,\" said Haselrig, \"so as they may plough and go to market.\"[214] The proletariat was as meaningless a thing to Cromwell and Vane as it was to Strafford and Clarendon, and the creed of the Leveller was as hateful to the Puritan as to the Cavalier. Indeed it may be said that the silent masses had more to gain from king than from Parliament, for it was the Crown which, in Star Chamber and Council, did its best to check enclosure, protect tenant right, and maintain wages. Montrose, with his doctrine of the organic unity of the State, and his constant appeal to the \"mean people,\" came nearer democracy, it may be argued, than most of his contemporaries.[215]\n\nThe purpose of human government is to give to the citizen a free, a secure, and an ordered life. The means of effecting this purpose will vary from age to age and from nation to nation, but one essential will always remainan effective central power \"to unite and incorporate the members into one body politic that, with joint endeavour and abilities, they may the better[144] advance the common good,\" and this central power must spring from the goodwill of the people at large. Montrose found it in a constitutional monarchy such as he conceived it. \"He who keeps watch and ward for freedom,\" Coleridge has written, \"has to guard against two enemies, the despotism of the few and the despotism of the many.\"[216] The second peril in Montrose's day had not arisen, but the first was an ever-present menace, whether it took the form of an aristocratic or an ecclesiastical junta. The truth of his doctrine is not affected by the fact that Britain found a solution by other methods than those which he foreshadowed. The hope of a popular monarchy shipwrecked on the character of Charles, and a religious quarrel in which civil politics were fatally compromised. If Montrose did not foresee either modern parliamentaryism or modern democracy, he foresaw the principle which alone gives them value. They are but means to an end, and to-day, when parliamentary government has lost much of its glamour, and criticism is revealing as mere expedients certain democratic dogmas which once seemed eternal truths, we are being driven back again to the fundamentals.\n\nOpen Burke anywhere. \"I see no other way for the preservation of a decent attention to public interest in the representatives, but the interposition of the body of the people itself, whenever it shall appear, by some flagrant and notorious act, by some capital innovation, that the representatives are going to overleap the fences of the law, and to introduce an arbitrary power.\"[217] It is Montrose's defence, first for signing the National Covenant, and then for taking up arms against the Covenanters. \"Here it says to an encroaching prerogative, 'Your sceptre has its length, you cannot add a hair to your head or a gem to your crown but what an eternal law has given to it!' Here it says to an overweening peerage, 'Your pride finds banks that it cannot overflow.' Here to a tumultuous and giddy people, 'There is a bed to the raging sea.'\"[218] I[145]t is Montrose's conception of constitutional law. Or again, \"If civil society be the offspring of convention, that convention must be its law. That convention must limit and modify all the descriptions of constitutions which are formed under it. Every sort of legislative, judicial, or executive power are its creatures. They can have no being in any other state of things; and how can any man claim, under the convention of civil society, rights which do not so much as suppose its existencerights which are absolutely repugnant to it.\"[219] It is Montrose's case against the encroachments of the Kirk. He saw that in a stable government the supreme power, while it must be delegated, cannot be made divisible. The Kirk was willing enough to accept the doctrine of popular sovereignty, but it did not grasp the inevitable conclusionthat the people cannot entrust this power to two conflicting authorities which may both claim to represent them. Church and State cannot rule conjointly over the same sphere and under the same sanctions. Montrose took the historical as opposed to the metaphysical view of human institutions, and, moreover, in his practical interpretation he curiously anticipated the modern attitude. He could have little part in an age when most men believed that kings and churches and aristocracies were mystically ordained of God.\n\n* * * * *\n\n1640-42\n\nFrom his first entry into public life Montrose was at variance with the bulk of the Scottish nobility, but it seems certain that he began with a real enthusiasm for the Kirk, of which he was a ruling elder. So long as it stood for spiritual freedom he was its fervent champion, and this championship, as we have seen, led him occasionally into courses which were contrary to his political creed. He had a reverence for godliness, and from such a man as Alexander Henderson he differed with profound reluctance. His personal religion was the Calvinism of his age, but he had reached it, not [146]by the rigid schedule of grim \"experiences\" laid down by the Scottish divines, but by the gentler Platonic method, whereby God reveals Himself insensibly through the riches of His world, and piety crowns like a flower the natural growth of mind and soul.[220] He had the latitude of Hales or Chillingworth about inessentials, and his creed was that of the great saying of Symmachus: \"Uno itinere non potest pervenire ad tam grande secretum.\" His condemnation was reserved for those who forgot the spirit in the letter and made religion a thing of scholastic subtleties. His affinities were with men like the Cambridge Platonists, whose Calvinism was mellowed and warmed by the love of humanity and of all things true and beautiful. He would have agreed with Whichcote that Christ is magister vitæ non scholæ, and that he is \"the best Christian whose heart beats with the truest pulse towards heaven, not he whose head spinneth out the finest cobwebs.\" He had Whichcote's stalwart respect for the freedom of the mind. When later he criticized the teaching of the Scottish divines, it was on the ground of their narrow legalism and their spiritual pride.[221]\n\nThe event which compelled his final breach with the Kirk was its growing alliance, under Henderson's leadership, with the Parliamentary party in England, of which the price was to be the establishment of Pres[147]bytery south of the Tweed. The policy, which culminated in the Solemn League and Covenant, is capable of defence from the point of view of the perplexed Scottish divines. The Kirk held that Presbytery was a jus divinum, and it had the mediæval belief in religious uniformity as the foundation of political unity. It had suffered grievously from prelatical encroachments, and the impetus for such encroachments had come from England; its liberties could only be safeguarded if England were brought to its own way of thinking. Moreover, the Counter-Reformation was making huge strides on the continent of Europe, and it could be resisted only if there were the closest unity among all the reformed Churches; and this seemed to involve the abolition of Anglican anomalies and the reshaping of English Protestantism according to the universal Protestant pattern.\n\nA man like Henderson was too wise to believe that he could force Presbytery upon an unwilling England. \"We do not presume,\" he wrote, \"to propose the government of the Church of Scotland as a pattern for the Church of England, we do only represent in all modesty these few considerations according to the trust committed to us.\" The change must come willingly from within, and he believed that the greater part of the Anglican Church desired it.[222] He was misled by his English correspondents; he did nothe could notrealize that the great bulk of the English people disliked Laud and the Anglican extremists, but were attached to a moderate episcopacy, that the Presbyterian majority in Parliament was not the English nation, that English Presbyterianism was very different from Scottish, and that even among the declared opponents of the king and the bishops there were many stalwart Erastians of the Selden type, who would not suffer an ecclesiastical discipline uncontrolled by the civil law. Had Henderson had this knowledge, it is certain that one who sought above all things the unity and peace of the two peoples would have refrained from a policy[148] which was to be the fruitful mother of strife. But there were few ministers with Henderson's sagacity. To most, the bringing of England into conformity with their own communion was a direct command of God, and they devoted themselves to the task with a fanatic missionary zeal. The new Covenant became a mystical compact with the Almighty, its acceptance the test of holiness, its rejection or breach a certain proof of damnation. It was to be attended by \"the voice of harpers harping with their harps, which shall fill the whole island with melody and mirth.\" Civil statesmanship disappears in such a mood, and all that remains is a frantic theocracy.[223] The Kirk, whose spiritual rights had been threatened by Charles, was now, in the enthusiasm of a regained independence, proposing to encroach upon the sphere of secular government.\n\nTo Montrose, with his modern conception of the State, both Kirk and nobles seemed to be marching the straight road to anarchy. The National Covenant had been an assertion of unquestioned civil and religious liberties, a united nation, with a reverent acknowledgment of their Maker, recalling their king to the true doctrine of kingship. But, in the Solemn League now preparing, the Kirk had gone far beyond her lawful sphere. He knew the people of England, and realized that the acceptance by the English Parliament of Henderson's scheme could only be a price paid for alliance in rebellion. His way and the Kirk's had come to a sharp parting. The king, in spite of former blunders, was now constitutionally in the right, and if war came it was for Montrose, and for all lovers of law and liberty, to support the central power agains[149]t anarchic usurpation. If he erred in his view of Charles's character and aims, the error was justifiable, for in the past three years the king had appeared to yield all that the National Covenant had demanded, and to have assented to that historic constitutionalism which Argyll and the Kirk were now denying by word and deed.\n\nThe alternative, as Montrose saw it, was a theocracy on a feudal basis, an omnipotent Kirk and a free license to a corrupt and turbulent aristocracy, provided that aristocracy remained orthodox. How would the \"mean people\" of Scotland fare under such a régime? Quicquid delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi. He looked around, and saw the wretchedness of their condition. Throughout all his writings and declarations there rings a note of pity for the common folk, who had to bear the brunt of their rulers' folly. \"Ye have oppressed the poor, and violently perverted judgment and justice\"so ran his last tremendous indictment. Public morals were at a low ebb;[224] nor was there any revival of true spiritual life, such as had at other times attended a season of religious wars. The hungry sheep were fed with windy politics. Let us take one witness, the celebrated Mr. Robert Law, a stout Covenanter who was ejected from his church in 1662 after the Restoration. \"From the year 1652,\" he writes, \"to the year 1660, there was great good done by the preaching of the Gospel in the west of Scotland, more than was observed to have been for twenty or thirty years before; a great many brought in to Christ Jesus by the saving work of conversion, which was occasioned through ministers preaching nothing all that time but the Gospel, and had left off to preach up parliaments, armies, leagues, resolutions, and remonstrances.\"[225] The use of the Lord's Prayer was condemned by some zealots as being too much of a \"set form.\"[226] Private meetings for devotion were discouraged as savouring of schisma strange policy for a church which owned Livingstone and[150] Samuel Rutherford. Religion was in danger of ceasing to be a quickening spirit, and of becoming a hortus siccus of withered pedantries. Of the Kirk now dominant in Scotland, Cromwell, after Dunbar, had certain truths to proclaim. \"By your hard and subtle words,\" he told the ministers, \"you have begotten prejudice in those who do too much in matters of consciencewherein every soul has to answer for itself to Goddepend upon you. Your own guilt is too much for you to bear.... Is it therefore infallibly agreeable to the Word of God, all that you say? I beseech you in the bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken. There may be a Covenant made with Death and Hell.\"[227]\n\n1642\n\nAs his path became clearer before him, Montrose, after his fashion at a crisis in his life, was moved to one of his rare exercises in verse. He had much leisure during these months, and spent it at his house of Kincardine with his wife and his sons, of whom the eldest was now a boy of twelve. Thither came a pleasant company of neighbours and kinsfolk, Napiers, Erskines, and Stirlings, and the old hall by the Ruthven Water heard for the last time the sound of young voices and children's play. At this period he must have written the lyric by which his name is best known in our literature. It is a love song, but it is addressed to the eyebrows of no mortal Sylvia. In his youth ladies had written him verses, but his marriage was the one romance of his life, and, in spite of the jealous inquisition of the Kirk, no affair of gallantry was ever linked with his name. In his ballad the ardour of the patriot is joined to the passion of the lover in singing of his mistress, Scotland, and what he will do for her if she trusts him. It breathes the same spirit as his \"Discourse of Sovereignty,\" a hatred of sectarian war, a plea for the unity which had long fled from his distracted land. Almost every metaphor is drawn from the language of contemporary politics, but[151] that language is warmed and coloured by a passion of loyaltyto an ideal rather than to a person, for with Montrose, in Plato's words, the quest of truth did not lack the warmth of desire.\n\n\"My dear and only love, I pray\n\nThat little world of thee\n\nBe governed by no other sway\n\nThan purest monarchy;\n\nFor if confusion have a part,\n\nWhich virtuous souls abhor,\n\nAnd hold a Synod in thine heart,\n\nI'll never love thee more.\n\nAs Alexander I will reign,\n\nAnd I will reign alone;\n\nMy thoughts did evermore disdain\n\nA rival on my throne.\n\nHe either fears his fate too much,\n\nOr his deserts are small,\n\nThat dares not put it to the touch,\n\nTo win or lose it all.\n\n. . . . .\n\nAnd in the Empire of thine heart\n\nWhere I should solely be,\n\nIf others do pretend a part\n\nOr dare to vie with me,\n\nOr if Committees thou erect,\n\nAnd go on such a score,\n\nI'll laugh and sing at thy neglect,\n\nAnd never love thee more.\n\nBut if thou wilt prove faithful then,\n\nAnd constant of thy word,\n\nI'll make thee glorious by my pen,\n\nAnd famous by my sword;\n\nI'll serve thee in such noble ways\n\nWas never heard before;\n\nI'll crown and deck thee all with bays,\n\nAnd love thee more and more.\"[228]\n\nThis is the song of a man who has at last found assurance, the confession of a soul which has a vision of a noble purpose, and holds no risk too high in its attainment.\n\nII\n\nMontrose was soon to be called to witness to his faith. Charles returned to London from Scotland in November 1641, to be confronted with the Grand Remonstrance, which demanded a government responsible to Parliament, and the summoning of an assembly of divines to settle the religious problem. On January 4, 1642, he was guilty of a supreme blunder when, on his queen's advice, he attempted to enter the Commons and arrest the Five Members. Six days later he left London, to which he was not destined to return till he returned to die. The last hope of a peaceful settlement had gone, and both sides began the raising of armiesthe Parliament by ordinances, and the king by commissions of array. On 23rd April Sir John Hotham shut the gates of Hull in Charles's face, and civil war began. On 22nd August the royal standard was set up at Nottingham, and in that month and from that place the king wrote to Montrose:\n\nIt would have been well for Charles had he trusted Mo[153]ntrose in Scots affairs. But Hamilton, as we know from Clarendon, had given him assurances that \"he would at least keep that people from doing anything that might seem to countenance the carriage of the Parliament,\" and it was to Hamilton that Murray went. In the previous November the king had appealed to the Scottish Privy Council for help in dealing with the Irish rebellion. The Council responded by an energetic levy of troops, the first batch of which went to Ulster in February 1642, and sent Lothian and Lindsay to London to attempt to mediate between king and Parliament. Scotland found herself courted diligently by both sides, and returned evasive answers. A special meeting of the Council was held in May 1642, when Montrose and his friends endeavoured to induce it to stand to its many pledges and refrain from assisting the Parliament with arms. The presence of the royalist nobles in Edinburgh raised the usual cry of a design against the lives of the Covenanting leaders, the gentry and clergy of Fife flocked to the capital as a bodyguard for the menaced statesmen, and the Privy Council was confirmed in its cautious detachment.[230]\n\nBut this detachment could not be kept up for ever. In July the General Assembly met in St. Andrews, when king and Parliament renewed their solicitations to the body which especially represented the opinion of Scotland. The English Puritans did not ask for a definite alliance, but they declared their detestation of the English episcopacy, and their earnest desire for \"an advancement of the true religion and such a reformation of the Church as should be made agreeable to God's Word.\" This gave the Assembly its cue; \"agreeable to God's Word\" must mean Presbyterianism; so it petitioned the king to labour for \"blessed unity in religion, and uniformity of Church government\"in other words, the establishment of Presbytery in England. Argyll was in command at St. Andrews, and ruled the Assembly as he ruled the Scottish Parliament. When Murray arrived in the early autumn, he found Hamilton living in Argyll's company, and negotiating a marriage between his eldest daughter and Lord Lorn.[154] The Assembly's appeal brought a reply in September, for the English Parliament voted unanimously that the present government of the Church of England must be abolished, and that the national Church must be reconstructed with the aid of an assembly of divines. This seemed to grant to the Kirk what it had been seekingthe end of the hated episcopacy, and Presbytery established from Devon to Caithness. Small wonder that it leaned to the Parliament's side, and that the Scottish people, whom it controlled, had the same bias.\n\nMeantime Edgehill had been fought, and in November the Parliament applied to Scotland for aid. Charles replied with a defence of his policy, and Hamilton, roused out of his dreams by the sudden crisis, and anxious at least to save his country from naked rebellion, persuaded the Privy Council to publish the royal declaration. But Argyll insisted that the English Parliament's appeal should also be published, and there was the usual game of petition and counter-petition, in which Argyll won. That of Traquair and Hamilton asked no more than that Scotland should do nothing to commit itself to the path of disloyalty and civil war.[231] That such a policy should have been vehemently opposed both by the Assembly and the Estates shows how Scottish opinion had hardened against the king.\n\n1642-43\n\nIt was high time that Charles should know the factsthat from Scotland would come no aid for his cause, but only augmentation to his enemiesfor he could learn nothing from the vain and obtuse Hamilton. An effort had been made to draw Montrose again into the Covenant camp. He had no following among either nobles or people, but his opponents appreciated the strength of his character and his talents for war, and he was offered, if he would join them, the lieutenant-generalship of the army, and, says Wishart, \"quæcunque alia quæ suæ forent potestatis.\"[232] The offer must have come from Argyll, who had the wits to recognize ability, who desired to have on his side a military[155] genius which he did not himself possess and which he may well have believed to be superior to old Leven's, and who must have noted Montrose's sincere attachment to Presbytery and the reluctance with which he differed from the Kirk. If Hamilton was privy to it, it can only have been because he desired to compromise one whom he hated, for his shallow mind still held to the belief that he could keep Scotland out of the war. The incident forced Montrose to be up and doing. The royal cause at the moment was not unprosperous in the field. In spite of the check at Turnham Green, Charles had consolidated his position in the Oxford district, Newcastle was firm in Yorkshire, and Hopton had cleared the south-west. The way to London might soon be open unless the Scots army took the royalists in flank from the north. The peril from Scotland must at once be made known to the king.\n\nIn February 1643 Montrose, with Ogilvy and Aboyne, crossed the Border. The Court was at Oxford, whither Ogilvy and Aboyne repaired, but Montrose, hearing at Newcastle that the queen was arriving from Holland, went to meet her at Bridlington Bay. A year before she had gone to the Hague to sell the crown jewels for munitions of war, and had now returned with stores and money, to be greeted in her bedroom by the round shot of the Parliament fleet. Montrose urged an immediate grant of a royal warrant to authorize a loyal rising in Scotland. He believed that if Charles struck the first blow the opposition might be overawed, or at any rate crippled. Henrietta was too sea-sick and flustered to listen, and told him that she would discuss the matter at York. But to York had posted Hamilton and Traquair with their smooth words, and the distracted lady followed the path of least resistance. Montrose was dismissed as an alarmist, and Hamilton's optimism prevailed.[233]\n\n1643\n\nHe had not long to wait for his vindication. Loudoun, Henderson, and Wariston had gone as a commission to the king at Oxford, to mediate for peace on the basis of Presbyterian uniformity in England, and there Henders[156]on argued the question of episcopacy with no less a person than Jeremy Taylor.[234] The commission asked for a Parliament that summer, though under the grant of triennial parliaments the next did not fall due till June 1644, and this request Charles refused. But Argyll had business on hand which could not wait, and on his own account he arranged for the summoning of a Convention of Estates on June 22, 1643. Here was an act of rebellion as final as Sir John Hotham's, but Hamilton persuaded the king to ignore the breach of prerogative and sanction the meeting, which he himself attended, to watch, as he said, the royal interests.[235] He had just been made a duke, to encourage his slack-lipped loyalty.\n\nMontrose did not attend the Convention. For him and his friends the final parting had come. During the spring of 1643 Argyll's offer had been renewed. He would be given high military command, and his debts, mainly incurred in legal expenses, would be paid if he would join the dominant party. The story reached the ears of the queen, and in a letter of 31st May she offered him arms from Denmark and assured him of her confidence, though she had heard that he had \"struck up an alliance with certain persons that might well create apprehension in my mind.\"[236] In the early days of June Montrose was in the north with Airlie, Huntly, and Marischal, attempting to form a coalitionan attempt frustrated by the lightheadedness of the latter two. This visit seems to have alarmed Argyll, for he made one last desperate bid for Montrose's support. If others were blind to the powers of this young man of thirty, the dictator of Scotland knew capacity when he met it. He was aware that Montrose had been snubbed by the queen, and he hoped to catch him on the rebound. Montrose had not bluntly refused his overtures, but had hinted that certain scruples stood in his way. To solve them, the Moderator of the Kirk, Alexander Henderson, was dispatched to interview the doubter.[157]\n\nOne day in the middle of June he met Montrose in a meadow on the banks of the Forth near Stirling. It was a curious meeting, the embarrassed Sir James Rollo,[237] brother-in-law of both Montrose and Argyll, acting as Henderson's second, and Lord Napier, Lord Ogilvy, and Stirling of Keir being present as witnesses. The Moderator frankly avowed that the Covenanters were about to send an army to England in support of the Parliament, and repeated the old offer. \"Nothing was more earnestly desired than that he should join with his peers and the other estates of the realm; it would bring joy to all, and not only profit, but also honour to himself. His example would at once bring over the few, if there were any, who respected the empty shadow of royalty. As for himself, his most hearty thanks would be due to God if He would deign to make him the minister and mediator of so great a work.\"[238] Montrose asked Rollo if Henderson had authority to make the offer. Rollo said he had, but Henderson said no, but believed that the Convention would substantiate his promises. This gave Montrose the chance to avoid a direct refusal. He replied that in these circumstances he must ask for time to consider, and took a friendly leave of the man in all Scotland from whom he was most loth to differ. They never met again. Three years later, after he had seen Montrose's splendour and decline, as well as the failure of his own hopes, Henderson died. His last words were: \"I am near the end of my race, hasting home, and there was never a schoolboy more desirous to have the play than I am to have leave of this world.\"\n\nBefore the Convention in June, Charles, in a declaration to the peopl[158]e of Scotland, had stated his case against the English Parliament, and had solemnly protested his loyalty to the rights recently assured to the Scottish nation. He was not believed. The war in Ireland had ceased, and the Kirk dreaded that an army might thereby be freed for the defence or restoration of episcopacy. Moreover, Lord Antrim, whose incompetence rivalled Hamilton's in every field of action, had got himself captured in Ulster, along with a budget of letters from Nithsdale, Aboyne, and others. There seemed a risk of a popish invasion. Scotland was to be overrun by Irish kerns, Charles was to join hands with Nithsdale on the Solway, Macdonalds and Macleans were to harass the Campbells, and Huntly and Montrose were to fire the north. Montrose's recent visit to Aberdeen seemed to give authority to the tale.[239] Moreover, things were going ill with the English Parliament. In June John Hampden had fallen on Chalgrove Field, and Fairfax had been defeated in Yorkshire at Adwalton Moor; in the south-west Hopton had cleared Devon, and in July scattered Waller's forces at Landsdown and Round way Down, while Bristol, the second port of the kingdom, was about to fall to Prince Rupert. To Baillie it seemed that \"for the present the Parliament side is running down the brae.\" But the Covenanters had gone too far to draw back: the triumph of the king meant in their eyes summary vengeance on those who had intrigue with his enemies.\n\nFormerly the English Parliament had asked chiefly for a deputation of divines, but in August commissioners from the English House, among them the younger Vane,[240] arrived to ask for an army. The General Assembly met on 2nd August in a small room in the east kirk of St. Giles, and to Convention and Assembly was presented the English demand. The request for 11,000 troops was complied with, Lanark using the royal seal for a warrant which levied war[159] against its owner, and the price of this support, a new bond to bind still closer the two countries, was drafted by Wariston and Henderson. This document, the Solemn League and Covenant, was accepted by the Estates, and ratified at Westminster by what was left of the English House, being thereafter solemnly subscribed in St. Margaret's Church on September 25, 1643. On 13th October it was sworn by the Estates and the Assembly, and later by the Scottish people in the parish kirks. It was signed by English Parliamentarians, because it was the price of the sorely needed Scottish help. It was extensively signed in Scotland, because the authorities saw to it that those who did not sign should suffer in person and estate.[241]\n\nThe Kirk had seized the chance to realize its dream of uniformity, but the dream came through the gates of horn, and was to vanish ere morning. In return Kirk and nobility had involved their land in a course of hypocrisy and dishonour. They wished both to have their cake and eat it; in the Solemn League and Covenant, of which the price was armed rebellion, they vowed also to \"preserve and defend the king's majesty's person and authority.\" They had broken a plain contract with the king; was it any defence to say that they feared lest Charles at some future date might break his contract with them? Montrose, the day before his death, put the point to his inquisitors. \"When the king had granted you all your desires, and you were every one sitting under his vine and under his fig-tree, that then you should have taken a party in England by the hand, and entered into a league and covenant with them against the king, was the thing I judged it my duty to oppose to the yondmost.\"[242] It was not as if the Scots were republicans or shared the advanced constitutional views of certain of the Parliamentarians. They were almost to a man confused and sentimental royalists, and they had been granted every liberty which they had asked for. The verdict of history must[160] be that for the sake of an ecclesiastical whimsy the bulk of the nation chose the path of civic dishonour. The question was not of the relative wisdom of monarchist or Parliamentarian doctrines, but of Scotland forswearing a creed, which she avowedly and sincerely held, for the bribe of a futile dream.\n\nTo Montrose the way was clear. To him it seemed that towards Scotland the king had behaved, though tardily, with justice and generosity, and had been rewarded by flagrant bad faith. Apart from the matter of personal honour, he believed that the path which the Covenant had chosen led only to anarchy and an ultimate tyranny. Every article of his political philosophy was at stake. The one hope seemed to lie in Charles's success. He set off at once for the south, and reached Oxford some time in August. The king had gone to the siege of Gloucester, and Montrose found that he could do nothing with the queen. Her trust in Hamilton was unshaken, and on 28th August she wrote to him reaffirming her confidence.[243] He then sought the king at Gloucester, but the courtiers persuaded Charles that the young man was an alarmist, and that the scheme he proposed was moonshine. Meantime the Solemn League and Covenant had been ratified, Leven was mustering his men, and every day the chance of forestalling him grew more slender. In an agony of anxiety Montrose pled and expostulated.\n\nBut as the autumn passed and the king returned to Oxford to winter, the letters of Hamilton and Lanark took a new tone. They confessed that the game was up, that they had been deceived, that Leven was on the eve of marching. Charles sent for Montrose at last and listened to his plan, and Antrim, who had escaped from captivity, was at hand to promise support. In December the Hamiltons came to Oxford to brazen it out, and found their conduct the subject of a commission of inquiry. There could be no question of the verdict. Montrose and Aboyne, Nithsdale, Kinnoull,[244] and Ogilvy were there to testify to a long course of double-dealing, supine[161]ness, and folly, which was only saved from being flat treason by the mental confusion of those who pursued it. Hamilton was arrested and sent a prisoner to Pendennis castle in Cornwall; Lanark escapedfirst to London, where he shared the bed and board of Mr. Robert Baillie, and then to the Covenant army. At long last the king turned to the only man who could give him hope.\n\n1644\n\nMontrose abode with the court at Oxford during the bitter early months of 1644,[245] and elaborated his plans. It seemed a desperate remedy. The only project he could offer was to \"raise Scotland for the king\"; but it seemed as if Scotland had effectively risen for the king's opponents. Leven's blue-bonnets were over the Border, and the whole line of the Marches was controlled by the Covenanters. They held every city and town in Scotland; Parliament and General Assembly alike were their creatures; the revenue of the country was in their hands; the greater part of the nobles had joined their standard. A year ago there had been a chance; now it seemed the wildest of wild ventures. If the Scottish people were tired of their taskmasters they had given no sign of it, and the supposed loyalists, with a few shining exceptions, had proved the most brittle of reeds. Except for Kinnoull, Ogilvy, and Aboyne, Montrose seemed to have no following even among the royalists of his own class. Huntly disliked him, Crawford was jealous of him, Traquair feared him; the nondescripts, like Carnwath, Morton, Southesk, Nithsdale, Roxburgh, and Home, were disinclined to obey a youth.\n\nBut in that strange Oxford, where the colleges had become courts or barracks, and trenches were at the back of Wadham and across St. Giles's, and Rupert and his horse swung over Magdalen Bridge of a morning to raid in the Chilternsan Oxford of junketing and b[162]rawling, hymns and drinking songs, fiery hearts and anxious minds,[246] there were men like Endymion Porter and Digby, men in the inner circle of the royal councils, in whom the grave purpose of the young Scottish earl commanded respect. Among so much that was self-seeking and half-hearted, his ardour was like a sea-wind in a stifling room. They had the wit to recognize that a certain kind of spirit may win against any odds. Hyde, too, was probably his friend. The future Lord Clarendon detested Scotland and all things connected with her, but he loved an honest man and a stout heart; and we know from a letter of Evelyn to Pepys that \"the brave Montrosse\" was one of the portraits in his private cabinet at Cornbury.[247] In any case it was no season for prudence, for Newcastle was in desperate straits in the north. \"I will not,\" said Montrose, \"distrust God's assistance in a righteous cause, and if it shall please your Majesty to lay your commands upon me for this purpose, your affairs will at any rate be in no worse case than they are at present, even if I should not succeed.\"\n\nHe asked for little help. Antrim was to raise troops in Ireland and the Isles, and land them in the west of Scotland to keep Argyll occupied in his own country. A body of horse from Newcastle's army would assist him to cut his way through the Lowlands to the Highland line. The King of Denmark might lend some German cavalry, and by hook or by crook a sufficient store of arms and ammunition must be transported to the north.[248] Charles consented, and Antrim was dispatched to Ulster with instructions to land 2,000 troops in Argyll by April 1, 1644.[249] Montrose was offered the commission of viceroy and captain-general of the royal forces in Scotland, but very wisely he declined; the title was bestowed[163] on the king's nephew, Prince Maurice, and Montrose was content to be known as his lieutenant-general. He knew something of the jealous temper of the northern forces, and he had no desire to wreck his expedition on an empty name.[250]\n\nThe six years of waiting were ended. The fates had cleared the stage, and the waverer had an issue of his perplexities. Words were to give place to deeds; the narrow streets of Edinburgh and the heavy air of conventions and assemblies to the clean winds and the wide spaces of the hills. He had before him a straight path of duty, and little it troubled him that it ran into dark shadows. Once more he had recaptured his boyish ardour, and there was no happier man in the world than Montrose when, on that March morning, with the ash buds black in St. John's gardens, he rode north out of Oxford to win a kingdom.\n\nBOOK II—ACTION\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE CURTAIN RISES\n\n(March 1644August 1644)\n\nWorcester.

It seemed the wildest of gambles against impossible odds. In the true knight-errant fashion Charles had given him a sword engraved with the arms of the flower of his race, Prince Henry,[251] but he could give him little more. Montrose was to raise Scotland for the king, but where was he to find an army? The best of the semi-professional levies were with Leven in the north of England. The soldiers of fortune from the German wars were already for the most part under Leven's banner. He could get nothing from the towns and villages of the Lowlands, for, whatever the feeling of the people, the Kirk and the Estates had a firm control of the machinery of enlistment. As for the nobles, the most powerful were Covenanters, and even if it had been otherwise, were far too jealous and self-centred to follow a young man of no higher rank than their own in a cau[168]se which was, at the best, forlorn. Did he hope that his words of wisdom, his far-sighted political doctrines, would carry conviction to a backward peasantry, harassed by temporal want on the one side and the fear of eternal punishment on the other? Besides, he proposed to bring Antrim's Irishry to his aid, and Antrim's Irishry, though most of them were Scots, seemed to the Lowlands so many emissaries of the Pope and the devil. With such allies he would not attract a single doubting Presbyterian to his standard.\n\nAs in most great adventures, there was no solid hope save in the soul of the adventurer. In a desperate case the man who risks most is usually the wisest, and Montrose staked everything on the speed and gallantry of his spirit. It seems impossible that at this period he can have intended to raise the Highlands. He relied on his kinsmen in Perth and Angus, and he had some hope of the Gordons. It was the gentry of the northern lowlandsGrahams, Drummonds, Erskines, Stirlings, and Ogilviesin whom he trusted, if he trusted in any one besides himself, and not in the clans of the hills. Probably at the time he knew very little about the Highlands, and his experience in the Bishops' War cannot have prepossessed him in favour of the desultory bands who accompanied Huntly's lowland levies to battle. Had he known more he would not have been greatly encouraged. Argyll, poor soldier as he was, had worked his will with Morvern and Badenoch, Atholl and Lochaber. Nor were there any of the ordinary politics in the hills. The chiefs were royalists only in as much as they were not Covenanters. He might indeed count on the assistance, could he reach them, of all those who hated the name of CampbellClan Chattan, Clan Donald, the Macleans, the Stuarts, and the Camerons. But Seaforth and his Mackenzies would never fight on the same side as a Macdonald, and, if he enlisted the Gordons, he might look to find the Grants in the other camp.\n\nIf Montrose's venture was desperate in purpose, it was no less desperate in the lack of a base. He [169]was to fling himself into the midst of a hostile country to improvise an army. Nothing could be looked for from the king except the royal commission. Even had Charles been that ideal monarch which certain royalists created out of their fancy, he could have done little to help his champion. As it was, he passed from blunder to blunder, enraging by his obtuseness and duplicity both friend and foe. The man who fought for a Stuart must be content to wage war without reserves. His life and his reputation alike must be in his own keeping.\n\nCrawford, Reay, Nithsdale, Ogilvy, and Aboyne accompanied Montrose as he rode out from Oxford, on his way to Newcastle's camp. The two first presently turned off with a squadron of horse towards Shrewsbury. Arrived at York, Montrose found that Newcastle was at Durham, so he sent on Colonel Cochrane to acquaint him with the king's commission and his need of men and money. The reply came that at Durham there was little of either, and the king's lieutenant-general, on March 15th, proceeded thither to reason with the royalist commander. Already the news of his coming north had sent Argyll post-haste into Scotland, whither, Montrose wrote to Sir Robert Spottiswoode at Oxford, \"we intend to make all possible dispatch to follow him at his heels, in whatever posture we can.\"[252] Newcastle, the great potentate of the north-east, now a marquis and after the Restoration to be a duke, was a man of sumptuous and scholarly tastes, a devout loyalist, and brave and scrupulous in all the relations of life. He was the idol of his second wife, but in her praise of his gentility, \"which hath something in it of grandeur,\"[253] we can detect the source of his failure. He was too fine for the rough task before himthe complete dilettante, who, in Clarendon's words, \"the articles of action no sooner over, returned to his delightful company, music, and the softer pleasures.\"[254] As a soldier he was neither fortunate nor skilful, for he had no experience of war.[170]\n\nOn 19th January Leven, with 18,000 foot and more than 3,000 horse, had crossed Tweed. He halted for three weeks before the town of Newcastle, and then on 28th February the bulk of his army, assisted by the prayers of Mr. Robert Baillie in far-away London, forded Tyne. By 2nd March he was across the Wear, and two days later entered Sunderland. Newcastle, who had only 5,000 foot and 3,000 horse, was opportunely strengthened by the arrival of Sir Charles Lucas, made a feeble demonstration against him, and then fell back on Durham. Leven followed, but finding his commissariat difficult in that devastated country, remained in the district between Tyne and Wear, and decided to lay siege to the positions which guarded the mouth of the former river. The marquis, when Montrose arrived, was in the worst of spirits. The town of Newcastle still held out, but Leven was at its gates, and Manchester and Fairfax were closing up on him from the south. Even as against the Scots he was outnumbered, and he might soon be caught between two formidable fires. He was in no condition to spare a silver piece or a man.\n\nNevertheless, as a great nobleman, he honoured the king's commission and did his best. A hundred ill-mounted troopers and two small brass cannon were the most the perplexed commander could spare Montrose for the conquest of Scotland. He called out for him, however, the militia of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and sundry local gentlemen were willing to join his standard. Another disappointment was in store, for Carnwath, who happened to be in Newcastle's camp, refused to accept from Montrose's hand the royal commission as lieutenant of Clydesdale. It was a foretaste of the spirit of even the loyal among the Scots nobles. There was a curious wildness in the Carnwath family, conspicuous even in a wild age. At the head of a troop of horse rode a certain Mrs. Pierson, who passed as Carnwath's daughter, and whose commission was made out in the name of Captain Francis Dalziel. Her cornet carried a black banner, which displayed on a sable field a naked man hanging from a gibbet, under the motto[171] \"I dare.\"[255]\n\n1644 March-April\n\nMontrose's coming stirred the Marquis of Newcastle to action. Leven, at the mouth of the Tyne, was cut off from his base and his heavy guns at Sunderland. Here was a chance for a bold stroke, so on 23rd March he advanced to Chester-le-street, and next day took up position at Hilton north of the Wear, a few miles from Sunderland, with Leven on a hill to the east. But even Montrose's influence could not put speed into Newcastle's languid soul. There was an artillery duel and some fighting between advanced troops, but on the 25th Newcastle suddenly drew off towards Durham, and Leven was enabled to inflict considerable damage on his rear. Presently the news of Fairfax's approach caused the marquis to hasten south to York.\n\n1644 April\n\nWith Newcastle's campaign Montrose had no concern, for his business lay north of the Border. He marched towards Carlisle with 200 horse, mostly gentlemen who had served in the foreign wars; Crawford of the fierce counsels, Nithsdale, Ogilvy, and Aboyne were with him, and Captain Francis Dalziel with her grisly banner.[256] The Cumberland and Westmoreland men, 800 foot and three troops of horse, joined him on the road, and on 13th April he led a force of some 1,300 men across the Border. But he had not forded Annan before trouble began. Most of the English militia, worked upon by the emissaries of Sir Richard Graham,[257] deserted, and the loss was not atoned for by the accession of Lord Herries with a small following. With his little force of a few hundreds Montrose reached Dumfries, and occupied the town without opposition.[172] The provost, one John Corsane,[258] welcomed him gladly, and in consequence had five years' trouble with the Estates and the Kirk.\n\nIt was at once apparent that nothing could be done in the southern Lowlands. The Maxwell and Johnstones of the Dumfries neighbourhood were in no mood to rise, and their headsNithsdale and Hartfellwere jealous of the new commander. Annandale, Morton, Roxburgh, and Traquair, though nominally royalists, refused, like Carnwath, the king's commissions of lieutenancy, by means of which Montrose had hoped to organize a formidable opposition.[259] Farther east Lothian was hot for the Parliament, and the \"bauld Buccleuch,\" a young man of eighteen, was commandingwith no particular credit to himselfa regiment under Leven. The peasantry of Dumfries were under the thumb of the ministers and of fickle noblemen like Glencairn. Montrose issued a declaration, headed by the device which appears on the cover of this volume, explaining that he was now in arms for the king on the same principle as he had once been in arms for the Covenant\"for the defence and maintenance of the true Protestant religion, his Majesty's just and sacred authority, the fundamental laws and privileges of Parliament, the peace and freedom of the oppressed and enthralled subject.\" \"Knew I not perfectly,\" he added, \"his Majesty's intentions to be such, and so real as is already expressed, I should never have embarked myself at all in his service. Nor, did I but see the least appearance of his Majesty's change from these resolutions or any of them, I should never continue longer my faithful endeavour in it.\"[260] His case was unanswerable; he stood in the direct tradition of the National Covenan[173]t and of the spirit of the Glasgow Assembly. But he was speaking a tongue which the burghers of Dumfries, and for that matter the Scottish people, did not understand. \"It was not,\" in Mr. Gardiner's words, \"for the restoration of a dead past that he drew the sword. He stood up for that which was, in some sort, the hope of the future.\"[261] And the language of the future is always strange to contemporary ears.\n\nMontrose lingered on, waiting for news of Antrim's men, from which it would appear that Galloway, as well as Argyll, was their objective. But no news came and his hopes sank, for Antrim had always been uncertain as the wind. He received, however, a message of another kindfrom his niece, Lady Stirling of Keirinviting him, on behalf of the commander, Lord Sinclair, to take possession of the castle of Stirling and the town of Perth. Sinclair and his second in command, Sir James Turner,[262] were probably sincere in their offer, but it was fortunate for Montrose that he did not attempt to accept it. For the Covenant had got wind of the intention of the pair, and, while Montrose was reading his niece's letter, Callander, with Sinclair and Turner in tow, was marching south. Callander, who had once been Almond and a party to the Cumbernauld Bond, presently occupied Dumfries, while Montrose and his handful recrossed the Esk. They barely escaped, and had to leave some of their guns in Annandale.[263] Meanwhile two events had befallen the royalist leader. He had received his patent of marquis from the king, and had been excommunicated by the Kirk in Edinburgh. The latter honour was also conferred at the same time upon Huntly, who had just been conducting an aimless and confused rising in the north, and was now hiding from Argyll in Strathnaver.[264]\n\n[174]\n\n1644 May-June\n\nThere was no course open to Montrose except to wait for Scottish news on English soil, while he kept Callander and his 7,000 levies busy on the western Marches, and to strike a blow, if occasion offered, on behalf of the hard-pressed Marquis of Newcastle. He had no illusions about either that general or the royalist troops in the north of England. He had seen the quality of the Cumberland and Westmoreland militia, most of the gentry were watching the omens, and the Percy's spur was cold in Northumbria. The centre of the war was shifting into Yorkshire, but Montrose's duty was to keep close to Scotland, and his task was only desultory Border fighting. It was sufficient, however, to inspire acute anxiety in the breast of Mr. Robert Baillie and the Covenant leaders.\n\n1644 June-July\n\nIf Newcastle was to be retained and the position of its marquis improved at York, a blow must be struck forthwith in the north. The town of Morpeth was strongly held by a Covenanting garrison under Somerville of Drum (afterwards the tenth Lord Somerville), and on 10th May Montrose marched against it, assisted by Colonel Clavering, and with Crawford as his intractable colleague. He attempted to carry the place by assault, was repulsed, and then, after bringing up six guns from Newcastle, breached its defence and entered it on 29th May. The air was full of wild rumours, and to a certain Captain John MacCulloch, who parleyed with him, Montrose gave a romantic account of a great disaster to Leven at York, and of the success of the royalists in Scotland.[265] The garrison was disarmed and dismissed, and after the surrender Montrose entertained the governor to dinner. He then recaptured the fort at South Shields which Leven had taken on 20th March, and attacked Sunderland, where he was checked by the energy of its seamen and the cavalry sent by Leven from York.[266] The Covenanting general was in difficulties, for so long as he had the Marquis of Newcastle to deal with he could do little against Montrose. His only hope was[175] Callander, who was making his leisurely way from the western Border.[267] Montrose was collecting provisions from the Alnwick neighbourhood and succeeding in getting them into the beleaguered Newcastle, when at the end of June he received a peremptory summons to join Prince Rupert, who was marching through Lancashire to the relief of York.\n\nRupert did not wait for Montrose. He relieved York indeed, but before he and Montrose met the king's arms had suffered their first crushing disaster. On 2nd July, about five in the afternoon, he engaged the Parliament forces at Marston Moor, and discovered that new thing in Englandthe shock of Cromwell's horse. The Huntingdonshire grazier, turned parliamentarian, had made himself also a great soldier, and had hammered into being an army to suit his purpose. On that fierce day David Leslie also wrought famously, and disputes as to the true architect of victory did not improve relations between Scots and English.[268] The king's army was scattered, Newcastle fled overseas, and Rupert, lamenting the loss in action of his white dog which Puritans believed to be his familiar spirit,[269] rode with some 6,000 troops into the western hills. Two days after the battle Montrose found him in an inn at Richmond. \"Give me a thousand of your horse,\" he said, \"and I will cut my way into the heart of Scotland.\" But Rupert had nothing to give; on the contrary, he stood much in need of Montrose's scanty recruits. So with a sad heart the new marquis rode by Brough and Appleby to Carlisle to indite his report to the king. The western Marches were now safer for him, since Callander had gone east to Newcastle.\n\n1644 July-Aug.\n\nFour months had passed and nothing had been done. Ogilvy and Sir William Rollo had journeyed secretly into Scotland, and had returned with ill news. The land lay quiet under the Covenant, and Antrim's levies seemed to have vanished into the mist. The nobles, headed by Traquair, were tumbling over each other [176]in their anxiety to swear fealty to Argyll. There seemed nothing to be done except to surrender the royal commission, and to wait abroad for a happier time. So his friends advised, and Montrose made a pretence of acquiescing. He set out for Oxford with the rest, having taken Ogilvy (and later Aboyne) into his confidence. A little way from Carlisle he slipped behind, but as his servants and baggage went on it was presumed that he was following. Had he continued, he would have shared in the capture of the whole party by Fairfax at Ribble bridge.[270]\n\nHe had resolved on the craziest of ventures. He would break through the Covenant cordon in the Lowlands, and win to his own country. There, at any rate, were loyal hearts, and something might be devised to turn the tide. He chose as his companions the lame Sir William Rollo and an officer, Colonel Sibbald, who had fought under him in the Bishops' War. They wore the dress of Leven's troopers, while Montrose followed behind as their groom, riding one ill-conditioned beast and leading another.\n\n1644 August\n\nIt was a dangerous road to travel. The country was strewn with broken men and patrolled by Covenant horse, and a gentleman in those days was not easily disguised. At first all went smoothly. Passing through the woods of Netherby, they learned that Sir Richard Graham had joined the Covenant, and in its interests had constituted himself Warden of the Marches. His servant, from whom they had the news, spoke freely, as if to Leven's troopers. A little farther on they fell in with a Scot, one of Newcastle's soldiers, who disregarded the troopers but paid great attention to their groom, hailing him by his proper title. Montrose tried to deny it, but the man exclaimed, \"What, do I not know my Lord Marquis of Montrose well enough? But go your way, and God be with you!\" A gold piece rewarded[177] the untimely well-wisher.\n\nThe journey must have grown hourly more anxious till the Forth was passed. \"It may be thought,\" wrote Patrick Gordon, \"that God Almighty sent His good angel to lead the way, for he went, as if a cloud environed him, through all his enemies.\"[271] We do not know the road they travelledwhether by Annandale and the springs of Tweed and Clyde, or up Eskdale and thence over the Tweedside range to the Lothians. The safest route was probably by the belt of bleak moorland which runs north by Carnwath almost to the Highland hills. Riding chiefly by night, the party made good progress. On the fourth day they came to the Montrose lands in Stirling and Strathearn, but they did not draw rein till they reached the house of Tullibelton, between Perth and Dunkeld. Here lived Patrick Graham of Inchbrakie, he who had seen to the ordering of Montrose's little library at St. Andrews, and here was safe shelter for the traveller while he spied out the land and looked about for a following.\n\nIt was the hour of portents. Airy armies were seen to contend on a hill in Banff; in Buchan the sun shone clear at midnight, and a kirk was filled with a choir of unearthly music; a cannon shot echoed over the whole kingdom to warn men that an invader was landing in the west.[272] But the true portent came in humbler form. The curtain rises, and the first act of the great drama reveals a forlorn little party late on an August evening knocking at the door of a woodland tower above the shining reaches of Tay. The king's lieutenant-general makes a very modest entrance on the scene. Two followers, four sorry horses, little money and no baggage seem a slender outfit for the conquest of a kingdom; but in six months he had Scotland at his feet.\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTIPPERMUIR\n\n(September 1644)\n\nHotspur. \"The purpose you meditate is dangerous; the friends you have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition!\" Say you so, say you so? . . . By the Lord, our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our friends true and constant: a good plot, good friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot, very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is this!\n\n— First Part of King Henry IV.\n\nI\n\n1644 August\n\nFor six days the king's lieutenant lay close in hiding while his comrades scoured the country for news. Tullibelton was too near the lowland town of Perth, and its laird too noted a loyalist for his guest to run needless risks, and Montrose spent most of his time among the woods and hills, sleeping at night in hunters' bothies, and soothing his soul with the lights and colours of a Scottish autumn. The scouts returned with a melancholy tale. Huntly had failed ruinously in the north, and the Gordons were leaderless and divided, while the influence of their uncle, Argyll, was driving Huntly's sons to the Covenant camp. Some of the Graham and Drummond kinsmen even, with the alternative of prison and fines before them, were in arms for the Estates. There were rumours of Covenant levies in Aberdeenshire, and in the west Argyll had his clan in arms. Montrose in his despondency may well have wondered at this strange activity. The tide of war had rolled over the Border, and with Scotland in so iron a grip such precautions must have seemed odd to one who knew the economical spirit of his opponents.\n\nHe was soon to learn the reason, and at the same time to recognize his opportunity. The incident is b[179]est told in the words of Patrick Gordon, who had the story from Montrose's own lips:\n\nAntrim's levies had come out of the mist at last.\n\nPresently Montrose received a letter from Alasdair Macdonald himself, directed to the king's lieutenant-general at Carlisle. The messenger who carried it asked directions from Inchbrakie, who took the dispatch and promised to deliver it. In the letter Macdonald announced his arrival and begged for instructions. If Montrose needed help, no less did the Irish commander.\n\nAlasdair Macdonald was of the ancient stock of Dunyveg in Islay, the son of Macdonald of Colonsay, commonly called Coll Keitach, or \"Coll who can fight with either hand.\" The name, corrupted into Colkitto, was transferred by the Lowlanders (like the Gruamach appellation in the case of Argyll) from the father to the son. Sorley Boy Macdonald, the father of the first Earl of Antrim, had been his father's great-uncle. The Macdonnells of Antrim were near blood-relations of Alasdair's own people of Islay and Kintyre, and th[180]e Campbell oppression of the latter clan had left bitter memories on both sides of the North Channel. Alasdair was a man of herculean strength and proven courage; self-indulgent and somewhat inclined to drunkenness; obtuse and incapable of framing or understanding any complex strategy: \"no sojer,\" wrote Sir James Turner, \"though stout enough.\"[274] But he was a born leader of men, and so impressed Leven in Ireland that he did his best to reconcile him to Argyll, and sent him to Scotland for the purpose. But the chief of the Campbells treated the Irish commander with contempt, and Alasdair returned to Ulster with all his hereditary grievances inflamed, and burning for revenge.[275]\n\nAntrim, whom Clarendon thought a man \"of excessive pride and vanity, and of a marvellously weak and narrow understanding,\" had been conspicuous for his large promise and meagre performance. The clan of Macdonnell had a hard life under the fruitless escapades of their chief; \"we are worn spectre-thin,\" sang their bard, \"by the earl's oft frequenting of the wave.\"[276] But now at last he was to influence the course of history. After many difficulties he raised, by the end of June 1644, 1,600 recruits among the exiled Macdonalds and Macleans, and he invited Alasdair to lead them against the ancestral foe. Early in July the invaders landed in Ardnamurchan, an old territory of the Macdonalds, and proceeded to exact vengeance on the unfortunate Campbell settlers. The king's quarrel was forgotten in a more intimate and personal strife. Alasdair ravaged the peninsula with fire and sword, and seized as a base the castle of Mingary on Loch Sunart, and the keep of Lochaline, which still stands where the little river Aline enters its sea-loch. He sent messengers throughout the West Highlands to summon the clans to help him in his task. But there was no response; Macdonalds and Macleans, Macleods and Macneils, were alike silent; the hand of Clan Diarmaid lay too heavy on the mainland and the isles.[181]\n\nSoon his position became desperate, for Argyll was raising an army of pursuit; so he swept back to his base, only to find that all his ships had been destroyed. Alasdair, whatever his defects as a general, was a bold fighting man; his only hope was the Gordons, and he resolved to bid for their support though it meant marching across the breadth of Scotland. Accordingly he led his forces through Morvern and round by the head of Loch Eil to the Lochaber glens, the western fringe of Huntly's country. Here he had his second piece of ill tidings. Huntly's revolt was over, and the Gordons had made their peace with the Covenant. There was nothing for it but to try the more northern clans, and his next venture was Kintail. But the Mackenzies, little though they loved the Campbells, had a long memory of Macdonald misdeeds, and their chief, Seaforth, warned off the intruders.\n\nHeaded back on all sides, Alasdair decided that the boldest course was the safest. He marched south again to Badenoch and the head waters of Spey, and himself issued a summons, calling upon the clans to rise in the name of the king and Huntly. This brought him some 500 recruits, most of them Gordons; but he could get no nearer to the heart of that powerful clan, for the Grants, Forbeses, and Frasers blocked the road down Spey, and a thousand of Seaforth's Mackenzies lent their aid. Alasdair now seemed in a fair way for destruction. The Campbells intercepted his retreat to the sea, and Argyll was hot-foot on his track. Seaforth cut him off from the north and east, the new Badenoch levies were mutinous and distrustful, and south lay the unfriendly Lowlands, and clans like the Stewarts of Atholl, who would never serve under an alien tartan. He had proved that whoever might band the Highlands into an army, it would not be a man of Highland blood. Hence his despairing letter to the king's lieutenant-general asking for help and instructions. He can scarcely have hoped for much from his appeal, for Carlisle was far from Badenoch and he had the enemy on every side.[182]\n\nMontrose sent back an answer, bidding Alasdair be of good heart and meet him at Blair. It must have seemed a hard saying to a man who believed that his correspondent was still at Carlisle, but he obeyed, and, guided by a Clanranald man,[277] one Donald the Fair, who had seen service in the German wars, he marched into the braes of Atholl. The local clans resented his intrusion, the fiery cross was sent round, and there was every likelihood of a desperate conflict between two forces who alike detested the Covenant and followed the king. The Irish were stout fellows in hard condition, but they were uncouthly dressed, wild-eyed from long travel, and, after their custom, attended by a mob of half-starved women and children. The Atholl clans, living on the edge of the Lowlands, may well have looked askance at such outlandish warriors. Moreover, Alasdair's men were Catholics, and the Reformation in some sort had come to Atholl, as had tales of Irish barbarities in the recent rebellion. The Earl of Atholl was a mino"
