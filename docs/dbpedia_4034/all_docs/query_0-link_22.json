SCOTLAND XI: Robert Brown (Queen's Park) James McGowan (Partick Thistle) John (Jock) Shaw [c] (Rangers) William Bowie Campbell (Morton) Andrew Paton (Motherwell) George Paterson (Celtic) William Tweedie Orr Waddell (Rangers) George Hamilton (Aberdeen) Ephraim \"Jock\" Dodds (Blackpool) Kenneth MacTaggart Chisholm (Queen's Park) William Beveridge Liddell (Liverpool) Notes: \"IRELAND (IFA)\" is used to differentiate the Irish Football Association (IFA) based in Belfast from the Football Association of Ireland (FAI), formed in Dublin in September 1921. Until 1953 both associations styled their teams as Ireland. A more detailed explanation is included at point 1 in the notes on the overview page of \"Scotland - International Results\". One source gives the Scottish goal in the 56th minute to Dodds. The attendance was a new record for Windsor Park. Saturday 13th April 1946 (Victory international) SCOTLAND XI - ENGLAND 1-0 (0-0) Referee: Peter Craigmyle (Aberdeen) Crowd: 139.468, Hampden Park, Glasgow Goal: 1-0 Delaney (88) SCOTLAND XI: Robert Brown (Queen's Park) David Shaw (Hibernian) John (Jock) Shaw [c] (Rangers) William Bowie Campbell (Morton) Frank Brennan (Airdrieonians) John Husband (Partick Thistle) William Tweedie Orr Waddell (Rangers) Cornelius (Neil) Dougall (Birmingham City) James Delaney (Manchester United) Thomas Walker (Heart of Midlothian) William Beveridge Liddell (Liverpool) ENGLAND: Frank Victor Swift (Manchester City), Lawrence Scott (Arsenal), George Francis Moutry Hardwick (Middlesbrough), William Ambrose Wright (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Cornelius Franklin (Stoke City), Joseph Mercer (Everton) [c], William Bethwaite Elliott (West Bromwich Albion), Leonard Francis Shackleton (Bradford (Park Avenue)), Thomas Lawton (Chelsea), James Hagan (Sheffield United), Denis Charles Scott Compton (Arsenal). Notes: Jock Shaw and David Shaw were brothers. This capacity of the ground was set at 138.000 and was all-ticket. The actual attendance was the fifth highest-ever crowd at Hampden Park and exceeded the limit set. Despite this about 1.000 ticket holders were unable to gain entry as the Police judged the terraces were full and ordered the turnstiles to be closed. The unlucky supporters organised an urgent meeting and sent a petition of complaint to the Scottish Football Association. Saturday 24th August 1946 (Bolton Disaster Fund) ENGLAND - SCOTLAND XI 2-2 (2-1) Referee: George Dutton (Warwick, England) Crowd: 70.000, Maine Road, Manchester Goals: 1-0 Welsh (12), 1-1 Thornton (24), 2-1 Welsh (44) penalty, 2-2 Thornton (85) ENGLAND: Frank Victor Swift (Manchester City) [c], Joseph Walton (Manchester United), George Francis Moutry Hardwick (Middlesbrough), William Ambrose Wright (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Leon Harry Leuty (Derby County), Frank Rollason Mitchell (Birmingham City), Stanley Matthews (Stoke City), Donald Welsh (Charlton Athletic), Reginald Lewis (Arsenal), Alfred [Walter] Fielding (Everton), Charles Mitten (Manchester United). SCOTLAND XI: William Miller (Celtic) David Shaw (Hibernian) John (Jock) Shaw [c] (Rangers) William Bowie Campbell (Morton) Frank Brennan (Newcastle United) John Husband (Partick Thistle) William Tweedie Orr Waddell (Rangers) Cornelius (Neil) Dougall (Birmingham City) William Thornton (Rangers) George Hamilton (Aberdeen) William Beveridge Liddell (Liverpool) Notes: This match was played for the benefit of the Bolton Disaster Fund. The Bolton disaster occurred at Burnden Park, Bolton on 9th March 1946 when 33 spectators died and hundreds of others were injured due to crushing at a Bolton Wanderers v Stoke City FA Cup match. The Scottish Football Association made a donation of £1,000 to the fund and agreed to pay all its own expenses relating to this fund-raising match. The match raised around £12,000. The attendance at Maine Road was limited to 70.000, more than 10.000 below the holding capacity at the time. The report into the disaster had been published by the time of the match with recommendations to improve crowd control. Clubs took immediate action and it is likely the 70.000 limit was imposed as a direct result of the report. George Dutton had reached the upper age limit as a referee and was not included on the Football League list for the forthcoming 1946-47 season. However, as he was in charge of the Bolton disaster match he was asked to officiate at this game. Wednesday 28th May 1947 (Friendly match) BRITISH ARMY OF THE RHINE COMBINED SERVICES XI - SCOTLAND XI 4-3 (1-2) Referee: nk Crowd: 30.000, Bahrenfeld Stadium, Hamburg, Germany Goals: 0-1 Young (9), 1-1 Thompson (14), 1-2 Pearson (40), 2-2 Dutchman (66), 3-2 Lee (71), 4-2 Thompson (80), 4-3 Pearson (85) BAOR COMBINED SERVICES XI: Sgt James Clews Cowan (Morton), Sgt Ivor Verdun Powell (Queen's Park Rangers), Sgt James Guy Taylor (Fulham), Capt Thomas Stewart (Queen's Park), Sgt Ronald Frederick Stitfall (Cardiff City), Capt Alexander Cross (Queen's Park) [c], Sgt Dennis Thompson (Sheffield United), FO John Arthur Dutchman (Leeds United), Cpl George Thomas Lee (York City), Sgt Edward Francis Baily (Tottenham Hotspur), Cpl Thomas Powell (Derby County).

He probably is Welsh international Ivor Powell of Queen's Park Rangers.

Notes: The Scottish Fuel Efficiency Committee made a formal protest to the War Office about this match. It was concerned that the game played on a midweek afternoon would lead to absenteeism and interfere with industrial production. The War Office pointed out that the SFA had set the date for the match that was a practice match for the Scotland XI and similar matches had drawn small attendances of 6-7.000. Sir Patrick Dollan, chairman of the committee, was told that the War Office would not have allowed the match to go ahead if they knew the attendance was likely to exceed those of previous games. Sir Patrick wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to raise his concerns that Scottish football was not falling in line with England and was still playing matches in midweek. Wednesday 25th May 1949 (North America tour) ST.LOUIS ALL-STARS - SCOTLAND XI 0-6 (0-3) Referee: Justin Keenoy (St.Louis, Missouri) Crowd: 9.662, name of the stadium nk, St.Louis, Missouri Goals: 0-1 Houliston (7), 0-2 Houliston (10), 0-3 Orr (nk), 0-4 Evans (nk), 0-5 Waddell (nk), 0-6 Orr (nk) ST.LOUIS ALL-STARS: Larry King (Paul Schulte Motors), Bob Fitzgerald, John Galimberti (Simpkins-Ford), Ollie Bohlman (Paul Schulte Motors), Charles Colombo (Simpkins-Ford), Harry Keough (Paul Schulte Motors), Amiel Muniz (Paul Schulte Motors), Gino Pariani (Simpkins-Ford), William Bertani (Simpkins-Ford), Joe Spica, Frank Wallace (Simpkins-Ford).

It was to involve five matches between teams representing the national associations of the hosts, England (Newcastle United), Ireland (Belfast Celtic), Scotland (Scottish XI), Sweden (IFK Göteborg). The SFA was given the choice of opponents in the team's one match in the festival. It decided to play Belfast Celtic as it believed it would attract a bigger crowd drawn from the large Scottish and Irish communities in New York. Belfast Celtic were also on a North American tour involving other matches and had invited three players from other Irish clubs to join the touring party. Two of them played in this match and their clubs are shown in the line-up.

Notes: This was a match organised to raise money for the testimonial fund established for Jimmy Mason. He signed for Third Lanark in 1936 and had played for the club continuously until he was forced to retire through injury in 1953. He played in seven full internationals for Scotland between 1948-1951 and was never cautioned by a referee during his long career. Sir George Graham, SFA secretary, helped arrange an interesting game that would attract a good attendance. He invited Sunderland to play a Scotland XI at Cathkin Park, the home ground of Third Lanark (formerly known as the 3rd Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteers). When Queen's Park left the 2nd Hampden Park in 1903, Third Lanark took over the ground and re-named it New Cathkin Park. It was later commonly known as just Cathkin Park - the same name as their previous ground  but it did not host any international matches under this name.
