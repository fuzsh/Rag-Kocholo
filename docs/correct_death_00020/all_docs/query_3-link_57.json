        "text": "Richard Allen “Bo” Rodgers Jr. passed away peacefully on January 5, 2022, surrounded by his wife, daughter, in-laws and other special family members. He was called home to be with our Lord after a four-year battle with cancer.\n\nHe was born May 25, 1964, in Luray, Virginia. He was the son of the late Richard Rodgers Sr. and Wanda Shenk (Benton).\n\nOn January 17, 2015, he married the love of his life, Beth Rodgers. They truly shared a love like no other.\n\nHe was a wonderful father to his three children, Megan Good (A.J.), Amanda Painter and Aaron Painter (Samantha). He was “Pop Pop” to two grandchildren, Ida Good and Benton Good. He is also survived by three siblings, Millette Forney (Mike), Leanne Nealis (Dave) and Chuck Shenk (Terry). He was also Daddy to two cats that stole his heart, Bella and Lucy.\n\nBo was an avid bluegrass fan and he loved to camp. Along with his wife, Beth, daughter Amanda and best friends Mike and Cheryl Minnick, they camped and attended bluegrass festivals all over Virginia and in surrounding states. Bo loved to travel and they visited California, Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, Key West, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and many other places in between. He loved to go to yard sales, thrift stores and flea markets. Bo would often tell his wife, daughter and the Minnicks to pack a bag and let's hit the road, often not even knowing where the journey would take them.\n\nBo was so proud of the “Pickin' at the Post” bluegrass festival that he started with his wife, daughter and the Minnicks. It was his desire for those of us left behind to keep it going and growing. Along with many friends and volunteers, we will honor that request. He truly loved his bluegrass friends and considered all of them family.\n\nAt Bo's request, there will be no services at this time. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Luray VFW and all donations will be used to support the 2022 “Pickin' at the Post” in September. Checks should be made payable to Luray VFW PATP and mailed to 218 Veterans Lane, Luray, Va. 22835. Please note “Pickin' at the Post” on the memo of your check. Bo was passionate about this cause, so it seems only fitting for donations to be made in his memory.\n\nHe will be missed. We know God welcomed him with open arms and we will strive to meet him again one day soon.\n\nThank you to everyone that helped us care for Bo day and night during his last few weeks of earthly life. Thank you to all of our friends and bluegrass family that called, said a prayer, sent a message or visited. You will never be forgotten. God bless all of you."
