        "text": "Parents must communicate with their child’s teacher as to which days the child will ride the bus home. To avoid any miscommunication problems, teachers will not take a child’s verbal message. Please send a written note to the teacher stating which days your child will ride the bus. When changes occur, parents must email bus@ps166.org before 1 PM that day.\n\nFor those students eligible for MetroCards, they will be given to your child sometime the first week of school. MetroCards are for students only and cannot be used by an adult (unless an exception is made in a bus strike.)\n\nStudents cannot have both a MetroCard and bus service.\n\nWe are excited to announce that Impact Coaching Network (ICN) will be coming to P.S. 166 to teach our kids chess and all of the valuable skills that come with it!\n\nICN is the city’s leading scholastic chess program (https://impactcoachingnetwork.org), and they will be running after-school classes for kids at every level — from brand-new novices who just want to learn the basics, to advanced players who want to play in competitive tournaments as part of 166’s amazing chess club, the Manhattan Knights. After-school classes are open to all levels and will be offered on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with late stay options until 6 pm. Registration will open on July 1. Sibling Discounts and Financial assistance is available.\n\nFor any questions, please email PS166CHESSCLUB@GMAIL.COM\n\nWe are thrilled to be chosen as the new provider of after-school enrichment programs for PS166. Our company, Amazing Athletes Sports & Education Programs (www.amazingathletes.com), is the leading educational sports program in the country, positively impacting over 250,000 children annually through sports and enrichment activities. We are also the proud owners of Super Soccer Stars, which was founded on the Upper West Side 22 years ago. Our offices are conveniently located on 89th and Columbus, just around the corner from PS166.\n\nAs parents ourselves - my partner Carmen Bellavia, who is the Chief Technology Officer (and a PS166 parent), and myself, the CEO and a thirteen-year resident of the Upper West Side - we are committed to providing the diversity of programming PS166 children have enjoyed, such as musical theater, dance, arts, coding, study hall, and chess.\n\nFurthermore, we are excited to collaborate with the PTA and the administration to explore new possibilities. This includes options like an early drop-off, enhanced programming, and expanded locations to provide an even better experience for PS166 families.\n\nWe understand the importance of maintaining continuity of pricing, program options, and, whenever possible, instructors and teachers. We are in daily communication with the school administration to ensure a seamless transition.\n\nTo ensure we capture your input, we will send out a parent survey early next week to gain insights into your preferences and expectations for the program. Your partnership is incredibly important to us as we aim to deliver the highest quality of enrichment programming for your children. We will also provide you with additional details regarding the opening of registration, which is planned for late July or August 1st.\n\nShould you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to email us at ps166@amazingathletes.com. We value your input and look forward to building a strong partnership to deliver exceptional enrichment programming.\n\nThank you all and we are looking forward to an exciting year in ‘23/’24.\n\nBest,\n\n-Adam Geisler\n\nCEO\n\nThe P.S. 166 PTA raises funds each year through the Family Giving campaign.
