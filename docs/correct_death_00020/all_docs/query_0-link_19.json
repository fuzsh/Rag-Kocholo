        "text": "Composer\n\nPlace Of Birth:\n\nNew York City, New York\n\nBest Known As:\n\nComposer of Oklahoma! and The Sound of Music\n\nName at birth: Richard Charles Rodgers\n\nRichard Rogers was one of the most successful and celebrated composers of the 20th century. His partnerships with lyricists Lorenz Hart (1895-1943) and Oscar Hammerstein II (1895-1960) resulted in dozens of hit musicals for the stage and screen, from Babes in Arms to The Sound of Music. A published songwriter by the age of 17, Richard Rodgers began collaborating with Lorenz Hart in the 1920s. Between 1920 and 1943 they wrote dozens of musicals for the New York stage and Hollywood movies, including The Boys of Syracuse and Pal Joey. In 1943, after splitting with Hart, Rodgers teamed with Oscar Hammerstein II to write Oklahoma!, a box office smash and a landmark in the history of musical theater. Rodgers and Hammerstein went on to write and produce hit musicals such as Carousel, State Fair, The King and I and The Sound of Music, all of which were adapted for the movies. After Hammerstein's death in 1960, Rodgers continued composing, sometimes writing his own lyrics. Rodgers was known for his catchy melodies and ability to incorporate other musical styles into popular tunes. Some of his songs, such as \"My Funny Valentine\" and \"The Lady is a Tramp,\" have become jazz standards.\n\nExtra Credit:\n\nRichard Rodgers was the first person ever to win the so-called EGOT: an Emmy Award for television, a Grammy Award for recordings, an Oscar for film and a Tony for Broadway. He completed his quartet in 1962 by winning an Emmy for his music to Winston Churchill: The Valiant Years. By 2020 there were a total of 15 EGOT winners, including Audrey Hepburn and Mel Brooks.\n\n3 Good Links\n\nOfficial site that keeps tabs on their legacy\n\nPBS online companion to their television documentary\n\nNo spark to this text file, but it documents his tremendous output\n\nSee also:"
