        "text": "Millennium Dome architect Richard Rogers has died at the age of 88.\n\nA spokesman said he had \"passed away quietly\" on Saturday evening.\n\nHe first came to prominence with his radical designs for the Pompidou Centre in Paris and the Lloyd's of London building.\n\nLord Rogers was regarded as one of the world's most successful and influential architects, and he won most of his industry's major honours. He was knighted in 1991.\n\nBorn in 1933 to an Anglo-Italian family in Florence, he trained at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London before graduating with a master's from Yale.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, he became widely known for two buildings that were controversial at the time for putting amenities like lifts and air conditioning ducts on the outside - the Pompidou in Paris and the Lloyd's building in London.\n\nHis other creations included the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, the Welsh Parliament's Senedd building in Cardiff, Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport and Terminal 4 of Madrid's Barajas Airport.\n\nHe also built 3 World Trade Center in New York, an 80-storey skyscraper on the site of the former Twin Towers.\n\nHis critics over the years included Prince Charles, who spoke about his dislike of Lord Rogers' designs on several occasions."
