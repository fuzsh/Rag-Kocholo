        "text": "The Richard Rodgers Theatre originated in 1924 as the Chaninâ€™s 46th Street Theatre.\n\nThe Chanin Brothers were construction moguls who built six Broadway theaters in as many years, the 46th Street Theatre being their first. But the duo lost control of their theatre empire during the Great Depression, and the Majestic Theatre, Royale Theatre, and the Theatre Masque were eventually all acquired by the Shuberts.\n\nIt was in 1931 that the Shuberts took ownership of this theater, however, in 1945 they sold it to City Playhouses, an investment group.\n\nIn 1982, the Nederlander organization bought the theater, and it was renamed in honor of legendary composer Richard Rodgers in 1990.\n\nTheatre Opened in 1924\n\nThe 46th Street Theatre, now called the Richard Rodgers Theatre, opened on Christmas Eve in 1924 showing Greenwich Follies. In its early years it booked shows that had played other theaters first.\n\nEthel Merman starred in two hit shows, the Cole Porter triumph DuBarry was a Lady in 1939, and Panama Hattie in 1940. Guys and Dolls, winner of 8 Tony awards, opened in 1945 and played at the Richard Rodgers Theatre for three years.\n\nGwen Verdon starred in three successive musicals at the Richard Rodgers: Damn Yankees, New Girl In Town, and Redhead. Other blockbuster musicals that have kept the lights on in the Richard Rodgers Theatre include How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, 1776, The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, Nine, and In the Heights."
