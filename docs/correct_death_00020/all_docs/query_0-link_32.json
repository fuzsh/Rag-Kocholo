        "text": "(1902–79). Along with his collaborators Lorenz Hart (1895–1943) and Oscar Hammerstein II (1895–1960), Richard Rodgers was one of the most innovative and creative figures in American musical comedy. On Your Toes (1936), with its jazz ballet “Slaughter on Tenth Avenue,” established serious dance as a component of the medium. The songs Rodgers composed found a permanent place in the catalog of U.S. popular music. Among them are “The Lady Is a Tramp,” “Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered,” “Oh, What a Beautiful Morning”, “My Funny Valentine,” “Climb Every Mountain,” and “Some Enchanted Evening.”\n\nRodgers was born in New York City on June 28, 1902. He attended Columbia University—where he met Hart—for a year and a half before studying composition at what is now the Juilliard School. Their first professional success was Garrick Gaieties in 1925. Their other musicals included The Girl Friend (1926), A Connecticut Yankee (1927), Present Arms (1928), On Your Toes (1936), The Boys from Syracuse (1938), Pal Joey (1940), and By Jupiter (1942).\n\nHart died in 1943, and Rodgers began working with Hammerstein. They turned the play Green Grow the Lilacs into the greatest musical-comedy success Broadway had seen: Oklahoma! (1943). They followed it with Carousel (1945), South Pacific (1949), The King and I (1951), Pipe Dream (1955), Flower Drum Song (1958), and The Sound of Music (1959). Oklahoma! and South Pacific both won Pulitzer prizes. After Hammerstein’s death in 1960, Rodgers wrote the words and music for No Strings (1962). He had written the music for the motion picture Victory at Sea in 1952. He died in New York City on Dec. 30, 1979."
