        "text": "How much do you know about Rodgers & Hammerstein? Before working together, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II had separately built distinguished careers. Richard Rodgers had been in a writing partnership with lyricist Lorenz (Larry) Hart for 24 years, co-creating over 40 musicals and film scores. Oscar Hammerstein II had built a distinguished career bringing new life to operetta, working with such composers as Rudolf Friml, Sigmund Romberg, Vincent Youmans and Jerome Kern. More recently, however, Hammerstein had suffered a series of commercial failures. All that changed one afternoon when an old friend visited his farm for an impromptu conversation. What followed would change the course of American musical theater.\n\nCollectively, the works of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II have won 42 Tony Awards, 15 Academy Awards, two Pulitzer Prizes, two Grammy Awards and 2 Emmy Awards."
