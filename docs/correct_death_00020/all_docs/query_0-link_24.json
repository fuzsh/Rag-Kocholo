        "text": "About the Richard Rodgers Theatre\n\nThe Richard Rodgers Theatre opened in 1924, when it was called Chanin’s 46th Street Theatre. It was the first of the Chanin Brothers’ six Broadway venues, later owned by the Shubert Organization in 1931 and the Nederlander Organization from 1982. In 1990, the venue was renamed in honor of the late composer Richard Rodgers, whose work included The Sound of Music and The King and I.\n\nProlific theater designer Herbert Krapp added another venue to his portfolio with the Richard Rodgers Theatre. His most innovative decision at the theater was the introduction of elevated stadium-style seats in the back half of the Orchestra. This meant theatergoers could sit further back – and spend less money – whilst still enjoying a view unobstructed by those in front of them.\n\nNotable productions at the Richard Rodgers Theatre include Guys and Dolls (1950) and Chicago (1975, now playing at the Ambassador Theatre), and in total the venue has housed 11 Tony Award-winners in the Best Play or Best Musical categories. In recent years, the theater has become known as the room where Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hit musical Hamilton happens, since its Broadway debut in 2015. Miranda’s previous musical, In the Heights, also played at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in 2008.\n\nKnow Before You Go\n\n• Cloakroom services are available during winter; no bags or luggage are accepted\n\n• Bag checks are conducted at the theater\n\n• Drinks and refreshments can be expensive, so plan accordingly"
