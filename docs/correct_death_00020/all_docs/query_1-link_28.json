        "text": "Richard Rodgers was a celebrated composer, especially known for his collaborations with Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II. A born musician, he started picking up melodies by ear and began playing piano by the age of three. He composed the music for his first show at the age of fourteen. Later, he entered Columbia University, where he met Harts and began to collaborate with him, forming a partnership that lasted for more than two decades. However, it was not until he was twenty-three that they could taste real success, eventually becoming one of the most celebrated songwriter-composer duos, writing music for numerous successful musicals and films until Hart’s untimely illness and death. Thereafter, Richard Rogers began working with Oscar Hammerstein II, giving many hits such as Oklahoma!, South Pacific, and The Sound of Music. Today, he is remembered not only for his beautiful melodies, but also for his contribution to the American musical theater.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nAlso Known As: Richard Charles Rodgers\n\nDied At Age: 77\n\nFamily:\n\nSpouse/Ex-: Dorothy Rodgers (m. 1930–1979)\n\nfather: Dr. William Abrahams Rodgers\n\nmother: Mamie Rodgers (Levy)\n\nchildren: Linda Rodgers Emory, Mary Rodgers\n\nBorn Country: United States\n\nDied on: December 30, 1979\n\nplace of death: New York, New York, United States\n\nDiseases & Disabilities: Heart Attack, Cancer Of Jaw, Laryngectomy\n\nNotable Alumni: Columbia College (New York)\n\nAncestry: German American\n\nU.S. State: New Yorkers\n\nMore Facts\n\neducation: Columbia College (New York)"
