        "text": "Obituary of Richard Rodgers Saunders\n\nIt is with sadness that we announce the passing of Richard “Roger” on Tuesday, September 12, 2023, following a brief illness. Born in Fredericton, New Brunswick, on March 12, 1953, he was the son of the late Murray and Lorna (Elgee) Saunders.\n\nRoger is survived by his nieces, nephews, cousins and close friends. Besides his parents, Roger was predeceased by his older brother Charles and sister-in-law Charlotte.\n\nLifelong resident of Fredericton, Roger was a Fredericton High School and University of New Brunswick graduate. He had a love for music and had fond memories of working with CHSR-FM from 1975-1980. He was an avid trail user, enjoyed gardening and was a great historian. Roger thoroughly enjoyed his adventures and travels around Europe, Asia and the Caribbean. For the past 20 years he was employed at UPS and often spoke highly of his colleagues.\n\nVisitation will be held at York Funeral Home, 302 Brookside Drive, Fredericton, on Saturday, September 16, 2023 from 2 to 4 pm. A Private Interment will be held in Forest Hill Cemetery at a later date.\n\nThe family would like to thank the staff at Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital ER and 3E for their kind and compassionate care.\n\nFor those who wish, memorial donations can be made to the Fredericton Trails Coalition or the Canadian Cancer Society. Personal condolences may be offered through www.yorkfh.com."
