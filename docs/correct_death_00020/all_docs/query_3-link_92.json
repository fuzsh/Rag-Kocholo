        "text": "Born: June 28, 1902\n\nLong Island, New York\n\nDied: December 30, 1979\n\nNew York, New York\n\nAmerican composer\n\nRichard Rodgers, American composer, wrote the music for over fifty stage and film musicals and helped make the American musical a legitimate art form.\n\nCollaboration with Hart\n\nAfter working on amateur shows and on a few unsuccessful professional attempts, Rodgers and Hart won acclaim for their review Garrick Gaieties in 1925. Also in 1925, Rodgers, Hart, and Dorothy Fields (1905–1974) collaborated on Dearest Enemy, \"an American musical play\" (as they called it), contributing respectively music, lyrics, and book, adding something new to the theatrical scene. Not only was the material original, charming, and witty, but the form and subject of the entertainment were distinctly unusual. Here was a play based on American history with unpredictable and pertinent musical sections.\n\nDuring the next decade Rodgers and Hart wrote three shows for the London stage and a number of Broadway musicals and Hollywood films. Though not all of them were successful, they were distinguished by a number of fine romantic ballads such as \"My Heart Stood Still\" (1927), \"With a Song in My Heart\" (1929), \"Dancing on the Ceiling\" (1930), and \"Lover\" (1932). Hart's lyrics always managed to avoid too much sentimentality, and Rodgers matched them with tunes of grace and skill.\n\nAmong the nine stage shows written between 1935 and 1942 were several of Rodgers and Hart's most famous: Jumbo (1935); On Your Toes (1936), for which the distinguished Russian-born choreographer George Balanchine (1904–1983) created the ballet; Slaughter on Tenth Avenue; Babes in Arms (1937); The Boys from Syracuse (1938); and Pal Joey (1940). A number of the songs written during this time are among Rodgers and Hart's most durable: \"There's a Small Hotel,\" \"Where or When,\" \"My Funny Valentine,\" \"This Can't Be Love,\" and \"The Lady Is a Tramp.\"\n\nCollaboration with Hammerstein\n\nAfter Hart died in 1943, Rodgers entered a period of unprecedented (having never occurred before) success with lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II (1895–1960). Of their ten musicals, five were among the longest-running and biggest-grossing shows ever created for Broadway: Oklahoma! (1943), Carousel (1945), South Pacific (1949), The King and I (1951), and The Sound of Music (1959).\n\nThe best work of Rodgers and Hart was marked by a considerable measure of wit and sophistication. In contrast, the style of the Rodgers and Hammerstein collaboration was dominated by a basic, almost folklike, simplicity. In many songs both music and words\n\nseem stripped to the barest essentials. Romantic sentiment is a major ingredient.\n\nThrough touring productions, film versions, and recordings, the Rodgers and Hammerstein shows have become known around the world. Songs that have become popular standards include \"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning,\" \"People Will Say We're in Love,\" \"If I Loved You,\" \"You'll Never Walk Alone,\" \"Some Enchanted Evening,\" \"Hello, Young Lovers,\" and \"Climb Every Mountain.\"\n\nAfter Hammerstein's death in 1960 Rodgers for the first time served as his own lyricist for the score of No Strings (1962).\n\nContribution to musical theater\n\nRodgers's long association with the popular musical theater was an important one. His best projects were aimed at giving the musical play an ever more natural American expression. Oklahoma!, especially, brought an engaging simplicity and earthiness to the form. On many occasions Rodgers's choice of subject matter was unconventional (different from the norm), involving characters, situations, and themes of a seriousness seldom encountered previously in musical comedy. His work enriched and broadened a genre once regarded as little more than frivolous (not serious) entertainment and helped make it into an authentic American art form.\n\nRodgers's death on December 30, 1979, did not stop the popularity of his musical works, which enjoyed numerous revivals. Vintage original cast reissues and contemporary recordings, movies and videos, Broadway and community playhouse productions, and even illustrated books abound. They became the avenue through which the timeless works credited with launching the twentieth century musical continued to exist. Neither did Rodgers's shows lose dramatic impact. Their stories remained vividly current, such as South Pacific, which encompasses the uncertainties of its World War II (1939–45; when Great Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France fought against Germany, Italy, and Japan) setting, and The King and I, which deals with racism and absolute authority.\n\nRodgers's work continues\n\nSince music had to be hand-copied during most of Rodgers's lifetime, the musical scores from different productions did not always agree. Although there are some early recordings to follow for authenticity (similarity to the original), it still left room for changes in interpretation or even omission (leaving out) of particular numbers during performances.\n\nThe original shows were showered with honors, from an Academy Award for best song (\"It Might as Well be Spring\" from State Fair won this award in 1945) to another one ten years later for best score for Oklahoma! Three shows won Tony Awards for Best Musical— South Pacific (1949), The King and I (1951), and The Sound of Music (1959).\n\nLater performances continued to bring fame and additional awards as top stars such as Julie Andrews (1935–) and Patti LuPone (1949–) recorded Rodgers's songs and acted in revivals. A revival of Oklahoma! was presented in London in 2001. It was shown on Broadway in 2002 to critical praise.\n\nOne of the biggest breakthroughs in carrying on Rodgers's work was the transfer to videotape of a superior 1954 original movie of Oklahoma! It surpassed a same-cast, second filming of poorer quality and performance that had circulated for years. It took until 1994, when equipment finally was developed to transfer the \"original edition\" onto video for mass distribution.\n\nRodgers is remembered not only for his beautiful melodies, but also for the advancements he made for the American musical theater through his work with Hart and, especially, with Hammerstein."
