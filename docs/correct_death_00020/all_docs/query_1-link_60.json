He also composed music for films and television. He is best known for his songwriting partnerships with the lyricists Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II.\n\nRodgers was the first person to win what are considered the top show business awards in television, recording, movies and Broadway—an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony—now known collectively as an EGOT. He also won a Pulitzer Prize, making him one of two people (Marvin Hamlisch is the other) to receive each award.\n\nBorn into a prosperous ethnic German Jewish family in Arverne, Queens, New York City, Rodgers was the son of Mamie (Levy) and Dr. William Abrahams Rodgers, a prominent physician who had changed the family name from Rogazinsky.[1] Richard began playing the piano at age six. He attended P.S. 10, Townsend Harris Hall and DeWitt Clinton High School. Rodgers spent his early teenage summers in Camp Wigwam (Waterford, Maine) where he composed some of his first songs.\n\nHe wrote the music for the musicals Oklahoma! (1944), South Pacific (1950), The King and I (1951), The Sound of Music (1959), and dozens of others. They included songs like \"Funny Valentine,\" \"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin',\" \"Getting to Know You,\" and \"My Favorite Things.\" He collaborated with the lyricist Lorenz Hart for more than 20 years. When Hart died in 1943, Rodgers asked his friend Oscar Hammerstein II to write a musical with him. He agreed, and they wrote Oklahoma!, one of Broadway's biggest hits.\n\nIn 1930, Rodgers married Dorothy Belle Feiner. [2]Their daughter, Mary, was the composer of Once Upon a Mattress and an author of children's books. The Rodgerses later lost a daughter at birth, but another daughter, Linda, was born in the 1930s.\n\nRodgers died in 1979 at age 77 [3]after surviving cancer of the jaw, a heart attack, and a laryngectomy. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea.\n\nCensus\n\n1905 Census: Manhattan, A.D. 31, E.D. 19, New York, New York[4] Name Relation Sex Age Birth Place William A Rodgers Head M 34y United States Mamie Rodgers Wife F 30y United States Mortimer U Rodgers Son M 7y United States Richard C Rodgers Son M 3y United States Jacob K Levy Father-In-Law M 54y Russia Rachel Levy Mother-In-Law F 50y United States Leurine Levy Uncle M 45y United States Margette Burns Servant F 40y Austria Sophie Hesselsmidt Servant F 24y Austria Flora Ridder Servant F 18y United States Micheal Egan Servant M 23y United States Emily Egan Servant F 20y United States\n\n1910 United States Federal Census: Manhattan Ward 12, New York, New York, United States [5] Name Relation Status Sex Age Birth Place Jacob Levy Head Married M 60 Russia Rachel Levy Wife Married F 57 Russia Samuel Lewine Brother-in-law Single M 50 New York William A Rodgers Son-in-law Married M 39 Missouri Mamie Rodgers Daughter Married F 37 New York Mortimer W Rodgers Grandchild Single M 12 New York Richard C Rodgers Grandchild Single M 7 New York Julia Anderson Servant Single F 19 New York Annie Fox Servant Single F 38 Ireland\n\n1920 United States Federal Census: New York City, New York, United States[6] Name Relation Status Sex Age Birth Place William A Rodgers Head Married M 48 Missouri Mamie Rodgers Wife Married F 46 New York Mortimer W Rodgers Son Single M 21 New York Richard C Rodgers Son Single M 16 New York Jacob K Levy Father-in-law Married M 70 Russia Rachael Levy Mother-in-law Married F 67 New York\n\n1930 United States Federal Census: Manhattan (Districts 0501-0750), New York, New York, United States [7] Name Relation Status Sex Age Birth Place Richard Rodgers Head Married M 28 New York Dorothy Rodgers Wife Married F 20 New York\n\n1940 Census: New York City, New York County, New York, United States [8] Name Relation Status Sex Age Birth Place Richard Rodgers Head Married M 37 New York Dorothy Rodgers Wife Married F 30 New York Mary Rodgers Daughter Single F 9 New York Linda Rodgers Daughter Single F 5 New York Mary Riley Maid Single F 33 Ireland\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"New York, New York City Births, 1846-1909,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:27YC-HVX : 20 March 2015), Richard Charles Rodgers, 28 Jun 1902; citing Manhattan, New York, New York, United States, reference v 3 cn 1436 New York Municipal Archives, New York; FHL microfilm 1,993,068.\n\n↑ \"New York, New York City Marriage Records, 1829-1940,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2487-TZ7 : 20 March 2015), Richard Rodgers and Dorothy Feiner, Mar 1930; citing Marriage, Manhattan, New York, New York, United States, New York City Municipal Archives, New York; FHL microfilm 1,653,975.\n\n↑ \"United States Social Security Death Index,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:JG7C-95Q : 19 May 2014), Richard Rodgers, Dec 1979; citing U.S. Social Security Administration, Death Master File, database (Alexandria, Virginia: National Technical Information Service, ongoing).\n\n↑ \"New York State Census, 1905\"\n\nCiting p. 7, line 4, various county clerk offices, New York; FHL microfilm 1,433,113.\n\nFamilySearch (accessed 27 December 2021)\n\nRichard C Rodgers (3y) in Manhattan, A.D. 31, E.D. 19, New York, New York.\n\n↑ \"United States Census, 1910\"\n\nCiting enumeration district (ED) ED 493, sheet 13A, family 248, NARA microfilm publication T624 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1982), roll 1020; FHL microfilm 1,375,033.\n\nFamilySearch (accessed 27 December 2021)\n\nFamilySearch Image Image number 00889\n\nRichard C Rodgers (7), single grandchild in household of Jacob Levy (60) in Manhattan Ward 12, New York, New York, United States.
