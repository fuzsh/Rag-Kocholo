        "text": "Richard \"Dick\" Rodgers was received by his Savior on Thanksgiving Day, November 26, 2020 while residing at Corry Manor Nursing Home in Corry, PA.\n\nDick married Betty Corll when he was 17 years old and she was 20. In order to provide for his family he worked long hard hours as an independent truck driver. As a Teamster he spent many days away from his family hauling steel up and down the East Coast. His hard work put three children through college and sent his oldest son off to serve our country in the U.S. Navy during the very uncertain days of the Viet Nam war.\n\nAfter retiring Dick found his favorite work as a faithful servant of the Lord. He served as a deacon at First Baptist Church of North East as well as teaching Sunday school to the youth. More recently they were members of North Harbor Baptist Church of Harborcreek, PA. He was a servant in every sense of the word as he visited people in nursing homes, visited shut-ins, drove those in need to doctor's appointments and picked people up and took them to church. He had the gift of giving and was generous with his time and resources.\n\nDick was the first born of six children to Harold and Eva Rodgers in Clymer, New York on April 2, 1935. He is survived by his wife of 68 years, Betty (Corll) Rodgers, his four children Richard \"Dale\" Rodgers, Donald Wayne Rodgers, Cheryl Lynn Rodgers Hasty and David Matthew Rodgers. Dick had 9 grandchildren and 12 great grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his parents, Harold Rodgers and Eva Rodgers and two brothers, Ronald Rodgers and Daniel Rodgers. He is survived by his siblings Robert Rodgers of Salina, Kansas, Betty Fleck of Leesburg, Florida and Barb Swineheart of Ripley, New York.\n\nThe family would like to give a special thank you to the nurses and CNA's who cared for Dick at Corry Manor. They showed patience, compassion and gave him the best of care. We would also like to thank the Community Nurses Association of North East who helped pave the way for Dick's placement and care at Corry Manor.\n\nDick will be laid to rest at Grahamville Cemetery in North East, PA. There will be no viewing and no funeral service. Arrangements entrusted to Burton Quinn Scott Cremation & Funeral Service Inc. Downtown 602 W. 10th Street, Erie.\n\nCondolences can be left on Burton Quinn-Scott website (www.burtonfuneralhomes.com)\n\nRecently found in Dick's office was a note that he had written to himself and taped to his desk. It said:\n\nMY CHOICE\n\nI refuse to be discouraged\n\nI refuse to be distressed\n\nI choose to lean on my Jehovah-God\n\nI choose to be bountifully blessed\n\nI refuse to be sad and troubled\n\nI refuse to drown in despair\n\nI choose to live happily with my Father\n\nI choose to stay near to Him in prayer\n\nI have fought the good fight, I finished the race, and I have remained faithful. (2 Timothy 4:7)"
