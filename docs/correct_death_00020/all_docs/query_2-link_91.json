        "text": "Oscar Hammerstein II : Show Boat\n\nThe original cast listing, full-color photos from the Broadway production, and nine stellar songs from this musical classic: Bill - Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man - I Have the Room Above - Life upon the Wicked Stage - Make Believe - Mis'ry's Comin' Aroun' - Ol' Man River - Why Do I Love You? - You Are Love.\n\nSonglist: You Are Love, I Have The Room Above, Mis'ry's Comin' Aroun', Make Believe, Bill, Ol' Man River, Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man, Life Upon The Wicked Stage, Why Do I Love You?\n\nVoicing: Solo | 20174b | Songbook | $18.95 ON SALE $14.95 | PVG\n\nProfessional Tracks for Serious Singers : Sing the Songs of Rodgers and Hart (for Female Vocalists)\n\nEight hits from Rodgers & Hart are presented in this package which is designed to provide the at-home singer with an actual professional setting. The CD features orchestral interludes and instrumental solos typical of a live club performance, retaining the natural performance flow of an actual performance with an accompanying rhythm section or orchestra.\n\nSonglist: I Didn't Know What Time It Was, My Funny Valentine, Nobody's Heart Belongs to Me, A Ship Without a Sail, Dancing on the Ceiling, It Never Entered My Mind, There's a Small Hotel, Where or When\n\nVoicing: Solo | 8366b | Songbook & CD | $24.95 | Voice with Jazz Combo\n\nRichard Rodgers : The Songs of Richard Rodgers - High Voice\n\nThe most accomplished composer in the history of the American musical theatre was Richard Rodgers (1902-1979), with a professional career on Broadway that spanned more than 50 years. In an edition designed especially for singers, 45 songs have been carefully chosen from both the Rodgers & Hart and Rodgers & Hammerstein output. The accompaniments support the singer, rather than containing the melody in the piano part throughout, as in the standard sheet music editions of these songs. Most of these songs are transposed for the first time ever in this new collection. The song selection is almost the same for High Voice and Low Voice; (Soliloquy from Carousel only appears in in Low Voice, and My Lord and Master from The King and I only appears in in High Voice).\n\nSonglist: Manhattan, No Other Love, Bewitched, Some Enchanted Evening, Climb Ev'ry Mountain, Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?, Edelweiss, Falling In Love With Love, Hello, Young Lovers, I Could Write A Book, I Didn't Know What Time It Was, I Have Dreamed, I Wish I Were In Love Again, If I Loved You, Isn't It Romantic?, It Might As Well Be Spring, It Never Entered My Mind, The Lady is a Tramp, Love, Look Away, My Favorite Things, My Funny Valentine, My Heart Stood Still, My Lord And Master, My Romance, Nobody's Heart, Oh, What A Beautiful Mornin', People Will Say We're In Love, Something Wonderful, The Sound Of Music, The Surrey With The Fringe On Top, and more\n\nVoicing: Solo | 3088b | Songbook | $18.95 | With Piano\n\nRichard Rodgers : The Songs of Richard Rodgers - Low Voice\n\nThe most accomplished composer in the history of the American musical theatre was Richard Rodgers (1902-1979), with a professional career on Broadway that spanned more than 50 years. In an edition designed especially for singers, 45 songs have been carefully chosen from both the Rodgers & Hart and Rodgers & Hammerstein output. The accompaniments support the singer, rather than containing the melody in the piano part throughout, as in the standard sheet music editions of these songs. Most of these songs are transposed for the first time ever in this new collection. The song selection is almost the same for High Voice and Low Voice; a very few major songs that are especially voice-type specific have not been transposed (for example, Soliloquy from Carousel in Low Voice, My Lord and Master from The King and I in High Voice).
