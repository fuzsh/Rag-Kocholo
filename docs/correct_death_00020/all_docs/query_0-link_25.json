        "text": "226 West 46th Street\n\nNew York, NY 10036\n\nHamilton\n\nHamilton, the new musical by the creator of In the Heights, Lin-Manuel Miranda is on Broadway after transferring from it’s sold out run at the Public Theatre. Hamilton tells the story of the beginnings of the United States through the life of Alexander Hamilton, the man who was our country’s first Treasury Secretary. It is the story of a bastard orphan who became George Washington’s right hand and who lived a life that was both unendingly interesting and dauntingly overwhelming.\n\nOriginally named Chanin’s 46th Street Theatre, the venue was constructed by Irwin Chanin and opened in 1924. The Shuberts bought the venue in 1931 and renamed it the 46th Street Theatre. The Nederlander Organization purchased and renovated the theatre in 1982. It was renamed in 1990 in honor of the composer Richard Rodgers whose shows successfully ran on Broadway for over 30 years. Notable musicals this theatre has housed include Guys and Dolls, How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying, Nine, Movin’ Out, Anything Goes, Damn Yankees, The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas, and Chicago. In 2006, the theatre was renovated and it currently houses The Richard Rodgers Gallery. The Richard Rodgers is one of the Nederlander Organization’s nine Broadway theatres. It currently holds the record as the venue that has housed the most Tony Award-winning Best Plays and Best Musicals."
