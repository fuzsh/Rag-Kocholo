        "text": "Richard Rodgers wrote some of the most enduring songs in Broadway history in collaboration with two supremely gifted lyricists, Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II. Rodgers & Hart collaborated on over two-dozen musicals, including their biggest hit, Pal Joey. With Hammerstein, Rodgers produced some of the biggest blockbusters in the history of musical theater. Starting with the Pulitzer Prize-winning Oklahoma!, the magnificent Carousel (often regarded as Rodgers & Hammersteinâs best score), South Pacific, which won their second Pulitzer Prize, and their final smash hit, The Sound of Music. Rodgers died in December 1979."
