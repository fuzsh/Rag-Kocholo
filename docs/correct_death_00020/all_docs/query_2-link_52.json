        "text": "Whatever time of year you visit New York, one of the essential things to do is to see a musical on Broadway, the famous theatre-lined boulevard that runs through the centre of Manhattan including Times Square.\n\nWith hundreds of performances a year, Broadway is the mecca of New York theatre. Many Hollywood actors have graced its stages to delight us with their talent and great actors (although not so well known) work hard every performance to become established.\n\nI remember the first time I attended a Broadway musical in New York and it was one of the most exciting moments of the trip. Not only because I love theatre, but because the magic of Broadway is something unique that you won't find anywhere else.\n\nIts musical numbers and majestic stagings transport you to a world of fantasy and leave you speechless, even if you're not even passionate about theatre! Here is a list of what, for me, are the best.\n\n1. The Lion King\n\nThe throne of Broadway musicals belongs to Simba, those who buy tickets for The Lion King will be in front of the adaptation of the famous Disney animated film and on numerous occasions it has been recognised as the best musical of all. With stunning set design and music by Elton John, it has won six Tony Awards and an Evening Standard Award.\n\nSince 1997 it has been the best-selling musical in New York because it is one of the most powerful productions on Broadway. There is nothing like it!\n\nIf you have seen the film you will know the story of little Simba, the lion prince whose evil uncle Scar wants to take the throne away from him. To do this, he sets him a trap where his father Mufasa, the king of the savannah, dies.\n\nScar tricks him into believing that his father has perished because of him, so Simba escapes from the kingdom. Years later, the young prince learns that under his uncle's rule, the savannah has deteriorated and it is then that he decides to confront the usurper and regain his place in \"the cycle of life.\"\n\nWhy you can't miss it\n\nThe Lion King's soundtrack is superb, as is the characterisation of the actors and the staging. In addition, the story teaches values that never go out of fashion. Undoubtedly, an amazing show that manages to evade the real world for more than two hours.\n\nIdeal for...\n\nAll audiences, children and adults alike will enjoy it.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nYou can buy tickets for The Lion King Broadway in the official website of Hellotickets: Tickets The Lion King Broadway\n\nUseful info\n\nWhere: Minskoff Theatre (200 W 45th St, New York, 10036)\n\nHow long does it last: 2 hours and 30 minutes with an intermission.\n\nWant to know more?

In this theatrical adaptation of the popular 90's animated film, everything is surprising, amazing and extraordinary. Another Disney classic that deserves its musical version!\n\nThanks to a brilliant staging, a careful characterization of the characters, some novel songs and the always hilarious humour of the Genie, this is one of the Broadway musicals that is causing more furore among the public. And everyone who comes to the New Amsterdam Theatre to see Aladdin for the first time will come back for more!\n\nThe story begins when Aladdin, a young petty thief from Agrabah, finds a magic lamp with which he can make three wishes to fix his life and escape poverty. With one of them he wants to become a prince to conquer Yasmine, the beautiful daughter of the sultan with whom he has fallen in love, but the evil royal vizier has other plans for the Genie of the lamp that will endanger all the inhabitants of the city.\n\nWhy you can't miss it\n\nThe musical Aladdin is one of New York's must-see musicals. Anyone who knows the songs from the film will be able to hum along to the music and it 's so much fun that the 2.5 hours will fly by.\n\nSpeaking of flying, the scene in the number \"An Ideal World\", where the main characters fly over the city on a magic carpet, is simply magnificent and will leave you speechless!\n\nIdeal for...\n\nAll audiences, children and adults alike will enjoy it.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nYou can buy tickets for Aladdin on the official website of Hellotickets: Aladdin Broadway Tickets\n\nUseful info about Aladdin Broadway\n\nWhere: New Amsterdam Theatre (214 W 42nd St)\n\nRunning time: 2 hours and 30 minutes with an intermission.\n\nWant to know more? Check out this article about the Broadway musical Aladdin.\n\n3. Chicago\n\nAnother of the great Broadway musical productions for which you can buy tickets: Chicago Broadway. A classic that takes us back each season to the happy 20's.\n\nWith jazz music as a backdrop and Prohibition that favoured clandestine activities, corruption and murder in the big city, this show is aimed at a more adult audience but sneaks into high positions in the top 10 because it is one of the greats of Broadway. Such is its success that it has won 6 Tony Awards and the recording of the musical's songs won a Grammy Award as well.\n\nChicago tells the story of Roxie Hart, an innocent debutante actress who dreams of following in the footsteps of the famous vaudeville performer Velma Kelly. However, a series of misguided events leads to both ending up in prison on murder charges.\n\nUnder the devious care of prison warden Morton, Roxie gets the legendary and shrewd lawyer Billy Flynn to take on her case for a hefty fee. In prison, Roxie's career takes off much to the chagrin of her mentor and Velma Kelly but the artist has an ace up her sleeve for the second act...\n\nWhy you can't miss it\n\nIf you've seen the 2002 film starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renée Zellweger and Richard Gere you can get an idea of the fantastic musical numbers you'll see on stage, but seeing these spectacular choreographies live, delicately staged and feeling the music from your seat is a unique experience and totally recommended.\n\nIdeal for...\n\nAdults. This show may not be suitable for children 12 years and younger.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nYou can buy tickets for Chicago on the official Hellotickets website: Tickets Chicago Broadway\n\nUseful info\n\nWhere: Ambassador Theatre (219 West 49th Street, between Broadway and 8th Avenue).\n\nDuration: 2 hours and 30 minutes with an intermission.\n\nWant to know more? Check out this article about the Broadway musical Chicago.\n\n4. Moulin Rouge\n\nIf you're a fan of Baz Luhrmann's award-winning film starring Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in 2001, you can't miss out on tickets to the Broadway musical Moulin Rouge. A sensational experience full of colour, lights and emotions that will immerse you in the bohemian Paris of 1900.\n\nIn fact, the theatre in which it is performed has a structure and finishes that perfectly match the theme of the musical and makes you feel part of the story. It is the ideal occasion to relive the magic of the spectacular Moulin Rouge soundtrack with the \"Can-can\" or \"Lady Marmelade\" and the romantic love story between the young writer Christian and Satine, the star of the cabaret. A celebration of truth, beauty, freedom and, especially, love!\n\nWhy you can't miss it\n\nAlthough it is not a carbon copy of the film, the musical retains all the essence of the film, as the set design of the musical even includes the symbolic red windmill, the giant elephant and all the flavour of the cabaret, but it is also modernised by adding recent songs to its repertoire, which makes you identify more with the story. The result is daring, dazzling and exciting. Are you ready to dance?\n\nIdeal for...\n\nAdults. We recommend tickets for children over 12 years old.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nYou can buy tickets for Moulin Rouge on the official website of Hellotickets: Tickets Moulin Rouge Broadway\n\nUseful information about Moulin Rouge\n\nWhere: Al Hirschfeld Theatre (302 West 45th Street between 8th and 9th Avenue).\n\nHow long does it last: 2 hours and 35 minutes with an intermission.\n\nWant to know more? Check out this article about the Broadway musical Moulin Rouge.\n\n5. The Life Story of Michael Jackson\n\nEveryone knows his music and almost everyone knows his life, which is precisely why tickets for the Michael Jackson musical are in such high demand. Few fans of the King of Pop will be able to resist the show at Broadway's Neil Simon Theatre. If you've seen any of his music videos (and I'm sure you have) you can already get an idea of what to expect.\n\nDirector and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon is in charge of the show that is revolutionising Broadway and which, of course, includes songs such as \"Billie Jean\", \"Thriller\", \"Bad\", \"Black or White\" and \"I'll be there\". A total of 30 of his songs, taking as a starting point the rehearsals of his 1992 Dangerous tour and going back to his past, covering his childhood in the Jackson 5 and his adolescence.\n\nWhy you can't miss it\n\nBecause it's not just another tribute to Michael Jackson, as the show has been made in collaboration with his children and prioritises the King of Pop's musical legacy over the controversies surrounding the character.\n\nIdeal for...\n\nMusic lovers in general, whether or not they are Michael Jackson fans, as both the story and the staging entertain all audiences.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nYou can buy tickets for the Michael Jackson's musical in the official website of Hellotickets: Michael Jackson Broadway Tickets\n\nUseful information\n\nWhere: Neil Simon Theatre (250 West 52nd Street between 7th and 8th Avenue).\n\nHow long does it last: 2 hours\n\n6. The Book of Mormon\n\nIf you want to laugh your head off at a Broadway musical, you've got to see The Book of Mormon. This satire about a Mormon couple trying to preach their religion in Uganda will leave you with a good taste in your mouth.\n\nThe trouble that the two disparate missionaries get into in a troubled part of the African country will keep you laughing throughout the show. The controversial humour of this musical by the creators of the South Park series is, without a doubt, its highlight.\n\nWhy you can't miss it\n\nAs criticised at the beginning as it was praised and awarded afterwards, this musical leaves no one indifferent, for its respectful message towards religion and social justice. In addition, its visual effects, its carefully designed set design and its cast of artists will make you understand why it is among the best Broadway musicals.\n\nIdeal for\n\nAdults with a good sense of humour who want to see a play with beautiful values that is recognised worldwide.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nYou can buy tickets for The Book of Mormon in New York on the official website of Hellotickets: Tickets for The Book of Mormon\n\nUseful info\n\nWhere: Eugene O'Neill Theatre (230 West 49th Street, between Broadway and 8th Avenue, New York)\n\nHow long does it last: 2 hours and 30 minutes with an intermission.\n\nWant to know more? Check out this article about The Book of Mormon on Broadway; all about this musical.\n\n7. Hamilton\n\nCan you imagine hearing the story of the birth of the United States from the mouth of one of its founding fathers and to the rhythm of rap? Just buy tickets to see Hamilton on Broadway. A phenomenon in recent years!\n\nThe show tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, an orphan from the Caribbean who through a series of events ends up coming to the United States and becoming a major figure in both the American Revolutionary War and the nation's first government.\n\nAlthough I loved it, Hamilton is one of the few Broadway musicals for which you'll need to have a good grounding in English, as they use a lot of puns and sing fast, so it can be easy to get lost at times.\n\nWhy you can't miss it\n\nWhat's compelling about this musical is that the story is told in an unconventional way through interactive staging with spectacular sound and light effects. In addition, it is a play in which there is hardly any dialogue other than through songs. Each and every one of them is unique to this musical.\n\nIndeed, Hamilton is a mind-blowing experience that immerses you in one of the most exciting episodes in American history. Not surprisingly, this Broadway musical is one of the most sought-after musicals by audiences and has won 11 Tony Awards, although it was nominated for 16. More than any other show has ever won!\n\nIdeal for...\n\nAdults and children aged 10 and over, with a good level of English.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nYou can buy tickets for Hamilton at the official Hellotickets website: Hamilton Broadway Tickets\n\nUseful info\n\nWhere: Richard Rodgers Theatre (226 West 46th Street between Broadway and 8th Avenue).\n\nRunning time: 2 hours and 40 minutes with an intermission.\n\nWant to know more? Check out this article about the Broadway musical Hamilton.\n\n8. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\n\nThe musical of one of the most famous characters of all time has finally arrived in New York; you can now buy tickets for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on Broadway. This super production comes straight from London and has fantastic reviews. Although it's only been running at the Lyric Theatre in New York since 2018, it's already undoubtedly one of the most popular with audiences.\n\nThe plot doesn't replicate any of the films, but is a storyline that you'll only see in the musical. The script was written by J.K. Rowling herself and is set 17 years after Harry defeated Voldemort. Harry is now an employee of the Ministry of Magic, married and father of three children. This starting point is the beginning of a play that has won several Tony Awards, including Best Musical, and holds the record for the highest single-week ticket sales in Broadway history.\n\nWhy you can't miss it\n\nThe musical's set design, special effects and soundtrack are magnificent. But most of all, because it completes the Harry Potter story in a way that no other film, spin-off or novel has done. It is a true sequel written by the author and no fan of the saga can miss it.\n\nIdeal for...\n\nMuggles, of course!\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nYou can buy tickets for Harry Potter on the official website of Hellotickets: Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Broadway Tickets\n\nUseful info\n\nWhere: Lyric Theatre, very close to Time's Square (214 W 43rd St, New York, 10036).\n\nRunning time: 2 hours and 40 minutes with an intermission.\n\nWant to know more? Check out this article about the Harry Potter musical on Broadway.\n\n9. Wicked\n\nWicked tickets give you access to the most spellbinding Broadway musical ever! The prequel to the famous story of The Wizard of Oz, Wicked is a thrilling and suspenseful play about friendship, a theme suitable for all audiences.\n\nIt tells the story of Elphaba and Glinda, two young students of witchcraft who meet in the land of Oz and, despite their differences, strike up a great friendship. On the one hand, Elphaba is an intelligent but somewhat withdrawn sorceress who struggles to make a place for herself in the world. On the other, Glinda is outgoing and very popular at the university. The circumstances of life will bring them together for some fun times but something happens and the two will drift apart until they become the Wicked Witch of the West and the Good Witch.\n\nWhy you can't miss it\n\nSince its premiere in 2003, Wicked has been one of Broadway's biggest hits. As a fresh and entertaining show with intrigue, humour and impressive staging, it has won 3 Tony Awards and a Grammy for Best Score for a Musical. It also remains on the podium of the highest grossing Broadway musicals along with The Phantom of the Opera and The Lion King.\n\nGet ready to see the flying monkeys! You'll never look at The Wizard of Oz with the same eyes again.\n\nIdeal for...\n\nAll audiences, children and adults alike will enjoy it.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nYou can buy tickets for Wicked on the official Hellotickets website: Wicked Broadway Tickets\n\nUseful info\n\nWhere: Gershwin Theatre (222 W 51st St, New York, 10019).\n\nRunning time: 2 hours 45 minutes, including a 15 minute intermission.\n\nWant to know more?

Radio City Christmas Spectacular\n\nWhen you travel to New York, you're sure to have a busy schedule visiting a multitude of museums and doing all kinds of tours around the city, but if your trip coincides with Christmas, you can't miss the legendary Radio City Christmas Spectacular, only available during the Christmas season.\n\nIt's a magical Christmas story that was first performed in 1933 and has become a real Christmas tradition.\n\nIt really is as spectacular as the name says! A show like the ones of yesteryear with music, humour, dance and light effects starring the fantastic The Rockettes, which makes you relive Christmas with the illusion of a child.\n\nWhy you can't miss it\n\nThe funny thing about the Radio City Christmas Spectacular is that the show changes every year and is always a surprise. If you're going to New York with your family, I highly recommend it because the Radio City Christmas Spectacular is suitable for all ages and the kids will have a great time.\n\nIdeal for...\n\nA trip to New York at Christmas. Equally amazing for kids and adults alike, who will enjoy it equally as much.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nYou can buy tickets for Radio City Christmas Spectacular on the official website of Hellotickets: Radio City Christmas Spectacular Tickets\n\nUseful info\n\nWhere: Radio City Music Hall Theatre in Rockefeller Center (1260 6th Ave, New York, 10020)\n\nHow long does it last: 1 hour and 30 minutes without intermission.\n\nWant to know more? Check out this article about the musical Radio City Christmas and find out everything you need to know about the show.\n\nHow to buy Broadway tickets online\n\nIf you want to attend a Broadway musical during your trip to New York, my advice is to buy your tickets online before you travel because there are shows in high demand, the theatres fill up and the box offices quickly hang the Sold Out sign.\n\nHow to buy Broadway tickets at the theatre box office\n\nIn my experience, I don't think this is the most advisable option. There are several reasons for this, which I will explain below:\n\nHow do you choose the best seat to see the musical?\n\nAnother big question you may have when buying tickets for a Broadway musical is how to get the best seats in the theatre to see the show. My advice is to try to find a balance between the type of tickets the theatre offers and the budget you have available.\n\nGenerally, the most expensive seats are in the Orchestra area in the centre and from there you will be able to see the whole show perfectly. The Mezzanine and Balcony areas are the second and third rings respectively. Depending on how large the theatre is, these sections will be more or less far away from the stage.\n\nKeep this in mind!\n\nWhen buying tickets for a Broadway musical, there are a few basic things to keep in mind:\n\nAnd if I don't speak English, is it worth going to a musical?\n\nAbsolutely yes! Some people are hesitant to go to the theatre in the United States because they don't speak English, but this is not a problem on Broadway. Remember that musicals are not films with long dialogues but the storyline is full of musical numbers, choreographies and songs that will help you to follow the plot easily.\n\nIn any case, if you are still hesitating, my advice is to opt for a musical that has been made into a film, such as Chicago, The Lion King, or Aladdin. If you check the film before you travel, it will be much easier to follow because they usually have the same script.\n\nHowever, New York theatres are aware that they attract foreign audiences to their theatres, so they are prepared in this regard. The biggest box-office hits usually offer the option of renting headphones that summarise each scene in Spanish, so you'll be up to date with everything that happens on stage.\n\nThey costabout 10 dollars and you have to leave your passport at the window as a guarantee, which you get back at the end of the show when you return the headphones.\n\nThe musicals that currently have this service are: The Lion King, Phantom of the Opera, Aladdin, Wicked, Dear Evan Hansen, Book of Mormon and Come From Away. However, if you wish to rent one of these headphones, my recommendation is to ask at the theatre box office if they are available for a particular play.\n\nHow far in advance should I arrive at the theatre?\n\nNew York is a city of long distances and heavy traffic, so to avoid arriving too early for the start time of the show, I recommend that you arrive 30 to 45 minutes early to enter the theatre calmly, buy a bowl of popcorn or some merchandising and find your seats.\n\nIt is important to arrive at the theatre early because if you arrive late, once the musical has started, the staff will not allow you in. It would be a shame if you missed the show because of traffic!\n\nHow long does the musical last?\n\nA Broadway musical usually lasts between 2 and 2.5 hours. It is divided into acts and there are breaks in between, so you can go out to the restroom and stretch your legs without missing a minute of the show.\n\nKnowing the duration of the show you have chosen is essential for you to be able to organise the plan of activities you will do that day.\n\nKids and Broadway musicals\n\nAttending a Broadway musical is one of the must-do things to do on a trip to New York with kids- it's an amazing display of lights, colour, music and dance that kids will love! There are many shows whose themes and staging are perfect for family audiences.\n\nAdmission for children\n\nHowever, you should know that most Broadway theatres do not admit children under the age of 4. These policies are set by individual theatres. Also, unfortunately, none of the Broadway musicals sell special tickets for children, so all theatregoers must pay the same price for tickets.\n\nHow to choose a musical?\n\nWhen choosing a Broadway musical, parents should know a little about the plot of the show in question, but other aspects to take into account are the length of the show, the special effects and the language used in the dialogue. This way, you can choose the musical that is most appropriate for your family.\n\nWhat happens if a child has a tantrum during the show?\n\nSometimes a child may have a tantrum in the middle of the show, either because they are tired, hungry or sleepy. If this happens, the usher may kindly ask the child and a parent to leave the auditorium until the child calms down and can return later to continue watching the performance.\n\nIs there etiquette for attending a Broadway musical?\n\nAlthough there is no specific dress code for going to a musical, no one is usually overdressed and comfortable, appropriate clothing is the norm. So you can spend the day sightseeing and end the day enjoying a fascinating Broadway musical - your legs will thank you for it after all that walking around New York!\n\nWhere to eat near the theatres?\n\nIt is quite common that the most popular times to go to a Broadway musical are in the late evening, i.e. around 7 or 8 PM. Mainly because it allows you to spend the whole day sightseeing and get to the musical just when you need to take a break.\n\nOnce the show is over, you're sure to work up an appetite. What to have for dinner that day? Here's a list of the best places to eat in New York\n\nBroadway is located in the heart of Times Square and everything is open all the time, so it's easy to find a place to grab a bite to eat and savour delicious burgers like Shake Shack (691 8th Ave), delicious arepas like Empanada Mama (763 9th Ave) or tasty tacos like Los Tacos No. 1 (75 9th Ave).\n\nNew York is a city of endless culinary possibilities. If you want to avoid the tourist traps and eat well without going broke trying, I recommend you take a look at my article The 10 best places to eat in New York.\n\nWhat other events can I go to in New York?\n\nNew York is a city full of possibilities for fun, where there is plenty to see and do. If you want to attend another event during your holiday and you are a sports fan I recommend other options such as:"
