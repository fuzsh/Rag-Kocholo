        "text": "Richard L. Rodgers, 93\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\nRichard L. Rodgers, 93, of Lititz, entered the gates of Heaven on February 21, 2024. Born in Port Matilda, PA, he was the son of the late Paul and June Rodgers. He was the devoted husband of Alma (Dunkel) Rodgers for over 67 years.\n\nHe found great peace being outdoors whether it was hunting, fishing, or camping throughout the United States and Canada. He and Alma also enjoyed traveling, in particular Richard treasured their trip to Mexico and always wanted to return. Most importantly, Richard was dedicated to his family. He loved hosting picnics for his friends and family.\n\nA long-time trucker, he dedicated over 42 years to Yellow Freight before his retirement. He was a member of the Masonic Lodge in Reading, as well as the Lions Club, and a proud veteran of the United States Navy.\n\nHe will be sorely missed by his wife Alma and sons, Robert Rodgers, husband of Sherri and Matthew Rodgers, all of Lititz, and a host of grandchildren and great grandchildren. He was preceded in passing by his sons, Jeffry Rodgers, and Rodman Rodgers, as well as his siblings.\n\nThe family is welcoming guests to a viewing at 2 PM on Saturday, March 2, 2024, at the Charles F. Snyder Jr. Funeral Home & Crematory, 3110 Lititz Pike, Lititz, PA 17543, with a funeral service beginning at 3 PM. Interment will take place at Ft. Indiantown Gap National Cemetery. Memorial contributions may be made in Richardâ€™s memory to Wounded Warrior Project.\n\nWatch the tribute video"
