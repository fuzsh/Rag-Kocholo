        "text": "Come 2022 and Mumbaikars will be able to experience newly designed suburb railways stations equipped with world-class modern amenities. The plan for giving 19 Mumbai suburb stations have been submitted by the Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) to the railway board for approval.\n\nThe 19 stations in the plan were chosen based on the footfall and will be designed and developed to be decongested and be equipped to provide better facilities for the daily commuters. Apart from these 19 stations, nine other stations will be rebuilt to up the revenue. The complete project will cost Rs 880 crore.\n\nThe stations\n\nThe stations that will be given a makeover include Mumbai Central, Jogeshwari, Kandiwali, Mira Road, Bhayandar, Vasai Road, Nallasopara and Virar on the western railway while Bhandup, Mulund, Thane, Dombivli, Shahad, Neral, Kasara on the central railway and GTB Nagar, Chembur, Govandi, Mankhurd on the harbour line.\n\nThe stations that will be rebuilt to make them commercially viable include Ghatkopar, Mumbai Central, Sion, Wadala Road, Kalyan, Kurla, Dadar, Parel and Bandra.\n\nThe plan\n\nAccording to the plan submitted by the MRVC, all stations would have elevated decks to give more space to passengers. These decks would have ticket booking offices, foot-over-bridges and skywalks leading to the platforms. At present, only the Andheri and the Goregaon stations have elevated decks that have benefitted the commuters.\n\n*According to the proposed plan for the Mulund station redevelopment, the multiple entry points in the west will be closed and replaced with two entry halls. A wide deck will be constructed to connect the existing foot-over-bridges. All the station rooms and offices will also be deck-level while the ground level will be used for parking, escalators and elevators.\n\n*For the Virar station, improved passenger amenities will be installed such as escalators and lifts along with pick-up and drop-off points for auto rickshaws, taxis, railway offices and quarters.\n\n*At the Chembur station, commercial complexes will be built for on-the-go shopping experience.\n\n*At GTB Nagar, overbridges and the new platform will be built that would connect roads with the station.\n\nThe funding\n\nThe project falls under the Rs 54,000-crore Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP). In the previous state Budget, a token allocation of Rs 1 crore was made towards MUTP for several big-ticket railway infrastructure projects such as an elevated fast corridor between Panvel and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). According to the media reports, railway officials said the station improvement project is estimated to cost around Rs 880 crore and is expected to be executed by 2022.\n\nEarlier, Hafeez Contractor has offered to design 19 railway stations across the country for free. The government is yet to finalise the design consultant."
