        "text": "While the Central Railway has formed eight teams for the task, the Western Railway has set up five. They have roped in representatives of five municipal corporations, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).\n\nHours after the railway foot overbridge (FOB) stampede on September 29, Goyal had announced a safety and capacity audit of all FOBs on the suburban train network, considered the lifeline of the city and its satellite towns. He had also ordered an inquiry by the Chief Safety Officer of the Western Railway.\n\nApart from the BMC, officials of Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC), Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Corporation (MBMC), the Government Railway Police (GRP) and Mumbai Police are involved in the exercise, a senior railway official said.\n\n\"These teams would do multi-disciplinary audit of 36 suburban stations of the WR and 76 stations of the CR. They will study the problem of trespassing, requirement of extension of FOBs or skywalks, requirement of lifts or escalators.\n\nThe teams will click photos and capture videos of the site, if required, and submit the reports to the divisional railway heads within a week. These issues will be taken up further at the higher level, he said.\n\nAsked about the inquiry, a senior WR official said, \"Yes, we launched an inquiry today and we have already published advertisements appealing to people to come forward to share the information related to the stampede.\"He said the statements of two seriously injured passengers were recorded today. If other injured passengers find it difficult to visit the office set up by the railways for the purpose, teams from the public sector transporter will visit them to record their statements, he said."
