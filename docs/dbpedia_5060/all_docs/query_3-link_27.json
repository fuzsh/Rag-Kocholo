        "text": "Mumbai, the financial capital of India, is one of the major contributors to India’s GDP. Currently, Mumbai is undergoing an infrastructure boom. With the development of metro, world-class roads, the upcoming airport in Navi Mumbai and much more, all these upcoming infrastructure projects will further escalate the economic growth of Mumbai and Maharashtra.\n\nApart from reducing travel time and making Mumbaikar’s life easy & convenient, these infrastructure projects will also have a considerable impact on Mumbai’s real estate market. These projects will further enhance the value proposition of Mumbai as a go-to residential and commercial hub in India.\n\nEven undervalued areas in Mumbai like Bhandup, Dombivli, and Kalyan-Shil road will witness development, leading to a surge in housing demand.\n\n1. Mumbai Metro\n\nThe Mumbai metro is designed to reduce the traffic in the city and supplement the overcrowded railway network. When completed, the Mumbai-metro will have 14 metro lines spanning across 350 kilometers. It will be a massive boost in connectivity and infrastructure. The estimated cost of the complete Mumbai Metro project is more than 1.4 lakh crores.\n\nThe metro rail project is comprehensive and connects to every nook and corner of the city. The line 1 running from Ghatkopar to Versova is operational since 2014. Here’s an overview of other metro lines and the areas they cover.\n\nOnce operational, the Mumbai metro will truly change the face of Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai. With its wide reach, comfortable AC coaches, superior quality stations, hassle-free booking experience, and much more, metro rail will be the harbinger of change in people’s lifestyle and commute experience. The Mumbai & Navi-Mumbai metro together will ensure last-mile connectivity to commercial and residential hubs in the city.\n\nOver the next decade, Mumbai is most likely to see completion of all these metro lines. Commercial real estate will benefit a lot because of this extensive metro project. Employees are more likely to prefer offices that are well-connected to major metro lines. Commercial spaces like Marathon Millennium and Marathon Futurex that are close to metro stations will be the preferred choice of employers and employees alike.\n\n2. Navi Mumbai International Airport\n\nThe ambitious Navi Mumbai International airport is one of the landmark projects for Navi Mumbai. It is a greenfield International airport constructed near to Panvel. The overall cost of the project is estimated to be 16,700 crores.\n\nThis airport will pave the way for the development of the city surrounding it. The concept is called airport city or aerotropolis. Dubai has the world’s largest aerotropolis. Aerotropolis are also prevalent in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\n\nNavi Mumbai aerotropolis will create an entire ecosystem of offices, shops, educational centres, and medical facilities. When you look at the potential that Navi Mumbai airport offers, it will drive the demand for housing. The world-class infrastructure coupled with smooth connectivity will encourage MNCs to set up their offices around Panvel and neighbouring areas. The airport city will also trigger some activity in the residential segment as well.\n\nThis upcoming infrastructure project in Navi Mumbai is estimated to cost more than 17,000 crores. The whole project will come to fruition by September 2023. For all the people travelling from Navi mumbai to South Mumbai, this bridge will save them a significant amount of travel time. It is to be built in 4 phases.\n\nThe sea link will provide a huge impetus for property development in Panvel\n\nPhase 1 – Bridge spanning across Thane creek and Sewri interchange – 10.38km\n\nPhase 2 – Bridge portion across Thane creek and Shivaji Nagar interchange – 7.8km\n\nPhase 3 – Viaducts and interchanges that connect MTHL with State Highways 52 and 54 and National Highway 4B at Chirle – 6.3km\n\nPhase 4 – Intelligent Transport Systems (includes Toll and Transport Management System) and equipment installation for the project.\n\nAs of April 2022, 76% of the work has been completed.\n\nMarathon Nexzone, the finest township of Panvel is just 10 minutes away from MTHL.\n\nThis Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train corridor will create demand for housing, retail and commercial real estate in various ways. While BKC is a prominent business district in Mumbai, the biggest beneficiary of the bullet train corridor will be the micro-markets. Areas surrounding the bullet train station like Kalyan-Shil road, Thane, and Dombivli will develop at an accelerated pace, driving the surge in real estate prices.\n\nThe bullet train will also offer seamless connectivity to these areas and cut down travelling time. As the high-speed rail corridor will drive the demand for affordable housing, townships projects like Marathon Nextown & Nexeworld will be at the forefront of this demand. These townships promise affordable family homes with a host of high-quality amenities that add value to your life.\n\n5. Airoli-Katai Tunnel Road\n\nIt is a 1.7km long road connecting Airoli to the Kalyan-Shil corridor via a tunnel cutting through Parsik Hill. The 1.7km Tunnel Road is a part of the 33.8km long road, starting from Airoli to Katai Naka on the Kalyan-Shilphata road. It traverses through mangroves, valleys, flyovers, and railway lines. The six-lane road will significantly cut down the travelling time between Airoli to Shilphata.\n\nThe Airoli-Katai tunnel road will change the lives of people living in Dombivli East, Kalyan-Shil road and Navi Mumbai. It reduces the travel time by approximately 30-40%. The tunnel road provides easy access to the industrial hubs of Badlapur and Bhiwandi. It also offers fast access to Mulund and other suburbs of Mumbai.\n\nOnce this tunnel road is operational, it will pave way for the emergence of shopping malls, colleges, commercial spaces and more. This infrastructure project will enhance the economic and real estate growth of Kalyan-Shil road, Navi Mumbai, and Dombivli.\n\n6. Goregaon Mulund Link Road\n\nGoregaon-Mulund Link Road (GMLR) is a 12-km long road infrastructure project that connects Mulund to Goregaon. It will play a vital role in reducing traffic congestion and cutting down the travelling time. As of now, it takes 80 minutes to travel from Mulund to Goregaon. Once the new road of GMLR is operational, this travel time will be reduced to as quick as 20 minutes.\n\nThis road will be a massive relief for people who commute daily to western suburbs for work purposes. The estimated cost of this project is 6,225 crores. The construction of flyovers started in March 2022. The same is expected to be completed by March 2023.\n\nThe work for the tunnel road will start next year in February 2023. The completed construction work will come to fruition in December 2025. The complete operations will begin in 2026. Marathon Millennium\n\nThis project will be built in 2 phases. The first phase is a 10-km section from Princess Street Flyover at Marine lines to BKC. The work in the second phase includes the construction of the Versova-Bandra sea link. The project is scheduled to be completed by November 2023.\n\nThis costal road will also host other recreational amenities like cycle tracks, sea promenade, open theatres, playgrounds, and much more. Landscapes will be developed and Indigenous trees will be planted along the open spaces.\n\n10. Dombivli Mankoli Flyover\n\nThe Dombivli-Mankoli Bridge or Motagaon Mankoli Bridge is a crucial infrastructure project for people living in the Kalyan-Dombivli belt.\n\nCurrently, there are two routes from Dombivli to Mumbai. The first is from Dombivli-Mumbra-Thane-Mulund-NH3-Mumbai Fort. Second is the Dombivli-Kalyan-Bhiwandi-Bypass-NH3-Mumbai. Both routes are heavily congested. Travelling from Dombivli to Kalyan can take as long as 2 hours during peak traffic hours.\n\nHence, this bridge will ease the traffic issues and, most importantly, it will reduce the time of commute from Dombivli to Thane to just half an hour. It will also reduce vehicular movement on the 2 longer routes.\n\nThe six-lane bridge is being constructed on the creek between Motagaon in Dombivli and Mankoli on the Bhiwandi side. This bridge will benefit 60 lakh people who travel via this route daily. The bridge will be operational in 2023.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThese long-awaited infrastructure projects will forever change the way Mumbaikars commute. This ever-increasing smooth connectivity will also create enough traction in the real estate market.\n\nThe demand for flexible commercial offices and affordable homes in Mumbai will skyrocket in the coming years, as these infrastructure projects offer convenience. Whether you’re an end user or an investor, investing in Mumbai will be a great decision in the coming decade.\n\nMarathon Group is a 52 year old real estate builder that has completed over 80 projects in the city. The Group has a wide portfolio of projects across affordable housing, luxury housing, townships, commercial spaces and retail spaces and has a presence in Mulund, Bhandup, Panvel, Dombivli, Kalyan-Shil, Byculla and Lower Parel.\n\nTo learn more about Marathon’s projects visit marathon.in"
