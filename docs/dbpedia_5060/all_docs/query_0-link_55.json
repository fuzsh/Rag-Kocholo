The railway administration has planned to provide all essential five-star facilities to the passengers in the railway station. The face of the railway station is going to be changed for the second time in the last 20 years.\n\nThis work will be undertaken under Phase III A through the Mumbai Railway Development Board. The Railway Board has decided to develop a total of 17 railway stations on the Central and Western Railway lines. This includes Dombivli, Mulund railway stations.

Now, considering the increasing number of passengers, the railways has decided to provide modern, five-star facilities to the passengers. These stations are going to be transformed by thinking of automatic railway stations. The tender process for these works has been completed. The process of issuing work orders to contractors is underway. These works will be started after monsoon i.e. from October, the official said.\n\nAbout three lakh passengers travel from Dombivli railway station every day. The city has been urbanised.

The people of this area will have to come to Dombivli railway station as the railway station.
