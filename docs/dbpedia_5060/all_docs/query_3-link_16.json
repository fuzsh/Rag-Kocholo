        "text": "Dombivli, a central suburb of Mumbai and one of the main railway station of the Central Railway Local Train. It is very proud to share that it’s the FIRST literate city or ‘TOWN’, as most of the people of Mumbai call it, in Maharashtra and SECOND literate city or town in INDIA. All the local trains whether it is a Slow local or a Fast local or even a Semi-fast local halts at Dombivli.\n\nThis blog post is just a thought over my feelings of being a dombivlikar. Most of the residents of Dombivli feels proud to call themselves a ‘Dombivlikar’. Dombivli is a vast town and every dombivlikar has a soft corner for other dombivlikars. Dombivli is also a station where a fully packed local train gets evacuated.\n\nIn Dombivli, Phadke Road is the main road where most of the festivals are celebrated with dombivli’s crowd. Dombivli’s youth gather n meet up together at Phadke road during Friendship Day, Gudipadwa, New year, and many such social festivals. Apart from this, Dombivlikars are showcasing their talents in many career fields. Dombivli’s area around Pendharkar college in the evenings is called as the ‘chowpatty’ without a beach and sea because this area is full of stalls offering snacks & foods which are convenient to eat in the evening.\n\nCulture and many cultural activities are followed by the Dombivlikars. We dombivlikars are very helpful and intelligent but people in Mumbai think Dombivlikars carry a different ‘EGO’ with them. But people it’s not true, we welcome every migrant to our town which makes them feel like they are at home.\n\nNow moving towards the end of this post I would say every Dombivlikar is lovable and Dombivli is a Lovely town with lovely Dombivlikars. Also, I would like to apologize to all the Dombivlikars beacuse I wanted to write more about dombivli but due to lack of time and rush towards completion I couldn’t.\n\nIMAGE COURTESY- dombivlikarmagazine.com, hauntingindia.blogspot.com, youtube.com"
