        "text": "Railway Stations in Mumbai-Location, Transportation\n\nMumbai, also known as the “London of India”, is a metropolis on the west coast of India, also the largest port in the country. It is one of the most populous cities in the world.\n\nThere are five major railway stations in Mumbai, of which Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (Victoria Terminus) and Central Railway Station are the major ones.\n\nChhatrapati Shivaji Terminus\n\nStation code: CST\n\nAddress: Dr. Dadabhai Naoroji Road, Mumbai\n\nSize: 18 platforms\n\nChhatrapati Shivaji Terminus was formerly called Victoria Terminus, and has a history of more than 100 years. India’s first-ever train departed from this station in 1853.\n\nCurrently, as the headquarters of Central Railways, Chhatrapati Shivaji is one of the busiest stations in India, as well as the most beautiful. The Gothic-style station is now one of the best-known architectural landmarks in the world, and has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nThe Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus is well-maintained with modern facilities, including women-only waiting lounges, cafeterias, restaurants, ATM machines and shops.\n\nTransportation to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus\n\nMumbai Suburban Railway\n\nMumbai Suburban Railway is a public transit system. It is probably the fastest way of getting around Mumbai. It is also the most popular option for commuters in Mumbai.\n\nTwo lines of the Suburban Railway take you to Chhatrapati Shivaji: Central Line and Harbour Line. This is the quickest way to the terminus, but be prepared for the crowds and noise on board.\n\nTaxi\n\nTaxi is the most comfortable and convenient way to get anywhere in the city. There are two types of taxi in Mumbai: normal black-and-yellow taxies and pre-paid taxies. Pre-paid taxies need to be reserved in advance; you will receive the driver’s contact information before the taxi arrives.\n\nAn Indian Bus\n\nBus\n\n51, 56, 165\n\nMumbai Central Railway Station\n\nStation code: MMCT\n\nAddress: Mumbai Central, Mumbai\n\nSize: 9 platforms, 9 tracks\n\nDesigned by a British architect, Mumbai Central Railway Station is a major intercity station in Mumbai, serving both domestic and inter-city trains.
