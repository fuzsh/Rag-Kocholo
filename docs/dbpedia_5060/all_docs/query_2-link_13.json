The main office of KDMC is located in Kalyan .\n\nConfusion over inclusion into Mumbai Suburban District[]\n\nThe Konkan Division, one of the total six divisions of Maharashtra State, overlooks the entire administration of the region. Konkan Division comprises of total six districts, viz. Mumbai City, Mumbai Suburban District, Thane District,Raigad District, Ratnagiri District and Sindhudurg District.\n\nThe administrative jurisdiction of Thane District, thus, include Dombivli town, Twin city of Kalyan-Dombivli with her Municipal Corporation KDMC, Thane City, Thane Municipal Corporation TMC, other towns and cities under Thane District, Navi Mumbai with her Municipal Corporation NMMC and the planning body CIDCO.\n\nDemographics and Culture[]\n\nThe population has, over the years, been subject to dynamic influences. Though predominantly Maharashtrian, people from almost all backgrounds have made Dombivli their new home. The religious makeup is mostly Hindu, presence of Jain, Muslim, Sikh and Christian communities in significant numbers is a testimony of her cultural richness.\n\nOne of the significant cultural events of Dombivli is the Nav-varsha Swagat Shobha Yatra that started in the suburb in late 1990s. This procession is organised on the first day of the Hindu new year popularly known as 'Gudhi Padwa'. Other major cities like Thane, Nasik and Pune have started organizing similar processions.
