        "text": "An Introduction to the Indian Railways\n\nThe Indian Railways (IR) is the world's largest railway system under single management and the largest employer in the world with approx. 1.25 million employees. India's as well as Asia's first passenger train steamed off from Bori Bunder, Bombay (Mumbai) to Thane on 16 April, 1853 covering a distance of 33 km in 1 h 15 min. The train comprised of 14 carriages and was hauled by three steam locomotives. India's railway network grew rapidly to encompass a pan-Indian network of almost 40 000 km. India and Japan have signed an agreement for the construction of a Shinkansen type highspeed rail corridor between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. This is one of seven corridors currently under consideration for highspeed train service.\n\nIR carried approx. 18.4 million passengers daily (total 6.73 billion) in 2023-24, out of which ca 44 % was non-suburban passenger traffic. Passenger volumes have actually decreased over the years. IR's vast rail network (fourth largest in the world) encompasses 68 584 route kilometers (as of Mar 31 '24) of which 64 891 km is broad gauge (2021). The network covers 7 172 stations and is served by over 13 500 daily passenger (incl. 5 125 suburban EMU trains) and over 9 100 daily freight trains. Total electrified route kilometrage stood at 50 394 km in Mar '22 and approx. 95 % of the broad gauge rail network had been electrified by Mar '24. Full electrification of the whole rail network has been planned to be implemented over the next decade using renewable energy. IR's gross revenues amounted to approx. â¹ 1.9 trillion (ca USD 26 bn) in 2018-19.\n\nIR's passenger reservation system (PRS) is the largest of its kind in the world.\n\nIR's capital outlay for 2024 is approx. â¹ 2.6 trillion (ca USD 31 bn) the largest till date.\n\nIR's e-ticketing service is available eg for all Superfast, Jan Shatabdi, Rajdhani and Shatabdi, Duronto and Sampark Kranti Express trains.\n\nIR hauled a record 1 418 million tons of freight in 2021-22 with earnings of approx. â¹ 1.44 trillion. The main commodities carried by IR during 2021-22 included coal (653 million tons), raw material for steel plants incl. iron ores (197 MT), cement and clinker (139 MT) and fertilizers (50 MT).\n\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus - Mumbai\n\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT, earlier referred to as CST), previously known as Victoria Terminus (VT) is the southern terminus in Mumbai for Central Railway (CR) local trains and numerous long-distance trains incl. a Rajdhani service to Delhi. The architectural style of the station is Indo-Saracenic. Construction started in 1878 and the station was completed in 1888. F.W. Stevens was the architectural engineer and designer for the station. CSMT is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is presently undergoing restoration.\n\nA redevelopment project value at over â¹ 16 bn has been planned for the terminus.\n\nSee also: A City Icon - CSMT\n\nSelected Fast Trains/Routes Between Major Cities/Towns\n\nFrom To Train Frequency Halts Distance (km)\n\nAverage Speed km/h (incl. stops)\n\nScheduled Travel Time Howrah (Kolkata) Mumbai CST Duronto Express 4xweekly nonstop 1974\n\n75\n\n26h 25m Howrah (Kolkata) New Jalpaiguri Vande Bharat 6xweekly 2 565 75 7h 30m Mumbai Central New Delhi Rajdhani Daily 5 1388\n\n89\n\n15h 35m Mumbai CSMT Karmali (Goa) Tejas Express 3-5xweekly 6 552\n\n68\n\n8h 10m Howrah (Kolkata) New Delhi Rajdhani 6xweekly 6 1463\n\n86\n\n17h 05m Kolkata Sealdah New Delhi Duronto 4xweekly nonstop 1473\n\n87\n\n17h Kolkata Sealdah New Delhi Rajdhani Daily 6 1473\n\n84\n\n17h 35m Howrah (Kolkata) Chennai Central Coromandel Daily 12 1665\n\n63\n\n26h 30m New Delhi Agra Cantt.

As a countermeasure, AC First fares were substantially lowered. Although Indian passenger trains are relatively slow in general, a few exceptions do exist. India's fastest train at present, the Gatimaan Express, attains a maximum speed of 160 km/h between Delhi and Agra. Rajdhani trains operate up to speeds of 130 km/h on certain sections. Gatimaan Express was launched in April 2016 and completes the 195 km journey from New Delhi Nizamuddin to Agra Cantonment in two hours.\n\nHumasafar Express trains comprise of modernized full 3-tier AC sleeper coaches.\n\nA 3 300 hp WDM-3D class diesel locomotive at CSMT, Mumbai and manufactured by IR's DMW (Diesel Loco Modernisation Works) under license from ALCO, USA. IR's DLW (Diesel Locomotive Works) located in Varanasi has been producing the bulk (over 8 000 locomotives till date) of IR's diesel locomotives since 1963/64. The plant has also been producing the WAP-7 electric locomotive since 2017. DLW total production consisted of 321 locomotives in 2017-18.\n\nIndia's longest scheduled single continous train journey can be experienced on the weekly Vivek Express, connecting Kanyakumari (southern tip of India) with Dibrugarh in Assam. The route distance of 4 282 km is covered in 83 hours including 55 intermediate stops. IR operates fully airconditioned but affordable Garib Rath trains on selected routes medium/long distance routes. Fares on these trains are about 25 per cent lower than comparable AC 3-tier fares.\n\nIndian Railways operates on three gauges: broad gauge (1.676 m), meter gauge (1.000 m) and narrow gauge (0.762 m and 0.610 m). All major routes are served by broad gauge (58 175 route km at the end of 2013-14). Rolling stock incl. 5 714 diesel and 5 065 electric locomotives, over 60 000 EMU and conventional coaches and over 254 000 wagons in March 2015.\n\nTrain-18 / Vande Bharat Express\n\nTwo semi-highspeed self-hauled train types are under development, the first (Train-18) of which is in limited commercial service. The Train-18 includes 16 coaches and can reach speeds of up to 160 km/h. The Train-18 has a more contemporary appearance compared to other trains presently in service in India. The first train runs between Delhi and Varanasi as the Vande Bharat Express although it will not be able to attain speeds above 130 km/h due to track limitations. These new train sets are seen as replacements for the present Rajdhani and Shatabdi trains (a sleeper car version for the former) with a further 75 trainsets planned for induction by Aug '23. An improved variant of the Train-18 trainset is expected to be unveiled in Aug '22. The new train would be put into service after completing required trial runs and various functionality and load testing .\n\nAnother Vande Bharat Express train was commissioned on the Delhi to Katra (serving the Sri Mata Vaishno Devi shrine) route in Oct '19. The train operates 6xweekly and cover the 655 km rail distance in 8 hrs, considerably faster than the present dozen or so trains serving the route. Intermediate stops are at Ambala Cantt., Ludhiana and Jammu Tawi.\n\nThe third Vande Bharat Express train service was commissioned in Sep '22 and running from Gandhinagar to Mumbai (Central). Following closely was the launch of the fourth Vande Bharat Express train service in Oct '22 connecting Delhi with Amb Andaura (Himachal Pradesh) via Chandigarh.\n\nOperational / Upcoming VB Express Train Services:\n\nDelhi to Varanasi (launched in '19)\n\nDelhi to Katra (launched in '19)\n\nMumbai / Central to Gandhinagar (launched in Sep '22)\n\nDelhi to Amb Andaura (launched in Oct '22)\n\nBilaspur to Nagpur (launched in Dec '22) / replaced with Tejas due to poor patronage\n\nChennai to Mysuru via Bengaluru (launched in Nov '22): A distance of 504 km is scheduled to be covered in 6 h 40 m.\n\nNagpur to Bilaspur (launched in Dec '22)\n\nHowrah to New Jalpaiguri (launch on Jan 1 '23) covers a distance of 565 km in 7½ h with two halts enroute at Bolpur and Malda.\n\nVisakhapatnam to Secunderabad (Jan 15 '23) covers a distance of 700 km in 8 ½ h with four halts enroute at Rajahmundry, Vijayawada, Khamman and Warangal.\n\nMumbai CSMT to Solapur (Feb 10 '23)\n\nMumbai CSMT to Sainagar Shirdi (Feb 10 '23)\n\nBhopal / Rani Kamalapati (Habibganj) - Delhi / Hazrat Nizamuddin (Apr '23)\n\nSecunderabad to Tirupati (Apr '23)\n\nChennai Central to Coimbatore (Apr '23)\n\nDelhi Cantonment to Ajmer (Apr '23)\n\nThiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod (Apr '23)\n\nHowrah to Puri (May '23)\n\nDelhi / Anand Vihar to Dehradun (May '23)\n\nGuwahati to New Jalpaiguri (May '23)\n\nMumbai CSMT to Madgaon (Jun '23)\n\nMumbai to Goa (Jun '23)\n\nBengaluru to Hubballi (Jun '23)\n\nPatna to Ranchi (Jun '23)\n\nBhopal to Indore (Jun '23)\n\nBhopal to Jabalpur (Jun '23)\n\nBengaluru to Arsikere\n\nGorakhpur to Patna (Jul '23)\n\nJodhpur to Ahmedabad (Jul '23)\n\nPatna to Howrah (Sep '23)\n\nBhubaneswar to Rourkela (Sep '23)\n\nRanchi to Howrah (Sep '23)\n\nChennai Egmore to Tirunelveli (Sep '23)\n\nJaipur to Udaipur (Sep '23)\n\nJamnagar to Ahmedabad (Sep '23)\n\nIndore to Jaipur (Sep '23)\n\nHyderabad Kacheguda to Bengaluru Yeshwantpur (Sep '23)\n\nKasargod to Thiruvananthapuram (Sep '23)\n\nLucknow to Patna\n\nKatra to New Delhi (Dec '23)\n\nCoimbatore to Bengaluru (Dec '23)\n\nJalna to Mumbai CSMT (Dec '23)\n\nAyodhya to Delhi / Anand Vihar (Dec '23)\n\nMangaluru to Madgaon (Dec '23)\n\nAmritsar to Delhi Junction (Dec '23)\n\nTejas Express\n\nThe first Tejas Express train introduced runs from Mumbai (CSMT) to Karmali, Goa 5xweekly (3xweekly during monsoon). This new train type includes automatic doors, personal LCD screens and many other new features and a maximum speed of 160 kph on this stretch. The Chennai (Egmore) to Madurai Tejas Express covers a distance of 496 km in 6½ hrs with two halts at Tiruchirappalli Jn and Kodaikanal Rd. The 6xweekly Delhi to Lucknow Tejas Express (operated by IRCTC) service commenced in Oct '19. The train covers the 511 km distance in 6½hrs incl. halts at Ghaziabad and Kanpur. The 4xweekly Ahmedabad to Mumbai Tejas Express began services in Jan '20 covering the 491 km rail distance in 6½ hrs.\n\nOther IRCTC operated Trains\n\nThe Kashi Mahakal Express AC train, running from Indore to Varanasi, was launched in Feb '20. The train operates thrice weekly (weekly via Prayagraj and 2xweekly via Lucknow).\n\nDelhi - Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RAPIDX) / Delhi to Alwar RRTS\n\nA dedicated semi high-speed rail line (up to 180 km/h) from Delhi (Sarai Kale Khan) to Meerut via Ghaziabad is under construction at a cost of over â¹ 300 bn. The 82 km line (68 km elevated and 14 km underground) will have a total of 25 stations. The project is being implemented by NCRTC. Rolling stock, incl. 30 six-car trainsets (seating capacity: 480) and 10 three-car trainsets (for local Meerut service) are manufactured by Alstom. The first trainset was handed over in May '22 while trial runs began in Jan '23. The first section located in Ghaziabad (UP), covering a distance of 17 km from Duhai Depot to Sahibabad covering five stations, became operational in Oct '23 while the remaining sections of the line are planned to be completed by 2025.\n\nPreparatory work for the first phase (107 km route length) of the second RRTS line (Delhi to Alwar) is underway. The first phase will link Sarai Kale Khan (Delhi) to SNB (Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror urban complex) in Rajasthan. Phase 1 will include 16 stations five of which will be underground stations. The second phase will extend from SNB to Sotanala covering a distance of 33 km while the third phase would extend to Alwar. The trains will operate at a maximum speed of 160 km/h.\n\nHigh-Speed Train - Mumbai to Ahmedabad\n\nA high-speed railway corridor under construction will, once completed, connect Mumbai and Ahmedabad covering a distance of 508 km. The terminating station in Mumbai is located at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC). The northern terminus station will be Sabarmati Station in Ahmedabad. The implementation agency is NHSRCL. Stations planned for the corridor include an underground station at BKC (terminus), Thane, Virar, Boisar, Vapi, Bilimora, Surat, Bharuch, Vadodara, Anand/Nadiad, Kheda and Ahmedabad and Sabarmati. The trains to be operated on this route will be similar to the Shinkansen E5 series (\"Hayabusa\") train sets used in selected high-speed rail corridors in Japan eg. Tokyo to Shin-Aomori. 70 daily trains (35 trips in each direction from 6 AM till midnight, i.e. half hourly) are planned to run on the route and could prove to be a faster connection between the terminating cities than by air. The designed maximum and operating speeds are 350 km/h and 320 km/h respectively. The gauge used on the double track corridor will be 1 435 mm. Total expenditure for the project is estimated at â¹ 1.1 trillion and the first section of the line (Ahmedabad to Billimora) is projected to be completed in 2026.\n\nHSR Project Status (Dec '22)\n\nAccording to the Railway Board, land acquisition for the HSR project stands as follows (Jan '24): All land requirements encompassing approx. 1390 ha has been fully acquired as of Jan '24 for the 384 km section in Gujarat, the 5 km track section in Dadra and Nagar Haveli and the 155 km segment in Maharashtra.\n\nOverall physical project completion in '22 was ca 24 per cent.\n\nDedicated Freight Railway (DFC) Corridor\n\nDFCIL is implementing a dedicated freight railway network which is expected to significantly increase overall freight transport capacity and lessen the burden on existing trunk rail routes (Mumbai to Delhi and Delhi to Howrah) where passenger and freight trains share the same infrastructure. The two greenfield DFCs are expected to be fully operational by 2024. The dedicated freight corridors are divided into two main sections as follows:\n\nEastern Corridor which will cover a distance of 1 856 km and run from Dankuni (West Bengal) to Ludhiana (Punjab) - Project status (Apr '23): 1 043 km completed\n\nWestern Corridor which will cover a distance of 1 504 km running from JNPT (Maharashtra) to Ludhiana (Punjab) - Project status (Apr '23): 1 046 km completed\n\nNew or Redeveloped Railway Stations\n\nRani Kamalapati railway station (erstwhile Habibganj), located in Bhopal, was inaugurated in Nov '21.\n\nInternational Train Services\n\nIR runs the 4xweekly Maitree Express train from Kolkata to Dhaka. Kolkata (Kolkata Station) and Khulna are now connected by rail for the first time since the Barisal Express ceased operations in 1965. The weekly Bandhan Express departs from both termini every Thursday.\n\nA 16 km railway line linking Agartala with neighbouring Akhaura in Bangladesh is under construction and is planned to be operational by 2022.\n\nRailway Links\n\nThe Indian Railways Official\n\nMinistry of Railways\n\nTrains At a Glance (timetables)\n\nIndian Railways Catering And Tourism Corp.\n\nOnline rail booking facilities\n\nTrain Running Information\n\nNetwork Map of the Indian Railways\n\nAccomodation Classes\n\nMumbai Monorail\n\nMumbai Monorail extends from Chembur to Sant Gadge Maharaj Chowk (Jacob Circle) in south Mumbai, covering a distance of approx. 19½ km and 18 stations. The phase 2 segment from Wadala Depot to Jacob Circle was opened in March 2019. Mumbai Monorail is the fourth longest urban transit monorail line in the world. Although no interchange facilities exist with the suburban train network or Metro 1, some of the stations eg Bhakti Park, Jacob Circle and Chembur station are easily reached by various BEST bus routes. The Lower Parel Monorail and suburban railway stations are only 300 m apart. The rolling stock has been manufactured by Scomi Engineering of Malaysia. Each train consists of four coaches with a gross capacity of approx. 570 passengers.\n\nChurchgate Station - Mumbai\n\nChurchgate Station opened in 1867 and is located in southern Mumbai. The station is the southen terminus for Western Railway local trains. The station does not handle any long-distance trains. Despite having only four platforms/tracks, approx. 500 suburban trains depart from the station daily. The station handles daily approx. 500 000 passengers. The first train departs at 4:15 AM and the last train at 1:00 AM. WR (Western Railway) EMU rakes can consist of up to 15 coaches.\n\nMumbai Suburban Railway\n\nThe Western Line is one of the three major lines of the Mumbai Suburban Railways extending 124 km from Churchgate Station in south Mumbai up to Dahanu (north of Mumbai) served by 37 stations along the line. 1 367 daily trains serve 3.65 million daily passengers (Sep 2018 stats).\n\nCommuter Rail, Metro, Monorail, Tram and Light Rail Networks\n\nIndia has seen a considerable number of urban metro rail networks commissioned over the past few decades. The Union Budget for 2023/24 includes â¹ 195 bn earmarked for various metro rail projects. Besides cities such as Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, most of the other presently operating metro systems incl. Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Noida and Chennai have relatively low ridership. Ridership on the Hyderabad Metro has substantially improved recently with a daily ridership of approx. 400k passengers. A boost in ridership figures are expected once the metro systems are augmented in length and more public transport integration is put in place. Affordable ticket pricing and last-mile connectivity are also crucial factors in attracting more commuters and luring private motor vehicle users. While the heavier metro networks have not been very successful in India on a general note, less capital intensive modes of urban rail modes such as lightrail, tram, monorail or BRTS (bus rapid transit) are still a rarity among Indian cities. A few cities have initiated BRTS usage incl. Bhopal, Surat, Rajkot, Indore, Raipur/Naya Raipur, Ahmedabad and Hubbali-Dharwad. A single monorail line is operating in Mumbai and Kolkata is the sole city in India having a tram network albeit dated. Extensive and heavily used commuter rail (EMU/DEMU) systems operate in Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and on a smaller scale in Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru.\n\nMetro Rail Statistics for Selected Overseas Cities\n\nCity Lines System Length (km) Daily Passengers (thousands) Athens 3 92 1 350 Buenos Aires 6 61 1 230 Cairo 3 78 3 600 Changsha 6 208 640 Hamburg 4 105 665 Helsinki 2 43 215 Montreal 4 69 1 300 Moscow 19 460 5 650 New York City 27 394 4 730 Tehran 5 161 2 200 Warsaw 2 29 570\n\nMetro Rail Statistics for Selected Indian Cities\n\nCity Lines System Length (km) Daily Passengers (thousands) Ahmedabad 2 39 70 Bengaluru 2 74 700 Chennai 2 54 300 Delhi 10 351 6 400 Hyderabad 3 67 400 Kochi 1 27 100 Kolkata 4 58 600 Mumbai 3 46 400 Pune 2 24 30\n\nMumbai Metro 3 - Construction at Hutatma Chowk Station\n\nMetro Networks In Operation\n\nAgra Metro\n\nWork on the Agra Metro project commenced in Dec '20. Two lines with a total of 29 stations incl. one interchange station are planned with a route length of 29.4 km. The estimated cost of the project is â¹ 84 bn. Construction has been completed for what is called the priority section of line 1. The 4 km priority section (Taj East Gate to Mankameshwar Mandir section of Line 1 with six stations will become operational on Mar 6 '24. Line 1 or Corridor 1, once completed, will connect three popular historic sites namely the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Sikandra. Line 1 will be partially underground with 8 subterranean stations, incl. the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort stations and 7 elevated stations. Agra College will be an interchange station for both lines.\n\nUP Metro Rail Corp.: Agra Metro - Detailed Project Report (DPR)\n\nAhmedabad Metro Rail (Gujarat Metro Rail Corp.)\n\nPhase I comprising of two metro rail corridors is more or less completed as of Oct '22 - only three stations are yet to be completed, ie. Thaltej Gam, Kankaria East and Sabarmati. The network covers 32 stations with a combined route length of approx. 39 km. Four of the stations lie underground (the underground section extends 6½ km) while the rest are elevated. The eastern segment of the East-West Line was opened to commercial service in Mar '19 while the remaining portion of the corridor was commissioned in Oct '22. The line extends from Vastral Gam to Thaltej served by 17 stations incl. an interchange station (Old High Court). The route length of the East-West line is approx. 20 km. Kalupur station will have an interchange facility with the Ahmedabad Junction railway station and the upcoming Ahmedabad to Mumbai HSR line. Weekday ridership averaged at approx. 50 000 during the first year of operation.\n\nThe North-South Line was began commercial operations in Oct '22 extending from Motera at the northern end to APMC with 15 stations (incl. Sabarmati) and a total route length of approx. 19 km. The route is covered in 35 mins. The minimum fare for a distance up to is â¹ 5 and the maximum fare charged is â¹ 25.\n\nPhase II of Ahmedabad Metro was approved in Feb '19 and is planned to include a 23 km metro line extending from Motera in Ahmedabad to Gandhi Mandir located in the capital city of Gujarat, Gandhinagar. Another 5½ km line extending from the Gujarat National Law University (GNLU) to GIFT City (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City) is also planned to be included in the 2nd phase.\n\nBengaluru Metro (Namma Metro)\n\nThe first reach (eastern section of the East-West line or Purple Line) was opened in Oct '11 connecting Baiyappanahalli with M.G. Road and 31.5 km of line had been commissioned on both Green and Purple lines by May 2016. The last reach (Green Line from Majestic to Yelachenahalli with 11 stations) of the first phase of the â¹ 64 bn (original cost estimate which subsequently increased to â¹ 138 bn) Bengaluru metro system was commissioned in June 2017. The southern stretch of the Green Line extending 6.3 km from Yelachenahalli to Silk Institute under Phase 2 began operations in Jan '21 adding five stations to the line. The present network comprises of of two lines totalling ca 70 km (Purple Line 39.4 km / 35 stations of which four are underground and Green Line 30.7 km / 30 stations out of which three are underground and 27 are elevated. The Majestic (Kempegowda) is the only interchange station. 8.8 route km is underground and the remaining 48 odd km runs on elevated track. Average weekday metro ridership was approx. 600 000 in mid '23. Buses are nevertheless by far more used with around 4.5 million daily passengers commuting on Bengaluru city buses (fleet incl. ca 6 000 buses). The second phase comprises of 89 route km (incl. extensions to existing Lines 1 and 2, Line 3, Line 4 and the Outer Ring Road Metro) of which 13.8 km is underground. Over 70 new stations are planned to be added to the 40 stations included in the Phase I network.\n\nThe latest extension on the western section of the Green Line from the present terminus station at Nagasandra toward Madavara is expected to be commissioned in H3 '23. The extension will include three new stations and will cover a route distance of over 3 km.\n\nThe Purple Line extension, running from RK Puram to Whitefield and covering a distance of approx. 14 km with 12 elevated stations, is part of Phase II.

The revised cost of Line 2 is â¹ 86 bn. Line 2 will be interconnected with the existing north-south line at Esplanade metro station. The line would also facilitate a convenient link connecting Kolkata's two busy rail terminals, Howrah and Sealdah. Tunnelling work of the last remaining section between Esplanade and Sealdah was delayed as one of the two TBMs struck an aquifer in late Aug '19 which resulted in the destabilization and collapse of several buildings in the Bowbazar area of central Kolkata. Tunnelling work resumed in Feb '20 but had to be halted in Mar '20 due to the Covid-19 related lockdown. Tunnelling resumed once again in Jun '20 and the east-bound tunnel was completed in Oct '20. The remaining untunnelled west-bound section from Sealdah to Bowbazar was completed in May '21.\n\nWater seepage in May '22 and Oct '22 in the base of the shaft structure built for the extraction of the TBMs (one of which hit a aquifer in 2019) and while making preparations for the boring of a cross passage between the two tunnels in Bowbazar caused subsidence in some the area's buildings. These incidents have delayed the opening of the full line which was initially planned for early '23. The Oct '22 subsidence incident delayed the launch of the entire line which is estimated to be launched by end '24. The first rake to run below the Hooghly river took place in Apr '23. The 4.8 km Howrah Maidan to Esplanade section was inaugurated on Mar 6 '24 and commercial service began some days later.\n\nSix of the proposed 12 stations will be underground (10.8 km route km) while the other six would be elevated stations.

Trains (100 services each way) run from 8 AM till 8 PM (noon till 8 PM on Sundays) at 15 min interval on weekdays and the maximum fare is â¹ 10 (â¹ 5 for 2 km or less). The Salt Lake Stadium to Phoolbagan section was opened in Oct '20 (total route length: 7 km) and commercial service was extended to Sealdah (total route length: ca 9 km) on Jul 14 '22. The Phoolbagan station is designed to handle up to 300 k daily passengers while Howrah station and Sealdah will be able to handle up to 450 k and 500 k commuters respectively. The line caters to approx. 30 k weekday passengers as of end '22 following the opening of the Sealdah station. The remaining section of the line is estimated to become operational at earliest in 2024. A three line (including the planned construction of a third line linking Majerhat (Joka line) and Esplanade) underground interchange station at Esplanade is under construction and will feature a bus terminus and parking garage. BEML supplied a total of 14 standard gauge rakes for Line 2, each rake consisting of 6 coaches. A further three metro rakes are to be ordered and delivery within '23.\n\nOther Lines Under Construction\n\nThree other lines are under various stages of construction.

The first line (21½ km route length), featuring both elevated (14 stations) and underground stations (six stations) would run from Sarthana to Dream City (18 stations in total) while the second line (18.7 km) would extend from Bhesan to Saroli. The two lines will connect at Majura Gate interchange station.\n\nMonorail Networks\n\nMumbai Monorail\n\nChembur Station - The Mumbai Monorail line presently runs from Chembur to Jacob Circle, a distance of approx. 19½ km. The 2nd phase extension from Wadala Depot to Ghadge Maharaj Chowk (Jacob Circle) in south Mumbai opened in Mar '19. The installation of a travelator, which is expected to be completed in Q1 '24 (on hold), will provide a convenient connection between the Ghadge Maharaj Chowk monorail station and Mahalaxmi suburban rail station as well as the upcoming Mahalaxmi metro station on Line 3. Weekday ridership is fairly low at ca 12 000 in May '23 but could increase with the introduction of more train services in the future with additional trains joining the the current fleet of 7-8 trainsets.\n\nThe first phase (Wadala to Chembur with a route length of 8.8 km) section began commercial operations in 2014. A major fire incident in Nov '17 involving two coaches of a stationary train delayed the commissioning of the second phase. Service was resumed on the first phase section in Sep '18 with a limited number of trains. The phase 2 segment from Wadala Depot to Jacob Circle was opened in March 2019. Ridership has decreased to approx. 12 000 passengers in May '23 despite the opening of the second phase albeit with a low train frequency (due to a small operating train fleet comprising 7-8 trainsets). An additional of up to ten trainsets are expected to be delivered from late '23 onwards allowing for a more frequent service (presently ca 120 daily services). Mumbai Monorail is the fourth longest urban transit monorail line in the world. The southern segment of the line line passes through some densely populated parts of the city. Passenger capacity and train frequency should also increase as more train sets are inducted into the operating fleet. The present train frequency is 20-25 mins.\n\nMumbai Monorail Ride\n\nTram Networks\n\nErstwhile tram networks of India >>\n\nAlthough trams exist only in Kolkata at present quite a few Indian cities had tram service in the past.\n\nWBTC - Kolkata Trams\n\nWBTC (West Bengal Transport Corp.) operates the tram network of Kolkata. Kolkata is the only city in India still having a tram network although the network in terms of number of routes and track length has decreased significantly. Only 8 routes survive today compared to almost 40 routes in 2010. Track length is approx. 15 km and the number of tram cars plying is ca 40 compared to 180+ in 2010. The number of daily passengers has also plummeted to around 15 000. The first electric tram to run in Calcutta was in 1902, the first in Asia. Horse and steam engine hauled trams were in service by the 1880's. By 1943 the track length of the tram line network had been expanded to over 67 km but since then has gradually decreased to the present 54 km served by 18 routes. The rolling stock is of vintage type (old SLC and SLC and some new trams with a polycarbonate ceiling and larger windows, better lighting and piped radio/music). The tram ride in video provided below is in one of the newer tram cars. WBTC also runs a quite a few city/suburban bus routes in addition to ferry services. An AC tram service (refurbished single car tram) was introduced on the Esplanade-Shyambazar route in May '19.\n\nKolkata Trams\n\nCommuter Rail\n\nMumbai Railway Vikas Corp. Ltd.\n\nMumbai's local rail network, comprising of three trunk lines namely Western, Central and Harbour Lines with a total route length of 376 km, is the world's second busiest commuter rail system with an average daily ridership of around 6.2 million (2023). Ridership has decreased considerably during the last few years (7.6 m daily passengers in 2019-20). The first local train service was introduced in 1867 under the auspices of Bombay Baroda and Central Indian railway company. The line ran from Viraur to Back Bay. Central Railways (CR) carried ca 4.4 million daily commuters on 1 774 daily (1 810 as of Nov '23) train services (2019) whereas Western Railways (WR) carried approx. 2.7 million passengers daily (1 394 daily train services in 2023). WR plans to convert an additional one hundred 12-car train services to 15-car train services by end '22 (132 services are run with 15-car rakes as of Dec '22). The nominal capacity of a 15-car rake is around 6 000 compared to roughly 4 000 passengers for a 12-car rake. WR introduced 12-car and 15-car suburban rakes in 1986 and 2009 respectively.\n\nThe MUTP (Mumbai Urban Transport Project) 3A phase with an estimated expenditure of â¹ 337 bn approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in Mar '19 will include laying of 5/6th lines between Borivali and Virar stations on the Western Line for dedicated suburban train usage, extension of the Harbour Line up to Borivali and a new signalling system on all three suburban lines. Stations will also be modernised. Procurement of new AC rakes at an estimated cost of â¹ 164 bn is has also been earmarked.\n\nThe first phase of the Nerul-Uran line from Kharkopar (Ulwe) to Nerul and Belapur was inaugurated in Nov '19. The section covers a distance of 12 km and is served by 40 daily EMU services. The second phase of the 27 km Nerul-Uran line is under construction.\n\nThe first AC suburban train in India was inducted into limited service on Dec 25 '17 providing six up and down weekday services on the WR Churchgate-Borivali/Virar section. WR operates 96 weekday AC train services with a fleet of six AC trains as of Nov '23. CR operates (as of Nov '23) 66 AC train weekday and Sat services between CSMT and Kurla, Kalyan (Thane district) and Dombivli (Thane district). CR has a fleet of six AC trains (incl. one for backup) as of Jul '22.\n\nWR AC local train fares and timetable\n\nMumbai local rail map >>\n\nUrban Train Timetables (CR,WR, Harbour Line, Thane-Vashi-Panvel, Metro, Monorail)\n\nKolkata Suburban Rail Network\n\nGreater Kolkata and the surrounding region is connected by an extensive urban rail network provided by Eastern Railway (ER) and South Eastern Railway (SER). Sealdah (ER) Station is the terminus for many services operated east of the Hooghly River and reaching Bangaon close the Bangladesh border north east of the city, Krishnanagar to the north, Diamond Harbour to the south and the buffer areas of the Sundarbans terminating at Canning. A 35 km loop line (Circular Railway) encircles the central area of the city. The Howrah section (SER) operates EMU services to Haldia (port and industrial town), Digha (beach resort, Kharagpur, Jhargram and towns to the north/northwest such as Bardhaman and Bandel located on the Hoogly river.\n\nAn average 1 511 (ER 1 336 and SER 175 services) daily suburban train services catered over 3 million (ER ca 2.7 m and SER ca 0.4 m) daily passengers in 2014-15. Suburban train services recommenced in Nov '21 and are allowed to operate at 50 % of (seating) capacity. ER operates more than 920 and over 480 daily train services in the Sealdah and Howrah divisions respectively. SER operates approx. 50 daily train services in its Kharagpur division with the number of services to be increased to 104 by Nov 8 and thereafter to 147 train services (up and down).\n\nKolkata Suburban Rail Timetables (ER and SER)\n\nChennai Suburban Rail Network\n\nChennai has an extensive suburban EMU rail network extending some 300 km comprising of three lines operated by the Southern Railways zone of Indian Railways. The network carried 1.07 million daily passengers in 2016-17. The number of daily suburban train services amounted to 592 at the end of Mar '17. Dedicated suburban lines include: The South Line from Beach to Tambaram (MEMU services extend over 160 km to Villupuram Junction), the West Line from Central Station to Tiruvallur (MEMU services extend up to Jolarpet, 213 km from Chennai Central) and Central Station to Gummidipoondi (North Line) used by approx. 120 000 daily commuters.
