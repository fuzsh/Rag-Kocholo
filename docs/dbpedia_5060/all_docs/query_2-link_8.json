        "text": "The Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train Corridor\n\nOne such infrastructure development will take the Mumbai real estate market by storm – the highly anticipated Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train project. The 650-km long bullet train project is a part of a high-speed rail corridor that is supposed to run from Ahmedabad to Pune, via Mumbai. Later, the corridor will be extended to Pune, via Lonavala. The estimated cost of the complete project is INR 1.1 lakh crore.\n\nThe 508km long route traverses parts of Maharashtra, Gujarat and the union territory of Dadra Nagar Haveli. Originating from the BKC in Mumbai, the bullet train corridor will have 12 stations including BKC, Virar, Thane, Boisar, Vapi, Bilimora, Surat, Bharuch, Vadodara, Anand, Ahmedabad and Sabarmati.\n\nCurrent Status\n\nAs of March 2022, out of a total land requirement of 1396 hectares, about 1248 hectares has been acquired so far. Almost 99.4% of land acquisition has been completed in Gujarat, while only 60% land has been acquired in Maharashtra. Because of the delay in land acquisition in Maharashtra, the completion date has been pushed to October 2028.\n\nImpact of Bullet Train on Real Estate Sector\n\nThis high-speed rail network connecting two buzzing metropolitan cities will shape the demand for housing, retail and commercial real estate in myriad ways.\n\nAs the project gradually takes shape, a lot of real estate development is rapidly taking place in areas like Dombivli, Thane, and Kalyan. Since this project will give a massive boost to connectivity, the surrounding destinations will develop at an accelerated pace, driving the surge in real estate prices.\n\nLet’s further look at specifically which areas in Mumbai will be the major beneficiaries of this ambitious project.\n\nHow will the Bullet Train Transform Dombivli E?\n\nDombivli E is a curious location. It is one of the last regions in Mumbai to enjoy excellent road and railway connectivity that has vast tracts of land banks available for development. The region has witnessed massive growth along the Kalyan-Shil corridor in the last decade and the trend is set to continue with projects like the Airoli-Katai tunnel road, the Navi Mumbai metro and the bullet train.\n\nWhile BKC is a developed location and a corporate hub of Mumbai, the bullet train corridor will massively benefit the emerging real estate hubs like Dombivli and Kalyan. It will even offer seamless connectivity to these areas.\n\nConvenient Connectivity\n\nTo travel from Dombivli to BKC, it approximately takes 1.5 hours as of now. However, with the continuous frequency of bullet trains, commuters can travel from Dombivli to BKC within a short time. As a result, a Dombivlikar’s travelling time will reduce by 30-40% and guess what? It will be a much-needed uplift in convenience and comfort and commuters can take pride in travelling on one of India’s infrastructure projects daily!\n\nInfrastructure Boost\n\nThe designated Thane station on the bullet train corridor is actually located at Dombivli E and is just 1-2 kilometres away from Dombivli station. Once the station is operational, an ecosystem is bound to develop around the station – shops, retail and commercial spaces will come up to serve the needs of commuters, and road development as per the city development plan will get accelerated to provide easier connectivity to the station from surrounding areas.\n\nThere is already a vast network of roads proposed as per the Development plan and the bullet train corridor will prove to be an accelerant for the development of these roads and will provide residents of nearby locations a huge boost both in terms of connectivity and appreciation of their property.\n\nThe high-speed rail corridor will drive the demand for affordable housing in Dombivli. Today, people want more from their homes – they want experiences that improve the quality of their lives. Hence, residential projects that offer a host of amenities, lush green open spaces, modern designs, and seamless connectivity are in high demand. Dombivli E offers vast landbanks that enable developers to deliver such experiences.\n\nOne such residential project that is redefining Dombivli’s real estate market is Marathon Nexworld. A mega township project in the smart city of Dombivli offering smart 1 & 2 BHK homes in stunning skyscrapers. Luxury and affordability – Nexworld offers the best of both worlds. With family homes starting at around INR 18 lakh, Nexworld in Dombivli makes for an ideal location for your dream home in Mumbai.\n\nThe Thane station on the bullet train corridor is set to come up just minutes from Marathon Nexworld\n\nIf there’s ever a time to invest in Dombivli and neighbouring locations, it’s today! In the next 4-5 years, with the bullet train, Airoli-Katai tunnel road and metro being fully operational, the growth in property prices in Dombivli will be on an unprecedented scale.\n\nWhilst the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train is India’s dream infrastructure project of the decade, it also offers you a golden opportunity to fulfil your dream of buying a home in Mumbai.\n\nThe construction of the bullet train project is progressing with time. Are you taking the baby steps to own your dream home in one of the fastest growing residential locations in Mumbai?\n\nLearn more about Marathon’s townships in Dombivli – Marathon Nexworld and Marathon Nextown."
