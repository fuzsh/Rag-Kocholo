        "text": "Rlys grant in-principle approval to KDMC plan separating pedestrian and car movements.\n\nThe railways have approved a Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation plan to upgrade Kalyan station at the cost of Rs 400-crore.\n\nOn Thursday, the railways gave an in-principle approval to the scheme that proposes improvements in the flow of traffic at Kalyan station, among other measures.\n\nKalyan railway station is a crucial link connecting the city to India’s northeastern and southeastern states. A Class A1 Central Railways station in the Mumbai division, it has daily footfalls of over 4 lakh passengers .On an average, the station handles 786 trains daily, including local and mail express trains.\n\n“Improving the amenities is required for this station to meet the increasing load of the passengers and the volume of business conducted here,” a railway official said. As of now, the area around the station in Kalyan (West) is the most congested. Outside the station, hawkers have taken over the streets, and there is hardly any space for traffic movement.\n\nThe project aims at easing commuter and pedestrian movement by building skywalks and foot overbridges, and separating pedestrian and vehicular movement. As envisaged by the project, the movement of vehicles like cars and buses will be shifted to a 12-m high upper deck. In the middle, at skywalk level, an elevated deck will be developed for pedestrians, with facilities like booking counters. The ground level will be open for autorickshaws. The project will be implemented by the KDMC, SK Jain, divisional railway manager, CR, Mumbai division, told Mirror on Thursday, after a high-level meeting held at CSMT.\n\nRead Also:\n\nKalyan's gold man waylaid shot at\n\n“We discussed all the possibilities of easing traffic in the station area in Kalyan (West). KDMC engineers made a detailed presentation of the project, which is principally approved,” Jain said.\n\nAs part of the project, Kalyan station will get a completely elevated deck for buses, and an elevated concourse for a suburban ticket-booking office on the West side, which will connected to Kalyan station’s existing FOBs.\n\nThe top deck will have multiple access points connecting roads to Shahpur, Bhiwandi and Dombivali. It will have a unidirectional flow of traffic, with aseparate bus stand. According to this plan, apart from bus movements, car movements will also shifted to this floor, said a CR officer who also attended the meeting.\n\nWhen Mirror contacted a KDMC official, who requested anonymity, he confirmed Thursday’s meeting and said: This is an over Rs 400-crore plan proposed under the Smart City project. We gave a detailed presentation to the railway officials about this plan on Thursday. They seemed happy with the project and assured us that approvals would be granted as soon as possible. Now we have decided to go ahead.”\n\nRead Also:\n\nChairman of Dombivali college to lose his post"
