        "text": "A technical issue has disrupted the train services on the downward line between Thakurli and Kalyan. The problem was first reported at 14:28, leading to significant delays and inconvenience for commuters in the affected area. The central railway technical team has been promptly mobilized and is working diligently to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.\n\nAccording to reports, , there was a breakdown of the OHE (Overhead Electrification) on the down slow line between Thakurli and Kalyan railway stations, causing disruption on the up slow line as well. There is a heavy crowd of passengers at Thakurli railway station, and appropriate police arrangements have been made. A series of electrical sparks have also been reported with operations halted as of now.\n\nTemporary measures and alternative arrangements are being put in place to mitigate the impact on commuters. The Central Railway network, which operates over 1,800 suburban services across four corridors—Main, Harbour, Trans-Harbour, and Belapur-Uran—carries around 40 lakh commuters daily. The incident highlights the critical role of signalling systems in maintaining the efficiency and reliability of suburban train services.\n\nOpen in app"
