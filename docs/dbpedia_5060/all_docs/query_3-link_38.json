        "text": "CR also introduces 14 AC train services on Sundays and holidays on the main line as per demand by commuters\n\nWithdrawing harbour line AC services from May 14 due to poor response as compared to that on the main line, the Central Railway on Wednesday announced an increase in the number of AC services on the main line (CSMT-Kalyan/Titwala /Ambernath) in addition to running a few services on holidays and Sundays as per commuter demand. For the first time, the AC local has been extended to Titwala. mid-day had highlighted last week that the commuters on Central Railway had been complaining about lack of AC train services on Sundays and holidays.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“With the increase of 12 AC services (they replace non-AC services) on the main line (CSMT-Kalyan/Titwala /Badlapur) on weekdays, the total AC services on the main line will increase from 44 to 56. However, there will be no increase in the total number of services which will remain 1,810 on weekdays as at present. The total number of AC services running on the main line on Sundays/nominated holidays will be 14 and so the total number of services running on the main line on Sundays/nominated holidays will increase from 673 to 687,” Central Railway Chief Public Relations Officer Shivaji Sutar said.\n\nThe 16 harbour line AC services will run as regular non-AC trains with effect from May 14 and as a result of which AC services will only be on the main line. “Harbour line passengers holding season tickets for AC services can obtain a refund of difference of AC and first-class fare for balance days from UTS booking counters at suburban stations,” he added. “The total number of services on weekdays on the main line (894), harbour line (614), trans-harbour line (262) and the 4th corridor (40) will remain the same at 1,810. Overall services running on Sundays/holidays will increase from 1,460 to 1,474,” he added.\n\nThe cool trains\n\nThe details of 12 AC services on the main line are (replaced from non-AC services):\n\nDown trains\n\n>> Titwala local leaving CSMT at 6.30 am\n\n>> Dombivli local leaving CSMT at 10.22 am\n\n>> Ambernath local leaving CSMT at 1.15 pm, 5.00 pm\n\n>> Ambernath local leaving Dadar at 7.39 pm\n\n>> Thane local leaving CSMT at 10.20 pm\n\nUP trains\n\n>> CSMT local leaving Thane at 5.24 am\n\n>> CSMT local leaving Titwala at 8.33 am\n\n>> CSMT local leaving Dombivli at 11.48 am\n\n>> CSMT local leaving Ambernath at 3.12 pm, 8.50 pm\n\n>> Dadar local leaving Ambernath at 6.30 pm\n\nAdditional holiday timetable trains\n\n>> Slow local for CSMT leaving Kurla at 4.46 am, 9.56 pm\n\n>> Slow local for CSMT leaving Kalyan at 7.56 pm\n\n>> Slow local for CSMT leaving Dombivli at 4.55 pm\n\n>> Slow local for Dombivli leaving CSMT at 3.24 pm\n\n>> Fast local for Dadar leaving Kalyan at 11.22 am\n\n>> Fast local for CSMT leaving Kalyan at 6.32 am, 8.54 am\n\n>> Fast local for CSMT leaving Badlapur at 1.48 pm\n\n>> Fast local for Kalyan leaving CSMT at 5.20 am, 7.43 am, 10.04 am, 6.36 pm\n\n>> Fast local for Badlapur leaving Dadar at 12.30 pm"
