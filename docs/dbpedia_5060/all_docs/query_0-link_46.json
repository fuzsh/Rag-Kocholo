Thanks to a recent initiative by Central Railways, this could soon become a reality for the people of Mumbai.\n\nThe Central Railways has come up with an innovative plan to generate revenue, by utilising vacant land within the station premises. As part of this plan, temporary dome cinema theatres may be set up at 4 Mumbai stations: Dombivli, Khopoli, Igatpuri and Juchandra.\n\nThe Western Railways Division of Central Railways has opened bidding for the establishment and operation of prefabricated cinema domes, at designated stations, operating under a non-fare revenue (NFR) model.\n\nFurthermore, these proposed cinema domes will function as fully-equipped theatres with all posh amenities, such as food outlets, comfy seating space, air conditioning etc."
