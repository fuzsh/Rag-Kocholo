Trivia

Several collaborators of this project were not new to working with Madonna: Toru Tanaka Jr., who plays the bodyguard, also appears as Oddjob in Madonna's Die Another Day video. Funnily, he is the son of Harold Sakata, who played the original role of Oddjob in 1964's Goldfinger. Sophia Crawford, who is Madonna's stunt double in Star, was also a stand-in during the fencing scenes in Die Another Day. Michael Beattie, here in the role of the manager Glen, plays Todd in Swept Away. Madonna's costume was designed by Arianne Philips, who made the Geisha outfit for the Drowned World Tour that same year.
