        "text": "Episode 4\n\nJeremy Clarkson travels to Belfast to conduct an extremely thorough test of the Renaultsport Twingo 133 involving a tunnel, a ferry and the actor Ross Kemp. Meanwhile, Richard Hammond investigates ways to speed up your next summer holiday through the crucible of motorsport as he invents the brand new sport of airport vehicle racing. At the other end of the intellectual spectrum, James May tests the new Vauxhall Insignia VXR in the company of Margaret Calvert, the lady responsible for inspired design philosophy behind the familiar British road sign. Finally, Jeremy is on and off the track in the BMW X5M, Audi Q7 V12 and the latest version of the supercharged Range Rover."
