        "text": "Director Guy Ritchie is known for his guns blazing, male-dominated, gritty films that tend to focus on some form of mobster. Now, he's coming to Netflix with this exact formula, but shinier, with (a few) more women and in series form with The Gentlemen. Rather than two hours of fast-paced, quippy dialogue and Vinnie Jones cameos, fans can indulge in eight episodes of twists and turn and many a lovely location to swoon over.\n\nWho is in The Gentlemen?\n\nTheo James has transferred from Sicily and The White Lotus to the English countryside, portraying the main role of Edward (Eddie) Horniman, a young member of the aristocracy who becomes the Duke of Halstead, taking on his father's estate and all that comes with it – including the weed farm that sets the drug world against and within the landed gentry. Kaya Scodelario plays his counterpart; Susie Glass, a mobster's daughter (said mobster portrayed by Ray Winstone) who runs the business on the Halstead's land. Daniel Ings stars as Freddie Horniman, Eddie's older brother, while Vinnie Jones of course has to make an appearance, this time in the form of the estate manager who lives in his cottage with an array of wildlife he's rescued.\n\nWhere can I watch The Gentlemen series?\n\nThe Gentlemen will preview on Netflix on March 7.\n\nIs The Gentlemen a spin-off?\n\nThe Gentlemen has nothing to do with Guy Ritchie's film by the same name, other than bringing together the idea of the original mobsters (aristocracy) with the new breed (drug gangs). The idea centres around the two meeting, but there is no crossover and the series is not a sequel to the film.\n\nWhere was The Gentlemen filmed?\n\nThe locations for The Gentlemen make it worth watching in themselves and range from the stately hall at Badminton House and its grounds to an underground weed farm made of shipping containers, via crumbling castles, London skyscrapers and private members clubs.\n\nBadminton, the grand country seat of the Dukes of Beaufort\n\nGallery16 Photos\n\nView Gallery\n\nIs there a trailer for The Gentlemen?"
