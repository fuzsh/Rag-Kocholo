        "text": "Like many stories about the transition of power from one generation to the next, The Gentleman opens with refined aggression. This story was first a feature film, written and directed by Guy Ritchie, with costumes designed by Michael Wilkenson. Now it is also a series on Netflix, halfway between a continuation of the film and a spin-off, produced and sometimes directed by Ritchie, who wrote the series with Matthew Read. The fabulous costumes for the series were designed by Loulou Bontemps, who has worked with Ritchie on many projects. I spoke with Bontemps about the series, which I quickly learned was more similar to producing eight sequential feature films than the typical streamable series.\n\nWhen we first meet our protagonist, Eddie Horniman (Theo James), he has only just been tracked down by the long-suffering Ahmed (Ranjit Krishnamma), the Horniman family solicitor. He has been sent to retrieve him, a task likely beneath his pay grade, which Eddie recognizes with subtle distress. Before long he has lost his captain’s uniform and donned civvies that are essentially the type worn by a country gentleman. A style of dress, which in its own way, is a sort of neutral. Eddie is obviously doing his level best to be what is expected of him, and he performs his duties well. He is a second son, the spare we’ve all heard of, and this one has been forced home by filial guilt to attend the bedside of his dying father. It's sad, but it is also a familiar opening. This is not a criticism. The adherence to motif and tale-type is crucial to any storyteller who wishes to elicit the attention of an audience, and this story benefits from Ritchie’s signature (read: playful) repartee.\n\nIt would be impossible to deny the relationship between film and series, and that seemed the most natural place to start asking Bontemps about designing costumes for the show. I had to ask about how that works, as there is a unique challenge there. “I wanted to pay homage, the film was such a hit and Michael Wilkinson did such a great job,” she told me. “But after I read the first two episodes, I realized, okay, even though it's the same world and the same sort of ‘Guy Ritchie’ storyline, it is completely different. It was fun, and challenging, to recreate it in a different light with these different characters.” The most important thing, Bontemps told me, was to help create a show that people would enjoy, for the fans of the film to get more of a story that they already loved.\n\nAlmost immediately we learn why Eddie chooses to live and work so far from the part of the world he grew up in. That world centers around a country manor, Badminton House, which is a very fancy, Grade 1 Listed Building, in Badminton, Gloucestershire, England. Ian Fleming wrote (in Goldfinger) that “Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. Three times is enemy action. Three times is enemy action.” Agatha Christie’s Miss Marple noted that “any coincidence is worth noticing. One has to wonder if it is a Shakespeare homage to tell a story about a father’s complicated relationship with his children, with the plot moved steadily along by the conflict which arises from who is supposed to inherit what. Using a house in a shire named after Gloucester for the Horniman family home seems like a pattern, or like a coincidence worth noting. I did not speak with Mr. Ritchie or Mr. Read, but judging solely on the quality and caliber of Bontemps work, I would be very surprised to find out that references to King Lear were unintentional.\n\nI have argued here before that excellent costume design is a tool that even the best performer can benefit from. It has other roles, important roles, perhaps especially when the bulk of the characters we see on screen are at least tangentially dressed the same as people today. Clothing is a way we identify ourselves to others, and in return it is a way that we can decide where to file other people in our own internal classification systems. That could sound ominous, but when you consider the context, it is simply another way that costume is of use; to convey information that might not be possible or reasonable to explain.\n\nBontemps worked in tandem with Richie to flush out the characters before the actors imbibed them. “You start with a conversation,” Bontemps explained. “Who is this person? Where did they go to school? Where were they born? Where did they grow up? Where did they go on holiday? You know, who is their family? Do they care about their family? How wealthy are they? What is a luxury item to them?” All told, there were untold hours spent considering all of this long before any cameras started rolling. Bontemps likes that though, it helps her do her best work, “you really get immersed into that world of that character. And that's what he [Guy Ritchie] wants his audience to feel.”\n\nOnce ferried home, we learn quickly why exactly Eddie chooses to live so far from the family estate; his family is a lot. Nevertheless, he returns home for his father, this is the right thing to do and at this story's beginning, our hero is clinging to a semblance of routine and normalcy. He dresses as his station requires, minimal like the military man we know he is. Lord Horniman, Eddie’s father is dressed for the occasion, his own death, and it feels undeniable that the character would have picked this exact look with care for the image it would leave. Bontemps knew this, or she made it true, or some ineffable combination of those things. There is also something more mischievous afoot, an avidity that is more than we usually get from stories about crimes and the people who commit them. Lord Horniman chose a whorl of jewel toned paisley with accent lapels, a cravat. Formal to the end, that one, and is a perfect set up for the caper which is about to begin. Though his last words are far less gentlemanly, perhaps hinting at a more malleable definition of the title that the commencing action will force its viewer to accept. There is a lot of forced acceptance in this story. Freddy (Daniel Ings), the chaotic older brother to our hero Eddie, will have to accept being passed over for the title and inheritance generally relegated to the first born son. The Horniman family, with the exception of Freddy and his wife Tasmina (Chanel Cresswell), is relieved by this anomaly and the deus ex machina it represents for their collective future wellbeing.\n\nIt is significant that this show is at its heart a comedy of errors, albeit one augmented with enough traditional tragedy to account for all the bloodshed. The series is also only the second time Guy Ritchie has ventured into episodic television. (The first time was Channel 4 miniseries called Lock, Stock… which aired in 2000 and was itself a spin-off of another of Ritchie’s films, his debut feature film, the infamous and much lauded 1998 film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. His third series, The Donavan’s, an extension of the popular Showtime series Ray Donavan, will debut on Paramount + later this year.)\n\nThis show is epic, in the manner usually attributed to feature film, and the similarity to a movie extended deeply into the costume design. “Every episode was like a film because there were so many characters. It's not normal in TV to have that many story days.”\n\nThe span and breadth of stylized costume is immense, and undertaking this project was no small feat. Susie Glass (Kaya Scodelario, who has been nominated for Outstanding Performance in a Comedy Series for the inaugural Gotham TV Awards for her work) is a walking fashion plate. One with sharp edges. Whether channeling Cleopatra (that hair!) or Jackie Kennedy as played by Parker Posey (that pink suit!), there is no doubt that Susie’s wardrobe is the envy of many a modern woman. “Everybody has reached out to me about Susie's wardrobe, but they all want to know where they can go and get it,” Bontemps told me.\n\nUnfortunately, purchasing Susie’s style, “over 60 costumes in total,” is close to impossible, as Scodelario’s wardrobe was a mix of vintage, bespoke, and off the rack. “Find your style statement,” advises Bontemps, “and try and encourage people to just go out and go to thrift stores and mix it up, or go back into your own wardrobe and see what you've got buried away and just reinvent it and have fun with it.” The same advice could apply to the wardrobe of Sabrina Horniman, dowager Duchess of Halstead, played by the magnificent Joely Richardson. Getting back to my argument for costume as a tool, Sabrina’s wardrobe is a definitive example of how possible it is to communicate with an audience without uttering a word of exposition.\n\nBontemps told me that she worked closely with production designer Martyn John, and that their pas de deux is the reason for so many stunningly beautiful scenes. “I work really closely with Martyn,” Bontemps explained. “He and I like colors, we love colors and Guy and the DP [director of photography], Ed Wilde, are not scared of colors, which is wonderful for us both.” The ease of the working relationship was an asset on a set likely to be in flux on any given day, not because of any human faults, but because there are so many characters, scenes and locations to manage. “Working with him, whenever there's a change, he's like, well, I've suddenly got to paint the wall blue. What are your characters wearing? You know, little things that people don't think about. But we have such a wonderful, creative language together and rhythm together, Ed, Martin and I, that, and within our own teams as well. So whenever something wild happens, we kind of just, you know, assemble and work it out.”\n\nJolie Richardson is regal in this role, no lesser word would suffice. Daphne Guinness was part of Bontemps inspiration for the Horniman family matriarch, as is Vivienne Westwood. “These iconic women who just break all the rules and make their own style statements are just such wonderful inspirations. They kind of make you want to be brave with your own work and your own wardrobe. So yeah, she [Guinness ] was absolutely on my boards because we had this first funeral, where you see Jolie Richardson wearing this magpie on her head. And to me, that is Daphne Guinness as well.”\n\nThe male characters, of which there are many, from Dixon’s to Johnstone-with-a-T, and their costumes received equally as much attention as the ladies. Geoff (Vinnie Jones), who takes care of the Horniman’s grounds, is always impeccably dressed, as if he’s planning on fading into the background. Poor Jimmy, with his awful rainbow knit cap, is effortlessly pitiable. Those Dixons are appropriately ragged about the edges and generally look worrisome. But Bontemps impeccable skills are put to best use when dressing the gentlemen in this tale.\n\nStanley Johnston (Giancarlo Esposito) is anodyne. We know this from when we first see him. He is dressed as he believes a self-made oligarch should be. Even his vices are a little boring, if expensive. Though he has the bankroll to stir things up, ultimately he is no contender, as his wardrobe informs us from the start with its lack of originality. Bobby Glass (Ray Winston) is the complete opposite. From his luxury version of prison we see a parade of suits wherein the remarkable talents of Savile Row are on tasteful display. Bobby Glass, it seems only proper to refer to him by his whole name, is always a sartorial joy to behold.\n\nMost ungentlemanly, forgive the pun, is the chicken costume which steals focus, rightly so, in the bridge between the first and second episodes. As it is now widely known, Freddy Horniman, the brother passed over for his father’s title due to his addiction to cocaine and generally blasé attitude towards all things serious, spends almost much of his time wearing what has come to be known on social media as “C*ck Couture.” It is a chicken suit, like a mascot might wear, though a bespoke version. Three chicken suits were made, Bontemps told me, “one for the stunt and a spare one, and one for Freddie's hero.” It’s probably obvious why this particular costume has drawn so much attention, but Bontemps was quick to credit her team for the success of the costume. “What a lot of people miss is that I talk about who made it. I had this incredible maker, Blossom Sebastian is her name. I have such a wonderful team who listen to my craziness, look at all my drawings and my boards and get lost in my world with me. I had a huge team. And I'm only as good as my team, you know?”\n\nThere are ceremonies in the UK which have failed to take hold in the US, and are important to the narrative, Bontemps gracefully explained further. “In the British aristocracy, when somebody like that [an aristocrat] dies, you have all these celebrities and royalty, as well as aristocrats that come to these funerals. They look like absolutely incredible fashion events. Everyone's wearing something dramatic. So I wanted to bring that in, and I used that with Jolie. I made sure that I brought that in with some of the crowd. I mean, Freddie's funeral gear, he's wearing a proper mourning suit.” Formality, like the walls in the Horniman home, does not suffer from lack of ornament."
