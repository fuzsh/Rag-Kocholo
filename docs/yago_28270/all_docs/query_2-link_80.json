        "text": "\"I didn't create this problem. I'm trying to help you deal with it.\" Netflix has debuted the full official trailer for The Gentlemen series, a new streaming offering from filmmaker Guy Ritchie launching this March. Crime meets caviar! Meet the new class of criminals in The Gentlemen. A new British drama series inspired by the original 2019 film. Eddie Halstead inherits an estate from his father, unaware it fronts Pearson's drug empire. With no crime experience, he must take over the operation or lose the estate. Ray Winstone stars as Bobby Glass, a career criminal from the East End of London who founded an industrial cannabis empire. The cast includes Theo James as The Duke of Halstead, Eddie, who finds himself embroiled in criminality after inheriting his father's estate, and Kaya Scodelario as Susie Glass, Bobby's effortlessly stylish & steely daughter who runs the empie's day-to-day business; along with Daniel Ings, Joely Richardson, Vinnie Jones, Giancarlo Esposito, Chanel Cresswell, Michael Vu, Max Beesley, Jasmine Blackborow, Harry Goodwins, Dar Salim, Pearce Quigley, Ruby Sear, Peter Serafinowicz. Now that is an epic cast. This looks like some detestable, delectable criminal empire mayhem! \"Welcome to the jungle.\" Enjoy...\n\nHere's the main official trailer (+ more posters) for Guy Ritchie's series The Gentlemen, from YouTube:\n\nYou can also rewatch the teaser trailer for Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen series right here for the first look."
