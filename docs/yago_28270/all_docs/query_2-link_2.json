        "text": "Who had a more explosive directorial debut in the rollicking, post-Pulp Fiction ’90s than Guy Ritchie with his Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels? The stylish, gritty descent into the criminal underworld rocked both sides of the Atlantic, which then gave Ritchie the opportunity to give his style an even slicker, international sheen with Snatch.\n\nSo synonymous is Ritchie with this style and subject matter that no matter where his career takes him, whenever he returns to this topic it’s always celebrated as a back-to-basics comeback. RocknRolla, for example, helped sweep away the sour tastes of Swept Away and Revolver.\n\nAnd now The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, The Gentlemen and Wrath of Man have arrived as counterpoint to the blockbuster bombast of Aladdin and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. (Though certainly Sherlock Holmes and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. found a happy, kinetic medium between these two extremes.) The Covenant, became his highest-rated movie in 2023. —Alex Vo\n\n#1\n\nGuy Ritchie's The Covenant (2023) 83%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 89157%\n\nCritics Consensus: A satisfying, well-acted war thriller with surprising dramatic depths, Guy Ritchie's The Covenant tells a solid story with impressive restraint.\n\nSynopsis: Guy Ritchie's The Covenant follows US Army Sergeant John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Afghan interpreter Ahmed (Dar Salim). After an...

When word...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Guy Ritchie\n\n#4\n\nSnatch (2000) 74%\n\n#4\n\nAdjusted Score: 79577%\n\nCritics Consensus: Though perhaps a case of style over substance, Guy Ritchie's second crime caper is full of snappy dialogue, dark comedy, and interesting characters.\n\nSynopsis: Illegal boxing promoter Turkish (Jason Statham) convinces gangster Brick Top (Alan Ford) to offer bets on bare-knuckle boxer Mickey (Brad... [More]\n\nDirected By: Guy Ritchie\n\n#5\n\n#5\n\nAdjusted Score: 79834%\n\nCritics Consensus: Cranking up a true story of derring-do into a high-octane action flick that's heavy on spectacle if not suspense, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is another solid entry into Guy Ritchie's pantheon.\n\nSynopsis: Based upon recently declassified files of the British War Department and inspired by true events, THE MINISTRY OF UNGENTLEMANLY WARFARE... [More]\n\nDirected By: Guy Ritchie\n\n#6\n\nSherlock Holmes (2009) 70%\n\n#6\n\nAdjusted Score: 80166%\n\nCritics Consensus: Guy Ritchie's directorial style might not be quite the best fit for an update on the legendary detective, but Sherlock Holmes benefits from the elementary appeal of a strong performance by Robert Downey, Jr.\n\nSynopsis: When a string of brutal murders terrorizes London, it doesn't take long for legendary detective Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.)... [More]\n\nDirected By: Guy Ritchie\n\n#7\n\nAdjusted Score: 82362%\n\nCritics Consensus: The Man from U.N.C.L.E. tries to distract from an unremarkable story with charismatic stars and fizzy set pieces, adding up to an uneven action thriller with just enough style to overcome its lack of substance.\n\nSynopsis: At the height of the Cold War, a mysterious criminal organization plans to use nuclear weapons and technology to upset... [More]\n\nDirected By: Guy Ritchie\n\n#8\n\nWrath of Man (2021) 68%\n\n#8\n\nAdjusted Score: 81153%\n\nCritics Consensus: Wrestling just enough stakes out of its thin plot, Wrath of Man sees Guy Ritchie and Jason Statham reunite for a fun, action-packed ride.\n\nSynopsis: A mysterious and wild-eyed new cash truck security guard (Jason Statham) surprises his coworkers during a heist in which he...

As...

However, detective Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.)...

While visiting...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Guy Ritchie\n\n#13\n\n#13\n\nAdjusted Score: 46175%\n\nCritics Consensus: King Arthur: Legend of the Sword piles mounds of modern action flash on an age-old tale -- and wipes out much of what made it a classic story in the first place.\n\nSynopsis: After the murder of his father, young Arthur's power-hungry uncle Vortigern seizes control of the crown. Robbed of his birthright,...

Jake served seven years in jail... [More]\n\nDirected By: Guy Ritchie\n\n#15\n\nSwept Away (2002) 6%\n\n#15\n\nAdjusted Score: 8036%\n\nCritics Consensus: Muddled and lacking the political context of the original, Swept Away offers further proof that Madonna can't act.\n\nSynopsis: Imagine being shipwrecked on a beautiful island -- with someone you really can't stand. A young soldier (Adriano Giannini) is... [More]\n\nDirected By: Guy Ritchie"
