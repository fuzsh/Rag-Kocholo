        "text": "A new Guy Ritchie project is launching at the Cannes market with Black Bear.\n\nPlot details are being kept under wraps and casting is in process but Wife And Dog will deal with class in a similar vein to recent Netflix TV series The Gentlemen.\n\nRitchie is coming off the starry action-comedy The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare as well as The Gentlemen. Apple pic Fountain Of Youth is in production and Black Bear project In The Grey is in post.\n\nWarfare is the Jerry Bruckheimer-produced war movie starring Henry Cavill (Superman), Eiza González (Baby Driver), Alan Ritchson (Fast X, Reacher), Henry Golding (Crazy Rich Asians, The Gentlemen), Henrique Zaga (Beyond The Universe), Alex Pettyfer (Magic Mike, The Butler), Cary Elwes (Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre), Hero Fiennes Tiffin (After franchise), Babs Olusanmokun (Dune, “Star Trek: Strange New Worlds”) and Til Schweiger (Inglourious Basterds, Atomic Blonde). Black Bear was also in on that one."
