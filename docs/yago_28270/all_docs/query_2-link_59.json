        "text": "NETFLIX is already in talks with film director Guy Ritchie to deliver a second series of his gangster drama, The Gentlemen.\n\nThe crime comedy has been one of the streaming giant’s biggest hits of the year, with 44million views in four weeks.\n\nBosses hope creator Guy, 55, can reunite the cast, including lead Theo James, Kaya Scodelario, Ray Winstone, Daniel Ings and ex-footie hardman Vinnie Jones.\n\nA TV insider said: “It’s going to be quite a challenge getting the same actors back together, but Netflix chiefs are keen for a sequel.\n\n“Another hurdle will be securing Guy for the series as he already has several movie projects in the pipeline this year.\n\n\"But the success of series one has already convinced them there’s huge potential for a follow-up.”\n\nThe series is a spin-off from the 2019 film of the same name — also created by Guy — which starred Matthew McConaughey.\n\nVinnie was in Guy’s 1998 debut film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and follow-up Snatch in 2000."
