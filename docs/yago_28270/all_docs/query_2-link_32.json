        "text": "Guy Ritchie has another film in the works that doubles down on the British upper class.\n\nThe prolific director — already behind this year’s Netflix hit “The Gentlemen” and WWII action thriller “The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare” — has unveiled his 18th feature film, “Wife and Dog,” with Black Bear launching sales in Cannes.\n\nPlot details and cast are currently being kept under wraps, but Variety hears that with the film, Ritchie will return to the colorful, back-stabbing world of British aristocracy that he explored in both “The Gentlemen” Netflix series and 2019 feature. “Wife and Dog” will shoot in October, with an A-list cast reportedly in negotiations to star.\n\nRitchie wrote the screenplay and produces alongside long-time producing partner Ivan Atkinson (“The Gentlemen,” “Wrath of Man”) and Black Bear’s John Friedberg (“The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,” “Ferrari”). Executive producers include Teddy Schwarzman and Michael Heimler for Black Bear.\n\nRitchie is on a filmmaking streak at the moment, with four feature released in the last three years, including “Wrath of Man,” “Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,” “The Covenant” and “The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare.” His next project, “In the Grey,” starring Henry Cavill and Jake Gyllenhaal, is currently in post-production, while he’s recently been shooting “Fountain of Youth,” starring John Krasinski and Natalie Portman.\n\nBlack Bear is set for a splashy Cannes market, launching a number of high-profile new titles, including David Michôd’s untitled Christy Martin film, starring Sydney Sweeney as the champion boxer; Gregg Araki’s provocative thriller “I Want Your Sex,” starring Olivia Wilde; the Mahershala Ali and Tom Hardy thriller “77 Blackout” from director Cary Joji Fukunaga and producer Charles Roven; and an untitled Jason Statham and Baltasar Kormákur action thriller. Black Bear is also selling Potsy Ponciroli’s action/thriller “Motor City” starring Alan Ritchson, Shailene Woodley, Ben Foster, and Pablo Schreiber."
