The film will be screened at the Cannes Film Festival later this month.\n\nSuccess for BMW Films began in 2001 with an award-winning short film series called The Hire, starring Clive Owen and overseen by filmmaker David Fincherâ€™s production company.\n\nThe James Bond-inspired shorts produced eight entries at less than 10 minutes each that were fundamentally excuses to showcase BMWs in car chases."
