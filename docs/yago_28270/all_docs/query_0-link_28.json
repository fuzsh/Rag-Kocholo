We feel really good about where it's at.\"\n\nHercules is currently in early production, with no castings or release date announced yet.\n\nThe Russo Brothers also discussed Netflix film The Gray Man, which sees Chris Evans take on the main villain role.\n\nDiscussing the departure from Evans' Captain America role in the Marvel franchise, Anthony Russo explained: \"The Captain America character is a very controlled character, a very understated character. And Chris Evans does have a really vibrant personality in his natural life. In his real life, he's really funny and very smart.\"\n\nHe added: \"It was a character that was so polar opposite. I mean, that was really just the appeal of it. It was just figuring out something fresh and exciting for Chris to do.\n\n\"Because he's had such success, he's really in a place – he's told us – where he just wants to take risks and challenge himself. And this was certainly a swing he's never taken before.\""
