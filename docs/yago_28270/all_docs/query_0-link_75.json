        "text": "Back when I started RMS in 2001, I was on dial up 56k internet, and there was no Facebook or Youtube. Downloading or streaming a film was a whimsical dream. Any videos were passed about on CDs or on one forum I was a member, Eamonnobrien.com (which then became octane.ie, and then closed), had a “Hard Drive around Ireland”. Full of car video goodness.\n\nAnyway, I’ll cut to the chase. As there were a lot less videos back then, there was much better quality as it took decent money to get a video shot, never mind on the internet. So over the next several weeks I’ll be pumping out some of the best pre-youtube videos to enjoy in my new Before Facetube series.\n\nFirst up is easy. BMW decided to blow a fortune on internet shorts, that were then shown as trailers in front of movies, back in the early 2000s. There’s a whole series of them called “The Hire” starring Clive Owen as this mysterious driver piloting BMW M cars of the era.\n\nThis one below, Star, features Owen, an E39 BMW M5, Madonna, a sound track by Blur, and was directed by none other than Guy Ritchie. Throwback awesome. Enjoy.\n\n//www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5eoNyWUz8I"
