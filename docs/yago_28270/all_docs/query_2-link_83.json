        "text": "I'm definitely interested in this project because I love the Arthurian legends. Hunnam seems like a great choice for the role. I'm a little skeptical about them making him less virtuous though. Nice characters can be interesting like Captain America. It's important to have interesting characters, but you also have to make sure we like those characters.\n\n...It'll be interesting if by going in the opposite direction with the mythology with a different spin but end up in the same destination. Sure I'll throw money down for something like that and with it intended on being a story spanning 6 films their will be more than enough time to break the reviews down by Acts : Act 1 : Films 1 - 3 ; Act 2 : Films 4 - 6.\n\nI'm in. The series Merlin (yes, yes, awful show, I know) found/made up enough material to keep me entertained over the course of 65 episodes so I'm sure it wont be too hard to fill 6 movies. I do agree it's probably overly ambitious though.\n\nIt'll never be given 6 movies - there's just no way. At best, they'll trilogy it... assuming the first one doesn't bomb... which could happen given it's Guy Ritchie aka same guy who hasn't really had a 'hit' outside of the Sherlock's.\n\nHe's about 50/50 hit and miss: Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, and the Sherlock Holmes movies are his major successes but he got three turkeys in a row with Swept Away, Revolver and Rock'N'Rolla (which I liked, but a success it was not) between Snatch and Sherlock Holmes.\n\nI'd be interested to see this movie if only because I have an odd image in my head of Vinnie Jones as a knight - but I agree he's only just getting his big film mojo back: if Man from UNCLE is a success, he might see a revival of his reputation."
