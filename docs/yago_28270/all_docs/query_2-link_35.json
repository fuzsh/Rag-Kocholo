        "text": "Guy Ritchie‘s Netflix series The Gentlemen has released a teaser, set a premiere date — and revealed a key member of its cast.\n\nThe series based on Ritchie’s 2019 film of the same name has added Ray Winstone (The Departed, Black Widow) to its ensemble. He’ll play Bobby Glass, a career criminal from London who has built an industrial cannabis empire. The Gentlemen is set to premiere in March on the streamer.\n\nWinstone joins Theo James, Kaya Scodelario, Daniel Ings, Joely Richardson, Vinnie Jones, Giancarlo Esposito, Chanel Cresswell, Michael Vu, Max Beesley, Jasmine Blackborow, Harry Goodwins, Dar Salim, Pearce Quigley, Ruby Sear and Peter Serafinowicz in the cast. The story will follow James’ Eddie Horniman, who inherits his father’s country estate and discovers it’s part of a clandestine cannabis empire that a lot of unsavory characters would like to grab from him.\n\nRitchie is the creator, co-writer and executive producer of the series. He also directed the first two episodes. Watch a teaser for The Gentlemen below."
