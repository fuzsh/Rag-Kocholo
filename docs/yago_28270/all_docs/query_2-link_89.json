        "text": "Netflix has released the first trailer for Guy Ritchie’s upcoming Netflix crime series, The Gentlemen. The series is based on Ritchie’s entertaining 2019 film of the same name, and he created and executive-produced the series. He also directed the first two episodes and co-wrote the series with Matthew Read. If you enjoyed the movie, chances are you’ll enjoy what this series has to offer.\n\nThe show follows Eddie Horniman (Theo James), who unexpectedly inherits his father’s luxurious country estate - only to discover it’s part of a massive cannabis empire. Unfortunately for Eddie, a group of rather unsavory characters from Britain’s criminal underworld want a piece of the operation. Per the official synopsis, \"Eddie tries to play the gangsters at their own game. However, as he gets sucked into the world of criminality, he begins to find a taste for it.\"\n\nRitchie previously said in a statement: \"The world of The Gentlemen is a little bit of me. We're looking forward to bringing fans back into that world, introducing new characters and their stories, and I am excited to be doing it with this extremely talented cast.\"\n\nThe cast includes Kaya Scodelario (Crawl, The Pale Horse), Daniel Ings (I Hate Suzie), Joely Richardson (Lady Chatterley’s Lover), Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels actor Vinnie Jones, Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul), Chanel Cresswell (This is England), Michael Vu, Max Beesley (Hijack), Jasmine Blackborow (Marie Antoinette), Harry Goodwins (In His Hands: The Emergence), Dar Salim (The Covenant), Pearce Quigley (Detectorists), Ruby Sear, and Peter Serafinowicz (The Tick).\n\nWatch the trailer below, and get ready to watch The Gentlemen the series in 2024."
