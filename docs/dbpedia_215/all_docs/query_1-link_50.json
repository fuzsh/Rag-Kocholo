        "text": "The Black Crowes Happiness Bastards (Photo: Ross Halfin)\n\nIt’s been a long time coming, but on March 15, The Black Crowes — headed by brothers Rich Robinson and Chris Robinson — will release a new studio album, the blues/rock icons‘ first LP of original material in 15 years.\n\nHappiness Bastards is the name, and it was previewed on Friday with the premiere of a rollicking number called “Wanting and Waiting”:\n\nHappiness Bastards was produced by Jay Joyce and will be the Crowes’ 10th studio album overall.\n\nClick here to pre-order Happiness Bastards on CD from our Rock Cellar Store\n\nClick here to pre-order Happiness Bastards on LP from our Rock Cellar Store\n\nThe track listing:\n\nBedside Manners\n\nRats And Clowns\n\nCross Your Fingers\n\nWanting And Waiting\n\nWilted Rose ft. Lainey Wilson\n\nDirty Cold Sun\n\nBleed It Dry\n\nFlesh Wound\n\nFollow The Moon\n\nKindred Friend\n\nThis big announcement comes on the heels of some heavy touring from the Robinson brothers and their colleagues — a celebration of the band’s legacy over the years.\n\nPer a news release:\n\n2024 marks 40 years since the inception of The Black Crowes, and the Robinson Brothers are claiming this momentous year as their own. Following decades marked by sex, drugs, fights, breakups, and divorce, they are leaving their bullshit behind. Serving as a salute to their past and a celebration of the present and future, the new album includes 10 original tracks, with a very special feature from GRAMMY-nominated superstar Lainey Wilson. While they have dealt with their share of differences over the years, they are now two happy bastards, with a triumphant album to show for it.\n\nSaid Chris Robinson:\n\n“Happiness Bastards is our love letter to rock n’ roll. Rich and I are always writing and creating music; that has never stopped for us, and it is always where we find harmony together. This record represents that.”\n\nAdded Rich Robinson: “This album is a continuation of our story as a band. Our years of experience writing and making music and touring the world are represented in this record, and we were brilliantly guided by one of the best producers in the business, Jay Joyce. I am incredibly proud of what we put together.”\n\nThe Black Crowes will head out on the road in again in 2024, visiting North America, the U.K. and Europe — stay tuned for tour details and additional information.\n\nSee also:"
