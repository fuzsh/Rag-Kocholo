        "text": "WARPAINT\n\nStudio album by The Black Crowes\n\nReleased March 3, 2008\n\nRecorded July 2007 at Allaire Studios, Shokan, NY\n\nGenre Blues-Rock, Hard Rock\n\nLength 53:44\n\nLabel Silver Arrow\n\nProducer Paul Stacey\n\nWarpaint is a 2008 album by blues-rock band The Black Crowes. Released on March 3, 2008, it is their first studio album in almost seven years, their first with new members Luther Dickinson and Adam MacDougall, as well as the first to be released on their own Silver Arrow Records label. Despite its predecessor selling more copies than Warpaint, Warpaint debuted 15 spots higher in America.\n\nWriting and Production\n\nFollowing the departures of Marc Ford and Eddie Harsch in September 2006, The Black Crowes enlisted Paul Stacey and Rob Clores to handle lead guitar and keyboard duties, respectively. Adam MacDougall replaced Clores just before the Warpaint sessions began, and Paul Stacey returned to the producer’s chair with the hiring of Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars. (Aside from a couple of appearances in September, Dickinson didn’t join the band on the road until the release of Warpaint, leaving Stacey to play the remainder of their concerts in 2007.)\n\nThough the band had debuted new songs sporadically in concert since reforming in 2005, none of them were included on Warpaint, with only the intro of \"Movin’ On Down the Line\" having been performed for a live audience (as part of a jam in the middle of “Soul Singing”). It was a conscious decision to leave the road-tested songs behind; as Chris Robinson told Rolling Stone, \"I wanted to show people where we are now.\" Rich Robinson wrote the music and would send CDs to Chris, who would add the lyrics and their melodies.\n\nIn July 2007, the band gathered at Allaire Studios in the Catskill Mountains of Upstate New York to record, finding that the remote setting contributed to the relative ease of recording.\n\n“ When we got into the studio, it just flowed so easily. We were on top of this mountain, and we were all living in the same place. There were no city distractions, or people coming by. We were up there to work. A lot of that made it onto the record. Nature—and harmony. ” —Rich Robinson\n\nAccording to Chris, so as not to lose \"the dynamic of the group, the dynamic of music and the balance within that,\" the tracks with recorded live, with few overdubs. Only one take was necessary to capture \"Evergreen\", while \"Whoa Mule\" was recorded outdoors. The atmosphere and the band’s approach allowed the sessions to be completed in just three weeks.\n\nVarious band members have also spoken about the contributions of Dickinson and MacDougall. \"Sometimes when new people come in it brings so many positive changes,\" said Rich. \"Adam came in and tried out and everyone was impressed, but when we got into the studio everyone's jaws dropped.\"\n\nSven Pipien remarked, \"The beauty of Luther is more than any note he's playing is the feeling behind that note. He was saying exactly what we want to say, and the same thing goes for Adam. Eddie [Harsch] is not the easiest guy to replace but Adam is his own man AND he fills those shoes really well.\"\n\nMaxim Review Controversy\n\nA review of Warpaint published by Maxim in its March 2008 issue prompted The Black Crowes' management to issue a press release denouncing the publication, as no promotional copies of the album were distributed, meaning only the single edit of \"Goodbye Daughters of the Revolution\" could have been heard before the review was written. The story was picked up by the Associated Press, and preceded an exchange in which Maxim apologized to its readers and The Black Crowes' management slammed the magazine's editors for not apologizing to the band. Black Crowes' manager Pete Angelus then followed up with an open letter to Maxim and its editorial director, James Kaminsky.\n\nThe writer of the review, David Peisner, claimed in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that he had been assigned to write a preview of the album, and that his writing had been presented by Maxim as if it were a full review. With the magazine facing increased criticism over rating unheard albums, including one by rapper Nas, Kaminsky promised that future previews will be labeled as such.\n\nTrack Listing\n\nAll songs written by Chris Robinson and Rich Robinson, except where noted.\n\n\"Goodbye Daughters of the Revolution\" – 5:03\n\n\"Walk Believer Walk\" – 4:39\n\n\"Oh Josephine\" – 6:38\n\n\"Evergreen\" – 4:20\n\n\"Wee Who See the Deep\" – 4:50\n\n\"Locust Street\" – 4:14\n\n\"Movin' On Down the Line\" – 5:42\n\n\"Wounded Bird\" – 4:23\n\n\"God's Got It\" (Rev. Charlie Jackson) – 3:22\n\n\"There's Gold in Them Hills\" – 4:47\n\n\"Whoa Mule\" – 5:45\n\nBonus Tracks\n\n\"Here Comes Daylight\" – 3:46\n\n\"Hole in Your Soul\" (Joe South) – 3:39\n\nVinyl versions of the album include a bonus 7\" disc with \"Here Comes Daylight\" and \"Hole in Your Soul\". These tracks are bundled with the iTunes version of the album, as well, though \"Hole in Your Soul\" was only available if pre-ordered.\n\nAccording to Crowesbase.com, the band's official archives website, 4 other songs were recorded, and they were titled, \"Movin' On\" (different from \"Movin' On Down the Line\"), \"Ready For Rain\", \"Natural Born Turn It On\", and \"Share My Blanket\". No word on whether these will be included on future releases.\n\nPersonnel\n\nChris Robinson – vocals, harmonica\n\nRich Robinson – guitars\n\nLuther Dickinson – guitar\n\nSteve Gorman – drums\n\nAdam MacDougall – keyboards\n\nSven Pipien – bass guitar\n\nProduction\n\nPaul Stacey – producer, engineer, mixing\n\nJustin Kessler – Pro Tools operator, second engineer (studio)\n\nMatt Howe, Justin Lawson – Pro Tools operator, second engineer (mix)\n\nPete Angelus – manager (Angelus Entertainment)\n\nAmy Finkle – manager (Angelus Entertainment, East Coast)\n\nJoshua Marc Levy – illustrations\n\nMatthew Mendenhall – photography\n\nChris Robinson – collage\n\nTAKEN FROM WIKIPEDIA.ORG\n\nAttached Files:\n\n2488f0f9e7a0004c0e088110_L.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n69 KB\n\nViews:\n\n0\n\nSo the Black Crowes are back with their first studio album in nearly 7 years. I was really looking forward to it because I was a big fan of LIONS & Chris's last album. I have to say I was not initially that impressed with WARPAINT, but it has grown on me. Still, I think it might be the weakest album in their catalog. I do like the sound of it overall. Paul Stacey did a fine job with the production. Very organic sounding. I was just hoping for a bit more Rock N' Roll. It can't be ignored that major changes were made in the band as well. We all know the Robinsons are the leaders, and Steve Gorman the long mainstay behind the kit, but Ed Harsch leaving the band was a major loss IMO. He might be one of the best keyboard players in Rock N' Roll, and he has been on every Crowes album since SOUTHERN HARMONY. New guy Adam MacDougall sounds pretty good on the album, but Ed (much like Marc Ford who quit before the album started) is almost irreplacable IMO. Luther Dickinson is a fine slide player, but I feel like there is almost too much slide on the album. Sven Pipien is back on bass, and he sounds great. It is kind of like a new band though. I wish they toured this lineup a bit more before heading into the studio.\n\nThe first track, \"Goodbye Daughters of the Revolution\" didn't really knock me out on first listen. It's a decent track, but not the rock out punch I was hoping for. I felt kind of similarly when I heard \"Good Friday\" from THREE SNAKES for the first time. Chris throws a few of his expert innuendos in there on \"Daughters\", but I was expecting a bit more from the first single. Up in the number 2 spot is \"Walk Believer Walk\", which is among my least favorite tunes on the album. A bluesy drone, it just plods away in the same key for the most part and doesn't do to much for me. Next is \"Oh Josephine\", which is a fine acoustic-tinged ballad. Very pretty song. Reminds me a bit of \"She Talks To Angels\" for some reason, but I like \"Oh Jo\" even better. \"Evergreen\"...yeah! Some Rock N' Roll! Still a bit mid-tempo in places ala \"Daughters\", but it has some good riffs and Chris really sings really well on it. \"Wee Who See the Deep\" rocks along in a similiar vain. I like this one. \"Locust Street\" is another nice ballad with some mandolin. \"Movin' On Down the Line\" picks up the tempo, but it takes amost 2 minutes for the tune to finally to kick into gear. The lyrics are a bit generic (particularly the title), but the tune is pretty good. Chris is a fine lyricist for the most part, but I thought his words were a bit stronger on THIS MAGNIFICENT DISTANCE. He is head and shoulders above most the writers of his generation IMO. At 41, he still has a great voice too. \"Wounded Bird\" seems like it might be another cliched title, but it is probably one of my favorites here. I've heard rumours that the song mught be about Ed Harsch, so maybe the title isn't as trite as it sounds. It is also one of the heaviest rockers on the album. Great slide by Luther on this one. The cover of \"God's Got It\" doesn't do much for me. I would have hoped they would have come up with another good original after 7 years instead of this. \"There's Gold in Them Hills\" is a soulful ballad with nice tack piano from Adam. I wasn't knocked out by this one at first, but it grew on me. I kind of wish it closed the album. \"Whoa Mule\" (the closer) is kind of a chant/dirge that I'm still not really into.\n\nOverall, It's a decent album, especially if you compare it to most of the mainstream crap that is out there today, but I was hoping for a bit more. The brothers writing is good...at times great...but a lot of it pales to their classic stuff IMO. Gorman is in exceptional form on drums as usual. I was just hoping for a few more rockers like Chris had on his last record like \"40 Days\", \"Piece Of Wind\" & \"Surgical Glove\". Maybe after this \"new\" band is on the road a while, the will really gel, and the take that energy into the studio and give us some more great Rock N' Roll!\n\nSorry for the long review, but what the hell, it's the last album."
