        "text": "The Black Crowes The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion (1992)\n\nFrom the one-two, uptempo punch of openers Sting Me and its soulful cousin Remedy, through the melancholic beauty of Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye to the strut and swagger of Hotel Illness and No Speak No Slave, to a New Orleans-flavoured take on Bob Marley’s Time Will Tell, The Southern Harmony And Musical Companion was the exhilarating sound of a band hitting its stride.\n\nFunky, artlessly noisy, loose and tight in perfect measure, with stomping beats, church-y female background vocals, and dual guitars snaking around Chris’s raspy howl, it echoed everything from Exile-era Stones and Nick Drake to the Allman Brothers. More than anything else, though, it sounded like The Black Crowes.\n\nThe new album was named after a post-Civil War southern hymnal, The Southern Harmony And Musical Companion. Released on May 12, 1992, it entered the US Billboard album chart at No.1.\n\n“The record debuted at No.1 and went on to sell millions of copies, and was our real success in Europe. And I think with people who are into The Black Crowes, it’s our finest record, our classic album,” says Chris Robinson. Every week, Album of the Week Club listens to and discusses the album in question, votes on how good it is, and publishes our findings, with the aim of giving people reliable reviews and the wider rock community the chance to contribute.\n\nBackground\n\nIn the world outside, US President George Bush got ill and vomited on the Japanese Prime Minister. The Space Shuttle Discovery 15 launched. And in LA, racial tensions were heating up, stoked by the impending trial of four white policemen accused of beating African-American Rodney King. The opening lines of the new album would prove prescient: ‘If you feel like a riot, don’t you deny it.’\n\nOver the course of what Chris Robinson calls “eight hazy days”, the band recorded the entire album to 24-track tape. That’s not bad in an era when it routinely took Def Leppard three years to make a record.\n\n“We’d done the work on the front end,” bass player Johnny Colt explains. “We walked in the studio totally ready. A real rock’n’roll band who can play and who toured the way we did? If you can’t cut your record in eight days, something’s wrong with you.”\n\nColt, drummer Steve Gorman, guitarist Marc Ford and new keyboardist Eddie Hawrysch had to be on their toes. “It took all I had to concentrate on where to put my hands and just get through the songs,” Ford says.\n\nColt: “In Chris and Rich [Robinson], you had two super-good songwriters trying to figure things out. The rest of us were there to help give each song legs.”\n\nWhat they said…\n\n“Nothing wrong with mixing up a blues-based mush of Stones and Faces and Allmans and whoever, especially when you come by your influences naturally and don’t imitate any of them. So of course these youngsters are “original” enough. What they’re not is good enough. After all, the Faces and the Allmans weren’t such hot songwriters either, and their heirs don’t exactly have a Young Rod or a Gregg-and-Dickey to compensate.” (Robert Christgau)\n\n“And why are the Crowes so successful? Because they instinctively recognize a musical pose that gives them everything from a way to dress and a way to act onstage to a whole vocabulary of riffs that exactly fit their talent and experience. They are not nostalgic. They don’t revive the music of the early Seventies or reproduce it or even, really, imitate it. The Crowes simply generate it, as if there were not twenty years between them and the source of their inspiration.” (Rolling Stone)\n\n“The Black Crowes don’t have anything new to tell us, nor do they have a new way to tell it. What they do have is a frisky, straight-ahead rock & roll positivism that runs so contrary to nearly everything else in the present singer-guitars-drums category that you can’t help but like them. What’s wrong with following in the proud tradition of some of big-time rock’s cheeriest overachievers? After all, they could have wanted to be Foghat.” (Entertainment Weekly)\n\nWhat you said…\n\nMartyn Lane: This is a great album. It may not be the most original, but it has blues, it has rock, it has soul. Remedy is one of my favourite tracks of the 90s and this is my favourite album of the decade, too. The Black Crowes made three possibly four really good rock albums, but this stands head and shoulders above them all.\n\nRobin L Haddon: After the bombastic bradaggio and strut of Shake… The Black Crowes had no problem delivering their second opus. An emotional Southern soaked blues trip, beautifully produced by Drakoulias. Not as immediate as its predecessor but none the less memorable. Sting Me, Remedy, Thorn in my Pride, Bad Luck Blue Eyes… a 90s classic.\n\nPete Mineau: Redundant and pointless. Why listen to these guys when The Faces are available? I saw The Black Crowes open for Aerosmith’s Pump tour in ’90. Jealous Again, their first single release, was starting to get some radio play. The majority of the band was shirtless for some reason. I remember them prancing and frolicking around the stage. As they gambolled merrily, presenting their notion of what a “rock star” is/does, I turned to my buddy and said, “What a bunch of poser wannabes!”. He replied, “Yup!”.\n\nTwenty-eight years later, I stand by that statement, “What a bunch of poser wannabes!”. I would have to give The Southern Harmony And Musical Companion a rating of 1 out of 10. Again, what’s the point when you have The Faces doing it first and much, much better.\n\nMatthew Graham: Listened to this tonight, took me back to the first time I heard it, after the 3.01 min to the 3:30 min mark I was all in… could not believe this was music being made in the 90s. I was losing all hope in the music industry and what was happening to Rock… my faith was restored.\n\nSimon J. Adlington: Great album, a delicious southern stew of Skynyrd, Allmans, Stones, Faces, Clapton and others, but served up Robinson style. Still a favourite all these years later.\n\nMaxwell Martello: Whenever I put on any of the first three Black Crowes records I find myself wondering. As far as late 80s & early 90s retro-rock goes, I can’t seem to figure out how this band managed to outsell acts such as Cry of Love, Georgia Satellites (unjustly relegated to one hit wonders status) and Raging Slab.\n\nSure, listeners needed a break from the image obsessed hair bands of the day, but this bores the hell outta me. Kudos for the influences, much less so for the results. I’d rather stick to the originals. Stones, Skynyrd, Allman. In a desperate effort to “get” into this band, I even tracked down Marc Ford’s previous band, Burning Tree. That didn’t move me either.\n\nThe one and only Black Crowes record I consistently enjoy is… the double live album with Jimmy Page. They sure sounded great live, but needed someone else’s repertoire, theirs was never strong enough for my ears.\n\nBen L. Connor: Brilliant album! I have to say though that I prefer their debut. It’s a little better paced, whereas Southern Harmony falls off in the second half. Money Maker also has a few more uptempo songs, which gives it that extra ‘kick’ for me.\n\nJoe Cogan: One of the best albums of the 1990s, and I’m normally not a fan of “Southern Rock”. If the Stones were American, this would be their Sticky Fingers.\n\nAlex Kleinwachter: One of the best rock albums of the 90s, hands down, and the Crowes at their absolute peak, straddling the line perfectly between the pure rock’n’roll swagger of their debut and their looser, more jam-inflected later work.\n\nNick Graham: My first week as a member here and I don’t even have to listen to the album – it’s ingrained in my DNA. One of my top five records of all time. Damn near perfect in every way.\n\nMichael Davis: Bought and loved Remedy when it came out, but for some strange reason never got the album until a few years ago. Absolutely brilliant. Was lucky to see Thorn In My Pride live while they were still on their Money Maker tour. Really class album.\n\nJames Braide: Absolutely in my top ten albums, what Marc ford brought to the Crowes was something else. Love this record.\n\nDan Shipway: Great choice. This is when the Crowes were untouchable live and in the studio. The first album was brilliant, but this was on another level with the addition of Marc Ford and Eddie H on piano. The songs, Chris Robinson’s vocals and the guitars were perfection. They released Remedy ahead of the album, which was such a great single. They never hit better than this era… the tour with Thee Hypnotics the year previous, the acoustic show at Ronnie Scott’s, this whole album. I still regularly listen to this. The only other album from this period that I play as often is The Four Horsemen… and they were on the same label!\n\nShayne Ashby: Needs to be mentioned… the guitar tone on this album is killer. For me, perhaps one of the greatest guitar tones ever captured on record. That guitar intro on Sting Me just melts in your ears..\n\nJacob Tannehill: Man oh man… the last real rock’n’roll band of my era. I played the hell out of this album when it came out. When I played a lot of guitar, I learned half the album…\n\nThey borrowed heavily from their heroes, yet made it totally original…\n\nThere’s nothing like this these days… nothing.\n\nMike Rowell: The Black Crowes are criminally underrated. This album could have been an early ’70s Stone’s record. Which means it is pretty damn good.\n\nJim Linning: By going back to the future, The Black Crowes showed it was all about the songs and the riffs. For me, albums like this have stood the test of time better than a lot of the ‘grunge’ albums for that very reason. Yes it sounds like it was made in the 70s but to these ears, today, it could just as easily have been recorded yesterday. A superb album!\n\nStu Greenwood: For me they never bettered this album. The balance the riffs, the sound, everything was completely there, and it still rocked. The perfect combo of Robinson and Ford on guitars as well, this was an album when they started to forge a unique identity,\n\nDavid Alejandro Cepeda Benavides: I’ve listened to this album twice, i think it’s solid. Not a big fan of The Black Crowes but i really like Thorn In My Pride, Remedy, Hotel Illness and My Morning Song. 8/10\n\nUli Hassinger: Unfortunately the first two albums present the band at their peak. I’ve had expected much more of the Crowes after their brilliant start. To me their debut is their highlight because of its raw power. The successor is brilliant too but lacks the dirty rock attitude. Remedy stands out. Their is not one bad tune on the album, but more killer songs are missing. 8/10\n\nChris Weir: Best thing they ever did by far, after this it was a pretty uneven career, musically: some good records and a bunch of not so good records. Great band, though.\n\nAndrew Bramah: Brilliant album, but one of the most disappointing live bands I’ve seen. On both occasions they were sloppy and either wasted or drunk or both.\n\nCarl Black: I think this is a soul/blues/rock album. I love rock, no problem there. I love blues, but Son House blues and Robert Johnson blues. I don’t like soul music. This presents a problem. When they rocked out on this album, it was OK. When they played the blues, I thought they could have done it better. When they played soul music, I wanted to switch it off. I will never play this album again, but I’d dance with my wife at a wedding, with a few wines inside me, without a second hesitation. I’m off to listen to AC/DC and Canned Heat. Best of both worlds.\n\nGlenn McDonald: A stonewall classic, from possibly the last truly great classic rock band. A band out of time and out of touch with what was going on around them, and happy to plough their own furrow on the less obvious hinterlands of the musical landscape. Huge nonetheless, largely due to the big hit singles and that cover version, lifted from the more direct and derivative (though still great) debut album.\n\nJust like The Band in the 60s with the release of their self-titled second album (right down to the brown artwork and earthy photo) The Black Crowes eschewed musical trend for truth, drawing inspiration instead from the roots of rock’n’roll and American frontier mythology. In that sense the band’s lineage had little to do with what directly preceded them – 80s hair rock – or what was occurring around them – grunge. From this, their second album and onward, the Crowes sounded like an authentic southern-tinged 70s rock band from that era, like they’d always been there.\n\nFew albums open with the double barrel fire and chutzpah of Sting Me and Remedy. And to follow those up with the greatest three card trick in the band’s recorded history. Emotional, truthful, raw. A truly special twenty minutes of music across tracks 3-5. I don’t agree that the album runs out of legs on side two. I would say like all great albums side two just offers something a bit different, from straight up road rock to thunderous gospel. And I love how it finishes with a woozy Time Will Tell, which in the manner it’s performed and captured reminds me of the Zep “on the lawn” sessions from Physical Graffiti.\n\nA great record from a band that made a number of them in my opinion. It captures the Crowes at a perfect point between innocence and experience, when the world was at their feet. I think this band’s catalogue is well overdue a critical reassessment, it’s pretty stellar across many records and goes far beyond the well trodden debut record.\n\nThe Black Crowes Before the Frost/Until the Freeze (2009)\n\nFrom popmatters.com\n\nTwo decades after the Black Crowes debuted with Shake Your Money Maker in 1989, the band is hitting a new stride with Before the Frost…Until the Freeze, a double-album of new songs recorded live last spring for an audience gathered at Levon Helm’s barn in Woodstock, New York, home to his Midnight Ramble shows. Given that this new project comes hot on the heels of last year’s return to form, Warpaint, and its subsequent tour — from which a live CD/DVD was released in April — Before the Frost… is an experiment audacious in both concept and prolificacy. What’s more remarkable is that the heated pace has allowed for such a strong set of songs, especially as vibe and groove have largely supplanted hooks and melodies on every Black Crowes album of the last several years.\n\nThe idea to release a set of new originals as a live recording is a logical move for a band that has earned its stripes as one of America’s hardest-touring and most consistently-fine live acts. Life on the road in the ’90s gave the Robinsons & Co. a loose, shambolic swagger, moving their Stones and Faces classic-rock boogie closer to the freewheeling jamness of the Allmans. Considered kindred spirits to the jam-band scene, the Crowes got increasingly hirsute, flaunted their devotion to smoking copious amounts of weed, and stretched out songs into an eclectic roots-psychedelia, a sound that didn’t translate especially well to studio recordings; as a result, albums like 1996’s Three Snakes and One Charm and 2001’s Lions were full of tough playing and singing but lacked memorable songs like “Jealous Again”, “Remedy”, and the other hits from their first two albums.\n\nStill, the Black Crowess never perfectly fit the jam scene. First, they pulled back from the all-out wankery of the endless, 256-bar electric mandolin solos of, say, the String Cheese Incident. Plus, they had something that Phish, Widespread Panic, and the like didn’t: an excellent singer — Chris Robinson has held up to be a force of range, taste, control, and power, and he’s never sounded better than he does on the new album. Moreover, Chris and his brother, lead guitarist Rich, have written their strongest set of songs in years, perhaps ever, and their sharp, effulgent performance of them, after what was apparently a brief rehearsal period, is an impressive feat. The recording, produced by frequent collaborator Paul Stacey, wisely keeps the audience out of the mix — applause is heard just barely between tunes — so that the record achieves the clean lines of a studio album while maintaining the loose spontaneity of a live show.\n\nBefore the Frost… opens with the ripsnorting “Good Morning Captain” (a title nicked from either “Muleskinner Blues” or Captain Kangaroo), with its barrelhouse piano, ringing slide guitar, and rustic lyrics. It’s an instant classic with the grit and flash at the heart of the Black Crowes’ best moments, and there’s plenty of the Band (think Cahoots) in the barn-dance ruckus of this one, setting a formidable bar for the rest of the album to clear. But the band is deep in the pocket throughout, striking a deft balance of greasy roots-rock stank and catchy melodies, and the band sounds more engaged with each other than ever, if not having jazz-like conversations, then at least locked into the fluid exchanges and collective arrangements of the songs.\n\nRich Robinson puts on a roots-guitar clinic, particularly on the first record, setting off sparks during gritty ramblers like “Been a Long Time”, as he’s turned loose on an extended solo of snarling runs and switchbacks, or on the mesmeric blues lines in the mid-tempo gem “Appaloosa”. A major hand, as well, for recent addition Luther Dickinson, of the North Mississippi All-Stars, and his immediately obvious contributions to rounding out the Crowes’ guitar attack, playing blue-streak slide leads and swampy thwacks that counter Rich’s riffs and Adam MacDougall’s first-rate piano phrases. And, perhaps the biggest key to this set’s success, Chris Robinson turns in the performance of his career. Like other legendary hard-blooze singers — Steven Tyler and Robert Plant, for instance — whose tradition he extends, Robinson has terrific rhythm, and he sings these new songs with flash and fire and all kinds of southern-fried shimmy. On “Kept My Soul”, he hits big notes but lets his growl mingle with a ragged vibrato, while at other times, as on the gorgeous “Houston Don’t Dream About Me”, he recognizes the importance of sticking to an indelible melody — eschewing his usual onstage habit of improvising melody lines — and achieves his most soulful moments of the record.\n\nRich takes a turn on vocals just once, on the acoustic “What is Home?” a song that wouldn’t sound out of place on the second side of Led Zeppelin III. But, overall, the 11-song first record hits hard: the give-and-go rhythmic dervishes of “Make Glad”, full of Brothers Johnson funk and Stax punch; the ’60s-rock boogie-bop of the celebratory “And the Band Played On”; the nifty disco-rock trick of “I Ain’t Hiding”, all flangy guitar burple and bitchy vocal charge. Before the Frost… ends with a lovely acoustic mountain-gospel number, “Last Place That Love Lives”, which starts with the brothers only, pushing Chris’s voice way up front, and ends with a Last Waltz-style fiddle-and-mandolin coda, pointing the way to the second record.\n\nThe Crowes could have stopped there, and, as with any two-album simultaneous release — from Springsteen’s Human Touch/Lucky Town combo to Guns N’ Roses’ Use Your Illusion I and II — it’s tempting to pick the best of each record for a boiled-down single LP. That would be a chore here since there’s no weak song on either album, and although the second record, the nine-song …Until the Freeze, is a countrier, steel-guitar-laced affair, every song feels like an important contribution the album’s overall cohesive structure, a point reinforced by the vinyl release, which shuffles both records together into an altogether different tracklist.\n\nIn any case, …Until the Freeze contains some of collection’s most indispensible cuts, including the pastoral lilt of “Greenhorn”, seven minutes of wistful beauty, and “Lady of Avenue A”, a stellar lovesick ballad about good times and lost nights on the Lower East Side. It’s interesting to see the Crowes get so country, moving farther down the roots road than they’ve ever gone and bringing along Dylan sideman Larry Campbell to supply pedal steel, fiddle, and banjo. Check out “Roll Old Jeremiah”, part Dead, part Buckaroos, or better yet, “Garden Gate”, an olde-tyme clogger with Campbell’s fiddle dueling with Rich’s electric flatpicking. The album’s sole cover is here, too, a take on Stephen Stills’ “So Many Times”, a deep cut from the second Manassas album — it’s a great Gram Parsons-y find that showcases the album’s tightest vocal harmonies, another aspect boosted by the involvement of Dickinson.\n\nThe turn to all-out country may be a side effect of this project’s idyllic setting, but it feels like a natural progression for a band that pushed an organic sound even during the hair-metal years and is following the pattern of the similar twangy turns during the middle periods of the Robinsons’ heroes like the Stones and the Byrds. As steeped in traditions as the Crowes have always been, drawing heavily from the heydays of classic rock and Americana history, the band has, after 20 years of sweaty integrity, added to the lexicon rather than simply borrowed from it. Indeed, no other band combines these traditions in 2009 as effectively and authentically as the Black Crowes, a reverent musical blend that, according to their host, Levon Helm himself, when describing it to Martin Scorsese in The Last Waltz, brings country music down to the cotton belt where it mixes with rhythm and dances: “Then you got a combination of all those kinds of music — country, bluegrass, blues music, show music.” What’s it called? “Rock ‘n’ roll.”\n\nThe Black Crowes The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion (1992)\n\nFrom rollingstone.com\n\nI’m seeing things for the first time,” Chris Robinson sang on Shake Your Money Maker, the Black Crowes’ debut album. That was in 1990, when Robinson and his guitarist brother, Rich, were rounding twenty and still unknown, gawky string beans out of Atlanta. Since then, Money Maker has sold more than 5 million copies, and the Crowes have played 350 shows in nineteen months. After the triple intoxications of sudden fame, sudden wealth and life on the road, the Robinsons are no longer seeing anything for the first time. Instead, on their second album, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, they seem to be waking up with headaches. Their rooms on the road “smell like hotel illness.” “Sleeping eyes” are crying, and the boys can’t seem to throw back the sheets by themselves. “You see I’m young,” Chris sings, “and don’t like getting older.” Evidently, that’s the worst thing they’ve experienced.\n\nStill, the Crowes are a Southern band that plays rock, so there is a buried blues base to their music. Both album titles — as well as song titles like “Black Moon Creeping,” “Sting Me” and “No Speak No Slave” — bow in the direction of their musical roots. But the Crowes didn’t learn to play at the feet of Howlin’ Wolf; they learned by listening to records by Humble Pie, the Faces, midperiod Stones, Mott the Hoople and the rest of the second-wave British Invasion from twenty years ago. Those bands were consummate posers, and part of their pose reflected Southern blues. The Crowes are a reflection of that reflection. There’s nothing on either Money Maker or Southern Harmony to suggest that the problems the Crowes sing about are anything worse than what those British bands experienced: a hangover, road weariness, the occasional sexual rejection or — horrors! — all three in one day. The Crowes’ songs are a pose, just as singing about thirty days in the hole was a pose for Humble Pie. But it is a testament to the skill, intelligence and force behind the Crowes’ music to say that their posing doesn’t matter — or really, their posing is what matters most of all.\n\nEverything on The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion works, including the oblique title, which Chris Robinson took from a hymnal. The rhythm section is propelled by Steve Gorman’s take-charge yet musical drumming. Johnny Colt remains on bass, but since Money Maker, Marc Ford has replaced rhythm guitarist Jeff Cease in the band and Ed Harsh has replaced Chuck Leavell in the studio on keyboards. These changes have only improved the rich tapestry of sound that backs Chris Robinson’s singing and his brother’s flamethrower lead guitar. George Drakoulia’s production is sharp enough to give every instrument its proper voice, yet the sound has the welcome looseness and texture of a concert recording.\n\nAll in all, this is no departure from Money Maker but an expansion and elaboration. There are nine new songs written by the Robinson brothers, filled with arresting chord changes, dynamic tempo shifts, snatches of feedback and other throwaway delights and just enough good lyrics to keep your ear tuned in. The best new song is “Hotel Illness,” which establishes a strong pulse from the first chords, catches fire with the opening lyric — “Oh, good heavens, baby, where is my medicine?/Well, I must have left it outside with my etiquette” — and then proceeds to blast away everything in its path. Just as the Crowes covered Otis Redding’s “Hard to Handle” on Money Maker, they cover Bob Marley’s “Time Will Tell” on this album, although cover is hardly the word. They turn the song completely to their own purposes, making it seem less derived from reggae than from a New Orleans street procession. The last song on the album, it is an effective if peculiar summation.\n\nThere is every reason to think that Southern Harmony will be just as popular as Money Maker. And why are the Crowes so successful? Because they instinctively recognize a musical pose that gives them everything from a way to dress and a way to act onstage to a whole vocabulary of riffs that exactly fit their talent and experience. They are not nostalgic. They don’t revive the music of the early Seventies or reproduce it or even, really, imitate it. The Crowes simply generate it, as if there were not twenty years between them and the source of their inspiration.\n\nAnd, lucky for the Crowes, it turns out that there were a lot of things that Humble Pie didn’t need to sing about that the Crowes don’t have to either and that a lot of people are evidently glad not to hear about once in a while. “Hotel Illness,” for instance, is not about AIDS. Twenty years ago neither sex nor sexual tastes were politicized, and race relations had not descended to ugliness all around. The Crowes don’t have anything to say about any of that — and it’s a great relief. The essence of the Black Crowes’ appeal is that they appear to live in a world a lot of other people wish they could live in, too — a world in which the worst problems are getting up and getting older.\n\nThe Black Crowes’ Debut Album ‘Shake Your Money Maker’ Turns 30 | Anniversary Retrospective (1990)\n\nFrom albumism.com\n\nChances are if you grew up in the 1970s with an older sibling (or an uncle ten years your senior, as in my case) with a small but quality-based record collection, that by 1990, you may not have even needed to hear Shake Your Money Maker. Having already been schooled in the meat-and-potatoes rock of Faces’ A Nod Is As Good As A Wink…To A Blind Horse (1971), Humble Pie’s Smokin’ (1972) or Performance: Rockin’ The Fillmore (1971), Free’s Fire and Water (1970) or the Rolling Stones quad-attack from Beggars Banquet (1968) through Exile on Main Street (1972), you may have felt that you’d heard it all before. (All of these albums, incidentally, were released in that magical five-year span of 1968 through 1972.)\n\nIf you hadn’t heard those records however, the debut album by The Black Crowes would probably have sounded like it came out of nowhere.\n\nWait. If you’re reading this, I would assume that you’re obviously a fan of Shake Your Money Maker, and that’s great. But if you haven’t heard all—or, shudder the thought, any—of the albums mentioned above yet, stop reading this right now and go find them. It’s 2020 and they’re all available for you to hear—I just checked. Those albums are all required listening to have any sort of context about the Black Crowes’ first album and its place in the rock & roll pantheon, or any of their subsequent albums actually, or rock & roll in general for that matter. Hell, even if you have heard them all, put them on again anyway, just because.\n\nOkay, where was I?\n\nBy 1987, to quote Frank Zappa, “rock [had] gotten entirely too preposterous.” The hair was big and the music was shallow. We didn’t call it “hair metal” back then, by the way. That’s a label that was affixed after the fact. It was just “pop-metal,” “bubblegum metal,” or, in some circles, “glam metal.” Either way, it just wasn’t the soul-blues-drenched-rock I was raised on. I had friends who were into it big time, though, so I tolerated what I could.\n\nWhat stood out, however, was Guns n’ Roses, who’d put out Appetite For Destruction that summer. It was unlike anything else at the time; it was more Aerosmith than that year’s Permanent Vacation…by Aerosmith. You could practically smell the danger and attitude coming off AFD‘s cover and inner-sleeve.\n\nThe times were changing. Immediately following the success of Appetite, groups that had spent the last few years glammed-up and decked out in makeup and pastels, suddenly looked gritty, grimy, and encased in denim and leather. Groups that fit that sleaze-rock template were being sought after and signed. In Atlanta, some other guys around my age were noticing the turning tide as well.\n\nAtlanta had spawned one of my all-time favorite bands, The Georgia Satellites, and they’d just recently hit it big with their self-titled debut, fueled by the number two classic, “Keep Your Hands to Yourself” (blocked from the top spot, tellingly at the time, by Bon Jovi’s pandering and overblown “Livin’ On A Prayer”). They were a bright spot in an otherwise dim landscape for a teenager searching for that elusive Stonesy-Faces swagger. Sadly, the Sats would only last for three albums and self-destruct by the end of the decade, but it’s as if a ratty new bunch led by a pair of temperamental brothers heard the call and picked up the torch.\n\nOriginally christened Mr. Crowe’s Garden, the band had made a name for itself touring up and back down the east coast and through the southeast in the late ’80s. Drummer and Kentuckian Steve Gorman joined Chris Robinson and his brother, guitarist Rich Robinson, after splitting from Mary My Hope (which also included future Crowes bassist Sven Pipien) to join a band he felt had more drive. (Ironically, Mary My Hope broke first regionally, but ultimately fizzled nationally, possibly sounding more like ’90s-era alternative rock than the world was ready for in 1989.)\n\nDrive they had in spades. Direction and discipline? Not so much. Enter A&R mastermind George Drakoulias, a former college buddy of Rick Rubin, who was about to help the now legendary producer launch his new rock imprint, Def American Records, and he wanted Mr. Crowe’s Garden on board. But first, he needed to whip them into shape.\n\nLike many college-aged kids in the south at the time, the Robinsons and Gorman were big fans of the left of the dial: R.E.M., The Replacements and their ilk with a dash of punk and folk. According to Gorman’s memoir Hard to Handle: The Life and Death of The Black Crowes (written with Steven Hyden), Drakoulias heard potential and he guided them to embrace their inner rock stars. He took them to the woodshed armed with Stones records to listen to with fresh ears, introduced Rich to the mighty open G tuning, ultimately convinced them to change their name to The Black Crowes, and the rest is rock & roll history.\n\nWhat sets Shake Your Money Maker apart from everything else on rock radio around its release in early 1990 is, quite frankly, its swagger. The open G tuning and rock-steady rhythm from Rich, the just-behind-the-beat groove from Gorman, the slinky low-end thump of Johnny Colt, and the Ron Wood-like crunchy attack of Jeff Cease. Soaring over it all was the once-in-a-generation wail of Chris Robinson.\n\nEqual parts Rod Stewart and Steve Marriott in the pipes with moves like Jagger with a bit of Axl Rose’s unpredictability, the older Robinson embodied everything a rock & roll frontman should be—including the massive ego. Another thing that set the Crowes apart from others in the pack was Chris Robinson’s lyrics. They went beyond the surface of the cliched emotions of the typical rock music of the time and dug deep to where you felt the pain in his words.\n\nYou know the songs: the ominous slow slide riff that glides us into an avalanche of pure rock and roll on “Twice As Hard.” The “Tumbling Dice” groove-and-weave of the mighty “Jealous Again.” The Humble Pie-meets-Faces at their melancholy best on “Sister Luck.” The sly attack of “Could I’ve Been So Blind.” The slow, southern soul grind straight from Memphis and Muscle Shoals of “Seeing Things.” The Otis Redding cover with the Aerosmith attack on “Hard To Handle.” The whiplash tempo of “Thick’N’Thin.” The Nick Drake-inspired jaw-dropping beauty of the now-classic “She Talks To Angels.” The appropriately-named “Struttin’ Blues” and the frenetic, anthemic, perfect-way-to-close-a-rock-and-roll-album “Stare It Cold.”\n\nThe engineer on those songs? Brendan “Bud” O’Brien, who had played bass for a spell in the Georgia Satellites and would later become a highly sought after producer due to his work on Money Maker, working with everyone from Pearl Jam and ex-Satellite Dan Baird to Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nThe Black Crowes gave us one hell of a set of songs right out of the gate. The band would eventually grow musically by leaps and bounds throughout their career, moving from “The Rolling Clones” to a genuine melting pot of roots rock and true Americana, influenced by the Stones, Faces, Free, and Humble Pie, yes, but also The Band, Allman Brothers, Little Feat, and many others.\n\nShake Your Money Maker isn’t even their best album, nor was this the Crowes’ best lineup. Both were to come next with The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion (1992) with the addition of Marc Ford (who replaced Jeff Cease) and keyboardist Eddie Harsch (the keys on Money Maker were handled by another Georgia boy, the legendary Chuck Leavell).\n\nIn fact, I don’t think Money Maker is even in their top five when it’s all said and done. What it is, though, is the sound of a young, hungry, and passionate band that waved the flag of real rock & roll by making an album that kicked rock radio and MTV in their collective asses and exposed them to true authenticity…at least for a little while.\n\nThe Black Crowes interview in Riff Raff August 1991\n\nFrom the-revenge-of-riff-raff.blogspot.co.uk\n\nThe Black Crowes, those soulful, uncompromising rootsy rockers, recently paid a flying visit to our capital city on the back of a highly successful, yet tempestuous, sixteen-month solid stint of touring. The Crowes are arguably America’s hottest young band. 1991 sees them opening this year’s ‘Monsters of Rock’ festivities at Donington Park. We reluctantly bought Marc ‘Dickus Dogus’ Liddell a one-way tube ticket to Kensington and despatched him in extreme haste to meet the man of the moment…Chris (Emo) Robinson.\n\nSlumped in the back of the lounge of the Chelsea Hotel in Knightsbridge, is a tall, unfeasibly thin American rock singer. one part of a band whose debut record is now touching the three million sales mark in the US.\n\nYup, I’m referring to Atlanta’s Black Crowes, whose rootsy, hard-edged rhythm n’ blues has captured the imagination and struck a nerve with the American public. And at a time when most rock bands’ share of the ‘great American dream’ has been cut down to ever-decreasing proportions. Why? Probably on account of the recession on both sides of the Atlantic, too much competition, and a record-buying public gorged and satiated by MTV overexposure.\n\nFor almost a year now, this young five-piece from the Deep South have been touring the States supporting their Shake Your Money Maker record, playing to ever increasing audiences, and now they look set to become one of the biggest rock n’ roll acts in our ever-shrinking, chaotic globe. More importantly, they’re a healthy anecdote to the soulless music-by-numbers crud that regularly spews out of the States (or anywhere else for that matter). Cynical? Nope. Just honest.\n\nHmm… ‘honesty,’ that, according to Chris Robinson, is one of the key words for him and his band. It’s also one of the reasons why so much ‘controversy’ has gone hand-in-hand with The Black Crowes startling success. Ah, every silver lining has a cloud!\n\nWhy so? Well as most of you are probably aware, The Black Crowes were recently booted off the ZZ Top tour. Yup, those fellow Southern ‘over the dusty hill’ boogie merchants. To be brief, ZZ Top’s management insisted they leave the tour because the band upset Miller Lite, the tour’s sponsors with onstage comments about The Black Crowes’ music being “a commercial free zone.” The band countered by accusing ZZ TOP of lip-synching onstage.\n\nI make myself comfortable in the vacant chair next to Chris.\n\nMr. Robinson is, er, resplendent in colorful patchwork jeans and three-day stubble. He recalls our last chat, exactly a year ago in the same hotel. My! Things have certainly changed since then.\n\nWell, Chris, do you regret any of this, y’know, the slagging match between your respective camps?\n\n“I don’t know if it’s a slagging off…” [long pause] “It may sound like slagging. I’ve said some things about ZZ Top and they’ve said shit about us. I mean, do you honestly think that, when I go to bed at night, I think about it?” he says indignantly.\n\n“A lot of times, because I am the musician and person in question, I question things like anyone else, whether it be morals, religion, whatever. But by me questioning it, it comes off as a statement.”\n\nAs you’re in the public eye, the media always seem to look to get ‘good copy’ and blow things out of proportion.\n\n“Yeah, like anything else it depends on what kind of aspect of the story you want to go with. Let’s face it. That’s a very easy gut thing. What kind of story do you have to write? What do you have to think to yourself? Do you have to make a stand? No!”\n\n“Then again,” ponders Chris, “you and I would probably disagree on something, but that doesn’t mean we wouldn’t get along.”\n\nHe suddenly arches up onto the edge of his seat and exclaims: “It’s music, man! It’s profound. It’s ageless. People have been trying to figure it out for centuries.”\n\nTrue. When all is said and done, it’s just an instinctive thing.\n\n“Totally,” agrees Chris. “That’s the way we live and I can’t separate it from the music. Then again, I’m not a diplomat. You ask my opinion and I give it to you because telling the truth is supposed to be a virtue…and it’s a very rare virtue these days.”\n\n“So many people say things,” he explains, “watching what they say because they don’t want to ruffle any feathers, y’know, they might not get paid as much. I couldn’t give a flying fuck about getting paid!”\n\nIt’s odd, isn’t it, that some people in the business can’t handle honesty, the truth. After all musicians, performers…creative people are a little different from the norm. Off centre. Do you always expect artists to come out with polite, harmless comments? There’s got to be an angle, an edge to what you say. Chris agrees.\n\n“Yeah, definitely. It’s an angle and it’s cool. For the first time in a long time, a band’s come along to make people start to think, like, ‘Wait a minute. What did he say?'”\n\nThought provoking at least. They don’t necessarily have to agree with you.\n\n“Yeah, it’s not about sensationalism,” he explains. “I don’t have an over exaggerated ego thing, where I thing our music is so important and everyone else is horrible. I don’t think that. I have thousands of pieces of recorded music. It’s not that cut n’ dry.”\n\nChris becomes increasingly more animated and intense. It’s obvious that he’s at pains to clarify his position.\n\n“If anything, all we’ve said is: if we’re gonna be part of the music business, y’all better fuckin’ know that we’re not gonna be motivated by greed.”\n\nOf course, there’s also the inherent contradictions of being part of the corporate rock beast. Not surprisingly, Chris is under no illusions.\n\n“We’re not idiots,” snorts Chris. “We know where we are. We know we’re part of the machinery. We just don’t like the way that machinery is running right now. And if we’re going to be part of that machinery, who says our part of the machine can’t revolt?”\n\nA stance not uncommon to Jane’s Addiction. Subversion from within. Whatever, it’s a real statement of intent.\n\n“It’s a more militant stance. It has to be that way,” stresses Chris, “because you have to start questioning things. A lot of people say ‘you haven’t been around twenty years.’ Well, fuck, I know I haven’t! But if I haven’t been doing it twenty years, how come I can get onstage with my band, sing my songs, do it without a corporate sponsor, and I can still sell that amount of records!?”\n\n“I read something,” he continues, “where they said, ‘well, but you’re on a record label.’ C’mon, would you, please! It’s like grasping at straws. At least take the time to sit down and come up with a defence before you open your mouth.”\n\n“Corporate sponsorship keeping the ticket prices lower!? How can bands say these things, when their tickets are as high priced as anyone’s. How are they going to justify keeping their ticket prices low with a corporate sponsor when they’ve juts put another $1,000,000 in their bank account?”\n\nAlthough Chris feels he has to shed light on the cynical, money-fixated music industry, it’s clear he’d be far happier just enthusing about his music. In the final analysis he would prefer not to “take on the global corporate community,” but he’s a man of principle. His tirade continues, now switching to the topic of lip synching.\n\n“Look at the way people make record. Now, if you think that’s OK, then you’re saying it’s fine to cheat everyone. It’s a lie. The only reason that exists is because at the end of the day, is because at the end of the day, the record label does not care about the integrity of the artist or the music. Why have someone who might not seem to be attractive ti people when you can just go hire a model to lip synch and look great. Then people go ‘hell, yeah, I’ll buy that.’ You have to start using your fuckin’ head,” stresses Chris, “and start thinking.”\n\nPre-empting my next thought he turns more specifically to rock music.\n\n“If you love rock bands who get onstage and lip synch, how are they making records? If they can’t get onstage and sing their backing parts how can they justify it?”\n\nRight, it takes away the trust if the audience twig onto it.\n\n“And it should!” opines Chris firmly. “The Black Crowes don’t kiss n’ tell. The Black Crowes don’t bite the hand that feeds. We’re just saying there are very big aspects of the music business that we refuse to be part of.”\n\nYes, all that needs to be said, but I decided it was time to change the subject. What about the positive aspects of the last year?\n\n“Every aspect has been positive,” he surprisingly replies. “Just for the sheer fact that, if you want to cal this thing ‘success,’ it has allowed us to voice our opinions and have people listen. It’s special, man, whether you agree with me or not. I’m very happy that I’m in a place where I get to talk.”\n\nChris adds, “I got to play in the only band I’ve ever wanted to be in, every night for sixteen months and I’m not done…I’ll never be done!”\n\nChris could talk the arse off an elephant but the guy looks exhausted. Perhaps it’s the strain of the band’s hectic schedule, the non-stop touring, the hectic promotional schedule of the last few days, which included their appearance at Ronnie Scott’s the previous evening. His line of thought occasionally gets tangled but he’s essentially a great communicator with an unusual charm.\n\nSo, Chris, you say you’re more positive but haven’t some of your recent experiences made you a little more cynical in some respects?\n\n“I’m more of an optimist,” he affirms. “I was much more of a cynic a year ago.”\n\nInevitably, that optimism is rooted in Chris’s love and belief in his band’s music. As he says:\n\n“At the end of the day, my band get onstage and as a person who’s not playing an instrument, I can see what’s going on. I just love the sound that rolls off the stage.I get high writing songs with my brother Rich, man. He plays me something new and I can’t sleep for a week cos I’m like ‘hey I can’t wait…'”\n\n“When I get up onstage it makes it all that much clearer; that’s why we’re here. It makes our dicks hard to get up there and do it,” enthuses Chris. “It really does it better than any drugs!”\n\nMy thoughts turn around to how The Black Crowes view the way they’re presented and promoted in our own fair isle. But it seems you’ve still got a way to go here in terms of ‘commercial’ success.\n\n“It’s funny. I was having that conversation with our manager today. I will never be, and I say this right now, the kind of artist that passes the buck.”\n\n“If it happens it happens,” he adds philosophically. “I have a great time coming over here and we have fans. We’ll continue to come and play. I’m not going to get bent out of shape and start pointing the finger and blaming people if we don’t hit the Top Ten!”\n\nAfter a long pause, his thoughts, unsurprisingly drift back towards their music:\n\n“It can be a very earthy, real, tangible thing that makes you think about a lot of different things. That makes you feel tingly,” his voice trails off savouring the final word.\n\nLet’s talk Donington. The Black Crowes, as you’re no doubt aware, will be opening the festivities. They might just steal the show. Chris, any thoughts?\n\n“We’re gonna go and play some Black Crowes music,” he says simply. “It’s going to be great. If we had a problem with it we wouldn’t do it.” A wide grin spreads across his face. “Any place that Bad News played we’re gonna go all the way to be there!!”\n\nDonington will enable the band to showcase some of their new songs to a massive audience, doubtless, some of which will appear on their next album. Chris is straining like a rabid dog to get back into the studio.\n\n“Some songs are ready,” he reveals. “We have the material. We’ll have more material when we get in there. Nothing but optimism lies on the horizon.”\n\nAnd with all the intensive touring behind them the band should be as tight as our publisher’s purse strings!!\n\nMr Robinson continues: “All our albums [album, Chris, album!] are painting a picture of what’s going on in our lives; what’s important to me and Rich at the time, what I wanna convey as a lyricist.”\n\nChris further reveals that record will be “more stripped down.”\n\n“It’ll be more militant. It’s a militant stance. We’re not the same people we were two years ago. Who is, man!? If you’re a real artist and true to yourself, you can’t repeat things you’ve already done.”\n\nDespite the ups and downs of success, Chris Robinson remains an eternal optimist with an unquenchable spirit:\n\n“It’s a weird game man. We knew about it when we showed up. We brought a big bat and a bit glove and we’re ready to play ball. Let’s go!!”\n\nJimmy Page & The Black Crowes Live At The Greek (2000)\n\nFrom amazon.com\n\nReview Possibly the best “live” album ever released. Even better than The Song Remains The Same. This is Led Zeppelin live as they’ve never been heard! What started as a one-off fund rasier in London grew to what is now a full fledged tour. Why? Because this band belongs in the Rock’N’Roll Hall Of Fame now!\n\nYou’ve never heard Zep songs this lush in a live setting. The Crowes have the Zep songs down pat (I’ve read that they sat around listening to all the Zep albums). From the first note to the last, what a treat. All the force of Zep plus two other guitars and a keyboard player.\n\nHighlights from the Zep catalog include Ten Years Gone, with a slow bluesy guitar romp that’s incredible; Jimmy’s slide guitar on In My Time Of Dying is stupendous and wait until you hear the organ intro and outro on Your Time Is Gonna Come, it’ll make you cry it’s so sweet. And That’s just the first disc!\n\nThe Lemon Song opens side two with all the gut=wrenching blues of the first Zep album rolled into one song; and then the three guitar attack of Nobody’s Fault But Mine just absolutely ignites the song like never before; and then there’s the Out On The Tiles/Whole Lotta Love Medley that finishes the album will leave you wishing that you had been there.\n\nThen there’s the other cover tunes(problems with Sony keep most of the Crowes tune off the album which is disappointing because Rich Robinson’s best solos are on them, i.e., Remedy, No Speak No Slave), Shape Of Things is done ala Jeff Beck Group with the lead solo done Yardbirds (? ); BB King’s Woke Up This Morning will definitely wake you up with it’s foot stopmin’ pace and Jimmy rips this solo out that shreds!\n\nThe slide guitar battles on Sloppy Drunk are incredible (more shredding), not to mention Willie Dixon’s Mellow Down Easy and the Mac’s Oh Well are equally awesome. Too bad they take after Pearl Jam and have soundboards available for every show. The textures of the Zep songs will please even those who don’t buy live albums because the sound too different from the record(cd) will enjoy these discs.\n\nThis release suparses the musicmaker Excess All Areas as there aren’t any gaps in between the songs. The only disappointment is that both shows weren’t released in their entirety (the shows were recorded Oct. 18 & 19. 1999) If you love loud hard guitar based music then this is an absolute must have collection.\n\nReview For many people, Jimmy Page IS the soul of Led Zep. Back in 1999, after finishing his world tour with Robert Plant – he went on tour with the Black Crowes presumably to fill the hole in the soul. And you know what? The combination worked.\n\nI had no idea what to expect when I heard that the two had teamed up. The Black Crowes? All I knew was their cover “Hard to Handle” and “Shake Your Money Maker.” So the real reason for me buying this may have been Jimmy Page – but it takes two to tango – and incredibly, the Black Crowes made a perfect fit.\n\nLive At The Greek is a trip into the heady past of Zep and its roots. Chris Robinson doesn’t have quite the same range as Plant – but comes close surprisingly in spirit and feel. Surprisingly, he feels like a young Plant bursting out of the gates. It’s not easy singing any Zep song, but Robinson does his best in hitting the high notes. He succeeds on most tracks -like Celebration Day, Out on the Tiles, Sick Again, Custard Pie -but he kinda flops on Heartbreaker. (That’s a minor foible though) The band just rocks though and never lets up – twin guitars playing Zep and the blues – creating a full on sound that even Zep couldn’t do in its later touring years.\n\nIronically, the Page-Black Crowes combination evokes much of Zep’s early years precisely because of the straight arrangements and the blues covers. More so than Page-Plant could really do. Of course there’s no substitute for the real thing, but you can’t blame a guy like Jimmy Page for jamming the world’s greatest rock songs can you?\n\nJimmy Page & The Black Crowes Live At The Greek (2000)\n\nFrom amazon.com\n\nRock ‘n’ Roll is all about fantasy, mostly about sexual fantasy (e.g. AC/DC’s “Whole Lotta Rosie”), but sometimes it is just about Rock ‘n’ Roll fantasy.\n\nSuch as, what if Jimmy Page found himself at a lose end and wanted to go out on tour? So who could he pick as a backing band? Perhaps his long time admirers and possibly America’s tightest jamming band The Black Crowes? And what could they pick as a set list? A selection of Led Zeppelin’s finest and just for good measure some of the finest standards laid down? Well, for once it was not fantasy, but reality. Rehearsals took place and dates were set and this amazing combination hit the road, playing to packed arena’s the length and breadth of America, with astounding results.\n\nFortunately plans were made to record the event for all time and here are the results. At first only released on the Internet, but sense was seen and the whole Shishkerbang was let loose on the eagerly awaiting Rock Public. For those amongst you who may feel that it is sacrilegious for anyone else to perform these songs, especially for old Robert (Percy) Plant not to be singing, hollering, and cajoling every nuance out of these classic’s.\n\nFear not. Chris Robinson, the Crowes’ vocalist, does not even attempt to imitate the great man, singing everything in his own style giving each song a new slant. The rest of the Crowes play with such abandon, I have never heard them play with such verve and panache, and this is somebody who has been a huge fan of the band for over ten years. The rhythm section of Pipien and Gorman keep a lock sold groove going whilst losing nothing of the looseness that keeps the music spontaneous and alive.\n\nProbably the biggest sound difference on the Zeppelin classics is that although John Paul Jones used to double up on bass and keyboards (an exemplary job he did, too) in that band his use of piano was very sparing, whereas Ed Harsch is not frightened to push the piano right to the front of the sounds cape, soloing when any opportunity arises. But it is the three pronged guitar attack that floors you. Combining together to give the raunchiest guitar sound that has ever been heard on this little planet. (Lynyrd Skynyrd are stunning, make no mistake, this is just one step beyond) Obviously it’s Jimmy Page that steals the show. I doubt he has ever played better. However, the playing of Chris’s brother Rich Robinson, and new at the time Crowes guitarist, is of outstanding class, pushing their guest player to the outer limits of his ability.\n\nThe Song selection is spot on. The guitar duel in “You Shook Me” is nothing short of jaw dropping, specially as it follows a version of that old Elmore James classic “Shake Your Money Maker”, which rattles the roof tops and would bring a smile to even the most stern of anorak Rock ‘n’ Roll connoisseurs. Chris Robinson turns in a truly saucy version of “The Lemon Song”. The choice of Jimmy Page’s contemporary guitarist/songwriter Peter Green’s finest song written whilst in Fleetwood Mac, “Oh Well” is a pure delight.\n\nThere has never been a better version of “Heartbreaker” with Jimmy Page really stepping out on this one. So topped and tailed with “Celebration day” and “Whole Lotta Love” across two hours of music spread over two CD’s. You get Six cover versions and fourteen classic Zeppelin tracks (all with credit due to Willie Dixon and C. Burnett), played by a bunch of guys, who are having the time of their lives. This is certainly one of the top three Rock ‘n’ Roll Live albums of all time.\n\nAs an extra – if you have a computer you can watch them performing snippets of the songs live from your disc drive plus some very good stills taken from the Greek, where it becomes even more apparent how well they all gelled as a unit and what a good time they were having.\n\nAfter this tour the Black Crowes went back into the studios to record their next album, the very heavily Zeppelin influenced “Lions”, since when, it’s been rumoured, they have disbanded, probably feeling it would be hard to top the Jimmy Page tour. One is also left to reflect what a shame it was that “Led Zeppelin” never recorded a decent live album. “The Song Remains The Same” is not a bad album, but hardly a killer. “Live at the Greek” leaves it for dead.\n\nThe Black Crowes Southern Harmony & Musical Companion (1992)\n\nFrom amazon.com\n\nReview When The Crowes hired guitarist Marc Ford just before this album was recorded, they gave him something like 30 songs to learn, but when he showed up for the first day of sessions, lo and behold, he found that Chris and Rich had scrapped all those songs an had rewritten the whole album in two weekends. They proceeded to record the entire deal in eight days, and after some aggrivating attempts at mixing, Chris took the album home and “hot mixed” it in one night.\n\nFour days writing, eight days recording, and one all night mix. This is what rock is all about. The finished product is a masterpiece, and all in a fortnight.\n\nRather than rehashing which songs are which, it is better to point out the fact that this is a heavily themed album. There are stings, thorns, illness and bad luck, but there are also remedies, harmony and salvation. This album cuts to the core of life, where everything can seem to be right, yet still falls apart, and where perspective is maintained and salvation is found. As they quote Bob M, “Think you’re in Heaven, but you’re livin’ in Hell”\n\nWhen baby bands come out with their sophomore effort, it often falls flat (to put it mildly), but the Crowes were in their finest form on this one, proving that the “Stones Clones” can in fact forge their own way. Although I am a massive fan of the ’67-72 Stones, I challenge anyone to find Mick singing the blues better than Chris on “Bad Luck, Blue Eyes Goodbye”, or injecting more venom than is on “No Speak No Slave”. Well, Mick’s venom is pretty thick on “Turd On The Run” I’ll admit. But I digress…\n\nThis gospel tinged diamond of rock and roll has lived up to its name better than any other album in my life. In the last twelve years it has certainly been by best ‘companion’.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get yourself a new best friend with “Harmony”. If you have a soul, “My Morning Song” will change your life.\n\nIf I could give it six stars, I wouldn’t hesitate.\n\nReview Yes, that’s rawk, not just rock, but rawk.\n\nFrom beginning to end, this album blew me away the first time I heard it, and about 1,000 listens later, now that I’ve heard and realized many of the album’s intricacies that were apparent on first listen, it blows me away even more now. Listen to the intro and through the first verse of Sting Me, the first song, and you’ll swear you’re listening to the Rolling Stones, with a different, more soulful singer (Chris Robinson). However, these guys can rock in more way than one, which they immediately prove in the next song, Remedy, which has to be my personal favourite Crowes song, with it’s incredibly catchy, hard-driven guitar from Rich Robinson, and a great performance from the always superb Chris.\n\nThe album then mellows down only slightly for the next four songs, but the volume drop only serves to enhance Chris’s down-home Southern soul-filled singing, and some incredible lead guitar from Marc Ford, who isn’t with the Crowes anymore, but proves here to be an awesome, underrated soloist with a very unique style. Then comes the 7-8-9 combo of Black Moon Creeping, No Speak No Slave, and My Morning Song, which, in my opinion is one of the best 1-2-3 punches for pure rock value in history; think Whole Lotta Love-What Is & What Should Never Be-Heartbreaker from Led Zeppelin II in terms of how hard these three songs rock.\n\nAs one critic said, Black Moon Creeping features the dirtiest, nastiest guitar tone ever put on vinyl, with a bass-heavy, heavily distorted wah giving the song great grit. However, this tone compares nothing to the wah tone on the following song, No Speak No Slave, during the solo. I literally jumped out of my chair when I heard the wah section of the solo on this track for the first time; absolutely must be heard to be believed.\n\nThe entire song, No Speak No Slave, in fact, needs to be heard; sounds like Zeppelin in their prime. My Morning Song rocks just as hard, and after these three songs you need a break, so the low-key cover of Bob Marley’s Time Will Tell will provide you with that to close off the album, reminding you that not only do these guys rawk, but they make music you can feel, with Southern soul, which is what Marley had, and is what the Crowes add to not just this track but the whole album. This album, in my opinion, deserves to be right up there with the great rock albums of all time, i.e. Led Zeppelin IV, Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of The Moon, etc.\n\nThe Black Crowes Shake Your Money Maker (1990)\n\nFrom amazon.com\n\nBy 1990, the hard rock sound, which peaked in the early 70s, had long since worn out its welcome. It had progressed to the point of becoming a ludicrous parody of itself. Groups like Motley Crue, Poison and Def Leppard were the logical progression of the 70s hard rock sound. They took the look, sound and theatrics of the 70s rockers to ridiculous proportions.\n\nThis was thanks in part to Kiss, who proved that image could be more important than music. By the late 70s, rock groups were taking things a step further and exaggerating the look and style of Mick Jagger, Robert Plant and Steven Tyler.\n\nBy the early/mid 80s, the hard rock look and sound pioneered by the aforementioned names had reached the point of absurdity. Hair metal was all the rage and MTV had ushered in a video era where the look was now just as important as the music, if not more so. With this new image, the quality of the music suffered immensely. This new generation of rockers was so enraptured with the rock and roll lifestyle that they completely forgot about musicianship and artistry. This music is now affectionately known as Cheese Metal or Hair Metal. Music that seems laughable nowadays, with snicker-inducing hair and fashion to match. Music that could, in no way, be taken seriously by any true lover of music.\n\nThe trend wore on and throughout the late 80s, many now-forgotten hair metal groups came and went. Then, in 1990, a group came out of Georgia with a completely different ideology. This group, The Black Crowes, was making music that was completely out of style in this world of hair spray and spandex. Their debut, Shake Your Money Maker, was full of tight, fiery spurts of boogie-rock, the likes of which had not been heard on a major record since the mid-70s. Songs like “Twice As Hard” and “Jealous Again” stood out like a sore thumb amidst the dreary sea of synthesized, phony hard rock of 1990. This was rock that went back to the basics. This was rock that was genuine. Rock that forsook image and style and concentrated on the music and the interplay between musicians.\n\nShake Your Money Maker was a godsend for rock fans who were tired of rockers who leaped about on the stage in tight pink pants while flames erupted from the stage floor. This is real rock and roll. This is not an image. This is music. The Black Crowes took the influence of the best of the early 70s scene. Lead singer Chris Robinson encapsulated the 70s rock lead singer. Summoning a bit of Rod Stewart (The Faces), Steve Marriot (Humble Pie), Steven Tyler (Aerosmith), Paul Rodgers (Free/Bad Company) and Robert Plant (Led Zeppelin) with each song, Robinson took the lead-singer image and idea back to its roots.\n\nThe guitar work of Rich Robinson and Jeff Cease was concise and bluesy, recalling the Mick Taylor-era Rolling Stones. The stinging slide guitar on “Twice As Hard”, must have been a revelation since nearly every bit of blues influence had been drained since the hair-metal revolution. Songs such as “Could I’ve Been So Blind”, “Seeing Things” and “Thick N’ Thin” resuscitated the deceased blues-rock form with vibrance that was sorely lacking from even the best of the mainstream rock acts.\n\nShake Your Money Maker proved that good, old-fashioned rock and roll had not died. The Black Crowes brought it back to life. Los Angeles’ Guns N’ Roses was the only other group to come close to retro blues-rock with their “Appetite For Destruction”, but they were too nihilistic and nasty to truly channel the spirit of classic early 70s rock. Shake Your Money Maker and its follow-up “The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion” was overshadowed by Nirvana’s “Nevermind”, which took rock and roll in a new, unexplored direction. However, The Black Crowes were really the only group to give classic rock lovers their fix of hard riffs, tasty solos and bluesy, wailing vocals.\n\nShake Your Money Maker is an important album, and an oasis in the desert of the 1990 rock scene. This is probably the only 1990 album that sounds as if it could have been recorded in 1973. In 30 years, Shake Your Money Maker will still sound great, whereas most of 1990’s other musical offerings will be long forgotten, and more than likely, unlistenable."
