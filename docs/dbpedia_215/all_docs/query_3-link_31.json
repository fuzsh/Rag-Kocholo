        "text": "For The Black Crowes, 2024 is the new 1990. On new song “Wanting and Waiting,” the band summons the bluesy braggadocio of their early hits like “Jealous Again.”\n\n“Wanting and Waiting” is the lead single from “Happiness Bastards,” the Atlanta-founded band’s first album of original material in 15 years, due March 15.\n\nThe brothers Robinson – frontman Chris Robinson and guitarist Rich Robinson – leverage their strengths on the new Crowes cut. Namely, Chris’ greasy yowl, Rich’s raw crunch, and the brothers’ infectious rock songcraft.\n\nAccording to a new interview with Rolling Stone’s Brian Hiatt, the Robinsons are backed on the recordings by longtime bassist Sven Pipien and drummer Brian Griffin. Both Pipien and Griffin were part of a 30th anniversary tour celebrating “Shake Your Money Maker,” The Crowes’ 1990 debut album. Cully Symington has been the band’s most recent touring drummer.\n\nForthcoming LP “Happiness Bastards” was recorded in early 2023 in Nashville. The tracks were produced by Jay Joyce, who’s worked with country acts like Eric Church and Miranda Lambert and rockers Halestorm and Cage the Elephant. Joyce has also produced ascendant country star Lainey Wilson, who duets with Chris Robinson on “Happiness Bastards” track “Wilted Rose.”\n\nWilson recently told Rolling Stone writer Joe Hudak, “I’m so excited to be a part of the new Black Crowes record. I’m a huge fan of their music and their legacy has truly withstood the test of time. I can’t wait for people to hear our song, ‘Wilted Rose.’ It’s a little country, a little rock and roll, and a whole lot of soul.”\n\nThey’re calling it their 10th but “Happiness Bastards” will be The Crowes’ ninth proper studio effort. The band’s most recent releases include “1972,” a 2022 EP with covers of artists like David Bowie and primary influence The Rolling Stones, and 2010′s “Croweology,” new acoustic recordings mostly of prior Crowes nuggets like “Remedy,” “Wiser Time” and “Soul Singing.”\n\nBack in 1990, The Crowes first broke big with their Aerosmith-style take on ‘60s Otis Redding R&B corker “Hard To Handle.” Pretty heroin ballad “She Talks To Angels” gave them another mainstream toehold.\n\nFollowing the charged and essential 1992 sophomore album “Southern Harmony and the Musical Companion” and cover-art controversial ‘94 disc “Amorica,” The Crowes commercial fortunes quickly faded.\n\nThey pursued a jam-band sound that never really fit. The Robinsons went through a lot of different guitarists, bassists and keyboardists.\n\nThe brothers’ infighting, part of the band’s story since the beginning, became increasingly poisonous. A tell-all book by classic era drummer Steve Gorman got Gorman permanently excommunicated from The Crowes.\n\nSince Chris and Rich reunited in 2019, they’ve focused on touring behind their vintage material. They also reissued their first two albums, expanded with potent outtakes, including previously unreleased tune “Miserable” and a cover of Ann Peebles’ sultry “99 Pounds.”\n\nAccording to The Black Crowes website, forthcoming LP “Happiness Bastards,” available for preorder, features titles such as: “Rats and Clowns,” “Dirty Cold Sun,” “Bleed It Dry” and “Follow the Moon.” In a new interview with Guitar World, singer Chris Robinson called the album “our love letter to rock n’ roll.”\n\nMORE ON MUSIC\n\nGwar is hell: The secrets of heavy-metal’s grossest band\n\nHow Prince, Michael Jackson fit into ‘80s rock band Warrant’s story\n\nHenry Rollins talks tour, loving early Madonna, why Pamela Anderson rules\n\nInside hit-making Alabama band’s reunion tour, first new songs in 25 years\n\nThe surprise rebirth of a classic American hard-rock band"
