        "text": "Welcome to the OpenWrt Project\n\nThe OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully writable filesystem with package management. This frees you from the application selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application. For developers, OpenWrt is the framework to build an application without having to build a complete firmware around it; for users this means the ability for full customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned.\n\nSee the Table of Hardware for supported devices. For more information about OpenWrt project organization, see the About OpenWrt pages.\n\nOpenWrt Summit 2024 & Battlemesh v16\n\nThe OpenWrt community is excited to announce the OpenWrt Summit 2024, a gathering for all enthusiasts of the project. The event, celebrating OpenWrt's 20th anniversary, promises a relaxed atmosphere filled with social activities, including an auction of the OpenWrt One, and a special anniversary cake!\n\nScheduled for May 18 in Tatlısu, Cyprus, and May 19 in Nicosia the summit coincides with Battlemesh v16, beginning May 15. Attendees are encouraged to arrive by May 14 and leave on May 20 to fully experience the event and the unique visits planned. Admission is free and open to everyone interested. For more details, check the email announcement.\n\nProject statement about xz 5.6.1 (CVE-2024-3094)\n\nOpenWrt appears to be unaffected by CVE-2024-3094, as the compromised versions of xz used were sourced from GitHub releases, which only included a dormant segment of the malicious code. The essential component required to activate the backdoor during the build process was not found in the examined tarball archives. For the details see email announcement or the forum post.\n\nCurrent stable series: OpenWrt 23.05\n\nThe OpenWrt Community is proud to present the OpenWrt 23.05 stable version series. It is the successor of the previous 22.03 stable major release.\n\nCurrent stable release - OpenWrt 23.05.4\n\nThe current stable version series of OpenWrt is 23.05, with v23.05.4 being the latest release of the series. It was released on 20. July 2024.\n\n→ Read more...\n\nOld stable series: OpenWrt 22.03\n\nThe OpenWrt Community is proud to present the OpenWrt 22.03 stable version series. It is the successor of the previous 21.02 stable major release.\n\nThe OpenWrt 22.03 series focuses on the migration from iptables based firewall3 to the nftables based firewall4.\n\nOld stable Release - OpenWrt 22.03.7\n\nThe current stable version series of OpenWrt is 22.03, with v22.03.7 being the latest release of the series. It was released on 25. July 2024.\n\n→ Read more...\n\nWhy use OpenWrt?\n\nPeople install OpenWrt because they believe it works better than the stock firmware from their vendor. They find it is more stable, offers more features, is more secure and has better support.\n\nExtensibility: OpenWrt provides many capabilities found only in high-end devices. Its 3000+ application packages are standardized, so you can easily replicate the same setup on any supported device, including two (or even five) year old routers. More...\n\nSecurity: OpenWrt's standard installation is secure by default, with Wi-Fi disabled, no poor passwords or backdoors. OpenWrt's software components are kept up-to-date, so vulnerabilities get closed shortly after they are discovered. More...\n\nPerformance and Stability: OpenWrt firmware is made of standardized modules used in all supported devices. This means each module will likely receive more testing and bug fixing than stock firmware which can be tweaked for each product line and never touched again. More...\n\nStrong Community Support: OpenWrt team members are regular participants on the OpenWrt Forum, OpenWrt Developer and OpenWrt Admin mailing lists, and LEDE's IRC channels. You can interact directly with developers, volunteers managing the software modules and with other long-time OpenWrt users, drastically increasing the chances you will solve the issue at hand. More...\n\nResearch: Many teams use OpenWrt as a platform for their research into network performance. This means that the improvements of their successful experiments will be available in OpenWrt first, well before it gets incorporated into mainline, vendor firmware. More...\n\nOpen Source/No additional cost: OpenWrt is provided without any monetary cost. It has been entirely created by a team of volunteers: developers and maintainers, individuals and companies. If you enjoy using OpenWrt, consider contributing some effort to help us improve it for others! All of the above is possible because OpenWrt is part of the Open Source community, and powered by Linux kernel. Get the source code...\n\nAnd more...\n\n→ Read more reasons to use OpenWrt...\n\nOpenWrt Joins Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC)\n\nSFC has welcomed us into their organization1):\n\nSeptember 10, 2020 OpenWrt — building on their sixteen years of success as the most popular Free and Open Source (FOSS) wireless router project — today joins Conservancy as a member project. FOSS wireless routers assure software freedom for all Internet users. Conservancy will help OpenWrt continue to thrive and grow as its new fiscal sponsor. OpenWrt occupies a special place in the history of software freedom. OpenWrt's creation and launch shows that GPL enforcement works and advances software freedom. In 2004, when Linksys released the firmware code for the WRT54G router series, coders and tinkerers regained control over their own routers, and launched OpenWrt based on the sources liberated from GPL enforcement. Today, OpenWrt leverages software freedom protected by the GPL to share that freedom and control with everyone who uses wireless routers to connect to the Internet.\n\n→ Read more...\n\nOpenWrt wants you!\n\nLike any open source project, OpenWrt thrives on the efforts of its users and developers.\n\nIf you want to develop the software, please refer to our Developer Guide to learn how to get the source code, build it, and contribute your changes back to the project.\n\nIf you're not a developer, you can still help. The documentation can always be improved (even if it's to verify that the instructions match your experience), or you can help other community members with questions. Don’t hesitate to Register yourself in the wiki, or join our mailing list and IRC channels to get in touch.\n\nLast modified: 2024/04/10 13:49\n\nby ynezz"
