[Laughs] That's what I do. I don't think it would have anything to do with something like that. My life has been the life of, you know, the ideas. I'm the one who put the band together. I'm the one who pointed us in the direction. You know, Rich [Robinson, guitar] and I wrote the songs. I'm the one that lived the life, as well. So to have someone's view from the sideline or someone's view who wasn't at those parties or didn't live that life or didn't create anything is going to be much different than the person's who has.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I've been offered; book deals have come and gone. I'm kind of still in the second act, you know what I mean? I'm still 20 years away from even beginning to slow down and put it all together in that sort of term. I think the best rock and roll books or whatever you want to call them are the way Patti Smith [approached hers]. My life, no matter what, has been a dream. That's what I do. So, it would be much different than writing about some stuff that you watched.\"\n\n\"Hard To Handle: The Life And Death Of The Black Crowes - A Memoir\" was written by Gorman, along with contributor Steven Hyden. The 368-page hardcover book will be published on September 24 by Da Capo Press.\n\nTHE BLACK CROWES played their final show in December 2013.\n\nLast year, Chris put together a band called AS THE CROW FLIES to perform primarily BLACK CROWES songs. Joining the singer in the new group are fellow former CROWES members Adam MacDougall, Andy Hess and Audley Freed, plus Marcus King and Tony Leone.\n\nRich Robinson is currently involved with THE MAGPIE SALUTE in which he is joined by Marc Ford from THE BLACK CROWES, bassist Sven Pipien (also from the CROWES) along with lead singer John Hogg (HOOKAH BROWN, MOKE),drummer Joe Magistro and guitarist Nico Bereciartua."
