        "text": "American pop rock band\n\nMaroon 5 is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California.[3][4] It consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Adam Levine, rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Jesse Carmichael, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, keyboardist PJ Morton and multi-instrumentalist and bassist Sam Farrar. Original members Levine, Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, and drummer Ryan Dusick first came together as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they were in high school.\n\nAfter self-releasing their independent album We Like Digging?, the band signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. The album garnered a tepid response, after which the record label dropped the band and the members focused on college. In 2001, the band re-emerged as Maroon 5, pursuing a different direction and adding guitarist Valentine.[5] The band signed with Octone Records, an independent record label with a separate joint venture relationship with J Records and released their debut album Songs About Jane in June 2002. Aided by the hit singles \"Harder to Breathe\", \"This Love\" and \"She Will Be Loved\", the album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 chart[6] and went quadruple platinum in 2005. In the same year, the band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist.[7] In 2006, Dusick left the band after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn.\n\nThe band's second album It Won't Be Soon Before Long was released in May 2007.[8] It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single \"Makes Me Wonder\", became the band's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2010, the band released their third album Hands All Over, to favorable reviews, re-releasing a year later to include the single \"Moves like Jagger\", which topped the Billboard Hot 100. In 2012, Carmichael left the group and was replaced by musician PJ Morton, as the band released the fourth album Overexposed, with the song \"One More Night\", topping the Billboard Hot 100 chart for nine consecutive weeks.\n\nIn 2014, Carmichael rejoined the band alongside Morton to record the fifth album V (roman numeral pronounced \"five\"), with the band signed to Interscope Records and Levine's own label 222 Records. Following the release of V, it reached number one on the Billboard 200. In 2016, Maroon 5 recruited their long-time collaborator Sam Farrar, as the band continued for the sixth studio album Red Pill Blues, which was released in November 2017. With the addition of Morton and Farrar, the band's lineup increased to seven members. The successful singles of both albums \"Sugar\" and \"Girls Like You\" peaked at numbers two and one on the Hot 100 chart respectively. Madden announced his departure from the band in 2020 following his arrest on domestic violence charges, with Farrar becoming their new bassist. The band's seventh album Jordi, was released in June 2021. Maroon 5 has sold more than 135 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists.[9] In January 2023, it was announced \"Moves like Jagger\" is the second most downloaded song of all time.[10][11]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n1994–2001: Kara's Flowers and the formation of Maroon 5\n\n[edit]\n\nAdam Levine was introduced to Ryan Dusick by a mutual friend and guitarist, Adam Salzman. Levine was 15 years old, and Dusick was 16.[12] Three of the five members of the band started playing together at age 12. The four original members of the band met while attending Brentwood School in Los Angeles.[13][14] While attending Brentwood School, Levine and Jesse Carmichael joined with Mickey Madden and Dusick to form Kara's Flowers,[15] a rock band. The name was taken from a girl that went to their high school that the band had a \"collective crush\" on.[14] The band independently released an album, We Like Digging?, in late 1994.[16] The band would play many shows through the next few years, and would also record their official debut. While they were playing a beach party in Malibu, independent producer Tommy Allen heard them play and offered to manage them and record a complete record with his partner, songwriter John DeNicola, who is known for his work on Dirty Dancing (1987) – including \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\". Producer Rob Cavallo's management team heard the record Allen and DeNicola produced, which eventually led Cavallo to offer them a deal with Reprise Records, re-recording the album.[17] However, after the release of The Fourth World, during Levine and Madden's senior year of high school in 1997, it had morphed into a band with a style reminiscent of 1960s Britpop.[14] Despite high expectations from the band and record company, the album failed to catch on and their lead single, \"Soap Disco\", was a failure.[18] According to Levine, the failure of the album was \"a huge disappointment\" that nearly led them to break up.[14][19] The album sold around 5,000 copies and the band was dropped after six months.[20]\n\nBetween 2000 and 2001, the band would play very sporadic shows, due to the members going to college. Dusick and Madden attended college locally at University of California, Los Angeles, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the East coast to attend Five Towns College, in Dix Hills, Long Island, New York.[21] While Levine and Carmichael were in New York, they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote.[22]\n\nWhen the band returned in 2001, they brought those influences with them.[19] Frequent collaborator and future member Sam Farrar (then only the bassist of the band Phantom Planet) explained that the Aaliyah song \"Are You That Somebody?\" affected the band and influenced the song \"Not Coming Home\".[14] Producer Tim Sommer signed them to a demo deal with MCA Records and produced three tracks with them in Los Angeles in the middle of 2001, with Mark Dearnley engineering. Against Sommer's advice, MCA declined to pick up the band, and these tracks were never released. The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before acquired by Octone Records executives James Diener, Ben Berkman and David Boxenbaum.[19] While looking for talent for the Octone label, Berkman was given a bunch of demos by the brother of a former colleague at Columbia Records and the song that caught his attention was \"'Sunday Morning'\" which he referred to as a \"genius song\".[20] Berkman was surprised the song was credited to Kara's Flowers, because the band sounded completely different from the one he had heard while at Warner Bros. Records.[23]\n\nBerkman encouraged Diener and Boxenbaum to fly out to Los Angeles to watch a showcase gig at The Viper Room for the four-piece Kara's Flowers.[20] After watching Levine onstage, they were convinced. Berkman believed what the band needed was a \"fifth member to play the guitar and free up the singer, so he could be the star I perceived him to be\".[20] Octone insisted that the band change its name to break with its pop past.[20] The label began looking for a full-time guitarist to enable Levine to focus on performing as the frontman. James Valentine (from the L.A. band Square) was recruited.[19] On his joining the band, Valentine commented: \"I became friends with them and we sort of started jamming together, it was very much like I was cheating on my band, we were having sort of an affair and I eventually quit my other band to join up with them.\"[19] After hearing Levine play, Valentine noticed his affinity for Phish and the two musicians bonded over the band.[24] After briefly being known as simply \"Maroon\", the band changed their name to \"Maroon 5\".[1] In an interview with Howard Stern, Levine revealed that the only person outside of the band to know the story behind the name change is Billy Joel.[25]\n\n2002–2006: Songs About Jane and Dusick's departure\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Songs About Jane\n\nJames Valentine attended Berklee College of Music with John Mayer in 1996, where they developed a rapport. In 2002, the two reconnected at a Mayer radio broadcast. After Mayer heard their album, he was so impressed (particularly by \"This Love\", which became the most successful release off the album) that he invited them to open for him during his early 2003 tour.[14] The first single, \"Harder to Breathe\", slowly started to pick up airplay which helped sales of the album. By March 2004, the album had reached the Top 20 of the Billboard 200 and \"Harder to Breathe\" had made the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts. The album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 in September 2004,[28] 26 months after its release; this was the longest period between an album's release and its initial Top 10 appearance since SoundScan results were included in the Billboard 200 in 1991.[29] The album went on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide.[30] Mayer invited the band to open for him again in 2004.[31] Over the next three years, the band toured, including visits to seventeen countries. During this time, the band toured with Michelle Branch, Graham Colton, and the Rolling Stones.[32][33] Other acts the band toured alongside included Gavin DeGraw,[34] Matchbox Twenty, Sugar Ray,[35] Counting Crows,[36] Phantom Planet,[37] the Hives,[38] Dashboard Confessional,[39] Simon Dawes,[40] the Thrills, Thirsty Merc, Marc Broussard, the Donnas, the RedWest, Michael Tolcher, and Guster.[41]\n\nSongs About Jane reached No. 1 on the Australian albums (ARIA),[42] while \"Harder to Breathe\" made the Top 20 singles charts in the US[43] and UK,[42] and Top 40 in Australia and New Zealand.[42] The album climbed to No. 1 in the UK.[42] The second single, \"This Love\", reached number five in the US,[43] number three in the UK, and number eight in Australia.[42] The third single, \"She Will Be Loved\", reached the number five in both the US[43] and the UK, and number-one in Australia.[42] The fourth single, \"Sunday Morning\", reached the Top 40 in the US,[43] UK, and Australia.[42] Maroon 5 played Live 8, in Philadelphia in 2005. Their set included a cover of Neil Young's \"Rockin' in the Free World\" and frontman Levine performed with Stevie Wonder.[44] On May 13, 2005, in the band wrapped up the 2005 Honda Civic Tour, which it headlined.[45] On June 9, 2005, the band performed at the American Film Institute's tribute to filmmaker George Lucas. Lucas himself had selected Maroon 5 for the event, as it was his children's favorite band at the time.[46] Over the years of touring with the band their drummer, percussionist and backing vocalist Ryan Dusick had been suffering from the touring life.[47] The strains of non-stop touring aggravated an old sports injury.[13] After several absences from the tour with Ryland Steen and Josh Day taking his place, Dusick left the band in September 2006.[27] Matt Flynn, the former drummer of Gavin DeGraw and The B-52's, joined the band as Dusick's replacement.[48]\n\n2007–2008: It Won't Be Soon Before Long\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter recording for eight months, Maroon 5's second album It Won't Be Soon Before Long, was released worldwide in May 2007 by A&M Octone Records.[49] Levine described the follow-up to Songs About Jane is \"sexier and stronger\",[50] gaining inspiration from iconic 80s artists such as Prince, Shabba Ranks, Michael Jackson and Talking Heads.[51] Ann Powers writing for Los Angeles Times said It Won't Be Soon Before Long is \"An icy-hot blend of electro-funk and blue-eyed soul that works its cruel streak with the confidence of Daniel Craig's James Bond\".[52] Before its release, \"Makes Me Wonder\" was the No. 1 selling single and video on iTunes.[50] It was also the No. 1 selling album, with more than 50,000 digital pre-sales.[50] After its release, the album broke iTunes sales records its week of release, selling over 101,000 copies.[53] The first single \"Makes Me Wonder\", was released to radio March 27, 2007. The song debuted at number 84 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the first week of May, the single skyrocketed from a lowly position of No. 64 to No. 1, the biggest jump in Billboard history at the time.[54] \"Makes Me Wonder\" has also achieved No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs, Pop 100, and Hot Dance Club Play charts.[55]\n\nTo support the album, the band performed on a ten-date club tour in which visited small venues in Europe and the United States from April to June 2007.[56][57] The band followed with a concert that streamed live via MSN Music in mid-June.[58] On July 10, it opened for The Police in Miami,[59] and followed with an acoustic performance at the Miami club, Studio A, the next day.[60] The band headlined the It Won't Be Soon Before Long Tour took place in late 2007, where they toured 28 cities in North America. The tour began September 29 touring in 28 cities in North America and concluded November 10, 2007.[61] The Hives, as the tour's special guest, performed on all of the dates while Sara Bareilles, Kevin Michael and Phantom Planet each performed in a portion of the tour.[62] It toured with Dashboard Confessional in their world tour and on March 28, 2008, it began touring with OneRepublic, Brandi Carlile, and Ry Cuming. The band has performed \"Makes Me Wonder\" on season 6 and \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" in season 7 of American Idol, which they also appeared on the show's special edition titled \"Idol Gives Back\" in the latter season. In May 2008, Maroon 5 released a new duet version of \"If I Never See Your Face Again\", with Rihanna. It appeared on both the band's re-released second album and Rihanna's re-release of her album Good Girl Gone Bad. The band's song \"Goodnight Goodnight\", appeared on The CW's fall 2008 advertisement.[63] Maroon 5 also performed with the song in CSI: NY, where they guest star in the fifth season episode \"Page Turner\" in October 2008.[64]\n\n2009–2012: Hands All Over\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Hands All Over (album)\n\nLevine stated that he believed the band was reaching its peak and may make one more album before disbanding.[65] He explained, \"Eventually I want to focus on being a completely different person because I don't know if I want to do this into my 40s and 50s and beyond, like the Rolling Stones\".[66] Levine later dispelled any rumors of the band breaking up, saying: \"I love what I do and think that, yes, it might be tiring and complicated at times [but] we don't have any plans on disbanding any time soon\".[67]\n\nIn January 2009, Maroon 5 performed at the Renaissance Hotel in Washington, D.C., for the \"Declare Yourself\" event in honor of the inauguration of President Barack Obama.[68] The band recorded a cover version of \"The Way You Look Tonight\", which appeared on the Frank Sinatra tribute album His Way, Our Way.[69] It was also included on the soundtrack to the 2010 film Valentine's Day.[70]\n\nMaroon 5's third studio album was recorded in mid 2009 in Switzerland, where the band was joined by record producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange.[71] During the band's time on touring along with artists and groups are served as opening acts for the Back to School Tour in November, with Kate Earl and Fitz and the Tantrums[72] and the Palm Trees & Power Lines Tour in 2010, with OneRepublic, Bruno Mars, Kris Allen, Ry Cuming, VV Brown, Owl City and actor Jason Segel,[73] respectively.[74] The band's third album titled Hands All Over, was released on September 21, 2010.[75] It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200.[76] Despite the high placement on the Billboard 200 only 142,000 copies were sold, which was relatively weak compared to their previous album It Won't Be Soon Before Long, which debuted at number one with 429,000 copies.[76] The album received mixed reviews from music critics, though many of them praised it for its production. The first single of the album \"Misery\", was released on June 22, 2010, and peaking at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100.

I just think people would be surprised to know that we're a self-contained unit. We're a band that does their own thing. There's no puppet master.\"[196] However, in an article about the songwriter and producer Benny Blanco, it is revealed that at least some of the band's songs, such as \"Moves like Jagger,\" are the product of efforts by or collaborations with, professional songwriters and producers.[197] In the same article, Levine says, \"It's almost as if [Benny Blanco] has the Midas touch in putting the right people together at the right time to create a musical moment. He's about collaboration. And he's so good at nailing down who does everything best.\"[198]\n\nAdam Levine cited Britpop band Oasis as \"one of the best bands ever\" and said \"We love Oasis\".[199] The band has cited Michael Jackson, The Beatles, The Police, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, the Bee Gees, Tonic, Prince, Tupac Shakur and Marvin Gaye as influences.[200][201][202] Levine has also cited Billy Joel as an influence.[44] Furthermore, guitarist James Valentine said he was influenced by guitarists like Pat Metheny, Bill Frisell and John Scofield, as well as the rock band Queens of the Stone Age.[203] The band's songs tend to be very guitar-heavy, often accompanied by piano or synthesizer. The theme in most of their songs is love, frequently lost love; songs like \"This Love\", \"Makes Me Wonder\" and \"Misery\" have a very cynical tone, often expressing dissatisfaction with a relationship, while their more heartfelt and emotional songs such as \"She Will Be Loved\" and \"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\" express a longing for a romantic relationship. \"Makes Me Wonder\" has a secondary theme, in which Levine expresses his disillusionment and frustration with the state of American politics and the Iraq War.[204]\n\nThe band's style changes from album to album. Songs About Jane consists of songs about Levine's ex-girlfriend Jane Herman. On It Won't Be Soon Before Long the songs are less personal and are more electric with more use of synthesizers, creating a retro feel. Hands All Over continues the band's lost love theme, along with songs about infatuation and was re-released in 2011, with the hit single \"Moves like Jagger\", an electropop song which represents a drastic change in the band's sound, with more of a dance feel to it. \"It was one of those songs that was definitely a risk\", Levine said. \"It's a bold statement. We've never really released a song like that. But it's exciting to do something different, do something new. I'm just glad that everyone likes it.\"[205] James Valentine called Overexposed \"our most 'pop' record ever and we weren't shy about really going for it\".[206] They also have experimented with new wave[207][208][209] and disco[210][211] sounds on several albums.\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nIn an interview with Variety in November 2018, the frontman of the band, Adam Levine, when asked if the band is pop, rock or urban, said, \"Something unique to this band is that we have always looked to hip-hop, R&B, all rhythmic forms of music, from back when we were writing our first album to now. Rock music is nowhere, really. I don't know where it is. If it's around, no one's invited me to the party. All of the innovation and the incredible things happening in music are in hip-hop\".[212] This statement prompted widespread criticism from rock fans and some rock stars. Despite this backlash, the band saw a continued increase in popularity and commercial success in 2018, leading them to become one of the world's best-selling pop bands.
