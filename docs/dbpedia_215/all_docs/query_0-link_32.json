        "text": "American rock band\n\nDrivin N Cryin is an American Southern rock band from Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe band was formed in 1985, soon after Kevn Kinney had relocated to Atlanta from Milwaukee..[1] Kinney was working at a sewage treatment plant by day, and was playing folk music at night. He met Frank French at the latter's recording studio, Dragon Path Music, and the two soon began writing original songs at night, sometimes while working at French's shop, Far East Futon Company. Kinney also joined forces with Tim Nielsen, who was in a popular band called the Nightporters, with drummer Paul Lenz. The band's name, Drivin N Cryin was chosen from one of Kinney's many songs that reflected the two directions of the band's music.\n\nIn 1986, having become one of Atlanta’s top club draws, the band signed with independent label 688 Records. The band's first album, Scarred But Smarter, helped them land many tour dates and later a contract with Island Records.[2] In 1987, Lenz left and was replaced by Jeff Sullivan, who was recruited just in time to accompany the band for its first major-label release. Sullivan had been the drummer for Mr. Crowes Garden, which later became The Black Crowes, prior to joining Drivin N Cryin.[2] The same year, the band held its first Benefit For The Hopeful, a concert to raise money for Atlanta homeless organizations, held annually on December 8, the anniversary of John Lennon's death. Fellow Georgia band R.E.M.'s guitar tech and touring rhythm guitarist Buren Fowler joined the trio at this time as well.[3] Fowler was officially asked to join the band on a more permanent level (though not as an official member) in 1988, after many on-stage appearances with the group.\n\nThe band released its first album for Island, Whisper Tames the Lion, produced by Anton Fier, in early 1988.[2] The album peaked at No. 130 on the Billboard 200.[4] College radio success (and some commercial) accumulated with airplay of the songs \"Can't Promise You The World\" (for which the band filmed its first video) and \"Powerhouse.\"\n\n1989 marked the release of Mystery Road,[2] including live staples such as \"Honeysuckle Blue\" and \"Straight To Hell.\" In 1991, the band released the hard-rocking Fly Me Courageous.[2] Produced by Geoff Workman, the album became the band's most commercially successful album and would be certified gold.[5] The next few years the band toured with artists such as Neil Young and Soul Asylum. In 1993, the band released another album produced by Geoff Workman, entitled Smoke,[2] which peaked at No. 95 on the Billboard’s Top 200 album chart.[4] This album was another rocker, but failed to catch on with the public as had its predecessor.[2]\n\nIn 1994, the band decided to move away from the heavy guitar sounds of the previous two records and brought in keyboardist Joey Huffman to replace Buren Fowler. That same year the band left Island Records and found a new home at Geffen Records.[2] The band's first and only Geffen album, 1995's Wrapped in Sky, featured newly added keyboard sounds and a return to the band's original sound.[2]\n\n1997 brought a self-titled album, followed two years later by a live album, The Essential Live Drivin' 'N' Cryin'. In 2000, the band released The Ultimate Collection, a best-of collection. In 2003, the band released a four-song EP, Detroit City Rock, which featured a cover of the Beatles \"Let It Be,\" recorded in New York City on September 13, 2001. The band released its first full studio album in 12 years, The Great American Bubble Factory on September 29, 2009. In 2011, the Georgia General Assembly commended Drivin' N' Cryin' in a house resolution for the band's achievements.[5][6]\n\nStarting in 2012, the band began a series of EPs, each composed of tracks addressing a particular theme. The first, Songs from the Laundromat was released June 12, followed by Songs About Cars, Space and The Ramones on Sept. 18. On March 5, 2013, Songs From The Psychedelic Time Clock was released.[7] The final release of the EP series was Songs For The Turntable, released January 14, 2014.\n\nIn 2012, a documentary about the band titled Scarred but Smarter: Life n Times of Drivin N Cryin was produced.[8]\n\nIn 2015, Drivin N Cryin was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. In 2016 the band supported Dan Baird & Homemade Sin on the UK leg of their European tour and were augmented again by guitarist Warner E. Hodges.\n\nKevn Kinney has also maintained a solo career over the years. He released his first solo album, the acoustic MacDougal Blues in 1990.[2] This was followed by Down Out Law in 1994,[2] and The Flower And The Knife in 2000. The latter featured guests such as Blues Traveler's John Popper, Edwin McCain, and members of Gov't Mule and the Allman Brothers Band. He has released five more solo albums since, and frequently performs live as a solo artist, including live collaborations with Peter Buck of R.E.M.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nScarred but Smarter (October 1986)\n\nWhisper Tames the Lion (June 1988) U.S. Billboard 200 No. 130\n\nMystery Road (March 1989)\n\nFly Me Courageous (January 1991) U.S. No. 90\n\nLive on Fire (EP, March 1991; live tracks from Six Flags Over Georgia)\n\nSmoke (February 1993) U.S. No. 95\n\nWrapped in Sky (August 1995)\n\nDrivin' 'n' Cryin' (August 1997)\n\nEssential Live (September 1999)\n\nUltimate Collection (August 2000)\n\nDetroit City Rock (EP, September 2003)\n\nThe Great American Bubble Factory (September 2009)\n\nSongs from the Laundromat (EP, June 2012)\n\nSongs About Cars, Space and The Ramones (EP, September 2012)\n\nSongs from the Psychedelic Time Clock (EP, March 2013)\n\nSongs for the Turntable (EP, January 2014)\n\nBest of Songs (April 2016)\n\nToo Late to Turn Back Now!
