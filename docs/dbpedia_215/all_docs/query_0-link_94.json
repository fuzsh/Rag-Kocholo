        "text": "Studio albums12Live albums4Compilation albums7Video albums13Music videos61EPs2Singles54B-sides21Box sets1\n\nThe discography of Sheryl Crow, an American singer-songwriter, consists of 12 studio albums, four live albums, two EPs, seven compilation albums, one box set, 54 singles, six promotional singles, 13 video albums, 61 music videos, 21 B-sides and 19 soundtrack contributions. She has sold over 50 million albums worldwide.[1] According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she has sold 16 million certified albums in the United States.[2] Billboard named her the 5th Greatest Alternative Artist of all time.[3]\n\nAfter signing a contract with A&M Records and not wanting to release her own first attempt at a debut record thinking it was unmemorable, Crow finally released Tuesday Night Music Club in 1993. It remains her most successful effort to date and one of the best-selling albums of the 1990s, having sold more than ten million copies internationally by the end of the decade. Such hits as \"All I Wanna Do\", \"Strong Enough\", and \"Can't Cry Anymore\" garnered Crow's popularity on radio, while Tuesday Night Music Club became a Billboard 200 mainstay, rising from the debut spot at number 173 to its peak in the top five and spending exactly 100 weeks on the chart.[4] The album also saw success in countries such as Australia and Canada and throughout Europe. In 1995, Crow won three Grammy Awards (out of five nominations), including for Best New Artist.\n\nHer second album, Sheryl Crow, was released in 1996 and debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard 200, becoming Crow's second consecutive top ten album, spending over a year on the chart and ranking as one of the most sold albums of 1996 and 1997. In less than a year, the album was certified as triple platinum. The album produced five singles: \"If It Makes You Happy\", \"Everyday Is a Winding Road\", \"Hard to Make a Stand\", \"A Change Would Do You Good\", and \"Home\", with the first two peaking at Nos. 10 and 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. The self-titled record remains Crow's most critically acclaimed album to date. Crow won two Grammy Awards for this new effort in 1997 and one additional nomination in 1998. Shortly afterwards, Crow contributed to the Tomorrow Never Dies soundtrack, writing and performing the theme song for the James Bond movie. The song became Crow's fifth top-20 hit in the UK and received nominations for a Golden Globe and a Grammy.\n\nDespite encountering difficulties in recording her third studio album, Crow released The Globe Sessions in 1998. Preceded by the top 20 hit single \"My Favorite Mistake\", the album debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 and went on to sell more than two million copies in the United States. The Globe Sessions received five Grammy Award nominations, including for Album of the Year, but won only for Best Rock Album. The next year, Crow's rendition of the song \"Sweet Child O'Mine\" was included in the Big Daddy soundtrack and won a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. In addition, Crow released her first live album, recorded at Central Park in the company of guest musicians such as Keith Richards, Stevie Nicks, and Eric Clapton. The album was not as commercially successful as its predecessors, being certified as gold only in Canada but at the same time, garnered Crow three fresh Grammy nominations, winning Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for \"There Goes the Neighborhood\" in 2000.\n\nC'mon, C'mon (2002), her following release, debuted at number two in the US, Canada and United Kingdom. The album became her highest debut in several countries and produced the hit single \"Soak Up the Sun\". The album helped Crow win an American Music Award and four Grammy Award nominations. Once again, Crow won Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, this time for the second single \"Steve McQueen\". In 2003, Crow released The Very Best of Sheryl Crow, her first greatest hits compilation. Propelled by the major hit single \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\", the album went on to sell over four million copies in the United States alone, staying inside the Billboard 200 for 80 weeks and becoming 2004's ninth best-selling album.[5] Crow won two American Music Awards the next year in the categories Favorite Rock/Pop Female Artist and Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist.\n\nHer fifth studio album, Wildflower (2005) debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Canadian Albums chart. The album was certified as platinum in less than a year and spawned the single \"Always on Your Side\", which became Crow's ninth Billboard Hot 100 top 40 hit. Wildflower received three Grammy nominations. In 2008, Crow released Detours, her first album in three years. Like its last two predecessors, the album debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, remaining on the chart for over 20 weeks and becoming one of the year's best-sold albums. Her seventh studio album, 100 Miles from Memphis, was released in 2010 and became her last album on A&M Records.\n\nAfter signing with Warner Music Nashville, Crow announced the release of her debut album in the country music format. Her ninth studio album, entitled Feels Like Home, was released September 10, 2013. The lead-off single, \"Easy\", saw release exclusively to country radio and became Crow's first top 20 country airplay hit.[6]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Details Peak
