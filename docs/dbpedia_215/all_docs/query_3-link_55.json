        "text": "They say that critics are just frustrated musicians, but there’s a lot to be said about the inverse as well. No band shows up in 1990 — amid a pop landscape of Madonna, George Michael, and New Kids on the Block, where the most dominant forms of guitar-based music were the glam metal stylings of Bon Jovi and Poison — playing a raucous Rolling Stones/Faces/Joe Cocker throwback and taking Otis Redding to the Top 40 for the first time since the Johnson administration if it’s not commenting on the state of popular music as the ‘80s draw to a close.\n\nSo when Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson kicked off Sunday’s sold-out MGM Music Hall at Fenway show by declaring “Alright, Boston, let’s have a [expletive] rock and roll show!,” that was criticism, directed at the past as well as the present. And the band backed up its arguments with decades-old material that still ripped and cuts from last month’s “Happiness Bastards” that fit snugly next to the classics. If the new songs didn’t hit the same resonances as ones that have had 30-plus years to embed themselves in the audience’s DNA, the immediate dopamine rush they triggered was awfully similar.\n\nThe band came out charging with the new “Bedside Manners,” Stonesy swagger set to a “Dance to the Music” beat, and “Rats and Clowns” sat at the midway point between AC/DC inertia and the high-tension drone of Cheap Trick. Cully Symington’s drums lightly pulled the laid-back “Wanting and Waiting” forward, while the band was more slippery than usual on “Dirty Cold Sun,” even with Erik Deutsch’s bouncy clavinet spiking up the bridge.\n\nThe mix of band-member vintages notwithstanding, the Black Crowes came across not as young and hungry but as mature and in control. They could be patient; the smeary slide guitar opening of “Twice as Hard” led to the band playing with space, letting some chords hang in the air, waiting to resolve. And “Thorn in My Pride” built masterfully from gentle “Let It Bleed” funk to the interplay between Nico Bereciartua’s piercing guitar solo and Rich Robinson’s tight, chunky filigrees to Chris’s vocal ad libs and Symington’s insistent cymbal work. None of it was indulgent. All of it moved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris’s raspy tenor made every lyric sound like it came from a place of urgency, if not desperation, and songs like the sweaty “Sting Me” made it hard to picture him putting more into his vocal as a young man. After throwing themselves into the cockeyed lurch of “Remedy” (including maracas and güiro from the backing vocalists that were essential to the groove), the Black Crowes returned for an encore with “God’s Got It,” swampy gospel blues with a heavy shuffle played with fire, music and music criticism bound together.\n\nBoston trio GA-20 opened with amiable but ambling blues-rock that could have used a sharper focus or attack.\n\nMarc Hirsh can be reached at officialmarc@gmail.com or on Bluesky @spacecitymarc.bsky.social.\n\nTHE BLACK CROWES\n\nWith GA-20.
