Although the bug is exploitable in the context of the PHP Engine, the bug is not in PHP. It is also not directly exploitable remotely.\n\nThe bug is exploitable, if and only if, the PHP application calls iconv functions or filters with user-supplied character sets.\n\nApplications are not vulnerable if:\n\nGlibc security updates from the distribution have been installed.\n\nOr the iconv extension is not loaded.\n\nOr the vulnerable character set has been removed from gconv-modules-extra.conf.\n\nOr the application passes only specifically allowed character sets to iconv.\n\nMoreover, when using a user-supplied character set, it is good practice for applications to accept only specific charsets that have been explicitly allowed by the application. One example of how this can be done is by using an allow-list and the array_search() function to check the encoding before passing it to iconv. For example: array_search($charset, $allowed_list, true)\n\nThere are numerous reports online with titles like \"Mitigating the iconv Vulnerability for PHP (CVE-2024-2961)\" or \"PHP Under Attack\". These titles are misleading as this is not a bug in PHP itself.\n\nIf your PHP application is vulnerable, we first recommend to check if your Linux distribution has already published patched variants of glibc. Debian, CentOS, and others, have already done so, and please upgrade as soon as possible.\n\nOnce an update is available in glibc, updating that package on your Linux machine will be enough to alleviate the issue. You do not need to update PHP, as glibc is a dynamically linked library.\n\nIf your Linux distribution has not published a patched version of glibc, there is no fix for this issue. However, there exists a workaround described in GLIBC Vulnerability on Servers Serving PHP which explains a way on how to remove the problematic character set from glibc. Perform this procedure for every gconv-modules-extra.conf file that is available on your system.\n\nPHP users on Windows are not affected.\n\nTherefore, a new version of PHP will not be released for this vulnerability.\n\n12 Apr 2024\n\nPHP 8.1.28 Released!\n\nThe PHP development team announces the immediate availability of PHP 8.1.28. This is a security release.\n\nAll PHP 8.1 users are encouraged to upgrade to this version.\n\nFor source downloads of PHP 8.1.28 please visit our downloads page, Windows source and binaries can be found on windows.php.net/download/.
