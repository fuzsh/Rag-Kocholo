        "text": "Join Jacky BamBam at midnight on, January 12, 2024, for a double shot of debuts. He’s spinning new tracks from both The Black Crowes and The Black Keys.\n\nThe Black Crowes New Single ‘Wanting and Waiting’\n\n2024 marks 40 years since the inception of The Black Crowes. The Robinson Brothers are claiming this momentous year as their own. Following decades marked by sex, drugs, fights, breakups, and divorce, they are “leaving their BS behind.” The new track will serve as a salute to their past and a celebration of the present and future.\n\nSince The Black Crowes reunited in 2019, they’ve made a triumphant return to form with over 150 shows spanning 20 countries worldwide. Upon their return from the road, they knew they needed something new to show for their lost time. The Robinson Brothers and longtime bassist Sven Pipien headed to the studio with producer Jay Joyce in early 2023 and the experiences of years past transcribed themself through the music as the band found their way back to their roots.\n\nThe Black Keys New Single ‘Beautiful People (Stay High)’\n\nThe Black Keys are going to kick off the new year with their new single “Beautiful People (Stay High)”. It’s written by The Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney with longtime friends Dan “The Automator” Nakamura and Beck. The celebratory, joyful “Beautiful People (Stay High)” features collaborations between the band and various additional friends and colleagues, including Noel Gallagher, Greg Kurstin, and others.\n\nStay Up Late With BamBam\n\nAt 12 a.m. on 1/12, Jacky will spin these new tracks in a celebration of this new year and new music.\n\nRelated:\n\n20 Times Multiple Classic Albums Came Out On The Same Day\n\nThe JACKY BAMBAM SHOW is on 93.3 WMMR Weeknights 7p-12a playing the coolest songs ever made with many features for true music lovers. Jacky is a big supporter of The Philadelphia Mummers and is a Seven Time First Prize Award Winning Hall Of Fame Mummer. Before he took over the microphone, he was a drummer who released 2 albums and toured all over the world."
