        "text": "Haha.\n\nI’d have been up for a covers album if they’d delved into more obscure or hidden gems, rather than iconic standards (I mean, “Rocks Off”, “Moonage Daydream”, “Slider”???) where it’s really hard to add something new (and being the Crowes, I doubt they’ll add that much new), even if it’s not a necessary or fair expectation to improve on the original.\n\nI’ll instead wait - eagerly - for the studio release. Before the Frost / After the Freeze was a terrific late era release IMHO and the Chris Robinson Brotherhood have always had handfuls of terrific originals.\n\nThose songs are iconic for diehard rock fans but to the average listener they're fairly deep cuts. It's not like they're doing \"Bang A Gong\" and \"Brown Sugar.\"\n\nOr \"It's Only Rock & Roll,\" heh.\n\nThey won't pick obscure B-sides and deep cuts because they want to sell a buncha records fast. What'll be funny is when Chris starts slagging the thing shortly after release like when he complained about having to sing Zeppelin covers every night when the Crowes toured with Page.\n\nBut in all seriousness, I hope they make an actual new album.\n\nSame here.\n\nI can’t read the Rolling Stone article, anything interesting in it?\n\nThat has to be the least Black Crowes-looking cover art I’ve ever seen.\n\nWatching that video really made me wish the Black Crowes were still together and working in the studio.\n\nI didn't know this was an ep. I would've been fine with a full release of covers too. They had no problem doing obscure covers back in their heyday, or should I say their peak creative period when they were doing completely different setlists every night. I'll never forget hearing Lucifer Sam in the mid nineties. Is there a regular release coming?\n\nYou know, as fair as it is to criticize the Robinsons for being hypocritical sell-outs, this product doesn't really seem to be something that they're expecting to get lots of money or exposure from. It actually does seem like it was a reason for them to get their feet wet in the studio with the ringers. Maybe I'm wrong, but it could also be in part because they know that no matter what they do, the Black Crowes are not going to sell many copies or get much airplay in the year 2022. I guess if the new album of originals is \"Shake Your Money Maker Redux,\" that will tell if they're really trying to appeal to the mainstream or are actually interested in simply releasing new music.\n\nI think streaming is an Amazon exclusive. You can get the CD and Vinyl at most retailers who still sell those. Bull Moose has both.\n\n- The Black Crowes - 1972\n\n- The Black Crowes - 1972\n\nYes and no. I'm one of those people who was a fan of the first three albums, lost a bit of interest with TSAOC, regained a small bit of interest with BYS (although I was not crazy about the production or the stripped-down arrangements, I did like the songs themselves). But after that, I tuned out again, and I have not heard anything from the band or its members since.\n\nFlash forward to last year. I got a Groupon deal for $20 lawn seats to the SYMM tour, so I went. I really enjoyed the performance and thought the band sounded fantastic. That has somewhat rekindled my interest in the band.\n\nI don't have any plans to check out all of the stuff that I've missed at this point. But if the band I saw performing with Chris & Rich on this last tour does anything new - even a covers album - I'll at least check it out.\n\nSo, in that regard, there may be at least some interest among lapsed fans for a release like this, particularly if it's marketed well. And I can't say that I would be saying the same if I had not seen them put on such a great show last year. YMMV.\n\nThe released cover of Papa Was a Rolling Stone sounds pretty good. Chris is in good voice. The other clips in the video sound nice as well though I agree that Chris's version of the Rocks Off melody isn't may favorite. I like what I'm hearing more than I expected. I really don't like the \"touring our best selling record with a bunch of hired hands\" approach to the past couple of years, but I won't deny good rock n roll when I hear it. The cover of the ep is embarrassingly bad (I know, that's being picky/petty) and I really don't need to hear Chris doing press talking about how punk rock it is to do a legacy tour and release a cover ep. That being said, based on what I heard today, I'll probably buy it."
