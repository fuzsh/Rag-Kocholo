        "text": "Founded in 1948, WHO is the United Nations agency that connects nations, partners and people to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable – so everyone, everywhere can attain the highest level of health.\n\nWHO leads global efforts to expand universal health coverage. We direct and coordinate the world’s response to health emergencies. And we promote healthier lives – from pregnancy care through old age. Our Triple Billion targets outline an ambitious plan for the world to achieve good health for all using science-based policies and programmes.\n\nWHO’s work remains firmly rooted in the basic principles of the right to health and well-being for all people, as outlined in our 1948 Constitution. The World Health Assembly is the decision-making body of WHO and is attended by delegations from all Member States.\n\nWe are committed to the principle of accountability – a core value for an organization that is entrusted by countries and other donors to use limited resources effectively to protect and improve global health."
