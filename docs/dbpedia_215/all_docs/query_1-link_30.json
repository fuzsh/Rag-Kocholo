        "text": "Interesting comment from Rich:\n\nbut his present demand that I must give up my equal share of the band and that our drummer for 28 years and original partner, Steve Gorman, relinquish 100% of his share, reducing him to a salaried employee, is not something I could agree to.\n\nI am wondering if there is more behind that. If it is true, I am not sure why Chris would pull something like that. I really dont know much about the \"big time\"music biz, so what his intentions are.....greed?\n\nI am a fan of the Crowes. Ever since Rich started putting out solo material about 10yrs ago I have been wanting him to keep his solo gig up more. I really like what he does live and what he has been releasing. The last couple of BC albums have been very good no doubt, maybe in a little different direction but definetly of high quality. I miss the swagger and the punch of the more guitar driven music they did. I like Rich's guitar playing. Nice phrasing and melodic riffing.\n\nThis might be it this time....well...for awhile at least. ðŸ˜‰\n\n[Edited on 1/16/2015 by jszfunk]\n\nEveryone has a plan, till you get punched in the face,\n\nBTW - I'm bummed at the news. I started seeing the Black Crowes soon after the first album came out and last saw them with the TTB in Fall 2013. I saw them with lots of axe players in the band: Marc Ford (multiple times in the early 90s), Audley Freed, Marc Ford again, Luther Dickinson and then Jackie Greene (who was a pleasant surprise). I wish I had seen them with Jimmy Page!\n\nI saw them in a club in Buckhead under the name \"Big Gurls\" right before the 2nd album came out. I saw them in Piedmont Park at the Pot Festival in 1992 when 50,000 surprisingly showed...I saw them at the Fox, multiple times at Music Midtown, the Tabernacle multiple times, Lakewood Ampitheatre and the final time at Encore/Verizon Park.\n\nGorman was a powerhouse on the drums and I look forward to seeing him again in Trigger Hippy.\n\nThat's a little disheartening. Especially on a brother to brother family level. I guess it's all about the money with him? Well just my $.02, but I don't intend on supporting CR and his projects. At times I've been turned off by his over the top self absorption. He has always seemed insecure and childish with his sophomoric drug references, We know, we get it, but some blurts must sound cooler in that buzzed little head of his. I love the BC's and accept them as a combined entity and at times in spite of CR . I cringe when he has that forced off color squawk at the end of Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye. WTF was everyone thinking who turned a deaf ear to that pompous ass display of idiocy. I like all the side projects and love the cash cow BC reunions, but it seems greed and ego has spoiled that bi-annual lovefest. It's a Shame. I'm in my 50's and it's getting tougher to motivate my dumbass out to a venue, it makes it mighty easy to skip some acts when you hear some artists do their Robby Robertson impersonations of love and loyalty.\n\nRich is the riff master General. He is to the Crowes what Joe Perry is to Aerosmith. His guitar work has had a nice input in my own playing. I have heard some of his influences and chased down their albums to enlighten myself. He has drenched and expanded the setlists with his sweet versions of The Who (The Seeker), The Grease Band (Let It Be Gone), Song Of Love, Multiple by The Band, The Stone, Neil Young, Bob Dylan to even The Clash?, ahhh it'd take too long to list all the diversity and beauty he brings. I love the guy!\n\nChris brings a groove. No doubt, He brings a level of emotion at times, He also brings a tremendous ego that thinks his vocal range is wider that it actually is. I do not dislike his vocals, but he's not one of fav's either. His voice is adequate, and he does harmonize well with his brother. He needs to stop reading his press releases before bedtime.\n\nSteve Gorman is a great drummer that added to that BC's sound. He may not have had as much writing credits as Rich & CR, but to attempt to shut him out completely is just disrespectful to his long term input, sacrifice, & tolerance. Didn't Jimmy Page in part hand pick the Black Crowes for that Zep material tour because of Gorman's skillset. There are drummers that are just special. Bonham, Moon, Baker, Pert. Etc. They bring a certain dynamic to melody. Their fills are meaningful even if subtle. There are meat and potato drummers who just provide a stable backbone to the music and then there are the ones who command your attention with their influence on the song.\n\nNot really a Crowes fan so I don't understand how ONE brother gained controlling interest in the franchise. Opinions?\n\nI don't think that is the case. From what Rich said, Chris was trying to get controlling interest by having Rich give up his equal share and he refused.\n\nTo me it looks like Chris wanted out so he made super high demands that he knew nobody would agree to and he could always say the others broke the band up since they didn't agree with his demands.\n\nYeah, I get that - but the POWER to make the drummer a salaried employee? Seems like an attempt at a hostel takeover to me!\n\nAs stated - I've just never really been a fan. I've been to three Black Crowes shows (usually to see the opening act) and ended up leaving before the end of their set all three times. Don't know if it's Chris' punk persona (the beer stealing incident gave me a bad impression) or that I just find them over-rated. I loved their take on \"Hard to Handle\" and I liked New Earth Mud. But I find most of Chris' attempts at blue-eyed soul/gospel/blues to be him just trying too hard or something. Like all of these white girl Janis wannabes that just get up there and scream until they're hoarse. Safe to say that I just don't get 'em.\n\nBest of luck to them - good riddance, too!\n\nIt would have been nice to lace em up one more time with the Crowes this summer for the the 25th Anniversary. Whatever it is between the brothers, I've always immensley enjoyed Black Crowes concerts. I've seen ones better than others but like the Mule and ABB, can't seem to think of a bad one among all their various line ups. Just real great Stones style R&R with some jams thrown in.\n\nThose first 3 albums are incredible and the last one recorded at Levon's barn was great. I feel like they only toured those songs once. I saw them in '10 with Luther and 13 with Jackie and they seemed to be focused on pleasing the crowd with the old songs. J\n\nChris is a mini Mick Jagger. Great stage presence, great rock n roll singing and persona but a total doosh. It seems like he pulled a Robbie Robertson and Rich pulled the plug to call his bluff.\n\nJust like Levon in that situation, Gorman seems like the only sane one and the coolest of the bunch. I really liked that radio clip.\n\nDon't be surprised if we see this band again...\n\nI had a great time at the TTB/Crowes in 13 but a Saturday night late summer at Jones beach was only about half full. Kind of lame. I wonder if lower ticket sales factored into Chris's demands...\n\nRusty, the Crowes body of work is incredible. Nobody could touch them during their run ... Nobody. Chris Robinson while coming off as a douche/jerk is one of the premier front men in rock as he is a media dream. He can say something, funny, profound, stupid and outrageous often in the same sentence. The rest of the band can focus on music. They have an uncanny ability to find great guitarists and actually allowing them free rein to solo - a guitar players dream. I've seen them several times as well and found the earlier shows plagued with bad sound (loud, muddy.) However, the last couple of shows have been just great. I believe they're employing some kind acoustic baffles. Also Jeff Gorman is Steve's cousin not his brother and he raises a very good point. Chris Robinson has always had an anticorporate stance. He has passed himself of as some hippy-dippy guru, but this statement from his own brother he is obviously what he has supposedly detested ... A fake, a phony, just another greedy snake oil salesman. The bad part is that his impressive body of work takes a hit in the credibility department. Rich's new CD is great much better than the CRB's latest effort. Like I said I'm tore slap down on this news.\n\nI've seen the Crowes more times than I can count and they've been a huge influence on me musically through the years.....both in songwriting and guitar playing. I'm a big fan. Having said that, I wouldn't be surprised to see them tour again at some point and won't really comment on any of this until Chris speaks to it. I listened to the Gorman thing too and it just made me love the guy more. All 3 of them are irreplaceable aspects of the band.\n\nEven though I love the band and wouldn't be surprised to see them on the road together again at some point, it won't be the same. They're a band that is at it's best 2-3 years into an \"era\" or \"line up\". Saw them probably 4 times with Jackie last year and don't get me wrong, they were great and Jackie fit in well, but they were doing a greatest hits set throughout the whole tour. It was obvious. It also probably had alot to do with not overwhelming Jackie with a huge catalog to have to learn (which is understandable). Marc will never come back to the band and from what it seems neither will Luther, BUT....the line ups with both of those guys once they got into their groove, were just badass. The setlists were deeply varied and the improv at times was just off the charts.....THAT is what The Black Crowes is all about. They gotta marinate a bit.\n\nStill, it sucks to see two of my all time favorite bands wrap it up within months of each other. Piss.\n\nJP"
