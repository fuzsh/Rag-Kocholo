        "text": "1996 single by Counting Crows\n\n\"A Long December\" is a song by American rock band Counting Crows. The ballad is the second single and 13th track from their second album, Recovering the Satellites (1996). Lead singer Adam Duritz was inspired to write the track after his friend was hit by a motorist and injured, making the song about reflecting on tragedy with a positive disposition.\n\nReleased in December 1996, \"A Long December\" peaked at number five on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and number one on the Canadian RPM 100 Hit Tracks chart. In December 1997, the song was re-released in the United Kingdom and reached number 68, six places below its original peak of number 62. American Songwriter magazine named \"A Long December\" the best Counting Crows song in April 2022.[2]\n\nBackground and composition\n\n[edit]\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, lead singer Adam Duritz explained that he was inspired to write \"A Long December\" after one of his friends had been hit by a motorist and was injured. While the song is a reflection on tragedy, it also possesses an optimistic tone. According to Duritz, the song is about \"looking back on your life and seeing changes happening\" while simultaneously looking forward to positive change in the future.[3][4] Musically, \"A Long December\" is an alternative rock ballad.[5][6] The track is composed in the key of F major and written in common time, possessing a tempo of 72 beats per minute.[7]\n\nChart performance\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the United States, \"A Long December\" was ineligible to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 since it was never released as a physical single there, which was a rule at that time.[8] The song instead appeared on the Hot 100 Airplay chart, where it peaked at number six in February 1997 and spent 29 weeks on the chart.[9] On other Billboard rankings, the song entered the top 10 on five of them, reaching number one on the Adult Alternative Songs chart for two weeks.[10] In Canada, the song became a number-one hit for two weeks and was the seventh-most-successful song of 1997.[11][12] On the UK Singles Chart, \"A Long December\" charted twice, peaking at number 62 during its original run in December 1996 and re-entering the listing at number 68 one year later.[13] The single also charted in the Netherlands, reaching number 68, and in Australia, peaking at number 86.[14][15]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nLawrence Carroll directed the music video for \"A Long December\", which features American actress Courteney Cox, whom Duritz was dating at the time. Filmed in Hollywood, California, the video was produced by Victoria Vallas.[16] The clip was first added to MTV, VH1, and The Box on the week ending December 1, 1996.[17] The video, which evokes a somber mood with its images of snow and dull colors, features Duritz playing a piano in the woods and Cox writing a letter in a dark room. Shown throughout the video are scenes of a chalkboard with dates written on it and Counting Crows playing their instruments.[6] Cox eventually leaves the building she is in and walks to a bus stop, clutching her note. Niko Stratis of Spin magazine called the video \"perfect\".[6]\n\nTrack listings\n\n[edit]\n\nAll songs were written by Duritz except where noted. All live tracks were recorded at Elysée Montmartre (Paris, France) on December 9, 1994.\n\nUK CD1; Australian and Japanese CD single[18][19][20]\n\n\"A Long December\" (LP version)\n\n\"Ghost Train\" (live)\n\n\"Sullivan Street\" (live) (Duritz, David Bryson)\n\nUK CD2[21]\n\n\"A Long December\" – 4:55\n\n\"A Murder of One\" (live) (Duritz, Bryson, Matt Malley) – 14:57\n\nEuropean CD single[22]\n\n\"A Long December\" (LP version)\n\n\"Ghost Train\" (live)\n\nCredits and personnel\n\n[edit]\n\nCredits are lifted from the Recovering the Satellites booklet.[23]\n\nStudios\n\nRecorded in late 1996 at The Sound Factory (Hollywood, California)\n\nMixed at River Sound (New York City)\n\nMastered at Gateway Mastering (Portland, Maine, US)\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease history\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Date Format(s) Label(s) Ref.
