        "text": "No doubt you've been told many times by different instructors to NOT use Wikipedia as a source - some may have even threatened to fail you if they see \"wikipedia.org\" anywhere in your references list. But it's hard to pass up such a convenient site! The good news - even though most Wikipedia articles themselves aren't yet considered reliable enough as sources for a research paper, the References and External Links at the END of the articles may still help you.\n\nAs we can see from the pros and cons list, while you don't want to use Wikipedia.org websites as a source for a research paper, the articles may help you get started by providing an easy-to-read introduction of a topic. Even more useful, the articles might have references to sources that ARE acceptable. Just like with an article or book, you can use the sources cited in those materials to help you find more references to use.\n\nFor example, see the below sources from the Wikipedia article on Thermodynamics (Wikipedia, 2019d). You can see that the sources cited include books (with ISBNs), information from college or university websites (ending in .edu), and articles (with DOIs). These are all sources you could safely use in a research paper, all located in one place."
