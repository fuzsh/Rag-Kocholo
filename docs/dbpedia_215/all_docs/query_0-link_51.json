        "text": "American country musician\n\nThis article is about the singer. For the fictional character, see Up in the Air (2009 film).\n\n\"The Dead Horses\" redirects here. For other uses, see Dead Horse (disambiguation).\n\nGeorge Ryan Bingham (born March 31, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist whose music spans multiple genres.[3][4] He is currently based in Los Angeles.[5] As of 2019, Bingham has released six studio albums and one live album, the last four of which were released under his own label, Axster Bingham Records.[6][7][8][9]\n\nOriginally from Hobbs, New Mexico, Bingham grew up across the Southwestern United States. He joined the rodeo circuit as a bull rider in his teens.[10] Bingham learned music on a guitar gifted to him by his mother at age 16, initially playing after rodeos for his friends.[11] Eventually, he began playing in small bars and honky tonks across the West, landing him in Los Angeles. Bingham signed his first record deal with Lost Highway Records (UMG) in 2007.[12]\n\nAfter receiving critical acclaim for his first two studio releases on Lost Highway Records, 2007's Mescalito and 2009's Roadhouse Sun, Bingham went on to collaborate with Grammy-winning producer T Bone Burnett on the soundtrack for the acclaimed 2009 film Crazy Heart, including notably cowriting and performing the film's award-winning theme song, \"The Weary Kind\". The title track earned Bingham an Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and Critics' Choice Award for \"Best Song\" in 2010,[13] as well as a Grammy Award for \"Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media\" in 2011.[14] The Americana Music Association also honored Bingham with the organization's top award in 2010 as \"Artist of the Year\".[15]\n\nBingham's most recent album, American Love Song, was released on February 15, 2019. A ballad from that album, \"Wolves\", was inspired in part by the March For Our Lives students who were dealing with grown men and women questioning their integrity on social media.[16] The song was also featured on the TV series Yellowstone.[17] Bingham sang \"Wolves\" as the series' character, Walker, whom he plays on the show.[18]\n\nIn April 2019, Bingham partnered with Live Nation to launch his own music festival, The Western. The inaugural event took place over two days in Luckenbach, Texas.[19]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nBingham was born in Hobbs, New Mexico. His family relocated to the Midland–Odessa area of West Texas, before eventually moving to Houston. He attended high school primarily in Houston at Westfield High School.\n\nBingham's mother purchased his first guitar when he was 16 years old. Although he was fascinated by music, he left his guitar dormant in his closet. Roughly a year later, Bingham hitchhiked back west to Laredo, Texas, in hopes of landing a job with his father, carrying the guitar with him on the trip. Bingham's father enjoyed having neighbors over on their porch to drink beer, and one of them taught him a classical Mariachi song called \"La Malaguena\" in segments. Though he loved playing the song, it was the only one he would learn during his time in Laredo.\n\nHe relocated to Stephenville, Texas. There, he began learning more music while also riding on the rodeo team at Tarleton State University. It was in Stephenville that he would write arguably his most well-known hit \"Southside of Heaven\" in a trailer house. He also began to play local gigs there, namely a local golf course and a few small bars.\n\nWhile in Stephenville, Bingham had a friend who caught wind of a job in Paris, France, with the Wild West Show at the Disney Resort. He bought a one-way ticket with $100 in his pocket. Upon arrival, he was informed that the manager with whom he had a mutual friend was no longer with the company, and he found himself stranded with his guitar and old rigging bag from his rodeo days. Luckily, he found some friends-of-friends within the Disney programs and began playing music in local parks for tips.\n\nEventually, he saved enough money to get back to Texas and moved in with a rodeo buddy near Fort Worth. His friend had a brother (Matthew \"Papa\" Smith) who cut hair during the day and played drums as a hobby. After an introduction and impromptu gig at an empty bar in Fort Worth, he and Papa would go on to be the founding members of Ryan Bingham and the Dead Horses.[20] Marc Ford of the Black Crowes was one of the few people in the bar that night. He approached Bingham after the gig with an offer to record an album.[21][22]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter issuing self-released \"Wishbone Saloon\" and \"Dead Horses\", the latter distributed by Lone Star Music, Bingham was signed to Lost Highway Records, which issued his first major label debut with Mescalito on October 2, 2007, produced by former Black Crowes guitarist Marc Ford. Texas Music Magazine has opined that Bingham \"talks and sings with a whiskey-and-cigarette throat that screams hard living. Hard in a way that can make a 29-year-old sound like a 50-year-old Tom Waits.\"[23] Bingham spent several years on the rodeo circuit. He began bull riding in his late teens.[24][25]\n\nBingham's former band, The Dead Horses, was composed of Matthew \"Papa\" Smith (drums), Corby Schaub (guitar and mandolin) and Marc Ford's son Elijah (bass). The bass player on Mescalito was Jeb Venable (a.k.a. Jeb Stuart), with Joe Allen credited as well, plus a contribution from John Bazz on upright bass. Bingham appeared with the Drive-by Truckers on Austin City Limits in October 2007. The first single from Mescalito, titled \"Southside of Heaven\", was released on November 30, 2007. The second single was entitled \"Bread and Water\".\n\nOn June 2, 2009, Ryan Bingham and The Dead Horses released their second studio album titled Roadhouse Sun via Lost Highway Records. It was once again produced by Marc Ford.\n\nBingham performed two songs for the soundtrack of the movie Crazy Heart, including \"I Don't Know\" and the theme song, \"The Weary Kind\". The song was co-written by Bingham and producer, T Bone Burnett. Bingham also played a small role in the film. On January 17, 2010, Bingham was awarded the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for \"The Weary Kind\". The song also won the 2010 Academy Award for Best Original Song,[26][27] the 2010 Grammy award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media,[28] as well as Song of the Year at the 9th Annual Americana Music Association awards.[29]\n\nBingham rejoined with his band the Dead Horses to release their third studio album, Junky Star, on August 31, 2010. The album debuted in the Top 20 on the Billboard 200 Chart[30] & in the Top 10 on the Billboard Rock Album Chart,[31] making Junky Star Bingham's highest charting and most successful release to date.\n\nIn 2012, Bingham parted ways with the Dead Horses and record label Lost Highway Records to release his fourth studio album, Tomorrowland, on his own Axster Bingham Records label.[32] Bingham co-produced the album with musician/producer Justin Stanley. The first single released from Tomorrowland was \"Heart of Rhythm\". Both the single and the official lyric video debuted on Americansongwriter.com on July 30, 2012.[33] Bingham's second Tomorrowland single \"Guess Who's Knockin\" debuted on rollingstone.com on September 6, 2012.[34] The official music video for \"Guess Who's Knocking\" premiered on pastmagazine.com October 4, 2012.[35]\n\nIn 2013, Bingham's song \"For Anyone's Sake\" appeared in the closing credits of the feature film Joe, starring Nicolas Cage. Bingham wrote the song for the film, and it was released as part of the film's original soundtrack in April 2014.[36][37] In the same year, Bingham also wrote and recorded \"Until I'm One With You\", the theme song for FX TV drama series The Bridge. The song is Bingham's first screen track since his Academy Award win for best theme song in 2010. \"Until I'm One with You\" was released as a digital single on Bingham's own Axster Bingham Records label on June 25, 2013.[38]\n\nIn 2014, Bingham starred opposite Imogen Poots in the independent film A Country Called Home, directed and co-written by his wife, Anna Axster. Bingham also wrote and recorded the film's title track \"A Country Called Home\". The song was released digitally through Bingham's own label, Axster Bingham Records, on May 6, 2016.[39]\n\nBingham's fifth studio album Fear and Saturday Night was recorded mostly live at Plyrz Studio outside of Los Angeles, California.[40] The album was co-produced by Jim Scott and released through Axster Bingham Records on January 20, 2015. The album's first single \"Radio\" was released on December 9, 2014. In a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Bingham shared, \"'Radio' is a song I wrote about the thoughts, memories, and emotions that roll through my mind. The radio that's constantly playing in your head, night and day.\"[41]\n\nOn August 6, 2016, Bingham recorded his first live album, Ryan Bingham Live, at Whitewater Amphitheater in New Braunfels, Texas. The album was released on October 21, 2016. The entire Whitewater Amphitheater show was also filmed and streamed live by Amazon Music.[42]\n\nBingham released a song titled \"Back By the River\" on The Musical Mojo of Dr. John: A Celebration of Mac and his Music, in 2016.[43]\n\nIn 2018–2020, Bingham has a guest role in the contemporary Western television show, Yellowstone, as Walker, an itinerant ranch hand.[18][44][45]\n\nIn December 2018, Bingham announced that he would be releasing his sixth studio album American Love Song in February 2019.\n\nIn March 2020, Bingham began posting various covers and released songs on his Youtube channel in a series known as the Cantina Sessions throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic, he continued such until the end of 2020.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBingham has appeared as a guest on Bob Harris's Country Show on the BBC's Radio 2. Daryl Easlea, writing for the BBC's folk and country review, said: \"Bingham will be one of the names to drop in 2008, with an album that sounds as if it's been unearthed from 1972.\"[46]\n\nRolling Stone magazine gave Mescalito three out of five stars and wrote that Bingham \"earns his sepia-toned album cover with a dusty wood-and-steel sound, and despite being twenty-five, sings like Steve Earle's dad.\"[47]\n\nPopMatters review of Tomorrowland awarded the album with 8 out of 10 stars. Greg M. Scwartz, writing for PopMatters wrote, that \"The one-time pro rodeo rider turned Texas troubadour has blues, country, and Americana influences that are certainly still there. But at his core, Bingham has always been a rock 'n' roller and Tomorrowland features him rocking at his best.\"[48]\n\nTomorrowland was also reviewed by Nico Isaac from Paste (magazine). Isaac wrote: \"Tomorrowland is like a good, ol' fashioned rock anthem of kiss-my-asschaps autonomy... One thing's for sure Tomorrowland- the album and the red-blooded, rattlesnake-eating rebellious attitude—is no place for the weary kind.\"[32]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nRyan's mother drank herself to death and his father died by suicide. Bingham's \"Never Far Behind\" from his Tomorrowland album is about his parents.[49][50]\n\nHe announced at his performance in Austin, Texas, on March 5, 2015, that he and his wife were expecting their first child in the summer of 2015. Bingham's song \"Broken Heart Tattoo\" from Fear and Saturday Night is a reflection about what he would like to say to his unborn child.[51]\n\nOn June 29, 2021, Bingham filed for divorce from his wife, Anna Axster, after 12 years of marriage. In September 2021, it was revealed that the couple's former Topanga Canyon home was sold for $2.45 million. The home was originally purchased by the couple in 2013 for $1.36 million. Bingham and Axster have three children together.[52][53]\n\nSince April 2023, Bingham and his female fellow Yellowstone co-star Hassie Harrison have been in a relationship. They were married on October 7, 2023.[54]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Album details Peak chart positions US Country\n\n[55] US\n\n[56] US\n\nFolk\n\n[57] US\n\nRock\n\n[58] US\n\nIndie\n\n[59] Mescalito\n\nRelease date: October 2, 2007\n\nLabel: Lost Highway\n\nFormats: LP, CD, music download, streaming\n\n— — — — — Roadhouse Sun\n\nRelease date: June 2, 2009\n\nLabel: Lost Highway\n\nFormats: LP, CD, music download, streaming\n\n17 65 — — — Junky Star\n\nRelease date: August 31, 2010\n\nLabel: Lost Highway\n\nFormats: LP, CD, music download, streaming\n\n2 19 — 8 — Tomorrowland\n\nRelease date: September 18, 2012\n\nLabel: Axster/Bingham\n\nFormats: LP, CD, music download, streaming\n\n7 36 — 16 8 Fear and Saturday Night\n\nRelease date: January 20, 2015\n\nLabel: Axster/Bingham\n\nFormats: LP, CD, music download, streaming\n\n— 47 3 9 7 American Love Song\n\nRelease date: February 15, 2019[60]\n\nLabel: Axster Bingham\n\nFormats: LP, CD, music download, streaming\n\n12 124 4 18 4 \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n\nLive albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Album details Ryan Bingham Live\n\nRelease date: October 21, 2016\n\nLabel: Axster Bingham\n\nFormats: LP, CD, music download, streaming\n\nExtended plays\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Album details Peak positions US Country\n\n[55] iTunes Live: SXSW\n\nRelease date: March 18, 2011\n\nLabel: Lost Highway Records\n\nFormats: CD, music download\n\n64\n\nTitle Album details Peak positions US Country\n\n[55] Watch Out For The Wolf\n\nRelease date: August 11, 2023\n\nLabel: Thirty Tigers\n\nFormats: CD, Vinyl, music download\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year Peak positions Album US Country Digital\n\n[61] US Bubbling\n\n[62] \"Southside of Heaven\" 2007 — — Mescalito \"The Weary Kind\"[63] 2010 11 16 Crazy Heart (soundtrack) \"Depression\" — — Junky Star \"The Wandering\" 2012 — — \"Heart of Rhythm\" — — Tomorrowland \"Until I'm One with You\"[38] 2013 — — — \"Broken Heart Tattoos\"[64] 2014 — — Fear and Saturday Night \"Radio\"[65] — — \"Hands of Time\"[66] 2015 — — \"Wolves”[67] 2018 — — American Love Song \"Jingle and Go\"[68] 2019 — — \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n\nOther charted songs\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year Peak positions Album US Country Digital\n\n[61] \"Hallelujah\"[69] 2010 9 Junky Star\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Video Director 2007 \"Southside of Heaven\" Anna Axster 2008 \"Bread and Water\" 2009 \"Country Roads\" \"Snake Eyes\" 2010 \"The Weary Kind\" Danny Clinch 2012 \"Heart of Rhythm\" Anna Axster 2012 \"Guess Who's Knocking\" 2015 \"Radio\" 2018 \"Wolves” Ryan Bingham\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nFor film roles, he is credited as Ryan Bingham unless otherwise noted.\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2009 Crazy Heart[70] Tony 2015 Jackie & Ryan[70] Cowboy's Brother A Country Called Home[70] Jack credited as composer and actor 2016 Ryan Bingham Live[70] Himself TV special 2017 Hostiles[70] Sergeant Malloy The Life & Songs of Kris Kristofferson[70] Himself TV special Outlaw: Celebrating the Music of Waylon Jennings[70] Himself TV special\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2008–2012 The Tonight Show with Jay Leno[70] Himself 4 episodes; Guest 2009–2010 Late Show with David Letterman[70] Himself 3 episodes; Guest 2012 Good Morning America[70] Himself 1 episode; musical guest 2018–present Yellowstone[70] Walker 23 episodes\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Category Nominated work Result 2010 Best Original Song \"The Weary Kind\" (Shared with T Bone Burnett) Won\n\nYear Category Nominated work Result 2010 Artist of the Year Himself Won\n\nYear Category Nominated work Result 2010 Best Song \"The Weary Kind\" (Shared with T Bone Burnett) Won\n\nYear Category Nominated work Result 2010 Best Original Song \"The Weary Kind\" (Shared with T Bone Burnett) Won\n\nYear Category Nominated work Result 2011 Best Song Written for Visual Media \"The Weary Kind\" (Shared with T Bone Burnett) Won\n\nYear Category Nominated work Result 2009 Best Original Song \"The Weary Kind\" (Shared with T Bone Burnett) Won\n\nYear Category Nominated work Result 2021 Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series Yellowstone Nominated\n\nYear Category Nominated work Result 2010 Best Original Song Written Directly for a Film \"The Weary Kind\" (Shared with T Bone Burnett) Won\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
