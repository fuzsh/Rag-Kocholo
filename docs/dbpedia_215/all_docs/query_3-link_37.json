        "text": "Chris and Rich Robinson, the brother duo behind the Black Crowes, have been circumspect about a new album since announcing a resumption of the band five years ago.\n\nBut last month’s arrival of “Happiness Bastards,” the group’s first album in 15 years (not counting last year’s covers EP “1972”) showed that new music from the reconstituted band was inevitable.\n\n“We had these songs and then I kept writing, y’know,” Rich Robinson, 54, says via Zoom. “Because of (the pandemic), a year and a half kind of plopped in my lap. In typical, nonplanning Black Crowes fashion I was just like, ‘Well … I’m just gonna write,’ and it wasn’t for any purpose. It was just for writing.\n\n“And then it came to the point where the next step would be for us to make a record and, y’know, we had a platform of songs and there were more songs and we decided, ‘OK, now’s a good time.'”\n\n“Happiness Bastards” — “We’re happy, but we’re still bastards,” Robinson says with a laugh — sports 10 tracks and was produced by Nashville-based Jay Joyce, a Grammy Award-winning producer of the year who’s worked with Eric Church, Keith Urban, Little Big Town, Lainey Wilson and many others. Wilson, in fact, guests on the track “Wilted Rose.” The album also allows the Robinsons to show off the latest edition of the band, which includes longtime bassist Sven Pipien, while the other members have been in the lineup mostly since after the group toured in 2021 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its debut album, “Shake Your Money Maker.”\n\n“To me, the excitement of all the new guys brought this sort of new viewpoint to the band,” says Robinson, who along with his brother oversaw the release of a deluxe edition of the Black Crowes’ second album, “The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion,” last December. “Because they’re excited to be there, we’re excited to be there, and so it has all these different moving parts. I think it all felt kind of new and old at the same time, ’cause Chris and I, how we work, has always been the same. It’s never really changed.”\n\nThe Black Crowes perform at 8 p.m. Saturday, April 20 at the Fillmore Detroit, 2115 Woodward Ave. Doors at 7 p.m. 313-961-5451 or thefillmoredetroit.com.\n\nOther music events of note this weekend (all subject to change) include …\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 19\n\n• There’ll be all that jazz at the Fisher Music Center when pianist Kenny Barron and his Quintet plays at 8 p.m. in Orchestra Hall, preceded by Civic Jazz Live! at 7 p.m. in The Cube. 3711 Woodward Ave., Detroit. 313-576-5111 or dso.org.\n\n• The Detroit Symphony Orchestra is in the neighborhoods this weekend to play Mozart, Ravel and more at 8 p.m. tonight at the Meyer Theater in Monroe and 3 p.m. Sunday, April 21, at the Seligman Center in Beverly Hills. 313-576-5111 or dso.org.\n\n• Peter Noone leads the latest incarnation of Herman’s Hermits into something good at 8 p.m. at Andiamo Celebrity Showroom, 7096 E. 14 Mile Road, Warren. 586-268-3200 or andiamoshowroom.com.\n\n• British DJ FuntCase brings his 360 Unleashed show to the Crofoot Ballroom, 1 S.
