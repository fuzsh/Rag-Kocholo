        "text": "There are a growing number of Wikipedia projects, some very active and others quite stagnant. This list is intended as a guideline for those projects so that they will contain a minimum amount of basic, useful information. This way, people will be encouraged to use these projects and help in their growth. The articles should contain at least basic information on the topics they describe, thus providing a starting point for growth besides being a useful reference for the readers. This list provides links to corresponding Wikidata objects, containing links to articles in various Wikipedias which can be used as a translatable resource.\n\nThis list is limited to 1000 articles, but a much larger list is available at List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Expanded.\n\nSection Version 1.1 Current Number Target Number Vital articles Biography 216 204 TBD 115 Philosophy 18 13 TBD 18 Religion 21 22 TBD 37 Social sciences 71 77 TBD 135 Language and literature 43 46 TBD 31 Arts and recreation 73 75 TBD 60 Measurements 19 12 TBD 2 Science 195 257 TBD 293 * Astronomy 22 22 TBD 26 * Biology 118 83 TBD 82 * Health and medicine 34 38 TBD 41 * Chemistry 27 27 TBD 32 * Earth science 21 21 TBD 23 * Physics 36 39 TBD 41 * Mathematics 22 25 TBD 45 Food and agriculture 19 35 TBD 2 Technology 69 67 TBD 98 History 40 46 TBD 83 Geography 148 146 TBD 106 Total 1000 1000 1000 1002\n\nCount checked: 16:05, 20 November 2019 (UTC)\n\nThere are several different ways to use this list. The first is to translate it into the language of your Wikipedia and see whether you have articles on all of these topics. The topics here are linked to corresponding items in the Wikidata project. If your Wikipedia is missing an article, or if you are starting out with a new language, you may want to translate these basic articles from a different language that you are familiar with (for example, English). Language links to Wikipedias in which the topic is covered are provided at the bottom of each Wikidata item page.\n\nIn addition to simply listing the articles, this project hopes to eventually create easily translatable versions of these articles, possibly containing core information at simple:Wikipedia:List of articles all languages should have.\n\nThis list is also used to obtain the List of Wikipedias by sample of articles. Articles which are absent from one wikipedia are shown in List of Wikipedias by sample of articles/Absent Articles.\n\nIt's possible to list the top 1000 most translated (linked) pages in some languages, at Wikidata Terminator; or even compare any two wikis, with Not in the other language.\n\nSince this list is full, it is important that you discuss any changes (adds or deletes) on the discussion for this list first. If you add an entry at this point, it will be necessary to justify deleting something else.\n\nSix versions from the history of this page can be found at Version 1.0 (14 August 2006), Version 1.1 (15 November 2008), Version 1.2 (3 February 2010), Version 1.3 (24 June 2012), Version 1.4 (1 June 2014), and Version 1.5 (6 February 2022).\n\nAbraham\n\nAquinas, Thomas\n\nAugustine of Hippo\n\nBuddha\n\nAl-Ghazali\n\nJesus\n\nLuther, Martin\n\nMoses\n\nMuhammad\n\nNagarjuna\n\nMeasurement\n\nInternational System of Units\n\nKilogram\n\nLitre\n\nMetre\n\nCalendar\n\nGregorian calendar\n\nClock\n\nSecond\n\nDay\n\nYear\n\nTime zone\n\nScience\n\nNature\n\nMetabolism\n\nDigestion\n\nPhotosynthesis\n\nBreathing\n\nEvolution\n\nReproduction\n\nPregnancy\n\nSex\n\nAgriculture\n\nIrrigation\n\nPlough\n\nDomestication\n\nHistory"
