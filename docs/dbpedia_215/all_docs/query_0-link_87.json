Over the course of the event, styles would often include funk, bluegrass, rock, jam band, jazz, reggae, R&B and folk music. Beginning in 1996, GOTV brought many bands to the New England area during the summer season. There existed two main stages which would alternate bands so that festival-goers could experience music all day and into the night. A short stroll down the beach was the \"Green Vibes Stage\", which showcased some of the Northeast's finest talent.\n\nIn addition to music, festival goers had access to food and beverage vendors, a variety of both handmade crafts and imported goods along the \"Craft Vendor Row\" that was known as Shakedown Street, and which was highlighted by and many types of vendors, an Art Gallery, along with Vibes merchandise. The Vibes also showcased non-profit organizations in a Non-Profit \"Village\"[1] with an emphasis on local groups. Information and demonstrations included everything from environmental awareness to social consciousness. Beginning in 1999, The Vibes also hosted an annual non-perishable food and hygiene product drive to benefit a local food bank.\n\nOn November 27, 2015, it was announced that Gathering of the Vibes would not take place in 2016, though it was stated that the festival planned to return in 2017. This did not occur, however, and it appears that 2015 was the last gathering.\n\nFor 30 years, the Grateful Dead were an American musical institution. Born out of a decade of social upheaval and consciousness expanding, the group sparked the creation of an unparalleled sub-culture of loyally devoted enthusiasts. The Grateful Dead inspired thousands of self-proclaimed Deadheads, and Deadheads could record Live tape.[2]\n\nFor decades, Grateful Dead shows served as a community-building institution where followers of the group could revel with friends both old and new. But when Jerry Garcia died in the summer of 1995, many fans were left with a void in their lives. One man who was determined to keep the fire burning was Ken Hays, who at the time ran Terrapin Tapes, a media distribution outlet for live concert tapers and traders.\n\nIn 1996, Sally Ansorge Mulvey and John Dwork (publishers of the Grateful Dead Fanzine \"Dupree's Diamond News\") and Ken Hays (of Terrapin Tapes) threw a memorial party for Garcia at SUNY Purchase. Aptly named \"Deadhead Heaven - A Gathering of the Tribe\", the event provided a forum for music lovers to celebrate the life of the Grateful Dead frontman and reunite for a weekend of spiritual renewal. In 1997, Hays continued the festival and relocated it to Croton Point Park, NY and it was renamed \"Gathering of the Vibes.\"\n\nIn each of the years since, Gathering of the Vibes has carried the spirit of these initial events forward by creating wholly unique musical experiences for attendees from far and wide. The folks who come to the Vibes annually to build and renew their bonds of friendship compose the community that has affectionately become known as the Vibe Tribe.\n\nAfter moving to Plattsburgh, NY for GOTV 1998, the Vibes found what seemed to be a natural home for the annual event at Seaside Park in Bridgeport, CT in 1999 & 2000. In 2000, Bob Weir became the first Grateful Dead alumni to grace the Vibes' stage, performing both with his band Ratdog and in a memorable sit-in with bass virtuoso Les Claypool.\n\nIn 2001, as Seaside Park began to undergo major renovations, the Vibes moved to Red Hook, NY for its most well-attended event to date. Following the year in Red Hook, the Vibes took up a five-year residency at Indian Lookout Country Club in Mariaville, New York from 2002 through 2006, highlighted by a two-night performance by Phil Lesh & Friends over Independence Day weekend 2002.\n\nIn 2007, Gathering of the Vibes came home to Seaside Park, re-kindling the magic of the unforgettable 1999 & 2000 shows. With the help of the Vibe Tribe and the generous support of the City of Bridgeport, Vibes returned to seaside park in 2008 and 2009.\n\nWavy Gravy has been the master of ceremonies since 2002 and shared those duties with Mike Potashnick, GOTVs first production manager, until 2010. In January 2011, Mike Potashnick died and Bob Kennedy, one of the co-founders of GOTV, took his place and shared the emcee duties with Wavy for the festival that year. In 2012, Gordon Taylor, Radio Vibes co-producer, was the co-emcee with Wavy Gravy.[3] Wavy Gravy is a link to the past and one way the Vibes pays homage to its roots.\n\nIn 2012, GOTV took place July 19–22, returning to the site of the 1999, 2000, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 festivals: Seaside Park in Bridgeport, Connecticut.\n\nIn December 2012, Ken Hays announced that GOTV will return to Seaside Park July 25–28, 2013.[4]\n\nSUNY Purchase, Purchase, New York, May 24–26, Originally named \"Deadhead Heaven: A Gathering of the Tribe.\"\n\nArtist Lineup:\n\nJazz Mandolin Project, Max Creek, moe., Ominous Seapods, Somah, Solar Circus, Stone Cold, Strangefolk, Voices of Joy, Zen Tricksters\n\nCroton Point Park, Croton-on-Hudson, New York, Also the name of the festival was changed from Deadhead Heaven to \"The Gathering of The Vibes\"\n\nArtist Lineup:\n\nAgents of Good Roots ~ Charlie Hunter Quartet ~ David Gans & Friends ~ Deep Banana Blackout ~ God Street Wine ~ Hubinger St ~ Jazz Mandolin Project ~ Jeh Kulu Dance & Drum Theater ~ Kevin Hays Trio ~ Laughin' Bones ~ Max Creek ~ Moon Boot Lover ~ New Brown Hat ~ Ominous Seapods ~ Position 17 ~ Percy Hill ~ Strangefolk ~ Warren Haynes ~ Zen Tricksters\n\nJune 19–21 Plattsburgh, New York, 16 miles from the Canada–US border.\n\nArtist Lineup:\n\nConehead Buddah ~ Deep Banana Blackout ~ The Disco Biscuits ~ Ekoostik Hookah ~ Fat Mama ~ Gordon Stone Trio ~ Gov't Mule ~ Jazz Mandolin Project ~ Jeh Kulu Dance & Drum Theater ~ Late night Terrapin Jam ~ Max Creek ~ Michael Ray & The Cosmic Krewe ~ moe. ~ Ominous Seapods ~ Percy Hill ~ South Catherine St. Jug Band ~ Strangefolk ~ Zen Tricksters\n\nJune 18 -
