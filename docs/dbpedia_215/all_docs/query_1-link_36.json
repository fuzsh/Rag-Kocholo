        "text": "At least they didn't release it...\"Sleepyheads\", on the other hand...\n\nWhen I got sent the batch titled Dying From The Cure it didnt have a song with that title.\n\nHonestly, they sound like a bunch of Chris song .\n\nIt Takes One To Know One\n\nRight Where You Want Me\n\nNobody Rides For Free\n\nShow Me What You Can Do\n\nSoft As A Lullaby\n\nSpaces In Between\n\nThat's what I've got too. Most are slight sketches, but I like them.\n\nYeah, I didn't know the name of the song--it just had \"dying from the cure\" in the lyrics. The tune I'm referring to is \"Right Where You Want Me,\" and it's AWFUL!\n\nI don’t think it’s that bad, although undeveloped. Certainly far better than something like Lickin’ or Heavy.\n\nFair enough. I don't take it too seriously, as it's clearly underdeveloped.\n\nFor the record, I'm very generous toward tunes like Lickin, Heavy, Diamond Ring, Ozone Mama, etc. I tend to find something to like in most every Crowes tune.\n\nThere are a handful that I just cannot stand. The riff for Heavy has potential.\n\nThere is an EP of songs that I can put together of 'songs that I skip no matter what'.. maybe 4 or 5?\n\nThe above discussion kind of made me think about something that bugged me about the Crowes from 2007-09 in terms of studio output...\n\nHow much had the balance of power in their writing relationship did Chris have in the mid/late 00's. There's some rocking songs on Before the Frost but it's always seemed (to my ears) that the songs on Warpaint and most of Before the Frost/Until the Freeze greatly reflected Chris Robinson. Just based on the surrounding CR albums (anything CRB, New Earth Mud) whereas Rich's music on his solo records and magpie sound more to the \"rock\" end of the spectrum.\n\nOr am I overthinking this? (probably, lol)\n\nSame. One of Rich's best solos for sure. I don't care if he hates it. I've played it for plenty of people who couldn't care less about TBC and they dug it.\n\nI tend to slightly prefer the CRB version as well.\n\nIt is an early version of I Ain’t Hiding with no chorus vocals and different verse lyrics.\n\nNo idea, but that would explain why I couldn't really connect to much on the last two Crowes records.\n\nIt does seem that Chris took control in that period. It’s also telling that BTF-UTF featured a couple of songs credited only to Chris or Rich for the first time. They must have found it impossible to work together.\n\nhmmm.. . I have heard nussing. I must be nosey now and make a call.. because, well...I love drama lol"
