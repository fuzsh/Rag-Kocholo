I began with a few volumes of smaller tales, among which was Fra hytterne (1887) [From the Cottages]. But the subjects which especially attracted me demanded a more spacious form and a broader style. I turned to the novel, an artistic form which had in former days been neglected and had thus acquired a bad reputation, but which during the nineteenth century had developed and elevated itself to the ranks occupied by drama and the ancient epic. In a trilogy, Det forjaettede land (1891-95) [The Promised Land], Lykke-Per (1898-1904) [Lucky Peter], and (1912-16) [The Kingdom of the Dead], I have attempted to give a continuous picture of the Denmark of today through descriptions of human minds and human fates which reflect the social, religious, and political struggles of the time. Aside from this, over the years I have produced a number of minor and more personal works, wherein imagination has been allowed to play more freely. I mention Ung elskov (1885) [Young Love]\n\nPontoppidan, Henrik\n\nPontoppidan, 1917 By courtesy of the Nobel Foundation, Stockholm (b. July 24, 1857, Fredericia, Den.d. Aug. 21, 1943, Ordrup, near Copenhagen), realist writer who shared with Karl Gjellerup the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1917 for \"his authentic descriptions of present-day life in Denmark.\" Pontoppidan's novels and short storiesinformed with a desire for social progress but despairing, later in his life, of its realizationpresent an unusually comprehensive picture of his country and his epoch. The son of a clergyman, Pontoppidan partly revolted against his environment by studying engineering in Copenhagen in 1873. In 1879 he broke off his studies and became for several years a teacher. His first collection of stories, was published in 1881, and thereafter he supported himself by writing, until 1900 partly as a journalist with various Copenhagen papers.

Z by birthday from the calendar Credits and feedback Henrik Pontoppidan (1857-1943) Danish novelist whose realistic and pessimistic novels depicted the social evils and the miserable situation of the peasant proletariat. Pontoppidan shared with Karl Gjellerup the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1917. Thomas Mann called him \"a born epic poet... a true conservative, who in a breathless world has preserved the grand style in the novel.\" Although Pontoppidan was a sharp critic of modern Danish society, he did not join the ranks of doctrinaire naturalism writers. \"Henrik Pontoppidan characterized himself as a \"popular storyteller.\" This modest self-characterization by an inspired epic writer corresponds to his clear style, which \"de-lyricizes\" language. No other modern Danish author has been able to paint so precisely a complete picture of his time - its intellectual movements and its people.\" (Sven H.
