        "text": "(1857–1919). A Danish poet and novelist, Karl Gjellerup shared the 1917 Nobel prize for literature with his compatriot Henrik Pontoppidan.\n\nThe son of a parson, Karl Adolph Gjellerup was born on June 2, 1857, in Roholte, Denmark. He studied theology, but after coming under the influence of Darwinism and the new radical ideas of the critic Georg Brandes, he thought of himself as an atheist. This atheism, which turned out to be no more than a break with Christianity, was proclaimed in his first book, En Idealist Shildring af Epigonus (1878; An Idealist, A Description of Epigonus), and in his farewell to theology, Germanernes lærling (1882; The Teutons’ Apprentice). The latter, however, indicated the path that was to take him, via German idealist philosophy and Romanticism, back to a conscious search for religion. He eventually became preoccupied with Buddhism and other Eastern religions, represented by two books: Minna (1889), a novel of contemporary Germany, where Gjellerup lived in his later years, and Pilgrimen Kamanita (1906; The Pilgrim Kamanita), an exotic tale of reincarnation set in India. Gjellerup died on Oct. 11, 1919, in Klotzsche, Germany."
