Monday ‚Äì Friday / 10 AM ‚Äì 3 PM

Once upon a time there was a music-obsessed young girl who put in the work to make sure that her career path would revolve around songs, artists and live shows. I certainly have lived the dream and I‚Äôm so fortunate to come back to my favorite radio station to continue the journey. It started in Ocean City in the late 80‚Äôs working at 100 KHI, 96 Rock and 93.5 The Beach. Those were the golden years for me in that there were not many females in radio back then. Stops along the way at 98 Fame in Poughkeepsie and WGTR in Miami led me back to Baltimore to work at 98 Rock as their ‚Äúfull-time part-timer.‚Äù I eventually put down roots at 100.7 The Bay ‚Äì first in mornings with the great Chris Emry and then middays until 2017. I had to step away for an extended ‚Äútime out‚Äù to take care of my Dad in Ocean City. Lucky for me, I stayed in the music biz and got to work with some amazing, fun people at Ocean 98 while I was there. I even moonlighted as a tour guide at Seacrets Distillery which was a blast. I am beyond thrilled to come back HOME and rock the airwaves in the early morning hours at The Bay. When I‚Äôm not doing that you‚Äôll find me practicing yoga, reading rock‚Äôn roll autobiographies, bike riding and/or playing Pickleball or Pictionary. Email me at ccarew@thebayonline.com. Namaste!
