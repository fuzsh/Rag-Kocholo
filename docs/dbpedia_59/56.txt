Univision Bay Area has switched formats of its Uforia Audio Networks station KVVF, from Rhythmic CHR to Latin Rhythmic as Latino Mix 105.7/100.7FM. The station is also accessible using the Uforia app.

“We are thrilled to launch a brand-new format that reflects the diverse tastes of the Latino community in the Bay Area and features today’s hottest artists. Now that our audio portfolio has been reformatted to include the only Latin Rhythmic station in this region, we are better able to give our audience the music they love to listen to, whether they’re at home, at work, or during their daily commute,” said Raul Rodriguez, President and General Manager of Univision Bay Area.

To celebrate the switch over to Latino Mix, KVVF played 67 consecutive hours of Vicente Fernandez’ beloved classic “Volver” and J Balvin’s smash hit “Reggaeton” throughout Labor Day Weekend, with each song played over 700 times each uninterrupted.
