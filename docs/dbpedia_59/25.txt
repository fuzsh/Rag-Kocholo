When presenting my radio station, the first pushback I hear is…” I listen to Sirius or Spotify or Podcasts”. I jump right in and say “great”. Then I say “do you order take out or go out to eat at the same place every time?” I mean pizza is good…but every time? Of course not, there’s pizza night, Chinese night, Mexican and so on. With traffic pattens back to pre Covid and then some, radio night ( and day) is doing just fine and it’s less calories! #100.7thebay. #currentdayHFS

Have you ever struggled to create a social media post? We've been there. On the days when you're feeling uninspired, having content pillars to reference can be a huge help! Content pillars are 3 to 5 topics your brand will consistently discuss, amplify, and create content for on social media. Sometimes they're called "buckets" or "categories." Some examples are of content pillars are: 1️⃣ Informative or educational content This can be short tutorials or behind the scenes in your business. 2️⃣ User-generated content This can be a customer success story, review, or just a plain photo featuring your product. 3️⃣ Promotion or sales content Tell your audience what sales or deals they can get from your website or platform. What have you found that works well with your brand? . . #smallbusiness #marketingbasics #socialmediamanagement
