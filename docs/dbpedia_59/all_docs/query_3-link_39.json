Lots of teens out there who have no clue. Gotta get the new generation hooked and stamp U2's legacy for ALL TIME! A bunch of 40-year-olds who rock harder than ever and beat all the new fads! We want to make sure no other band past, present or future will ever touch U2's success: artistic, commercial, cultural, popular... everything!

It's a national network, can be heard everywhere in Australia and it's very, very influential. If it's popular on Triple J it is therefore 'cool'.\n\nThey have two shows, 'Super Request' which is on weeknights. It's exactly as it says, a request show. Here's the website, there's a link for online requesting a bit of the way down the page.\n\nhttp://abc.net.au/triplej/requests/default.htm\n\nThey also have a Saturday night show called Net 50. It's their weekly countdown from 50 to 1 as judged by online votes. There are a list of songs you can pick from (Vertigo is not on there now, but I'd predict it'll be on there in a few days) but you can also type in any song you want. Website here...\n\nhttp://abc.net.au/triplej/net50/default.htm\n\ncmb737\n\nRefugee\n\nJoined\n\nNov 22, 2000\n\nMessages\n\n1,388\n\nLocation\n\nDenver,CO\n\nHere are the stations in Nashville (very important town in billboard terms)\n\nLightning 100 http://www.wrlt.com/indexa.html\n\n107.5 The River http://www.1075theriver.com/requestform.html\n\n(The above is that horrible clear channel cookie cutter morning idiot station in town...ugh.)\n\nIt has been in average rotation here, suprisingly...sometimes I go weeks without hearing u2.\n\nU2Fan101\n\nRefugee\n\nJoined\n\nNov 4, 2000\n\nMessages\n\n1,197\n\nIn Kansas City we have (from BEST to WORST stations) Meaning, The Planet plays U2 all the time and are more open to playing them than say Mix 93.3.\n\n97.3 The Planet\n\nhttp://www.973theplanet.com\n\n816.576.7973\n\nOnline Request Line - http://973theplanet.com/onair/requestLine.asp\n\n96.5 The Buzz\n\nhttp://www.965thebuzz.com\n\n816.576.7965\n\nMix 93.3\n\nhttp://www.mix93.com\n\n816.576.7093\n\nEmail song request request@mix93.com\n\nThe New E105.1 Retro To Right Now\n\nhttp://www.1051.com\n\n816.576.7105\n\nFor a station that calls themselves \"Retro to Right Now\", I find it odd that they do not and will not add new songs to their playlists anymore. So in a sense, technicall they are not Right Now. They are more like \"Retro to 2000/2001\". Still, they did get Vertigo, and they may only play it like once or twice.\n\nStar 102.1\n\nhttp://www.star102.com\n\n816.576.7102\n\nIt's up in the air as to whether Star 102 did in fact get Vertigo and will play it. It's more of a lighter stations (as they play Beautiful Day, Joshua Tree singles, One, Stay and Walk On). But, I was told from a DJ that they are getting it, so who knows.\n\nInVertigo\n\nBabyface\n\nJoined\n\nSep 23, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n22\n\nSaturday is New York Day!!!!!!\n\nLet's hit New York now.
