K. BOWMAN N. GONIS G. B. DDALESSIO D. OBBINK J. D. THOMAS P. J. PARSONS Aduisory editors General editors PREFACE Section I offers the edition of a single text (5101), which is probably the earliest extant copy of the Septuagint Psalms and of considerable textual interest; several readings correspond more closely to the Masoretic Text than Rahlfs’s edition, and some of them are unique. Another interesting feature is the Tetragrammaton used for the divine name. Section II collects fragments of five hexameter poems. 5102 preserves tantalizing fragments of a Hellenistic mythological poem with echoes of Callimachus and Apollonius Rhodius; its largest fragment depicts Hermes and perhaps Artemis in a pastoral context. If correctly attributed to Dio- nysius’ Bassanca (a precursor of Nonnus’ Dionysiaca), 5103 furnishes a new terminus ante quem for this obscure but influential poet and suggests that he was active earlier than the second century ap. The hand of this papyrus has been identified with that of XXX VII 2818 = SH 940, presumably from the same poem. 9104 and 5105 present further examples of later hexameter narrative, both prominently featuring Aphrodite. In 5105, much the more extensive and surprising of the two, the goddess of love descends to earth to fetch her protégée, none other than Poppaea Sabina, who must reluctantly bid farewell to her husband Nero and take her place among the stars. The continued use of hexameters for purposes other than narrative is exemplified by 5106, a strikingly formulated exhortation to moral purity, grounded in part on the expectation of an afterlife. Section HI publishes a miscellany of documents of the Roman and Byzantine periods. 5111, a puzzling petition of temple personnel, contains several interesting realia. 5114 transmits a new Sev- eran constitution that concerns intervals of relief between successive appointments to honores. 5116 offers the earliest documentary record for Saloninus, nodilissimus Caesar. 5118 is a fragmentary report of proceedings held at a sanctuary of the Nile god. 5119 attests a man from Eleutheropolis in Pales- tine resident in a village of the Oxyrhynchite nome. 5123 provides a rare instance of the Apion estate purchasing wine from two of its colont adscripticit ahead of the harvest, suggesting that the economic relations between the estate and these labourers of controversial status were more complex than is traditionally allowed. Some of the texts edited in sections II and II stem from doctoral theses (A. Benaissa, Oxford; D. Montserrat, R. Hatzilambrou, UCL; J. Yuan, UCLA). Dr Benaissa revised his editions in the first year of a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship, and records his gratitude to the Academy for its sponsorship. Dr Colomo’s work on 5101 was funded by a grant from the Oxford University Grinfield Septuagint Fund. Professor Parsons advised on earlier drafts of items in section Il; more advanced drafts were read by Professor G. B. D’Alessio, Dr E. Magnelli, and Dr M. L. West, whose help we gratefully acknowledge. Professor ‘Thomas read and commented on many of the editions in section III. This volume has benefited immensely from the dedicated input of Dr R.-L. Chang and Dr W. B. Henry, whose combination of learning, skill and efficiency has proved beyond praise. Dr Henry further in- dexed section IH, and co-ordinated the correction of the proofs. Dr M. Langellotti indexed section HI. As always, we are grateful to Dr Jeffrey Dean for his expert copy-editing and typesetting, and to The Charlesworth Group for rapid production; and we remain indebted to the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the British Academy for their very generous support.

It may be summarized as follows: [aby] ‘ay’ (aBy) {aBy} The letters are doubtful, either because of damage or because they are otherwise difficult to read Approximately three letters remain unread by the editor The letters are lost, but restored from a parallel or by conjecture Approximately three letters are lost Round brackets indicate the resolution of an abbreviation or a symbol, e.g. (ap7aBy) represents the symbol ~, crp(aryyéc) represents the ab- breviation crp§ The letters are deleted in the papyrus The letters are added above the line The letters are added by the editor The letters are regarded as mistaken and rejected by the editor Bold arabic numerals refer to papyri printed in the volumes of The Oxyrhynchus Papyri. The abbreviations used are in the main identical with those in J. F Oates et al., Checklist of Editions of Greek Papyri and Ostraca (BASP Suppl. no. 9, °2001); for a more up-to-date ver- sion of the Checklist, see http ://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/papyrus/texts/clist.html.

LXX, Psatms xxvi 9—14, xLiv 4-8, xLvn 13-15, XLVI 6-21, SLX 2-16, LXnT 6 — LxIV 5 A and C: 27 3B.41/J(1-2)c; A 6.1 x 5.1 cm First/second century B: 20 3B.36/J(4)b; D: 27 3B.38/N(1)b Rahlfs 2227 Plates IU Four stretches of text (designated as AD) giving parts of six columns of a pa- pytus roll. The back is blank. The preserved height in section C is i792 cm) Elis figure includes upper margin preserved to a depth of 1.4 cm and lower preserved to a depth of 1.2 cm; if an addition to C iii by a second hand is discounted, the figure for the lower margin rises to 1.5 cm. The intercolumnium between C ii and iii will have been 1 cm wide at its narrowest. C iii will have had 37 (originally 36?) lines, C li 39 (or possibly 38). The text is written in a small informal round hand of a common type with some ligatures and cursive features: we find for example € with cap and cross- stroke made without lifting the pen (e.g. D 11, 12), and a joined to the following letter by its second oblique (C iii 17), while 8 (e.g. C iii 20) is regularly made in three movements: upright, horizontal base projecting to the right, and the loops added as a single sinusoid. The awkwardness of the script recalls that of other literary and documentary hands of the earlier Roman period, but it is of uncertain value as a dating criterion, since it may merely indicate the scribe’s lack of proficiency. Comparable dated hands include those of XLV 3264 (80-81), XLI 2957 (91), and XXXVI 2754 (111), though none of these is particularly close. This is probably the earliest extant copy of the Septuagint Psalms. The list in Rahlfs—Fraenkel, Verzeichnis der griechischen Handschriften des Alten Testaments i.1 {hereaf- ter Ra], p. 489, has at its head two copies assigned to the second century, the scrap P. Monts./II inv. 2 (Ra 2160, p. 247), and P. Ant. I 7 (Ra 2077, pp. 283-4), which was assigned by its editor to the second century, but by Turner to the second/third. The name of God 1s represented by the Tetragrammaton, written in archaic Hebrew characters, at A 12 and 14 and D 14. The practice is recorded by Origen, Selecta in Psalmos 2.2 (PG 12.1104B), and attested in some Septuagint manuscripts (A 12 n.). This, along with the absence of the Christian nomina sacra and the choice of roll rather than codex form, may be thought to suggest a Jewish origin for the roll: see C. H. Roberts, Manuscnpt, Society and Belief in Early Christian Egypt (1979) 74-8; C. H. Roberts and T. C. Skeat, The Birth of the Codex (1983) 38-40; L. Hur- tado, The Earliest Christian Artifacts (2006) 5-6, 17-20, 55-9 (on possible Christian rolls). he informality of the hand, suggesting a copy made for private use, need not be an obstacle to this hypothesis: cf. L 3522, Job (Ra 857, p. 304), papyrus roll, 2 SEPT UAGINT ist cent.; LXV 4443, Esther (Ra 996, pp. 305-6), papyrus roll, 1st/2nd cent. See in general E. J. Epp, “The Jews and the Jewish Community in Oxyrhynchus: Socio- Religious Context for the New Testament Papyri’, in T. J. Kraus and 'T. Nicklas (eds.), New Testament Manuscripts (2006) 13-52. Other theological papyri found at about the same time as the present manu- script are LXTV 4404 (inv. 27 3B.38/N(1)a; late second cent.) and LXIV 4401 (inv. 27 3B.41/C(1-3)b; third cent.), both from papyrus codices of Matthew; but there is no particular reason to suppose that they are associated with it in any way. An abbreviation (re“ for 7éAoc) is found in a superscription at D 13. Organic diaereses occur at C ii 23, 27, 11 18, and perhaps iii 14, and D 5 (the last three word- initial), inorganic at D 17. A paragraphus was probably used at the end of a psalm at D 13; the following psalm’s superscription is indented. The traditional division into stichs is reflected by the line-divisions to some extent. When a stich ends in mid-line, this is sometimes but not consistently indicated by a dicolon. The dicolon is not attested at line end. Other Psalms manuscripts including the dicolon are PUG [1 (Ra 2157, p. 129; 3rd/4th cent., papyrus codex); P. Duke inv. 740 (Ra 2198, pp. 110-11; early 4th cent., papyrus codex); P. Bodm. XXIV (Ra 2110, pp. 58-61; grd/4th cent., papyrus codex); XI 1352 (Ra 954, p. 299; early 4th cent., parchment codex); PSI VIL 980 (Ra 2055, pp. 118-19; 3rd/4th cent., papyrus codex); LX XII 4931 (5th cent., miniature papyrus codex). In all these, the dicolon is accompanied by a blank space, which usually follows. (In PSI 980 the dicolon is both preceded and followed by blank space.) Cf. E. Tov, Scribal Practices and Approaches Reflected in the Texts Found in the fudean Desert (2004) 139-40, 311-13. The papyrus is of considerable textual interest. It has several readings that correspond more closely to the Masoretic Text (MT) than does Rahlfs’s edition, some of which are unique: see especially C 11 25, 36, iti 10, 19, and 22-3 (also B 6, C ii 16, 23 (?), D 13, 15, 16). But it also has unique and interesting readings that do not correspond to MT: see C iii 20, 27, D 14 (also C i 16, 28, ii 29). Albert Pietersma offers the following assessment: On balance nothing impresses me more about 5101 than its early date and its thoroughly Septuagintal character, notwithstanding its sole re- censional trait, namely, the replacement of «vpioc by the tetragram in palaeo-Hebrew script. (Thus when xvpvioc is marked for case with an article, typically due to the Septuagint’s isomorphic representation of the source text, the grammatical role of the tetragram is clear, but when it is not so marked, the role of tetragram becomes unclear or ambiguous.) For the rest, one finds fewer than a dozen sporadic alignments with the Masoretic ‘Text against Rahlfs’ edition, uniquely or in the company of other witnesses, and a somewhat higher number of variants that deviate from both Rahlfs and the MT. Notable for its support of 5101 in both o10L LXX, PSALMS (FRAGMENTS) 3 categories is 2110 (P. Bodmer XXIV), a 3rd/ 4th-century papyrus well known for its substantial contribution to the pristine text of the Greek Psalter. Some of the alignments of 5101 with the MT are certainly original but just how many remains to be assessed. The nomina sacra are absent, indicative inter alia of its Jewish rather than Christian provenance. Not surprising is that, in the one pertinent instance (Ixiv 4) in which Rahltfs adopts a conjecture by Grabe against the extant evidence, 5101 sides with all other Septuagint manuscripts. The pre-Origenian date of 5101 makes it possible that Origen used this text as one of his sources for readings closer to the Hebrew than the majority Septuagint tradition, to be adopted in his fifth column. For a general account of the textual criticism of the Old Greek Psalter, see Pietersma in A. Aejmelaeus and U. Quast (eds.), Der Septuaginta-Psalter und seine Toch- tertibersetzungen (2000) 12-32. There are occasional itacistic spellings and mechanical copying errors, for which the commentary may be consulted. The text has been collated with A. Rahlfs, Psalmi cum Odis (1967). R. Hol- mes and J. Parsons, Vetus Testamentum graecum iii (1823), and P. de Lagarde, Psalterii graect quinquagena prima (1892), have also been used. Origen’s Hexapla is cited from F. Field, Ongenis Hexaplorum quae supersunt ii (1875), with further information taken from G. Mercati, Psalteru Hexapli reliquiae, Pars prima: Codex rescriptus (1958). The early Psalms manuscripts not available to Rahlfs overlapping 5101 (cited by their numbers in Rahlfs—Fraenkel’s Verzeichnis) are: Cairo, Coptic Museum inv. 3855+3857+3859+3865 (Ra 2015, pp. 165-6; van Haelst 137), Ps xxxii 10-11, xlvi 10— xlvii 2, xlviii 12-20, ciii 25°-35 in Greek, 5th/6th or roth/rith cent., Greek—Coptic parchment codex; P. Chester Beatty XIV (Ra 2150, pp. 105-6), Ps ii 1-8, xxvi 1-6, 8-14, xxxi 8-11, 4th cent., papyrus codex; P. Bodmer XXIV (Ra 2110, pp. 58-61; van Haelst 118), Ps xvii 45°— xviii 44” with lacunae, 2nd/3rd cent., papyrus codex; Bodl.

I 3 (Ra 1250, pp. 332-3), roth/11th cent., liturgical roll on paper; Ps xlix 1-2 by P. Vindob. G 29435 (Ra 2215, pp. 414~-15), 5th/6th cent., papyrus sheet including other OT quotations; Ps xlix 1*~7 by P. Ross.-Georg, I 1 (Ra 2069, p. 369; van Haelst 152), 6th cent., papyrus sheet; Ps xlix 3~7 by T. Mil. Vogl. inv. 3 (Ra 2223, p. 233), 6th cent., wooden tablet (unpublished); Ps xlix 17-3! is transmit- ted as part of a hymn to the Virgin Mary in P. Brit. Mus. EA 74114 (Ra pp. 227-8), 1oth/11th cent., from a parchment codex probably for liturgical use; and P. Vindob. G 27290 A (Ra 2085, pp. 412-13), 6th cent., papyrus sheet, probably an amulet, includes a quotation of the opening of Ps Ixiv 2. The original work on sections A and Cis due to D. Colomo, who acknowledges 4 SEPTUAGINT valuable comments from R. A. Coles, J. R. Rea, and J. D. Thomas. At the last mo- ment, W. B. Henry identified and contributed editions of the remaining fragments, and undertook the revision of the whole. L. Cuppi gave helpful advice. The edition has been greatly improved by the comments and criticisms of A. Pietersma. In the transcription, sublinear dots are applied in the usual way to uncertainly read letters both in Greek and in Hebrew. The supplements printed are largely exempli gratia, and textual points on which the new evidence sheds no light are not discussed. Variant readings are not generally discussed where the text agrees with Rahlfs’s edition.

Perhaps a space was left blank for the Tetragrammaton to be inserted later, as in P. Fouad inv. 266 (see 12 n.), though the Tetragram- maton at D 14 at least fits its space well enough to suggest that it may have been written together with the rest of the text. Another possibility is that an earlier copy had left a space of this kind, and that our roll is descended from that copy. The text without xvpiov makes sense, and a scribe might well have forgotten to insert the Tetragrammaton. It is also possible that traces have been lost through abrasion as elsewhere in this scrap. SIOL LXX, PSALMS (FRAGMENTS) i) 12 vmo0|evovtwy: vropewor is the usual reading as in Rahlfs’s text: U (daopévw) and Sa\" (ézro- eve) offer variants. The reading here may be due to the influence of the preceding Cwvrwy. Of the Tetragrammaton only the final he is preserved complete here, but a better preserved specimen is found at D 14. Palaeo-Hebrew characters are used. See in general Toy, Scribal Practices 218, 220, 238-46. This type of Tetragrammaton is preserved in the following Greek manuscripts: (a) P. Vindob. G 39777 (Ra p. 428; van Haelst 167; Ps lxix—Ixxxi in Symmachus’ translation (= LXX Ps Ixviii-Ixxx); parchment roll, grd/4th cent., from the Fayum or Heracleopolite); (6) 8HevXIIegr.

Tov, Scribal Practices 365 fig. 27 (cf. 241) shows an example similar in shape to that found in this manuscript, but the scribe of our roll has assimilated the initial yod to the he by giving it a third bar, suggesting that he was not familiar with palaeo-Hebrew letters. It is possible but by no means guaranteed that the preserved instances of the Tetragrammaton in this papyrus were written together with the Greek text. 14 The text is uncertain at the start.

Mercati xxiv), and Origen’s fifth column and Quinta as given by 1098. Rahlfs adopts Grabe’s conjecture exomacev (in agreement with MT), and either reading could be made to suit the space, but since the papyrus fails to confirm Grabe’s conjecture at lxiv 4 (D 17 below), there is some reason to suppose that it had the same as other manuscripts here too. g-10 10° occupied two lines as in R”. 10-12 The supplements printed and line-breaks are purely exempli gratia. Possibly the «av re- stored from Rahlfs’s text at the end of 11 was omitted (with La®). 15 ovowja restored as in 2110 on grounds of spacing: 2013 has to ovowa, other copies ta ovo- peara (so Rahlfs). 16 The avtwy printed by Rahlfs after yawwv at the end of 12* was apparently absent as in 2110 1098 (not Ga) L Tht? in agreement with MT. This avtwy was present in Theodotion but not in Origen’s fifth column, Aquila, Symmachus, or Quinta according to the evidence of 1175 and 1098 (cf. Mercati xxiv).

Quinta, however, is said to have read operat. After 37, there is space for two further lines (if it is assumed that the final line of col. 111 is a mar- ginal addition), enough for the conclusion of the Psalm. 21” may then (but need not) have been split over two lines, although the identical 13” was written in one (17). col. 11 ek Celiwv 7 ev|mpem[era THC WpatoTnToc avTou| xlix 2 0 Geoc eul[davlwc n€e[e] 0 Gelo|c yluwly Kar ov [mapacuewmncerat| 3 Tup ev[wr|cov avtolu KavOncerat| 5 Kat KuK[Aw autjouv Ka[tauyic chodpa] mplockadece|rat Tov ov[pavov avw Kat THY yyv| 4 [dva]Kpwvar Tov Aaov a[vtov] cuvayeTe auTw Tov[c ocLouc avTou| 5 Touc b1abiepevouc [tHv diaOyKnv avtov] 10 em Oucia Kau [a]vayyedAlovciv] 5-6 [or] ovpavor tyy dixarlocuvny avrou| [o]r[c] A[eoc] Kpitnc e[c7w draxsadua] [axouco]v Aao[c pou Kat AJaAy[cw cor] ; Icpa[mr Kae diapalpruplo]upar cov 15 o Geoc o Ge[oc clou eure e[yo] ovk ev Tatc [Bu]ciacc clo]v edeyEw ce 8 Ta de oAoKavTw@pa cov evwmuov [wou] icw da travtoc [:] ov de]Eouar €[K Tov oxo] 8-9 COU KLOCYXOV : o[vde €K Twp Troyrv| cwv cou| S101.

Taylor (ed.), X Congress of the International Organization of Septuagint and Cognate Studies, Oslo, 1998 (2001) 118-20, argues for its absence from the original form of the Greek text. 14 The Tetragrammaton (A 12 n.) precedes vvoc. Other Greek manuscripts have instead o Geoc (corresponding to MT Elohim) after vuvoc as in Rahlfs; so too Origen’s fifth column and Aquila as reconstructed (Field). Cevwy spelt as in C 111. 15 The x of evy7 has an extended gently descending tail attached to its second upright, with blank papyrus above, suggesting that it was the last letter of the line: contrast the earlier in the line. The manuscript will then have lacked ev [epoucaAyp as printed by Rahlfs at the end of the stich: B’ and 2110 also lack the phrase, in agreement with MT. However, this is not quite certain. The second 4 in C in 34 has a fairly comparable, though not identical, tail (before 7), as does the H in C iii 12 (before c). 16 3'* are run together as in La® and T. The pov following zpocevync in other copies and in Rahlfs’s text, for which Sa has yyw, is absent in this copy, as in S* R Ga (not the Vulgate) 55 2110, in agreement with MT. Origen’s fifth column included the pov, while Aquila and Quinta as known from the Syrohexapla had something quite different (6 efcaxovwy mpocevync Ewe acne capKoc HEEL). 17 avouwv: Grabe’s dvouidy (= Aquila, Symmachus; adopted by Rahlfs) not confirmed.

D. GOLOMO W. B. HENRY Il. HEXAMETERS 5102. HELLENIsTIG(?) HEXAMETERS 88/262 (fr. 11: 5B.89/G) FiaK Unc Orci Early third century Plates [V-VII Over sixty fragments, mostly scraps, from a papyrus roll preserving hexame- ters of uncertain mythical content, probably of the Hellenistic period. The writing runs along the fibres and the back is blank. Margins are extant in a number of frag- ments: the lower margin measures 4 cm at its greatest extent (fr. 12), the upper 2.8 cm (fr. 2), while the intercolumnium ranges from 1.4 cm (fr. 3) to 2.7 cm (fr. 4). After the two largest pieces (frr. 1-2), the fragments are printed in the following order: frr. 3-5 significant fragments with a left margin or intercolumnium; frr. 6—7 significant fragments with no margins; frr. 8-11 significant fragments with a right margin; frr. 12-13 significant fragments with a lower margin; frr. 14-32 smaller fragments; frr. 33-62 scraps in which no word can be read with any certainty. The papyrus is written in a specimen of the ‘Severe’ or ‘Formal Mixed’ style. The hand, slanting slightly to the right, is of fair size, not quite bilinear, and undec- orated. Broad letters such as h, kK, M, N, TT, T, and w contrast markedly with narrow and oval-shaped €, ©, p, and c. ‘Triangular a has a sharp nose. In the apices of A, A, and A, the right-hand oblique projects above the left-hand one. The horizontal mid-stroke of € extends beyond the short cap and base of the letter. H has a high horizontal bar. The bow of m has the shape of an arc suspended high between the parallel vertical strokes. As a result of the right slant of the writing, the second leg of N, and sometimes of u, M, and Tr, is shorter and begins at a higher plane than the first. 3 is cursive. O is often small and gives the impression of floating between other letters. y has a V-shaped cup and a long tail. The centre of o is either flat or has only a slight bump, the letter’s arms leaning inwards (the left arm in a more angular fashion than the right one). For the placement of the hand in the first half of the third century, compare XVII 2098 (GLH 1gb, with a land survey assigned to the reign of Gallienus on its back), VI 1012 (written on the back of an official account (VI 1045) from the reign of Septimius Severus), I 23 (with a consular date of 295 on its back). The original scribe does not seem to have written lectional signs, except perhaps for diaereses, which are otherwise difficult to assign to a particular hand, but are generally believed to count ‘as part of the text and [to be] written by the _ original hand’ (GMAW* pp. 10-11). They appear above iota and are used both organically (frr. 1.16, 12.2, 21.3) and inorganically (frr. 14.6, 15.4[?], 48.2; uncertain use: frr. 25.1, 33.3). The scribe usually effects elision (though cf. fr. 15.4 n.), but does 9102. HELLENISTIC(?) HEXAMETERS ies not mark it. A second hand, which is also responsible for corrections (see below), added some accents (acute: frr. 2.9, 5.12 (see palaeographical note), 21.3, 52.2; cir- cumflex: fr. 2.9), a rough breathing in Turner’s Form 1 (fr. 2.9), and frequent high stops (above the line of writing except at line end). The writing of iota adscript (not consistent: cf. e.g. fr. 5.2) is also due to this second hand, as it is clearly squeezed between letters (frr. 2.4, 7, 4 ii.12; at the end of the verse in frr. 203, 31.201. also fr. 26.4 |cnec[, where the iota belongs to the first hand, but the division of words is uncertain). ‘Two critical signs, a diagonal stroke and an antisigma, appear in the left margin opposite fr. 4 ii.8, but their precise import at this point is unclear (see n. for a possibility). Their presence at least indicates that the text of the papyrus was valued highly enough to receive scholarly attention. There also seems to be a para- graphus below fr. 27.4 (see palaeographical note). ‘Maas’ Law’ is observable in frr. 3 col. n and 4 col. ii, and the left margin of fr. 3 col. ii contains four dots (below 4, 6, and opposite 10, 12), probably ruling marks; on this scribal practice and its relation to ‘Maas’s Law’, see W. A. Johnson, Bookrolls and Scribes in Oxyrhynchus (2004) 91-99. The second hand that penned the majority of the lectional signs also made a number of corrections and additions to the text (one correction might be due to the original scribe; see fr. 6.4 n.). They include addition of movable v to avoid hia- tus (fr. 1.15), addition of missing letters (frr. 25.4, 34.6), correction of an unmetrical form (fr. 4 11.4 Apna > Apea), and correction of phonetic spellings (fr. 1.11 7 > db; frr. 15.4[?], 33-3 « > 0). The corrections in fr. 18.2, 5 are uncertain. The drastic cor- rection in fr. 1.12 conceals a serious corruption in the line and may be a conjecture (see n.). Corrected letters are generally deleted by a diagonal or horizontal stroke and the correction inserted above the line. In fr. 1.12, however, ¢ is corrected from 7 by closing the bottom of 1 and adding a tall vertical through its centre. Two io- tacistic spellings were left uncorrected: frr. 1.16 io(e)idéc, 3 11.10 pfetupe [. The contents of the fragments are not transparent, especially since not a sin- gle line is completely preserved or certainly restorable. They presumably relate to one poem, but nothing excludes the possibility that they represent several smaller poems or epyllia. The largest fragment (fr. 1) seems to be set in a mythical pasto- ral context: someone reaches a flock (8 yz#Aa); either he/she, or the flock, turns about here and there (9); a female subject is mentioned (10); something happens ‘unexpectedly’ (11); the female members of the flock are beside a craOudc (12-13); then there is mention of Artemis in the genitive, a fragrance (of the goddess? of burnt sacrifice?) emanating from, or from near, a cave (14-15), and the surging water of a spring (16), typical elements of a locus amoenus; the last line mentions ‘wily Hermes’ (17) if one restores do]Adpun[ti]v . . . Epu[awva (but see below for an alternative restoration). Given that Hermes’ name appears in the accusative and is accompanied by a seemingly pregnant epithet, he is probably an active par- ticipant in the passage. His appearance in a pastoral context is appropriate given his strong connections with flocks and shepherding (see fr. 1.17 n.). The epithet 14 HEXAMETERS SoAdpnric, moreover, if it is not merely ornamental, suggests that the god appears in this passage in his archetypal role of trickster. There cannot be any reference to Hermes’ famous rustling of Apollo’s cattle, for the latter cannot be designated as ujAa, a term usually reserved for flocks of sheep and goats (see 8 n.). The mention of Artemis in this pastoral setting is more surprising, since it does not suit prima facie this goddess of the hunt and the wild. The genitive Ap[r]éuw60c (14), however, does not necessarily imply that the goddess herself is present in this scene, for it could refer to something belonging to Artemis (the cave, the spring, or an altar, restoring e.g. Bapoc 5’) Ap[r]éucdoc Avderc avtpo.o 7[aporev) or a companion of the goddess. The female figure concealed by the participle ending |evy at 10 may or may not be Artemis. The only myth known to me that involves Hermes and Artemis in a pastoral context is the one told by Antoninus Liberalis, Metapopdacewy Cuvaywyn 15, and attributed in a marginal manchette to the first book of the Ormithogonia by the Hel- lenistic pseudonymous poet ‘Boeus’. The story relates the punishment of the three impious and misanthropic children of Eumelus by Athena, Artemis, and Hermes, who visit them at night, A@nva pev Kal Aprepuc eovxviar Kopaic, Epync de tomevoc éywv croAny (15.3), and transform them into various birds. No part of Antoninus Liberalis’ summary, however, can be specifically mapped onto fr. 1, and the absence of Athena from this and the other fragments causes difficulty. A more promising avenue, albeit far from certain, is suggested by the word beginning dpvof in fr. 1.13. It brings to mind a vid who may have figured in one of Hermes’ numerous erotic adventures (for a list of these, see S. Eitrem, RE VIL 774). The Homeric Hymn to Pan (h. Hom. 19.28—47) tells how Hermes visits Cyllene in Arcadia (éc Apxadinv roduTidaka untépa u7jAwyv) in the guise of a shepherd (6 ye kal Bedc wv padapotprya wHA’ evopevev / avdpi mapa Ovynr@) in order to win over the daughter of Dryops. He succeeds and their union results in the birth of Pan. This nymph, who is not explicitly named in the hymn, is usually understood to be the literary ancestor of Apuozm7n in Nicander fr. 41 Schn. (= Ant. Lib. 32, from Book 1 of the Heterotoumena) and Ovid Met. 9.324-93 (cf. also Virg. Aen. 10.551: Dryope . . . nympha is mother of ‘Tarquitus by Faunus, who was identified with Pan). In Nicander, Dryope is the name of Dryops’s daughter. The story concerns the nymph’s relationship with Apollo rather than Hermes, but it is still set in a pastoral context, for Dryope is represented as a shepherdess turned nymph (Ovid’s version is even more divergent). If my suggestion is accepted, our poet may have presented a developed account of the story of the Homeric Hymn, perhaps representing the daughter of Dryops/Dryope as a companion of Artemis; cf. //. 16.180-86 (Hermes falls in love and sleeps with a mortal dance companion of Artemis with the pas- torally evocative name of [JoAvunAn) and h. Ven. 117-21 (Aphrodite pretends that she was a mortal woman snatched by Hermes €x yopot Apréudoc from amongst a group of nymphs and maidens). ‘The cave and spring would be an appropriate 3102. HELLENISTIC(?) HEXAMETERS 15 backdrop for such a scenario; for the literary and mythological associations be- tween nymphs, pastoralism, caves, and springs, see J. Larson, Greek Nymphs: Myth, Cult, Lore (2001) 5, 9-10, 24, 26-7, 50, 78ff., g6 ff. (note that Hermes is represented as sleeping with tree nymphs puy@ crelwv epoevtwy in h. Ven. 262-3; for Artemis and the nymphs, see Larson, op. cit. 107 ff.). I have not been able, however, to offer a fully satisfactory reconstruction of the lines under this hypothesis, and it is equally possible that dpvo[ simply represents the genitive of Spuc, ie. dpvo|c, or, less plausi- bly, the uncommon adjective Spudecc, -devroc (found only in the spurious Homeric line Zl. 2.783a, Hesych. 8 2426 Latte, and Nonnus). A third possibility, suggested by Professor Giambattista D’ Alessio, is that 50A6- pnt in 17 refers not to Hermes himself (S0]Aduy[re]v . . . Epp[awva), ‘but to one of his sons (supplementing ‘Epyeiao at the end of the line and with some equivalent of maida or vidv to be accommodated perhaps at the beginning of the line), e.g. Autolykos, or, conceivably, Pan’. A reference to Pan would still be consonant with the possible mention of Dryope, his mother, in 13 (see above). In view of the close association of Selene with Artemis (14), however, Professor D’Alessio also points to Virg. G. 3.391-3: Munere sic nweo lanae, si credere dignum est, Pan deus Arcadiae captam te, Luna, fefellit in nemora alta vocans nec tu aspernata vocantem. This brief exemplum is traditionally understood to mean that Pan disguised himself as a white-fleeced ram or (less likely) metamorphosed himself into one in order to seduce Selene/Luna (cf. Serv. Auct. ut illi [i.e. Lunae| formosus videretur, nivets velleri- bus se circumdedit), but there are other possibilities; see R. A. B. Mynors and R. F Thomas ad loc., and W. Frentz, Mythologisches in Vergils Georgica (1967) 129-30. Mac- robius Sat. 5.22.9—10 attributes the story to Nicander (= fr. 115 Schn.), in which case it probably derives from his Heteroioumena or Georgica. Besides the suitable pastoral context, fefellit tantalisingly recalls 60]Adun[ze]v, and dpvo[ could denote the nemora alta in which Pan presumably had his way with Selene. It is also notable that ac- cording to Porphyry De antr. nymph. 20, Selene and Lycean Pan were worshipped together in a cave in Arcadia (cf. 14 avtpovo, G. 3.392 Pan deus Arcadiae). Could the story have been related as an aztion for the sanctuary? I note also the potential con- nection of in nemora alta vocans with Dr Martin West’s suggested restoration (though not with this specific context in mind) of oty [re] xeArddvoc eicalto dwv7 at 6 (in h. Hom. 19.1418 Pan’s playing on the pipes is favourably compared to the song of the nightingale). The other fragments are too scrappy for us to infer a particular context. The most notable is fr. 3, whose second column preserves the very beginning of lines and contains a form of the name Tappac (5), which is otherwise known only from a fragment of Callimachus of uncertain context as the equivalent of Aéayac. The 16 HEXAMETERS reason for the mention of Tammas/Athamas is unclear from the small fragment (see fr. 3.10 n. for a possible context). Fr. 1 does not obviously fit any of the known myths involving Athamas, except that Hermes is associated with the latter on two occasions: first, when he presents the ram with the golden fleece to Athamas’ first wife Nephele after she had saved Phrixus from being sacrificed by his father (e.g. Apoll. Bibl. 1.9.1); second, when he brings the baby Dionysus to Athamas and his second wife Ino to be reared by them (e.g. Apoll. Bibl. 3.4.3; Nonn. D. 9.52 ff.). Nei- ther of these stories is detectable in the fragments; cf. perhaps frr. 4 11.9 véa, 15.7 y|pulcleinv, 17.5 xpuc[. Fr. 4 col. ii appears to preserve a speech with a mention of Ares and an address or prayer to a goddess (76710). For other fragments that seem to imply direct speech, see frr. 3 1.5 n., 16.2 n., 18.5 n. Fr. 29.4 may mention Zeus (see.20,). Although not much can be made of the contents of 5102, its style and diction suggest a poem conceived in the learned Hellenistic manner (an asterisk indicates that the word or phrase occurs in the same metrical sedes). While some specific Homeric loc? are imitated (frr. 1.13* wap craOu-3; 5.2* 7H é€répy; 6.5 atodoc otctpoc; 9.4* xeipac dpeyvuc; fr. 14.5 dual avrécOnv; fr. 16.2 imperative c]zeio?), other words and forms have parallels only in Hellenistic or later poetry. Some are particu- larly reminiscent of Apollonius Rhodius: frr. 1.5* position of émuxpare|we(?); 1.11 ampodhatwe; 1.15 the iterative form of é€avinut; 5.7* audw yepciv; 6.3 the perfect of dopéw; cf. fr. 1.17* émucradov (otherwise only in the Odyssey). For exclusive cor- respondences with Nicander, cf. frr. 5.11 efc wA€ov, 7.3 veBpoto. Specific echoes of Callimachus are the hypocoristic form Tapac mentioned above (fr. 3 11.5) and the oppositio in umitando of Call. fr. 546 Pf. in fr. 1.16; cf. also the possible echo of Hecale fr. 62 Hollis in fr. 3 11.3 (see n.). Other words and expressions shared with multiple Hel- lenistic and later authors, but not with earlier epic: frr. 1.15 Uo Kpyn7id- (Nonnus); 2.3 €umdAn€- for evurrAn€- (Aratus, Apollonius); 2.4 audideroc(?) (Philip, Gregory of Nazianzus); 4 11.4 accusative Apea for Apya (not before Apollonius); 11.2 the verb 6Aomrw (Callimachus, Euphorion, Nicander, Antipater, Nonnus); 12.2 Caypane for Caypnyc/Caypernc (Nicander, Dionysius). Fr. 6.4 tyuxépyne Blod probably recalls Bacchylides 16.22 (see n.). If correctly restored, the adverb Avydn[v in fr. 13.2 is at- tested only by Sophocles. Given the small size of most fragments and the lack of complete lines, it is difficult to generalize about the metrical style of the poem. In the largest fragment (fr. 1), which preserves the middle of verses, the ratio of feminine to masculine caesuras is about 4:1, suggesting that the poem can hardly date from the fifth or fourth century; cf. M. L. West, Greek Metre (1982) 153. At least three bucolic caesuras are identifiable (6, 11[?], 12, 17). The fragment shows four or five contractions, two in the second foot (10, 13), one possibly in the third foot (12), and two consecutive ones in the fourth foot (14, 15). The latter both accord with Naeke’s Law, typical of Callimachus and Nicander, in that the contracted fourth biceps is not followed by 8102. HELLENISTIC(?) HEXAMETERS 17 word end (cf. fr. 2.7 n.). No infringements of Hermann’s Bridge are identifiable (in 8 the prepositive kai would have counted with the following word if it underwent correption). A form of Apud[zy in 13 (see above) would contravene the Callima- chean avoidance of words shaped | ~~ - | ending in the fifth princeps, but this was not universally observed among the Hellenistic poets (see West, Greek Metre 1 55) A spondevazon is likely at the end of 17 (see n.). I am grateful to Professor Giambattista D’Alessio, Dr W. Benjamin Henry, Professor Peter J. Parsons, and Dr Martin L. West for some valuable suggestions, acknowledged individually in the notes by their initials. 18 HEXAMETERS it leeds edo va, | |ciBadacc| da [| eccw'v7a| ay... yremxpar.[ _|xeAsovocet , al o) = foo Vv El rik obvpoverrerpa. | evaxavevOartrep cpl evnuynToupevaTn | [(_)lampod. wetadeotkatal nuabeoutrorecstorT “0 €a | it i | le i WVKQ —OpNAGKLXEVKG | [ | ie iy ik I. ovrrapcTabmov-arap , ool Ja.

The first would imply that someone was seized with something continuously or habitually in his heart (understanding @udv as an accusative of respect); at the beginning of the line e.g, de(war«] or Qavpart] (MLW). The second and third possibilities would presuppose that something is poured (perhaps on the ground, o¥]8e:); in that case, it would be easier to take Aujzov with what follows despite expressions such as AR 2.97 tod 8’ GOpooc éxxuTo Bupdc, 2.561 cbv b€ chw xUTO §upoc (in despond- ency), 3.1009 xv0n S€é of évd08u Avudc (with love), where Oujdc is always the grammatical subject. 8 ] wy Kata pHAa Kiyev. MLW suggests tiv dé (]Swv Kata p7Aa, ‘and seeing her among the flocks’ (alternatively tov ‘him’ at the beginning of the line). unaAa could theoretically correspond either to the word for ‘small livestock’ or that for ‘apples’ (Dor. 14Aa). craOudv at 13 favours the first possibility; see 13 n. and cf. also 12 n. on 6jAea. The word denotes generally both sheep and goats, sometimes only sheep, and is often distinguished from cat- tle (Béec); see LfgrE s.v. wHAov 1B for a rich collection of examples. PMG 562, allegedly going back to Simonides’ Europa, and the adespoton SH 1053, seem to apply the term ju7Aov/ Aa generically to all herds, including large cattle, but both fragments lack a proper context to evaluate their usage. g - ~~ | &vOa Kal vba mepictp[: mepictped- or trepictpwo-. The subject could be the person (or beast of prey?) who has just reached the flock in the previous line, or the members of the flock itself. The compound zrepictpédw in early epic is always active and transitive with the sense of ‘wind/ swing round’ (see LfgrE s.v. crpédw 8.11.8), but the expression év#a «ai évfa suggests that the verb here is in the middle voice and intransitive, indicating motion (‘turn round to and fro, turn in circles’); cf. esp. Il. 24.5 éctpéeper’ &vOa Kai evéa. MLW suggests e.g. 7) d€ Gay] evOa Kat eva mepictpleder’ or mepictp|wpato. 10 — » ]uevn. The ending of the middle/passive participle would imply a female agent. Given the following jum, it is perhaps a verb of fearing or effort. MLW suggests e.g. czepxo]uev7. ju) TOU ev amyl. With the genitive pronoun Tod, it is tempting to restore am7u[Bpore(v), the epic-Aeolic aorist form of addapaptava; cf. Il. 8.119, 21.171 Tod pev p’ adawaprer, 15.521, 16.466 (ad)rob pev aanuBpore(v) (the form am7uBpor- recurs in Jl. 16.477, Pancrates GDRK XV 2.11.7). But although the verb would suit the bow-wielding Artemis (mentioned below, 14), an aorist indicative would be odd after jy (a subjunctive or an optative would be more in order), unless it describes an ap- prehension of something that happened in the past (‘fearing that she missed him’ sc. with her arrows). Other possibilities are am7jp[ovoc, amnu[avrov (both not necessarily in the genitive), and az” ju[aroc. In these cases, the verb dependent on x7 must have come at the end of the line or the beginning of the following one. Il ampodatwc. Both adjectival and adverbial forms are favourites of Apollonius Rhodius, ranging in sense from ‘unforetold, unexpected’ to ‘unutterable, terrific’. The word appears to be a Hellenistic innovation. The adjective is first attested in Aratus (424, 768), the adverb in Apollonius 9102, HELLENISTIC(?) HEXAMETERS oi (1.1201 etc.; often in the same position as here, i.e. before the masculine caesura). The scribe wrote 7 in place of ¢; for the phonetic interchange of the two letters in Roman Egypt, see E.'T. Gignac, Gram- mar i 87. The second hand carried out the correction by adding two further strokes for the stem and the base of the loop of ¢. Elsewhere letters are corrected above the line, but the narrow interlinear space would not accommodate ¢, so the corrector has here followed a different procedure. ra J: understand ju#Aa? 8€ perhaps responds to jév in the preceding line. 12 | npabeor.

The first trace is the end of a horizontal at line level and could represent the tip of a or A (a is perhaps also possible; I take the unconnected upright above the trace to belong to a long descender from the previous line), e.g. dqwa, dy Anwa (Od. 12.286), KAjwa ‘vine branch’, taAnua ‘fine meal’ (Nic. Alex. 551), tAnjwa (Call. Hee. fir. 46, 65 Hollis), Aja, piAnma. mrovec|| ov || kero. Before the correction one could read zo écrovro, but this would result in an unmetrical line and the enclitic zor does not occur in hexameter poetry (cf. 7). The iterative form of mrovew Obtained after the correction is not otherwise attested in Greek poetry, but occurs in Herodotus in the form zroveecx-; a form with single epsilon (olecxe) is also given by the early Byzantine gram- marian Choeroboscus, GG IV.2 p. 144.11. In view of the drastic nature of the correction, tovécKero could be merely a conjectural attempt by the second hand to restore sense to a heavily corrupt pas- sage (was ov a copying error influenced by pov of cra@uov in the following line? MLW also wonders whether the ‘mess derives from variants 7oveéckero and zrovécxero ). Other corrections in these frag- ments do not seem to be variae lectiones (see introd.) and therefore cannot be taken to suggest that the corrector had access to a second copy of the text. If the correction is sound, it is notable that the poet uses two iterative forms (cf. 15 é€avieckev) so near one another; cf. also fr. 27.5 n. @7Aea[: probably understand pyAa.

Tr 1061, Call. fr. 229.15 PE, Ap. 38, Del. 300, Nic. Alex. 239, etc. The adjective means generally ‘fragrant’ and could, but need not, refer specifically to the smoky odour of burnt sacrifice; see J. Casabona, Recherches sur le vocabulaire des sacrifices en grec (1966) 118. It perhaps agrees with a word like Bwydc (see 15 n.), as in Pind. Fa. 3.8-9 Oude[vra ---] / Bwpov, Eur.

Since the adjective was glossed as the equivalent of wéAac in antiquity (e.g. Hesych. . 734 Latte s.v. ioevdéc), its application to the véwp of a spring here can be seen both as an allusion to the Hesiodic locus and as a recherché variation of the Homeric formula pwéAav vdwp (cf. also the for- mula kpyvn weAavudpoc).

Merc.: 13 aiuvdAoupynryy, 66 dpyawewv doAov airy, 76 doAinc 8’ ob ANnDeTo TExXVIC, 155, 514 ToLKLAopHTA, 282 SoAodpadec, 319 TOAYpTIC, 348 pnt éxwv, 361 dodogpocivyy adeydvev; see more generally L. Kahn, Hermés passe, ou Les Ambiguités de la communication (1978) 75-83. If the epithet doAdunric is significant, we would expect Hermes to appear in his capacity as trickster in this passage; see introd. The mention of Hermes not long after the occurrence of j17Aq 1s also significant, for he was a patron deity of shepherds and could himself be represented as one; in addition to the examples cited in the introduction, cf. h. Merc. 2, 232, 314, 570-71, Hes. Th. 444-7, Sem. fr. 20 W., Ar. Th. 977, Paus. 9.22.1, 34.3; see G. Siebert, LIMC V.1 310-15, for artistic representations of Hermes as shepherd and as xpiodopoc, and cf. A. Athanassakis, Eranos 87 (1989) 33-49, and S. Eitrem, RE VIII 775. Eppulawva. I restore this form rather than Epy[jv or Epy[etny as the former would produce 9102. HELLENISTIC(?) HEXAMETERS 39 an unusual verse-end with two separate spondaic words, while the latter would leave a difficult final monosyllable. The form first occurs in Hes. frr. 64.17, 137.1, 150.31 MW, then in Bion fr. 10.8 Gow and several Imperial-period poets (Ps.-Manetho, Colluthus, Nonnus, ete.; cf. J. D. Reed on Bion fr. 10.8). For the alternative possibility that 50Aéjn7w refers not to Hermes himself but to one of his sons (supplementing Epu[eiao at the end of the line), see introd. fr 2 Metrical position: mostly parts of the fourth and fifth feet (the stop after dactyl in 6 should fol- low the fourth foot, since other lines show that the first foot is excluded). 1 |povoc tkero. Cf. the collocations in JI. 11.466 radacifpovoc txero, Od. 8.13 = h. Cer. 96 daidpo- voc ixero, on the analogy of which perhaps restore a compound in -povoc (cf. also Or. Sib. 3.117 Xpo- voc ixero yjpwe). MLW suggests mapad|povoc tkero Ab[ecnc; cf. Bacch. 11.102-3 Adecac Tapppovoc. WBH points to the possibility of restoring fker’’OAv[pzrov; cf. Hes.

Opp. Hal. 2.587 jre AaiAarp), wéudié (MLW); for an- other possible mention of a storm, cf. fr. 12.2 n. 3 Jepac. Metre excludes xpat]epac, duhort|épac, €r|épac, Ouyar|épac. Perhaps av]épac. €umAn€a[. The usual form of this verb in Homer and hexameter epic generally is évuAy-; for the present form, cf. Arat. 423 éumAnén, 750 eumAnccer, AR 1.1203 eumdjn€aca, 2.602 éumdnéacar. In the first and third of these examples, the verb characterizes a tempest ‘striking’ a ship; cf. 2 n. The form here is probably a spondeiazon, e.g. €umAnéalca agreeing with AaiAay or 7éudvé at the end of 2. 1-3 Combining some of the above suggestions one may partially reconstruct these lines as follows: Se ee trapad|povoc ikeTo Av[ cence, 7 Te Katai€aca KJat’ aidepoc HvTE [AaiAarys Te] — wo ~ aepac eumdAngalca 4 apdiderar: either audi de t&u (GBD’A) or audidéran, the latter a rare adjective attested in poetry only in Philip. AP 6.103.2, where it describes ‘bow-drills with cords at each end’ (Gow and Page), and Greg. Naz. Carm. 2.2.7.161 (PG 37.1563), qualifying figuratively Adyov. With the former articulation supply at verse-end e.g. xAa[vovt- or KAa[touc- (trisyllabic spondeiazontes are relatively un- common, however; cf. West, Greek Metre 154 with n. 48), with the latter e.g. cAa[de@ve (cf. Leonid. AP 9.78.3, [Orph.] Avg 925, and frr. 19.4 «]Aador(?), 56.2 xAa[). 5 xexopyora|. The perfect active participle of ckopévvupu always has a passive sense (‘glutted, sa- tiated’); see LSJ s.v., and cf. Od. 18.372 cexopnorte, Colluth. 119g Kexopynorec, Nonn. D. 5.34 Kexopyott. 6 dpevac: audu{. The stop, inserted by a second hand, suggests that this is not the Homeric formula dpévac apdiBeByxev (Ll. 6.355, Od. 8.541) or dpévac audi pedaivac (Ll. 17.83, etc.). 7 Jaec x’ Fuct. The lack of aspiration indicated by the elision «’ imphes that this 1s the third per- son singular subjunctive of eii (cf. Od. 8.580, etc.) rather than the possessive pronoun jc. A curved oblique trace descends from the right-hand side of the last iota at two-thirds height; it does not seem to be a cancelling stroke (cancellation being usually marked by an ascending oblique) and may be just a stray mark. The division Ja «is metrically impossible, since alpha is part of the princeps syllable and needs to be long. GBD’A notes that ‘if this is the end of the line, infringement of Naeke’s law might have been avoided if an ending in -¢i (purely e.g. ducaet, axpaéi) was meant (though in this case I would have expected a trema: cf. fr. 12.2)’. WBH proposes | det «(A)nice weAab[por. 8 cldnpecov. The adjective dnpeioc (< dipic ‘strife’) is a less likely possibility; it is attested only by grammarians and etymologica and, as GBD’A points out, it would be metrically difficult: ‘if the last syllable of Sypevov occupies the 5th longum, dypetoy (if not preceded by a prepositive 40 HEXAMETERS monosyllabic word) would produce a highly undesirable diya toy’ (division of the hexameter into two equal halves). yeA{: presumably a word denoting laughter (forms in yéAw- are metrically impossible); alterna- tively y’ «A{ (GBD’A) or ye A{ (WBH).
