Speigel gave it a good effort and thankfully kept his Yankee fandom to himself. Probably the first Yankee fan in history to do so. Only Peter Angelos is happy to see their fans in town but whatever.\n\nKirk and Mark are juvenile? Then Mickey and Amelia must be just plain asinine on that scale. Mickey is a friggin' slob who'd have to look up couth in a dictionary before attempting to have any. Amelia has always struck me as a far better broadcaster than her counterpart. Maybe this move will motivate her to break free?\n\nIt could be worse... DC101 seems to be right on track for yet another Howard Stern or Greaseman. Truly the least common denominator in morning radio.\n\nWe tune in to listen to both teams laugh at each other's lame humor.\n\n1388 posts ·\n\n#7 ·\n\nRe: (scotaku)\n\njunkies are poo poo and so is everyone working for 98 rock,besides Lopez(rip) they have,had no one worth listening too.I myself listen only to 100.7 the bay and big 100.3 during the day but on my hour plus long ride to work in the morning from towson I've found that hot 99.5 has a pretty funny morning show worth listening too.although teapot Tim has moved on from the radio station its still pretty comical.\n\n3218 posts ·\n\n#8 ·\n\nRe: (0027gti)\n\nelliot in the morning ftw, and don and mike in the afternoon http://****************.com/smile/emthup.gif\n\n652 posts ·\n\n#9 ·\n\nI just miss 99.1 WHFS. \"Eddie Vedder's Pants!\"\n\n2422 posts ·\n\n#10 ·\n\nRe: (WasteOfSpace)\n\ni cant stand any of 98 Rocks shows. Mickey and Amelia are ok but really overall not that funny. If they take the Junkies off of whfs then i will be bitter as they are way funnier than any of the other morning shows. I drive around all day in my work truck with no cd player so I have no choice but to listen to the radio.\n\nbtw. Teapot Tim had the most annoying voice and wasnt funny to me at all.\n\n10466 posts ·\n\n#12 ·\n\nRe: Major changes in B-more radio (99Golf20)\n\nQuote, originally posted by 99Golf20 »FM radio sucks balls.

I happen to love sports, in all varieties, so their show is exactly what I like to hear in the mornings. Besides, they've been mixing it up a little and cover a whole lot more than just the Redskins (which is understandable, they are in the DC market) and creepers. They discuss the Ravens (5-2 baby!) quite often, but if it's hardcore Ravens discussion you're after, then 1570 is definitely the place. http://****************.com/smile/emthup.gif\n\nQuote, originally posted by 0027gti »\n\neveryone on 98 rock is white trash and that radio station plays the same 4 nickelback songs daily.\n\nI couldn't agree more with you here. I honestly can't remember the last time I even turned that station on. Again, everyone there is intolerable and their playlist is even worse.

His voice just irritates me.\n\nQuote, originally posted by 0027gti »\n\n100.7 the bay ftw,at least they play music all morning long\n\nTrue, but how many times can you possibly hear \"Stairway to Heaven\" and genuinely dig it? Chis Emery has been around forever, and he's a good guy, so I will give them that. It all comes down to personal preference and I just so happen to love the Junks, so losing them would suck for me.\n\nModified by 20ae991 at 5:55 PM 10-29-2006\n\n1543 posts ·\n\n#17 ·\n\n98 Rock needed to make some changes in order to try and regain some market share. But \"terrestial\" radio for the loss. Opie and Anthony on XM is AWESOME most of the time. Most of the time they are hilarious. But about 10% of the time they are just horrible.\n\n4693 posts ·\n\n#18 ·\n\nRe: (cpchillin)\n\nMark and Kris on 99.5 in the morning FTMFW...thats about the only time I listen to that station...not as crude as Elliot, more mature than 98 Rock, and the Junk died when El Zol took over. http://****************.com/smile/emthdown.gif\n\n1388 posts ·\n\n#19 ·\n\nRe: (zaxonortesus)\n\n20ae991, yeah you're right,honestly i only care about whats going on with the orioles and ravens and nothing more.but im glad others feel the same way.\n\nQuote, originally posted by zaxonortesus »Mark and Kris on 99.5 in the morning FTMFW...thats about the only time I listen to that station...not as crude as Elliot, more mature than 98 Rock, and the Junk died when El Zol took over. http://****************.com/smile/emthdown.gif\n\nExactly,they both have a different style of humor which i think is pretty funny.although i dont listen to the kind of music they play i can deal with them.\n\n10931 posts ·\n\n#20 ·\n\nRe: (0027gti)\n\nSo is it confirmed that K&M are on 105.7? I don't have that station programmed in my radio. I always felt my IQ drop everytime I listened to the Junkies. I'm not sorry to see them go.\n\nMy 98 Rock wish is that they would have gotten rid of Mark and Mickey. The Kirk & Amelia show would have probably been OK.\n\nFor my morning drive, I bounce between 98Rock (very limited), DC101, 100.7 (actually have music), 103.1RNR (again, music) and 102.7 Jack (OMG! what a revelation - a radio station that plays actual songs!)\n\n8785 posts ·\n\n#21 ·\n\nRe: (2 doors)\n\nI love sat radio. I can get all the music I want for my commuting needs. Otherwise with the roads these days your more likely to hear me switch between my sirius and WTOP then bother with other FM stations.\n\n1414 posts ·\n\n#22 ·\n\nRe: (2 doors)\n\nmeh...

Morning shows are, by nature, intended to be mindless drivel. The Junkies have an enjoyable show and even if they do leave HFS, I'm glad I'll still be able to stream them at work. After they go off, it's all about ESPN Radio or my ipod for me. To each his own, I guess.\n\n7888 posts ·\n\n#24 ·\n\npeople still listen to the radio?\n\n10931 posts ·\n\n#25 ·\n\nRe: (20ae991)\n\nQuote, originally posted by 20ae991 »\n\nYeah, 98 Rock's show really stimulates my mind and I actually feel more intellectual following their show.

As soon as I get in the car, it's channel surfing all the way with very little, if any, time spent on 98Rock. Surely Mickey is about tops on my list for annoying radio personalities. At least with him on the mornings, I'll be able to check out 98Rock on my evening drive home now!\n\nI know the Junkies had a lot of fans, they just aren't to my taste."
