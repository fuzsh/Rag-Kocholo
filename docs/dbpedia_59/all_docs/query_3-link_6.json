        "text": "I couldn't believe my ears this morning when I was scanning the FM band this morning just before 5:30AM and I heard \"What I Got\" by Sublime released in 1996 on my local Classic Rock station 102.9 The Whale WDRC-FM out of Hartford, CT. I had to double check the radio twice to make sure I wasn't tuned to the ALT station Modern Rock Radio 104.1 WMRQ. I'm not a regular listener to Radio 104.1, but I still hear that song played on that station from time to time.\n\nI guess 1996 is now considered Classic Rock. It didn't bother me when last week I heard \"Enter Sandman\" by Metallica and other songs from 1991 on The Whale, but them playing a song from 1996 sure did. September 96 I began my Freshman year in high school. And I remember Modern Rock Radio 104 playing \"What I Got\" when it was first released.\n\nSide Note: Hartford is a weird market. Modern Rock Radio 104 originally signed on in late 1994 replacing Hot AC Star 104.1 WYSR. It was corporate owned by a company that eventually merged into Clear Channel (now i-Heart Radio). In 03 they flipped to Hip-hop Power 104.1 WPHH. The station eventually wound up in the Aloha Trust and in 07 CC flipped it to automated Alt rock \"fm 104.1\" WURH. In 09 local ownership bought the station and renamed it back to Radio 104.1 WMRQ. And thats where we stand today in 2023. Oh and in 2018 the local owner of Radio 104.1 would buy 102.9 The Whale.\n\n1996 was a rough year for rock as mentioned in this Spin article: https://www.spin.com/2021/09/1996-alternative-bubble-burst/\n\nIt's often seen as the beginning of the commercial decline for rock music with the end of grunge in popularity. Since the Classic Rock format features the biggest bands and songs of all time it may somewhat challenging going beyond that year with some exceptions. But then again rock is now commonly seen as a genre that follows it's legends. I believe Queen is still one of the most listened to rock bands today. Even on Spotify these classic bands often overshadow anything recent or from the last 25 years. People now seem to care less about the age of their favorite songs so I guess don't try to fix what isn't broken.\n\nI remember 20 years ago, a song from 1976 in 2004 would have been considered classic rock or played on my local classic rock station. If we consider the same amount of time between 1996 and now, some rock from that era could definitely be considered classic now. 10 years ago same thing, classic rock stations started playing Bon Jovi and hair metal bands from the 80’s.\n\nIn San Antonio we have two rock stations 106.7 The Eagle which mainly plays 70’s-80’s rock and then 99.5 Kiss which is an alternative rock station that hasn’t changed its playlist since 2004. They only play 90’s and very early 2000’s rock, nothing modern.\n\nI'm not sure what year it was but there were people complaining that certain styles of rock weren't on the radio in Greensboro NC.\n\nIn the early 1990s when there was grunge, it was only played on one of the Top 40 stations. Then one station that was playing country switched to \"alternative\".\n\nThe classic rock station eventually played grunge, many years later. But neither the alternative station nor the classic rock station played Kenny Wayne Shepherd, who didn't fit either format.\n\nThese days I'm not even sure what the difference is between the two rock stations. One is regular classic rock, which may or may not still have grunge because I haven't bothered to listen. The other is \"mainstream rock\" and I'm told this format has very few new songs but lots of loud music from many years ago.\n\nPlaying Glenn Miller is cool in 2024 and don't you forget it!\n\nYou wouldn't find me listening to that when I was a teen. It was my dad's music. He actually played in some of the big bands. But now dad is gone and it brings back memories of when I was young. I'm fine with it now.\n\nYou wouldn't find me listening to that when I was a teen. It was my dad's music. He actually played in some of the big bands.

Just because he was good.\n\nI still get to hear his orchestra on online radio. Kind of a shame the sound quality isn't that good.\n\nHere in Seattleland, we had a new Rock station, \"Rock 98.9\" that was Classic Rock, but 80's-00's leaning. Very little, if any 70's stuff, unless it was Led Zep or Black Sabbath. Linkin Park, RHCP, Rage, Motley Crue, Korn, Metallica, Danzig, GNR, the usual Grunge greats, and a few others were the core artists I recall hearing the most. The station lasted just shy of a year and a half, starting in 2016.\n\nSo, having late 90's music on Classic Rock has been done for a while. Maybe the acceptability of it depends on regional music preferences."
