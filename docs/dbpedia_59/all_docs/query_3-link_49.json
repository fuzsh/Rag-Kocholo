        "text": "Where Are They Now?LARadio.com Los Angeles Radio People, H\n\nCompiled by Don Barrett\n\nsend updates and changes to: AvilaBeachdb@gmail.com\n\nH\n\nSince 1970, WCLV/Seaway Productions in Cleveland has syndicated Adventures in Good Music to a worldwide audience. The program has received two coveted George Foster Peabody Awards during its long run, and Karl has received the National Endowment for the Humanities George Frankel Medal. When he gave lectures and concerts, Karl would walk out on stage, he would pause and then say, \"Well, I've often wondered what you look like, too.\"\n\nKarl died on February 6, 2005. He was 91. Karl was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nHABECK, Ted: KWST, 1979-81; KMET, 1981. Ted worked at 106.5 the Arch in St Louis and he was the financial director for Chrysler West in St. Louis. Currently, Ted programs a commercial free, free-form Album Rock station www.theroots.fm and does 8 a.m. -2 p.m. daily. \"I also host a morning show on 98.9 The River in Steamboat Springs, Colorado,\" according to Ted.\n\nBorn and raised in St, Louis, radio was something he became fascinated with listening to \"Johnny Rabbit\" on 630 KXOK-St. Louis.\n\n\"In September of 2012, I celebrate my 50th anniversary behind the mic,\" emailed Ted. \"All of my time at KMET was a great story. I got to work with legends: Jim Ladd, Mary Turner, Ace Young, Jeff Gonzer, Paraquat Kelly and so many others.\"\n\nFrom 1987-88, Edmonde functioned as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Diplomacy in the U.S. Department of State. He was appointed by then-governor Gray Davis to the Commission on Hate Crimes, a nine-member panel chaired by former Secretary of State Warren Christopher and former California governor George Deukmejian. Emonde was a member of PEN, the organization for writers, and the author of Look to the Rainbow, a book of poetry and political and social commentary.\n\nHADEN, Mark: KIQQ, 1988; KLAC, 1993-98; KGIL, 1998-2000. A 30-year radio veteran, he has been at both the network and local level. Except for a stint as pd at KKNG-Oklahoma City between 1990 and 1992, Mark worked at Transtar/Unistar/Westwood One since 1984 when they were headquartered in Colorado Springs. His first pd job was with KJCK in Junction City, Kansas.\n\nMark was born February 19, 1953, in Junction City, Kansas, and grew up in Kansas, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in journalism and mass communications from Kansas State University in 1976. “I first became interested in radio and television at an early age, going back to when I was in 3rd and 4th grades. My first interest was television news and programming. I would imagine myself as a reporter in the field and create my own news reports. I was, and am, a fan of Walter Cronkite, and envisioned myself being an anchorperson one day. I would, on a weekly basis, go to the grocery store to buy a TV Guide for 15 cents [can you believe it?], and go home to program my imaginary tv station. I did both radio and television in college, but opted for radio in the end, achieving one of my goals of working for a network. That was the Transtar Radio Network, which became the Unistar Radio Network, which became the Westwood One Radio Network, which was managed by CBS, which was the network of Walter Cronkite. What a deal!”\n\nWhen Mark got to the network, there were already two ‘Marks’ on the format. “I opted to use a variation of my middle name on the air. I became Doug Haden and used that name for my three and a half years on the AC format.” Transtar moved from Colorado Springs to Hollywood and Mark moved from mornings to afternoons on the soft AC format, Format 41, which was carried on KIQQ in Los Angeles. “It was then that I went back to using Mark Haden, even though many of my friends still call me Doug.” He eventually returned to the network and for almost a decade worked at the Adult Standards format. He's now semi-retired.\n\nHADGES, Tommy: KLOS, 1980-85. The former program director at Rock KLOS arrived in the Southand in the spring of 1980 from New England where he was in dental school and worked at WBCN and WCOZ-Boston. He left KLOS in 1985 to join Jeff Pollack Communications as executive vp. In 1989 he was elevated to Pollack Media group president. He continues as a key executive in the Pacific Palisades-based company that consults stations internationally.\n\nHe co-owns three stations in Aspen.\n\nHaessler, Eric: KLSX, 1995-97. Eric worked as one of the Regular Guys at WNNX-Atlanta.\n\nHAFEN, Steve: KBBQ, 1969-70; KGOE, 1972. Steve was born May 16, 1947, and grew up in the San Fernando Valley. He attended what was then San Fernando Valley State College, managing the FM station. “I was there with Jeff March, Dave Darrin, Carson Schrieber and others.”\n\nAt KBBQ, Steve went by the name Rusty Watters. When he left KGOE, Steve went on to Spokane doing morning drive for many stations. He managed a station in Billings, Montana.\n\nSince 1995, Steve has been the gm at KVIP-Redding. “My first radio job was at KQIQ-Santa Paula. I worked for Bill and Ann Wallace there for a few years before moving to KBBQ.\n\nBill was the technical director for ABC’s Joey Bishop Show, so he technically didn’t own the station. \"Ann did. Great folks. I was interested in radio from the time I could reach one on the kitchen counter in our San Fernando Valley home. I remember listening to Dick Whittinghill, Johnny Grant, Ira Cook and the other great jocks at KMPC back in the early 50s.\"\n\nSteve continued: \"From there, I grew to enjoy just about every format on L.A. radio, including Chuck Blore's Color Radio, KGFJ’s r&b, and KFAC’s classy Classical format. I did have a strange attraction to KFI at one point. I still can't figure out why a 50-thousand watt blowtorch would program polka music in afternoon drive.”\n\nHAGEN, Don: KLSX, 1986. Don retired in 2018 to Solana.\n\nHagen started narrating audiobooks in 1997, as a volunteer at Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic (RFB&D), now called Learning Ally. Over the years, he maintained a twice-weekly recording schedule at Learning Ally and logged more than seven hundred hours in the booth. Although Learning Ally’s mission revolves around textbooks, he recorded several novels and biographies during his time there.\n\nDon joined the team of narrators at the National Library Service (NLS), Library of Congress, in 2004. He had the opportunity to narrate a wide variety of genres: biographies, memoirs, historical fiction, nonfiction, thrillers, suspense, adventure, essays, short stories, young adult books, and classics such as Ernest Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea. He has probably recorded more Civil War-era books than anything else; and because he grew up in Illinois, the Land of Lincoln, this part of history has interested him since boyhood.\n\nHaggler, Mike: KPPC, 1971.

Unknown.\n\nDavid said that he had three options when he left KFBK-Sacramento to come to KFI as news director in 1989. \"First, I had been offered a job I had sought as a newspaper photographer for El Universdal newspaper in Mexico City. Second, I had been offered a job as assignment editor at KCRA television in Sacramento, and I was offered this by George Oliva, who is the pd who put KFI on the air as a talk station. This was the highest risk, but I took it anyway.\"\n\nHe now consults radio stations domestically and internationally.\n\nHALL, Derrick: KXTA, 1998-99.

Mel returned to San Diego and built one of the most successful production facilities in the city. Mel was born October 6, 1931, in Long Beach. At age 14, the family moved to Arcadia, where he dropped out of school.\n\n“In 1948, I recorded my voice for the first time, on a wire recorder in my father’s office. The experience started me dreaming [secretly], that maybe I could become a radio announcer.” Mel got his start at WVIK, near Camp Rucker. In 1951, Mel joined the Army and was sent to Korea. When he left the army, he joined WABB-Mobile, Alabama. “It was at WABB that I discovered my devotion to programming and production.” Following a job at KOCS/KEDO-FM-Ontario, California, he did freelance tv. In early 1958, he joined KLAC. The “FutureFonic Sound” format didn’t last long against Chuck Blore’s “Color Radio” on KFWB, so it was off to San Diego to dj at KDEO. Two years later he joined WJJD- Chicago, then KQV-Pittsburgh, but he missed California and returned to the Southland. “In late 1964, I became pd of KRLA. The station did well, however, I soon became disenchanted with the infighting, back biting, egos and lack of interest and cooperation from the disc jockey staff. Everyone was a ‘program director’ and generally refused to accept new techniques and production procedures. Some of the djs simply didn’t have the talent. I left in early 1966 thoroughly disgusted and disillusioned with KRLA and Top 40 radio. Shortly thereafter, KHJ was dominant in all time periods. In my view, KRLA deserved its demise.”\n\nHall, Mort: KLAC, 1958-63. Last heard, Mort was living in New York.\n\nHALL, Phil: KLAC, 1982-83; KHJ/KRTH, 1985-90.

The jocks were like little god-heads.\" After graduation from UCLA, his entrance into radio was almost a fluke. \"Acting is an obsession, but I always knew I wanted to perform.\" He played music, loved music and was a musician. When he was 27, he was playing in an Orange County club when the owner of KORG asked if he had any radio experience. He fibbed and was soon doing overnights. A year later Dave was driving his Volkswagen when a drunken truck driver with two loads of cement crashed into his car, and the gas tank exploded, trapping him in his car. Hardly a year after the accident, KNX/fm pd Steve Marshall offered Dave the position of md, prompting him to say \"Life Can Be A Dream...Sh-Boom,\" -- an example of how he punctuates his conversations. He talks warmly about the experience at KNX/fm. He called it an \"odd radio station\" that played music no one else was playing and sounded live even though it was automated. Dave appeared in Deal of the Century, with Chevy Chase, playing the part of a Vietnam vet.

Its djs had to drive to the Tijuana “bunker on the mountain” studio, which was next to the 100,000-watt transmitter. “I got shook down [by Mexican police] twice in my first week. They would take all the money you had on you. I learned that you had to ask to be taken to the police station to pay the fine to avoid losing all your money.” Halloran says Yankee rockers would come across the border to get interviewed on 91X before they played at Iguanas, the Tijuana venue that hosted Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana, the Ramones, and Jane’s Addiction. “They arrested the Butthole Surfers because the bass player assaulted someone who was harassing them onstage. They kept them in jail until they paid the fine.”\n\nAfter ten years at 91X, Halloran moved to now-defunct alternative stations such as 92/5, KUPR, and 92/1. He says he and his new business partners have made a $6 million offer to buy a local motel and turn it into the “Rock and Roll Motel.… I also just finished a movie script with one of my buddies from Detroit.

They hosted a daily podcast until joining her partner Frank Kramer for mornings at KLOS in early September 2012.\n\nHeidi was born in Batesville, Indiana. “My little town (5,000 people) made caskets and hospital beds. That got a little depressing after awhile so I had to get out! I then ran off to college at the University of Cincinnati to study Broadcast Journalism. I thought I wanted to be Barbara Walters but I realized I would never ever perfect that accent and interview style of hers so I moved on. I was only in college to please my mom. If it were up to me I would have been running around New York City trying to get on Broadway. I wanted to be an actress; I still want to be an actress. I'm not giving up on that dream yet! I started doing radio in college when I needed to get some credits for a radio class. I called up the local country station and started washing the station van, getting lunch for the program director and begging everyone everyday to put me on the air. One day the midday guy got a case of ‘explosive flu’ and I filled in. Most of the afternoon I took calls on ‘your worst flu story ever.’ Not really a great topic for a lunchtime crowd but I was young and dumb. They all seemed to like what I did and I guess the rest is history.” Heidi started as the traffic person during the “Star 98.7” morning show with Frosty, Frank & Jamie. Heidi joined Frosty Stilwell and Frank Kramer at KLSX for a noonday show in 2000.\n\nHamilton, Jim: KORG/KIKF, 1980-82.

No wonder I was skinny then. I didn’t have time to eat.” In the 1980s Ric left radio and became a mortgage broker.\n\nHancock, Bill: KBCA, 1967-68. Unknown.\n\nWhat Alan Freed was to r&b on the East Coast, Hunter Hancock was to r&b on the West Coast. He set a standard for a new generation of kids who were ready to embrace anything but the prevailing Pop Standards of Perry Como, Doris Day and Patti Page.\n\nThe voice was unmistakable to a youngster growing up on the beach in Santa Monica with his tube-infested Philco \"portable\" radio. \"From bebop to ballad, swing to sweet, and blues to boogie…some of the very best in rhythm and blues records, featuring some of the greatest and most popular musicians, Negro singers, and entertainers in the world.\" That was how he opened his show. The man in control was Hunter Hancock, long before there was Chuck Blore, Boss Radio, 11-10 Men or Color Radio.\n\nTucked away in a small house with no air conditioning on Sunset Boulevard, at the current site of the Cinerama Dome Theatre, was KGFJ. In a house full of personalities, Hunter had the insight to play the most popular r&b records of the day. He didn’t play Rick Nelson’s I’m Walkin.’ He played the original by Fats Domino. Today you wouldn’t think twice about what Hunter did, but at the time it was a big deal.\n\nWhen Hunter arrived in L.A. he started working at KFVD (1020AM). He had an hour show on Sundays sponsored by Todd’s Clothing Store. \"My job was to appeal to the Negro customer so I played jazz music and the rest of the time I was the staff announcer,\" Hunter told me by phone from his retirement home in Claremont in a 1999 interview.\n\nBy the late 1940s a fortuitous meeting with a rep from Modern Records encouraged Hunter to play \"race\" records, which was rhythm ‘n blues music. \"I started with one ‘race’ record a show and the reaction was so strong that the next show I played two and soon my entire show was r&b. My show very quickly went to one hour, then one and a half and a little over a year I was on 3 and a half hours a day,\" said Hunter. In 1950 the Sentinel newspaper said Hunter was the most popular dj in Los Angeles among the Negro population.\n\nHunter was born on Good Friday, April 21, 1916. He was born white in Uvalde, Texas. His father built stone buildings in Hico, Texas. \"When that job ended my father led a big brass band. During World War One we lived in New Mexico where my dad worked in a mine for the war efforts. After the war we went back to Uvalde and my dad raised fighting gamecocks, which was legal then. He also repaired and tuned pianos. I was two weeks out of high school when he died.\" Hunter’s mother was a piano teacher and his brothers have gone on to careers in music. His older brother was a violinist in the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the other played in a dance orchestra.\n\nBefore Hunter got to Los Angeles he worked on the radio in San Antonio and Laredo. \"Where I came from there was no respect for black people. In Los Angeles, my entire career I played black music and worked with black people. They are wonderful people. Thank God I changed,\" Hunter said. You can imagine the shock of the black people when he first appeared at concerts at Wrigley Field, sock hops, and the Lincoln Theatre and they saw for the first time that the man leading the r&b music radio charge was white. The white people were shocked to learn that he was white. \"The black people accepted me because I was playing their music when no one else was,\" Hunter emphasized.\n\nIn the mid-1950s Hunter recorded his evening show from his office in Hollywood and his on-air partner, Margi, would play it back. Why did you record your show? \"I was single and wanted to go out in the evenings. It was as simple as that.\"\n\nIn 1955, KNXT (now KCBS)\\Channel 2 gave Hunter a half-hour on Friday nights to feature a show with local black artists. \"We had everyone from Duke Ellington to Fats Domino to Little Richard,\" remembered Hunter. The show was called Rhythm ‘n Bluesville.\n\nHunter was a hunter. The walls of his office were filled with his prize trophies. \"Your hunting wouldn’t go over so well today?\" I asked. He was quick to retort, \"If you don’t hunt, the herds get out of control and they die of malnutrition. Most people don’t know that.\"\n\nIn the late summer of 1982, Hunter was camping with his wife Dorothy in an isolated area. Two days later he was home when he experienced chest pains. He was rushed to Cedars Sinai Hospital. \"Two days earlier and I would have been camping and I wouldn’t be here today,\" Hunter said matter-of-factly. He was going to have three-way by-pass heart surgery but the vein in his leg was so good, they did a six-way by-pass surgery.\n\nHe quit radio because of the \"nervous strain\" of putting together daily shows, mc’ing at records hops, and running a record label. \"I was taking Valium four times a day and finally got off that and started taking Zantac,\" he said. \"My stomach is not really in great shape and my heart has been acting up.\" His wife of 42 years passed away in February of 1999.\n\nAt his memorial service, Hunter Dunagan Hancock orchestrated one last show. In one of the more bizarre memorial services ever encountered, Hunter was host for his own funeral celebration. Showtime started precisely at 2 p.m. at the Claremont Methodist Church in Claremont. In a congregation filled with radio people, r&b stars (Jewel Akens, members of the Platters, and Robert & Johnny), and friends from Claremont Manor (his home for his last 8 years), we went Huntin’ With Hunter one last time.\n\nOver the sound system, Hunter welcomed the guests. “Now, let’s sing four hymns. Relax, I only want you to sing one verse,” said Hunter. And off we were in a rousing round of hymns accompanied by a full choir. When we finished, Hunter’s voice suggested, “There is a place for us in His heavenly kingdom.” He then asked us to join him in the 23rd Psalm. And that’s the way it went for an hour and a half. There was a screen near the front of the church where award-winning photographs were shown that represented his passion for photography.\n\nHunter Hancock was one of a kind on the radio, in his life, and now in death. He did it his way.\n\nHANDEL, Bill: KFI, 1993-2023. Bill works morning drive at all-Talk KFI and was voted the Marconi Award for the 2005 Personality of the Year. William Wolf \"Bill\" Handel was born August 25, 1951.

His center has over 1,000 baby born via surrogate parent, in-vitro fertilization and/or egg donation. \"When I die, I'll probably get more press for doing this,\" gesturing around KFI. \"But that is the important stuff I've done.\"\n\nBorn in 1952 in Brazil – his father came from Yugoslavia, his Polish-born mother grew up in Brazil. Arriving in the U.S. at age 5, he spoke only Portuguese. Bill graduated from Cal State Northridge with a degree in political science. In 1976, he went to law school at night and during the day started a construction company. He got his degree from the Whittier College School of Law in 1979.\n\nAccording to a story in the LA Times, Bill turned to cocaine in 1979. “Then one night in 1983, alone at his brother’s house, while snorting a lot of cocaine, taking a lot of Valium and drinking a lot of liquor to cut the edge, he started to pray.” The next morning he checked into the chemical dependency center at St. John’s Hospital for four weeks and hasn’t had a problem since.\n\nHANLEY, Jeff: KLOS, 1990. Jeff is a filmmaker, broadcaster, and digital media creative director in Silicon Valley. His broadcast career comprises stints at KLOS, KOME-San Jose, KZAM-Seattle, KTYD-Santa Barbara, and KJZZ-Seattle when those call letters debuted in the Northwest jazz scene. Jeff was KJZZ's creator and first Program Director.\n\nHis love for jazz goes back to the days of working for Jim Wilke, the retiring host and originator of Jazz After Hours. Jeff engineered Jim’s late night jazz show on KING/fm for somewhere around 500 nights, listening to Wilke’s brilliantly eclectic programming and learning from his commentary about the music. Jeff recalls fond memories from working with Wilke: “It was an 11 p.m. - midnight jazz show on a Classical music station. Jim would program 3 vinyl sides, usually from 3 very different styles of jazz. One night might be a side of very early Pat Metheny, a side of the LA Four, and a side of classic Zoot Sims. Between Jim’s discussion of the music and the album liner notes, one couldn’t ask for a better jazz education.”\n\nIn 1997, thinking that he was leaving radio behind, Jeff picked up the camera and began his second career in visual media. In 2000 he moved to Silicon Valley, where he has directed teams of filmmakers, writers, web developers, and other digital media specialists ever since.\n\nHANNITY, Sean: KABC, 2001; KEIB, 2015-23.

Sean got his start in commercial radio after drawing attention and enthusiasm from his Santa Barbara college radio station. He placed a \"Job Wanted\" ad in R&R, billing himself as \"The most talked about college radio host in America.\"\n\nA station in Huntsville, Alabama took a chance and WGST-Atlanta quickly followed. In the fall of 1996, Sean moved to New York to co-host the new Hannity and Colmes Show for the fledgling cable news outlet. Fox was so confident of Hannity’s ability to attract viewers, it slotted the show at 9 p.m., opposite Geraldo on CNBC and Larry King on CNN. The Hannity and Colmes Show consistently beat Geraldo and rivals the veteran King. When Colmes left, Sean continued solo.\n\nSean joined WABC Radio in 1997.

Unlike most military families, mine managed to stay in one place through most of my dad's career. I graduated from Hueneme High School and Moorpark College. I've always loved music, but never thought I had the voice or talent to be a dj, so I got my degree in radio, tv, film with an emphasis on video. My first job in broadcasting was as a newswriter and videotape editor for a tv station in Oxnard. From there I got a job producing a radio show for a psychic. After a short period of time the radio station was sold and changed formats to adult contemporary. I stayed on doing overnights. About a year later, Mike Tanner, who was then the pd of Unistar's ACII satellite delivered format, heard me on the air and offered me a part time job on the network. That was my first job in radio that paid more than $5 an hour!” At KBIG she hosted a Saturday morning show for two years and did fill-in.

I’m equally proud to have played many unsigned and independent artists and to be a champion for Latin Alternative music.”\n\nHarcourt continued: “As a parent of two young children, I believe it’s time for me to explore new career opportunities and expand upon my other activities in movie, television, voice over work, advertising and the Internet. His singular gifts as a radio deejay and his ability to spot new talent attracted major media attention from both national and international press,” said Ruth Seymour, gm at KCRW.\n\nHarden, James: KNAC, 1972. Unknown.\n\n\"A big man with prematurely gray hair, he could be prickly or generous, depending on his mood,\" according to Sarah Spitz, publicity director and producer at KCRW. \"He kept to himself quite a bit, and one always wondered what he might be thinking and whether he was taking notes on the people around him for some great roman a clef about KCRW and its inhabitants. He once interviewed the man who created LSD for a program that aired exclusively on KCRW. It's quite likely Mitchell had some first-hand experience, though we'll never really know now.\"\n\nHARDISON, Greg: KSRF, 1984-85; KABC, 1983-1998; KCRW, 1999; KFI, 1999-2001.

Harmon parachuted and lived through a great man-against-nature survival story. In a virtually unexplored rain forest, armed with a machete and a compass, he headed east to the Atlantic coast in the greatest \"run\" of his career. Later that year Tom bailed out again when, in a battle with Japanese Zeros over Chungking, China, his P-38 fighter took a fatal hit. \"If you didn't have religion before the war, you did then,\" Harmon wrote in his book, \"Pilots Also Pray.\" For his war efforts Tom received the Silver Star and Purple Heart.

She wrote, in part, “Another not-so-subtle attempt to normalize something that is NOT normal. Even if it is normal for YOU it is not the best thing for the baby.

And unknown to me, the general manager was in the process of firing his evening air talent. It was a classic case of being at the right place at the right time,\" Bob remembered in an AllAccesss interview.\n\nIn addition to his sport reporting, he worked drive times at Country KZLA. He was the producer and host of PBS TV television series Country Connection, a Country music video show that aired in 50 markets. Bob is a 20-year veteran Riverside/San Bernardino personality, mostly at KCKC. He has also done play-by-play sports on radio and television for Cal State Fullerton, San Bernardino Spirit of the California League and Little League Baseball Western Region radio network. Bob was twice voted disc jockey of the year by Inland Empire Magazine.\n\nHARVEY, Boyd: KNX, 1966-96. Best known for his work at the station’s Orange County bureau, KNX newsman Boyd died on January 29, 2020. He was 93. After nearly three decades with KNX, the station didn’t even throw a farewell party when Boyd left in early 1996. Perhaps the oversight is related to the environment of mergers and how people are treated. Perhaps it was his curmudgeon personality that refused to participate in one. In this case Boyd left on his own.\n\nBorn on July 20, 1926 the native Nebraskan worked at WKNX-Saginaw, KWBE-Beatrice, Nebraska, and WIND-Chicago before arriving at KNX, which was all-Talk in 1966. An Orange County resident, Boyd began the KNX Orange County bureau in 1973 in the basement of the old county courthouse in Santa Ana.\n\nGary Lycan of the OC Register profiled Boyd: “Crusty. Cantankerous. To many, he’s old-fashioned. He writes his copy on an Olympia manual typewriter. KNX shipped him an Olivetti electronic typewriter. He never opened the box. He has never used a computer, either.”\n\n“Boyd Harvey is one of the guys, part of the team that made me want to join this outfit nearly 30 years ago,” said then-KNX news director Bob Sims in another profile of the retiring Harvey. “In addition to having very good news judgment, he knows how to tell a story. He’s sometimes difficult to work with behind the scenes, but it makes it worthwhile when you hear him on the air.” His co-workers were in praise of the generous help he gave to new reporters. Why did he retire? “I just woke up one morning at 3:30 and said, ‘Why am I doing this?’ Now some people said I should have retired a long time ago. But really, it just got to me, going to work on weekends and at 4 o’clock in the morning two days a week. It was time.\"\n\nHarvey, who was born in Nebraska on July 20, 1926, served in the U.S. Army during World War II as a clerk-typist, and after the war went to work for radio stations as a reporter, sports broadcaster, disc jockey, program director and news director in his home state, Michigan, and Chicago, before landing at KNX in 1966.\n\nKen Levine believes Paul Harvey was the greatest salesman that ever lived. “I used to listen to him every chance I got, not for the news, not for the profile of the guy who invented leotards, but for the commercials,” wrote Ken at his blogspot. “He was absolutely spellbinding. He made every product sound like something you just had to have. He was so convincing even I went out and bought Bose speakers and arthritis medicine … and I don’t even have arthritis. I did stop short of Amway products though.”\n\nLevine continued: “What was his secret? He truly communicated. He talked right to YOU. In words you could understand. He looked straight into your eyes even on the radio. He spoke with conviction, enthusiasm, and all of his arguments made so much doggone sense. Someday I may get arthritis so I better have this stuff just in case.”\n\nHARVEY, Phil: KMPC/fm, 1988; KSRF, 1991. Phil owns a production company. He's also an actor.\n\nPhil was born in Auburn, New York October 30, 1952. “I grew up in New York and Nevada. My older brother Pete got me interested in music and radio. We lived on a ranch outside Carson City in the early 60's. My brother hooked up a crystal radio using extensive barbed wire fences as the antenna. We could pick up L.A. radio!”\n\nHe moved back to upstate New York in 1966. Phil’s first radio station was WNDR-Syracuse at age 15. In the 1990s Phil worked for Metro Networks as a news anchor at KABC, KFSG, and trimulcast 92.7. He also served as the national producer for Metro Networks Entertainment Division and was national entertainment correspondent. He wrote and produced Premiere Radio Networks’ weekly syndicated series “Live From the Sixties” with The Real Don Steele.\n\nHarvey, Rudy: KDAY, 1965; KGFJ.

Ernie, a Detroit Tigers broadcasting legend (42 years as voice of the Tigers), died May 4, 2010, at the age of 92. His death came eight months to the day after he revealed to his fans, in an interview with the Detroit Free Press, that he had a cancerous tumor in the area of his bile duct and that in late July he had been given only a few months to live.\n\n\"I'm ready to face what comes,\" he said at the time. \"Whether it's a long time or a short time is all right with me because it's up to my Lord and savior.\" Harwell's popularity never became more evident than when Tigers management and flagship radio station WJR-AM (760) fired him after the 1990 season. It immediately became the most unpopular move in club history. In one local poll, 97% disagreed with the firing. In 1992, he joined the Angels broadcast booth for one year and then returned to Detroit. In 2005, author and historian Curt Smith ranked Harwell as the third-greatest baseball announcer ever, only placing Harwell behind Vin Scully and Yankees icon Mel Allen.\n\nErnie Harwell's estate was drained by family infighting, according to the Detroit Free Press.\n\nHASHEM, Abdul \"DJ A-OH\": KRRL, 2015-21. Abdul joined the new Real 92.3 as assistant program director and on-air personality in March 2015.

Consuella.\n\nA-OH’s personal taste is versatile, ranging from Electro, Progressive and numerous other sub genres of House, Hip Hop, R&B, dance and classical. An energetic performer, skilled instrumentalist, producer and dj, he has worked to develop his sound for over thirteen years.\n\nHASICK, Scott: KFI, 1994-99. Scott and Casey Bartholomew worked morning drive at KTRS-St. Louis until the Spring of 2006.\n\nScott made a pivot in his career choice nd moved into retail.

I have the best support system in the world!\"\n\nHASLAM, Pat: KNX, 1998-2016. Pat was an anchor at all-News KNX.\n\nThe 1974 Journalism graduate from California State University, Fullerton, was the traffic anchor for the Orange County News channel, where he was known as irreverent Dr. Drive. This enabled Pat to use his distinct style and outrageous personality to keep Orange County up to date on the latest traffic and weather.\n\nIn 1998, he joined KOCE as the head of transportation.\n\nIn retirement, Pat emcees numerous local OC events.\n\nHASTINGS, Bob: Katz Radio/LA 1984-87, 1988-90; KWLT, San Diego 1987-88; CBS Radio Reps/LA 1990-97; KOST/KACE, 1997-98; KLAC, 1998-99; KIEV, 1999-2000; KABC/KDIS, 2000-01; Emmis, 2001-02; Salem/LA, 2002-23.

Whether you were a fan growing up in the Southland watching him on the KTLA/Channel 5 Popeye Show or as an entertainment reporter at KNX, you were sad to learn that Tom Hatten died March 16, 2019. He was 92.\n\nBorn in 1927 in North Dakota, Tom grew up in Idaho and joined the Navy just before the end of World War II. he attended the Pasadena Playhouse Theatre on the GI Bill and graduated cum laude in 1950.

From 1978 to 1991, Tom hosted the “Family Film Festival” every weekend on KTLA. He appeared in local stage productions over the decades. Tom was a member of five industry unions.\n\nShortly after starting this website, I was strolling Hollywood Blvd and decided to capture some early memories at Musso & Frank. Lo and behold, sitting by himself at the lunch counter was Tom Hatten. I introduced myself and asked if I could join him. He was so open, effervescent and excited about everything we talked about. R.I.P. Tom.\n\nHauck, Randy: KVFM, 1960-62 and 1969-75. Randy lives in Sylmar and since 1991 he's owned Video Production Company.\n\nIn 2005, Tom took a break from his duties on the air to work as operations manager for KNX. The task was to help move the station from its long-time location on Sunset Boulevard to its new facility on Wilshire and in the process, help train the KNX staff on an all-digital computerized newsroom. Two and a half years off the air was enough and Tom reunited with Linda Nunez returned to the air in 2007. He retired in the summer of 2015.\n\nHaven, Patty: KEZY, 1975.

Johnny left afternoons at \"K-Earth\" on May 3, 2002. He has a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nJohnny was part of LA Radio in five decades. His unique and distinctive voice and presentation was part of the landscape at Top 40 KRLA and Oldies KRTH for most of that time. For decades, lunch was never lunch without Johnny’s “Big 11” countdown show. His life story is filled with major tent poles, the envy of any personality. The legendary program director Bill Drake hired Johnny at WAKE-Atlanta on Johnny’s 21st birthday. He was on the stage as part of the KRLA jock line-up at the Beatles concerts at the Hollywood Bowl and Dodger Stadium. In 1983 and 1984 he won Billboard’s Personality of the Year and was the only non-morning drive winner in 1984.\n\n“A very vivid early recollection of radio was sitting with my mama, my daddy and my grandparents around the radio listening to Gabriel Heater who gave war news in World WarII,” reminisced Johnny over lunch at a trendy restaurant in North Hollywood. “Listening to the war news was very, very important. Radio stations would normally broadcast orchestras or bands from hotels and big showrooms live on the air. When WWII ended, I’d say from 1945 on, the Big Bands were touring but it came to a point where it was no longer practical or economical to get 40, 50, 60 people in buses and take them around the country to broadcast live and be on radio stations. And it was during this period, the live band broadcasts gave way to more radio dramas and serials – ‘The Shadow,’ ‘The Lone Ranger,’ ‘Gangbusters and those shows. It seems to me it was in the early 50s that I started hearing what later became known as disc jockeys.”\n\nAs a youngster, Johnny used to press his ear up against the speaker of the family radio and he discovered that records sounded different according to what jock had played them. “I started paying more and more attention to disc jockeys. I visited a radio station in my hometown – Macon, Georgia – met the program director and started hanging around the station,” remembered Johnny. “That’s the great thing about being born in a small town. You could hang around a station and sit in the booth with a guy. I was hired without any experience to do a show on a Saturday because the program director and his wife were having a party and he didn’t have anybody to take his place. He put me on the air with no experience and that was the most terror I had ever known. The records seemingly lasted for 5 seconds and I was so scared that I would not only let records run out, but there were other records that no sooner did they start that I would pick the arm off of them while they were playing. You’re laughing.” He acknowledged that he has a recurring dream to this day - about being on the air at a station and everything going wrong. “You can’t reach the mike switch. Or you can’t get back the studio in time. There was one thing I could never do and that is read 60 second live commercials. And in my dreams I’m always given dozens of 60 second spots to read which are impossible. In the 50s – and I went on the air in 1959 – they had to do a 15 minute world news round-up at the top of the hour and at the half hour there were 5 minute newscasts. Well, that was 20 minutes of news, all live by the disc jockey.\"\n\nDrake went to KGB-San Diego and Johnny followed as a KGBeach Boy. Then Drake made his indelible mark at 93/KHJ in 1965. “More than once he tried to get me on KHJ,” Johnny recollected. “For some reason, Ron Jacobs [KHJ pd] and I didn’t hit it off or something, I don’t know what happened. Then two or three years later, Ted Atkins, who had come down from Denver, became program director. And Drake, once again, pitched me to him and that didn’t work out either. So, I would’ve been at KHJ and a real live Boss Radio jock if Drake had his way. I just stayed at KRLA. He was trying to get me to come to KHJ when I was at KRLA. KHJ was so exciting to listen to. Robert W. Morgan and The Real Don Steele were the best. It was just delightful and it was a tight ship, and KRLA had always been kind of real friendly and home-style,” observed Johnny.\n\nHayes, Kate: KLSX, 1989-90. Last heard, Kate works for a station in Santa Rosa.\n\nHayes, Larry: KPPC, 1971. Unknown.\n\nHAYES, Lauren: KLSX, 2003-06.

She was appointed pd in late 2007. GM Steve Candullo said at the time: \"Over the past month, I have worked closely with Shirley and it has become clear to me that she possesses all of the skills and passion necessary to be very successful in her new position. I am particularly pleased that the person leading our programming strategy is someone who is within the target audience of V100. Shirley is extremely bright, focused, disciplined, creative and has very strong communication skills. She has shown that she is completely engaged in the pursuit of excellence.\"\n\nShirley left the station when Radio-One sold the station to Bonneville. She's now an Internet marketer. Shirley is based in Atlanta and helps women in media attract the career they really want.\n\nShirley attended Columbia College of Chicago.\n\nHis on-air philosophy was simple: \"I never want to give the listener the impression that I'm a smart aleck. I want them to feel superior to me - I think they like you better that way.\" In 1969 Dick won the Top Country Air Personality Award from Billboard. Every morning the listener got dumb jokes: \"I know a man so dumb he thinks Shirley Temple is a place to worship\" or \"Chill Will's mother said when her son was born, 'I just had a chill'\" or \"Have you ever been to Wedlock, Texas? Yeah, well, Gumdrop was born a little out of wedlock.\"\n\nIn 1976 he joined as a regular on tv's Hee-Haw. Newsman Art Blaske remembered: \"Dick was a real pro and he had to rehearse his lines. He would come into the newsroom and go through his whole act.\" Dick played bit parts in several films, including Support Your Local Sheriff.He left KLAC in early 1980 and in April a testimonial dinner was held for Dick at the Hollywood Palladium where it was announced that Metromedia was establishing a Dick Haynes Scholarship Fund for Radio Broadcasting. In August, he received a Star on the Hollywood Boulevard Walk of Fame. Dick was on the KLAC payroll until he died of cancer on November 24, 1980, at the age of 69. As Gumdrop would say every morning, \"What time is it?\" It was a good time, Dick. Healy, Jerry: KMPC, 1987. Jerry worked at the Pop Standards format at Westwood One.\n\nHis headstone at Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn reads: \"Jim Healy, 1923-94, IT IS TRUE.” KMPC gm remembered the day that Jim came to work and was so happy to have found a plot next to a sidewalk. He wanted people to see it! In 1997 he was inducted into the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Hall of Fame.\n\nHEARN, Chick: KLAC. The Los Angeles Lakers announcer died August 5, 2002, from complications after a fall in his home three nights earlier. He never recovered after two brain surgeries. Chick had shown remarkable resiliency in the eight months prior to his death. On December 20 he underwent heart-valve replacement surgery. In mid-March he fell getting out of his car at a gas station breaking his hip. He returned to the Laker broadcast booth in time to call their games through the playoffs to their 3rd consecutive championship.\n\nSince 1960, Chick has been the voice of the L.A. Lakers on radio and tv. The former host of Bowling for Dollars, he was inducted into the American Sportscasters Hall of Fame, was the third broadcaster elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame, and he received a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. \"Put a game in the refrigerator,\" signifying when the game outcome was locked, came from his 83-year-old grandfather who misplaced things around the house and later discovered them in the refrigerator. In the midst of the glory of announcing for an enormously successful sports franchise, there have been some tough times. Their son, Gary, died at 27 in 1972. Their daughter, Samantha, died at 41 in 1991.\n\nBorn Francis Hearn on November 27, 1916, Chick graduated from Bradley University. In the early 1950s he worked in Peoria alongside veteran tv anchor Jerry Dunphy. Chick called an unprecedented 3,338 NBA games before he underwent open-heart surgery in late 2001. During that broadcast streak, the Lakers scored 364,148 points winning 2, 092 games. Eight U.S. Presidents served during the streak. Chick was a college and high school referee for about eight years before becoming a broadcaster. Who will ever forget his one sentence: \"Wraparounddribbledrivefallawayprayer!\" In 1997 the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Association named him top radio play-by-play announcer.\n\nHEARRING, Chet: KLIT, 1997; KIIS, 1987-2006. On-air he was known as Chester the Arrester.\n\nChester had been with KIIS for 18 years, starting as an intern and working his way up through phone operator, the mail room and then van driver. He then had an opportunity to work on the Rick Dees Show in a support role and drove one of Dees’ characters around to different events. “In 1989 the pd, Gerry DeFrancesco, called me in his office one day and asked if I would like to do call-ins from the street. My first assignment was on the Bruce Vidal show [God rest his soul] and then after that I was with afternooner Magic Matt Alan.” It was Magic Matt who came up with the nickname for Chet. The station was doing a super sticker promotion and Chet was waving cars over to the side of the road and rewarding them for having the sticker affixed to the bumper or window. Each time he pulled someone over, the name Chester the Arrester became a natural introduction to the promotion. Chet started doing on-air weekend gigs at other Clear Channel stations, including KIST-Santa Barbara, ‘Y102’-Victorville, and KMEN-Riverside. “I had a lot of fun up there. People like to make fun of the Antelope Valley, but when you think about a half million people, the place is bigger than New Orleans. It was a great gig!” enthused Chet.\n\nHeatherton, Dick: KFI, 1986; KMPC, 1987; KJOI, 1989; KOCM, 1989-90; KXEZ, 1991; KCBS, 1992; KACD. Dick is an author, trainer and motivational speaker.

In 1976, he was elected to the San Diego County Board of Supervisors and served until 1983, having become the youngest person to have served as a county supervisor in San Diego. In 1983 he was elected mayor of San Diego.\n\nRoger began his radio career immediately after leaving political life. He graduated from St. Augustine High School in San Diego, from UC Santa Barbara, and from UC Hastings College of Law.

There will never be another one like him.\"\n\nHeftel purchased the two LA Spanish-speaking stations in the mid-1980s. “I recall that the two stations were for sale for right around $40 million,” said McDaniel. “I thought it was kind of funny because KTNQ was at 1020, which is where I got my notoriety when it was KPOP. What goes around comes around.”\n\n“On a trip to Los Angeles, I told Cec that I didn’t think the stations would ever be that cheap again,” Earl continued. “He was incredulous because it was a lot of money in those days. Heck, it’s a lot of money today. We talked about it for two or three days and then we made an offer. We got the financing and it went into escrow and we received an offer of a $4 million profit before it came out of escrow if we wanted to flip them. And we decided not to and just went from there.”\n\nEarl brought in Ken Wolt, from the Heftel Cincinnati operation, to run the two newly acquired LA stations.
