Or maybe it is? \nI don't know how many JackFM listeners were clamoring for the DSC but I wasn't one of them. \nI've listened to the DSC show for um, could it be almost 20 years? I've had a few laughs along the way, but the repetitive bits started collecting dust. It was time to move on. \n\n**** \nSo I've given the show a week and it's pretty good. Don't miss Shelly AT ALL, and Emily/ Elaina are filling in nicely. The show still has the best music bumpers in San Diego. \nThis city isn't a hotbed for wacky morning shows but DSC is the best out there right now. \n\n- Chainsaw hasn't been this funny since his days on San Diego at Large. \n\n- Shelly MIA? Pulling a Vincent Jackson? Locked out over some contract technicality? Speaking of which, why is she allegedly still under contract at clearchannel yet the others are free.. Stop covering up for her!\n\n- No More flügelhorn jokes!\"",
