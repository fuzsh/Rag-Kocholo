        "text": "My family and I recently stayed at The Jefferson Hotel in Richmond, VA. I was excited to find a section about Elvis visiting the hotel and just had to take a picture. The Jefferson has hosted over 13 US presidents, but Elvis is by far the most exciting guest to me!\n\nMany, many years ago, on the set of \"Roseanne\", Mr. Elvis Presley was featured on the set walls in various spots of the living room. He first appeared in Season 2, Episode 1 on the fireplace mantle as you can see here. Later, the dishes were moved to a more prominent spot near the staircase where you could see them much easier. John Goodman also performed as Elvis in two different episodes which are fun to watch if you search on YouTube. Love seeing Elvis being honored!\n\nElvis is a character in Dean Koonz Odd Thomas first three books , tittle Odd Thomas , Forever Odd, and Brother Odd. Its always a a great delight when we hear him being referenced in a movie or a song is playing but to my delight when I started reading this series he was referenced more and more and by the third book I considered him an actual character.\n\nWhile visiting my nephew at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in upstate NY last weekend, we toured the famous George Eastman museum (Eastman was the pioneer and innovator behind modern photography and film...think Eastman Kodak). They currently are running an exhibit called \"Crashing into the 60s\" featuring original color posters in their collection, from famous movies around the globe during that decade.\n\nOne of the first ones entering the room is a full floor to ceiling size poster of Elvis in the movie Clambake!\n\nI watch Mysteries at the Museum on the Discovery Channel. They profiled Elvis' visit to the White House, his famous meeting with President Nixon. Part of that visit, what I did not know, was that Elvis presented President Nixon with a commemorative pistol from WW II and ammunition in a display box. This gift to Nixon is now in the Nixon Presidential Museum.\n\nThis Christmas I was watching the movie Christmas Chronicles on Netflix. In the movie, Kurt Russel is playing Santa Claus and when Santa Claus and the two children hanging out with him walk into a tavern in the background Elvis is singing Here Comes Santa Claus. Then Kurt Russel as Santa gets arrested and while he is in jail he breaks out into song clearly singing the Elvis bluesy version of Santa Claus is back in town.\n\nWe went to a gift shop in a little town near Orlando called Celebration. The owner had quite an Elvis display. Saw this eyeglass case with lens cleaner and bought it on the spot! Now, Elvis is with me where ever I go!\n\nTumpie House. Located in the small town of East Dublin in middle Georgia has an ENTIRE room full of Elvis items…… the room is actually named the Elvis Room…. And from what I understand you can request to sit in this room or have your event in this one room…. Some of the items on the wall are very old and original. Please see photos for yourself. Not to mention the best steak this side of Texas!! I have many more photos to share.\n\nWalking out of the ‘Great Moments with Lincoln’ show in Disneyland you’re let out into a hallway with many portraits and photographs from pop culture history. The first one I noticed as I exited the doors was a photo of Elvis, with a plaque that read ‘Spirit of Celebration.’\n\nI spotted this at our local IKEA. They even have Elvis glasses on the table. Love seeing things like this in my hometown. This not only makes me think of Elvis, but also my late husband Richard. Brought a big smile to my face.\n\nOn the show the detective goes to see the officer. There is a picture of Elvis on her coffee table. He asks what with the Elvis picture. She says she went on a date with him when she was stationed in Germany.\n\nI was in a Honky Tonk in Nashville about 25 years ago and they had these posters for sale. I bought one and had it framed and it's been on my wall (three different residences) ever since.\n\nWe were visiting colleges with our daughters and one day we were at James Madison University in Virginia. After the tour we stopped in town for lunch at James Brown’s Beer and Burger Joint. “The Elvis” was the name of one of their 8 burger choices.\n\nI was visiting my hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania last week, and I went to Cooper’s Seafood House. Scranton, as you might know, is the home of the American version of “The Office”. I was enjoying all the “The Office” themed memorabilia on my way to the restroom, and when I opened the door to the women’s room, The entire restroom is Elvis-themed! They play his songs on loop and air snippets of his concerts on a wall TV! (My husband said the men’s room is Beatles-themed, which is fun, but not nearly as cool.)\n\nIf you look on the bottom left magnet you'll see a piece of scarf from Elvis himself when he played at Hobart Arena in the 60's!!! How exciting it was for me to get my blood drawn this morning 😘\n\n\"A photographer has been making yearly treks to a remote corner of the world in the hopes of spotting Elvis. He finally succeeded. Named after the King of Rock and Roll, Elvis is a male king eider duck, a colorful seabird that dwells in the polar regions of the Northern Hemisphere, far from most humans.\"\n\nRead more at: https://www.sacbee.com/news/nation-world/world/article275818216.html#storylink=cpy\n\nI’m watching a rerun of Kounting Cars and Danny Kount, the star, and owner of Kount’s Customs, travels from Las Vegas to Detroit to attend an Autorama. Before going to the car show he drives to a Detroit suburb to see his grandmother’s house for the first time since 1977. The house is abandoned, derelict, and open. He goes in and walks around the house, talking about his grandma and getting rather emotional. In the sitting room, he describes the furniture it once held and, pointing to a corner, says, “That’s where I was sitting when I heard Elvis died.”\n\nI wanted to pass along a quick story. My wife and I went to The Netherlands last month. We went to Keukenhof Gardens to see the millions of tulips.\n\nWhile we were looking I saw a little sign that tells the observer what types of tulips are in the garden. One of them is called “Graceland!\"\n\nI have attached the picture. Always cool to see Elvis represented!\n\nI am sending you these pictures to tell you that Elvis is everywhere. I was at a girls' weekend in Brooklyn Wisconsin with my best friend since kindergarten and her 2 sisters this past weekend, and we spotted Elvis there, and of course I had to have my picture taken with Elvis. I listen to Elvis radio every day, and it helps me get thru my work day!! I have been such an Elvis fan since I can remember and I will be there with my fiancé this August for Elvis week and staying at The Guest House. I am so very excited for it.\n\nAs I was listening, I was flipping through the morning paper. Our Long Island paper runs on Saturdays a weekly compilation of news illustrations from around the country. I attached the picture from the San Diego Union-Tribune. Poor Prince, now King, Charles can’t catch a break and has to share top billing on Coronation Day with you know who. I think it is amazing that almost 46 years later all you need is an image/word that everyone recognizes: King, White Jump Suit, Hair, Sunglasses, and Guitar.\n\nOur NHL hockey team, the Vegas Golden Knights, have started a new locker room tradition. In the locker room post-game, the best player of the game gets to don an Elvis wig and sunglasses as a celebration for his contribution. Perhaps a way to say “Thank you, thank you very much.” Go, Knights, Go!\n\nThis morning I flipped on the TV after jumping onto my treadmill. The series “Murder She Wrote” was on that features the late Angela Lansbury (Elvis’ mom in Blue Hawaii) - the episode from 4/30/95 called “School of Murder” just came on & the opening scene is in a classroom where Angela Lansbury is the teacher & one of the other teachers beside her addressing the class. The question for the class was: what became of the bust of Shakespeare that was prominently positioned on the stand? Instead when unveiled, it was a bust of Elvis! See photos. The teacher then acknowledged the significance of the king of Rock n roll - but asked rather meekly if the Shakespeare bust could return (no questions asked).\n\nI went to see my aunt and stopped to bring her lunch at a place called Garibaldi's in Arlington Heights, IL and you are greeted by a life-size statute of Elvis. I have been a fan since 1957 when I was only 13 years old and still a huge fan.\n\nMy husband and I are huge Elvis fans and had an amazing Elvis sighting this past Friday from the Apple TV show Ted Lasso!! Ted was in Amsterdam and went into an American-themed restaurant called the Yankee Doodle Burger Barn and low and behold Viva Las Vegas was playing on a big screen in the background!!! Elvis is truly everywhere!!!\n\nDon Johnson was watching 'Fun in Acapulco''. In his home, there were numerous posters and pictures of Elvis. There were also other Elvis souvenirs. Johnson even sang an Elvis song. In my excitement to report this, I forgot the song. Needless to say, I don't remember much about the movie. I was too busy looking for Elvis!\n\nMy family and I visited a diner in Maryville, TN that Alicia might want to add to her list of places to visit. The Elvis decor on the walls was great and the Elvis burger was even better. It is served with peanut butter and a banana.\n\nI just returned from a great vacation in Memphis. My husband and I drove 1000 miles from NYC to see Graceland while listening to Elvis all the way on Sirius XM. We stayed in the Guesthouse, took the Ultimate VIP tour, and it all was awesome! We’ve been home a few days now and decided to take a ride to the Borgata in Atlantic City. We’re walking in the casino when I spot an Elvis slot machine! I’ve never seen one before so I’m sending you a picture of it. If you read this on air I wish that you would play two of the songs that I love and which I think really show the beauty of Elvis’ voice. They are Young and Beautiful and Pocketful of Rainbows.\n\nLaurel Montana Uniquities Shop & Main Street Perks Coffee Ship. My Son, noticed the larger then life Elvis in the window of the store so we visited and found a bust of Elvis within the store. We went next door to the coffee shop where they had a large cardboard Elvis cutout that they just added the same day as our visit. They also had an Elvis record playing.\n\nAt Silver Dollar City in Branson, they have a festival happening right now through early May. There is an artist who completes portraits on stage. Her performance combines painting and graffiti, & is a lot of fun. I'm still sitting in her show & just had to share that she did one of Elvis while playing Blue Suede Shoes! Pictures are attached.\n\nI was ecstatic to see a classic Velvet Elvis while having lunch with my family at Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers! I couldn't wait to submit this as my very first sighting in my local area. I always have an eye out for Elvis, so I'll be sending more in the near future.\n\nDid you guys catch the Billy Corgan interview on Howard 100 on 03/28? I just listened to the replay on replay the app. At the 3hr 37min mark (about 6m before the end of the show) Howard asks Billy about Lisa Marie and then Billy waxes poetic for 5 minutes on Lisa’s talent and how underrated Elvis was as a performer. Powerful statements from the Pumpkin Master himself. Billy REALLY admired EP. Wow.\n\nAt the annual county fair recently in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, the horticulture exhibit theme revolved around music genres. My husband and I are always on the lookout for Elvis in our travels, and we were delighted to happen upon TWO Elvis sightings in one night!! The floral arrangement was cleverly done up using molded records alongside an Elvis LP, and then the other was a flowerpot Elvis for the garden. What a fun sight to see! Been loving Elvis ever since childhood and we're both in our 50s now. It is such a thrill to spot his memory from time to time.\n\nThe Mississippi Aquarium in Gulfport has a new beaver habitat, just in time to celebrate International Beaver Day (April 7, 2023). The three beavers, all less than a year old, have been named Elvis, B.B. and King in homage to some legendary musicians from the state of Mississippi.\n\nI live in Raeford right outside of Fayetteville, NC. I always stop at the Kenly 95 Petro Truckstop on exit 106 off of I-95 in NC when I am traveling -- so I stop there often. When I stopped there on my way home from NJ on March 26, 2023 imagine my surprise when I spotted Elvis. Of course, I had to take pictures to show you.\n\nWe were visiting the Nixon presidential library in nearby Yorba Linda, California. They of course have the photo of Elvis and Nixon which I'm told is the most requested photo from the National Archives. They also have the gun Elvis gifted to the President and they have the daily log from the day of Elvis' visit.\n\nWe had an Elvis sighting of sorts...Leslie and I went to See Victor Trevino Jr in concert on 03/19/2023 in Phoenix. Leslie went to the stage and got a kiss during \"Love Me Tender \" He is as good as any ETA's we have seen, he sang for over 2 hours. He did not disappoint, it is a small venue that seats 1500, and he performed\n\nlike it was 15,000.\n\nMy cars transmission went out during my vacation to Memphis to visit Graceland. I ended up trading in my vehicle and purchasing a Jeep instead while still in Memphis. My fiancé and I named her Lisa Marie and have decorated it with Elvis' signature and the 68' Comeback Special tribute on the back.\n\nWe were driving back home (Lakeland, fl) from Homosassa springs on the back roads and passed through Brooksville and saw this shop on the side of the road, decided to stop it. And much to our happy surprise we found quite a few Elvis things. My 3 year old daughter is absolutely in love w Elvis, she was so so excited.\n\nI was reaching my daily Catholic prayer book. in 1974, A Catholic nun by the name of Sr. Janet Mead From Australia was up for a Grammy for her pop version of The Lord’s Prayer. She lost her chance at the Grammy to Elvis Presley for his recording of How Great Thou Art. This nun passed away in 2022 at the age of 89.\n\nWhile attending my church’s Wednesday service, I opened up to the March 1st Lenten reflection. It covers Australia’s singing nun, Sr. Janet Mead. Sr. Janet in 1975 was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Inspirational Performance category for her gold record “The Lord’s Prayer.” Look’s who mentioned in the second paragraph of the reflection as Sr. Janet was the runner-up for the Grammy. No surprise to find Elvis in church.\n\nI was in Las Vegas so we made reservations to the Golden steere restaurant. As we were sitting down for dinner the waiter was talking about the history and of course as I heard him say famous people such as elvis I instantly got excited -- As I was walking I noticed a small picture of elvis in the corner at a big corner table as I got closer I seen a small plaque that said Elvis Presley's booth...I was in total shock because it was late enough where I was able to sit in this booth where elvis sat also...it was an incredible night...this is my elvis story and sighting thank you for everything you do and long live the king Steve kut westport massachusetts\n\nThe Anchorage Police Department made a Facebook post saying they picked up a pig in the Fairview area. They said someone saw the animal standing on the side of the road and that he “looked cold.” the department said in the post. Officers said they promptly drove the pig, whose name is Elvis Pigsly, back home to his owners.\n\nCharacter played by Don Cheadle obsesses about Elvis and mentions him in every sentence, pretty much. They even snuck in a brief Elvis clip. Oscar worthy moment was hearing him say “ALL white people have a favorite Elvis song.” but I know you shouldn’t say that on the radio.\n\nWhether or not you love Elvis, or have ever made plans for a thousand-mile road trip alone with a parent, you'll love this novel. I found this book to be a speedy read that gave me lots to think about after it was finished.\n\nI took the picture on Jan 7th, but we've been back there many times and usually sit at the bar and it's right in front of us. Feels very homey to have a drink with Elvis's picture on the wall.\n\nDuring my stay at the Eden Rock Hotel in Miami Beach, I saw the following 'live' artwork, part of an installation throughout the hotel of popular culture. As you move from side to side, the figure moves, and you eventually see the skeleton inside. They have one of Elvis.\n\nFayetteville, NC has Elvis night each year. I went last night and they played clips of Elvis in concert in the Jumbo tron, had Elvis trivia on the jumbo tron and an impersonator singing during the intermissions. Elvis played here in Fayetteville, NC Aug 1976.\n\nI saw on TikTok this Elvis restaurant and it funny cause basically the entire restaurant is covered with Elvis, yes even the bathroom as well & there a tv where they play elvis music as well - the Restaurant was Azteca restaurant and lounge, in garden grove California.\n\nMy husband and I went to the movies to watch a documentary called \"Young Plato,\" about a principal at a Northern Ireland school in 2020. Apparently, the principal is a ginormous Elvis fan and the documentary is threaded with Elvis ringtones, Elvis memorabilia, and the principal talking about Elvis throughout it. It was a pleasant surprise!\n\nWe know that Elvis never traveled internationally except when in the Army, but my wife Kathy and I saw him in Glasgow, Scotland this June. He was in a hallway of the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, one of the most important museums in Scotland. We're not crazy about this depiction of Elvis but still glad he's recognized there!\n\nI live in Indiana and was taking a mini vacation to one of my favorite little towns, French Lick, Indiana. While I was down there I visited their ice cream shop called French Licks. They have several wood carvings there on display from their neighbor store, Bear Hollow Wood Carvers. Well this year when I went, there was a life-size statue of my beloved Elvis! Of course I had to get a picture and share!!\n\nMy wife and I recently took a weeks vacation to Cabo San Lucas and I happened to notice Elvis Presley on the crepe menu. Of course it was Peanut Butter and Banana, but they also add Strawberry Jam and a little chocolate driizzle!\n\nWhile watching The Golden Girls, season 4, there's an episode where Sophia (briefly) remarries. During the episode Blanche and Rose start and Elvis Presley fan club chapter. Rose makes a mistake somewhere and ends up inviting a living room full of Elvis impersonators to the wedding instead of Sophia's guest list.\n\nMy 7-year-old went on a field trip there for school back in May and told me about the painting. He didn’t know about the King Creole poster. It made me excited to see both!!!!\n\nMy husband and I went to Cracker Barrel for dinner, in Willoughby, Ohio, on 2/19/2022. on the wall of the restaurant was this picture of Elvis, it was a promo for a concert in 1956, at the National theater in NC. Then walking around in the store after dinner, was a CD of Elvis Country. We enjoyed seeing both items.\n\nAfter I got a new Jeep, I was reading how to set up my SirisXM radio so I could listen to the only station worth listening to; The Elvis Channel. Seems like Jeep agrees.\n\nElvis' 34th birthday is celebrated by Paul McCartney & John Lennon in the new Beatles documentary, \"Get Back\" that is streaming on Disney+. In Part 1 of the three part fim around the 2 hour 1 minute mark. Paul started impersonating Elvis on January 9, 1969. Mal Evans, an assistant to the Beatles, casually noticed the impersonation, and being a huge Elvis fan himself, mentioned to Paul that the previous day (January 8, 1969) happened to be Elvis' birthday. Paul then repeats what Mal had said so that John Lennon and others can hear it. John then gave a military style salute to hearing that yesterday was Elvis' birthday. Mal then said that Elvis turned 34 years old. Paul then sang, \"God bless our gracious king.\" John said after saluting, \"I think I am starting to catch up to him.\""
