        "meta_description": "19 reviews of LA KALLE RADIO, 100.7 AND 105.7 FM \"I've had an obsessive relationship with La Kalle going on for more than a year now. They play \"Reggaeton\"--reggae en espanol---that is akin to Dancehall Reggae mixed with Merengue. It was bound to happen--the folks in the Caribbean are starting to mix it up a little bit.\n\nNow, as to why I find tears in my eyes sometimes when I listen to La Kalle. First, my kid's papa lives in Panama, home of the first Reggaeton star, El General.  My kid misses her daddy a lot. Second, I feel moved by the mixture of African and Latino cultures in Reggaeton---the news is rife with violence between all our ethnicities, and it's hopeful to hear something that is a blend, like Reggaeton. Third, when I first found out about La Kalle, I was visiting an ill family member in the hospital every day, and listened to La Kalle on the way to visit, so there's a tragic connection.\n\nA big plus is that La Kalle plays other kinds of music, too: Bachata, American Rap, R&B,  Rock en Espanol, some merengue...and the afternoon DJ, \"ShoBoy\" is hella funny. \n\nFinally, with their bilingual on-air personalities, listening to La Kalle is a gentle way to brush up on your high school Spanish.\"",
