        "text": "Yet another 98.5 The Sports Hub host is under fire for making “gross” comments after a sports legend passed away.\n\nOn the day after basketball legend Bill Walton died, 98.5 morning show host Fred Toucher called Walton a “phony hippie” and replayed a 2010 interview when the host hung up on the Celtics champ.\n\nToucher received heavy online criticism in the wake of his Tuesday remarks, and he addressed it during the beginning of Wednesday’s show.\n\n“I saw yesterday there were all these wonderful memoriams of Bill Walton. Everyone loves him, and he’s the greatest,” Toucher said. “And then there’s one a-hole that said something that wasn’t nice, and that was me. So that was poor timing.\n\n“Apparently everyone loves Bill Walton,” Toucher added. “Poor timing, you know. So there you go. Probably shouldn’t have said it, not on that day. Alright, what’s coming up Hardy?”\n\nA listener on Tuesday had asked Toucher to play the audio from his 2010 interview with Walton during the Celtics-Lakers NBA Finals. Walton’s son Luke was on the Lakers at the time.\n\n“He called in and he was acting the fool about his son on the Lakers,” Toucher said on Tuesday as he mocked Walton for selling Jeep Wranglers.\n\n“While he was selling cars, like make up your mind you phony hippie,” Toucher added. “Like are you really selling cars or you all about peace and love?”\n\nToucher’s co-hosts said they shouldn’t run the 2010 interview when he hung up on Walton, but Toucher insisted.\n\n“Just go ahead, he’s dead,” Toucher said. “I didn’t kill him. Go ahead, play it.”\n\nToucher has since been facing heat on social media, and other sports radio hosts are calling him out.\n\n“He’s a jerkoff,” Pat Donovan, of the “Pat and Aaron Show” in Tampa Bay, said of Toucher on Wednesday.\n\n“That’s gross,” he added of Toucher’s comments about Walton.\n\nAaron Jacobson of the Tampa show said, “I don’t think he (Toucher) should lose his job over it, I just don’t know why anybody would want to listen to that.”\n\n“Toucher and Hardy” has been dominating the morning ratings in Boston.\n\nBack in 2017, 98.5 host Mike Felger apologized for the “low-class” comments he made in the wake of Cy Young award winning pitcher Roy Halladay’s death in a small plane crash.\n\nFelger had said of Halladay on air: “I looked at that guy and said, ‘That ain’t no tragedy.’ It just sort of angers me. You care that little about your life? Your little joyride is that important to you, that you’re going to risk just dying? … ‘Whee! Whee! Yeah, man, look at the G-Force on this! I’m Maverick. Pew, Pew! Yeah, man, look at this, this is so cool!’ And you did. Splat, and it’s over.”"
