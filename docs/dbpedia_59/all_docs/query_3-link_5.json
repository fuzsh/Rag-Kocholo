        "text": "When presenting my radio station, the first pushback I hear is…” I listen to Sirius or Spotify or Podcasts”. I jump right in and say “great”. Then I say “do you order take out or go out to eat at the same place every time?” I mean pizza is good…but every time? Of course not, there’s pizza night, Chinese night, Mexican and so on. With traffic pattens back to pre Covid and then some, radio night ( and day) is doing just fine and it’s less calories! #100.7thebay. #currentdayHFS\n\nHave you ever struggled to create a social media post?
