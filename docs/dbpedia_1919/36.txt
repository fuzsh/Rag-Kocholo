David Michael Burtka was born in Dearborn Michigan on May 29, 1975. He’s an actor that has been in many TV shows such as How I Met Your Mother but he is also a professional chef. He got his culinary arts degree from Pasadena’s Le Cordon Bleu. He actually trained under chef Mario Batali so we know he must be making some pretty incredible meals at home. He started his own catering company in LA called Gourmet M.D. with one of his classmates from culinary arts school. He has since moved with his family from Los Angeles to New York City. He was most recently seen in the TV series A Series of Unfortunate Events and has a couple of projects in the works for 2020.
