        "text": "The 'How I Met Your Mother' alum announced on Twitter Monday that he married his partner of more than 10 years, David Burtka, in a secret ceremony in Europe.\n\nThe 41-year-old actor also shared a photo of their nuptials, which took place during a colorful sunset.\n\nThe pair wore custom Tom Ford tuxedos for their nuptials, which were officiated by their friend Pam Fryman, the long-time director of 'How I Met Your Mother'.\n\nTheir 3-year-old twins, Harper and Gideon, took part in the big day, and close family friend Elton John performed at the reception.\n\nPICS: 2014's most cashed up dudes on TV\n\nHarris, 41, and Burtka, 39, met performing on Broadway and began dating in early 2004. It was two years later that the 'Doogie Howser, M.D.' alum officially came out and the pair made their red carpet debut in 2007.\n\nIn 2010, they became parents when a surrogate gave birth to their fraternal twins.\n\nAfter the Marriage Equality Act was passed in New York in 2011, Harris announced their engagement on Twitter, but noted they had quietly been engaged for five years.\n\nThey then took a slow route to the altar — routinely shooting down rumors of relationship strife — waiting until after Harris concluded his most recent run on Broadway, starring in 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch', three weeks ago before heading overseas to Europe for their hush-hush wedding.\n\nIn June, Harris picked up the award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical for 'Hedwig' at the 2014 Drama Desk Awards in New York City and instead of making his speech all about himself, he turned it into a tribute to Burtka.\n\n\"I'd like to thank David Burtka, my fiancé. We've been together for over 10 years and when we first met I was doing a show, Cabaret, and he was Tulsa in Gypsy. We were both doing shows at the same time and my path has led us mostly to Los Angeles and it has sort of uprooted him from what he had been doing. So, thank you so much for your love and for your patience and your sacrifice in all that you do.\"\n\nAww! Congrats to the happy couple.\n\nPICS: Celebs who are out...and proud!"
