        "text": "Recently, we reported a nationally known artist, Jelly Roll, is set to perform in Midland, Michigan during the summer of 2024.\n\nNow, another major concert has been announced, with big-name acts in Bay City, MI.\n\nSee Also: New, High-End Steak & Seafood Restaurant to Open in Birch Run, MI.\n\nMid-Michigan concerts in summer 2024\n\nHip-Hop music fans will surely remember hitmaker, rapper Nelly. He dominated airplay, sales, downloads and streaming charts as soon as his career took off in 2000.\n\nNelly's catalog of hit is big -- far beyond his biggest single \"Hot in Herre.\"\n\nTitles like \"Country Grammar,\" \"Ride Wit Me,\" \"Dilemma featuring Kelly Rowland,\" \"Over and Over\" recorded with Country music star Tim McGraw and so many more... spent weeks and months stuck in our heads.\n\nWhere is Nelly playing in Michigan in 2024?\n\nThe Bay City Music Festival is scheduled for Friday & Saturday, June 21-22, 2024.\n\nThe concert will be held at Veterans Memorial Park along the Saginaw River in Downtown Bay City.\n\nAnother major act is joining Nelly, too.\n\n\"Right Thurr\" rapper Chingy to perform in Mid-Michigan 2024.\n\nHit-maker, Chingy, will also be performing during the Bay City Music Festival. Chingy's hits dominated the radio, CD players and iPods in 2003 and 2004.\n\n\"Right Thurr\" and \"Holiday Inn\" were inescapable... and still get featured on our favorite playlists.\n\nWe get to hear them live in summer 2024. The nostalgic vibe is real.\n\nBay City Music Festival 2024\n\nTickets are available for purchase at kensheltonpromotions.com. Also performing that weekend is the act Redburn.\n\nMid-Michigan is lucky to have so many big names already set to perform in 2024."
