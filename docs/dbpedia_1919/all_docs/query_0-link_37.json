        "text": "UPDATE 6/4/2024:\n\nDavid Livermore won big on the Wheel of Fortune last night, walking away with over $18,690 and a cruise to Eastern Europe. David nearly guessed the Bonus Round answer that would have earned him another $40,000 but was only able to figure out two of the three words. David also had the honor of being among Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak's final week as host of the show. All things considered, David had a pretty memorable time.\n\nA teacher from the small town of Engadine located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula is set to steal the spotlight from Pat Sajak and Vanna White on June 3rd as he attempts to solve the puzzle and walk away with some \"big money\" or nothing at all.\n\nWheel of Fortune\n\nIn a quick summary, contestants guess consonants and vowels to progressively solve a word puzzle. Contestants spin a wheel to earn varying amounts of money values that they use to build their bank, spinning until they either guess an incorrect letter or the spinner lands on \"Bankrupt\" or \"Lose a Turn\". Solving the puzzles gets you a chance to win a cash prize, a trip, or even a new car.\n\nEngadine, Michigan\n\nIf you've never heard of Engadine, don't knock yourself too hard. The small town called Engadine is found along US-2 W in the UP (upon getting off the Mackinac Bridge, head west). It has a population of 1,128 people. Humorously, it would seem that not even Google has made its way to Engadine in a hot minute as the most recent street view comes from 2008.\n\nDavid Livermore\n\nHowever, size matters not, as Engadine Consolidated Schools graduate-turned 7-12 instructional aid David Livermore will be featured on the June 3rd episode of Wheel of Fortune. The episode will air at 7 pm. In a Facebook post by the school announcing his participation in the show, David himself commented that he was voted \"Most Likely to be on Wheel of Fortune\" his senior year of high school (way back in 1997!). It's cool to see that moment come full circle.\n\nYou can watch David and Wheel of Fortune on NBC on June 3rd at 7:00 pm."
