        "text": "Give your readers a fascinating biography. Neil Patrick Harris became a child television star on the hit show Doogie Howser, M.D. and went on to greater success with other shows, movies, and theatrical roles. David Burtka has received rave reviews for his work in theater, appeared in television shows, and followed his dream of becoming a professional chef. One of Hollywood's most prominent same-sex couples, they found each other while working in Broadway musicals. They married in 2014 and continue to entertain while raising a family. They actively support several causes, including Feeding America, Stand Up to Cancer, The Trevor Project, It Gets Better, and Born This Way Foundation."
