        "text": "Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka were at very different places in their lives when they met. Harris was reflecting on being single in his mid-20s and told Out:\n\nI’ve never had any kind of long-term relationship. I remember thinking that the rest of my life would be solo. I wasn’t weepy when I thought that - it was just a realization that I had gone this long being self-sufficient.\n\nBurtka, on the other hand, was in a long distance relationship that was not doing very well. Burtka and Harris met through a mutual friend in New York and felt an attraction. Harris said he did not want to interfere with Burtka's relationship, so they started to spend time with each other platonically. Burtka said:\n\nWe began hanging out with other people, and we had a lunch or so, but nothing romantic. I thought he was adorable, though, with these amazing blue eyes that are just hypnotizing to me.\n\nBurtka broke up with his boyfriend shortly after he and Harris became platonic friends. Harris and Burtka had their first date at the movies to see the film Taking Lives about a week later and the significance of their relationship to each other became clear. Burtka remembered how they \"started hanging out every single night, and after three months, it was just non-stop.\"\n\nThey began dating exclusively soon after they realized they had deeper feelings for one another. After Harris landed the role of Barney on How I Met Your Mother in 2005, the couple moved to LA together. Harris believed the show would be \"a short chapter\" in his career, but they remained in California for 10 years. Though they never lost sight of their overall plan to returning to New York and raise a family.\n\nDespite being together for several years already, the couple kept their relationship to themselves since Harris had not yet come out. Speculation about their relationship arose after Burtka appeared as Scooter on How I Met Your Mother. Rumors began circulating about both their relationship and Harris's sexuality.\n\nHarris made the decision to come out in 2006 both for his own peace and Burtka's happiness. In an interview with People, he stated, \"I am happy to dispel any rumors or misconceptions and am quite proud to say that I am a very content gay man living my life to the fullest and feel most fortunate to be working with wonderful people in the business I love.\"\n\nNot only did his coming out free him of any speculation over his sexuality, but it allowed the couple to publicly date for the first time. Harris explained:\n\nFor me, I fell in love with a dude and started spending all my time with him. And therefore, you don't want to be suppressive of that... I didn't want to disrespect David. I didn't want to make David feel like he didn't exist in my life, and at the same time I didn't want David's identity to be, 'The guy that's dating me.'\n\nAfter finally making their relationship public, the couple continued to date without the pressure of speculation. Two years in, Burtka knew that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Harris. Burtka came up with a very romantic plan for his proposal in 2007. He arranged it so he would propose to Harris on the same street corner where they first met years ago. Harris recalled:\n\nWe were on our way to an event at [a casino] 45 minutes out of town in a limousine, and David wanted to stop for some reason that I didn't quite get... And then he got on one knee and proposed, and I was so freaked out by it that I said, 'Yes,' but I didn't know what it meant. Then I got the ring and loved it.\n\nHarris made his plans to return the romantic gesture to his fiance soon after.\n\nDespite already being engaged, Harris wanted Burtka to experience the same happiness he did when Burtka proposed. He waited one year after the initial engagement, and on Valentines Day, 2008, he popped the question while the couple was in Santa Monica.\n\nAt the time, marriage between same-sex couples was not legal in New York. Harris expressed his desire for that level of commitment with Burtka back in 2012. He said:\n\nI’d also like to call him my husband. I’m not the biggest fan of the word 'partner': It either means that we run a business together or we're cowboys... I’ve been saying 'better half' for as long as I’ve been able to. I think it’s a little self-deprecating and clearly defines that we’re in a relationship, but it would be nice to say 'my husband.'\n\nThe couple kept the news of their engagement out of the press.\n\nHarris and Burtka were open about their desire to raise a family from the beginning. Burtka recalled, \"Even on that first date, we talked about kids. If he hadn’t wanted kids, I don’t think we’d be together.\" Harris added:\n\nChildren were always talked about, but there was a certain point - when David was in LA and I was working on How I Met Your Mother, maybe season two or three - when we both agreed that if we wanted to have kids, we didn't want to do it super late in the game.\n\nWhen they finally decided to have children, they opted to use a surrogate with a personal relationship to the couple and an anonymous egg donor so that their children would be biologically related to them. They used two eggs and two embryos, one for each of them. Luckily, both embryos took and they had fraternal twins.\n\nHarris announced the news of their twin's birth on October 12, 2015, on Twitter a few days later. The couple revealed the meaning behind their children's names to Out, \"We named Gideon after an artist we collect, Gideon Rubin, and Harper after Harper Lee. To Kill a Mockingbird is one of our favorite books.\""
