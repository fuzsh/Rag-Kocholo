        "text": "Lasting love. Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka have defied Hollywood odds with their long-lasting marriage. The actors met when they were both on Broadway, with Harris in Cabaret and Burtka in Gypsy. Burtka was in another relationship at the time, and often commuted to Los Angeles to see his then-boyfriend. \"I didn’t want to be that guy who was creating some sort of romantic interference,\" Harris explained to Out in 2012. \"So, I was always around when he was around, hoping the stars would align. When we all hung out for the first time — I was invited by [mutual friend] Kate to an American Idol viewing party — I just stammered around him. I couldn’t take my eyes off him.\" The twosome began dating in 2004 and Harris publicly came out as gay two years later. The pair expanded their family in October 2010, welcoming fraternal twins Gideon Scott and Harper Grace via surrogate. Harris and Burtka secretly tied the knot in 2014 with only 45 guests in attendance.

Harris admitted that he said those three little words before his better half was ready to say them back.\n\n\"I initially fell for David harder than he fell for me,\" the Doctor Who guest star told Out in 2012. \"I was in love with him before he was comfortable saying it, and I think that speaks to our past experiences. I remember saying, 'I think I love you,' and he was like, 'That’s really nice,' which is not necessarily what you want to hear. But I appreciated his honesty in not jumping the gun and saying something because he felt obliged to.\"\n\nCredit: Stewart Cook/Shutterstock\n\nNovember 2006\n\nThe It's a Sin actor publicly came out as gay.\n\nIn 2021, Harris reflected on the process of announcing one's sexuality. \"The coming out process, I just feel strongly, that it is so individual, there are so many variables and shades of grey within it, that it's no one's right to dictate any of it,\" he told Glamour UK. \"There's a lot of metaphoric thought processes that come with making decisions. I think it's a long process.\"\n\nCredit: Marion Curtis/Starpix/Shutterstock\n\nJune 2011\n\nHarris announced his engagement after the state of New York legalized same sex marriage. However, he said the proposals happened years prior.\n\n\"David and I did propose to each other, but over five years ago!\" he wrote via Twitter. \"We've been wearing engagement rings for ages, waiting for an available date.\"\n\nBurtka popped the question in 2007 on the street corner where they first met. Harris made his own proposal to Burtka in 2008 during their Valentine's Day celebration in Santa Monica.\n\nCredit: Andrew H Walker/Shutterstock\n\nJune 2016\n\nAs the family settled into their Harlem townhouse, Harris hosted the Tonys for the third time in 2016. \"I assumed [How I Met Your Mother] would be a short chapter,” the star told Architechural Digest in December 2016. “But the plan was always to come back to New York when the show ended and raise our family.”\n\nCredit: Stephen Lovekin/Shutterstock\n\nApril 2022\n\nThe two attended the City Harvest Gala in New York City shortly after their 18th anniversary.\n\n\"Our first date was 18 years ago today. And David Burtka, I am not about to let you go. Happy anniversary,\" Harris wrote via Instagram at the time. \"Thank you for showing me the capacity of my heart. I love you so much.\"\n\nCredit: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images\n\nApril 2024\n\nHarris and Burtka celebrated their 20th anniversary.\n\n“Our first date was 20 years ago today. Man, how time has flown by … and yet … we’ve shared so many adventures, created so many remarkable memories. If the next 7,300 days are like the previous ones, I’ll be absolutely thrilled,” Harris wrote via Instagram to commemorate the occasion. “Happy anniversary, David. I love you unconditionally, most of the time. XO.”\n\nBurtka also shared a sweet post of his own.\n\n“My dreams have come true since we decided to take this incredible journey together. Today marks 20 years since our first date and I can’t imagine a better life,” he wrote alongside a photo of the pair holding hands. “@Nph I love you with all my soul. I deserve a fking medal … and so do you.”"
