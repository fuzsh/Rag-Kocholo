        "text": "From time to time you hear stories about why you should check your coins because they could be worth a lot of money.\n\nIt could because of a printing error or what the coin was made out of back in the day.\n\nTwo examples of this happening are 1943 Copper Lincoln Cent: During World War II, the U.S. Mint switched the composition of the one-cent coin from copper to steel due to copper shortages.\n\nHowever, a very small number, estimated around 15-20 coins, were accidentally struck on the normal bronze planchet in 1943.\n\nThese 1943 copper Lincoln cents are extremely rare and valuable, with examples selling for over $100,000 at auction.\n\nRead More: Michigan Woman Wins $4 Million Dollars Thanks To A Stranger\n\nIn 1955 Doubled Die Obverse Lincoln Cent: Some Lincoln pennies produced in 1955 at the Philadelphia Mint have a major doubling error on the obverse (front) side.\n\nThe date, \"LIBERTY\" and \"IN GOD WE TRUST\" are clearly doubled, while Lincoln's image is not affected.\n\nThis dramatic error makes these 1955 doubled die Lincoln cents highly sought after by collectors, with examples selling for hundreds or even thousands of dollars depending on the coin's condition\n\nThere is now another piece of money that you have right now that could be worth a lot of money.\n\nMichigan Check Your $1 Bills, You Might Have One Worth $150,000\n\nSome $1 bills printed in 2014 and 2016 by the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing contain a rare printing error that could make them worth up to $150,000 to collectors.\n\nThe error occurred when the Bureau printed two batches of $1 bills, one in New York and one in Washington D.C., with matching serial numbers\n\nTo identify these valuable bills, look for the following characteristics\n\nSeries date of \"2013\" near George Washington's portrait\n\n\"B\" Federal Reserve Seal above the serial number\n\nSerial number ending in a star between B00000001* - B00250000* or B03200001*-B09600000*\n\nIf you have a matching pair with the same serial number, collectors may pay between $20,000 and $150,000 depending on the condition.\n\nSo far, only nine matching pairs have been found, leaving millions of these misprinted $1 bills still in circulation.\n\nCurrency misprints are extremely rare, making them extremely valuable to collectors.\n\nSo before spending that $1 bill, make sure it's not a $150,000 windfall waiting to happen."
