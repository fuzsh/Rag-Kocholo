        "text": "We all know about the actors from Michigan, like Jeff Daniels, Tim Allen, and so many more, but what about the actors you don't see? There are some iconic voice actors from right here in Michigan who you may not know came from your town and made it big doing what they love.\n\nWe Do Have Famous Voice Actors in Lansing, Detroit, and Michigan\n\nYou may not recognize the name Chris Jai Alex but you have likely heard his voice more often than you would think. Alex, a Lansing native, was the voice of Kotch in the highly successful Final Fantasy VII Remake, as well as the voice of Toby in Aquaman: King of Atlantis, a 2021 TV show.\n\nIf movies are more up your alley, then Danny Jacobs might be the voice you have heard the most over the years. Born and raised in Detroit, Jacobs' most recognizable role was voicing King Julien in The Penguins of Madagascar series (2008â€“2015). You may also remember Danny's cameo appearance as a Pirate with an Eye Patch in Epic Movie (2007). Jacobs also did voice-over work for animated television series, including Phineas and Ferb (in which he provided additional voices) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (in which he voiced Snake / Snakeweed), as well as several video games including 'Batman: Arkham Asylum' (2009) and 'Batman: Arkham City' (2011).\n\nMichigan Also Has Network Television Voices\n\nCheboygan, Michigan-born Kurt Kelly is most known for voicing characters in various video games, including 'World of Warcraft: Cataclysm,' where he voices three Gods. More recently, Kurt is the signature voice of Sony PIX Television Network. His distinctive voiceovers range from newscaster or announcer to cheesy, animated and silly fun.\n\nSo, the next time you hear a voice coming from a cartoon, movie, T.V., or video game character in Michigan, keep in mind that it could be coming from someone that lives close by."
