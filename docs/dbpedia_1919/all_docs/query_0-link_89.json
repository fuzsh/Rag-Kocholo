Carson, who is American.\n\nSofia has stated:\n\nMy mom is Colombian, so I was raised going to Colombia every year to see my family. I am lucky enough that I get to speak both languages and they are both a part of who I am. Also, we were raised eating mac and cheese and popcorn, but also, deditos de queso, empanadas, arroz con pollo and listening to boleros, or reggaeton, but also listening to Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, and others. We’ve been raised completely biculturally. I think it’s a cool experience; I never really knew or appreciated [the] good it would do me in my future to be bicultural — to have both cultures with me and both languages — than right now in this moment in my career. Speaking Spanish has been such a plus and I feel so proud to be Colombian, and to be Latin and to go around the world and speak my languages. It’s great.\n\nSources: Immigration record of Sofia’s paternal grandfather, René Roque Daccarett Giha – http://www.familysearch.org\n\nGenealogy of Sofia’s mother – http://genealogiacolombiana.com\n\nhttp://www.elheraldo.co (in Spanish)\n\nhttp://www.jetset.com.co (in Spanish)\n\nhttp://www.alfresco.com.co (in Spanish)\n\nPhoto by kathclick/Bigstock.com\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nDot Jones\n\nBirth Name: Dorothy-Marie Jones\n\nPlace of Birth: Turlock, Stanislaus County, California, United States\n\nDate of Birth: January 4, 1964\n\nEthnicity: English, possibly other\n\nDot Jones is an American actress and a former shot putter.\n\nPhoto by kathclick/Bigstock.com\n\n↧\n\nSheryl Underwood\n\nBirth Name: Sheryl Patrice Underwood\n\nPlace of Birth: Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas, United States\n\nDate of Birth: October 28, 1963\n\nEthnicity: African-American\n\nSheryl Underwood is an American comedienne, actress and television host.\n\nSheryl’s maternal grandparents were Robert Lee Pack and Calora Liddel.\n\nPhoto by kathclick/Bigstock.com\n\n↧\n\nJanet Leigh\n\n↧"
