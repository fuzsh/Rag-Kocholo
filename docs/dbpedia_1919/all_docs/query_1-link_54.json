        "text": "Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka are now parents to two teenagers.\n\nThe longtime couple, who married in September 2014, each took to their respective Instagrams on Oct. 12 to celebrate their twins, Harper and Gideon, turning 13.\n\n\"And, just like that, they're teenagers,\" Harris wrote in the caption of his post. \"Happy birthday, Harper and Gideon. You are the lights of my life. I can't wait to watch you want nothing to do with me, and I promise I'll be with you through all of it. Just, wow.\"\n\nThe \"How I Met Your Mother\" alum shared a series of photos of Harper and Gideon, including one of them wearing party hats for the festive occasion.\n\nBurtka's post included a slideshow of images as well, leading with one of Harper and Gideon looking down at their phones, seemingly unaware their dad was taking a snap.\n\n\"Happy 13th Birthday to my incredible children!\" the professional chef wrote. \"It is so great to have teenagers that are so engaged and wanting to spend quality time with their dad.\"\n\nHe continued, \"In all sincerity I couldn't ask for better kids. Harper and Gideon you make me proud to be your dad. You are turning out to be spectacular people.\""
