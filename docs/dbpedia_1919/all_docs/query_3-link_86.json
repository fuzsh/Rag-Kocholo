        "text": "Neil Patrick Harris is married, and it's to a Michigan man. The \"How I Met Your Mother\" star and his actor-chef groom David Burtka, tied the knot this weekend in Italy. The two dated for 10 years and are parents to 3-year-old twins.\n\nThirty-nine-year-old Burtka was born in Dearborn, Michigan.\n\nCheck out pictures.\n\n_________________\n\nTalking about crashing a wedding.\n\nBeyonce and Jay Z are vacationing in Portofino, Italy, and took a tour of a local church this weekend. A wedding was taking place at the church and the 33-year-old singer took a picture with the bride who was obviously very happy. What a wedding day to remember.\n\nRead more and see the picture.\n\n_________________\n\nJennifer Garner was apparently mad at husband Ben Affleck after doing their Ice Bucket Challenge video. After Garner helped Affleck complete the challenge, Affleck took his wife down into the pool, along with her cell phone.\n\nThe actress, who was at the Toronto International Film Festival this past weekend, said she was upset at first about her husband's sneak attack, and added that he could've at least forewarned her. But Garner said that she realized being without a phone is quite liberating."
