        "text": "It was a series of fortunate events for Neil Patrick Harris.\n\nThe actor and his husband David Burtka traveled to Alaska with their adorable 6½-year-old twins Harper Grace and Gideon Scott over the weekend, taking in the breathtaking natural sights as a family.\n\nHarris, 44, documented the icy vacation on his social media accounts, first sharing a photo of some “Glacier goodness” starring the twins.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs? Click here to get those and more in the PEOPLE Babies newsletter.\n\nIn an image posted on Monday from Skwentna, Alaska, little Harper posed in front of a serene lake. Proud papa Harris captioned the moment with a simple, “Harper in Alaska. #love #grateful.”\n\nBurtka also cozied up to the couple’s son for a selfie in front of the lake — this time in front of a special rainbow backdrop. “David and Gideon in Alaska. #rainbow #love #grateful,” the A Series of Unfortunate Events star wrote.\n\nSharing a final photo gallery, Harris reflected, “Can’t stop thinking about our Alaskan adventure. Lots of pics, please swipe and see. Thanks @withinthewild for providing memories that will last lifetimes. Truly a spectacular place!”\n\nSkwentna is known best as a checkpoint on the annual Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. Anchorage is the closest major city to the tiny town, whose population was a mere 37 as of the 2010 census."
