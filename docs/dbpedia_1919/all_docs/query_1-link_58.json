        "text": "Neil Patrick Harris will have two teenagers in the house before you know it.\n\nThe actor and his husband, David Burtka, are celebrating their twins' 12th birthday on Oct. 12, and the couple shared new photos of the birthday boy and girl to mark the occasion.\n\nHarris posted a pair of pics of Harper and Gideon on Instagram and described them in the caption as \"the greatest two things that have ever happened to me.\"\n\n\"They inspire me, make me chortle, allow me to be an imperfect father, and fill me with a type of love I never knew could exist,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Being a parent is all-consuming, the most constantly challenging thing David and I have ever done. But so, so worth it. They are remarkable. They are my children. They are my world.\"\n\nBurtka posted his own sweet snapshot to Instagram, featuring Harper and Gideon standing side by side with their arms around each other. Harper dons a pair of dark jeans, a vibrant blue top and a black moto jacket, while her brother opts for a more casual ensemble consisting of a pair of blue jeans and a graphic T-shirt.\n\nBurtka captioned the post with a loving message for his two children.\n\n\"Happy 12th GOLDEN Birthday to these incredible kids! I can’t believe how fast this has all gone!\" he wrote.\n\nThe proud father went on to humbly brag about Harper and Gideon.\n\n\"I am so proud of how you are growing up. You are sweet, caring, compassionate, creative and you have the best sense of humor. I am proud to be your dad and I can’t wait to see how the next 12 years evolve. I couldn’t ask for better kids!\" he wrote, adding the hashtags #goldenbirthday, #12on12 and #wondertwins.\n\nBurtka posted more photos on his Instagram stories, including a family pic that showcased a \"golden 12 birthday\" cake.\n\nJust two years ago, Harris reflected on how quickly his twins were growing up as they celebrated their 10th birthday.\n\n\"Ten years! This last decade has absolutely whizzed by — and I’ve loved it. I’ve never felt more tired and broken down, nor more awake and alive,\" he wrote at the time.\n\nBurtka and Harris often share their parenthood musings on social media. During the pandemic, the couple even acknowledged the challenges of home-schooling in a hilarious video.\n\nOver the summer, Harris shared an update on his kids, telling Jimmy Fallon on \"The Tonight Show\" that Harper is currently very interested in horror movies.\n\nWhen she'd asked Harris for the name of the scariest movie he's ever seen, he unwillingly obliged and said it was \"The Shining.\" After begging him to watch it with her, Harper then offered her opinion on the film, saying she was \"mildly disappointed.\"\n\nStill, Harris said his daughter proceeded to sleep in her fathers' bed for several nights after watching the movie.\n\n“I think it was a little scarier than she thought,” he told Fallon."
