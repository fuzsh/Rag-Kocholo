        "text": "A wealthy Michigan city will be the backdrop for a new murder mystery television show on NBC.\n\nThe network is filming a murder mystery television show about a gardening club that gets caught up in a murder in Grosse Pointe, Michigan\n\nYes, you read that right - a gardening club murder mystery. Variety describes the show as follows,\n\nFour members of a suburban garden club, all from different walks of life, get caught up in murder and mischief as they struggle to make their conventional lives bloom.\n\nA pilot has been ordered for 'Grosse Point Garden Society', and if picked up, the Michigan-based show will be a prime-time show on NBC.\n\nAccording to the Detroit Free Press, the show is being produced by the people behind the NBC drama 'Good Girls', Jenna Bans and Bill Krebs.\n\nYou may remember that 'Good Girls' was also based in the Great Lakes State, however, it was filmed in Los Angeles and Atlanta - not Michigan.\n\nNo word as to where 'Grosse Point Garden Society' will be filmed, may we suggest Beverly Hills, California?\n\nGrosse Pointe is not one of the ten richest cities in Michigan, however, it is indeed upper class, and some areas of Beverly Hills would certainly make for a nice backdrop in our opinion.\n\nAs of now, no cast names have been announced, and if the project does not get approved by NBC, we may never know.\n\nUntil then, be sure to watch your back this spring and summer when attending to your garden.\n\n10 Richest Michigan Cities 2024\n\nGallery Credit: TSM Lab"
