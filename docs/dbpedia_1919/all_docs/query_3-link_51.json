The kids see that their parents are safe and their parents are on a good foot. Of course, they don't want you to leave. 'Please stay. Don't go away from us.' But it's important for them to see that we are working on each other because it's another job to cultivate.\"\n\nThe chef and the 46-year-old actor always make \"time for each other\", even if it just involves watching Netflix for a few hours when their schedules are busy.\n\nSpeaking to Us Weekly magazine, David added: \"Even if the kids fall asleep and we end up watching Netflix on the couch, that, we feel, is a connection because we're sharing something. Or just cuddling in the morning or bringing each other a cup of coffee. It's the little gestures that make up for the bigger stuff.\"\n\nMeanwhile, David and the 'How I Met Your Mother' star recently moved their family from Los Angeles to New York, and have said raising their twins in the Harlem neighbourhood has allowed them to immerse themselves in different \"cultures\".\n\nDavid said: \"[The best part is the] culture and energy and being engrossed in the world. When you live in Los Angeles, you're so isolated. You got in your car and you had to drive to the Asian park or the Hispanic park. [Here], everyone's so melted together.\""
