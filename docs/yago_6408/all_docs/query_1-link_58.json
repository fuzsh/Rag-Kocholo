Most important, The Contender has timing.\n\nJanuary 18, 2018\n\nSex, lies and politics--they all boil together beautifully in \"The Contender,\" a strong political drama that understands Washington, knows its dirty secrets, and uses its excellent cast to fine effect.\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\nPretty much shameless leftist propaganda being sold as conventional Hollywood entertainment, but it manages to satisfy on the traditional genre terms.\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\nThumps its Democratic Bible hard enough to put Jonathan Edwards to shame.\n\nSeptember 3, 2022"
