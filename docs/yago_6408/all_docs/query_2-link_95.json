        "text": "IT'S FITTING, FOR movie fans everywhere, that \"Awards Season,\" or \"the run up to the Oscars,\" or whatever you choose to call it, comes right after the holiday season. Because while some of us are keeping tabs on every film release all year long, wondering what might eventually make its way into award contention (and what might not), that conversation really starts to heat up once the new year sets in, and numerous awards ceremonies begin to take place.\n\nIt also helps, in the same way, that the very same \"Awards Season,\" is always a few months long. Once people start to figure out which movies are going to be part of the Oscar conversation, they can start to dial in on which to watch. Some of these movies are very weird! And that's a good thing, because the attention may just lead people to discover movies they never would've stumbled upon otherwise. Poor Things, which we'll start to talk about here, is a strange, re-imagined version of a Frankenstein story. That's just the start of it.\n\n2023 was one of the strongest years for film in quite a while, and that meant that a number of this year's major contenders were pretty clear for the majority of the year: Barbenheimer (the release of Barbie and Oppenheimer) was perhaps the cultural event of the year, and the two movies were clearly good enough to stick around to the very end of whatever ultimately happens. Killers of the Flower Moon, even before its release in October, was (correctly) hyped as a masterpiece collaboration between director Martin Scorsese and his two muses, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro.\n\nBut other movies always manage to work their ways into the conversation—and perhaps the most interesting one in 2023 is Poor Things.\n\nWhat is Poor Things about?\n\nOne of the very best—and oddest—films of 2023 is Poor Things, from eccentric Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos (who previously helmedThe Lobster, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, and The Favourite).\n\nBased on Alasdair Gray's , Poor Things tells the story of a woman named Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), who goes on a journey of learning to be both a human and, more specifically, a woman, after she died (and had the brain of her unborn baby put into her salvageable body by a kindly mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe). Along the way, she crosses paths with a number of men of differing character (played bv Mark Ruffalo, Ramy Youssef, and Jerrod Carmichael, among others), all of whom help to shape her into the best version of herself. Sounds weird, yes, but it works in its own strange way, we promise.\n\nPoor Things, is, essentially, the strangest—and most unique—take on Frankenstein you'll ever see.\n\nThe movie is nominated for 11 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress for Emma Stone, and Best Supporting Actor for Mark Ruffalo.\n\nWhere to Watch Poor Things\n\nDepending on where you are, Poor Things may still be playing in theaters. You can check where the movie is playing near you, and grab some tickets at the link below:\n\nBuy Poor Things Tickets Here\n\nThe movie is also available to buy:\n\nAnd, as of March 7, available to stream on both Hulu and Disney+:\n\nWhen will Poor Things be streaming?\n\nNow! Poor Things is available to stream on both Hulu and Disney+."
