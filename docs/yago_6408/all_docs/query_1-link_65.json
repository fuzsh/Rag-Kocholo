        "text": "A decent attempt, but in the end another reminder that Americans struggle to be truly cynical/realistic about how political power is exercised in their country. They try for hard edged realism, but that gooey patriotic optimism is always just below the surface of even those who proclaim themselves as possessing the toughest of hides. It's no surprise that two of the most successful skewerings of US politics of late have been Veep and House of Cards, both of which are British imports. In the UK the default position is that politicians are automatically suspect, and there is no romanticising of parliament and prime ministers in the way so many Americans still gush over Washington and the White House. Yeah Trump, but depending on who you ask he was either an aberration which has since been corrected for or a near perfect reflection of the original founders' vision for what the republic should be. On neither side are the real problems in the political system as well as American society at large really reckoned with. That's the cynicism-free optimism part, which is something we do admire the Yanks for, but from the outside we can also see its limitations.\n\nThat is not to say The Contender does have many admirable qualities, far from it. This is a film that tackles many serious subjects, it just happens that due to fumblings and a poor game plan it concedes a lot of points, but it deserves credit for at least trying. The setup is when second term Democratic president Jackson Evans' (Jeff Bridges) vice president suddenly dies he not only has to name a replacement as per the constitution, but in doing so will also be anointing his chosen successor as leader of the party and, potentially, the next commander in chief. The initial frontrunner is Virginia Governor Jack Hathaway (a rare but welcome big screen appearance for William Petersen), who has been thrust into the national spotlight thanks to a sort of reverse Chappaquiddick where he tried to save a young woman from drowning after a car accident. However President Evans decides, for some symbolic reasons but not exclusively, to select Ohio Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) to be his new number two, and then the film gets to what it is really about: the debates and double standards around the role of women in politics.\n\nHanson was written especially for Allen and despite being a decade and a half into her career, this was her first lead role, an upgrade from the usual \"concerned wife\" parts she was offered (such as First Lady Pat Nixon in Oliver Stone's 1995 film about RN). This is an interesting parallel to the way Hanson's story plays out in the film, where talent is so often not appreciated and recognised in women to the same extent it is in men. In the hearings Hanson's past, particularly her sexual adventures in college (including alleged photographs of her in most compromising positions) and her divorce and remarriage are brought up by the congressional committee. Would this same line of questioning be directed towards a male candidate? Probably not, or even if such things were raised, they wouldn't be that big of a deal. The thing about Laine is that nothing she did from partying in college to her first marriage falling apart is in any way strange or unusual for any regular woman or any person regardless of gender, but in the context of US politics these things seem to matter a lot. This is because not only the traditions of power but also because of the uniquely prudish society that is America. I mean the rest of the world moved on years ago, but they can't seem to get over the abortion thing (which the film also addresses) and before Trump sex scandals were almost always fatal to a career.\n\nThe Contender was conceived as something of a response to the Monica Lewinsky affair that had happened just a few years prior. This had illustrated so many of these problems in American society, such opprobrium and shame being heaped upon a woman in her early 20s for the \"crime\" of being attracted to a powerful and charismatic older man (something that many feminists consistently fail to understand about the whole affair: painting Clinton as some kind of manipulative abuser while not noticing they're actually denying an adult woman any autonomy over her own choices as well as who she might be attracted to). Yes, Bill lied to congress and was technically impeached for that, but it was really Republican revenge as well as fury that that the president was getting blow jobs in the Oval Office for free when all the repellent sourpusses in the House GOP would probably have to pay for such pleasures. One also sees echoes of Anita's Hill's treatment at the Clarence Thomas hearings in 1991 (interestingly chaired by then Senator and future President, Joe Biden), where a woman was grilled about her personal life by an all-male panel and the abuser suffered no consequences for his actions.\n\nIn addition to being a commentary on Washington in the 1990s, The Contender also turned out to be quite prophetic in a number of ways. Firstly there was the recent Katie Hill scandal in which a California congresswoman was forced to resign after details of her private life, including a divorce and nude photos, were leaked to the press. Once again the debate focused on whether women are held to a higher standard and are forgiven less than men, and the answer seems to be yes on both accounts. And quadruply so in the age of Trump. He can raw dog a porn star a few days after his wife had given birth and retain broad support from the Republican base, particularly the evangelical Christians who until 5 minutes ago used to insist that \"character counts\", but if there's even a hint that a grown woman might once have engaged in fellatio and enjoyed it, well she's clearly unfit for public office. Call that governor guy, he seems far more suitable because he has a dick rather than having ever sucked one, so clearly that makes him far more qualified.\n\nThen there is the fact that Laine Hanson is the daughter of a former Republican governor but switched parties before running for the Senate. While there was apparently more about this in the original script, the charge of nepotism hangs over her just as it has for many other politicians who the public take a set against for seeming to inherit rather than earn high office. Exhibit A: ex-Republican Hillary Clinton. You'd think a for self-proclaimed feminist being married to a philanderer like Bill would have proved intolerable, but what is left hanging and almost tacitly acknowledged is that her husband was her ticket to a political career of her own, so she stood by him. She then carpetbagged her way into the senate and then ran for president backed by her husband's old team and the Democratic Party establishment he had helped build up again after the dark years of the Reagan/Bush era. However this was denied by a young whippersnapper from Illinois who she was not at all happy to lose the nomination to, and even though it hasn't been confirmed I strongly suspect a deal was struck whereby if she would support him in 2008, when Obama's time had ended he would return the favour and throw the weight of the party behind her nomination. This would, of course, mean that his loyal Vice President, Joe Biden, would have to take one for the team, but such is the price of planned victory. Yet when 2016 rolled around, there were enough Americans who so objected not only to the steamrolling of Bernie Sanders but also to this strong whiff of entitlement emanating from team Hillary that they revolted, and her planned coronation did not occur. Sexism, some cried. Yes, I've no doubt that was a factor, but you can't say that was the only reason. Hillary has to accept responsibility for her own loss because of her deficiencies as a candidate and the sense she didn't really earn it, rather than blaming everything on gender.\n\nThis brings us to the most prominent female political figure in American history, Kamala Harris. Not the first woman vice presidential candidate, but unlike Geraldine Ferrero in 1984 or Sarah Palin in 2008, Joe Biden (who is clearly very important not only to the United States but also to this review) was actually leading in the polls and heading towards the White House when he tapped Kamala to be his running mate, and what was predicted in the movie occurred two decades after it was released. Even some of Biden's rhetoric about it being about damn time and that representation matters sounded like the Jeff Bridges' POTUS here, albeit less theatrical. What was pure Hollywood though was the idea that a president would nominate a VP candidate under the 25th Amendment without fully vetting them first, going through every moment of their personal history to identify any weakness or hint of scandal before the opposition dirt diggers could. What is noteworthy about Harris is how little scandal there is around her. Sure, she's made some unwise-to-stupid comments, but haven't we all. Not all of her policy ideas were brilliant but you can say that of every politician, even the great ones. And sure, her presidential campaign had been a dismal failure, but so had Joe's two previous ones so that's not a disqualifying factor. Harris' boring personal life with a late marriage, no divorce and no hint of impropriety was no doubt a factor in her selection. No one will ever admit this, but it's definitely something that would have been discussed within and minutely investigated by the Biden campaign.\n\nSo to (finally) bring this back around to talking about the movie, The Contender does get into the some of this stuff, but lacks the courage to really say something. The ending is quite a sellout as we are told nothing happened on the night in question, but a braver script would have admitted, yes she did participate in an orgy or a gangbang at college, but so what? Make the focus that hypocrisy between what the Brett Kavanaughs of this world are allowed to get away with compared to their female counterparts. Likewise, the big Frank Capra-esque address to Congress with the soaring music intercut with our heroine at Arlington, pass the fucking bucket, please. If you read up on real world American politics you'll find actual power players totally unmoved by some of the grandest and most inspiring speeches. Look at the Obama administration, lots of pretty words beautifully expressed, but very little progress. Meanwhile Joe Biden will never win a speechmaking trophy but he gets shit done.\n\nThe film is also very well acted. In addition to the names mentioned above, special mention must go to Gary Oldman as the antagonist/villain (and there's some controversy around this), because even in the most American of stories you need an Englishman for this sort of part. It was also great seeing a rare moustache-free performance from Sam Elliot as the White House chief of staff and Saul Rubinek as the press secretary (who had the previous year played Henry Kissinger in 1999's underrated comedy Dick). Finally, Christian Slater is here playing a first term congressmen from Delaware and I wasn't convinced by either his character or Slater's performance, but a lot of the could be the writing. In addition to being too sugary and Capra-esque, the screenplay also struggles to seem like authentic politico-talk while at the same time being accessible to non politics junkies, so there was a lot of exposition crammed in for the less informed viewers which made much of the dialogue seem phoney. It also lacked subtlety but I get that it's a movie and you need to set a lot of things up, but this was not the most elegant wordsmithing I've come across which did tend to detract from the emotional stakes as well as the plotting.\n\nThe Contender was nominated for two Oscars, for Allen and Bridges which I'll credit, amongst many other awards, although interestingly all were for acting, none for writing which confirms my prejudices. However like a lot of films made for grown ups it's been almost completely forgotten, which is a fate that awaits many of the movies which will feature tomorrow night when the Academy meets in the plague year. It's another one of those films that's more enjoyable to talk about than actually watch. If anyone has made it to the end of this political tirade, well you now have a sample of what some of my tutorials can be like when a student asks me to give a detailed answer; normally I change $100 an hour for this kind of stuff, but you guys are getting this analysis for free, hope you enjoyed it."
