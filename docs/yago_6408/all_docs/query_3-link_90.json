        "text": "Rod Lurie is an Israeli-American director, screenwriter and former film critic. Lurie's first foray into filmmaking, as writer and director, was the low-budget political thriller Deterrence (1999), with Kevin Pollak as the first Jewish President of the United States. The characters (in his films) of President Jackson Evans (The Contender), prison inmate Lt.\n\nGen. Eugene Irwin (The Last Castle), FBI agent Paige Van Doren (Line of Fire), and vice presidential nominee Gen. (ret.) Warren Keaton (Commander in Chief) are all fictional graduates of the \"Long Gray Line\"."
