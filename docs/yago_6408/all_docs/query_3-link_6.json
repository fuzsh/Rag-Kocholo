        "text": "Rod Lurie has worked as a soldier, an investigative reporter, a book author, a film critic, and of course, a critically-acclaimed screenwriter and director. He was already well known in the industry when he created his first film Deterrence, and exploded onto the scene with his second movie The Contender, in which he guided Joan Allen and Jeff Bridges to Academy Award nominations. Rod has also accomplished much in the television world, directing and writing shows such as “Line of Fire” and the much-lauded ABC TV series “Commander in Chief,” which won Geena Davis a Golden Globe."
