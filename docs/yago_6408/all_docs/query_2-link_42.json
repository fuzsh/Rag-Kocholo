        "meta_description": "A political thriller pumped up with as much dramatic juice as ''The Contender'' doesn't have to be believable to be gripping. If this lurid Washington yarn about a sex scandal that threatens to destroy the hand-picked nominee (Joan Allen) of the liberal President (Jeff Bridges) to fill a vacated vice presidential slot clanks with tin-eared oratory and preposterous plot turns, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Scenery-chewing performances by Gary Oldman (as the scrofulous, misogynist congressman who leads the smear campaign), Mr. Bridges as a Clinton-Johnson presidential amalgam and Ms. Allen as the dignified and high-principled nominee contribute to the fun. â€” Stephen Holden",

        "text": "A political thriller pumped with as much dramatic juice as ''The Contender'' doesn't have to be believable to be gripping. If it's realism you want, go rent the underappreciated ''Primary Colors.'' What makes this twisty, cautionary yarn, written and directed by Rod Lurie, delicious is a cast that chews the scenery with such obvious enjoyment that you're happy to put up with its tin-eared oratory and preposterous plot turns for the sake of a good ride.\n\nAnchoring that cast is Jeff Bridges as a perpetually noshing Bill Clinton-like president named Jackson Evans whose sudden yens for dishes like coq au vin are instantly gratified by a White House kitchen staff that, oddly enough, can't handle a request for a simple Muenster cheese sandwich. In a movie jampacked with food metaphors, this president, his eyes gleaming mischievously, inveigles a squeamish opponent into sharing a shark steak sandwich.\n\nAs the story opens, President Evans is scurrying to fill the slot of a vice president who died three weeks earlier. One of the two leading candidates, Jack Hathaway (William Petersen), is a senator from Virginia who has just become a national hero after a fortuitous accident that the movie portrays in its opening scene. While Hathaway is fishing with a reporter, a car plunges off an adjacent bridge. The young driver drowns, but not before Hathaway dives into the water and risks his life trying to save her.\n\nBut almost from the beginning there's something fishy about Jack. His wife, Fiona (Kristen Shaw), is an insanely ambitious, hysterical shrew. Jack is also given to murmuring politically incorrect no-no's like referring to a female assistant as ''my girl.''\n\nThe other candidate -- the one with the president's backing -- is Laine Hanson (Joan Allen), an Ohio senator and a daughter of a former governor. An outspoken abortion rights advocate and self-professed atheist who recently switched party alliances from Republican to Democrat, Hanson is attractive, poised and extremely well spoken, if a bit reserved. (Next to her even Hillary Rodham Clinton begins to seem almost down-home.) Hanson is happily married to her former campaign manager (Robin Thomas) and is the mother of a 6-year-old boy.\n\nWhen first seen, Hanson and her husband are making love just as the president calls and invites her to the White House. ''The Contender'' is so insistent on portraying Hanson as a sexual being that it later gives her an extremely silly and sexist declaration to the effect that a female president who isn't having sex regularly had better not have her finger anywhere near the nuclear trigger.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
