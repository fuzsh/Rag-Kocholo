        "text": "Background\n\nContender Films was the theatrical division of the Contender Entertainment Group formed in 2005 to distribute movies theatrically, mostly acquisitions.\n\nIn March 2009, Contender Films rebranded under the E1 Entertainment/eOne name, as with its parent company, and simply used the company's regular logos after that.\n\nLogo (2005-2009)\n\nVisuals: A blue skyline with the River Thames below, made up of some of London's recognizable buildings on the landmark side (including the London Eye, BT Tower, and the Gherkin) wipes into view. Then, an orange 5-pointed star with a ring surrounding it rises beyond the wheel as the camera zooms in, passing by all the buildings. The star's ray eventually overtake the entire screen and it flashes white, before the light collapses into the letters \"C\", on a scratchy red-orange circle, with moving patterns, on a white background. Below, \"CONTENDER\", with \"FILMS\" under it, fade in.\n\nTechnique: CGI by Fletcher Wilson.\n\nAudio: An ascending tune, followed by a majestic orchestral fanfare. The fanfare was composed and performed by the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nAvailability: It was featured on many theatrical movies from the company such as British prins of New Police Story, Twilight (the home media release does not feature this logo as it came out after the rebranding to E1 Entertainment) and The Escapist."
