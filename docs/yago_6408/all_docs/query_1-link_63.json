        "text": "This must be the last Washington film from the Clinton era to come gurgling out of the pipeline: an era in which an ostensibly liberal Hollywood elite backed Bill not merely with cash and cachet, but remarkably with actual movies featuring Clinton-alikes in more or less flattering romantic/action hero roles: Michael Douglas in The American President, Harrison Ford in Air Force One, Bill Pullman in Independence Day, John Travolta in Primary Colors and Martin Sheen in TV's cutesy The West Wing.\n\nThe Contender has another quasi-Bill in the form of Jeff Bridges, a middle-aged but credibly fanciable and dishy Democratic president coming to the end of his second term. (The script refers to the real Clinton's impeachment, so the film is presumably set around 2007 or 2008; writer-director Rod Lurie clearly conceived his movie at a time when a Democratic successor to Clinton was considered a shoo-in.) Anyway, the prez is looking around for a \"swan song\", a progressive achievement to bookend his administration. He hits on appointing a woman vice-president when the male incumbent dies; his choice is Senator Laine Hanson - played with steely poise and presence by Joan Allen.\n\nBut her appointment is undermined by the villainous politician Sheldon Runyon, played by Gary Oldman, also the picture's executive producer. Where Bridges is a noble soul with a full head of glossy hair, Oldman plays a balding misogynist and dirty-trick specialist who thinks nothing of dragging up Laine's supposed sexual past to destroy her. (As a woman-hating slaphead, Sheldon is like Richard Dreyfuss's nasty Republican in The American President. As an all-round bad guy, he is like the Russian terrorist in Air Force One, played by Gary Oldman.)\n\nRunyon displays his villainy by chairing the Congressional committee instituted to ratify Senator Hanson; he feeds stories to the press about her alleged group-sex gang-bang orgies as an 18-year-old co-ed. Then he ferociously questions her about them. Before our very eyes, he turns into Joe McCarthy, while Joan Allen turns into Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons. Instead of denying the stories, she refuses to dignify this filth with a response - and all the president's men look like leaving her to twist in the wind.\n\nLurie's film is watchable enough, with kangaroo-court witch trial scenes that owe a good deal to John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate. There's a top-notch performance from Allen, and Bridges is great as the president who visibly adores charming, intimidating and discomfiting people with the trappings of office: particularly in one scene in which he meets an idealistic young congressman, played by Christian Slater, and insists he shares some of his (symbolic) lunch - shark-steak sandwich.\n\nBut this isn't a tough, wised-up political thriller; this is a movie puffed up with chest-busting sentimental pride at its own heroic liberalism. It actually has some extremely quaint and conservative assumptions about modern sexual politics. Moreover, its key plot denouement is the silliest cop-out I have seen in years. It is so lame that I at first thought it was a devilishly cynical fabrication to be itself unmasked in some post-credit twist.\n\nBut no. The Contender is a movie in which we are invited to applaud, as a feminist breakthrough, a powerful man being so good as to give a woman a job: the vice-presidency. She is not shown earning this job at the ballot-box, still less on the basis of winning anything so boring as a political argument. And in the political landscape shown here, Joan Allen is weirdly the only important woman. Senator Hillary Clinton isn't mentioned; neither is Madeleine Albright.\n\nOne powerful woman who does get a couple of name-checks, however, is our very own Margaret Thatcher, a woman whom Hanson piously rejects as a role model in favour of Thomas Jefferson. Nasty old Sheldon Runyon disses Maggie as well: the world accepted her, he sneers, \"because she was answerable to Ronald Reagan\". Well, yes, she (and we) certainly crawled to Ron very humiliatingly indeed. But the British voters and the parliamentary Conservative Party who put her in office were not, as it happens, answerable to Ronald Reagan. So how naive and parochial is that remark supposed to be?\n\nWhat sinks The Contender in the end is its mealy mouthed spirit of bipartisanship. Allen's martyred heroine is supposed to be a one-time Republican (though we never hear the least thing about any former rightwing views) and Lurie hasn't even got the guts to make Oldman an out-and-out reactionary bad guy. Apparently nervous of admitting the existence of straightforward evil, Lurie gives Oldman a tearful scene in which his wife reminds him how he once introduced legislation against \"hate crime\" - a deeply unconvincing hint that his actions are some kind of tragic character flaw.\n\nThe dead hand of reassuring consensus settles on the movie long before the end. For a really sabre-toothed account of political misogyny and the war-zone in sexual politics, you have to go to Neil LaBute's In the Company of Men or Alexander Payne's Election. This is just affirmative action for liberals."
