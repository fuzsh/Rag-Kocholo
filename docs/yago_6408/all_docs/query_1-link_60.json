        "text": "Rich Rosendale\n\nRich Rosendale is the award-winning chef and founder of Rosendale Collective. This is the innovative company behind Rich Rosendale’s consulting, private dining, restaurant partnerships, and training services. From D.C. to Dubai, Rich creates customized experiences, and business solutions with and attention to detail that is unmatched.\n\nHe also is a Certified Master Chef, a distinction earned through the American Culinary Federation. The grueling 130-hour cooking exam, held at the Culinary Institute of America, has a 90% fail rate and only 67 chefs have ever made it through successfully—Rich being the youngest to ever pass the exam. The Exam is detailed in the book “Soul of a Chef” which takes readers through this culinary marathon that few dare to take.\n\nThe Bocuse d'Or is considered the most demanding five-hour cooking competition in the world. Rich mentored and trained with top chefs from around the country, including Thomas Keller, Daniel Boulud, and Grant Achatz. Rich was the USA Champion and earned the right to represent the United States in Lyon, France, where he competed against 22 other countries. He finished in the top third of the field. Few chefs ever have the opportunity to cook at this level. Rich has competed in over 55 international cooking competitions.\n\nRich can be seen every Saturday morning on CBS where he, host Evette Rios, and chef Vikki Krinsky rehab a family’s unhealthy dish to create something that is delicious, nutritional and easy to make.\n\nRich has cooked for Presidents, foreign dignitaries and celebrities around the world. His favorite meals are with his family. Rich and his wife Laura are the parents of three children--Laurence, Liam, and Francesca.\n\nCorey Siegel\n\nCorey Siegel is from Albany, NY, and began cooking at the age of 14. As a student he was a serious member of the American Culinary Federation, and in 2008 began training at the Culinary Institute of America. During his time at school, he worked at Westchester Country Club in Rye, NY. Corey won the Northeast Regional Student Chef of the Year for the ACF in 2010. Corey joined the team at The Greenbrier in West Virginia in 2010, and enrolled in an intense three-year apprenticeship program at the resort overseen by Chef Richard Rosendale. In 2011 Corey was selected by Chef Rosendale to be his Commis for the Bocuse d’Or USA Finals and won the competition in January 2012. While finishing his senior year of the apprenticeship, he and Chef Rosendale devotedly trained to compete in the Bocuse d’Or in January 2013 held in Lyon, France. Receiving over 17 medals competing both nationally and internationally, Corey is also the youngest member of ACF Culinary Team USA to compete in the Culinary Olympics in Erfurt, Germany in 2016!"
