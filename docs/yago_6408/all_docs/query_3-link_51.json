        "text": "In Brief: An interesting 20-minutes with The Outpost director Rod Lurie.\n\nRod Lurie is the director of The Outpost. He’s also done several other quality films. Among them are The Last Castle, Nothing but the Truth, Resurrecting the Champ, and one of my all-time favorite Jeff Bridges performances, The Contender.\n\nI spoke with Lurie for about 30-minutes twice. One recording didn’t take so he generously gave me a second 30-minutes. Both conversations were fascinating. Also look at the bottom of the page for my review of The Outpost.\n\nClick here to see the interview.\n\nClick here to read my review of The Outpost.\n\nYou can find The Outpost on a number of streaming sources.\n\nGary Wolcott has been reviewing movies on radio, television and newspaper since 1990. He believes — and this is an estimate only — that he’s seen something close to 10,000 movies in his lifetime. Gary is a lifelong fan of films and catches a couple of hundred movies a year. He believes movies ought to be seen on the big screen and not on the small screen in your living room or family room. While he loves movies, he also says reviewing film can be a real sacrifice and that he sees many movies so you don’t have to.\n\nHe is one of KXL 101.1 FM’s film critics and joined the news staff in 2014. Gary is also the film critic for Tri-Cities, Washington’s Tri-City Herald."
