Also with Jeff Bridges, Sam Elliott, Christian Slater, Mariel Hemingway, Kristen Shaw, William L. Petersen, Philip Baker Hall, Saul Rubinek, Mike Binder and Robin Thomas. [2:06]\n\nSEX/NUDITY 8 - Kissing, sometimes passionately. Lots of sexual innuendo, including references to multiple partner sex, pedophilia, homosexuality, genitalia, and anal sex. There's one sex scene that is replayed a few times throughout the film involving a woman having sex with two men, in front of a group of people: One man is having intercourse with the woman from behind while she is performing fellatio on another man; we see the woman's bare buttocks and breasts and the woman's head on the man's crotch while she performs fellatio on him. We see a handful of pictures of the aforementioned scene as well. A woman discusses touching a man's penis. We hear several sex sounds coming from a man and a woman either kissing passionately or having sex. We see part of a man's bare buttocks (he's wearing a jacket but no pants).\n\nVIOLENCE/GORE 3 - A car flies off a bridge and into a lake; the driver is trapped inside the car and dies.\n\nLANGUAGE 9 - About 32 F-words, some anatomical references, many scatological references, some mild obscenities, several religious obscenities, many insults.\n\nDISCUSSION TOPICS - Politics, manipulation, multiple partner sex, infidelity, adultery, abortion, death, lying, integrity, malice.\n\nMESSAGE - A person's private life (especially sex life) should be left private because it has little to do with one's ability to serve one's country.\n\nCAVEATS\n\nBe aware that while we do our best to avoid spoilers it is impossible to disguise all details and some may reveal crucial plot elements.\n\nWe've gone through several editorial changes since we started covering films in 1992 and older reviews are not as complete & accurate as recent ones; we plan to revisit and correct older reviews as resources and time permits.\n\nOur ratings and reviews are based on the theatrically-released versions of films; on video there are often Unrated, Special, Director's Cut or Extended versions, (usually accurately labelled but sometimes mislabeled) released that contain additional content, which we did not review.\n\nREVIEWS\n\nSee ratings & reviews at Critics.com\n\nFILTER by RATINGS\n\nDid you know you can now filter searches by any combination of ratings? Just go to our search page or use the search bar, with or without a keyword, from the top navigation menu. Move sliders from 0-10 in any combination, check and uncheck MPAA ratings and use keywords to further filter results -- please let us know what you think.\n\nTHE ASSIGNED NUMBERS\n\nUnlike the MPAA we do not assign one inscrutable rating based on age but 3 objective ratings for SEX/NUDITY, VIOLENCE/GORE & LANGUAGE on a scale of 0 to 10, from lowest to highest depending on quantity & context |more|\n\nFIND US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFollowFollow\n\nFollowFollow\n\nadvertisement\n\nCOPYRIGHT POLICY\n\nPrint a page, share with friends, and yes, please go ahead and email links.
