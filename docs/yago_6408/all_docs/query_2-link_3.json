It suffers from some problems, most of which center around its somewhat sentimental final act, but as a whole, the film offers a solid and compelling story.  Starring Joan Allen, Gary Oldman.

        "text": "Reviewed by Colin Jacobson (March 13, 2024)\n\nWith another presidential campaign in action, it felt like a good time to look at a film related to politics. While not connected to an election, 2000âs The Contender deals with contentious issues related to elected officials.\n\nAfter the recent death of the Vice President, Democratic President Jackson Evans (Jef Bridges) needs a successor. The obvious choice - Virginia Governor Jack Hathaway (William Petersen) - doesnât get the nod for some amusing reasons, and President Evans (Jeff Bridges) turns to a less well-known selection: Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen).\n\nThis wonât go smoothly, as Republican Congressman Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) fights against Laineâs appointment, largely to get back at Evans for prior conflicts. As Laineâs life becomes tabloid fodder, she fights to stay above the fray and earn her new position.\n\nThe Contender fits the mold of a thriller in a loose manner. Thereâs no action, and itâs not like thereâs a killer out in the woods or anything.\n\nHowever, it seems more tense and taut than a pure drama would be, so I think it does qualify as a thriller. The various twists and turns taken by the plot make it moderately nerve-wracking at times, and I remained interested throughout the majority of the film.\n\nUntil the last 30 minutes or so, that is, when the plot devices overwhelm the structure. What had been a rich, serious piece becomes overly mawkish and seemed too concerned with unusual twists.\n\nI donât want to go into the details of what happens, but the final act tries too hard to resolve matters neatly without any thought for the plot that came before it. The tone shifts fairly radically, as All the Presidentâs Men suddenly becomes Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.\n\nThatâs not a slam on the latter film, but I mention it just to demonstrate the tonal shift. I still like The Contender, but I find the finale to be less than satisfying.\n\nHowever, the high quality of the preceding 90 minutes or so makes up for the endingâs flaws. Much of the reason for this stems from the uniformly excellent performances.\n\nThe Contenderâs two Oscar nods came for its actors, as both Allen and Bridges received nominations. Allen proved herself to be a consistently excellent actress, and her portrayal of the senator becomes no exception.\n\nAllen makes the character well-rounded at all times. Hanson seems appropriately hard-edged but not in the nasty Hollywood bitch mode thatâs so prevalent.\n\nWhen Hanson takes the moral stand and refuses to discuss her private business, Allen avoids excessive emotion and makes sure the character doesnât seem smug or self-righteous. Itâs a terrific performance that lends the movie a strong grounding in reality.\n\nEven better is Bridgesâ wonderful supporting turn as the president. He virtually steals every scene in which he appears as he uses his limited screen time to create an indelible portrait of a political animal.\n\nItâs tough to play the president as anything other than statesman. We never see how a president behaves behind closed doors, so itâs all speculation.\n\nI think Bridges provides as believable an account of the non-public president that Iâve seen. Heâs wonderfully human but still serious and he shows realistic tones.\n\nBridges also offers some of the filmâs best comic moments, which become gently inserted into the action. These bits - including a running gag in which Evans tries to stump the ultra-stocked White House kitchen - donât come across as simple relief, as they fit snugly into the structure of the movie and never appeared gratuitous or forced.\n\nI think Bridgesâ performance becomes responsible for much of the neat integration, as the characterâs changes in tone and mood flow effortlessly. His cool, slick and rich portrayal of the president ends up as one of the best presentations of a politician Iâve seen.\n\nAs Runyon, Oldman again hides himself under a layer of make-up. Heâs not quite unrecognizable, but he certainly looks different in the role.\n\nI like Oldman, and I think he does well in the part, but I must admit the Lon Chaney routine grew a little old.\n\nOne positive aspect of The Contender is that it tries to discuss sexual double-standards usually without becoming heavy-handed. Other than some mildly emotional testimonials toward the end of the movie - which feature some excessively-emotive music - the flick stays surprisingly cool and objective.\n\nHowever, I disagree with some of its theories. For one, weâre told that had a man engaged in the activities of which Laine stands accused that no one would have cared.\n\nI donât think thatâs really the case. If a male screwed a bunch of women in public at a frat party and there were pictures of it in circulation, I think itâd cause a huge uproar.\n\nYeah, Clinton got away with lots of indiscretions. However, we never saw photographic images of Monica Lewinsky - or the others - at work.\n\nHansonâs alleged escapade wasnât about the number of partners per se, which is how the characters discuss it. No oneâs upset because sheâs had sex with more than one or two people in her life.\n\nThe issue relates to the impression that she was with a few guys at a time and really went over the top. I agree that there is a double-standard for women when it comes to sex.\n\nBehavior that makes a man a âstudâ portrays a woman as a âslutâ. However, a frat party gang-bang performed in front of a crown is a totally different issue.\n\nActually, the film largely ignores a topic that I think would have derailed Hansonâs career much more firmly than college sexcapades: her atheism. She clearly acknowledges that she doesnât believe in God, which remains something of a kiss of death for national politicians.\n\nThe idea of an atheist Vice President - a heartbeat away from the presidency - would send many folks into a tizzy. Theyâd oppose that selection extremely strongly.\n\nI can accept an atheist governor or senator in a liberal state, and I can definitely see an atheist in lower office such as the House of Representatives or local government. However, in this day and age, it find it extremely hard to accept that an atheist would stand a chance in hell of getting anywhere near the vice presidency.\n\nWriter/director Rod Lurie should have left out any mentions of her religious status. They have no bearing on the story and simply make it less realistic.\n\nActually, that raises another small problem I had with The Contender that detracted from its believability. Although the film seems to take place in the present day of its 2000 release, we hear mention of the Clinton presidency.\n\nSince President Evans nears the end of his second term - he has about 18 months to go - this means that the movie canât take place any sooner than 2007. However, Evans at one point mentions that weâve entered the new millennium.\n\nGranted, considering the length of a millennium, it still wouldâve been pretty fresh in another seven years after this flickâs release. However, no one continued to call it ânewâ in 2007.\n\nThe mention of Clinton seemed surprising, since Evans feels like a stand-in for Clinton in many ways, as both are relatively young, aggressive political animals. However, the film wants to discuss Clinton so it can focus on the sexual double-standard, and weâre told how Clintonâs approval rating went up after his scandals.\n\nUnfortunately, the iffy timeline makes the movie less convincing. I recognize that this may seem like nit-picking, but I donât think it is.\n\nUltimately, the time confusion creates a story that comes across as less solidly-grounded in reality. These discrepancies tended to take me out of the story.\n\nDespite the variety of flaws about which Iâve harped, I really do like The Contender. They donât make many movies like this anymore, and thatâs a shame."
