        "text": "Riad al-Turk, Syria's most outspoken dissident, ticks off the roughly one-third of his life spent as a political prisoner: 13 months under the current president, Bashar al-Assad, a whopping 18 years in solitary confinement under Mr. Assad's late father and sundry years or months stretching almost back to independence in 1946.\n\nNow, like everyone in the Middle East, he has a new political factor to consider: the United States military, setting up next door in Iraq as the latest occupying power.\n\nLike many Syrians, he is horrified, yet he -- like other government critics -- also recognizes that the welcome toppling of Saddam Hussein, if handled right, may push the kind of political and economic opening that they have sought for decades.\n\n''Iraq had a bloodier system -- when we compare the number of victims here to the number in Iraq, it had many, many more,'' said Mr. Turk, 73. ''But in substance they are the same.''\n\nAfter Mr. Hussein's swift collapse, President Bush and senior administration officials sought to capitalize on the new American presence in the region by warning other Middle Eastern governments that Washington seeks change.\n\nSyria rapidly attracted Washington's ire. The Bush administration was angered by the prospect that Damascus would grant safe haven to Mr. Hussein or his fleeing aides, right after it let hundreds of Arab volunteers pour into Iraq to fight the Americans and supposedly helped Baghdad acquire banned items like night vision goggles.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
