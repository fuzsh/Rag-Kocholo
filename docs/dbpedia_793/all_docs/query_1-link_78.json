        "text": "Five years have passed and the Syrian people are still living with the repercussions of the ongoing war. One of the most notable consequences of this war is Syrians’ attitudes towards each other. The continuing conflict has accentuated the magnitude of the schisms between Syrians of different backgrounds, caused by the mismanagement of cultural diversity. The importance of this survey lies in asking key questions about the possibility of coexistence and common values that unite Syrians after the extensive violations that have occurred. Despite the fact that this survey was developed in the context of urging a sample of individuals who are classified as active in their communities to think more about the values of coexistence and acceptance of others, in some way its results reflect the general attitude and values rooted in the communities to which these individuals belong. This survey primarily aimed to analyse Syrians’ attitudes about: Urgent priorities to achieve community security. Attitudes regarding the participation of others in local and national peace processes. Attitudes towards the scope of the common ties that bind all Syrians. Level of hope in peace-building and the ability to participate in decision-making. Attitudes towards the need to include women in decision-making. This survey does not intend to identify Syrians’ perspectives so much as to stimulate socially active people to think about the future of Syria. It is not a systematic survey, nor is the selection of its sample representative of Syrian society as a whole. However, this survey provides a picture, albeit generalised, of the prevailing views in Syrian society four years since the start of the Syrian revolution in 2011. It should be noted that this survey was administered in two phases: the first of which took place in November 2014 and the second in April 2015. The survey concluded that the priorities of achieving community security for the survey sample begin with: securing basic human needs, cease-fires, releasing detainees, avoiding probable conflicts, solving problems between different parties, peace-building initiatives at the local level, releasing the kidnapped, controlling arms and raising awareness. These demands vary according to the conditions of different regions. When the research sample was asked about the issue of accepting others to build the future Syria, 79 percent agreed that others should be accepted and 70 percent indicated that there is an identity that unites Syrians. When asked whether there are shared values among Syrians, 57 percent of the sample answered that there are still common values that unite Syrians. As for the level of hope, 54 percent of the sample replied that they still have hope to reach stability. In terms of including women, 72 percent answered that women should be included in decision-making. What drew the researcher’s attention was that the results of the surveys, which targeted two samples of active community members, were similar, showing that this population shares a general attitude towards peace-building, acceptance of others and local demands to achieve peace. Based on these similar results we should re-examine the assumption that what divides Syrians is more than what unites them after all of the violations, and we should ask real questions about the formation of a new Syrian identity: What is this new identity? The military and political polarisations taking place on the ground, accompanied by massive human rights violations, through which the legacy of violations against Syrians prior to 2011 becomes clear, and also the nature of this identity in the future, require more research. Nevertheless, the final conclusion taken from the results of this survey is that we can rely upon the level of hope among Syrians to build a comprehensive peace that includes all of Syria’s diverse communities and regions, since what unites Syrians is much greater than what divides them, if the human rights violations are halted."
