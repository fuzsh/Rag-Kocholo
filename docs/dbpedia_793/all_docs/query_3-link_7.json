        "text": "Syrias ruling Baath party, headed by embattled President Bashar al-Assad, has replaced its leadership, the states Syrian Arab News Agency announced on 9 July. With the exception of Al-Assad as the partys secretary-general, all 16 members have been changed.\n\nVice-president Farouk al-Sharaa, who has criticised the regimes military actions and advocated a political compromise with the opposition, is among the leaders who have been removed from their posts. Since the beginning of the civil conflict in 2011, Al-Sharaa has rarely been seen in public, fuelling rumours that he may be under house arrest.\n\nThe move follows the election of a new president of the Syrian National Coalition, which is formed of Syrian opposition groups. On 6 July, its members chose Saudi-linked Ahmad Jarba as their new leader.\n\nSyrian troops and rebels are currently fighting in Homs, a strategic, rebel-held city located between Damascus and the Syrian coast, while UN secretary Ban Ki-moon has called for a truce during the Islamic month of Ramadan, which this year runs from early July to early August, urging the parties to lay down their weapons for the month.\n\nInternational leaders are proposing a peace conference to be held later this year, which has been postponed several times due to uncertainty and disagreements over attendance by regime and opposition leaders."
