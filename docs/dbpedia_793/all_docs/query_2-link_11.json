        "text": "Question: Which Middle East country has been accused\n\nby Washington of providing support to terrorists and developing\n\nWMD?\n\nLet us provide the reader with some clues: this country has a\n\nreputation for its rather conspicuous antagonism toward Israel, and\n\nhas been ruled for several decades under the singularly cruel\n\nauthoritarian regime of the pan-Arabic Socialist Baath party.\n\nIf your guess is Iraq under Saddam Hussein, you would not be\n\nmistaken. But the country I have in mind is Syria, which also\n\nperfectly fits the above description. At the height of the Iraq\n\nmilitary campaign American leaders began to issue strong warnings\n\nto Damascus. Following the occupation of Baghdad, the rhetoric\n\nintensified. The U.S. Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld,\n\nsuggested that Saddam Hussein’s associates had found shelter in\n\nSyria. Congressmen Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,\n\nR-Fla., said they would seek action on legislation authorizing\n\nPresident Bush to punish Syria through curbs on exports and the\n\nsale of equipment with military use, and restrictions on Syrian\n\ndiplomats’ travel in the United States. “Now that Saddam Hussein’s\n\nregime is on the precipice of defeat, it is time for America to get\n\nserious about Syria,” Engel said.\n\nIs this a signal that the Syrian regime may be the next target\n\nin the U.S. crusade against ’the axis of evil?’\n\n“The paradise of the East and a source of bright and shining\n\nbeauty, it is an embodiment of all Islamic countries that we have\n\nvisited; a bride among the towns that we saw,” Ibn Djubair, an Arab\n\npilgrim of the 12th century, wrote about Damascus. The town made an\n\nindelible impression on the traveler: “By God! Right are those who\n\nsay, ’If the Heaven is on the earth, Damascus is surely in it; if\n\nit is in the sky, Damascus is its twin’.” Describing numerous\n\nshrines of Damascus, Ibn Djubair exclaimed: “The almighty Allah\n\nsave it, the abode of Islam!”\n\nCairo, Damascus and Baghdad represent three historical landmarks\n\nof the Arab East. Iraq, the successor state of ancient Assyria and\n\nBabylon, and the center of the Muslim world in the days of the\n\nAbbassid caliphs, ranks third in an unofficial regional\n\n“hierarchy.” Iraq is preceded by Egypt and Syria – the “head” and\n\nthe “heart,” as Arabs refer to them respectively. Egypt has always\n\nbeen a flagship country among the Arabs, exceeding them in terms of\n\npopulation, as well as through its economic, military and cultural\n\npotential. Meanwhile, the ideology of pan-Arabism, which aims to\n\nstrengthen Arab unity, was founded in Syria.\n\nThe pan-Arabic Socialist Baath party first appeared in Damascus\n\nin 1947; the Iraqi branch emerged later. The party mottoes are\n\n“Unity, freedom, socialism” and “A single Arab nation destined to\n\naccomplish an immortal mission.” Its dynamism, centralized\n\nstructure and tough discipline were appealing to white-collar\n\nworkers, the middle class, and young people. So was its ideological\n\nblend of anti-imperialism, liberation and Arab nationalism which\n\ninterweaved itself into the social mission of fighting depravity,\n\npromoting justice, and binding the disunited Arab countries into a\n\nsingle powerful state.\n\nInitially, Baath enjoyed the reputation of a pan-Arabic party\n\ngoverned from two regional centers in Syria and Iraq. In 1963, the\n\nSyrian Baath party seized power in a military coup in Damascus. In\n\n1968 a local branch of the international Baath party came to power\n\nin Iraq. This resulted in not just an estrangement between the two\n\nBaath parties, but to an actual upsurge of animosity.\n\nThe common ideology did not prevent the Iraqi Baath party\n\nmembers from labeling their Syrian colleagues “adventurers that\n\nusurped the glorious name of our party.” The latter returned the\n\ncriticism in kind.\n\nThe confrontation between the two Baath parties was fueled by\n\ntwo factors. First, since the end of World War II, both Syria and\n\nIraq have proclaimed themselves the dominant power in the region.\n\nAt one time, both countries nourished hopes of unifying the Arab\n\nstates, specifically Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, though pursuing\n\nultimately different agendas: Damascus dreamt of a ’Great Syria,’\n\nwhile Baghdad proposed to re-establish the glory of the Fertile\n\nCrescent. Secondly, the strained relations between the two national\n\nbranches were further aggravated by the mutual dislike between\n\ntheir respective leaders. It was a pro-Syrian conspiracy, allegedly\n\norganized in Iraq’s Baath party, that Saddam used as a pretext for\n\nlaunching a purge of fellow party members in 1979, which helped him\n\ngain the presidency of Iraq.\n\nSyria’s Hafez al-Assad and Saddam Hussein of Iraq were both\n\ncharismatic leaders who had much in common. They both consolidated\n\ntheir grip on power in the 1970s, and each coveted the role of the\n\npan-Arab leadership following the death of Egyptian President Gamal\n\nAbdel Nasser in 1970. And both failed.\n\nThe personal dislike between Assad and Hussein partially\n\naccounts for Damascus’ decision to join the U.S.-led coalition\n\nagainst Iraq, as well as supporting Operation Desert Storm in 1991,\n\nalthough Syrian troops never actually engaged in military action.\n\nThe reputable American orientalist, Fouad Adjami makes the point in\n\nthe Foreign Affairs magazine that Egyptian and Syrian participation\n\nin this campaign greatly promoted the cause of the U.S. since\n\nHussein could no longer “depict the struggle as a standoff between\n\nthe haves and the have-nots in the Arab world.” In return, Damascus\n\nreaped substantial economic dividends, but fell short of becoming\n\nWashington’s partner.\n\nSyria has adopted an extremely tough stance toward Israel.\n\n(Unlike Egypt, which has long regained its formerly\n\nIsraeli-occupied Sinai Peninsula, Syria is still far from securing\n\nits Golan Heights, which Israel seized following the Six Day War in\n\n1967.) Moreover, Damascus backs the radical Islamic movement\n\nHezbollah which launches attacks on Israel from Lebanese territory.\n\nSyria’s intractable position has always been a source of contention\n\nby the influential pro-Israeli lobby in the U.S.\n\nThe expectations that Bashar, Hafez Assad’s son who succeeded\n\nhis deceased father in 2000, would look to the West for support\n\nproved to be wrong. On the contrary, during the latest Iraqi\n\ncampaign initiated by Washington Damascus was most firm in its\n\nresolve to side with Iraq (incidentally, Syria was the only Arab\n\ncountry on the U.N. Security Council during the crisis). On the one\n\nhand, now that Assad Jr. is in office, the shadow of the former\n\nhostility which hung over the past relations between his father and\n\nSaddam Hussein has largely disappeared between the two countries.\n\nOn the other hand, the young Syrian president must demonstrate that\n\nhe follows in the footsteps of his father who was renowned for his\n\nhardline anti-imperialist policies. Thus, Damascus allowed\n\nirregular forces of volunteers who wished to reinforce the Iraqi\n\ntroops to cross its borders unopposed. Moreover, Washington accused\n\nDamascus of providing military assistance to Iraq; U.S. Secretary\n\nof Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, alleged that night-vision equipment\n\nwas entering Iraqi territory via Syria.\n\nDamascus has grounds to fear a U.S. strike. Although Syria was\n\nnot depicted as a member of the ’axis of evil,’ it nevertheless has\n\nfound a place on the U.S. State Department’s black list of states\n\nsponsoring terrorism. Almost one year ago, Tom DeLay, the\n\nRepublican majority leader in the U.S. House of Representatives,\n\nspoke of the necessity of waging war on Saddam Hussein. He provided\n\neight criteria for pre-emptive military action against any\n\nparticular state: sponsorship of terrorism, accumulating weapons of\n\nmass destruction, violating WMD agreements, aggression, attacking\n\nand threatening Israel, domestic murder and terror, religious and\n\nethnic persecution, thwarting democracy. American observers\n\nimmediately counted seven criteria that apply to Syria (with\n\nreligious and ethnic persecution excluded), that is, if one bases\n\nhis judgment on the official documents issued by the U.S. State\n\nDepartment and CIA reports on human rights and WMD\n\nnon-proliferation.\n\nYet, it won’t be easy for the Bush administration to argue the\n\ncase to the American public that Syria poses a direct threat to the\n\nU.S. and the wider world. Saddam’s image as a serial aggressor has\n\nbeen successfully drilled into the American psyche, reinforced by\n\nhis two invasions against neighboring countries, rocket shelling of\n\nIsrael and the use of poisonous gases against Iraq’s own Kurdish\n\npopulation. But President Assad of Syria does not remotely approach\n\nthe rather abysmal record of Saddam Hussein, therefore should the\n\ncampaign spill over into neighboring Syria, it will be very\n\ndifficult to justify.\n\nThere can be little doubt that Israel will enthusiastically\n\nwelcome such a showdown with Syria. But international sympathies\n\nwill most assuredly lie with Syria. If the U.S. attacks Syria in\n\nthe wake of its Iraqi occupation, this will cause such a tremendous\n\ngroundswell of outrage that even most pro-American Mideast\n\ngovernments will have to distance themselves from the U.S. due to\n\nsheer self-preservation. Furthermore, such an event would undermine\n\nthe 50-year long effort of the U.S. to increase its influence in\n\nthe region. It will also draw protests from Russia, Damascus’ old\n\npolitical partner, not to mention the European Union which has\n\nrecently recognized Syria as a “new neighbor,” that is, the EU’s\n\nadjoining nation entitled to enjoy special relationship with it.\n\nThese considerations lead us to believe that Baghdad will be the\n\nterminal point in the U.S. crusade in the Middle East. Especially\n\nconsidering that Syria boasts no huge oil reserves.\n\nHowever, the end of the military campaign does not mean that the\n\nU.S. is giving up its plans to change the Mideast regimes: the\n\nmission of the Iraqi campaign, as described by President Bush, is\n\nto instigate the process of democratic change in the entire region.\n\nFouad Adjami calls on America’s “spearheading of a reformist\n\nproject that seeks to modernize and transform the Arab landscape.\n\nIraq would be the starting point, and beyond Iraq lies an Arab\n\npolitical and economic tradition and a culture whose agonies and\n\nfailures have been on cruel display.” “Returning their government\n\nto the people of Iraq would signal democratic reformers around the\n\nregion that the United States is deeply committed to expanding\n\nfreedom,” says DeLay.\n\nLast year, prominent American analysts Ronald Asmus and Kenneth\n\nPollak came up with a “new transatlantic project:” “We must make an\n\nequally firm commitment to a political strategy that would help\n\ntransform the Middle East itself. It would mean changing the nature\n\nof the anti-Western regimes… It would mean a new form of\n\ndemocracy.”\n\nThis goal is utopian since the Arab world knows no democratic\n\nregimes and even its pro-Western ruling elites will not agree to\n\nget involved in this process, as it is sure to cut the ground out\n\nfrom under their feet. It may be assumed that U.S. policies in the\n\nregion will hardly affect Saudi Arabia and Egypt (although calls\n\nfor their democratization are becoming more frequently pronounced\n\nin the U.S.), whereas Syria may come under tremendous political\n\npressure.\n\nIt is noteworthy that from this perspective Syria’s situation is\n\neven worse than that of Iran, an ’axis of evil’ state, which,\n\naccording to the U.S., builds up weapons of mass destruction and\n\nlends support to anti-Israeli extremists. However, today the\n\nIranian regime is going through a unique transformation: the\n\nmilitant phase of the ’Islamic revolution’ is giving way to a more\n\nmoderate and liberal regime personified by President Mohammed\n\nKhatami. Long and sinuous as it may be this process of change shows\n\na clear ’light at the end of the tunnel,’ some Western politicians\n\nbelieve. But the American political establishment remains divided\n\nover this issue, therefore, George W. Bush will have to think twice\n\nbefore replicating the ’Iraqi model’ in Iran.\n\nMeanwhile, no regime changes are yet in sight in Syria. As The\n\nNew York Times noted recently, “Syria has proved remarkably\n\nresistant to change.” Even Iran’s theocratic regime, masterminded\n\nby Ayatollah Khomeini, is tolerant enough to allow for a budding\n\ncivil society, the freedom of discussion and a relative pluralism.\n\nBut the totalitarian regime of the Syrian Baath party forces\n\neveryone to toe the party line, while the people live in fear of an\n\nall-encompassing police surveillance."
