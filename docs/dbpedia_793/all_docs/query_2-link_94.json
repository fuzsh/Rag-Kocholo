The countries of the Middle East, however, were the result of arbitrary decisions made during and after World War One by two European colonial powers: Britain and France. Under the secret Sikes-Picot Agreement of 1916 Britain and France decided to divide among themselves the Arab provinces of Ottoman Empire. In 1917 Britain promised European Zionists a “Jewish homeland” in Palestine while previously in 1915 promising the Sunni sharif of Mecca, Ali bin Hussein, an independent Arab nation on the Arabian Peninsula. With the help of the British liaison officer T. E. Lawrence (a.k.a. Lawrence of Arabia) Hussein’s son, Faisal, took control of Damascus, and his other son, Abdullah, conquered Amman.\n\nAt the San Remo in 1920 conference Britain and France agreed to establish League of Nations mandates for the French in Lebanon (carved out of Syria for Maronite Christians) and Syria and for the British in Palestine and Mesopotamia (Iraq today). Faisal convinced a Syrian assembly to make him king of Syria, but the French removed him from power. At the Cairo Conference in 1921 the British installed the Sunni Faisal as king of an independent Iraq despite the fact it was primarily Shi’a with a minority of Kurds and Sunnis. They also installed his brother Abdullah as emir of Transjordan (then becoming king of an independent Jordan after 1946), which was carved out of the British mandate of Palestine. In 1924 Hussein, then king of Hejaz, was defeated and exiled by his Sunni rival, the sultan of Nejd, ibn Saud, who in 1832 created the present-day Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Thus, Britain and France created five new mandates/countries: Syria, Lebanon (established for the Maronite Christian), Iraq and Jordan (ruled by a minority Hashemite dynasty), and Israel (created as a “Jewish homeland”). In doing this they divided some ethnic groups (the Sunni and the Shi’a) and excluding others from having independent states (the Kurds, the Allawis, and the Druze).\n\nAfter World War Two, the United Nations incorporated these arbitrary nation-states (Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel) into international law by defining any attempt to change these boundaries by outside military force as aggression, and any attempt to resolve issues of self-determination within these boundaries as outside the jurisdiction of the United Nations. The Palestinians then, just as the Jewish settlers on the West Bank today, claimed all the land that had formerly been included in the Palestinian Mandate (all the land between the Mediterranean and either the Jordan or the Euphrates rivers). During the Cold War, the United States created alliances with Middle-Eastern countries (Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Iran before the Iranian Revolution of 1979) that opposed to Russian Communism and/or were willingness to make oil concessions to the United States and/or Britain (Saudi Arabia and Iran under the Shah). The United States opposed those countries (Egypt under Nasser and Syria under the socialist Ba’ath Party) that followed a policy of neutrality.\n\nOpposition to the Jewish State was the one thing that united Shi’a and Sunni regimes. The Arab states of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia attempted to expel the Jews from Palestine/Israel in 1948. While still courting the oil-rich Arab states of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, the United States supported the Jewish state of Israel, both because it had a parliamentary form of government and because it was anti-Communist, ignoring the fact that it has displaced Palestinians in 1948. After the Six-Day War in 1967 Israel took control of Egyptian territory in Gaza, Jordanian territory in East Jerusalem and on the West Bank, and Syria territory on the strategic Golan Heights. The Palestinians launched guerilla raids into Israel from safe havens in Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. The Palestinians actually constituted a majority of the population in Jordan today, and they unsuccessfully attempted to overthrow the pro-American Hashemite dynasty there in 1970 to 1971. In an attempt to restore Greater Syria, the Syrian government invaded Jordan, but this lead to the coming to power of the Syrian general, the Alawite Muslim Hafez Assad, who opposed the invasion.\n\nThe Palestinians then moved into Lebanon, where the Israelis had made an alliance with the dominant Maronite Christian regime and the Druze. Hafez Assad didn’t support the Sunni Palestinians, but Syria never conceded that Lebanon was separate from Greater Syria. When the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) invaded Syria to stop Palestinian raids, Syria invaded the predominantly Shi’ite Beqaa Valley of Lebanon. Through the intervention of the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union, Israel was forced to withdraw, but in the aftermath of the occupation a radical Shi’ite organization known as Hezbollah was organized with the support of Iran and Syria. This alliance was based on the fact that the Allawite faith was offshoot of Shi’ite Islam. After the assassination of the Maronite Christian former president of Lebanon, Rafiq Hariri, in which Syria and Hezbollah were implicated, Syria was forced to withdraw from Lebanon. While Hafez al-Assad consolidated Syria’s alliance with Hezbollah, he violently suppressed an uprising in the city of Hama led by the Sunni jihadist organization, the Muslim Brotherhood. Hafez Assad was succeeded by his ophthalmologist son, Bashar Assad, who began a crackdown on those dissenters who signed the Beirut-Damascus Declaration of 2006 calling for recognition of Lebanon and a resolution of the border between the two countries.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Arab Spring in 2011 in which popular uprisings overturned autocratic regimes in Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya, the Sunni population of Syria sought to overturn the Allawite-regime of Bashar al-Assad. Syria’s Kurds supported the rebels, Syria’s Druze population remained neutral, and Lebanese Hezbollah joined the fight in support of the Assad regime. President Barak Obama, who was in the process of ending American military forces propping up the Shi’ite dominated regime in neighboring Iraq, was reluctant to lend support for the coalition of forces fearing its aid would be supplying Sunni terrorist organizations, such as Al Qaeda. The Sunni Islamist group ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria), whose leaders were radicalized in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq during the administration of George W. Bush, invaded the weakened Shi’ite government of Nouri al-Maliki, conquering key Sunni areas in northwest Iraq, threatening the Kurdish region in the northeast, and advancing toward Baghdad, President Obama decided to provide air-support for the Kurdish and Iraqi forces fighting ISIS. When ISIS beheaded two American journalists, the United States expanded it air strikes into Syria.\n\nRussia has had a naval base in the port city of Tartus on the Mediterranean Sea since 1971. In September 2015 it increased its support of the Assad regime by expanding its military presence by building an air force based in the port city of Latakia in the Allawite region of Syria. Later that month Russian planes began bombing anti-Assad rebel forces in northwest Syria, but not ISIS in eastern Syria. Russian president Vladimir Putin said that his military intervention was part of Russia’s own War on Terrorism against Muslims in Chechnya and Dagestan who want their own independence from the Russian Federation.\n\nAt the same time ISIS has been recruiting supporters beyond Iraq and Syria and taking credit for terrorist attacks in Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Morocco, Bangladesh, Egypt, Lebanon, Spain, Germany, France, Denmark, Tunisia, Yemen, Turkey. In 2015 alone ISIS operatives have been involved attacks on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris and a Libyan hotel in January; a museum in Tunisia and mosque in Yemen in March; a beach resort in Tunisia in June; the Italian consulate in Cairo in July; a Kurdish peace rally in Turkey and a Russian airliner in Egypt in October; and Shi’ite neighborhoods in Beirut and several venues in Paris in November. In response to the Paris bombing, French president, Franςois Hollande has declared war on ISIS, which as a NATO member has implications for the policy of the United States and Great Britain.\n\nWhile it may be possible for a coalition of France, Russia, the United States (and possibly the UN and NATO) to defeat ISIS militarily, it does not does not get to the underlying issues that enable both Sunni and Shi’ite terrorist organizations to recruit new members. Nor will it resolve the difference between the United States and Russia about the fate of Bashar al-Assad. Cleary, the fate of the Middle Eastern countries of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, and Israel as well as a possible future Palestinian state are intertwined. A resolution can be achieved only by an international conference of all the nations affected by the Syrian conflict to redraw the boundaries of Middle East based on the American principle of self-determination. Such a negotiation might entail establishing an Allawite-Shi’ite nation in northwestern Syria and the Beqaa Valley of Lebanon, a Druze nation in southern Lebanon and the Golan Heights, a Kurdish nation in northeastern Syria and northern Iraq, Sunni nation in eastern Syria and northwestern Iraq, and a temporary two nation solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict leading eventually to a secular state of Israel that would be the homeland to both Jews and Palestinians. Woodrow Wilson called for this at Versailles in 1919, but he was not in a position to implement it. But the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Russia are in a position to do it today.\n\nIn the name of fake principles and worthless values that they don’t respect in their homelands, the tyrannical gangster-regimes of the West have undertaken since 2011 an overtly murderous, genocidal project against Syria with the utmost... more\n\nIn the name of fake principles and worthless values that they don’t respect in their homelands, the tyrannical gangster-regimes of the West have undertaken since 2011 an overtly murderous, genocidal project against Syria with the utmost ferocity. Playing on almost 100 years old colonial background of multifaceted falsification, distortion and corruption, the loathsome regimes of America, England and France coined the ridiculous term ‘Arab Spring’ for what was never a spring and for countries that were never ‘Arab’.\n\nIn a recently published article (Arab Nation Hoax: Geared to Falsify Islamic History & Ruin Varied Nations disfiguratively Named Arab /http://www.turkishnews.com/en/content/2014/09/09/arab-nation-hoax-geared-to-falsify-islamic-history-ruin-varied-nations-disfiguratively-named-arab/), I explained analytically why all the countries from Mauritania to Oman and from Syria and Iraq to Sudan and Yemen are not Arab (with the exception of Saudi Arabia, the only truly Arab country in the world), do not have anything to do with the Arabic Nation, and cannot therefore be accepted as falsely described by the Western term.\n\nThe immorality of the deliberate foreign aggression was shared among the leading Western countries (that are ruled by the Freemasonic lodges and the Zionist lobby) and their local stooges, notably the fake kings of Saudi Arabia and Jordan, the trashy emirs of Kuwait, Qatar and UAE, and the ignorant, uneducated and idiotic trash of Recep Erdogan, Turkey’s charlatanesque president who is a Freemason pretty much like his chimpanzee-like prime minister, the Ashkenazi crypto-Jew Ahmet Davutooglu. Different motives brought all these gangsters together and, with a great deal of bribery and logistical support plus the dispatch of special units disguised as ‘Syrian rebels’, they spread destruction to a country that for many long decades had not harmed anyone else except itself.\n\nOf course, the criminal nature of the events triggered by the Western aggression and the unprecedented bloodshed caused during the hostilities should have brought the aforementioned gangsters in front of the International Court of Justice for crimes against the Mankind, but this would have been an extraordinary surprise and an indication that the international community started repenting for the crimes committed in the name of humanity over the past 70 years.\n\nIt would however be wrong to consider that, facing the foreign aggression, the Syrian regime was an angelic institution. Syria may have been a dictatorship before and after the rise of Assad family in power, but this is an understatement. The Baath regime and the underlying ideology constituted a terrible deformation of Syria’s national identity, cultural integrity, and historical continuity. The ideological system that the Assad family has served and is still serving is not an internal theoretical product; it is an alien, colonial fabrication geared only to engulf its victims into an impasse that can only lead to developments such as those we already attested in Syria and in Iraq, in Libya and in Yemen, in Tunisia and in Sudan, in Lebanon and in Algeria, and like what we will soon observe in Egypt.\n\nFirst published in:\n\nhttps://megalommatiscomments.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/syria-assad-us-turkey-and-the-concealed-reality-the-aramaean-identity-of-syria/\n\n6 October 2014"
