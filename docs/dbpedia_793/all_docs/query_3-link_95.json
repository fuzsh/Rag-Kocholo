Among those newly elected to the leadership are parliament chief Jihad al-Laham and Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi. The Baath party has been in power since March 8, 1963 and is the most powerful political party in Syria. Monday's meeting of the party's central committee is the first since 2005, when much of the previous old guard was replaced.\n\nThe move comes against the backdrop of the ongoing conflict in Syria, which began in March 2011 with peaceful anti-government protests but has become a bloody civil war estimated to have killed more than 100,000 people.\n\nFollow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter\n\nReceive Ynetnews updates directly to your desktop"
