        "text": "What Washington Should Do\n\nWork for a peace settlement that minimizes Israel's long-term security risks.\n\nFor Israel, the Golan Heights are an irreplaceable strategic asset. The 450-square-mile buffer zone gives it strategic depth against a formidable Syrian armored force that is capable of rapidly mobilizing and launching a surprise attack from prepared positions close to the border.\n\nStrategic depth is important because it buys time for Israel to mobilize its own armed forces, which are much smaller than Syria's and much more reliant on the mobilization of reserve forces. Although the proliferation of ground-to-ground missiles has lessened the importance of strategic depth, wars ultimately are won on the ground, as the Gulf War proved. Although Syria is not strong enough to defeat Israel in a war by itself, Israeli leaders must consider the potential Syrian threat in conjunction with other Arab threats. For example, Iraq has dispatched forces to Syria or Jordan to help them fight Israel in three Arab-Israeli wars.\n\nIf it surrenders the Golan, Israel will be taking asymmetrical risks: It will be making a concrete concession that undermines its security in exchange for an easily reversible promise of peace that could easily be exploded by Assad, his successor, or a new Syrian regime. Washington therefore must try to shape a settlement that mitigates the security risks as much as possible. For example:\n\nBorders.\n\nSyrian demands for restoration of its sovereignty over the Golan theoretically could be reconciled with Israeli security demands by allowing Israel to lease a strip of the western Golan from the Syrians for several decades. Retaining such Israeli control over the western cliffs overlooking Israel's Hulah valley would ease concerns over Syrian artillery or sniper attacks, such as those that frequently occurred before the 1967 war, and give Syria the opportunity to demonstrate its good faith. If Syria rejects this, then the border should revert to the international border negotiated between the British and French colonial powers in 1923. This border, which runs slightly east of the 1967 line of control, would deprive the Syrians of territory that they conquered by force between 1948 and 1967.\n\nMount Hermon.\n\nIsrael's early warning facilities, located on a 7,300-foot-high ridge of Mount Hermon roughly 26 miles southwest of Damascus, offer unimpeded surveillance of Syrian air space and military bases for which there is no topographical substitute inside Israel. Israel should be allowed to retain its personnel on Mount Hermon.\n\nDemilitarized Zones.\n\nTerritory that Israel returns to Syria should be totally demilitarized; Syria should be allowed to deploy small numbers of police on that territory, but no military personnel. Syrian military forces also should be thinned out in western Syria, with tight restrictions placed on the deployment of Syrian armored forces and heavy artillery.\n\nHelp compensate Israel for the loss of the Golan Heights.\n\nThe United States can help compensate Israel for the loss of the Golan, but it cannot fully replace it.\n\nAid.\n\nWashington should provide aid for the relocation of Israeli military forces and bases from the Golan. However, it should not provide compensation for the 17,000 Israeli settlers on the Golan who moved there over American opposition.\n\nIntelligence.\n\nTo upgrade Israel's early warning capabilities, Washington should provide Israel with a ground station that is capable of downloading real-time intelligence from U.S. intelligence satellites that are monitoring Syria. This would guarantee Israel a continuing source of military intelligence concerning Syrian military deployments if Israel's monitoring facilities on Mount Hermon were knocked out in a war. Unmanned aerial vehicles, such as the Global Hawk currently being developed by the United States, also could help Israel maintain surveillance over the Golan border region.\n\nArms.\n\nTo help Israel maintain its qualitative military superiority, the United States can provide advanced arms capable of defeating a Syrian armored thrust, such as Apache helicopters, J-STARS airborne radar aircraft, and MLRS (Multiple Launch Rocket System) surface-to-surface missiles. Washington should also provide Tomahawk cruise missiles to give Israel standoff weapons that can strengthen deterrence against a Syrian attack.\n\nRequire Syria to crack down systematically on terrorists.\n\nSyria long has used terrorism as an adjunct of its foreign policy. It gives sanctuary and political, military, and financial support to a wide variety of Palestinian, Lebanese, Turkish, Kurdish, and other terrorist groups.\n\nDespite its flirtation with the peace process, Syria continues to support Palestinian groups opposed to the 1993 Oslo Accords, including Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. In Lebanon, Syria cooperates with the radical Islamic Hezbollah militia, which was responsible for the 1983 bombings of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the Marine peacekeeping compound near the Beirut airport, as well as the kidnapping of 15 American hostages in Lebanon between 1984 and 1991. Damascus also has supported the Kurdish Workers Party, which has waged a bloody terrorist campaign against Turkey since 1984 in a vain effort to carve out a separate Kurdish state in eastern Turkey.\n\nTurkey scored a major victory against terrorism when it threatened military action to force Syria to expel Abdullah Oculan, the leader of the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK), and 300 of his followers in October 1998. Assad bowed to Turkey's ultimatum to halt Syrian support for the PKK when confronted with Turkey's resolve and growing military cooperation with Israel, as well as the perception that the PKK had become a liability.\n\nThe Clinton Administration must drive home to Assad that supporting any terrorist group is a liability. In the past, the Administration has taken a lax attitude toward Syrian support of terrorism. For example, President Clinton lauded the establishment of a Syrian-American working group as a major achievement of his 1994 meeting with Assad, but the working group \"met once and was never heard of again.\"\n\nThe Administration reportedly has deferred discussion of Syrian support for terrorism while it focuses on advancing the peace negotiations. But Assad will retain his terrorist surrogates unless he is pressured firmly to abandon them. The Clinton Administration should demand that Syria disband, disarm, and expel all terrorist groups based in Syria or Syrian-controlled Lebanese territory and cooperate in arresting and extraditing the leaders of all terrorist groups--not just the Palestinian groups.\n\nRequire Syria to end its strategic cooperation with Iran and halt the flow of Iranian supplies to the radical Shiite Hezbollah militia in Lebanon.\n\nSyria is one of the few Arab states that cooperates closely with Iran. Damascus supported Iran in its 1980-1988 war against Iraq and allows Iran to deploy several hundred Revolutionary Guards in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon. These Iranian militants train Hezbollah and other terrorists and supply them with arms transported through Syria. The Clinton Administration should insist that Syria block this supply line and expel the Iranian Revolutionary Guards from Lebanon.\n\nRequire Syria to end its support for drug smuggling and counterfeiting operations in Lebanon.\n\nSyria has become an important transit country for illegal drugs, particularly hashish and heroin, some of which is being refined in Syria. Much of the drug trafficking originates in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley, and \"Syrian officials are widely reported to have profited from facilitating the sale and transit of Lebanese-produced hashish and heroin destined for Europe and the United States.\" Syria also is suspected of cooperating with Iran in distributing high-quality counterfeit U.S. currency through terrorist groups and smuggling rings in Lebanon.\n\nRequire Syria to assist in containing Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe Clinton Administration should press Syria to cooperate in containing the regime of Saddam Hussein in neighboring Iraq. There is no love lost between Assad and Hussein, long-time rivals for leadership of the Arab world who lead competing wings of the Arab Socialist Baath (Renaissance) party.\n\nAt a minimum, the United States should insist that Syria close its border to Iraq to curtail illegal trade that is circumventing the United Nations-sponsored economic sanctions against Iraq. If Damascus hopes to pry foreign aid out of Washington, it should be required to give sanctuary and support to the Iraqi National Congress, the leading opposition group that is fighting Saddam's brutal regime, and allow the United States to base aircraft on Syrian territory to enforce the no-fly zones in Iraq.\n\nWork to build a stable, independent Lebanon.\n\nRoughly 35,000 Syrian troops occupy much of northeastern Lebanon. Syria initially intervened in Lebanon in 1975, ostensibly as a peacekeeping operation under the auspices of the Arab League. But at the 1989 conference on Lebanon sponsored by the Arab League in Taif, Saudi Arabia, Damascus agreed to a phased withdrawal of Syrian troops to the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon, and to negotiate subsequently with the Lebanese government on the future status of its forces. Instead, Syria has extended its control over Lebanon, occupying almost 90 percent of the country north of Israel's security zone in October 1990 and establishing a stranglehold on Lebanese politics.\n\nThe Clinton Administration should press Syria to abide by the Taif agreement and allow the Lebanese government to expand its control over Lebanese territory. Washington should stress that if Damascus cannot fulfill the commitments it made at Taif to other Arab states, it should not expect to be considered a reliable negotiating partner that is likely to fulfill commitments it makes to Israel or the United States.\n\nConsult with Congress before making any commitments.\n\nPresident Clinton should consult congressional leaders in a timely manner before making any commitments for diplomatic, military, and foreign aid that his successor and Congress would be forced to deliver in the future. The $1.9 billion aid package for Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinians that President Clinton pledged to deliver at the October 1998 Wye River peace summit was delayed and almost lost because the President presented Congress with a fait accompli. The Clinton Administration should not risk stumbling into a similar embarrassment in the future.\n\nWhat Washington Should Not Do\n\nDo not commit U.S. peacekeeping troops to the Golan Heights.\n\nThe Golan Heights present a more formidable peacekeeping challenge than the existing U.S. peacekeeping mission on the Sinai Peninsula, the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO), which monitors compliance with the security arrangements of the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty. The MFO is often cited as a model for a U.S. peacekeeping presence on the Golan, but U.S. peacekeepers in the Golan Heights would operate in a markedly different geographic, military, and political environment. Rather than being deployed in a vast desert far from the main bodies of the opposing military forces, they would be stationed in a constricted area, sandwiched between large armored forces in positions that would quickly become important military objectives if fighting were to break out.\n\nAn MFO-like monitoring force would be small and lightly armed; but a small, light force would have difficulty protecting itself from terrorist attacks that may emanate from Lebanon, let alone a Syrian military offensive. Unlike the remote, sparsely populated Sinai Peninsula, the Golan Heights would be a more hospitable operating theater for terrorists from Lebanon or living among civilians in the Golan Heights.\n\nTherefore, a U.S. peacekeeping force in the Golan would have to be large enough to deter attacks from any source and defend itself. In other words, it would have to be a large combat formation, configured for possible combat, with appropriate rules of engagement. But a large force, such as an armored or mechanized infantry brigade, would be both costly and a drain on the U.S. military presence in more important strategic regions, such as the Persian Gulf or Korean peninsula.\n\nU.S. forces on the Golan would be inadequate to defend Israel if it is attacked. They likely would constitute only a marginal military deterrent to Syria and would be unable to provide adequate early warning to Israel. In essence, they would serve as a trip wire in the event of another war.\n\nThe real rationale for the U.S. presence is not military, but political--to reassure a nervous Israeli public about security concerns that the United States would be in no position to remedy if conflict were to erupt. This is dangerous because it could engender a false sense of security that could lead the Israelis to take more risks in peace negotiations with Syria than they otherwise would.\n\nThe Effect on Combat Readiness.\n\nA peacekeeping presence in the Golan would be a further drain on U.S. military forces, which already are stretched thin around the world. The United States cannot afford to commit an ever-larger proportion of its declining active-duty forces to worldwide peacekeeping operations. Sending U.S. troops to Kosovo and Bosnia already has depleted America's strategic reserve and undermined readiness. It should be remembered that the peacekeeping commitments to Kosovo and Bosnia were made in addition to existing U.S. security commitments in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nFor a Golan peacekeeping mission to be credible would require the commitment of a large force consisting of at least a heavy brigade--roughly 5,000 troops. To maintain a long-term deployment of this force, three brigades would have to be dedicated to the mission: one on deployment, one recovering and retraining after returning from the mission, and one training and preparing to deploy on the mission. This is roughly 10 percent of the U.S. Army's active-duty combat strength, a prohibitively high burden for an open-ended peacekeeping mission. If the United States were suddenly faced with conflict in other regions of the world, such as the Persian Gulf or the Korean peninsula, the forces on the Golan could well be needed to protect vital U.S. national interests.\n\nAn open-ended peacekeeping mission on the Golan also would reduce the military effectiveness of troops available for other missions. Troops returning from the Golan would need many months of retraining to regain the warfighting skills that inevitably would have atrophied during the peacekeeping deployment.\n\nThe Exposure to Terrorism.\n\nGolan peacekeepers would be vulnerable to significant terrorist threats. They would be stationed close to southern and eastern Lebanon, the staging areas for some of the world's most dangerous terrorists, including Hezbollah, the militant pro-Iranian terrorist group responsible for the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. Hezbollah and other terrorist groups operating inside Lebanon have a history of attacking Americans. They would have even more reason to use terrorism to disrupt a U.S.-brokered peace agreement that they violently oppose.\n\nSyria itself is one of the chief exporters of international terrorism. The Assad regime repeatedly has used terrorism as an adjunct of foreign policy in inter-Arab politics, in Lebanon, and against Israel. Assad also supported Hezbollah's terrorist campaign against U.S. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon in 1983-1984. Given Syria's success in helping Hezbollah to drive U.S. peacekeepers out of Lebanon in 1984, Assad could well try a similar strategy in the Golan to seek the removal of the peacekeepers. Even if Assad should cooperate in restraining terrorism, however, Iran, Iraq, and Libya could support Lebanon-based terrorist proxies against U.S. forces in the Golan.\n\nSince U.S. troops would be a lightning rod for terrorism, particularly because of America's brokering of the Syrian-Israel peace accord, they should not be placed in harm's way to man a Golan peacekeeping operation. If peacekeepers are needed to monitor a Syrian-Israeli peace treaty, they should be drawn from other countries. The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force has deployed peacekeepers from Austria, Canada, Finland, and Poland on the Golan Heights for over two decades to monitor compliance with the 1974 Israeli-Syrian Disengagement Agreement.\n\nDo not push Israel into any settlement that it believes would undermine its security.\n\nPresident Clinton must remember that Israel is a close ally: one that has fought three wars with Syria, itself an ally of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. A stable Middle East peace cannot be imposed by an external power and must be based on a strong security foundation. The United States should allow the two sides to work out their differences, not intervene on Syria's behalf to force concessions from Israel that could undermine its security.\n\nDo not rush the negotiations needlessly.\n\nAt Shepherdstown, President Clinton set a two-month deadline for negotiating a Syrian-Israeli peace accord. Assad's declining health and the approaching end of President Clinton's term in office put additional pressure on the parties to reach a rapid settlement.\n\nBut a good agreement is more important than a quick one. The Syrian-Israeli rivalry is likely to remain stable as long as Israel enjoys military superiority. Further, signing a deal with Assad is no guarantee that his successor will observe its terms. Moreover, the longer Israel waits, the better its chances of extracting a more advantageous deal from Syria may be. Assad's successor will be weaker and probably more amenable to compromise. Even if Assad survives his ailments for an extended period, the Syrian economy is ailing, and this will generate growing pressure on Damascus to improve relations with the West to gain aid, trade, foreign investment, loans, and technology.\n\nTime is growing short for President Clinton to secure his \"legacy\" and for Assad to engineer a smooth transition of power to his chosen successor, Bashar. In the words of one Israeli expert on the Syrian economy, however, \"a rush by Israel to reach agreement with Assad makes about as much sense as the United States rushing in 1989 to reach agreements with the Soviet Union.\" Washington should not undermine Israeli efforts to negotiate a stable peace by imposing arbitrary negotiating deadlines.\n\nDo not give foreign aid to Syria merely as a reward for peace.\n\nUnder no circumstances should the U.S. promise foreign aid to Syria as a sweetener for a peace agreement. The prospective return of the Golan Heights and peace itself are Syria's peace dividends. The Assad regime should not expect to be showered with U.S. aid as Anwar Sadat's Egypt was after the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.\n\nFirst of all, Sadat did not support terrorism against Americans. Second, he took great personal and political risks to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough and push for a genuine reconciliation between Egypt and Israel, unlike Assad who insists implacably on Syria's maximum demands as if Syria had won, rather than lost, three wars with Israel. Finally, Sadat led Egypt out of the Soviet orbit and into a strategic alliance with the United States, while Assad led Syria into a close alliance with the Soviet Union, signing a 1980 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with Moscow and inviting 13,000 Soviet and East European advisers into Syria.\n\nSyria today does not have the same geopolitical importance that Egypt enjoyed in 1979. It does not have as large a population, as impressive a military force, or the same claim to Arab leadership that Egypt enjoyed. Moreover, now that the Cold War has ended and there is no Soviet Union seeking to outbid the West for the allegiance of regional powers, the perceived value of Syrian cooperation on foreign policy and security issues also has declined. In fact, the collapse of its superpower patron and the poor prospects for its stagnant socialist economy have given Damascus increasing incentives to cooperate with the West and escape its self-imposed isolation.\n\nThese factors, combined with the political vulnerability of the Assad regime over the impending succession struggle, mean that Assad needs the United States more than the United States needs Assad.\n\nInstead of rewarding Syria with foreign aid for a peace settlement that advances Syrian interests, Washington should reward Syria with foreign aid only if Damascus actively supports U.S. foreign policy goals outside the Arab-Israeli peace process. No aid should be promised unless Syria not only signs a peace treaty with Israel, but also takes concrete actions to cooperate with the United States in fighting terrorism, containing Iraq, isolating Iran, halting drug smuggling, and promoting a stable and independent Lebanon.\n\nDo not give U.S. arms to Syria.\n\nIt does not make sense to give Damascus U.S. arms that could be used against Israel, Jordan, Turkey, or the Syrian people if they should rebel against the Assad dictatorship, as they did in 1982. Moreover, giving arms to Syria would require giving more arms to Israel to counterbalance the threat of those arms that are in Syrian hands."
