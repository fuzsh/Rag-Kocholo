        "text": "Syrian Vice-President Farouk al-Sharaa has made his first public appearance in several weeks, ending rumours that he defected.\n\nMr. al-Sharaa was last seen at the funeral of four top Syrian government officials who were killed in a blast in Damascus on July 18, 2012. Since then, speculation has circulated that he defected to Jordan in what would have been a blow to Bashar Assad’s regime. Jordan and Mr. al-Sharaa’s office repeatedly denied he defected.\n\nOn Sunday, reporters saw Mr. al-Sharaa exit his car and walk to his office for a meeting with Alaeddin Boroujerdi, head of Iran’s powerful parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy."
