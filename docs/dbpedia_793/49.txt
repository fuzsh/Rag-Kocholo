Baʿath Party, Pan-Arabist political party advocating the formation of a single Arab socialist nation. It has branches in many Middle Eastern countries and was the ruling party in Syria from 1963 and in Iraq from 1968 to 2003.

The Baʿath Party was founded in 1943 in Damascus, Syria, by Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din Bitar, adopted its constitution in 1947, and in 1953 merged with the Syrian Socialist Party to form the Arab Socialist Baʿath (Renaissance) Party. The Baʿath Party espoused nonalignment and opposition to imperialism and colonialism, took inspiration from what it considered the positive values of Islam, and attempted to ignore or transcend class divisions. Its structure was highly centralized and authoritarian.

Iraq: State control

The Syrian Baʿathists took power in 1963, but factionalism between “progressives” and “nationalists” was severe until 1970, when Hafez al-Assad of the “nationalists” secured control. In Iraq the Baʿathists took power briefly in 1963 and regained it in 1968, after which the party’s power became concentrated under Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Differences between the Iraqi and Syrian wings of the Baʿath Party precluded unification of the two countries. Within both countries the Baʿathists formed fronts with smaller parties, including at times the communists. In Syria the main internal threat to Baʿath hegemony stemmed from the Muslim Brotherhood, while in Iraq Kurdish and Shiʿi opposition was endemic.
