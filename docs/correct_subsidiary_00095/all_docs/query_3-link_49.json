H. A.; Muhamad, M.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThis paper presents design of circuit which converts low input AC voltage to a higher output DC voltage. A buck-boost topology and boost topology are combined to condition cycle of an AC input voltage. the unique integration of a combining circuit of buck-boost and boost circuit have been proposed in order to introduce a new direct ac-dc power converter topology without conventional diode bridge rectifier.

The inputs for the proposed control scheme are the DC voltage and reactive power errors at the converter station and the active and reactive power errors at the inverter station of the voltage-source converter-based high voltage direct current transmission (VSC-HVDC) link. The stability and robust tracking of the system parameters are ensured by applying the Lyapunov direct method. Also the gains of the sliding mode control (SMC) are made adaptive using the stability conditions of the Lyapunov function. The proposed control strategy offers invariant stability to a class of systems having modeling uncertainties due to parameter changes and exogenous inputs. Comprehensive computer simulations are carried out to verify the proposed control scheme under several system disturbances like changes in short-circuit ratio, converter parametric changes, and faults on the converter and inverter buses for single generating system connected to the power grid in a single machine infinite-bus AC-DC network and also for a 3-machine two-area power system. Furthermore, a second order super twisting sliding mode control scheme has been presented in this paper that provides a higher degree of nonlinearity than the LYPSMC and damps faster the converter and inverter voltage and power oscillations.

Input frequencies much higher than normal, up to 20 kHz were emphasized. Several methods of shaping the input current waveform in ac-to-dc converters were reviewed. The simplest method is the LC filter following the rectifier. The next simplest method is the resistor emulation approach in which the inductor size is determined by the converter switching frequency and not by the line input frequency. Other methods require complicated switch drive algorithms to construct the input current waveshape. For a high-frequency line input, on the order of 20 kHz, the simple LC cannot be discarded so peremptorily, since the inductor size can be compared with that for the resistor emulation method. In fact, since a dc regulator will normally be required after the filter anyway, the total component count is almost the same as for the resistor emulation method, in which the filter is effectively incorporated into the regulator.\n\nSystem and component design and test of a 10 hp, 18,000 rpm AC dynamometer utilizing a high frequency AC voltage link, part 1\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLipo, Thomas A.; Alan, Irfan\n\n1991-01-01\n\nHard and soft switching test results conducted with one of the samples of first generation MOS-controlled thyristor (MCTs) and similar test results with several different samples of second generation MCT's are reported. A simple chopper circuit is used to investigate the basic switching characteristics of MCT under hard switching and various types of resonant circuits are used to determine soft switching characteristics of MCT under both zero voltage and zero current switching. Next, operation principles of a pulse density modulated converter (PDMC) for three phase (3F) to 3F two-step power conversion via parallel resonant high frequency (HF) AC link are reviewed. The details for the selection of power switches and other power components required for the construction of the power circuit for the second generation 3F to 3F converter system are discussed. The problems encountered in the first generation system are considered. Design and performance of the first generation 3F to 3F power converter system and field oriented induction moter drive based upon a 3 kVA, 20 kHz parallel resonant HF AC link are described. Low harmonic current at the input and output, unity power factor operation of input, and bidirectional flow capability of the system are shown via both computer and experimental results. The work completed on the construction and testing of the second generation converter and field oriented induction motor drive based upon specifications for a 10 hp squirrel cage dynamometer and a 20 kHz parallel resonant HF AC link is discussed. The induction machine is designed to deliver 10 hp or 7.46 kW when operated as an AC-dynamo with power fed back to the source through the converter. Results presented reveal that the proposed power level requires additional energy storage elements to overcome difficulties with a peak link voltage variation problem that limits reaching to the desired power level. The power level test of the second generation converter after the\n\nElectromechanical systems with transient high power response operating from a resonant ac link\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBurrows, Linda M.; Hansen, Irving G.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe combination of an inherently robust asynchronous (induction) electrical machine with the rapid control of energy provided by a high frequency resonant ac link enables the efficient management of higher power levels with greater versatility. This could have a variety of applications from launch vehicles to all-electric automobiles. These types of systems utilize a machine which is operated by independent control of both the voltage and frequency. This is made possible by using an indirect field-oriented control method which allows instantaneous torque control all four operating quadrants. Incorporating the ac link allows the converter in these systems to switch at the zero crossing of every half cycle of the ac waveform. This zero loss switching of the link allows rapid energy variations to be achieved without the usual frequency proportional switching loss. Several field-oriented control systems were developed under contract to NASA.\n\nImpute DC link (IDCL) cell based power converters and control thereof\n\nDOEpatents\n\nDivan, Deepakraj M.; Prasai, Anish; Hernendez, Jorge; Moghe, Rohit; Iyer, Amrit; Kandula, Rajendra Prasad\n\n2016-04-26\n\nPower flow controllers based on Imputed DC Link (IDCL) cells are provided. The IDCL cell is a self-contained power electronic building block (PEBB). The IDCL cell may be stacked in series and parallel to achieve power flow control at higher voltage and current levels. Each IDCL cell may comprise a gate drive, a voltage sharing module, and a thermal management component in order to facilitate easy integration of the cell into a variety of applications. By providing direct AC conversion, the IDCL cell based AC/AC converters reduce device count, eliminate the use of electrolytic capacitors that have life and reliability issues, and improve system efficiency compared with similarly rated back-to-back inverter system.\n\nA Modular PV System Using Chain-Link-Type Multilevel Converter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHatano, Nobuhiko; Ise, Toshifumi\n\nThis paper presents a modular photovoltaic system (MPVS) that uses a chain-link-type multilevel converter (CLMC). In large-scale PV generating systems, the DC power supply is generally composed of a large number of PV panels. Hence, losses are caused by differences in the maximum power point at each PV panel. An MPVS has been proposed to address the above mentioned problem. It helps improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency by applying maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control to each group of PV panels. In addition, if a CLMC is used in an MPVS, a high voltage can be output from the AC side and transmission losses can be decreased. However, with this circuit configuration, the current output from the AC side may be unbalanced. Therefore, we propose a method to output balanced current from the AC side, even if the output of the DC power supply is unbalanced. The validity of the proposed method is examined by digital simulation.\n\nPerformance testing of a high frequency link converter for Space Station power distribution system\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSul, S. K.; Alan, I.; Lipo, T. A.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe testing of a brassboard version of a 20-kHz high-frequency ac voltage link prototype converter dynamics for Space Station application is presented. The converter is based on a three-phase six-pulse bridge concept. The testing includes details of the operation of the converter when it is driving an induction machine source/load. By adapting a field orientation controller (FOC) to the converter, four-quadrant operation of the induction machine from the converter has been achieved. Circuit modifications carried out to improve the performance of the converter are described. The performance of two 400-Hz induction machines powered by the converter with simple V/f regulation mode is reported. The testing and performance results for the converter utilizing the FOC, which provides the capability for rapid torque changes, speed reversal, and four-quadrant operation, are reported.\n\nElectromechanical systems with transient high power response operating from a resonant AC link\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBurrows, Linda M.; Hansen, Irving G.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe combination of an inherently robust asynchronous (induction) electrical machine with the rapid control of energy provided by a high frequency resonant AC link enables the efficient management of higher power levels with greater versatility.

This circuit combines the functions of the rectifier and DC to DC converter, rather than using the rectifier to convert AC to DC and then supplying the required voltage with regulator as in the transitional method. This modification can reduce the power consumption and the area of the circuit. This circuit also transfers the loading condition back to the external circuit by the load shift keying(LSK), determining if the input power is not enough or excessive, which increases the efficiency of the total system. The AC to DC converter is fabricated with the TSMC 90nm CMOS process. The circuit area is 0.071mm(2). The circuit can produce a 1V DC voltage with maximum output current of 10mA from an AC input ranging from 1.5V to 2V, at 1MHz to 10MHz.\n\nVoltage source ac-to-dc converters for high-power transmitters\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCormier, R.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThis work was done to optimize the design of the components used for the beam power supply, which is a component of the transmitters in the Deep Space Network (DSN). The major findings are: (1) the difference in regulation between a six-pulse and a twelve-pulse converter is at most 7 percent worse for the twelve-pulse converter; (2) the commutation overlap angle of a current source converter equals that of a voltage source converter with continuous line currents; (3) the sources of uncharacteristic harmonics are identified with SPICE simulation; (4) the use of an imperfect phase-shifting transformer for the twelve-pulse converter generates a harmonic at six times the line frequency; and (5) the assumptions usually made in analyzing converters can be relaxed with SPICE simulation. The results demonstrate the suitability of using SPICE simulation to obtain detailed performance predictions of ac-to-dc converters.\n\nSimulation comparison of proportional integral derivative and fuzzy logic in controlling AC-DC buck boost converter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFaisal, A.; Hasan, S.; Suherman\n\n2018-03-01\n\nAC-DC converter is widely used in the commercial industry even for daily purposes. The AC-DC converter is used to convert AC voltage into DC. In order to obtain the desired output voltage, the converter usually has a controllable regulator. This paper discusses buck boost regulator with a power MOSFET as switching component which is adjusted based on the duty cycle of pulse width modulation (PWM). The main problems of the buck boost converter at start up are the high overshoot, the long peak time and rise time. This paper compares the effectiveness of two control techniques: proportional integral derivative (PID) and fuzzy logic control in controlling the buck boost converter through simulations. The results show that the PID is more sensitive to voltage change than fuzzy logic. However, PID generates higher overshoot, long peak time and rise time. On the other hand, fuzzy logic generates no overshoot and shorter rise time.\n\nAn Overview of Power Electronics Applications in Fuel Cell Systems: DC and AC Converters\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAli, M. S.; Kamarudin, S. K.; Masdar, M. S.; Mohamed, A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPower electronics and fuel cell technologies play an important role in the field of renewable energy. The demand for fuel cells will increase as fuel cells become the main power source for portable applications. In this application, a high-efficiency converter is an essential requirement and a key parameter of the overall system. This is because the size, cost, efficiency, and reliability of the overall system for portable applications primarily depend on the converter. Therefore, the selection of an appropriate converter topology is an important and fundamental aspect of designing a fuel cell system for portable applications as the converter alone plays a major role in determining the overall performance of the system.

A general mathematical model of the converter is first established, which is discontinuous, time-variant and non-linear. The following three techniques are used to obtain closed form solutions: Fourier analysis, transformation of reference frame and small signal linearization. Three models, namely, a steady-state DC model, a low frequency small signal AC model and a high frequency model, are consequently developed. Finally, three solution sets, namely, the steady-state solution, various dynamic transfer functions and the high frequency harmonic components, are obtained from the three models. Two control strategies, the Phase and Amplitude Control (PAC) and a new proposed strategy, Predicted Current Control with a Fixed Switching Frequency (PCFF), are investigated. Based on the transfer functions derived from the above mentioned analysis, regulators for a closed-loop control are designed. A prototype circuit is built to experimentally verify the theoretical predictions. The analysis and experimental results show that both strategies produce nearly sinusoidal line current with unity power factor on the utility side in both rectifying and regenerating operations and concurrently provide a regulated DC output voltage on the load side. However the proposed PCFF control has a faster and improved dynamic response over the PAC control. Moreover it is also easier to be implemented. Therefore, the PCFF control is preferable to the PAC control. As an example of application, a configuration of variable DC supply under PCFF control is proposed. The quasi-optimal dynamic response obtained shows that the PWM AC to DC converter lays the foundation for building a four-quadrant, fast-dynamic system, and the PCFF control is an effective strategy for improving dynamic performances not only as applied to the AC to DC converter, but also as applied to the DC to DC chopper or other\n\nCascaded Quadruple Active Bridge Structures for Multilevel DC to Three-Phase AC Conversion\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nJohnson, Brian B; Achanta, Prasanta K; Maksimovic, Dragan\n\nThis paper introduces a multilevel architecture comprised of interconnected dc to three-phase ac converter units. To enable series connected operation, each converter unit contains a quadruple active bridge (QAB) converter that provides isolation between the dc side and each of the three ac sides. Since each converter unit transfers dc-side power as constant balanced three-phase power on the ac side, this implies instantaneous input-output power balance and allows elimination of bulk capacitive energy storage. In addition to minimizing required capacitance, the proposed approach simultaneously enables simplified dc-link controllers amenable to decentralized implementation, supports bidirectional power transfer, and exhibits a modularmoreÂ Â» structure to enhance scalability. Isolation provided by the QAB allows a wide range of electrical configurations among multiple units in various dc-ac, ac-dc or ac-ac applications. In this paper, the focus is on series connections on the ac side to emphasize multilevel operation, and the approach is experimentally validated in a dc-ac system containing two cascaded converter units.Â«Â less\n\nSingle stage AC-DC converter for Galfenol-based micro-power energy harvesters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCavaroc, Peyton; Curtis, Chandra; Naik, Suketu; Cooper, James\n\n2014-06-01\n\nMilitary based sensor systems are often hindered in operational deployment and/or other capabilities due to limitations in their energy storage elements. Typically operating from lithium based batteries, there is a finite amount of stored energy which the sensor can use to collect and transmit data. As a result, the sensors have reduced sensing and transmission rates. However, coupled with the latest advancements in energy harvesting, these sensors could potentially operate at standard sensing and transition rates as well as dramatically extend lifetimes. Working with the magnetostrictive material Galfenol, we demonstrate the production of enough energy to supplement and recharge a solid state battery thereby overcoming the deficiencies faced by unattended sensors. As with any vibration-based energy harvester, this solution produces an alternating current which needs to be rectified and boosted to a level conducive to recharge the storage element. This paper presents a power converter capable of efficiently converting an ultra-low AC voltage to a solid state charging voltage of 4.1VDC. While we are working with Galfenol transducers as our energy source, this converter may also be applied with any AC producing energy harvester, particularly at operating levels less than 2mW and 200mVAC.\n\nPower flow controller with a fractionally rated back-to-back converter\n\nDOEpatents\n\nDivan, Deepakraj M.; Kandula, Rajendra Prasad; Prasai, Anish\n\n2016-03-08\n\nA power flow controller with a fractionally rated back-to-back (BTB) converter is provided. The power flow controller provide dynamic control of both active and reactive power of a power system. The power flow controller inserts a voltage with controllable magnitude and phase between two AC sources at the same frequency; thereby effecting control of active and reactive power flows between the two AC sources. A transformer may be augmented with a fractionally rated bi-directional Back to Back (BTB) converter. The fractionally rated BTB converter comprises a transformer side converter (TSC), a direct-current (DC) link, and a line side converter (LSC). By controlling the switches of the BTB converter, the effective phase angle between the two AC source voltages may be regulated, and the amplitude of the voltage inserted by the power flow controller may be adjusted with respect to the AC source voltages.\n\nAn isolated bridgeless AC-DC PFC converter using a LC resonant voltage doubler rectifier\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, Sin-woo; Do, Hyun-Lark\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThis paper proposed an isolated bridgeless AC-DC power factor correction (PFC) converter using a LC resonant voltage doubler rectifier. The proposed converter is based on isolated conventional single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC) PFC converter. The conduction loss of rectification is reduced than a conventional one because the proposed converter is designed to eliminate a full-bridge rectifier at an input stage. Moreover, for zero-current switching (ZCS) operation and low voltage stresses of output diodes, the secondary of the proposed converter is designed as voltage doubler with a LC resonant tank. Additionally, an input-output electrical isolation is provided for safety standard. In conclusion, high power factor is achieved and efficiency is improved. The operational principles, steady-state analysis and design equations of the proposed converter are described in detail. Experimental results from a 60 W prototype at a constant switching frequency 100 kHz are presented to verify the performance of the proposed converter.\n\nA Novel Multilevel DC - AC Converter from Green Energy Power Generators Using Step-Square Waving and PWM Technique\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFajingbesi, F. E.; Midi, N. S.; Khan, S.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nGreen energy sources or renewable energy system generally utilize modular approach in their design. This sort of power sources are generally in DC form or in single cases AC. Due to high fluctuation in the natural origin of this energy (wind & solar) source they are stored as DC. DC power however are difficult to transfer over long distances hence DC to AC converters and storage system are very important in green energy system design. In this work we have designed a novel multilevel DC to AC converter that takes into account the modular design of green energy systems. A power conversion efficiency of 99% with reduced total harmonic distortion (THD) was recorded from our simulated system design.\n\nCharacterization and snubbing of a bidirectional MCT in a resonant ac link converter\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLee, Tony; Elbuluk, Malik E.; Zinger, Donald S.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe MOS-Controlled Thyristor (MCT) is emerging as a powerful switch that combines the better characteristics of existing power devices. A study of switching stresses on an MCT switch under zero voltage resonant switching is presented. The MCT is used as a bidirectional switch in an ac/ac pulse density modulated inverter for induction motor drive. Current and voltage spikes are observed and analyzed with variations in the timing of the switching. Different snubber circuit configurations are under investigation to minimize the effect of these transients. The results will be extended to study and test the MCT switching in a medium power (5 hp) induction motor drive.\n\nUsing PBL to Improve Educational Outcomes and Student Satisfaction in the Teaching of DC/DC and DC/AC Converters\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMartinez-Rodrigo, Fernando; Herrero-De Lucas, Luis Carlos; de Pablo, Santiago; Rey-Boue, Alexis B.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis paper examines the question of how to use project-based learning to increase student performance and satisfaction in a power electronics course addressing the topics of dc/dc and dc/ac converters, the assembly of a dc/dc converter, and the use of a commercial speed drive.

Mahdian; Sadati, N.; Hamzeh, M.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThis paper presents a robust dc-link voltage as well as a current control strategy for a bidirectional interlink converter (BIC) in a hybrid ac/dc microgrid. To enhance the dc-bus voltage control, conventional methods strive to measure and feedforward the load or source power in the dc-bus control scheme. However, the conventional feedforward-based approaches require remote measurement with communications. Moreover, conventional methods suffer from stability and performance issues, mainly due to the use of the small-signal-based control design method. To overcome these issues, in this paper, the power from DG units of the dc subgrid imposed on the BIC is considered an unmeasurable disturbance signal. In the proposed method, in contrast to existing methods, using the nonlinear model of BIC, a robust controller that does not need the remote measurement with communications effectively rejects the impact of the disturbance signal imposed on the BIC's dc-link voltage. To avoid communication links, the robust controller has a plug-and-play feature that makes it possible to add a DG/load to or remove it from the dc subgrid without distorting the hybrid microgrid stability. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in MATLAB/SimPowerSystems software environment.\n\nFrequent statistics of link-layer bit stream data based on AC-IM algorithm\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCao, Chenghong; Lei, Yingke; Xu, Yiming\n\n2017-08-01\n\nAt present, there are many relevant researches on data processing using classical pattern matching and its improved algorithm, but few researches on statistical data of link-layer bit stream. This paper adopts a frequent statistical method of link-layer bit stream data based on AC-IM algorithm for classical multi-pattern matching algorithms such as AC algorithm has high computational complexity, low efficiency and it cannot be applied to binary bit stream data. The method's maximum jump distance of the mode tree is length of the shortest mode string plus 3 in case of no missing? In this paper, theoretical analysis is made on the principle of algorithm construction firstly, and then the experimental results show that the algorithm can adapt to the binary bit stream data environment and extract the frequent sequence more accurately, the effect is obvious. Meanwhile, comparing with the classical AC algorithm and other improved algorithms, AC-IM algorithm has a greater maximum jump distance and less time-consuming.\n\nSingle phase bi-directional AC-DC converter with reduced passive components size and common mode electro-magnetic interference\n\nDOEpatents\n\nMi, Chris; Li, Siqi\n\n2017-01-31\n\nA bidirectional AC-DC converter is presented with reduced passive component size and common mode electro-magnetic interference. The converter includes an improved input stage formed by two coupled differential inductors, two coupled common and differential inductors, one differential capacitor and two common mode capacitors. With this input structure, the volume, weight and cost of the input stage can be reduced greatly. Additionally, the input current ripple and common mode electro-magnetic interference can be greatly attenuated, so lower switching frequency can be adopted to achieve higher efficiency.\n\nModulation and control of matrix converter for aerospace application\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKobravi, Keyhan\n\nIn the context of modern aircraft systems, a major challenge is power conversion to supply the aircraft's electrical instruments. These instruments are energized through a fixed-frequency internal power grid. In an aircraft, the available sources of energy are a set of variable-speed generators which provide variable-frequency ac voltages. Therefore, to energize the internal power grid of an aircraft, the variable-frequency ac voltages should be converted to a fixed-frequency ac voltage. As a result, an ac to ac power conversion is required within an aircraft's power system. This thesis develops a Matrix Converter to energize the aircraft's internal power grid. The Matrix Converter provides a direct ac to ac power conversion. A major challenge of designing Matrix Converters for aerospace applications is to minimize the volume and weight of the converter. These parameters are minimized by increasing the switching frequency of the converter. To design a Matrix Converter operating at a high switching frequency, this thesis (i) develops a scheme to integrate fast semiconductor switches within the current available Matrix Converter topologies, i.e., MOSFET-based Matrix Converter, and (ii) develops a new modulation strategy for the Matrix Converter. This Matrix Converter and the new modulation strategy enables the operation of the converter at a switching-frequency of 40kHz. To provide a reliable source of energy, this thesis also develops a new methodology for robust control of Matrix Converter. To verify the performance of the proposed MOSFET-based Matrix Converter, modulation strategy, and control design methodology, various simulation and experimental results are presented.

With the existing technology, high frequency power systems become possible. Use of such a system is advantageous in many aspects. A high frequency ac source is used as the direct input to an ac/ac pulse-density-modulation (PDM) converter. This converter is a new concept which employs zero voltage switching techniques. However, the development of this converter is still in its infancy stage. There are problems associated with this converter such as a high on-voltage drop, switching transients, and zero-crossing detecting. Considering these problems, the switching speed and power handling capabilities of the MOS-Controlled Thyristor (MCT) makes the device the most promising candidate for this application. A complete insight of component considerations for building an ac/ac PDM converter for a high frequency power system is addressed. A power device review is first presented. The ac/ac PDM converter requires switches that can conduct bi-directional current and block bi-directional voltage. These bi-directional switches can be constructed using existing power devices. Different bi-directional switches for the converter are investigated. Detailed experimental studies of the characteristics of the MCT under hard switching and zero-voltage switching are also presented. One disadvantage of an ac/ac converter is that turn-on and turn-off of the switches has to be completed instantaneously when the ac source is at zero voltage. Otherwise shoot-through current or voltage spikes can occur which can be hazardous to the devices. In order for the devices to switch softly in the safe operating area even under non-ideal cases, a unique snubber circuit is used in each bi-directional switch. Detailed theory and experimental results for circuits using these snubbers are presented. A current regulated ac/ac PDM converter built using MCT's and IGBT's is\n\nLinking results of key and supplementary comparisons of AC/DC voltage transfer references\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVelychko, Oleh\n\n2018-04-01\n\nA regional key comparison (KC) COOMET.EM-K6.a and a supplementary comparison (SC) COOMET.EM-S1 of AC/DC voltage transfer references were conducted between participating laboratories from the Eurasian region.

Moreover, new regulations have been established to improve the collective gas mileage, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce dependence on foreign oil. This paper primarily focuses on two major thrust areas of PHEVs.

Second, it presents an integrated bidirectional noninverted buck boost converter that interfaces the energy storagemoreÂ Â» device of the PHEV to the dc link in both grid-connected and driving modes. The proposed bidirectional converter has minimal grid-level disruptions in terms of power factor and total harmonic distortion, with less switching noise.

In addition, while driving, the dc/dc converter provides a regulated dc link voltage to the motor drive and captures the braking energy during regenerative braking.Â«Â less\n\nModel Predictive Control of A Matrix-Converter Based Solid State Transformer for Utility Grid Interaction\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nXue, Yaosuo\n\nThe matrix converter solid state transformer (MC-SST), formed from the back-to-back connection of two three-to-single-phase matrix converters, is studied for use in the interconnection of two ac grids. The matrix converter topology provides a light weight and low volume single-stage bidirectional ac-ac power conversion without the need for a dc link. Thus, the lifetime limitations of dc-bus storage capacitors are avoided. However, space vector modulation of this type of MC-SST requires to compute vectors for each of the two MCs, which must be carefully coordinated to avoid commutation failure. An additional controller is also required to control power exchange betweenmoreÂ Â» the two ac grids. In this paper, model predictive control (MPC) is proposed for an MC-SST connecting two different ac power grids. The proposed MPC predicts the circuit variables based on the discrete model of MC-SST system and the cost function is formulated so that the optimal switch vector for the next sample period is selected, thereby generating the required grid currents for the SST. Simulation and experimental studies are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and simplicity of the proposed MPC for such MC-SST-based grid interfacing systems.Â«Â less\n\nAC power generation from microbial fuel cells\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLobo, Fernanda Leite; Wang, Heming; Forrestal, Casey; Ren, Zhiyong Jason\n\n2015-11-01\n\nMicrobial fuel cells (MFCs) directly convert biodegradable substrates to electricity and carry good potential for energy-positive wastewater treatment. However, the low and direct current (DC) output from MFC is not usable for general electronics except small sensors, yet commercial DC-AC converters or inverters used in solar systems cannot be directly applied to MFCs. This study presents a new DC-AC converter system for MFCs that can generate alternating voltage in any desired frequency. Results show that AC power can be easily achieved in three different frequencies tested (1, 10, 60 Hz), and no energy storage layer such as capacitors was needed. The DC-AC converter efficiency was higher than 95% when powered by either individual MFCs or simple MFC stacks. Total harmonic distortion (THD) was used to investigate the quality of the energy, and it showed that the energy could be directly usable for linear electronic loads. This study shows that through electrical conversion MFCs can be potentially used in household electronics for decentralized off-grid communities.\n\nHybrid inverter for HVDC/weak AC system interconnection\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTam, K.S.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThe concept of the hybrid converter is introduced. By independently controlling a naturally commutated converter (NCC) and an artificially commutated converter (ACC), real power and reactive power can be controlled independently. Alternatively, the ac bus voltage can be regulated without affecting the real power transfer. Independent control is feasible only within certain operating boundaries. Twelve pulse operation, sequential control, and complementary circuits may be viewed as variations of the hybrid converter. The concept of the hybrid converter is demonstrated by digital simulation. At the current state of technology, the NCC is best implemented by a 6-pulse bridge using thyristors asmoreÂ Â» the switching elements. A survey of power electronics applicable to HVDC applications reveals that the capacitively commutated current-sourced converters are either technically or economically better than the other alternatives for the implementation of the ACC. The digital simulation results show that the problems of operating an HVDC system into a weak ac system can be solved by using a hybrid inverter. A new control scheme, the zero Q control, is developed. With no reactive power interaction between the dc system and the ac system, the stability of the HVDC/weak ac system operation is significantly improved. System start-up and fault recovery is fast and stable.Â«Â less\n\nA circular polarization converter based on in-linked loop antenna frequency selective surface\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Shen-Yun; Liu, Wei; Geyi, Wen\n\n2018-06-01\n\nIn this paper, we report the design, fabrication and measurement of a circular polarization converter based on an in-linked loop-antenna frequency selective surface.

The report presents the basic benefits of the new technology along with the basic control blocks needed to implement the design. The report also describes a model of the BTB-VSC implemented in EMTDC{trademark} and discusses the use of the model. Simulation results, showing how the model responds to various control actions and system disturbances, are presented. This modeling work developed a detailed EMTDC{trademark} model using the appropriate converter technologymoreÂ Â» and magnetic interface configuration. Various possible converter and magnetic interface configurations were examined and the most promising configuration was used for the model. The chosen configuration minimizes the number of high voltage transformers needed and minimizes the complexity non-standard interfacing transformers. There is no need for transformers with phase shifts other than zero or thirty degrees (wye-wye or wye-delta). The only non-standard feature is the necessity of bringing the neutral side of the high voltage winding on the wye-wye unit out through bushings and to insulate the wye-wye transformer for the system voltage which is twice the transformer winding voltage. The developed EMTDC{trademark} model was used to demonstrate the possibility of achieving independent control of the real power transmitted and the voltages at the AC terminals. The model also demonstrates the ability to interconnect weak AC systems without the necessity of additional voltage support equipment as is the case with the conventional back-to-back DC interconnection. The model has been shown to work with short circuit ratios less than 2 based on the total rating of the high voltage transformers.Â«Â less\n\nObserver-based higher order sliding mode control of power factor in three-phase AC/DC converter for hybrid electric vehicle applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Jianxing; Laghrouche, Salah; Wack, Maxime\n\n2014-06-01\n\nIn this paper, a full-bridge boost power converter topology is studied for power factor control, using output higher order sliding mode control.

It is one of the largest and most expensive component in most of the high voltage and high power systems. Its size is inversely proportional to the operating frequency. The central idea behind a power electronic transformer (PET) also known as solid state transformer is to reduce the size of the transformer by increasing the frequency. Power electronic converters are used to change the frequency of operation. Steady reduction in the cost of the semiconductor switches and the advent of advanced magnetic materials with very low loss density and high saturation flux density implies economic viability and feasibility of a design with high power density. Application of PET is in generation of power from renewable energy sources, especially wind and solar. Other important application include grid tied inverters, UPS e.t.c. In this thesis non-resonant, single stage, bi-directional PET is considered. The main objective of this converter is to generate adjustable speed and magnitude pulse width modulated (PWM) ac waveforms from an ac or dc grid with a high frequency ac link. The windings of a high frequency transformer contains leakage inductance. Any switching transition of the power electronic converter connecting the inductive load and the transformer requires commutation of leakage energy. Commutation by passive means results in power loss, decrease in the frequency of operation, distortion in the output voltage waveform, reduction in reliability and power density. In this work a source based partially loss-less commutation of leakage energy has been proposed. This technique also results in partial soft-switching. A series of converters with novel PWM strategies have been proposed to minimize the frequency of leakage inductance commutation.

Such links, however, result in bulky dc capacitors and/or inductors and lead to relatively high losses in the converters due to stresses on the semiconductor switches. The feasibility of utilizing a high frequency sinusoidal voltage link to accomplish the energy storage and decoupling function is examined. In particular, a type of resonant six pulse bridge interface converter is proposed which utilizes zero voltage switching principles to minimize switching losses and uses an easy to implement technique for pulse density modulation to control the amplitude, frequency, and the waveshape of the synthesized low frequency voltage or current. Adaptation of the proposed topology for power conversion to single-phase ac and dc voltage or current outputs is shown to be straight forward.

The Schwarz converter has the important assets of both inherent fault tolerance and resonant operation; parallel operation in modular form is possible. A regulated dc spacecraft bus requires only a single stage converter while a constant frequency ac bus requires a cascaded Schwarz converter configuration.

In this research, a focus has been to develop a hardware test system to evaluate AC system stability. As a first step, a time domain model of a two converter microgrid was established in which a three phase inverter acts as a power source and an active rectifier serves as an adjustable constant power AC load. The constant power load can be utilized to create rapid power flow transients to the generating system. As a second step, the inverter and active rectifier were designed using a Smart Power Module IGBT for switching and an embedded microcontroller as a processor for algorithm implementation. The inverter and active rectifier were designed to operate simultaneously using a synchronization signal to ensure each respective local controller operates in a common reference frame. Finally, the physical system was created and initial testing performed to validate the hardware functionality as a variable amplitude and variable frequency AC system.\n\nAn Improved Power Quality Based Sheppard-Taylor Converter Fed BLDC Motor Drive\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSingh, Bhim; Bist, Vashist\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThis paper deals with the design and analysis of a power factor correction based Sheppard-Taylor converter fed brushless dc motor (BLDCM) drive. The speed of the BLDCM is controlled by adjusting the dc link voltage of the voltage source inverter (VSI) feeding BLDCM. Moreover, a low frequency switching of the VSI is used for electronically commutating the BLDCM for reduced switching losses. The Sheppard-Taylor converter is designed to operate in continuous conduction mode to achieve an improved power quality at the ac mains for a wide range of speed control and supply voltage variation. The BLDCM drive is designed and its performance is simulated in a MATLAB/Simulink environment to achieve the power quality indices within the limits of the international power quality standard IEC-61000-3-2.\n\nThe Effects of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I) on Human N-Acetyl-Seryl-Aspartyl-Lysyl-Proline (Ac-SDKP) Levels: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMnguni, Ayanda Trevor; Engel, Mark E; Borkum, Megan S; Mayosi, Bongani M\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTuberculous pericardial effusion is a pro-fibrotic condition that is complicated by constrictive pericarditis in 4% to 8% of cases. N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) is a ubiquitous tetrapeptide with anti-fibrotic properties that is low in tuberculous pericardial effusion, thus providing a potential mechanism for the heightened fibrotic state. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), which increase Ac-SDKP levels with anti-fibrotic effects in animal models, are candidate drugs for preventing constrictive pericarditis if they can be shown to have similar effects on Ac-SDKP and fibrosis in human tissues. To systematically review the effects of ACE-Is on Ac-SDKP levels in human tissues. We searched five electronic databases (1996 to 2014) and conference abstracts with no language restrictions. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO. Four studies with a total of 206 participants met the inclusion criteria. Three studies (106 participants) assessed the change in plasma levels of Ac-SDKP following ACE-I administration in healthy humans. The administration of an ACE-I was associated with an increase in Ac-SDKP levels (mean difference (MD) 5.07 pmol/ml (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.64 pmol/ml to 9.51 pmol/ml)). Two studies with 100 participants further assessed the change in Ac-SDKP level in humans with renal failure using ACE-I. The administration of an ACE-I was associated with a significant increase in Ac-SDKP levels (MD 8.94 pmol/ml; 95% CI 2.55 to 15.33; I2 = 44%). ACE-I increased Ac-SDKP levels in human plasma. These findings provide the rationale for testing the impact of ACE-I on Ac-SDKP levels and fibrosis in tuberculous pericarditis.\n\nIsolated and soft-switched power converter\n\nDOEpatents\n\nPeng, Fang Zheng; Adams, Donald Joe\n\n2002-01-01\n\nAn isolated and soft-switched power converter is used for DC/DC and DC/DC/AC power conversion. The power converter includes two resonant tank circuits coupled back-to-back through an isolation transformer. Each resonant tank circuit includes a pair of resonant capacitors connected in series as a resonant leg, a pair of tank capacitors connected in series as a tank leg, and a pair of switching devices with anti-parallel clamping diodes coupled in series as resonant switches and clamping devices for the resonant leg. The power converter is well suited for DC/DC and DC/DC/AC power conversion applications in which high-voltage isolation, DC to DC voltage boost, bidirectional power flow, and a minimal number of conventional switching components are important design objectives. For example, the power converter is especially well suited to electric vehicle applications and load-side electric generation and storage systems, and other applications in which these objectives are important. The power converter may be used for many different applications, including electric vehicles, hybrid combustion/electric vehicles, fuel-cell powered vehicles with low-voltage starting, remote power sources utilizing low-voltage DC power sources, such as photovoltaics and others, electric power backup systems, and load-side electric storage and generation systems.\n\nInput-current shaped ac to dc converters\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe problem of achieving near unity power factor while supplying power to a dc load from a single phase ac source of power is examined. Power processors for this application must perform three functions: input current shaping, energy storage, and output voltage regulation. The methods available for performing each of these three functions are reviewed. Input current shaping methods are either active or passive, with the active methods divided into buck-like and boost-like techniques. In addition to large reactances, energy storage methods include resonant filters, active filters, and active storage schemes. Fast voltage regulation can be achieved by post regulation or by supplementing the current shaping topology with an extra switch. Some indications of which methods are best suited for particular applications concludes the discussion.\n\nThe conserved baculovirus protein p33 (Ac92) is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-linked sulfhydryl oxidase\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLong, C.M.; Rohrmann, G.F.; Merrill, G.F., E-mail: merrillg@onid.orst.ed\n\n2009-06-05\n\nOpen reading frame 92 of the Autographa californica baculovirus (Ac92) is one of about 30 core genes present in all sequenced baculovirus genomes.

This real time simulation considers the strength of the AC system to witch is connected and his relativity with the capacity of the DC link. The results obtained are validated by means of RT-lab platform using digital Real time simulator Hypersim (OP-5600), the results carried out show the effect of the DC control and the influence of the protection function to reduce the probability of commutation failures and also for helping inverter to take out from commutation failure even while the DC control fails to eliminate them.

This tendency cooperating with the continuous investing on the renewable energy resources drives the research, development, and construction of HVDC projects to create a more reliable, affordable, and environmentally friendly power grid. Constructing the hybrid AC-HVDC grid is a significant move in the development of the HVDC techniques; the form of dc system is evolving from the point-to-point stand-alone dc links to the embedded HVDC system and the multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) system. The MTDC is a solution for the renewable energy interconnections, and the MTDC grids can improve the power system reliability, flexibility in economic dispatches, and converter/cable utilizing efficiencies. The dissertation reviews the HVDC technologies, discusses the stability issues regarding the ac and HVDC connections, proposes a novel power oscillation control strategy to improve system stability, and develops a nonlinear voltage droop control strategy for the MTDC grid. To verify the effectiveness the proposed power oscillation control strategy, a long distance paralleled AC-HVDC transmission test system is employed. Based on the PSCAD/EMTDC platform simulation results, the proposed power oscillation control strategy can improve the system dynamic performance and attenuate the power oscillations effectively. To validate the nonlinear voltage droop control strategy, three droop controls schemes are designed according to the proposed nonlinear voltage droop control design procedures. These control schemes are tested in a hybrid AC-MTDC system. The hybrid AC-MTDC system, which is first proposed in this dissertation, consists of two ac grids, two wind farms and a five-terminal HVDC grid connecting them. Simulation studies are performed in the PSCAD/EMTDC platform. According to the simulation results, all the three design schemes have their unique salient\n\nVoltage balanced multilevel voltage source converter system\n\nDOEpatents\n\nPeng, Fang Zheng; Lai, Jih-Sheng\n\n1997-01-01\n\nA voltage balanced multilevel converter for high power AC applications such as adjustable speed motor drives and back-to-back DC intertie of adjacent power systems.

In DC system, converter transformer is the core equipment of AC and DC power converter and inverter. converter transformer tap adjustment can maintain the normal operation of the converter in small angle range control, the absorption of reactive power, economic operation, valve less stress, valve damping circuit loss, AC / DC harmonic component is also smaller. In this way, the tap switch action is more frequent, and a large range of the tap switch adjustment is required. Converter transformer with a more load voltage regulation switch, the voltage regulation range of the switch is generally 20~30%, the adjustment of each file is 1%~2%. Recently it is often found that the tap switch of Converter Transformers is out of step in Converter station. In this paper, it is analyzed in detail the impact of tap switch out of step for differential protection, overexcitation protection and zero sequence over current protection. Analysis results show that: the tap switch out of step has no effect on the differential protection and the overexcitation protection including the tap switch. But the tap switch out of step has effect on zero sequence overcurrent protection of out of step star-angle converter transformer. The zero sequence overcurrent protection will trip when the tap switch out of step is greater than 3 for out of step star-angle converter transformer.\n\nA Novel Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Mutation (S333W) Impairs N-Domain Enzymatic Cleavage of the Anti-Fibrotic Peptide, AcSDKP\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDanilov, Sergei M.; Wade, Michael S.; Schwager, Sylva L.; Douglas, Ross G.; Nesterovitch, Andrew B.; Popova, Isolda A.; Hogarth, Kyle D.; Bhardwaj, Nakul; Schwartz, David E.; Sturrock, Edward D.; Garcia, Joe G. N.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) has two functional N- and C-domain active centers that display differences in the metabolism of biologically-active peptides including the hemoregulatory tetrapeptide, Ac-SDKP, hydrolysed preferentially by the N domain active center. Elevated Ac-SDKP concentrations are associated with reduced tissue fibrosis. Results We identified a patient of African descent exhibiting unusual blood ACE kinetics with reduced relative hydrolysis of two synthetic ACE substrates (ZPHL/HHL ratio) suggestive of the ACE N domain center inactivation. Inhibition of blood ACE activity by anti-catalytic mAbs and ACE inhibitors and conformational fingerprint of blood ACE suggested overall conformational changes in the ACE molecule and sequencing identified Ser333Trp substitution in the N domain of ACE. In silico analysis demonstrated S333W localized in the S1 pocket of the active site of the N domain with the bulky Trp adversely affecting binding of ACE substrates due to steric hindrance. Expression of mutant ACE (S333W) in CHO cells confirmed altered kinetic properties of mutant ACE and conformational changes in the N domain. Further, the S333W mutant displayed decreased ability (5-fold) to cleave the physiological substrate AcSDKP compared to wild-type ACE. Conclusions and Significance A novel Ser333Trp ACE mutation results in dramatic changes in ACE kinetic properties and lowered clearance of Ac-SDKP. Individuals with this mutation (likely with significantly increased levels of the hemoregulatory tetrapeptide in blood and tissues), may confer protection against fibrosis.

This paper presents two different AC-DC conversion techniques for multiple patch harvesters, namely single rectifier and respective rectifiers. The first case considers all the piezo-patches are connected in parallel to a single rectifier, whereas in the second case, each harvester is respectively rectified and then connected in parallel to a smoothing capacitor and a resistive load. The latter configuration of AC-DC conversion helps to avoid the electrical charge cancellation which is a problem with the multiple harvesters attached to different locations of the host plate surface. Equivalent circuit model of the multiple piezo-patch harvesters is developed in the SPICE software to simulate the electrical response. The system parameters are obtained from the modal analysis solution of the plate. Simulations of the voltage frequency response functions (FRFs) for the standard AC input - AC output case are conducted and validated by experimental data. Finally, for the AC input - DC output case, numerical simulation and experimental results of the power outputs of multiple piezo-patch harvesters with multiple AC-DC converters are obtained for a wide range of resistive loads and compared with the same array of harvesters connected to a single AC-DC converter.\n\nDischarging a DC bus capacitor of an electrical converter system\n\nDOEpatents\n\nKajouke, Lateef A; Perisic, Milun; Ransom, Ray M\n\n2014-10-14\n\nA system and method of discharging a bus capacitor of a bidirectional matrix converter of a vehicle are presented here.

The unstructured nature of these text-based documents makes it challenging to easily browse and query the data of interest in them. One approach to facilitate browsing and querying biomedical text is to convert the plain text to a linked web of data, i.e., converting data originally in free text to structured formats with defined meta-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce Semantator (Semantic Annotator), a semantic-web-based environment for annotating data of interest in biomedical documents, browsing and querying the annotated data, and interactively refining annotation results if needed. Through Semantator, information of interest can be either annotated manually or semi-automatically using plug-in information extraction tools. The annotated results will be stored in RDF and can be queried using the SPARQL query language. In addition, semantic reasoners can be directly applied to the annotated data for consistency checking and knowledge inference. Semantator has been released online and was used by the biomedical ontology community who provided positive feedbacks. Our evaluation results indicated that (1) Semantator can perform the annotation functionalities as designed; (2) Semantator can be adopted in real applications in clinical and transactional research; and (3) the annotated results using Semantator can be easily used in Semantic-web-based reasoning tools for further inference.
