        "text": "Aging and lifetime prediction of O-ring seals\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKoemmling, Anja\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn some applications, elastomer seals have to remain leak tight over extended time periods (up to several decades) as an exchange of the seals is not practical. Therefore, it is necessary to be able to predict the lifetime of such seals reliably. For this reason, ageing experiments with O-rings and sheets based on hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR), ethylene propylene diene rubber (EPDM) and fluorocarbon rubber (FKM) were performed over up to two years at different temperatures. For investigating the changes of material properties during ageing, measurements of i.a. hardness and tensile behaviour as well as dynamic-mechanical and thermogravimetric analyses were conducted. For assessing the relaxation and recovery behaviour of the ageing seals, compression stress relaxation and compression set experiments were performed. Furthermore, leakage rate was measured to detect seal failure. By examining the aged samples, both the property changes and the responsible degradation mechanisms were characterised. Additionally, the most suitable approach for lifetime predictions should be determined using the large database of results from different test methods performed at several ageing times and temperatures. This included identifying an end-of-lifetime criterion that correlates with leakage and thus seal failure. Regarding the property changes and degradation mechanisms of HNBR, a pronounced embrittlement was observed due to dominant crosslinking reactions during ageing. These also resulted in a decrease of oxygen permeability, leading to a reduction of the oxygen transport into the interior sample (mainly of the thicker O-rings). This resulted in diffusion-limited oxidation effects (DLO effects), meaning that the interior of the sample aged less strongly than regions close to the surface. During ageing of EPDM, both chain scission and crosslinking occurred, which became noticeable in deteriorated tensile properties and decreased compression force as well as\n\nCrosslinking of SAVY-4000 O-rings as a Function of Aging Conditions\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nVan Buskirk, Caleb Griffith [Los Alamos National Lab. (LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)\n\n2017-09-08\n\nSAVY-4000 containers were developed as a part of DOE M 441.1-1 to protect workers who handle stored nuclear material from exposure due to loss of containment.1 The SAVY-4000 is comprised of three parts: a lid, a container, and a cross-linked fluoropolymer O-ring. Degradation of the O-ring during use could limit the lifetime of the SAVY-4000. In order to quantify the chemical changes of the Oring over time, the molecular weight between crosslinks was determined as a function of aging conditions using a swelling technique. Because the O-ring is a cross-linked polymer, it will absorb solvent into its matrix without dissolving. The relative amount of solvent uptake can be related to the degree of crosslinking using an equation developed by Paul Flory and John Rehner Jr3. This method was used to analyze O-ring samples aged under thermal and ionizing-radiation conditions. It was found that at the harsher thermal gaining conditions in absence of ionizing-radiation the average molecular weight between crosslinks decreased, indicating a rise in crosslinks, which may be attributable to advanced aging with no ionizing radiation present. Inversely, in the presence of ionizing radiation it was found that material has a higher level of cross-linking with age. This information could be used to help predict the lifetime of the O-rings in SAVY-4000 containers under service conditions.\n\nREVIEW OF AGING DATA ON EPDM O-RINGS IN THE H1616 SHIPPING PACKAGE\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSkidmore, E.\n\n2012-03-27\n\nCurrently, all H1616 shipping package containers undergo annual re-verification testing, including containment vessel leak testing to verify leak-tightness (<1 x 10{sup -7} ref cc/sec air) as per ANSI N14.5. The purpose of this literature review is to supplement aging studies currently being performed by SRNL on the EPDM O-rings to provide the technical basis for extending annual re-verification testing for the H1616 shipping package and to predict the life of the seals at bounding service conditions. The available data suggest that the EPDM O-rings can retain significant mechanical properties and sealing force at or below bounding service temperatures (169 F or 76 C) beyond the 1 year maintenance period. Interpretation of available data suggests that a service life of at least 2 years and potentially 4-6 years may be possible at bounding temperatures. Seal lifetimes at lower, more realistic temperatures will likely be longer. Being a hydrocarbon elastomer, EPDM O-rings may exhibit an inhibition period due to the presence of antioxidants. Once antioxidants are consumed, mechanical properties and seal performance could decline at a faster rate. Testing is being performed to validate the assumptions outlined in this report and to assess the long-term performance of O-ring seals under actual service conditions.\n\nFY2017 status report: Model 9975 O-ring fixture long-term leak performance\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDaugherty, W. L. [Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States). Savannah River National Lab. (SRNL)\n\n2017-07-27\n\nA series of experiments to monitor the aging performance of VitonÂ® GLT and GLT-S O-rings used in the Model 9975 shipping package has been ongoing since 2004 at the Savannah River National Laboratory. One approach has been to periodically evaluate the leak performance of O-rings being aged in mock-up 9975 Primary Containment Vessels (PCVs) at elevated temperature. Other methods such as compression-stress relaxation (CSR) tests and field surveillance are also on-going to evaluate O-ring behavior. Seventy tests using PCV mock-ups with GLT O-rings were assembled and heated to temperatures ranging from 200 to 450 ÂºF. They were leak-tested initially and have been tested periodically to determine if they continue to meet the leak-tightness criterion defined in ANSI standard N14.5-97. Due to material substitution, a smaller test matrix with fourteen additional tests was initiated in 2008 with GLT-S O-rings heated to temperatures ranging from 200 to 400 ÂºF. Leak test failures have been experienced in all of the GLT O-ring fixtures aging at 350 ÂºF and higher temperatures, and in 8 fixtures aging at 300 ÂºF. The 300 Â°F GLT O-ring fixtures failed after 2.8 to 5.7 years at temperature. The remaining GLT O-ring fixtures aging at 300 ÂºF were retired from testing following more than 5 years at temperature without failure. No failures have yet been observed in GLT O-ring fixtures aging at 200 ÂºF for 9 to 10.5 years, or in GLT O-ring fixtures aging at 270 ÂºF for 5.7 years. These aging temperatures bound O-ring temperatures anticipated during normal storage in K-Area Complex (KAC). Leak test failures have been experienced in all of the GLT-S O-ring fixtures aging at 300 ÂºF and above. No failures have yet been observed in GLT-S O-ring fixtures aging at 200 and 250 ÂºF for 6.9 to 7.5 years. Data from the O-ring fixtures are generally consistent with results from compression stress relaxation testing, and provide confidence in the predictive models based on those results\n\nAging Behavior of Viton{sup R} O-Ring Seals in the 9975 Shipping Package - 12594\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSkidmore, T. Eric; Daugherty, William L.; Hoffman, Elizabeth N.; Dunn, Kerry A.; Stephen Bellamy, J. [Savannah River National Laboratory, Aiken, SC 29808 (United States); Shuler, James M. [U.S. DOE Packaging Certification Program (United States)\n\n2012-07-01\n\nThe Savannah River Site (SRS) is storing plutonium (Pu) materials in the K-Area Materials Storage (KAMS) facility. The Pu materials were packaged according to the DOE-STD-3013 standard and shipped to the SRS in Type B 9975 packages. The robust 9975 shipping package was not designed for long-term product storage, but it is a specified part of the storage configuration and the KAMS facility safety basis credits the 9975 design with containment. Within the 9975 package, nested stainless steel containment vessels are closed with dual O-ring seals based on Viton{sup R} GLT or GLT-S fluoro-elastomer. The aging behavior of the O-ring compounds is being studied to provide the facility with advanced notice of nonconformance and to develop life prediction models. A combination of field surveillance, leak testing of surrogate fixtures aged at bounding service temperatures, and accelerated-aging methodologies based on compression stress-relaxation and oxygen consumption analysis is being used to evaluate seal performance. A summary of the surveillance program relative to seal aging behavior is presented. The aging behavior of fluoro-elastomer seals based on Viton{sup R} GLT and GLT-S is being studied to develop life prediction models in support of long-term storage of plutonium materials in the 9975 shipping packages at the Savannah River Site. Field surveillance data in combination with accelerated-aging data suggest a significant lifetime for the seals. Typical storage conditions are not anticipated to challenge the leak-tightness of the seals for many years. Early life prediction models based on compression stress relaxation indicate a seal lifetime of â¼12 years at the maximum service temperature predicted (93 deg. C). Seal lifetimes at lower, more realistic conditions are likely significantly longer. Service life predictions based on CSR data are thus far conservative relative to predictions based on time to leakage failure.

GLT O-rings used in the Model 9975 package has been ongoing for six years at the Savannah River National Laboratory. Sixty-seven mock-ups of 9975 Primary Containment Vessels (PCVs) were assembled and heated to temperatures ranging from 200 to 450 F. They were leak-tested initially and have been tested at nominal six month intervals to determine if they meet the criterion of leaktightness defined in ANSI standard N14.5-97. Fourteen additional tests were initiated in 2008 with GLT-S O-rings heated to temperatures ranging from 200 to 400 F. High temperature aging continues for 36 GLT O-ring fixtures at 200--350 F. Room temperature leak test failures have been experienced in 5 of the GLT O-ring fixtures aging at 300 and 350 F, and in all 3 of the GLT O-ring fixtures aging at higher temperatures. No failures have yet been observed in GLT O-ring fixtures aging at 200 F for 30--48 months, which is still bounding to O-ring temperatures during storage in KAMS. High temperature aging continues for 6 GLT-S O-ring fixtures at 200--300 F. Room temperature leak test failures have been experienced in all 8 of the GLT-S O-ring fixtures aging at 350 and 400 F. No failures have yet been observed in GLT-S O-ring fixtures aging at 200 or 300 F for 19 months. For O-ring fixtures that have failed the room temperature leak test and been disassembled, the O-rings displayed a compression set ranging from 51--95%. This is significantly greater than seen to date for packages inspected during KAMS field surveillance (23% average). For GLT O-rings, service life based on the room temperature leak rate criterion is comparable to that predicted by compression stress relaxation (CSR) data at higher temperatures (350--400 F). While there are no comparable failure data yet at aging temperatures below 300 F, extrapolations of the data for GLT O-rings suggests that CSR model predictions provide a conservative prediction of service\n\nInvestigation on thermal oxidative aging of nitrile rubber (NBR) O-rings under compression stress\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLiu, X. R.; Zhang, W. F.; Lou, W. T.; Huang, Y. X.; Dai, W.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe degradation behaviors of nitrile rubber O-rings exposure to air under compression were investigated at three elevated temperatures. The physical and mechanical properties of the aging samples before and after exposure at selected time were studied by measuring weight loss, tensile strength and elongation at break. The Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and fracture morphology were used to reveal the microstructural changes of the aging samples. The results indicate that the weight decreased with exposure time and temperature. Based on the results of the crosslinking density, the crosslinking predominates during the most of aging process. The significant changes in tensile strength and elongation at break also indicate the severe degradation in air. The fracture morphology results show that the fracture surface after 64 days of exposure to air turns rough and present defects. The ATR-FTIR results demonstrate that the hydroxyl groups were formed for the samples aged in air.\n\nA Study for Shelf Life Evaluation of Rubber O-ring\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJung, Sun Chul; Kim, Jong Seog\n\n2005-01-01\n\nNon-metallic materials stored in warehouses in nuclear power plants have shelf life. The shelf life means the maximum storage time allowable such that the install life of the material is not affected. Materials whose shelf lives expire are generally discarded. unless the shelf lives of these materials can be extended by reducing the install life. Examples of this case are rubber materials. Rubber materials are widely used for sealing of various machines. There are various life evaluation methods for rubber material. For example, the compression set is generally used for evaluation the aging condition of rubber materials used for sealing. A compression set value can be calculated according to the ASTM D395. We have tried the compression set test by using specimens with 6.99mm diameter O-ring even when ASTM D 395 recommends the use of bar specimen. Test results and comparison between O-ring and reference data of EPRI NP-6608 are presented below\n\nA study on the method for estimating the life time of O-rings made of NBR used in sealing air operating cylinders\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFujii, Yuzo; Mitsuta, Yasumasa\n\n2003-01-01\n\nAt nuclear power plants, a large number of O-rings made of rubber are attached to safety related machines and apparatus for sealing two metallic components. O-rings degrade during the long term exposure in environmental conditions in use, and finally lose the requested functions. Therefore it is important to exchange them in a proper period based on the precise life time estimation. This study aimed at to investigate the method for estimating the life time of O-rings made of NBR (acrylonitrile butadiene rubber) attached to the air cylinders which drive the dampers of ventilation systems in nuclear power plants. It has been conducted as follows: (1) After confirming that the main cause of degradation of O-rings is thermo-oxidation reaction, thermally accelerated aging tests were carried out for O-rings with three different temperatures. (2) It was certified that the elongation values of O-rings obtained by the tests could be fitted by the Arrhenius rule, and then the life time of O-rings was estimated using the Arrhenius rule. (3) In order to validate the reliability of this estimation, we measured the elongation values of the O-rings which had been actually used at nuclear power plants, and compared them to the predicted elongation values obtained by the above estimation. The average and standard deviation of the values which is calculated by the equation {(measured value-predicted value)/ predicted value} are 11% and 8%, respectively and there are small errors between the measured value and the predicted values. As a result we can judge that good estimation of life time of O-rings can be done by the above method.

Within this framework, this paper provides a state-of-knowledge summary of the influence of 'juvenile' isotope effects, ageing effects, and genetic effects, as well as the interchangeability of species, choice of ring segment to analyze (whole ring, earlywood or latewood), and the option of sample pooling. The range of isotopic composition of the same ring among trees at a site is ca. 1-3 per mille for Î´ 13 C, 1-4 per mille Î´ 18 O, and 5-30 per mille for Î´ 2 H, whereas the circumferential variability within a tree is lower. A standard prescription for sampling and analysis does not exist because of differences in field environmental circumstances and mixed findings represented in relevant published literature. Decisions in this regard will usually be tightly constrained by goals of the study and project resources. Sampling 4-6 trees at a site while avoiding juvenile effects in rings near the pith seems to be the most commonly used methodology, and although there are some reasoned arguments for analyzing only latewood and developing separate isotope records from each tree, the existence of some contradictory findings together with efforts to reduce cost and effort have prompted alternate strategies (e.g., most years pooled with occasional analysis of rings in the sequence separately for each tree) that have produced useful results in many studies.\n\nEleventh interim status report: Model 9975 O-Ring fixture long-term leak performance\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDaugherty, W. [Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States). Savannah River National Lab. (SRNL)\n\n2016-08-01\n\nA series of experiments to monitor the aging performance of VitonÂ® GLT O-rings used in the Model 9975 package has been ongoing since 2004 at the Savannah River National Laboratory.

The concrete permeability due to this cracking may rise significantly and thus increase leakage (in tank, nuclear containment...) and reduce the durability. The restrained shrinkage ring test is used to study the early age concrete behaviour (delayed strains evolution and cracking). This test shows, at 20 o C and without drying, for a concrete mix which is representative of a French nuclear power plant containment vessel (w/c ratio equal to 0.57), that the amplitude of autogenous shrinkage (about 40 Î¼m/m for the studied concrete mix) is not high enough to cause cracking. Indeed, in this configuration, thermal shrinkage is not significant, whereas this is a major concern for massive structures. Therefore, an active test has been developed to study cracking due to restrained thermal shrinkage. This test is an evolution of the classical restrained shrinkage ring test. It allows to take into account both autogenous and thermal shrinkages. Its principle is to create the thermal strain effects by increasing the temperature of the brass ring (by a fluid circulation) in order to expand it. With this test, the early age cracking due to restrained shrinkage, the influence of reinforcement and construction joints have been experimentally studied. It shows that, as expected, reinforcement leads to an increase of the number of cracks but a decrease of crack widths. Moreover, cracking occurs preferentially at the construction joint.\n\nLong-Term Leak Tightness Of O-Ring Seals In The 9975 Shipping Package\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHoffman, E.; Skidmore, E.; Daugherty, W.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nO-ring seals in the 9975 shipping package containment vessels are fabricated from a Viton GLT or GLT-S compound. Long-term testing of these O-rings has been performed to support service life predictions for packages used for long-term storage. Since the only criterion for O-ring performance is to maintain a leak-tight seal, leak testing is the primary indicator of service life. Fixtures have been aging at elevated temperatures to provide data for service life predictions. Limited leak test failures have been observed at the higher temperatures. This provides the opportunity for comparison to trends based on other O-ring properties, such as compression stress relaxation. Initial data suggest that the CSR data have some predictive value for a leak-tight service life, but other factors can complicate efforts to draw definitive conclusions.\n\nO-Ring sealing arrangements for ultra-high vacuum systems\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKim, Chang-Kyo; Flaherty, Robert\n\n1981-01-01\n\nAn all metal reusable O-ring sealing arrangement for sealing two concentric tubes in an ultra-high vacuum system. An O-ring of a heat recoverable alloy such as Nitinol is concentrically positioned between protruding sealing rings of the concentric tubes. The O-ring is installed between the tubes while in a stressed martensitic state and is made to undergo a thermally induced transformation to an austenitic state. During the transformation the O-ring expands outwardly and contracts inwardly toward a previously sized austenitic configuration, thereby sealing against the protruding sealing rings of the concentric tubes.\n\nHelium and deuterium permeability in O-rings\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLakner, J.F.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nTo obtain more information on gas permeation through elastomeric O-rings, studies were performed on Parker Seal Company O-rings, Nos. 2-113, 2-006, 3-904, and 3-906, all made of a nitrile rubber. Also included in the tests was a valve packing (Autoclave Engineers) encased in AE Valve 20A-2142. Permeation experiments were run usually in duplicate to 82.7 MPa (12,000 psi) with helium and deuterium at room temperature. The data are extrapolated to give values for tritium\n\nComposite correlation filter for O-ring detection in stationary colored noise\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHassebrook, Laurence G.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nO-rings are regularly replaced in aircraft and if they are not replaced or if they are installed improperly, they can result in catastrophic failure of the aircraft. It is critical that the o-rings be packaged correctly to avoid mistakes made by technicians during routine maintenance. For this reason, fines may be imposed on the o-ring manufacturer if the o-rings are packaged incorrectly. That is, a single o-ring must be packaged and labeled properly. No o-rings or more than one o-ring per package is not acceptable. We present an industrial inspection system based on real-time composite correlation filtering that has successfully solved this problem in spite of opaque paper o-ring packages. We present the system design including the composite filter design.\n\nBreakaway frictions of dynamic O-rings in mechanical seals\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLai, Tom; Kay, Peter\n\n1993-05-01\n\nBreakaway friction of a dynamic O-ring affects the mechanical seal's response to large axial shaft movement and face wear. However, little data exist to help designers. Therefore, a test rig was developed to measure breakaway friction. The research quantitatively shows the effects of lubrication with silicone grease and a change of surface finish. By using the Taguchi statistical experimental design method, the significance of test parameters was evaluated with a minimum number of tests. It was found that fluid pressure, dwell time, and O-ring percentage squeeze affect O-ring breakaway friction more than the O-ring cross sectional diameter and axial sliding speed within the range of values tested. The authors showed that breakaway friction increased linearly with pressure. However, O-rings made of different materials had significantly different increase rates, even if they had nominally the same durometer hardness. Breakaway friction also increased with logarithm of dwell time. Again, the increase rate depended strongly on the specific O-ring material tested. These observations led the authors to believe that the typical approach of generalizing data based on generic polymer type and durometer was inappropriate.\n\nResearch on degradation of vacuum O-rings under gamma radiation\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nIno, H; SaitÃ´, Y; Kubo, T; Kinsho, M\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe high-intensity proton accelerator being constructed by JAERI and KEK will generates greater beam power than conventional accelerators. The radiation emission due to beam losses will therefore increase. Since vacuum O-rings installed in the accelerator will be degraded badly by the radiation, there is need to find an O-ring that has more resistant to radiation. To find an O-ring that has better radiation resistant than that of the fluororubber used for conventional accelerators in general, some O-rings which are expected to have enough resistant to the radiation were irradiated, and estimated a degradation by measurement of outgassing rate, hardness, permeation time of helium gas, and an outward observation. Most of the O-rings were irradiated in an oxygen free atmosphere and in the air. The irradiations were carried out at room temperature in Co-60 gamma irradiation facility until a dose of 1 MGy was reached. The radiation resistance of PURE-RUBBER O-ring showed somewhat better than that of the fluororubb...\n\nA novel stress distribution analytical model of O-ring seals under different properties of materials\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWu, Di; Wang, Shao Ping; Wang, Xing Jian\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe elastomeric O-ring seals have been widely used as sealing elements in hydraulic systems. The sealing performance of O-ring seals is related to stress distribution. The stresses distribution depends on the squeeze rate and internal pressure, and would vary with properties of O-ring seals materials. Thus, in order to study the sealing performance of O-ring seals, it is necessary to describe the analytic relationship between stress distribution and properties of O-ring seals materials. For this purpose, a novel Stress distribution analytical model (SDAM) is proposed in this paper. The analytical model utilizes two stress complex functions to describe the stress distribution of O-ring seals. The proposed SDAM can express not only the analytical relationship between stress distribution and Youngâs modulus, but also the one between stress distribution and Poissonâs ratio. Finally, compared results between finite element analysis and the SDAM validate that the proposed model can effectively reveal the stress distribution under different properties for O-ring materials\n\nA novel stress distribution analytical model of O-ring seals under different properties of materials\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWu, Di; Wang, Shao Ping; Wang, Xing Jian [School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing (China)\n\n2017-01-15\n\nThe elastomeric O-ring seals have been widely used as sealing elements in hydraulic systems.

Investigated were the applicability of Lindley's formulae of contact force prediction and the Hertz theory. Three cases of O-ring installation were considered. The approximate solution of contact tractions and internal stresses of each case were derived. The key results are summarized as follows: 1. It is verified that Lindley's formulae predicts the relationship between the fractional compression and contact force. 2. In the case of Case I, II and III without internal pressure, it is found that a function form of the contact traction is the Hertzian. So it is possible to express the traction with a Hertzian form and correction factors. 3. The internal stresses are derived in the case of the Hertzian traction profile. The stresses at the center of O-ring show a satisfactory result when compared with the finite element result.\n\nPermeability test and fuzzy orthogonal analysis of hydrogenated nitrile O-ring\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nQin Hu\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available In the high temperature, high pressure and high corrosive environment of the oil and gas drilling downhole, the weatherability of rubber sealing material has a great influence on the production safety. In order to study the important degree of every key environmental factor in downhole influencing the sealing performance of rubber sealing material, a new device of simulating downhole environment is designed to test the permeability of O-ring. The sample is hydrogenated nitrile O-ring and orthogonal experiment method is used to do nine tests by getting three levels from temperature, pressure and CO2 volume fraction. Test adopts fuzzy orthogonal method to analyze the main effects and the interaction between two factors, taking tensile strength, diameter variety rate and pH value of indicator as evaluation index. The results show that: the environmental factor influencing the sealing performance of hydrogenated nitrile O-ring from high to low by turns is temperature, pressure and CO2 volume fraction, while the interaction between temperature and pressure is the most significant. It provides a new way to study the influence of downhole complex environment on the performance of rubber sealing material. Moreover, the results have important reference value to further study the failure mechanism of rubber sealing ring in many environmental factors and the rational use in engineering.\n\nIrregular AharonovâBohm effect for interacting electrons in a ZnO quantum ring\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChakraborty, Tapash; Manaselyan, Aram; Barseghyan, Manuk\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe electronic states and optical transitions of a ZnO quantum ring containing few interacting electrons in an applied magnetic field are found to be very different from those in a conventional semiconductor system, such as a GaAs ring. The strong Zeeman interaction and the Coulomb interaction of the ZnO system, two important characteristics of the electron system in ZnO, exert a profound influence on the electron states and on the optical properties of the ring. In particular, our results indicate that the AharonovâBohm (AB) effect in a ZnO quantum ring strongly depends on the electron number. In fact, for two electrons in the ZnO ring, the AB oscillations become aperiodic, while for three electrons (interacting) the AB oscillations completely disappear. Therefore, unlike in conventional quantum ring topology, here the AB effect (and the resulting persistent current) can be controlled by varying the electron number.

M.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe first observations of the storm-time ring current composition using AMPTE/CCE data showed that the O+ contribution to the ring current increases significantly during storms. The ring current is predominantly formed from inward transport of the near-earth plasma sheet. Thus the increase of O+ in the ring current implies that the ionospheric contribution to the plasma sheet has increased. The ionospheric plasma that reaches the plasma sheet can come from both the cusp and the nightside aurora. The cusp outflow moves through the lobe and enters the plasma sheet through reconnection at the near-earth neutral line. The nightside auroral outflow has direct access to nightside plasma sheet. Using data from Cluster and the Van Allen Probes spacecraft, we compare the development of storms in cases where there is a clear input of nightside auroral outflow, and in cases where there is a significant cusp input. We find that the cusp input, which enters the tail at ~15-20 Re becomes isotropized when it crosses the neutral sheet, and becomes part of the hot (>1 keV) plasma sheet population as it convects inward. The auroral outflow, which enters the plasma sheet closer to the earth, where the radius of curvature of the field line is larger, does not isotropize or become significantly energized, but remains a predominantly field aligned low energy population in the inner magnetosphere. It is the hot plasma sheet population that gets accelerated to high enough energies in the inner magnetosphere to contribute strongly to the ring current pressure. Thus it appears that O+ that enters the plasma sheet further down the tail has a greater impact on the storm-time ring current than ions that enter closer to the earth.\n\nRegulatory concerns for leakage testing of packagings with three O-ring closure seals\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOras, J.J.; Towell, R.H.; Wangler, M.E.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe American National Standard for Radioactive Materials--Leakage Tests on Packages for Shipment (ANSI N14.5) provides guidance for leakage rate testing to show that a particular packaging complies with regulatory requirements and also provides guidance in determining appropriate acceptance criteria. Recent radioactive packagings designs have incorporated three O-ring closure seals, the middle O-ring being the containment seal. These designs have the potential for false positive results of leakage rate tests. The volume between the containment O-ring and the inner O-ring is used for the helium gas required for the leakage rate tests to reduce both the amount of helium used and the time required to conduct the tests. A leak detector samples the evacuated volume between the outer O-ring and the containment O-ring. False positive results can be caused in two ways, a large leakage in the containment seal or leakage in the inner seal. This paper will describe the problem together with possible solutions/areas that need to be addressed in a Safety Analysis Report for Packagings before a particular packaging design can be certified for transport\n\nFormation of ring marks in stocked tilapia juveniles (Oreochromis aureus/O. niloticus (Perciformes: Cichlidae\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAna L IbaÃ±ez\n\n2007-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Lake MetztitlÃ¡n was dried up completely in the spring of 1998 and refilled in August of that year. In the period September-November, two cohorts of 1.6 million juveniles of a tilapia hybrid were stocked (Oreochromis aureus/O. niloticus, and monitored every month for one year. Since the date of birth of these juveniles was known, the analyses focused on whether the ring marks of the scales, sagittae and opercula or the circuli of the scales could be used to age them. The ring marks of the scales and opercula showed great variability, and the sagittae had a significant relationship with length, but it is unclear if at least the first ring mark could be formed at the hatchery and reflect changes in diet and/or tank movements in the fish farm. The circuli had a continuous regular behavior, with a formation rate of 10.38Â±0.93 and 11.38Â±0.95 circuli/month for the first and second cohorts, respectively. This proportion was maintained during the study period, and could be of help to calculate an approximate age of juveniles, especially in stocked fish that show multiple ring marks because of manipulation in fish farms and stocking events.

Face seals separating the spacecraft cabin from the debris filled environment are particularly susceptible; if the seal becomes contaminated there is potential for decreased performance, mission failure, or catastrophe. In this study, silicone elastomer O-rings were contaminated with JSC- 1A lunar regolith and their leak rate performance was evaluated. The leak rate values of contaminated O-rings at four levels of seal compression were compared to those of as-received, uncontaminated, O-rings. The results showed a drastic increase in leak rate after contamination. JSC-1A contaminated O-rings lead to immeasurably high leak rate values for all levels of compression except complete closure. Additionally, a mechanical method of simulant removal was examined. In general, this method returned the leak rate to as-received values.\n\nDeformation Characteristics and Sealing Performance of Metallic O-rings for a Reactor Pressure Vessel\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMingxue Shen\n\n2016-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper provides a reference to determine the seal performance of metallic O-rings for a reactor pressure vessel (RPV. A nonlinear elastic-plastic model of an O-ring was constructed by the finite element method to analyze its intrinsic properties. It is also validated by experiments on scaled samples. The effects of the compression ratio, the geometrical parameters of the O-ring, and the structure parameters of the groove on the flange are discussed in detail. The results showed that the numerical analysis of the O-ring agrees well with the experimental data, the compression ratio has an important role in the distribution and magnitude of contact stress, and a suitable gap between the sidewall and groove can improve the sealing capability of the O-ring. After the optimization of the sealing structure, some key parameters of the O-ring (i.e., compression ratio, cross-section diameter, wall thickness, sidewall gap have been recommended for application in megakilowatt class nuclear power plants. Furthermore, air tightness and thermal cycling tests were performed to verify the rationality of the finite element method and to reliably evaluate the sealing performance of a RPV.\n\nDeformation characteristics and sealing performance of metallic-O-ring for a reactor pressure vessel\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nShen, Ming Xue; Peng, Xudong; Xie, Linjun; Meng, Xiang Kai [Engineering Research Center of Process Equipment and Its Remanufacture, Ministry of Education, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou (China); Li, Xing Gen [Ningbo Tiansheng Sealing Packing Co., Ltd., Ningbo (China)\n\n2016-04-15\n\nThis paper provides a reference to determine the seal performance of metallic O-rings for a reactor pressure vessel (RPV).

Continuous leakage at these levels may require additional precautions under present regulatory policies. The mechanism and the time and particle size dependence for the leakage are not known, but there is some indication leakage is more likely at low temperatures. It is possible leakage is due to movement of the O-ring during temperature or pressure cycling at the beginning or end of a test. The radiotracer method involves less labor and is much less susceptible to contamination than the previous method. Future work will investigate leakage past lubricated O-rings and time dependence of leakage. 1 reference, 1 table\n\nA study of Solar-Enso correlation with southern Brazil tree ring index (1955- 1991)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRigozo, N.; Nordemann, D.; Vieira, L.; Echer, E.\n\nThe effects of solar activity and El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation on tree growth in Southern Brazil were studied by correlation analysis. Trees for this study were native Araucaria (Araucaria Angustifolia)from four locations in Rio Grande do Sul State, in Southern Brazil: Canela (29o18`S, 50o51`W, 790 m asl), Nova Petropolis (29o2`S, 51o10`W, 579 m asl), Sao Francisco de Paula (29o25`S, 50o24`W, 930 m asl) and Sao Martinho da Serra (29o30`S, 53o53`W, 484 m asl). From these four sites, an average tree ring Index for this region was derived, for the period 1955-1991. Linear correlations were made on annual and 10 year running averages of this tree ring Index, of sunspot number Rz and SOI. For annual averages, the correlation coefficients were low, and the multiple regression between tree ring and SOI and Rz indicates that 20% of the variance in tree rings was explained by solar activity and ENSO variability. However, when the 10 year running averages correlations were made, the coefficient correlations were much higher. A clear anticorrelation is observed between SOI and Index (r=-0.81) whereas Rz and Index show a positive correlation (r=0.67). The multiple regression of 10 year running averages indicates that 76% of the variance in tree ring INdex was explained by solar activity and ENSO. These results indicate that the effects of solar activity and ENSO on tree rings are better seen on long timescales.\n\nLong-term evaluation of fluoroelastomer O-rings in UF6\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRussell, R.G.; Otey, M.G.; Dippo, G.L.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nA major component in the gaseous centrifuge enrichment plant (GCEP) was fluoroelastomer O-rings, which were used to seal the uranium hexafluoride (UF 6 ) gas system. A program utilizing accelerated test conditions was used to help identify the best material out of four selected candidates and to predict the service life of these materials at GCEP conditions. The tests included accelerated temperatures, mechanical stress, and UF 6 exposure. Data were evaluated using the Newman--Keuls 1 ranking system to identify the best material and a zero-order reaction rate equation to help predict service life. This presentation includes a description of the test facility, the materials tested, the types of tests, objectives of the study, service life predictions, and conclusions. The O-rings are predicted to last approx. 30 years, and a high-molecular-weight polymer had the best performance ranking\n\nA method for studying post-fledging survival rates using data from ringing recoveries\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nThomson, D.L.; Baillie, S.R.; Peach, W.J.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nWe present a method for studying post-fledging survival rates from data on national ringing recoveries.

Many tree-ring series have been accurately studied and many missing rings have been determined. Material and methods: The trees were dead and the samples analysed were big disks. We measured numerous radii and crossdated the individual tree-ring series, paying particular attention to the existence and location of missing rings. We have distinguished between missing outer rings (MORs) and missing inner rings (MIRs) and analysed the possible causes of both. Main results: We determined an average of 8.8% total missing rings (MRs) for these long-lived trees, with a maximum of 96 MRs in a series of over 500. We have tried to establish a tree-ring chronology on Gran Canaria Island, also having the tree-ring series from Inagua site, but the long individual tree-ring series analysed do not crossdate between them.

Even knowing the difficulties involved in dendrochronological analyses of P. canariensis, we can confirm that it is a long-lived species, which can grow to over 500 years, and some of whose growth changes could be associated with certain historical and ecological events.\n\nMany missing rings in old Canary pines can be related with age, fires and traditional uses\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGÃ©nova, M.; Santana, C.; MartÃ­nez, B.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAim and area of study: In the present paper we estimated the age of four monumental Pinus canariensis of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain) by means of tree-ring analysis.

Pt. 2. Leakage rates from a scratch on O-ring surface and narrow wires adhering to O-ring surface\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAsano, R.; Aritomi, M.; Sudi, A.; Kohketsu, Y.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nA programme for enhancement of fuel burnup has been promoted in Japan as part of the sophisticated programme for light water reactors to reduce the fuel cost and the amount of spent fuel. As part of this fuel programme, a new wet-type transport cask has been developed to transport the high burnup fuels efficiently. The purpose of this work is to clarify the margin of safety in the evaluation of the release rate of radioactive materials from the wet-type transport cask into the environment and to establish a practical evaluation method for leakage rates on leak behaviour of high temperature water from the casks. In this paper, leakage rates of water under high pressures and at high temperatures are investigated from two kinds of leak path model. One is a disc with a scratch on the surface which simulates a defect on the seal surface of the O-ring flange and the other is narrow stainless steel wires installed on the O-ring surface which simulates hair adhering to the O-ring surface. From the results, an evaluation method for the leakage rate of water under high pressure and at high temperature from a non-circular leak path and multiple leak paths is proposed.

We have shown here that in contrast to the dot-rings made of conventional semiconductors, such as InAs or GaAs, the dot-rings in ZnO heterojunctions demonstrate several unique characteristics due to the unusual properties of quantum dots and rings in ZnO. In particular the energy spectra of the ZnO dot-ring and the Aharnov-Bohm oscillations are strongly dependant on the electron number in the dot or in the ring. Therefore even small changes of the confinement potential, sizes of the dot-ring or the magnetic field can drastically change the energy spectra and the behavior of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the system. Due to this interesting phenomena it is possible to effectively control with high accuracy the electron charge and spin distribution inside the dot-ring structure. This controlling can be achieved either by changing the magnetic field or the confinement potentials.\n\nThe plasmasheet H+ and O+ contribution on the storm time ring current\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMouikis, C.; Bingham, S.; Kistler, L. M.; Spence, H. E.; Gkioulidou, M.; Claudepierre, S. G.; Farrugia, C. J.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe source population of the storm time ring current is the night side plasma sheet. We use Van Allen Probes and Cluster observations to determine the contribution of the convecting plasma sheet H+ and O+ particles in the storm time development of the ring current. Using the Volland-Stern model with a dipole magnetic field together with the identification of the observed energy cutoffs in the particle spectra, we specify the pressure contributed by H+ and O+ populations that are on open drift paths vs. the pressure contributed by the trapped populations, for different local times. We find that during the storm main phase most of the ring current pressure in the pre-midnight inner magnetosphere is contributed by particles on open drift paths that cause the development of a strong partial ring current that causes most of the main phase Dst drop. These particles can reach as deep as L~2 and their pressure compares to the local magnetic field pressure as deep as L~3. During the recovery phase, if these particles are not lost at the magnetopause, will become trapped and will contribute to the symmetric ring current.\n\nAnnual tree rings in Piptadenia gonoacantha (Mart. J.F.Macbr. in a restoration experiment in the Atlantic Forest: potential for dendroecological research\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nArno Fritz das Neves Brandes\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available ABSTRACT The tree Piptadenia gonoachantha is widely used in forestry and in forest restoration projects, which require methods for evaluating tree growth. Long-term studies are necessary to determine patterns and detect changes in species growth rhythms. Tree ring analysis provides a precise method for determining age and documenting long-term growth trends in tropical tree species. The present study evaluated the periodicity of tree ring formation and radial growth dynamics of P. gonoachantha from a population of known age in the PoÃ§o das Antas Biological Reserve. Two radii from six trees were sampled using non-destructive methods. Tree rings were counted and measured to estimate age and to calculate diametric increment. All samples had 16 tree rings, which matched the known plantation age and confirmed the annual formation of rings. The individuals sampled had a mean annual diametric increment of 9.5 mm / year. Results showed a trend towards decreasing growth rate with increasing age. Individuals of P. gonoachantha in Ombrophilous Dense Forest produce annual tree rings, which holds potential for future dendroecological studies.\n\nThe Role of Ionospheric O+ in Forming the Storm-time Ring Current\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKistler, L. M.; Mouikis, C.; Menz, A.; Bingham, S.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nDuring storm times, the particle pressure that creates the storm-time ring current in the inner magnetosphere can be dominated by O+. This is surprising, as the immediate source for the ring current is the nightside plasma sheet, and O+ is usually not the dominant species in the plasma sheet. In this talk we examine the many factors that lead to this result. The O+ outflow is enhanced during geomagnetically active times. The transport paths of O+ and H+ are different, such that the O+ that reaches the near-earth plasma sheet is more energetic than H+. The source spectrum in the near-earth plasma sheet can be harder for O+ than for H+, perhaps due to substorm injections, so that the more energetic plasma has a higher O+/H+ ratio. And finally the plasma sheet O+ can be more abundant towards the beginning of the storm, when the convection is largest, so the enhanced O+ is brought the deepest into the inner magnetosphere. We will discuss the interrelationships between these different effects as well as the ways in which O+ itself may influence the system.\n\n400 years of summer climatic conditions in the N Carpathian Mts. (eastern Europe) based on O and C stable isotopes in Pinus Cembra L tree rings\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNagavciuc, Viorica; Popa, Ionel; Kern, ZoltÃ¡n; Persoiu, Aurel\n\n2016-04-01\n\nFor a better understanding of how the climate is changing and how the environment responds to these changes, it is necessary to understand how the climate has varied in the past. Romania's virgin forests have a great potential to obtain long tree-ring chronologies with annual resolution; but so far, only a few studies resulted in quantitative paleoclimatic reconstructions. In this context, the aim of this study is 1) to calibrate the relationship between the stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon in tree rings and the main climatic parameters and determine the potential of Pinus cembra (CÇlimani Mts., N Romania, Eastern Europe) for paleoclimatic reconstructions; 2) to provide the first palaeoclimatic reconstitution in Romania based on the isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon in tree ring cellulose, and 3) to test the hypothesis that nearby sulphur mines have not altered the climatic signal recorded by the stable isotopic composition of tree rings, contrary to the similar signal recorded by TRW. For this study, we have analysed wood samples of Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra L.) from living and dead trees from CÇlimani Mts., NE Romania, aged between 1600 and 2012 AD. The isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon from the cellulose was analysed at the Institute for Geological and Geochemical Research, Budapest, Hungary, using a high-temperature pyrolysis system (Thermo Quest TC-EA) coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Thermo Finningan Delta V) following a ring by ring (i.e., non-pooled) approach. The average level of Î´18O and Î´13C in cellulose for the period 1600-2012 was 28.83â° and -22.63 â°. The tree ring cellulose Î´18O and Î´13C values showed a strong positive correlation with maximum air temperature (r = 0.6 for Î´18O and r = 0.5 for Î´13C), mean temperature (r = 0.6 for Î´18O and r = 0.45 for Î´13C), and sunshine duration (r = 0.69 for Î´18O) and negatively correlated with precipitation amount (r = -0.5 for Î´18O and r = 0.3 for Î´13C) and\n\nStudy of Mn dissolution from LiMn{sub 2}O{sub 4} spinel electrodes using rotating ring-disk collection experiments\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWang, Li-Fang; Ou, Chin-Ching; Striebel, Kathryn A.; Chen, Jenn-Shing\n\n2003-07-01\n\nThe goal of this research was to measure Mn dissolution from a thin porous spinel LiMn{sub 2}O{sub 4} electrode by rotating ring-disk collection experiments. The amount of Mn dissolution from the spinel LiMn{sub 2}O{sub 4} electrode under various conditions was detected by potential step chronoamperometry. The concentration of dissolved Mn was found to increase with increasing cycle numbers and elevated temperature. The dissolved Mn was not dependent on disk rotation speed, which indicated that the Mn dissolution from the disk was under reaction control. The in situ monitoring of Mn dissolution from the spinel was carried out under various conditions. The ring currents exhibited maxima corresponding to the end-of-charge (EOC) and end-of-discharge (EOD), with the largest peak at EOC. The results suggest that the dissolution of Mn from spinel LiMn{sub 2}O{sub 4} occurs during charge/discharge cycling, especially in a charged state (at >4.1 V) and in a discharged state (at <3.1 V). The largest peak at EOC demonstrated that Mn dissolution took place mainly at the top of charge. At elevated temperatures, the ring cathodic currents were larger due to the increase of Mn dissolution rate.\n\nMode structure in an optically pumped D2O far infrared ring laser\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYuan, D.C.; Soumagne, G.; Siegrist, M.R.\n\n1989-07-01\n\nThe mode structures in an optically pumped D 2 O far infrared ring laser and a corresponding linear resonator have been compared.

The ring is set with a violet stone inscribed with Arabic Kufic writing, here interpreted as reading \"il-la-lah\", i.e. \"For/to Allah\". The stone was previously thought to be an amethyst, but the current results show it to be coloured glass. The ring has been cast in a high-grade silver alloy (94.5/5.5 Ag/Cu) and retains the post-casting marks from the filing done to remove flash and mold lines. Thus, the ring has rarely been worn, and likely passed from the silversmith to the woman buried at Birka with few owners in between. The ring may therefore constitute material evidence for direct interactions between Viking Age Scandinavia and the Islamic world. Being the only ring with an Arabic inscription found at a Scandinavian archaeological site, it is a unique object among Swedish Viking Age material. The technical analysis presented here provides a better understanding of the properties and background of this intriguing piece of jewelry.

However, shrinkage and shrinkage cracking are common phenomena in HPC, especially early-age cracking. This study assessed early-age cracking of HPC for two mixtures using restrained ring tests. The two mixtures were produced with water/binder mass ratio (mW/mB of 0.22 and 0.40, respectively. The results show that, with greater steel thickness, the higher degree of restraint resulted in a higher interface pressure and earlier cracking. With steel thickness of 6 mm, 19 mm, and 30 mm, the age of cracking were, respectively, 12 days, 8 days, and 5.4 days with the mW/mB = 0.22 mixture; and 22.5 days, 12.6 days, and 7.1 days with the mW/mB = 0.40 mixture. Cases of the same steel thickness show that the ring specimens with a thicker concrete wall crack later. With the mW/mB = 0.22 mixture, concrete walls with thicknesses of 37.5 mm, 75 mm, and 112.5 mm cracked at 3.4 days, 8.0 days, and 9.8 days, respectively; with the mW/mB = 0.40 mixture, the ages of cracking were 7.1 days, 12.6 days, and 16.0 days, respectively.\n\nSifat fisika dan analisis gugus fungsi karet seal o-ring dari bahan termoplastik elastomer nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR dan polyvinyl chloride (PVC\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nArum Yuniari\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The purpose of this research was to determine the physical properties and functional groups on O-ring rubber seals made of thermoplastic elastomers blend NBR and PVC. Composition of the NBR / PVC were successively varied : 90/10; 85/15; 80/20; 75/25; 70/30 and 65/35 phr. Mixing process between NBR/PVC with additive used a two roll mill within a temperature of 60Âº - 80 ÂºC, the vulcanization process used a hydraulic press at a temperature of 170 oC and pressure of 150 kg/cm2.

D. A.; Barbosa, A. C. M. C.; Granato-Souza, D.; Stahle, D. W.; Torbenson, M.; dos Santos, R. M.; Rodrigues Alves Delfino Barbosa, J. P.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe SÃ£o Francisco River crosses the most drought-prone region of Brazil and regional economic dynamics are dependent on the water availability in the basin. The seasonally dry forests are widely distributed in the basin, where Cedrela fissilis Vell (cedro) are frequently found. This semi-arid region provides a favorable setting where the deciduous cedro trees form well-defined semi-ring porous annual rings that can be exactly crossdated and used to build climate sensitive chronologies. Therefore, we have developed chronologies of cedro from seasonally dry forest fragments of three sites located in the middle-sector of the SÃ£o Francisco River basin and south limit of the Brazilian Drought Polygon. The samples were analyzed according to standard procedures: sample preparation, ring count, crossdating and measurement of the tree rings. Dating quality was tested using the computer program COFECHA and ring-width time series where detrended and standardized to produce the final index chronology using the ARSTAN program. The results show that crossdating within and among trees from different sites demonstrate the potential to expand the spatial sampling. The tree-ring chronologies are sensitive with wet season precipitation totals (October - March), and can explain approximately 40% of the variance (1961-2015). Significant correlation was also observed with total annual discharge of the Rio SÃ£o Francisco River measured at Barra (r=0.48; 1961-2015). However, the correlation disapears after 1993 (r=0.64 for 1961-1993, but r=-0.004 for 1994-2015) and we suspect that the stream gage at Barra has been impacted by human activity. Tree-ring chronologies can provide important information on climate and streamflow variability of SÃ£o Francisco River, where hydrological records are often short and discontinuous. This chronology is now being extended with 150-yr old trees from the region and may be used to reconstruct climate and streamflow records back to the pre\n\nTree-rings and climate: Implications for Great Basin paleoenvironmental studies\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGraybill, D.A.; Rose, M.R.; Nials, F.L.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe Quaternary Sciences Center of the Desert Research Institute is currently conducting a multi-phased study of floral, faunal, and geomorphic response to long- and short-term climate change and extremes in assessing Yucca Mountain's suitability as a high-level nuclear waste repository. Preliminary results of these studies indicate synchronous responses in late Holocene tree-ring, palynology and geomorphic records. A tree-ring chronology for paleoclimatic reconstruction is developed by collection of multiple cores from 20-60 living trees and a similar number of dead trees in a climate-sensitive location. Samples are cross-dated and every growth layer in each specimen is measured to the nearest .001 mm. The measured ring width series potentially contain a variety of climatic, biological, and anthropogenic signals. Each ring width series is subjected to a numerical standarization procedure that removes an age-related biological growth trend, reduces endogeneous and exogenous stand disturbance factors, and maximizes any climatic signal that is present. Each of these empirically defined components can be graphically portrayed and subjected to further analyses. The geophysical signal analysis techniques involved in the standarized protocol are well-documented and established. The final result is a tree-ring chronology that represents regional paleoclimatic variability over the time represented by the sample population\n\nRing and jet-like structures and two-dimensional intermittency in nucleus-nucleus collisions at 200 AGeV/c\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGhosh, M.K.; Haldar, P.K.; Manna, S.K.; Mukhopadhyay, A.; Singh, G.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe have investigated the presence of ring and/or jet-like structures in the angular emission of secondary charged mesons (shower tracks) coming out of 16 O-Ag/Br and 32 S-Ag/Br interactions, each at an incident momentum of 200 AGeV/c. Nuclear photographic emulsion technique has been used to collect the experimental data. The experimental results have been compared with the results simulated by Monte Carlo method. The analysis indicates presence of ring and jet-like structures in the experimental data beyond statistical noise. This kind of jet structure is expected to give rise to a strong two-dimensional (2d) intermittency. The self-affine behaviour of 2d scaled factorial moments (SFM) has therefore been investigated and the strength of 2d intermittency has been determined. For each set of data the 2d results have been compared with the respective one-dimensional (1d) intermittency results.\n\nLubrication of ceramics in ring/cylinder applications\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGaydos, P.A.; Dufrane, K.F.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nIn support of efforts to apply ceramics to advanced heat engines, a study was performed of the wear mechanisms of ceramics at the ring/cylinder interface. A laboratory apparatus was constructed to reproduce most of the conditions of an actual engine but used easily prepared ring and cylinder specimens to facilitate their fabrication. Plasma-sprayed coatings of Cr 2 O 3 and hypersonic flame-sprayed coatings of cobalt-bonded WC performed particularly well as ring coatings. Similar performance was obtained with these coatings operating against SiC, Si 3 N 4 , SiC whisker-reinforced Al 2 O 3 and Cr 2 O 2 coatings. The study demonstrated the critical need for lubrication and evaluated the performance of two available lubricants\n\nEvaluation of radiation-induced degradation of silicon '0' ring\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIkeshima, Yoshiaki; Shiraishi; Tadao; Sato, Ryuichi; Tanaka, Isao; Ichihashi, Yoshinori; Ito, Masayuki.\n\n1990-12-01\n\nCurrently there is too few available data on mechanical properties of an 'O' ring made of organic material, which is used over an extensive period of time under actual Nuclear Reactor environmental conditions. The 'O' rings which were evaluated were made of Silicon Rubber, and are used to provide water tightness. The 'O' rings also served as a pressure boundary within the nozzle of the in-reactor tube in the Water Loop-2 (OWL-2) at the JMTR in Oarai, Ibaraki. The 'O' rings were subjected to a constant penetrating radiation (up to 3.46 kGy) over a period of thirteen (13) years. The effects on the mechanical properties of a Silicon Rubber 'O' Ring were evaluated after having been used over an extensive period of time in an actual in-reactor tube within a radiation environment; a full thirteen years in durations. In making comparison of the properties of other Silicon Rubber 'O' Rings. It was also found that these other 'O' rings were subject to Gamma Rays for a shorter period, but with the same amount of radiation as the 'O' rings in the reactor were supposedly to have received. The evaluation showed that a Silicon Rubber 'O' Ring could have been used for a period, as much as forty (40) years even with a (absorbed) dose of about 300 kGy, before the life expectancy of such an 'O' ring is fully met. It was also discovered that the mechanical properties of an Ethylene Propylene 'O' Rings (currently used in the new OWL-2 in-reactor tube) were much superior to those of the Silicon Rubber 'O' Rings. The Ethylene Propylene 'O' Rings had a live expectancy which was about three times that of a Silicon Rubber 'O' Rings.

[Technische Univ. Muenchen (Germany). Catalysis Research Center\n\n2011-07-01\n\nThe present study analyses a series of Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}-supported iridium catalysts with different pretreatments and addresses the kinetic features and structural requirements of direct ring opening of cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane catalyzed by Ir in absence of acid-catalyzed ring contraction. Mild reaction conditions and high H{sub 2}/hydrocarbon ratios (200-1000) were used to improve accuracy of kinetic measurements and to negate deactivation. Isomerization and dehydrogenation pathways were suppressed to low extents (1-5%) over the weakly acidic catalysts under the reaction conditions applied. Three main observations are shown: 1) initial selectivity to ring opening products (ROPs) increases with iridium dispersion; 2) optimal H{sub 2} pressures differ not only between primary and secondary products, but also among ROPs and fragments; 3) the air-calcination step before catalyst reduction imposes a significant impact on both activity and product distribution.

We propose a possible ligand-mediated ring â cube transformation mechanism during the ligand-coating process of the Co4O4 core due to the stronger binding energies of the MeCN ligands to the 3D distorted cube structure than to the 2D ring and ladder structures; theory indicates that three ligands are sufficient to stabilize the cube structure. Both ring and cube structures are ferromagnetic. Our finding is potentially useful for understanding the catalysis mechanism of Co4O4 species, which have important applications in solar energy conversion and water splitting; these catalysis reactions usually involve frequent addition and subtraction of various ligands and thus possibly involve core rearrangement processes similar to our findings.\n\nThe electrochemical oxidation of lead in various H/sub 2/O-H/sub 2/SO/sub 4/ mixtures-II.

The concentration range extended from 0.06 to 10.3 M H/sub 2/SO/sub 4/. For every concentration it was possible to detect small cathodic ring current variation which was attributable to the reduction of Pb(II) to Pb. Quantitative measurements of the collection efficiency showed that the small cycle life of the lead-acid batter in 5.6 M H/sub 2/SO/sub 4/ cannot be ascribed to the dissolution step.\n\nInvestigations into the construction of the pentasubstituted ring C of Neosurugatoxin â a crystallographic study\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlan M.

Leakage was attributed to the Flow Control Valve (FCV) in Main Engine 3. The FCV determined to be the source of the leak for OV-103 is designated as LV-58. The nitrile/Buna N rubber O-ring seal was removed from LV-58, and failure analysis indicated radial cracks providing leak paths in one quadrant. Cracks were eventually found in 6 of 9 FCV O-rings among the three Shuttle Orbiters, though none were as severe as those for LV-58, OV-103. Testing by EM10 at MSFC on all 9 FCV O- rings included: laser dimensional, Shore A hardness and properties from a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) and an Instron tensile machine. The following test data was obtained on the cracked quadrant of the LV-58, OV-103 O-ring: (1) the estimated compression set was only 9.5%, compared to none for the rest of the O-ring; (2) Shore A hardness for the O.D. was higher by almost 4 durometer points than for the rest of the O-ring; and (3) DMA data showed that the storage/elastic modulus E was almost 25% lower than for the rest of the O-ring. Of the 8 FCV O-rings tested on an Instron, 4 yielded tensile strengths that were below the MIL spec requirement of 1350 psi-a likely influence of rubber cracking. Comparisons were made between values of modulus determined by DNA (elastic) and Instron (Young s). Each nitrile/Buna N O-ring used in the FCV conforms to the MIL-P-25732C specification. A number of such O-rings taken from shelf storage at MSFC and Kennedy Space Center (KSC) were used to generate a reference curve of DMA glass transition temperature (Tg) vs. shelf storage time ranging from 8 to 26 years. A similar reference curve of TGA onset temperature (of rubber weight loss) vs. shelf storage time was also generated. The DMA and TGA data for the used FCV O-rings were compared to the reference\n\nReasons for non-adherence to the dapivirine vaginal ring: results of the MTN-032/ AHA study.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMontgomery, Elizabeth T; Stadler, Jonathan; Naidoo, Sarita; Katz, Ariana; Laborde, Nicole; Garcia, Morgan; Reddy, Krishnaveni; Mansoor, Leila; Etima, Juliane; Zimba, Chifundo; Chitukuta, Miria; Soto-Torres, Lydia\n\n2018-05-11\n\nMETHODS:: Former ASPIRE participants were stratified by age group (18-21; 22-45) and randomly selected at seven sites in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe, 12-17 months after trial exit. Using in-depth interviews or focus group discussions, ring use barriers were explored using structured guides and visual tools including individual-level depictions of dapivirine levels detected in plasma and returned rings. 187 were enrolled; 37% were 18-21 when they began ASPIRE. Most (75%) had drug-level results suggesting inconsistent ring use throughout ASPIRE. Participants viewed themselves as adherent, while simultaneously describing regular instances and reasons for ring removal (e.g. for sex or menses). Less adherent women reported fears that partners would oppose the ring or feel it during sex. High adherers expressed altruistic motivations for ring use. Women of all ages attributed young women's non-adherence to their tendency to be less \"serious\" about the future, HIV prevention and the study; motivated predominantly by benefits; more fearful of fertility-related consequences; and to having less relationship control. When presented with objective adherence data, participants provided reasons for intermittent ring use, while simultaneously portraying themselves as consistent ring users. Further research is needed to understand how women could use the ring in a way that fits into the context of their relationships and their lives while still conferring adequate HIV prophylaxis.\n\nExperimental Study of Shock Generated Compressible Vortex Ring\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDas, Debopam; Arakeri, Jaywant H.; Krothapalli, Anjaneyulu\n\n2000-11-01\n\nFormation of a compressible vortex ring and generation of sound associated with it is studied experimentally. Impulse of a shock wave is used to generate a vortex ring from the open end of a shock-tube. Vortex ring formation process has been studied in details using particle image Velocimetry (PIV). As the shock wave exits the tube it diffracts and expands. A circular vortex sheet forms at the edge and rolls up into a vortex ring. Far field microphone measurement shows that the acoustic pressure consists of a spike due to shock wave followed by a low frequency pressure wave of decaying nature, superimposed with high frequency pressure wave. Acoustic waves consist of waves due to expansion, waves formed in the tube during diaphragm breakage and waves associated with the vortex ring and shear-layer vortices. Unsteady evolution of the vortex ring and shear-layer vortices in the jet behind the ring is studied by measuring the velocity field using PIV. Corresponding vorticity field, circulation around the vortex core and growth rate of the vortex core is calculated from the measured velocity field. The velocity field in a compressible vortex ring differs from that of an incompressible ring due to the contribution from both shock and vortex ring.\n\nUV-laser-based microscopic dissection of tree rings - a novel sampling tool for Î´(13) C and Î´(18) O studies.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchollaen, Karina; Heinrich, Ingo; Helle, Gerhard\n\n2014-02-01\n\nUV-laser-based microscopic systems were utilized to dissect and sample organic tissue for stable isotope measurements from thin wood cross-sections. We tested UV-laser-based microscopic tissue dissection in practice for high-resolution isotopic analyses (Î´(13) C/Î´(18) O) on thin cross-sections from different tree species. The method allows serial isolation of tissue of any shape and from millimetre down to micrometre scales. On-screen pre-defined areas of interest were automatically dissected and collected for mass spectrometric analysis. Three examples of high-resolution isotopic analyses revealed that: in comparison to Î´(13) C of xylem cells, woody ray parenchyma of deciduous trees have the same year-to-year variability, but reveal offsets that are opposite in sign depending on whether wholewood or cellulose is considered; high-resolution tree-ring Î´(18) O profiles of Indonesian teak reflect monsoonal rainfall patterns and are sensitive to rainfall extremes caused by ENSO; and seasonal moisture signals in intra-tree-ring Î´(18) O of white pine are weighted by nonlinear intra-annual growth dynamics. The applications demonstrate that the use of UV-laser-based microscopic dissection allows for sampling plant tissue at ultrahigh resolution and unprecedented precision. This new technique facilitates sampling for stable isotope analysis of anatomical plant traits like combined tree eco-physiological, wood anatomical and dendroclimatological studies.

In the safety analysis report, the release rate of radioactive materials into the environment is evaluated using the correlations specified in the ANSI N14.5, 1987. The purposes of the work are to reveal the underlying problems on the correlations specified in the ANSI N14.5 related to gas leakage rates from a scratch on O-ring surface and from multi-leak paths, to offer a data base to study the evaluation method of the leakage rate and to propose the evaluation method. In this paper, the following insights were obtained and clarified: 1. If a characteristic value of a leak path is defined as D 4 /a ('D' is the diameter and 'a' is the length), a scratch on the O-ring surface can be evaluated as a circular tube. 2. It is proper to use the width of O-ring groove on the flange as the leak path length for elastomer O-rings. 3. Gas leakage rates from multi leak paths of the transportation cask can be evaluated in the same manner as a single leak path if an effective D4/a is introduced.

However, there are a number of observational and experimental situations of interest in which the background gas has a variable composition. In this study, we examine the effect of background gas composition on a cavity ring-down spectrometer that measures Î´18O-H2O and Î´2H-H2O values based on the amplitude of water isotopologue absorption features around 7184 cm-1 (L2120-i, Picarro, Inc.). For background mixtures balanced with N2, the apparent Î´18O values deviate from true values by -0.50 Â± 0.001 â° O2 %-1 and -0.57 Â± 0.001 â° Ar %-1, and apparent Î´2H values deviate from true values by 0.26 Â± 0.004 â° O2 %-1 and 0.42 Â± 0.004 â° Ar %-1. The artifacts are the result of broadening, narrowing, and shifting of both the target absorption lines and strong neighboring lines. While the background-induced isotopic artifacts can largely be corrected with simple empirical or semi-mechanistic models, neither type of model is capable of completely correcting the isotopic artifacts to within the inherent instrument precision. The development of strategies for dynamically detecting and accommodating background variation in N2, O2, and/or Ar would facilitate the application of cavity ring-down spectrometers to a new class of observations and experiments.\n\nCoordination of {Mo142} Ring to La3+ Provides Elliptical {Mo134La10} Ring with a Variety of Coordination Modes\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEri Ishikawa\n\n2009-12-01\n\nFull Text Available A28-electron reduced C2h-Mo-blue 34Çº outer ring diameter circular ring, [Mo142O429H10(H2O49(CH3CO25(C2H5CO2]30- (â¡{Mo142(CH3CO25(C2H5CO2} comprising eight carboxylate-coordinated (with disorder {Mo2} linkers and six defect pockets in two inner rings (four and three for each, respectively, reacts with La3+ in aqueous solutions at pH 3.5 to yield a 28-electron reduced elliptical Ci-Mo-blue ring of formula [Mo134O416H20(H2O46{La(H2O5}4{La(H2O7}4{LaCl2(H2O5}2]10- (â¡{Mo134La10}, isolated as the Na10[Mo134O416H20(H2O46{La(H2O5}4{La(H2O7}4{LaCl2(H2O5}2]Â·144 H2O Na+ salt.

Two different LaO2(H2O7 and one LaO2(H2O2Cl2 TTP geometries (as A-C modes for each of two inner rings result from the coordination of all three defect pockets of the inner ring for {Mo142(CH3CO25(C2H5CO2}, and two LaO4(H2O5 TTP geometries (as D mode result from the displacement of two (acetate/propionate-coordinated binuclear {Mo2} linkers with La3+ in each inner ring. The isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC of the ring modification from circle to ellipsoid, showing the endothermic reaction of [La3+]/[{Mo142(CH3CO25(C2H5CO2}] = 6/1 with DH = 22 kJÃmol-1, DS = 172 JÃK-1Ãmol-1, DG = â28 kJÃmol-1, and K = 9.9 Â´ 104 M-1 at 293 K, leads to the conclusion that the coordination of the defect pockets to La3+ precedes the replacement of the {Mo2} linkers with La3+. 139La- NMR spectrometry of the coordination of {Mo142(CH3CO25(C2H5CO2} ring to La3+ is also discussed.\n\nStudy of improvement in 1st ring`s gas-seal; Top ring no gas seal seino kojo no kento\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAndo, H; Tateishi, Y; Fujimura, K; Hitosugi, H [Nippon Piston Ring Co. Ltd., Tokyo (Japan)\n\n1997-10-01\n\nThe authors studied the effect of an angle of 1st ring twist on the amount of blow-by concerning higher speed/higher output engines for motorcycles. As a result, the authors found the twist made the ring restrained in a ring groove of piston , and confirmed its suitable range for blow-by. By means of the developed optimization method, the authors have achieved significant reduction in blow-by at high engine speed. 1 ref., 9 figs., 2 tabs.\n\nA Microwave Ring-Resonator Sensor for Non-Invasive Assessment of Meat Aging\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMuhammad Taha Jilnai\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The assessment of moisture loss from meat during the aging period is a critical issue for the meat industry. In this article, a non-invasive microwave ring-resonator sensor is presented to evaluate the moisture content, or more precisely water holding capacity (WHC of broiler meat over a four-week period. The developed sensor has shown significant changes in its resonance frequency and return loss due to reduction in WHC in the studied duration. The obtained results are also confirmed by physical measurements. Further, these results are evaluated using the Fricke model, which provides a good fit for electric circuit components in biological tissue. Significant changes were observed in membrane integrity, where the corresponding capacitance decreases 30% in the early aging (0D-7D period. Similarly, the losses associated with intracellular and extracellular fluids exhibit changed up to 42% and 53%, respectively. Ultimately, empirical polynomial models are developed to predict the electrical component values for a better understanding of aging effects. The measured and calculated values are found to be in good agreement.\n\nA Microwave Ring-Resonator Sensor for Non-Invasive Assessment of Meat Aging\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJilani, Muhammad Taha; Wen, Wong Peng; Cheong, Lee Yen; ur Rehman, Muhammad Zaka\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe assessment of moisture loss from meat during the aging period is a critical issue for the meat industry.

N.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAs the Cassini mission comes to its much anticipated end, somewhat befittingly to be immortalized and enshrined for all time within the gaseous confines of a planet named for the Greek god of time (Kronos), we find the time appropriate to return to the subject of ring age and origin. During Cassini's remarkable tenure, important measurements have been obtained that can help to elucidate and perhaps settle the debate once and for all on whether the rings are young or old. At the forefront lie the results of the Cassini Dust Analyzer (CDA) experiment which indicate that the range of the micrometeoroid flux at infinity for Saturn are comparable to the nominal value of the meteoroid flux value currently adopted for use in ballistic transport (BT) applications and models (Estrada et al., 2015, 2017). Moreover, the source of the micrometeoroid flux has been localized to the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt (EKB) and is not cometary in origin as previously assumed (Altobelli et al., 2015). A major consequence of these measurements is that the EKB flux is"
