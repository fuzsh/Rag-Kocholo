        "text": "Enables Easy Migration from Traditional Networks to the Next Generation of \"IP-Intelligent\" Networks for Service Providers\n\nMore information about the Cisco ISR 3303\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. -- March 23, 1999 -- Cisco Systems, Inc. today introduced the Cisco ISR 3303, an access platform with full synchronous optical network/synchronous digital hierarchy (SONET/SDH) interoperability that enables service providers to deliver legacy voice services and provision IP services in a single, integrated solution platform while lowering the cost of ownership.\n\nThe capabilities and reduced costs make the Cisco ISR 3303 the ideal solution for competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), regional bell operating companies (RBOCs) and cable companies. The Cisco ISR 3303 combines elements of the powerful routing features of Cisco IOS. software with the fiber-optic unidirectional path switched ring (UPSR) access capabilities of a SONET/SDH add/drop multiplexer (ADM) in an integrated platform suited for the service provider network edge.\n\n\"This platform enables service providers, such as CLECs, RBOCs and cable companies, to extend their existing TDM relationships with their customers into data relationships,\" said Tom Nolle, president of CIMI Corporation. \"The extension of these pre-existing relationships has a positive effect on the cost structure of delivering new services.\"\n\nUsing components of Cisco IOS software as a foundation, the Cisco ISR 3303 gives service providers the ability to offer new services such as managed Internet access and native LAN services over an existing TDM infrastructure. Service providers can also continue to offer existing services such as leased line and voice transport more cost effectively by deploying the Cisco ISR 3303.\n\nUsing the capabilities of the Cisco ISR 3303, service providers can now target small to medium-sized businesses in multi-tenant building environments, previously viewed as being too costly because of the use of the traditional ADM-based service delivery.\n\nThe unique features of the Cisco ISR 3303 make it the ideal product in the market optimized to provide both TDM and Ethernet interfaces. It is the only access product to support point-to-network applications using wide-band, packet over SONET (POS) as a scalable means of allocating data bandwidth within a SONET network.\n\nPoint-to-network operation allows service providers to use their existing network infrastructure to manage the ISR mapped IP-based services, thereby providing a lower cost of ownership because of lower initial equipment costs and immediate services deployment. The Cisco ISR 3303 takes the place of two existing platforms required for SONET ring access and IP routing.\n\n\"Cisco is using 12 years of Cisco IOS software experience into a SONET/SDH access platform to provide the most data-capable solution available on the market,\" said Alex Mendez, vice president and general manager of the Cisco Multiservice Access Business Unit. \"The introduction of the Cisco ISR 3303 enables service providers to deliver robust New World services that are Web based, network enabled and give customers greater control of their communications experience.\"\n\nDesigned as a network element deployed directly on the service provider SONET network infrastructure, the Cisco ISR 3303 is based on industry standards from ANSI and Bellcore. The Cisco IOS software based processing features fully comply with existing IETF RFCs as well as relevant IEEE standards and provide instant compatibility with existing installed base IP routers. The product features eight DS1 and eight 10Base-T Ethernet ports on a fully redundant platform with no single point of failure, including processor, DS1, Ethernet and fiber interfaces. The ISR's Automatic System Alarming and Performance (ASAP) feature automatically turns on alarm and performance reporting when carriers apply new services, providing the ability for fast and easy system turn-up.\n\nNetwork Management\n\nThe Cisco ISR 3303 is managed by the Cisco VisionWay element management system, a robust client/server-based management platform providing fault, configuration and performance management capabilities. The optional component applications within the Cisco VisionWay Products Suite enable service providers to integrate Cisco VisionWay within their existing legacy TL-1-based or TMN-based (Telecommunications Management Network) OSS (Operations Support System) infrastructure and SONET/SDH network architecture. Cisco's ServiceWay customer service management application for the Cisco ISR 3303 enables service providers to offer service-level agreement monitoring capabilities to their end customers as a \"value-add\" proposition to the delivery of T1 and managed IP services.\n\nCisco Systems gained the technology to engineer the Cisco ISR 3303 through the acquisition of PipeLinks, Inc. Cisco organized the former PipeLinks company into the Multiservice Access Business Unit in the Service Provider Line of Business.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe Cisco ISR 3303 starts at $22,500 and begins shipping in the second quarter of 1999.\n\nCisco Systems\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the worldwide leader in networking for the Internet.\n\nFor more information visit Cisco PR Contacts\n\n# # #"
