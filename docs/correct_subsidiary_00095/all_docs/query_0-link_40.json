        "text": "Data communications giant Cisco Systems provided the technology that built the Internet. Once upon a time, Cisco was a router manufacturer, but in today’s increasingly dynamic and increasingly IP-based communications world, data communications capabilities are no longer the frog but the prince.\n\nAs traditional telephony manufacturers and service providers reach for a piece of the lucrative enterprise cake, Cisco reached up from data transmission and networking to become a true communications superpower, acquiring no small number of companies and technologies along the way as it expanded its business and its focus.\n\nThere has been a lot of talk that Cisco was apparently taking its data expertise and extending into the telecommunications equipment world, moving into markets dominated by giants like Lucent, but, in the past few weeks, that strategy has become above-board. The company has recently launched technologies like Dynamic Packet Transport (DPT), which brings an Internet-oriented approach to hardware and software for telecom carriers and service providers.\n\nSee also: Lucent Isn't Shopping?\n\nCisco has spread its reach from the Internet into the rest of the communications world by acquiring companies: the DPT hardware was part of the package in last year’s $130 million acquisition of PipeLinks. Some of those acquisitions have been in Israel, and today Cisco is one of the most coveted Prince Charmings any start-up Cinderella might dream about.\n\nCisco’s development center in Israel has grown from just a handful of people to well over a hundred in just a few years. The company recently leased new larger quarters in Herzlia, which were designated to bring all its activities together under one roof, and provide room for expansion following the additional acquisitions it plans to make in Israel. That expansion is moving so fast however, that already the communications room isn’t adequate and Cisco employees can foresee a burgeoning parking problem in the new building.\n\nBruce Nelson, the company Chief Science Officer, says that the development center has already come up with the goods for Cisco, regardless of the parking situation at its new offices. The jewel in the crown of the company’s Gigabit Switch Router product family (Internet backbone to us laymen), the STM-16, which provides 2.5 gigabits, is the fruit of blue-and-white development. \"The fastest thing you can get from Cisco was designed here in Israel,\" Nelson says. \"That’s a trend we hope continues.\"\n\nIt doesn’t hurt though, that the culture gap between San Jose and Israel is \"zero\", according to Nelson. \"Israelis have Silicon Valley-style energy. They work very, very hard.\" The Israeli development team suffers the same time zone problems as other foreign development centers (Cisco has one in Australia and one in the UK), but those are mostly overcome with email and voice mail. And a little flexibility. Nelson noted that one night last week he had happened to be awake at 3:00 am California time, so he got onto an international conference call until 4:00 am and went to the office a little later the following morning.\n\nCisco vice-president for business development Mike Volpi, also in Israel this week, explained a little bit of what Cisco is up to here that is making so much noise. Cisco is appointing a permanent business development representative to sit in Israel and look for Israeli start-ups to buyout. The company’s strategy, he stated, is acquisition. No mergers, just acquisition. \"We have reached the conclusion that a takeover facilitates the fastest and smoothest integration of the company into Cisco.\"\n\nAnd considering how happy Nelson is with last year’s $50 million acquisition of local start-up Class Data, the strategy seems to have justified itself. Happy enough to say unequivocally, that although Class Data was Cisco’s first acquisition here, it will be far from the last. Cisco is seeking to buy more Israeli technology companies. \"Israel has a fantastic entrepreneurial attitude. The entire country is supportive of the approach which creates a 5-10 year window of opportunity for great things to happen.\"\n\nNelson did detail for \"Globes\" exactly what his wishlist of technologies is, but he first explained the two routes by which early stage companies could come knocking on Cisco’s door.\n\nThe first, he says, would be a company with an existing product. That company would have to show why that product is good for Cisco. A company that can convince Nelson he needs their product to make the company’s bigger plan work, will be well positioned to set up OEM or license agreements. This, by the way, is where Class Data Systems started with Cisco.\n\nThe other route leading to knocking on Cisco’s door would be for entrepreneurs with a germination stage idea or a prototype. Those entrepreneurs, who do not yet have customers, come business plan in hand (hats optional), seeking investment. The ones who show how their plan dovetails with Cisco’s world view and integrates into Cisco’s future, will go home with the glass slipper.\n\n\"Globes\": OK. That’s \"how\", but now \"what\". I am an Israeli entrepreneur and I want to sell a great technology to Cisco. What technology should I come offering?\n\nNelson: \"I firmly believe that as the Internet comes of age, there will be a need for fraud detection technologies similar to what exists today for calling cards. Those technologies enable telecommunications carriers to rapidly note radical changes in calling behavior, like a huge jump in the habitual number of calls charged or a sudden change from occasional Herzliya-Tel Aviv calls to frequent calls to, say, Brazil. There will be a need for that kind of monitoring for both personal and corporate IP accounts. \"\n\nNelson catalogued the specific technologies that Cisco, during all this active scouting for start-ups in Israel, has in mind. His Internet-oriented hopes to acquire include security products, and cost-effective means of implementing micropayments. But, in keeping with the rapid appropriation of the telecoms market, Nelson also put voice over IP technologies, and the underlying technologies that facilitate call processing and signaling high on the list.\n\nNelson also discussed technologies that Cisco is actively pursuing today, noting wireless technologies at the top of that list. In this field, Cisco has teamed up with one Israeli player, BreezeCom, to provide a complete wireless local loop solution based on voice over IP technology.\n\nNelson noted that the fixed wireless market, the so-called \"last mile\" in homes and businesses, is growing rapidly, as a solution for the complex, expensive problem of creating enough infrastructure to support all the things for which the average home wants and will want bandwidth access. After all, Nelson envisages his technologically-challenged mother using her Internet-connected toaster oven to simultaneously order both movie tickets and a restock for the household bread supply, and to do so with the ease of a computer freak. \"’Wired’ toaster ovens, part of an entire family of Internet-connected appliances that can do almost anything, will require a lot of last mile in every home.\"\n\nAccording to Nelson, Cisco is also looking to increase its presence in creating mobile wireless applications for the service provider market.\n\nThe third direction in which Nelson sees significant wireless expansion is in the enterprise, wireless local area networks. \"Things like phones that are your in-house extension inside the building and when you walk outside they become a GSM cellular phone, or laptops that are ‘plugged in’ to the corporate network anywhere in the building you happen to sit down.\"\n\nOn the wireless front, Nelson said it is still unclear what role Cisco Israel will play in development for the much-talked-about alliance with Motorola for the creation of a wireless Internet. The alliance, he recounts, was conceived and created, only in the highest echelons of both organizations. There was a great deal of concern that the plan would leak to the public before it was completely hatched, so many natural destinations for some of the development didn’t know what was in the works. Those development centers, inside both Cisco and Motorola, are now jockeying for projects stemming from the alliance.\n\nAnother technology that Nelson was willing to discuss was IP telephony, where he says Cisco is \"full steam ahead\". He wouldn’t, however, say even a word specifically about VocalTec, the Israeli company that pioneered the field. The two companies do have a strategic cooperation agreement, but persistent reports of takeover talks between the two have never been confirmed.\n\n\"We believe we can make capital equipment costs for everyone involved in IP telephony ¼-1/8 of what they are today,\" Nelson says, and explains why. \"In terms of bandwidth, voice moves on 8 kbs or even on 64 kbs, meaning that most enterprises today move enough data so that voice can travel in the noise, for free.\"\n\nAccording to Nelson, \"the marginal cost of voice for the enterprise is zero\". Look out telecom carriers, that comment sounds like Cisco breathing down your neck.\n\n\"Globes\" pointed out to Nelson that VocalTec insists its business plan is to grow up to be the first Israeli telecommunications giant, and asked \"Does it have a chance in a world of Ciscos and Lucents?\" Nelson would only say that the world doesn’t consist of medium-sized companies.\n\nDo you have a tip for companies like VocalTec and Check Point who want to be giants?\n\nNelson: The first thing I would say is \"Do you really want to be a giant?\" I mean, isn’t it more fun to stay a reasonable, competitive size so you can remain limber and preserve the family, entrepreneurial atmosphere?\n\nThe tip Nelson would offer though is: \"Make sure your value proposition is always better than your competitors’. Be more limber than your larger, and therefore necessarily slower competitors. Know who your real leading edge customers are and work with them on feature function performance.\"\n\nThe last tip he had up his sleeve though was to watch what your real strengths and weaknesses are. \"The challenge for Israeli companies, in my mind, is not the engineering, it’s the global marketing. And the Internet helps with that.\"\n\nNelson, the man at Cisco in charge of doing just that for his company, doesn’t make do with just being interviewed though. Nelson travels with his ear constantly to the ground and exploits every opportunity to hear perspectives on what concerns IT professionals.\n\nAfter answering every one of Globes’ questions in good humor, patiently backtracking when the scribbling didn’t keep pace with the rapid-fire explanations, he didn’t leave without interrogating the reporter. \"You tell me, what do Israeli IT professionals have on their wishlists? After the Y2K bug, (which either will or will not be the event of the millennium), what does the Israeli technology industry see for the year 2001 and beyond?\" Nothing beats a Prince Charming constantly looking for the best way to serve up the glass slipper."
