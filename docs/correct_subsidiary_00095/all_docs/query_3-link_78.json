Chambers is speaking at a business luncheon in a hotel in Santa Clara, California, not far from the company’s headquarters. He’s dressed in a conservative business suit—his trademark—and, as always, he’s talking fast, but softly, and with a southern courtliness that belies his position as chief executive of an industry-dominating high-tech company. He fixes his audience with his blue eyes, brushes a wispy lock of blond hair from his broad forehead, and you can hear the hills of West Virginia in his voice. He is addressing a business-savvy local crowd, and they don’t hesitate to ask about the implications of his company’s recent reversals of fortune, about the efficacy of Cisco’s vaunted acquisitions strategy and legendary virtual close in the light of those reversals, and about the future of the so-called New Economy, of which Chambers has been such a vocal, center-stage advocate. He answers their questions with characteristic optimism and a disarming forthrightness. He is there to calm worries about the economic downturn that has ravaged his industry, and to manage expectations about his company. He would be doing both of those things, in one way or another, all summer. The tech wreck that had started as an e-commerce shakeout with the bursting of the dot com bubble, and had grown into a full-fledged eco1\n\nIntroduction nomic downturn in 2001 that would eventually touch companies of virtually every size and stripe, had finally found its way to Cisco City. In March 2001, Cisco joined the burgeoning ranks of technology companies announcing layoffs and write-offs and earnings shortfalls. Until that fateful spring, Cisco Systems had been a company that could do no wrong, and John Chambers was Wall Street’s golden boy. From 1995, the year Chambers took over as CEO, to 2000, Cisco’s revenues grew by an average annual rate of 57 percent. In March 2000, Cisco’s market cap reached just over half a trillion dollars, and it was, for a shining moment, the most valuable company on earth. It didn’t matter that it dropped quickly back into third place; everybody was still getting rich. From its initial public offering in 1990 to the spring of 2000, Cisco’s share price grew by more than 94,000 percent, making millionaires of many of its investors, its executives, and even its rank-and-file employees. Cisco continued to fly as high as ever for months after “burst” and “bubble” first began appearing in print and on Lou Dobbs’ teleprompter. But it couldn’t escape the black-hole gravitational pull of the downturn. In March, the company announced its first layoffs; two months later, it announced its first-ever losses. And all of a sudden the book I was writing about John Chambers seemed to be a much more challenging project than I had thought it was going to be when I first took pen in hand a few months earlier. What began as an examination of the man behind the meteoric rise of a high-tech company had evolved rather abruptly, and I found myself writing a very different book. Or so I thought then. Throughout the summer of 2001, I watched as one of the most significant chapters in Chambers’s professional life and in the history of his company unfolded before my eyes. The mettle of the man was tested in ways it had not been in a decade. That summer, virtually every one of the very strategies that had brought Cisco such phenomenal success was called into question. Only a few months earlier, business journalists were fawning over him, analysts were extolling the virtues of his management approach, and he was the investors’ best friend. He was “Mr. 2\n\nIntroduction Internet,” “The Best Boss in America,” and “CEO of the Year” in about half a dozen business magazines. Now, they were taking potshots at him. Some critics were almost gleeful in their denunciation of Chambers’s leadership. “Investors give new meaning to the phrase ‘torture Chambers,’” Fortune quipped. “Cisco or Crisco?” wondered a Business 2.0 headline. In the decade-plus that I’ve been covering Silicon Valley for various computer and high-tech trade magazines, I had seen this kind of kneejerk reaction before. An industry analyst once described the phenomenon to me this way: “The high-tech sector regularly kills its own visionaries; yesterday’s genius is today’s dogmeat.” Cisco was hardly alone on the downward slope. In Silicon Valley, were I live and work, Internet companies were closing down in droves and high-tech operations were handing out pink slips by the bucketful. Hosts of name-brand companies like Hewlett-Packard, Intel, and Sun Microsystems announced layoffs and lowered expectations. Even Cisco’s chief rival in the optical-networking market, Juniper Networks, was cutting its workforce and profit projections. In the summer of 2001, anyone looking to rent a moving van in the Valley would have been hard pressed to find one. And yet Chambers seemed to be taking most of the heat that summer. He had been at Cisco’s helm for one of the fastest and loftiest ascents in high-tech history, and for one of the industry’s steepest and deepest plunges. The company was unique in that regard, and so it was probably inevitable that Chambers would take the lion’s share of the flack. (And he had made such an issue of his desire to avoid those layoffs.) But the truth is, he probably didn’t deserve it. As summer turned into fall, despite the downturn and the braying of the naysayers, Cisco Systems remained one of the most powerful and important organizations in the tech sector. As I write these words, rumors that Cisco might acquire a Sunnyvale, California-based networking firm have caused that company’s stock to rise sharply for the third straight day. Being acquired by Cisco may not be the IPO-like exit strategy today that it was a year ago, but the very idea still sets more than a few hearts a-thumping. 3\n\nIntroduction And John Chambers continues to be one of the most compelling CEOs in America. In Silicon Valley, where you can’t swing a dead cat without hitting a remarkable chief executive, that’s saying something. I first wrote about Cisco back in 1991, when I profiled the company—along with ninety others—for a book called Silicon Valley: Inventing the Future (with Jean Deitz Sexton, Windsor Publications, 1992). The company had gone public a year earlier, “Cisco” was still spelled with a lowercase C, and its colorful founders had only recently moved on to greener pastures. John Chambers joined the company in January of that year, but I wasn’t paying much attention to sales execs. For reasons I never learned, that Cisco profile didn’t make it into the book, but my interest in the company was well and truly piqued. Over the years, I’ve watched the company grow and change, and I’ve watched its CEO emerge as a leading light in high tech. Chambers was and is a chief executive who gets it. He’s not enamored of the technology he sells for its own sake; to him, it’s a tool and a commodity. In an environment in which competing technologies can ignite what amount to religious wars, Chambers’s agnosticism is refreshing. And so is his optimism, which he uses not to hide from unpleasant realities or to pump sunshine for his company’s investors but to push himself to reach beyond his grasp. Even Chambers’s most buoyant statements are surprisingly grounded. During the question-and-answer period that followed the speech mentioned at the beginning of this introduction, I asked Chambers whether he would have done anything differently had he known what he knew then six months earlier. Without missing a beat, he said, “Of course.” And he quickly added, “But that question isn’t really very useful. A better question might be, what did you learn from the experience? We learned that change can occur at a much more rapid magnitude than we ever thought possible, and we will position ourselves better on that in the future. Will we stop taking calculated business risks? Absolutely not!” This book focuses on John Chambers the CEO, but it’s also a chronicle of his life, from his childhood struggles to overcome a learning disability to lessons learned during his professional formative years, and 4\n\nIntroduction finally to his role in the evolution of an industry. It is, I hope, a fair portrait of a hard-working and astonishingly successful executive facing some of the greatest challenges of his career. My research for this project included interviews with current and former employees, contractors, customers, industry analysts, competitors, old friends, and teachers. Many of these people asked not to be identified, and I have respected their requests for anonymity in these pages. Among those who know John Chambers, I found a genuine fondness and deep respect for the man—even among those who were laid off. One former employee told me that Chambers was a “phenomenal human being.” Another said that he was the “coolest guy.” One executive came close to cracking nasty about Chambers when he told me that his “nice-guy image” is a bit of smoke and mirrors. “It’s a cultivated persona,” he said. “The guy isn’t Mr. Rogers.” But even that remark was a left-handed compliment; the ability to play hardball isn’t necessarily a bad quality in a CEO. Others insisted that he is, in fact, very much like the cardigan-wearing PBS kiddie-show host—on steroids maybe, a Type A Mr. Rogers perhaps, but nice. I don’t know if you can call John Chambers the best CEO in America, but he certainly must be included on any list of America’s top chief executives. He’s not as well known to the public as many of his peers, but he is as influential as anyone in business today, and he just may be the quintessential Information Age CEO.\n\n5\n\nCHAPTER\n\n1\n\nA West Virginian Choirboy On November 30, 1994, a small headline appeared on the business page of The Charleston Gazette. It read: “City Native Chosen to Head California Computer Firm.” In the brief article that followed, residents of West Virginia’s capital city learned that 45-year-old John T. Chambers had been named president and CEO of “a California-based Fortune 500 computer firm.” A local boy who had already made good had just made even better. This wasn’t the first time John Chambers’ name had appeared in his hometown newspaper. In 1988, the Gazette’s “Business Briefs” section carried the announcement of Chambers’ promotion to senior vice president at Wang Laboratories, another “Fortune 500 computer company.” It ran just above the announcement that Gardner’s Gentle-Care Drycleaning and Laundry had returned to downtown Charleston with the opening of a new store in the Pritchard Building. By the time the first year of the new millennium had drawn to a close, Chambers was rating banner headlines in the hometown paper. In its New Year’s Eve 2000 edition, the Gazette shouted: “Cisco CEO John Chambers 2000 West Virginian of The Year, State Native Architect Behind One of World’s Largest Firms.” 7\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way Chambers was the city’s best and brightest, a symbol of success, and a product of the area’s values. He wasn’t just a hometown boy who had made good; he was—and is—a local hero.\n\nKanawha City John Thomas Chambers wasn’t much of a headline grabber in the years before he sat down in the CEO’s chair at Cisco Systems. He was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on August 23, 1949, but his family moved to Charleston, West Virginia, soon after his birth. Charleston was a small city—still is, with a population of just over 57,000. It grew up along the banks of the Elk and Great Kanawha rivers, where the two waterways flowed together, not far from the Appalachian Mountains. Chambers and his two younger sisters grew up in Kanawha City (pronounced k’NAH-wuh locally), a flat stretch of developed land and foothills just across the big river from downtown Charleston. Chambers grew up in an educated, solidly middle class household. Both of John’s parents were doctors; one grandfather was a bank president, and the other ran a construction company. A childhood friend once characterized his family life as “all Donna Reed and Leave It to Beaver.”1 John Turner “Jack” Chambers was a prominent obstetrician/gynecologist with an interest in real-estate development and health-care ventures. During his years in medical practice, Jack Chambers delivered about six thousand babies, including all four of West Virginia Senator Jay Rockefeller’s children. He also once ran unsuccessfully for the state senate as a Republican. June Chambers worked as an internist and psychiatrist. She was known as a conscientious mother who brought hot glazed doughnuts home to John and his sisters after school. Chambers has often given credit to his mother—a warm, friendly, and insightful woman— for his people skills. His interest in business came from his father, and perhaps his talent for it, too. Chambers has talked about his father’s ability to 8\n\nA West Virginian Choirboy spot important trends, to see where things were headed. He often tells the story of how, in the 1970s, Jack Chambers foresaw the coming consolidation in health care before most of his colleagues, and how he led the merger of nine small hospitals in Charleston, even through the opposition of their boards. The people in his hometown remember the young John Chambers as a personable, cheerful, and very smart boy. Old friends say that he was focused and hardworking, a team player, and a kid who didn’t believe in taking shortcuts. Teachers remember him as an excellent student, very disciplined and respectful of his elders, and something of a parent pleaser. And he was competitive. Very competitive. “John played a lot of sports, but he was never the star,” Jack Chambers recalled in a 1998 interview. “He liked to organize teams and always expected them to win. He wouldn’t have played if he didn’t.”2 John played in church-league basketball and in Little League, and he participated in the Cub Scouts. Bill Nottingham, owner of the Charleston Bicycle Center in Kanawha City and a childhood friend of Chambers, remembers him as a nice guy but very competitive when it came to sports. “We were always good friends,” he said in an interview, “but on the basketball court he would do anything to beat me.” Jim Buckalew, a former athletic director at the University of Charleston who now works for the U.S. Rowing Association and who roomed with Chambers at West Virginia University, remembers John as a tough competitor who never forgot a defeat. “He did not like to lose,” he said.3 Chambers is still a basketball fan, and he reportedly still keeps in touch with his childhood pals. Nottingham told the Charleston Gazette in 1999 that he received a phone call from his old friend consoling him on the death of his mother. “One of the things in his success—his personal life has changed, but it really hasn’t altered his personality,” Nottingham said.4 Hunting and fishing with his father and his uncle Thomas Chambers, who owned camps on the Elk River, also played an important part in Chambers’s life. John and his friends would visit the camps to hunt, 9\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way fish, search for frogs, and go on “float trips” down the river that would sometimes last for days. In an article he wrote for the New York Times in May 2001, Chambers recounted two near-disaster fishing stories that profoundly influenced him: I got into trouble at 7. I was ﬁshing in fast water where the bass feed. I went too far out on a rock. The current caught me, pulling me into the middle of the rapids. I was a good swimmer but not that good. I looked at Dad. He said, “Hold onto the ﬁshing pole.” I went down the rapids and Dad came and got me. I focused on the pole and felt unconditional trust and conﬁdence. Five years later, in the same river, a metal pipe hit me in the head. Blood gushed. I started running toward the house a half-mile away. Mom didn’t bat an eye. She put her hand on it and said: “It’s a puncture wound; it probably won’t require any stitches. You’re going to be ﬁne.”5\n\nFrom the first incident, he said, he learned the value of trust in others and focusing on the problem at hand; from the second, he learned the effectiveness of remaining calm in a crisis. Chambers has continued to take his fishing seriously. Colleagues told me about the time, while on an executive retreat in Alaska, Chambers was so determined to catch the most fish that he kept one of his vice presidents out in a small boat for hours after a rainstorm had sent everyone else back to the lodge. He would continue to find time every year to take weeklong fishing trips with his father. They would travel to Alaska, Key West, the Yucatán, and the Canadian Arctic. The two have remained especially close, and Chambers has often said that his father is a role model, a confidant, and his best friend. Forty years later, the father-and-son fishing trips include Chambers’s own, now-grown son, John Jr.\n\n10\n\nA West Virginian Choirboy Dyslexia, Doubt, and Determination Both of Chambers’s parents, not surprisingly, put a high priority on education, and even as a young boy, their son tried his best to measure up to their expectations. But by the time John had reached the age of eight, it was clear that something was wrong. He was having trouble learning to read. At the blackboard, the teacher was writing W-A-S, but John was seeing S-A-W. His old friends say that John managed to hide his dyslexia from all but the closest of his friends. A former classmate recalls that his problem was not readily apparent to his peers, and that it didn’t seem to slow him down in school. But, of course, he was struggling, and other accounts hold that John’s young classmates made fun of him. Chambers has said that he considered his dyslexia a weakness, and never talked about it as a youngster. He felt dumb, and he couldn’t understand why he was falling behind in school. And then the teachers began to treat him differently—at least that’s how it seemed to John. In their eyes he saw something he never saw in his parents’ eyes: doubt. It seemed as though they weren’t sure he was going to make it through high school, let alone go on to college. Jack and June Chambers, however, had no doubts about their only son. Maybe, as his father would later recall, “John thought he wasn’t as smart as the other kids,”6 but his mother and father knew better. Whatever the trouble was, they were not going to sit back and watch their son fall behind in school. Lorene Anderson-Walter—then Kitty Anderson—was a reading specialist for state and county schools. She had a national reputation, wrote textbooks, journal articles, and newsletters, and lectured widely. Her private reading clinic attracted a wide range of clients, from struggling students to adult professionals. June Chambers sought her out and brought young John to her for testing. “He was completely failing in reading,” Anderson-Walter told me. “He thought his teacher had said that he would never learn to read. I\n\n11\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way don’t think that was true. The teacher may have said that he would have a hard time. Back then, very few people knew anything about dyslexia. It was almost a disgrace to have it.” Anderson-Walter tested John and confirmed that his problem was dyslexia. She could tell immediately that the boy was “extremely bright.” (Dyslexics often are.) She explained to John’s mother that it would take some time and tutoring, and although it couldn’t be done overnight, she could teach Johnny to read. Anderson-Walter remembers that despite the strong stigma attached to dyslexia, June Chambers was unusually calm as she received the news that her son had a learning disorder. “She was very interested and seemed to understand what I was saying,” Anderson-Walter says, “and she wasn’t panic stricken by the word ‘dyslexia.’ I tried very hard to stay away from that word at that time, because of the stigma. I could not believe that a mother would be so interested in every detail, the way she was. Naturally, I’m for this, so I told her more than she needed to know. I even got out charts to show her. Of course, I didn’t realize that she was a medical doctor.” John would visit Kitty twice a week for two hours for about a year and a half. “I don’t remember ever having a more determined student,” she says. “There was just no doubt in his mind that he was going to learn to read. He came in smiling, and he had these great big eyes. And he was anxious to get to work. He would take any assignment I gave him. Nothing was too small. Some of the things we did back then probably seemed very babyish to him, things like underlining every word. But you’re trying to get them to read left to right, you see. He was perfectly willing to do anything of that sort.” The press has often described Chambers’s learning disability as a “mild form of dyslexia.” Anderson-Walter disagrees with that characterization: “It wasn’t the worst case I’ve every seen, but it wasn’t mild. What made the difference was John himself. He was a very, very bright boy, and so determined. If he hadn’t been, it would have taken much longer.” That John Chambers had to overcome dyslexia as a child is no secret today, but it wasn’t always so widely known. In 1995, Cisco employees would learn about it during a “bring-your-kid-to-work” event, when a 12\n\nA West Virginian Choirboy little girl who was trying to speak to an assembled group couldn’t get her question out and started to cry. “I have a learning disability,” she said, whereupon Cisco’s newly appointed CEO jumped up to comfort her. “So do I,” he told her—and hundreds of his employees. “Take your time.” In his New York Times piece, Chambers wrote about the aftermath of his impulsive revelation: I was a little bit embarrassed. That evening, there were a dozen e-mail messages. One said, “You don’t know what it meant for my child.” Parents and children encouraged me to be more candid with my learning disability, how I overcame it and share with young people not to use a learning disability as an excuse for why we can’t do things in life.7\n\n“The thing I remember most about John Chambers,” says AndersonWalter “was his constant smiling. He had this very optimistic attitude about everything. About his whole life. About everything he did. He was just not going to fail. One thing I notice as I hear him now on TV is that he still has that attitude.” Despite his dyslexia—or perhaps because of it—John would graduate second in his class as Charleston High School’s 1967 salutatorian. He went on to earn three college degrees, but he never learned to like reading, and he avoids it whenever possible. As CEO of Cisco Systems, he instructs his employees to boil reports down to summaries. Famous for a powerful memory that allows him to recall nearly everything he has heard in meetings, he usually gives speeches and presentations without notes. He prefers voice mail to e-mail.\n\nTwo Loves: Elaine and Education In high school, John and his friend Jim Buckalew used to double date. Chambers would drive on Friday night, and Buckalew would drive on 13\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way Saturday night. They usually took their dates to the movies or to the local miniature golf course. “There wasn’t a lot to do back then,” Buckalew said in an interview.8 Dull as the nightlife of 1960s Charleston may have been for the two teenagers, without it Chambers might never have met his future wife. According to Chambers, it was Buckalew’s then-girlfriend who brought the two together. She had already fixed him up with two girls, but no sparks were flying. Out of desperation, she turned to her friend Elaine Prater. “She couldn’t find the girl she was initially after,” Chambers recalled later in an interview, “but found my wife. She told her, ‘Elaine, I need a big favor.’”9 Buckalew remembers events slightly differently: “We were over at Stonewall [Jackson High School] on senior week and Elaine poked her head around the corner. John caught her eye and that was it.” Buckalew then asked his girlfriend to arrange a meeting.10 However they got together, sparks did fly between John and Elaine. He took her to the prom, and they dated off and on for several years. After graduation, John enrolled at Duke University, but after only two years at Duke, he transferred to West Virginia University to be with Elaine, who was there studying to become a speech therapist. (Chambers has often joked that even his wife couldn’t rid him of his West Virginia accent.) Later, while John was studying for his graduate degree at Indiana University, he and Elaine finally tied the knot. Jack Chambers stood beside his son as his best man. After a reception at Edgewood Country Club, John and Elaine went to Las Vegas for their honeymoon. Many years later, Chambers would tell an interviewer that Elaine was the only person, outside his immediate family, whom he had ever told that he loved. “The longer we’re married,” Chambers said, “the closer we get.”11 Although early in life he had expected to follow his parents’ footsteps into medical school, in college John found himself following a different path. As a boy, he had worked in a motel and restaurant that his father owned, and that experience started him thinking about running his own company. He studied business as an undergraduate, detoured 14\n\nA West Virginian Choirboy to take a law degree, but ended up studying business again on the graduate level. When he transferred to WVU, Chambers shared an apartment with another old schoolmate, Joe Rice, now a Charleston dentist. Both were serious students: Rice was pre-med, and Chambers was pre-law. According to Rice, Chambers was a good student who studied hard but played hard, too—and knew how to separate the two. “We were both focusing in on what we wanted to do,” he recalled later in an interview. “He took things as they came, but he also had his ducks in a row. A lot of people didn’t do that.”12 When Chambers played, it was usually in team sports. His favorite sport was basketball, but he also organized other intramural competitions. He never went out for varsity sports, but he played on several campus-wide championship teams. He would eventually play competitive, USTA-level tennis. His team orientation would stay with him as he built his career, and it would form one of the pillars of his management approach. Chambers the CEO would often brag—and for a man so devoted to the team ideal, it was bragging—that he played only doubles in tennis, not singles, and Elaine would be his partner for regular matches. Chambers’s hard work paid off. He graduated from the West Virginia University College of Business and Economics in 1971 and went on to earn a degree from the college of law in 1974. Later, he would receive an M.B.A. from Indiana University. (Chambers’s sisters went on to higher education as well. One became a nurse, the other a teacher— and both of them married CEOs.) Throughout his life, education would continue to be one of Chambers’s passions. His belief in the power of the Internet to carry knowledge and support learning would lie at the center of his vision of a universally interconnected world. In 2000, a group of friends led by his former boss at Cisco, John Morgridge, contributed more than $1.2 million to establish an endowed chair in “Internet Systems” at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business in Chambers’s honor. It is one of only a handful of endowed chairs dedicated exclusively to the study of the Internet and related networking systems. 15\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way John Chambers continues to maintain strong ties to his hometown, where his parents still live, and to his West Virginia roots. The lessons he learned growing up along the banks of the Great Kanawha River about the value of perseverance and teamwork, combined with his native competitiveness and optimism, formed the foundation of the man and the chief executive he would become.\n\nNotes 1.

In his 1998 Fortune profile of the then 49-year-old CEO, he wrote: “He is in overdrive all the time, on a sales call that never ends.”1 That description leaves out a few things—Chambers’s personal charisma, his natural optimism, and his focus on people—all qualities that shade and color the manager and the man. But if you had to describe him in a nutshell, professionally speaking at least, you’d be hard pressed to find a better depiction. Former Federal Communications Commission chairman Reed Hundt, who has known Chambers for years, once called him the “most dynamic technology salesman who ever lived.”2 That works, too. But for simplicity, you can’t beat the Cisco executive who anonymously offered, “John is always selling.” Chambers the CEO is Chambers the salesman. Customers and colleagues alike describe him as a natural pitchman. He began his career in sales, excelled at it, and found in it a road to success. But that hadn’t been his original plan. In fact, until a recruiter from IBM approached him, the thought of taking a sales job had never crossed his mind. It was 1976, and he had just completed his postgraduate studies in business at Indiana University, where he had been president of his class. Now he had an M.B.A. to go with his law degree, and he thought he was meant\n\n17\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way for better things. “I had no intention of becoming a salesman,” he recalled years later. “Why would I waste my education on that?”3 His interest in business had been piqued when, as a boy, he worked at a restaurant and motel his father owned in Charleston. That’s one of the reasons his law-school studies never led to a career at the bar. What he really wanted was to run his own company. Surely he was better suited to marketing or operations. But the IBM recruiter, a branch manager named Chris Christie, was persuasive. He painted an almost romantic picture of the work. It was all about solving problems, he said. Understand the technology, and you understand the company’s inner workings. Solve a manager’s computer problems, and you help his business grow. It wasn’t about peddling technology; it was about selling a dream of streamlined business processes and solutions. Working for IBM, he would be selling computers, and computers were going to change the world. Chambers, who had shown little interest in computing before, was hooked. He found Christie’s picture compelling—and he didn’t mind that the job gave him an opportunity to make big money—so he signed on for what would turn out to be a six-year hitch. In January of 1977, he and Elaine moved to New York, and Chambers put on the famous IBM uniform: dark suit, white shirt, and conservative tie. Despite Chambers’s eventual disillusionment with IBM’s direction in those days, the recruiter’s original pitch stayed with him. Today he tells his own employees that they’re not in the business of selling technology, but of providing solutions. You are, he tells them, selling a dream.\n\nBig Blue In 1977, IBM was the computer company, just as it had been since the 1950s. In those days, bigger was still better, and Big Blue was a big company making the big computer systems called mainframes—the so18\n\nSelling a Dream called “big iron.” (The company’s nickname comes from the pale blue cabinets of its early mainframe systems.) When Chambers joined IBM in 1976, personal computers had not yet arrived on the scene. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had started Apple Computer only a year earlier, but the first Apple machine was still on the drawing board in the Jobs family garage. And Bill Gates and Paul Allen had just founded a little software company called Microsoft. But there were signs that a change was coming. “Personal computers” had been around for a few years in the form of kits and hobby-level machines. The Scelbi (SCientific, ELectronic and BIological) was based on Intel’s 8008 microprocessor chip, which was designed to control traffic lights. It came with 1k of programmable memory and sold for $565. The Mark-8 was a kit computer, also based on the 8008. And the most famous pre-PC era computer, Ed Roberts’s Altaire, had made the cover of Popular Mechanics magazine. In that 1975 issue, it was described as the “World’s First Minicomputer Kit to Rival Commercial Models.” That article generated thousands of orders for the computer kit, which shipped with an 8080 microprocessor, a 256-byte RAM card, and the new Altaire Bus design, all for $400. (Of course, the buyers had to put it all together.) The IBM of nearly three decades ago wasn’t quite so light on its feet as it is today. And it didn’t have to be; the computer industry was nothing like the turbulent mix of enterprise and consumer markets it would become. That IBM sold business computers and typewriters mainly to corporations through a highly structured sales and service system. Consequently, when the new desktop computers emerged as serious business machines in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the company was caught flat-footed. Chambers watched as IBM, hobbled by an old-economy corporate infrastructure and dated technology, was beaten to the punch by the nimble start-ups of the new PC era. “I learned an awful lot about what not to do,” he said in an interview. “You could see management getting further and further from the customer, telling the customer that they knew what he needed better than the customer did.”4 19\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way Big Blue took a stab at the new market for the smaller computers in 1975 with the IBM 5100, but this initial foray was unsuccessful. IBM released the 5100 after two years of development under the code name “Project Mercury.” It was the company’s first portable computer. The desktopsized minicomputer wasn’t as portable as a modern laptop, but it was smaller than its predecessors. It was considered an entry-level system, which should have made it just the thing for the hobbyists who were swarming to the Altaire. But at $10,000 apiece, “entry-level” was something of a misnomer. A few small businesses and some schools bought the 5100s, but its high-price and modest functionality doomed the device. In 1980, IBM met for the first time with representatives from a young software company called Microsoft. Big Blue made a deal to license Microsoft’s DOS operating system for IBM’s new desktop offering, code-named “Acorn.” The company reentered the market in 1981 with the Acorn, now called the IBM PC, for the recently coined “personal computer.” It was the first desktop box officially called a “PC,” and it was the company’s first successful offering in the new market. In fact, the IBM PC became an instant industry standard. The first IBM PC was built with off-the-shelf parts, which opened the market up for clones, a development that nearly buried Apple Computer. It ran on a 4.77-MHz Intel 8088 microprocessor, came equipped with 16 kilobytes of memory, and one or two 160k floppy disk drives. The machines sold for a little over $1,500, and they were sold through third-party distributors (in this case Sears & Roebuck and Computerland. That relationship was a first for IBM.) The company that had dominated the computer industry throughout the 1960s and 1970s was back. But IBM had come late to this party, and the open architecture of its machines left the door open for other PC vendors to bite into its market. IBM is still one of the world’s largest PC manufacturers, as well as a leading provider of software applications and database systems. But other companies, such as Dell, Compaq, and Hewlett-Packard, account for the vast majority of today’s PC sales. During his time at IBM, Chambers worked in sales offices in Indi-\n\n20\n\nSelling a Dream anapolis, Pittsburgh, and Cincinnati. Chambers’s competitiveness and relentless approach to sales served him well at IBM, and he became a stellar performer. He learned how to steer customers away from discussions of the technology and to talk instead about business issues. He liked the work, and he was promoted steadily. But the high-energy salesman found Big Blue’s decidedly structured sales system oppressive. While the competition was zipping around the marketplace, IBM’s slow-moving and cautious culture was rewarding people for, in Chambers’s words, “being status quo.”5 Yahoo cofounder Jerry Yang, another former IBM salesman, once explained the problem this way: “IBM would force the smartest guy on the planet to plod ahead slowly, two years in each job.”6 Chambers’s natural propensity to reach beyond his grasp—to stretch himself with tough goals—seemed to be viewed as a character flaw at IBM. During a performance review, Chambers’s manager observed that he had set ten goals, nine of which he met and one of which he missed utterly. Better to set three goals and meet them all, his boss advised. That’s when Chambers knew that IBM was not the place for him. When Chambers left IBM in 1982, he came away with firsthand knowledge of how bureaucracy and conformity could hinder a company in a rapidly changing marketplace. But he left with more than just disappointment. He had spent six years absorbing the company’s vaunted sales and customer-service philosophy. The IBM sales organization was a proud group, a real force to be reckoned with, and Chambers liked the camaraderie and the competitive environment that continued to thrive, despite IBM’s shortcomings. The experience also left Chambers with a keen understanding of the importance of the customer. In 1997, he told Computer World, “What really [angers me] is when a Cisco employee is arrogant to a customer and says ‘I know better than you what you need.’ That’s what can really get us into trouble.”7 Years later, Chambers would model Cisco’s customer-care philosophy after the one he experienced at IBM.\n\n21\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way Wang In 1983, Chambers left IBM to join Wang Laboratories, the old-line minicomputer powerhouse based in Lowell, Massachusetts. There he found a mentor in the company’s founder, Dr. An Wang. Chambers has described his former boss as the smartest man he ever met, and one of the finest people he ever knew. An Wang was one of the pioneers of the early computer industry. He came to the United States in 1945 from his hometown of Shanghai, China, to study at Harvard University. He had earned his B.S. degree from Chiao Tung University in Shanghai in 1940, and at Harvard he earned a Ph.D. in applied physics. In 1948, Dr. Wang invented magnetic-core memory, which dramatically boosted the capabilities of mainframe computers. It became the most common technology used for storing computer data before the invention of the integrated circuit. Wang’s “Pulse Transfer Controlling Device” would be one of his best-known contributions to the computer industry. IBM bought Wang’s patent for his memory core in 1951 for $500,000. With this money, he launched Wang Laboratories in a Boston loft. Although the company has faded from the high-tech spotlight, overshadowed by the host of hot technology firms and big-brand names that followed, Wang was once one of the most recognized and successful companies in the computer industry. In 1988, Dr. Wang was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, alongside Edison, Pasteur, and Bell. Wang started the company to develop and commercialize specialized electronic devices, many of which were his own inventions. During his lifetime, he would secure more than thirty-five patents for computerrelated technologies. One of his early contracts was for the first electronic scoreboard, which was installed at New York’s Shea Stadium. The company’s first big commercial product was a desktop calculator system, which the company began making and selling in the early 1960s. It was about the size of an electric typewriter, and all it could do 22\n\nSelling a Dream was add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Simple as the machine was by today’s standards, it had great commercial success and fueled the company’s initial growth. By the late 1960s, Wang Labs was beginning to market a supercalculator the size of an electric typewriter. It had roughly the capabilities of a modern programmable pocket calculator and used a small cassette tape recorder to store data and programs. In the 1970s, Wang became one of the world’s leading suppliers of word processors and minicomputers. The newly emerging wordprocessor market was huge, and Wang’s machine led the transformation of the modern office. The Wang Word Processing System sent the company’s sales soaring to $3 billion by 1988. For the first time, typewriters began giving ground to a new device for creating and processing documents. Minicomputers, or “minis” as they were called, fell somewhere between a PC and a mainframe in terms of size and capacity. They were usually stand-alone computer systems with attached terminals and other devices. Minis were precursors of what are today known as servers. Wang sold its minis to small and midsize companies for general business applications and to larger businesses for department-level operations. Wang, along with DEC, was among the top minicomputer makers in the industry. In the late 1980s, Wang moved into the development of an integrated optical storage office-networking system based on the then-new IBM PC standard. By that time, Dr. Wang had developed cancer, and his son, Frederick Wang, took over as company president. When Chambers joined Wang in 1982, the company enjoyed a near-monopoly in the word-processing business, and its minis were threatening the dominance of IBM’s mainframes. He worked at Wang for eight years, first as vice president of the company’s central regional U.S. operations and later as senior vice president of Wang’s Americas/Asia-Pacific operations. During his time at Wang, Chambers performed as he had at IBM, turning in “world-beater” numbers. But the 1980s PC revolution 23\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way caught the company by surprise, and its revenues soon went into a steep decline. The advent of the PC drove the Wang word processor right off the desktop, utterly replacing it in just a few years. At the center of the word-processing systems were the company’s own VS minicomputers and their proprietary operating systems. Although the company continued to sell its minis, it stuck with his own proprietary software, even as cheaper machines running the Unix operating system that had now become an industry standard began to catch on. Chambers watched as Wang’s refusal to let go of its proprietary systems cost the company its competitive edge in the mid-1980s. In 1989, Wang was generating $2 billion in profits; a year later, it would post a $700 million loss. The advent of the PC had made the company’s minicomputers obsolete, leaving it (and every other minicomputer maker) without a product. In the industry, the phenomenon is known as category destruction. As the market for Wang’s products began to dry up in the late 1980s, Chambers was looking for strategies to cope with the radically changing environment. The solution he employed was both simple and practical: He found a partner—a contract manufacturer to build PCs that would carry the Wang label. It was an approach that Chambers would later refine at Cisco, where he would keep his company technologically competitive through a strategy of acquisitions. But Wang wasn’t the only company failing to adapt to changes sweeping the industry. Digital Equipment, Unisys, and Data General, along with IBM, all faced the same unexpected shifts in demand, and they all reorganized in some fashion to develop new products. Chambers was running half the company’s overseas businesses when, late in 1990, Dr. Wang himself asked him to return to the States and take over U.S. operations. Chambers initially thought he would be taking over his new responsibilities sometime in the new year, but his boss had a big job for him that couldn’t wait.\n\n24\n\nSelling a Dream Never Again During the final days of 1990, Wang’s new executive vice president would oversee the layoff of five thousand employees. Chambers spent the holiday weekends planning the layoffs. It was the worst job he’d ever had to do, and the process made him physically ill. Chambers has spoken often of the Wang layoffs. In 1999, during an appearance on ABC’s “20/20,” Chambers talked about the experience with Diane Sawyer: “. . . what happens that tears you up is, often, when the layoffs occur—we like to call it downsizing, but it really is layoffs— it’s during a time when finding another job is very difficult. And so, you look people in the eye and you realize that you’re wrecking their lives and their families . . . it about killed me . . . I couldn’t have done it another year.” Chambers’s father told Sawyer, “He was miserable. He would call home, and we would talk about it, talk to his mother as well as to me, just explaining how difficult that was for him to do.” After the layoffs, Dr. Wang named former General Electric executive Richard W. Miller to top management, effectively pushing his son Frederick out of the company. Miller then succeeded to the chairmanship after An Wang’s death in 1990. By that time, Chambers had had enough. He chocked up his decision to leave to a loss of confidence in the company’s leadership. To be sure, Wang’s future was in serious doubt. The company’s decline would lead to more layoffs, losses totaling $116.3 million two years later, and Chapter 11 bankruptcy. But Wang did emerge from bankruptcy as a provider of services and applications for networks—a very different company, but one that would double in size between 1994 and 1997. The company got a boost in 1995, when Microsoft Corporation agreed to invest $90 million in Wang and to incorporate Wang’s imaging technology into Windows 95. Microsoft planned to incorporate Wang’s office automation and workflow technology into Microsoft Exchange, a rival to Lotus Notes. Wang would eventually realize annual revenues of $1.3 billion. But it was most likely the layoffs that were the last straw for Cham25\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way bers. Firing so many people, and sending them out into what was then a tough job market had been a dreadful experience that undoubtedly soured him irrevocably on the company. Finally, in December 1990, Chambers left Wang with no particular prospects, but vowing never to face such a layoff again.\n\nNotes 1.

Its progenitor, ARPANET, had only recently begun using TCP/IP, the networking protocol that would become the de facto standard for computer communications. And Tim Berners-Lee’s multicolored, multimedia World Wide Web was still years away. But the personal computing revolution was in full swing. IBM had introduced its first PC in 1981. In 1983, the year Time magazine named the microcomputer its “man” of the year, a one-year-old Compaq Computer Corporation made its initial public offering. (Microsoft’s IPO was two years away.) Apple Computer had been ahead of the pack with its first three offerings—Apple I, Apple II, and the Lisa. In 1984, Apple made history with its unveiling of the Macintosh during a one-timeonly broadcast of its famous “1984” commercial, which ran during that year’s Super Bowl. It was the first computer with a mouse and a graph-\n\n27\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way ical user interface, and it sold like hotcakes—50,000 units within 75 days of the announcement, according to the company. But computer networking, was just beginning to emerge as an industry. In 1984, groups of computers, mostly in academic settings, were connected by small, local area networks (LANs). The networks themselves, however, were still relatively isolated from one another—except at Stanford University, just up the road from Apple headquarters, near Palo Alto, California. There two staffers had woven the university’s disparate networks into a single, unified system. Late that year, Sandy Lerner and her husband, Len Bosack, would leave their Stanford jobs to start a company that would utterly dominate an emerging market and pave the way for the Internet boom.\n\nThe Legend (Slightly Amended) The legend of the founding of Cisco Systems is a Silicon Valley classic: Sandra K. Lerner and Leonard Bosack met in graduate school, fell in love, and married. After graduating, they took jobs managing computer networks located at different corners of the sixteen-square-mile Stanford campus. They longed to exchange romantic e-mail, but their networks were incompatible. Sandy supervised the computers at Stanford’s graduate school of business, while Bosack worked five hundred yards away at the computer science lab. Both networks were based on Ethernet technology, originally developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, better known as PARC, and given to Stanford for free. PARC researchers Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs invented Ethernet. (In 1979, Metcalfe founded 3Com, a company that would become one of Cisco’s greatest data-networking rivals.) But Bosack’s network was made up of PCs, whereas Lerner’s department used DEC minicomputers. And the systems spoke different languages. Lerner has described the Stanford computer world in those days as a tower of Babel. To solve their problem, Lerner and Bosack built bridges to connect 28\n\nMeanwhile, Way Out West the networks, and then built devices called routers to manage the flow of bits. Lerner talked about the Stanford project in 1998 with columnist-author Robert X. Cringley for the PBS documentary “Nerds 2.0: A Brief History of the Internet”: “We basically pulled wires through manholes, we pulled wires through sewer pipe. We built a lot of things by ourselves. It was very much a guerrilla action at that point. We certainly didn’t have any official sanctions. In the end, I guess the University is allowed not to like it, but they did get a network out of it.” Their first routers were crude boxes, but these were improved as the network project progressed. A “router” is a piece of hardware and software—a specialized computer, really—designed to manage communications among computer networks. Routers ship information around the networks in packets, which are chunks of data, separately addressed. The routers read the addresses for the packets and transmit them via the most expedient path. Those boxes were the key to the whole thing. If they ever did, Lerner and Bosack no longer claim to have invented the router, and have repeatedly acknowledged the role of others in its development. In particular, Bill Yeager, who was then an engineer at the medical school (and now a senior software architect at Sun Microsystems), seems to have played a pivotal role in the router’s evolution. Tom Rindfleisch, director emeritus of the Lane Medical Library at the Stanford School of Medicine, calls Yeager the principal inventor of the multi-protocol router. In 2000, Rindfleisch published a letter on the Stanford University web site in which he sought to set the record straight about who invented this device. In his letter, Rindfleisch wrote that Yeager was assigned the task of connecting the two networks that Lerner and Bosack managed and that they were helped by Kirk Lougheed, who would later join the couple at the fledgling Cisco. Rindfleisch wrote: By June 1980, a PDP11/05-based router was in place, which connected the medical school and department of computer science. By 1981 Yeager developed a unique network operating system, which would be the basis for the MC68xxx version of the code. This was completed later that year, and was ultimately licensed by Cisco\n\n29\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way Systems . . . Thus, by [the] time Bosack had access to the router source code in 1985, multiple-protocol routers were a relatively mature technology.1\n\nIn other words, Yeager wrote the original version of the software that allowed routers to act as translators among different network media or protocols. Lerner and Bosack did secure a license for that software in 1986 from Stanford University’s Office of Technology Licensing, and Yeager was named in the license as the principal developer/inventor. He reportedly received 85 percent of the royalty distribution, which Rindfleisch claims he pumped back into a Stanford networking project, but none of the credit. He writes: Bosack’s and Lerner’s contributions lay in the important (and risky) realization that this technology could be made into a commercial venture, and credit for that should not be denied. Still, Yeager never beneﬁted from that venture, nor was he given an opportunity to by the organizers of Cisco Systems. Nor has he received public recognition for his major contribution to Cisco’s founding and success.2\n\nRindfleisch took Cringley to task for his telling of the story in the “Nerds” documentary. Cringley (the nom de plume of technology journalist Mark Stephens) published Yeager’s version of events on his Web site (www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit19981210.html). He also published Kirk Lougheed’s comments on the subject, which read, in part: I consider the standard story of Len Bosack and Sandy Lerner developing networking and routing at Stanford as something akin to a sound bite. It sounds good, but hides a lot of complexity. As anyone who has been around Silicon Valley for a while knows, there are a lot of people besides the founders who are critical in the creation of a company. However, in the story-telling business, a complex story is a snoozer, so lots of details—and people—get dropped from the story. Good marketing people and other myth makers under-\n\n30\n\nMeanwhile, Way Out West stand this; Cisco’s early marketing people are largely responsible for the standard Len and Sandy story.\n\nOn the subject of who created its franchise technology, the company Web site explains simply that Cisco was founded in 1984 by a group of computer scientists from Stanford University. Eventually, the network Lerner and Bosack helped to create would connect Stanford’s then five thousand computers. With the network up and running, Lerner and Bosack approached the university about making the router technology available to others. But when Stanford balked at the idea, they decided to pursue it themselves with an independent commercial venture.\n\nSandy and Len Given Stanford’s historical role in fostering technology ventures, it’s surprising that the university showed so little interest in commercializing technology that was developed on its campus. Stanford is the mother beast of many Silicon Valley creatures, and technology transfer is a real watchword at the university. Hewlett-Packard, Varian, Sun Microsystems, and a host of other high-tech brand names grew out of research carried out at, or supported by, the university. In 1938, Fred Terman, Stanford’s first professor of electrical engineering (the first one anywhere), reached into his own pocket to loan William Hewlett and David Packard $538 to develop their first device, an audio oscillator, which they put together in a Palo Alto garage. (That garage has become such an icon that Hewlett-Packard paid $1.7 million for it in 2000. The current CEO, Carly Fiorina, used it as a backdrop for a series of television ads. The owners threw in the house for free as part of the bargain.) Sun Microsystems was founded in 1982 by Stanford students Vinod Khosla, Andy Bechtolsheim, and Scott McNealy, along with Berkeley professor Bill Joy. The company’s name is an acronym for Stanford University Network, the campus-wide wide area network (WAN) on which 31\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way Lerner, Bosack, Yeager, and others worked. Much later, Bechtolsheim would join Cisco Systems. And it’s not as though Lerner and Bosack weren’t members of the home team. They both earned graduate degrees from Stanford in 1981. Lerner received a master’s in statistics; Bosack earned a master’s in computer science. In 1997, Lerner recalled in an interview how she met Bosack at the Stanford computer lab when they were still students: “Nerd culture at Stanford was pretty extreme. There was no way I could have taken one of these people home to meet my family. But Len’s clothes were clean, he bathed, and he knew how to use silverware. That was enough. I was enchanted.”3 For Bosack, it was Lerner’s intelligence and sense of humor. She was bright and quick, and he was smitten. The couple married in 1980. Lerner’s recollections notwithstanding, Bosack wasn’t the only geek in the family. According to one story, the couple talked in a kind of shorthand “nerdese.” Lerner would say “Control-D!” when she wanted Bosack to shut up. (“Control-D” is a computer keyboard delete command.) In their new enterprise, Bosack would be the technical guy—Lerner’s Woz; she was the Jobs of the duo: intense, ambitious, and driven. After a frustrating name search, the couple decided to call their new company “cisco,” after nearby San Francisco. Originally, the initial “C” was lowercase; it was capitalized beginning in 1995 because so many newspaper and magazine reporters and editors complained about it. Lerner created the company’s now-famous logo to resemble the Golden Gate Bridge. (The rise to prominence of another company with a similar sounding name, Houston-based SYSCO Corporation, which delivers meals to hotels, schools, and hospitals, prompted John Chambers to joke during a 1999 speech to a group of Charleston business leaders, “My mother still thinks I’m working for the food service industry.”)4 At first, Lerner and Bosack set up shop in the house they shared with Bosack’s parents in suburban Atherton, California, just up the road from Stanford. They bought a used mainframe and set it up in the 32\n\nMeanwhile, Way Out West garage. One bedroom served as the lab, another bedroom was turned into office space, and they used the living room to build and test. They hired friends, maxed out their credit cards, and took their initial orders over the nascent Internet. Cisco Systems shipped its first products in March 1986. Initially, its customers were other universities and research centers—people who had heard about the routers via ARPANET, on the pre-Internet geek grapevine. There was no money for advertising, and there was no sales staff, so the young company developed its customer base strictly by word of mouth. Throughout its first decade of operation, small “c” Cisco grew at an average rate of more than 200 percent annually. Until 1992, the company never paid a dime for advertising. They didn’t need to. Although they were taking in about $250,000 a month, and the company was actually making a profit, Lerner and Bosack were desperately short of cash. Lerner went back to work for a while as a corporate data-processing manager to bring in some money, and the couple began approaching venture capitalists.\n\nSilicon Valentine Silicon Valley’s Sandhill Road area is home base to most of the world’s venture capitalists, literally, and for many years most of the world’s venture money was invested within a few miles of that Menlo Park, California, neighborhood. But in 1986, venture funds weren’t as abundant as they would become in the 1990s, when all you needed to secure funding was a “.com” after your name. Lerner and Bosack were turned down repeatedly. Donald Valentine at Sequoia Capital was the 77th moneyman they approached. Why so many venture capitalists (VCs) had turned the company down might have had something to do with their perceptions of the eccentric founders. In a 1995 Fortune interview, Don Valentine said that he and his partners at Sequoia invested in Cisco in spite of some real reservations. “Ninety-nine percent of venture capitalists think of them33\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way selves as investing in great people,” he said. “In this case, we looked right past Len and Sandy, and concentrated instead on the great potential market that existed for their product. . . . They were good scientists, and did a lot to set the tone for the company, but they had never managed a thing.”5 Lerner has admitted that she and Bosack started the company without much of a business plan, but with a sweeping technical vision. Even so, the young company was a going concern. At the time Valentine invested, Cisco was pulling in around a quarter of a million dollars every month. Len and Sandy’s ragtag team had built that business without a professional sales staff or traditional marketing campaign. Cisco had both a solid product and real revenues. It conducted nearly $1.5 million worth of business in 1987 and turned an actual profit of $83,000. The company had begun to expand its customer base to include lucrative corporate clients like Philips Electronics. Lerner has said that the money and management expertise Sequoia provided her company were much needed and welcome, but she and Valentine clashed from the beginning. “Don’s first words to me were, ‘I hear you’re everything that’s wrong with Cisco,’” Lerner told Robert Cringley. She reportedly shot back that she was the reason there was a Cisco. But Valentine was a big-time VC with a remarkable Silicon Valley pedigree. He was one of the founders of National Semiconductor, and had served as a senior sales and marketing executive at legendary Fairchild Semiconductor. In 1972, he founded Sequoia Capital, and he was one of the original investors in Apple, Atari, LSI Logic, Oracle, and 3Com. And he did want to invest in Cisco—he saw enormous potential in computer networking—but he wouldn’t do it without some big concessions from the founders. They would have to give up control of the company and let Valentine handpick and hire a professional management team, what Valley VCs jokingly call “adult supervision.” In exchange for Valentine’s $2.5 million investment—the only infusion of venture capital the company would ever need—Sequoia Cap34\n\nMeanwhile, Way Out West ital would receive close to one-third of the company’s stock, and Valentine would become the chairman. Lerner and Bosack retained 35 percent of the stock, but their control of the company was greatly diminished. Among the concessions made was to give Valentine the authority to recruit management and to develop the company’s management process. The key draft pick for Cisco came in 1988, when Valentine hired John P. Morgridge to serve as Cisco’s first CEO. The 55-year-old Stanford graduate was then president of Grid Systems, a struggling laptop maker. But Morgridge was looking for other opportunities, and a headhunter put him in touch with Valentine. Lerner didn’t meet Morgridge until after he’d already been hired. Whatever their initial exchanges, everyone could see that tensions between Lerner and the new boss were high from the beginning of their association. And things would only get worse. Morgridge later recalled that Lerner and Bosack “were basically selling to their peer group, through word of mouth. The initial customer set started with the lunatic fringe—the kind of people who are way out on the leading edge. The early people were very technical and tolerant. There’s been a big shift in who uses the product.”6 Under Morgridge, Bosack became CTO, and Lerner’s new job was running Cisco’s customer-service group, which she called “customer advocacy.” (It was a name that would stick with the organization.) But she chafed under the new regime. A former employee recalls that she and Morgridge quarreled constantly, and that Lerner often stormed ranting and raving into the offices of the new executive team members. Until Valentine hired Morgridge, the Cisco staff had been made up of Lerner and Bosack’s family and friends. Valentine brought in real professional management, and the new, buttoned-down environment was tense. “I think I was very frustrated but [Len] was kind of quieter about it,” Lerner said in a 1997 interview. “The venture people were into building a bigger business and we were into building the best networking computer that you could build. They’re not the same.”7 Valentine, Morgridge, and the executives they hired were, indeed, out to build a bigger company—that’s bigger with a “B,” as in billions. 35\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way Cisco had a real jump on the burgeoning computer-networking market, and routers were a hot item in the late 1980s. The new management team took full advantage of their lead. Sales of the company’s products grew from $1.5 million in 1987 to $28 million in 1989. On February 16, 1990, the company went public. The price of Cisco’s IPO stock was $18.00 a share. The IPO made Lerner and her husband rich, but they weren’t happy in the new organization. Lerner was particularly miserable. As the company grew, Valentine added management, leaving her further and further out of the loop. She has said that she found herself screaming about a lot of things during that period. It seemed to be the only way anyone would listen. “I’m guilty,” she said in a 1995 interview “of standing in someone’s office and not taking no for an answer when a customer needed something done.”8 Terry Eger, Cisco’s first head of sales, has said that Lerner became very difficult to deal with. Later that summer, when she allegedly yelled at one of the company’s big customers, Eger and the other execs made up their minds to address the situation. A group of seven of the company’s new vice presidents met with Valentine. With Morgridge’s knowledge, they gave the chairman an ultimatum: Either Lerner goes or we do. On August 28, Lerner was asked to leave the company. Morgridge and Valentine reportedly tried keeping Bosack, but he left after hearing the news of his wife’s ouster. The couple sold their two-thirds stake in Cisco almost immediately and walked away with $170 million, leaving billions on the table. Neither has publicly expressed any regret over their decision, and Lerner has said that she didn’t want her money tied up with people she didn’t like. Years later, Morgridge, in characteristically blunt language, would offer this perspective on events: “This was a cottage industry that was populated by friends of the founders. And while many were enthusiastic, most had no particular competency in the area they were working in, including the founders. So, in those early days it was kind of like joining a family. And families are not always open and receptive.”9 36\n\nMeanwhile, Way Out West Life after Cisco Lerner and Bosack left the company with millions, but the business had taken a toll on their marriage, and they soon split up. Lerner blames years of overwork, financial struggles, and making the company a priority instead of the marriage. Although they are divorced, by all accounts the parting was amicable, and they remain friends. In fact, together they used a reported 70 percent of their money to establish the Bosack/Kruger Foundation, a charitable foundation. (“Kruger” is the “K” in Sandra K. Lerner.) Through this foundation, they financed a wide range of animal welfare and science projects. Both Harvard and Stanford have received funds from the foundation, as have the Center for Wildlife Conservation and the SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) Project. It also paid for a 125-year lease on the four-hundred year-old Chawton House, the Hampshire, England, manor just up the road from the cottage where Jane Austen lived and wrote during the last eight years of her life. Lerner’s plan was to turn the dilapidated fiftyroom manse into the Chawton House Library by 2003. When completed, the nonresidential study center will house Lerner’s collection of over six thousand early English novels by women. In 1991, Bosack founded XKL Systems, a privately funded communications-engineering company based in Seattle, Washington. Not much information is available about the company as of this writing, but according to its very sketchy Web site (www.xkl.com) “XKL explores and develops new approaches and architectures for the communications industry.” Lerner’s post-Cisco history is a bit more colorful. In January 1996, she launched Urban Decay, a Mountain View, California-based alternative cosmetics business. With the tag line “Does Pink Make You Puke?,” the company offered shades of lipstick and nail enamels in unorthodox colors with names like Pigeon, Asphyxia, Toxin, Gangrene, Mildew, and Bruise. The company counts among its customers pro basketball player Dennis Rodman and actress Drew Barrymore. Urban Decay products have found their way into Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, and, 37\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way in London, Harvey Nichols. Lerner later sold her stake in the company. She also bought Ayrshire Farms, a nearly eight-hundred-acre spread in Loudoun County, Virginia, and stocked it with animals. That farm is the site where she famously posed for a photographer from Forbes magazine, nude, astride her favorite horse. Years later, there seemed to be no lingering hard feelings at Cisco toward the unique couple who started it all. In 1994, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the company, Cisco endowed the Leonard Bosack and Sandy K. Lerner Professorship at Stanford University. Named, according to Stanford’s publicity office, to honor the company’s two founders, it supports faculty members working at the forefront of information systems technology in computer science, electrical engineering, or a related field.\n\nNotes 1.

He spent his first unemployed month sending out résumés that generated no interviews. Undaunted and with characteristic optimism, he reached out to old friends and came up with nearly two-dozen leads. Among those he contacted was a former colleague from Wang, Terry Eger, who was Cisco’s first head of sales. Eger’s description of the small networking company out in California hooked Chambers. Even though Cisco had only $70 million in sales and was minuscule compared to IBM, Chambers was excited about the opportunity. John Morgridge had been running the company for a couple of years when he and Don Valentine interviewed Chambers for a senior sales position. Lerner and Bosack had moved on, and the company had gone public the year before. Although Morgridge had made no announcements, the 57-year-old chief executive was looking ahead to the time when he would step down from the day-to-day operations of the company. He hired Chambers with the understanding that he would eventually be running things.\n\n39\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way Nerdvana Chambers had been to some exotic places since he had left West Virginia fifteen years earlier—New York, Boston, the Far East—but he’d never been anywhere quite like Silicon Valley. Physically, it was a ten-milewide stretch of land bordered on its southeastern edge by San Francisco Bay and sheltered on its northwestern side from the Pacific Ocean by the Santa Cruz Mountains. The climate was moderate, often described as Mediterranean, and the sun shone much of the year. In her book Silicon Valley: Inventing the Future, Jean Deitz Sexton wrote that trying to describe Silicon Valley “is like trying to get your arms around an elephant as it’s jogging down the road. The Valley is physically immense, ethnically diverse, and in constant flux, driven ever forward by the force of technology. . .”1 Intellectually—and, one might say, spiritually—it was Nerdvana, Geektopia, The Valley of the Propeller Heads, home to more Ph.D.s per square mile than anywhere else on earth. It was the very epicenter of the global high-tech tsunami, where the personal computer had been born in a garage and nerds were treated like rock stars. It was also Type-Aville, where eighty- to one-hundred-hour workweeks were common, and programmers kept sleeping bags tucked into their cubicles for quick naps between all-nighters. But it was no company town (towns, actually). You could scratch virtually any code jockey, marketing rep, or first-year M.B.A. candidate and expose a nascent entrepreneur. Local high-tech enterprises commanded the lion’s share of all venture capital dollars. In fact, if you weren’t starting up your own company, helping someone else start up his or her own company, or at least thinking about starting up a company, people began to worry that you weren’t getting enough protein in your diet. Dressed in what would become his trademark dark suit, white shirt, and muted tie, Chambers fairly glowed with the aura of IBM. In the entrepreneurial meritocracy of Silicon Valley, established old-line technology companies like IBM had been the enemy, your father’s company, a\n\n40\n\nHeir Apparent place where individuality was squashed and conformity ruled. All of that had been discredited in the land of T-shirt millionaires. The perception of success had changed. Some people in Silicon Valley went to work without shoes, never mind a necktie. Worse, Chambers was a salesguy. The superstars of Silicon Valley were engineers and programmers. They were out in the garage inventing things. Cisco itself still harbored a core of Stanford supergeeks who weren’t impressed by Chambers’s M.B.A. or J.D. degrees. For them, salespeople were a necessary evil.\n\nScrooge Of course, the company’s CEO was a former salesman himself. Morgridge shared none of the prejudices of the tech-centered. He once said, “Salesmen usually end up being president of the company, so if you want to be president, it’s not a bad place to start.”2 There were other striking parallels between his and Chambers’s lives. Both men had grown up in the suburbs, although during very different times. Morgridge spent his childhood in Wisconsin during the Thirties and Forties, in a southeastern suburb of Milwaukee called Wauwatosa, a child of the depression (which may account for his celebrated thriftiness). Both men had earned M.B.A.s and married their high-school sweethearts. Morgridge met his future wife, Tashia Frankfurth, while they were students together at Wauwatosa’s East High School. Like Chambers and Elaine, Morgridge and Tashia attended college together. After graduation, they moved to Madison to attend the University of Wisconsin. They both graduated in the spring of 1955 and were married later that summer. Elaine Chambers became a speech pathologist and Tashia Morgridge a special-education teacher after earning her master’s degree. After college, Morgridge spent three years in the air force. While he was in the service, an IBM salesman sold him on the idea of a career in\n\n41\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way the computer business (the same thing that had happened to Chambers nearly twenty years later). After being discharged from the military, Morgridge—like Chambers—took a job as a sales rep. Until 1980, Morgridge worked for Honeywell Information Systems; he then joined Stratus Computers as the company’s marketing vice president. In 1986, he was hired as president of Grid Systems, a job he has described as dreadful. “Companies have personalities,” Morgridge said in a 1996 interview. “Have you ever met someone for whom, no matter how they live, life is always trouble? That was Grid. Every day I’d come home and my wife would say, ‘What happened today?’ And something had always happened. A supplier crapped out. The government put a 100 percent duty on flat plasma screens. It was endless.”3 By the time Tandy Computer purchased Grid in 1988, Morgridge was ready to move on. In personal presentation, Morgridge and Chambers were worlds apart. Both wore traditional business suits (unlike so many of Silicon Valley’s “T-shirt millionaires”), but Chambers affected the IBM uniform. He was—and is—very polished. Morgridge has been compared to television’s Columbo, and accused of buying his suits at a box discount warehouse. It’s well known that Chambers takes lots of time to prepare for press interviews and analyst presentations. He never shows up without a thick binder and hours of preparation. Morgridge was known for his off-the-cuff frankness, which included a penchant for the occasional profane utterance. “If you don’t want to hear the answer,” Chambers once said of Morgridge, “don’t ask the question.”4 And, of course, there’s the legendary Morgridge frugality, and the story about Chambers’s first experience with this aspect of his new boss’s personality: Soon after he began working at Cisco, Chambers turned in his first expense report. The report came back, the story goes, with the short-term parking expenses circled and a coupon for longterm parking stapled to it. Morgridge had written his name on the coupon. This oft-told story notwithstanding, Chambers has often disputed Morgridge’s frugal image, describing him as an exceptionally kind and generous person.\n\n42\n\nHeir Apparent Don Valentine, another Silicon Valley executive famous for his thrift, has declared that Morgridge is the only president he has ever backed who is cheaper than he is. “And I am very cheap,” Valentine said. “One of the things I was warned about when we were doing reference checks [on John] a long time ago was that when you have dinner with him, don’t let him choose the wine. I’ve always carefully heeded that advice.”5 But Morgridge is proud of his reputation. He’s the one who laid the foundation of Cisco’s cost-conscious culture. From early on, the company was known and admired for its prudent spending practices. Everyone knows that Cisco executives don’t fly first class, and that includes the CEO. And Cisco City (as the company headquarters in San Jose are known) is spare and utilitarian. Everyone works in twelve-by-twelve offices. Again, even the CEO. Morgridge believes a company’s values radiate from the top. Throughout his tenure at Cisco, he regularly topped those lists of the lowest-paid CEOs. “You can’t have double standards,” he said in a 1996 interview. “Someone flies first class, no one else does; he gets a suite, no one else does. You can run the company that way, but don’t expect employees to be excited about it. Particularly now, because companies are so much flatter. The positive impact of the electronic world is that you can create a worldwide culture; the negative is, when we tried to make do with 24 flavors of pop, it lasted one week, and there was all this e-mail about second-class citizenship and ‘how come we can’t have Snapple?’ There’s very little that’s not known.”6 Morgridge was referring to what he has called the “soda pop issue.” According to a former Cisco employee, the founders provided their people with free beverages. After they left the company, Morgridge tried to scale back that little perk by reducing the selection of free drinks. The employees went ballistic. According to Morgridge, “It shut the place down.” The lesson for Morgridge: Never let your employees get used to any perk you might want to take away someday. His tight spending policies notwithstanding, Morgridge was no Scrooge. Under his auspices, Cisco earned a reputation for philanthropy that continues to rival its high-tech peers today.\n\n43\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way Succession Three years after starting at Cisco as the company’s senior vice president of U.S. operations, John Chambers was promoted to executive vice president with responsibility for research and development, manufacturing, worldwide sales, marketing, and support. He was now, for all intents and purposes, the number-two man, and would be working closely with Morgridge and the senior management team. When Computerworld’s Paul Gillin asked Morgridge about his retirement plans in a 1994 interview, the 61-year-old chief executive was uncharacteristically evasive. When Gillin asked him how much longer he intended to stay on as CEO of Cisco, Morgridge replied, “It’s not my intent to stay that long. Ten years is too long to be with one company these days. One of the great things about Silicon Valley is that we’re not a single culture. We’re a collection of cultures. Chaos and change is very important to the lifeblood of the company.”7 When asked directly whether he had chosen a successor, Morgridge said, “We’ve recently made some moves to broaden Chambers’ responsibility. That should tell you something.”8 He told another reporter who asked about his retirement plans, “I do have retirement plans, my wife has plans, and they don’t always agree.” When asked directly whether he had chosen a successor, Morgridge said, “We’ve recently made some moves to broaden Chambers’s responsibility. That should tell you something.”9 But the CEO’s plans were really no secret. In July of 1994, just a few weeks before the company closed its books for the fiscal year, Cisco Systems held its first-ever analysts’ meeting. Although Chambers was still the number-two man, he dominated that meeting. It was clear to everyone in attendance that he was Morgridge’s heir apparent and was probably making most of the day-to-day decisions. In 1993, Morgridge had surprised Cisco’s board with the announcement of his intention to retire in two years. The board tried to convince him to stay. At the time, Don Valentine commented that Morgridge was the best president in the business, and he was committed to doing whatever it took to keep him on. 44\n\nHeir Apparent But Morgridge had made up his mind and recommended Chambers as his replacement. Although some on the board worried about Chambers’s sales background, most liked his self-effacing personal style and his deference to Morgridge. He seemed to be very comfortable with Morgridge’s basic business plan. Here was an executive who wasn’t going to fix something that wasn’t broken; he wasn’t going to change things just for the sake of changing them. And after all, hadn’t Morgridge come from a sales background himself? Chambers was named CEO in January 1995. By then, the message was unequivocal: John Chambers was brought into Cisco with the expectation that he would eventually run the company. In a press release issued at the time, Morgridge said, “Over the past four years his responsibilities have been steadily increased and during the last eighteen months John has been pivotal in the execution of Cisco’s decentralization plan and acquisition strategy, key components for the company’s overall long-term growth, and acquisition strategy.” John Morgridge once described his company’s business as tying all the horsepower in the computing business together. Under his management, Cisco had become the largest and most profitable computernetworking company in the world. During his tenure, he took the company public and grew the operation from $5 million in sales to over $1 billion and from 34 employees to over 2,260. When he handed the reigns to Chambers, the company was on a stellar trajectory, and he was confident that Chambers would take the company to the next stage in its development. After stepping down, Morgridge stayed on as chairman of the board. Don Valentine, who had served as chairman since 1988, became vice chairman. Chambers had been strongly influenced by Morgridge, and he would leave much of what the former chief executive had put together at Cisco in place. But it wouldn’t be long before the transplanted West Virginian would begin leaving his own mark on the company. In early 1996, using Hewlett-Packard as a model, Chambers divided Cisco’s 150 products and 4,400 employees into six teams. And, following in the footsteps of another CEO he admired, General Electric’s Jack Welch, he 45\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way established what would prove to be a fundamental tenet of his leadership: From now on, Cisco would not seek to compete in a market unless Chambers and his team believed that they could capture the number-one or number-two spot.\n\nNotes 1.

The same thing might be said about many segments of the high-tech sector, but in networking things have always been especially lively. Unlike other powerhouse technology companies, such as Microsoft and Intel, which enjoyed nearmonopoly status virtually from birth, Cisco Systems has operated in an environment rife with serious competitors. The company may have gotten the drop on the competition with its early commercialization of the router, but as the demands of network traffic increased, the market for network equipment and software would prove to be a rapidly evolving space. Start-ups with hot technologies and a handful of big players would keep Cisco on its toes. This was an environment in which the highly competitive John Chambers would thrive.\n\nPC-iﬁcation In the early days of computing, the desktop unit was a “dumb” terminal, connected to a centrally located mainframe, where shared applications and data resided. But the arrival of the personal computer in the early 1980s brought with it a decided shift in the computing landscape. 47\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way PCs and the more powerful desktop machines, called workstations, were slipping through the backdoor of the enterprise, eroding the old model of large, shared computing systems. The new stand-alone machines offered performance and cost benefits that sophisticated power users working in corporate information technology (IT) departments simply could not ignore. For them, at least in the beginning, these new PCs offered unmatched individual productivity. But decentralized computing—or what Bay Networks’ CEO, David House, once described as the PC-ification of the networking industry—had its downside. Stand-alone machines might improve an individual’s productivity, but work-group productivity often suffered. PC and workstation users couldn’t share files or printers, and they were cut off from the traditional corporate computing environment, since, although PCs may have been taking over, the old systems didn’t just go away. It quickly became clear that, valuable as they were, the desktop machines would be much more of an asset to an organization if they were connected. Before the advent of this PC permeation, there wasn’t much of a need for an independent networking industry. Until the microprocessor hit the desktop and began to push computing away from the centralized model, the big computer system companies had supplied their own communications hardware and software. It was proprietary stuff, but back then IT departments preferred homogeneous technology; platform independence wasn’t yet the gold standard it would become in the age of the Internet. But that situation was quickly changing. “More and more PCs were being deployed in business,” IDC analyst Ken Presti explained to me, “but the companies needed to make them talk to one another. Computers that were connected were inherently much more valuable.” Local-networking protocols, such as Ethernet and Token Ring, were emerging to support locally linked groups of PCs into LANs (Local Area Networks). More than 60 percent of the nearly 50 million PCs deployed in 1994 were wired to networks within companies, universities, and hospitals. 48\n\nCompetition and Convergence New technologies appeared to link the LANs into WANs (Wide Area Networks), and new companies formed to exploit them, in the process creating a new data-networking industry, independent of the old-line computer system vendors. Systems vendors, such as HewlettPackard, Digital, and IBM, which had been the de facto data-networking leaders, were soon surrendering their market dominance to companies specializing in the hardware and software that moved data among disparate machines and networks.\n\nThe Big Four In the early days of data networking, there were a slew of small players, but a kind of merger mania gripped the industry between 1989 and 1994. During that period, the data-networking industry saw 129 mergers and acquisitions. In the aggregate, these transactions totaled more than $4 billion. Initially, mergers and acquisitions served largely as a defensive tactic employed by the industry leaders to fend off the upstarts and each other. Even as Cisco was poised in 1994 to begin an unprecedented seven-year acquisition campaign, Morgan Stanley’s Bill Brady would write: While we continue to witness a large number of promising startups developing new technologies (switching technologies, ATM, etc.), we believe a far greater percentage of this crop will choose to merge with the networking establishment than was the case with prior generations.1\n\nIn 1994, Cisco was a leading member of the networking establishment. This was the year the company’s revenues surpassed the billion-dollar mark, its market cap approached $10 billion, and it joined the ranks of the Fortune 500. Cisco, and its rivals 3Com, Bay Networks, and Cabletron Systems, were considered the big four of data networking. Together they controlled about 80 percent of the market by the late 1990s. 49\n\nJohn Chambers and the Cisco Way Chambers has said that he looked at his competition back then in terms of the big eight, which also included Newbridge Networks, Ericsson, and the separate entities that formed Cabletron, Wellfleet, and Synoptics. “We broke away from those guys in about four years, and we broke away largely by using our own systems and a lot of people still don’t get that,” Chambers said in a 2001 interview. “We saved more money than our nearest traditional competitor. What they were spending on R&D we were putting back in R&D. If Cisco can’t beat them doing that then we are never going to win.”2 Networking-equipment maker 3Com Corporation was Cisco’s oldest competitor. Founded in 1979 by Robert Metcalfe, the former Xerox engineer who had helped to create the Ethernet protocols that linked the computers in Sandy Lerner and Leonard Bosack’s local networks at Stanford, 3Com grew into a formidable data-networking company. The three “coms” in the company’s name, which would one day adorn a football stadium in San Francisco, stood for “computer,” “communication,” and “compatibility.” In 1997, 3Com and market-leading modem maker U.S. Robotics agreed to merge. At the time, it was the largest merger in the history of the data-networking industry. The $6.3 billion merger created a company nearly as big as Cisco, with a broader product line. Rochester, New Hampshire-based Cabletron was another of Cisco’s elders, but not by much. Just a year older, it was founded in 1983 in a garage as a part-time venture. By 1996, it had evolved into a billion-dollar company. A fierce competitor for years, Cabletron had a very different culture from Cisco’s. Chambers described the company’s management team as street fighters for whom he had a lot of respect. At the end of the summer of 2001, Cabletron completed a “corporate transformation strategy” that spawned four new companies: GlobalNetwork Technology Services, a network-consulting firm; Enterasys Networks and Riverstone Networks, which operate as fully independent public companies; and Aprisma, which operates as an independent subsidiary of Enterasys. Cabletron ceased to exist as a separate public company. 50\n\nCompetition and Convergence The youngest of the big four was Bay Networks, which was formed in 1994 through a merger of Santa Clara, California-based SynOptics Communications and Wellfleet Communications of Billerica, Massachusetts. The merger created a billion-dollar company that provided routing, switching, ATM, remote access, and sophisticated network management from a single vendor. The founders chose the company name to reflect the locations of the two companies: the San Francisco Bay Area and the Bay State. At the time of the merger, SynOptics was the number-one hub vendor and Wellfleet was the number-two router provider. Cisco had considered a merger with SynOptics earlier that very year but instead acquired Crescendo Communications, which they thought would be a better fit, culturally and technologically. In the market dominated by these companies, small start-ups didn’t have m"
