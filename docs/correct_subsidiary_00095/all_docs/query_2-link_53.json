        "text": "How Hydraulic Solenoid Valves Function\n\nA solenoid is a wire coiled around a core. The core is made of an armature (a moving core) and a stationary core, both loaded with springs. The armature can move away or toward the stationary core when electrical current flows through the wire. The movement of the armature opens and closes the valves. When de-energized, a closed valve will stay closed, and an open valve will stay open.\n\nTypes of Hydraulic Solenoid Valves\n\nTwo-Way\n\nIn a hydraulic circuit, a two-way valve controls the direction of fluid flow. A two-way closed solenoid valve has two pipe links: a cavity port for the inlet and a body orifice port for the outlet.\n\nTwo Way Closed Solenoid Valves\n\nThe plunger is down in a usually closed solenoid valve when it is not energized, which seals the valve and stops liquid or gas from passing. When the solenoid is turned on, the magnetic field raises the plunger to open the seal and allow liquid flow.\n\nTwo-way Open Solenoid Valves\n\nMedia flows into the inlet port and out the stop port when the device is naturally de-energized. When the valve is activated, the plunger seals the aperture and prevents flow. When the orifice opens, the valve's flow resumes.\n\nThree Way Solenoid Valves\n\nA 3-way solenoid valve comprises three pipe connections: the stop port, the body orifice port, and the cavity port. The body orifice and the stop orifice, one of which is always open, enable two flow pathways.\n\n3-Way Open Solenoid Valve\n\nIn a 3-way open solenoid valve, the plunger is raised when the power is turned off. This seals the stop orifice and permits flow from the body orifice port and out the cavity port. When the power is on, the body orifice is sealed, and fluid flows from the cavity out the stop port.\n\n3-Way Normally Closed\n\nIn a 3-way closed solenoid valve, fluid flows through the cavity port and out the stop port while the plunger closes the body orifice. When the coil is turned on, the plunger rises to block the stop orifice and allow flow from the body orifice port out the stop port.\n\n3-Way Directional Control\n\n3-way directional control means the plunger can be raised or lowered when the valve is on. Raising the plunger seals the stop orifice and opens the body orifice. Lowering the plunger seals the body orifice and opens the stop orifice.\n\nFour-Way Solenoid Valve\n\nIn a four-way solenoid valve system, five valves change the flow direction. While resting, the core spring forces the solenoid forward against the base. The core's function is to seal it because when the solenoid is activated, it opens. The coil pulls the core away from the pilot base when electrified, allowing fluid to enter the pilot itself. As long as the coil is turned on, the pilot is forced against the spool to change the flow.\n\nApplication\n\nWater delivery system\n\nFuel supply system\n\nSewage treatment\n\nProcess management in production facilities\n\nHydraulic brakes, pumps, and motors for the automotive industry\n\nMarine and aeronautical sectors use hydraulic machinery\n\nHeavy equipment used in landscaping and building\n\nAgricultural industries' use of machinery\n\nBenefits\n\nMinimal energy use\n\nRemote controlled\n\nAffordable to maintain and provide service\n\nVery quick times for opening and closing\n\nWorking at a wide range of temperatures\n\nBlocking external leaks for safety\n\nOperates horizontally and vertically\n\nChoosing the Right Hydraulic Solenoid Valve Supplier\n\nTo ensure you have the most constructive outcome when purchasing hydraulic solenoid valves from a hydraulic solenoid valve supplier, it is important to compare several companies using our directory of hydraulic solenoid valve suppliers. Each hydraulic solenoid valve supplier has a business profile page highlighting their areas of experience and capabilities, along with a contact form to directly communicate with the supplier for more information or request a quote. Review each hydraulic solenoid valve business website using our patented website previewer to quickly learn what each company specializes in. Then, use our simple RFQ form to contact multiple hydraulic solenoid valve suppliers with the same form."
