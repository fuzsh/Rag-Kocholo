        "text": "I wonder why Cisco's CEO failed to mention that The NDS Group (headquartered in Great Britain) is actually incorporated in the tax haven of Bermuda where Cisco's Bermuda subsidiary has successfully evaded billions in U.S. corporate income taxes on profits earned in the United States that Cisco transferred overseas to avoid U.S. taxes?\n\nSee page 7:\n\n\"On August 1, 2011, NDS Group Holdings Limited was incorporated under the laws of Bermuda as an exempted company to become the holding company for NDS Group Limited.\"\n\nAccording to Bloomberg:\n\n\"In Rolle, about 25 miles north of Geneva, a subsidiary called Cisco Systems International Sarl collects billions of dollars a year. The unit in Rolle, which has roughly 100 workers, is owned by yet another Cisco subsidiary, registered at the offices of Conyers Dill & Pearman, a law firm in Hamilton, Bermuda. For U.S. tax purposes, profits from the Swiss and Dutch units flow to this shell company, one of hundreds the law firm handles on Bermuda, which has no corporate income tax.\"\n\nCisco's CEO failed to mention that after the last tax holiday in 2004, Cisco immediately began transferring overseas on a massive scale its U.S. earned profits and cash, at least according to its own internal slide presentation:\n\nCisco's Offshore Cash Holdings\n\nAnd Bloomberg states:\n\n\"Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) has cut its income taxes by $7 billion since 2005 by booking roughly half its worldwide profits at a subsidiary at the foot of the Swiss Alps that employs about 100 people.\"\n\nAll of this occurred after the 2004 tax holiday."
