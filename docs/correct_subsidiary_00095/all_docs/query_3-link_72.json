        "text": "Turbomachinery blades are an integral part of air breathing propulsion systems, gas and steam turbines and other energy conversion devices. The blade design is a very important process since it defines component performance. A parametric approach for the blade geometry design has been implemented. A variety of three dimensional blade shapes can be created using only a few basic parameters and limited interaction with a CAD system. Using a general approach for creating the blade geometries makes the process easy and robust for creating 3D blade shapes for various turbomachinery components. The geometry of the blade is defined by a very basic set of geometric and aerodynamic parameters. Parameters such as flow angles, axial chord, thickness to chord ratio and streamline meridional coordinates are defined. The leading edge and trailing edge are defined by curves as part of the input. Using these parameters, a specified number of 2D airfoils are created and are radially stacked on the d...\n\nA system for computer-aided design (CAD) for the construction of a C1 compressor profile (CAD_C1) in the integrated Mathcad package is developed. Results of the design of a symmetric initial C1 profile and a curved C1-based profile CAD-C1 are presented. CAD-C1 is constructed according to a modular principle, i.e., it constitutes a complex of information-bound computational software modules. The principal advantage of such a structure of the system is that each module is solved as an individual complete problem and, independently of the other modules, may be altered in the course of development and improvement of the system. Independent connection (complementation) of other modules and systems is also possible. Designs of two variants of curved profiles with identical (practically maximal) turning angle of the flow is implemented in corresponding software modules, using a method of growing thickness of the profile along the normal to the center line of the profile and a method based on nonlinear Hearst transformations. The geometric characteristics of the different design variants are calculated, statistical estimation of the correlation indices of the approximation results is performed, graphical construction of the variant profiles is realized, and the geometric parameters of the profiles are varied along the length of the profile chord. CAD_System C1 may be considered as an autonomous system and as a subsystem. The creation of the highly efficient flow path of blade machines (in particular, compressors) is a critical, important, and time-consuming multi-parameter problem. One method of designing the profiles of turbine machines is based on creating a flow path with the use of previously developed profiles (usually presented in atlases with known characteristics), which in the course of development of an individual cascade are curved in order to assure the required flow rotation (based on a gaseodynamic calculation). It is desirable to obtain an analytic description of the outline of a new profile each time for each variant. The general computation algorithm may be considered settled, while the algorithm for an individual profile must be refined. A computer-aided design (CAD) system with modular structure [1] is considered the most efficient approach for such a task. Two methods of constructing curved profiles from a base profile are used in the present study: a method of plotting the thickness of the profile normal to a center line [2]; and a method of nonlinear transformations (Hearst transformation I 2 with nonsingular center F 1 ∞ [3]), by means of which a desired outline may be obtained as an image of a second-order Bézier curve. A symmetric initial C1 compressor profile is the prototype of a curved compressor profile [4] the aerodynamic characteristics of which are known from experimental data. All the calculations and graphical constructions are performed in the Mathcad integrated mathematical package [5] with the use of a computer-aided design (CAD) system."
