        "text": "NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Cisco Systems Inc. Tuesday reported second-quarter operating earnings slightly ahead of Wall Street forecasts as the computer networking giant boosted sales by 40 percent.\n\nBefore a one-time acquisition-related charge, the San Jose, Calif.-based company logged a profit of $606 million, or 36 cents per share, on $2.83 billion in sales. Analysts polled by First Call expected Cisco (CSCO) to report a profit of 35 cents per share.\n\nThose figures exclude a one-time charge of $349 million, or 19 cents per share, for acquisition-related research and development. During the quarter, Cisco acquired Summa Four Inc., Clarity Wireless Corp., Selsius Systems Inc. and PipeLinks Inc. for a combined purchase price of approximately $537 million.\n\nIncluding that charge, Cisco's net income totaled $288 million, or 17 cents per share.\n\nCisco operating earnings outperformed last-year's second-quarter results, when it reported a profit of $457 million, or 29 cents a share, on revenue of $2.02 billion.\n\nCisco shares closed 2-5/8 lower at 112-3/8, then dipped to 109-1/2 in after-hours trade.\n\nCisco's stock lately has been a darling among investors. Cisco is the leading provider of networking equipment for the Internet, and analysts have expressed their fondness for companies that provide backbone Internet equipment.\n\nJohn Chambers, Cisco's president and chief executive officer, said the company gained market share across all its business segments and that the company is making strong inroads in developing networks that support voice, data and video transmission.\n\nIn January, Cisco and General Instrument Corp. (GIC) announced an agreement to work with AT&T Corp. (T) to develop an end-to-end Internet Protocol network.\n\n\"The Internet revolution will determine which companies survive and which get left behind,\" Chambers said. \"Increasingly, the Internet is recognized as the key driver in our global economy.\"\n\nConsolidation concerns\n\nWhile Cisco is the networking leader with a market capitalization of $177.5 billion, Chambers noted it will face more intense competition as major networking firms merge with telecommunications equipment providers.\n\nIn January, Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) announced plans to acquire No. 2 networking firm Ascend Communications Inc. (ASND) for $20 billion in stock.\n\nLast June, Canadian telecom giant Northern Telecom Ltd. bought Bay Networks Inc. for $9.1 billion to form Nortel Networks (NT).\n\nWhile those deals heat up the race to deploy voice and data networks, Cisco has not indicated any intention to align itself with a major telecom-equipment provider.\n\n\"We continue to believe that most major acquisitions will fail,\" said Don Listwin, a Cisco executive vice president, adding that the Lucent-Ascend deal will face many challenges because of product overlap and a lack of geographic proximity, among other issues.\n\nListwin added, however, that Cisco anticipates the Lucent-Ascend deal \"will be successful and we will position our approach to compete effectively.\"\n\nFor the six-month period ending Jan. 23, Cisco reported an operating profit of $1.16 billion, or 70 cents per share, on revenue of $5.42 billion, compared with earnings of $873 million, or 55 cents per share, on $3.89 billion in revenue in the year-ago period.\n\nCisco ended the quarter with $1.42 billion in cash assets."
