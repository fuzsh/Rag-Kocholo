        "text": "Cisco Systems By Gediminas Sumyla\n\nCompany overview • Cisco Systems, Inc. is the worldwide leader in networking for the Internet. Today, networks are an essential part of business, education, government and home communications, and Cisco Internet Protocol-based (IP) networking solutions are the foundation of these networks. • Cisco hardware, software, and service offerings are used to create Internet solutions that allow individuals, companies, and countries to increase productivity, improve customer satisfaction and strengthen competitive advantage. The Cisco name has become synonymous with the Internet, as well as with the productivity improvements that Internet business solutions provide.\n\nMission and vision • “At Cisco, our vision is to change the way people work, live, play and learn” – Cisco • Company’s mission is to enable people to make powerful connections-whether in business, education, philanthropy, or creativity. • Cisco Systems also strove to deliver a wide range of new products, expand its offerings through internal and external efforts, enhance customer support, and increase its presence around the world. • Organizations started to recognize the value of their information networks and the Internet as a source of business advantage; all of this drove company’s mission and vision. • Cisco saw the need for multiservice network and were trying to find the ways how to integrate voice, video and data networks together.\n\nExecutive leadership team • John T.

Market capitalization reaches $300 billion. Makes acquisitions with about 20 companies and corporations. Cisco forms partnerships with 10 leading companies to create standards for wireless Internet technology. • 2000 - Cisco became the world’s most valuable company, in terms of market cap, on March 27, with a high of $82 a share (market cap: $569B), closing at $80.06 (market cap: $555B). Makes acquisitions with about 30 companies and corporations. • 2003 - Cisco entered home networking market with its acquisition of The Linksys • Group. Cisco receives Presidential Award for Corporate Leadership. • 2006 – Revenues reach $28.5 billion.\n\nKey players • John Morgridge – he shaped the Cisco culture from day one, focusing on customer satisfaction, product quality, and frugality. • John Chambers – was known for his fair but ultra-competitive nature. He is a former IBM and Wang Laboratories marketing and sales veteran, fostered Cisco’s strong customer focus and was credited with continuing Cisco’s striking success in the networking industry.\n\nGoals and strategies • Company was trying to expand rapidly and offer new services and products. The main element of Cisco’s strategy during this expansion phase was to maintain a passionate customer focus and consistently try to exceed customer expectations. • Company targeted three key markets: enterprise, service providers, and small/medium business. • John Chambers wanted to enhance and expand already recognized brand and increased Cisco’s marketing to include television, Internet, and print advertising. • Cisco also strove to maintain its product leadership in each of the market segments it already served. The product leadership strategy involved the innovation of Cisco’s engineering teams, complemented by alliances, acquisitions, and minority investments.\n\nGoals and strategies • As the networking space became more competitive, and as minimizing time to market became more important, Chambers realized that Cisco could not keep up with the changing market needs solely through internal development. • Acquisitions and alliances to gain access to world-class technologies and people became a defining component of Cisco’s strategy. • This strategy is relatively unique: most high-tech companies considered looking to the outside for technological help a sign of weakness. • “The companies who emerge as industry leaders will be those who understand how to partner and those who understand how to acquire.” – John Chambers, CEO. • If Cisco did not have the technological capability, engineering capacity, or time to develop the product internally, the business development group would opt to acquire or partner with external player.\n\nGoals and strategies (cont’d) • Cisco was an active minority investor, which gave it insight into new technologies without having to deploy internal development resources. • Cisco was the most effective tech company at identifying, acquiring, and successfully integrating companies into its culture. • “When we acquire a company, we aren’t simply acquiring its current products, we’re acquiring the next generation of products through its people.” – John Chambers, CEO.\n\nMarket and industry • With an early foothold in this rapidly growing industry, Cisco quickly became the leader in the data networking equipment market – the “plumbing” of the Internet. • By 1997, Cisco made approximately 80% of the large-scale routers that powered the Internet. • Cisco held the number one or two position in most markets in which it competed. • Customers sought end-to-end networking solutions. • The ongoing deregulation of telecommunications and technology convergence were driving the trend toward the integration of voice, video and data networks. • Telecommunications market consisted of $250 billion.\n\nE-Commerce opportunities • Historically there were three separate types of networks: phone networks for transmitting voice, computer networks for transmitting data, and broadcast networks for transmitting video – but advances in digitalization allowed these forms of communication to be translated into binary computer language. • This made it possible to transmit voice, data and video over one network more efficiently and economically than using three disparate networks. • Cisco believed that this transition to this new networking would enable to capture share in $250 billion market. • Cisco was already a leader in networking, had excellent engineering and management teams and saw this opportunity as the best match for company.\n\nE-Commerce initiative • Cisco decided to address three key issues: time-to-market, recruiting top talent, and integration with the relevant Cisco business unit. • Wu Fu Chen, networking entrepreneur and two Cisco employees launched new networking company. • The product concept had potential, and the founding team was flush with engineering talent. • Cisco management team called this spin-in venture Ardent Communications. Wu Fu was the president and CEO. • “Make this product and we’ll give you lots of money.” – Mike Volpi, vice president of business development. • For Cisco to buy new company, Wu Fu and his team needed to develop a traffic aggregation device for data, voice and video with certain functional requirements.\n\nArdent Communications • First product was called Ardent 101. • Ardent 101 requirements included ability to accept data, voice and video traffic, up to 2 Mbps traffic, support ATM, frame relay, and TDM trunks. • Milestones for Ardent 101 included: after six months company shall have completed the specifications for function, architecture, and design for the product; after twelve months begin integration of product, after fifteen months begin beta program for the product, after eighteen months first customer shipment should occur. • Cisco gave the founding team and employees a large ownership position – over 55% on a fully diluted basis. • Retaining employees: Cisco laid out a four-year vesting period for the options granted to employees – 25% would vest after the first year, with the remainder vesting monthly over the next three years. • The founding team proposed a simple put/call structure that would give Cisco the option to purchase the company at a prespecified price, but would also obligate Cisco to purchase the company if the new team succeeded in building the product.\n\nMissed opportunities • Cisco could have hired external talent and engineers to develop and build the product in the company. This could have saved money and problems that they faced making acquisitions with companies. This would also save money and time that Cisco spent on integrating those companies into Cisco business unit. This strategy would also give engineers and hired talent advantage of working within the company, cooperating with existing employees and using company’s experience."
