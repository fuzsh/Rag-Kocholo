        "text": "This page is an archive for Community Wishlist Survey 2019 proposals that won't go on to the voting phase. Proposals may be archived for various reasons, including: the proposal is too vague, the idea is technically unfeasible, the problem has already been solved, an existing product team is already working on it, the proposal is a social/community change rather than a technical one, or the proposal is asking to remove features that WMF product teams have built.\n\nOnly members of the Community Tech or Technical Collaboration teams should move proposals into or out of the Archive. If your proposal has been archived and there's still time before the voting phase starts, please continue the discussion on your proposal! You may be able to fix a problem with the proposal, and get it back in the survey. Once the voting phase starts on November 16, 2018, we can't move any proposals out of the Archive.\n\nWithdrawn by proposer (too many proposals)\n\nProblem:\n\nOn most WMF projects, editor activity levels have remained stagnant (or have even declined) for at least several years. The editor base is also still composed of pretty much the same mix of people as it was ten years ago (with a demographic bias towards white men in the \"global North\"). Maybe this is fine, or maybe it shouldn't be.\n\nCurrently the editor recruitment process consists largely of the \"Edit\" and \"Create account\" buttons, both of which are out of sight and out of mind for the typical reader finding out what happened today, settling an argument with someone, or researching their school project. As for editathons, I'll quote two articles in the English Wikipedia's Signpost:\n\n\"[...] in a nutshell, the story of all my outreach in Namibia. Operation successful, patient dead: A well-run workshop resulted in exactly zero new editors, zero subsequent edits, zero subsequent picture uploads.\"\n\n\"[...] they are a useful institution. However, they don't generate many new persistent editors. They mostly attract attendance by promising new biographies, and newbies arrive expecting to make articles about their friends.\"\n\nTo me, this immediately raises two issues (although I'm not going to pretend that I've done in-depth research, I hope these are fairly plausible conclusions):[1]\n\nMost people don't really know what Wikipedia editors actually do or what they write about.\n\nMost people don't really think about editing Wikipedia regularly, or consider that they in particular should become a Wikipedia editor.\n\nIf almost no one is actually aware (or made aware) that they can fix typos or write about their favourite musician's back catalogue or participate in the latest culture war or share their vacation pictures, then the obvious conclusion is that no one will actually come to edit. Songs that millions of people have listened to, for instance,[2] might not even get their own Wikipedia article (in any language). Just one of those millions of people would have been enough for those songs to get their own article.\n\nI think it would be beneficial to all Wikimedia communities for the WMF to have some sort of process of recruiting editors extending outside the existing Wikimedia websites and outside the people who are already in Wikimedia movement.[3]\n\nWho would benefit: Wikimedia projects, broadly construed; new editors\n\nProposed solution:\n\nI can't propose one solution to this. However, perhaps at least raising awareness on other parts of the internet (or other parts the real world) would help. Advertising might be beneficial, and it was the first thing I thought of that might help. It might be more convincing than \"anyone can edit\" at telling people that they in particular should try out editing and/or edit regularly (i.e. \"why should I edit? anyone else can already edit\"). Perhaps specific groups of people[4] could be asked to, say, spend their evening commute fixing some typos or adding information to Wikidata items; or some large billboard could have some information about Wikipedia or the less-well-known projects.[5] In particular, targeting specific groups might help with finding groups of people who are likely to come back after making their first edit. Other avenues might include submitting op-eds to medium-importance newspapers, or having an interesting Twitter account.[6] Furthermore, it might also be beneficial to explore new on-wiki ways of getting people to edit regularly, perhaps by sending a notification if new users haven't edited in a while,[7] or by sending suggestions of what to try to new and currently active editors.[8]\n\nOf course, editing Wikimedia projects (possibly excepting uploading to Commons) is never going to have obvious mass appeal, given that most people haven't had to cite sources in years. But there are always going to be people who just haven't found out that they want to edit yet.\n\nMore comments: If something like this is indeed pursued, I would hope that the process is transparent to editors (at least on the English Wikipedia, there are sometimes complaints about how the developers didn't bother to tell anyone that they were going to do something). For example, if notifications are to be sent to new users asking them to come back and edit some more, the affected projects' communities could be informed of what the notification looks like and could have a consensus-based final approval on its text.\n\nPhabricator tickets:\n\nProposer: Jc86035 (talk)\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis proposal in its present form is too vague and therefore not actionable. We'll have to archive it unless some concrete technical things to do are added to it. On another hand, we have a whole team - Growth - that work on this full time, so it might be unnecessary at all. Max Semenik (talk)\n\nYes, we have a new team, Growth, that is working specifically on new editor recruitment and retention, so it would be better to convey these ideas to that team rather than having the Community Tech team work on it as a wishlist item. Ryan Kaldari (WMF) (talk)\n\n@Ryan Kaldari (WMF) and MaxSem: Okay. I'm actually planning to post two other proposals (and have already posted two), so perhaps if no one else decides to pick up the specific concrete proposals (targeted advertising, increased notifications to new users) then I'll abandon it by the end of the proposal period.

From my perspective and my experience of w:zh:WP:RFCUHAM, I have found out that tthough the number of requests has decreased, it can be seen from the content of the request that for the administratora, the speed of accurately handling all the damage involving socket puppets is restricted.\n\nWho would benefit: All Chinese Wikipedia community members\n\nProposed solution: Reinstate all Chinese Wikipedia's CheckUsers' permissions.\n\nPhabricator tickets: Currently N/A, please consult the Wikimedia Foundation for more information.\n\nProposer: Mend My Way\n\nDiscussion\n\n@WQL: Could you please provide more content what \"discharged in March 2018\" means exactly?

JAn Dudík (talk)\n\nWithdrawn by proposer (too many proposals)\n\nProblem: Many times we need to know not only where some page is included, but also where it was.\n\nWho would benefit: Looks like any wiki editor, patroller and admin.\n\nProposed solution: Keeping the inclusion history for pages. Category, template, module, image mostly. Category means including and excluding pages to it, and not the opposite. Each entry will show some inclusion or exclusion the page in some particular page.\n\nMore comments: It can take a lot of space, so it can be possible to keep the history fot templates, and only them, for the last month only.\n\nPhabricator tickets: None.\n\nProposer: IKhitron (talk)\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis proposal, as well as the similar one that requests the same for categories, misses a real problem statement. What is the actual problem you're trying to solve here? Why is it important? How do you want to surface this information? Max Semenik (talk)\n\nI propose it just because there were hundreds of times I was needed this information. Here are a couple of examples. Last week on Commons there was a deletion request for an image. It was not included in any article in wikipedias, because after the deletion request some user removed it from the article, with summary \"going to be deleted\". So, the users that discussed and decided if the image should be deleted, did not have the information for which article it was uploaded. Another example. I'm editing a template. As a result, it should stop to add some category to a group of articles. I need to check if it removed from exactly the same partition of articles that is needed to, not more and not less. Another example. Some bot removed unintentionally some template from a lot of pages. I need to have the list of them, so I can revert this easily, even if the pages were edited by other users after this, and even a year later. Hope it helps. Thank you. IKhitron (talk)\n\nI think it would be beneficial (and be advantageous due to the vote-based selection process) to merge the closely-related proposals together if they all target the same problem. Jc86035 (talk)\n\nI do not understand, Jc86035, there is another proposal with the same target, that I do not aware about? IKhitron (talk)\n\nAs in, if Community Wishlist Survey 2019/Miscellaneous/Create a magic word to check category inclusion for previous page version would be solving the same problem, then I think it would help to merge it into this one. (In any case, each user can only own three proposals, so you would have to abandon one of them at some point.) Jc86035 (talk)\n\nI see. Well, it should solve absolutely different problem, there is no connection between these two proposals at all. About three proposals, I know, and I'll remove one of course. IKhitron (talk)\n\nHey IKhitron, unfortunately this proposal is not suitable for the same reasons as the category one: it's a big feature with a lot of hardware requirements. Our team just wouldn't be able to work on this. MaxSem (WMF) (talk)\n\nWithdrawn by proposer (too many proposals)\n\nProblem: Currently some of the things in the dashboard can only be in English.

Wikivoyage uses it and some Wikipedias are using it for different purpouses. Currently, the image origin button is not working, making it very difficult to design pages correctly. Also, this feature is not deployed in most Wikipedias, and it could be interesting to have it elsewhere, as it gives a different look to pages (i.e. help or wikiproject pages can have this distinction with Pagebanner).\n\nWho would benefit: Readers and wikis with Pagebanner installed.\n\nProposed solution: Solving the origin problem and deploying it.\n\nMore comments:\n\nPhabricator tickets: task T191689\n\nProposer: Theklan (talk)\n\nDiscussion\n\nWhat is the image origin button that does not work? · · · Peter (Southwood) (talk):\n\n@Pbsouthwood: It's explained in task T191689\n\nWithdrawn by proposer (too many proposals)\n\nProblem: The book creator has been broken for more than a year.

But we could make a better option if we could translate SVGs directly using Wikidata items. Many things should still be translated by hand, but think on anatomy, astronomy or chemistry schemas automatically translated using Wikidata labels.\n\nWho would benefit: Small Wikipedias\n\nProposed solution: Giving the possibility to label svgs by Q instead of directly writing it.\n\nMore comments:\n\nPhabricator tickets:\n\nProposer: Theklan (talk)\n\nDiscussion\n\nI think Commons's tabular data pages might be better for this, since Wikidata items and lexemes aren't really suited to translation of long phrases. Jc86035 (talk)\n\n@Jc86035: Thanks for the insight. I have to delete this proposal, as 3 is the limit. Would you like to adopt it? -Theklan (talk)\n\n@Theklan: Sorry, I can't because I already have three active proposals. Jc86035 (talk)\n\nN Proposes a social rather than a technical change.\n\nProblem: Wikipedia is plagued by vandalism from users who don’t bother to create accounts and just edit using their IP address. This makes pointless and frustrating work for experienced editors who constantly have to revert such edits and makes it difficult to determine who is responsible for edits since IP addresses can be shared.\n\nWho would benefit: Everyone who is serious about using and editing Wikipedia. It would cut down on the possibility of new users to see nonsense posted on some page, on the workload of people watching pages, and on admins who need to hold vandals responsible.\n\nProposed solution: Last month (September 2018) I participated in the Semantics 2018 conference on the Semantic Web in Vienna. One of the most interesting talks was a keynote from Elena Simperl a professor of computer science at the University of Southampton titled: One does not simply crowdsource the Semantic Web: 10 years with people, URIs, graphs and incentives. You can find the PDF of her talk below, I recommend it, it was full of good real world data and examples: Semantics 2018 Crowdsourcing Keynote The absolute number one take away point she had was very simple: the most disruptive and non-constructive contributions to crowd sourced projects (of which of course Wikipedia is one of the seminal examples) come from users who do not bother to set up an account. This is something that’s amazed me ever since I joined Wikipedia several years ago. It may have made sense when Wikipedia was new and the goal was just to attract as many people as possible but IMO there is no doubt that if we collected data on the balance of constructive vs disruptive edits from IP users the balance would be exponentially greater that such users do far more harm than good. It doesn’t take long to set up an account. You need to give an email, user ID, and password. If you can’t be bothered to do that you clearly don’t care much about editing. People are now used to the concept of logging into systems. This would be a trivial change, it wouldn’t take any significant work from the over worked technical people and IMO it would save endless hours of reverting vandalism from IP users.\n\nMore comments:\n\nPhabricator tickets:\n\nProposer: MadScientistX11 (talk)\n\nArchived\n\nHi, unfortunately I had to decline this proposal as it describes a policy/social issue while this wishlist is for technical issues only. If you want to make this change happen, you need to get consensus to disable anonymous editing from affected communities. Once such consensus has been achieved, making a technical change would be trivial, it wouldn't need to be on the wishlist. Thanks for participating in our survey.

Jc86035 (talk)\n\nThank you for asking. I think I mean both. Orphée (talk)\n\n@Orf3us: Usually I would think that all of the ownership data is in statements which use owned by (P127). If d:Q23908#P127 is the sort of data you're referring to I don't think new properties should be needed, and it would be out of the scope of Community Tech anyway, since anyone can propose new Wikidata properties at d:Wikidata:Property proposal. Also, unless it is currently technically impossible to show that data on your wiki , it's probably out of the scope of Community Tech to edit a single infobox. (I am unfamiliar with Wikidata infoboxes, because they are little used on the English Wikipedia.) Jc86035 (talk)\n\nThanks anyway for your answer and solution. Orphée (talk)\n\nThanks for your proposal, Orf3us. Jc86035 is correct that this is not a technical change. Proposing new Wikidata properties and changes to infoboxes can be done on Wikidata. It is a community-controlled change rather than a technical one. -- NKohli (WMF) (talk)\n\nN Outside the scope of Community Tech\n\nProblem: We have a proliferation of Templates and Modules which are copied from one WMF wiki to another, without the ability to maintain them centrally, because all Templates and Modules are specific to one wiki. This puts a huge burden on editors of small wikis when we try to copy existing Templates and Modules from larger wikis.\n\nCommons already stores images centrally for other WMF wikis to use. If we can have the same behaviour for Templates and Modules, this will save a lot of time for everyone. The central repository of Templates and Modules can be hosted on either Commons or Wikidata - either is fine.\n\nThis problem was discussed extensively at the Wikidata and infoboxes panel at Wikimania 2017 and there is strong consensus that a central repository of Templates and Modules will solve this problem.\n\nWho would benefit: Small wikis and cross-wiki editors; Template and Module curators.\n\nProposed solution: When someone tries to transclude a template or invoke a module which doesn't exist locally, but there is an equivalent module or template in the central repository (say, Commons), transclude that template or module instead.\n\nThis is basically the same behaviour as pulling media from Commons, but for templates and modules.\n\nMore comments:\n\nPhabricator tickets: T121470\n\nProposer: Deryck C.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPing User:ערן, User:Theklan, and User:RexxS who discussed this issue with me before. Deryck C.\n\nThanks Deryck Chan! I found this problem when installing the fully automated template system on some small Wikipedias. They don't have anything, not even a coordinates system there. Modules could be better mantained with this system, and there's always the possibility to fork and i18n. -Theklan (talk)\n\nNot sure that the central repository of templates and modules should be commons as there are a lot of templates and modules on there that are commons specific. If it was to be used as the central repository, the shared templates and modules should be stored in separate namespaces, for example sharedtemplate: and sharedmodule: rather than within template: and module: -- WOSlinker (talk)\n\n@WOSlinker: That shouldn't be a problem: if a local Template or Module exists, then the local Template or Module will be loaded instead. It hasn't been a problem that certain files are Commons-specific. Alternatively, we can put the central repository for Templates and Modules on Wikidata. Deryck C.\n\nI think that this proposal has an important social issue: Who is going to exercise editorial control on the modules and templates? The community that hosts the repository or the communities that use it? An edit to the repository might break pages on another project and that will lead to conflict if there is no regulatory process. If people apply a lot of local opt outs to avoid this problem many benefits of the central repository will be negated. Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk, contributions)\n\nPresumably the new wiki would have its own administrators and policies? I think it would be easiest to think about it as if it were Wikidata but for templates and modules (the analogy being that Wikidata content is also transcluded to multiple wikis). Jc86035 (talk)\n\nAnd do the communities that use the repository get a say in how it drafts its policies and appoints its administrators? The issue isn't so much how to organize the repository, but how to organize the repository so that it forestalls any \"decisions in the repository affect content elsewhere\" problems. Incorrect data on Wikidata have caused problems on other projects where it has been transcluded, since editors on the other projects do not always know how to fix the incorrect data or where the problem lies, and I think we ought to avoid the same problems reoccurring on a code repository. Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk, contributions)\n\nRepository doesn't mean \"mandatory\". A repository of commons templates (coordinates, collapsible list...) can be there and if a local community wants changes, they make them locally, not in the repository. -Theklan (talk)\n\nDer, Legoktm may be able to tell you what is the status of this, I think it was a part of their work.

Furthermore this was a top 10 wish in the 2015 survey (before we refined our scope), so there's no need to re-propose. Rest assured this is known wish -- everybody wants it, but our small team isn't capable of delivering it. As such I'm moving it to the archives, but thank you for the taking the initiative to propose it again :) Please feel free to continue with the discussion. MusikAnimal (WMF) (talk)\n\nDer & MusikAnimal (WMF): If community tech doesn't have enough resources for such project, we should think how to re-scope it/break it down to smaller and feasible steps. For example, converting top 5 used templates (across all wikis) to Lua extension (suggested name: wmf-common-templates extension). eranroz (talk)\n\nNot a bad idea! There was talk of doing something similar for common gadgets as a workaround to global gadgets. I don't recall what happened with that. Anyway, if we're just talking about setting up an extension to contain global modules (probably not also templates), and not implementing these modules, then this might be feasible for us.

JAn Dudík (talk)\n\nN Too problematic from a legal point of view\n\nProblem: Administrators can use Special:DeletedContributions to search for user contributions that have been deleted before. However, most users gain many deleted contribs over time, maybe by patrolling new pages, or by doing simple mistakes. Reviewing these revisions would make many things easier, especially for newbies:\n\nAfter a sysop deleted your work, you can review what you did wrong to understand his concerns.\n\nYou can comprehend your own wiki-history even years later and do some statistics.\n\nReally problematic things are hidden by oversight anyway.\n\nWho would benefit: All non-admins with interest in their own on-wiki history of some sort, as mentioned above.\n\nProposed solution: Introducing a mydeletedhistory permission allowing to view the history of own deleted contributions, but not their content, as this can be problematic (copyright, privacy, offending edits, private information store). By default, this permission could be assigned to the autoconfirmed group.\n\nMore comments:\n\nPhabricator tickets: T208348\n\nProposer: MGChecker (talk)\n\nDiscussion\n\nI like this idea, it would be very useful at Wikinews to allow users to browse their deleted submissions and corresponding reviewer feedback. 1) However this takes many clicks to view for a sysop now, I would suggest to write an interface where people can view the old page contents with one click. 2) Also I would maybe suggest to make it limited to a particular user right because often people could abuse this feature to re-create deleted pages which were highly promotional. Gryllida\n\nArchived\n\nUnfortunately, this is a no-go for legal reasons: we're legally not permitted to store publicly certain kinds of content, even if \"publicly\" means \"whomever has password to a certain non-privileged account\". Regardless, thanks for participating in our survey! MaxSem (WMF) (talk)\n\n@MaxSem (WMF): I have a few problems with this assesment:\n\nThis proposal is about introducing permissions like that. This part isn't legally problematic per se. Assigning them to appropiate groups is a second part. Particularly, this isn't targeted at making own deleted content visible, but only own log entries of this content. There might be a misunderstanding here regarding the readability of deleted content, for further information please consult the linked task on Phabricator.\n\nHas this particular suggestion been legally assesed before? I wasn't able to find any record of this idea on Phabricator. If yes, please provide additional information.\n\nI think it would be a pity if this proposal is archived before it's investigated whether it's really that problematic as it may seem. --MGChecker (talk)\n\nYes, we ran this past our legal team. MaxSem (WMF) (talk)\n\nN Proposes a policy change rather than a technical feature\n\nProblem: Users often disagree about what is a good admin, and why they (you) should not support a specific admin. At various projects this has been solved (or sort of solved) in various ways, some vote their admins in and out without much rules, while other use fixed terms and extremely elaborate rules. No rules makes it easy to get rid of a non-functional admin, but it can be very scary to be an admin without rules. Fixed terms should on the other hand lead to rotation of admins, but often it does not. It also lead to rather harsh and unfriendly admins when they are not up for reelection – sorry for that admins! :)\n\nWho would benefit: All users would benefit from a more representative admin group, where it is easier to vote admins in and out, at any time. This could stop the continuous rant about admins protecting other admins, as it would be easy to withdraw a vote for a specific admin. It would also be better for the admins themselves to know more about their own standing in the community, as they would instantly know if they have support for their actions.\n\nProposed solution: Create a special page where the admins, or any user group that needs clear support for their actions can be listed, and let a user \"vote\" for their admins by placing a tick mark by the admins name. Let the user give one vote in total, but spread it evenly on each checked admin. It should be possible to sort the admins on their total weights, and then let the bureaucrats remove the admins that does not get above a certain threshold. This is nearly the same as a w:borda count, and it scales quite well as the project community grows and shrinks.\n\nMore comments:\n\nThe threshold can be calculated as a fraction of the overall edit activity on the project.\n\nBureaucrats should be given a notification when an admin drops below the threshold.\n\nThere should be a visible note on the admins user page saying how they score.\n\nIt is tempting to include some measure of the admins activity themselves, but that would be out of context.\n\nIt should probably be possible to propose yourself as an admin candidate, given some limits, or ask the bureaucrat to ad someone.\n\nPhabricator tickets:\n\nProposer: — Jeblad\n\nDiscussion\n\nUnfortunately, I had to decline this proposal as it proposes a wiki policy change first and foremost, and this survey is a wrong venue to do that. We won't be able to work on technical aspects of this proposal until there's a policy in place. Thanks for participating in our survey. MaxSem (WMF) (talk)\n\nI have described a special page that a project may choose to use, I'm not even sure how it is possible to read it any other way? Using a tool like the special page could imply a policy change within a project, creating a tool does not. — Jeblad\n\nN Proposes a policy change rather than a technical feature\n\nProblem: Someone disagrees, and something is done that leads to an unpopular or outright faulty action. Most users have been there. And often (but not always) one part is an admin. The war-like situation is not easy to resolve for anyone, and we need some kind of tool that is reasonably fast and efficient. We need an easy way to vote for an undo action.\n\nWho would benefit: Users in general could request a vote over an undo action, but it would be a help for admins in particular as it takes a problem (the do-action) and force it into another process (the undo-action).\n\nProposed solution: Assume something is done, like an edit war, and an admin tries to resolve the problem. To do so one of the users are blocked, and unfortunately the wrong user in one or another perspective. The admin disagree and the whole thing starts to turn into a rage war. That is not good at all, for any of the parties. Now assume the blocked user can still request a vote over the do-action (the blocking) in effect requesting a vote over a proposed undo-action. This vote request can be logged and shown as outstanding at some central page (like the signpost). It is open for 24 hours, and if the outcome is accepted then it is automatically done. If it is rejected it simply goes away by itself. The default action would be to reject, and votes would be given weights according to the users groups. Voting would be anonymous, but you would see your previous cast vote. Involved users (their IP) would be blocked from voting.\n\nMore comments:\n\nBureaucrats should be able to close a vote process unless they are involved in the action somehow.\n\nThe vote process should only be started by autoconfirmed users, possibly also only involved users, or bureaucrats.\n\nIt is not easy to implement simple undo-actions for all possible do-actions.\n\nInvolved users could be collected from page revision history, etc.\n\nStarting the vote-process can also be used as an implicit request to hold the do-action for the duration of the process, ie giving a cool off for 24 hours.\n\nIt is important that the vote-process use a drop-through model, where no votes imply a reject.\n\nPhabricator tickets:\n\nProposer: — Jeblad\n\nDiscussion\n\nSorry, I'm archiving this proposal because our survey is the wrong venue to propose policy changes and we're not going to work on technical measures that don't already have policy support on the wikis.

Using a tool like the special page could imply a policy change within a project, creating a tool does not. — Jeblad\n\nWithdrawn by proposer\n\nProblem: The closest we have to a \"news section\" is a portal page, but it is often stale with outdated information. What would be very nice is to show the currently active articles, that is top ranked pages for a given category. Such a page would be like a news section in a news paper, and could answer the question \"what is trending within this field right now\".\n\nWho would benefit: The editors would see what is most active within their field of expertise, and the readers could use Wikipedia like a newspaper.\n\nProposed solution: The easiest solution is probably to make the top list from WikiStats2 available at the individual wikis as JSON, like this one, and leave the implementation to some Lua hackers. A slightly better (but also more involved solution) would be to create a special page like the w:Special:NearBy, but for w:Special:Category/Norway (or perhaps w:Special:Portal/Norway) instead. It would be necessary to include a lot more content than at the nearby page, more like the extracts used in the mobile interface.\n\nMore comments:\n\nNearly every hard problem for this is solved except making the data available for reuse at the individual wikis.\n\nThe (special) page should be able to show an overall top list for the main page, and separate top lists for categories.\n\nIt could be interesting to use a parser function instead, and embed the generated content on portal pages.\n\nPhabricator tickets:\n\nProposer: — Jeblad\n\nDiscussion\n\nWithdrawn by proposer\n\nProblem: Gelegentlich kommt es vor, das man statt des Danke-Buttons anzuklicken eine Bearbeitung revetiert oder anderweitig versehentlich auf den Revert-Button klickt.

However it breaks down at the poles, displaying a lot of whitespace and massively distorting the lowest/highest latitudes. For a live example, see commons:Category:South Pole Telescope\n\nWho would benefit: Users/editors working on topics that are close to the north or south pole\n\nProposed solution: Use a different coordinate system that works better at the poles\n\nMore comments: This is probably more tricky than it sounds, as it requires a fundamental logic change in Kartographer to handle a different coordinate system. It was recently marked as \"declined\" on phabricator as \"It's unlikely we'll have the resources in the foreseeable future to support multiple projections.\"\n\nPhabricator tickets: T185858\n\nProposer: Mike Peel (talk)\n\nDiscussion\n\nHi @ Mike Peel. You suggest Kartographer use a coordinate system that will solve the problem of distorted, empty polar maps. Do you know of such a system? What are the alternatives and the tradeoffs each brings? Anyone? —JMatazzoni (WMF) (talk)\n\nComment: en:List of map projections provides a useful overview. Of those covered, several feature lower distortion in the polar regions than the Mercator; the most readily implemented might be the en:Miller cylindrical projection which retains a rectangular shape and somewhat improves the poles. A much better alternative IMO is the en:Hammer projection; its downside is the ellipsoidal shape, which requires more screen real estate for a given resolution of features. --Elmidae (talk)\n\n@JMatazzoni (WMF): It's complicated. In my day job, we use en:HEALPix to pixelize the whole astronomical sky - and then you can render individual patches using cartesian maps in order to display them (cartesian maps are fine as long as they're smaller than a few degrees on a side). The issue is that a single rendered map is used for the whole of the globe. However, I've just had a look at the south pole on OpenStreetMap, and as they use the same system they have the same problem - so it's not actually possible to edit the map at the poles, which makes displaying the map correctly at the poles rather redundant. As such, I'm withdrawing this proposal. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk)\n\n@Mike Peel: I'm a bit late, but it is actually possible to edit close to the poles (or at least it's possible to make mechanical edits close to them), even though the objects don't get displayed on the map. However, almost all OSM maps and renderers (except possibly Marble) only use Mercator, and there is basically nothing there right now, possibly because most satellite imagery that OSM can use is also Mercator (and so no imagery tiles are generated south of about 85°).

Especially tables can benefit from this small enhancement.\n\nProposed solution: Add 10 additonal pixels in margin-top to easily allow using the desktop interface on Smartphones and Tablets. Only one single line needs to be added into the standard CSS style sheet. Change the standard Monobook CSS to add e.g. body { margin-top: 10px; } for Wikipedia and div#globalWrapper { margin-top: 10px; } for Wikidata.\n\nMore comments: The mobile skin does not allow for easily editing all parts and options of a page. Switching to desktop mode with the Monobook skin gives the user the same interface as on a laptop or desktop. Currently the top menu bar is too close to the address bar on a mobile device, so when a user wants to click on an menu option the address bar is inadvertently activated, and the menu options are not easily accessible.

Even a picture cannot be easily put at that location.\n\nWho would benefit: All MediaWiki users (basically everyone)\n\nProposed solution: Frequently the page table of contents takes up a large vertical size of the screen while more than half of the (right) screen width remains blank. The real page content is needlessly shifted down, potentially moving all text off-screen on small screens, with subsequent additional scrolling being required from the user. Moving the TOC from top-left to top-right makes better use of the available screen space and produces a better visual presentation allowing for more easy reading. Frequently leading sections do not contain too much text, nor tables, nor images, so it perfectly aligns the screen layout with the TOC.\n\nMore comments: A few lines of CSS code moves the page table of contents (TOC) \"top-right\" instead of (the default) \"top-left\". No further impact on the GUI. No impact on the software. Useful for all skins. Version independent. Only the CSS #toc style needs to be changed.

My problem is with this annual survey. I write on average 500 new articles per year and edit many more. In doing so I often think I wish there was a way of doing XXX easier. This annual survey should be a place that I can ask Is there any way to make doing XXX easier?. But I can't because the survey is too technical for my understanding. Say, for example, having posted an article without any images and linked to Wikidata I would like a \"hint box\" coming up saying have you thought of using one of these images to illustrate this article?, I don't know how to add such a suggestion to this survey because I don't know how to suggest it in the technical terms that the survey requires.

The idea is that we need to step back from LiquidThreads and Flow, and start over with a totally public and transparent consultation. We want to bring together as many people as possible, and come to consensus on the problems with talk pages that we want to solve, the good things about talk pages that we want to keep, and the tradeoffs involved in finding a solution that will work for new and experienced editors. You can read a lot more about it on that project page that I linked. The planning has just started, and we're starting to talk about the structure for this consultation and how it's going to work.\n\nThe bad news for right now is that we don't want to include proposals about talk pages in the Wishlist Survey voting. No matter what happens in the Wishlist Survey voting, all of the future talk page work will be determined by the Talk pages consultation happening next year. We don't want people to vote for something, and then find out that we still have to have another process before we make any decisions.\n\nBut -- these proposals and the discussions that people are having here are important, and I've added a section on the Talk pages consultation page which lists each of the related proposals, so that they can be a part of the public record during this planning stage.

Let me know what you think. -- DannyH (WMF) (talk)\n\nThanks DannyH, no problem and look forward to the discussion. I hope that in our discussion next year, we can talk about both what might make a great future solution (eg. VE, flow, etc.) but also about things that can improve the current experience and can be implemented more easily in the meantime, lest the best become the enemy of the good. --Tom (LT) (talk)\n\nYes, that's absolutely going to be part of the discussion.

I think the script linked above for 'reply' link on talk pages is a better implementation. Gryllida\n\nBut that's a problem with the VE on every huge page, regardless where it's located. This is a feature, that should be implemented in the article namespace as well. Up to now the VE makes a artificial differentiation between wikipages and wikipages, despite wikipages should behave the same way everywhere. Grüße vom Sänger ♫(Reden) 05:30, 31 October 2018 (UTC)\n\nThis would help in training new editors. I often teach them to use VE, but don't have time to explain source editing, so sometimes they feel lost trying to edit a talk page. It would also make Wikipedia's editing interface on talk pages more consistent. Rachel Helps (BYU) (talk)\n\nIf I remember correctly one reason why it's not released on talk pages was that indenting comments is not easy using VE. There should be some button provided by VE where you can choose to which comment you want to reply and indents should then come automatically. Stryn (talk)\n\nThere is no problem using indenting here in this discussion with the VE. So if this was given as a reason, it was either a bigus reason then, or it was solved since. I use indention with a \":\" here in this paragraph, and I'm using VE, so no problem. Grüße vom Sänger ♫(Reden) 05:27, 6 November 2018 (UTC)\n\nVE was built for article pages, basically--it would take too much time to make it work for talk pages. Even if that were not the reason, re-requesting a change that wasn't in scope last year isn't going to make it in scope this year. --Izno (talk)\n\nA wikipage is a wikipage is a wikipage.

Let me know what you think. -- DannyH (WMF) (talk)\n\nI think, this is delaying a simple and feasible solution another year, just to not let people get any experience with the normal editors on talk pages. If you just switch it on, even perhaps just as a test on some user talk pages, there could be some experience with it, but as this could be some positive experience that would be detrimental to Flow, this will not happen. Flow is far too much protected from any harm by those, that seem to have invested a lot in it, regardless of it's usefulness, that any negative possible side projects have to be avoided.\n\nI just saw in the source code, thar VE uses <blockquote> here in this talk instead of normal colons, that's making the text quite unreadable in source code, i.e. the old Editor/normal talk page Editor. Grüße vom Sänger ♫(Reden)\n\nSänger: Yes, in the past Wishlist Surveys, we closed all proposals related to talk pages because there was another product team working on Flow, and Community Tech couldn't do anything that would interfere with that team's work. We're changing that strategy now, and the Talk pages consultation is going to help us all figure out what we're doing next. Turning on VE for talk pages is one of the things we'll be talking about in that consultation -- see the section in the Talk pages consultation page about \"Possible solutions\". For right now, we're not going to make any changes related to talk pages, because we want to have those discussions first. -- DannyH (WMF) (talk)\n\nFine, you moved it from meta to MW, where I'm banned in some shady backroom kangaroo court because I was a bit outspoken against the devs, that ignored facts and perpetuated falsehoods about Flow and VE. I thought MW was only about technical stuff, this is something about social and community interaction stuff, the technology has to follow the needs of the editors, not the other way around. So here on meta would be the right place for this discussion, not over there. Grüße vom Sänger ♫(Reden)\n\nN Outside the scope of Community Tech\n\nProblem: talk pages are not convenient to use.\n\nWho would benefit: all users.\n\nProposed solution: turn on talks without wiki-technology in all talkpages (non-multiple-namespaces). Discussions will be like as comments on http://4pda.ru, http://habr.com or other sites with same design of comments. It is simple, laconic and functional. But don't loss the templates with {}, they will work.\n\nMore comments: Ye, it's a rocket science. Renovate all mechanics of discussions! But... Really, we are the most popular site in the Internet, why we will look like a Soviet tractor? We will look like Yandex, Google and other top sites. Don't be a dinosaur!\n\nPhabricator tickets:\n\nProposer: Фред-Продавец звёзд (talk)\n\nDiscussion\n\nYou seem to be asking for the feature currently called \"Structured Discussions\", which has a long and somewhat controversial history. Anomie (talk)\n\nI think there is already a good implementation discussed above about adding 'reply' link at talk pages, it is a good implementation in my view. Gryllida\n\nI think that now it is unlikely to expect the conversion of discussion pages from wikitext into something else. There were already two attempts (Flow and Structured Discussions), and both ended not very well. I think that a much more useful and realistic direction at the moment is to improve the editing of wikitext. For example, in Russian Wikipedia there is the Convenient Discussions script (made by Jack who built the house). It seems to me that it makes sense to develop this initiative as a gadget for all projects. — putnik\n\nThanks for the link to the script! I'm reading the code now. Enterprisey (talk)\n\nEnterprisey How does it compare with yours (w:User:Enterprisey/reply-link.js)? Gryllida\n\nI don't think you can select a single comment and reply to it, but I really have no idea - I can't read Russian. That feature is a key part of reply-link. The code looks like it does more or less the same sort of stuff, but it's much more involved than reply-link, so it takes more time to read it. Enterprisey (talk)\n\nPutnik regarding that see this proposal if you haven't already.

Let me know what you think. -- DannyH (WMF) (talk)\n\nN Outside the scope of Community Tech\n\nProblem: New editors often have trouble understanding how to reply to comments on talk pages, or signing their messages, etc. Especially for editors used to the Visual editor, using talk pages and the conventions of using repeated colons is clearly confusing to new editors. We need a reply link functionality added to each comment, to make it easier for IPs and new editors to reply to comments on talk pages. While Flow was a disaster because it didn't integrate well with the current system in use, there is a much easier solution in the form of a current user script (en:User:Enterprisey/reply-link) which could be implemented globally to great effect.\n\nWho would benefit: Everyone would benefit from this proposal, as it makes talk page communication easier, even for experienced users, but new users and IPs would see the greatest benefit, and it would likely encourage more new people to start participating in discussions, which is the first step to becoming a regular editor.\n\nProposed solution: Improving en:User:Enterprisey/reply-link to the point that it is stable enough to be implemented as a Gadget (it could be turned off if people want to, but it should be defaulted as ON if expected to have any impact on new users). While defaulting it as 'ON' would require community consensus, developing it to be stable enough (with code review) is the important first step.\n\nPhabricator tickets: T207567 (not an exact match for this proposal)\n\nProposer: — Insertcleverphrasehere (or here)\n\nDiscussion\n\nWell, I was thinking of proposing/suggesting something similar but didn't get around to it - Insertcleverphrasehere. I think this can be re-framed a little clearer as a proposal to improve the reply-link script enough so that it is stable enough to be enabled as a gadget, hopefully as a default one (whether to default is a decision by the community based on how stable/useful the gadget is (and can be done by any interface-admin) not by the community tech team). Galobtter (talk)\n\n@Galobtter: Some good points. I've amended the proposal to address your comments. — Insertcleverphrasehere (or here)\n\n(e/c) :It will never be a stable solution. It's analyzing the intent of people when they wrote wikitext, so by definition there will always be a certain failure rate. Which is also why I suspect that WMF will not want to pursue this, as it will introduce something that will permanently cause failures, with no way of solving them. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nYeah I was also wondering how stable it is possible to be. I think something like 99-99.9% success rate could be good enough though - new users create far more mistakes that have to be corrected when they use raw wiki-text/have far more issues with wiki-text than that. Galobtter (talk)\n\nLemme be clear, I do not think this is a \"user facing problem\" it's a \"people will keep creating tickets for the developers for the few times where it fails and demand it gets fixed but it can never be fixed\"-problem. Generally that is something that developers try to avoid adding at all costs. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nWell, since community tech does not provide ongoing support, we wouldn't direct people to phab for fixes anyhow, and so people would be directed to a talkpage where their complaints can be safely ignored :) Galobtter (talk)\n\nI like the idea, didn't even know that the script exists. Gryllida\n\nI like this idea and also didn't know there was a script. I think it would be useful unless there is already an onboarding \"wizard\" that does this. PopularOutcast (talk)\n\n(Author of the script here) Good idea! :) I do share TheDJ's concerns about how this script is practically guaranteed to break occasionally. I haven't made up my mind over whether it impedes this idea from being implemented, though. Enterprisey (talk)\n\nEnterprisey pointed to ru:Участник:Jack_who_built_the_house/convenientDiscussions.js which works pretty similarly and was created a few months after reply-link (ping Jack who built the house). I'm curious how well that script works in actually reply/i.e if it has breaks less often. Since they seem so similar though there should be one well tested gadget for this.\n\nAnother thing; I think if we're going to be deploying to new users we should make it so that they very rarely have to use manual editing interface for replies in talk pages; one thing that would make this so is to allowing the creation of new sections with this interface. Galobtter (talk)\n\nProbably another thing would be making it work in mobile.. Galobtter (talk)\n\nHi. Unfortanutely, I haven't done the job of internationalizing the script and fixing various bugs before some very ugly things happened in Russian Wikipedia, depriving me of the will to continue the development. Still, I believe, the script is quite stable, working in most cases. Some people have reported successful usage of it outside of Russian Wikipedia, though it was initially developed based on ruwiki specifics. Jack who built the house (talk)\n\nI like the idea and can see the use, but please allow opt-out. Adding a new icon to every comment adds a lot of stuff to talk pages, and I expect many to not want that. Sure, you can always opt out via a custom script, but that is not the right approach. --mfb (talk)\n\nOr...just to get rid of that outdated style of talk page and convert to any other style used online in forums or message boards. Where replying and linking to individual comments is much more natural (and eliminating the need of ever signing or indenting again). --Gonnym (talk)\n\nOh you, talking so flowingly. --Izno (talk)\n\nAs it would be a gadget, one would be able to opt-out in preferences.

I'm sure that Enterprisey will continue working on the script in the meantime. — Insertcleverphrasehere (or here)\n\nN Outside the scope of Community Tech\n\nProblem: So far, editing/using Wikipedia or other Wikimedia Foundation projects require full usage of our visual, because of keyboard-input method. We need to find a way to expand Wikimedia Foundation project interface to be able to accommodate the visually impaired people so that they also can get the benefit of this free knowledge for mankind of Wikipedia. All of the ongoing projects/solutions can always be brought up into a newly designed Wikimedia Conference for the visually impaired (let's say annually in various places, or as part/section/sub of a bigger Wikimedia Conferences).\n\nWho would benefit: People having difficulties in their visual in using Wikipedia.\n\nProposed solution: Make Wikipedia (and other Wikimedia Foundation projects) to be visually impaired-friendly. First, for searching the articles in Wikipedia, we need to create a sound-sensitive input method so that they can easily search any article by speaking (e.g. into microphone input) and automatically convert it into wording and automatically search the related article names from it. Second, for each article, there must be a button that can be clicked (or sound activated mode) in which it will then read out all of the wordings in side one particular article to the user.\n\nMore comments: So far the closest works for this kind of project is Wiki in Audio (including Wikimedia:Spoken articles, Wikipedia:WikiProject Spoken Wikipedia, Meta:Wikisound). But what I have understood so far, those sound must be fully recorded, thus disabling the spoken voice to speak out when the article gets expanded. So, it is better to make each of the word to be spoken one by one, instead of recording a voice for the whole article continuously. Maybe a more similar approach would be like the voice button at Google Translate, in which it will speak out each word one by one.\n\nPhabricator tickets: I have no idea what this is :(\n\nProposer: Chongkian (talk)\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe Swedish Wikipedia is already working on Wikispeech. I also think that conference organising is not within the scope of this wishlist: Community_Tech#Scope. I do note the availability of Conference grants, rapid grants and project grants programs available to all those who want to organise something. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nThat's correct. Chongkian I suggest you rename this proposal to focus on the technical problem (Make Wikipedia more accessible to the visually impaired possibly). Conference organizing is not within the scope of this wishlist. Sorry. -- NKohli (WMF) (talk)\n\nOh ok, I've moved this discussion to Community Wishlist Survey 2019/Editing, without mentioning the conference parts. Maybe then the OP/bot can delete this conversation. Chongkian (talk)\n\nN Only active registered users can create proposals. Please find someone to adopt your proposal.\n\nProblem: Wikidata can only link one article per language. There are, however, cases where a single article in one language corresponds to two articles in some other language. A prototypical instance is Bonnie and Clyde, with most languages having an article about the duo Bonnie and Clyde, some having an article about Bonnie Parker, and some having an article about Clyde Barrow (see also d:WikiProject Cross Items Interwikis). The articles about the individual bank robbers cannot (at least not both) link to the many articles about the duo, which exist in many languages, so it is hard to find the corresponding articles in those other languages when coming from such a single-person article. (Other relevant situations I can think of are misfitting taxonomies; while e.g. in biology the international research community has agreed upon a common hierarchy, this is not the case in many other fields, where it might turn out to be unclear or questionable which term in another language an article should be linked to when there is no perfect match.)\n\nWho would benefit: Potentially all readers, exact number of relevant cases unknown so far\n\nProposed solution: While allowing Wikidata items to link more than one page per language is probably not a viable option, having language links as displayed in Wikipedia side-bars link to more than one article in another language should be principally possible. A language link to a language version in which more than one article is linked to the current one could, for instance, show a pop-up menu instead of directly navigating to the foreign-language article in question. More important than the GUI design for this feature would be the question where to take the target articles from. In the case of Bonnie and Clyde, a language link connecting Bonnie Parker articles (or Clyde Barrow articles, respectively) with Bonnie-and-Clyde articles could be obtained from the ‟part of” relation (d:P361). A sufficiently general solution would perhaps allow for a set of relevant Wikidata relations, to be determined by the Wikidata community, that are used to populate ‟multiple” interwiki connections of the proposed form. Even if the ability to have ‟multiple” interwiki connections is undesired, the Wikidata relations could still be used to connect articles to languages for which a direct equivalent has not yet been registered in Wikidata (either because a corresponding artcile has not yet been linked or because such a corresponding article does not yet exist).\n\nMore comments:\n\nPhabricator tickets:\n\nProposer: 78.50.250.109\n\nDiscussion\n\nProblem: The mw.toolbar was removed\n\nWho would benefit: All active authors\n\nProposed solution: Restore the toolbar\n\nMore comments:\n\nPhabricator tickets: task T30856\n\nProposer: Itti (talk)\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe following discussion is closed.\n\nUsers who endorse this proposal (you can add your name here, but please, don't use separate bullet points because this looks like voting, which doesn't happen until November 16): --JosFritz (talk) 17:41, 10 November 2018 (UTC) Itti (talk) 14:20, 6 November 2018 (UTC), Ghilt (talk) 14:43, 6 November 2018 (UTC), Mautpreller (talk) 14:47, 6 November 2018 (UTC), Atamari (talk) 14:50, 6 November 2018 (UTC), Silewe (talk) 15:03, 6 November 2018 (UTC), Bertramz (talk) 15:09, 6 November 2018 (UTC), DaB.

This modification is not helpful and should be reverted.\n\n— Itti, 6 November 2018\n\n--Itti (talk)\n\nIch unterstütze das massiv. Die Behauptung, nur eine ganz kleine Anzahl aktiver User nutze Toolbar und Sonderzeichen, ist ganz offensichtlich falsch, wie sich an einer ganzen Reihe Threads in der deutschsprachigen Wikipedia erkennen lässt. Im Gegenteil sind durchweg aktive User mit vielen Edits mit diesem Ärger konfrontiert und haben sich in starken Worten dagegen ausgesprochen. Insbesondere für die übersichtliche Sonderzeichenliste gibt es in den Einstellungen keinen vernünftigen Ersatz. Die Toolbar sollte umgehend wieder unterstützt werden.Mautpreller (talk)\n\nwo ist sie hin? --Atamari (talk)\n\nMal wieder eine tolle Leistung der WMF. --DaB. (talk)\n\nHow are we ever going to gain new authors if you anger the existing ones? --voyager (talk)\n\n[3] «« Man77 »» [de]\n\nI used that toolbar whilst writing every new article, and I want it back. There is no understandable reason for removing it. Please undo that annoying action as soon as possible. Thank you very much in advance. --Maimaid (talk)\n\nThe other toolbar (\"Erweiterte Bearbeiten-Werkzeugleiste\") is overly big, requires more clicks and is not a good replacement. --Neitram (talk)\n\nJust for context, these people are mostly coming from de:Wikipedia:Fragen_zur_Wikipedia#haben_Hamster_die_Bearbeitungssymbole_verschluckt?. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nAnd de:Wikipedia Diskussion:Kurier#Nutzer des 2006er Wikitext-Editors müssen auf eine neuere Version umsteigen. There are at least two more threads in German Wikipedia about this subject. About 95 per cent writing there don't like the toolbar removal at all.Mautpreller (talk)\n\nThat is not unsurprising. People who are not affected have no reason to contribute in such discussions ;) —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nMeaning that there are a lot of high-volume accounts who were gravely affected. Not a \"tiny fraction of editors\" or \"very few active editors\" as is untruthfully claimed here. There is a growing feeling that long-time and productive editors are literally contempted by WMF tech experts.Mautpreller (talk)\n\nDie mit der Änderung hinweggefegten de:Wikipedia:Helferlein/Extra-Editbuttons mit der Möglichkeit zur Individualisierung sind für meine Arbeit obligatorisch. So lange es keinen adäquaten Ersatz gibt, ist die Deaktivierung derselben für mich völlig unverständlich. Ich halte es für ein Muss (!), dass jeder von der Änderung betroffene User entsprechend vorab informiert und folgend einen einfachen Lösungsweg an die Hand gegeben wird. Es dürfte kein einziger (!) Autor so vor den Kopf gestoßen werden, wie es heute auf de.wp augenscheinlich einer ganzen Reihe von produktiven Accounts ging. Anders gesagt: Die Änderung ist umgehend rückgängig zu machen. --JD {æ}\n\nper Neitram. This affects the work of a good part of the most active authors in on de.wp. --Zinnmann (talk)\n\nThese people do also come from here, here, here and here. And that's just from de:WP. Most of them are very experienced users profoundly discouraged by the abrupt disappearance of their tools. They'd like this editing help, for which there is no functionally or ergonomically equivalent alternative in \"modern\" toolbars, just to be back. Whatever technical issues there might be, frustrating the few remaining, higly active editors by depriving them of their preferred tools is not the way to go. --Eloquenzministerium (talk)\n\nFor the records, the voting phase starts on November 16th. --AKlapper (WMF) (talk)\n\n@User:AKlapper (WMF): I don't care. This problem is urgent and can't wait ten days. Chaddy (talk)\n\nUser:Chaddy, wishlist items usually take, on average, a full year to be implemented. If this \"can't wait ten days\", then it can't wait until July 2019, which is the very earliest that the wishlist team would do anything about it.\n\nOn the other hand, anyone on this list, including User:Itti, could install the replacement today. Why wait for the wishlist? Whatamidoing (WMF) (talk)\n\nI've removed all the +1's as it may mislead others into thinking we're in the voting phase. Comments are most welcome but please save the mass endorsement for the voting phase which starts November 16. Thanks! MusikAnimal (WMF) (talk)\n\nI don't agree. The massive support for this community wish should remain visible, no matter whether the voting phase is opened or not.Mautpreller (talk)\n\nIs that the next move in your great strategy to get rid of highly productive authors? --voyager (talk)\n\nI entirely agree. @MusikAnimal (WMF): I would kindly ask you to immediately restore those signatures.--Hildeoc (talk)\n\nSorry about that. It is problematic because it makes it appear like a voting-style survey (which it will be on November 16), and others may start to do the same in other proposals. This should be reserved for \"discussion\", hence the heading. I did not remove anything but the +1's. Comments were retained. Thanks for your cooperation and understanding! MusikAnimal (WMF) (talk)\n\nI reverted your manipulation. That is inapprehensible! Chaddy (talk)\n\nI promise I'm not trying to obscure the support for restoring the toolbar. I am merely managing the survey, and if we see all those +1's, it's going to spread to other proposals and cause havoc. When we get to the voting phase, I'll personally restore all +1's (and make them {{support}}). Okay? :) MusikAnimal (WMF) (talk)\n\nNo, not in 10 days. This has to be visible NOW! Chaddy (talk)\n\nI'm afraid that is not how it works :( We have an established schedule and process. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated :) Managing the survey is a huge effort, and letting early voting in makes it incredibly tedious to control. Rest assured I'm not trying to hide the vast disappointment that the toolbar was removed (which Communtiy Tech had nothing to do with). MusikAnimal (WMF) (talk)\n\nI did not delete half of this page here, so I don't think I have to be told to cooperate...\n\nBut ok, then could you please just restore the deleted signatures without the \"+1\" in front of it and maybe add a short annotation, so that nobody can mix them up with votings? I think this would be a fair compromise. Chaddy (talk)\n\nSure, allow me to put something together. I'm not going to present it as individual bullet points, but we can list the usernames of those who endorse it. I'm going to do that now! Give me 10 minutes or so :) MusikAnimal (WMF) (talk)\n\nThank you! Chaddy (talk)\n\nRemoving of the small edit tool bar below the edit window is a great damage. Please undo this immediately! Chaddy (talk)\n\nMoin, ich habe eine Pingliste angelegt. Alle +1 supports finden sich dort und bekommen am 16. November eine Erinnerung. Wer noch eine Erinnerung möchte, einfach eintragen. Danke für euren Support! --Itti (talk)\n\nThe removal is a severe pain to contributers from not German speaking countries even if they are native or fluent speakers of German, since the tool bar provided Umlaute and Eszett, among others. Since I am an expat, knowledge transfer from the English speaking world to the German WP became the core of what I am doing in WP, and since I obviously don't have a German keyboard, I rely heavily on that little toolbar. --Stilfehler (talk)\n\nSorry, what is this unqualified edit? Is this next level of zensus? I am very disappointed with this edit. --2001:16B8:1180:A600:FDDE:4EBD:E6F6:29BB\n\nI've explained it above. Do not worry! The popularity of this proposal is abundantly clear. I'm going to add back all the votes once the voting phase starts :) MusikAnimal (WMF) (talk)\n\nWhich will be in ten days. But the problem is urgent and can't wait that long. Chaddy (talk)\n\nThe premature votes won't make this wish happen any sooner, on our end. Community Tech strictly goes by our schedule. For a more urgent response, you could try creating a Phabricator ticket to reach out to the responsible parties, or commenting at phab:T30856. I don't know what else to tell you :( MusikAnimal (WMF) (talk)\n\nI am deeply disturbed by the removal of a significant portion of contributions by @MusikAnimal (WMF):. Those +1 entries showed clearly, that there is a widespread dissatisfaction with the removal decision and sweeping it under the rug is grossly manipulative. Would it have been beneficial to the readability of the debate if every one of them had basically said the same in his own words? Yes, we are not in the voting phase, but neither are we in a phase where it is appropriate to remove the opinions of a significant number of authors opposing this misguided WMF-decision.\n\nNot just a bit infuriated --Eloquenzministerium (talk)\n\nThis section is called \"Discussion\". I don't see how writing \"+1\" discusses the proposal. --AKlapper (WMF) (talk)\n\nReally? Since when do you use the internet? Chaddy (talk)\n\nMy point was that I don't see a \"discussion\" when people repeatedly only write \"+1\". Your question seems to be unrelated to the topic. --AKlapper (WMF) (talk)\n\nBut it is. Using \"+1\" is a normal behavior in internet slang to express approval. You can interpret it as an abbreviation for \"I agree\" or \"Yes, this is also my opinion\" or else. Thus it is often more than just a voting. Chaddy (talk)\n\nThe foundation is trying to make another big mistake like the image filter. Get back the tool bars back immediatly. Just undo the latest change. Dont wait. You have not asked us before, you have not warned the users, you just behave like Donald. --Eingangskontrolle (talk)\n\nAs I previously explained, the +1 contributions are contributions, not votes, avoiding to clutter the discussion needlessly with basically the same text over and over. Should you not add them back, do you really believe that a mass message to those, whose voices have just been cut out, explaining what happened here and inviting them to further elaborate on their point of view would be a desirable course of action? --Eloquenzministerium (talk)\n\nI feel like you all might be mislead into thinking the +1's will make this happen sooner. Going by our schedule, Community Tech can't do anything until the survey is over. We were not involved with removing the toolbar, and we are not trying to censor your frustration. A request for a more urgent response should be made on Phabricator, or perhaps just comment at phab:T30856. MusikAnimal (WMF) (talk)\n\nWhere can you provide ‘−1’? It would be extremely unfortunate to force Community Tech team to work on supporting an extremely old and unnecessary editing interface just to appease some German contributors. This is, frankly, not a matter for Community Wishlist Survey. stjn[ru]\n\nOur team still needs to discuss, so I can't say for sure, but if we do get to this, it'd likely be creating a gadget or something similar to accomplish the same functionality (with full community consultation to make sure it meets their needs). But again we can't do it until the survey is over. Everyone here seems to want this back now, so in that sense maybe the Survey isn't the right place. MusikAnimal (WMF) (talk)\n\nAre we talking about the same thing? mw.toolbar CharInsert What people are asking to have installed (top of the editing window) What people seem to want (usually underneath the editing window)\n\nI think we need to be clear about what we're talking about. If dewiki has a bug that's hiding CharInsert, then bringing back mw.toolbar is not going to do what you want.\n\nWhatamidoing (WMF) (talk)\n\nMoin, yes, both. I made a fix, a few minutes ago, so the bottom list is more or less back, but that is not realy good. A lot of editors need this help and it would be great, if you coult improve this. Thanks! --Itti (talk)\n\nThanks for fixing the CharInsert bug for dewiki. If you want the blue-gray toolbar, too, why don't you "
