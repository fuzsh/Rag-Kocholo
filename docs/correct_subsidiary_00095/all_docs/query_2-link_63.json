        "text": "An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters, e.g. PIPE, by using each letter exactly once in the new word or phrase. An anagram is basically a play on words, often with a comedic or satiric intent. The letters of many words or phrases, including PIPE, can be rearranged to form an anagram. Sometimes a talented writer will purposefully use an anagram to make some sort of commentary. Anagrams are meant to be clever, witty, catchy and playful. We encourage you to use all the anagram finders on Anagrammer to break down PIPE into its parts and find hidden plays on this word."
