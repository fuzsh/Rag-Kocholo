He has a proven track record of turning technologies that are difficult to build into successful businesses, selling three companies for more than $425 million. His specialty is conceptualizing, developing and executing on early stage business plans that lead to the creation of new product categories. Ameesh loves to mentor young startups through his incubation venture called Incarta, LP., helping secure seed funding for them and providing guidance for go-to-market strategy, operations and business development.\n\nBefore Baffle, Ameesh was the President and CEO at Lightwire, Inc. Lightwire is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the silicon photonics space. During his tenure, the company transitioned from the technology development phase to the product development phase. He drove a strategic partnership with Cisco Systems, Inc. that eventually resulted in an acquisition for $271 million in February 2012.\n\nIn 2001, Ameesh co-founded Aarohi Communications, a pioneer in the storage virtualization space. Over the course of 5 years as President and CEO, he built the management team, established customer relationships with Intel, EMC, Infineon and McDATA and drove its product strategy. Aarohi was acquired by Emulex Corporation in Costa Mesa, CA in May 2006 leading to the Intelligent Network Products business unit where he served as Senior Vice President and General Manager from May 2006 to September of 2008.\n\nPrior to Aarohi, he founded PipeLinks, Inc. in July 1996 and served as its Chief Technology Officer, where he was responsible for developing the Integrated SONET/SDH Router product from concept to technology implementation. Cisco acquired PipeLinks in December 1998 for $126 million as its first acquisition in the optical space and created the Optical Transport Business Unit.\n\nAmeesh arrived in the US from India to pursue a M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of California at Irvine in 1989, where his area of concentration was performance analysis of communication networks working with Prof. Audrey Viterbi as his advisor. He interned at Rockwell Communications in Irvine in the summer of 1988 before graduating in 1989. He worked as a communications network design engineer and architect at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) followed by 3Com for 7 years before embarking on his entrepreneurial journey.\n\nDr. Fernando Miralles-Wilhelm is a hydrologist with research interests in modeling of surface and groundwater systems, climate-hydrology-vegetation interactions, water quality and modeling of the water-energy-food nexus. He has been a Principal Investigator in research sponsored by NASA, NOAA, NSF, USDA, USAID, the World Bank and other agencies, and has worked as a consultant in water resources projects in all five continents for over 20 years.\n\nHe is currently Chair and Professor of the Dept. of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science at the University of Maryland (UMD), where he also directs the Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center. Prior to his appointment at UMD, he served on the faculty at Northeastern University, the University of Miami, and Florida International University. He also spent 5 years as a civil servant in the Water and Sanitation Division of the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington DC.\n\nFernando is a Fellow of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), and a Diplomate of the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and the American Academy of Water Resources Engineers. He is a registered Professional Engineer in the states of Massachusetts and Florida.\n\nFernando earned a MS degree in the (then) Dept. of Mechanical Engineering at UCI, working with Prof. William A. Sirignano as his advisor. Prof. Roger Rangel also co-supervised his thesis research, and other members of his thesis committee were Profs. Derek Dunn-Rankin and Dimitri Papamouschou. He also took excellent classes with Profs. Said Elghobashi and Scott Samuelsen. He was a classmate and played baseball in summer with (then graduate student) Prof. Jake Brouwer. He remembers all of them very fondly.\n\nFernando lives in Bethesda MD with his wife Monica, and is the father of two girls (Andrea, now a graduate student and Adriana, class of ’20, both at UMD). On nice sunny days, you will most likely find him playing tennis at NASA Goddard, or on the Capital Crescent Trail on his running shoes, his bike, roller blades or his Sector 9 longboard.\n\nJohn Lenell is currently Chief Executive Office of Irvine based early stage technology startup Qxonix Inc. Prior to co-founding Qxonix Inc., John focused on private capital investments and advisor roles in early stage startups.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2016, John enjoyed a 20-year career at Broadcom Corporation, beginning as a startup team member. While at Broadcom, John lead new product development teams for Broadcom’s first ethernet repeater, switch, ethernet controller, and hard disk drive controller achieving many industry's first milestones. As senior technical director, John was instrumental in the team development and growth of what became the Enterprise Networking Business Unit from pre-revenue to multi-billion annual revenues and the dominant industry position in network communication devices. John transitioned from product development roles to a position as Senior Director of strategic investments and facilitated the acquisition and integration of Provigent and Netlogic Microsystems for Broadcom.\n\nImmediately following graduation from UCI in 1992 with a master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, John began his career at Standard Microsystems as a chip design engineer. John credits his experience in graduate school with advisor Professor Nader Bagherzadeh, working with a small team to develop and have fabricated a processor device, for his successful career at Standard Microsystems and Broadcom working with small teams on leading technology.\n\nWhile at UCI, John was a member of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity and the Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society. He also served as a research assistant and a teaching assistant during his time as a graduate student.\n\nJohn and his wife Rachel reside in Newport Beach and together have four adult children.
