        "text": "Cisco\n\nSystems, Inc. is the global leader in networking for the Internet. The company is today\n\nthe world’s biggest Internet commerce site, selling more than $20 million products\n\nevery day. Its products include routers, LAN and ATM switches, dial-up access servers, and\n\nnetwork management software. The products, integrated by the Cisco IOS software, link\n\ngeographically dispersed LANs, WANs and IBM networks. Cisco provides end-to-end networking\n\nsolutions that customers use to build a unified information infrastructure of their own,\n\nor to connect to someone else’s network. Cisco IOS software provides network services\n\nand enables networked applications besides offering technical support and professional\n\nservices to maintain and optimize network operations. The company with its headquarters in\n\nSan Jose, California, sells its products in approximately 115 countries through a direct\n\nsales force, distributors, value-added resellers and systems integrators. It has major\n\noffices in The US apart from more than 210 sale face=\"Times New Roman\">s and support offices in 54 countries.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nIt is Cisco’s policy not to take a\n\nrigid approach that favours one technology over the alternatives. The company believes in\n\nlistening to customers’ requests, monitoring all alternatives technological, and\n\nproviding customers with a range of options to make a choice. Strategically planned\n\nacquisitions and mergers have enabled Cisco to offer such technology alternatives and also\n\nto develop products and solutions around widely accepted industry standards. The company\n\nhas grown into a global market leader and holds number one or number two position in\n\nvirtually every market segment it participates in. Since becoming a public company in\n\n1990, Cisco’s annual revenues have increased from $69 million in that year to $8.46\n\nbillion in 1998. And, as measured by market capitalization, The company is the third\n\nlargest company listed on NASDAQ and among the top 40 in the world. Let’s start on a\n\nbackward journey to take a look at each of its successful acquisitions one-by-one upto the\n\nend of 1997.\n\nface=\"Arial\" size=\"3\" color=\"#FFFFFF\">Cisco’s Acquisition in 1998-1999 SIZE=\"2\">\n\nCompany Area of Operation\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAmteva Technologies IP-based unified\n\ncommunications middleware GeoTel Communications Data applications for\n\nPBXs and call centres Sentient Networks ATM Circuit Emulation\n\nServices (CES) gateway\n\nAdvertisment\n\nFibex Systems Integrated Access\n\nDigital Loop Carrier (IADLC) products PipeLinks SONET/SDH routers Selsius IP-based PBXs\n\nAdvertisment\n\nClarity Wireless computer\n\nnetworks American Internet Corp.\n\n(AIC) Software solution for IP\n\naddressing SummaFour Programmable switches\n\nAdvertisment\n\nClass Data Systems Network resource\n\nallocation Precept software Multimedia networking\n\nsoftware NetSpeed Broadband remote access\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWheel Group Intrusion detection and\n\nsecurity scanning\n\nA for acquisitions and A for April. Yes,\n\nApril ’99 was indeed a month of acquisitions for Cisco. During that month, Cisco\n\nacquired Amteva Technologies, GeoTel Communications, Sentient Networks and Fibex Systems.\n\nAmteva provides IP-based unified communications middleware that consolidates voicemail,\n\ne-mail, and fax on a single IP network; accessible independent of location, time or\n\ndevice. Unified communications, as a set of key value-added applications, showcases the\n\nadvantages of a converged data/voice/video network infrastructure and is important all\n\nacross the customer base–service providers, enterprise, and small and medium\n\nbusiness.\n\nThe GeoTel software solutions integrates\n\nenterprise data applications with voice infrastructure devices such as PBXs to deliver\n\nintegrated data and voice to call centres over an Internet infrastructure and the PSTN.\n\nThis acquisition enhances the strategy to create an open data and voice software\n\ninfrastructure. GeoTel allows Cisco to accelerate the development of applications on the\n\nCisco packet voice architecture by providing a call centre infrastructure on which\n\ncompanies like Oracle, SAP, Siebel, Vantive, etc., can build enterprise and service\n\nprovider applications.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSentient Networks has developed the\n\nindustry’s highest density ATM Circuit Emulation Services (CES) gateway, which is\n\ncapable of transporting circuit-based private line services across packet-based ATM\n\nnetworks. By delivering technology that allows service providers to combine their\n\ncircuit-based equipment with Internet-based data, voice and video gear, this acquisition\n\nwill help service providers migrate to cell and packet-based networks. Fibex Systems is a\n\npioneer in Integrated Access Digital Loop Carrier (IADLC) products–devices that\n\ncombine traditional voice services with data services using ATM as the underlying\n\narchitecture. The acquisition helps service providers’ transition from voice/data\n\ntraffic to cell/packet networks while maintaining traditional phone business using\n\nexisting circuit infrastructure.\n\nIn December 1998 Cisco acquired\n\nPipeLinks–a pioneer in (Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy)\n\nSONET/SDH routers capable of simultaneously transporting circuit-based traffic and routing\n\nIP traffic. This acquisition was to enable Cisco’s service provider customers to\n\ntransition to the New World while utilizing their existing SONET/SDH infrastructure.\n\nOctober 1998 saw Selsius Systems coming into the Cisco fold. Selsius is a leading supplier\n\nof network PBX systems for high-quality telephony over IP network. Selsius’\n\ntechnology enables Cisco to accelerate the transition from conventional, proprietary\n\ncircuit-switched PBXs to multi-service, open LAN systems capable of enabling the next step\n\nin data/voice integration. On 15 September 1998 Cisco Systems, Inc. announced a definitive\n\nagreement to acquire privately-held Clarity Wireless of Belmont, California. Clarity is a\n\nleading developer of wireless communication technology for computer networking and\n\nInternet service markets. This acquisition provides Cisco with fixed wireless technology,\n\nwhich complements Cisco’s current last mile solutions including dial, xDSL, and\n\ncable. Last mile technologies can be divided into two areas– narrow-band (dial) and\n\nbroadband (xDSL, cable and wireless)–which enables the integration of voice, data,\n\nand video. Clarity’s technology is the first to provide high-speed, reliable\n\noperation in obstructed environments, which have traditionally been challenging to\n\nwireless network communications. In August 1999 Cisco acquired American Internet Corp.\n\n(AIC)–a leading provider of software solutions for IP address management and Internet\n\naccess. Building upon an existing OEM agreement with Cisco, the acquisition enables Cisco\n\nto extend AIC’s technology into other areas including the service provider line of\n\nbusiness. July 1998 saw SummaFour–a leading provider of programmable switches walk\n\ninto the Cisco fold. SummaFour’s open standards-based programmable switches enable\n\nCisco to offer value-added telephony applications to new and existing service provides as\n\nwell as extending these services to a voice-over-IP infrastructure. In May that year, the\n\ntake-over of Class Data Systems enabled Cisco to give network managers the ability to\n\nallocate network resources according to company policies and priorities. Such control\n\ncapabilities mean business-critical applications are assured timely, as well as\n\nhigh-quality network transport.In March 1998 Cisco signed a definitive\n\nagreement to acquire privately-held Precept Software of Palo Alto, California. Precept is\n\na leading multimedia networking software company. The acquisition complements Cisco’s\n\nstrategy of developing networking solutions that integrate voice, data, and video traffic.\n\nPrecept’s IP/TV product is a client/server application that sends live or\n\npre-recorded digital video and audio to a large number of users over any IP-based local or\n\nwide area network.\n\nNetSpeed’s product suite added\n\ncustomer premise equipment, central office products and broadband remote access to\n\nCisco’s DSL product portfolio in the same month that year. Its DSL products are\n\ndeployed in production carrier networks including Cincinnati Bell, Telus, and US West.\n\nNetSpeed’s DSL product line for North America complements Cisco’s 1997\n\nacquisition of DSL solutions from the Dagaz business of Integrated Network Corp. targeted\n\nat international markets. February 1998 saw WheelGroup’s software technology extend\n\nCisco’s leadership in end-to-end network security solutions and help create a more\n\nsecure environment for Cisco customers to do business on the Internet. WheelGroup is a\n\nleader in intrusion detection and security scanning software products. Its technology\n\ndelivers a ‘radar-like’ intrusion detection system that operates with network\n\nrouters and switches as real-time \"sensors\" to identify and respond to\n\nunauthorized intrusion and hackers. WheelGroup’s scanning technology identifies\n\nnetwork security gaps throughout the enterprise and offers solutions for closing them.\n\nThis new class of detection and scanning technology will be referred to as \"active\n\naudit\" by Cisco.\n\nWay back in December 1997, Cisco’s\n\ndecision to acquire LighSpeed’s voice signalling technologies enabled the company to\n\nprovide solutions in both the enterprise and service provider markets as voice traffic\n\ntransitions from purely circuit switched networks to integrated circuit and packet/cell\n\nswitched networks. LighSpeed has developed leading-edge voice protocol conversion and\n\nintelligent call control software which enables signalling to be transmitted among diverse\n\nsets of voice protocols and applications. This technology allows different phone and\n\ncommunications systems to work together in a seamless fashion, lowering communication\n\ncosts for both business and consumers.\n\nIn July 1997 Cisco signed a definitive\n\nagreement to purchase the Dagaz xDSL business of Integrated Network Corp. INC, based in\n\nBridgewater, New Jersey, is a broadband networking company providing a suite of products\n\nfor high speed information transmission over existing copper phone lines. Cisco will\n\nacquire INC’s Dagaz xDSL products and intellectual property, personnel, and other\n\nx-DSL-related assets. The purchase of the Dagaz business, combined with Cisco’s xDSL\n\ninternal development, will give users a new carrier compliant fast lane on their networks.\n\nIn June 1997 Cisco acquired privately held\n\nArdent Communications. The San Jose-based Ardent is a pioneer in designing combined\n\ncommunications support for compressed voice, LAN, data and video traffic across public and\n\nprivate Frame Relay and ATM networks. The acquisition of Ardent will complement\n\nCisco’s 3,800 series within carrier service offerings for branch offices and remote\n\nsites by extending leadership in integration of voice, video and data. In the same month\n\nCisco Systems family had a new member, i.e., Global Internet Software Group—a wholly\n\nowned subsidiary of Global Internet.Com based in Palo Alto, California. Global Internet\n\nSoftware is a pioneer in the Windows NT network security market-place. To complement\n\nCisco’s enterprise-class PIX firewall, Global Internet Software and its Centri\n\nSecurity Manager Windows NT firewall is designed to meet the turnkey needs of small and\n\nmedium businesses that are often without security engineers to design, build and support\n\ntheir networks offerings. In June 1997, Cisco announced a definitive agreement to acquire\n\nprivately held Skystone Systems Corp. of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Skystone is an innovator\n\nof high-speed SONET/SDH technology. SONET/SDH is the emerging transport technology used\n\nfor carrying information in very high-capacity backbone networks, such as those operated\n\nby telecommunications carriers and large ISPs. Cisco intends to leverage Skystone\n\ndevelopment efforts on new SONET/SDH transport technologies for integration within\n\nnext-generation Cisco products.\n\nIn March 1997 it acquired Telesend, a\n\nprivately held company specializing in WAN access products in a stock swap in which shares\n\nof Cisco stock were exchanged for all outstanding shares and options of Telesend. By this\n\nacquisition, Cisco announced a new channel unit for D4 DSL Frame Muxes—the Cisco 90i.\n\nCisco 90i provides telecommunications carriers with a more cost-effective way to deliver\n\nhigh-speed data services for the Internet and intranet access applications. The resulting\n\nservice is ideal for small business users, telecommuters and residential Internet access."
