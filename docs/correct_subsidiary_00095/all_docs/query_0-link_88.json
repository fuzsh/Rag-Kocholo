        "text": "Carl Russo, Cerent’s dynamic CEO, introduced a crisp marketing focus to the company and amped up the product focus even more so than Cerent’s first leader, Mike Hatfield. Carl had double duty too – running the company as well as managing the expectations of Cerent’s board chairman, Vinod Khosla, who sought a rapid valuation of his investments and a profitable exit strategy. Carl was chosen as his disciple to take them to the promised land of riches, and do battle with the oppressive telecom-vendor pharaohs.\n\nIn earlier BLOG posts we talked about Carl’s views on leadership [1], on perception management [2], and product-market fit [3]. Much of this philosophy he exported to his later, long-term gig at Calix. Complementing his views was a fierce competitiveness.\n\n​The Battle of 1999\n\nCarl came to Cerent with the objective of driving the revenue line in order to go public or position the company to be acquired. This set up a battle in the telecom industry between upstart startups, such as Cerent (and others of its ilk), and the established suppliers of telecom equipment – Nortel Networks, Lucent, Fujitsu, and Alcatel.\n\nLike the biblical story of David and Goliath, the startup Davids were forced to eventually take on Goliath.\n\nInitially, Cerent flew “under the radar” and the marketing team of Terry Brown and yours truly (Rob Koslowsky) sought to differentiate Cerent from the legacy SONET vendors, who Carl would come to call the “evil oligopoly.”\n\n​Cerent’s first targets were the small independent telephone companies requiring solutions of two, three, or four sites of equipment. None of the large equipment suppliers even noticed losing these small skirmishes in the war over SONET equipment sales. Lucent was particularly blind to this customer segment, delegating sales support to its authorized distributors. However, with wins over its larger rivals in 1999 across the ALLTEL landscape, displacing Nortel in Triangle Telephone, and an impressive announcement with Williams [4], the big guys could not help but take Cerent seriously.\n\nCarl Listens\n\nCarl worked closely with us in marketing and sales, and he listened intently as we described the access market, the broadband market, and the long-haul market. Carl, a newcomer to the telecom sector, recognized that the Cerent 454 was more of a transport vehicle and that it fit very well into metropolitan optical transport markets.\n\nAjaib Bhadare remembers our marketing team’s contributions, “Once we had drawn that transport space, we started to promote the box fitting into transport and so we identified the market space and then we claimed that we were the first and the better product to fit into it. That was a brilliant marketing strategy.”\n\nIn a competitive market place, it’s about “us” versus “them.” Carl binned our larger rivals as the evil oligopoly [5]. He colorfully painted the picture of them as bad and us as good. In one of his many all-employee “Cerent-foyer-meetings” Carl chose to pick on Nortel, making a mockery of Nortel’s ability to compete and bring a “like product” to market. Nothing could touch the Cerent 454 in terms of value or functionality. It turns out, Carl was right.\n\nOn the flip side of the evil oligopoly, some economists feel that oligopolies (and monopolies) perform a social good by limiting competition and thereby avoiding competitive battles that often destroy more wealth than they create. Joseph Schumpeter and his concept of creative destruction outlined this notion in his 1942 book, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy. Many believe this notion is not applicable in today’s disaggregated structure led by arbitrage-oriented firms [6]. Carl did not believe it and referred to oligopolistic behavior as evil.\n\n[1] In a past BLOG on leadership, I wrote, “Carl [Russo] remains a believer in establishing culture, creating the strategy, and then hiring the right talent so that execution becomes possible. He noted in 2013, ‘We want the employees talking about the strategy, what are we doing, what does the market look like, how are we going to get there, then back to the strategy, what are we doing, over and over and over.’”\n\n[2] “In a previous BLOG post, I wrote, “The perception roadmap describes where you want to be. It’s all about messaging ahead of where you are and making the promise of what you’re ultimately going to deliver. Part of the balancing act is not to look too far ahead though. Milestones have to be met so progress can be demonstrated. This, in turn, establishes credibility that the next target on the roadmap will be hit. Only a great product with an engineering team that executes on the product roadmap is able to string a wire for the perception cartographers to walk.”\n\n[3] Carl was an advocate of product-market fit and a key element of Cerent’s communication focus became product positioning. The key attributes of how the Cerent 454 fit the optical transport market were clearly developed and articulated to the target audience of network planners, engineers, and operations personnel within the service provider (telecom) ecosystem.\n\n[4] One of Cerent’s largest customers, Williams, recognized the focus of the Cerent team, a group of people not distracted by rumors of its possible IPO or takeover during mid-1999. Wayne Price, Williams CTO, at the time, said, “It was obvious to me that these guys were building a company and not just trying to cash in on the Internet hype to get rich.”\n\n[5] An oligopoly is a market structure in which a small number of firms have the majority of the market share in the marketplace. From another point of view, an oligopoly is similar to a monopoly, except that rather than one firm dominating the market, two or more firms dominate the market. In the optical transport sector, the oligopoly comprised Lucent, Nortel, Fujitsu, and Alcatel, and, to some degree, Tellabs.\n\nAT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile form an oligopoly in the wireless market in terms of service provider choices across America.

Increasingly, these firms view development of new technologies and new products, rather than an investment in the future, as no more than an unnecessary and probably unwise cost.”\n\n​Cisco Systems’ 2001 annual report included a “Conversation with Cisco Management” about the difficult year 2001 turned out to be for the Internet giant.\n\nJohn Chambers described his company’s previous organizational structure as seen from 2001:\n\n“Our line of business structure served us well over the last four and a half years [from 1997 to 2001] as we grew from $6 billion in revenue to over $22 billion. However, we were beginning to experience product overlap and were less effective in sharing both resources and innovations across our broad engineering organization than I would have liked.”\n\nOn John Chambers’ outlook for the 2001 organizational structure [1] featuring technology silos:\n\n“We moved to a structure that optimizes Cisco's ability to deliver a seamless Network of Networks. With this new organization, our three customer segments remain key to our future success, and will remain the core focus throughout our company.”\n\nJohn Chambers changed the company’s organizational structure from customer-centric to technology-centric in August 2001. The ‘Optical’ technology sector was led by Jayshree Ullal, who replaced Carl Russo as the leader of the ‘Optical Networking Group.’\n\n​​John returned to this theme of the Network of Networks in the 2004 Annual Report. Until then, he established three business councils for each customer segment – Enterprise, Service Provider, and Commercial. Each customer grouping was led by an experienced senior vice president to ensure focus was maintained.\n\nHe explained, in 2001, “Moving forward, I fully expect that our enterprise and service provider businesses will fluctuate on a yearly and industry trend basis as we have experienced over the last several years. What is difficult to forecast is the degree to which our enterprise customers will build their own networks, or outsource their needs to a service provider. Regardless of the balance, I believe Cisco is in a position to provide both solutions. Our goal is to be the number-one market player in all three segments as they move toward integrated data, voice, and video networks.\n\nJames Richardson described how Cisco maintains its entrepreneurial spirit:\n\n“Innovation, entrepreneurial spirit, and taking calculated business risks have always been hallmarks of the Cisco culture.”\n\nIn the years leading up to 2002, most of the risk takers were entrepreneurs acquired from both successful (e.g., Cerent in optical transport) and failed (e.g., Qeyton Systems in Metropolitan WDM) startups. Cisco did a commendable job in retaining the engineering talent from these startups.\n\n​\n\n​James adds, “We continue to cherish and reward innovators within the company. Cisco's Distinguished Engineer, Cisco Fellow, and Pioneer Technology Award programs promote the entrepreneurial spirit that has been at the root of our company's success.”\n\nExamples of these “motivated” recipients include Paul Elliott, who became one of Cisco’s distinguished engineers in 2000 [2], although, after his Cerent options vested, Paul left Cisco as a multi-millionaire in 2001. As far as the Pioneer Technology Award program went, Jayshree Ullal lobbied hard for the optical transport team (primarily the Cerent folks) to be considered for the award. The ONS 15454 (formerly the Cerent 454) was a 2002 finalist for the Pioneer Technology Award, but not the winner [3].\n\nJames notes, “The Distinguished Engineer and Cisco Fellow programs were developed as a way of recognizing the contributions of key technical employees and allowing them to set and influence the company's technical direction, while encouraging them to communicate those developments to the industry at large . . . The Pioneer Technology Award program recognizes the contributions of engineering teams that drive the development of innovative products and core technologies to a new level of excellence.”\n\nAll of these Cisco internal awards were excellent engineering motivators.\n\n[1] Cisco’s 2001 reorganization was studied by many in academia. In one such study the authors “illustrate the notion of compensatory fit through an in depth discussion of a reorganization that occurred in 2001 at Cisco Systems, which appeared to have helped this company renew its capability base in order to pursue the cost-differentiation duality. We then revisit the ideas described in the illustration of the Cisco reorganization in a more rigorous and general theoretical framework.”\n\n[2] Paul Elliott was Cerent’s second employee, hired by Ajaib Bhadare. He told me during our 2013 interview, “Ajaib and I had been talking and wanting to do something different for a couple of years. DSC was treating me well and I really had no complaints . . .” but Paul couldn’t resist the allure of startup Fiberlane, which would soon splinter, with the Petaluma team members forming startup Cerent.\n\n[3] On the Pioneer Technology Program, Jayshree told me, “[The statue the ONS 15454 team received] says, ‘Pioneer Finalist in 2002.’ We didn’t get the award, but we got the finalist recognition, but I asked them to make a special one for us as a finalist. That [recognition] was huge. Too often the bigger company [Cisco] when they are swallowing the small company [Cerent] forgets the emotions and pride aspect. They think, oh yeah, they made a lot of money and that’s it. Money is a necessary but not sufficient condition for long-term health. Most of us do this for passion. There was a pride in the journey and a desire to go to the next phase of the journey.”\n\n​In a recent BLOG post, we pointed out that Cisco’s acquisition frenzy was stopped cold by 2001. Once favorable external factors became unfriendly as the concurrent dot.com bust and telecom meltdown led to a precipitous drop in business.\n\nThe rapid downturn forced John Chambers’ management team to make their “first time ever” cuts in its direct payroll. Over a two-year period, almost 4,000 full-time employees were released [1]. Particularly shocking about this layoff was the fact that Cisco’s full-time (or core) employees were apparently NOT totally insulated by scores of temporary workers that should’ve taken the brunt of the firings.\n\n​\n\nThe downturn was so massive in its scope that it reached the very heart of the Cisco faithful. An InfoEdge case study revealed that in Cisco’s manufacturing team employed only one full-time employee for every six part-time workers. While the numbers reveal that “only” ten percent of Cisco employees were severely impacted, the part time ranks supporting the Internet giant were decimated.\n\n​Cisco’s Troubles But a Symptom of the Telecom Flu of 2001\n\nCompanies took the opportunity to slash investments, made during the acquisition-and-develop boom of the late 1990s, that hadn’t borne fruit. These included Ciena’s $474 million purchase of Omnia in July 1999 [2] and Redback’s $4.3 billion acquisition of Siara in March 2000.\n\nCiena had already made the decision to shutter its newly acquired EdgeDirector product line from Omnia. It was based on ATM technology, which just wasn’t where the industry was headed, especially after service providers began to adopt Ethernet/IP solutions in the access segment. The industry downturn sealed the fate of ATM as a technology solution and froze out ATM-based products like those from Omnia.\n\nRedback’s stock price fell to a 52-week low at $3.85 on August 28, 2001, down from a 52-week high of $171.13 just under a year before, on September 29, 2000. The company was hoping to shake things up and restore its good fortunes by hiring former Cisco executive Kevin DeNuccio [4], who joined Redback on August 29th.\n\nAnd then 9/11 Eve – Cisco’s Reorganization\n\nFiber Optic News (FON) reported on the recent Cisco reorganization, just one day before 9/11. Speculation was rampant in the fall of 2001 that Carl Russo, Cisco group vice president of optical networking, “may be on his way out either voluntarily or involuntarily.” FON added, “Given the chance to respond to that scenario, Cisco spokeswoman Jill Martin said the company will not comment on rumors and speculation . . . Russo previously reported to [the recently departed Kevin] Kennedy, and now reports to Jayshree Ullal.”\n\nCisco sought to reinvent itself as the layoffs began in 2001. The company’s reworked engineering organization was structured into eleven new technology groups, with its marketing effort concentrating on describing Cisco’s technology differentiation to the marketplace.\n\nFON sought the advice of Wall Street analyst and ten-year telecom follower Ariane Mahler of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. She didn’t think Cisco’s reorganization would ignite much business, arguing, “They are trying to reinvent themselves. They had this big reorganization announcement which I don’t think is really much of an announcement at all.” Continuing to be brutally candid, Mahler adds, “They weren’t doing well in the service provider market, and with this reorganization, I think they have even less of a chance in that market.”\n\nCerent Success Debated\n\nContrary to Jayshree Ullal’s view that Cerent was an overwhelming success for Cisco (from the vantage point of 2013 hindsight), in late 2001, Doug Green, previously an executive with Chromatis, pointed out that many acquisitions, including his own by Lucent, were a flop, as described above. FON reported on Green’s feelings on September 10, 2001, “Even acquisitions that seem to be strong, such as Cisco’s $6.9 billion acquisition of Cerent in Aug. 1999, might not be quite what they seem . . . If you look at that [Cerent] product, they paid almost $7 billion for it, and they probably brought in $2 billion of revenue.”\n\nDoug Green concludes, “Even though that’s a great success story [3], has it really paid off in terms of return on investment? I don’t know that anybody did a great job of M&A over the last two years. People were just thinking they had to get in the game and were flying blindly in most cases.”\n\nThen 9/11\n\nI suspect no one read the above referenced telecom stories on September 11th of 2001. The world was shocked as the people of the United States experienced a horrific terror attack. One of Cisco’s own, Suzanne Calley, was killed by suicidal jihadists. She was a passenger on the doomed American Airlines flight 77; a flight that targeted and then struck part of the Pentagon.\n\nAA 77 struck the Pentagon. Here, first responders are dousing the flames. Image courtesy FBI.\n\n​Recovery and Redemption in Cisco’s FY2002\n\n“The year 2002 marked an uptick in Cisco optical,” I wrote in 2015, “in spite of the economic downturn felt by the disastrous economic effects of the dot.com bust and the telecom meltdown. Cisco weathered the initial storm reasonably well with strong financial results posted for the quarterly period ending April 27, 2002 with a GAAP net income of $729 million, up almost 11 percent from the previous quarter. Cisco remained in the black for its fiscal year 2002, leaving it a “relative wealth in resources to compete against financially troubled competitors like Lucent and Nortel.”\n\n[1] The full-time employee rolls dropped from 38,402 employees down to 34,446 during 2001 and 2002. The 3,956 released employees represented ten percent of Cisco’s total headcount.\n\n[2] On the same day in March 1999 that Ciena acquired Lightera, its most successful pick-up, Ciena also acquired Marlborough, Massachusetts-based Omnia for another, almost half-a-billion dollars. This carrier-class multi-service access platform did not fair well in the marketplace. It, and its product contributions, were omitted from Ciena’s glossy brochure recounting the history of the company.\n\n[3] Kevin DeNuccio, my boss’s boss starting in late 1999, spent six years at Cisco, where he served as senior vice president of worldwide service provider operations. As chief salesman, he likely left as sales at Cisco all but evaporated during Cisco’s fiscal year 2001.\n\n[4] Certainly not as charitable as Jayshree in hindsight, Doug from a 2001 perspective may have been internalizing sour grapes as first, his technology bet on metropolitan WDM with Chromatis, and second, its subsequent acquisition by Lucent crashed and burned. How could he not say that Cerent was success with a billion dollar run rate in sales? “As it turned out,” I wrote in a previous BLOG post, “Chromatis had misread the optical transport market on a number of fronts: Metro DWDM was not the fast-growing segment, hundreds of millions of dollars in the sales pipeline was a myth, and Metro DWDM did not offer a cost-effective alternative to next generation SONET. On top of that, Lucent reached a point where it’s business downturn forced the company to prune its product mix and focus on the needs of its thirty largest customers. Chromatis bit the dust in August 2001, after just being acquired in May 2000 – a $4.5 billion mistake.”\n\n​Adam Smith in his famous work, The Wealth of Nations (1776) [1], talked about various ways to generate wealth by exploiting divisions of labor.\n\nCisco chose to exploit divisions of labor by using the manufacturing capacity of others beginning in the 1990s, and then, by exploiting lower wages for engineers in other countries at the outset of the 2000s. India was one such country where significantly reduced employee wages could be had [2]. Both moves – offloading manufacturing and outsourcing human talent – Cisco believed, would continue to generate profits, boost company valuation, and produce “Smithian” wealth for its ventures.\n\nThe Cisco Choices\n\nCisco’s focus has NOT been on making things, but on using others (e.g. contract manufacturers) to make things for the company. Cisco’s focus has NOT been on people, but on the numbers game of how many people were needed in engineering and at what cost to the company. It was a dance the company executed brilliantly in the firing and hiring of human resources and the rationale for where those next hires would physically reside.\n\nCisco couldn’t easily fire people in Italy, for example, so the optical Monza facility (from its Pirelli acquisition, in 2000) stayed around [3], while startup Cerent’s hometown, Petaluma, was abandoned as soon as Cisco could afford to leave that small North Bay town.\n\nCut Engineering Costs by Cutting American Engineers\n\nLike other companies of the 1990s who discovered cheap engineering labor elsewhere, Cisco sought lower cost engineering talent in India and shed the higher cost of engineers located in Silicon Valley and Telecom Valley. It became worth competing for the best resources outside of America in foreign markets owing to the “three-times the price tag” for an engineer in San Jose versus one in a foreign country.\n\n​Gary Baldwin, Cerent’s director of software development, remained for a number of years after the Cisco acquisition. His role expanded and he supported Jayshree Ullal in the Optical Technology Group that remained after the massive Cisco reorganization of 2001. With respect to staffing Cisco’s Bangalore, India operation, Gary recalls, “One of the big things we did was to help Jayshree and Pram [Jain], who had the charter to make Cisco a success in India. Period.”\n\nHow they did it was quite simple. John Chambers asked his executives to move select product development offshore. Jayshree and Pram picked two development areas to move out of California. Gary adds, “Jayshree picked the ONS 15454 and Pram picked the 7500. Jayshree tapped me on the shoulder and said we’re going to move some of the ‘454’ work out to India.”\n\nThese two Cisco executives paved the way, as both Jayshree and Pram went to India to get the ball rolling. “A lot of the ‘454’ software work was moved out to India,” according to Gary. “The problem we found right away was that the culture that we had for how we did things, and bringing excellence to what you did, and getting passionate about it [was missing]. There was nobody on the ground living and breathing it.”\n\nGary’s concerns were echoed by other top software developers that came out of the Cerent-Cisco era [4]. Gary recalls, “Things went according to the model Cisco had for what they did there. We found a person that made all the difference in the world, Soohan Mansing. He wanted to go back to India, anyway, and so [he went over and became] the cultural force in India . . . Soohan was irrepressible, and he almost singlehandedly turned it around; to a ‘454’ software release every 6 months; to a few participating things; to just being a world class software development organization, which they are today (2013).”\n\n​From Outsourcing to Globalization and Making Cisco World Class\n\n“Like John [Chambers] said, ‘Go make Cisco India world class,’ and we did,” recounts Gary. “Cisco’s India team [working on optical] had become the next generation of Cerent. It’s Cisco, and it’s that culture of getting things done that I experienced at both companies.”\n\nAlthough there was an economic factor (lower wages, fewer benefits) associated with outsourcing, this factor has slowly dissipated, so companies, today, tout the diversity factor for their globalization initiatives.\n\nGary told me, “One of the motivating factors, to be competitive on the global stage, was that you had to do development in Taiwan and China and India and so forth. There were some 400 people in India, and the ‘454’ went over there, and it was one of the key things that helped make Cisco India the juggernaut that it is today.”\n\n[1] An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, or simply, The Wealth of Nations, is Scottish economist Adam Smith’s masterpiece. Published in 1776, just as the United States became an independent nation itself, Smith outlined how nations build wealth. Smith’s fundamental tome describes such aspects as the division of labor, productivity, and free markets.\n\n[2] As early as 1995, Cisco set its sights on exploiting lower cost Indian labor. The Internet giant commenced its India-based operations in 1995. By 2016, the Cisco Global Development Center continues to operate in Bangalore and it has become the largest development center outside the United States. The company bills its “Research and Development (R&D)” arm as the organization that “develops disruptive business models for Cisco to create new go-to-market channels, markets, processes and technologies for emerging markets.” Note that Cisco has shed its “Acquisition and Develop” or A&D model in favor of the traditional R&D model. It’s déjà vu and a tip of the hat to the Nortel and Lucent models of the 1990s.\n\n[3] Cisco’s optical team, after being shopped around and almost deep-sixed in 2006, made a comeback shortly thereafter. One example of this resurgence was the acquisition of CoreOptics in 2009, where key optical development folks became part of the Monza, Italy team, officially named back then as the Cisco Service Provider Technology Group. These engineers were chartered to collaborate with Cisco's existing optical engineering teams in Monza, Italy; Bangalore, India; and Richardson, Texas.\n\n[4] Humphrey Chin from his vantage point, with a different startup in 2013, told me that conditions for startups, in general, had changed: “My understanding is that you can’t give the exact same proposal to the VCs that Ajaib [Bhadare, Cerent’s co-founder,] gave them back in 1997 and get funded without having an offshore component.” There was pressure to use engineering talent outside of the U.S. to keep costs under control even at the outset of the 2010s. Humphrey adds, “Communications is better than it was in the past but still you can’t do a hardware-software development like that [of the Cerent 454 anymore]. If we weren’t willing to stick around 18 hours a day to get something to work it wouldn’t have been successful. Just timeline wise, your India team is 12 hours away and all my conference calls these days are either late at night or very early in the morning. That type of communications is not sufficient to do what we did at Cerent.”\n\nCerent fit the model of what Cisco was looking for . . . a startup company that possessed what it needed to achieve a Number 1 ranking in a new telecom market segment (and do so with an optical transport platform that could quickly penetrate global markets).\n\nCerent’s management team also demonstrated a mindset that did not require, or desire, its own in-house manufacturing (Cerent had already adopted the outsourced factory model), and it was a company that had the technology to evolve well into the next decade [1] so future internal development costs would be low.\n\n​Coase’s Conclusion\n\nOne rationale for Cisco’s rapid move to acquire Cerent could have been presaged by economist Ronald Coase, who wrote, “The Nature of the Firm,” an article [2] penned in 1937. Even though vertical integration was all the rage [3] during the interval between the two world wars, Coase sought to define those factors that either favored greater vertical integration or those that constrained it.\n\nCisco, of course, sought to constrain vertical integration.\n\nCoase quotes Mr. Maurice Dobbs in his seminal 1937 piece, “. . . The undertaker busies himself with the division of labor inside each firm and he plans and organises consciously [but] he is related to the much larger economic specialisation, of which he himself is merely one specialised unit.”\n\nCisco, focused on its core competencies and, although it acted as but one cog in the larger telecom machine, it was, just like the undertaker, conscious of the larger eco-system in which it operated. During the 1990s, Cisco and many other companies – such as Dell and the upstart startup Cerent – leveraged late 20th-century technologies that pre-World War II companies did not have.\n\nMigrating from Frenzied to Focused\n\nAfter it abandoned its frenzied acquisition spree of the late 1990s and early 2000s, Cisco opted to focus on innovation (with internal product development), brand and market management (leveraging its industry power), and advancing its IT resource strength.\n\nHow did Cisco do what companies in a bygone era could not?\n\nCisco exploited three key areas (that had since become available) in which to advance its minimalist headcount environment:\n\nAdopt a new management technique,\n\nUtilize global transportation networks, and\n\nTake advantage of advanced communication technologies, many of which it acquired or developed.\n\n​To wit, managerial techniques were honed with the arrival of “new software tools that shifted power upward within the organization.” For example, Cisco could close its books each quarter in less than 24 hours, an achievement of Larry Carter’s accounting organization.\n\nModern transportation systems with their accompanying logistical support services brought manufacturing resources as far away as Asia to within a day of Cisco’s California home base. Consequently, Cisco contracted out as much of its manufacturing as it could.\n\nAnd, the rise of the Internet, which Cisco advocated, along with the collapse of telecommunications costs (by simply cannibalizing old telco networks in favor of modern IP–based networks) made it practical to more tightly organize a global workforce.\n\nAnd these three productivity improvements, most efficiently exploited by Cisco management through the early 2000s, allowed the company to boost its valuation to stratospheric heights, at least for a short time, while leaving its struggling competitors in its wake.\n\nIt’s no wonder that Cisco acquired startups such as Cerent as fast as it could in the late 1990s.\n\n[1] On December 9, 2010, Carrier Ethernet News reported, “XO Communications CTO Randy Nicklas declared that XO is not planning to buy anymore SONET moving forward as it rolls out a big network upgrade over the next three years. XO isn’t dumping existing SONET equipment in its network, mind you, but it is not continuing to purchase and embed it into its operations.” The story continued, “Most carriers really, really want to kick the SONET habit. Everyone, [including SBC-AT&T’s Chris Rice who tried to stop SONET purchases, in 2006], has vowed to stop buying the technology, but like any addictive drug, it’s hard to go cold turkey overnight.”\n\n[2] The Nature of the Firm, R.H. Coase, Economica, November 1937, pp.386–405.\n\n[3] “Given the existence of a robust base of suppliers and small innovators,” in the 1990s, “Cisco decided to cut loose from the parts of its business that were most difficult to expand organically – namely manufacturing and R&D.” Cisco opted to forego vertical integration, while at the same time, adds Barry Lynn, adopting “a strategy of acquiring a closely related set of products, much like General Motors in the 1910s or General Foods in the 1920s. The result was that managers, over the course of five years and on a global scale, were able to capture for their company the de facto title of General Internet.” It turns out that Cerent fit both of these criteria – no in-house manufacturing nor internal R&D – and so it became a no-brainer to acquire this upstart startup, solely for these reasons.\n\nSource: End of the Line: The Rise and Coming Fall of the Global Corporation, Barry C. Lynn, 2005, Doubleday, New York, chapter 5.\n\n“Fortune knocks but once, but misfortune has much more patience.”\n\n– Laurence J. Peter (1919–1990)\n\n​Cisco, almost from the start, operated as an “arbitrage-oriented firm.”\n\nSuch firms, as described by Barry Lynn in his book, End of the Line: The Rise and Coming Fall of the Global Corporation (2005), “are designed to focus much more on using their power over their production systems to wring out wealth immediately, rather than to devote resources to technologies that might create wealth years from now.”\n\nThe emphasis placed on “production systems” is mine. In an earlier BLOG post, I reviewed how Cisco leveraged outsourcing to bring its manufacturing costs way down. For example, “By 2000, some 90 percent of Cisco’s subassembly work took place outside the company, as Cisco managers kept control only of high-end, developmental production work.”\n\nCisco and other firms of this bent viewed “development of new technologies and new products, rather than an investment in the future, as no more than an unnecessary and probably unwise cost.”\n\nA Frenzied Acquisition Force\n\nAnd it was this inane philosophy that drove Cisco to its acquisition and develop (A&D) mindset instead of the more traditional research and development (R&D) approach used by competitors such as Nortel, Lucent, and Tellabs.\n\nDuring the 1990s, many entrepreneurs in and around Silicon Valley, including Ed Paulson, who, in his book, Inside Cisco (2001), began to refer to Cisco “as the ‘borg,’ [1] owing to the company’s ‘innovation through acquisition strategy.’ Between mid-1993 and mid-2001, Cisco purchased 71 firms in one of the most extravagant buying sprees in high-tech history.”\n\nCisco collected engineering talent and new products with a speed that astounded industry observers and Wall Street denizens alike. The company knew, as Lynn reported, “that success lay in moving very fast to capture control of its marketplace. And in part, the strategy emerged simply because the company could afford to do so.”\n\nAs the price of the Internet giant’s stock soared, “Cisco’s top managers found themselves atop a vast pool of ‘capital’ for acquisition,” and they wasted no time in using that value to ramp up its buying spree in 1998.\n\nCisco’s stock rose to about $80 early in the new millennium. Graphic courtesy Cisco.\n\n​Cisco’s strategy was simplicity itself. Customers shared their needs and the company would buy the required technologies to satisfy those needs. Cisco adapted to emerging technologies as close to instantaneous as any company could. One could argue that Cisco was tuned to the market just like a venture capitalist firm. And the company was able to ride the wave of technological fads.\n\nFor instance, Cisco’s investment in Ethernet switching was a big success.\n\nTheir subsequent investment in ATM turned out to be a bust in the long-term, but it allowed them a Trojan horse filled with IP/Ethernet-solutions to infiltrate the service provider marketplace.\n\nHowever, the company fared much better in optical investments. Cerent was the standout in optical transport, but the other five of the six company investments in optical products were a bust [2]. However, the good news here is that the engineering talent that remained from the other acquired optical companies helped to rapidly evolve the Cerent 454 (now the Cisco ONS 15454) platform and make Cisco a major optical competitor.\n\nInnovation through New Technology Introduction\n\n“Viewed from an innovation system perspective,” writes Lynn, Cisco’s strategy during the 1990s helped “to maintain Cisco as the keystone predator within a venture capital ecosystem. Indeed, Cisco . . . fostered what became an entirely new model for identifying, incubating, and introducing new technologies. Small firms supported by venture capital took the hard initial steps and incurred the initial risks. In exchange, Cisco provided the ‘exit,’ rewarding founders and funders at the small companies with rich chunks of Cisco stock and sometimes lucrative jobs inside the firm.”\n\nUpstart startups planted the seeds and tended their saplings, while Cisco harvested the ripest fruit. This process delivered a bumper crop through early 2001, but then, the market leader succumbed to a myriad of events that tell the other half of the story, best illustrated by the graphic below.\n\nCisco’s stock fell like a rock from its $80 highs in early 2001 to a level that settled around $15 by 2011. Graphic courtesy Cisco.\n\n​​In response to these challenging times, Cisco shed both employees and product lines. The company surrendered its acquisition-and-develop model and silently telegraphed this shift in strategy as the telecom meltdown reached its height. By 2005, Cisco acknowledged its curtailment of frenzied acquisitions in most of the company’s presentations, in favor of in-house “innovation,” something that it had sporadically done in the past.\n\n​The question today, “Is this shift in strategy working?” And does this “mature company” approach allow Cisco to achieve growth and higher stock valuations like it once knew?\n\nIts shareholders still want to know.\n\n[1] In the Star Trek universe, the “Borg” annex the technology and knowledge of other alien species to the Collective by forcibly assimilating them, and in the process transforming individual beings into drones. The Borg's ultimate goal is to achieve perfection.\n\n[2] The other five optical acquisitions included Monterey (1), acquired on the same day as Cerent, in 1999, for its optical cross-connect technology. Pirelli (2), and Qeyton Systems (3) and their WDM-centric products turned out to be a bust in terms of generating revenue. Other optically-oriented resources shoehorned into the optical business unit from other failed acquisitions such as Pipelinks (4) and Fibex (5) had to be redeployed from a management perspective. For example, research scientists out of Monza, Italy from the Pirelli acquisition were able to add value to the acquired Cerent product line, but this occurred years later. For the company as a whole, Cisco doubled its revenue from $19 billion in 2000 to $38 billion in 2013. Cerent’s one billion dollar contribution was more than five percent of Cisco’s 2000 total revenue metric, almost all of which bolstered the company’s service provider segment. Read chapter 9 of The Upstart Startup for more.\n\n​McLeodUSA was a growing Competitive Local Exchange Provider (CLEC) throughout the 1990s after being founded by Clark McLeod in 1992. The company initially provided fiber optic maintenance services for the Iowa Communications Network. During the early part of Cerent’s engagement with the Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based service provider, Ovation Communications was acquired by McLeodUSA in the fall of 1998, an early sign that the alternative provider market was about to consolidate.\n\nCerent Targets McLeodUSA for Business\n\nOn December 5, 1998, Terry Brown, Cerent’s vice-president for sales, marketing, and customer service, and I, met to review McLeodUSA’s need for a “3/1 Digital Cross-connect System” or 3/1 DCS for short.\n\nTheir Request For Information (RFI), a pre-cursor to a formal bid, intrigued us as McLeod’s ideas contained therein, mirrored our (Cerent’s) philosophy regarding distributing the management of bandwidth around the network. The opportunity to influence their formal Request for Proposal (RFP) and to be considered for delivering $300 million worth of product over a five-year period was enticing. The relatively low circuit count (of DS1s and DS3s) fit the architecture of the Cerent 454 perfectly [1].\n\nThe Cerent Approach – A 1998 Perspective as it Applied to McLeodUSA\n\nI worked with Jeff Santos and later, Bruce Hollett on Jeff’s behalf, to position Cerent and its groundbreaking product for McLeodUSA’s future growth. Since competitor Positron was already deployed, we positioned our planned integrated ATM capabilities as a technology approach to “cap and kill” Positron [2]. Consequently, we presented Cerent as the “transport vendor of choice” for all of their TDM (DS1 and DS3 circuits, for example) and for their ATM traffic across their expanding backbone network. As Alcatel was also a favorite of McLeodUSA’s engineers, it was important that we demonstrate interoperability with both Positron and Alcatel [3].\n\nThe McLeodUSA Strategy Defined\n\nI wrote, “The McLeodUSA opportunity enables us to reinforce our position in the marketplace and play to a major strength of the Cerent 454. This strength is our bandwidth management capability in a 3/1 cross-connect application. Although we will be highlighting the STS and VT management capabilities of the ‘454,’ we will not deviate from our long-term vision of what role we want the ‘454’ to play in customer networks. The Cerent 454 will be positioned as the ‘Transport Manager of choice.’”\n\nI added, “It will be presented not only as able to accommodate the ‘asked for’ TDM traffic fill, but also as an ATM aggregator for McLeodUSA’s data traffic . . . We will also take the opportunity to highlight the hubbing capability of the platform, such that multiple UPSR rings can be simultaneously subtended from the [main] ‘cross-connect’ location. This approach will include interoperability with the new ATM Mux device that Joe Gerke is deciding upon.”\n\nIn this strategy definition, I included a figure to clearly illustrate the area of the network we targeted with our proposal. Cerent brought significant value to McLeodUSA so much so, that a lab evaluation began in January 1999.\n\nGraphic produced by R.K. Koslowsky based on the McLeodUSA network as it was presented in the 1998 RFI\n\n​It’s Chilly in Iowa in January but Things Are Heating Up\n\nJeff Santos, on January 11, 1999, wrote, “McLeodUSA announced Friday its plan to acquire Ovation Communications. As some of you know, we are currently working on a large 3/1 DCS RFP with McLeod and [we’re] going to be placing evaluation systems in their demonstration lab next week.”\n\nEric Clelland, Jeff’s counterpart in sales, during 1998, had been building awareness for Cerent at Ovation and was also having some success there [6]. Both Ovation and McLeodUSA are extremely interested in the ‘454.’\n\nJeff added, “I believe this acquisition will strengthen our position in both accounts. McLeod simply becomes that much more important to Cerent.”\n\nLet the lab trial begin!\n\nAnd It’s Even Hotter in the Summer\n\nOn June 3, 1999, McLeodUSA announced its intention to buy Access Communications, based in Salt Lake City. The purchase expanded McLeodUSA’s voice and data communications market by 23 percent.\n\nA couple of months later, Jeff Santos held a breakfast meeting with McLeodUSA on August 11, 1999, in Cedar Rapids. He met with Mike Boehne, Jeff McKeefry, and Trent Bonstetter. The former two gentleman had already visited Cerent in Petaluma the previous October, when they were with Ovation Communications. Bonstetter hailed from MEANS, another Eric Clelland customer. Jeff characterized their discussion as “extremely friendly and informative.”\n\nHe wrote to his salesman, Bruce Hollett, and the rest of us supporting Bruce, in growing the ‘454’ business: “Great job to date. These guys are jazzed about a long-term relationship with Cerent. Congrats to you and the support team for a job well done. Let's go drive a truck through this one.”\n\nIt turned out that Mike Boehne was moving more and more of the vendor selection process into engineering and out of research and development. The impact the acquired Ovation folks were having on McLeodUSA was being felt. Jeff told us, “Steve Graham and Ron Speltz are key folks to work with in Cedar, [with] Scott Jennings and Ron Speltz driving new backbone designs [using] OC-192 for mid-next-year with express channels and ADM sites . . . They still like 4F-BLSR for the backbone, [but they] don’t see the need for matched nodes.”\n\nAt the time, McLeodUSA remained interested in DWDM functionality on our OC-48 configurations and sough even better OC-48 optical performance. Jeff summarized the state of affairs, “They are deploying ‘454s’ today in city rings . . . Release schedule integrity is one of their TOP priorities.”\n\nIn a sign that Cerent was growing too fast in mid-1999, Trent Bonstetter made a couple of comments about the fact that he ran into some ‘newbies’ on Cerent’s Customer Technical Assistance Center (CTAC) phone line. Jeff reported, “Trent knew more about the equipment than they did.”\n\nFun in the Fall\n\nOn October 4, 1999, Jack DeGrace, a Cerent engineer supporting McLeodUSA in Iowa wrote, “Overall, very positive feedback on the capabilities and ease of use of the ‘454.’”\n\nWhat a year!\n\n[1] In a distributed-bandwidth-management (or “cross-connect”) configuration, performance monitoring and built-in testing capabilities of the DS1s, in particular, was a crucial feature, that the Cerent 454 did not possess in its initial Release 1 and Release 1.1 offerings. However, the fact that the Cerent 454 could address 80 percent of the small (distributed) cross-connect market more cost-effectively than Tellabs and its vaunted Titan product came as a major threat to that telecom supplier.\n\n[2] At Supercomm 1998, held in Atlanta during June of that year, Positron Fiber Systems (PFS) Corporation of Montreal announced that its Osiris line of SONET multiplexers could be field-upgraded from its existing OC-3 or OC-12 rates to higher-rate OC-48. Positron claimed that all that was needed was a new OC-48 plug-in card to replace either the existing OC-3 or OC-12 one. Sounding like a Cerent 454, yet to be formally announced one year later, Positron claimed that service providers could directly access Ethernet and FastEthernet LANs as well as DS1 applications, such as PBXs, without having to use external bridges, routers, or lower speed SONET boxes. Having a direct DS1 to OC-48 connection was becoming a big deal. Positron started the ball rolling, but it would be Cerent that would soon eclipse PFS in this space.\n\n[3] By the time Cisco completed its acquisition of Cerent, the upstart startup had not yet formally documented interoperability with Positron. However, Cerent had already completed interoperability with the more popular Alcatel products: The 1603SM with its OC-3, DS1, and DS3 interfaces, performed in Cerent’s Petaluma interoperability lab that Ron Ostrowski and I set up; the 1612 at the OC-12 rate in the field during the Golden Valley Electric (Alaska) installation; and the 1648 at the OC-48 rate in the field during the Grande River Communication (Texas) system line up and test.\n\n[4] According to Acre Broadband, as of August 2017, the company presented Joe Gerke’s credentials, a portion which follows: “In 1993, Mr. Gerke joined McLeodUSA . . . he held a variety of roles in Information Systems, Research & Development, Network Services and Network Operations. He played a key role in developing the strategic proposal for the Iowa Communication Network expansion, which resulted in a $45 million network build. He was also a key team member that designed, constructed and operated of McLeodUSA ATS, one of the first ‘fiber to the curb’ networks in the nation throughout Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a network that is still operational today as ImOn Communications.” As I see it, Gerke evaluated ATM-edge technology that was soon superseded by packet-based technology to accommodate data across all telecom networks. Gerke left McLeodUSA in 2001.\n\n[5] Cerent’s initial product release was not enough to satisfy McLeod USA. A subsequent release, due out in the summer of 1999, would be needed to support UPSR rings, VT-bandwidth management in support of the DS1 management capability, an EC-1 functionality to support SONET electrical interfaces (STS-1), and transmux functionality. Cerent also had to better define its DS1 test access capability, a feature also demanded by Williams and others. Already agreed upon was the ability of the ‘454’ to provide continuous DS1 performance monitoring and information on a planned “Cerent Management System” or CMS.\n\n[6] On October 27, 1998, Ovation Communications visited Cerent’s Petaluma facility. Eric Clelland hosted the customer. The three attendees included Mike Boehne, Vice-president Technology Services, with responsibility for all network deployment; Greg Hutterer, Director of Product (Services) Development, responsible for new service development such as xDSL, ATM, LAN Service (TLS), and Frame Relay; and Jeff McKeefry, Director Network Engineering, responsible for deciding which equipment would be “standardized” for deployment in building the multiple city (Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, Minneapolis, Indianapolis, and Cleveland) interconnections. Although Ovation was using Fujitsu and Lucent equipment, Jeff was interested in looking beyond the established vendors when Eric made his initial contact with Ovation. Besides the inter-city opportunities, local ring opportunities were emerging, as well as the 3/3 and 3/1 cross-connect applications, similar to those at McLeodUSA.\n\n[7] Keith Hanna took over the direct sales interface from Bruce Hollett in 1999 after Cisco acquired Cerent. Keith notes, “Shortly after Cisco acquired Cerent, I was hired on and ended up managing the McLeodUSA account as they ramped up during the fever pitch of the 1999-2000 market expansion. I remember that my regular travel routine was Chicago to Cedar Rapids to Minneapolis to support and serve McLeodUSA. It was quite a ride until the bubble burst in late 2000, early 2001. It was fun while it lasted.”\n\n​“Carl and I were chatting on top of the stairs at Petaluma one day,” Dave Cesca told me, regarding some time he spent with Carl Russo, Cerent’s CEO, on a rare visit Dave made to Cerent’s Petaluma headquarters.\n\n“We were talking about the There’s Something About Mary movie [released in 1998],” Dave said. “A couple of investors were coming up the stairs. Carl and I sort of look alike, and they asked, “Who is Carl Russo . . .?”\n\n“We pointed at each other at the same time, and we both said, ‘Him.’”\n\nIndeed, there was something about this relaxed, but intense pair of Cisco executives. Although they were joking around with Cerent’s arriving (potential) investors that day, both were serious about growing the business – Carl as CEO and Dave as one of Cerent’s sales leaders.\n\n​Less than a year later, both Carl and Dave became part of Cisco, as the Internet giant completed its acquisition of the upstart startup, Cerent. And there was something about Cisco.\n\nCisco Could Do No Wrong . . .\n\nKevin Tolly, in December 1999, wrote, “Cisco has its own allure and is not governed by the rules that govern other vendors . . .” He took a lot of flak for apparently elevating Cisco above the rest of the equipment manufacturing pack – Nortel, Lucent, Alcatel, and many others.\n\nTolly had to quickly clarify his position: “What I mean is, Cisco's customers often let the company ‘get away’ with things that other vendors would never be allowed to get away with. For example, if the Accelar did not perform at wire-speed at Layer 2 and 3, for all ports, with quality of service disabled or enabled -- Nortel Networks would have a tough time trying to sell it in the marketplace. Cisco's customers, however, don't seem to mind a bit that the Catalyst cannot perform anywhere near wire-speed.”\n\nLooking back, by 1999, Cisco still had not cracked the service provider market in a big way; at least not with the network infrastructure organizations that decided where the billions of dollars of transport and switching equipment were deployed.\n\nUnlike the Enterprise customer segment, the Service Providers (in particular, telcos), would not let Cisco get away with products that were not RUS-listed, nor Telcordia compliant, let alone not meeting the basic five ‘9s’ of reliability. And for a product not to meet baseline specifications, such as Cisco’s Catalyst’s poor performance, it would never reach the field. Orders for it would not be allowed to be placed.\n\n​Tolly argued his case when it came to Cisco’s growing customer base in the late 1990s, “I try to deal with facts, and the fact is that customers and prospects treat Cisco differently than they treat its competitors. Right or wrong, that is what I observe.”\n\nIndeed, Cisco continued to grow faster than all of its competitors, the company kept acquiring startups to bolster its engineering staff and expand its market reach [1], and the San Jose-based giant could do no wrong, especially in the eyes of Wall Street and the industry analysts.\n\n​Tolly found one example of a happy Cisco customer, a retailer, “contemplating a major migration to Nortel.”\n\nThe reason for selecting one of Cisco's competitors?\n\nTolly adds, “The Nortel gear was perfectly matched to its need, and with it, the company calculated WAN link savings over the Cisco products that was measured in millions of dollars annually.”\n\nDo you agree with Tolly’s assertion, at least before the dot.com bust and telecom meltdown that . . . “There's something about Cisco?”\n\nWhat about today?\n\n[1] Cisco acquired Cerent for $6.9 billion in the summer of 1999 and finalized the deal in November 1999, just before Tolly penned these words.\n\n[2] The Cerent acquisition not only gave Cisco engineering talent and hundreds of new service provider customers, but Cerent’s service provider orientation helped to transform Cisco into a company that built higher quality products and networking platforms that suited the service providers’ stringent product and network performance requirements.\n\n[3] Guest column: There’s something about Cisco, Kevin Tolly, Computerworld.
