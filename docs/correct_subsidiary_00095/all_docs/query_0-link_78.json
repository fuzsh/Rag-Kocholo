        "text": "BOX 7.1 Educational Achievement of U.S. K-12 Students\n\nOne indicator of the science and mathematics achievement of K-12 students in the United States is found in the results of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), conducted in 1995 and 1996.1 Overall, on this international assessment, U.S. students scored slightly above the international average in science and slightly below the average in mathematics. However, the results for 17-year-olds —those closest to entering the IT workforce—were worse than those of the younger students.2 In both mathematics and science, the U.S. 17-year-olds scored below the international average, and among the lowest, of the 21 countries participating. Overall, the performance of U.S. high school seniors in mathematics has been near the bottom in international comparisons over the past 30 years. Within the smaller group of 16 countries that participated in assessments of physics and advanced mathematics, the scores of U.S. 17-year-olds were among the lowest.\n\nOther measures of the science and mathematics knowledge of U.S. students come from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, a nationally representative testing program involving students in grades 4, 8, and 12. The most recent NAEP results, from 1999, indicated that only a small fraction of students at each grade level were “proficient” in mathematics and science. 3\n\nLike the TIMSS results, the NAEP results suggested that the performance of 12th graders in science and mathematics was lower than that of younger students. It is noteworthy, however, that a National Research Council committee found problems with the procedures used for standard setting and defining the cutoff between NAEP scores deemed “basic” and those that represent “proficient” performance.4 This committee's report suggested that the cutoff had been set too high, yielding results “that do not appear to be reasonable relative to numerous other external comparisons.”5 Although weak as an absolute measure of the science and mathematics achievement of U.S. students at any one point in time, NAEP scores can usefully reveal trends. Used in this way, NAEP results from 1990, 1992, 1996, and 1999 indicate that student achievement in mathematics increased significantly over that time period.\n\nThe science and mathematics achievement of younger U.S. students appears greater than that of older students. In contrast to the weak performance of high school seniors in the TIMSS, U.S. fourth graders scored above the international average in both mathematics and science, and their science performance was second highest among the 26 countries participating.6 However, U.S. eighth graders' performance in both mathematics and science was squarely in the middle among the 25 countries participating.\n\nWhat are the implications for the future IT workforce when younger U.S. students perform better on science and mathematics assessments than older students? One interpretation is that today's fourth graders will be tomorrow's IT workers, with a strong mathematics and science base to draw on. On the other hand, if the current pattern of declining test scores with age persists, these youngsters may perform more poorly in mathematics and science as they near high school graduation —just at the time when they might prepare for college-level IT study and/or for IT work.\n\n5\n\nBOX 7.3 Lessons in Promoting IT-Related Study from Historically Black Colleges and Universities\n\nWhat might account for the differences in the fraction of science, engineering, and IT-related graduates between historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and their majority counterparts?\n\nNote that the interesting question suggested by Table 7.3.1 does not compare minority students at HBCUs to minority students at majority institutions; rather, it suggests a possible difference between the ways in which HBCUs and majority institutions approach the subject of attracting and retaining all students to science, engineering, and IT-related degree programs.\n\nIt may be true that the student population attracted to HBCUs is generally more professionally oriented than those drawn to majority educational institutions. Such an orientation would naturally lead to a preference for majors in the scientific and engineering disciplines, including computer science and other IT-related fields. At the same time, a substantial fraction of students attending majority institutions who express an interest in science or engineering majors do not complete their degrees in such fields.1\n\nTo understand what HBCUs might be doing differently than majority institutions to attract and retain students in computer science majors, it is useful to understand the traditional “pipeline” model on which much of science education is based. In this model, students pass through a series of barriers, designed to filter out individuals who are incapable of studying science at the next level of sophistication or advancement. At the end of the process, those who remain are those who are “fit” to enter the profession.2\n\nThe model employed by HBCUs (and a number of other institutions as well) is quite different. Rather than emphasizing the filtering process, the HBCU model stresses inclusion. Thus, the model calls for extensive outreach, mentoring, and continuing support from the institution as a whole as well as mechanisms for students to obtain support from their peers. Students are not left to fend for themselves, as might be implied by a pipeline model; instead, students who may be in academic difficulty are sought out and intellectual, academic, and emotional support offered.\n\n1\n\nTABLE 7.3.1 Differences in the Number of Science, Engineering, and IT-related Graduates at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Majority Institutions\n\nBOX 7.5 IT Skills Standards from the Northwest Center for Emerging Technologies\n\nThe Northwest Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET) at Bellevue Community College in Washington State led a recent effort to identify the broad skills, ability, and knowledge required for work in a broad range of IT occupations. With funding from the National Science Foundation and the State of Washington, NWCET developed initial skill standards in 1997. Information on the skills and abilities required in nine different “career clusters” (groups of occupations) was obtained through interviews, focus groups, and surveys of both workers and employers. Over the next 2 years, NWCET worked with national trade associations, educators, publishers, and others to validate and refine the initial skill standards. Panels of IT workers and managers in northern Virginia, in Springfield, Massachusetts, and in Silicon Valley provided feedback on the draft standards and identified new and changing skill requirements. Their input led to new draft standards, which were reviewed and validated through a survey of over 2,000 employers of IT workers. Finally, in 1999, NWCET released updated skill standards for eight career clusters.1\n\nFollowing a job analysis system developed by the National Skill Standards Board, NWCET staff identified the broad job functions, or “critical work functions,” required in many different jobs within each career cluster. To define skills more specifically, each critical work function was broken down further into “key activities.” Based on managers' and workers' definitions of successful performance in each key activity, NWCET identified “performance indicators” for each. Next, job analysts identified the technical knowledge and the broader “employability skills” required for successful performance of the key activities and critical work functions. Examples are shown in Table 2.7 in Chapter 2, pp. 88 and 89..\n\nBOX 7.6 Uses of NWCET IT Skill Standards in Secondary Schools and Community Colleges\n\nWashington State policymakers supported the NWCET IT skill standards effort because they recognized that developing and delivering curriculum based on the modularized skill standards could significantly reduce the time required to get emerging technology trends into the classroom. This potential may be realized in several locations around the nation. For example, Maryland has developed a comprehensive technology education plan based in part on the NWCET skill standards and associated curriculum. The Maryland plan calls for a broad, integrated approach to IT education, with components in secondary school, community college, and university education, as well as internships. Wisconsin has developed a model youth apprenticeship program in IT, based on the NWCET modular curriculum. Because it includes broad, transferable skills and knowledge identified in the skill standards, this youth apprenticeship program provides the knowledge young people need if they decide to pursue further study in the state technical colleges.\n\nThe Oregon Software Association has worked with the state department of education to develop skill standards-based IT curricula for certificates of initial and advanced mastery for IT, using the NWCET curriculum, efficiently articulating programs from the high school to community college level. In addition, large secondary school and community college districts in California, Texas, Massachusetts, and Florida, with state support, have developed comprehensive systems of IT education based on the NWCET skill standards. These educational models include curricula and assessments designed to provide flexible, quality IT education at the high school and college level.\n\nBOX 7.7 Incremental versus Paradigmatic Change\n\nSoftware technology has undergone some drastic changes in the last couple of decades. Although some computer programming languages are quite similar in their underlying constructs (for example, compare C and Pascal), the newest generations of languages are quite different from the previous generations (compare Pascal and Java).\n\nFor example, “objects” in Java and C++ are an entirely new concept that is not contained in C or Pascal or Fortran. Even more importantly, a large amount of the power of Java and C++ is embedded in the use of objects (so much so that these languages are regarded as being “object-oriented ”). Thus, to use Java or C++ effectively, one must become familiar with an entirely new, object-oriented computing paradigm. Although a programmer trained in C can begin to do some things with C++ immediately (specifically, he or she can implement code that does not require objects), gaining a true command of the new language, with its object orientation, is much more difficult than learning new syntax.\n\nThe difference between procedural languages and object-oriented languages is only one example of an abrupt change in the paradigms of programming. Functional programming is another equally abrupt difference. It is true that one can implement any programming task in any language, but programming languages can differ dramatically in the extent to which they make it easy or difficult to express solutions in any given problem domain.\n\nOutside the domain of programming languages, changes in software technology can become even more significant. For example, the difference between software development in a mainframe environment and a Web-based environment is essentially a matter of different operating systems, but these manifest themselves at every level, from detailed implementation to (most importantly) requirements specification. Furthermore, for many system development projects, an understanding of the computing infrastructure is essential (e.g., different forms of connectivity among applications)—and the infrastructure underlying mainframes and Web computing are fundamentally different.\n\nFinally, it is important to understand that differences in work content can be as intellectually challenging for individual workers as a change in technological paradigm. Contrary to some popular beliefs, a worker's familiarity with and knowledge of an application domain have considerable influence on his or her ability to develop applications relevant to that domain. Thus, a person with experience developing business applications may well have difficulty in writing device drivers, even though he may well be a competent programmer. Problems involving real-time applications are often particularly difficult without the requisite experience. Graphics applications are difficult, even with considerable programming experience, because of all the new algorithms that have to be learned for coordinate transformations, projections, visibility calculations, lighting calculations, and texturing.\n\nBOX 7.8 Training in ASTD Firms\n\nLarger firms, and the human resources development experts they employ, often participate actively in the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD), a professional association.1 In an ongoing effort to measure the value of training and skills, ASTD provides a free benchmarking service to organizations that provide detailed information on their training investments, innovative human resources practices, and performance outcomes. In 1998, about 750 organizations participated in this process, reporting on their training activities and expenditures during 1997. Large firms in several sectors that employ large numbers of IT workers, as well as the IT sector, participated in the study.2\n\nAmong this small,3 self-selected sample, the IT sector was a leader,4 with the highest training expenditures as a percentage of payroll and one of the highest expenditures per employee, when compared to other industry sectors. Not surprisingly, the IT sector led in the use of advanced training delivery technologies. Although reporting one of the highest levels of internal trainers per employee (compared to other sectors), IT firms also used a large percentage of outside trainers and independent consultants, educational institutions, and product suppliers.\n\nDuring 1999, an even smaller group of 276 organizations responded to a new component of the ASTD benchmarking survey, designed to measure intellectual capital. Because this new portion of the survey is difficult and time-consuming, only those organizations most committed to innovative training and human resources practices are likely to respond.5 Among this group of organizations, the single largest group is IT companies. Overall, the 276 firms, including large IT firms, had low turnover rates (averaging 11.5 percent) and high levels of basic IT literacy, and they spent an average of 2.2 percent of payroll on training."
