Connect the pipelines to bring water and save the flower.\n\nExpert Plumber is a free puzzle game easy to play but hard to master.\n\nSimply turn the different pipe pieces by touching them and connect all of them to make a complete pipe (that's the work of a plumber !) and make the water reach the flower !\n\nYou have a limited number of moves each round and you have to save the flower before running out of moves (touching 1 pipe = 1 movement). There is no time limit but you will have to think well before each move.\n\nExpert Plumber puzzle contains 100 free levels with increasing difficulty and additional level pack with another 100 levels!\n\nPlumber is really fun and requires strategy to fix the pipeline in as few movements as possible. Each solved level adds points to your score and helps you become an Expert Plumber."
