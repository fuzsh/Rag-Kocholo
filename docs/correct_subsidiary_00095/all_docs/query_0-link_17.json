        "text": "San Jose, CA-based Cisco Systems Inc. has acquired the privately-held Internet Engineering Group (IEng; Ann Arbor, MI). Under the terms of the acquisition, Cisco will pay approximately $25 million to acquire the outstanding equity of IEng. The acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase and has closed in the second quarter of Cisco's fiscal 2000. Cisco's board of directors and the members of IEng have approved the acquisition.\n\nIEng's software resides in the core of the service providers' network. Their open, standards-based software suite can be easily integrated with Cisco's existing network software offering to bring more functionality, flexibility, and scalability to optical internetworks.\n\nIEng was founded in 1996. The 13 employees will become part of the Optical Internetworking Business Unit within the Service Provider line of business."
