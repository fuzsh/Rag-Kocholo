From ductile iron to pre-stressed concrete to metal or plastic pipe, conduit or cables - whatever your application - LINK-SEAL® modular seals will affect a hydrostatic seal capable of holding 20 psig (40 feet of static head) between the pipe and the penetration cylinder through which the pipe passes. IN COMBINATION WITH CENTURY-LINE® SLEEVES The best way to guarantee a perfect seal is to use CENTURY-LINE® sleeves with LINK-SEAL® modular seals. They’re engineered and sized to provide a stable hole that matches dimensionally with LINK-SEAL® modular seals. It makes ordering quick and easy and guarantees a perfect fit - and seal - each and every time. CELL-CAST® DISKS For larger holes in poured concrete structures, (29.25” to 64.75”Ø) CELL-CAST® disks are used to produce a dimensionally stable hole and smooth concrete surface that is perfect for use with LINK-SEAL® modular seals. »» Mechanical Contractors - Interior & Exterior Piping Systems »» Manhole Pipe Entry Seals »» Waste Treatment Plants »» Cased Road Crossings »» Thermal Storage Systems »» Fire Protection Wall Penetrations »» Cased Railroad Crossings »» Electrical Isolation of Pipes »» Precast Concrete Vault Seals »» Insulated Pipe Seals »» Dual Containment Seals »» Marine Applications »» Noise Dampening »» Flexible Sign & Pole Supports »» Electrical Isolation of Pipe Supports »» Mining »» Pulp & Paper »» Decorative Fountains »» Pool Contractors »» Electrical Contractors »» Waste Water & Water Treatment Plants »» Telecommunications »» Valve Pits »» Refrigeration Buildings »» Guard Post Assemblies »» Power Generation Dams »» Offshore Oil Rigs »» High Pressure Tank Guards »» Underground Steel Tanks »» Precast Concrete Manufacturers »» Perimeter Berm Installations Around Tank Farms »» Flow Restrictions in Sewer Maintenance »» Fluid Overflow Devices »» Noise and Sway Dampener »» Through Deck Fire Breaks »» Bridge Construction »» Septic Tank Installations »» Coal Preparation Plants »» Tunneling Operations The System is the Solution LINK-SEAL® Modular Seal Applications Piping Specialties, Inc. | www.psi-team.com | 800-223-1468\n\n5. 5 MADE IN AMERICA SAVES TIME AND MONEY LINK-SEAL® modular seals install in up to 75% less time when compared to lead-oakum joints, hand fitted flashings, mastics or casing boots. POSITIVE HYDROSTATIC SEAL LINK-SEAL® modular seals are rated at 20 psig (40 feet of head), which exceeds the performance requirements of most applications. LONG SEAL LIFE LINK-SEAL® modular seals are designed for use as a permanent seal. Seal elements are specially compounded to resist aging and attack from ozone, sunlight, water and a wide range of chemicals. MAXIMUM PROTECTION AGAINST CORROSION Fasteners employ the use of a proprietary coating process on carbon steel. For extremely corrosive environments, corrosion resistant 316 stainless steel hardware is offered as a standard. ISO QUALITY ASSURANCE LINK-SEAL® modular seals are manufactured and assembled in an ISO 9001:2008 certified facility in the U.S.A. CERTIFICATION/APPROVALS Factory Mutual Approval, Det Norske Veritas Marine Deak/ Bulkhead Penetration Certification. Also a wide variety of approvals from various Federal agencies, associations, code groups, laboratories and organizations. CONFIGURE A LINK-SEAL® MODULAR SEAL TO MATCH YOUR APPLICATION Color coded EPDM, Nitrile, & Silicone elastomers may be used with various hardware options to match performance characteristics with service conditions. CHOOSE A LINK-SEAL® MODULAR SEAL TO MATCH YOUR PIPE SIZE AND WALL OPENING LINK-SEAL® modular seals are now available in 16 sizes to provide a solution for varying pipe penetration applications. LINK-SEAL® Modular Seal sizing is the preferred method designed to put the most rubber in the annular space. This updated method benefits the engineer, owner and contractor. FEATURES: More Rubber in Annular Space = Better Performing Seal » Engineered fit » Increased vibration dampening » Minimum loads on bolts and pressure plates with same sealing effect » Most sealing pressure/most volume of sealing element in penetration » Curvature of link sized to penetration O.D. and I.D. for smooth fit In accomplishing putting more rubber in the annular space, the LINK-SEAL® assembly may require a larger size link with less links per belt or a smaller size link with more links per belt. The difference between Sleeve and Cored Hole sizing has also been taken into consideration.

Calculate the annular space. The annular space is half the difference between the actual pipe O.D. and the actual wall I.D. opening diameter. Use the following formula. 2. From the adjacent chart, select the size closest to the annular space calculated in step 1. You have selected the correct size LINK-SEAL® modular seal if the free state thickness is less than the annular space and the expanded state thickness is greater than the annular space. 3. Calculate the number of links required to fit around the pipe and seal the annular space. A. Determine the bolt circle for your LINK-SEAL® modular seal assembly by using the following formula. B. Find the LINK-SEAL® modular seal chord length (Column 4) and use the following formula to determine required number of links per LINK-SEAL® modular seal assembly. The result must be rounded down to the next whole number. The figures are accurate if the calculation results in 13 or more links per belt. If the results are fewer than 13 links verify using the tables on pages 18-23. Annular Space = Wall Opening I.D. - Actual Pipe O.D. 2 Bolt Circle = Wall Opening I.D. + Pipe Diameter O.D. 2 Links per Seal = Bolt Circle x 3.14 Chord Length Annular Space = 12 - 9.05 = 1.475 2 Bolt Circle = 12 + 9.05 = 10.525 2 Links per Seal = 10.525 x 3.14 = 9.12 3.625 LINK-SEAL® Model Selected for Penetration Minimum Required Seating Width LS-200/275 2.25” LS-300/315 3.00” LS-325/340/360 4.00” LS-400/410/425/475 5.00” LS-500/525/575 5.00” LS-615/650 6.00” Chord Length Free State Thickness Expanded State Thickness Example Wall Opening I.D. = 12” Actual Pipe O.D. = 9.05” Calculate the annular space (1.475”). Select the Link- Seal® modular seal size closest to the annular space. LS-400 is chosen from the chart, because 1.475” falls between 1.43 and 1.81 (the free state and expanded state thickness). Determine the number of links for a complete assembly. Chord length for LS-400 = 3.625” Links per Seal = 9.12, rounded down = 9 Since the final calculation results are fewer then 13 links, it is advisable to verify the accuracy of the calculation by using the verification tables on pages 18-23.

SUGGESTED PIPE O.D. RANGE *-Whenever possible use thicker links, such as the LS-400, LS-475 or LS-500 series to provide more leeway. Calculations using LINK-SEAL® modular seal sizing Method 2 may indicate that a smaller link may be used when compared to data on the above chart. NOTE: This chart is based on using an average of two pipe size differential openings LS-615 Sizing Procedure - Method 2 Piping Specialties, Inc. | www.psi-team.com | 800-223-1468\n\n18. 18 MADE IN AMERICA VERIFICATION - LINK-SEAL® MODULAR SEAL SIZING The following charts will allow you to confirm the accuracy of this information. 1. Refer to the chart for the LINK-SEAL® modular seal size calculated in Sizing Procedure - Method 2. (LS-200, LS- 300 etc.) 2. Find the range your pipe O.D. falls within. (It may fall in either Range #1 or Range #2). You now have minimum and maximum wall opening dimensions. If your wall opening size falls between these dimensions, your LINK-SEAL® modular seal size is correct. You may also verify the number of links from column 6. If your wall opening size is not in the range indicated by the chart, either choose another LINK-SEAL® modular seal size, change your wall opening size or call GPT for assistance. Example LINK-SEAL® Size = LS-300 Actual Pipe O.D. = 2.900 Determine Minimum Wall Opening = 2.900 + 1.408 (from col. 4) Determine Maximum Wall Opening = 2.900 + 1.831 (from col. 5) 2.900 falls within Range #2 on LS-300 Chart Minimum Wall Opening = 2.900 + 1.408 = 4.308 Maximum Wall Opening = 2.900 + 1.831 = 4.731 Number of Links = 7 (from col. 6) Range #1 Pipe O.D.

Molded from non-conductive, high impact resistant HDPE, CENTURY-LINE® sleeves are lightweight and easily installed by one construction worker without use of cranes or hoists. They are available in 16 diameters ranging from 2” to 25” (51mm - 635mm) and shipped, from stock, in any desired length. FEATURES 16 sizes - 2” to 25” in diameter (Local stock, drop ship overnight) In the event of a field or engineering change, sleeves may be cut shorter at the job site using ordinary hand tools. Standard sleeves are 16” (406mm) in length. Longer length models may also be quickly fabricated as a custom ordered item. 1/8 the weight of steel CENTURY-LINE® sleeves are light enough for one worker to install without a crane, hoist or helper which reduces installation time and costs. CENTURY-LINE® sleeves are easy to stock and far less expensive to ship, when compared to steel sleeves. Resists water migration The 2” (50.8mm) water stop collar not only anchors the sleeve in position but creates a path against the migration of water around the outside of the sleeve. Adjusts to wall thickness CENTURY-LINE® sleeves’ unique hollow water stop collar acts like an expansion joint, adjusting (up to 1/2” - 12.7mm) to the thickness of the wall. This compressive force reacts against the forms like a spring, creating pressure and maintains proper sleeve location within the form. Nailer end caps position sleeve precisely in form Specially designed end caps provide an ideal method for attaching CENTURY-LINE® sleeves to the concrete forms. The end caps assure that the sleeve holds its circular configuration during the pour. In addition to keeping out wet concrete, they also prevent dirt from entering the sleeve during backfill operations or the interim construction period. Tough high density polyethylene (HDPE) construction High impact resistant HDPE also provides excellent resistance to acids, alkalins and other organic solvents. Ideal for cathodic protection systems, these non- conductive sleeves will neither rust, corrode or degrade. Low-temperature properties are such that they may be installed under any weather conditions suitable for pouring concrete. High temperature application limit is 150˚F (66˚C). The sleeve is molded with a texture on the outside surface to assure a better bond than most plastic to concrete interfaces. Used for shotcrete wall applications For shotcrete applications, CENTURY-LINE® sleeves are easily positioned to wall form with threaded rod, and the end caps protect the sleeve penetration while the wall is formed.

Piping Specialties, Inc. | www.psi-team.com | 800-223-1468\n\n30. 30 MADE IN AMERICA Sealing An Oversized Annulus THE DOUBLE ROW METHOD Sometimes the wall opening represents a differential up to five pipe sizes larger than the carrier pipe itself. This creates an annular space that is larger than the expanded thickness of a single LINK-SEAL® modular seal assembly. A typical example is a flanged spool piece or an existing opening where piping has been removed to make way for a new installation. As a result it is necessary to use an intermediate sleeve and another belt of LINK-SEAL® modular seals. Key design considerations when sizing an intermediate wall sleeve are: A. An intermediate sleeve must be used for a proper seal. B. The intermediate sleeve should be sized correctly to accommodate both belts of LINK-SEAL® modular seals. C. Be sure to support the actual carrier pipe properly. Neither belt of links should be responsible for supporting the carrier pipe. D. Let economics guide your selection when sizing LINK- SEAL® modular seals. However do not under size, refer to adjacent example or call GPT for sizing assistance 1-800-423-2410. Typical Application Wall Opening = 40” Cored Hole Carrier Pipe = 30” API Type (30.00” O.D.) This is a differential of five pipe sizes: (32, 34, 36, 38, 40) Solution: Use an inner belt of LS-400 and an outer belt of LS-500. Intermediate sleeve should be two pipe sizes larger than the 30” carrier pipe. A 34” pipe with a 3/8” wall would be an excellent choice. Checking the LINK-SEAL® modular seal sizing chart on page 11 indicates a 30 x 34 WS sleeve requires 27 links of LS-400. The outer sleeve of 34 x 40 will require 29 links of LS-500. For sizing assistance call our toll free number: 1-800-423-2410. Intermediate sleeves available, information pdf file on- line. Reduce Intermediate Sleeve Applications: Try eliminating your intermediate sleeve needs by sizing the model LS-650. Intermediate Sleeve Pressure Testing To determine the amount of pressure that has built up behind a LINK-SEAL® modular seal, install our “V” modification. It is a standard LINK-SEAL® modular seal assembly in which one link has a hole molded to accept a test probe. The probe has a NPT female connection and is inserted prior to tightening the assembly. The probe is firmly sealed by expansion of the rubber link. A pressure gauge can then be attached to monitor for leaks or pressure build-up.

Center the pipe, cable or conduit in wall opening or casing. Make sure the pipe will be adequately supported on both ends. LINK-SEAL® modular seals are not intended to support the weight of the pipe. 3. Check to be sure all bolt heads are facing the installer. Extra slack or sag is normal. Do not remove links if extra slack exists. NOTE: On smaller diameter pipe, links may need to be stretched. 4. Slide belt assembly into annular space. For larger size belts, start inserting LINK-SEAL® modular seal assembly at the 6 o'clock position and work both sides up toward the 12 o'clock position in the annular space. 5. LS-200 through LS-315 Using a hand socket allen head or off-set wrench ONLY, start at 12 o'clock. Do not tighten any bolt more than 4 turns at a time. Continue in a clockwise manner until links have been uniformly compressed. (Approx. 2 or 3 rotations) 5a.LS-325 through LS-650 Using a hand socket or off-set wrench ONLY, start at 12 o'clock. Do not tighten any bolt more than 4 turns at a time. Continue in a clockwise manner until links have been uniformly compressed (Approx. 2 or 3 rotations). 6. Make 2 or 3 more passes at 4 turns per bolt MAXIMUM, tightening all bolts clockwise until all sealing elements “bulge” around all pressure plates. On type 316 stainless steel bolts, hand tighten ONLY without power tool. 7. Ifthesealdoesn’tappeartobecorrect using the instructions provided, call GPT at 1-800-423-2410.

One person working alone can usually install a CENTURY-LINE®Sleeve regardless of the size. 1. Measure the center line to position CENTURY-LINE® Sleeve end cap. 2. Nail one of the end caps at the markedcenterline.A2”minimum clearance is suggested when nesting sleeves. 3. Place the CENTURY-LINE® Sleeve on the end cap. When field cutting non standard CS sleeve lengths, the sleeve and end caps total length should be ¼” longer than the thickness of the wall. Cut with a hand or power saw. NOTE: To insure minimum water migration, center the water stop in wall by cutting equal lengths from each end of the sleeve, except as noted below. 4. Place second end cap on sleeve. Check to determine that the cap is properly inserted. 5. For additional stability, it’s necessary to secure the sleeve with wire to the rebar. Insert the other end cap firmly, check that second end cap is positioned correctly, confirm sleeve length and close the form. 6. After the concrete is poured and cured, remove end caps with screw driver or crow bar. End caps may be replaced to protect sleeve until pipe penetration is made.
