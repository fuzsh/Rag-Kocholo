        "text": "Ashlyn Carter is a beacon of hope for every multi passionate entrepreneur out there who dreams of seven-figure success. Before she became a copywriting queen, she spent fourteen years as a ballerina dancing for audiences across the country. But when she finally received an invitation from Nashville Ballet to audition for a lead role and start a professional career, she knew it was time to give up that passion and pursue another.\n\n“That invitation let me know that I was good enough to be in a company,” says the successful writer. “I took that letter to mean that I could move on to other dreams.” And she did.\n\nCarter refocused the discipline, technique and art of storytelling she learned from her ballet upbringing into her passion for writing, spending six years working in public relations with Fortune 500 clients. Eventually she started her own business offering up copywriting services and educational resources to other creatives starting small businesses. Turns out, there are a lot of them. With the dust of 2020 finally settled, Americans are starting new businesses at the fastest rate in over a decade. Applications to start new businesses in the third quarter of 2020 increased nearly 20% compared to the same quarter in 2019—when we weren’t worried about COVID-19.\n\n“With companies cropping up online at lightspeed and the digital marketplace getting more crowded, your website has to do more heavy-lifting than ever before,” says Carter, who has worked with celebs in the online space like Amy Porterfield, Jenna Kutcher and Julie Solomon. “Your site can’t just be your 24/7 storefront, your website needs to help you stand out from the crowd. That’s quite a tall order.”\n\nI caught up with Carter to figure out exactly how this multi passionate entrepreneur narrowed her focus to create a million-dollar business, ways your website confuses your customer, how creative entrepreneurs are missing out on website sales and the best way to make your website stand out from the crowd.\n\nStephanie Burns: As a multi passionate entrepreneur, how did you decide which passion to pursue?\n\nAshlyn Carter: I gave my childhood passion a second chance. I knew from an early age I wanted to work in journalism or a related field, but I always felt too creative to be super-academic, and too bookish to be “artsy.” So I pursued classical ballet from kindergarten through college: it married technique and structure with expressive, emotive storytelling. I knew those elements would be key in any profession I chose. They're the same combo that attracted me to classic, copperplate calligraphy—that’s the style on formal wedding invitations which I did as a “moonlight” gig for years during the evenings after my corporate marketing job. So many envelope stacks! Those elements are also why copywriting felt right at home for me. There’s a science, an academic nuance to it, but there’s so much room for expression, experimentation, and artistry.\n\nBurns: Copywriting is a pretty specific niche within marketing. How did you discover it?\n\nCarter: Since I had a foot in the wedding and creative industry from calligraphy, I’d go to meet-ups in Atlanta and kept hearing sales concerns come up among the other entrepreneurs. They didn’t know how to explain their value on their website’s “About” or “Services” pages and they had trouble closing sales. That was the first time a lightbulb went off in my head: You mean some people don’t like to write for their business? It blew my mind. I started offering done-for-you services and bit by bit the moss ball started rolling down the hill because I knew their market so well.\n\nBurns: How did you grow your business to seven-figure success?\n\nCarter: I tweaked my process until I felt comfortable charging four figures for my brand messaging and copywriting work. Once I didn’t have the bandwidth to take on any more one-on-one clients myself, I hired two other writers to help me service clients. Eventually, I put my process into a done-with-you signature program, Copywriting for Creatives, to scale more—we were simply tapped out on bandwidth. It launched in 2016 under $300, and has now graduated more than 1,600 alumni and leveled out at $997 for lifetime curriculum access.\n\nBurns: Why bother learning how to write copy yourself—why not just have someone else write your web content?\n\nCarter: Done-for-you copy isn’t cheap, but there’s another reason to do this yourself. I compare writing your own site copy to knowing your numbers as an entrepreneur. Sure, math wasn’t my strongest suit growing up, but as a CEO, I need to be able to tell you my profit, tell you my expenses, run annual projections. Likewise, when you’re the CEO, you must be able to pitch me on why I should trust my money to you over your competition. Watch any episode of Shark Tank and you realize you’re D.O.A. without that skill. As an unexpected bonus, being able to clearly articulate your worth through your sales message is a shot of confidence.\n\nBurns: There are more people online than ever. What does it take these days to create a clear online presence and stand out with your website?\n\nCarter: If you’ve got to give me the entire background story or prep me before I read your homepage or services or whatever page copy, well, that’s a problem. If a potential client or customer can’t understand who you are, what you do, and how they can work with you as soon as they land on your website, your website’s costing you money, not making it.\n\nYour website needs a clear message that gives your reader that “get out of my head” moment. I almost want the copy to make the prospect wonder, “Is she reading my journal? How did she know that’s exactly what I need?” The best copy isn’t in your head. It’s in your audience member’s heads, and it’s your job to go out there and find it.\n\nBurns: Much of your process is data and numbers-based, which may seem surprising to some given that it’s writing. How do you link the two?\n\nCarter: In deciding what goes where on your website, or what message hits at what point in the customer journey, we need to be making data-driven decisions. Your emotions are a great tool, but they’re not “king” when you’re reworking or creating your websites and landing pages—facts are. We know the science behind how people read websites and what attracts their eye. Use what we know about eye tracking to your advantage when wireframing out your message and designing your site. Install and regularly check heatmaps on your website—there are so many great free tools out there you can find with a quick internet search! Don’t be intimidated to try A/B split testing, either. That can be a great way to pull your “I think this sounds better” emotions out of something and see what the data says. Be sure to let your split test run for around 100 conversions or a full-time period (ex. see which call-to-action button copy performs best from a Monday through the next Monday, for example) before calling a winner.\n\nBurns: What are some steps any entrepreneur can take right now to confidently ask for the sale on their website?\n\nCarter: We all know confused customers don’t buy, so be clear. Grease the slide by giving me very few hoops to jump through to find that payment button or description of your offerings. Use whitespace early and often. Work that top right hand navigation of your website with your most imperative links so I can get started working with you. Streamline that navigation bar with only what’s necessary.\n\nAlso, give me a 3-step sketch of how you’re going to get me what I’m looking for and then give me, what I call, the Starbucks Test. We’ve all been pitched something that helps you think, “Well, if I just sacrifice four coffee-shop purchases a month, I’d have enough for XYZ …” Look for ways to explain the cost to your client or customer using price anchors in language they understand.\n\nBurns: So often creative-types and entrepreneurs are told “follow your passion, the money will follow.” Do you think that holds true?\n\nCarter: You can absolutely find a job that’s life-giving that you’re passionate about. But then do the grunt work of thinking through how your experience, story, gifting, and interests overlap in a Venn diagram with some missing piece in the marketplace. Find the you-sized gap in the market and use it to brand yourself.\n\nOnce you’ve done that, figure out what number is “enough” for you and your family, hit that sales goal and then rest! If you realize you’re good at sales and can make more without sacrificing your priorities—faith, family, friends—then go for it. We all have a responsibility to make—with integrity—as much as we can, so we can give as much as we can.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
