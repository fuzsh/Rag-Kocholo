        "text": "So a buddy of mine separated from active duty Air Force and decided he wanted to pursue IT as a career. He had been Security Forces in the Air Force, but is pretty damn good with computers from a client side perspective, so it made sense to try it out. He called around to a few places, and then found New Horizons. That's when the trouble started.\n\nHis primary concern was that he wanted actual vocational tech style training, but that was certification based so he knew that he was getting industry relevant information. He did NOT want to sit through boot camps, since he knew he didn't have the background experience to be able to pass a test with that kind of training. Plus he doesn't retain information well when it's firehosed at him like that.\n\nHe was ASSURED by New Horizons that they were NOT boot camps, but actual classes. His other concern was that he was going to be using GI Bill to pay for all of this, so how long was it going to take? Being that you get a stipend with the Post 9/11 GI Bill (and being as he was going to be going to school full time) he wanted to know how many months of benefits he could look forward to. They told him it would be 11 months of training. They sent a training plan to the VA for validation, who also agreed it would be 11 months.\n\nHe started training, and immediately found out that they were boot camps. He complained, they told him that it was classroom training, not a boot camp. I don't know how anyone can do ICND1 and ICND2 prep classes that are 5 days each and not call it a boot camp. They rammed him through Network+, A+, and CCNA boot camps over a 2 1/2 month period (the Net+ class was actually decent, it took 3 weeks.) Then they started telling him that they were concerned he hadn't taken and passed any cert tests yet. He told them he wasn't ready, that he needed more time to study. They told him that he needed to start passing tests or be dropped from the program for lack of progress. He told them he couldn't/wouldn't do that, and they promptly removed him from the program and told the VA he wasn't participating, so his benefits stopped.\n\nSo in my opinion, New Horizons can go to hell with their deceptive recruiting and terrible training classes.\n\n0 ·\n\nI got into a vocational training program through the Veterans Administration after losing my job a few years ago. I wasn't really sure what I was looking for but somehow I convinced myself and the VA of a plan on some certifications that would be helpful in landing a job. I knew I would not like the idea of sitting in my basement watching videos for training. A live stream to me is only a slightly less desirable level of hell. I wanted to go to a school to learn from a live person. Turns out the VA has a preference for on-site learning as well. That meant New Horizons or a community college for certification training.\n\nSo the VA set me up with New Horizons and I was not happy. My \"training\" for Network+ was sitting in a cold room with headphones on to watch videos. I could have done that in my basement, only I would not have had to wear the crappy headphones. There were some Flash based \"labs\" which consisted mostly of multiple choice questions. There were other people in the room also with headphones on, none of them taking the same training. One guy I remember was also a veteran, he was taking Adobe training.\n\nThe Cisco training sucked. Like others have noted there were some people in class that were not motivated to learn the material. Would not have been much of an issue if I was not forced into pairing up with people in completing the labs. One guy I was paired with did not know the material and was taking the class from home, I could hear him talking to his wife. Note that this was during lab time when the microphone was on, during lecture time only the instructor could be heard. No one in the building knew anything about Cisco. I had no one to answer my questions face to face. Trying to communicate through the computer with the instructor was painful because of the lag, poor audio quality, no video, and once the class is over the instructor is gone. Since I was in a classroom with other students not taking the same class I did not want to use the microphone and disturb them, so I typed my questions in the chat window.\n\nMy first account manager at New Horizons was terrible. She could not seem to order the right practice exam software and seemed to have troubles getting my exam vouchers. I complained to the VA about New Horizons and I got a different account manager. Not sure if those two events were coincidence or not. New Horizons was providing Transcender practice exams with the classes, they are OK for multiple guess exams from CompTIA but next to worthless for Cisco which has simulations in the exams.\n\nThings did get better. I was allowed to re-take some of the Cisco training. I got paired with someone that gave a damn during labs. I was still stuck in a cold classroom. I learned to bring my own headphones. The new account manager would check on my progress at least once per day while I was in class, and kept in touch by phone and e-mail to make sure I was on track to take my exams.\n\nI found work for a while and my training was on hold at New Horizons since I could not do both. I picked it back up after my contract work was over. I had Security+ in a real classroom, with a real instructor, with students that cared. It was great compared to before.\n\nI'm taking a CASP course now with New Horizons. The instructor is mediocre. He seems to know the material, just not how to teach it. The course is supposed to be six hours a day (eight hour day, hour for lunch, half hour break in morning and afternoon) over five days. We've been leaving the class at least an hour early everyday, and he gives long lunch times. Today he scheduled two hours for lunch. I had probably four hours of lecture today. He stopped lecture early and most of the students left the teleconference at that time. Myself and a handful of other students hung out for about an hour and had a Q&A session about course material and general IT stuff. There were no other students in the physical classroom but the microphone didn't work for the virtual classroom. I was still forced to type my questions.\n\nI complained to the VA about the training I was getting at New Horizons before I started the CASP training. My VA counselor informed me that they paid for all my training up front so I had to complete the training program New Horizons created before I could ask for something else. I know that is a lie, I don't HAVE to go back to New Horizons, but the VA counselor is too lazy to try to get their money back and find me new training. That is an issue with the VA, not New Horizons. I'm just explaining why I'm putting up with the crappy training at New Horizons right now.\n\nI have CEH training with New Horizons coming up. This will be with a real live instructor in the classroom. At least that is what they are telling me now. If it's not then I'll grin and bear it because the VA told me to.\n\nSince this is the CCNA/CCENT forum I'll expand on my Cisco training some more. I took the CCNA bootcamp and the three CCNP bootcamps at New Horizons. The CCNA bootcamp was as good as one could expect from an instructor located in another state. I failed the CCNA exam twice before I decided to take it in smaller chunks. I passed the ICND1 exam on the first try. I failed the ICND2 exam once or twice before life got in the way and I had to step away from that for a while.\n\nThe CCNP training was too much for me. That was my bad, I didn't realize at the time that CCNP was intended for a much more experienced audience. I just wasted my time and the VA money doing that. I saw how much the VA was paying, I wasted a *LOT* of money.\n\nThe New Horizons near me does not offer Cisco testing. I had to go to another New Horizons that was a two hour drive away for that. Not sure if that reflects poorly on New Horizons or Cisco, either way that was not fun. The weather on one of those drives was cold and very windy, saw a semi truck blown over in the ditch kind of windy.\n\nMy experience with New Horizons was mixed at best. I'd only choose to go back if I knew the training was with a live in-person instructor and I knew the instructor was competent. With what New Horizons training costs I'd have to be either making good money or have someone else pay for it. Sounds like the VA is not pleased with New Horizons, other veterans must have been complaining too. Problem is that around here it's a pretty captive audience, not too much competition within 150 miles of here.\n\nMacGuffin - A plot device, an item or person that exists only to produce conflict among the characters within the story.\n\n0 ·"
