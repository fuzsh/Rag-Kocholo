        "text": "From Chicago tech anchors like Morningstar, Grubhub and Braintree to promising up-and-comers like BallotReady and LuminAID, one thing is certain: the strength of our tech ecosystem has much to thank the University of Chicago for.\n\nThis year in particular marks a monumental anniversary for the university — a feat not so easily achieved, given its long history of excellence in entrepreneurialism.\n\nEarlier this year, the Edward L. Kaplan (‘71) New Venture Challenge celebrated its 20th anniversary. Over the years, NVC has become one of the primary motors driving innovation in Chicago. Today, there are more than 140 companies in operation that have participated in the event, and those companies have collectively garnered more than $430 million in outside funding and more than $3.7 billion in exit mergers and exits.\n\nAnd those figures don’t even take into account businesses started by a diverse group of alumni from UChicago, Booth School of Business and other programs at the school not associated with NVC.\n\nIn honor of all of the entrepreneurial talent that’s been cultivated at the University of Chicago, NVC, Booth and beyond, here are 50 Chicago alumni and entrepreneurs shaping a future for Chicago tech.\n\nBrian Clark, CEO and co-founder\n\nClark is a current MBA candidate in economics, entrepreneurship and statistics from Booth.

Graduates who have not founded companies but who fill other leadership positions have also not been considered.\n\nImages via LinkedIn/Shutterstock."
