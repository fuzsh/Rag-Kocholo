        "text": "The job market is finally opening up\n\nRight now, Director of Product opportunities are being promoted on LinkedIn at Reddit, Google, MongoDB, Meta, Ramp, Netflix, and many more‚Ä¶\n\nThe sexiest, highest paying companies in tech are hiring leaders again. Folks who have been unemployed for several months, or were sitting tight for the last few years, are landing jobs they consider upgrades.\n\nIt‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúso-so‚Äù market. It‚Äôs heating up. Of the 12 product leaders talked to for this piece, 7 have been regularly receiving recruiter outreach messages.\n\nGiven the new state of the market, I thought it would be the perfect time to discuss the critical meta that should govern a product leadership job search.\n\nIntroducing Colin Lernell\n\nWho better to write with than someone who has done that job search many times?\n\nI‚Äôm excited to introduce Colin Lernell. Colin has been a Senior Director of Product at Patreon, Noom, and Udacity. He has also landed offers for roles as a public company VP, a big tech Director, and an early stage CPO.\n\nColin writes the Top Tech newsletter, coaches product leaders seeking or negotiating job offers, and has experience from both sides of the product leadership job search.\n\nWarning: This Might Make You Money\n\nThere‚Äôs a huge range of pay disparity amongst product leadership roles. Two rules govern these disparities.\n\nFirst, the stage/revenue of the company determines your range:\n\nIf you‚Äôre not venture-backed, you can also roughly align these as: series A to $10M revenue, series C $10M, series E $500M, small/mid cap $1B, FAANG $100B.\n\nSecond, the success of your company has a huge impact. For instance:\n\nTop-end VPs at highly successful Series C companies can make $400K base and $600K in equity\n\nOn the other hand, New VPs at struggling Series C companies can make $225K base and $300K in equity\n\nThat‚Äôs a TC difference of about 2x, or $475K per year.\n\nBetween those two rules, if you are able to move to a higher stage company or a more successful company, it will mean millions of dollars over the course of your career.\n\nToday‚Äôs Post\n\nWords: 21,600 | Est. Reading Time: 98 mins\n\nWe‚Äôve talked to 7 external Executive Recruiters, 2 internal big tech Executive Recruiters, 2 VC talent teams, and 12 CPOs/ VPs about the product leadership job search. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve found:\n\nHow product leadership (Director to CPO) searches are different\n\nüîí How recruiting firms and VC talent teams actually work\n\nüîí How to find opportunities as a product leader\n\nüîí How to land and negotiate offers as a product leader\n\nüîí Bonus: Tips for hiring product leaders\n\n1. How product leader (Director to CPO) searches are different\n\n1.1 The (Actually) Hidden Job Market for Product Leaders\n\nBy my guess, anywhere from 10-30% of Director+ product roles never are posted. And as you reach the C-Suite, it goes to 70-100%.\n\n‚ÄîProduct Leader for 10 years, current VP\n\nAt the Director level and above, the game changes entirely.\n\nThe stakes are higher\n\nThe competition fiercer\n\nThe opportunities more elusive\n\nAnd here‚Äôs the thing: many of these top-tier roles never see the light of day on public job boards.\n\nThey're stealth missions. Companies often kick off these searches before they have a finalized job description. Companies post these roles much less often for a variety of reasons:\n\nThey don‚Äôt want the press to speculate\n\nThey don‚Äôt want the current leaders to know\n\nThey don‚Äôt want lots of low quality applicants\n\nThis is where your executive recruiter and VC connections become your secret weapon. They know about these under-the-radar opportunities long before the rest of us catch a whiff.\n\n1.2 The Critical Role of Executive Recruiters and VCs for Leadership Roles\n\nC-suite executives early on in my career told me the best thing to do is to find great exec recruiters and build long-term relationships with them. This has served me well - they know and trust me after I get offers or pass interviews. I know and trust them to market me properly and prep me/take care of me during the process.\n\n‚ÄîColin, 3x Senior Product Leader\n\nIt‚Äôs not like your prior job searches\n\nContrast this leadership job market with the landscape for individual contributors (ICs). Sure, there are exceptions where ICs look more like leadership searches - roles requiring extremely niche skills or deep industry expertise.\n\nBut by and large, most IC positions will eventually find their way onto the usual job posting sites. Recruiters can still add value here, but they're more of a bonus than a necessity.\n\nFor leadership roles, though? Ignore them at your peril.\n\n(And if you‚Äôve had poor encounters with recruiting firms in the past? It is probably because they were contingency-based firms trying to compete to fill a role, and not the retainer-based executive search firms.)\n\nHow the job search changes as you rise up the leadership ranks\n\nSources:\n\n*Executive Recruiter, VC, and Executive Leader first-hand experiences and estimates\n\n**Riviera Partners US (VP, CPO) Executive Compensation Report and VC Firm (Director to CPO) Executive Compensation Surveys\n\nShare\n\nBut you can‚Äôt sit back\n\nBut here's the thing - you can't just sit back and wait for them to come knocking. Not even if you're a bona fide rockstar in your field.\n\nSome inbound interest may trickle in, sure. But the real magic happens when you take the reins and proactively cultivate these relationships.\n\nThat‚Äôs what we‚Äôll cover in today‚Äôs piece.\n\nWhen executive recruiters and VC firms are involved\n\nSo when do companies enlist the services of recruiters and tap into their VC networks to fill a role? There are 5 main situations where external help is needed:\n\nNo Internal Expertise or Capacity\n\nBusiness Critical Roles\n\nSpecific Skill Set\n\nSpeed is of the Essence\n\nCompany‚Äôs Pedigree is Lacking\n\nOften, only external executive recruiters can give high-priority searches the white-glove treatment they require.\n\nExec search is a lot more consultative/strategic than IC recruiting\n\n‚ÄîVidur Dewan, 8yr Recruiter, Partner at Artisanal Talent\n\n1.3 How Product Leaders are Evaluated Differently\n\nThree main criteria are used:\n\nReputation\n\nOutcomes & Impact\n\nDomain Expertise\n\nBut First, A Warning: The Criteria Will Evolve\n\nA lot changes during the 2-7 month search process for a product leader.\n\nIn the first few weeks, employers will speak with many candidates as they are still figuring out exactly what they want and need from a role. They have only conducted these searches every 2-4 years, if ever. So, they do not have a great first frame of reference for what they need until they see a variety of candidates.\n\nThis means you need to have patience in your search and are likely to speak with companies who do not yet have their criteria solidified.\n\nIt is very common for companies to start with very strict criteria:\n\ni.e. ‚ÄúWe only consider candidates from top companies at our stage or higher, in our market, at this exact seniority level, who have done exactly what we need before successfully.‚Äù\n\nBut that often slowly shifts to tangential markets, up and coming candidates doing a level jump, and candidates who had a large impact at lesser known companies.\n\nSome criteria is also very company, role, and hiring manager specific:\n\nExpert vs. Generalist\n\nStrategic vs. Player-Coach\n\nBeen There vs. Up-and-Comer\n\nIn-the-weeds vs. High-level narrative\n\nYou will need to leverage your recruiter or company contact to understand what they are looking for, how to interpret that, and how you fit their criteria.\n\nA pretty common thing that we help clients work through is whether they need someone that has super specific domain experience or if what they really need is a general athlete with best in class experience from a tangential high growth company.\n\nThe other piece that is common...Do we need the person that has seen this journey before and is a tried and true leader, or do we feel like the more up and coming step up candidate will actually be hungrier and will be willing to put in the work that we need them to at this stage?\n\n‚ÄîTheresa Skelly, Director at Riviera Partners\n\nCriteria 1: Reputation\n\nDirector is the point at which it goes from ‚Äúwhat I‚Äôve done and how I did it‚Äù to ‚Äúmy reputation‚Äù‚Ä¶and ‚Äúreal business outcomes‚Äù‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs why network becomes a lot more important.\n\n‚Äî Ken Sandy, 27Y product leader, CPO Coach, Author of The Influential Product Manager\n\nThe consensus among the executive recruiters and hiring managers we spoke with is that your reputation is one of the most important criteria for landing a role.\n\nThere are a few important signals for reputation:\n\nDid you work for reputable companies?\n\nDid you work for reputable leaders and managers?\n\nDid you advance quickly at those companies with promotions?\n\nBut even more importantly‚Ä¶\n\nWill reputable people speak highly of your accomplishments?\n\nWill they verify a role is within your ‚Äúceiling‚Äù as a leader?\n\nThis validation from a trusted third party is necessary because:\n\nIt helps isolate whether you achieved outcomes by your own merits or just benefited from the company‚Äôs trajectory\n\nTo be successful as a leader, you need to build buy in and respect to have long-term impact at a company as it scales. How people perceive your achievements is nearly as important as achieving them.\n\nThis has 3 important implications for your job search:\n\n1. Intros matter\n\nBecause reputation is arguably more important than on-paper results at leadership levels, cold outreach is less effective than at IC levels**.**\n\nIf you want to get connected with a hiring manager, an executive recruiter, or any decision maker at a company, you will first want to get a warm introduction from someone who can speak highly of you.\n\nPast managers or executives, past colleagues, mentors, or even executive recruiters you have worked with in the past can all be potential connectors.\n\nColin has coached product leaders who were successful at cold outreach, but generally an introduction is going to be necessary.\n\n2. Backchannels are always done\n\nWhether you agree with the practice or not, some clients wouldn't even have a first conversation unless we had at least 1-2 backdoor references from people they trust or know.\n\n‚ÄîMatt Johnson, 13yr Recruiter, Founder/CEO of Paradigm Search, ex-Daversa\n\nNone of the Executive Recruiters or executives we spoke with have hired someone without running a backchannel reference.\n\nThis means that at some point in the process, they are contacting your past manager, executives, or colleagues through someone in their network.\n\n3. Tenure matters\n\nAccording to Andrew Abramson ‚Äî a 10 year executive recruiting veteran and ex-Partner at Riviera who founded Fusion Talent ‚Äî leaving jobs too soon and creating a track record of job-hopping is the \"single biggest thing killing a career‚Äôs momentum.\"\n\nIt creates a \"perception by hiring managers that they won't stick around.\" Andrew advises that \"a good stint is 3 years if no exit outside your control\" and cautions against \"back to back 1 year stints.\"\n\nIf you are coming off a short stint, \"don't just take the next job\" - do deep referencing on that company/culture to ensure you'll be set up for success.\n\nAndrew also suggests going to high quality companies and warns against taking risky roles at early stage startups just to gain more scope. Even if you are CPO and do a good job, \"You could find yourself looking again in a year due to factors that are completely outside of your control.‚Äù\n\nFair or not, this will stop many future employers from considering you if it is a repeated pattern.\n\nCriteria 2: Outcomes & Impact\n\nDon‚Äôt just list accomplishments as shipping a certain number of features. This signals a feature factory mentality. Instead, focus on the outcomes and impact, like incremental revenue or new channels.\n\n‚ÄîAndrew Abramson, 10yr Recruiter, Founder of Fusion, ex-Riviera & Korn Ferry\n\nAt the Director level and above, it is no longer enough to launch features, discuss how you did it, and talk about the product metrics you impacted.\n\nYou will need to start demonstrating significant tangible business impact from your work. That means increasing revenue, north star metric improvements, and strategically important outcomes.\n\nIt can also mean helping a company get to a successful IPO or acquisition, or even scaling a team 10x (though beware to whom you are talking about that‚Äîfor a certain political class in Silicon Valley, org building is the now enemy).\n\nOutcome Facet 1 - Company success\n\nOne signal of your impact and outcomes is having a long stint at a high growth successful company. That doesn‚Äôt mean you had to be CPO, but if you were accomplished and promoted frequently at a top tier company that was doing well, this will signal that you can make an impact that matters.\n\nOne mistake leaders make is optimizing for scope over quality of company, especially if you don't already have a great company on your resume. Founders look first at the best companies a candidate has worked at that had high growth. Even joining at the highest level at an earlier stage startup can prevent you from gaining this reputation for being a winner.\n\n‚ÄúWinners win.‚Äù is a quote recruiters often hear from founders. They assume that someone at a successful company during its growth phase will continue to win.\n\nOutcome Facet 2 - Your measurable impact\n\nIt should be obvious by this point in your career that you need to show demonstrated, measurable impact in your narrative and resume. What changes at the leadership level is the scope and level of that impact.\n\nMeaningful impact is typically a significant improvement in revenue, profit, or users. It can also be a significant strategic win.\n\nThis is tied to tenure at a company. It typically takes several years to have a meaningful impact on a company‚Äôs business trajectory.\n\nCriteria 3: Domain Expertise\n\nMultiple Executive Recruiters we interviewed mentioned how important domain expertise was to hiring managers for product leaders.\n\nWhen they develop the ‚Äúideal candidate profile‚Äù (ICP) with the client, they often have a specific domain, team size managed, specific stage, and similar challenges faced.\n\nThey want to know that you faced similar challenges and built the necessary processes and infrastructure in a similar context.\n\nThis is unsurprising psychology by employers. They want to de-risk the hire as much as possible, and the best way to do this is by hiring someone who has ‚Äúbeen there and done that.‚Äù If you do not perfectly match the ICP, you will need to show how your experience is analogous or tangential at least.\n\nFor All Criteria: Career trajectory\n\nA heavily used heuristic for both a reputable and outcome-oriented candidate is whether they have a fast trajectory of getting promoted and increasing their scope.\n\nA benchmark pace for promotions is every 12-18 months for top candidates. At least they should be increasing their scope and impact if not their level.\n\nThe opposite is true, too. If a candidate is stuck at the same level for several years, they could be screened out before anyone talks to them.\n\nThere is a paradox for leveling for leaders.\n\nThe same recruiters and hiring managers will say both:\n\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want title and scope-chasers with an ego‚Äù\n\nand\n\n‚ÄúWe want to see title and scope growth‚Äù\n\nKen Sandy, who has been a Director+ since the 90s and helps CPOs build teams, says that ‚Äútitles do matter‚Äù. If you go to VP or CPO at a reasonably mature company, ‚Äúonce you‚Äôre in, you‚Äôre in.‚Äù\n\nBalancing the advice of quality of company vs. scope-chasing vs. title progression is something I have personally struggled with. I turned down a public company VP role in 2021 and then a Series B CPO role and a public company VP role in 2022 for a Series F Sr. Director role because of the perceived quality of a company. The net impact of those decisions is still to be seen, but each company thinks about it very differently.\n\n‚ÄîColin Lernell, 3x Sr. Director of Product\n\n1.4 How Product Leaders are Compensated Differently\n\nBig jumps\n\nThere are increasingly big jumps in compensation as you move into leadership and up the leadership seniority ladder.\n\nA Director can make 1.5-2x what a Group PM or Principal makes.\n\nA VP can make much more equity than a Director, sometimes 2x TC\n\nA CPO has such a varied TC that top candidates make multiple millions per year\n\nHighly variable\n\nThe variability in compensation is also much wider as you increase in seniority.\n\nColin once received a growth-stage Director offer for $450K and another for $850K in the same week.\n\nData sources change\n\nFinding accurate and reliable compensation data at the leadership levels is also a mystery to new leaders. Other than a few Director roles at FAANG+, you are unlikely to get many data points from the typical sources like Levels.fyi or Blind that you used as an IC.\n\nInstead, you will want to use your Executive Recruiters, VCs, and fellow executives to find both the survey and anecdotal research you need.\n\nSo how much do they make?\n\nMany of you will be familiar with Nikhyl Singhal ‚Äî he is a VP at Meta, ex-CPO at Credit Karma, and coach to 100+ product leaders over his career.\n\nHe provided this chart in 2021 as a rule of tumb for ‚Äúelite‚Äù (meaning top of market) leadership candidates in tier 1 US tech cities and companies. He claims that this was consistent for several years, with some years (like 2021/early 2022) going above and other years tracking slightly below. 2023 was a tougher year, but this has started to return.\n\nIf we compare that to the top 25% of offers in 2024‚Äôs Riviera Partners Compensation Report, we actually see higher numbers this year:\n\nVP Product, Series A+, $1B+ valuation\n\nCash: $390K\n\nEquity: 0.25% ($625K+/year)\n\nCPO, Series B, $100M-$300M valuation\n\nCash: $450K\n\nEquity: 1.75% (median was >1%)\n\nThe VC survey data aligns closely with this.\n\nNote that anecdotally we have heard from recent Directors who landed roles coming in at lower TC for growth-stage companies. This was mostly due to lower equity grants. Recent data from equity management platform Carta has shown the same, but this is starting to increase again.\n\nVPs at Meta or Google can make $4m+, while tier 1 big tech company CPOs can make into the $X0M range. Chris Cox, CPO at Meta, made $23M last year, with $18.5M in stock awards.\n\nHow power dynamics change\n\nAnother major difference in the job search for product leaders is the amount of power an employer has vs. you.\n\nIf you are a serious candidate, you are not only allowed to reverse interview and vet the company just like they are assessing your fit for them, you are often expected to do this.\n\nNot doing so can be treated as a red flag.\n\n1.5 Product Leadership Hiring Trends\n\nThe Executive Recruiters and Product Executives we spoke with shared some trends they are seeing in the job market today and how product leaders should adapt.\n\nTrend 1 - There are more great candidates than jobs.\n\nMany candidates are getting to final round interviews. They're being beat out by equally amazing people. And sometimes it comes down to preference. You may be a great fit for the role. Your feedback was probably positive across the board, but that there was just preference for somebody else.\n\nThere was nothing you could have done better in the process. It was just a decision that was made at the top to go with one individual over you‚Ä¶Sometimes the board will overrule the founder.\n\n‚ÄîBobby Gormsen, Head of Talent at Etsy through IPO and Frame.io through Adobe acquisition. 20yr Executive Recruiter and Director at Paradigm\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nKeep your chin up. And, keep your pipeline full, even if you have amazing final rounds.\n\nTrend 2 - More companies are looking for ‚Äúhands-on VPs‚Äù\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nDon‚Äôt downplay your scale, but check with the recruiter about which profile the company wants and tune your narrative accordingly\n\nTrend 3 - Companies are hiring fewer Director-level roles despite many new Directors promoted during ZIRP\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nAdvice from an experienced product leader: If you are a new (<2yr) Director and did not have enough time to make a big impact in your first role, it may make sense to get a Principal or Group PM level role to create an impact in today‚Äôs market. There is no shame in being a builder again. Play the long game.\n\nTrend 4 - There are more ‚ÄúGeneral Manager‚Äù (GM)-style Product leader roles\n\nI just placed a GM candidate recently. Many companies are now hiring product leaders into GM roles who own a P&L and run more than just product teams.\n\n‚ÄîBobby Gormsen, Head of Talent at Etsy through IPO and Frame.io through Adobe acquisition. 20yr Executive Recruiter and Director at Paradigm\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nExplore GM roles, especially if you have cross-functional operator experience or strong company-level strategy chops\n\nTrend 5 - There are more and new resources to leverage in your search\n\nNetwork, network, network. The macro shift has transformed the executive recruiting landscape. Many Talent Partners at VC and PE firms are now building supporting teams to handle executive-level searches previously outsourced to search firms. Network with these talent functions. Simultaneously, top partners from firms like True Search, Artisanal Talent, and Daversa have left to start their own firms. Network with these new firms‚Äîthey're getting more opportunities than the old ones.\n\n‚ÄîAlex Klein, Nucleus Talent, ex-Partner at Artico and ex-True Search\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nNetwork much more\n\nLook beyond the top firms for new boutiques\n\nUtilize VC and Private Equity talent teams\n\n‚Ä¶But how can executive recruiters and VCs help me?\n\nNow that you know how the leadership search is different, you need to understand how to leverage the new players in the game.\n\n2. How Recruiting Firms and VC Talent Teams Actually Work\n\nWhy is it that when you talk to 8 different people at Daversa Partners, they all act like you‚Äôre meeting you for the first time and have access to different roles?\n\n‚Äî3x VP of Product\n\nIt's a common experience - you're talking to multiple people at the same recruiting firm or VC talent arm, but it feels like each conversation is starting from square one.\n\nThey seem to have no CRM, different roles, different information, and different priorities.\n\nSo what's really going on behind the scenes?\n\nWe interviewed people at top recruiting firms and VC HR arms to get the inside scoop on how they operate, and what it means for you as a product leader."
