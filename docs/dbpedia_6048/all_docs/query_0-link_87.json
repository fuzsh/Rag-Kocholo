T. And A. C. T. Exams\n\n[00:02:25.610]\n\nyears and years ago.\n\n[00:02:27.139]\n\nAnd of course it's great to have this content available\n\n[00:02:29.419]\n\nonline.

Being able to prepare\n\n[00:02:33.650]\n\nfor college and career related tests.\n\n[00:02:35.800]\n\nWe have online practice tests built\n\n[00:02:38.030]\n\nright into the resource with immediate\n\n[00:02:40.158]\n\nratings. you can check your score, see how\n\n[00:02:42.199]\n\nyou did retake exams, stream\n\n[00:02:44.348]\n\ncruel.\n\n[00:02:45.340]\n\nUm\n\n[00:02:46.438]\n\nalong with the e book content that comes along\n\n[00:02:48.759]\n\nwith those tasks so you can,\n\n[00:02:50.740]\n\nyou know, take advantage of not just\n\n[00:02:52.788]\n\nthe practice test but also the\n\n[00:02:54.860]\n\ncontent that helps you prepare and\n\n[00:02:57.389]\n\nget ready for those those exams.\n\n[00:03:00.438]\n\nOh I apologize, I've got my\n\n[00:03:02.479]\n\nanimations a bit out of order here.\n\n[00:03:04.598]\n\nUm but that's fine, it's all good stuff.\n\n[00:03:07.120]\n\nSo this resource also\n\n[00:03:09.210]\n\ncan help you find a college,\n\n[00:03:11.560]\n\nyou have searches that help\n\n[00:03:13.688]\n\nyou narrow down to the uh\n\n[00:03:15.759]\n\nyou know type of school you're looking for.

So take a look at those.\n\n[00:04:01.038]\n\nThis resource also has a great resume\n\n[00:04:03.430]\n\ncreator tool. Somebody may be familiar\n\n[00:04:05.610]\n\nwith visual C. V.

You feel good\n\n[00:04:30.600]\n\nabout sending out to companies and sharing,\n\n[00:04:32.730]\n\nbut also help for getting it to the right\n\n[00:04:35.120]\n\nhand, right the right companies, finding the places\n\n[00:04:37.480]\n\nyou want to be, even taking it a step\n\n[00:04:39.680]\n\nfurther, so it might surround maybe salary\n\n[00:04:42.009]\n\nnegotiation and things like that.\n\n[00:04:44.009]\n\nSo lots of good advice here\n\n[00:04:46.060]\n\nfor those seeking a new career\n\n[00:04:48.290]\n\nor really just a job change whenever\n\n[00:04:50.610]\n\nthey may be interested in\n\n[00:04:53.139]\n\nremember.\n\n[00:04:54.338]\n\nAnd then also this\n\n[00:04:56.490]\n\nwill help kind of bolster apologize folks again,\n\n[00:04:58.620]\n\nI have these a bit out of order um finding\n\n[00:05:01.110]\n\na career that's best due to do you. So\n\n[00:05:03.269]\n\nthere's a career assessment tool that walks\n\n[00:05:05.300]\n\nyou through, answering\n\n[00:05:07.639]\n\nonce you if you're basically a questionnaire looking\n\n[00:05:10.088]\n\nfor where what type of industry\n\n[00:05:12.290]\n\nyou might be a good fit for, then\n\n[00:05:14.319]\n\nof course you can dig deeper finding based\n\n[00:05:16.838]\n\njobs based sorry, careers\n\n[00:05:19.269]\n\nbased on those assessments and looking\n\n[00:05:21.540]\n\nat overview. So what's expected out of that\n\n[00:05:23.649]\n\njob with a salary range, that type of\n\n[00:05:25.649]\n\nthing. And then there's even a\n\n[00:05:27.899]\n\nlink out to content to search for\n\n[00:05:30.100]\n\nopen positions. So folks who are actively\n\n[00:05:32.199]\n\nlooking for a new job right\n\n[00:05:34.379]\n\nnow you got to see what's out there.\n\n[00:05:37.040]\n\nSo lots of good stuff in this resource\n\n[00:05:39.659]\n\nand they all kind of fit together nicely.\n\n[00:05:42.159]\n\nSo we want to walk you through how to get to this\n\n[00:05:44.209]\n\ncontent,\n\n[00:05:45.338]\n\nwhat you can expect from it and kind of putting\n\n[00:05:47.579]\n\nit to work. So\n\n[00:05:49.240]\n\nlet's go ahead and jump in and navigate the resource.\n\n[00:05:52.639]\n\nSo I've got to have a lot of down here\n\n[00:05:54.649]\n\nto the homepage and\n\n[00:05:56.639]\n\nthe resource is divided into four\n\n[00:05:58.909]\n\ncategories. Improve your score\n\n[00:06:01.060]\n\nis a section that's going to\n\n[00:06:03.209]\n\nallow you to find content to\n\n[00:06:06.040]\n\nfrom different tests.\n\n[00:06:08.939]\n\nSo a variety of sections\n\n[00:06:11.240]\n\nhere, we've also got again find\n\n[00:06:13.569]\n\nour finest school. So we've got\n\n[00:06:15.610]\n\nthe scholarship search information.\n\n[00:06:17.660]\n\nThey're linked to the college planning center,\n\n[00:06:19.899]\n\nwhich is really handy. And we're going to dig deeper into\n\n[00:06:21.990]\n\nthese. I just want to give you the basics here.\n\n[00:06:24.100]\n\nStart there's also the explorers\n\n[00:06:26.360]\n\ncareer section that's where you would find the resume\n\n[00:06:28.629]\n\nbuilder, the career tools in the\n\n[00:06:30.680]\n\nlife. And that is very protective\n\n[00:06:32.990]\n\nfor vocational test prep.\n\n[00:06:35.338]\n\nVariety of tests available there.\n\n[00:06:37.360]\n\nSo there's a lot of content here, we\n\n[00:06:39.379]\n\nwon't of course be able to go into everything.\n\n[00:06:41.420]\n\nSo again do share in the chat\n\n[00:06:43.649]\n\nor the Q. And A. And if there's anything in particular you\n\n[00:06:45.720]\n\nwant to look at.\n\n[00:06:47.139]\n\nSo for library staff, I really\n\n[00:06:49.278]\n\nlike the four boxes here to\n\n[00:06:51.329]\n\nkind of browse around and see what's here.\n\n[00:06:53.579]\n\nSo, you know, which\n\n[00:06:56.180]\n\ntest prep to do. We have, you know,\n\n[00:06:58.209]\n\ndo we have the firefighter exam? Do we have the asvab\n\n[00:07:00.389]\n\nyou can kind of\n\n[00:07:01.639]\n\nquickly get the list there.\n\n[00:07:04.040]\n\nIt's also again, a good way to get comfortable\n\n[00:07:06.060]\n\nwith what's here. So again, so you know what to expect,\n\n[00:07:08.269]\n\nyou know, when to recommend this resource.\n\n[00:07:10.939]\n\nWe've also added a search right on the homepage.\n\n[00:07:13.139]\n\nYou can dive right in with a search for,\n\n[00:07:15.170]\n\nsay, S. A. T. And get taken right to that contact.\n\n[00:07:18.240]\n\nSo the search is handy as well.\n\n[00:07:20.290]\n\nYou know what you're after?\n\n[00:07:27.139]\n\nWe've got a question what job boards\n\n[00:07:29.259]\n\nis the is the job search link\n\n[00:07:31.480]\n\nto? Great question Diane.\n\n[00:07:33.540]\n\nAnd\n\n[00:07:35.639]\n\noh, gosh, of course I'll know\n\n[00:07:37.750]\n\nit. Of course. The minute we pull it up in the resource,\n\n[00:07:39.829]\n\nlet me just actually to get that question answered. What's\n\n[00:07:41.980]\n\ngoing to use it?\n\n[00:07:43.139]\n\nI\n\n[00:07:44.838]\n\nI'm 90% sure of what it is,\n\n[00:07:47.180]\n\nbut I I don't want to be wrong.\n\n[00:07:49.240]\n\nSo\n\n[00:07:50.139]\n\nmost of the content in this resource\n\n[00:07:52.338]\n\nis going to require you to create a user\n\n[00:07:54.659]\n\naccount. So actually, let me back\n\n[00:07:56.720]\n\nup for a second before we go look at what the\n\n[00:07:58.790]\n\njob search. I believe it's a need dot\n\n[00:08:00.810]\n\ncom. But\n\n[00:08:01.838]\n\n[00:08:03.540]\n\nto create an account, we have a new\n\n[00:08:05.550]\n\nuser sign up for first time users of\n\n[00:08:07.670]\n\nthe resource.\n\n[00:08:08.939]\n\nAnd it's very simple, We're not doing\n\n[00:08:11.120]\n\nanything with the information that we're gathering\n\n[00:08:13.389]\n\nhere. It's really just to create the account\n\n[00:08:15.519]\n\nbecause\n\n[00:08:16.540]\n\nagain if you're using test prep, you're taking\n\n[00:08:18.649]\n\nan online practice example wants you to be able to come\n\n[00:08:20.850]\n\nback, look at your work, see how you do it, retake\n\n[00:08:23.209]\n\nexams, the scholarship search\n\n[00:08:25.370]\n\ntasks for details about\n\n[00:08:27.550]\n\nyou. So things you excel, that stuff\n\n[00:08:29.649]\n\nlike that so we can match you up with\n\n[00:08:32.639]\n\nscholarships that fit. So you're\n\n[00:08:34.730]\n\nentering in some information that is going to require\n\n[00:08:36.889]\n\nwhat we call a named user account.\n\n[00:08:38.840]\n\nYour email address is not required.\n\n[00:08:41.240]\n\nAgain, we're not doing anything with the information\n\n[00:08:43.298]\n\nwe're gathering here. You're not going to start getting\n\n[00:08:45.440]\n\na bunch of emails from Gale or\n\n[00:08:47.548]\n\nPeterson.\n\n[00:08:48.740]\n\nIt is the best way though to create\n\n[00:08:50.840]\n\nyour account if you want need might need to be\n\n[00:08:52.840]\n\nable to reset your password down.\n\n[00:08:54.940]\n\nSo we are tech support can always figure something\n\n[00:08:57.240]\n\nout for you. But the folks are comfortable.\n\n[00:08:59.490]\n\nThey can share their email address that they don't have.\n\n[00:09:02.038]\n\nYou create a user name and password and then\n\n[00:09:04.090]\n\na secret word to reset\n\n[00:09:06.190]\n\nyour password if you need you and your there's\n\n[00:09:08.389]\n\nno um\n\n[00:09:10.440]\n\nsecond step where you have to go to an email\n\n[00:09:12.629]\n\nand verify or anything. You just have your\n\n[00:09:14.778]\n\naccount created. So very simple\n\n[00:09:17.240]\n\nand I'm gonna go ahead and log into my account\n\n[00:09:20.538]\n\nand we will double check. We\n\n[00:09:22.658]\n\njust feel quick\n\n[00:09:24.840]\n\nsearch here. We'll come back and look at this a little closer.\n\n[00:09:27.259]\n\nBut I do want to confirm\n\n[00:09:29.139]\n\nthe resource that we're using.\n\n[00:09:32.440]\n\nOh, it's a link up. I apologize folks. I\n\n[00:09:34.720]\n\nthat's why I shouldn't have mentioned\n\n[00:09:36.940]\n\nfor if we believe we used\n\n[00:09:38.960]\n\nto use indeed that combo with partner.\n\n[00:09:42.139]\n\nSo we go ahead and close out\n\n[00:09:44.149]\n\nof there, we will come back and look at that job searching closer.\n\n[00:09:47.940]\n\nOkay, so back to the homepage just clicking the\n\n[00:09:49.980]\n\nbanner there.\n\n[00:09:51.440]\n\nNow. One of the neat things, another neat thing\n\n[00:09:53.460]\n\nreally about having the names user account aside\n\n[00:09:55.590]\n\nfrom being able to kind of keep track of what you're doing here\n\n[00:09:58.240]\n\nis on the home page, you're able to\n\n[00:10:00.528]\n\nidentify favorites things you're kind of going\n\n[00:10:02.600]\n\nback to again and again. So if I'm\n\n[00:10:04.940]\n\ncoming in pretty regularly and working on different resumes,\n\n[00:10:07.580]\n\nI can make that one of my favorites\n\n[00:10:09.908]\n\non the homepage. If I'm walking through in this case\n\n[00:10:12.639]\n\nsome basic skills math tutorials, I can\n\n[00:10:14.668]\n\nadd them right here and I'll show you how to create\n\n[00:10:17.028]\n\nthese favorites. But it's a nice\n\n[00:10:18.840]\n\nquick way to get back to what you were doing\n\n[00:10:20.990]\n\nin this resource if you is coming back\n\n[00:10:23.250]\n\nagain and again.\n\n[00:10:25.538]\n\nSo I'm gonna start with improve\n\n[00:10:27.820]\n\nyour sports section and we'll look at a few of the items\n\n[00:10:29.918]\n\nthere, we'll walk through all these others, um\n\n[00:10:32.149]\n\nas well. But again, do feel free if there's nothing in particular\n\n[00:10:34.629]\n\nyou want to see, let me know\n\n[00:10:36.940]\n\nso improve your score again is is a\n\n[00:10:38.960]\n\nlot of um test prep.\n\n[00:10:41.009]\n\nBut also we've got a section I think\n\n[00:10:43.120]\n\nthat doesn't get talked about enough and that's\n\n[00:10:45.168]\n\nthe foundational skills tool. So\n\n[00:10:47.470]\n\nthis isn't quite, it isn't specific\n\n[00:10:49.710]\n\nto any\n\n[00:10:50.840]\n\ncertain exam, but it's to kind of\n\n[00:10:52.980]\n\nprep you for taking almost any of these\n\n[00:10:55.200]\n\nexams. So maybe a basic\n\n[00:10:57.428]\n\nskills math tutorials, I'm sure that's\n\n[00:10:59.570]\n\nsomething I could use at any point. Right?\n\n[00:11:01.620]\n\nAnd it's going to help prep me for any sort of math that\n\n[00:11:03.649]\n\nmaybe on some other certification\n\n[00:11:06.019]\n\nexam or something like that.\n\n[00:11:08.538]\n\nYou've got basic english and writing tutorials.\n\n[00:11:11.259]\n\nUh there are question banks kind of gets\n\n[00:11:13.389]\n\nyou in the habit of answering questions.\n\n[00:11:16.139]\n\nSo this is a really excellent piece of\n\n[00:11:18.200]\n\nthe resource also where you can\n\n[00:11:20.200]\n\nfind our Microsoft office tutorials.\n\n[00:11:22.440]\n\nSo something folks can do online from\n\n[00:11:24.528]\n\nhome\n\n[00:11:25.440]\n\non to learn a bit more about how to use Excel\n\n[00:11:27.690]\n\nword PowerPoint,\n\n[00:11:29.538]\n\nany of these. And you may notice\n\n[00:11:32.440]\n\nthese ones that have the little gold star that's\n\n[00:11:34.690]\n\nbecause I've added them to my favorite.\n\n[00:11:36.788]\n\nSo just\n\n[00:11:38.038]\n\nlooking that little star,\n\n[00:11:40.240]\n\nwe'll add that item to your favorites on the homepage.\n\n[00:11:42.710]\n\nSo again, if it's something you're going to come back to again\n\n[00:11:44.720]\n\nand again, the right way to find those\n\n[00:11:47.110]\n\neasily, right on the homepage when you come into\n\n[00:11:49.288]\n\nthe resource.\n\n[00:11:51.340]\n\nSo a lot of great content\n\n[00:11:53.360]\n\nhere can again help you prep for any other\n\n[00:11:55.399]\n\ntests you're going to use. But also just\n\n[00:11:57.399]\n\ngood practice you know tutorials for\n\n[00:11:59.528]\n\nfor for students for\n\n[00:12:01.808]\n\nfor adults who could maybe just use a little\n\n[00:12:03.850]\n\nhelp in those areas feel a little bit more confident.\n\n[00:12:07.840]\n\nBut we've also got of course kind of the classics\n\n[00:12:10.840]\n\nfor test prep. As I mentioned the\n\n[00:12:13.000]\n\nS. A. T. The A. C. T. And so on. We've\n\n[00:12:15.149]\n\ngot exams to prep for different high school\n\n[00:12:17.509]\n\nexams. So if you\n\n[00:12:19.570]\n\nare in a school setting maybe have\n\n[00:12:21.590]\n\na p courses. We've got a lot of\n\n[00:12:23.649]\n\ntest prep for ap\n\n[00:12:25.940]\n\nI'm the list here\n\n[00:12:27.840]\n\nand we are going to dive into some of these online tests.\n\n[00:12:29.908]\n\nI can show you what they look like and what kind of show you around\n\n[00:12:32.110]\n\na little bit here with some other high school equivalency\n\n[00:12:34.658]\n\nexams.\n\n[00:12:36.740]\n\nSo on some of these are state specific.\n\n[00:12:40.240]\n\nOkay we're gonna go into college prep here in\n\n[00:12:42.269]\n\na second. So we've also got test prep\n\n[00:12:44.308]\n\nfor grad school.\n\n[00:12:45.940]\n\nHe's looking at that passed through the various\n\n[00:12:48.028]\n\nuh the G. Net and G.\n\n[00:12:50.240]\n\nR. E. But then the elsat for\n\n[00:12:52.538]\n\nspecific\n\n[00:12:54.139]\n\ntypes of graduate degrees and\n\n[00:12:56.158]\n\nso on.\n\n[00:12:57.740]\n\nSorry folks.\n\n[00:12:59.940]\n\nAnd then our international test prop you'll find\n\n[00:13:02.408]\n\nour total and uh\n\n[00:13:04.860]\n\nwe say to each a measure exams\n\n[00:13:07.389]\n\nas well as the U. S. Citizens of exams\n\n[00:13:09.519]\n\ncan help\n\n[00:13:10.639]\n\nwhat's going to happen.\n\n[00:13:11.740]\n\nBut one of the ones I always like to highlight\n\n[00:13:13.820]\n\nbecause it is the\n\n[00:13:17.340]\n\nmost used in the resource. Our college\n\n[00:13:19.759]\n\nprep exams. So A. C.\n\n[00:13:21.899]\n\nT. S. A. T. As I mentioned. But we've also got clep\n\n[00:13:24.168]\n\nexams accuplacer DSST.\n\n[00:13:26.288]\n\nAnd so on.\n\n[00:13:28.840]\n\nAnd what's really I think\n\n[00:13:32.139]\n\nespecially nice about two of these exams\n\n[00:13:34.408]\n\nhere the A. C. T. And the S. A. T.\n\n[00:13:36.720]\n\nAlong with the online practice\n\n[00:13:39.178]\n\ntests\n\n[00:13:40.340]\n\nand the book content. These also\n\n[00:13:42.870]\n\nhave online courses to go\n\n[00:13:45.000]\n\nalong with them.\n\n[00:13:46.639]\n\nSo I remember taking one of these in high\n\n[00:13:48.759]\n\nschool I was I was lucky. It was you know an afternoon\n\n[00:13:51.298]\n\nat school it wasn't something we had to pay for but\n\n[00:13:53.379]\n\nnot everybody else is as lucky.\n\n[00:13:56.038]\n\nSo S. A. T. Prep can\n\n[00:13:58.070]\n\ncost some money. It also takes up time\n\n[00:14:00.370]\n\nright that everybody has that.\n\n[00:14:02.840]\n\nSo the S. A. T. Online course within\n\n[00:14:05.360]\n\nuh Gale presents Peterson's test and\n\n[00:14:07.548]\n\ncareer prep, that's a mouthful. Um\n\n[00:14:10.120]\n\nIs a great way for folks to do this on their\n\n[00:14:12.129]\n\nown time at no cost. So\n\n[00:14:14.308]\n\nthey come into the resource. It can work\n\n[00:14:16.370]\n\nthrough this course as needed.\n\n[00:14:18.740]\n\nAnd it provides tutorials.\n\n[00:14:21.149]\n\nYou know it's not just um\n\n[00:14:23.940]\n\nkind of content around\n\n[00:14:25.740]\n\nthe exam questions\n\n[00:14:27.750]\n\naround preparing for the exam kind of knowing\n\n[00:14:29.918]\n\nwhat's there. So you take a pre assessment, you\n\n[00:14:32.009]\n\nwork through the program let's\n\n[00:14:34.110]\n\nsee how you do at the end as well.\n\n[00:14:36.240]\n\nBut it's a great way to get comfortable taking\n\n[00:14:38.440]\n\nthe exam without kind of the pressure of\n\n[00:14:40.450]\n\nthe practice exam itself. So\n\n[00:14:42.879]\n\nagain getting more comfortable knowing what to expect\n\n[00:14:45.330]\n\nout of the exam.\n\n[00:14:48.240]\n\nBut again our most popular piece in the\n\n[00:14:50.250]\n\nresource are the online practice test themselves.\n\n[00:14:52.690]\n\nSo let's say this is something I'm gonna keep coming back\n\n[00:14:54.850]\n\nand revisiting. So I'm gonna go ahead and add it\n\n[00:14:56.940]\n\nto my favorites. But that little gold star there\n\n[00:14:59.940]\n\nand when you come into the exam, you may notice\n\n[00:15:02.070]\n\nit's opened up in a new tab or window depends\n\n[00:15:04.129]\n\non your browser's behavior. But it's\n\n[00:15:06.149]\n\nnice because you've got the database there if you need it, maybe\n\n[00:15:08.379]\n\nwe want to go back and quick check into the book or something\n\n[00:15:10.798]\n\nthat's right there for us. We've got the test\n\n[00:15:13.000]\n\nopen as well And you can see I've done some\n\n[00:15:15.139]\n\nwork before. I will caution you\n\n[00:15:17.200]\n\nthat I randomly answer questions\n\n[00:15:19.210]\n\non these exams. So I'm not doing so great\n\n[00:15:21.428]\n\nin my\n\n[00:15:22.639]\n\nmigrating of my practice\n\n[00:15:24.690]\n\nexams. But\n\n[00:15:26.340]\n\num we'll see how I want to show you how this works.\n\n[00:15:28.610]\n\nSo if you look to the left hand side\n\n[00:15:30.808]\n\nthere, basically we've got the practice practice\n\n[00:15:32.960]\n\nexams labeled as they would be\n\n[00:15:35.149]\n\nin the actual test. And generally\n\n[00:15:37.220]\n\nyou're going to have three practice tests.\n\n[00:15:39.710]\n\nUh in most cases for most\n\n[00:15:41.830]\n\nof the exams in the resource\n\n[00:15:44.399]\n\nin the handful where we only have one or two.\n\n[00:15:46.408]\n\nBut our goal is to have at least three exams\n\n[00:15:48.730]\n\nfor folks to take because it's not good to keep taking the\n\n[00:15:50.820]\n\nsame practice test over and over. That's\n\n[00:15:52.950]\n\none of the things\n\n[00:15:54.038]\n\nyou learn in the in the S. A. T.\n\n[00:15:56.139]\n\nprep eBook,\n\n[00:15:58.038]\n\nyou don't want to get in the habit, you know, start\n\n[00:16:00.168]\n\nmemorizing answers. It's, you know,\n\n[00:16:02.379]\n\nit's about learning so it is good\n\n[00:16:04.470]\n\nto take these,\n\n[00:16:06.740]\n\noh and actually it looks like for the S. A. T. We've added\n\n[00:16:08.820]\n\nsome more examples here. So that's what\n\n[00:16:10.820]\n\nI get for, not strolling down when I was prepping for\n\n[00:16:12.820]\n\nthe webinar the other day, but we've got\n\n[00:16:14.950]\n\nmore practice this year, so climbing for\n\n[00:16:17.009]\n\nthe S. A. T. Better to not take them over\n\n[00:16:19.139]\n\nand over and you will be able to keep track\n\n[00:16:21.259]\n\nof all your scores from these\n\n[00:16:23.350]\n\nsections as well.\n\n[00:16:25.139]\n\nSo let's take a look at how these work. I'll go ahead\n\n[00:16:27.190]\n\nand jump into say a math section\n\n[00:16:31.240]\n\nand you give a little introduction. You don't\n\n[00:16:33.360]\n\njust drop right into the exam, it kind\n\n[00:16:35.428]\n\nof gives you a little instruction here on how this test\n\n[00:16:37.759]\n\nis going to work. So then we can choose\n\n[00:16:40.009]\n\nto start the quiz\n\n[00:16:43.538]\n\nand\n\n[00:16:45.139]\n\nthis is going to mimic the real world\n\n[00:16:47.278]\n\ntest.\n\n[00:16:48.340]\n\nSo you're working with pages, you can\n\n[00:16:50.399]\n\nsee those in kind of the middle column on the\n\n[00:16:52.460]\n\npage here. And as you\n\n[00:16:54.519]\n\nwork through, you can see which pages you've completed.\n\n[00:16:57.200]\n\nUh you can go back and change\n\n[00:16:59.720]\n\nanswers, things like that as you're taking the exam,\n\n[00:17:02.100]\n\nit's saving your work as you go\n\n[00:17:04.190]\n\nthrough. But you can always come back\n\n[00:17:06.500]\n\nand make a change has me,\n\n[00:17:09.140]\n\nso it's going to randomly select\n\n[00:17:11.460]\n\nsome answers here.\n\n[00:17:14.140]\n\nAnd as you're working through\n\n[00:17:17.440]\n\nagain, it's going to make that real world exam.\n\n[00:17:19.880]\n\nSo we select our answer and then\n\n[00:17:21.980]\n\nmove on to the next page. Let me get a page\n\n[00:17:24.230]\n\nhere. Granted you can notice there\n\n[00:17:26.288]\n\nin that middle problem as I'm answering questions,\n\n[00:17:28.519]\n\nI get a little check mark. Right? So it's a quick\n\n[00:17:30.740]\n\nvisual way to make sure you've kind\n\n[00:17:32.940]\n\nof done your war. So you keep moving\n\n[00:17:35.078]\n\nthrough to the next page.\n\n[00:17:37.240]\n\nBut again, can always go back. Maybe, oh,\n\n[00:17:39.430]\n\nyou know what that question number five on page\n\n[00:17:41.450]\n\none, I want to go back\n\n[00:17:43.338]\n\nmake an adjustment.\n\n[00:17:45.140]\n\nYou're not committed to your answers\n\n[00:17:47.338]\n\nuntil you choose the submit\n\n[00:17:49.390]\n\nquiz yet. You just keep moving\n\n[00:17:51.650]\n\nthrough the pages\n\n[00:17:53.440]\n\nanswering questions.\n\n[00:17:55.940]\n\nAnd just in the interest of time I'm going\n\n[00:17:57.960]\n\nto go ahead and scroll down, let's say I've\n\n[00:18:00.038]\n\ngone through all these pages I've done,\n\n[00:18:02.240]\n\nI'm going to jump to the last page. Last question.\n\n[00:18:05.940]\n\nRight,\n\n[00:18:07.240]\n\njust a five, I'm\n\n[00:18:09.410]\n\nsure in close. Uh, and that is\n\n[00:18:11.578]\n\nyou submit the quiz.\n\n[00:18:15.240]\n\nIt is uh\n\n[00:18:17.338]\n\nright, that's not working. It\n\n[00:18:19.470]\n\nis going to give me a little warning. I have missed\n\n[00:18:21.470]\n\nsome questions. Right? So\n\n[00:18:23.538]\n\nI've missed several, but this is really handy\n\n[00:18:25.798]\n\nif you're just accidentally maybe skipped over\n\n[00:18:27.960]\n\none, which you know, kind of a scrolling\n\n[00:18:30.170]\n\nlist could be easy to do,\n\n[00:18:32.240]\n\nbut we're not going to go back and answer is\n\n[00:18:34.240]\n\nand we'll leave it as is So you get a little confirmation\n\n[00:18:36.730]\n\nbefore you've submitted to have the test. Great\n\n[00:18:39.940]\n\napologist,\n\n[00:18:41.038]\n\nI work for a minute and then immediately\n\n[00:18:43.380]\n\nputs you in a review so you can go back through\n\n[00:18:45.710]\n\nand see how you did.\n\n[00:18:47.338]\n\nAnd what's nice is for each question\n\n[00:18:49.338]\n\nwe can see here the question was it looks like\n\n[00:18:51.380]\n\nrandomly selecting answers is not the way to go,\n\n[00:18:53.900]\n\nbut I got mine wrong. I selected\n\n[00:18:56.078]\n\na B was the correct question.\n\n[00:18:58.088]\n\nIf you open up the feedback\n\n[00:19:00.098]\n\noption, you can see why that was the\n\n[00:19:02.118]\n\nanswer.\n\n[00:19:03.140]\n\nSo you get an explanation and you can\n\n[00:19:05.259]\n\njust keep working through\n\n[00:19:07.640]\n\nthe entire exam, seeing how you\n\n[00:19:09.640]\n\ndid it. It looks\n\n[00:19:11.818]\n\nlike these random guesses. Oh, I got lucky\n\n[00:19:13.900]\n\non questioning,\n\n[00:19:15.740]\n\nbut most cases\n\n[00:19:18.088]\n\nit was not for yeah Rachel\n\n[00:19:20.538]\n\nthat we can work through,\n\n[00:19:22.640]\n\nyou see, I'm here.\n\n[00:19:24.740]\n\nSo let me just check the chat with you and they quickly\n\n[00:19:27.028]\n\nsee if anything's come in.\n\n[00:19:30.140]\n\nOh, excellent day, I love to hear yes. The feedback\n\n[00:19:32.440]\n\nfeature is really great. That immediate\n\n[00:19:35.038]\n\nkind of learning you can do when\n\n[00:19:37.250]\n\nyou come wrong with a with a question or method\n\n[00:19:39.710]\n\nor you know, whatever it may have been the thing that's\n\n[00:19:41.900]\n\nreally handy.\n\n[00:19:44.240]\n\nNow if we jump back, I'm gonna go ahead and click\n\n[00:19:46.250]\n\nhere in the upper left hand corner, back to content\n\n[00:19:50.240]\n\nwhen you're on this page. Mostly folks\n\n[00:19:52.380]\n\nare jumping right into the practice test But I wanted\n\n[00:19:54.480]\n\nto point out when you use no little annotate tool here\n\n[00:19:58.538]\n\nthat you can work through the\n\n[00:20:00.588]\n\ndifferent kind of options with the practice.\n\n[00:20:03.078]\n\nWell, I shouldn't say option the different features\n\n[00:20:05.259]\n\nfor the practice test within\n\n[00:20:07.500]\n\nit as well. So if you want to go back and review\n\n[00:20:09.538]\n\ngrades for tests you've taken,\n\n[00:20:11.730]\n\nthere's a quizzes section for that.\n\n[00:20:13.730]\n\nYou can, of course, you know, go to the brain section.\n\n[00:20:16.380]\n\nUh There is a\n\n[00:20:18.528]\n\nclass progress which is handy\n\n[00:20:20.630]\n\nand then a system check.\n\n[00:20:22.538]\n\nThe requirements for this resource are not\n\n[00:20:24.588]\n\nare pretty basic, but just in case you can\n\n[00:20:26.848]\n\nalways take advantage of that. So this\n\n[00:20:28.920]\n\nwill let you explore uh the\n\n[00:20:31.068]\n\nfeatures of the exam as well. So I'd like to point\n\n[00:20:33.180]\n\nout that banner because really the focus is,\n\n[00:20:35.640]\n\nyou know, on the practice test and that's where most folks\n\n[00:20:37.778]\n\ngo. But if they want to kind of look at past history\n\n[00:20:39.980]\n\nof the exam,\n\n[00:20:41.240]\n\nyou've got those sections up here to work with.\n\n[00:20:44.240]\n\nWe gotta be clear these out.\n\n[00:20:47.740]\n\nNow. A question we get for the exams\n\n[00:20:50.108]\n\nin some cases is\n\n[00:20:52.230]\n\num if you're working in a school setting\n\n[00:20:54.440]\n\nor really just stay, a student wants\n\n[00:20:56.509]\n\nto check their work with their teacher, I have a question,\n\n[00:20:58.700]\n\nyou can print from the exam results,\n\n[00:21:01.000]\n\nbut sometimes um if maybe\n\n[00:21:03.078]\n\nit's been given as assignment to take,\n\n[00:21:05.200]\n\nyou know what uh Yeah practice\n\n[00:21:07.420]\n\ntest or something like that and you want\n\n[00:21:09.740]\n\nto uh\n\n[00:21:12.038]\n\nshare what you've done so far if we go into\n\n[00:21:14.130]\n\nclass progress and click\n\n[00:21:16.140]\n\non quizzes, you can see all of your attempts\n\n[00:21:18.618]\n\nat the various exams\n\n[00:21:20.440]\n\nand how well you've done. So this is something\n\n[00:21:22.868]\n\nthat a student can print out and share with the future.\n\n[00:21:25.328]\n\nThere isn't really a future for someone else\n\n[00:21:27.430]\n\nto come in and look at anyone else's account.\n\n[00:21:30.220]\n\nBut this finding the content\n\n[00:21:32.519]\n\njust food. Got a nice print option here\n\n[00:21:34.730]\n\nat the top of the page for an ice cream print.\n\n[00:21:36.759]\n\nBut you can share results that way with others.\n\n[00:21:39.318]\n\nUh If you like.\n\n[00:21:43.240]\n\nSo lots of good stuff there and really all\n\n[00:21:45.368]\n\nthe tests are gonna mimic that same experience.\n\n[00:21:47.960]\n\nSo if we go ahead I do want out we're going to kind of\n\n[00:21:49.980]\n\njump over the uh find a school and\n\n[00:21:52.068]\n\nexplore careers for a minute and go right\n\n[00:21:54.118]\n\nto the vocational test prep.\n\n[00:21:56.140]\n\nThis is going to give us really\n\n[00:21:58.269]\n\nthe same format of exams but each\n\n[00:22:00.460]\n\nof them are going to have their own kind of tools.\n\n[00:22:02.630]\n\nSo kind of scroll of it here. You\n\n[00:22:04.769]\n\ncan see there's a broken down by category.\n\n[00:22:06.890]\n\nSo if I jump to say military, we\n\n[00:22:09.230]\n\ndo have the asvab but then we've added some\n\n[00:22:11.230]\n\nrecent ones over the years or in some cases e\n\n[00:22:13.338]\n\nbooks to support for example the military\n\n[00:22:15.358]\n\nflight aptitude\n\n[00:22:16.640]\n\ntest. E book. When you select\n\n[00:22:18.970]\n\nan e book it immediately prompts\n\n[00:22:21.130]\n\nyou to download a pdf\n\n[00:22:23.940]\n\nand then you can I apologize. What's up publishing\n\n[00:22:26.088]\n\non this already open but don't look up pretty quick.\n\n[00:22:28.838]\n\nYou've got that pdf to work with\n\n[00:22:32.338]\n\nand that's yours. It's there's no real check\n\n[00:22:34.490]\n\nin or check out. It's it's not like it's going to disappear\n\n[00:22:37.019]\n\noff you say if you put this on your own device\n\n[00:22:39.298]\n\num you know if you downloaded it for offline\n\n[00:22:41.670]\n\nuse you're going to go any time. It\n\n[00:22:43.730]\n\ndoesn't disappear from your device after a couple\n\n[00:22:45.930]\n\nof weeks. It's not like an an overdrive e book\n\n[00:22:48.150]\n\nor anything like that. This is really just yours to then\n\n[00:22:50.259]\n\nuse however you see fit and\n\n[00:22:52.269]\n\nwhat's nice about the books is again\n\n[00:22:55.038]\n\nyou've got the practice test that always appear\n\n[00:22:57.140]\n\nat the back of the book and you know you would have\n\n[00:22:59.160]\n\nto do the grading yourself. It's not like the online\n\n[00:23:01.509]\n\npractice test but you also get all of\n\n[00:23:03.608]\n\nthe content that perhaps you for the\n\n[00:23:05.640]\n\nexam.\n\n[00:23:06.640]\n\nSo you can study with it. You learn more\n\n[00:23:08.720]\n\nabout how the test is administered. All\n\n[00:23:10.759]\n\nof that information\n\n[00:23:12.838]\n\nthat you folks are really great.\n\n[00:23:15.140]\n\nBut if I go ahead and say jump into master the\n\n[00:23:17.180]\n\nasvab\n\n[00:23:18.338]\n\nit's going to give me the option to\n\n[00:23:20.480]\n\nagain download that book and take advantage.\n\n[00:23:22.740]\n\nYou can have unlimited downloads with this content\n\n[00:23:25.940]\n\nwhich fall down a bit.\n\n[00:23:27.640]\n\nWe've got an as we have prep course\n\n[00:23:30.538]\n\njump into that and you'll see it mimics the\n\n[00:23:32.558]\n\n[00:23:35.940]\n\noh we have a bad one there.\n\n[00:23:37.980]\n\nI'm gonna have to investigate that. This is what I get for randomly\n\n[00:23:40.230]\n\nselecting instead of going with Maya.\n\n[00:23:42.940]\n\nof course. Let's see if this one\n\n[00:23:48.538]\n\nlarry, that's what I was looking for. So mimics what\n\n[00:23:50.558]\n\nwe saw would be S. A. T. Prep course as\n\n[00:23:52.598]\n\nwell. Nice\n\n[00:23:54.980]\n\nfamiliar tools as you move between them.\n\n[00:23:57.640]\n\nBut you can again just kind of take a look\n\n[00:24:00.000]\n\nagain, it's about to get comfortable relax\n\n[00:24:02.068]\n\nhere. So we've got different military exams, firefighter,\n\n[00:24:04.568]\n\nlaw enforcement,\n\n[00:24:06.038]\n\num postal exams, real estate\n\n[00:24:09.240]\n\ngot a lot of options here and\n\n[00:24:12.640]\n\nagain, unlimited use here. So folks can come\n\n[00:24:14.808]\n\nin and take advantage of\n\n[00:24:16.838]\n\nuh and all the e book content, the prep\n\n[00:24:19.028]\n\ncourse to practice us and so on.\n\n[00:24:21.338]\n\nAnd they're all going to follow that same format\n\n[00:24:26.240]\n\nalready. So let's take a look now.\n\n[00:24:28.318]\n\nWe're going to jump back to find a school\n\n[00:24:30.328]\n\nand the finest school tool again, as I mentioned\n\n[00:24:32.680]\n\nis going to give different options. It's not just\n\n[00:24:34.940]\n\nabout finding a school.\n\n[00:24:37.338]\n\nWhat does I'm clicking on things in it.\n\n[00:24:39.338]\n\nThere we go. Um The college\n\n[00:24:41.608]\n\nand scholarship search pages going to offer\n\n[00:24:43.940]\n\nus of course college searches but\n\n[00:24:46.240]\n\nalso the the uh scholarship\n\n[00:24:48.509]\n\nsearch which is a great way\n\n[00:24:51.440]\n\nto find what's out there, right? It can be overwhelming\n\n[00:24:54.200]\n\nto go online and look for scholarships\n\n[00:24:56.430]\n\nsearch. So what's nice about this is\n\n[00:24:58.578]\n\nthe scholarship searches searches\n\n[00:25:00.588]\n\nhave been indexed by different\n\n[00:25:03.380]\n\nuh filters. So if you look over\n\n[00:25:05.400]\n\non the left hand side, you can look\n\n[00:25:07.720]\n\nfor awards based on school type,\n\n[00:25:09.990]\n\nethnicity, gender.\n\n[00:25:13.338]\n\nRight? So again, this is where we need that, why\n\n[00:25:15.430]\n\nyou're creating a user account, You're answering\n\n[00:25:17.588]\n\nsome questions about yourself. In\n\n[00:25:19.720]\n\nthis case, you've also got\n\n[00:25:21.858]\n\nthe ability to um narrow\n\n[00:25:24.028]\n\nby a few more items to your area\n\n[00:25:26.430]\n\nof study is always a good one. So I\n\n[00:25:28.470]\n\nwas interested in a particular program and\n\n[00:25:30.818]\n\nas you select over on the left was\n\n[00:25:32.900]\n\nquite, and perhaps the earth science,\n\n[00:25:34.740]\n\nit filters to scholarships on the right\n\n[00:25:37.240]\n\nand then we can jump in,\n\n[00:25:39.940]\n\nread a bit more about this labyrinth stem\n\n[00:25:42.019]\n\nscholarship,\n\n[00:25:44.140]\n\nget some backgrounds, find out how\n\n[00:25:46.150]\n\nto apply\n\n[00:25:47.740]\n\nhow much money they're giving out.\n\n[00:25:50.640]\n\nMore companies,\n\n[00:25:53.838]\n\nfind a school will do the same thing\n\n[00:25:55.900]\n\nfor the different college searches. So if I jump\n\n[00:25:58.220]\n\ninto say the undergraduate school search,\n\n[00:26:01.538]\n\nit's going to again offer filters\n\n[00:26:03.568]\n\nover on the left. We can break down by location.\n\n[00:26:06.278]\n\nSo for example, I live in new york state. So\n\n[00:26:09.640]\n\nin state tuition is always nice\n\n[00:26:11.858]\n\nto go ahead and grab the new york\n\n[00:26:14.038]\n\nand you can choose multiple. So this as\n\n[00:26:16.038]\n\nwell. So it's going maybe I'm also interested\n\n[00:26:18.390]\n\nin massachusetts\n\n[00:26:21.440]\n\ngo ahead and select and over\n\n[00:26:23.618]\n\non the right. It just keeps filtering and working\n\n[00:26:25.778]\n\nwith the choices that you've made\n\n[00:26:27.950]\n\nover on the left, the area of study.\n\n[00:26:30.440]\n\nAnd what I like about these is you\n\n[00:26:32.578]\n\ncan certainly scroll these lists.\n\n[00:26:34.598]\n\nBut as you start to type,\n\n[00:26:37.240]\n\nit will match you up so you don't have to scroll\n\n[00:26:39.640]\n\nthese entire lists. So\n\n[00:26:41.910]\n\nif I'm looking to say a few different biology careers,\n\n[00:26:45.140]\n\ngo ahead and select\n\n[00:26:47.440]\n\nand again, don't have to ah\n\n[00:26:51.440]\n\nuse the uh\n\n[00:26:53.640]\n\nuh just a pick list\n\n[00:26:56.338]\n\nand you can work on things,\n\n[00:26:58.410]\n\nyou know, area of study location of the\n\n[00:27:00.509]\n\ncorporate standards. But I like some of these other\n\n[00:27:02.680]\n\nchoices as well, something like setting,\n\n[00:27:05.140]\n\nyou know, um If I, which I did\n\n[00:27:07.390]\n\ngrow up in a small town, maybe I want to\n\n[00:27:09.588]\n\nmimic that experience or\n\n[00:27:11.778]\n\nmaybe I'm looking to really\n\n[00:27:13.900]\n\nkind of jump up and and\n\n[00:27:16.019]\n\nchange my, my setting\n\n[00:27:18.019]\n\nquite a bit. I could maybe add in urban and\n\n[00:27:20.328]\n\nagain as I'm making this election just over\n\n[00:27:22.420]\n\non the right. It's narrowing gun showing me\n\n[00:27:25.338]\n\nvarious schools\n\n[00:27:27.240]\n\nand if you jump in,\n\n[00:27:29.940]\n\nif anybody used remembers using\n\n[00:27:32.009]\n\nor have them on the shelf in your library.\n\n[00:27:34.150]\n\nThose, you know, big thick Peterson's\n\n[00:27:36.348]\n\ncollege books.\n\n[00:27:37.838]\n\nThat's what you're getting here. You're finding\n\n[00:27:40.098]\n\nall of the details. If you look over on the left,\n\n[00:27:42.250]\n\nyou've got kind of a table of contents to work through.\n\n[00:27:44.470]\n\nSo jump into state tuitions and\n\n[00:27:46.470]\n\nfees, find out about their financial\n\n[00:27:48.838]\n\naid situation.\n\n[00:27:51.038]\n\nWe got there interesting statistics here.\n\n[00:27:53.210]\n\nI don't remember these in the books back when I\n\n[00:27:55.358]\n\nwas using them, but I love to see this\n\n[00:27:57.420]\n\ndata. So average percentage of financial\n\n[00:27:59.519]\n\nneed met. Um you know,\n\n[00:28:01.568]\n\nI think it's important that financial\n\n[00:28:03.990]\n\naid piece is so important nowadays. You\n\n[00:28:06.400]\n\nget all your details around campus sleight\n\n[00:28:08.509]\n\nof athletic programs, faculty and,\n\n[00:28:10.880]\n\nand so on.\n\n[00:28:12.038]\n\nSo lots of good data. And if you haven't\n\n[00:28:14.250]\n\nbeen in this resource in a while and\n\n[00:28:16.630]\n\nyou're using this session is a little kind of refresher.\n\n[00:28:19.740]\n\nUh again, I encourage you to kind of come\n\n[00:28:21.769]\n\nin here and look around. There's a lot more\n\n[00:28:23.930]\n\num, things a lot more visually appealing\n\n[00:28:26.160]\n\nthan it used to be and it's more modern.\n\n[00:28:28.509]\n\nWe're linking out to their facebook page, pulling\n\n[00:28:31.019]\n\nin tweets, um, for some schools.\n\n[00:28:33.130]\n\nSo really kind of engaging way\n\n[00:28:35.278]\n\nto look for school and you're not getting bombarded\n\n[00:28:37.640]\n\nwith ads. Right? So a nice\n\n[00:28:40.140]\n\nfeature and working through library\n\n[00:28:42.440]\n\nresources is no ads.\n\n[00:28:44.568]\n\nSo lots of good stuff.\n\n[00:28:47.440]\n\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at a few more of these\n\n[00:28:49.490]\n\ncollege search options.\n\n[00:28:51.838]\n\nSo again, we have for graduate programs,\n\n[00:28:54.240]\n\nbut also specific types of schools. So\n\n[00:28:56.240]\n\ngraduates, uh, distance learning\n\n[00:28:58.500]\n\nsearch, you're looking to go to school online.\n\n[00:29:01.240]\n\nAnd again, these are all gonna mimic and work the same\n\n[00:29:03.240]\n\nway just over on the left. You take advantage of the filters\n\n[00:29:05.730]\n\nthat will match you up with schools on the right\n\n[00:29:09.538]\n\nOh pretty.\n\n[00:29:12.338]\n\nAnd one piece I would like to show off\n\n[00:29:14.568]\n\nhere is the college framing center also\n\n[00:29:16.930]\n\nunderlined the school. What it does is\n\n[00:29:19.048]\n\nkind of gather together\n\n[00:29:21.338]\n\nall of the different tools and the resources,\n\n[00:29:23.818]\n\nbut all of the different sources to help\n\n[00:29:26.028]\n\nplan for college. And really\n\n[00:29:28.298]\n\nit pulls in a lot of the career stuff\n\n[00:29:30.460]\n\ntoo. So it's all\n\n[00:29:32.848]\n\none nice place. This is something again,\n\n[00:29:34.980]\n\nif you're in a school setting, show\n\n[00:29:37.068]\n\nthis off during parent open houses,\n\n[00:29:39.180]\n\nthis is really great content certainly\n\n[00:29:41.519]\n\ncould be put to great use in the guidance\n\n[00:29:43.618]\n\noffice as well.\n\n[00:29:45.440]\n\nBut you've got all of the kind of help\n\n[00:29:47.528]\n\nand advice articles that come along with\n\n[00:29:49.618]\n\nchoosing a career and and finding\n\n[00:29:52.048]\n\nthe right college. They've even created these checklists\n\n[00:29:54.670]\n\nfor both parents and students.\n\n[00:29:56.838]\n\nSo what should I be doing as a parent of a\n\n[00:29:58.880]\n\nkid who was in 11th grade.\n\n[00:30:01.240]\n\nAnd what I like about the advice content\n\n[00:30:03.318]\n\nis it's kind of these quick\n\n[00:30:05.240]\n\num articles. They're not, you know, lengthy,\n\n[00:30:07.630]\n\nlengthy, lengthy tones. It's just good\n\n[00:30:09.769]\n\nstuff to know, kind of breaking it down to the most\n\n[00:30:11.828]\n\nsalient point.\n\n[00:30:13.440]\n\nSo the college planning center I think is a really\n\n[00:30:16.150]\n\nuseful piece in the resource. It links\n\n[00:30:18.210]\n\nout to test, you might need to take it offers.\n\n[00:30:20.608]\n\nAgain, a lot of advice links out to various\n\n[00:30:22.970]\n\nsearches. It just kind of pulls all\n\n[00:30:25.078]\n\nthat content to one place. So excellent\n\n[00:30:27.640]\n\nresource to point both students\n\n[00:30:29.930]\n\nand parents to the college planning\n\n[00:30:32.108]\n\ncenter again, found it or find a school.\n\n[00:30:35.940]\n\nAll right. So the last section we're going to take a look\n\n[00:30:38.190]\n\nat and spend our time in is explore\n\n[00:30:40.190]\n\ncareers because it kind of the second most\n\n[00:30:42.269]\n\nused piece of this resource\n\n[00:30:44.140]\n\nis these career tools,\n\n[00:30:46.200]\n\nmost specifically the resume builder.\n\n[00:30:49.140]\n\nI want to jump into the career tools\n\n[00:30:51.740]\n\nand the first thing that's gonna want you to do.\n\n[00:30:54.058]\n\nSorry folks, I seem to have to keep clicking my mouse\n\n[00:30:56.450]\n\ntwice.\n\n[00:30:57.640]\n\nUm when you're working with this section\n\n[00:30:59.680]\n\nhere\n\n[00:31:01.038]\n\nto find a career\n\n[00:31:02.690]\n\nthat I had to use that. This is where you're\n\n[00:31:04.740]\n\ngoing to find those career assessments. So\n\n[00:31:06.778]\n\nto help you find\n\n[00:31:08.940]\n\nthe industry, the job that might suit you\n\n[00:31:11.019]\n\nbest. You are going to have to participate\n\n[00:31:13.170]\n\nin the first two assessments,\n\n[00:31:15.720]\n\nthe ones related to interests and values.\n\n[00:31:18.009]\n\nSo I've gone ahead and done that ahead of time\n\n[00:31:20.450]\n\nso we can kind of take a look at what happens\n\n[00:31:22.660]\n\nafter. But I do want to show you how these\n\n[00:31:24.818]\n\nassessment work because there are\n\n[00:31:26.950]\n\nfour of them\n\n[00:31:28.338]\n\nand a lot of career assessments just kind\n\n[00:31:30.509]\n\nof asked you know, would you like to do this job?\n\n[00:31:32.769]\n\nWould you like to do that job? And you know that make\n\n[00:31:35.240]\n\nyou know the judgements based on what you said yes\n\n[00:31:37.269]\n\nto, you know, that's one\n\n[00:31:39.269]\n\nway to do it. What I like about these assessments\n\n[00:31:41.828]\n\nis it kind of comes at it from different\n\n[00:31:44.700]\n\npath,\n\n[00:31:46.140]\n\ncertainly wants to know your interest. But then it also\n\n[00:31:48.190]\n\nwants to know more about your values, your personality\n\n[00:31:50.750]\n\nand your workplace preferences because these\n\n[00:31:52.880]\n\nare going to impact the type of career you might fit\n\n[00:31:54.910]\n\nbest in as well.\n\n[00:31:56.538]\n\nAnd what I also like about these is they're really engaging,\n\n[00:31:59.098]\n\nIt's not just a bunch of multiple choice\n\n[00:32:01.308]\n\nquestions, so I\n\n[00:32:03.358]\n\nthink there is one that is multi,\n\n[00:32:05.038]\n\nbut I think maybe the interest, but if\n\n[00:32:07.058]\n\nwe're going to see a workplace preferences\n\n[00:32:10.538]\n\nuse your little, you know, instruction on how this\n\n[00:32:12.608]\n\nis gonna work, but and jump in.\n\n[00:32:15.538]\n\nIt's asking questions and\n\n[00:32:17.598]\n\nthen it's a little more interactive than just\n\n[00:32:19.618]\n\nlike selecting answers. So in this case,\n\n[00:32:22.338]\n\nuh which of these statements are\n\n[00:32:24.420]\n\nthe four least important for you to\n\n[00:32:26.460]\n\nhave in your ideal organization. So\n\n[00:32:28.558]\n\nthinking about the place you're going to work, what is\n\n[00:32:30.630]\n\nnot that important to you\n\n[00:32:32.740]\n\nand then you go through and just grab each\n\n[00:32:34.828]\n\nof these, you move on to the next page and it will,\n\n[00:32:37.038]\n\nit goes through what would be most important\n\n[00:32:39.480]\n\nand you're kind of ranking them in order,\n\n[00:32:41.640]\n\nSo it's engaging. But it also kind of really\n\n[00:32:43.818]\n\nmakes people think critically about\n\n[00:32:46.308]\n\ntheir their needs and their wants\n\n[00:32:48.808]\n\nin this case, in the workplace or again\n\n[00:32:50.980]\n\naround values and the like, so we\n\n[00:32:53.288]\n\ndo encourage folks to answer\n\n[00:32:55.598]\n\nall four\n\n[00:32:57.440]\n\nassessment sections, but again,\n\n[00:32:59.759]\n\nyou really just have to take the first\n\n[00:33:02.038]\n\ntwo, so assessment interests and assessment\n\n[00:33:04.440]\n\nvalues, you're going to have to work through\n\n[00:33:06.838]\n\nand\n\n[00:33:08.140]\n\nthen what you're gonna get is\n\n[00:33:10.538]\n\nI just pointed out here\n\n[00:33:12.640]\n\nis the option to explore your career matches.\n\n[00:33:15.098]\n\nSo by answering those questions,\n\n[00:33:17.098]\n\nwhat does it think I'm well suited for?\n\n[00:33:19.538]\n\nAnd if we jump in,\n\n[00:33:22.640]\n\nI ranked highest in science\n\n[00:33:25.118]\n\nEngineering and Mathematics, which surprised me\n\n[00:33:27.400]\n\neducation, which did not\n\n[00:33:29.630]\n\nhealth science and so on. Going\n\n[00:33:31.940]\n\nthrough here\n\n[00:33:32.940]\n\nand we're just seeing where you kind of landed\n\n[00:33:35.160]\n\nwith these broad categories. So these by these\n\n[00:33:37.230]\n\nsubject areas, we can always get to everything.\n\n[00:33:39.440]\n\nView all careers,\n\n[00:33:41.140]\n\nexplore things that maybe didn't come up\n\n[00:33:44.240]\n\nAll right, you know what you say, it's fast. So\n\n[00:33:46.358]\n\nif you all careers allows you to get to everything,\n\n[00:33:48.940]\n\nbut if we go ahead and choose, I'm gonna grab, say, new\n\n[00:33:51.220]\n\ncareers in education,\n\n[00:33:53.038]\n\nit matches you up with the career overviews\n\n[00:33:55.490]\n\nthat fall into that subject area and\n\n[00:33:57.558]\n\nover on the left again, we've got filtered.\n\n[00:34:00.140]\n\nAnd what I like about this is\n\n[00:34:02.180]\n\nyou can filter too,\n\n[00:34:04.440]\n\nyour education experience experience\n\n[00:34:06.630]\n\nlevel. So if if my ultimate\n\n[00:34:09.070]\n\ngoal is to go into education and maybe\n\n[00:34:11.150]\n\nthat's going to require a Master's program,\n\n[00:34:13.190]\n\nwhat could I do right now with a bachelor's\n\n[00:34:15.590]\n\ndegree, what could I do right now with\n\n[00:34:17.610]\n\njust, you know, maybe a g E D. Or something\n\n[00:34:19.880]\n\nlike that, you get almost this kind\n\n[00:34:21.940]\n\nof career ladder. So maybe while I'm\n\n[00:34:24.039]\n\ngoing to school for my masters,\n\n[00:34:26.539]\n\nI could be doing some of these other tasks, the\n\n[00:34:28.550]\n\nkind of things I might be well suited for and qualified\n\n[00:34:31.039]\n\nfor right now,\n\n[00:34:32.440]\n\nwhile I'm working towards that ultimate goal\n\n[00:34:34.940]\n\nthat elementary\n\n[00:34:36.440]\n\nand you can see you can add favorites here. So something\n\n[00:34:38.840]\n\nlooks good. You think, you know, that's something you want\n\n[00:34:40.840]\n\nto explore. You can add it to your favorites.\n\n[00:34:43.840]\n\nRight? Roll through here as well.\n\n[00:34:47.940]\n\nYou can look at these\n\n[00:34:49.139]\n\nand each of them are going to and go and\n\n[00:34:51.289]\n\njump into one.\n\n[00:34:53.739]\n\nThese will be, you know, kind of familiar breaks down\n\n[00:34:55.768]\n\nwith the job description is programs you may\n\n[00:34:57.849]\n\nneed to be in uh degrees, you\n\n[00:34:59.929]\n\nmay need to have what skills you'll,\n\n[00:35:02.050]\n\nyou'll uh using the job\n\n[00:35:04.610]\n\nyou look over to the right there. Often\n\n[00:35:06.800]\n\ncareer videos you can link into and learn\n\n[00:35:08.889]\n\nmore average salary\n\n[00:35:10.940]\n\nabout look which is interesting search\n\n[00:35:13.429]\n\nfor available jobs and that's going to go ahead\n\n[00:35:15.599]\n\nand launch that\n\n[00:35:17.340]\n\njob search that we got a quick peek at earlier\n\n[00:35:19.940]\n\nso we can put in,\n\n[00:35:25.739]\n\noh I probably should have included\n\n[00:35:28.190]\n\na location as well. There we go.\n\n[00:35:30.329]\n\nAnd now once you've taken the assessments,\n\n[00:35:32.820]\n\nit matches up with\n\n[00:35:35.170]\n\nyour uh\n\n[00:35:37.440]\n\nuh huh\n\n[00:35:38.840]\n\nmatches pardon me\n\n[00:35:40.440]\n\nuh that you got from the assessment so\n\n[00:35:42.579]\n\nyou can see where you might.\n\n[00:35:44.940]\n\nWhy not? Well,\n\n[00:35:46.639]\n\nso you get those kind of and oh and I apologize\n\n[00:35:49.050]\n\nthis okay. This I apologize folks, this is my confusion\n\n[00:35:51.469]\n\nbefore the job search that you get\n\n[00:35:53.739]\n\nwithout using the assessments\n\n[00:35:55.820]\n\ndoes come from a different parameter but here is\n\n[00:35:57.829]\n\nwhere we're using Indeed dot com\n\n[00:36:00.530]\n\nand I apologize because I keep thinking\n\n[00:36:02.860]\n\nthe one replaced the other but it didn't be so honorable.\n\n[00:36:05.929]\n\nSo with indeed dot com. What I\n\n[00:36:07.989]\n\nlove about their site there, another great partner.\n\n[00:36:10.610]\n\nUm I think\n\n[00:36:12.630]\n\nuh really a top of the line tool\n\n[00:36:14.739]\n\nout there on the web because they crawl\n\n[00:36:16.869]\n\nother search boards. So they're looking\n\n[00:36:19.050]\n\nnot just at, you know, openings\n\n[00:36:21.440]\n\nthat come from other uh, kind\n\n[00:36:23.518]\n\nof career tools, but also they're crawling\n\n[00:36:25.889]\n\ncompany websites. They're crawling,\n\n[00:36:28.829]\n\nyou know, different government sites that pose to\n\n[00:36:30.880]\n\nopen positions and bring them back\n\n[00:36:33.050]\n\ninto one place. So indeed Dot\n\n[00:36:35.099]\n\ncom is a really great\n\n[00:36:37.150]\n\nresource. Your your\n\n[00:36:38.730]\n\nso I mean casting out a wide nap when you're looking\n\n[00:36:40.820]\n\nfor open positions when you're using this tool. So\n\n[00:36:43.469]\n\nprobably I spoke to my confusion on those. I don't\n\n[00:36:45.530]\n\nknow why I can't keep that straight\n\n[00:36:47.429]\n\nSo there we go.\n\n[00:36:50.929]\n\nSo there are other help. There's other help here too.\n\n[00:36:53.130]\n\nWe want to show you the resume tool,\n\n[00:36:55.230]\n\nbut before we wrap up and let you go on with\n\n[00:36:57.309]\n\nthe rest of your day. But if we just\n\n[00:36:59.320]\n\npoint them out quickly, we take a look at the tools.\n\n[00:37:01.690]\n\nThis is where you can get a lot of that advice\n\n[00:37:04.199]\n\ncontent. So advice for writing\n\n[00:37:06.239]\n\nyour resume, your cover letters interviews,\n\n[00:37:09.230]\n\nThere's some worksheets that can maybe help you walk\n\n[00:37:11.539]\n\nthrough learning um you know\n\n[00:37:13.539]\n\nwhat you might like as a career. So\n\n[00:37:15.860]\n\nlots of good stuff in this section of the resource.\n\n[00:37:20.130]\n\nUm Ellen, can you please show that again?\n\n[00:37:22.139]\n\nSo I'm not sure which\n\n[00:37:24.159]\n\nthing you'd like me to show again. Gonna be happy to\n\n[00:37:26.210]\n\nus if you want to elaborate there in the chat, I will.\n\n[00:37:29.329]\n\nWe'll definitely show again.\n\n[00:37:31.429]\n\nSo all of this content I got\n\n[00:37:33.719]\n\nto through going close some\n\n[00:37:35.719]\n\nof these camps here\n\n[00:37:37.329]\n\nis through the career tools under\n\n[00:37:39.420]\n\nfind a career.\n\n[00:37:41.030]\n\nSo all of that content opens up\n\n[00:37:43.230]\n\nthis halfway use section, our\n\n[00:37:45.268]\n\nproject. Let's do that time out. There we go.\n\n[00:37:47.730]\n\nSo it brings back all of that content\n\n[00:37:50.730]\n\narcher\n\n[00:37:52.030]\n\nhow to get to Indeed, versus the other job\n\n[00:37:54.030]\n\nlistings that he showed. Absolutely.\n\n[00:37:55.929]\n\nSo this comes from and actually\n\n[00:37:58.079]\n\nlet me back up.\n\n[00:37:59.929]\n\nSo you go to the Explorer career\n\n[00:38:01.989]\n\nsection and go into the find\n\n[00:38:04.329]\n\na career. And once that opens\n\n[00:38:06.659]\n\nup there,\n\n[00:38:09.719]\n\nlet me point it out here in the toolbar. So up\n\n[00:38:11.889]\n\ntop we have this this banner that\n\n[00:38:13.980]\n\nfollows us through our time in this section\n\n[00:38:16.719]\n\nand what we want\n\n[00:38:19.018]\n\nis that jobs button there\n\n[00:38:22.219]\n\naround my drawings here is like\n\n[00:38:25.320]\n\nand we keep you in our\n\n[00:38:27.389]\n\ninterface here while you put in the job\n\n[00:38:29.590]\n\nyou're interested end,\n\n[00:38:35.518]\n\nwow\n\n[00:38:41.518]\n\nand show you our matches\n\n[00:38:44.018]\n\nand then once you click on one of the matches,\n\n[00:38:47.820]\n\nNot cool anymore. But yeah, you end up\n\n[00:38:49.940]\n\nat indeed dot com\n\n[00:38:52.420]\n\nand then from there they actually link\n\n[00:38:54.530]\n\nout by the original posting and\n\n[00:38:56.809]\n\nthey've got a lot of great tools here too.\n\n[00:38:59.518]\n\nSo what you want to come in to find the indeed\n\n[00:39:01.610]\n\ndot com matchups\n\n[00:39:03.518]\n\ncome to the job section of\n\n[00:39:05.809]\n\nthe career tools here. Under find\n\n[00:39:08.030]\n\na career. You're\n\n[00:39:10.940]\n\nwelcome. No problem.\n\n[00:39:13.518]\n\nAlrighty so lots of good content.\n\n[00:39:15.559]\n\nAnd the career advice tool is well\n\n[00:39:17.650]\n\nI'll open this up. This is almost more like tutorials\n\n[00:39:20.400]\n\nthat you work through here\n\n[00:39:22.518]\n\nso it will mimic coming the\n\n[00:39:24.619]\n\ncourses that we've seen before. But you\n\n[00:39:26.619]\n\njust kind of pick the things that you're most interested.\n\n[00:39:28.789]\n\nYou don't have to work through the many certain order.\n\n[00:39:30.989]\n\nThe transitioning out of the military\n\n[00:39:33.159]\n\nis a really popular section\n\n[00:39:35.170]\n\non data for our folks who are\n\n[00:39:37.619]\n\num leaving the military coming\n\n[00:39:39.739]\n\nout into into civilian life.\n\n[00:39:43.420]\n\nThe last thing I'll show you here though is\n\n[00:39:45.599]\n\ncreate a resume and this is\n\n[00:39:47.599]\n\na really excellent tool. Again another partner\n\n[00:39:49.980]\n\nwe're working the visual C. V. Here\n\n[00:39:52.050]\n\nwhich has\n\n[00:39:54.320]\n\nreally excellent\n\n[00:39:56.119]\n\num\n\n[00:39:57.920]\n\nbuilding a resume tool. I mean it's just\n\n[00:40:00.018]\n\nI love what it does here. I think it's\n\n[00:40:02.079]\n\ngood for beginners but also folks who are more experienced\n\n[00:40:04.480]\n\nin their career are looking to give their\n\n[00:40:06.539]\n\nresume or refresh.\n\n[00:40:08.829]\n\nIt's really I think for everybody when\n\n[00:40:11.360]\n\nyou come into the resource you get a little tutorial\n\n[00:40:13.550]\n\nabout how it works which is nice but of course that's\n\n[00:40:15.599]\n\nwhat I'm here for. So let me show you\n\n[00:40:18.309]\n\num one of the great things about this collection\n\n[00:40:20.340]\n\nis that lets you build multiple resumes.\n\n[00:40:22.909]\n\nSo if I'm applying for different types of jobs.\n\n[00:40:25.260]\n\nI maybe I'm using different resumes for each\n\n[00:40:27.349]\n\none. I can keep track of all of them here on\n\n[00:40:29.409]\n\nthe home page,\n\n[00:40:30.610]\n\nyou can see I've got a couple going already.\n\n[00:40:33.110]\n\nIt actually allows you to create a website\n\n[00:40:35.480]\n\nand this is something folks are being asked for\n\n[00:40:37.590]\n\nmore and more to kind of share a portfolio\n\n[00:40:39.860]\n\nof work you've done. So it will\n\n[00:40:41.929]\n\nwalk you through creating website to post your content\n\n[00:40:44.400]\n\nto to post your resume to.\n\n[00:40:46.409]\n\nThere's also which I love.\n\n[00:40:48.579]\n\nThis new career journal tool which\n\n[00:40:51.190]\n\nhelps you track your career accomplishments\n\n[00:40:53.570]\n\nover time. And this is new to the resource\n\n[00:40:55.900]\n\nreally. I think this this week\n\n[00:40:58.010]\n\num\n\n[00:40:59.409]\n\nor so and it kind\n\n[00:41:01.530]\n\nof a tool to remind you of the things\n\n[00:41:03.690]\n\nyou've done right. It's hard to write a resume. What\n\n[00:41:05.880]\n\ndo I do my job every day? I don't know why\n\n[00:41:07.909]\n\nit for me it feels hard to write down,\n\n[00:41:10.110]\n\nbut this also has you\n\n[00:41:12.199]\n\nkeep track of what your achievements are. So things\n\n[00:41:14.489]\n\nyou've done big projects you've taken on and\n\n[00:41:16.619]\n\nthen it's ready for you.\n\n[00:41:18.309]\n\nUh two and include and again\n\n[00:41:20.500]\n\ncan category on your website.\n\n[00:41:23.710]\n\nYeah,\n\n[00:41:25.210]\n\njump back to the resume section so\n\n[00:41:27.820]\n\nyou can work with\n\n[00:41:29.829]\n\nones you uh you know, I'm sorry\n\n[00:41:31.920]\n\nto put it that way, you can edit content\n\n[00:41:33.929]\n\nthat you've created for, you can create something brand\n\n[00:41:36.268]\n\nnew and for first time users\n\n[00:41:38.840]\n\nthis is really handy because one\n\n[00:41:40.960]\n\nof the things you can do is import a\n\n[00:41:43.059]\n\nresume. So if you've already got say a\n\n[00:41:45.099]\n\nword version or pdf,\n\n[00:41:47.309]\n\nyou can import it\n\n[00:41:49.110]\n\nand then you know, finish your editing\n\n[00:41:51.329]\n\nhere. You can start from\n\n[00:41:53.380]\n\nscratch and just kind of fill in the blanks as\n\n[00:41:55.539]\n\nneeded. Or I think one of the interesting\n\n[00:41:57.869]\n\nthings here they've got this use stample content\n\n[00:42:00.460]\n\nand basically it lets you pick\n\n[00:42:02.710]\n\nfrom a bunch of different kind of\n\n[00:42:04.880]\n\nuh\n\n[00:42:06.300]\n\nresumes and what I like about\n\n[00:42:08.460]\n\nit is you get this example of what\n\n[00:42:10.840]\n\nsomething what a resume might look like\n\n[00:42:13.090]\n\nand while the industry may not be\n\n[00:42:15.190]\n\nspecific to what you're looking for,\n\n[00:42:17.250]\n\nlike say the marketing\n\n[00:42:19.000]\n\num you get\n\n[00:42:21.800]\n\na sense of what a resume should look like, what\n\n[00:42:23.940]\n\nkind of information should be there. So\n\n[00:42:25.980]\n\nit's it's an interesting way to kind of work with\n\n[00:42:28.050]\n\nan example. You just can't then\n\n[00:42:30.059]\n\ncan go in and edit each bit of\n\n[00:42:32.150]\n\nthe content. So\n\n[00:42:33.699]\n\nI have not been an executive system at\n\n[00:42:35.809]\n\nsmith inc so I could always go in\n\n[00:42:37.809]\n\nand just make changes\n\n[00:42:40.800]\n\nand fill in the blanks here.\n\n[00:42:43.400]\n\nAnd you've got\n\n[00:42:45.500]\n\na lot of formatting. Healthcare, which I appreciate.\n\n[00:42:48.179]\n\nThat is not my forte. You know, making\n\n[00:42:50.260]\n\nmy resume looks good. I can certainly\n\n[00:42:52.679]\n\nuse the help if you look over on the left,\n\n[00:42:55.199]\n\nwe've got templates, you can choose from. If\n\n[00:42:57.268]\n\nI open that up,\n\n[00:42:59.099]\n\nit will give me options for a different format.\n\n[00:43:03.400]\n\nThis one add a little color.\n\n[00:43:06.400]\n\nAll right and again, don't forget we\n\n[00:43:08.460]\n\nhave those areas of database that are helping you write\n\n[00:43:10.659]\n\nthis. So that's why it's another nice little\n\n[00:43:12.849]\n\nbit. We've got the database back here for\n\n[00:43:14.920]\n\nus. I can jump back into the career advice\n\n[00:43:16.949]\n\ngoing to the resume section as I'm working\n\n[00:43:19.079]\n\non this. Right? So should I include a\n\n[00:43:21.090]\n\nphoto or not? You know, that's that's kind of debatable\n\n[00:43:23.510]\n\nnowadays. So you've got the\n\n[00:43:25.659]\n\ncareer tools to help guide you,\n\n[00:43:28.000]\n\nright? There's lots of formatting help\n\n[00:43:30.179]\n\nup here at the top. So changing the colors\n\n[00:43:32.250]\n\nof things. Maybe if I want a blue instead,\n\n[00:43:35.900]\n\nmake that choice.\n\n[00:43:37.500]\n\nAlright, take out there. Um so\n\n[00:43:39.880]\n\nwe can, you know, make adjustments,\n\n[00:43:41.969]\n\nsomething important that you've got\n\n[00:43:44.119]\n\nlots of tools for the way this works. But the\n\n[00:43:46.170]\n\nmost important thing I want to share here is\n\n[00:43:48.400]\n\nthe settings for your resume\n\n[00:43:51.300]\n\nbecause when you're creating this right, we're in an\n\n[00:43:53.409]\n\nonline environment. So there's the benefit\n\n[00:43:55.469]\n\nof the actually being able to publish it and put\n\n[00:43:57.579]\n\nit online if you want to. By\n\n[00:44:00.090]\n\ndefault, when you're creating a resume,\n\n[00:44:02.380]\n\nwe are set to resume. Type\n\n[00:44:04.469]\n\nexport only.\n\n[00:44:05.989]\n\nSo that means I'm the only one who can\n\n[00:44:08.010]\n\nsee this resume and I can download\n\n[00:44:10.690]\n\nit. I can give it to someone that\n\n[00:44:12.909]\n\nway. But really it's I can only take this\n\n[00:44:15.050]\n\nresume out of the resource and then\n\n[00:44:17.099]\n\ngive it to someone. So certainly I can print it\n\n[00:44:19.190]\n\nout or I can, you know, attach it to an email\n\n[00:44:21.480]\n\nwhatever I need to do,\n\n[00:44:22.889]\n\nbut it's kind of the most the highest privacy\n\n[00:44:25.210]\n\nlevels setting here is export only. So that's\n\n[00:44:27.340]\n\nwhat we default to.\n\n[00:44:29.590]\n\nYou can also make it on the list.\n\n[00:44:31.730]\n\nWell, no, let me go from kind of both extremes\n\n[00:44:34.039]\n\nand then come back to the middle choice. So public\n\n[00:44:36.690]\n\nwould actually publish your resume\n\n[00:44:38.780]\n\nout on the internet. So if someone search\n\n[00:44:40.809]\n\nfor Stacy Knibloe, they might find this resume.\n\n[00:44:43.989]\n\nI even have a U R. L, but I conclude\n\n[00:44:46.360]\n\nand stay a cover letter. This would be the\n\n[00:44:48.429]\n\nU. R. L. I could just copy and paste that right\n\n[00:44:50.599]\n\ninto a cover letter uh that I'm sending\n\n[00:44:52.630]\n\nto a prospective employer. They'll be able to click that\n\n[00:44:54.780]\n\nlink and see this resume,\n\n[00:44:56.690]\n\nRight? But you become searchable\n\n[00:44:58.780]\n\nby search engines when you choose this public\n\n[00:45:01.090]\n\noption. So that's kind of the most extreme\n\n[00:45:03.170]\n\nlevel. The happy medium\n\n[00:45:05.449]\n\nis unlisted.\n\n[00:45:07.090]\n\nSo you don't become searchable with\n\n[00:45:09.139]\n\nthis option, you wouldn't be able to search\n\n[00:45:11.170]\n\nfor Stacy Knibloe on the internet and find this resume,\n\n[00:45:13.579]\n\nbut it does create a web page\n\n[00:45:15.809]\n\nfor you. So, again, I could still choose\n\n[00:45:17.920]\n\nwho I give it to. So again, prospective employers\n\n[00:45:20.289]\n\nin a cover letter or wherever I want to put it,\n\n[00:45:22.690]\n\nI suppose it to my linkedin page or something\n\n[00:45:25.289]\n\nyou can use that you are around. But that's\n\n[00:45:27.309]\n\nthe only way people will be able to find this resume\n\n[00:45:29.570]\n\nis if they have that.\n\n[00:45:32.090]\n\nSo these settings are really important\n\n[00:45:34.389]\n\nand it is again the default\n\n[00:45:37.250]\n\nis always exporting,\n\n[00:45:38.889]\n\nbut it's a great way to get your name\n\n[00:45:41.000]\n\nout there. If you can publish\n\n[00:45:43.119]\n\nthis online. Right? And I don't have to create\n\n[00:45:45.119]\n\na web page to do it. Visual C. V has done\n\n[00:45:47.309]\n\nit. So bury\n\n[00:45:49.449]\n\nit. So\n\n[00:45:51.800]\n\nlots of good stuff here. I will point\n\n[00:45:53.820]\n\nout, oh, um should this come up,\n\n[00:45:55.920]\n\nI can feel, I can see people rushing to\n\n[00:45:57.969]\n\nthe references for help with this. So in the history\n\n[00:46:00.360]\n\nsection you can see the different versions you've\n\n[00:46:02.409]\n\ncreated. I just created this one. So I don't\n\n[00:46:04.570]\n\nreally have a revision history,\n\n[00:46:06.380]\n\nbut if you've done some work you're like, oh my gosh,\n\n[00:46:08.409]\n\nnone of this is good. I want to go back to what it was.\n\n[00:46:10.679]\n\nYou can go back to an earlier version\n\n[00:46:12.800]\n\nof the resume.\n\n[00:46:15.880]\n\nYeah. Really excellent tool\n\n[00:46:18.110]\n\nhere. Again, keep in mind all the help that's within\n\n[00:46:20.349]\n\nthe resource itself\n\n[00:46:22.179]\n\nto get you to um writing\n\n[00:46:24.539]\n\na great resume too, so\n\n[00:46:26.550]\n\nthat all that's there. Um and there's\n\n[00:46:28.610]\n\nthere's good stuff in their health as well. People\n\n[00:46:30.610]\n\ninto the knowledge center, so\n\n[00:46:33.389]\n\nno shortage of helpful books and\n\n[00:46:37.380]\n\nalready, so let's go ahead and start getting\n\n[00:46:39.820]\n\non with the rest of your day. We'll\n\n[00:46:41.820]\n\ngo ahead and and wrap up here. So I do want\n\n[00:46:43.969]\n\nto share a couple of thoughts on,\n\n[00:46:45.880]\n\nyou know, you are always going to be the one often\n\n[00:46:48.360]\n\npointing your users to this resource, but\n\n[00:46:50.518]\n\nthere are other ways to get them in kind of a more\n\n[00:46:53.480]\n\npassive way. Marc records\n\n[00:46:55.500]\n\nare a great way to do that. What we've done is create\n\n[00:46:57.860]\n\nMark records for subject hub pages\n\n[00:47:00.268]\n\nand e books.\n\n[00:47:01.579]\n\nSo the e book's pretty, you know,\n\n[00:47:03.639]\n\nself explanatory that Marc records going to take\n\n[00:47:05.829]\n\nfolks right to the e book content in\n\n[00:47:07.829]\n\nthe resource. So they search in your catalog\n\n[00:47:10.190]\n\nfor master the asvab boom, they land\n\n[00:47:12.518]\n\nin the database,\n\n[00:47:13.900]\n\nthey grabbed that length.\n\n[00:47:15.579]\n\nThe subject hubs are those pages\n\n[00:47:17.699]\n\nwhere we've gathered all the stuff we have for\n\n[00:47:19.730]\n\nwhatever practice exams for the college Planning\n\n[00:47:22.090]\n\ncenter, for the Career center of those\n\n[00:47:24.179]\n\nthings.\n\n[00:47:25.079]\n\nThat kind of home page that each of these items\n\n[00:47:27.440]\n\nhave and directs them there. So if I come\n\n[00:47:29.500]\n\ninto your catalog and search for\n\n[00:47:31.510]\n\nS A T, I'm going to land on a page that\n\n[00:47:33.630]\n\ngives me the online course. It gives\n\n[00:47:35.690]\n\nme the practice test and gives me the ebook,\n\n[00:47:38.480]\n\nright? So this is a great way\n\n[00:47:40.518]\n\nto drive users into the resource. And\n\n[00:47:42.610]\n\nthe marc records are,\n\n[00:47:44.880]\n\nand of course loaded in your catalog. We also\n\n[00:47:47.268]\n\nhave these links available though, just\n\n[00:47:49.360]\n\nas you are l so you can post them\n\n[00:47:51.440]\n\nin a tweet, you could post it into\n\n[00:47:53.690]\n\nan email and online newsletter.\n\n[00:47:55.800]\n\nUm, you know, maybe that goes out to parents or\n\n[00:47:57.829]\n\npatrons or something like that. So\n\n[00:48:00.670]\n\nwhere you can get all of this, the mark records\n\n[00:48:02.889]\n\nand the direct lengths\n\n[00:48:05.369]\n\nis right through our support page support dot\n\n[00:48:07.570]\n\ngale dot com. We've got the Marc\n\n[00:48:09.579]\n\nRecords, we've got those, you are rows,\n\n[00:48:11.969]\n\num, you can also find lots of great\n\n[00:48:14.059]\n\ntraining materials there if you are in a\n\n[00:48:16.110]\n\nschool setting or you're in a public\n\n[00:48:18.510]\n\nlibrary setting or well really any setting,\n\n[00:48:20.829]\n\nwe've created a training deck for this resource.\n\n[00:48:23.260]\n\nSo we've created a bunch of slides. You\n\n[00:48:25.940]\n\ncustomize a little bit and boom,\n\n[00:48:27.949]\n\nit's ready to go out to a presentation here,\n\n[00:48:30.369]\n\nparents to teachers and students.\n\n[00:48:32.768]\n\nYou've got power point slides, ready to\n\n[00:48:34.809]\n\ngo.
