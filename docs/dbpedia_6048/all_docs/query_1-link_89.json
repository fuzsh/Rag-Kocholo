        "text": "Cooper Health Careers Initiative (CHCI) is a new program in partnership with several local organizations that was designed to help Camden residents interested in health care to learn valuable skills as a medical coders. CHCI will provide participants with access to pre-training support and coaching to complete a certification program in medical coding offered by Camden County College.\n\nHopeworks will be providing key portions of the program including the pre-career preparation and life skills training, academic support, and ongoing supportive employment while participants complete their coding certificate. As Rosemary Irizarry, one of the GIS Interns taking advantage of this opportunity shared, “I love the fact that it'll give me the chance to learn more about the medical field while also mixing with my experience in data entry. It'll also give me the opportunity to expand my knowledge in the medical field to further prep me for any time it might be needed.”"
