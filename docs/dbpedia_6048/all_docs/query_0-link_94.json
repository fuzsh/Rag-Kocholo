        "text": "“Hot dog, let me at ‘em!” was always what I used to say to prep me for the onslaught of customers from a weekend dinner rush at the famous (and now closed) restaurant I worked at in college — Shady Grove in Austin, Texas.\n\nWhat started as a joke became a mantra of mine to stay positive and give life everything I got.\n\nEver since I was a kid, I have been obsessed with music. I started playing guitar and piano at a young age, and was performing with my guitar teacher at biker bars in my hometown of Dallas at age nine.\n\nMy parents were incredibly supportive, enrolling me in jazz camps, an arts-centric high school, and cheering me on at all of my shows. I moved to Austin to “make it” as a rockstar and live happily ever after.\n\nAfter spending most of my 20s completely engrossed in the music world — recording with several bands, touring the country, and dabbling with booking tours for other artists — I stumbled upon web development after building a website for one of my bands.\n\nI enjoyed it so much that I began building websites for a bunch of local musicians. One thing led to another and web development became my full time gig!\n\nAs a web developer, I am able to utilize many of the same skills I learned as a musician — from creative collaboration to audience engagement and thinking outside the box.\n\nI love seeing innovative ideas come to life on the web and working with the talented people at Lifeblue to deliver meaningful results for our clients!\n\nAs a true Enneagram 9, I strive for peace and calmness in all aspects of my life. It’s natural for me to seek out the path of least resistance. At the gym, this (apparently) makes me lazy. In the corporate world, however, I’m cherished as a friendly mediator between my clients’ challenges and the solution.\n\nWhile I started out learning front end development, I soon discovered my passion for managing digital projects.\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy reading, rewatching one of the Harry Potter movies, or hiking in my home state of Arkansas.\n\nMost often, though, you’ll find me wrangling my (almost) toddler — being a parent is all-consuming but it’s also my favorite!\n\nLights, camera …ACTION!\n\nGrowing up, my favorite part of movies was the bonus content on the DVD (remember DVDs?). I’m always fascinated by how movies are crafted and the stories they tell through a certain lens.\n\nMy interest only grew when I was 12 years old and got ahold of Windows Me, which came with Windows Movie Maker installed so I could learn how to edit just like the pros (if they used free, amateur software).\n\nAt the age of 16, I bought my first camcorder and thus, the home movies began\n\nI’ve been lucky enough to turn my hobby into my profession. For the past 10 years, I’ve had the opportunity to craft stories about people from all walks of life and I hope to continue to tell those stories for the next 10 years.\n\nEverybody’s got a story so what’s yours — and how can I help you tell it?\n\nAs someone who’s both hands-on and goal-oriented, there’s nothing better than helping to refine a product into a first-rate, bug-free software application.\n\nMany of the skills that serve me as a QA tester also serve other areas of my life.\n\nWhen I’m not working, you’ll usually find me in the kitchen whipping up new recipes.\n\nI love how creative the cooking process is — from developing flavors to prepping the presentation of a dish.\n\nGrowing up in Southeastern India, cooking with family was a highlight of my childhood. It influenced some of my favorite dishes to make today, like Coconut Milk Lamb Biryani and Indian Fusion Thai red curry.\n\nBeyond the creativity of cooking, though, I also enjoy the logistical challenge of timing each dish — just like the ever-evolving process of testing and launching software.\n\nThat’s something that my teammates at Lifeblue innately understand — we’re a stronger team when we get to be our best selves both in and out of work.\n\nWhether it’s QA insights, my passion for cooking or any other aspect of life, I feel valued at Lifeblue for everything I bring to the table.\n\nI always had an interest in all things related to art, from figure drawing and painting to sculpture and graphic design.\n\nI’m originally from upstate New York, and I began my career working in the print world designing logos, identity systems, brochures, and advertising campaigns while attending college in western New York.\n\nIn graduate school I started exploring broadcast film and animation along with web design. I worked with multiple design/advertising agencies in the Northeast and Midwest and eventually worked my way out to Texas to work with Lifeblue.\n\nI enjoy the challenge of bring brands to life on the web, but what I enjoy about working with Lifeblue are the challenges and growth opportunities given to every employee. If you’re looking to progress in your career or simply learn a new skill, Lifeblue will help support you in that journey. It’s the first company I’ve worked for that encourages its employees to become active participants in the shaping of its culture and the way it executes its work.\n\nThe fact that I’m a fully functioning adult with a full-time job is kind of a miracle, considering I spent every single summer I should have been interning as a camp counselor covered in chorine, glitter, and Texas sweat. I’d argue, however, that those are the very same skills that have gotten me where I am today. Solving soccer-field conflicts and coming up with last-minute rainy day activities can take you surprisingly further than you think.\n\nIn my case, those experiences always led me to human-centered opportunities across the education and nonprofit spaces and even into the music industry, the startup world, and the fintech sector, for which I feel incredibly fortunate. Surrounded by so much inspiration, I used to think I wanted to change the world, but the older I get, the more I realize I really just want to make it a softer and easier place for people. Getting to pursue my passion for connecting the dots and solving the puzzles for people-first companies has been a professional dream come true, and I’m happy to be doing this work alongside all the smart and caring humans at Lifeblue.\n\nI want to make an impact through systems change — tackling the root causes of disparity, rather than “fixing” one issue, like hunger or employment.\n\nThat’s why I like to think of myself as a mastermind — for good.\n\nPreviously, I coordinated a training and job placement program to help people without a college degree gain skills in marketing and advertising.\n\nWorking in the nonprofit space, I witnessed how people’s lives are exponentially impacted when any of their basic human needs aren’t met.\n\nLifting up others through vibrant experiences is truly a passion of mine, which I channel into serving our Lifeblue clients.\n\nAs a producer, there’s something new every day — and you’d better believe I’m using Post-its to stay on top of it all.\n\nIf I could, I’d be on the golf course every day — trying to hit that shot that keeps me coming back.\n\nOftentimes, you’ll find me golfing with my neighborhood’s league, equipped with a scope — the device that I’m looking through in my photo, which measures distances and tracks personal stats.\n\nIt probably isn’t a shock that growing up, I wanted to be a pro athlete.\n\nSince that wasn’t in the cards, though, I pursued the next best thing — a career in sports.\n\nWhile I was born and raised in Erie, Pennsylvania, the fourth snowiest city in the country, I’ve lived in Cleveland, Ohio for the last 20 years.\n\n“The Land” offers a perfect combination of all four seasons, very kind people, an amazing arts & culture scene, and three professional sports teams.\n\nI’m a die-hard Browns, Guardians and Cavs fan — and worked for the Cleveland Guardians for five years after graduating with my master’s degree in Sport Management from Kent State University.\n\nJoining Lifeblue is an amazing opportunity to put my experience towards serving our TurnStyle partners.\n\nIt’s exciting to be part of a team with authentic people who are committed to doing amazing things, but always with a purpose.\n\nPlus, we never take ourselves too seriously or forget to have fun along the way.\n\nOutside of work — and golfing — I enjoy spending time with my wife and two kids, whether it’s coaching one of their youth sports teams or planning our next family adventure.\n\nDespite being a native Texan, in a past life, I must’ve been an Italian grandmother because I’m never happier than when I’m in the kitchen with a glass of wine while a Bolognese simmers on the stove in preparation for a dinner party with family and friends.\n\nAlmost no one leaves my house without a full stomach — my partner claims this penchant for feeding everyone constantly is a “problem” because “his pants don’t fit anymore,” but I think sharing a home-cooked meal is one of the best ways to show someone you care!\n\nSimilarly, I’ve always sought out opportunities that focus on service. From being a camp counselor to teaching preschool to client services, helping others achieve their goals in a supportive environment has always been at the core of what I do.\n\nWorking at Lifeblue is so exciting because everyone here shares that passion for service and shows it daily in their incredible work!\n\nWhen I was 12, in the midst of being influenced by video games The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past and Earthbound, my family got our first computer. I was also becoming a huge sports fan, and spent an inordinate amount of time creating pixel art versions of the team logos and players I liked using my first design software – Microsoft Paint. It wasn’t until halfway through college, an abandoned computer science degree, and a degree in journalism did I create my first profit-generating website “just for fun”. It was then that I realized I could make this a job.\n\nSince those days, I’ve worked as a print and packaging designer well-versed in press checks, papers, pantone swatches and overprint ink techniques, an environmental graphic designer with hands in sculptural signage, murals, and hundreds of architectural finishes, and digital design in the worlds of apps, the web and kiosks. I embrace the T-shaped nature of Lifeblue by doing whatever I can to help, including working with a super talented team of developers and designers to make our best work possible.\n\nI started coding in 2015 when I came to the U.S. for college at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut. We had this professor who made me especially interested in web development — building and hosting applications.\n\nWith coding, I love having the ability to build something from scratch with team members. We need a lot of collaboration, which I think is more interesting. Also, I enjoy automating things so just a click of a button can solve people’s daily problems.\n\nI think Lifeblue will allow me to collaborate with others and do a deeper dive into new cloud based technologies while doing good for society and the community.\n\nWhen I’m not coding and solving problems, I play tennis almost every day with friends. I also love riding bikes around the city and taking long drives.\n\nI was always around sports growing up, as my father was a well-known sports publicist. Following somewhat in his footsteps, I went to the best sports management program in the country at UMass Amherst. My first entry-level job was with ESPN in New York, in their advertising department. I eventually moved on to start my sales career right here in Dallas with Frisco Roughriders. I moved on to management with the Staten Island Yankees, NBA’s Indiana Pacers, Washington Nationals, and the Texas Rangers. I’ve spent nearly 20 years with 6 professional teams in sales including MLB, NBA, and minor league baseball.\n\nPersonally, I love traveling, especially to the Caribbean (I’ve been to 5 islands), as well as playing sports with my kids (especially baseball). I enjoy playing Madden Football on Xbox, and spending time with family and on my own personal fitness. Professionally, I love helping companies solve their business challenges and figuring out how to best to drive revenue.\n\nMy favorite thing about Lifeblue is the incredible level of collaboration and positivity/can-do attitude that exists here.\n\nMy love for business started the moment I realized no one was going to pay me to play sports, which in my case was very early on. I never believed that I had to know everything before doing anything, even if it meant I knew nothing to start. I have had the chance to work on a fascinating and diverse set of projects in my career, including as the leader of one of the country’s largest employment screening companies. I work as hard as I can for all my teams and my clients because it is a quantifiable edge.\n\nMy favorite thing about Lifeblue is its culture of togetherness and mutual respect. We spend a lot of time thinking about how we can be better as a team, and I believe that our customers feel this impact in the work we create for them. Outside of work I spend as much time as I can with my wife and our two daughters. My selfish pleasure is to play golf, and that can borderline on an obsession.\n\nAs a native of Raleigh, North Carolina, I was fascinated with three things: the Tar Heels, baseball, and drawing. My main drawing obsession? Superman. I regularly wore my red cape in kindergarten and as I got older, dreamed about being an illustrator for DC Comics.\n\nAfter studying art and business in college — though spending most of my time on the baseball field — I quickly discovered that I’ve got a knack for connecting with people through content marketing and digital tech.\n\nSince then, I’ve gathered incredible experiences across industries. The way I look at it, every new opportunity is a chance to expand my thinking and skillset.\n\nAfter starting in the beverage industry, I moved into advertising, specifically for TV and digital ads. Then I moved to Tennessee, where I shifted to higher ed marketing and later into the arts & culture space, which eventually led me to Lifeblue!\n\nAsk anyone about Lifeblue and they’ll tell you, it’s the people who make us so special — from our team members to our outstanding partners, we’re surrounded by thoughtful, purpose-driven people.\n\nOur team creates stunning digital experiences and I’m excited to build exceptional relationships with partners so we can deliver even more.\n\nOutside of this work, I’m a filmmaker and freelance portrait photographer. Between regular disc golf and training for my first half marathon, I’m very active and live just outside of Nashville with my wife, two dogs, and four cats (don’t judge).\n\nI thought I was going to do a lot of different things over the years: make movies, write criticism, code websites, put my stamp on Google.\n\nWhile all of that’s happened, it didn’t lead where I expected.\n\nI’ve learned to accept that because, along the way, I fell in love with the promise of the web: to connect and empower anyone, anywhere, at any time.\n\nIf it can be conceived, it can be coded, to paraphrase Stanley Kubrick.\n\nFor me, it’s critical to create digital experiences that matter.\n\nAfter leading Lifeblue’s front-end development for more than seven years, I headed to Google in 2020 to try and make that “dent in the universe,” as Steve Jobs would say.\n\nUltimately, though, I realized that my best opportunity to connect and empower people was right back here at Lifeblue.\n\nNow, I get to support people across our agency so they can best serve our partners and their missions.\n\nI started programming TI-83 calculators to cheat math exams in middle school. It was more work than the math which was an early indicator of what I was passionate about – coding. I’ve been developing ever since for web, indie games, devices, a dabble of machine learning and other binary adventures.\n\nI’m a father, a craftsman, an outdoorsman, and a gamer. I love to camp and mountain bike. I love to spend time with my children and remodel/upgrade our home. I play video games and emphatically think that DOOM is one of the best games ever made.\n\nLifeblue’s Results Only policy lets me work toward what I am passionate about, unfettered by stresses of trivial and frustrating rules. The people are genuine, devoid of unnecessary drama and filled with kindness and appreciation for one another. I enjoy that its smaller, close-knit, and that you actually know everyone whether or not you work with them on a daily basis.\n\nI lived in Paraguay until I was 12 when my dad — chasing adventure and flower power — convinced my mom to spend a year in Miami.\n\nSince most people at my new school had never met someone from Paraguay before, one kid joked, “What — is your dad the king of Paraguay or something?” “Yeah,” I said, “And I’m the prince.”\n\nSince then, the nickname “Prince” stuck. So did Miami.\n\nAside from attending the University of Florida to pursue computer programming, I’ve lived in Miami ever since. And as someone who loves piña coladas and conch fritters, I wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nIt’s also given me a unique opportunity to explore creative endeavors.\n\nAfter college, I worked at a modern contemporary art gallery, handling everything from event planning to logistics, like shipping pieces.\n\nMy first responsibility: prepping for Art Basel — the hottest ticket in the international art world.\n\nAfter a few years, I returned to my computer programming roots, joining forces with a friend to design and develop websites on a freelance basis. Our business grew by word of mouth, reaching doctors, lawyers, and entrepreneurs.\n\nWhile I loved the work, operations — like billing and invoicing — could end up overshadowing the actual projects. So, I’ve relished the opportunity to focus solely on development at Lifeblue — tackling more complex projects while growing alongside my fellow developers.\n\nBorn and raised in Paris, I always appreciated the cuisine and getting to visit monuments to learn about France’s rich history.\n\nAlthough I grew up without cable, I did have a computer — a Dell Windows XP 2002 — that I spent my days on, surfing the web. After high school, I didn’t really know what to do with my life, but since I’d always loved computers, my father recommended I try getting into tech.\n\nOn the first day at university, my professor wrote a line of code enabling us to open a webpage that said, “Hello, world. Here’s how we build websites.”\n\nI felt like I’d discovered fire — and I haven’t stopped building sites since.\n\nBoth at work and outside of it, I’m committed to chasing my dreams. A few of those include learning Japanese; traveling through Asia; experiencing weightlessness on a gravity-free flight; and eventually, writing a book, perhaps about my travels. So far, I’ve explored the U.S., the Netherlands, Greece, the Dominican Republic, England, Mali, and Colombia — and I’m just getting started.\n\nI am originally from Chicago — who would have thought moving to Texas would be one of the best things I could have done. I got hired by a great company, Lifeblue, and I can honestly say I enjoy going to work everyday! I have met some wonderful people at Lifeblue and I love how many fun events we have. If I am not in the office, I am at home busy taking care of my 2 boys and 2 rescue dogs. My family and I love to travel, spend time at the pool and attend baseball games. Since we are new to Texas, there is always something new to see or explore and we are enjoying every minute of it.\n\nXanadu is one of the worst movies ever made. It’s also my favorite.\n\nAs a kid, my dad introduced me to the dizzying ‘80s film, which features Olivia Newton-John roller skating around Gene Kelly to the sounds of Electric Light Orchestra. It’s weird, it’s campy and it honestly doesn’t make any sense.\n\nThat’s why I love it. I’ve always been drawn to the unexpected, which is why I got into journalism. From covering the chaos of the Texas legislature to reporting the region’s top breaking news stories at The Dallas Morning News, I’ve had the privilege of learning for a living and informing the public through my writing.\n\nPivoting to PR and marketing recently has let me use those skills to help organizations tell their stories in innovative ways. It’s all about homing in on what makes them different. Essentially, what’s their Xanadu?\n\nCreativity has always played a significant role in how I engage with the world — from acting at drama camp to painting and eventually, to visual design.\n\nMy passion for visual design is fueled by striving for balance by identifying patterns and making connections. Web design encompasses a range of thinking and skills that I am deeply passionate about: critical thinking, communication, business strategy, collaboration and design.\n\nThroughout my career as a designer, I’ve harnessed my appreciation for research, empathy and visual prowess to execute solution-driven projects.\n\nOutside of work, I love getting outdoors for a hike or a bike ride — whether that’s in my hometown in Southern California or where I currently live in Asheville, N.C. Also, I’m a loving mom to a growing number of houseplants.\n\nI’ve been teaching myself scripting languages since 1985, when I took a job as a computer operator, staring at a green screen that was running command line programs for oil and gas lease accounting for the federal government. I took the job because it sounded better than doing plumbing outdoors in the extreme Colorado weather, but I quickly discovered I had an aptitude for programming — and I enjoyed the sense of accomplishment that came with developing new solutions.\n\nA few decades or so later, I still am driven by the challenge of providing the best service possible through the software I help build. I’ve worked in a variety of industries, including eight years with the technology architecture group at EDS in Dallas and a stint helping create network systems for General Motors’ Saturn line, which redefined how cars were produced.\n\nI’ve picked up maybe a dozen programming languages over the years, but none of the old ones are dead to me. The fundamentals I learned with my first script are a part of the process I still apply today: There is a sequence of things that need to happen, a set of consequences, and a next step to deal with those consequences.\n\nAnd when you look at it that way, programming is a lot like everyday life.\n\nFrom history major, to Air Force Officer, to web design business owner, my path has been an interesting one. From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated with the idea of building a business, and as I got further into it, found that I enjoy all of the behind the scenes work that goes on to make a company successful. One of my favorite things about Lifeblue is watching new employees come on board. Because of the entrepreneurial nature of our culture, so many will take a process, method or product that existed before and make it better for all. The bar for quality here is never-ending.\n\nI have this theory that every adult male in the John Hughes Cinematic Universe worked for the same Chicago advertising agency, so as a teenager, that’s where I aspired to be. Then, as an advertising major taking a required news reporting class in college, I saw All the President’s Men. I set up residence in the campus newspaper offices shortly thereafter.\n\nI grew up during more than two decades of reporting, writing, editing and producing the news – including 21 years at my hometown paper, The Dallas Morning News – with a commitment to thoroughness, fairness and credibility.\n\nI also fell in love with the art of digital storytelling and the power of reaching digital audiences. I grew to appreciate innovation, iteration and rapid change. And I came to learn that with a solid strategy, a brilliant message and a dynamic voice, all of us can be effective publishers."
