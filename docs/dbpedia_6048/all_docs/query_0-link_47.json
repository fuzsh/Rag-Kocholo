        "text": "Amidst the chaos of Covid and personal matters, I had taken a sabbatical from wine writing. What better way to brush off the dust and dive back into wine by writing about the person who has perhaps single handedly been the inspiration for my career both in food and wine.\n\nSo many people, stories, and wines have had a profound impact on me and my wine journey, so naming just one person is quite tough. That being said, after running a list through the entire gamut of my wine immersion, I kept returning to the same person. The first thought that came to my mind was, “what would his reaction be when finding himself on an international platform, one of the most respected wine publications at that, especially since he is not in the industry. But the more I brainstormed, the clearer it became that I should share him with the world, because we all need a wine person like him in our lives.\n\nWith the fear of sounding corny, here is why this is my favorite wine person.\n\nA Passion for Learning\n\nI grew up amidst Kingfisher beer, Peter Scott Whiskey, Old Monk Rum, and the very elite (1990s) Johnny Walker Scotch. Wine was literally non-existent in Delhi, India. So, when I decided to enter the wine world, not only was he supportive, but he joined me on this delightful but arduous excursion for no other reason than that he enjoys learning, period. He went from attending as many wine tastings that our local retail shops had to offer, to wine dinners, to entertaining new wine friends, supporting my new interest in the process.\n\nWhen the time came for me to take the leap into professional training and certifications, he was standing right there, reading wine books alongside me, so he could aptly prep me for the wine exams I was about to sit for. Did I mention not knowing facts is his pet peeve.\n\nIn fact, recently, I hosted a wine dinner. In 1814, President John Adams in wrote in a letter, “The shortest road to men’s hearts is down their throats”, aka the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach, which is a proverb I take literally. Needless to say, when I wanted to showcase the versatility of Fortified Wines (Sherry and Port), a wine pairing dinner was the way to go. With my hands tied down with food pairings, I suggested he run the tasting part of the evening. To my amusement, he promptly started reading my wine books. In fact, for the next 2 weeks, I found him researching and gaining as much knowledge as he could on the internet and Youtube.\n\nA relatively newcomer to the wine world, he demystified fortified wines and their intimidating facets in the most fun yet profound manner. A brilliant package of wit, intelligence, modesty, charm, and openness.\n\nIts knowledge and curiosity which fuels this person, which in turn motivates me to continue learning. After all, isn’t that also the beauty of wine? Its alive, constantly evolving, expressing something different with each sip.\n\nAn Open Mind\n\nWe as humans by nature are judgmental and biased. Not only do we judge appearance, we make up our minds without even trying, based on price. And no, its not about bragging rights for identifying a grape or region. Its opening your mind to listen to what the wine in context has to say.\n\nIrrespective of race, creed, gender, experience, expertise, or social status, he holds people in general as equals. And he extends this philosophy to wine too. Whether it’s a 5-euro simple wine, ultra-premium oak heavy Californian wine, a high alcohol sweet wine, a non-pronounceable grape or lesser-known wine region, he can find something to like if not love about it.\n\nOne leads by example, and he has showed me to not only have an open mind, but to be a good listener too.\n\nSensibilities and the Big Picture\n\nI too, like some of my wine colleagues, am guilty of taking wine for granted. At times, missing the big picture or even the historical significance of wine making, focusing on solely the price tag or fashionable trends. He, on the other hand, is easily one of the most balanced and fair people I have met. He keeps me honest. To him, the joy of wine is 50% taste, and 50% the human stories that weave around this liquid elixir.\n\nHe is a constant reminder that wine, like all fine art, is a reverent glimpse into our history, heritage, craft, and relentless pursuit of perfection. Like honest wines, he reminds me to keep true to myself. He is my daily reference point.\n\nUnconditional Love\n\nI can still recall the first visit to wine country, endearingly. We had decided to join a few of our friends (folks who regularly travel to wine regions on vacation), and I had recently started dabbling in the world of blogging (no formal training at this point). Our first winery visit of the day was a recommendation by a local Orlando Chef. Chatting with Ms. Florencia Palmaz, I assumed she was raised in a wine family. Florencia modestly clarified that her father is a physician by profession. Oh, he responded, what a coincidence, I am one too. What’s his specialty – IR (Interventional Radiology). I could literally hear the bells ringing. He exclaimed Wait a minute – Your father is Dr. Palmaz? THE Dr. Palmaz”. The man who invented the cardiac stent? This amazement, awe that I saw on his face, I still see it in him, each time we step into a winery and are able to share a few sips and stories with wine makers or producers.\n\nOh the paradox of wine! The world of wine is an endless journey of learning. You could be lucky enough to be born in a winery, your first steps would have been in the vineyard, the first solid food you ate – a grape. You could live an entire lifetime surrounded with wine, yet, you could still learn something new about wine. That’s the beauty and enigma of wine. It’s a humbling experience, and some of the most brilliant women and men I have had the privilege to befriend exude modesty, including him.\n\nHe is a true lover of life whose exuberance entices you to become a better person, give your best. And not take anything for granted. Each time I have had the opportunity to interact with him on our winery visits, its been nothing less than an exhilarating gastronomic and intellectual experience.\n\nMy Biggest Cheerleader aka Happiness Guru\n\nWhy do we chase and idealize celebrities we have never even met, when those who help us daily are our unsung heroes? Who are willing to take time to listen to us, understand us, and know just the right thing to say, especially when we need it most.\n\nFor example, I was sitting for the toughest portion of WSET Diploma, Unit 3: Light Wines of the World. The morning started with the usual butterfly in the belly, but soon it progressed to brain fog. In the middle of the first portion of the exam (3 flights of blind tasting), for the first time in my life I found myself having a panic attack. I was convinced at this point, I will flunk. I called him, sobbing, unable to speak coherently. His faith in me was unwavering. Calmly he responded, “You have worked tirelessly for these exams. YOU got this. Focus on the afternoon session” (another 3 flights of blind tasting followed by theory). He was right. I did pass unit 3 on my first attempt.\n\nFrom the first winery visit in 2014, fast forward 9+ years to 2023, endless wine and spirit tastings both blind and open, countless dirty glasses, sleepless nights, skipped meals, bookshelves filled with wine-related books and flash cards, multiple online wine subscriptions, various wine country trips, armed with a couple of professional certifications under my belt (DipWSET, Italian Wine Ambassador, Certified Sommelier), this person has been a friend, supporter, critic, mentor, student, dietician, travel companion, guidance counselor, chauffeur, drinking buddy, and more.\n\nIndustry professionals frequently tout the wine bottle that changed their lives. For me, it’s my wine person who has been instrumental in achieving my accomplishments, both in the wine and the food industry. Raising a glass to my favorite wine person, who also happens to be my life partner, my husband Rahul Mehta.\n\nAbout Author"
