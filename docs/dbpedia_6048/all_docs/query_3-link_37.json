Founded in 2011 and based in San Francisco, California, ClassDojo is a school communication platform that teachers, students, and families use every day to build strong relationships and supportive communities. This is done in two ways. One, by sharing what's being learned in the classroom back home through student portfolios, photos, videos, and messages. And, two, by helping students build social-emotional skills through in-classroom feedback and engaging activities. Today, 95% of pre K-8 schools in the U.S., as well as a further 180 countries, have joined ClassDojo.\n\nhttp://www.classdojo.com/"
