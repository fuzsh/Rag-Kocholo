The 1-1 learning experiences really helped me gain a detailed view of the industry & the day-to-day SDR role. I would most definitely recommend Entr Tech as it helped me get my foot in the door to launch my career in Tech. The whole program has opened up so many doors of opportunities, especially to someone without a university degree.\"\n\nRodrigo. D\n\nSales Development Representative\n\n\"The Entr Tech academy helped me to break into the tech industry, in a role I never imagined I would be in and I am so grateful for the experience. The training I received was of a high quality and standard and I appreciated the 1:1 support they provided. The Entr Tech initiative is a genuine one and can help you a lot in deciding what career path you want to follow.”\n\nWinta. G\n\nEnterprise Business Development Representative\n\n\"I couldn’t recommend the Entr Tech Academy enough! This course has been fundamental to prep me for a career in Tech Sales. There is a very comprehensive & detailed curriculum, which is outlined from the outset so there’s no smoke and mirrors. There is also mentorship program on graduation, so the support doesn’t stop. If you’re looking to get into the Tech industry, decide, commit and succeed with Entr Tech!\"\n\nGerrry. A\n\nSales Development Representative\n\n\"The Entr Tech academy has been one of the most enjoyable, informative & exciting professional experiences of my life. Both Jack and Jonny have been instrumental in guiding me through the process of understanding SaaS and the SDR role, as well as the potential career path within this incredible industry. In a rapidly changing world where so many people feel lost and without direction I've no doubt Entr Tech will be the cornerstone of success for countless graduates of the program. If you're considering a career in tech sales, I cannot recommend Jack, Jonny and the EntrTech process highly enough. Thank you for providing this service for me and for so many others. I can't wait to start my role as an SDR and to continue working closely with you both as I create purpose and success in a career which truly fulfils and excites me! THANK YOU!\"\n\nMichael. F\n\nSales Development Representative\n\n“When I joined The Entr Tech Academy I was unsure & sceptical, not sure what the course would be like and whether it would be of any use to me. I was taken aback from day 1. The course, the platform, the delivery & investment were beyond anything I could have imagined. The boys really are passionate about the industry & the opportunities it has for anyone looking to develop a career in Tech. Without Entr Tech I wouldn't be in the position that I am in now - Thank You.”\n\nFourtune. K\n\nSales Development Representative- Team Lead"
