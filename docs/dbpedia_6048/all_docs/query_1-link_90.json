        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nMaster your interviewing skills with PrepMeBuddy and increase your earning potential\n\nFor Mock Interviews\n\nWhat makes PrepMeBuddy different?\n\nWe provide very constructive feedback that immediately impacts the candidate’s performance, confidence, and self-portrayal. We do not believe in generic advice: instead, we focus on nuances of tone, word choice, and positioning. We are hands-on and invested in your success!\n\nWhen should I work with you?\n\nYou should work with us if: –\n\nyou’ve interviewed for a job that you knew you would be great at, but didn’t get it\n\ninterviews make you very nervous\n\nyou struggle with open-ended questions\n\nyou don’t feel like yourself in an interview setting\n\nyou have not had an interview in over a year\n\nWhat if I am not a good interviewee?\n\nEveryone is and can be a good interviewee – it simply takes practice and self-reflection to build up your confidence. That’s why we’re here If you don’t practice, your nerves tend to take over and detail you. We can help you with building your esteem.\n\nWIll I be interviewed by same expert every time?\n\nAfter your initial interview with us, the choice of sticking with the same expert or trying someone new is entirely up to you. However, we recommend staying with the same expert to track your progress and enhancements effectively.\n\nCan you create a custom offer depending on my requirements?\n\nYes. You can contact us on prepmebuddy@gmail.com and we can discuss your requirements further.\n\nAm I able to change my interview time after scheduling it?\n\nYou have the option to reschedule your interview, but keep in mind that the availability for your preferred date and time may be limited if the interviewer is already occupied with another interview.\n\nHow ahead should I schedule a mock interview?\n\nWe recommend scheduling at least 48 hours in advance. This allows us ample time to match you with the right expert based on your needs. However, we'll share our availability calendar with you so you can book according to the slots available.\n\nHow do I start?\n\nWhen you place an order, we’ll require a few items from you in order to look at your candidacy objectively (the job posting, your resume, and your years of experience). Once you complete the order, we will then send you a link to our calendar to book your session and send you a receipt. We’re ready to go!\n\nHow many sessions does it take to get good?\n\nIt depends. We don’t all start at the same place. I have excellent interviewees who simply want reassurance and we have candidates that can hardly pull together an answer due to their anxiety. We’ll map out your goals and how we’re going to get there, at a speed your comfortable with and is realistic.\n\nWhat do you mean by cheat sheet?\n\nWell, it would consists of topics/questions that you must know or need to brush up before you sit for any coding or technical interview. (for e.g Coding Cheat Sheet would include approaches on how to find that a given problem is a dynamic programming problem or a sliding window problem), etc.\n\nBy when can I expect the link to cheat sheet?\n\nOnce you create an order, you will be given a link to the cheat sheet to download you ordered in next 24-48 hours.\n\nCan you also teach System and Product design from scratch?\n\nIt depends on our experts availability. Please write to us at prepmebuddy@gmail.com and we will connect with you.\n\nCould you provide coaching or mentoring for my professional development as well?\n\nAbsolutely!
