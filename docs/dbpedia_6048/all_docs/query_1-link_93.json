        "text": "I am an incoming Sophomore and I currently have all above 97% in my classes. I really want to work in the rocket/aerospace industry in the future. I plan to take AP Chemistry next year so I am taking an Honors Chemistry course over the summer to prepare me. At the moment, I am generally relaxed at school and next year I want to learn more and do my best. I am thinking of taking Pre Calc over the summer so I can take AP Calc AB in addition to my current forecasted classes during the year. Will I be able to handle this? I am also taking an early period English (once a week meeting) but I may be able to also squeeze that over the summer. I am already set on taking 3 APs.\n\nMy planned courses:\n\n-English (Early Period)\n\n-AP US History\n\n-Spanish III\n\n-Concert Band II\n\n-AP Calculus AB (The class I’m conflicted and not certain about taking, I really want to learn calculus but I know the workload is high)\n\n-AP Chemistry (I am taking Honors Chemistry over the summer which will prep me — normal chemistry is a prereq.)\n\n-AP Computer Science A — I already know how to code fluently so I expect this class to not be that difficult. I will be going over the Java language over the summer for fun.\n\n(Currently taking: APHUG, Algebra II, Biology, English, Concert Band I, and Spanish II)\n\nHopefully, I can get some advice.\n\nI think that these 4 APs are not too hard, however, a lot of this really depends on your school and your study habits.\n\nAt least in my district, we have precalculus between Alg 2 and Calc AB, so I feel like it's a big jump there. But, I'm assuming you're pretty good at math, The challenging part about calculus is that it will be unlike anything you've learned before, so you will need to pay attention to every detail. Absolutely make sure that you know how every type of function works, and always do the extra problems the teacher assigns when possible. If you're not satisfied with your performance in this class, it's not your intelligence that's the problem; it'll be your attitude. Just keep that in mind, that was my problem in this class.\n\nAPUSH is simply a memorization class, so as long as you know your history and can infer details, it won't be that bad. Many people have trouble with this aspect, but judging by your current grade point, you'll probably be fine. Also, AP human geo should adequately prepare you for that class.\n\nAs for chem, I've heard really conflicting accounts, and it really depends on your teacher. Our teachers are great and do a good job of making sure we understand the content, so chem actually is one of my most interesting classes. I've heard about other classes at other schools, however, where the class is one of the most difficult. Either way, as long as you enjoy the class, it'll be a fun challenge at worst and a breeze at best.\n\nAPCSA you're absolutely right. It's not that hard if you have any coding experience. I did python before that class, and my only prior java capabilities were printing and if/else statements. If I was fine in freshman year, you should definitely be fine in your sophomore year.\n\nI'm not necessarily sure what EP means, but I'm assuming it probably won't be as hard as your AP's.\n\nI also did 4 ap's this past sophomore year (AP Calc AB, AP Chem, APCSP, and APES). Obviously, my last 2 ap classes aren't nearly as hard as yours. If I would give any advice to you, putting in a study hall is an absolute godsend. If you have the means, absolutely do that. If not, manage your time well and don't procrastinate. Remember, your sophomore year is only what you make it to be. Good luck."
