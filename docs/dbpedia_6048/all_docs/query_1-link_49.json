I'd say that you wouldn't want to study for any less than three months.\n\nHere is some good info to get you started:\n\nElectrical PE Review's Recommended References for the Electrical PE Exam\n\nElectrical PE Review - What do Successful Engineers Have in Common?\n\nGood luck and don't be afraid to update us on your progress!\n\nHi Electrical Professionals,\n\nI worked the in solar industry for 6 years after graduation with a Mechanical Engineering Background. I decide to get my PE in EE.

You should have plenty of time to prepare for the October exam as long as you are consistent.\n\nHi Electrical Professionals,\n\nI worked the in solar industry for 6 years after graduation with a Mechanical Engineering Background.

(only took intro to EE in college about 12 years prior)\n\nrecommend the villanova course"
