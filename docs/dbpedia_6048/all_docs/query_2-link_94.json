        "text": "ADA was founded in 1947 by Eleanor Roosevelt, John Kenneth Galbraith, Walter Reuther, Hubert Humphrey, Arthur Schlesinger, and Reinhold Niebuhr shortly after FDR died. Our goal then? To keep the New Deal dream of a fair and prosperous America for all alive for generations to come.\n\nAs ADA turns 75, we remain a key player in protecting progress and building for the future so that the dream can come true. We are working with allied groups in Washington and in states even as we build and mobilize our grassroots network across the country.\n\nSupport ADA’s work and celebrate our 75th anniversary year with a contribution today!\n\nNote: Unless otherwise noted, profiles have been written by ADA Executive Committee Chair, Kurt Meyer. Enjoy!\n\nADA All Stars\n\nEleanor Roosevelt\n\nADA is marking… no, make that CELEBRATING!… our 75th birthday. This is the first of many outbound emails “toasting” this remarkable milepost (yes, I realize that’s a mixed metaphor). It’s appropriate that we begin this series by lifting up one of our founders, Eleanor Roosevelt, talking about ADA’s founding. This excerpt about ADA’s origin is from her syndicated newspaper column, My Day, which appeared in January, 1947.\n\n“I spent the whole day yesterday from 9:30 in the morning till after five in the afternoon with a group of people, many of whom I have known before, who were trying to set up a liberal and progressive organization. They chose as their name, “Americans United* for Democratic Action.” If they live up to that name, they will not only lay down certain principles, but they will find ways and means to acquaint the people of the country with their program.\n\n“In addition, they will organize the action which can be taken in any community in the nation if people are in agreement on specific programs. … I am joining with other progressives, many of whom are far younger and more active than I am, and far more influential, in an attempt to carry on the spirit of progress. We do not believe that what has been done in the past is the highest attainment that can be hoped for in a democratic nation.”\n\n“…We hope to face new situations and find new answers in line with the needs and best interests of our country and its people, never forgetting our relationship to the family of nations.”1\n\nKurt Meyer, ADA Executive Committee Chair\n\n* – The word “United” was obviously jettisoned at some point… I’ll seek out more information and share what I find.\n\n1 Eleanor Roosevelt, “My Day, January 6, 1947,” The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Digital Edition (2017), accessed 11/30/2021, https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers//myday/displaydocedits.cfm?_y=1947&_f=md000540.\n\nBack to Top\n\nDavid Dubinsky\n\nFor most of my life, David Dubinsky was little more than a name. Surely, I could have pegged him as a labor leader, which he was. But more than that, my memory was a bit blurry.\n\nToo bad, because David Dubinsky is quite a story. Indeed, he’s an ADA All-Star and a founding member, although I’m trying to verify whether he was at the “founding meeting” at the Willard, January, 1947. (I’ll keep you posted.)\n\nMore about “D.D.” as he was called: Born in 1892 in what’s now Belarus, the youngest of eight children, his family moved to Lodz, Poland, when he was three. His father owned a bakery, and David began working there while attending school, where he studied Polish, Russian and Yiddish. Eventually, he left school to work full time. He joined the bakers’ union and by age 15 was elected a union leader, due in part to his language fluency.\n\nIn 1907, he was arrested for his union activities and jailed for several days. He was arrested again the next year and sentenced to exile in Siberia. He escaped and made his way to New York City where he joined his older brother. Through union connections, he got a job as a cutter – one of the most skilled jobs in the garment industry – and joined the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union (ILGWU).\n\nDubinsky became president of his ILGWU local before he turned 30 and quickly got involved in his national union. He became ILGWU Secretary-Treasurer in 1929 and President in 1932, holding these positions until 1959 and 1966, respectively. (That’s right… one person holding all three posts for three-plus decades.)\n\nThere are many examples of Dubinsky as a trail blazer. He was a founder of the Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO). He helped launch the American Labor Party to organize progressives to vote for Democratic candidates. He helped create the Liberal Party of New York. And YES, he was a founding member of ADA!\n\nDubinsky was a colorful character. His view on strikes: “First you get a whip, and then when everyone knows you have it, you put it in the refrigerator.”; When he died in 1982, a glowing obituary in the New York Times noted, “With extraordinary flair and boundless energy… his speech was often blunt and down-to-earth, but he could also stir an audience with his idealism. He never lost his Yiddish accent, his tendency to wave his arms at the slightest provocation, or his loud voice, which started as a shout and went up from there.”\n\nThe Times also pointed out, “He was proud of his accomplishments, and would talk about them whether he was bicycle riding around New York wearing (his) distinctive beret, or assaulting huge baskets of onion rolls, highly spiced pickles, marinated herring and pastrami, washed down with Scotch or rum.” Sounds like quite a guy and a truly remarkable ADA All Star! Many more All Stars forthcoming under the celebratory banner, “ADA at 75: The Best Is Yet to Come”\n\nP.S. Two more “factoids” about Dubinsky. First, “Pins and Needles”, a 1937 Broadway musical, was inspired by D.D. and performed initially by members of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union. The show enjoyed the longest run of any musical up to that time. Second, Dubinsky’s national leadership role was undoubtedly boosted by his “close and constant friendship” with his favorite gin rummy partner, a fellow by the name of George Meany.\n\nBack to Top\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhen conducting research on today’s ADA All Star, in document after document, one constantly encounters the word “first”, as in “Patsy T. Mink was the FIRST person / woman / Hawaiian / Japanese-American / Asian-American / etc. to be (or accomplish) fill in the blank .”\n\nNo two ways about it: Today’s All Star, Patsy Takemoto Mink, was a trail blazer, a “path maker” more than a pathfinder, the later term suggesting a path exists if it can only be found. A few of her path-making firsts:\n\nMarvin and Dr. Evelyn Jones Rich\n\nLooking through ADA’s distinguished past, you can’t find a couple more essential to the organization’s first 75 years than Marvin and Evelyn Jones Rich. If you read into this statement a bit of foreshadowing, you’re right. This is another All-Star TEAM. And if this All-Star tribute is longer than normal, it’s because a list of this couple’s contributions to humankind is as long as your arm.\n\nMarvin & Evie Rich were an extraordinary team for every endeavor in which they participated. For many decades, they championed protecting civil liberties and civil rights, playing vital roles in what is often referred to as the Civil Rights Movement. They were important links in the circle that struggled for justice, which ultimately led to major changes in our country. ADA was but one beneficiary of their exceptional talents.\n\nMarvin’s activism began in the mid-1940s at Washington University in St. Louis, his hometown. World War II veterans had sacrificed for their country and, upon returning, sought social justice at levels previously unavailable at Washington University. He joined the Student Committee for the Admission of Negroes (SCAN), spearheading a campaign to admit Black students, which ultimately led to the integration of the University.\n\nMarvin was a founder of ADA’s St. Louis Chapter and was active in Students for Democratic Action (SDA). He also helped establish the St. Louis Chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), advocating successfully for the desegregation of public places, like restaurants, swimming pools, libraries, and department stores. In the mid-1950s, Marvin moved to New York City and joined the local CORE chapter.\n\nThe late Julian Bond talks about this era in his book, “Time to Teach: A History of the Southern Civil Rights Movement”: “In the late 1950s, the CORE organization began to decline. By 1957, there were only seven groups affiliated with CORE. Only seven people attended the 1957 CORE convention: four national officers and three delegates. The organization tried to rebuild… and in 1959 Marvin Rich became community relations director.” (Sounds like Marvin took on quite an assignment!)\n\nAmong his various duties, Marvin was responsible for program planning, materials research and development, preparing the annual budget, and fund-raising, including fund-raising with and for local CORE chapters. That Marvin was successful is seen by noting that by 1961 CORE had 53 chapters throughout the U.S, including active groups in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, South Carolina, and Kentucky. By 1963, most major urban centers had at least one CORE chapter. And lest you think this was all “office work”, Marvin also made periodic trips to the South, where in 1962 he was jailed for almost a week with Martin Luther King, Jr. in Albany, Georgia. In 1964 he was severely beaten as he observed a voter-registration demonstration in Holmes County, Mississippi.\n\nMarvin’s next professional move was to become Executive Director (later President) of the Scholarship, Education and Defense Fund for Racial Equality (SEDFRE). This organization implemented voter registration drives in the South, trained newly elected Black officials, and provided scholarships to activists expelled from Southern colleges for their civil rights activities.\n\nLater, Marvin was Director of Development at the New School for Social Research, Executive Director of the Queens College Foundation, and Special Assistant to the President as well as Director of the Capital Campaign at Mercy College. In the 1970s, he was a founder of the National Coalition against Censorship (NCAC) and held various leadership positions within the organization.\n\nOf course, during this same period, Marvin devoted countless hours to ADA, a commitment spanning more than five decades, where he served at different times as Treasurer, Chair of the Development Committee, Chair of the ADA Education Fund, and Chair of the Executive Committee. He was also President of New York City ADA and with his wife, Dr. Evelyn Jones Rich, ran the NYC chapter, which assembled much of this background information at the time of Marvin’s death, in December, 2018.\n\nDr. Rich has devoted her entire adult life to being an advocate and an activist in the fight for civil rights and justice, seeking equal opportunity for all. One description she applied to herself was “troublemaker”, reminiscent of Congressman John Lewis’s often-cited term, “good trouble”.\n\nBased on a story Evie tells, clearly she was pushing boundaries even as a child. She talks about her first job… delivering newspapers. Her brothers were all Philadelphia paperboys and Evie decided she was going to distribute papers and earn money, too. Her gender, however, prompted reluctance from her potential employer, who told her, “There’s no such thing as a paper GIRL. Who’s ever heard of such a thing?” Nevertheless, young Evelyn successfully persuaded him to hire her and tended faithfully to her paper route for several years.\n\nAs a college student at Bryn Mawr College, near Philadelphia – the first Black undergraduate student to live on campus all four years – Evie, like Marvin, joined Students for Democratic Action (SDA) and, by her actions, has embraced liberal / progressive principles ever since. Introduced to CORE by her future husband, she utilized the organization’s non-violent philosophy throughout her career as an educator, advocate, and foundation executive.\n\nIn addition to her profession as a teacher and professor, there were also various causes throughout the years: for instance, taking teachers to Africa to develop realistic curricula for U.S. students, lobbying the New York State legislature for adequate educational funding, testifying on issues including redistricting, aging concerns, and health care. Evie also helped found and direct Labor Arts a virtual museum displaying a cultural and artistic representation of the struggle of working people and celebrating the labor movement. And, she was always helping elect progressive candidates to office through ADA. According to ADA colleagues, one of Evie’s remarkable gifts was that of public speaking, including making “the fund-raising pitch” at ADA banquets, always with considerable returns.\n\nMany who knew Marvin & Evie Rich well praised their 62-year marriage. One of Marvin’s civil rights colleagues, noted, “More important than his role in the movement was Marvin the family man. He and Evie were and are models of what love and family should be.” Another observed, “We treasure his commitment to family and friends and those in need.” Perhaps the best tribute came from Amy Isaacs, former ADA National Director, speaking at Marvin’s memorial service.\n\n“My first national ADA meeting… I sat in a room with a gentle giant whom I would come to cherish in the years ahead. Marvin Rich was there: a quiet, steady presence whose importance to me personally and to Americans for Democratic Action specifically, cannot be overstated. It was a joy to watch him and Evie together through all those years. Evie, Marvin didn’t just love you; he adored you and his eyes shone brightly whenever he talked about you or looked at you. For Marvin, you and your family were the underpinning of everything he did and stood for.”\n\n“Marvin ensured that what was needed happened. His presence and devotion to the causes he held dear were constant and unswerving. He never sought the limelight, but it is no understatement to say that, without Marvin, the civil rights movement couldn’t have happened the way it did and Americans for Democratic Action would not have lasted (all these) years. He didn’t see his role as simply giving direction; he worked hard to make the often impossible happen… a quiet giant who did not seek the limelight but on whose shoulders all the rest of us stood.”\n\nMarvin & Evelyn Rich are exceptionally deserving ADA All Stars… as Amy noted, continually helping “to make the often impossible happen”. Even today, ADA stands on their shoulders.\n\nBack to Top\n\nRich Means and Ray Pempek\n\n* – Not surprising that Rauh would think highly of the minorityplank. He, along with Humphrey and other ADA colleagues, drafted it.\n\n* – The word “United” was obviously jettisoned at some point… I’ll seek out more information and share what I find.\n\nBack to Top\n\nLeon Shull\n\nI did not know Leon Shull. My loss.\n\nFortunately, however, many veteran ADA people did, meaning I could reach out for their insights. Leon Shull served as ADA’s national director for twenty years, from 1964 through 1984. For a liberal organization like ADA, I suspect these two decades were probably the most tumultuous years in the organization’s 75-year history.\n\nThat Shull managed to carry out his duties while expanding ADA’s membership is a tribute to his diverse talents. It’s only fitting that Leon Shull be recognized as an ADA All Star, the first ADA staff member so profiled. Without question, his talents and his tenure make him an exceptional choice. Ah, but don’t take MY word for it (remember, I didn’t actually know him). Read what his ADA contemporaries – people who DID know him – had to say:\n\n— “Leon personifies the very best in the American tradition.” John Lewis, Congressman, civil-rights leader, ADA National President, 1993-1995.\n\n— “Leon is one of the people who helped me understand what the reality was, and how best to take up the issues I cared about.” Patsy Mink, Congresswoman, ADA National President, 1978-1981.\n\n— “Leon provided us with a great wealth, which will endure for decades to come.” Don Edwards, Congressman, ADA National President, 1965-1967. (Congressman Edwards was referring here to a wealth of connections, experiences, traditions, and an enhanced reputation… NOT dollars, which ADA has chronically lacked throughout its 75-year history.)\n\nShull hailed from Philadelphia. He attended Temple University on the north side of the city but left school during the Depression to work for social causes. Before the war, he had a furniture-making business but entered the Army during World War II, joining an engineers’ battalion. (He was turned down for officer’s candidate school by an officer who decided that someone who read books and listened to classical music was NOT officer material.)\n\nShull joined the southeast Pennsylvania ADA chapter in 1950, three years after ADA’s founding. At the time, he was serving as director of the Jewish Labor Committee. When local ADA leaders first asked him to become their executive director, he resisted. Then, according to one of his obituaries, “Someone hit on the idea of getting him fired from the JLC to force him to take over the ADA chapter…it worked.”\n\nShull was executive director of the southeastern Pennsylvania ADA chapter from 1951 to 1964.\n\nHe was a force in the 1950s reform movement in Philadelphia, when Richardson Dilworth and Joseph S. Clark threw out a long-entrenched (and corrupt!) Republican regime. He was campaign manager for Clark when he ran for mayor, and was also involved in Dilworth’s campaigns, first for district attorney, then for mayor once Clark became a US Senator.\n\nAs ADA’s national director, he fought the liberal fight on almost all controversial issues that confronted the nation during those two decades. For example, under Shull’s leadership, ADA was involved in battles over civil rights, minimum wage, progressive tax reform, and full-employment legislation. During his tenure, ADA became the first national organization to oppose the war in Vietnam and the first national organization to call for Richard Nixon’s impeachment. When ADA endorsed Eugene McCarthy over organizational founder Hubert Humphrey in 1968, much of organized Labor, a staunch ADA ally, fled the organization. It took another 20 years and considerable energy for ADA to regain that support, due in large measure, to Shull’s tireless efforts.\n\nPerhaps Shull’s greatest legacy lies in his ability to attract and mentor young people. Those he mentored – no longer so young – now serve in state and local governments, and as congressional staffers and activists throughout the country. He brought Amy Isaacs on board, first a graduate student intern, then as an organizer. When she became national director, Shull returned as an ADA volunteer who attracted other volunteers, including Winn Newman and Woody Ginsburg, adding immensely to the work ADA could accomplish with limited resources.\n\nOne quick Leon Shull story, captured in one of his obituaries: “During the Vietnam War, his daughter Jane was in Washington with college friends to demonstrate against the war. Her father and a friend went looking for them as tear gas began going off around DuPont Circle, Jane recalled. With fumes pouring into the car window, Leon put his foot on the brake. His friend yelled, ‘Leon, get us out of here!’ But Leon was a law-abiding citizen. ‘I can’t,” he said. ‘It’s a red light.’”\n\nLeon Shull was a tireless advocate for liberalism. Upon his retirement from ADA, he said, “All the progress I can think of in the last 50 years has come from the liberal movement. Every single thing… every new proposal that deals with the quality of life, the growth of our system. We used to say liberalism was a demanding faith. (See All Star #16.) It requires us to take positions that are sometimes uncomfortable in a social sense, sometimes lonely, and it sometimes gets you laughed at. But the tide always changes, doesn’t it? The tide never keeps going the same way.”\n\nHe knew the tide would change, even during the Reagan years. While some of his liberal colleagues were melancholy about trends during “the Reagan revolution”, Shull remarked, “Well, we always raise more money during these times.” Consistent with this point, the ADA gained 5,000 members the first year after Reagan was reelected.\n\nLeon Shull died in Philadelphia, August, 2007, at age 93. By all estimates, he is truly an exceptional ADA All Star.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nKurt Meyer, Chair\n\nADA Executive Committee\n\nBack to Top\n\n1947: Fun Facts on our Founding Year\n\nIn a fast-paced world, with the tempo of life seeming to grow quicker every day, sometimes it’s worthwhile to pause and take a brief glance back. Today, in this ADA Moment, we’re going to look back 75 years, to 1947, the year ADA was launched.\n\nSo, what else happened in 1947 that has lived or lasted as long as Americans for Democratic Action? Obviously, this is just a partial list. Nevertheless, it will provide you with some perspective:\n\n— Elmer’s Glue first came to market in 1947. It’s still “sticking” around.\n\n— J. Crew and Talbots, companies marketing their wares primarily to women, were launched in 1947.\n\n— A company called Stanley Steemer started in 1947, the rug cleaning outfit, not the automobile by the same name, which arrived on the scene much earlier.\n\n— The “Doomsday Clock” was created 1947 to symbolize the likelihood of a human-made global catastrophe, a metaphor for threats to humanity from unchecked technology.\n\n— “Goodnight Moon,” a childhood classic, was first published in 1947. We certainly read it to our children at bedtime… presumably many readers of this All Star moment did, too.\n\nA few words about the author of “Goodnight Moon”, Margaret Wise Brown. She was, as a friend of mine would say, “a real piece of work”! I quote from a recent newspaper article about her:\n\n“Brown was a seductive iconoclast with a Katharine Hepburn mane and a compulsion for ignoring the rules. Anointed by Life in 1946 as the “World’s Most Prolific Picture-Book Writer,” she burned through her money as quickly as she earned it, travelling to Europe on ocean liners and spending entire advances on Chrysler convertibles. Her friends called her “mercurial” and “mystical.” Though many of her picture books were populated with cute animals, she wore wolfskin jackets, had a fetish for fur, and hunted rabbits on weekends. Her romances were volatile: she was engaged to two men but never married, and she had a decade-long affair with a woman. (Gasp!) At the age of forty-two, she died suddenly, in the South of France, after a clot cut off the blood supply to her brain.”\n\nEnough about Brown. Let me note, a number of PEOPLE you’re undoubtedly familiar with who were born in 1947. A few notable entertainers, Elton John and Larry David, turn 75 this year, as do a few of the men and women currently serving in the U.S. Senate, all of whom voted for impeachment of the former guy on the second go-‘round… Joe Manchin, Mitt Romney, Mazie Hirono, and Jeanne Shaheen. Senator Hirono received ADA’s Frances Perkins Award in 2019.\n\nSeveral former Senators are also blowing out 75 candles this year – Hillary Clinton, Tom Daschle, and Dan Quayle – as are several remarkable athletes… Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Nolan Ryan, and Johnny Bench. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar attended ADA’s “Civil Rights Plank” Celebration in Philadelphia in 2016 representing the Clinton campaign. (It must be because they were both born in 1947, don’t you think?)\n\nTwo former athletes probably best known for what they did AFTER their athletic careers reach the 75 mark this year, Arnold Schwarzenegger and O.J. Simpson. Authors who can now write about turning 75 include Stephen King, Tom Clancy, and Danielle Steel. Three talented actors who are now three-quarters of the way toward a century are Ted Danson, Richard Dreyfus, and Rob Reiner. Finally, two people known for conducting interviews turn 75 in 2022… David Letterman and Chris Wallace.\n\nApril 15, 1947, was a red-letter day in baseball history. The first baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers was a 28-year-old rookie named Jackie Robinson, playing in his first major league game. The Boston Braves were the opponent. In his last at-bat, with a runner on first, the Dodgers down 3-2, Robinson laid down a sacrifice bunt. The throw to first hit him in the back, which resulted in runners at 2nd and 3rd , both of whom scored when the next batter doubled. The Dodgers ultimately won, 5-3. (Was the errant throw that hit Robinson intentional? You tell me.)\n\nAmericans for Democratic Action is celebrating our 75th year throughout 2022 under the banner of “ADA at 75: The Best is Yet to Come”.\n\nBack to Top\n\nLila Garrett\n\n“Always a pistol.”\n\nIt may well be that these words apply to many, if not most, ADA All Stars. But I came across these words, or something like them, consistently when doing a background dive on Lila Garrett. There seems to be general agreement: Lila Garrett was a pistol.\n\nGarrett died two years ago this month at age 94. She packed a great deal of living into her years. She was a television screenwriter – an Emmy-award winning writer – as well as a radio host. She co-wrote a Disney television movie. AND, perhaps more than any other reason why she’s an ADA All Star, she engaged in politics.\n\nShe may have been a pistol… but this is a somewhat unusual description for an outspoken anti-war activist, described by one as “married to the peace movement and forever committed to progressive values.” She clearly wasn’t at all reluctant to stand up and to speak out for what she thought and believed.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn in 1925, Garrett was well-known as a comedy writer. According to one article I found, when she first arrived in Hollywood, she got her start by writing questions for game shows. She then wrote for sitcoms, including My Favorite Martian, All in the Family, Get Smart, and Bewitched. She never thought of herself as a “woman writer” or a “woman director”. She was simply a writer / director / commentator. Nor was she “still working” at ninety-four; she was just working.\n\nOne of her great skills was as a convener, activating people from far and wide to work for causes that were central to her, especially peace and justice. Her activism and political engagement took many different forms; for many years, she ably presided over the South California chapter of the Americans for Democratic Action. Meanwhile, she was a founder of Americans Against War with Iraq, a founding board member of the California Clean Money Campaign, as well as a founding member of Progressive Democrats of America.\n\nAmericans Against War With Iraq was the first group to run a national newspaper ad protesting the possible war, which it did in September 2002, spending almost $100,000 on three full-page ads in major papers. (The war didn’t begin until late March, 2003.) Garrett was quoted at the time the ads ran, “We felt we were representing the opinion of the majority of Americans and that that opinion was not being represented in the mainstream media.”\n\nGarrett also served on the boards of the ACLU, the Venice Family Clinic, and the Writers Guild of America. She was a Democratic National Committee delegate for presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988 and Southern California Chair of the 2004 Dennis Kucinich campaign for President.\n\nIn her later years, she hosted KPFK’s “Connect the Dots” on Pacifica Radio in Los Angeles, interviewing left-leaning luminaries and often closing her show with “The arms industry has neither allies or enemies, only customers.” For many years, Garrett was a regular contributor to the LA Progressive, an online publication that, according to its own description, served as a platform for “progressive thought, opinion, and perspectives… openly and unapologetically advocacy journalism”.\n\nIn poking around in her life story, I encountered the point – but was unable to verify – that the movie “The Way We Were”, starring Barbara Streisand, was written about her. Let’s just say, it might have been; knowing this, even if it’s not factually correct (and obviously it may not be), helps me understand Lila Garrett a bit better.\n\nLila Garrett was always a pistol. Shortly before her death, a friend of hers was updating her Wikipedia page. “Make sure you insert how I end my radio show,” Garrett insisted. I looked it up… and there it is: “The arms industry has neither allies nor enemies, only customers.”\n\nBack to Top\n\nTim Black\n\nYou have to say, Timuel Black led a very interesting life.\n\nOne might easily conclude that the truth in this statement is due to the fact that he lived a remarkably long life… 102 years. Actually, the truth about Tim Black is that he packed a great deal of learning and teaching and leading and mentoring and explaining and interpreting and writing… and yes, LIVING, into his century-plus-two years on this earth.\n\nClearly, he left his beloved Chicago better than he found it, a conclusion that might be applied equally to almost every cause, every program, even every individual that became the object of his considerable talents. ADA was but one organization that knew Tim Black… and that Tim Black knew. There were many others. Records are a bit sketchy about when he first joined ADA, probably in the early-to-mid 1960s. And he recorded a message of support and encouragement for the ADA annual awards event, virtual again in 2021, a month before his death last October.\n\nIn round numbers, that’s almost six decades of ADA involvement. That record alone places Black in a rather exclusive club. But it’s all the things he accomplished both before he joined ADA and during those six decades that puts him in a category by himself. Let me share just a few of those achievements.\n\nTimuel Black arrived in Chicago from Birmingham, Alabama before his first birthday. His family was part of the first wave of the Great Migration during which millions of African Americans moved north in search of better opportunities. Many articles about Black include a sentence or two about being drafted to fight in World War II, for which Black earned four bronze battle stars as well as the French Croix de Guerre. While he didn’t “storm the beaches” at Normandy, he was part of the renown “Red Ball Express” that furnished supplies to those who did, including General Patton and the men under his command.\n\nDuring his military service, a visit to the Buchenwald concentration camp changed Black’s life. Here’s his description from a 2014 interview: “When we got up to Buchenwald, to see and feel and hear the cries, I was shocked. I began to feel that this could happen to anyone, and that in the long run, this is what happened to my ancestors in an organized, systematic way. (note: his grandparents had been slaves) I was angry. I made an emotional decision that when I returned from the Army, that most of the rest of my life would be spent trying to make where I live, and the bigger world, a place where all people could have peace and justice.”\n\nThe world is a better place due to that sense of commitment. We can trace the arc of Timuel Black’s life through several of the many tributes that poured forth last October.\n\n— “Black had a hand in electing the city’s first Black mayor and the first Black U.S. president. He fought Nazis in World War II…returning to racial discrimination radicalized him and led to a life of civil rights and public service. In 1960, Black helped found the Negro American Labor Council and worked with A. Phillip Randolph on labor issues. The historian and author strategized with Martin Luther King Jr., challenged the Democratic Party machine and fought to desegregate housing and public schools.”\n\n— “In 1963, Black helped organize the “freedom trains” that took thousands of Chicagoans to the March on Washington. ‘When Dr. King came on stage and put into eloquent terms, that ‘I Have a Dream’ speech, all of us were in tears. We believed that dream could be fulfilled, and we left with a feeling of responsibility to the dream and to the man.’ Black said in 2014. Black spent most of his life working to fulfill King’s dream of a more equal society. As an educator and administrator, Black helped end segregation in Chicago Public Schools.”\n\n— “Black rooted his scholarship in community, inspiring manifold generations on how to be an artist and an activist. Sitting in circles with elementary school children, Black implored African-American children to have pride and not be ashamed of descending from enslaved people. He often said he descended from the best and the brightest. His legions of honorary grandchildren will continue to honor him through our own scholarship, thinking and writing.”\n\n— “He ran (unsuccessfully) for Chicago City Council, generating national attention when he coined the term ‘plantation politics’ to describe the city’s political system under Mayor Richard J. Daley. After Dr. King’s death in 1968, Black rededicated himself to King’s activist ideals, remaining a prominent community leader. In 1983, he was part of a grassroots campaign that succeeded in electing Harold Washington as Chicago’s first Black mayor. In 1992, he helped Carol Moseley Braun become the first African American woman to win election to the U.S. Senate. That same year, Barack Obama—then an up-and-coming political organizer who had just moved to Chicago—met Black to get his advice about running for office.”\n\n— “Timuel Black dedicated his life to helping communities across Chicago, especially on the South Side. His unparalleled understanding of the area’s history and people made him an outstanding advocate, a trusted counselor and a consummate community partner. He was deeply committed to educating and inspiring young people. Tim was one of the most passionate community leaders of the effort to bring the Obama Presidential Center to the South Side, and his vision was central to that proposal’s success.”\n\n— “Black was a counsel to then-Sen. Obama when he ran for president in 2008. They’d become friends when Obama was a young community organizer in the early 1980s. In a tribute to Mr. Black on his 100th birthday, Obama wrote: ‘I met Tim just after I moved to Chicago. We sat across from each other at Medici on 57th — the rookie South Side organizer on one side … and the veteran South Side historian on the other. During that first conversation I learned of Tim’s deep well of empathy. I was inspired by that. He wanted to talk about how to make life better for people all across the city, how to bring about greater equality. Perhaps the most important part, after talking about it, he gets out there and does something about it, rolls up his sleeves and gets to work.’ In a statement after Black’s death, Obama wrote, ‘Tim was a testament to the power of place, and how the work we do to improve one community can end up reverberating through other neighborhoods and other cities, eventually changing the world.’”\n\nLet me reiterate, Timuel Black led a very interesting life. It’s an honor to cite him as an exemplary ADA All Star.\n\nBack to Top\n\nJim Jontz\n\nMarquis Childs\n\n“My father was a lawyer and his father was a farmer, as his forebears apparently had been since the time of Adam. Why I wanted, from the age of thirteen or fourteen, to be a newspaperman I’ve never quite understood.” – Marquis Childs\n\nToday’s ADA All Star, Marquis Childs, was born in 1903 in Clinton, Iowa, a city on the Mississippi River on Iowa’s eastern side. He was a journalist and author throughout his long and distinguished career. He also taught briefly at the University of Iowa before returning to his primary profession. When he died in 1990, he was usually described as a foreign correspondent, a columnist, and an author, having written some sixteen books.\n\nHis vocational choice may have affirmed by witnessing the power of the printed word at age seventeen. At the Clinton County Fair, a barnstorming pilot was selling rides for $5 each. Childs was in attendance with his father, who was campaigning for county attorney. Young Childs, armed with literature advocating his father’s candidacy, bought a ride in the open cockpit and dropped campaign leaflets on fairgoers, much to crowd’s amusement. (Yes, his father won the election.)\n\nChilds attended the University of Wisconsin, from which he earned two degrees, and the University of Iowa, from which he earned two additional degrees. Childs, who pronounced his first name “MARK-us,” is among the half-dozen journalists / authors generally listed among the two dozen or so “prominent founding members” of ADA. Occasionally, he referred to career as being an “interpretive reporter,” assuming responsibility for trying to explain the news. Throughout his career, Childs alternated between working for United Press and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n\nChilds was a busy man during the 1950s and ‘60s. For example, in the early 1950s, Childs served as moderator for “Washington Spotlight,” a weekly roundtable discussion of politics syndicated to television stations nationwide. His column, “Washington Calling,” ran six times a week, distributed by the United Feature Syndicate. His longer stories and essays were published in magazines. In addition, Childs often appeared as a panelist on “Meet the Press,” and lectured throughout the country.\n\nIn 1969, Childs received the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for distinguished commentary, the first such award granted. Apparently, President Nixon didn’t appreciate his work since Marquis Childs’ name appeared on the President’s “Enemies List”. Childs championed civil rights and frequently wrote about the plight of the poor. He gained the confidence of national leaders, which resulted in private interviews with Presidents from FDR to JFK. Later in his career, American-Soviet diplomatic relations became a recurring theme; his columns often cited potential horrors of the nuclear arms race.\n\nAt the time of the 1948 Democratic convention, when an upstart ADA and many convention delegates hoped to nominate Dwight Eisenhower for president, Childs interviewed Eisenhower. The former general told Childs he was not a “liberal” and had little in common with the Democratic Party. Needless to say, this put quite a damper on the “draft Ike” movement.\n\nMarquis Childs was generally as an informed, rational, and entertaining columnist, who wrote about topics of national interest and the world’s major personalities. He maintained an enviable reputation for his intelligence and integrity. His involvement with ADA and his advice to ADA leaders during the organization’s early years were important and highly beneficial. Marquis Childs, journalist and author, is an ADA All Star.\n\nMillie Jeffrey\n\nMillie McWilliams Jeffrey was barely five feet tall. But those who knew her were often quick to note, don’t let THAT fool you. She was a diminutive dynamo!\n\nSome of this may have been genetic. Millie’s Jeffrey’s grandmother was widowed with sixteen children; she ran the family’s farm after her husband died. One of her grandmother’s daughters, Millie’s mother, became Iowa’s first female registered pharmacist in 1908, while raising seven children on her own.\n\nMillie Jeffrey was born in Alton, Iowa in 1910. The family eventually moved from northwest Iowa to Minneapolis, primarily so Millie and her sisters could attend college. Millie Jeffrey attended the University of Minnesota, her time there overlapping with another student (and future ADA leader) by the name of Humphrey. At the University, Jeffrey became involved in progressive movements. For example, she joined a campus chapter of the YWCA that had taken a public stand in support of racial integration. With a Black classmate, she helped desegregate restaurants near the campus that had been turning away non-white diners. She later become a lifetime member of the NAACP.\n\nIn earning a master’s degree in Social Economy and Social Research from Bryn Mawr College, Jeffrey realized that to improve working people’s lives, she needed to help change “the system”. In the 1930s, one avenue to accomplish this change was through the labor movement. Accordingly, she became an organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America in Philadelphia, then Educational Director of the Pennsylvania Joint Board of Shirt Workers. In 1936, she married Homer Newman Jeffrey, also a union organizer. During the second World War, the Jeffreys were consultants to the War Labor Board in Washington, D.C., where they became friends with Walter, Victor, and Roy Reuther.\n\nShortly before the War was over, Victor Reuther offered Millie Jeffrey an opportunity to lead a newly formed UAW Women’s Bureau, which meant a move to Detroit. There, she organized the UAW’s first conference in response to the massive postwar layoffs of women production workers being replaced by returning veterans. For five years, Millie oversaw the union’s radio station before directing the union’s Community Relations Department. Her last position was Director of the Consumer Affairs Department, which she held from 1968 until her retirement in 1976.\n\nThere’s no question, Mildred McWilliams Jeffrey was a remarkably effective social justice activist. She spent seven decades working to advance women’s rights and civil rights, as well as education, health care, youth employment, and recreation issues. She brought inspiration and good humor to all she undertook while modeling an unflagging optimism and her undaunted spirit. She mentored countless women and men in the labor, civil rights, women’s rights, and peace movements. Her zeal for organizing may be the quality most people remember her for.\n\nAs President Bill Clinton noted in 2000, in awarding Jeffrey the Presidential Medal of Freedom: “Her impact will be felt for generations, her example never forgotten.” This award was bestowed on Jeffrey at the same ceremony that John Kenneth Galbraith received this honor. Like Humphrey and Walter Reuther, Galbraith was an ADA founder.\n\nFor five decades, Jeffrey was blazing trails for women… with the United Auto Workers in the 1940s where she was the first woman to head a UAW department, marching with Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr, and James Meredith in the ‘50s and ‘60s, and becoming an exceptional advisor to women seeking political office in the 70s and 80s. Throughout these years, Mildred Jeffrey was active in the Democratic Party, generally preferring to work behind the scenes… organizing, canvassing, consulting, and fundraising. Jeffrey managed Robert Kennedy’s 1968 presidential campaign in Michigan. She ran for public office herself only once, in 1974, when she was elected to the Wayne State University Board of Governors, an office she held for 16 years (1974-1990), including three terms as Board Chair.\n\nAs a founding member and chair of the National Women’s Political Caucus, she was an early and avid supporter of female candidates for public office. In 1984, she led efforts to nominate a woman, Geraldine Ferraro, to serve as Walter Mondale’s running mate. Years later, she reveled in the fact that she was then represented by three women: Governor Jennifer Granholm, Senator Debbie Stabenow, and Congresswoman Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick. Former Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder (D-CO), herself a University of Minnesota graduate, noted: “Millie is the ‘political godmother’ for many of us.”\n\nJeffrey was active in organizing ADA from the start, in 1947. She was also a leader in numerous other national organizations, including the Coalition for Labor Union Women (CLUW), the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL), EMILY’s List, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).\n\nFor a lifetime of activism, in many different forms while advancing many different organizations, Millie McWilliams Jeffrey is an exemplary ADA All Star.\n\n* * *\n\nSince its founding, ADA has always held an annual gathering to honor iconic figures, in some cases, deserving organizations, who have achieved greatly… who have performed exceptionally… who have responded extraordinarily when times required it. What I am about to do is different. It’s an award, to be sure. But it’s MUCH more rare.\n\nBefore bestowing ADA’s “Timeless Liberal” Award, I asked Don (Kusler) how many of these awards have been given out during HIS involvement with ADA… some 18 years (now, 22 years). He thought three, indicating this award is unusual and exceptional, which is appropriate. This evening, we’re honoring an unusual, exceptional individual.\n\nThe word “timeless” attached to any award suggests a certain longevity that triggers this designation. And that’s true in this case. Our timeless liberal has been at it a while. Twice he’s served ADA as Chair of the National Executive Board… in the late ’80s and early ‘90s and again, beginning four years ago (in 2014) until last summer (2018). In both cases, he served with considerable talent and dignity, skill, and grace.\n\nTonight, we award ADA’s Timeless Liberal Award to our colleague Jim Bishop. Since the 1960s, when first fighting for fair housing in the greater Boston community, Jim Bishop has been advocating passionately, articulately, and effectively for what’s fair and right… for a liberal, enlightened approach to government and public affairs.\n\nProfessionally, Jim Bishop has been affiliated with some of the finest educational institutions in our country: MIT, Amherst, the University of Pennsylvania, and (Thee) Ohio State University. I know Jim’s name is Bishop, but this progression is like going from Bishop, to Archbishop, to Cardinal, then, at OSU, Pope! (Oh, I’m sorry, Jim, I was thinking of Woody Hayes there for a moment.)\n\nIn a peculiar twist of fate, 27 years ago this week, (in 1991, which now is 31 years ago) Dr. Bishop provided testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, voicing ADA’s opposition to the nomination of Clarence Thomas to be a Justice on the Supreme Court. I quote the official record.\n\n“I am James Bishop. I am here on behalf of Americans for Democratic Action where I am privileged to serve as Chair of the National Executive Committee. During our history, we have been active participants in numerous battles where the individual rights and liberties of Americans were at stake. We have carefully reviewed past judicial nominations, opposing some, supporting others. Always, the guiding principle in our deliberations has been that our nation’s judicial system is the last bulwark of individual freedom: it must protect the rights of those least able to protect themselves against the swings of political or ideological extremism. We have applied this principle in our considerations of this historic nomination … and in our executive committee’s unanimous decision to oppose Judge Thomas’ elevation to the Supreme Court.”\n\nI’d like to discuss three of Jim’s sterling traits: Jim Bishop is generous. Not only with his dollars but also with his time and his energy and his wisdom. When you seek Jim’s support or advice or engagement, invariably, it’s forthcoming. ADA has been the great beneficiary of this generous spirit. It’s a wonderful quality. Thank you, Jim.\n\nJim Bishop is wise. He’s at the table and has been at the table, ready to go, for quite some time. He’s listening. He’s tracking… he’s paying attention. His timelessness has given him perspective. When your career is in academia, knowledge is at or near the center of the profession. When you blend accumulated knowledge with experience, and then temper it with perspective, you get enduring wisdom. It’s a wonderful quality. Thank you, Jim.\n\nFinally, Jim Bishop is tenacious. When he locks in on an organization, as he has in the case of ADA, he’s there, whatever it takes. When he locks in on an issue, as he often does, similarly, he’s there. How many times, dear colleagues, have we heard from Jim, when on a late-night conference call (or now, a zoom meeting), and someone asks, “Now, is there anything else we need to discuss before we adjourn?” After a one- or two-second pause, we hear Jim. “Yes, several meetings ago, we talked about (blank) without ever resolving this issue. What’s going to be our position on thus-and-such?” Or, “What are we going to do\n\nabout this?” Or, “I assume we’ll take time to fully resolve this matter at our next meeting…”\n\nWhen Jim locks in, envision a terrier clamped onto the leg of a mail carrier, holding on for dear life. Oh, he’ll loosen his grip, eventually… but not until we agree to resolve, to discuss, or to place on our next agenda. Like generosity and wisdom, tenacity is also a wonderful quality. Thank you, Jim.\n\nNow, while I’ll not dwell on them, I’d be remiss if I didn’t note a few other qualities that have been helpful to me in my attempts to do more for ADA: Jim’s unfailing graciousness, his robust sense of humor, and his great patience, because some of us are slower than we should be to catch on or to catch up. For many of us, Jim is a dear friend, a role model, a mentor, and a hero. He’s also among the classiest people we’ll ever meet. This evening, we honor Jim for a lifetime characterized by remarkable commitment and achievement. We bestow ADA’s “Timeless Liberal” Award to our colleague, James J. Bishop.\n\n* * *\n\nGiven that this record of steadfast service has now been extended by almost four years, there is absolutely no doubt: Jim Bishop is a distinguished ADA All Star."
