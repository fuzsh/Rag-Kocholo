        "text": "Adherence to 2-monthly schedule May be too frequent, and some clients may not return for timely follow-up as is the case with oral PrEP – concerns about risks of resistance higher with CAB-LA than with oral PrEP (monotherapy and longer tail).USA, Dom Rep, UK, MexicoIn the real-world setting, the challenge is: will it go wrong more often than in the study sites? Will there be people not quite navigating the process to come and get the repeat injections? There may be a need for a “rescue package” with standard PrEP – a back-up supply for bridging if you missed or were late to an appointment (as is done with Depo).UKChallenging for people who travel a lot and may not be able to get to the clinic for repeat injections.Thailand Medicalization of PrEP For services delivered largely through telehealth, there are questions about how this would work including who will be allowed (or willing) to administer injections. Will clients speak with telehealth providers and then have to go into the clinic for injection? How will nurses feel about giving these injections? May make service delivery more complicated for some clients and health servicesUSA, Poland, LebanonIn some settings, family docs can prescribe if client is traveling or can’t attend PrEP clinic for some other reason. CAB-LA will be more inconvenient as they’ll have to find a physician who is willing to give the injection (not common in Poland – family doctors not eager to do injections even for simple things like penicillin) – could be a major barrier for people who don’t have good access to doctors.Poland (and most other E. European countries) HIV testing algorithm Need to make sure that no one starting CAB-LA has an acute HIV infection; FDA advice is that everyone have a VL test on every visit – concerns about mutation, and the tail issue. And the research is enrolling very young people (15–17 yrs), and there are significant ethical issues, so there is a lot of discussion about the HIV testing algorithm; VL testing on every visit will not be possible or sustainable in many settings.BrazilIf a country doesn’t have the possibility of doing VL on every visit, should they consider implementing CAB-LA? Adolescents Sexually active adolescents in key populations need particular attention; they often have low levels of knowledge about PrEP, but they are curious and open to understanding their sexuality, and many of them are eligible for PrEP; providers need to be sensitive to their needs.Thailand Efficacy Low rate of seroconversion, but higher than oral PrEP.MexicoLack of evidence of efficacy in people who use drugs.Mexico Anticipation vs reality It sounds attractive but requires rigorous adherence to a more frequent clinic schedule than oral PrEP, and the IM injections are not pleasant.UK Side effects Uncertainty about side effects (injection site pain, nausea, other). Most providers understand these are likely temporary and not significant in terms of risk to the PrEP user’s health, but the fear of side effects (pre-initiation) or discouragement due to experience with side effects (post-initiation), as seen with daily PrEP, may potentially deter uptake of CAB-LA; will require additional counselling time with clients.Across regions Long-term effects Not yet known, and this concerns providers and clients.VN Drug interactions Concerns for PWUD, transgender people using hormonal therapy and chemsex users (this is true for daily PrEP as well as CAB-LA).Australia, VN Initiation of new clients CAB-LA should only be offered to established PrEP users who have demonstrated commitment to daily adherence and to continuation visit schedule.USA Stigma In general, stigma is an issue with daily or ED-PrEP and possibly will still be an issue with CAB-LA, except that it’s a more discreet option.VN Confusion with contraceptive products With same delivery mechanism, will be critical to emphasize (especially with low-education clients) that CAB-LA (and the ring) are for HIV prevention only.Sri Lanka, Namibia, Zimbabwe Medical waste Clinics will need to be able to manage additional volume of medical waste.VN Opposition by HIV service providers Considered a waste of resources (ARVs) in settings where ART coverage is not 100%.Myanmar Resistance Long tail issue is a concern raised by many providers.Poland, UK, Australia, others Costs Concern that HIV and other testing costs may increase, as well as the cost of the injection itself, however not enough known at this point.Across regionsPrEP clients are very enthusiastic about using services, but huge bills for tests and other services will discourage uptake.USAWith growing economic challenges in many settings, CAB-LA may be out of reach for many people.Thailand, Lebanon, IndonesiaIn settings where sex is considered a ‘taboo’ topic, some people would rather use free condoms to protect themselves than pay money and risk exposing their sexual practices.ThailandThere will be demand for CAB-LA, but who will pay for this??HIC settingsUnclear if this will be covered by insurance or if there will be adequate donor/project funding to make it a real option for clients (especially if there is no generic available); in settings where PrEP is only delivered through the private sector, cost may be a significant barrier. Health systems or project funding currently pay for generic PrEP drugs in public facilities; there is some concern that CAB-LA will be prohibitive except for clients of private health services who can afford it. This was mentioned in most countries except those that are typically receiving project funding.Spain, Indonesia, Lebanon, Mexico, Guatemala, Poland, SwitzerlandPrEP in general (and including CAB-LA) could suffer from ‘flavour of the month effect’, where funding flows for new priorities and then fades after a couple years.Lebanon, UkraineHigh cost of CAB-LA may exacerbate current problem of stockouts in some settings.Zambia, Namibia, UgandaCost of lab tests for initiation too high for most clients; in some countries not available.Across regionsAnticipated high cost of CAB-LA – better to target this option to clients who really struggle with adherence or whose lives are unstable.MyanmarTransport to clinics for injections, lost wages due to time away from work.Myanmar, Dom Rep, ThailandWhen PrEP is not covered, people cobble it together, getting meds from friends, paying for labs, doing on-demand regimen poorly, etc., as PrEP is so expensive; risk of inadequate adherence / resistance.AustraliaEven if approved for use in Europe, may not be available in settings where PrEP is free of charge, depends on negotiating acceptable price that fits national procurement framework – the QALY for injectable PrEP would have to be compared to the generic daily PrEP – (what’s the added value of this product as opposed to the daily treatment?).UK Disclosure of personal data In some settings, clients for HIV services, including PrEP, must disclose their name, address, SSN, etc. – a huge barrier especially for populations such as PWID/PWUD; this will remain a barrier for CAB-LA.USAToo many hoops for consumers to jump through; a person may want PrEP but is unwilling to provide the data required.USA No national PrEP programme or guidance In countries where there is no national PrEP programme, NAT resources are generally dedicated to HIV/STI testing and treatment services and PrEP guidance from other countries (and WHO, CDC) is used.Nepal, Indonesia, Ukraine, Guatemala, Myanmar, PolandARVs only approved for use in ART; PrEP drugs have to be accessed by clients through external partners/companies.Indonesia Restrictive national health policies Services can only be delivered to residents of the local area – PrEP is not available throughout the country; this restricts PrEP access and will affect access to CAB-LA and other new products.Mexico National approval process Once WHO recommendation is issued, it could take up to 2 years for the national FDA to approve use of CAB-LA in public health facilities.Thailand HIV (and other) testing Concern about detecting recent infection in general – may be necessary to only use NAT for initiation, or start on daily oral PrEP for a month and then shift to CAB-LA once HIV-negative status confirmed.SpainQuestions about whether all the testing currently required will be necessary for CAB-LA – particularly regarding renal function and hepatitis. Some clients are also chemsex users, and we don’t know enough yet about those drug interactions.Switzerland, AustraliaDetecting recent infections in settings with limited access to NAT/VL – e.g. in Nepal only have access to 3rd gen RDT at PrEP sites and need to send samples to labs in cities where VL machines are available, but NAT/VL requires govt approval; however there is resistance by govt labs to use expensive NAT for HIV-negative clients as it’s considered a waste of reagents (they are still struggling to get VL testing for ART clients) – another reason WHO guidance on this is needed with explicit recommendations for HIV testing for initiation on CAB-LA.NepalRenal function testing, HCV testing, STI screenings and treatment, etc. are all important, but they are barriers and should not be a condition for getting access to PrEP; as for oral PrEP the STI testing requirements could push people away, especially because of cost.USAWhere VL testing available, challenges with shortages of reagents, machine breakdowns, closures due to C19 and transportation problems where samples come from a distance.NepalCost too high for most clients.Ukraine, Indonesia, USAAlmost all providers felt confident that the test they were using (mostly 4th gen RDT) was adequate for initiation on CAB-LA, except those who only have 3rd gen RDT; HIV ST generally not considered for anything beyond screening (although in a few cases might be considered for daily PrEP continuation with clients who have been adherent for several refill cycles).Across regionsWith increased uptake, lab infrastructure will be insufficient to meet demand; in some settings still struggling to get VL testing for ART clients, and will need better access to NAT/VL for initiation on CAB-LA.LMIC settingsCurrently dealing with shortages of reagents, machine breakdowns, C19 closures of labs, transportation issues.Nepal Link between PrEP and HIV services / stigma In settings where PrEP is delivered through HIV or ART services, clients are often reluctant to seek services, don’t want to be associated with HIV (even though their risk profile makes them eligible for PrEP) – mostly LMIC settings where resources and space for service delivery may be limited.Guatemala, Zambia, Myanmar Commodity management issues / stockouts Stockouts (PrEP drugs, ST kits, other supplies) cause significant problems with delivery of daily PrEP, particularly in Africa region; when refills are not available, clients are reluctant to go through initiation again, and they risk developing resistance; CAB-LA users may face the same issue, especially given the expected initial high cost and weak supply chains in these settings.LMIC settingsCurrently national shortage of ARVs, could face the same issue with injectable.Dominican RepublicSome confusion among providers about storage and cold-chain/refrigeration requirements.3 Lack of access to health coverage The biggest risk factor for HIV acquisition (in provider’s setting) is foreign-born MSM who have been in country for < 5yrs and mostly from Asia – as well as international students and tourists, vast majority of them do not fall under the national health scheme (Medicare) – testing and access to PrEP can be difficult and expensive, and in some cases students with insurance don’t want to be ‘outed’ and so they won’t use their insurance to cover HIV prevention… so there are ‘nurse-led consults’ (outside the Medicare bubble) through the PrEPMe clinic at Alfred Hospital, which provides services for free (apart from the meds) for overseas-born Medicare-ineligible individuals seeking PrEP. (Before June 2020 they were part of a study called PrEPX which only enrolled Medicare-eligible individuals, but have transitioned to the current population because the demand was so high.)Australia Retention in care Over time, even CAB-LA 2-monthly visits will become burdensome; what is needed are very long-acting options, including a vaccine (an HIV vaccine study is being conducted at participant’s site).Poland2-month IM injections/clinic visits could be tricky for people.UK Stopping CAB-LA Not clear yet what the requirements will be to stop safely (12 months of daily PrEP? Or consistent use of effective prevention methods?) – may be a deterrent for people who opted for CAB precisely because of adherence issues/preferences or difficulties adopting effective prevention practices – would they do it for stopping CAB?Poland, USA, UK Financing Lack of public sector financing for PrEP in state facilities. Funding is available for compassionate services (free) for HIV-positive clients, but not for PrEP in the physician-led state services (outside of the main SRH clinic in Melbourne) – even though it’s cheaper to prevent HIV than to treat it… this is going to be a significant threat to PrEP services as they expand and new options become available.Australia Aversion to injections In some settings, aversion to injections is a possible barrier/constraint; need to keep the option of daily oral PrEP available for those clients.USA, Spain, VN, UkraineExperience in the clinical trials has shown that the injection site pain is mild and temporary, but for new users a fear of this pain could be a deterrent.ThailandIn some settings, people generally prefer to get injections only from physicians and nurses.Myanmar, Lebanon Human resources CAB-LA expected to increase demand and uptake – additional pressure on physicians who continue to respond to C19-related clinical responsibilities.Across regionsWhile global recs are moving toward c-b delivery of services, there is significant reluctance/refusal to receive clinical services from non-physicians. CAB-LA would create an immediate increase in demand and uptake, but there are not enough physicians to administer injections. This is complicated by criminalization of homosexuality in some countries where physicians in publicly-funded facilities may be restricted in the way they engage with the most important population (in EM region) for PrEP (MSM/TG women); may be difficult to promote sexual health for MSM.EM regionNGOs have more freedom to provide PrEP services, but will not be able to provide injectable PrEP due to cultural acceptability, unless there are physicians on staff.LebanonStaffing shortages (number and type of provider who can administer IM injections) may restrict task-shifting to respond to increased uptake; HTS and ART still priority services, although some integration of PrEP is happening.Africa regionIn a scaled PrEP service, high volume clinics (1000 PrEP clients, 2000 ART clients) are already just coping with the brief 3-monthly visit with blood tests for oral PrEP and the 6-monthly clinical review (co-morbidities, use of non-steroidal drugs, kidney problems, etc.) because they are seeing a bit more medical complexity than was anticipated. It will be almost impossible to deliver CAB-LA on a 2-monthly schedule (with testing requirements) as they do not have enough staff with the current model of care (for HIV treatment this involves a brief 6-monthly visit and a 12-month review, with home delivery of meds). There is also some question about clients showing up at clinic on an absolute schedule for a clinical injection.UKIn some settings, still struggling with recovery from COVID and there are staffing issues that could affect delivery of CAB-LA with the potential increase in uptake.UK, AustraliaLimited number of people can give injections and if people are late for appointments can be difficult to serve them; if they have to wait a week for next appointment there’s the risk of resistance.UK Time requirement Delivering PrEP services effectively can be time-intensive; it is difficult, especially in high-volume settings, to require staff in public facilities to dedicate the time to the testing, counselling, discussions and administration of injections that are critical to initiation, continuation and using PrEP safely and effectively.Thailand, UK Anti-vax/anti-meds In some settings, C19-related opposition to vaccination or pockets of general anti-vax/anti-meds sentiment in subgroups of MSM population affects uptake of daily oral PrEP (often driven by social media), and is expected to affect uptake of CAB-LA or other new products. May be especially problematic in HIC settings where this issue has become politicized in recent years and there is spillover into the PrEP space) – will need more innovative IEC and good relationships with clients to overcome this challenge.Lebanon, Australia, VN Homophobia In settings where clients are worried about revealing their sexuality or practices to family/friends, there is some reluctance to use PrEP.Australia Lack of a focus on women PrEP has been focused mainly on MSM and TG women; in some settings new HIV cases are higher than among MSM; in sub-Saharan Africa, new cases are higher among AGYW. Cisgender women also need to be part of marketing and information campaigns as PrEP in general, including CAB-LA, will empower women to gain some control in their relationships.Thailand Lack of knowledge/misinformation Lack of knowledge among clients as well as providers – more IEC needed.Africa regionWhere services are targeted more narrowly to specific KP communities mainly MSM, TG women and PWUD, lack of knowledge or reluctance to provide PrEP is more common among providers – more advocacy is needed, along with stronger guidance from WHO and more investment from donors.Poland, Ukraine, GuatemalaIn some LMIC settings, providers mentioned the need for refrigeration as a significant barrier for service delivery in facilities as well as non-traditional settings – this may be a confusion with CAB RPV-LA for treatment.Some LMIC settingsAwareness in general population is low and that can affect KP as well; confusion with PEP.Myanmar Lack of patient-centred services Private sector trying to fill this gap, but then cost becomes a barrier; need more engagement with research institutions and opportunities to participate in research on CAB-LA implementation.Ukraine External factors Civil unrest, C19 lockdowns – in Myanmar, PrEP is only delivered in Yangon, so when PrEP clients move around the country (returning home for security reasons or due to loss of jobs) and can’t get back to Yangon for refills (political unrest, C19 restrictions), adherence is impossible; this will be the same for CAB-LA injections and monitoring, which will only be available in Yangon as there has been no discussion between the national programme and commercial sector for subsidization and supply of ARVs.MyanmarIn Lebanon, overlapping crises – economic, political, unemployment, refugees + C19 – PrEP users’ lives are increasingly more unstable and adherence becomes very challenging.Lebanon Hesitancy about new products In some settings, clients may be reluctant to accept new products, but from the provider’s perspective, this will be really helpful and more user-friendly.Zimbabwe Staffing/logistics In a high-volume clinic with 2000 ART clients, only a very small percentage will be able to get the injectable treatment; similar constraints are likely to affect delivery of CAB-LA.UK Decentralization of the health sector Reforms/decentralization have resulted in decreasing focus on HIV services, and confusion among clients about how to access services, which is affecting PrEP delivery and will affect availability and delivery of CAB-LA if/when it becomes available.Ukraine"
