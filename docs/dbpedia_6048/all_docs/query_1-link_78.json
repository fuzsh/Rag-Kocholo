        "text": "Alumni\n\nThe Master of Science in Information Systems program is one of the most respected and sought-after degree programs in the nation. After 10 years and hundreds of graduates, our track record of launching and supporting careers in every major tech company in the country is undisputed. Our graduates continue to apply the tools and experience gained from the program to jobs in a variety of fields. Learn more about how some of our alumni have used their degree to achieve their career goals.\n\nEarly Career\n\nKimberley CampbellMSIS Class of 2018\n\nBusiness Analyst II, Amazon Alexa\n\n”MSIS helped me land the big interviews and prep me for my next career goals to land a job with a tech company. I had the opportunity to test out my interview skills in mock interviews, learn skills for the technical interviews, and then head to the real ones fully prepared.”\n\nMonique SmithMSIS Class of 2018\n\nProgram Manager II, Microsoft\n\n“MSIS opened the doors to connect me with mentors in my field, introduce me to career opportunities, and teach me about all the ways that technology and business impact each other. MSIS also helped introduce me to an executive at Microsoft who was looking to hire someone with a background like mine. After graduation I started as a Program Manager at Microsoft. As I think about how engineering efforts I propose will impact the business, I constantly reflect on the range of topics we covered in MSIS.”\n\nPriyaranjan PattnayakMSIS Class of 2018\n\nPrincipal Data Scientist, Oracle Cloud\n\n“MSIS gave me a great platform to showcase my skills and interests and at the same time gave me the exposure necessary to explore growing trends in the tech industry. The degree boosted my career, gave me the required credibility in the field of data analytics and I ended up in the exact role and level where I wanted to be. It would not have been possible without MSIS, my team, and the professors.”\n\nBunmi SofoworaMSIS Class of 2019\n\nSr. ANLS Data Scientist, Avanade\n\n“The MSIS program has greatly influenced my career trajectory, because of all the connections I have made both with my fellow alumni and the professors. The courses have prepared me very well for a data science role. The professors have firsthand knowledge coming from similar roles, and they try to replicate projects and examples for our understanding. Transitioning from a student into a data science role was seamless because the algorithms and the tools that my team was using were very similar to what was taught in class.”\n\nAfiya NusratMSIS Class of 2019\n\nProduct Manager, Axon\n\n“I joined the MSIS program with the intention of pivoting my career from software engineering to product management. The wide variety of courses spanning across business and technology helped provide the perfect boost to my profile. We were also given plenty of opportunities to interact with business leaders through workshops and site visits which were extremely useful in bridging the gap between academia and industry.”\n\nShruti ChandrasekharMSIS Class of 2019\n\nBusiness Intelligence Engineer, Amazon\n\n“Developing your network is as important as developing your technical skills. Never be shy to take advantage of the plethora of networking opportunities provided by the program. The value that the [Women in Tech Leadership Series] events bring is beyond what you can learn inside the classroom. I had the opportunity to represent MSIS at the Hopperx1 Seattle conference and Women in Tech Regatta. The exposure that I had through these conferences was immense. This unique platform gave me an opportunity to interact with some of the amazing women leaders in tech.”\n\nMid Career\n\nPatrick GutiérrezMSIS Class of 2019\n\nSupport Engineer Manager, Amazon Web Services\n\n“MSIS provided me the exposure and familiarity with tools like python to feel confident in the workplace rolling up my sleeves and digging deep into the data to make better-informed decisions with my team and invent on behalf of our customers. In the long term, MSIS fueled my passion for a career in tech to build new products and technologies to face evolving challenges.”\n\nAshley ParkMSIS Class of 2017\n\nProduct Intelligence Manager, Microsoft\n\n“MSIS was the most valuable investment that I have made in advancing my career. Since graduating, I’ve embarked on a new career track that has me building on the valuable skills I learned in my MSIS coursework.
