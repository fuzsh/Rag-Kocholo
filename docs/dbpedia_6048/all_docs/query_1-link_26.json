This website is no longer being updated but will be available for some time as a public service.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, DHEC became two separate agencies â€” the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services (SCDES) and the South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH). Additionally, DHEC's retail food program and milk and dairy lab moved to the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. You can visit the linked agencies for your needs or visit the DHEC homepage to choose the correct agency website.\n\nWhat is PrEP Navigation?\n\nPrEP Navigation is the process of connecting people who want to use HIV medicines to protect themselves from HIV infection to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-related counseling or treatment. This is similar to case management.\n\nCase management is defined as a health care process in which a professional helps a patient or client develop a plan that coordinates and integrates support services that the patient/client needs to optimize the healthcare and psycho-social possible goals and outcomes.\n\nRecommended Trainings\n\nSelf-paced or On-demand\n\nClinical Education Initiative (CEI)- PEP& PrEP Learning Pathways\n\nNational HIV Curriculum- HIV Prevention Module\n\nNational Network of STD Clinical Prevention Training Centers (NNPTC)- Sexual Health & PrEP e-Learning\n\nAIDS Education and Training Center Program (AETC) Southeast- PrEP Curriculum\n\nPlease PrEP Me- A Frontline Provider Training on PrEP Research, Care, and Navigation\n\nIn-person or Virtual (Click to register for upcoming sessions)\n\nSC AETC\n\nSC DHEC STD/HIV\n\nPrEP 101\n\nPrEP Navigation\n\nPrEP Navigation 201\n\nPrEP Navigator Tools and Manuals\n\nHIV Risk Reduction Tool\n\nPrEP Navigation Manual\n\nIntroduction to Motivational Interviewing\n\nPatient Communication Tips/Guidelines\n\nPaying for PrEP\n\nMedication assistance programs are available through pharmaceutical companies and other nonprofit organizations to assist with covering the cost of medication.\n\nMedicaid\n\nACA\n\nAdvancing Access\n\nPatient Advocate Foundation\n\nContact Us\n\nSTD/HIV Hotline: 1-800-322-2437\n\nFor more information about nPEP or for all other inquiries, email us at PrEPMeSC@dhec.sc.gov"
