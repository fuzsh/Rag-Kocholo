        "text": "I can't see it being worth your time and money to pay someone to help you prepare. The interview is very straight-forward and the gouge at the site recommended by learflyer is right on.\n\nIn my experience, I found the interview at NetJets to be very relaxed. They weren't looking to trip you up on your answers, there was no good-cop/bad-cop play acting and the sim is not planned to have any emergencies. Know your FAR/AIM basics along with Parts 91 and 135 and you'll do fine. Be sure, though, to read about some of the more HR-type questions that have been asked. You'll get some interesting ones and you'll either have seen them on aviationinterviews.com or you'll have to think on your feet.\n\nGood luck if you've got an upcoming interview. Feel free to PM today if you have any questions.\n\nIf you truely want to work here, and are excited about being involved in one of the most solid aviation careers around, then you will do fine. Be on a proficient level with technical knowledge and open minded about working as a crew and providing for the customer. If you got all that together, let your enthusiasm shine and the job is yours.\n\nAs far as the sim- BASIC BAI. Set power and pitch, make corrections on the other gauges, if you are ever lost, go back to the AI, set a resonable attitude, and make small \"finger type corrections. Just basic \"touch\" flying. Relax, take a few deep breaths and do what you need to do to fly the thing.\n\nThere's your interview prep- I don't charge. ) Good luck to everyone. This place really is quite the job. After 2 regionals- I will never go back.\n\nTake care- once again, good luck!\n\n-DK\n\nWho would you recommend for professional prep for a NetJets interview? Does NetJets recommend anyone?\n\nHaving done interview preps and not done interview preps, I recommend skipping it. Focus on showing up at the interview with a positive attitude about a company that you truly want to work for and then just be yourself. It ain't that hard. There just trying to hire good employees.\n\nHaving said that, I guess if you've never interviewed at an airline before then paying for one interview prep in your lifetime may not be a total waste of money. But definetly don't do another one.\n\nAlso, the most common mistake I saw at the NJ interview was folks not dressed appropriately on day #2. I, for sure, would dress the way the prep services tell you (charcoal grey or dark blue suit, red (conservative) tie, nice shoes and a black briefcase. I think you should take it as seriously as walking into a major airline for an interview. In my opinion, give it another 5 - 10 years and your seniority number at NJA will be as highly sought after as the current Kit Darby 121 darlings.\n\nAlso, have fun and good luck!\n\nAgreed that the gouge online is very accurate.\n\nAs for the sim ride, if you have been flying glass for years, and even if steam, it's not a terrible idea to go find an FTD such as a Frasca (which is light in pitch and heavy in roll the way that the jurasic - and thus very unstable and jittery in pitch - Citation sim used in the interview is) or failing that whatever else is available at a nearby flight school. Good to rebuild some steam confidence- set some turbulence.\n\nIf you're lucky in the sim, you'll get paired with someone who is willing to meet with you for 20 minutes the night before to discuss what sort of callouts and CRM you are going to use. They love to see some CRM if it is smooth and helps- shows that you can pair well with a stranger in training and on the line. I was ex-Flyi (and a weigh station stint at Pinnacle) and my sim partner ex-Comair, and thanks to our common 121 experience and discussions the night before, we flew in the sim as if it was the last day of a month long pairing- that gets brownie points along with flying the profile on target.\n\nOne more thing-- if you are coming mainly from the 121 world, talk to any charter, corporate or frac pilots you know about the ins and outs of improvising, problem-solving etc. for corporate and frac type ops... it gives you some ideas for some of the wierd \"what if\" questions they may throw at you during the HR/customer service type questions of the interview.\n\nWay2broke,\n\nI would be careful of just studying the gouge on aviationinterviews.com. Sure, it's a great help to know the questions that others have been asked but if you go in there knowing the answers to the questions before they have even been asked, you will look like all you did to prepare for the interview was study the gouge. Derinda is well aware of websites like flightinfo and aviationinterviews and what people are saying, and can change things anytime. When I got ready for my NetJets interview I picked up a copy of the newest FAR/AIM and studied up on topics like 91k and 135. A lot of that stuff you already know they might ask you. Aviationinterviews gouge is good because it gives some insight to other areas that you may have not thought about. I, for one, was asked a lot of customer service questions in the interview. Do yourself a favor and do more than just study the gouge...if you really want the job, you have to look like you did more than just look up information on just a website. I really wanted this job and decided that it was worth the money to go to Aaron at Emerald Coast. He specializes in preparing people for interviews by teaching techniques that you can use in an interview to make you stand out...he does not teach gouge...and if you don't get the job, you get your money back, so you really have nothing to lose. I will agree that the job is yours to lose at a NetJets interview, they really do want to hire you, but if you feel like your interview skills could use a little polishing, call Aaron at Emerald Coast. Good luck to ya!"
