J. Trabucco, Edward Zimmerman and Miss Annie Gordon, both of Mariposa.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMariposa Gazette, March 24, 1977\n\nAnnie Zimmerman Feted on Birthday\n\nThe flower decorated Ewing wing lounge of John C. Fremont Hospital was the scene of a joyful gathering on Tuesday, March 15th, when family and friends honored the 89th birthday of Annie Gordon Zimmerman. Present were: son Edward zimmerman and wife of Oakhurst, brother \"Doc\" Gordon of Mariposa, brother-in-law Wilbur Johnson, Mariposa, Granddaughters Patsy Helgren 9with husband John and baby Chad) of Clovis and Jeanne Salvadori of Merced. June Wiltz (Mrs. Jack), niece from the Bear Valley area, was also present.\n\nClydette Waldron, Frances Wright, and Bessie Johnson represented the Hospital Volunteers and acted as hostesses. Helen Reneau created the beautifully decorated cake. Marie Connett, Volunteers presendent, and Alice Sargent, Special Services, were also present as were members of the staff and residents of Ewing.\n\nReviewing Annie Zimmerman's life is like reading a page of California history. Born in Raymond, daughter of Tom Gordon, who drove stage from Raymond to Yosemite Valley, and Nora Ashworth, Annie was one of nine brothers and sisters (another had died very young) who \"had lots of funâ€“worked and played and fought as boys and girls do\" as \"Doc\" describes it. Annie says she did not go much to school because of childhood illness and because she helped in the care of a beloved grandmother. At 19 she married Ed Zimmerman and the couple had five children, four boys and a daughter. They were ranchers in the days when ranches were self-sufficient and visits to town rare. In spite of the hard work it was a rewarding sort of life.\n\nAnnie now lives quietly on Ewing, sharing a room with Vyeva Dorchuck. The two are buddies; Vyeva says, \"Little did I think, when I used to pass Annie's place and see her working in her garden, that some day we would be sharing a room together.\" Annie stil gardens, in flower pots, and she and Vyeva are already planning next birthday.\n\nIt was a sight to be long treasured to see gentle Annie all dressed up and smooth wings of hear held back by side-combs that were a gift long ago, sitting amid the flowers, cake and birthday gifts, her numerous family around her and great grandson on her knee. \"Grow old along with me the best is yet to be\" is true in her case. The volunteers try to make it true in all cases.\n\nWhen we asked Annie what we should tell the people of the county for her, she said, \"Tell the people they are awful nice and this is a nice place.\" Annie means the county and the hospital. Annie Zimmerman is a happy and contented person and some of this rubs off on the rest of us. Good luck, Annie, as you go into your ninetieth!\n\nLeni Soares, Publicity\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMariposa Gazette, July 14, 1983\n\nAnnie Zimmerman\n\nServices were held Tuesday July 12, in the Mariposa Funeral Home for Annie Josephine Zimmerman, 95, who died July 7th, 1983 in a local hospital.
