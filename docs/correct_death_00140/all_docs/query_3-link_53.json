        "text": "The 19th century American explorer, military leader and politician John Charles Frémont served as one of the first United States senators from California and was the first Republican Party nominee for president of the U.S. in 1856 and founder of the California Republican Party.\n\nBorn in Georgia in 1813, Frémont at age 28 eloped with 16-year-old Jessie Benton, the daughter of Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri, powerful chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs, who later become Frémont's patron. Benton led the movement for ‘Manifest Destiny’ – the belief, as historian Adam Dahl writes, that “the United States had the right and duty, as a matter of divine providence, to expand over the whole of the North American continent, spreading democracy and freedom as settlers marched to the Pacific. By expanding westward and conquering foreign populations in the way, American settlers were carrying out the will of God.”[1]\n\nOn an expedition in 1846 sponsored by Senator Benton and supported by the U.S. President James Polk, Frémont made his way across the West to California. The United States Congress declared war on Mexico on May 13, 1846, after a request from President James K. Polk. In preparation for the war, Frémont, who held the rank of major in the U.S. Army, took control of California from the California ‘Bear Flag’ Republic in 1846.\n\nDuring this time, he led the Sacramento River massacre, Klamath Lake massacre, and Sutter Buttes massacre against indigenous peoples, initiating the genocide of California’s native Americans (1846-1873).[2]\n\nIn the first of these massacres, expedition members Thomas E. Breckenridge and Thomas S. Martin claim the number of Wintu Native Americans killed as \"120–150\" and \"over 175” respectively. Another eyewitness, William Issac Tustin, claimed that at least 600–700 Native Americans were killed on land, with another 200 or more dying in the water.[3]\n\nBreckenridge wrote in his account,\n\n“The settlers charged into the village taking the warriors by surprise and then commenced a scene of slaughter which is unequalled in the West. The bucks, squaws and paposes were shot down like sheep and those men never stopped as long as they could find one alive.”\n\nThomas E. Breckenridge said that the men \"had orders while in camp or on the move to shoot Indians on sight. While on the march the crack of a rifle and the dying yell of a native was not an unusual occurrence.[4]\n\nBreckenridge said that the men \"had orders while in camp or on the move to shoot Indians on sight. While on the march the crack of a rifle and the dying yell of a native was not an unusual occurrence.\n\nFrémont would eventually be arrested and sent back to Washington D.C., where he was court-martialed and convicted of mutiny and insubordination after a conflict over who was the rightful military governor of California. The massacres played no role in his court martial.\n\nAfterwards, President Polk commuted his sentence and Frémont returned to California, where he struck gold during the ‘Gold Rush of 1848’, one of many fortunes the adventurer won in his lifetime. He became one of the first two U.S. senators elected from the new state of California in 1850.\n\nFrémont later ran for President of the United States as the first Republican Party candidate in 1856, losing to the Democrat James Buchanan.\n\nAt the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Frémont major general, the third highest ranking general in the U.S. Army. He was put in command of the Union Army of the West, based in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nIt was here that, in order to put down a rebellion by Missouri Militia siding with the Confederacy, the General issued on August 30, 1861, a military proclamation which came to be known as the Frémont Emancipation.\n\nIn part, the Proclamation read:\n\n“All persons who shall be taken with arms in their hands within these lines shall be tried by court-martial, and, if found guilty, will be shot. The property, real and personal, of all persons in the State of Missouri who shall take up arms against the United States, and who shall be directly proven to have taken active part with their enemies in the field, is declared to be confiscated to the public use; and their slaves, if any they have, are hereby declared free.”\n\nHarper’s Weekly believed the Proclamation put the rebellion on notice “that open treason will necessarily involve the extirpation of slavery.” However,\n\n“The direct consequences of his decree, so far as slavery in Missouri is concerned, cannot be of much importance. Missouri does not contain 125,000 slaves, and of these considerably more than one half are believed to be held by loyal men [i.e., Unionists].”[5]\n\nPresident Lincoln opposed Fremont’s action and engineered his removal from the Union Department of the West. Fremont’s action set a political precedent that the Civil War was a war against slavery and contributed to shaping Lincoln’s opinions on the appropriate steps towards emancipation. Sixteen months later, Lincoln issued his own Emancipation Proclamation.[6]\n\nIn 1864, Indigenous tribes in Southern Oregon and Northern California signed a treaty with the United States government. The treaty merged the Klamath, Modoc and Yahooskin people into one entity as the Klamatch Tribe, and placed them all together on the Klamath Reservation.\n\nIn 1872, led by Modoc leader Kintpuash, commonly known as ‘Captain Jack’, led 150 Klamath retreated to nearby lava beds (near modern-day Tule Lake, California), where Indigenous people have lived in the area for at least six thousand years.\n\nOn April 11, 1873, a group of Modoc leaders attacked a peace commission meeting under a flag of truce, killing Brigadier Gen. Edward Canby and Reverend Eleazer Thomas. Canby’s death marked the highest-ranking military official ever killed by Native Americans.\n\nIn July 1873, six Modoc leaders were charged with war crimes against the United States for the peace commission attacks, the only time the U.S. Army charged Native Americans with that crime. A military jury convicted the men, four of whom went to their deaths, Kintpuash among them.\n\nA 1979 commemorative plaque originally erected by the Bi-County Federation of Women’s Clubs of Yuba and Sutter Counties makes no reference to the assault on a Klamath village named Dokdokwas on the shores of Klamath Lake in 1846, in which at least 14 Native Americans were killed.\n\nFor Man's grim Justice goes its way,\n\nAnd will not swerve aside:\n\nIt slays the weak, it slays the strong,\n\nIt has a deadly stride:\n\nWith iron heel it slays the strong,\n\nThe monstrous parricide!\n\n- From The Ballad of Reading Gaol by Oscar Wilde (1897)\n\n______________________________\n\n[1] Adam Dahl (2018).Empire of the People: Settler Colonialism and the Foundations of Modern Democratic Thought.
