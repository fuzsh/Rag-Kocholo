        "text": "William J. Reading and his Coffin Flask\n\nKey West, Florida\n\n24 March 2019\n\nI like these little pocket or coffin flasks especially when they have interesting locales embossed on the bottles such as this W. J. READING, KEY WEST, FLA. bottle. This image was found sitting all-alone and misfiled in my database. No idea where I initially found it or who sent it to me. So, is there a story here?\n\nA search online reveals that William J. Reading was living in 1880 in Key West, Florida and working as a wood chopper. He was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts in December 1851. As to why he went to Key West at the most southern part of Florida is a mystery. Surely, wood chopping was more lucrative in Massachusetts. By 1900, he is listed as a liquor and cigar dealer living at 905 Division Street. He is married to Pricilla Reading (37) who was born in Florida. Their children are Leslie Reading (14), Maud Reading (12), William Reading (9), Flora B Reading (7), Gracie Reading (6). Young William Edward Reading would stay in Key West and later work for a cigar factory and ice company. I’m glad he did not choose to move back to Massachusetts to sell ice.\n\nThere also is a listing for William J. Reading who worked in one of the Key West Cigar factories. I had thought that most cigar manufacturing came out of Ybor City in Tampa. Once, I had actually watched some older ladies rolling tobacco and making cigars for sale. They were even smoking cigars while they were making each cigar. The picture above depicts female cigar packers on the second story of a cigar factory in Ybor City in 1892.\n\nScott Tyson responded to a Facebook post where I had pictured the flask and said that he lives near Key West and has never seen an example before. He added that Key West was a huge cigar manufacturing town, not just Ybor City in Tampa. Key West had a large Cuban immigrant population with fairly easy access to the port of Havana, Cuba only 90 miles away. Cuban tobacco was even then known to be of excellent quality, and Key West cigars were sought after and sold all over the United States in the late 19th Century. Many of the cigar rollers were Cubans. Key West still has many of the old cigar factory buildings and the cigar makers cottages, and a few mansions built by the factory owners.\n\nI found the photo above with six men standing in front of the Key West Cigar Factory. The only identified man in the picture is William E. Dubois (1849-1933), standing on the far right. He was born and raised in Ulster County, but left to pursue a career in cigar manufacturing. William proved to be extremely successful at this business venture and was soon involved with four different cigar factories, one in Manhattan and three in Key West.\n\nMarianne Dow also replied on Facebook that she found a W. J. Reading listed as a liquor distributor in 1900 and 1903. She then found a 1930 newspaper report that the Key West landmark ‘William Reading home’ burned down.\n\nSo not much is known about this bottle or W. J. Reading. As Scott Tyson commented, cigars and whiskey, make sense. Maybe cigar retailers sold whiskey too. I would agree here.\n\nSelect Listings:\n\n1880: William J.

I posted the 1870 advertisement below in Daily Dose last August. Now, as it turns out, a bottle example (pictured above) is in the current American Glass Gallery Auction #22. Thanks to Jeff Burkhardt for calling my attention to this bottle and inspiring this post.\n\nIf you notice on the advertisement, the Reed Brothers consisted of John Reed, James Reed and Michael Reed. Their establishment was located on 9th Street, West Side Market Space in Lincoln, Nebraska. Again, they were the Proprietors of Reed’s Celebrated Overland Bitters which is prominently noted on the bottom half of the ad which was found in The Nebraska State Journal on Friday, November 4, 1870.\n\nReed Brothers\n\nJohn Reed was the lead and oldest brother of the Reed Brothers. He was born around 1841 in Birmingham, England. His younger brothers, James and Michael were twins born on July 26, 1845, also in Birmingham. All three came to Nebraska City, Nebraska Territory with their mother in 1858. For whatever reason they settled in Nebraska Territory from England, I am unsure. I bet that was quite a change.\n\nThe first map below shows Nebraska Territory in 1854. The second map shows Nebraska City and what would soon be Lincoln, Nebraska. Omaha is also marked for reference. The third map is an illustrated map of the Pony Express Route in 1860 by William Henry Jackson, courtesy of the Library of Congress. If you enlarge, you can see Nebraska City as a branch line leading to Fort Kearny. The primary route stated in St. Joseph, Missouri and terminated in San Francisco.\n\nNebraska would become our 37th state on March 1, 1867 when the first wave of settlement gave the territory a sufficient population to apply for statehood. The capital was moved from Omaha to the center at Lancaster, later renamed Lincoln after the recently assassinated President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln.\n\n[click images to enlarge]\n\nNebraska City and Lincoln\n\nWe next come across John Reed when he is noted as a 19 year old mail carrier in Nebraska City, Nebraska Territory in an 1860 United States Federal Census. He probably worked for the Overand Express or a subsidiary. The “Overland” reference would eventually be the name of a line of medicines the Reed Brothers would put out, and of course, a reference to their Overland Bitters.\n\nIt looks like the Reed brothers first went into the drug business clerking for the drug store of Daniel Whitinger in Nebraska City sometime in the early to mid 1860s. Whitinger was a physician and druggist who was born around 1830 in Indiana. Soon, John would become a partner and the drug store was renamed Reed, Whitinger and Co. They were listed as Wholesale and Retail Druggists in Nebraska City, Nebraska in 1868. John would have been about 27 years old. The twins, James and Michael, would continue to work as clerks. Eventually the firm of James Reed & Bros. was formed and continued for many years in Nebraska City. Whitinger would continue as a physician.\n\nIn the spring of 1867, the firm of Reed Brothers was organized and they were located in the newly named Lincoln, Nebraska. This was the only year that they were listed as the Proprietors of Reed’s Celebrated Overland Bitters. Lorenz & Wightman of Penn Glass Works in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania made the bottles as you can see from the base embossing below.\n\nThe Carlyn Ring and W.C. Ham listing in Bitters Bottles is as follows:\n\nR 29 Reed’s Overland Bitters\n\nREED’S OVERLAND / BITTERS // f // f // f //\n\nReed’s Drug Store, 35 Main Street, Nebraska City, Nebraska\n\nSquare, Amber, Extremely Rare\n\nEstablished 1n 1867\n\n“L&W” on smooth base, ht. 8 ¾\n\nThe Reed Brothers would continued until 1871 when S. S. Brock & Company were announced as the successors to Reed Brothers at the same address on West Side Market Square in Lincoln. James Reed, as noted above would carry the touch in Nebraska City. Market Square eventually became Haymarket Square which is represented below.\n\nAmerican Glass Gallery Listing\n\n“REED’S OVERLAND / BITTERS – NEBRASKA CITY / NEB”, Lorenz & Wightman, Penn Glass Works, Pittsburgh, PA, 1867 – 1872. Medium amber, square with beveled corners, applied sloping collar – “L&W” on smooth base, ht. 8 ¾”; (a bit of minor content haze in the base; a little exterior dullness, primarily on a side label panel, otherwise very near mint). R/H #R29. Extremely rare! Possibly the 1st example of this great Nebraska bitters to be offered at public auction.\n\nThis exceedingly rare square from Reed’s Drug Store, Nebraska City, Nebraska, was obviously playing off the name of the famous Overland Trail. The Trail was also known as the Overland Stage Line, an 1860’s Western stagecoach and wagon trail that passed through parts of Nebraska.\n\nSelect Listings:\n\n1851: John Reed, Age: 10, Estimated birth year: abt 1841, Relation: Son, Father’s name: James Reed, Mother’s name: Lucy Reed, Where born: Birmm, Warwickshire, England, Civil Parish: Birmingham St George, County/Island: Warwickshire, Country: England, Household Members: James Reed 33, Lucy Reed 34, John Reed 10, James Reed 5, Michael Reed 5, Pheoby Dudley 42 – 1851 England Census\n\n1860: John Reid (Reed), Mail Carrier, Age: 19, Birth Year: abt 1841, Birth Place: England, Home in 1860: Nebraska City, Otoe, Nebraska Territory, Post Office: Nebraska City, Dwelling Number: 116, Family Number: 96 – 1860 United States Federal Census\n\n1860: Daniel Whittinger, Physician, Age: 37, Birth Year: abt 1823, Birth Place: Indiana, Home in 1860: Nebraska City, Otoe, Nebraska Territory, Post Office: Nebraska City, Dwelling Number: 151, Family Number: 126, Real Estate Value: 6000, Personal Estate Value: 3000, Household Members: Daniel Whittinger 37, Leah F Whittinger 31, Charles S Whittinger 5, Nettie Whittinger 3 – 1860 United States Federal Census\n\n37 The “Parallels” are published in F. B. Sanborn, The Life and Letters of John Brown (Boston: Roberts Bros., 1891), 481-83. Daniel Whitinger was a physi­cian and druggist, and Samuel P. Sibley was a shoemaker. Both became active in the Republican Party in the early 1860s and Sibley, as a member of the territorial legislature, voted for an act to abolish slavery in Nebraska. Whitinger’s biography is in Dale, “Otoe County Pioneers,” 2753-57; Sibley’s is in the same source, 2330-33. While these men’s Republican party affiliation suggests support for abolition, if they were Underground Railroad operatives they managed to avoid men­tion as such in any contemporary or recollective accounts. Interestingly, Whitinger owned a farm on the west edge of Nebraska City, about a mile from the Mayhew property. See U.S. General Land Office Tract Books, Vol. 152, NSHS. Garner, Reed, and Vincent have not been further identified. They do not appear in “Otoe County Pioneers.”\n\n1865: Newspaper advertisement (below) Office D.

He was also responsible for Catawba Wine Bitters, and the bottles embossed with the cluster of grapes. Highly desirable to collectors.\n\nThe Carlyn Ring and W.C.

He was also known as the “Father of the American Grape Culture.” Among his many other attributes, Longworth was an attorney, banker, merchant, horticulturalist, abolitionist, author, and an art collector.\n\nNicholas Longworth was born on January 16, 1783 in Newark, New Jersey. His mother was Apphia Davis Vanderpoel. His father, Thomas Longworth was a Tory or Loyalist who were American colonists who stayed loyal to the British Crown during the American Revolutionary War. Their very existence was complicated as every British Functionary who refused to betray the trust placed in him was consider a traitor by the Patriots.\n\nBy the time Nicholas was born, fines and property confiscations had depleted the family funds. This left young Nicholas with an early life of comparative poverty. Thinking ahead, it was decided to teach Nicholas a trade and give him an opportunity to work with either of his two elder brothers, Joseph and Archibald. One had gone north and the other south. Nicholas chose to move to South Carolina for a brief period where he was a clerk in his elder brothers store. It was said that a careful inventory of young Nicholas’ belongings when he set forth to cross the Alleghenies was, “Six coats, black and blue; one dozen plain and fancy waistcoats; four pairs of silk and eight woolen breeches, six dozen plain and ruffled shirts; and a like number of hose and handerchiefs with cravats.”\n\n“Six coats, black and blue; one dozen plain and fancy waistcoats; four pairs of silk and eight woolen breeches, six dozen plain and ruffled shirts; and a like number of hose and handerchiefs with cravats.”\n\nAfter a spell, Longworth would leave South Carolina, arriving in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1803. Cincinnati at this point was just a burgeoning town and soon to be a city. 1803 was also the same year Ohio was granted statehood. There, he married Susanna Conner, née Howell, three years his junior who was the daughter of Silas and Hannah (Vaughan) Howell, on Christmas Eve, 1807.\n\nLongworth was a little man, and eccentric in dress, speech, and manner. He was also strong-willed and successful, so that he could afford to do as he wished. Longworth, even with all his interests, was never a political candidate nor held any political office. He was also not a faithful member of any religious organization. Grape-growing would soon dominate his life.\n\nLongworth first studied law under Judge Jacob Burnet, a well-known lawyer of great standing. Burnet was a member of the Territorial councils of Ohio from 1799–1802 and served in the Ohio State House from 1814–1816. He was considered the ‘father of the Ohio constitution’ and was an associate justice of the Ohio Supreme Court from 1821 until his resignation in 1828 to serve as United States Senator.\n\nEven without a formal education, Longworth studied hard and applied himself and was admitted to the bar in Ohio. He practiced as an attorney until 1819 in Cincinnati while buying large tracts of land. He next ventured into real estate, flipping property as his real estate dealings proved more lucrative than law. The property that he bought for a song all those years was now worth millions, and Longworth joined John Jacob Astor as one of the two largest taxpayers in the United States.\n\nBelieving Cincinnati to be an ideal location for grape cultivation, Longworth established viticulture as a successful venture on the hills adjoining the city. Along the main highway from east to west during the period of early settlement, Ohio had inevitably seen repeated trials of viticulture, suggested by the combination of southward-facing slopes and broad waters. Longworth would finally make it work.\n\nPlanting hundreds of acres and building a large wine-house, Longworth started his vineyards in 1813 and by 1820 became more serious about producing wine that would be a commercial success. At first, he was using foreign vines exclusively and was somewhat unsuccessful until 1828, when he introduced native vines or their seedlings and produced, from the Catawba, and Isabella grape, a wine of a high marketable value. He was also well-known for his experiments with strawberries and published “Buchanan’s Treatise on the Grape, with an Appendix on Strawberry Culture” in 1856.\n\nBesides being a pioneer and leading horticultural expert in his section, Longworth was recognized as an authority in national horticultural matters. His writings, though individually short and now out of date, exercised a wide influence in his day. He might be compared to Isidor Bush who put out Missouri IXL Bitters.\n\nLongworth planted a vineyard of Catawba on the Mount Adams hillside and began making a sparkling wine from the grapes using the traditional method used in Champagne. From the 1830s through the 1850s, Longworth’s sparkling Catawba was being distributed from California to Europe where it received numerous press accolades. He was then producing 100,000 bottles of sparkling Catawba a year and advertising nationally. In the 1850s, a journalist from The Illustrated London News noted that the still white Catawba compared favorably to the hock wines of the Rhine and the sparkling Catawba “transcends the Champagnes of France.” The illustration above represents the Longworth vineyard from the Harper’s Weekly, 24 July 1858.\n\nIn the mid-1850s, Longworth sent a case to American poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, then living in New York City, who wrote a poem dedicated to Nicholas Longworth titled ‘Ode to Catawba Wine.’\n\nThis song of mine\n\nIs a song of the Vine\n\nTo be sung by the glowing embers\n\nOf wayside inns,\n\nWhen the rain begins\n\nTo darken the drear Novembers.\n\nIt is not a song\n\nOf the Scuppernong,\n\nFrom warm Carolinian valleys,\n\nNor the Isabel\n\nAnd the Muscadel\n\nThat bask in our garden alleys.\n\nNor the red Mustang,\n\nWhose clusters hang\n\nO’er the waves of the Colorado,\n\nAnd the fiery flood\n\nOf whose purple blood\n\nHas a dash of Spanish bravado.\n\nFor the richest and best\n\nIs the wine of the West,\n\nThat grows by the Beautiful River,\n\nWhose sweet perfume\n\nFills all the room\n\nWith a benison on the giver.\n\nAnd as hollow trees\n\nAre the haunts of bees,\n\nForever going and coming;\n\nSo this crystal hive\n\nIs all alive\n\nWith a swarming and buzzing\n\nand humming.\n\nVery good in its way\n\nIs the Verzenay,\n\nOr the Sillery soft and creamy;\n\nBut Catawba wine\n\nhas a taste more divine,\n\nMore dulcet, delicious and dreamy.\n\nThere grows no vine\n\nBy the haunted Rhine,\n\nBy Danube or Quadalquivir,\n\nNor on island or cape,\n\nThat bears such a grape\n\nAs grows by the Beautiful River.\n\nDrugged is their juice\n\nFor foreign use,\n\nWhen shipped o’er\n\nthe reeling Atlantic,\n\nTo rack our brains\n\nWith the fever pains,\n\nThat have driven the\n\nOld World Frantic.\n\nTo the sewers and sinks\n\nWith all such drinks,\n\nAnd after them tumble the mixer,\n\nFor a poison malign\n\nIs such Borgia wine,\n\nOr at best but a Devil’s elixir.\n\nWhile pure as a spring\n\nIs the wine I sing,\n\nAnd to praise it,\n\none needs but name it;\n\nFor Catawba wine\n\nHas need of no sign,\n\nNo tavern-bush to proclaim it.\n\nAnd this Song of the Vine,\n\nThis greeting of mine,\n\nThe winds and the birds shall deliver\n\nTo the Queen of the West,\n\nIn her garlands dressed,\n\nOn the banks of the Beautiful River.\n\nThe growing tide of German immigrants coming down the Ohio Valley to Cincinnati liked his wine. Longworth had found a lucrative market and the new German immigrants wanted an affordable, drinkable table wine to continue with the traditions of their homeland, so he enjoyed a virtual monopoly. By this time, Longworth would become one of the wealthiest people in the United States.\n\nA visit to one of Nicholas Longworth’s wine cellars in 1851 revealed 75,000 bottles of sparkling Catawba, and 40,000 or so gallons of wine in casks varying from 40 to 50 gallons each. The cellar was 120 feet long, 40 feet wide and 40 feet deep. Longworth was preparing to double in size his capacity the following spring.\n\nIn 1853, Nicholas Longworth partnered with Caspar Zimmermann (Longworth & Zimmermann) to sell the Longworth wines wholesale. They were located at 177 Sycamore in Cincinnati. Anthony, John and Phillip Zimmermann were also part of the business according to a listing in a Cincinnati directory that year. By 1858, the enterprise was called Zimmerman & Co. and was being run by John, Phillip and Anthony Zimmermann. Their ‘chemical laboratory’ was located on the north side of 6th between Freeman and Canal. You see, Longworth wanted to jump on the profitable bitters bandwagon so he needed a partner and laboratory reference so he could call his product a medicine.\n\nIn 1859, the first advertisement for Cordial Catawba Bitters was found in a Buffalo, New York newspaper. The bitters was noted for Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Purpose and was being manufactured pure, by Zimmermann & Co., Manufacturing Chemists of Cincinnati, Ohio. They were noted as the successors to Longworth & Zimmermann. By this time, Longworth was fading due to health issues. Longworth’s Catawba Bitters was said to be made from pure Catawba Brandy and warranted to cure the worst cases of Dysentery and Diarrhoea. The ads many times were directed to Civil War soldiers as a remedy for change of climate and fatigue.\n\nThere is another Catawba Wine Bitters advertisement for Longworth & Grew, Cincinnati, Ohio noting that George T. Grimes as the Sole Agent in San Francisco. This is puzzling with all the Zimmermann references as there is no reference to a “Grew” in Cincinnati directories who might fit the bill. There is however a J. & B.L. “Crew” noted as grocers on the southwest corner of 3rd and Elm (J. Crew and B. L. Crew) in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1860. This is more likely the reference in the advertisement above.\n\nAnother advertisement in 1859 states that J. C. Spalding was selling, from the cargo of the American ship Josiah Bradley, 100 cases of London Jockey Club House Gin and 50 cases Catawba Wine Bitters in Hawaii. So, if you are a digger, and are looking for pontiled examples, might I suggest you head to Buffalo or Honolulu. We see the last advertisements for Catawba Wine Bitters in 1865 in the Black Hawk Daily Mining Journal where cases of the bitters were being sold by J. P. Henry.\n\nI would like to add that I can not say with 100% certainty that the Catawba Wine Bitters bottles that I have associated with Nicholas Longworth are correct but I am pretty darn sure. We will just have to wait until a labeled example is found.\n\nThe popularity of Longworth’s wine encouraged a flurry of plantings along the Ohio River Valley and up north to Lake Erie and Finger Lakes region of New York. Longworth would also encourage artists to paint scenes of the Ohio River Valley, and the Ohio River Valley Wine Trail (formerly the Nicholas Longworth Wine Trail), in Southwest Ohio.\n\nIn Cincinnati, the Taft Museum of Art on Pike Street now occupies the former residence of Nicholas Longworth. Considered a National Historic Landmark built around 1820 for prominent businessman Martin Baum, it is the oldest domestic wooden structure and is considered one of the finest examples of Federal architecture in the Palladian style in the country. Longworth, during his habitation of the mansion hired African American painter Robert S. Duncanson to paint landscape murals in the foyer, now considered as one of the finest suites of domestic murals dating from before the Civil War. Longworth supported Duncanson, America’s first famous black artist, as a mentor and financed the artist’s trip to Europe where he sold paintings to the Queen of England and other dignitaries. Landscape with Rainbow, 1859 is represented below.\n\nWith his success in wine making, Longworth participated in charitable giving throughout Cincinnati, including a noteworthy donation to the land which the Cincinnati Observatory is built on. He was kindly but eccentric and gave much money to what he called the “Devils Poor.”\n\nLongworth was also the great-grandfather of U.S. Congressman Nicholas Longworth IV (a United States House of Representatives from Ohio), and the grandfather of Civil War Union General Nicholas Longworth Anderson.\n\nNicholas Longworth would die on February 10, 1863 at the age of 80. At his death, his property was valued between $12 and $15 million dollars.\n\nGallery\n\nThe Cincinnati Grape Varieties\n\nThe Planters Banner, Thursday, August 11, 1853\n\nSelect Listings:\n\n1783: Nicholas Longworth I, Birth Date: 16 Jan 1783, Birth Place: Newark, Essex County, New Jersey – U.S., Find A Grave Index, 1600s-Current\n\n1830: Nicholas Longworth, Home in 1830: Cincinnati Ward 3, Hamilton, Ohio – 1830 United States Federal Census\n\n1840: Nicholas Longworth, Home in 1840: Cincinnati Ward 1, Hamilton, Ohio – 1840 United States Federal Census\n\n1850: Nicholas Longworth, Age: 67, Birth Year: abt 1783, Birthplace: New Jersey, Home in 1850: Cincinnati Ward 1, Hamilton, Ohio, Value of Real Estate: $2,000,000, Household Members: Nicholas Longworth 67, Susan Longworth 64, Eliza Longworth 33, John L Stetenous 18, Thomas D Carneal 64, Sallie Burk 30, Margarete, Hutchison 45, Mary Jones 25, Eliza Jones 22, Elia Durary 25 – 1850 United States Federal Census\n\n1851: Newspaper notice (below) Visit to N.

The image at the top of the post was taken at the show. Actually, there is so much more to this bottle and the man behind it.\n\nThe Carlyn Ring and W.C.

Name correctly spelled on bottle.\n\nIsidor Bush\n\nIsidor Bush was born in the Prague, Bohemia on January 15, 1822. He was the great-grandson of Israel Honig Edler von Honigsberg, who was the first Jew raised to nobility in Austria. As a child, Isidor was favored by his father Jacob as his mother, Fredericka had died when he was only three years old. Isidor Bush was privileged and was able to surround and associate himself with many Jewish intellectuals while growing up.\n\nBush was somewhat of a Renaissance man in that he was, among other things, an author, publisher, journalist, grocer, banker, railroad freight agent, politician, abolitionist, insurance agent, civic leader, philanthropist, capitalist, patriot, wine and liquor merchant, and a viticulturalist, one of the first grape growers and wine producers in Missouri.\n\nWhen Isidor was fifteen years old, he moved to Vienna and worked at Schmid’s Oriental Printing Establishment, which his father had acquired. At this young age, Bush became engrossed in the printing business and turned to the study of languages. Soon he could read and write in Greek, Latin and Hebrew along with his native German. For six years (1842–47), Bush edited and published the Kalendar und Jahrbuch für Israeliten among many other important works. Eventually, Bush became a partner and a leading book pioneer and publisher in Vienna and the firm was renamed Schmid and Busch.\n\nWith the Austrian Empire Revolution in 1848, Bush had to flee to America and settled in New York City along with many other liberal Jewish intellectuals. He arrived on January 8, 1849 with his wife Theresa Taussig who he married in 1844 and their son Raphael. There Bush opened a store that sold newspapers and stationery. On March 30, 1849, Bush founded and published the first issues of Israel’s Herald, the first Jewish weekly in the United States which was patterned after the journal he had published in Vienna. Unfortunately, the effort failed financially, so Bush had to stop operations after only three months.\n\nWith little available funds, Bush moved to St. Louis, Missouri in the summer of 1849 where his wife’s family, the Taussig’s had settled. There Bush entered into partnership with his wife’s father Charles Taussig, in the firm of Bush & Taussig. They were one of the leading merchants in the city specializing in groceries and hardware located at Carondelet and Park Avenue. Bush and Taussig would run the general store successfully on the south end of St. Louis for many years.\n\nIsidor Bush became a naturalized citizen in 1854 and ardently opposed slavery and championed the Union cause. In 1857, Bush helped incorporate and was made president of the Peoples’ Savings Bank in St. Louis. In the late 1860s he was also president of the Mechanics Savings Bank, and later served as actuary for the German Mutual Life Insurance Company.\n\nWhen the Missouri Convention was called to determine whether the state should join in the secession movement, Bush was chosen a member on the Unconditional Union ticket, and was made a member of the Committee of Nine, to which most important matters were referred such as abolishing slavery and forming a new constitution. He was also elected a member of the Missouri state board of immigration to repair losses in population resulting from the war, which post he retained for twelve years.\n\nDespite many successful endeavors, Bush never really became a wealthy person in the traditional sense. He certainly suffered his share of financial setbacks but typically was able to rebound, take care of his debts and move on. He was always on the forefront of thought and innovation and prospered sufficiently to position him as a leader in the Jewish Community and the city of St. Louis. One of those associations that Bush was prominent in was the B’nai B’rith, the famous national Jewish fraternal and philanthropic organization. His achievements within the organization were substantial. Bush also served on the City Council and Board of Education in St. Louis as he held public education in high regard.\n\nBush apparently suffered physical disabilities in a fire when he was a child that prohibited full military service, so he assisted the Union cause in other ways. When Gen. John C. Fremont (the Pathfinder) took command in 1861, with headquarters in St. Louis, Bush was made his secretary and aide-de-camp, with the rank of Captain. He submitted to Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase a plan for a government loan of one hundred million dollars, similar to the famous Rothschild premium loans of Austria. Chase feared its rejection by Congress, but was impressed with Bush’s financial genius, and offered him a Treasury clerkship.\n\nBush refocused after the Civil War back to St. Louis, and became for six years the auditor and general freight and passenger agent for the St. Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad Company. He later would become director of the railroad, serving until 1865 when the line was taken over from New York by financier Jay Gould and the State foreclosed its liens on the railroad.\n\nNext, Bush partnered in the real estate firm of Barlow, Valle & Bush. Interesting enough, Bush was able to purchase many tracts of land south of the city in Jefferson County that were next to the railroad tracks and Mississippi River. The first tract was purchased in February and March 1865 and included 241 acres near the present-day town of Pevely. He had become familiar with this land during his years with the Iron Mountain Railroad. This land was ideal as his research assured him that the land was adaptable for growing grapes and fruits while having an excellent steamboat landing.\n\nOwning this land would play out as Bush became interested in wine-making and created the Isidor Bush Wine Company. He called all his land “Bushberg,” which of course he named after himself. The image above shows the town of Bushberg facing the river in 1880. It was at one time a thriving community complete with steamboat landing, railroad station, post office, wood yard, hotel and a saloon. The image below shows the Isidor Bush house. Both images courtesy of the Missouri Historical Society.\n\nBush even had the foresight to send his son Raphael to apprentice with viticulturalists in Hermann, Missouri and Cincinnati, Ohio to learn the trade. Their grocery business had suffered during the Civil War and the senior Bush wanted to spare his son from the whims of commercial life. He also felt that agriculture was a more noble Jewish pursuit.\n\nBy 1868, the vineyard had nine acres with 20 varieties of grapes. That year the vineyard purchased the post office to handle its growing mail-order business as the company was extremely successful in raising grapes and became known for its products. Before long, Bush was considered a leading expert in viticulture. He even sent large quantities of cuttings from his vineyards to France to replace the ravages there by phylloxera as his wild American vines had a greater resistance to the root louse. In 1871, Bush hired Gustavus E. Meissener who was operating a nursery in Waterloo, Iowa to become his foreman at Bushberg. He would eventually become a partner in the wine growing and vineyard business. You can see his name on the catalogue below.\n\nBush, after years of preparation, published his first catalogue of grapes in 1869-70 called the Illustrated Descriptive Catalogue of Grape Vines, Small Fruit and Seed Potatoes. The vineyards’ reputation had spread in the 1870s so The Bushberg Catalogue evolved and only focused on grapes. This catalogue went through a number of generations and was translated into several languages with international acclaim. The catalog contained two major sections. The Grape Manual’ contained a history of grape culture and the latest information about grape growing, and the ‘Descriptive Catalogue’ described and listed native varieties, histories and characteristics. Later editions included testimonials from prominent grape growers, horticulturalists and agriculture official plus related advertising to the trade.\n\nIn 1870, Bush and his son Raphael organized the firm of Isidor Bush & Son to run the wholesale and retail trade which grew into one of the most successful wine and liquor enterprises in St. Louis. Their primary address was 314 Elm Street. It was during this period that the Missouri IXL Bitters was produced. I have only seen one example. I believe it was dug in Pekin, Illinois before it came to its present owner.\n\nThe northern California wine business was rapidly growing by the end of the 1800s and impacted the Bush wine business. There seemed to be less demand for his vines and his research. The vineyard would close in 1895. The town of Bushberg would cease to exist.\n\nIsidor Bush died in St. Louis on August 5, 1898 and is buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery. His wife Theresa had previously died in 1893. Isidor Bush was a admired person and was considered one of St. Louis’s finest citizens. He also had his name on a bitters bottle.\n\nSelect Listings:\n\n1822: Isidor Bush, Birth Date: 15 Jan 1822, Birth Place: Prague, Okres Praha, Prague Capital City, Czech Republic – U.S., Find A Grave Index, 1600s-Current\n\n1850: Isidor Bush, Merchant, Age: 28, Birth Year: abt 1822, Birthplace: Austria, Home in 1850: St Louis Ward 3, St Louis (Independent City), Missouri, Gender: Male, Family Number: 793, Household Members: Isadore Bush 28, Theresa Bush 25, Raphael Bush 5, Alfred Young 15, Charles Taussig 31 – 1850 United States Federal Census\n\n1857: Bush & Taussig (Isidor Bush), wholesale and retail grocers and hardware dealers, se. c.

L. Lyons & Co., New Orleans\n\n24 February 2019\n\nDid you know that Garry Owen Strengthening Bitters was named after an Irish tune for drinking and a quickstep dance? The song was selected as a marching tune for American military formations, including General George Armstrong Custer’s 7th Cavalry Regiment. Listen to Tune.\n\nIsaac Lazarus Lyons was born in 1837 and educated in Columbia, South Carolina. His father was Jacob C. Lyons who would open and run a successful grocery store in Columbia in 1827. The business earned its reputations as an oyster saloon for students from South Carolina College.\n\nIsaac would spend his childhood in Columbia moving to New Orleans just before the outbreak of the Civil War. He enlisted in the Confederate Army as a private, saw a great deal of service and was later promoted to Captain.\n\nAfter the war, Lyons returned to New Orleans and in 1866 engaged in the wholesale drug business under the firm name of Tucker & Lyons. In 1867, Ball, Lyons & Co. formed when Joseph Tucker retired disposing of his interest to William Ball, late of Wheelock, Finlay & Hall. By 1869, Ball, Lyons & Co. was run by partners, William Ball, Isaac L. Lyons and W.H. Dashiell. They were listed as wholesale and retail druggists located at 42 and 44 Camp, and 115 and 117 Gravier Streets in New Orleans, Louisiana. They carried a large stock of drugs, medicines, chemicals, patent medicines, paints, oils, varnishes, brushes, perfumery, cosmetics, fancy goods, soaps, surgical instruments, window glass, glassware etc. plus pure liquors, wines, ales and porters. They really had quite an operation.\n\nI. X. 7. X. 69.\n\n1869 is also the first year we see advertising for the celebrated Garry Owen Strengthening Bitters which is usually accompanied by the cryptic typography, I. X. 7. X. 69 which I suspect is a reference to the bitters inception date and maybe the 7th Calvary. The bitters were advertised as being manufactured at home from the best and purest materials based on Peruvian Bark.\n\nThe bitters was directed to travelers, pioneers, miners, sea-going men, pilots and all persons navigating rivers, lakes and bayous and for persons living on the same as they may inhale the fog which was injurious to the nervous system of man. The bitters was said to be a sure preventative and cure for swamp fevers, bowel complaints and that it would cure the bites of serpents or venomous insects.\n\nIt was also particularly recommended to females as a mild, agreeable, strengthening tonic. Of course it was said to cure a number of other afflictions such as dyspepsia, indigestion, liver complaint, jaundice, nervous debility, chronic diarrhea, scrofula, ulcers, spinal diseases and all diseases arising from derangement, oil the liver, impurity of the blood or affection of the intestines or kidneys. Basically, the bitters would fix any problem.\n\nBall, Lyons & Co. were also listed as the proprietors of Pure Cod Liver Oil, Essence of Jamaica Ginger, Flavoring Extracts, Nectar Syrup, Abraham’s Tetter and Ringworm Ointment, Abram’s Compound Arnica Liniment and Abram’s Southern Vegetable Chill Tonic. They also represented Dr. Benjamin Brodie’s Astringent Cordial, Dr. Lecock’s Cough Elixir, Abram’s Compound Concentrated Fluid Extract of Buchu, Abram’s Compound Fluid Extract of Sarsaparillsa with Iodine of Potassium and Elixir of Calisaya and Iron.\n\nIn 1874, the partnership between Ball and Lyons ends and I. L. Lyons & Co. is announced as the successor to Ball, Lyons & Co. They remain at the corner of Gravier and Camp Streets and were listed as wholesale druggists and manufacturing chemists. They would operate for decades with great success as the images below indicate.\n\nIsaac L. Lyons began selling his nectar syrup to K & B Drugstores in the 1880s, who made it into nectar sodas, nectar cream sodas, and nectar ice cream sodas at their fountains. As in Cincinnati, this became a very popular flavor and other drugstores – Schweighardt’s, Bradley’s, Berner’s, and Walgreen’s – bought the syrup from Lyons and served this flavor. By the turn of the 20th century nectar sodas were a signature flavor of New Orleans.\n\nIsaac L. Lyons was very prominent in New Orleans and was identified with many charitable and civic movements in his home city and was a member of the first board of control of the National Wholesale Druggists Association in 1882. He was at one time a director of Kingsley House, and was connected for a long time with the child welfare movement. He was a member of the Chess, Checker and Whist Club, the Boston Club and the Country Club.\n\nIsaac L. Lyons would die after a prolonged illness at 86 years old on November 14, 1923 at his residence on 2344 St. Charles Avenue.\n\nGarry Owen Strengthening Bitters\n\nThe Carlyn Ring and W.C.

I certainly understand collecting bottles from your own country, or region, or state or city, or town, as many bottle collectors do. I’m a bit of an ‘all-over-the-place’ collector, meaning that if I see or really like a bottle that has story and visuals to boot, I’m on it, and it is represented on my shelf in most cases. That is my Khoosh Bitters example at the top of the post in a topaz coloration. Great looking bottle though it is an odd size compared to most American bitters.\n\nProduct advertising states that Khoosh Bitters was held in great repute in India, both by natives and Europeans alike and that it had been used in the Indian empire from time immemorial. Apparently the name “Khoosh” is Indian with no English translation.\n\nThe label for Khoosh Tonic Bitters was trademarked in 1881 by Henry Davis & Co. in Liverpool, England. The trade mark shows a young Indian lady sitting on a tiger in an exotic locale. The woman is in control and in allegiance with the wild beast as she waves a banner with “Health” emblazoned on it.\n\nThe following year, in 1882, we see Khoosh Bitters advertised in London newspapers as ‘The Great Tonic of the Age’ and ‘The King of Bitters’. The bitters were being sold wholesale by the Khoosh Tonic Bitters Company, Limited at 12 Goree-piazzas in Liverpool and 24 King William Street in London. There is also a second product in that we now have a Khoosh Tonic Bitters and a Khoosh Bitters mentioned separately in the same advertisement. At the retail level you could buy a bottle for 4 pounds and get a sample bottle for 1/-.\n\nThe Khoosh Tonic Bitters Company published this 20-page Khoosh Bitters Tonic booklet in 1882. Click to read. The front and back covers are shown below along with two opening pages. I suppose the tiger represents the bad as Indian hunters on elephants are loading, aiming and shooting their rifles. So, buy and take Khoosh Tonic Bitters to kill that beast within you whether it be indigestion, liver disease, jaundice, heartburn, dyspepsia or the myriad of other afflictions this bitters was reported to cure. Or you could take it as an appetizer by adding a little in your tea, coffee, cocoa, or milk; and “unless taken in excess does not interfere with the colour, flavour or bouquet of the most delicate wines or liquors.” It was also strongly recommended to be taken in a wineglass of water half-an-hour before breakfast. The proprietors had all bases covered.\n\nThis was a women’s product with a method to deliver alcohol under the guise of medicine, like most bitters. “Nothing tries or irritates a man’s temper more than a sluggish liver”, so give him some Khoosh Tonic Bitters!\n\nHere below is the text from an advertisement disguised as a medical article within The Monthly Magazine of Pharmacy, Chemistry, Medicine in 1883.\n\nTHE MONTHLY MAGAZINE OF PHARMACY, CHEMISTRY, MEDICINE, 1883\n\nKHOOSH BITTERS\n\nKhoosh Tonic Bitters are being sold largely all over the Kingdom, They are bitters of the most excellent and harmless character, and prior to being introduced here have been held in great repute in India, both by natives and Europeans. The name “Khoosh” is Indian, but the English meaning of the word we do not know. The trade mark, we might also say, is Indian, in as much as it consists of a tiger and young Indian lady. The young lady seems quite at home on the tiger’s back, and is waving a flag which bears the word “Health” upon it. Khoosh bitters is a good stomachic, a first rate appetiser, and of agreeable flavour. The proprietors recommend this preparation for a variety of complaints.\n\nThe circular accompanying the sample we have received says: “It does not create that nausea on the palate that is complained of in other stimulants to the appetite; it is purely vegetable, and can be taken by the most delicate constitutions of both sexes, and is suitable for both old and young, and mixes with any kind of liquid – even tea, coffee, cocoa, and milk; and unless taken in excess does not interfere with the colour, flavour or bouquet of the most delicate wines or liquors. A few drops are sufficient, but it can be taken to suit the palate. During meals it is recommended to be taken—say about a dozen drops in a half tumbler of water—and during the meal to occasionally sip. It will be found not only to increase the appetite but it cleans the palate, thus enabling the partaker to enjoy the different viands being consumed. It is also strongly recommended to be taken in a wineglass of water half-an-hour before breakfast. By its daily use it keeps the liver always active.\n\nIt is a familiar fact, and one with which nearly all old Anglo Indians are acquainted, viz., that the principal ingredient of Khoosh is the great remedy in Bengal and the North-West Provinces for liver and bile, where for ages the native “hakims” have used and prescribed it, esteeming it of high medicinal virtue for clearing the brain and lightening the liver. The ignorance of most people on this subject in this country is immense, yet by the means of Khoosh, during the hot season in India, civilians, ladies, and all people leading sedentary lives keep themselves in health, and without this tonic life would be almost unbearable.\n\nThe Khoosh Tonic is equally efficacious in this country for weak stomachs, impaired digestion, and most disorders of the liver. It acts like magic, and not only brings back the appetite, but restores the long-lost complexion, and by acting directly on the liver, creates the bloom of health. Nothing tries or irritates a man’s temper more than a sluggish liver. Hitherto we have had recourse to either a blue or a podophylon pill, which are drastic remedies. Their effects soon pass off”, and when often used produce a bad condition of the liver. It will never be otherwise, however, until the sufferer will try the Khoosh Tonic, which gives almost immediate relief, and will prevent his requiring either of the above remedies.”\n\nThis preparation is elegantly got up; it retails at 4s., on which there is a good profit to the trade. Chemists desirous of pushing this article can have circulars and printed matter on application to the wholesale houses or to the Company, at their offices, 24, King William Street, London.\n\nThe next full-page “The Famous Eastern Bitter” advertisement is from The British Foreign and Colonial Journal. It ran for most of 1890. The advertisement notes that a Gold Medal (Highest Award) was given to Khoosh Bitters at the Liverpool International Exposition in 1886. The address for the Khoosh Tonic Bitters office in London has changed.\n\nThe Carlyn Ring and W.C. Ham listing in Bitters Bottles is as follows:\n\nK 37.5 Khoosh Bitters\n\n// s // KHOOSH BITTERS\n\nL…Khoosh Tonic Bitters, The Khoosh Tonic Bitters Co., 24 King William Street, London E.C. and 12 Goree Piazzas, Liverpool\n\n8 5/8 x 2* There are several sizes of this bottle\n\nFancy oval, Amber, LTCR, Applied mouth and Tooled lip.

Later 20th century bottles had a bas-relief glass circle with ‘KHOOSH’ on the art-deco ringed shoulder.\n\nThis next advertisement below shows that Smith, Doolittle & Smith were selling Khoosh Bitters in Boston in 1883.\n\nKhoosh Bitters would hit a snag in the late 1890s. In 1900, The Khoosh Tonic Bitters Company would be under a court order that forced the insolvent company into compulsory liquidation. Later brands would mimic the product as you can see from the circa 1917 bottle below that is also base embossed. If you look at the label closely, it says, “Established Over 100 Years.” That is a bit of a stretch.\n\nFurther below, a pair of 1917 Khoosh Bitters newspaper advertisements showing Khoosh Bitters as an appetizer and that a “Khoosh Wallah” delivers the bitters with his strange and magical powers.\n\nThe Khoosh Bitters Proprietary Ltd. in London is now the company associated with the product. This would be the last year for common advertising though you can find excess inventory being sold in later years.\n\nSelect Listings:\n\n1881: Newspaper notice (below) Local Patent and Trademark for Henry Davis & Co., Liverpool – Liverpool Mercury, etc, Saturday, June 1881\n\n1882: Newspaper advertisement (below) Khoosh Bitters, The Great Tonic of the Age, The King of Bitters, Wholesale only from the Khoosh Tonic Bitters Company, Limited, 12 Goree-piazzas, Liverpool; and 24 King William Street,London, E.C. – Liverpool Mercury, etc., Friday, December 29, 1882\n\n1883: Newspaper advertisement (below) Khoosh Bitters, The Khoosh Tonic Bitters Company (Limited), 24 King William Street, London, E.C. and 12 Goree-piazzas, Liverpool – The Standard, Friday, March 2, 1883\n\n1884: Newspaper advertisement (below) The King of Bitters – Liverpool Mercury etc, Tuesday, September 16, 1884\n\n1885: Newspaper advertisement (below) The Khoosh Tonic Bitters sold in Dublin, Ireland – The Freeman’s Journal, Thursday, December 31, 1885\n\n1888: Almanac advertisement (below) “Khoosh” The King of Bitters – Khoosh Tonic Bitters and Khoosh Bitters – Era Almanac, 1888\n\n1900: Newspaper notice (below) Winding Up Order against Khoosh (Limited) – The Morning Post, Saturday, December 15, 1900\n\n1917: Newspaper advertisement (below) The Test – Khoosh Bitters being sold as an Appetizer – The Observer , Sunday, November 11, 1917\n\n1937: Newspaper advertisement (below) Khoosh Bitters being sold at The Central Salerooms – The Guardian, Saturday, November 6, 1937\n\nDr. De Andries Pure Sarsaparilla Bitters\n\nE. M. Rusha – New Orleans\n\n19 February 2019\n\nI recently updated the post for the extremely rare Dr. Hyde’s Southern Stomach Bitters put out by Dr. Edward Caleb Hyde in New Orleans around 1868. The Dr. De Andries Pure Sarsaparilla Bitters was made during the same time period by E. M. Rusha who operated within walking distance of Edward Hyde off of Tchoupitoulas Street in New Orleans. Both of their bottles are very similar with the shape, column bevel and shoulder detail. You can see a comparison below. Maybe they were friends but they were certainly competitors with their bitters. Most likely, Hyde aped Rusha with his bitters.\n\nThe Carlyn Ring and W.C. Ham listing in Bitters Bottles is as follows:\n\nD 35 Dr. De Andries Sarsaparilla Bitters\n\nDR DE ANDRIES // SARSAPARILLA / BITTERS // E.M. RUSHA / NEW ORLEANS // f // 10 x 4 x 2 1/4 (7 3/8) Rectangular, LTC, Applied mouth, 3 sp, Column bevel, Olive green, Metallic pontil mark, Extremely rare; Amber and Olive amber, Rare\n\nEdwin Morris Rusha\n\nEdwin Morris Rusha was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on July 6, 1811. Rusha left his parents at the young age of fourteen and came to New Orleans, Louisiana. Considered well-educated, Rusha first found employment as a painter for a short spell. He apparently was optimistic and successful in his early endeavors as he sent for his mother when he was twenty years old. His father had died shortly after his departure from Philadelphia. Rusha was close to his mother and she lived with him until she died many years later.\n\nWhen he was twenty-two years old, Edwin M. Rusha went into the wholesale liquor business on Girod Street near Tchoupitoulas. He would remain on this street for half a century selling wines and liquor. He was well-known, popular and had continued success with his various pursuits which included land sales, real estate and being a cotton factor and general commission agent. It was not uncommon to see a newspaper notice saying 50 or 100 barrels of whiskey was headed his way down the Mississippi on a steamer. Great advance advertising if you liked Kentucky whiskey.\n\nOn March 9, 1837, Rusha married Mary Ann Sherman and they remained together for fifty-three years until she died in 1890. They would have fourteen children. Some would help with clerking at the liquor store. Quite a nest and a trustful work force.\n\nFor Sale: An old Negro Woman, a good Cook and Washer, to a good master will be sold at a bargain. Apply to E. M. Rusha, 24 Girod Street\n\nRusha once posted a newspaper ‘For Sale’ advertisement in 1850 where he was selling “An old Negro Woman, a good Cook and Washer, to a good master will be sold at a bargain.” I don’t have an illustration but I can certainly concur up an image in my mind. Sad, but true. I guess he was a generous man as another newspaper notice thanked him for sending the editors of The New Orleans Piscayune a basket of delicious peaches that were raised in his nursery in Livingston Parish, Louisiana.\n\nYet another newspaper notice states that his young son “had the flesh crushed off the bone of one of his hips last evening, by being caught between the cars on the Carrolton Railroad, whilst attempting, boy-like, to help himself to an outside ride.” You see these train-hopping notes in newspapers all the time, even nowadays. The New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad was one of six short-line rail systems built to connect the city of New Orleans with surrounding neighborhoods, in this case, four-and-a-half miles to the resort village of Carrollton. It was one of the first public transit trolley systems built in the urban United States. All of these referenced newspaper clippings can be read in full in the timeline at the end of this post.\n\nIn 1854, Rusha was firmly established as an Importer of Foreign Wines and Liquors and a Dealer in Domestic Spirits. He sold a wide range of products such as a general assortment of French brandies, wines, fruits in liquor, assorted cordials, bitters, essence, peppermint, curacao etc. By 1860, he was running full-page ads within the annual New Orleans City Directory. The U.S. Federal Census that year noted that he had real estate value of $50,000 and a personal estate value of $20,000.\n\nBy 1863, we see Rusha’s first advertisement for his Dr. De Andries Pure Sarsaparilla Bitters. The 1867 advertisement and illustration below looks like some pretty happy fellows partaking in his bitters. By the way, I really do not think that there was a Dr. De Andries. This was probably a made-up name to give his brand legitimacy. Rusha could not call himself a ‘Doctor’ as Edward Hyde did with his Dr. Hyde’s Southern Stomach Bitters. You could get away with a lot more stuff back then. You know, drink this medicine that was full of alcohol that was sold at a liquor establishment so you could tell your wife that you weren’t at the saloon.\n\nAlso in 1867, Rusha takes a full-page city directory ad that is similar to the ad further above but now states that he is the Proprietor of Dr. De Andries Pure Sarsaparilla Bitters. As noted previously, he actually began selling it in 1863. He says that it is sold by grocers and druggists throughout the United States and that his bitters “are the best Preventative of Health ever introduced into this Country. As a general drink they are exhilarating; they give tone to the stomach, being free from all impurities.” He also says that his bitters are “Guaranteed to be Purely Vegetable” which might make you think there was no alcohol in it. You can bet dollars to doughnuts that his bitters was fully spiked. Another ad infers that Gen. Grant was recommending Dr. De Andries Pure Sarsaparilla Bitters for Cholera.\n\nDuring all these years, Rusha was very high up in the leadership of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows in New Orleans. The I.O.O.F. was (and is) a non-political and non-sectarian international secret society and fraternal order of Odd Fellowship. It was founded in 1819 by Thomas Wildey in Baltimore, Maryland though its origins were much earlier in England.\n\nRusha left the I.O.O.F. in 1891, renouncing the secret society and joined the Catholic Church. He was in prayer with Rev. Father Cavanaugh of St. Stephen’s Church when he suffered his third stroke and died on August 24, 1893 at the age of 82. Quite a man, quite a life and quite a bitters.\n\nSelect Listings:\n\n1811: Edwin Morris Rusha, Birth: 6 Jul 1811, Pennsylvania, – U.S. Find a Grave\n\n1845: Newspaper notice (below) Dwelling House and Furniture, A Lot of Ground drawn by E.M.

The bottle also has a Philadelphia embossing on the base. I believe this bottle held the Celebrated Tobias’s Wine Bitters though that name is not embossed on the bottle. Roberts email consisted of the following text and bottle images:\n\n1850s… TOBIAS & SON PHILADAS. – This two-part mold ladies leg bitters type of bottle was dug from a 1850s trash pit from downtown Savannah Ga. The bottle has an iron pontil mark and also has applied string glass around the top that is sheared off at the lip. This bottle is nine and a half inches tall and two and three-quarters inches wide. There is a photo of another bottle like this that sold at Glass Works Auctions not too long ago that has a different type of top. – Robert\n\nLooking in the Carlyn Ring and W.C. Ham Bitters Bottles book, there is a listing for the following:\n\nT33 Tobias Wine Bitters\n\nS. Tobias, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia Directory, 1845\n\nS. Tobias & Son\n\nSolomon Tobias was born in Charleston, South Carolina in 1790. We know that he was still in Charleston in 1818 as there is “a petition of young Solomon Tobias, Charleston, for an appointment in the army, July 4, 1818.” Later Tobias advertising states that he established his wine and liquor business in 1821, presumably in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where the Tobias wholesale wine and liquor business was carried on for many decades.\n\nWe first see a hard address and reference of S. Tobias as a Manufactory of Wine Bitters located No. 93 North Fifth Street in Philadelphia in 1837. He also took out newspaper notices the same year cautioning ‘Tavern Keepers in the Country’ to be wary of spurious Wine Bitters that were being sold as his product. He stated that he continued to label all of his barrels, kegs, demijohns, and bottles with his written signature, S. Tobias. He was probably using an unembossed pontiled cylinder bottle at this time for the bitters.\n\nIn other 1837 advertising (below), Tobias was selling Stoughton Bitters, Lavender Bitters, Tansey Bitters, Brandy, Wines, Liquors and Syrups along with his signature Tobias’s Wine Bitters. He would heavily advertise his Wine Bitters up until 1850 or so.\n\nThe Library Company of Philadelphia holds this super fine print of the S. Tobias storefront that was created by William H. Rease, artist and printed by Wagner & McGuigan lithography press in Philadelphia in 1845. The image shows the four-story storefront adorned with signage on the 100 block of North Third Street. Note the prominent sign for “Manufactory of the Celebrated S. Tobias Wine Bitters.”\n\nLooking at the art above, you can play “I Spy” and see a patron entering one of the two open entryways at which a straw basket and wine cask are displayed across from a large-cask shaped sign which reads “S. Tobias No. 68 Importer & Dealer in Wines Liquors Cordials and Syrups.” At the other entryway, a laborer rolls a cask out the door near a worker entering the cellar. Within the store, the backs of a patron and a clerk are visible in the rear of the store in which shelves of liquor bottles, straw baskets, wine casks, and barrels are displayed on shelves, the floor, and the open display window. Other boxes, bottles, casks, and barrels are visible at the upper floor windows. Barrels and boxes, one marked “S. Tobias” line the sidewalk, near a street lamp in front of the store.\n\nThe print also shows partial views of the adjacent businesses and the signage adorning the storefronts of Charles M. Schott, dry goods (66 N. 3rd St.) and Scattergood & Whitall, druggists’ glassware (70 N. 3rd St.). A clerk is visible working at a table through the doorway of Schott, and a pulley and boxes are visible within the open doorway of Scattergood & Whitall.\n\nTobias became a tenant within the No. 68 North Third Street building starting in 1845 and renamed his business S. Tobias & Son in January 1847. This would have been the earliest date for Robert Biro’s bottle as the base is embossed ‘S. Tobias & Son.’ Advertising would continue through 1849 or so for the bitters.\n\nThere is also this fine full-page advertisement below in the 1848 Philadelphia Wholesale Business Directory for S. Tobias & Son showing the full front of their new store at No. 68 North Third Street, above the Arch. They are noted as Importers and General Dealers in Wines, Liquors, Cordials and Syrups and also Manufacturers of the Celebrated S. Tobias’s Wine Bitters, Wild Cherry, &c. On the ad, the S. Tobias stands for Solomon Tobias. His son was Joseph F. Tobias. They offered a wide range of liquors, wines, cordials and syrups of a very superior quality and said that Country Merchants will do well to call and examine their stock and will offer a liberal discount to those who purchase and agree to sell again.\n\nHere is an 1849 advertisement where S. Tobias & Son were selling S. Tobias’s Wine Bitters to the western gold rush market.\n\nIn 1860 or so, the liquor business was renamed Joseph F. Tobias & Company. Joseph F. Tobias and James Carstairs Jr. were partners and importers of wines, brandies etc. located at 206 and 208 S. Front in Philadelphia. Solomon Tobias was listed as living at home so he must have retired. He would pass on in 1868.\n\nThe full-page advertisement below from the 1878 Philadelphia City Directory is for Joseph F. Tobias & Co. Wine and Spirits Merchants, No. 241 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia. They were noted as direct importers of wines, brandies, Holland gins and dealers in fine old Monongahela, rye, wheat and bourbon whiskies. They were also the Sole Agents in the United States for Giesler & Co’s, Blue Seal, Blue Seal Special Dry and Dry Verzenay Champagne Wines. It says he was established in 1821 which means when his father Solomon Tobias started the business. Joseph was born five years later. Note that there is no listing for a bitters product.\n\nHere below is a section of a panoramic view of Chestnut Street in Philadelphia. You can see the Joseph. F. Tobias storefront. Again, no special bitters sign. Jos. F. Tobias & Co. would continue in business until 1893 or so at the 241 Chestnut address though at some point he moved next door to 237 Chestnut and took on new associates, Mahlon Hutchinson and Edward P. Vogele. Joseph would die in 1902. He spent his final years living at the Aldine Hotel.\n\nSo, is this bottle for the Celebrated Tobias’s Wine Bitters? Probably so. We will not know for sure until a labeled example shows up.\n\nSelect Listings:\n\n1790: Solomon Tobias, Birth Date: 1790, Birth Place: Charleston, Charleston County, South Carolina – U.S., Find A Grave Index, 1600s-Current\n\n1818: Reference: The Papers of John C.
