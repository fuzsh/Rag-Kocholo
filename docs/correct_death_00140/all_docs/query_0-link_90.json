        "text": "27 March 2020: This blog first went online in July 2015. A while back (2018) I took it offline because I was never happy with it due to the lack of useful information, especially Ruth’s. Recently I came across what I needed to update this blog and place it back online. This major update will be at the end of the original blog.\n\nBack when I first started my searching blogs I had initially been attracted to two people to research. The first was Ella Harper. The other was Ruth, but for different reasons. Where Ella got out of the business as quickly as she could, Ruth performed for most of her life. They were at opposite ends of the spectrum. I think the clincher was when I zoomed in on Ruth’s face and in her eyes I saw a certain sadness.\n\nAny time you’re doing genealogy on a particular family tree after a while you need a break, so generally I work on a different tree for a while. There were times I did this while working Ella’s, so when I did it was Ruth’s I worked on. While working on Ruth’s and I needed a break I’d work on Martin Laurello. A never ending cycle I suppose.\n\nAlthough many things were known about Ruth, there were tons of things not known, and most critical of these was her maiden name. Without it, the genealogy involved is difficult to almost impossible. So all you can do is attack it from the directions of the known facts and start shaking the tree to see what fruit falls.\n\nTo start with, what was known and disseminated from the various websites was that she was born about 1910, played the marimba and had appeared at the 1933 Century of Progress fair in Chicago and had also performed at the 1939 World’s Fair. Her condition is something called phocomelia. She supposedly had married a “normal” man named LaArgo and had a “normal” child named Tony and that sometime in the 1950s she had married a fellow performer named Earl Davis. She then continued on performing until sometime in the 1960s. This was pretty much her bio in a nutshell.\n\nLike any other search, it began with starting her family tree up on Ancestry. Unfortunately, not knowing her maiden name pretty much eliminated any idea of searches for her early life. So all you can do then is go with the facts you do have. In this case I decided to start with her son, Tony, and his father, this unnamed LaArgo.\n\nQuite a bit showed up for Tony, like marriages and divorces. There were various newspaper stories from his time as a California State Trooper, and even one story about a trip and other prizes from a game show he and his wife won. The most important thing I wanted to find out about Tony was his birth info that lists his parents (including her maiden name). Although I did not find this I was able to get his birth date from public records, and later even found out exactly where he was born, but in the end Tony basically turned out to be a dead end.\n\nI thought about contacting him online but realized that if he had wanted to discuss his mother’s life publicly we would already know more about her. So out of respect for that and his privacy I left him alone for a long time. However, after I had published Ella Harper’s blog online I did reach out to him via email, with a link to Ella’s story to show him how respectfully I wanted to cover his mother’s story. He has never responded.\n\nThis lead me back to his father’s search. Fortunately with an odd surname like LaArgo I was able to do a general search for that name and there was essentially only one man in the country with that name. The first thing I found for him was the 1940 Census. His name is George and he is in Northport, Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. It shows him as 58 years old, born in Italy, single, and in 1935 was living in Los Angeles. And lo and behold, he is working for a carnival called Frank West’s World Wonder Show. And even better, he works in the area that involves the phocomelia performers, although the enumerator had misspelled the word as philophia. 1940 Census\n\nAt this point I knew I needed to go through all the carnival workers in this census and see who the phocomelia “freak” was. Based on their son Tony’s birth date and the date of this census, 9 April 1940, I knew that Tony would had to have been conceived just a few months later. Just one page back I found her. Her name is Mary Ceder. She is 32, married and born in Massachusetts. In 1935 she had been living in Greensboro, North Carolina. Greensboro, I found out later, was the carnival owner’s home base of operations so she apparently had been with this carnival for quite some time. A man I assume to be her husband is listed right below her and is named Lou. He is a 35 year old truck driver from New York. 1940 Census\n\nWhat bothered me about this was that when married couples in this carnival were listed the women were listed as wife, or if they were listed as lodgers, the enumerator had penciled in “wife” in the block that listed them as a lodger. This isn’t the case with Mary and Lou. Maybe they considered themselves separated? If she is Ruth maybe she and George were already an item. In the end, it means that this might be Ruth. And it also means it might not. Further searching for Mary and Lou Ceder revealed absolutely nothing and was a dead end.\n\nMeanwhile I went back to concentrating on good old George. Now that I had him confirmed all sorts of things popped up. George turned out to be worthy of his own book or movie and he was apparently quite a character. Rather than go into when I discovered what about him, I am going to cover him by his actual timeline.\n\nGeorge was supposedly born about 1882 in Italy and also supposedly came to America about 1897, although I have yet to find any solid proof of either. I say supposedly because I came to the realization during the research on him that you couldn’t believe anything he said. The first documented item I can find of him is his marriage on 29 May 1928 to a Vera Mae Pearce in Denver, Colorado. This is her second marriage. She was first married to a Claude Clarence Cronbaugh in 1914 but he had passed away in 1926. Vera’s 1st Marriage George & Vera Marriage. Vera died in a car crash in Colorado only 13 months after marrying George and is buried in Riverside Cemetery in Logan, Colorado. The odd thing is that she is buried with her previous husband’s last name, not George’s. This turned out to be not so odd once you learn more about George.\n\nLess than two months after marrying Vera, George is charged with attempting to kill Vera’s sister, Margaret. He is convicted and is sent to the Colorado State Penitentiary in Fremont County, Colorado. His wife died in the car crash after he had started serving his sentence. 21 Jul 1928\n\nThe 9 April 1930 Census in Colorado shows George in prison. 1930 Census. A few months after the census George was again in the news with his claim that he was offered a pardon for money and that he’d basically been ripped off. George Pardon. Not too long after this, on 5 March 1931, George married a spinster school teacher named Catherine W Charles in Colorado Springs, Colorado. I have to assume he had been released by this time. George’s Wedding News George & Catherine Marriage\n\nAnd George is back in the news again just one month after marrying Catherine, this time involving liquor smuggling on a Greyhound bus. 9 Apr 1931. Almost exactly a year later he hits the news again, this time in the form of attempted extortion. Now he is using his middle name and claims to be a cousin to Al Capone, one of his many fanciful claims he makes during his life. 27 Apr 1932. Again a few months later in San Mateo, California, George makes a kidnapping claim involving a gun battle and gangsters. 18 Oct 1932. Then on the very next day a news story about a plan involving slot machines. Now he is referred to as a “bullet-scarred” Chicago gangster, who is a third cousin to Al Capone. 19 Oct 1932\n\nNext, he is in the news in Oakland, California in January of 1936 with an interesting story involving his ardent desire for a young lady who did not wish to be ardently desired. My question is, what did his wife Catherine think about all of this? 24 Jan 1936. On 23 October 1937 he is in Santa Ana, California and now he is a chef at the opening of a barbecue restaurant. Suddenly he has also become a “nationally famous” former personal chef to Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. I wasn’t aware that they hired chefs who were former gangsters and who are cousins to Al Capone. I did check though and never found anything at all tying him into either president. George is on the far right in this picture. Barbecue. The year 1938 shows George with a Los Angeles address and occupation as a cook. It also shows him now delving into the mining business in Nevada. 1938 Directory Mining\n\nAfter this the only references to George is the 1940 Alabama Census from the beginning of this story and another 1940 Census taken three weeks after the Alabama one, but in Los Angeles. It shows him and his wife Catherine. This doesn’t mean he was actually there at the time. There is an “x” by her name which means she is the one the enumerator talked to and who provided the information. Odds are he was still with the carnival when this was taken. 1940 Census\n\nGeorge disappears after this. I’m sure there is more out there somewhere but just not online. Catherine never remarried and went on to pass away in Los Angeles on 15 April 1954. Maybe someone out there can find her obituary for me.\n\nI don’t doubt that George married Ruth but I do wonder if he might have been a bigamist at the time. He was sure ready to marry that Hopkins girl he threatened earlier with the hammer. And I do find instances of Ruth referring to herself as Mrs. Ruth LaArgo after 1940 up until 1953. April 1946 1953 City Directory. I did get lucky and managed to find a reference to Ruth’s marriage to Earl Davis in 1954 in a Carnival newspaper. They were married in Minden, Douglas County, Nevada, not Minton as shown in the article. Perhaps a Nevada reader could dig up the real certificate? Marriage. I was also able to find a news story about a tent fire Ruth had in Pennsylvania on 5 May 1955. Fire\n\nAside from a few carnival stories and society page type of articles this is about all there is as far as Ruth’s documentation. I was never able to find her maiden name. Was she Mary Ceder from that 1940 Census? Or was it possible that Mignon was actually her maiden name? Yes, it very well could have been either. Most websites and stories say she used the Mignon name because it was French for “cute”. Personally, I don’t think it was her maiden name or the “cute” story.\n\nBack in 1933 when she performed at the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago there was a huge 100-piece marimba orchestra performing there called the Musser Marimba Orchestra Project. Each member of this orchestra had to buy a specific marimba, specially made for this performance. The marimbas all had a plaque attached with the marimba’s serial number and player’s name on it. It was a huge success. Only about a quarter of the people involved are known by name today but I don’t believe Ruth was one of them.\n\nWhat I do believe is that Ruth, an accomplished marimba player herself, would more than likely have attended their show. And during the show they performed Ambroise Thomas’ “Mignon”, which we know they did. I am betting this is where she might have gotten the name. Maybe she just really enjoyed this opera tune.\n\nI am hoping that some reader of this blog from the Chicago area can research the exposition there and see what they dig up on Ruth. Also, maybe a reader in the Greensboro, NC area can research Frank West’s World Wonders Show for any information. And anyone in California that might be able to find something on George’s marriages and divorces and also on Ruth or Earl Davis because my gut tells me that is where she and Earl probably retired. They could also have ended up in the Gibsonton, Florida area where a lot of the carnival workers wintered or retired over the years.\n\nMy gut tells me that Mary Ceder from the 1940 Census was Ruth. As time goes on I will look into that. For now Ruth is just one big question mark.\n\nUpdate below.\n\nPlease feel free to email me with any leads that may help us to re-discover this fascinating lady.\n\nThanks for stopping by! -Ray\n\nFor my other research blogs: HOME\n\nComments are welcome and encouraged. You’ll find them here near the bottom or a link to them near the top. Also feel free to share, like or follow this or any of my blogs.\n\nUpdate 27 March 2020: On a lark I recently decided to look into Ruth’s story for any additional information. Last I knew she had been married to “Hoppy Davis” and lived in California so I again checked for a death record for a Ruth Davis in the California Death Index and found over 300 of them. Would she be on this list this time? That depended on whether she still had the Davis name when she died and that Ruth was her real name. I started going down the list hoping she wasn’t on the last page. On the second page I found a possible Ruth Davis. Her name was listed as Ruth Opal Davis, and with the maiden name of Berry.\n\nI had seen Berry listed as her possible maiden name at a few sites during the original research but none of them had ever showed any proof of it. The death record show her death on 25 October 1992 in Placer County, California. Her birth showed as 21 January 1906 in Oklahoma. Was this her though? It seemed likely. The next thing to do though was to verify Earl. Checking the death index in California again showed a Carman Earl Davis dying in Placer County on 21 July 1978. Confirmation that this was our Earl came from his obituary and further research I did on him later. Obit-1 Obit-2 Now I could pursue Ruth in earnest.\n\nLater research showed her mother to be Exer E Campbell, daughter of John Steele Campbell and Rachel Augusta Elliott. Exer supposedly married a fellow with the surname of Berry during the 1905-1906 time-frame but I was unable to confirm his first name or their marriage info. In fact, there is a possibility that Berry was not Ruth’s real father.\n\nThe first document I found with Exer and Ruth was the 1910 U.S. Census living in Grady County, Oklahoma. Scroll down to line 39 and you’ll find them living with a family named Brown, where Exer appears to be a live-in maid and she has Ruth with her. Scrolling across Exer’s info shows that she is about 30 years old, married for the last 5 years or so and has given birth to one child. It also shows her father being born in Tennessee and her mother in Missouri.\n\nSometime before 1918 Ruth ended up living with an aunt. This was Exer’s older sister, Amanda. She would continue to live with her Aunt Amanda and Uncle Isaac Hall until April 1927. Here are school records from 1918 to 1926 and the 1920 Census (Ruth at bottom) showing this: 1918 1919 1920 1921 1923 1925 1926. I’m not sure why but for some reason Ruth was placed in the Cornish Children Orphans Home in Ringling, Oklahoma in April 1927. She was turned over to her mother that December. (If you go to the “was placed” link scroll down to the April 1927 date and then the December 1927 one). Ruth’s mother had married an Ernest Waldermar Forsberg Jr the previous May and was living in Yuma, Arizona when she retrieved Ruth from the orphans home. The last documented evidence of Ruth in Arizona is the 1930 Census. She’s at the top of the page. Her mother and step-father are at the bottom of the previous page.\n\nThe 1930 Census was the last document I found on her until 1941. I’m not counting the 1940 Census from the beginning of the blog because I now believe it’s not her. Back to 1941, this is when her son was born. I got lucky and came across his birth certificate, though I’ve redacted his birth date from it because he is still living. This certificate is loaded with good information. In the top section it shows that she’s lived in Yuma for 14 years. Subtract 14 from 1941 and you get 1927, the same year her mother got her out of the orphans home. At first it made me think she didn’t get into the side show business as early as believed but the next section shows that she worked in the side shows, as did her husband. Go down two more sections and you’ll see that she is listed as 42 inches (1.07 m) tall and that she delivered the baby by cesarean.\n\nI wasn’t able to find any more on first husband, George, but I did on her second husband, Carman Earl “Hoppy” Davis. He was born in Columbus, Ohio on 17 March 1913, although I found no birth record proving it. His true parents are unknown but he was supposedly the son of an unknown wife of one William Charles Davis. The mother is out of the picture by 1916 when William marries again. Meanwhile, Carman is adopted by William’s sister, Rheatta “Rosetta” Davis. She is married to Charles Mayer. This is a Columbus newspaper clipping about Carman:"
