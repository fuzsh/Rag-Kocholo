Horwood and Wright Health Underwear The state of New Jersey had annual inspections of factory facilities. In different years different information was given in the inspection reports. In 1887 information included: the name of the company, goods manufactured, a brief description of the building, total number of employees, no of male employees, number of female employees, Number of employees under the age of 16. In 1890 and 1892 the information included: the name of the company, goods manufactured, the number of male employees, the number of female employees, the number of employees under 156 and the number of children discharged (if any). In 1898 the information included: the name of the company, goods manufactured, the number of male employees, the number of female employees, the number of employees under 16 and general comments when applicable. American Lead Pencil - Pencil Manufacturers - Fifth and Clinton American Lead pencil, manufacturer of Venus pencils, was established in 1860 by Edward Weissenborn. By 1901 it employed 789 people. 1868 : WANTED - FOUR FIRST CLASS HANDS (GIRLS) to make boxes, good wages, and permanent situation. Apply American Lead Pencil Company, 269 canal street 1872 : Out of 150 hands employed at the American Lead Pencil company about 80 were woman. (Report on Condition of Woman and Child Wage-earners Volumes 8-10 By United States. Bureau of Labor, Charles Patrick Neill) 1874 : American Lead Pencil of Hoboken employed twenty-five \"boys\" who went out on an impromptu strike in early August for \"fun\". The parents of the boys soundly thrashed them with a cat 'o nine tails and the boys returned to work the next day. (The Utica Sunday Tribune and other papers) 1880 : In June 1880 a fire broke out around 2:30 in the drying room of the American Lead Pencil plant at 5th and Clinton. The factory employed a large number of \"boys and girls\". Smoke was pouring out of the widows. Orders were issued for no one to leave the building. The doors were locked to \"prevent the frightened children from getting out in the street\". Some children gather on the roof top and their friends and relatives stood on the sidewalk calling for the children to come out. The superintendent refused to let the children go and also refused the help of the fire department saying they American Lead Pencil employees could put out the fire themselves. The firemen were obliged to break into the factory by force and release the children. Stock valued at $41,500 was damaged. The superintendent claimed that the drying room was fire proof and the fire would not have spread to where the children were. 1885 : \"JERSEY CITY, Aug. II, A wall of the American lead pencil company's three story brick factory, at Fifth and Clinton streets, Hoboken, fell outward upon laborers, who were excavating in an adjoining lot and had carelessly undermined the building.\" Two workmen died and it was feared that others were under the debris. 1887 : 4 story brick building - Employment total 300 - 100 men, 200 women and 16 under 16 years old. 1890 : Employment 125 men, 200 women and 30 under 16 years old. 1888 : \"The reports in some of the daily and afternoon papers regarding an explosion and fire at the American Lead Pencil Company's factory in Hoboken, on the 20th inst., are grossly exaggerated. The flaming head lines and lurid descriptions of the \"terrible catastrophe\" might have been judiciously \"boiled down \" to a modest paragraph of a dozen lines. The truth is that, instead of a number of people being \"fatally injured,\" only one met with an accident worth notice, and this was a girl, who had two ribs broken, but who expects to be at her post again shortly. The total loss will not exceed $1,000, which is covered by insurance. The fire occurred in the sawdust shop.\" (American Stationer) 1890 : Maggie Beyer who lived with her parents at 71 Willow Street, Hoboken was employed by the American Lead Pencil company when she was discharged on Friday by Miss Nellie Crosby. Miss Crosby was in charge of about 300 \"girls\" and fired Maggie for being careless with her work. On Saturday Maggie returned to work having snuck into the factory in order to get her revenge. Maggie went to the closet where Nellie kept her cloths and cut Nellie's silk dress to shreds. Some of the \"girls\" surrounded Maggie and made her a prisoner. 1890 : A 31 year old woman suffering from mental strain committed suicide by hanging herself. Her 68 years old father was so distraught he shot himself in the head with a pistol. A doctor arrived and ordered the father to the hospital. A watchman at the American Pencil Factory refused to allow the use of the telephone to call an ambulance and the morgue wagon. 1891 : In 1891 girls in the cedar sorting department went on strike at the American Lead Pencil factory in Hoboken. They reached a compromise with the superintendent Hoffman by which they agreed to return to work at a 5 per cent deduction of wages. They had struck against a 10 cent reduction in wages. The average wage was $5 per week. The work was said to be hard. The building was not adequately heated and rain sometimes came through the roof. The girls complained they had to work with their cloaks, hats and wraps on. The superintendent claimed the company had little trouble with their employees except the grils in the sorting department. 1892 : Employment 150 men, 125 women and 50 under 16 years old. 1893 : March Amelia Golz claimed she was assaulted by two co-workers at the American Lead Pencil factory (namely Mamie Carney and Katie Nugent) for refusing to skip work on St. Patrick's Day. The three had agreeded to skip work but Amelia went to work anyway. Mamie and Katie met Amelia at the door of the factory at days end. There was name calling, hitting and hair pulling. 1896 : Henry Beck, a German, who with his wife ran a saloon in New York City worked at American Lead Pencil Company, at Hoboken in 1896. \"His hours there were from seven in the morning until six at night, and he has worked there from 1896 to date. His wages began at $5.50 per week, and have gradually advanced until he is now receiving $14 a week. All of these wages were turned over every week by him to his wife, saving the following amounts, which she gave him back for his personal expenses: At first, $1.25; then $2.75, and finally, $3 a week. The man would go to his work, as above stated, at seven o'clock in the morning, after having first opened the saloon at five o'clock. He would return about six-thirty and attend the saloon while his wife got her supper, and would then be in and about the saloon until it was closed. During the rest of the time the wife and the older children ran the saloon.\" (Reports of Cases Decided in the Court of Chancery of the State of New Jersey Volume 77 By New Jersey. Court of Chancery) 1898 : Employment 165 men, 130 women and 60 under 16 years old - 35 girls failed to attend night school 1899 : William Burt, an engineer at the American Lead Pencil factory in Clinton street between 5th and 6th in Hoboken discovered a fire in the finishing room on the third floor around 7 o'clock in the evening. The company's own fire briggade was unable to contain the fire and the city firedepartment was called. The finishing room was stocked with thousands of gross of pencils - most of which were destroyed by the flames. There was also water damage to the building. The company employed about 800 \"hands\". 1899 : In September Woerner Dunkin of 367 Germania Ave. Jersey City was an employee of American Lead Pencil. He was married and was a already a grandfather but his fellow workers though he was single. While at work Mr. Dunkin \"struck up and acquaintance\" with Mrs. Minnie Kaiser a widow who lived in the apartment directly behind the pencil factory. \"The acquaintance ripened into an affection several shades closer than that accepted as platonic, the factory girls declared.\" Mrs. Kaiser was robbed of $9 by one James Carswell. Mr. Dunkin had Carswell arrested. When the case came before the judge Mr. Dunkin further asked the judge to throw the book at Carswell. The judge suspended decision because the amount was triviling and Carswell swore to pay it back. Subsequently Carswell found out that Dunkin was married and to get revenge he told Dunkin's wife of his infidelities. Mrs. Dunkin proceded to the Kaiser house and beat up on Mrs. Kaiser and her daughter, Martha. Mrs. Dunkin was accused of assault. 1899 : September, Four girls employed at the American Pencil Factory - Dora Bender, Sadie Geisler, Daisy Schmidt, and Nellie Johnson - \"bought a pitcher of birchbeer at Henry Hillmann's saloon and drank it at dinner time\". A short time later they became sick and had to go home.\" Miss Bender almost died. Miss Schmidt spent several days in bed. It was believed that someone had put poison in the drink. 1900 : The American Lead Pencil co. installed two 150 horse-power horizontal Scotch tubular boilers in their \"extensive factory\" in Hoboken.

The employees were marshalled by their captains in regular formation and made their way to the street via the stairways and the fire escape in splendid order. There was no evidence of any excitement. The fire broke out on the third floor of building No. 18 of the American Lead Pencil Company, situated on Grand Street, between Fifth and Sixth Streets, Hoboken. It was of slight consequence of itself and did almost no damage, but the letting go of the sprinkler system in the factory added to the quantity of water poured on the blaze by the local fire fighters, and damage to the machinery is expected to raise the damage total to between $3.000 and $5,000. Employees of the company had it well in hand by the time three fire companies, summoned on a still alarm, reached the scene and took up the fight. The blaze was extinguished in short order, but not before it had caused considerable excitement in the neighborhood.\" (Walden's Stationer and Printer, Volume 42) Other Products By 1908 American Lead Pencil also made erasers. They also made crayons as early as 1890. American Lead Pencil 30th Anniversary \"AMERICAN LEAD PENCIL COMPANY CELEBRATES THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY February 19, 1915, was the thirtieth anniversary of the incorporation of the American Lead Pencil Company, one of the pioneer pencil manufacturers of America. The factory of the American Lead Pencil Company is located in Hoboken, N. J. It was established about 1860, and comprised at that time, one small building located at Fifth and Clinton streets, which still stands, and is known as Building No. 1 of the present plant of the company. Numerous additions have been made, and several stories added from time to time, and besides this, the growth of the factory has been a steady one, additional buildings being added, until at this time, Building No. 21 is being erected, and the vacant space between Clinton and Grand streets, shown in the illustration, lias been bought and is being held by the company for future development. Like many successful enterprises the business of the American Lead Pencil Company has grown from a comparatively small beginning, until it now employs more than 2,000 people. The American Lead Pencil Company, besides complete lead pencils, manufactures penholders, rubber erasers, rubber bands, compasses and novelties. These goods are subdivided into many styles and classes; for instance, there are manufactured in the Hoboken factory alone, over five hundred different grades, classes and styles of black lead pencils, ranging from the ordinary kind to the famous Venus pencil. The graphite for these pencils comes chiefly from Bohemia and Mexico. The clay also comes from Bohemia, and the cedar from the company's forests in Tennessee and other southwestern states. The rubber used for rubber tips on pencils, rubber erasers and rubber bands, comes principally from Brazil. The graphite, clay, cedar and rubber are all received at Hoboken in the raw state, and the complete manufacture of the lead pencils from the very beginning is done in the numerous departments of the company's factory. The crowning triumph of the American Lead Pencil Company's Hoboken factory was the Venus pencil, which today stands in the very first rank in pencildom the world over. No manufacturer has ever produced a better pencil. It is made in seventeen degrees from the very softest to the very hardest known as well as in two copying degrees. In addition to the large factory at Hoboken, the American Lead Pencil Company has offices in Europe, four lumber mills in the South and Southwest, and a factory in London, England, where certain European wants are taken care of. The business since its incorporation thirty years ago, has practically been under the same management. The company's present officials are: Louis J. Reckendorfer, president; Byron B. Goldsmith, vice-president; Sam. J. Reckendorfer, secretary and treasurer. While it has been the policy of these gentlemen to avoid publicity, and account of the company's progress would not be complete without making the names of these gentlemen known.\" The American Stationer, Volume 77 Image - Rutgers University Edward Weissenborn, Founder of American Lead Pencil 1860 : New York Ward 17, Edward Weissenborn 31, born Baden, machinist, $300, Eliza Weissenborn 34, Albert Weissenborn 5, Rudolph Weissenborn 4, Edward Weissenborn 2, Flora Weissenborn 1, Roxanna Weissenborn 67 1870 : Edward Weissenborn 44, born Baden, manufacturer of pencils $100,000, Elisabeth Weissenborn 40, Albert Weissenborn 15, office boy, Rudolf Weissenborn 14, Edward Weissenborn 12, Flora Weissenborn 10, Oscar Weissenborn 6, Hugo Weissenborn 5 1874 : August 17, \"NORTH RIVER.

He was the son of Joseph and Babette Reckendorfer. The family was listed at East 74th street, NYC in the 1880 census. Joseph, born circa 1838 in Bavaria, was a pencil manufacturer. In 1880 the family also included Daisy, age 16, and Samuel age 10 plus three servants. Louis married Miriam Louise King in February 1890. Louis was listed in the 1900 census at 62nd street, NYC, age 33, with his wife, Louise age 28 and children Edna, age 9 and John R age 5 plus 7 servants. In 1910 Louis, President of the American Pencil Company and his wife Louise K children Edna, age 19, and Adelaide age 7 were listed as \"guests\" at the St Regis Hotel in NYC. In 1911, at the time of the marriage of their daughter Edna, the family had a home in Elberon, N. J. The family traveled frequently to Europe. They were also mentioned frequently in the csocial pres. In 1914 a large fire destroyed caused extensive damage in Elberon, New Jersey and destroyed a barn on the Reckendorfer estate. In July 1883 Louis's father, Joseph Reckendorfer, age 46, born in Furth, Bavaria, the president of the Eagle Pencil company of New York died at his \"county seat\" in Long Branch New Jersey from blood poisoning. He was the first pencil manufacturer to use American cedar. He owned extensive cedar forests in Florida. He had been active in the German American community in New York. He was survived by his wife and three children. In 1890 a real estate transaction listed Babette, widow, Louis J. and Samuel J. Reckendorfer and Daisey, wife of William Strauss, as heirs of Joseph Reckendorfer. In 1902 Samuel J Reckendorfer the Treasurer of the Americal Pencil compay purchased a new five story dwelling at 45 West 56th street. In 1907 Louis J and Samuel J REckendorfer bought 103 West 63rd street a three story private dwelling they already owned the \"block front on the west side of Broadway from 63 to 64th streets.\" In 1914 an injunction was brought against Samuel J Reckendorfer and the American Pencil company, in Taney Co Missouri to cease cutting cedar trees on the property of d. P. King and Jennie c King. In 1918 the family name Reckendorfer was changed by both Louis J and Samuel J to Reckford, as did John K the son of Louis J. The name change may have resulted due to Anti Germany feelings at the time. Louis Reckendorfer Reckfort died in 1928. Samuel died in 1949. How a Lead Pencil was Manufactured at American Lead Pencil in 1867 1867 : The American Lead Pencil Company have an establishment for the exclusive manufacture of pencils at Hudson City, N. J ., where every process-from the seasoning of the wood up to the stamping and polishing of the pencils, and the making of necessary packing-boxes and labels is carried on by the employment of some two hundred hands. The first process connected with the preparation of the blacklead is the refining. This is a chemical process known only to the manufacturers. After undergoing refining, the black-lead is placed in a drying-chamber, where it is kept in earthen pots for about two weeks. It is then conveyed to a furnace for burning; the furnace is 15 feet in hight and has a diameter of 5 feet 6 inches inside; the interior being lined with fire-brick and the walls having a thickness of about 15 inches. The black-lead is kept here exposed to a strong but slow heat for four days, after which it is washed in order to clear it from the chemical impurities. It is now taken to the mills, which are circular stones running at 80 revolutions, to be ground with water; the grinding process occupies about four days. The mixing machine next receives it. This machine has a circular concave trough in which revolves a stone like a grindstone, but with a convex face; both the trough and stone revolve, the former horizontally and the latter vertically or at right angles to the trough. Inside the trough is a stationary scraper which plows up the black-lead so that every grain of it shall successively and repeatedly pass under the stone and be thoroughly mixed; The black-lead in the course of manipulation is repeatedly sprinkled and dried. When the lead is properly prepared it has the consistency of dough; and now comes the most interesting and curious operation of converting it into the shape seen in black-lead pencils. A quantity of black-lead about ten pounds in weight is put into a small and strong castiron cylinder, into the bottom of which is inserted a small plate of crystal, in which is perforated a small hole of the size and form of the black-lead to be used. Thus, if the black-lead is to be round, the small aperture will be made circular; if hexagonal or octagonal the opening in the crystal will be also six or eight sided. The cylinder charged with the pasty mixture is then put under a powerful press, which gets its power from a combination of spur-gearing, worms, and screws. A piston or ram just of the exact diameter of the exterior of the cylinder now slowly descends and, with a pressure varying from 140 tuns to 450 tuns, compresses the lead to such a degree that it is forced through the small opening in the crystal and leaves it in a continuous coil; the black-lead being in appearance precisely like what we see incased in pencils, only that it is several yards in length. The crystal is used on account of its extreme hardness; no metallic substance can keep the necessary edge for any length of time. The coil is then cut up into the proper lengths. The length of a black-lead pencil is 6? inches; the diameter of the wood-casing depends upon the size of the black-lead. Artists' pencils are generally made with round leads, but there are several qualities made with hexagonal and sometimes with octagonal leads. The black-lead being cut up and the lengths arranged in bundles, they are next baked from three to four hours; the hardest pencils require the most baking. The leads are now ready for the casings, which are made in arapid and curious manner. The small slabs already alluded to, after being stained in a chemical liquid for ten hours and planed, are taken to the grooving machines, each containing a series of small circular cutters which, revolving at a great speed, groove out the slabs for the insertion of the black-lead. The leads are placed in these slabs, two of which are then glued together. The slabs contain five or six lengths of leads arranged side by side, and make a corresponding number of pencils. These are next taken to an ingenious machine which shapes and cuts out the pencils to a cylindrical or other form. The pencils are next polished; the manner of polishing at the establishment of the American Lead Pencil Company's Works is a method peculiar to themselves and is not at present excelled by other manufacturers. The pencils are now ready for receiving the trade-mark or the letters and numbers signifying the quality of the lead, whether it is soft or hard. The trademark of the American Lead Pencil Company was patented May 9, 1865, and applications for patents are now pending on some of their machinery. During the various operations of manufacture the leads are constantly taken to the \"proof-room\" where they are all thoroughly tested and assorted as to grades and quality. The American Lead Pencil Company display more than ordinary taste in packing their pencils in neat and ornamental cases or boxes, on some part of which are printed the letters and numbers signifying the kind of pencils contained in them. It is generally known that soft pencils are stamped with a \"B\" and hard ones with an \"H\". The softest pencil is stamped \"B B B B B B\" and the hardest \"H H H H H H\" between these two extremes, however, are many other grades of hardness, softness, and blackness, denoted by \"HB\", \"F\", \"HH\", \"B B\", etc. The different kinds of pencils for different purposes are quite numerous, as there are \"super extra fine\", \"fine\", \"polygrades Nos. 1 to 5\", \"carpenters' pencils\", \"tablet pencils\", \"artists' pencils\", \"colored pencils\", and \"pencils for special purposes\". In addition to these there are \"editors' pencils\", \"engineers' and architects' pencils\", stenographic pencils, leads ever pointed, etc. The ingenious machinery (designed and constructed by Mr. E. Weissenborn) at the pencil works in New Jersey is driven by a 50 H. P. steam engine. There are a machine-shop, carpenters' shop, printing-room, packing-room, and all other facilities connected with the manufactory, so that every requirement from the first to the last stage of the manufacture of pencils is amply provided for on the premises.\" (American Artisan and Illustrated Journal of Popular Science) American Lead Pencil and Child Labor According to the New Jersey State Factory inspections in the late 1800s and early 1900s American Lead Pencil was one of the biggest employers in Hoboken. They were the biggest employer of women and children under the age of 16 in 1887, 1890, 1892, and 1898. 1902 : \"While In the employment of the American Lead Pencil Company at its factory in Lewisburg, Tenn.. Clarence J. Davis, a boy 10 years old, received such personal injuries as necessitated the amputation of his right arm. By his father, as next friend, he brought this action against the company, and obtained verdict and judgment for $2,875 as damages. The company prosecutes this appeal in error from that judgment, and raises several objections to the proceedings. It was the duty of the plaintiff, in the course of his work for the defendant, to tie in bundles the penholders that dropped from each of two planers into boxes. These planing machines were near each other, and in close proximity to the pulley on which the plaintiff was caught and injured.\" 1904 Alec Fries and his guardian, Mary Fries, sued for damages for injuries suffered while in the employ of American Lead Pencil in Fresno California in 1904. \"The law made it the duty of the master to give cautionary instructions when a nine year old boy was employed and placed amid unusual circumstances, in a noisy room full of danger even for adults. - Fries v.

D group and had their headquarters in New York city, They opened a developing and manufacturing plant in Hoboken circa 1897. 1906 : Practically the entire floor space of the four story building housing the American Mutoscope was used to store about 10 thousand reels of film. 1907 : The factory capacity had recently been doubled.

William C. Baker (1828-1901) - 127 Grand street, Hoboken - Heating Apparatus W. C. Baker, manufacturer of car and house heaters; employed 23 persons in 1901. William C Baker was born in Dexter Maine in 1828. He died in 1901 after accidentally being hit by a train while visiting his daughter in suburban New York. In 1871 William C Baker inventor of regulating heaters purchased twenty-five acres along the Palisades above the Hudson. In 1890 William C Baker of New York applied for a railway car heater. He was also granted a patent for a hot water heater in 1893. 1893 : The offices of William C. Baker, the well known manufacturer of car-heaters, has been removed to the Central Building, No. 143 Liberty Street, New York. Mr. Baker has established new works in Hoboken, N. J., which are fitted with the best appliances for manufacturing. (American Engineer and Railroad Journal, Volume 67) 1903 : William C Baker Heating Apparatus, 127 Grand H Hoboken, New Jersey, USA Publication Title: Jersey City, New Jersey, City Directory, 1903 1895 : Mr. Wm. C. Baker, manufacturer of car heaters, has erected on the roof of one of his buildings, three stories from the ground, a 7O - ft. passenger car, fitted with steam heating pipes in several different styles for experimental purposes, in which position the car is under conditions very similar to those found in actual practice. One is a heat storage system, consisting of a 4-in. pipe running along each side of the car inside a long wooden box. These pipes within the car are filled with gravel. A perforated copper plate, running horizontally the length of the pipes, cuts off a small segment at the bottom of them in which the steam circulates. They are to be charged with steam at high pressure. This steam heats the gravel, and the heat in the pipes is constantly restored by steam rising through the perforations in the copper plate, into the gravel spaces of the pipes. Another novelty consists in a heat storage cylinder resembling, and suspended similarly to, a Pintsch gas tank. This cylinder is filled with pebbles, among which circulates a coil of pipe containing water, and leading to the piping system in the car. The cylinder is charged with steam at high pressure from a stationary boiler. Mr. Baker claims that such a charge will easily heat the car for 30 hours. The admission of steam to the pipes in the cars from the coil in the storage cylinder, in which it is generated, is automatically regulated by a brass expansion valve. Besides this system, and a standard system of piping for passenger cars also on exhibition in this car, there is shown the piping system for the new Pullman compartment cars. The exhibition car at the Baker works at 127—129 Grand street, Hoboken, is open for inspection to railroad men. It will be used during the spring for the purpose of making comparative tests of the different systems of car heating which we have described. (Railroad Gazette, Volume 27) 1896 : New Baker Boiler. There is in the Baker Car-Heater Works at Hoboken, N. J., a boiler shown used for supplying steam to drive the machinery, which is a development of the well-known Baker heater used so much for railroad car-heating. A leading peculiarity of the Baker car-heater is compactness and the large percentage of the fuel heat imparted to the water. All kinds of pipe coils were employed as heat generators, and some of them were fairly efficient; but Mr. Baker found that a brass casting forming a top and bottom tube, with vertical tubes connecting them, made a still more efficient and compact generator. He determined to try that arrangement in a steam boiler for commercial purposes, and the boiler now in use in his works embraces the inventor's ideas of the most economical means for transforming the heat of coal into dry steam. Mr. Baker was one of the first engineers to make a successful water-tube boiler, and therefore he is perfectly familiar with the line of improvement he is working upon. There are water-tube boilers used for supplying heat and steam for the Grand Central Station, New York, which were built by Mr. Baker thirty years ago. The boiler in the shops at Hoboken has fourteen generators, which connect, as seen, with a combined water and steam drum. The water passes into the lower horizontal tube, which is close to the fire, and circulates up through the vertical connections into the upper tube and thence to the drum. On the top of the upper generator tube there is a lining of brick which divides the fire chamber. The fuel gases pass first below the brick and then return on the top, imparting the remaining heat to the drum and its connections. The steam, on its way from the boiler to the engine, is passed through generators in the uptake and goes to the steam chest partly superheated. 1901 : William C. Baker We deeply regret to announce the death of William C. Baker, Upper Montclair. N. J., on February 6th. He was killed by a train of the Erie road, while on his way to New York. He was born in 1828 and had been in business for about fifty years, being the originator of the system of heating cars by hot water circulation. After making the Baker heater famous throughout the country, he designed apparatus for using steam from the locomotive, and this system is now largely used throughout the world. He was well known in all railroad circles and had a host of friends in every part of the country, to whom he was an authority on all matters relating to the heating of cars. During his business career he was connected with Baker, Smith & Co., the New York Steam Heating Company and the Baker Heater Company, succeeding the latter in his own name a few years ago. If the thousands who travel daily would stop to consider the added comfort which they enjoy due to his inventions, they would resolve never to forget the man or his invention. We understand the business will be carried on under the same management as associated with Mr. Baker during the last ten years.

Hobbs, Benton, Heath & Co. - Wallpaper - 18th street and Willow Benton, Heath & Co was in business from circa 1871 to 1917. They opened a factory in Hoboken in 1893. 1895 : July - A new and large wallpaper plant was established by Benton, Heath & Co in Hoboken. \"The new factory is remarkable for having a straight run of 426 feet, the longest on record.\" In May 1897: \"BIG FIRE IN HOBOKEN; Whole Block Swept Away and Over One Hundred Families Made Homeless. FIREMEN WERE POWERLESS Flames Started in a Factory and Communicated to a Row of Tenement Houses. ALL THE BUILDINGS PROVED TO BE VERITABLE TINDER BOXES. The Flames Broke Out in a Closet in the Factory -- Found by a Watchman, Who Believed He Had Thoroughly Stamped Them Out -- Total Loss About $650,000.\" (New York Times) The fire started in a closet of the five story brick factory in the area occupied by the wallpaper factory. It destroyed the factory and a row of fourteen five story brick tenement houses from 1203 to 1231 Washington street. The factory ran the entire block from 12th to 13th streets. The tenement buildings were about four years old and did not have fire escapes. The tenements and the factory were owned by the Hoboken Land and Improvement Company. The flooring of the factory was three inch pine planks. There were pine joists. While the outer walls of the building were brick there were no brick or fire resistant partitions inside the building. Pine is notorious for burning easily. Four firms resided in the building, Ward, Leonard & Co., Paul & Gallagher (both manufacturers of shoe brushes), Nathan Straus & co. (glass cutters) and Benton, Heath & co. wallpaper manufacturers. Benton, Heath & co. occupied the southern half of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors. Fire companies came from several towns in the area. The factory was allowed to burn as there was little to do to save it as the factory boilers exploded. The focus was directed on saving the tenements and getting the inhabitants to safety. Some effort was also made to save furniture from the tenements. Some near by canal boats also caught fire. The factory and tenements were totally lost. 1895 : THE newest Richmond in the wall paper field is the firm of Benton, Heath & Co., who have just completed their preparations for the fall campaign, and will have their new line of papers on the market before the end of the month. For several months past preparations have been going on in their new and conveniently located factory in Hoboken, N. J., which is said to be the longest wall paper factory in the world. Although this is a new firm, who are showing new goods in a new factory, the proprietors are all thoroughly experienced men in the several branches of the business. C. B. T. Benton is the son-in-law of that veteran wall paper manufacturer, Robert S. Hobbs, and has had a thorough schooling under that gentleman, having been engaged with him in the manufacture of various grades of wall paper for over nine years. This experience has made him thoroughly capable of running a factory, and he will establish the work of the new firm on the highest standard of mechanical and artistic excellence. Frederick Heath is also well known to the trade, having been with the old house of Breed, Barriclo 8: Co., from there going with T. J. Briggs. For sixteen years he was with Whiting & Young, afterward Whiting & Campbell, and later Whiting & Sons. In 1890, he became associated with Robert S. Hobbs, in which firm he had an interest. The special partners in the new firm, George Weldon and James Z. Weldon, are of the well-known firm of Rochesterjobbers. Thus it will be seen that if experience is to count for anything, the trade may look for an exceptionally fine line of papers from Benton, Heath & Co., and from what we have seen, they will have no reason to be disappointed.

Who's who in Finance and Banking, 1922 Andrew Fletcher, son of Andres Fletcher, born circa 1895 : Andrew Fletcher, after Hill School and a mechanical engineering PhB from Yale ('16), started his career as a shipyard mechanic in Wilmington, Del, became secretary of Hoboken's W & A Fletcher (a family business) two years later. The W & A Fletcher Company 1895 : The machinists at the Fletcher Shop and the Consolidated Iron Works, Hoboken, went out on strike. 1886 : The W & A Fletcher Company was boycotted for offering to repair work for a steam heating company involved in a coal strike. 1899 : August - W & A Fletcher made an attempt to fill positions of the iron workers who when out on strike in July. Sixteen non union machines and two non union blacksmiths were hired from Philadelphia. When the noon whistle blew some of the men were met by a committee of strikers. After a few minutes discussion all of the machines left the factory. The blacksmiths remained. The union gave the machines tickets to return to Philadelphia,. 1899 : September W & A. Fletcher was advertising for machinist, blacksmith, boiler makers and helpers first class to work 10 hours per day - high wages. They were advertising as far away as Wilmington, Deleware and Philadelphia. 1900 : January 29 A fire destroyed several factories including the brass foundry of W & A Fletcher & Company at 1313 Hudson street. A wooden building at the corner of 14th and Hudson next to the pattern shop of W & A Fletcher was damaged slightly. 1902 : \"Three hundred union men employed at the marine engine shops of W. & A. Fletcher at Hoboke threatened to go out on strike this this morning. The trouble was over a steamboat sent to the firm for repairs. It appears that the woodwork on the boat had been done by a nonunion firm, four of whose employes were sent with the boat to the marine yard. The machinists employed there objected to working with these nonunion men. The men remained at work pending the settlement of the matter at issue at a conference which will be held on Monday evening. Annual Report By New Jersey. Bureau of Statistics of Labor and Industries, 1902 1903 : March 11, About 150 boiler makers and iron ship builders went on strike at the W & A Fletcher works in Hoboken. Nearly 2,000 boiler makers and iron ship builders went on strike in Brooklyn. 1903 : When striking machinist left W. & A Fletcher's shop they picketed the works. The company applied for a restraining order to prevent the strikers from seeking to force out other workers still at the shop and to prevent them from persuading workers arriving at the shop seeking work to go elsewhere. The court ordered that the strikers (and their friends) could not interfere with the running of the company. Several arrests of the men were made after an initial court order stating that the strikers and their friends could not interfere with the operation of the company. 1903 : July 17, During the strike at the Flecther shops the strikers were gathering at the saloon of William Berdon at 14th and Hudsons treets. Charles Hunshaw a stike breaker from Connecticut employed in the machine shop of W & A. Fletcher when to Berdon's saloon for lunch. Berdon was accused of assaulting Hunshaw and throwing him out of the saloon. 1903 : Strikers at W & A Fletcher had been our for 14 weeks when they took the unusual action and filled out an application in the Court of Chancery for an injunction against the Fletchers and the police to restrain them from interfering with what the strikers called their legal rights in stationing pickets and the \"privileges of teses pickets while on duty\". \"On July 21 last the Fletchers asked the Court of Chancery to restrain the strikers from their organization and friends from interfering with the work and the people who called at the shops.\" The Fletchers claimed that the strikers held up people who approached the shop and attempted to discourage potential replacement workers. The Fletchers claimed this practice was unlawful and impeded their business. 1903 : Striking machinist were still out when a judge handed down his decision on the restraining order. The court ruled that W & A fletcher was not entitled to any further preliminary restraint against the picketers. In other words, the picketing was not unlawful. 1903 : Union members were expelled form their unions for scabbing at W & A Fletcher. 1904 : After threats of stikes by about 1,000 shipyard blacksmiths due to lowering of wages and agreement was reached to maintain an open shop. Workers at W & a Fletcher agreed to no sympathetic strikes and that no person other than those authorized by the employees should interfere with the workmen during working hours. 1905 : \"The strike of boiler makers at the W. & A. Fletcher Machine Shops, Hoboken, has been declared off after having continued for a period of six months. Only a part of the original number of strikers was taken back, the places of the others having been filled in the meantime.\" 1905 : The \"great and splendidly equipped\" steamship yards of W & A Fletcher ran along the Hoboken waterfront from 14th street to the North River (Hudson River). President and treasurer, Andrew Fletcher, vice president William H Fletcher. Annual Report, Volume 28 By New Jersey. Bureau of Industrial Statistics 1907 : William H Harrison age 59 of Montclair shot himself in the head resulting in death. He had been ill for some time. He was an employee of the W & a Fletcher Iron works in Hoboken. 1908 : \"One hundred men who had been employed as helpers in the boiler making department of the W. & A. Fletcher Co., at Hoboken, quit work because of dissatisfaction with their wages, which were $1.80 per day. After leaving the works the men notified the firm that they would be satisfied with nothing less than $2.00 per day. After having been idle from the 3d to the 7th of May, the men returned to work on a compromise which gave them a part of what they had demanded. The wage loss, as reported by the firm, was $500.00. Annual Report of the Bureau of Statistics of Labor and ..., Volume 30, Part 1907 By New Jersey. Bureau of Statistics of Labor and Industries 1913 : The boiler shop of W & A Fletcher was on strike over an insult to the United States Flag.

He acquired his educational training in the Volks-schule of his native city, where he was confirmed in the Lutheran church at the age of fourteen. His father, Daniel Vogt, having died while the son George was yet attending school, the boy was soon after his confirmation placed under the guidance and tuition of a master mechanic, and he was accordingly apprenticed to learn the locksmith trade, at which he faithfully served an apprenticeship of three years, and upon having acquired a thorough knowledge of the various details and technique of his chosen work, the young German mechanic next visited the principal manufacturing cities throughout Central Germany, where he worked at his trade as a practical machinist, and thoroughly perfected himself in the various details and technique of his trade. Upon his return home in his twentieth year he responded to the call of the government and presented himself for military duty, and was enlisted in the service of the German army as a reserve. Upon completing his military service in the German army, he again pursued his trade in the Fatherland up to 1849, m which year he decided to emigrate to the United States. This decision was largely caused through the changed political conditions resulting from the revolution throughout the German states at that time. The young German mechanic, being desirous of improving his condition in life, arranged his interests and family affairs, and accordingly set sail for the harbor of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he arrived August 8th, 1849. Soon after setting foot upon American soil, the young German mechanic worked at his trade in the city of Philadelphia for one year, and next made his way to the city of Reading, Berks county, Pennsylvania, where in the course of time, as a result of his industry and frugality, George Vogt, purchased his first house and lot in the city of Reading. This was coincident with the changing of the spelling of his family name. The deeds for the house and lot, having been written and prepared by a local justice of the peace, who, not being strictly familiar with the spelling of the family name of Vogt, assumed that it was spelled Focht, conforming to the spelling of the name of a family of Focht who had settled in Berks county prior to the Revolution. The deed and warrant for the purchase of the house and lot having been recorded with the name of George Focht, the purchaser, George Vogt, decided to adopt the new spelling of the name Focht for his family patronymic, which form has been faithfully adhered to by his descendants down to the present time (1917). Soon after taking up his abode in the city of Reading, the young German mechanic found employment as an engineer and machinist in his newly adopted home. He had not, however, been long engaged at his chosen work before he found ample opportunity to apply his genius and inventive powers towards improving a number of mechanical devices with which his work had brought him into immediate contact. Among the first of his inventions was an automatic self-dumping coal bucket, a device which is now universally used throughout the civilized world. This invention, along with a number of other useful and practical appliances along mechanical and scientific lines, were finally perfected by the young German machinist, and in the course of time he enabled himself to engage in business in the manufacture of these implements which he had devised and perfected. Soon after completing his inventions, Mr. Focht found a large and ever increasing demand for his wares, and in the course of time he enabled himself to erect a plant with modern facilities and all other accessories necessary for the manufacture of these special articles. In this undertaking he met with immediate success as the logical result of his practical and farsighted judgment in both the technique as well as his business ability as a manufacturer. In 1866, Mr. Focht having acquired an ample competence as a result of his industry and thrift as an inventor, he disposed of his interests in the city of Reading, Pennsylvania. He did not, however, remain idle a long time, when he decided to again engage himself in his chosen line of work, and he accordingly came to Hoboken, Hudson county, New Jersey, where he sought a suitable location, and finally purchased four building lots on the corner of First and Adam streets, in the city of Hoboken, Hudson county, New Jersey, whereon he erected a modern building equipped with modern machinery and all facilities necessary for the successful manufacturing of his specialties, the plans of which he himself had devised and perfected. In 1873, Mr. Focht purchased additional lands on the east side of Adams street, between First and Second streets, in the city of Hoboken, where he began the erection of the first of a series of buildings especially constructed to meet the requirements of his rapidly increasing trade. In 1879 the old shop building on the west side of Adams street was torn down, and upon the site he erected two modern apartment houses facing on Adams street. The present buildings comprising the foundry department, along with the pattern making department and lofts in connection with the offices and drafting department of the establishment, now occupy the space of fourteen city lots. The foundry department, along with the machine shop, are each fitted throughout with the latest improved machinery and other accessories for the successful manufacture of the various products made from iron and steel. The George Focht's Sons Iron Works and Machine Shop have become an important enterprise in Hoboken, giving employment to a large number of skilled mechanics and artisans who have built their homes and reared their families in Hoboken and vicinity. Mr. Focht's career as a manufacturer and inventor was attended with a marked degree of success, as the logical result of his skill and enterprise, along with the straightforward and honest methods in all his business dealings. George Focht died at his home in the city of Hoboken, Hudson county, New Jersey, June 20, 1898.

George, born October 3, 1856 George Focht, eighth child and eldest surviving son of George and Henrietta (Stuebner) Focht, was born at the family home in Chestnut street, in the city of Reading, Berks county, Pennsylvania, October 3, 1856. His early educational training was acquired in the parish schools of the city of Reading, and in October 1866, he was brought by his parents to the city of Hoboken, Hudson county, New Jersey, where his father, George Focht, Sr., later established himself in the iron foundry and machine business. Here George, Jr., attended Public School No. 1, in Garden street until his fourteenth year. About this time his father, George Focht, Sr., had developed a considerable business in his foundry and iron works, and here the boy finally became engaged at suitable work in the foundry department of his father's iron works, which were at that time located at the corner of Willow avenue and Second street, in the city of Hoboken, where he continued thus engaged up to his sixteenth year, when his parents sent him to Professor Fuerst's Institute, a military school located in College Point, Queens county, Long Island. Here the boy pursued his studies for some time, and upon his return home again entered upon his chosen work in the foundry department of his father's iron works, and under the guidance and tuition of the latter young Focht acquired a thorough knowledge of the various details and technique in the work of his father's iron foundry, where he remained actively engaged up to 1879, in which year the young foundryman pursued his chosen work in other establishments in New York City and in Hudson county, where he further perfected himself in the art and technique of the iron foundry business. In 1882 he again became identified with his father's iron works in the city of Hoboken in the capacity of foreman, and was thus actively engaged up to the time of his father's demise which occurred June 20, 1898.

He was brought by his parents to the city of Hoboken in 1866, and here he acquired his early educational training in the public schools, and while yet in his eleventh year his parents had him enter upon a course of study in Professor Fuerst's Institute, a noted educational institution in College Point, Queens county, Long Island, where the boy continued his studies up to his thirteenth year. He next entered upon a preparatory course of study in the Stevens Institute in the city of Hoboken, Hudson county, New Jersey, where he pursued his studies up to his fifteenth year. He then entered his father's office and counting room, where he became engaged in clerical work and at the same time pursued a course of mechanical drawing in the Cooper Institute in New York City during the evenings, and in the course of due time graduated from this institution. Upon laying aside his school books the young clerk gave his undivided time and attention to his duties in his father's office and iron works in the city of Hoboken, and by his persevering care and study, acquired a complete and practical knowledge of the various detail and technique of the different departments of the Focht Iron Foundry and Machine Works under the guidance and tuition of his father, who during the years of his early career as an iron worker and manufacturer in the city of Reading, had invented and perfected an automatic self-dumping coal bucket and other mechanical devices for lifting coal and other heavy material from the bottom of vessels, as well as from railroad cars. These special articles, along with other ingenious mechanical devices which were perfected by George Focht, Sr., are now being extensively manufactured by the Focht establishment. Charles H. Focht remained closely associated with the Focht Iron Works in Adams street, city of Hoboken, up to the time of his father's demise in 1898, since which time he has been actively identified with the management of the interests of his father's estate under the firm name of George Focht's Sons, and in this capacity he has rendered, as a result of his practical experience and business enterprise, important service which has contributed largely to the growth and development of the George Focht's Sons Iron Works which have become recognized as one of the leading industrial concerns of its kind in the city of Hoboken, where the George Focht's Sons Iron Foundry and Machine Shops have for many years furnished employment to a large number of skilled mechanics and other operatives, and has become an important nucleus to the growth and development of the city.
