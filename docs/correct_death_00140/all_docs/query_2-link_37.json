    "text": "This chapter explores the Frémonts' unusual working partnership during the Civil War, focusing particularly on the chaotic early months when John Frémont served as commander of the Western Department of the Union army, and Jessie became his chief aide and confidante. During the turbulent one hundred days of John Frémont's St. Louis command, the couple displayed both a genuine antislavery idealism, which made John the head of the radical wing of the Republican party, and an eager self-promotion that challenged President Lincoln's political career. After about three months in command, just as John claimed to be on the verge of battlefield victory, Lincoln fired his controversial general. John Frémont's subsequent Civil War career was disappointing. Despite even his wife's vigorous efforts, which included a book that justified his western command, the war left the Frémonts politically tarnished and personally embittered."
