        "text": "The family of the future president has a long history in America, as the Harrisons were among the First Families of Virginia, with the arrival of an Englishman at Jamestown in 1630, also named Benjamin Harrison. The man who would become president, Benjamin was born on August 20, 1833 in North Bend, Hamilton County, Ohio. He was the second of eight children born to John Scott Harrison and Elizabeth Ramsey Irwin, and the great-grandson of President William Henry Harrison.\n\nGrowing up, his early schooling was done in a one-room schoolhouse that was typical of the time. At the age of 12 in 1845, he was provided with a tutor that assisted him with college preparatory work. In 1847 at age 14, he enrolled in Garys Academy, near Cincinnati, which was a newly built farmers college. Benjamin attended this college for two years, before transferring to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, graduating in 1852. While at Miami University, Benjamin joined a Presbyterian church, of which he remained a life-long member. After college he started studying law in the Cincinnati law office of Storer & Gwynne, but before he finished his studies, he returned to Oxford to marry his fiancée Caroline.\n\nAt the age of 20, on October 20, 1853, at Oxford, Ohio, Benjamin Harrison married Caroline Lavinia Scott, the daughter of Miami Universitys president, Reverend John W. Scott, who also performed the ceremony. The couple would go on to have two children: Russell Benjamin Harrison (08/12/1854  12/13/1936) and Mary Mamie Scott Harrison McKee (04/03/1858 - 10/28/1930).\n\nAfter their wedding, the Harrisons returned to live on his fathers farm where he completed his law studies. Upon the death of an aunt, he inherited $800 and used this money to move to Indianapolis, Indiana in 1854. Here he was admitted to the bar and began practicing law. He also worked as a crier for the Federal Court in Indianapolis, responsible for declaring announcements on the street from the court, for $2.50 per day.\n\nEarly Political Life\n\nPolitically, Benjamin grew up in a Whig household, and was a Whig supporter in his early life. Upon the formation of the Republican Party in 1856, he joined and then campaigned on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate John C. Fremont. Meanwhile Harrison won the election to become Indianapolis City Attorney, a position that paid $400 per year.\n\nTwo years later in 1858, Harrison opened his own law firm with another as Wallace & Harrison. In 1860, Harrison was the Republican candidate for a position of reporter of the Indiana Supreme Court, and although this was not a political office, he none-the-less was an active supporter of the Republican Party platform. During the election he debated on behalf of the Republican Party against Thomas Hendricks, the Democratic candidate for governor and future vice-president of the United States. In 1860, upon his law partner William Wallace being elected to county clerk, Harrison opened a new firm with William Fishbank, where he worked until his entry in the US Army."
