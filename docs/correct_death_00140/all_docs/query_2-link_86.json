Los Angeles Almanac Photo.\n\nThe Surrender of Los Angeles & California to the United States\n\nLess than a week earlier, on the 8th and 9th of January, 1847, Mexican militia forces, under the command of Jose Maria Flores, twice failed to stop an advance on Los Angeles by U.S. forces marching from San Diego (see story). On January 10, American troops occupied the City of Los Angeles. What remained of beaten Mexican forces retreated to an encampment in what is now Pasadena. Meanwhile, another American force, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John C. Fremont, had marched into the area from the north and occupied the Mission San Fernando. Mexican General Flores, seeing the military situation as hopeless, decided to flee south to unoccupied Mexico after turning over command to his deputy Andres Pico. Colonel Fremont dispatched Jesus Pico, a man of some influence in the Mexican community, to persuade the Mexican force to surrender. With Flores still present, the Mexican commanders decided to follow the advice of Jesus Pico. On January 12, as Flores headed south, representatives from the Mexican camp returned with Jesus Pico to meet with Fremont and determine the terms for a capitulation. On January 13, 1847, Andres Pico, as newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of Mexican Forces in California, met with Fremont at a Cahuenga Pass ranch house and formally signed the Articles of Capitulation.\n\nThe following text is taken verbatim from Colonel John C. Fremontâ€™s memoirs:\n\nTo All Who These Presents Shall Come, Greeting: Know Ye, that in consequence of propositions of peace, or cessation of hostilities, being submitted to me, as Commandant of the California Battalion of the United States forces, which have so far been acceded to by me as to cause me to appoint a board of commissioners to confer with a similar board appointed by the Californians, and it requiring a little time to close the negotiations; it is agreed upon and ordered by me that an entire cessation of hostilities shall take place until to-morrow afternoon (January 13), and that the said Californians be permitted to bring in their wounded to the mission of San Fernando, where, also, if they choose, they can move their camp to facilitate said negotiations.\n\nGiven under my hand and seal this 12th day of January, 1847.\n\nJ.C.
