    "text": "John Charles Frémont was an explorer, a soldier, and a politician. He was a U.S. Senator from California and on 1856 he was the first nominee for President of the United States for the Republican Party. He was also the founder of the California Republican Party and he was a leading abolitionist and an opponent of slavery even though he was born in Savannah, Georgia. He lost the Presidency by 60 electoral votes and carried 11 of 31 states, but he paved the way for the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, to win the Presidency four years later.John Charles Frémont was born on January 21, 1813. His father was Charles Frémon, a French-Canadian immigrant school-teacher, and his mother was Anne Beverley Whiting, the youngest daughter of a prominent Virginia planter. His mother had been married as a 17 year old to Major John Pryor, a wealthy Richmond resident in his 60s. Pryor had hired Frémon to tutor his young wife, and Anne began having an affair with Frémon. The couple fled when Pryor learned of the affair and Frémont out of wedlock, a social stigma at the time. Pryor published a divorce petition in a Virginia newspaper and the Virginia House of Delegates refused Anne's divorce petition. Frémont's father died when John was 5 years old and Anne raised him and several other young children as a single parent. Frémont was able to rise from these humble beginnings, having a reputation as a self-reliant rebel. Lawyer John W. Mitchell became Frémont's patron and provided for his early education. In May of 1829 Frémont entered Charleston College, but was expelled for irregular attendance in 1831.Frémont came to the attention of eminent South Carolina politician Joel R. Poinsett, an Andrew Jackson supporter, who secured Frémont a job as a math teacher aboard the sloop USS Natchez. Frémont resigned from the navy and was appointed second lieutenant in the United States Topographical Corps, surveying a route for the Charleston, Louisville, and Cincinnati railroad. When Poinsett became Secretary of War, he arranged for Frémont to assist notable French explorer and scientist Joseph Nicollet in exploring the lands between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers.Through Nicollet, Frémont met Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri, chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs. Benton invited Frémont to his Washington home where he met Benton's 16-year-old daughter Jessie Benton. The two developed a romance, one that Benton initially disapproved of because of Frémont's lack of social pedigree. In 1841, Frémont and Jessie eloped and were married by a Catholic priest. Benton was furious about this at first, but in time he accepted their marriage and became Frémont's patron.Benton, a leader in the Democratic Party, championed the expansionist movement, and he pushed appropriations through Congress for national surveys of the Oregon Trail, the Oregon Country, the Great Basin, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains to California. Benton obtained funding Frémont to lead a number of expeditions into the Western United States.During the Mexican–American War, Frémont was a major in the U.S. Army and led a force that took control of California from the California Republic in 1846. For this, Frémont was court-martialed and convicted of mutiny and insubordination after a conflict developed over who was the rightful military governor of California. His sentence was commuted and he was reinstated by President James K. Polk, but Frémont chose to resign from the Army. He settled in California at Monterey while buying cheap land in the Sierra foothills. Gold was found on his Mariposa ranch, and Frémont became a wealthy man during the California Gold Rush. He became one of the first two U.S. senators elected from the new state of California in 1850.In 1856, Frémont, who was 43 years of age, became the first presidential candidate of the newly formed Republican Party. The party had formed in 1854 as a united political party opposed to the Administration of Franklin Pierce and the spread of slavery into the West. Frémont had been asked to be the Democratic candidate by former Virginia Governor John B. Floyd, but Frémont declared that he was against the enforcement of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law and the other components of the Compromise of 1850. Republican leaders Nathaniel P. Banks, Henry Wilson, and John Bigelow were able to convince Frémont to join their political party and the Republicans nominated Frémont for president at their June 1856 convention held in Philadelphia. The Republican campaign used the slogan \"Free Soil, Free Men, and Frémont.\" Frémont became known as The Pathfinder. The Democratic Party nominated James Buchanan as their candidate.Frémont's wife Jessie was one of her husband's top campaign strategists. As the daughter of a senator, Jessie had been raised in Washington, and she understood politics better than her husband. She was very popular within her party, but she was unable to get her powerful father to support Frémont. Benton remained loyal to the Democrats. Frémont did not actively participate in the campaign, a practice that was typical in presidential campaigns of the 19th century. The Republicans adopted a strategy that concentrated on winning four swing states: Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Indiana, and Illinois. Big-name Republicans were sent out with talking points criticizing the Democratic Party's attachment to slavery and its support of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Democrats also targeted these states, and they made an issue of Frémont's illegitimate birth and alleged that Frémont was Catholic and would therefore be more loyal to the Pope than to his country. They also ridiculed Frémont's military record and warned that his victory would bring civil war. They also spread the rumor that he would support slave insurrections.Frémont ran a strong campaign but finished second to Buchanan in a three-way election. He lost his adopted state of California. Frémont received 114 electoral votes to 174 votes received by Buchanan. Millard Fillmore ran as a third-party candidate representing the American Party (also called the \"Know Nothing Party\".) The popular vote was won by Buchanan who received 1,836,072 votes to 1,342,345 votes received by Frémont. Fremont carried 11 states, and Buchanan carried 19. The Democrats were better organized while the Republicans had a disadvantage in funding.After the campaign, Frémont returned to California and devoted himself to his mining business on the Mariposa gold estate, estimated to be valued at ten million dollars. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, he was given command of the Department of the West by President Abraham Lincoln. Frémont had successes during his brief tenure there, but he ran into trouble because of his making hasty decisions without consulting President Lincoln or his superiors at Army headquarters. He issued an unauthorized emancipation edict, something Lincoln was not yet ready to do, for fear that it would push the border states into supporting the Confederates. Frémont was relieved of his command by Lincoln because of insubordination. After a brief service tenure in the Mountain Department of the Army, Frémont resigned in 1864 and moved to New York.Frémont was nominated for president in 1864 by the Radical Democracy Party, a breakaway faction of abolitionist Republicans, but he withdrew as a candidate before the election. After the War, he lost much of his wealth in an unsuccessful Pacific Railroad venture in 1866. He also took another financial hit in the Panic of 1873.Frémont was appointed governor of the Arizona Territory by President Rutherford B. Hayes and served in that role from 1878 to 1881. He spent very little time in Arizona however, and was asked to resign, which is what he did. Frémont lived on Staten Island in retirement, relying on income earned by Jesse. In April 1890, he was reappointed as a major general and then added to the Army's retired list, an action taken to ease his financial condition by enabling him to be entitled to a pension.On Sunday, July 13, 1890, at the age of 77, Frémont died of peritonitis at his residence at 49 West Twenty-fifth Street in New York. Five days earlier he had been affected by the heat of a particularly hot summer day. The following day he came down with a chill and was confined to his bedroom. His symptoms progressed to peritonitis (an abdominal infection) which caused his death. He was initially interred at Trinity Church Cemetery, he was reinterred in Rockland Cemetery in Sparkill, New York on March 17, 1891. Upon Fremont's death, his wife Jessie received a Civil War Pension with an annual income of $2,000."
