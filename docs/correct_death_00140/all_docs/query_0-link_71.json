I saw that there was information about my family written on June 17th in your guestbook. I was wondering where you found the information. I am the daughter of Judy Graffman. Annie Isaacson was my great grandmother. I would love to know how you found your information and if you have any questions for me please let me know. I live in Baltimore,Maryland.

I'd like to\n\nexpand this with some nice info in an eMail which I kept an year ago - but\n\ncould not find on-line now. I had to do some research for a friend. His family is related to the\n\nWeizmanns from Motol. Chaim Weizmann, the first president of modern Israel,\n\nwas born in Motol, in today's Belarus. Searching for Weizmanns and Motol, I\n\ncame across this. The author of the eMail.mentioned quoted his uncle Aaron.\n\nAaron - believed to live across from the Weizmanns in Motol - said that\n\n\"the Weizmanns were so rich\" that....\n\n\"they had sugar in their tea every day.\" !!\n\nCertainly many of us take some things for granted nowadays - sugar, for\n\nexample. Extracting and refining sugar from sugar beet was the activity of\n\nsome of my family members. Probably, the Weizmann's sugar came from sugar\n\nbeet, too. By the way, I remember the tradition of cube-in-teeth and tea- in- tall-\n\nglasses (with and without handles) for family members originating as North\n\nas Vilna Gubernia and as South as Kremenchug, Ukraine.

My father was Israel, changed to Lowell Israel or Irwin here. His brother was Samuel, later Sidney. Dad had uncles Isaac, Max, Joseph?, and at least 2 aunts-Anna Plotnick and Hanna Maalla Kunin.

I (Jason I Alpert) knew Kalman and Mary well. (I was born in Lewiston, Maine, March 8, 1940.) My mother worshipped her Aunt Mary, and repeatedly took me to visit her. Many years ago, I spent a few hours with Kalman Scolnik at 210 Ash Street. I picked his brain in compiling our family tree. Unfortunately, Kalman has passed on, and the piece of paper containing that family-tree has been lost. Some things survive in my memory, to wit: Kalman said that our ultimate ancestor was named Eliyahu Der Vilner (meaning Eliyahu from the City of Vilna). This is undoubtedly the Eliyahu Zaludik that is listed on Dave Fessler's excellent family-tree (see below). (And, no -- this is NOT the Vilner Gaon.) Kalman lived to the age of perhaps 110 or 120. In case you want to try to figure out his exact age, consider this: Kalman once told me that he (Kalman) was born in Kurenitz (Kurenets in Belorus) \"the year of the big fire.\" Kalman also told me that he'd had a brother who'd changed his name to Alperowicz (a very popular family-name in Kurenitz), and that this brother had then moved (from Kurenitz) to Bobruisk (Belorus). Someone should try to locate any descendants of this displaced family-member ...\n\nKalman's wife (and first-cousin) was Mary. \"Aunt Mary\" was a sister of my grandfather (Eliyohu-Shlomo or \"E-le-SHLEY-me\") Gurewitz. My mother Dorothy Gurewitz Alpert (Eleshleyme's daughter) used to address her as \" Mi-YA-she\" (probably from the Russian name Mar-ya-sha)\" My mother OB\"M passed away Feb 1991.\n\nKalman and Mary's two unmarried sons, Bill and Eddy, still live at 210 Ash Street in Lewiston. Bill and Eddy probably possess a treasure-trove of information that could be used for family genealogical research. By this I mean correspondence from pre-war Europe. This is because the Scolniks have lived at 210 Ash Street in Lewiston \"forever\", and that address has for many years served as a rally point for separated and dispersed family members to seek each other. (According to Dave Fessler's family-tree, Bill was born in 1913, and Eddy in 1917 -- so I wouldn't procrastinate contacting them.)\n\nFor example, cousin Ida Manpel Rubin (see below) once told me the story of how she'd been reunited with her brother Elye after the Holocaust. She said that Elye had written to the Scolniks at 210 Ash Street saying that he was still alive. He'd survived the Nazis, and was living in Russia. (The only American address that he had was 210 Ash Street.) The Scolnik's contacted Ida in NYC upon receipt of this letter (more about this below). Nevertheless, Ida disliked her uncle Kalman. She called him \"a miyeser shlang!\". (Perhaps she was jealous of his great wealth???) Ida (Chaya-Hinda) MANPEL was born in Dalhinov (Dolginovo), which is now in Belarus. Ida emigrated to the USA, where she married Israel \"Tulie\" RUBIN. They lived in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nI used to have a b/w photo of Ida Manpel and her parents and siblings, sent from Dalhinov to my grandfather Louis Sam Gurewitz in Auburn, Maine. It was sent before she emigrated to the USA. Does anyone have a copy of this priceless photo? I doubt that Ida is still alive. You could check with her son Lewis -- with whom I once played chess while the Rubin family lived on (367?) Miller Avenue in the East New York section of Brooklyn -- around 1954 or so. Here is his address: Rubin, Lewis MD (Urologist)\n\n2320 Bath St # 309\n\nSanta Barbara, CA 93105 Phone: 805-682-7661\n\nAfter Ida Manpel emigrated to the USA, her brother Elye Manpel remained behind in Dalhinov (Dolginovo). Elye was there during the Holocaust. Fortunately, Elye caught the very last train that managed to leave Dalhinov before the Nazis arrived, and thus miraculously escaped the invading Nazis. MANY YEARS LATER, a letter from him was received by the Scolniks at 210 Ash Street in Lewiston. He was (is?) living in the Russian city of Orel (pronounced Aryol). I am attaching a file named Manpel.GIF. This is an image of Elye's address written in Cyrillic characters. Here is my transliteration of the Cyrillic version, and it may be WRONG.\n\nElye Manpel\n\nKomsomolskaya Street 46, Apt. 3\n\nOrël, Russia 302001 (ANSI character-set, used in Windows)\n\nOrl, Russia 302001 (ASCII character-set, used in DOS)\n\nI believe that Elye was Ida's YOUNGEST sibling. Therefore, he might still be alive. Someone should try to locate him, and any possible descendants (as well as Kalman's brother in Bobruisk, mentioned above) ...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLewis Rubin's older brother is Seymour, and the oldest is Jackie.\n\nI found these 2 addresses for Seymour on the Internet.\n\nI don't know if either is correct. Rubin, Seymour\n\n2085 Rkwy Pkwy\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11236\n\n(718) 763-5419 Rubin, Seymour\n\n4218 Bedford Ave\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11229\n\n(718) 769-2444 I also found Jackie's address on the Internet. I KNOW that this address is correct, because I used to visit Ida there.\n\nRubin, Jack\n\n2896 W 8th St\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11224\n\n(718) 373-2049\n\n(718) 373-0230 Since Jackie Rubin is occupying his parents' apartment, and since he is the oldest son -- I would think that he might be in possession of old family photos and correspondence from pre-war Eastern Europe. (Similar situation to Bill and Eddy Scolnik, above)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***** More About the Family ***** During the years 1953-1956 (when I first came to NYC from Maine to study in a yeshiva), I used to regularly visit cousin Ida Manpel-Rubin and her husband Israel (Tulie), and their three sons.\n\nThey lived in the East New York section of Brooklyn, at 367 ? Miller Avenue.\n\n(Later, they moved to 2896 West 8th Street in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn.) After visiting with Ida, I would walk over to (129?) Miller Avenue, and visit with cousin Sadie (Mrs Jake) Friedland, and her daughter Pauline. (I was just 13 or 14 years old. Ida and then Sadie would both feed me well.) I believe that Sadie had a sister (Becky Williams?) maybe in Far Rockway,NY. Besides their daughter Pauline, Sadie and Jake had a son named Al Friedland. Al married his second-cousin Estelle (nee Gurewitz), from Ithaca, New York (more below). -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy grandfather Louis Sam (Eleshleyme) Gurewitz (changed from Zaludik) had these siblings (as far as I recall): 1. Mary (Maryasha), who married her first-cousin Kalman Scolnik.\n\n(They lived at 210 Ash Street in Lewiston, Maine, as mentioned above.)\n\n2. David, of Lewiston, Maine. He never married.\n\n3. Harry, of Ithaca, New York. [I recall now that Mary's husband Kalman couldn't stomach Mary's brother Dovid. Dovid would have to sneak over to 210 Ash St. for a meal when Kalman wasn't home. Maybe this is one of the reasons that cousin Ida Manpel-Rubin didn't like him. (As I mentioned above.)\n\nI never met Harry Gurewitz. According to my records, Harry's daughter Estelle married her second-cousin Al Friedland. They had three children: Rickie, Phillip, Jay Lee, and Lisa Sue.\n\nI don't remember if I ever met any of Estelle's children. I MAY have met Estelle and Al Friedland, possibly at Sadie's home on 129 Miller Avenue in Brooklyn. I don't remember.) I vaguely remember that family members would stay with Estelle, whenever they visited Florida. (Why pay for a hotel?)\n\nMy records show her address as: Estelle Friedland\n\n17521 N. E. 1st Court\n\nNorth Miami Beach, Florida 33162 But I couldn't find it on the Internet. I am fairly sure that her husband Al Friedland has passed away. I don't know about her. The children are probably alive.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------- A 3rd son of Kalman and Mary Scolnik is Sam Scolnik. Sam is married to the former Mary Abromson. He is a (retired?) lawyer.\n\nHere is their address: Samuel and Mary Scolnik\n\n3700 Calvert Pl\n\nKensington, Maryland 20895\n\n301-949-0519\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n******** Re the surname \"GUREWITZ\" ********\n\nIda Manpel once told me that the family-name Gurewitz wasn't genuine. The name was really Zheludek (Ida even wrote Zheludek for me on a paper.)\n\nAlso, As a child, I once questioned \"Uncle Dovid\" (as I used to fondly address him) as to why the family name had been changed from Zheludek to Gurewitz. His reply was something like: \"Vos bin ich shul-dik vos der ta-te hot amol ge-ton?\" -- which gave me the impression that he couldn't, or didn't want to, explain why his father Yosef (after whom I'm named), had changed the name. Well, this is confirmed by Dave Fessler's family-tree. Only there, the name is spelled Zaludik -- which is probably more correct.\n\nThere is a Yizkor-book commemorating a TOWN named ZHELUDOK. See\n\nhttp://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/zaludok/zheludok.html\n\nMany years ago I skimmed through this book. In it I found some cousins of\n\nmine (from a different side of the family, not related to the Scolniks and Zaludiks) named ALPEROWICZ (ALPEROVITCH) and SZYFMANOWICZ (SHIFMANOVITCH). (Lyuba SZYFMANOWICZ died in the Holocaust according to page 314 in this book.)\n\nIt doesn't make sense for a family-name (surname) to be identical to a town name. Someone from Vilna might be named Vilner (not Vilna). Someone from ZHELUDOK might be named ZHELUDKER. That's why I think that Zaludik is correct. An alternate spelling might be Zaludok or Zaludek.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to Lester Solnin (changed from Sosensky) and Marian Anderson, Dave Fessler of Houston, Texas, has a large amount of information. They sent me a paper copy of Dave's family-tree, which is entitled \"Descendants of Eliyohu Zaludik. It is a masterpiece ...\n\nThey also sent me a digitized image (Paperport .MAX file) of a 1-page Report, which is information extracted from Dave's family-tree (database).\n\nDave's email address is dfessler@houston.rr.com. -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpeaking of \"Sosensky\", I vaguely recall seeing a photo of an old bearded man. I think he was a cousin named Sosensky. And I very vaguely recall being told that he was referred to as \"Der Feter\" (\"The Uncle\"). ====================================\n\nI know nothing about the following person:\n\nP Scolnik\n\nLewiston, Maine\n\n207-784-5573 -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI know nothing about the following person (Helen Manpel).\n\nPerhaps she is Ida's sister-in-law or niece?\n\nManpel, Helen\n\n1071 Eglinton West\n\nToronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nTel. 416-782-6465\n\n------------------------------------\n\nSame is true for the following couple: Manpel, Jack & Frida\n\n569 Sheppard Avenue, West\n\nToronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nTel. 416-636-9640 ------------------------------------\n\nThis is Ida's brother (a wealthy merchant?). Manpel, Louis\n\n989 Eglinton Avenue, Apt. #223\n\nToronto, Ontario, CANADA M6C2C6\n\n------------------------------------\n\n------------------------------------\n\nOn 10/13/1985 I (Jason I Alpert) attended a meeting of the KURENITZER FAREYN (Kurenitz Landsmanschaft or \"Society\"), held in New York City. There I unexpected ly met a man named Julius Scolnik, of the Bronx, NY. (This is NOT the Julius Scolnik of Lewiston, Maine.)\n\nJulius said that he is a cousin of Kalman Scolnik of Lewiston, Maine. Julius was born circa 1897. At that time, Julius's telephone was 933-1062 (now area-code 718).\n\nOn 5/15/1986 I spoke with Julius by phone. He said that a meeting of the KURENITZER FAREYN had just been held on Sunday, 5/4/1986.\n\n============= RESOURCES ============= *** Jewish Home for the Aged in in Portland, Maine (\"Cedars Campus\") *** My mother Dorothy (OBM) had a best friend. Her name was Ada (nee Meltzer) Abromson. Ada and her husband John retired to Phoenix Arizona.\n\nI believe that Mary (Mrs Samuel) Skolnik was a close relative of Ada or John.\n\nAn Internet search that I just made for \"Abromson AZ US\" yielded no matches.\n\nBut a search for Ada and John's son Joel yielded the following:\n\nI J and Linda Abromson\n\n25 Fall Ln, Portland, ME 04103\n\n207-797-4438 I believe that Linda is on the Board of Directors of the Jewish Home for the Aged in in Portland, Maine -- which is now called \"Cedars Campus\"\n\nhttp://www.thecedarscampus.com/ppf.html I mention this because the records of Cedars could possibly be a great source of info for people researching Jewish families in Maine.\n\nFor example, I believe that a cousin from Auburn, Nochum Widrowitz (who was called Kop-Af-Kop) and possibly his wife Reyze (\"Reize-Nochum's\"), retired to this Home for the Aged.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n******* Zalman Alpert *******\n\nZalman is librarian @ Yeshiva University's Mendel Gottesman Library. Zalman has published scholarly articles on Lubavitch history -- in the English section of the ALGEMEINER Journal. Zalman's father was born in Kurenitz, and Zalman is an expert on Kurenitz. He's from New Haven, Connecticut -- a city where many Jews from Vileyka, Kurenits, and Krasne area settled.

She was childless and became greatly attached to the family's children- Noah-Mairem and Rivkah.\n\nIn 1941, when all the Jews of the town of Krasne were put in the ghetto, the lady's apartment was annexed to the ghetto area. She obviously received a \"compensation\" for her apartment-the house of a Jew by the name of Yudel Monin- one of the wealthiest men in town, his house was located outside of the area of the (designated for the Jewish) ghetto and was seized from him. Knowing that he was well off you can understand that the house was quite big, and it was split to two. The second half was given to a different non Jewish resident who lived there with his family and children.\n\nWhen Kierczowa moved out to her new and enlarged home, she offered to take Rivka, the Brudners' young daughter to reside and remain with her. The family knew that the girl would be much safer there than in the ghetto.\n\nAs it was done in many houses in the ghetto, the new Jewish inhabitants of the Brudners' house [many families lived in the small numbers of homes that were designated as the ghetto] worked hard to secretly build a hiding place, \"malina\". This hide out was to be used at times when the Germans would come to the ghetto in order to randomly catch some Jews and slaughter them. Kierczowa's apartment was given to Shmuel Dovrovsky, a Jewish dental technician. This man worked for the German local officers. To allow him to complete his job for them, his apartment was connected to and electric supply. This fact was well exploited by the Jews who were not allowed to have outside contacts. A radio that was put in the hiding place [Jews were not permitted to own radios] was secretly connected to electricity and in this way, all who knew of the secret would gather at night hours in order to listen and be informed of the current situation in the front.\n\nOn March of 1943, the day of the massacre of the Krasne ghetto, the Germans discovered the radio on which Kierczowa's name was written. They took the trouble to find her. Being a German \"folksdeutsch\" she managed to quickly seem innocent in the eyes of the Germans. Her one problem was the Jewish girl, Rivka, whom she secretly kept in her house all that time. In 1944 the area was freed by the Soviet Union. When I came back from the war at the middle of August 1944, the town was still under a Soviet military rule. The military authorities appointed me as head of the local council (something similar to a mayor of a town council). This lasted for maybe two or three weeks. After that a local Soviet board was put up, composed of unknown outsiders as it was always done in the Soviet State.\n\nOne day, a local citizen who was required to serve in the army came to see me. He asked me to write him down as essential person who is needed here in the rear so that the military authorities would release him of the service. And this was his story: \"I was Kierczowa's neighbor and I helped her hide a Jewish girl who was in her house when the Germans came knocking on her door to question her about the radio. Therefor now, you as a Jew, are obliged to save me from a sure death at the front. I, a father of four, how can you refuse to spare my wife and children?\"\n\nI told him to find the girl and bring her to me, and then we would talk the matter over. I had no clue of who and what he was talking about. Two weeks passed and in the midst of a bright day, the man reported to me with a little girl, frightened and starved. She was dirty, her clothes were torn, and she was crying and lacking the ability to speak.\n\nIt appeared that after Kierczowa \"solved\" the radio problem she had to get rid of the Jewish girl whom was in her custody. A woman from one of the villages was willing in return for payment, to take the girl under her care. The woman quickly kept the payment and left the girl outdoors on her own. The girl started wandering from village to village, working as a shepherdess. She dwelled with the farm animals, eating leftovers that were given to her and her life was constantly in danger being at the hands of every passerby who could recognize her and report her as a Jew to the Germans.\n\nFrom that point I became her keeper. Being 19, without a family this was not a simple task for me.\n\nAt that time, a Jewish family who survived the war came to live in the town and received housing in the old house of Alter-the Jewish blacksmith. The family consisted of a mother, her three young children and the mother's sister. It was one of the only houses that survived the fire that the Germans set at their retreat. The financial state of Fina and Sonia Averbuch (the two sisters) was quite bad while mine was by then fairly good, perhaps very good. I was appointed as a manager of seven local factories spread out in the area, which produced turpentine, heavy oils and wooden charcoals as a by-product.\n\nThe sisters took upon themselves to take care of Rivka. The task was not easy, it took some time until she calmed down, started talking and coming back to herself. I had no problem supporting the six mouths while at that time the war was still going on not far from us.\n\nWith the liberation of Vilna, a school and dormitory was opened. The studies were held in Yiddish and Russian. I signed Rivka up and continued in watching out for her up until the authorities decided to close down the school. Rivka was then taken back to the sisters' home in Krasne. When I decided to come to Israel I of course took Rivka with me.\n\nWhen I arrived in Israel, I came to know that my grandfather, Shimon Sklut [My mothers' father], was the brother of her grandmother, her mother's mother. We also found more relatives- Azriel and Taibel Goldin from Krasne, her sons Hirshel and Noah and her daughter Chiyna. Likewise, we found her father's brother Noah Brudner, his wife Maraisha of the Kaplan family from Olshany and their sons- Reuven and Benjamin Brudner. Luckily they all fled to Russia at the beginning of the war and managed to escape the Germans. When the war ended they were sent away to Poland as they were former Polish citizens and from there came to Israel.\n\nRivka is today happily married, a mother of two- a son and a daughter, and a proud grandmother to their children.\n\n.\n\n- Tuesday, June 24, 2003 at 08:43:14 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Shevach fmily from Krasne originated in Piesk.\n\nThere is; Piesk and Most, a Memorial Book\n\n(Belarus) Piesk (Peski and Piaski)\n\n53°21' / 24°38'\n\nThe Little Shtetl Piesk /Chaim Shevach (Argentina )http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/Piaski/pie407.html\n\n475 The Shevach Dynasty by Eizer Shevach [Shewach]\n\nTraining of the Lutzk Group by Khonon Shevach [Shewach]\n\nStart of Organizations in Piesk by Natan Shevach [Shewach]\n\nFrom Piesk List of perished; Shewach Aizik son of Abrahamek and family\n\nShewach Baskeh daughter of Yosed and family\n\nShewach Berl Keila and family; Bashka and family; Bentcheh and family\n\nShewach Berl son of Yosed and family\n\nShewach B'Vandeh daughter of Yosed and family\n\nShewach Eliazer wife Mery; son David and wife Berteh (nee Yitzakovitz) and children; Moshe and wife (nee Yitzakovitz) and children; niece Keila and family\n\nShewach Ester husband Shimon Dubovski; son Yakob\n\nShewach Ester daughter of Abramak and family\n\nShewach Gershon and family\n\nShewach Keila husband Mikal and children\n\nShewach Leizer Aharon wife Mery; son David and family; son Masha and family; daughter Keila and family;\n\nShewach Mendel wife Chaiya-Sarah and children\n\nShewach Moshe Gershon and family; son Mendel; wife Chaiya-Sarah and children; Shimon \"The Pirer\"; daughter Leah and family\n\nShewach Moshe Reuben wife Malka; son Zeidl\n\nShewach Ruvin wife and children\n\nShewach Shmuel-father and wife; daughter Bobl; daughter Leitcheh\n\nShewach Yidl son Zeidl and wife Chana and children; daughter Etkeh and husband Akiba\n\nShewach see Motl Leib pictures;\n\nR' Yehuda Shebach\n\nDavid, son of Leizer Shebach\n\n402 Keila, daughter of Leizer Shebach\n\n411 Dora Shebach with a friend\n\nFounders of Zionist Movement in Piesk Seated left to right: 2.

They met and after they were both done with their army service [in 1950] they came to Israel via France. He died about four years ago in Rishon Letzion. The rest of the family perished in Dolhinov..\n\n4. Sheina nee Ginsburg Lifshitz moved to Sau Paulo, Brazil before the war. She had a daughter; Dvora. Dvora kept in touch with Yakov Kaplan but he did not hear from her in the last few years.\n\n5. Chana Chaya [born in Dolhinov in 1888] nee Ginsburg married Abba Kaplan [born in Dolhinov in 1886] in 1903. They had; Zipora born in 1912 in Dolhinov she mde Aliya to Israel before the war and lived in Kibbutz Afek. Miryam was born in 1917, Yaakov in 1922, Shlomo in 1924, Dvora in 1925, Bela in 1929 and Ytka in 1936. The family moved to a place near Krasne and all other then Yaakov *and Zipora perished there on March 17, 1943.\n\n6. Shalom Shachna Ginsburg joined his daughter [Alsha Chorgin] in Detroit in the early 1920s. Yakov Kaplan met his cousin Alasha in 1971 while he was sent by Israel to the U.S and he was received very graciously and felt very close to her. She was much older then him [ maybe 90 years old] She had four children [three sons and a daughter]\n\n*Yaakov Kaplan was born in 1922, in the townlet of Dolhinow, his parents moved to Krasne in his youth. The family owned an estate, which was used by the Zionist youth movements to train their member in agriculture in preparation for settlement in Palestine. As the son of Zionist parents, he was educated in the \"Tarbut\" school system, and he hoped to continue his higher education, but the German - Polish War destroyed his plans. With the\n\ndivision of Poland between Germany and the USSR, overnight he found himself under Russian rule, and with a high school education, he was appointed as a supervisor of construction, a post he had almost until the German - Russian War in 1941. In May, 1941, he was recruited into the Red Army, and stationed with the Engineering Battalion #981, in the Armored Force of General\n\nLelushenko, located in the Daugavpils (Dvinsk) area of Latvia, where he was given an accelerated military training course. Military Service\n\nOn June 26, 1941, immediately after Germany attacked the USSR, he engaged in his first bloody battle against the German conqueror near Daugavpils, and from this point there began the terrible, hasty, disorganized Russian retreat that resulted in horrible losses of manpower and equipment. Every Russian attempt to cease the retreat and half the enemy was quickly shattered, and at\n\na great price. They were forced to abandon Valeika - Luki, Ostshkov,\n\nTurupetz, and Salizrov, one after another, and when they were in Satriya - Russa, the Germans encircled them, leaving a few weak and hungry survivors. Realizing that as a Jew, his situation was even more precarious, he succeeded despite the danger, to sever his connection with his group, and to escape encirclement. He reached the Belgoya area on the main highway from Moscow to\n\nLeningrad. In September, 1941, all those who originated from the western territories that had been annexed by the Russians in 1939, and whose loyalty was suspect were transferred eastward, and there they were assigned to labor - battalions. Yaakov belonged to Battalion 394, and so he was joined to military operation 183. He was appointed head of the communications apparatus on one of the factories that was evacuated from Kharkov, and was engaged in\n\nthe manufacture of was equipment. When Yaakov learned of the formation of a military force of Polish expatriates, though still vague, and the murder of Jews by Germans in the areas vanquished by them, he decided to leave his job, which was far from the front, and he and a group of other Jews traveled to Tashkent, determined to enlist and fight against the Germans, the murderers\n\nof their brothers. They saw no justification for avoidance of danger and remaining in a secure place; their conscience demanded that they volunteer and enlist for army service. They arrived at Jambol in Kazakhstan, where they enlisted, and Yaakov was sent to Riazin for officers training school. In December, 1943, he became an officer and was dispatched with a group, the First Polish Parachutist Battalion, where they were subordinate to the partisan movement headquarters - \"The Ludova Army.\", and in a short time he was appointed Company Commander. In August, 1944, while still in Valamus,\n\nYaakov began dispatching to the rear of the German Front, crews of\n\nparachutists that were trained under him, and they carried out very bold sabotage actions. With the front advancing, they came to Rowne, whence Yaakov, with the approval of headquarters, sent crews of parachutists on very dangerous missions, in which he personally participated. These crews succeeded in eliminating German units, suddenly appearing at their rear in surprise attacks, causing confusion and departing. Their purpose was to arouse insecurity in the hearts of the Germans and to annihilate them. After\n\nthe liberation of Warsaw, Yaakov continued in the framework of the First Army of the Polish People's Army, as a Company Commander - his participation on the battle front, and especially in the Sandomierz area, ceased at the German Border, because it was decided to transfer his company to bat! tle the national Ukrainians, who collaborated with the Germans in the liquidation of the\n\nghettos. It was in their destruction, that Yaakov saw an act of revenge for the spilling of his brothers' blood, and he completed his service in the Polish Army as a Deputy Head of the \"Officers' Training School.\" Courtesy of:\n\nSimon Wiesenthal Center\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90035\n\nI will write about the Kaplan side of the family [also originated in Dolhinov] later.

Porat\n\n1941; The Soviets left Volozhyn in haste. The Germans entered the town without any resistance. The first sign of the Germans in the area was the unit of parachutists that descended near our home. Armed forces entered the town shortly after. The constant air bombing set the town on fire.\n\nWe were immediately forced to participate in various hard labor chores. The principal forced labor sites were the Polak's & Rapoport-Perelman's saw-mills. The women cleaned the Gestapo lodgments. We walked to work in groups. As soon as we would arrive they would start thrashing us with whips. We were ordered to put yellow patches on our sleeves. With time it changed to a yellow Star of David with the word Jude in the middle. We were forbidden to use the sidewalk. We had to walk in the middle of the road like horses. They ordered us to move into a designated Ghetto area. Shortly after enclosing the Volozhyn Jews in the Ghetto the Germans pushed inside its fence also the Jews of Olshan with their town-Rabbi. The congestion became unbearable. We were very deficient in nourishments. Bringing food inside the Ghetto was difficult and dangerous. From time to time the bandits harassed the ghetto inhabitants. They encroached into our lodgment and beat us mercilessly demanding money and valuables. On October 28ththe Gestapo ordered us to assemble on the Ghetto Street. All the inhabitants were forced to come. They chose some 200 people and enclosed them into the cinema local. Leading them on the walk to the cinema area was Yani Garber, the Judenrat Head. He was told that they are all taken to work. However they were all led by groups of ten to the adjacent sport square and shot to death. Zviya Lunin was among the conveyed to die, but she survived. The Nazis let her free. The quota, as they said, was completed. This time the German accuracy saved a Jewish life (not for long). After that First Action the ghetto area was reduced. Shneur Kivelevitsh was elected as the Judenrat Head.\n\nMany months passed and then some tormenting news reached the ghetto. The Germans geared up for a new slaughter. Rivka Dratvitski's husband, a gentile, who was friendly with the Jews, brought the information. Thanks to him many people were saved. Sunday, May 10th, 1942, at five in the morning Shneur Kivelevitsh appeared in our home and told us that the ghetto is surrounded. He advised every one to hide. The Germans enclosed the ghetto and meticulously looked for the Jews. They killed on the spot those who were found and refused to expose friends or relatives hiding places. My brother Yehuda, Osher (Itshe Bers) Perski, his son Ruvke and I, decided to run away. We passed the Volozhynka stream near the bridge and concealed ourselves in a grove. Some local Christians chased us. We could hear them saying that they are looking for us.\n\nWhen they left, I walked to Horodok; Osher Perski with his son to went to Zabrezhe. The Jews I met in the Horodok Ghetto were in a very agitated spirit. They just heard about the recent mass slaughter in Volozhyn.\n\nAfter the second Action the Volozhyn authorities reduced the ghetto area and enclosed inside the remaining little group of Jews. They assured them that the rest would work and be safe. I believed this false promise and returned home. I worked with some Jewish girls, among them Miriam Kagan and Rachel from Mejeyk, in a carpenter's team. Our manager was Yezierski. Once, as we were ready to return to the ghetto, we realized that the Germans were surrounding the ghetto, and some Jews were running out of the gate. We threw away the yellow patches and looked for a place to hide. The Germans shot at us and killed ten girls. Miryam Kagan and I hid in a wheat field. At night we went in the Mejeyk direction. After a lot of wandering we arrived in the Kaldiki hamlet. We knocked at a peasant's door and implored him to give us some nourishment. We were swollen from hunger. Despite the fact that they were poor they shared their food with us. We walked through the hamlet and deciding that we have nothing to lose. We knocked at a door of another remote house. A peasant opened the door, led us into the adjacent barn and locked the door. After a couple of frightful hours the landlord opened the barn and invited us to his house. It was a single room house with two big beds, a broken table and an oven. Here lived the Righteous Gentile Ivan Kovalski with his family: wife, three daughters and two sons. This poor family received us cheerfully and with unusual warmth. They cried with tears seeing our wretched appearance. After we warmed our frozen bodies and had a hot meal, they equipped us with blankets and led us back to the barn.\n\nIt happened at Saturday evening, November 14th1942. On Sunday morning we were served with a breakfast. We left some food to take away, being sure that Kovalski will expel us. At noon he came in and seeing the food remnants he asked us Why?. We answered: We are sure that you would not hide Jewish girls much longer. You are endangering the life of your entire family. For that reason we decided to go our way. Kovalski, offended by our answer, said:  Dear girls, my family and I, we decided to let you live with us. Your fate is our fate, our home is your home.\n\nIt was a very cold winter. We froze in the barn. Kovalski, the good soul, invited us in his house to conceal us upon the oven. It was a not aired, a very hot place. Kovalski used to lead us every day for a couple of hours into the potatoes cellar to breath some air. The children cooperated with their parents, and at danger, they warned us with agreed signs. One day German soldiers encircled the Krazhina hamlet, some 500 meters from us. They assembled all the hamlet inhabitants, spilled kerosene, set fire and burned all of them. They did it as revenge. Some partisans killed Germans soldiers, and took their retreat through Krazhina. Kovalski was conscious of the danger that awaited him and us. But he did not abandon us, on the contrary, as a good softhearted father he calmed and encouraged us. However I had a premonition that we are in danger staying at this house. Partisans were very active in the near by area. Fights and shootings broke from time to time. The Kovalskis asked and begged us to stay. But we decided to go. Kovalski made some journeys in the surrounding communities looking for traces of the Partisans.\n\nHe found a troop of Partisans and brought us to them. They were hostile, suspecting us as agents of the German intelligence services. They arranged a quick trial and convicted us to death. Before the execution hour approached a Krazhina partisan asked us who we were and from where we came. When I told him my name, he informed me that my brother Yehuda Yosef Potashnik is serving as a partisan near by. The Krazhina partisan told his commander that I am a well-known partisan's sister and he tore the paper with the verdict. I was transferred with Mariyasha Kagan to Baksht. There were many active partisan units in the area. My brother Yehuda Yosef took me to the Lidayev partisan unit, in the Nalibok forest. After some days the Germans surrounded the entire area. We hid in pits and other hiding places. When they left we concentrated in an outlying corner of the Nalibok forests. We established there a winter camp in which we lived until the Volozhyn liberation. After the liberation we returned to Volozhyn. I went to see Kovalski. The relations between us tightened. He visited us every day. His son and daughter worked in town and dwelled in my house. In 1945 I left Volozhyn to Poland. In 1947 I made Aliya. All that time I wrote letters to Kovalski but I had no answers. In 1966 I received his address. Kovalski with his family lived in Ural. Without delay I sent him a vestments package. He confirmed with joy its reception and sent his thanks. Since then we correspond and I send him and his family members presents, thanking this noble man for saving my life.\n\n.\n\n- Friday, June 20, 2003 at 18:57:37 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ Bronia (Breine) nee Kur Rabinovitz Story\n\nBreine is the daughter of Rivka, daughter of Alexander Volozhinski from Volozhin (Rivkas mother Mtya was from the Bunimovitz family of Volozhin). Breines father was Mordechai Kur whos father was a well-respected scribe (writer of Torah books) in Vileyka; (Koor). Rabbi yakov Landu ZL ABD bnai Brak wrote about Yehoshua Kur in the yizkor book for kurenets;  Amongst the shoemakers I must tell about Moshe Kur the Shoemaker from Dolhinov Street. He was a spiritual Jew and would read with excitement from the Torah. He was also a Kadainov Hasid. His father was Reb Yeoshua, the writer from Vileyka. The son of Moshe, Shlomo Chaim studied Torah in our minyan, and when he arrived at the age where he would be taken to the army, he escaped and went to London. His last name was Koor and from what I heard he became a Hazan in one of the synagogues in London, where he later passed away * The parents of Breine came from very respected religious families and a matchmaker arranged their marriage as the custom of Jews in 1900. The relatives from the groom side said that Rivka did not come to the marriage with the appropriate dowry but she had other qualities to compensate for it. The oldest boy; Avraham was born in 1910, Eliezer was born in\n\nHe was Tamid Chacham a Yeshiva Bachur. A distant cousin; Arie Shevach remembers that there was a time when Eliezer had to serve in the Polish army c 1937. He was station near Krasne and the rabbi of Krasne ordered the family to prepare Kosher food for Eliezer and he would deliver it to Eliezer everyday. Arie was about 12 years old and was getting ready for his Bar Mitzva and Eliezer helped him with some of his studies.\n\nBreine attended the TARBUT school in Horodok. All the subjects [other the mandatory class in the Polish language] were instructed in HEBREW. Breine also attended the tuition free Polish public school for a few years. .\n\nAfter the Soviets took control of the area in September of 1939 and instituted a communist rule in the area Breine.'s oldest sister; Leyka, who owned a coffee store in Horodok knew that she would be classified unfavorably as capitalist so she moved to Vileyka. Vileyka, one of the region's main towns, became an important place for the Soviet municipal authorities and She worked for them.\n\nWhen the German invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941 The Soviet officers and official evacuated the area and crossed by trains the old border (the pre 1939 Poland/ Soviet union border) . Some of them insisted that Breine's sister, along with other Jews in the town who worked for the Soviets, left with them because they knew what the impending German invasion would mean for them. (in some cases the Soviet officials actually pushed Jews they encountered around town onto departing trains without leaving them a moment to return to their homes and families. One Jewish woman, Dora Rabinovitz told me that that she came to Vileyka to work that day wearing a light summer dress and, by chance, carrying a picture of her family in her pocket. She was pushed onto a train and sent to the cold of Russia for more then two years and was the only member of her family to survive E. D)\n\nBreine.'s brother Eliezer was studying in a yeshiva in Poland. In 1939, when the area was given to the Soviets the whole yeshiva received illegally acquired papers from the Japanese ambassador, or assistant to the Japanese ambassador in Lithuania. With these papers, the residents of the yeshiva were allowed to immigrate to China before the German invasion. In China, Breine.'s brother contacted their other brother back in the area of Horodok who subsequently traveled all the way to China so as to bring him back to Poland, where he would later perish in German hands. (He might have never left for China, his brother might have taken him from Lithuania back to Horodok the Soviets would never let anyone without papers go all the way to China and back the papers were very very hard to obtain)\n\nDuring the German occupation Breine and her family first went to a former Christian neighbor and asked him to hide them. However, because they had previously given him their possessions for safe keeping, he was loathe to the idea of saving those who may later ask for his newly acquired, albeit on loan, goods. So, when they asked to be let in, he threatened to kill them\n\n.\n\nBreine and the rest of the family escaped the killing in Horodok and came to the krasne ghetto. Most of the Jews in the krasne ghetto came from towns that were already annihilated. Every time before they annihilated a community, they chose a few Jews who could be useful and transferred them to Krasne. The place was chosen as a supply base for the Germans, where materiel was relayed to and from the front, including a large amount of weapons captured from the Soviets. Thousands of Jews worked in construction, in loading and unloading goods, and in other logistical support positions. Since the ghetto could not contain thousands of workers, the Germans established a labor camp, and they continuously brought Jews from neighboring towns after each action. As in other ghettoes and camps, there was a Jewish committee or Judenrat. At the head of the Krasne Judenrat was Shabtai Oryuk. During the First World War he had been a POW in Germany for a few years and learned to speak German fluently.\n\nShaptai Olyuk and the brothers of the Kaplan house, Yitzhak and Moshe.\n\n. Breine and her family believed that working for the Germans will save them. She worked with other Jewish women and children to lay new train tracks. German soldiers routinely routed out and murdered Jews who were weaker or more feeble than the rest. The food given daily to the Jews who worked for the Germans consisted of one piece of bread with marmalade, and on occasion, a soup made from discarded potato peals. Often, the garbage of non-Jews was served to the Jews as food. Once, B. saw the German soldiers throw a live dog into the soup they were serving and then forced the Jews who had witnessed the event to eat the soup. At another time, a Jewish child returned to ask for an extra helping of soup. Instead of granting his request, the German soldiers put the child into the boiling soup. On one occasion, she spotted some moldy bread in the garbage and treasuring it, picked it out of the trash, eating a little and saving the rest for her family. Some German soldiers saw her and abused her for taking the bread.\n\nThere was one Jew from Horodak who would tell the Germans which Jews were wealthy, in hopes of being spared by the soldiers. Nevertheless, the German soldiers later killed him Breine and her family thought that the Germans needed them as workers so they worked very hard because they thought it would be their ticket to survive. At one point they realized that they should go into hiding in a hidden ditch they had dug for that purpose. Many Jews resorted to living in ditches to escape the Germans. The ditches varied in size - some holding five, others ten, and still others, up to twenty people. Often ditches were designated for different age, and gender groups. While they were in hiding in the ditch and fearful of the German soldiers they knew were near, one of the young girls (about 10 years old) in the ditch with B. and her family started crying for water. A man in the ditch started choking her to silence her. B. Prevented him from killing the girl by pushing him away and placing her hands over the girl's mouth. The young girl is now a doctor in the U.S..\n\nThey had large amounts of gold and while hiding out in the ditch, they decided that the best thing to do would be to offer the wealth to the Germans in return for a promise of security. B was on her way to deliver the gold and solicit such a promise when Zemitre, a Christian from the village, came to her and challenged the logic of her mission. He said, \"Are you crazy? Why are you going back to them? They're killing everyone.\" He then took Breine to his barn and hid her in the area used for storing hay, where she remained for a week.\n\nBreine's family didn't know what had happened to her after she left the ditch. Although everyone left the ditch while Breine was still missing, her family, because they were worried about her whereabouts returned to look for her. Tragically, her family was killed upon their return while the rest of the people who had left the ditch survived.\n\nA neighbor of the Christian who had saved Breine had also taken the risk of hiding a fugitive Jew. When the other neighbors found out they attacked and killed him, and burnt down his house. After this incident, Breine's host was afraid and forced her to leave. For a time she hid where she could, moving from place to place, and eating what she could find, including grass and garbage.\n\nOne farmer who was out searching for eggs in his yard discovered Breine in hiding. He immediately knew who she must be. Terrified, she told him that she knew the location of a large quantity of gold and promised to lead him to it, should he chose to spare her from the Germans. The farmer told her to that he did not need her gold, he will help her but she must wait where she was and left since this occurred shortly after they sloutherred the Jews of Krasne many of the Jewish bodies were left in different areas were they were killed and the Germans were worried that disease would spread yet they did not want to touch the remains and all their Jewish slave workers were killed by them they ordered the local population to get rid of the budies and the man was ordered to do it. B. was certain that he had gone to fetch German soldiers. However, after ten minutes the farmer's wife appeared and offered B. a bowl of soup and a spoon. B. hadn't eaten in a long time, and ravished with hunger, drank the soup straight from the bowl. The farmer's wife cried to seeing her desperate condition.\n\nBreine stayed with the farmer and his wife, living exclusively in their barn for one week. She remained in hiding in the barn because there were many Germans in the area. She was never allowed in the house. Later, they made her a nanny to their children, although she continued to sleep in the barn. Most of the neighbors were never aware of her because of the lengths that B. and the family went to in keeping her presence a secret.\n\nThrough rumors that had spread among the non-Jewish farming residents of the area, Isaac Noll, a Jewish member of the partisans, found out that there was a Jewish girl surviving alone in the area. (B. remarks that it was amazing that the residents had not yet turned her in). Isaac asked them where they could find her and they told her Maruska Kamarouski had her staying with him.\n\nThe partisans Months before the German troops began slaughtering the Jews in KRASNE, many young Jewish men realized what was about to transpire and escaped deep into the surrounding forest where they joined forces with partisan groups already established by Soviets, and especially former Soviet prisoners of war who had been treated as badly as the Jews under the Germans. Together, they began ambushing and killing German soldiers. Much of the local population was afraid of the partisans because the partisans made it clear that anyone found collaborating with the Germans would be killed.\n\nWhen B. initially tried to join the partisans they would not accept her because she came empty handed. However, a younger first cousin of hers (his father was the brother of Breine's mother), Mayer Vol (previously known as Volojinski) ambushed a German and stole his weapon, which he then gave to B. so that she would be accepted in by the partisans. Now this cousin lives in Windsor, Canada.\n\nBreine. returned armed to the partisans, who let her in, and Breine became a member of the Atriad Staritsky. This group of partisans hid out in the forest between the towns of Baranovic and Volozhin, remaining closer to latter. Breine stayed in the forest for one and half years. After staying for awhile with the partisans she came to understand that the Germans were losing the war because, for the first time, she had access to radio broadcasting, and in 1944 they began seeing Allied planes fly overhead.\n\nBreine didn't fight with the partisans, but facilitated their goals in other ways, tending to the livestock and helping out with the cooking. After the war she received medals for her participation in the resistance, but hadn't killed anyone and so felt as though she didn't deserve them.\n\nBreine felt that Jews and Soviets alike were treated equally within the partisan ranks and generally, got along well. She does recall one instance, however, when a Jew by the name of Fole Parovsky went to town to find food with two Soviets, and never returned. The two Soviets claimed he had been killed by German soldiers. However, one partisan by the name of Jaunsh didn't believe their story and started investigating only to find that the Soviets had killed Fole. The partisans had a trial and found one of the Soviets guilty. He was subsequently killed. Breine can only speculate on his motivation, but believes it may have been anti-Semitism. However, this was a rare case.\n\nIn the evenings, the partisans would make communal fires and sit around and sing together. They would sing so loudly and happily that Breine would be afraid that the German soldiers would find them. However, her cousin Isaac reassured her that they were too scared of the partisans to come to the forest that was controlled by the Russian partisans.\n\nOnce the partisans caught a German soldier. This particular German soldier was a special target of their anger because he carried with him numerous photographs of Jews he had killed, (They used to send the pictures to Germany) They ordered everyone to watch while they killed him. Breine covered her face, refusing to watch. However, her cousin chided her, telling her she was crazy to feel any sympathy to Germans who mercilessly killed so many Jews.\n\nThere was a woman named Yokha Rubenshik from Minsk who was a partisan member. When the Germans packed the Jews into train cars to be killed, she and her siblings where among those on the train. Yokha, realizing what their fate must be, pushed her younger brother out of the train. He eventually survived the war and became a dentist. She survived because she worked for the Germans and then escaped. Later, she joined the partisans and was sent by them back to Minsk where she recruited twelve more Jews. Together, this fugitive band removed their stars of David and escaped. However, while they were escaping a German soldier came by. Yokha approached him and spoke to him Russian, knowing that he would recognize her Yiddish accent if she spoke in German. She acted very self-assured and invited the German to eat with her. She emphasized that she had ham to eat and told him to meet her at a particular place and time later that evening. Meanwhile, the other Jews escaped.\n\nTowards the end of the war, when the Germans were clearly losing, a boy from Minsk named Moshe managed to round up thirty Germans who thought they were surrendering and would be made POWs.\n\nWhen the commanders told the partisans that the area was free of German troops, forty Jewish partisans decided to re-enter the city of Volozhin, the closest town. Upon returning they found that many homes and been burnt down and destroyed. Also, this town, previously famous for its large Jewish population had been repopulated by Christians. When the Christians saw that Jews were returning they began to weep and were afraid. However, the group of forty Jews were still scared to disband and live separately, and so they re-occupied only three houses in the town. Because there were so few Jews that had survived the war, this group of survivors became like family to one another.\n\nIt was while staying in this house that Breine met her husband to be. He had spent the war as a soldier in the Red Army in Russia, although he was originally from Breine's hometown of Horodok. As soon as he heard that his home region had been freed by the Red Army, he boarded a train and returned. When he had left for Russia he left behind a wife and two children, who were to perish in the Holocaust. His first wife's name was Blumke, she was a beautiful woman (one of her brothers survived the war and lives iin Israel). Because of her beauty, the Germans wanted to take her to work for them and send her children to be killed, but she insisted on accompanying her children. Everyone knew this story about Blumke and her children and so were able to tell her husband what had happened when they eventually met up with him upon his return.\n\nBreine's future husband returned to find Christians living in his old house. As soon as they saw him, one of the Christians went to look for an axe with which to kill him. Understanding what they were about to do, Breine's future husband jumped out of a window in the house and went for the Soviet police. After this incident, he was too afraid to ask any Christians about what had happened to his family, and couldn't find any Jews in the town. However, he did eventually learn that there were a few Jews living in Volozhin.\n\nWhen he arrived in Volozhin and met Bronia, he immediately asked her to marry him. Since Bronia had come from a religious family she had never looked at another man before him. After getting married they stayed in Volozhin for one year and began selling things from a horse and carriage. Breine's first son was born there. However, like all the other Jews living in Volozhin, Bronia and her husband wanted to leave.\n\nAll of a sudden, Breine's sister who had traveled on a train to Siberia before the German invasion, returned. Her sister had written a letter to a Christian neighbor named Yokobovsky inquiring about her family. Breine happened to return to Horodok with her husband to visit and was given the letter. She responded to her sister's letter from Kemarov, Siberia, writing that the rest of the family had died, but not to grieve because she was still alive. Upon getting the letter, her sister fainted and was taken to the hospital where she spent two months. After recovering, she returned to Volozhin with a Jewish man she had met in Siberia, and lived with Breine. and her husband.\n\nShortly after they arrived in Volozhin they decided to leave for Germany. From Germany they believed they would be able to travel to other countries. They had terrible associations with the town of Volozhin and the surrounding area and couldn't wait to leave. However, when they arrived in Germany they found themselves marooned in refugee camps for a year and a half, which, compared to other fellow refugees, was a short time. As refugees, however, they were allowed to stay in real homes and apartments, which had previously been inhabited by members of the SS.\n\nPart of the problem was that no country wanted to accept them. Although they received free food and goods from the U.S., they were barred from emigrating there. B.'s husband said he didn't want to go to the U.S. anyway and preferred instead to move to Israel where he felt there would be more of an assurance that what had happened to them in Poland would not reoccur.\n\nEventually they were able to travel on a ship named the Queen Anna Maria to Israel. In Israel they lived first in a refugee camp named Binyamina in very difficult\n\nconditions in tents. Later, they settled in Brandeis in Israel\n\nI received emails form other members of the family; Dear Eilat\n\nWonderful to hear Breines story\n\nMy grandfather - Shlomo Hayim, son of Moshe and cousin of Breine had family both in England and in Russia\n\nShlomo Hayim had 4 children\n\nMarie - married name Coleman - Stephen's mother\n\nHenry- my father\n\nHanna - married name Mather\n\nLily/Leah- married name Broza\n\nI moved to Israel from England about 25 years ago.

I have an elder brother Shlomo who lives in Petach Tikva near Tel Aviv and a younger brother Jonathan who lives with my mother in Netanya. My parents came to Israel in 1983 to retire. My father passed away in 1988.\n\nDanny Koor\n\nEilat\n\nMy cousin Danny Koor has been in contact with you, and has sent me all the details he has received from you so far.\n\nWe share the same grandfather Shlomo Chayim, or Solomon Koor as he was known in England.

Later rabbi of Drazin 1843-1861, Prozan 1861- 1867were he showed heroic dedication during a deadly epidemic, Lomza.1867-1879 were he was able to reduce by 500 a year the number of people called for army service. Was Chief Rabbi of Lodz from 1873 until his death in Lodz. He greatly cared about the social- economical predicament of his people. When the Jewish factory workers in lodge were replaced by none Jews he financed his on factory and hired only Jews He had a plan to establish an agricultural ranch to train Jews for immigrating to Israel [influenced by Rabbi Shmuel Maholiver] but it was met by opposition.\n\nDuring his time no poor Jewish kids were kidnapped in the area to serve in the Russian army. He helped other communities with money to release people. He build an orphanage, old home, Jewish hospital,\n\nAnd Talmud Torah schools. He helped thousands of Jews who came for many communities to receive his help.he would pawned all his possessions to help others. Despite of the fact that he often came to the non Jewish authorities with requests he was liked and respected by them. he worked diligently until the age of ninety. Many great tales were told about his greatness. And when he passed away many mornd him as if they became orphaned. A Yiddish book was written about him in 1925, For 15 years since his death [title memoir with his name in Yiddish].\n\nFrom the internet;\n\nRav Eliyahu Chaim Meisels, the Rav of Lodz, would raise money for the poor widows and orphans of his city. During one particularly freezing winter, he went to visit one of the prominent members of his community, Reb Isaac, a banker who served as the president of the community council.\n\nBundled in a coat and scarf, the Rabbi approached the banker's mansion and knocked on the door.\n\nThe valet who answered the door was shocked to see the great Rabbi Meisels standing outside in the bitter cold. He immediately asked him to enter the home where he said there would be a hot tea waiting.\n\nRabbi Meisels refused. \"It is not necessary. Please tell Reb Isaac to see me by the door.\"\n\nThe banker heard that the Rav was waiting near the portal and rushed in his evening jacket to greet him. Upon seeing the Rabbi standing in the frigid weather, he exclaimed. \"Rebbe, please step inside. I have the fireplace raging, and my butler will prepare a hot tea for you! There is no need for you to wait outside!\"\n\n\"That's alright,\" countered Reb Eliyahu Chaim. \"It won't be long, and all I need could be accomplished by talking right here. I'm sure you won't mind. Anyway, why should I dirty your home with my snow-covered boots?\"\n\nBy this time, Reb Isaac was in a dilemma. The frigid air was blowing into his house. He did not want to close the door and talk outside in the cold, and yet the Rabbi did not want to enter!\n\n\"Please, Rabbi, I don't know about you, but I am freezing,\" cried the banker. \"I don't mind if your boots are wet! Just come on in!\"\n\nBut the Rabbi did not budge, He began talking about the plight of some the unfortunate members of the community as the bankers teeth chattered in response.\n\n\"Please, Rebbe, just tell me what you need! I'll give anything you want, just come inside!\n\nWith that, Reb Elya Chaim relented. He entered the man's home and followed him to the den, where a blazing fire heated the room. Then he began: \"I need firewood for 50 families this winter.\" The banker smiled. No problem, I commit to supplying the wood. Just one question. You know I give tzedoka, so why did you make me stand outside?\n\n\"Reb Isaac,\" smiled Reb Eliyahu Chaim. \"I know you give, but I wanted to make sure you understood what these poor people are going through. I knew that five minutes in the freezing cold would give you a different perspective than my initial asking while basking in the warmth of your fireplace.\"\n\nThe Chasam Sofer explains that because Levi was a special tribe of teachers and leaders it could be possible they would be aloof. Thus, though they were counted separately, they could not be above the crowd. "
