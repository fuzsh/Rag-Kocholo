    "text": "Bethel, N. Y., Sullivan co. The Mongoup and several other small tributaries of the Delaware flow through this town, which also contains several small lakes. The surface is hilly; the soil gravelly loam. 121 miles S. S. W. from Albany.\n\nDirect link to this section\n\nBETHEL was formed from Lumberland, March 27, 1809. Cochecton was taken off in 1828. It lies upon the high ridges which form the watershed between Delaware and Mongaup rivers, a little south-west of the center of the County. Its surface is broken and hilly, and many of the declivities are steep and rocky. It is drained easterly by the West Branch of the Mongaup and several smaller streams which are tributary to that river, and westerly by the Callicoon Creek and a branch of the Ten Mile Creek. The Mongaup forms its eastern boundary. Its surface is dotted by many small lakes, which form a beautiful and romantic feature of the landscape. White Lake,On page 67, in the 1st Vol. of the Poems of Alfred B. Street, this lake is noticed by the name of “Kau-na-ong-ga,” which, he say”, means literally “two wings,” because “it is in the form of a pair of huge wings expanded.” James B. Quinlan, however, asserts on the authority of Street, that this definition is merely the result of the latter’s poetic fancy. We make the following extract from the poem on this lake, which appears in the same work:\n\n“Pure as their parent springs I how bright\n\nThe silvery waters stretch away,\n\nReposing in the pleasant light\n\nOf June’s most lovely day.\n\n“Curving round the the eastern side.\n\nRich meadows slope their banks, to meet,\n\nWith fringe of grass and fern, the tide\n\nWhich sparkles at their feet.\n\n* * * * *\n\n“The ploughman sees the wind-winged deer\n\nDart from his covert to the wave,\n\nAnd fearless in its mirror clear\n\nHie branching antlers lave.\n\n“Here, the green headlands seem to meet\n\nSo near, a fairy bridge might cross;\n\nThere, spreads the broad and limpid sheet\n\nIn smooth, unruffled gloss.\n\n“Arched by the thicket’s screening leaves,\n\nA lilied harbor lurks below,\n\nWhere on the sand each ripple weaves\n\nIts melting wreath of snow.”\n\nRev. J. B. Williams, pastor of the Reformed Presbyterian Church at White Lake, furnishes the following interesting particulars respecting this lake and the surrounding country, which we copy verbatim:\n\n“WHITE LAKE AND ITS SURROUNDINGS.\n\n“This is the deepest lake in Sullivan County. By actual measurement, James E. Munger found the northern end 80 feet deep, and the narrows 70 feet. Formerly the lake contained the largest trout in the world. These trout had carmine spots, which is unusual for lake trout, (Salmo Confinis.) In the winter of 1832. Charles Fenno Hoffman, an author whom none will dispute, saw a trout taken from White Lake which weighed six pounds. In Feb’y 1848, Lewis Piatt caught one which weighed eight pounds fourteen oz. A sketch of this fish was drawn on a board at the old Lake House. It was the same year that James B. Finlay employed an Indian to take black bass from Lake George and put them in White Lake, from which they have been distributed to other lakes and ponds.\n\n“AS A SUMMER RESORT.\n\n“The old Lake House stood upon the ground now occupied by Harold Henwood for a private residence. It was built for the accommodation of travelers and was occasionally a place of resort for those who wished to spend a few days in fishing and bunting fifty years ago. In the year 1846, Mr. Finlay built the first hotel for summer boarders. It was kept by Simon M. Jordan, George B. Wooldridge, Stephen Sweet and others. The business did not pay until the Mansion House was built by a club of wealthy New Yorkers, who made an arrangement by which D. B. Kinne became proprietor, afterwards.\n\n“In the year 1866 the Grove Hotel was erected and occupied by George Wooldridge. Two years later, Capt. Wm. Waddell constructed ‘Sunny Glade’ Boarding House. In none of these houses is kept any bar for the sale of intoxicating drinks, as the design is to accommodate the better class of boarders. Since the opening of greater facilities of access to the metropolis by newly constructed Railroads, it is sometimes difficult to accommodate the increasing number of summer visitors.\n\n“COTTAGES AND PRIVATE RESIDENCES.\n\n“Napoleon Wooldridge, of the Detective Police, N. Y., has just finished a beautiful cottage on the southern shore of the lake, and his example is about to be followed by some of his friends. Rev. Mr. Williams has also completed a hooded building accommodated to the scenery on the side of the lake. Newcomb Mapes, in his humble way, has just completed a snug home for his family. Time and space would fail to tell of Mercer and Munger and Corley and Potts and Gregory and Vanorden, who. like the philosopher, have sought a place to put down a lever and ‘move the world, and have obtained their design by securing a home for their families.\n\n“ATTRACTIVE SCENERY.\n\n“The supposed name of this beautiful body of water is ‘Konaonga.’ Frequented no doubt it was by the Indians, for the purpose of fishing, and possibly, at some remote period, the blood of battle may have crimsoned its surface, as the number of darts found at its northern extremity would seem to indicate. But the trail of the red man of the forest has faded from the memory of living men in the vicinity, yet the natural loveliness of the place occupies in more cultured society the pen of the poet and the pencil of the artist.\n\n“Mount Wilder rises south of the lake with gentle declivity, and recedes from the shore about 800 feet, where it reaches a point of more than sixteen hundred feet above tide water on the Hudson. If a magnificent view is sought for, this eminence will suit the purpose.\n\n“Slumbering beneath, lies the lake, fed by internal springs and not by rivulets. Its waters wash a shore of pebbly white sand, and when the rhododendrons blossom, at the end of June, the whole winding confines look like enchantment. Let the surface be dotted with boats in gay colors, and a view is presented in summer months which one never tires of seeing. Away to the north you see sloping farms, framed in groves of natural beauty, up to the very summit of Mount Sherwpod, as it looms up into the serene heavens. A spur of the Catskills makes a show back of Shandaken hills. Then on the right, ‘the smoky range of the Shawangunk’ is lost in the glades and forests of the Neversink. As the eye sweeps the distant scenery, it detects an almost unbroken chain of mountains lying around the whole circle of the horizon, including undefined summits back of Port Jervis, and also the Susquehanna range in Pennsylvania.\n\n“There is not the bold configuration of Newburgh Bay and the richly laden vessels of commerce, nor the island which Headley calls ‘a child of adjacent hills,’ but there is more of the repose which attracts mostly those who relish retirement from the active scenes of busy life.\n\n“To crown all, there is an atmosphere as pure as any on the face of the globe. The bottom of the lake is rock and sand, and the surface lying so high, no miasmatic qualities will ever infect the air. The region is that of hemlock, pine and balsam, exhaling life-giving qualities; but here the locust never lives. Physicians frequently send here invalids to recover health. Instances almost incredible might be, furnished of restoration. So those who wish to combine rare scenery and health fulness, find a sojourn here during the warm summer months eminently desirable.” near the center, named from its white sandy shores and bottom, is noted for the beauty of its scenery, and is becoming a favorite summer resort Several large boarding houses have been erected on its banks for the accommodation of visitors.\n\nThe other principal lakes are Birch Ridge Pond in the north-west, Horse Shoe and Pleasant Ponds in the north, Mallory Pond in the west, Indian Field Pond in the south, Big and Wells Ponds on the south line, and Chestnut Ridge Pond, Black Lake and Lake Superior near the center. The soil is a sandy and gravelly loam, intermixed in places with clay, and resting on slate. It is of a pretty good quality and is well adapted to grazing. The settlements are comparatively new, and the people are chiefly engaged in stock raising, dairying, lumbering and tanning, the latter being the principal business. Large quantities of butter and beef are annually sent to market. There are at present in the town three Presbyterian and two Methodist churches, three tanneries, three flouring mills, fourteen saw mills and nine stores.\n\nThe town has an area of 53,472 acres, of which, according to the census of 1865, 17,406 were improved and 36,066, unimproved.\n\nThe population of the town in 1870 was 2,736. During the year ending Sept. 30, 1871, the town contained fifteen school districts and employed fifteen teachers. The number of children of school age was 1,157; the number attending school, 892; the average attendance, 368; and the value or school houses and sites, $3,911. The schools of this town will compare favorably with those of any other in the County.\n\nMongaup Valley, (p. v.) situated on the Mongaup River, and Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike, near the center of the east line of the town, is a flourishing village and contains two churches, (Associate Reformed Presbyterian and M. E.,) two stores, one hotel, one large tannery,This tannery, of which W. Kiersted & Co. are proprietors, is situated on the Mongaup River, by which stream its motive power is furnished, and is admitted to be the model tannery in the County. Perhaps it would not be extravagant to say this of it in respect to the whole country, for its internal arrangement and the various processes employed in the manufacture, are characterized by such neatness, fitness and convenience as is consistent with the business, and in striking contrast with most establishments of the kind. So marked are these features in this establishment that we deem it worthy of especial notice, and we have, through the courtesy of the gentlemanly proprietors, been permitted to inspect critically the departments of their works, and have been furnished by them with statistics, which are descriptive, not only of the manufacture of leather in general, but of this tannery in particular. This was the first tannery erected in the town. On the 8th of August, 1847, Wynkoop and John Kiersted entered into a contract with John C., Richard M., J. Howard, Margaret M., Maria L., Cornelia R. and Robert L. Tillotson, securing to them the hemlock bark on a tract of land of about ten thousand acres, known as the Tillotson Tract, it being Great Lot 15 of the Hardenburgh Patent, which contract with its renewal embraces a term of thirty years. In 1848, Wyokoop and John Kiersted, and John W. Swan, who compose the firm of W. Kiersted & Co., erected this -the Mongaup Tannery; the main building being 410 feet long and 40 feet wide. The lower story embraces the Beam House and Yard. The Beam House contains four sets of Hide Mills, for softening and cleansing bides; nine large vats for soaking hides; and eight underground rooms -16 feet long, 8 feet wide and 13 feet high -built with stone and covered with a heavy body of earth to keep them of even temperature. In these the hides, after being cleansed and softened, are suspended on hooks until putrefaction advances far enough to loosen the hair, when they are taken out and cleansed in the Hide Mills, after which they are worked over the Beam -a process which consists of shaving off the loose flesh and any remaining hair: they are then passed into the handlers, which contain thirty-two vats. 8 feet long, 4½ feet wide add 5 feet deep, in which they are colored and plumped, and from which they are passed into the yard, which contains 168 lay away vats, 8 feet long, 7 feet wide and 5 feet deep, where they are packed away with bark sprinkled between them and submerged with tan liquor. This operation is repeated every two to four weeks until the hides are tanned, which requires from four to five months. When tanned, the sides of leather are passed through the scrubbing machine, (which consists of a rapidly revolving cylinder, containing brushes, over which water is kept running,) and cleansed from all fifth. They are next passed into the second story, where they are suspended on sticks until dry, when they are sprinkled with water, and, after becoming sufficiently softened, are passed under a brass roller, subjected to heavy pressure, until they become firmly set and highly polished, after which they are passed to the third story, where they are again dried, and are then ready for market. The Leach House is 160 feet long. In it the bark is ground by one of the celebrated Palen & Avery Bark Mills. From the mill the ground bark is raised by means of elevators into a loft, from which it is run into the leaches. The Leach House contains five circular leaches, sixteen feet in diameter, and six and one-half feet deep, which are filled with ground bark and hot weak liquor, or water passed thereon by means of Allen & Warren’s Rotating Sprinklers, the water being heated by steam in a box through which it passes on its way to the sprinklers. The Steam House is fifty by thirty feet, and contains a ten horse power steam engine, and three thirty-two feet, thirty inch boilers, and the same number of eight feet, thirty-inch boilers for generating steam for leaching the bark. The Bark House is 400 feet long and 22 feet wide. Permanent employment is given to fifty men, and during the bark peeling season about ninety additional laborers are employed. About fifty teams are employed in hauling during the winter. Connected with the establishment are fifteen double dwellings for the accommodation of the families of the workmen. From the time the Tannery commenced operations, in Oct., 1848, up to Jan. 1, 1872, there has been manufactured here into hemlock sole leather 444,932 hides, weighing 10,044,566 pounds, costing $1,966,662.60, making therefrom 889,864 sides of leather, weighing 14,975,127 pounds, and selling for $3,334,169.36. There was consumed in the manufacture 99,856¼ cords of bark, which cost $327,562.87; and the cost of labor during this period was $272,754.42. one grist mill, one saw mill, three blacksmith shops, one shoe shop, one wagon shop, one harness shop, an excellent high school, and about 300 inhabitants.\n\nBethel, (p. v.) located a little west of the center, on the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike, contains three stores, one hotel, one wagon shop, three blacksmith shops, two shoe shops, a tin shop, and about thirty dwellings and 150 inhabitants.\n\nBushville, (p. v.) situated on the Mongaup River, in the north-east part, contains one store, one tannery,The first tannery on the site of this one was built in 1851, by A. P. Bush & Co. It was burned in 1863, and rebuilt by E. Fobes. It was burned again in 1867, and was again rebuilt by E. Fobes, who continued its proprietor until 1871, when it passed into the hands of the present proprietors, David Clements and Lucas Fobes. The present tannery is situated on the west side of the Mongaup, and with it is connected a saw mill and store. The main building is 300 feet long and 40 feet wide. The leach house is 133 feet long and 24 feet wide. The engine house is 80 feet long and 24 feet wide. The leach house contains four leaches, one junk and 128 vats. An engine of twenty horse power is used; 2,300 cords of bark are annually consumed; and 20,000 sides are tanned. one blacksmith shop, one saw mill, seventeen dwellings and about eighty inhabitants.\n\nWhite Lake (p. o.) is situated at the south-east extremity of the lake from which it derives its name, on the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike, and contains one church, (Reformed Presbyterian) one store, one school house, five boarding houses, twelve dwellings and sixty-seven inhabitants. The location of White Lake, in the midst of a region of great natural beauty, constitutes it a place of unusual attractiveness to the seekers of pleasure and recreation. It is distant only eight miles from Monticello, the County Seat, and the northern terminus of the Monticello & Port Jervis R. R., and possesses advantages unattainable in any other direction, within similar distance from New York.\n\nThe White Lake Mansion House is located at the south-west extremity of the lake whose name it bears, and is attracting that attention from those who seek a short respite from the tedium of sedentary pursuits and an opportunity to inhale generous supplies of pure country air, to which its merit entitles it North White Lake is a hamlet, beautifully situated at the foot of the lake which gives it its name, one mile north of White Lake. It contains one hotel, one store, one grist mill, one saw mill, a blacksmith shop, a wagon shop, a school house, ten dwellings and forty inhabitants.\n\nThe grist mill at this place stands on the sight of the first grist mill built in the town.The first mill was erected in 1806, by John K. Beckman, and was used for the manufecture of flour and linen thread. The machinery for making thread was captured by the British during the war of 1812. Its original cost was $28,000. Mr. Beekman also built the first saw mill in the town at this place. It is the third one that has been erected thereon. It has three runs of stones, the motor for which is supplied by a thirty feet fall of water, which is considered one of the best and safest water powers in the State. It has a grinding capacity of 75,000 bushels of grain annually. The saw mill at this place has facilities for sawing 300,000 feet of lumber annually. The motive power for this is also furnished by a thirty feet fall of water.\n\nHarold Henwood, a gentleman residing in Jersey City, has made large purchases of lands around this (White) lake, which he is improving and beautifying.\n\nBlack Lake is a hamlet situated at the outlet of the lake of the same name, two miles south of White Lake, and contains one store, one tannery, one saw mill, one blacksmith shop, one shoe shop, one school house, fifteen dwellings and a population of 120.\n\nBriscoe, (p. o.) located near the north line, west of the center, on the Monticello and Jeffersonville Turnpike, is thirteen and one-half miles from the former place, and three and one-half miles from the latter, and contains one hotel, one saw mill, a blacksmith shop, a school house, seven dwellings and forty-eight inhabitants.\n\nThe Briscoe Saw Mill is located on a small stream tributary to Callicoon Creek, from which its motive power is supplied by an eleven feet fall of water. The mill has a circular saw and is capable of sawing 7,000 feet of lumber per day. It was built in 1851, by Otis Segar, who sold it in 1869 to his son.\n\nStevensvllle (p. o.) is on the north line, in the town of Liberty; for description see that town.\n\nThe settlement of this town seems to have commenced subsequent to the Revolutionary war. As early as 1798, John, George and Peter, the three sons of Adam Pintler, an old man then living in Deckertown, New Jersey, came into this town by the way of Carpenters Point, thence following up the Delaware and Mongaup rivers and Black Lake Brook, by a line of marked trees made by hunters and trappers, who in those early times, visited the lakes and ponds in the vicinity for the purpose of trapping and hunting. The three young Pintlers located on a tract of land lying west of White Lake, not knowing to whom it belonged, or that it belonged to any one, and commenced making improvements thereon by clearing the land and putting in crops. They returned when their work was done, and the two. following years came to gather their harvest and make further improvements. At that time the country between Mamakating Hollow (now Wurtsboro) and west to the Delaware River was an almost unbroken wilderness, the nearest settlement east being twenty-one miles distant. In 1800 a road was opened through this desert from Mamakating to Cochecton, passing through Bethel, on the south side of White Lake. This road, when opened, could be traveled by no carriage better than an ox sled, and by such conveyance the early settlers had to migrate to their western homes, and to carry their grain to the mill at Bloomingburgh to be ground, a distance of twenty-five miles. The same year the Pintlers built a log house on their farm, and moved their father and family to their new home. In 1804, John K. Beekman of New York City, who owned Great Lot 16 of the Hardenburgh Patent, sent his agent, William Peck, to make improvements on his property at the outlet of White Lake. Peck built a saw mill, and then one or two dwelling houses and a grist mill. At this time the Pintlers learned that they were living on Beekman’s land, which they bought and paid for.\n\nGeorge and Peter are yet living and own and occupy the same farm.French, in his Gazetteer of the State of New York, on page 643, says that “Adam and five Pentler” settled “near Bethel.” Our informant, from whom we have obtained much of the information given in regard to the early settlement of the town, is Wm. Gillespie, Surveyor and Conveyancer, who has been a resident of the town for sixty years and has held several town and county offices; who was County Superintendent of the Poor, Member of Assembly, and Loan Commissioner; who has been a Justice of the Peace about twenty-five years, in which capacity, also that of Loan Commissioner, he is now acting, and is sixty-nine years old.\n\nIn the same year Graham Hurd moved into the town from Connecticut and settled in what has since been known as the Hurd Settlement; and while preparing for and building a house, his family lived in a room or cave in the rocks, which is still known as the Rock Cabin. At or about the same time, Chauncey Hurd settled a short distance south of Graham. Abijah Mitchell, who came in 1804, was killed by the fall of a tree, and is supposed to be the first man buried in the Bethel Cemetery. In 1805 James Fulton bought a tract of land in the north-east part of the town and moved his own and his son’s family on the tract, which is known as the Fulton Settlement. David Jackson came from the town of Woodbury, Litchfield Co., Conn., and located in the Hurd Settlement, on the farm now owned by Hugh Townsley, in 1805. His son, Isaac, came in the previous year and cleared about three acres, which he sowed to rye, so that his father would have something to eat on his arrival. David Jackson Jr., son of David Jackson above referred to, is now living in Cochecton. From 1805 to 1810 additional settlements were made in different parts of the town by Elias Sandford, Stephen Northrup,Stephen Northrup, who is supposed to he the oldest person now living in the County, was horn in Sept., 1780, and came to Bethel from Salisbury, Conn., in May, 1807, with an ox team, having to ford the Neversink. After searching for a favorable place to locate, he returned, and on the way met Zalmon Hawley, a friend of his, who was then moving with his family, consisting of his wife and two children, to Bethel, and who induced him to go back with him. They met on the east side of the Neversink. The water in the river at that time was very high, and rendered it necessary to transfer the household goods to the west bank by means of a log canoe. The wagon was taken apart and conveyed across in the same manner, while the horses and cows swam across. The second day after they had crossed the Neversink, having crossed the West Branch of the Mongaup, they were overtaken by a heavy thunder storm, from which they protected the woman and children by means of blankets suspended on a pole, which was supported by two crotched stakes driven into the ground; but as this did not provide a shelter sufficiently large to protect all five, the men were obliged to stand in the rain. The following day they proceeded as far as a clearing on the Fulton Settlement, on which was erected a log cabin which was used by Fulton to sleep in while clearing his land. In this cabin they passed the night. The next day Northrup retraced bis steps eastward and returned in about three weeks with bis family. Joseph K. Northrup, son of Stephen, from whom this information was obtained, was born Oct, 14, 1807, and was the second male child born in the town. In December, 1807, Stephen moved his family on the place it now occupies. He was always a man of temperate habits. In 1816 he joined the Presbyterian Church, and for the last fifty years he has been a member of the Church at Liberty. When he first settled, the nearest post office was Kingston, Ulster Co. James Luckey, Joseph Pinkney, John Ramsay, William, Robert and James Frazer.\n\nIn 1810 the Newburgh & Cochecton Turnpike was finished, passing through the town on the south bank of White Lake. Settlements were soon made on and near this thoroughfare. Among those who thus settled may be mentioned the names of William Brown,Wm. Brown purchased land in the town, previous to its erection as such, on what he supposed would be the line of the Newburgh & Cochecton Turnpike, which was then contemplated; but when the road was constructed through the town the line was run about a mile north of his purchase. As the land was bought on speculation and under the supposition that the road would be built through its center, the location of the road a mile north of it rendered this project abortive. Samuel F. Jones of Monticello, who was acquainted with the design of Brown, resolved to profit by his mistake and forestall him by purchasing the land on either side of the road; he started to Albany via Newburgh, and thence by sloop for that purpose. Brown, on learning Jones’ intention, knowing it was impossible to overtake him by the route he had taken, adopted the expedient of proceeding to Albany on horseback, which his knowledge of surveying and hie ability to determine a route thither with the aid of the compass enabled him to do. Accordingly he started on horseback, with his compass under his arm, and arrived in Albany, transacted his business, and, on making his exit from the land office, met Jones, who had just arrived, but too late to accomplish his purpose. who kept the first hotel in the town, who was the first Town Clerk, which office he filled many years, and was also County Treasurer; John Cross, who kept the first store where Bethel village now is; John Lindsley, who was the first physician in the town, and who represented the County two terms in the State Legislature; William and David Stewart, John McClure, John and Thomas Potts, John Voorhis, Abner Hollister, Samuel S. Barkley, Henry H. Crist, Eleazer Everard, Thomas Lyon, Paul Horton, Nathan Smith, Isaac, Walter and John Knapp, Thaddeus and Norman Judson, Charles Dekay, Obediah Tibbet, Aaron Heuras, Michael Mudge and others, who either bought or leased land and improved the same. In 1811, William Gillespie bought land in the town, erected a store house at White Lake and commenced the mercantile business, and in the spring of 1812 moved his family from New York City to it. During his life he held various town and county offices; he died in 1849. In 1812 the grist mill at White Lake was rebuilt, and the following year Mr. Beekman put up machinery for spinning flax in its basement. The flax was shipped from New York City, and the thread returned there. The manufactory was under the supervision of Alexander Sterrat, and was continued until after the war was ended in 1815, when it was closed. In the south part of the town were extensive groves of white pine which have long since disappeared, having been converted into lumber and shipped to the Philadelphia market by the Delaware River. The hemlock forests are fast disappearing, owing to the increasing consumption of the tanneries. Thos. Stewart, from Washington Co., N. Y., came to this town in March, 1812, with his family and worldly effects, drawn by a yoke of oxen, and was that summer drafted into the army. He started to join his regiment on Long Island, but when he arrived at Bloomingburgh he hired a substitute and returned to his farm. His sons are Wm. I., now living at Monticello, and Thomas H. and Alex., who are now living in this town. Adam Pintler, son of John Pintler, was the first male child born in this town. He was born May 2, 1805. Eve Pintler, was born Oct 7, 1803, and was the first child born in the town. The first death in the town was that of a child of Stephen Northrup.\n\nThe following extracts are taken from the Town Records:\n\n“At the [first] annual Town Meeting held at the House of Wm. Brown in the Town of Bethel on the first Tuesday of March, 1810, the following persons were Duly elected, viz:\n\nJohn Conklin, Supervisor;\n\nWm. Brown, Town Clerk,\n\nCharles Irvine, John Lindsley and Wm.

It appears to us by the voluntary acknowledgement of said Hannah that at the time her services expired she was in perfect health and sound in all respects and to the Best of her knowledge and belief her age was not over thirty-six years and that she considers herself fully capable of maintaining herself and Child by Honest industry & we ourselves from her Testimony and other circumstances corroborating it are fully satisfied that her opinion is just and correct.\n\n“Dated at Bethel Aug. 26, 1823\n\nNorman Judson; Wm. Gillespie -Ovemere of the Poor.\n\nWe extract from the writings of J. Y. Morrison of Wurtsboro the description of the following incident:\n\n“There was a little boy ten or twelve years of age living with his parents, in 1806, at White Lake. He was sent one day with a little basket to carry dinner to some wood choppers about a mile distant. He took their dinner to them and started for home. On his way back he lost the footpath, and wandered on until the trees began to cast their long shadows eastward, and the sun to sink behind the western mountains. He thought he was near home, and knowing not what course to take he concluded to lay down on a bed of leaves and sleep till morning. In the morning he arose early and started again, as he supposed, homeward. He wandered all day, going through woods he had never seen before, crossing streams he had never before gazed upon, till the sun in its golden course in the heavens had declined in the western mountains. The little boy, hungry and tired, with his feet swollen, his clothes in tatters, and his body lacerated, lay down to sleep. His sleep was broken by the bleat of a deer and the fierce shriek of a catamount, but [hungry and fatigued he again lay down to sleep] and did not wake until the sun had risen and shone full upon him. He arose from his leafy couch, cold and hungry, and wandered on [during the] days and rested [during the] nights till ten long days and nights passed over him. On the eleventh day he was so weak, (his only food being a few berries,) and his feet so torn and swollen, that he could only crawl along on his hands and knees; yet he wandered on and something seemed to whisper to him, ‘Onward! James, Onward! ’ Onward he drew his feeble form; but he stopped -he listened -he heard a cow bell near him -he dragged himself near it and found it in a clearing. He grasped a sapling and raised his trembling form, racking with pain, to see if he could get a sight of a dwelling. He discovered a footpath. The cattle made slowly towards it, and he followed them, dragging his weary body along. Old Mrs. Lair, residing in Callicoon, discovered something near her house, and hastened to see it. She discovered James Glass, the poor lost boy, and took him in her arms and carried him into her dwelling. She laid him on the bed, dressed his wounds, and administered carefully a little nourishment. He fainted away, but recovered, and soon slept in a disturbed slumber. In his dreams he called for his uncle and his mother. He mentioned their names, and as the morning dawned, the old hunters that gathered around, hastened to carry the news of his recovery to White Lake. Eight long days had his friends at White Lake sought for him in vain. They gave up all hopes of his recovery, supposing the wild beasts had made him their [prey.] The old hunters flew with the news, and as the noble hearted pioneers saw them coming they gathered round to hear the welcome news. ‘The lost boy is found.’ There was joy in the dwelling. James, though he lived to be an old man, never recovered.”\n\nThe following incident is also extracted from the same writings:\n\n“Not far south of White Lake is a swamp called ‘Smedes.’ In olden times it was quite a resort for bears, and they occasionally wintered in it. Along the edge of the swamp were berries, nuts, &c., on which they fed. The swamp was filled with heavy timber and thick groves of deer laurel. Panthers, wolves and deer used to frequent it. Uncle Tommy, as Thomas Horton of Bethel [was] called, had tried his hand quite successfully at trapping wolves, and one time thought he would try his luck at bear catching. He sat his trap near the edge of a stump, and caught a very large one. On discovering it he thought at first it was dead. He soon however saw it move its ears as the flies [lighted] upon them. Concluding that a dose of cold lead would stop its being annoyed by the gnats he administered it with his trusty rifle. It paid no attention to the medicine, and so he thought he would bleed it. Jumping astraddle of its back, he drew his keen edged hunting knife across its jugular, severing [it] at a stroke. This brought life into the bear. Raising upon its hind legs, bruin grabbed Uncle Tommy in rather too affectionate a manner, and he got out of its embrace as soon as possible. It soon fell over, tearing the ground in its death struggles.”\n\nThough the settlement of this town is of too recent date to develope any considerable historical data pertaining to the wars in which the country was involved prior to the war of the Rebellion, the record of the participation of its citizens in that memorable struggle is one to which she may point with just pride.
