They were pursued by Captain Pedro Fages and his troops. Some of the defectors escaped but others were captured. bb Pedro Fages led an expedition along the edge of the western Mojave along the northern foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains looking for deserters from the Spanish Army 1776 ~ \"Spanish Explorers\" came through southern Nevada\n\n\n\nFirst Caucasian crossing of desert: Fr.

(Mojave Indian history, the Spanish/Mexican period) 1812 The entire area was rocked with repeated earthquakes resulting in an Indian uprising as they believed they were caused by the presence of the Padres.\n\n\n\nThe M6.9–7.5 San Juan Capistrano earthquake affected Alta California with a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong) to IX (Violent), killing 40 parishioners at Mission San Juan Capistrano.

Probably meeting illegal traders beyond the Cajon inspection point, Goodyear acquired and drove an estimated 4,000 animals over the Old Spanish Trail to Utah. Eventually, Goodyear drove his horses all the way to Missouri—over Old Santa Fe Trail—but found that the end of the Mexican War had released many horses onto the market, increasing the supply and depressing prices. In addition, the war and increased Indian hostilities held down immigration and demand for stock during 1847 and 1848. In 1849, Goodyear drives the herd of horses to Sutter’s Mill in California for trade to Gold Rush forty-niners.
