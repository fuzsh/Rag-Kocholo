    "text": "Death Records for the year Ending December 31, 1863\n\n\n\nAn Act passed by the New York Assembly and Senate, April 25, 1864 (Chapter 380) provided for \"The Registration of Deaths in the several Towns and Wards in the State.\" This task became the responsibility of the various assessors at the time of taking their annual assessments. The assessors were to survey every family in their districts, with \"each hotel, garrison, jail, prison, hospital, asylum, poor house, house of refuge, or similar institution regarded as a family.\" Forms completed by the assessors were submitted, first to the Town and County Clerks for recording and subsequently to the Secretary of State. Original transcripts for the Cayuga County Towns of Aurelius, Cato, Conquest, Mentz, Scipio, Sennett, Springport, and Sterling were recently discovered in the basement of the Cayuga County Courthouse and they are now in the possession of the Cayuga County Historian. This transcription was taken from both the Assessors' and the Clerks' records, and where discrepancies occur they are designated by a ( ).
