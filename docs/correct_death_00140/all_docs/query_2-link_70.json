The war officially began over a border dispute in what is now south Texas, but President James K. Polk had a larger goal in mind – the acquisition of Mexico’s northern territories of Alta California and Nuevo México. President Polk initially planned a limited war, but Mexico’s stubborn refusal to part with its northern territories led to a decision to invade and conquer Mexico City. Mexico lost 55% of its territory to the United States between 1836 and 1848. The U.S. Army won every major battle in the war, but it was unable to suppress guerrilla activity, which never ceased. This was the first U.S. counterinsurgency war in a foreign country. Mexicans civilians suffered from the U.S. occupation, whether from personal violence, extended anti-guerrilla operations, bombardment of cities, or the imposition of martial law. U.S. military forces remained in Mexico from May 1846 until July 1848. Of the 90,000 U.S. soldiers who served in Mexico, nearly 14,000 died, a death rate of 15.5% – the highest rate of any foreign war in U.S. history. Regarding the causes of death, one U.S. soldier in seven died in battle or from battle wounds; six in seven died from disease, accidents, or other causes. Among those who believed that the war was unnecessary and/or unjust were former president John Quincy Adams, future presidents Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant, former vice-president John C. Calhoun, and three-time presidential candidate Henry Clay. In April 1847, the Massachusetts legislature passed a resolution denouncing the war as “a gigantic crime” waged against a “weak neighbor” for the purposes of conquest, territorial aggrandizement, and the extension of slavery. On January 3, 1848, the House of Representatives passed a resolution stating that “the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the president.” In contrast to the antiwar movement, the All of Mexico movement that arose in 1847 wanted to annex all of Mexico to the United States. President Polk was inclined to seek more territory but not all of Mexico. The U.S. agent who negotiated the peace treaty, Nicholas Trist, had been recalled by the president, but he negotiated the treaty anyway. The president reluctantly accepted the treaty.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nThe United States and Mexico went to war in May 1846. Except for the first battles fought in a disputed border area, all of the fighting took place in Mexico. The United States invaded and occupied Mexico City. The war took the lives of at least 25,000 Mexicans and nearly 14,000 U.S. soldiers. The United States finally withdrew its forces in July 1848, after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed and ratified by both countries. Mexico reluctantly ceded 530,000 square miles of territory to the United States and gave up claims to disputed territory in Texas.\n\nMexicans then and now have viewed this war as unnecessary and unjust. In a ceremony in 2010 commemorating those who had sacrificed their lives in defense of their nation, Mexican President Felipe Calderon described the war as an “unjust military aggression motivated by clearly imperialistic interests.” In the United States, views on the war have been more contested, but a significant proportion of American leaders, citizens, and historians, past and present, have viewed it as unnecessary and unjust. In the words of one historian, “It was a war of choice, not of necessity, a war of aggression that expanded the size of the United States by nearly one quarter and reduced that of Mexico by half.” [1]\n\nThroughout the war, as U.S. forces invaded and occupied northern Mexico then captured Mexico City, President James K. Polk maintained that the United States was fighting “a just war.” In his war message to Congress on May 11, 1846, he charged that Mexican forces had “invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil.” Given the “grievous wrongs perpetrated by Mexico,” said Polk, the United States had no choice but to fight for the “vindication of our rights and defense of our territory.”[2] Many prominent Americans at the time disagreed with the president. Among them were former president John Quincy Adams, future presidents Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant, former vice-president John C. Calhoun, and three-time presidential candidate Henry Clay.\n\nTwo weeks after the president presented his war message, John Quincy Adams delivered a speech in the House of Representatives in which he denounced “this most outrageous war,” charging that its real purpose was territorial aggrandizement and the expansion of slavery. Illinois congressman Abraham Lincoln, in his first major speech in the House on January 12, 1848, challenged the president’s claim that American blood had been shed on American soil, stating that the evidence fell “far short of proving his justification.” In his lawyerly fashion, Lincoln presented counter evidence showing that Mexico had a better claim to the disputed territory. The president himself, Lincoln added whimsically, was a “bewildered, confounded, and miserably perplexed man.”[3]\n\nLieutenant Ulysses S. Grant was 24 years old when the war broke out. Leaving his fiancé in Ohio, he served under generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott, participating in major battles in northern and central Mexico. Grant found no glory in war but rather mourned its waste and loss of life. Reflecting on his war experiences later in life, he told a journalist, “I do not think there was ever a more wicked war than that waged by the United States on Mexico.” He reiterated this judgment in his memoirs, describing the war “as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation. It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory.”[4]\n\nSenator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina was a Democrat and a slaveholder, like the president, but he, too, could not endorse the war. In Calhoun’s view, President Polk had usurped the constitutional powers of Congress by placing U.S. troops in the disputed territory and provoking hostilities. As he explained in a speech on January 4, 1848, “I opposed the war then [at the outset] not only because I considered it unnecessary, and that it might have been easily avoided; not only because I thought the President had no authority to order a portion of the territory in dispute and in possession of the Mexicans to be occupied by our troops . . . but from high considerations of reason and policy, because I believed it would lead to great and serious evils to the country, and greatly endanger its free institutions. [5]\n\nHenry Clay, leader of the Whig Party, was no longer the “war hawk” of 1812. He had honed his diplomatic skills as secretary of state under President John Quincy Adams and facilitated domestic political compromises as well. He believed that a compromise with Mexico could have been achieved had Polk negotiated “in a true spirit of amity and conciliation.” Speaking to a large gathering in Lexington, Kentucky on November 13, 1847, the elder statesman argued that the president had rejected this “pacific and moderate course” in favor of planting U.S. forces “in a warlike attitude” in the disputed territory. “This is no war of defense,” he declared, “but one unnecessary and of offensive aggression. It is Mexico that is defending her fire-sides, her castles and her altars, not we.”\n\nThe war was personally tragic for Clay, as his son, Henry Clay Jr., was killed in the Battle of Buena Vista in February 1847. Informed that his son had died fighting bravely, the grieving father confided to a friend, “That consolation would be greater if I did not believe that this Mexican War was unnecessary and of an aggressive character.” His son, he said, had not inquired as to “the causes of the War. It was sufficient for him that it existed in fact, and that he thought the Nation was entitled to his services.” [6]\n\nII. Origins of the U.S.-Mexican War\n\nThe origins of the U.S.-Mexican War fall into two categories. One derives from a dispute over the border of Texas. The other, from the Polk administration’s desire to acquire Mexico’s northern territories of Alta California and Nuevo México. President Polk did not want war per se. He initially hoped that Mexico would agree to American border claims and sell the desired territories to the United States. When Mexico refused, Polk provoked a war and took possession of the territories. According to the diplomatic historian George C. Herring: Polk and many of his countrymen were determined to have Texas to the Rio Grande and all of California on their own terms. . . . Polk appears not to have set out to provoke Mexico into what could be used as a war of conquest. Rather, contemptuous of his presumably inferior adversaries, he assumed he could bully them into giving him what he wanted. . . . Certain that an inferior people would be no match for Americans, he envisioned a war of three to four months. The United States would secure control of Mexico’s northern provinces and use them to force acceptance of the Rio Grande boundary and cession of California and New Mexico.[7]\n\nMexico’s troubles\n\nMexico achieved independence from Spain on August 24, 1821. The eleven-year war that led to independence cost the lives of over half a million Mexicans, including one out of every ten fighting-age men. About half the population of six million were indigenous peoples of various ethnicities, 30 to 40 percent were mestizos (a mixture of Spanish and Native American), and 10 to 20 percent were of Spanish extraction (mostly criollos, born in Mexico). The country remained impoverished and politically unstable for decades after independence. According to the Mexican Embassy, “During the next 30 years, Mexico had close to 50 governments, almost all as the result of military coups. Eleven of them were presided by one man, General Antonio López de Santa Anna.”[8] In 1824, Mexico adopted a constitution modeled in part on that of the United States, except Indians were deemed citizens with rights to vote and hold public office. Mexico effectively banned slavery through a series of laws in the 1820s, which in turn led to an infiltration of runaway slaves from the United States. By 1840, there were an estimated 6,000 Blacks in the country. A population census in 1842 indicated a total Mexican population of just over seven million, as compared to about eighteen million in the United States.\n\nThe vast stretches of land in the north inherited by Mexico from Spain were home to Comanches, Apaches, Kiowas, Navaho, Hois, Tenewas, Yamparikas, Pueblos, and other tribes. Mexico’s claim to the region did not negate the right of these indigenous groups to occupy their lands. Rather, the claim was meant to preclude colonization and exploitation by other European and EuroAmerican powers. Most of the indigenous peoples in the northern region were hostile to Spanish and Mexican incursions, although not necessarily to trade. The Mexicans labeled the hostile tribes indios bárbaros (barbarians), in contrast to the peaceful tribes that integrated into the Mexican system, such as the Pueblos.\n\nRaids by hostile tribes became more frequent in the 1830s and 1840s, in large part because the Mexican government could not afford to protect its northern provinces. Governors of the northern provinces issued desperate appeals to the central government, but to no avail. According to the historian Brian DeLay, native warriors “killed or captured several thousand northern Mexicans between 1831 and 1846.” They also plundered homes and stole valuable horses and livestock, effectively crippling the ranching and farming economies in the north. Mexican leaders attempted to pacify the Indians with an ambivalent mix of trade incentives, peace agreements, and revenge attacks. The revenge attacks, which included displaying “Comanche scalps, ears, hands, and heads in Mexican settlements as trophies,” increased the cycle of violence. [9]\n\nMexico was also troubled by foreign powers. In 1829, Spain attempted to re-conquer Mexico, attacking the port of Tampico with a force of 3,600 men. A Mexican army led by Antonio López de Santa Anna drove them off, after which Santa Anna became known as the “Hero of Tampico.” In 1838, the French navy blockaded, bombarded, and invaded the port of Veracruz, the object being to obtain financial compensation for the property losses of French citizens during various upheavals in Mexico. Santa Anna once again came to the rescue, winning a battle and losing his leg – which was buried with full military honors. The French navy nonetheless continued its blockade and Mexico was forced to pay the French 600,000 pesos. Similar claims against the Mexican government for property losses were made by the British and American governments acting on behalf of their citizens. The British government did not attempt to collect the debt, recognizing the impoverished state of the Mexican government, but the U.S. continued to hound Mexico. In February 1841 a joint U.S.-Mexican commission set a figure of $2 million to be awarded to U.S. citizens. The Mexican government made three payments then ran out of money. In 1846, President James K. Polk cited the unpaid balance as one reason to go to war against Mexico; and in 1847, he cited it as reason for Mexico to cede its northern provinces to the United States.\n\nMexico’s political instability grew worse in the 1830s. Santa Anna won the presidential election of 1833, but soon switched his allegiance from the liberals to the conservatives and established a caudillo (strongman) state. The Mexican Congress was dismissed and a new constitution was written in 1836 that centralized power in the federal government. (The constitution of 1824 had distributed governmental powers among nineteen semiautonomous states and five territories.) Santa Anna’s authoritarian moves sparked widespread protests and outright rebellion in the states of Coahuila y Tejas, Nuevo León, San Luis Potosí, Sonora, Tamaulipas, Yucatán, Zacatecas, and in the territories of Nuevo México and Alta California. Tejas separated from Coahuila to form its own Republic of Texas. General Santa Anna raised an army and defeated a large rebel force in Zacatecas in May 1835, but he was unable to suppress the rebellion in Texas.\n\nIn 1835, Texas was home to 30,000 Anglo immigrants and 8,000 Mexican Tejanos. The first Americans to settle in eastern Texas did so legally through an empressario land grant from the Spanish government in 1820, later honored by the Mexican government. Under the guidance of Stephen Austin, Anglo American immigrants obtained large parcels of land for a small price. They were supposed to become Mexican citizens and convert to Catholicism but very few did. A separatist Anglo rebellion erupted in late 1826 (the Fredonian Rebellion) but Austin and most other Anglos chose to aid the Mexican government in suppressing it. Fearing more such rebellions, Mexico passed a law in April 1830 that severely restricted further American immigration. Americans nonetheless kept coming – illegally. Many of these illegal immigrants, moreover, brought their black slaves with them, violating another Mexican law. To get around the letter of the law, they declared that their slaves were indentured servants. The Texan quest for independence, as such, was motivated by both a desire to be free from Mexican rule and a desire to establish and expand slavery in a land where it had been forbidden.\n\nThe Texan fight for independence began in October 1835 and lasted seven months. The rebel force consisted of Texas Rangers, with much experience fighting Indians, and American volunteers streaming into Texas, including the famous Tennessee congressman David Crocket. All of the latter acted in violation of the U.S. Neutrality Act of 1818, which forbade private military expeditions, but President Andrew Jackson ignored the law. The Texan rebels were defeated at the old Alamo mission near San Antonio on March 6, 1836, and again at Goliad on March 22, but rallied to defeat Santa Anna’s army at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21. The Mexican Army executed 342 prisoners-of-war at Goliad. Texans responded in kind at San Jacinto, “slaughtering hundreds of unresisting Mexican soldiers,” according to the historian William Weeks, although the deaths were officially reported as battle deaths (the tally was 650 Mexicans and 11 Texans killed).[10]\n\nSanta Anna himself was captured and forced to sign the Velasco “treaties” under threat of death. These “treaties” recognized Texas independence and pushed the border of Texas to the Rio Grande. The Mexican Congress refused to ratify the “treaties,” but Texans nonetheless held them as valid, including the preposterous border claim that extended far to the south and west of American settlements. The traditional border of Tejas, established by Spanish imperial authority in 1816, was the Nueces River, 150 miles to the north of the Rio Grande. Virtually no Americans resided in the land between the Nueces River and Rio Grande. The Mexican government, for its part, refused to accept Texas independence. As Mexican scholar Jesús Velasco-Márquez writes, “Mexico’s position was very similar to that adopted by the U.S. government when it faced the problem of the secession of its southern states years later. . . . From Mexico’s point of view, the annexation of Texas to the United States was inadmissible for both legal and security reasons.” [11]\n\nTexas and Mexico officially remained at war for most of the nine years that Texas existed as an independent republic. Rebels in the Mexican states of Coahuila, Tamaulipas, and Nuevo León found refuge in the independent Republic of Texas; and some Anglo Texans fought with the Mexican rebels, although “they often amounted to less than 10 percent of the total federalist [rebel] force,” according to DeLay. Texans furthermore raided towns and homesteads along the Rio Grande, prompting Mexican officers to label them “bandits and pirates.” [12] Texas thus constituted a serious security threat to Mexico. In June 1841, Texas President Mirabeau B. Lamar sent a combined military and trade expedition of 320 men to Nuevo México in an attempt to persuade or intimidate the territory’s leaders into joining the Republic of Texas. The Texans expected to be welcomed but instead were taken prisoner by Mexican forces (and released a year later). In September 1842, the Mexican government took the offensive and sent a force of 1,600 soldiers to briefly occupy San Antonio, located on the north side of the Nueces River. In December, some 260 Texans crossed the Rio Grande and attempted to take over the town of Mier, 180 miles upriver of Matamoros. Their efforts were thwarted by Mexican troops and most of the Americans were taken prisoner. Weary of fighting, and with encouragement from Great Britain, Texas President Sam Houston agreed to an armistice with Mexico in June 1843.\n\nU.S. annexation of Texas\n\nIn Washington, President Martin Van Buren (1837-1841) remained officially neutral during the low-level war between Texas and Mexico. Like his predecessor, Andrew Jackson, Van Buren rejected requests to annex Texas for a number of reasons. First, northern free states and especially abolitionists were opposed to it, evident in the fact that eight state legislatures passed resolutions and 600,000 citizens signed petitions against annexation. Secondly, the annexation of Texas could very well involve the U.S. in a war with Mexico, as Texas was still part of Mexican territory in the eyes of the Mexican government. Thirdly, annexation would surely involve the U.S. in the ongoing Indian wars in the region; and, fourthly, related to this, the U.S. Army had its hands full fighting Seminoles in Florida. Americans had expected a quick victory in Florida, but Seminole leader Osceola proved to be an elusive foe. The Second Seminole War lasted seven years, from 1835 to 1842, the longest in U.S. history up to that time, and cost the lives of some 1,600 U.S. troops and $40 million. It was one of the most unjust wars in U.S. history, being fought for the sole purpose of banishing Seminoles to reservations in the west and making room for white Americans and their slaves in Florida.\n\nPresident John Tyler (1841-1845) was more amenable to annexation than his predecessor. Tyler signed a treaty of annexation with Texas in April 1844, but the Senate refused to ratify it, thus leaving the issue hanging as the presidential election approached that fall. Van Buren was expected to be the Democratic Party nominee, but his opposition to the annexation of Texas led expansionists to push for the relatively unknown James K. Polk. Polk was a former Tennessee congressman, Speaker of the House (1835-39), and one-term governor, but he had lost the last two gubernatorial elections. With Andrew Jackson’s support, however, and a few rule manipulations, Polk became the nominee over front runner Van Buren.\n\nPolk ran on an expansionist platform designed to appeal to both southerners and northerners, respectively calling the “re-annexation” of Texas and the “re-occupation” of Oregon territory – misleading terms that implied existing American ownership. Polk did not mention California or New Mexico while on the campaign trail. Whig presidential candidate Henry Clay opposed the annexation of Texas without first settling the border dispute with Mexico. He voiced his opinion in a letter to the National Intelligencer on April 17, 1844: I certainly am not willing to involve this country in a foreign war for the object of acquiring Texas. I know there are those who regard such a war with indifference, and as a trifling affair, on account of the weakness of Mexico, and her inability to inflict serious injury upon this country. But I do not look upon it thus lightly. I regard all wars as great calamities, to be avoided, if possible, and honorable peace as the wisest and truest policy of this country. . . . Honor and good faith and justice are equally due from this country towards the weak as towards the strong . . . I consider the annexation of Texas, at this time, without the assent of Mexico, as a measure compromising the national character, involving us certainly in war with Mexico, probably with other foreign powers, dangerous to the integrity of the Union, inexpedient in the present financial condition of the country, and not called for by any general expression of public opinion.[13] Clay was expected to win the presidential election in November 1844, but Polk pulled an upset. Polk won a small plurality of the popular vote, 49.5%, as compared to Clay’s 48.1%, with Liberty Party candidate James G. Birney garnering 2.3%, including 15,800 votes in the state of New York. According to the historian Brian DeLay, “Had Clay won just 5,107 more votes in New York State from the nearly one million cast, he would have become president and there almost certainly would have been no annexation of Texas, no war with Mexico, no U.S. Civil War, and a vastly different continental story. But by the narrowest of margins Polk’s vision took the day.”[14] Polk’s electoral victory led to a new surge of expansionist fervor in the country. Sensing the time was right, outgoing President Tyler proposed to Congress that Texas be admitted as a state rather than a territory, thereby requiring majority approval in both houses of Congress rather than two-thirds of the Senate (the last attempt had failed). The strategy worked and Tyler signed an annexation bill on March 1, 1845, three days before Polk was inaugurated.\n\nMexico’s response to the annexation measure was to sever diplomatic relations with the United States. Mexican president José Joaquin de Herrera issued a proclamation on June 4, 1845, declaring that “annexation of Texas to the United States . . . attacks all the rights that Mexico has to that territory, is an insult to her dignity as a sovereign nation, and threatens her independence and political existence.” The proclamation decreed, “The Mexican nation calls upon all her children to the defense of her national independence.” This proclamation has sometimes been interpreted as a declaration of war against the U.S., but it was not. It was a call to arms in defense of the nation.[15] Herrera came to power in late 1844, replacing Santa Anna. At the time, he issued a manifesto declaring that Santa Anna had failed to prosecute the war against Texas. The U.S. annexation of Texas, however, dramatically changed the situation.\n\nHerrara knew it would be foolhardy to wage a war against the United States and thus he attempted to find a middle way between upholding national pride, which meant appearing bellicose, and finding an acceptable compromise. Washington was well aware of the situation. Its agents in Mexico – William Parrot, John Black, F. M. Dimond, and others – continually informed the Tyler and Polk administrations that the saber rattling public pronouncements of Mexican leaders were all show and that the leaders were in fact seeking an honorable way out of the impasse. In July 1845, Black reported that the Herrera administration was seeking a “substitute for war which in its opinion will save its honor,” and that Mexico had “nothing to gain and everything to lose” in a war against the United States.\n\nThat same month, Mexican General Mariano Arista reported to his superiors that his army in the north was bereft of essential provisions, indeed that his men had “almost taught themselves not to eat.” Hungry, poorly clad, and lacking mules, horses, and military equipment, desertions were depleting the Mexican ranks. In August, Dimond, the American consul in Veracruz, informed the Polk administration that the Mexican army on the northern frontier was in a “starving condition . . . a wretched state even for peace to say nothing of war.” To Polk, this was good news, as Mexico’s distress made it more likely that the government would accept the exaggerated boundaries of Texas and sell its northern territories to the United States; or failing that, Mexico’s military weakness would allow the U.S. to quickly gain the upper hand in a war. [16]\n\nPresident Polk’s expansionist strategy\n\nThe historian Amy S. Greenberg describes James K. Polk as a protégé of Andrew Jackson, a hardworking president, a devoted husband to his wife, Sarah, and a slaveholder who brought his slaves to the White House in 1845. He was ambitious, meticulous, secretive, and strategic, the latter being essential for realizing his expansionist goals in a complex diplomatic and political environment. Polk undertook two very different approaches toward Great Britain and Mexico. Toward Great Britain, he feigned war while pursuing a negotiated settlement on the division of the Oregon territory. Toward Mexico, he expressed peaceful intentions while actively preparing for war, his goals being not only to obtain the expansive border claims of Texas but also the Mexican territories of California and New Mexico. Although Polk said nothing about California on the campaign trail, he confided to his cabinet in the first days of his presidency that the acquisition of California was one of his main objectives. The territory had fertile lands, rich deposits of minerals, and fine harbors that would facilitate the expansion of trade across the Pacific Ocean.\n\nWith regard to the Oregon territory, Polk encouraged the saber-rattling rhetoric of “Fifty-four forty or fight!” (referring to the upper latitude of the jointly held Oregon territory) in order to pressure Great Britain to back down on its proposed dividing line of the Columbia River. Polk wanted the boundary further to the north and suggested to the British the 49th parallel, which was far below 54-40 latitude. According to William Weeks: He fomented Democrats from the Northwest such as Edward Hannegan of Indiana and William Allen of Ohio to demand all of Oregon, assuring them that he would never back down from the claim to 54-40 even though he planned all along to use their extreme claims to form the basis of a compromise at 49 degrees. . . . Here the president benefited from the demonstrated willingness of Americans to fight even when a lack of preparedness and plain common sense seemed to preclude that option, and indeed, the chest-thumping assertions of Hannegan, Allen, and others bore some resemblance to the War Hawks of 1812. Polk, unlike Madison, was not controlled by hotheads in Congress but rather used their threats to help extract a deal.[17]\n\nPolk concluded the Oregon deal in June 1846, two months after the U.S. went to war against Mexico. The Oregon Treaty established the border at the 49th parallel, with the British keeping Vancouver Island. Polk thus got what he wanted, even if his expansionist allies were disgruntled at the compromise. Polk’s militant posturing had pressured Great Britain to agree to a boundary line north of the Columbia River, but he knew that if he pushed too hard, Great Britain could ally itself with Mexico against the U.S., thus creating a formidable barrier to his plans for California.\n\nPolk’s strategy toward Mexico was just the opposite of his strategy toward Great Britain and Oregon. Instead of talking loudly and negotiating quietly, Polk talked softly and struck with force. Prior to the onset of war, Polk promised the American people that any expansion of the nation’s boundaries into Mexican territory would be undertaken “not as the conquest of a nation seeking to extend her dominions by arms and violence but as the peaceful acquisition of a territory once her own.” At the same time, he began preparing for war, sending U.S. forces into the disputed territory and reinforcing naval squadrons in the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific Ocean. How much force would be needed to convince the Mexican government to give up its northern territories could not be foretold. In November 1845, he sent emissary John Slidell to Mexico City, ostensibly to negotiate with the Mexican government but actuality to demand that Mexico accept the exaggerated border claims and sell Alta California and Nuevo México. As Weeks notes: If Polk bluffed war and sought peace with Great Britain, it was very much the reverse as concerns the Republic of Mexico. . . . First, he had to appear to try to resolve the differences with Mexico via negotiation. To that end, he dispatched John Slidell of Louisiana to Mexico City to negotiate the range of issues separating the states. In truth, Slidell went not to negotiate but to dictate. He demanded that Mexico drop its protests against the annexation of Texas, recognize its boundary at the Rio Grande del Norte, and agree to sell California ($25 million) and New Mexico ($3 million) to the United States. In exchange for these extravagant demands, the Polk administration stood ready to assume the nearly $2 million in Claims that American citizens held against the Mexican government for private property seized during the course of the numerous revolutions since 1821.[18]\n\nPolk began military maneuvers in July 1845. Without authorization from Congress, he directed General Zachary Taylor and 4,000 troops to advance to the south bank of the Nueces River, near Corpus Christi. Six months later, on January 13, 1846, before learning of the outcome of John Slidell’s mission in Mexico City, Polk ordered Taylor to proceed further to the Rio Grande, thus entering disputed territory. As Polk later wrote in his diary, he anticipated “a collision between the American and Mexican forces.”[19] Taylor’s troops set up camp on the north side of the Rio Grande, opposite the town of Matamoros, on March 28. They built a makeshift fort, aimed their artillery at the town, and blockaded the mouth of the river, denying food and supplies to 4,000 townspeople and 3,400 Mexican soldiers stationed there. Apart from entering into what Mexicans considered their territory, the blockade itself was an act of war. According to the historian Glenn Price:\n\nThe first indisputable act of war was an act of the United States, when its naval forces blockaded the Rio Grande on 12 April 1846. Even had the land on the left bank of that river been within the limits of the United States, to blockade the river, which in that case would have been the international boundary, was an act of war. That conclusion needs no supporting argument, but it may be of interest to point out that the United States government was on record as stating that any attempt by Mexico to close the river to American traffic would justify hostilities. Instructions given General Zachary Taylor by the Department of War stated that “the Rio Grande, in a state of peace, may be regarded as equally open to navigation of the U.S. & Mexico,” and should this “reciprocal right be resisted by Mexico,” Taylor was at liberty to force it open by military power.[20]\n\nOnset of war\n\nGeneral Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga replaced Herrara as president of Mexico in December 1845. He immediately found himself in the same dilemma as his predecessor, having no means of stopping the United States from moving into (disputed) Mexican territory while nonetheless being pressured by the public to uphold national honor and exert a valiant defense of the homeland. Paredes dismissed Slidell in March 1846, explaining to him that the presence of American troops on Mexican soil made negotiations impossible. Slidell also lacked proper credentials and had come with an additional agenda other than negotiating the border dispute. Paredes demanded that U.S. forces return to the north side of the Nueces River, but he nevertheless sought to reassure the U.S. of his intentions by issuing a manifesto declaring that he “would never commit a single aggression against the United States,” but only act in defense of Mexico.[21]\n\nOn April 23, with the American troops encamped opposite Matamoras and having blockaded the river, Paredes issued another manifesto, this time declaring that “from this day defensive war begins.” The following day, the Mexican commander at Matamoros, General Arista, informed Taylor that hostilities had commenced. On April 25, Mexican troops crossed the river and attacked a U.S. patrol unit, killing eleven men. Full-blown battles followed at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma on May 8 and 9, both of which U.S. forces won.\n\nLieutenant Ulysses S. Grant later recorded in his Personal Memoirs, “We were sent to provoke a fight, but it was essential that Mexico should commence it,” otherwise it “was very doubtful whether Congress would declare war.” Lieutenant Colonel Ethan Allen Hitchcock of Vermont, the grandson of Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen, an assistant professor of tactics at West Point, and a close friend of General Taylor’s, wrote in his diary at the time of the “impudent arrogance and domineering presumption” of the Polk administration’s assertion that the Texas-U.S. boundary extended to the Rio Grande. “The claim,” he wrote, “is without foundation.” [22]\n\nNews of the first skirmish reached Washington on Saturday, May 9. President Polk was at the time preparing a war message to Congress based on Mexico’s refusal to receive John Slidell. With the outbreak of fighting, Polk had what he wanted. He could now claim that “American blood had been spilled on American soil,” and thus that the United States was fighting an honorable, defensive war. “To Polk,” writes Weeks, “the fiction of Mexican aggression had to be staunchly maintained so as to justify a cession of territory as punishment.” [23]\n\nOn Monday, May 11, President Polk presented his war message to Congress. He blamed Mexico for the outbreak of hostilities and declared that he had done everything in his power to avoid war. He did not ask Congress for a formal declaration of war, as required in the Constitution, but stated that war already existed and asked Congress for money to supply troops in the field. Representative Linn Boyd, Democrat of Kentucky, introduced an amendment to the war bill paraphrasing the president, declaring that “a state of war existed” between Mexico and the United States.”[24]\n\nObjections were immediately raised. Whig Representative Robert Toombs of Georgia charged the president with “usurping the war making power” of Congress as well as “seizing a country” not our own. South Carolina representative Isaac E. Holmes, a Democrat, argued that the outbreak of fighting did not mean that war had broken out, as only Congress could declare war. He noted that in 1807, the British warship Leopard had fired on the U.S. warship Chesapeake, killing a number of Americans, but that this attack had not resulted in war; nor should the outbreak of hostilities in Texas. Holmes’ Democratic colleagues did not agree, however, and Boyd’s amendment passed by a partisan vote of 123-67. A similar amendment introduced in the Senate passed by a vote of 28-18. [25]\n\nRepresentative Joshua Giddings of Ohio, an abolitionist and ally of John Quincy Adams, refused to be intimidated into voting for Polk’s war bill on the skewed basis of providing for troops in the field. He charged that Polk’s aggressive maneuvers were designed to provoke a war with Mexico and that Polk’s ultimate goal was the conquest of Mexico and California.\n\nIn the murder of Mexicans upon their own soil, or in robbing them of their country, I can take no part, either now or hereafter. The guilt of these crimes must rest on others; I will not participate in them; but if Mexicans or any other people should dare invade our country, I would meet them with the sword in one hand and a torch in the other . . . We may always justify ourselves for defending our country, but never for waging a war upon an unoffending people for the purpose of conquest. There is an immutable, an eternal principle of justice pervading the moral universe. No nation, or people, or individual ever did or ever will violate that law with impunity.[26]\n\nThe Senate debated the war bill for two days. Senator Thomas Clayton of Delaware, a Whig, laid out the main arguments of opponents; namely, that the president had initiated hostilities without consulting Congress and that moving U.S. forces into disputed territory was an act of aggression on the part of the U.S.:\n\nI do not see on what principle it can be shown that the President, without consulting Congress and obtaining its sanction for the procedure, had a right to send an army to take up a position, where, as it must have been foreseen, the inevitable consequences would be war. . . . The question is, Was it proper? Was it right? . . . Why was it necessary to cross the desert, and take up a position immediately in front of the friendly town of Matamoros? Why was it necessary to take up that position, with the batteries pointed against the town at a distance of not more than five hundred yards from its environs? It was an aggressive act; an act which the civilized world will designate. It was as much an act of aggression on our part as is a man’s pointing a pistol at another’s breast. . . . I have felt that these acts of the Executive ought to be condemned – I do condemn them. I think that they will be condemned by the people of the United States. By these acts we have been precipitated into a war with a friendly nation.[27] In the end, the Senate voted 40-2 to approve supplies for the troops (coupled with the acknowledgement that war existed), and the House voted 174-14, with 35 abstentions. These tallies, however, hardly reflected the strength of the opposition. As the historian John H. Schroeder explains: As sensitive politicians, most administration critics could not vote their consciences at the expense of their patriotism. Because they understood that national public opinion would be outraged and demand retribution for the attack on the Rio Grande, the opposition dared not risk charges of failing to support an endangered American army. That fear of being labeled disloyal was the foremost consideration in the minds of dissidents.[28] In presenting his war bill to Congress, Polk made no mention of his desire to obtain California and New Mexico. According to the historian Ballard C. Campbell, Polk’s “interest in using the war for territorial gain was not publicly disclosed until August 1846, when the president asked Congress to approve a $2 million appropriation that could be used as partial payment to Mexico for territory – or perhaps a bribe to Santa Anna.”[29]\n\nIndeed, on July 6, an agent of Polk, Alexander Slidell Mackenzie, the nephew of John Slidell, met secretly with Santa Anna in Havana, where the latter was living in comfortable exile. Mackenzie conveyed to him that President Polk would assist his return to power in exchange for negotiating the cession of the disputed border area and at least part of California, for which Mexico would be liberally paid. Mackenzie came away from the three-hour meeting believing that he had succeeded in his mission. Santa Anna was subsequently allowed to pass through the U.S. naval blockade and return to Mexico. Rumors that Santa Anna intended to sell out his country followed him into Mexico City, but he proved them wrong, gathering together a new army to repel the invaders. Polk had been duped. [30]\n\nUnderlying causes: race, history, and “Manifest Destiny”\n\nPresident Polk needed Mexico to strike the first blow not only for the purpose of convincing Congress to enact a war bill, but also to rouse the American public. This was essential if the U.S. was to prosecute a successful war.\n\nThe U.S. Army had less than 7,400 soldiers in early 1846. The war bill passed by Congress on May 13, 1846, authorized the president to enlist 50,000 “volunteers” for twelve months. Many young men jumped at the opportunity, egged on by the pro-war press. Walt Whitman, the 27-year old editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle and later a famed poet, called for revenge against Mexico in an editorial on May 11, 1846:\n\nYes: Mexico must be thoroughly chastised! We have reached a point in our intercourse with that country, when prompt and effectual demonstrations of force are enjoined upon us by every dictate of right and policy. . . . Let our arms now be carried with a spirit which shall teach the world that, while we are not forward for a quarrel, America knows how to crush, as well as how to expand![31] The desire to “crush” Mexico had racial, historical, and ideological overtones.\n\nMost Anglo Americans viewed Mexicans as an inferior race based on their mixed, Spanish-Indian ancestry. While not scorned as “savages,” they were depreciated as “an idle, thriftless people” who did not deserve to rule over the lands they held in North America.[32] Some viewed the inability of Mexicans to pacify hostile tribes as confirmation of their inferiority. Perpetual disorder in the Mexican government furthermore prompted predictions that Americans would one day rule Mexico. William Seton “Guy” Henry, an American journalist who covered the war, wrote of the Mexican people: The finger of Fate points, if not to their eventual extinction, to the time they will cease to be the owners of the soil, and when the Anglo race will rule with republican simplicity and justice, a land literally “flowing with milk and honey” – who will, by their superior mental and physical abilities . . . populate the country with a race of men who will prove the infinite goodness of our Maker, in creating nothing but what is for use and some good purpose.”[33]\n\nAnglo American racism created substantial barriers to peacefully resolving outstanding issues with Mexico through negotiations. Not only was there a widespread belief among Americans that the “inferior” Mexican people must sooner or later give up their lands to the superior “Anglo race,” but the very idea of sitting down at a table and talking as equals was anathema to many. According to Glenn Price, “The attitude was that there was very little difference between an Indian and a Mexican; serious and respectful diplomacy was out of place in either case.”[34] For Polk and many other Americans in that intensely racist era, the mere fact that brown-skinned Mexicans expected to be treated as equals constituted a challenge to the assumed racial hierarchy of Anglo (white) dominance. Polk and company expected Mexicans to accept their status as an “inferior race” and give in to the demands of the “superior race.” Indeed, Mexico’s failure to do so was deemed a sufficient cause for war. According to the historian Amy Greenberg, “Polk viewed international relations through the lens of slaveholding and dominance”:\n\nPolk’s concept of justice was unquestionably shaped by his experience as a slavemaster. Some slaveholders, such as Henry Clay, or Thomas Jefferson a generation before, struggled with the knowledge that slavery was wrong. But like most intensely conservative slave masters in the 1840s, Sarah and James Polk believed the domination of white over black was part of God’s plan. . . . Domination of the strong over the weak, and white over black or brown, was not just the reality of slavery, it was also, in their perspective, right.[35]\n\nth century, depreciating them as pagans (most were Catholic) and savages who improperly used their lands, which British lords proceeded to take over. Andrew Jackson did much the same in the 1830s, labeling the peaceful Indians of the Southeast “savages” and declaring his intention to “reclaim them from their wandering habits,” despite the fact that they had taught Virginia settlers how to grow corn. During the U.S.-Mexican War, the refrain of Anglo-Saxon superiority followed every American victory. When General Taylor captured the Mexican town of Monterrey in September 1846, for example, Walt Whitman described it as “another clinching proof of the indomitable energy of the Anglo-Saxon character.” Of course, there is a long history of one group dehumanizing another when desirous of their land. The English did it to the Irish in the mid-16century, depreciating them as pagans (most were Catholic) and savages who improperly used their lands, which British lords proceeded to take over. Andrew Jackson did much the same in the 1830s, labeling the peaceful Indians of the Southeast “savages” and declaring his intention to “reclaim them from their wandering habits,” despite the fact that they had taught Virginia settlers how to grow corn. During the U.S.-Mexican War, the refrain of Anglo-Saxon superiority followed every American victory. When General Taylor captured the Mexican town of Monterrey in September 1846, for example, Walt Whitman described it as “another clinching proof of the indomitable energy of the Anglo-Saxon character.” [36]\n\nOutspoken Anglo American racism coupled with American aggression evoked fear in Mexico. The editors of a Chihuahua newspaper expressed the view in 1841 that if Mexico failed to stop the United States from annexing Texas, Anglo Americans would not only gobble up more Mexican territory but also establish a different religion on Mexican soil and sell Mexican citizens “as beasts” because “their color was not as white as that of their conquerors.” The editors of El Siglo Diez y Nueve wrote in May 1844 that the United States was populated by a “race that had no mercy for others.” They pointed out the hypocrisy of Americans proclaiming liberty for all while annihilating Indians and enslaving Blacks. The Americans, warned El Siglo, would not be content with merely acquiring Mexican soil; they would only be satisfied when the “Mexican race” was destroyed.[37] Such views explain why many Mexicans demanded that their government fight the U.S. despite Mexico’s military weakness, rather than give in to American aggression.\n\nThe American desire to “crush” Mexico was also rooted in the historical memory of Mexican atrocities committed at the Alamo and Goliad. Similar atrocities committed by U.S. soldiers at San Jacinto were forgotten or viewed as just revenge. According to the American military historian John Eisenhower: During the nine years between the Battle of San Jacinto and the U.S. offer of annexation to Texas, the government of the United States always maintained a proper neutrality between Texas and Mexico. The American people, however, observed no such inhibitions. They openly sympathized with the Anglo-Saxon émigrés whom they now considered Texans; they supplied Sam Houston’s army with weapons; and though brutality occurred on both sides, the Americans sided with the Texan version on every controversial issue. As a result the American public grew progressively more antagonistic toward Mexico as a nation. Mexicans came to be considered less than “civilized” people, undeserving of rights generally accorded to Europeans. It is not surprising, therefore, that rationalizing unjust acts against Mexico would become easy.[38] A third factor influencing American attitudes toward Mexico was the ideology of “manifest destiny,” which combined religious, political, and racial ideas into a righteous justification for American territorial expansion. The most famous proponent of this informal ideology, John O’Sullivan, editor of the United States Magazine and Democratic Review, expressed the view that U.S. expansion was divinely ordained; that it would extend freedom, democracy, and civilization to new lands; and that more land was needed for a rapidly growing Anglo-Saxon population. In asserting this presumed mandate from heaven, O’Sullivan made the case that America represented a new order of civilization, as compared to Old World empires, and that the American character was inherently noble and good. As he wrote in 1839: What friend of human liberty, civilization, and refinement can cast his view over the past history the monarchies and aristocracies of antiquity, and not deplore that they ever existed? What philanthropist can contemplate the oppressions, the cruelties, the injustice inflicted by them on the masses of mankind, and not turn with moral horror from the retrospect? America is destined for better deeds. It is our unparalleled glory that we have no reminiscences of battle fields but in defense of humanity, of the oppressed of all nations, of the rights of conscience, the rights of personal enfranchisement. Our annals describe no scenes of horrid carnage where men were led on by hundreds of thousands to slay one another, dupes and victims to emperors, kings, nobles, demons in the human form called heroes. We have had patriots to defend our homes, our liberties, but no aspirants to crowns or thrones, nor have the American people ever suffered themselves to be led on by wicked ambition to depopulate the land, to spread desolation far and wide, that a human being might be placed on a seat of supremacy.[39] This flattering view of American history and identity ignored much actual history, including the recent forced removal of Native American tribes that caused thousands of deaths. Nor was it true that democratic governments eschewed aggression and imperialism. George C. Herring comments: Dubious when it was written, O’Sullivan’s affirmation soon proved completely wrong. The Mexican-American conflict of 1846-48 was in large part a war of lust and aggrandizement. The United States had long coveted Texas. In the 1840s, California and New Mexico also became objects of desire. With characteristic single-mindedness, Polk set his sights on all of them.[40] The United States, in other words, was becoming more like Old World empires, except that a president rather than a king was leading the nation into “scenes of horrid carnage.” O’Sullivan coined the particular catchphrase “manifest destiny” in the July-August 1845 issue of the United States Magazine and Democratic Review, just after Texas was annexed to the U.S. The slogan was quickly picked up by other expansionists who used it to embellish American territorial ambitions with noble ideals. One such expansionist was the president of the United States, James Polk. In his Third Annual Message to Congress on December 7, 1847, he said: “No country has been so much favored, or should acknowledge with deeper reverence the manifestations of the divine protection. An all-wise Creator directed and guarded us in our infant struggle for freedom and has constantly watched over our surprising progress until we have become one of the great nations of the earth.”[41]\n\nAmong those who called attention to the banality of “Manifest Destiny” was Albert Gallatin, former congressman, secretary of the treasury, and foreign minister, who wrote at the age of eighty-seven, “What shall be said of the notion of an empire extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the North Pole to the Equator? Of the destiny of the Anglo-Saxon race, or its universal monarchy over the whole of North America?” Such “allegations of superiority of race and destiny neither require nor deserve any answer; they are but pretenses under which to disguise ambition, cupidity, or silly vanity.”[42] Abolitionists also held forth a different vision the nation’s progress, one that extended freedom and democracy to three million people enslaved in the United States. Peace advocates, too, conceived of progress in different terms. They envisioned a time when war would be transcended through “the general use of conciliation, arbitration, judicial methods, and other peaceful means of avoiding and adjusting differences among nations,” as stated in the 1828 charter of the American Peace Society.[43]\n\nIn short, not all Americans believed that their nation’s providential mission lay in conquest and imperial power. A sizable minority refused to accept the idea that the United States must follow in the footsteps of Old World empires. Their vociferous protests against the U.S.-Mexican War indicate that many people recognized and wrestled with moral choices in their day. It was not fate or some elusive concept of “manifest destiny” that led the U.S. into war in 1846, but Mr. Polk and the militant expansionists.\n\nCould war have been avoided? Surely it could, had Polk been willing to compromise with Mexico as he did with Great Britain. Had John Slidell gone to Mexico City “in a true spirit of amity and conciliation,” as suggested by Clay, and had Polk not initiated aggressive war maneuvers, negotiations with Mexico over the disputed territory would likely have succeeded. The Mexican government, for its part, could have recognized Texas independence early on, accepting the loss of territory. Whether or not the United States could have obtained California without war is a more difficult hypothetical question. That Mexico might have been willing to sell all or part of California is indicated by the fact that, in 1846, Santa Anna offered to cede Alta California to Great Britain in an attempt to keep it out of American hands. The British declined the offer and encouraged Mexico to settle its differences with the United States. Given Mexican fears of racially-charged Anglo imperialism, the U.S. might have offered an accompanying non-aggression treaty.\n\nIII. Costs and conduct of the war\n\nAfter receiving the casualty report from the Battle of Buena Vista, the Philadelphia North American editorialized on November 11, 1846, “Wars are always popular at a distance. The bulletin that announces the destruction of a thousand fellow beings is received with . . . pride, pomp and circumstance of a glorious war. . . . Let our people realize the price paid for conquered provinces and military glories.” [44] No doubt, many did realize that day the price paid for conquest. Yet the tendency to glorify war, celebrate victories, and make heroes of commanding officers remained steadfast throughout the war. Whig politicians who opposed the war were as eager as Democrats to honor American warriors. Indeed, they selected General Zachary Taylor as their presidential candidate in 1848.\n\nThe U.S.-Mexican War was documented like no other war in history up to that time. At least eighteen American journalists were embedded in U.S. Army units during the war. Hundreds of soldiers wrote letters and dozens were christened “occasional” or “special” correspondents for mass circulation newspapers. Americans also established newspapers in occupied Mexican cities. The public’s demand for eyewitness accounts of battles and first hand news of the war was insatiable. Even antiwar editor Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune felt obliged to print every detail of battle, as “carnage” is what sold newspapers. Newspapers also published lists of casualties, often gathered by journalists, which were more fearfully awaited. News from Mexico took at least ten days to reach New Orleans, after which it was distributed by steamship, rail, or horseback to other cities (telegraph lines were in their infancy). It took another eight days to reach Washington from New Orleans.[45]\n\nAmerican journalists and soldier correspondents typically praised American courage in the field and exulted over American victories, but they also described the dreary and brutal reality of the war: debilitating diseases in the camps, inadequate provisions, disorderly conduct, conflicts between soldiers and officers, desertions, American atrocities against Mexican civilians, and persistent Mexican guerrilla attacks that made it all-but-impossible for soldiers to celebrate their battle victories. The glorification of war, as such, was tarnished by the reality of it.\n\nThree weeks after the first major battles of the war at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma, Christopher Haile of the New Orleans Picayune walked through the battlefield and reported on the scene. “Rather than recount the battle,” writes the historian Michael Scott Van Wagenen, “he discussed the ‘feelings of deep sadness’ and horror he felt on visiting these places. Palo Alto turned particularly dramatic when the party stumbled across the remains of Mexican casualties of Taylor’s artillery that had been mummified by the sun. He spared no detail in describing the mangled bodies and the ‘countenance which their death agonies had stamped on them.’” More typically, it was American casualties that tore at the hearts of Americans. As these casualties mounted, public enthusiasm for the war rapidly diminished. By the end of 1846, the initial rush of volunteers had slowed to a trickle and few were interested in re-enlisting after their term of duty ended. [46]\n\nAbout 90,000 U.S. soldiers served in Mexico during the war; no more than 43,000 at any one time. Approximately 31,000 were Army regulars while 59,000 were part of “volunteer” state regiments. About 40% of the regulars were immigrants, mainly Irish. According to records of the U.S. General Recruiting Service for 1840-49, 35% of the regulars could not sign their own names. All black men were excluded from the U.S. Army, while the U.S. Navy imposed a quota of five percent. Black servants were nonetheless part of many army units. Lieutenant Ulysses S. Grant wrote from New Orleans to his fiancé, Julia Dent, “I have a black boy to take along as my servant that has been in Mexico. He speaks English, Spanish and French. I think he may be very useful where we are going.” Some southern officers brought their slaves with them and some northern officers employed slaves as their servants. Although not formally enrolled as soldiers, some servants took part in battles and were wounded. A few escaped in Mexico.[47]\n\nThe regulars received low pay and were subject to harsh discipline. Volunteers also received low pay but the discipline was light, if not woefully lacking. Some volunteers signed up for three month terms, which hardly allowed for training and regimentation (the federal government later required 12-month terms). Many volunteer regiments elected their own immediate officers “and expected to be treated as citizens, if not heroes,” according to the historian Paul Foos. [48] The regulars, however, proved to be the more disciplined and effective soldiers. “Zachary Taylor, who found the volunteers impossible to control, believed them more trouble than they were worth,” writes Greenberg. “Perhaps he was right. Volunteers, lacking both training and discipline, were not only less reliable under fire than the regulars, and disproportionately susceptible to communicable disease, in part because of poor sanitation practices, but also committed atrocities against Mexican civilians that would come to shock Americans back home.” [49]\n\nThe casualty rate for soldiers was extremely high on both sides. Of the 90,000 U.S. soldiers who served in Mexico, nearly 14,000 died, a death rate of 15.5%, or one out of every seven soldiers. According to Eisenhower, this was “the highest death rate of any war in our history.”[50] On the Mexican side, the death rate was even higher, although figures are less precise. Of some 82,000 men who served in the Mexican army or were guerrillas, an estimated 25,000 lost their lives, an astounding death rate of 31%, or almost one out of every three soldiers. These figures do not include Mexican civilian deaths, the number of which is unknown. As Mexican armies included many women and wives who assisted the soldiers, they were subjected to the travails of exposure, hunger, and disease as well.[51]\n\nAmerican casualties Total number of U.S. soldiers who served in Mexico: 89,836 (Regulars: 31,024; Volunteers: 58,812)\n\nDeaths during the war: 13,962 (15.54%)\n\nKilled in action or died of wounds: 1,733\n\nDied of disease or other causes: 12,229\n\nWounded: 4,152 Mexican casualties Total number of Mexican soldiers mobilized: 82,000\n\nTotal number who died during war: 25,000 (30.5%)\n\nKilled in action or died of wounds: 5,000\n\nDied of disease or other causes: 20,000\n\nMissing: 10,000 Disease was the biggest killer in the war. For every U.S. soldier who died in battle or from battle wounds, seven died of disease. “As was typical for other 19th-century conflicts,” writes the American military historian Derek R. Mallett, “infectious disease accounted for far more deaths than battle trauma. Yellow fever, malaria, dysentery, and epidemic measles, mumps, and even occasional smallpox were problems both on campaign and in camp.”[52] Much illness resulted from drinking tainted water from polluted streams, a situation exacerbated by a shortage of wood to make fires and boil water. Soldiers also needed better tents and medical care. This became apparent during the nine months that General Taylor’s troops spent camping near Corpus Christi (July 1845 to March 1846). According to Foos: Dysentery and fevers raged through the camp until one-sixth of the men were on sick report, and about one-half suffered from some degree of infirmity. The tents provided by the Quartermaster’s Corps were worn and rotten . . . The border region suffered from frequent “northers,” fierce storms that could drop the temperature from ninety degrees to below freezing in a matter of hours. The men slept in mud and cold water, the quartermasters having neglected to provide floors for the tents.[53] To these indignities were added late pay from the Quartermaster and swarms of “camp followers” – liquor sellers, gamblers, prostitutes, and criminals – intent on quickly relieving soldiers of their pay, and sometimes robbing and assaulting them. Taylor could do little to disperse this rabble in Corpus Christi as civilians were subject only to civil authority. Desertions were common on both sides. The number of U.S. deserters is estimated at 9,200, about ten percent of the regulars and nearly seven percent of the volunteers.[54] This is the highest desertion rate in any American war.\n\nDesertions from the Mexican Army were likely greater. On one grueling 250-mile march from San Luis Potosí to Buena Vista (near Saltillo) in February 1847, General Santa Anna lost nearly 5,000 soldiers to desertion or death. Desertions in the U.S. were not sparked by fear of battle but by intolerable living conditions, disease, harsh discipline, and sometimes anti-Catholic prejudice. The Second Pennsylvania Regiment, while still in New Orleans, lost fifty-nine men to desertion, about six percent of its soldiers. In early 1847, forty South Carolina volunteers aboard a riverboat heading for Mobile mutinied. “With fixed bayonets, they stopped the boat and went ashore,” having endured two days below deck without food, according to the American historian Ernest Lander. “No one would obey the officers’ orders to arrest the mutineers; hence the officers yielded and hushed up the affair.” [55]\n\nThe most famous, or infamous, of the American deserters was John Riley, a recent Irish immigrant and former non-commissioned officer in the British Army. Troubled by a war against fellow Catholics, and offered incentives to defect by Mexican authorities, Riley and forty-eight soldiers, mostly Irish-American, deserted General Taylor’s camp across from Matamoros before the first shot was fired. Joined by other Irish and German deserters and a few escaped slaves, Santa Anna organized the soldiers into an artillery battalion in November 1846. The San Patricio Battalion fought tenaciously in battles at Monterrey, Buena Vista, Cerro Gordo, and Churubusco. The U.S. Army captured and executed fifty members of the battalion, but Riley’s life was spared, as he had deserted before the war officially began. His punishment consisted of being whipped and branded with a “D” on his face. The San Patricio Battalion has been honored in Mexico in commemorations and on St. Patrick’s Day. In 2002, Mexico’s Chamber of Deputies inscribed in gold letters on its Wall of Honor, “Defensores de la Patria 1846-1848 y Batallón de San Patricio” (Defenders of the Motherland 1846-1848 and the San Patricio Battalion).\n\nMexican troops often outnumbered U.S. troops on the battlefield but failed to win a single major battle in terms of forcing an American retreat. The Mexican army had antiquated short range artillery and often ran short of ammunition. American long-range artillery eviscerated Mexican units at a distance and thwarted Mexican charges. The U.S. Army also had more highly trained officers and engineers, and was far better supplied than Mexican forces, notwithstanding many limitations. Mexican troops were literally starving at times.\n\nUnable to defeat the Americans in pitched battles, Mexican fighters resorted to guerrilla warfare. This asymmetrical warfare consisted of attacking small groups of U.S. soldiers, plundering supply trains, disrupting communication lines, and making travel unsafe except in large armed groups. The guerilleros or rancheros, as they were called, also took revenge against Mexicans who accommodated the American invaders. U.S. commanders treated the guerrillas as outlaws rather than soldiers, denouncing them as “atrocious bands” that “violate every rule of warfare observed by civilized nations.” [56] Mexicans could also make claims on the unwritten rules of civilized warfare, as the abuse of Mexican civilians began as soon as the Americans set foot in Matamoros in May 1846.\n\nApart from guerrillas, prisoners-of-war were generally treated decently by each side. Almost all were paroled within a short time. Parole was a widely used practice in which prisoners were allowed to go home under an oath not to bear arms for the duration of the war, or until exchanged for prisoners held by the other side. This was not an undesirable outcome for many soldiers. For the U.S., paroling Mexican prisoners was a necessary measure, as the U.S. Army could not afford to feed, house, and guard thousands of Mexican prisoners – and the U.S. captured many more Mexican prisoners than the other way around. In paroling Mexican prisoners quickly, President Polk also hoped to gain favor with the Mexican public and counter the “prejudice” of Mexican newspapers toward the American invaders. On July 9, 1846, he ordered General Taylor to interact with captured Mexican officers and inform them of the willingness of the United States to establish an “honorable peace.” [57] Such efforts to win favor with the Mexican people and convince them of America’s good intentions were fundamentally at odds with the basic mission of the war, which was to conquer and break the will of the Mexican people and government.\n\nMilitary campaigns and occupations\n\nThe Polk administration’s military strategy was subordinate to its political strategy of persuading Mexico to sell or cede the territories of Nuevo México and Alta California. President Polk did not initially plan to conquer Mexico City, nor engage in a lengthy war of occupation. His three-part strategy involved:\n\ndirecting General Zachary Taylor to take control of the northeastern region of Mexico, beginning with the town of Matamoros;\n\nsending Colonel Stephen W. Kearny and some 1,600 soldiers from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to secure the northern territories of Nuevo México and Alta California, and dispatching naval forces in the Pacific to assist in the capture of California; and\n\nordering a naval blockade of Mexico’s Gulf ports so as to deprive the central government of its major source of revenue, import duties.\n\nPolk decided on the invasion of central Mexico in November 1846, following General Taylor’s capture of Monterrey and the Mexican government’s continued refusal to acquiesce to U.S. demands. The invasion, led by General Winfield Scott, began with the bombardment and takeover of Veracruz in March 1847 and ended with the fall of Mexico City in September, although the vicissitudes of occupation continued. U.S. forces finally withdrew in July 1848, after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo had been signed and ratified by both countries.\n\nMajor battles Dates U.S. commander Palo Alto & Resaca de la Palma May 8-9, 1846 Zachary Taylor Monterey Sept. 21-23, 1846 Zachary Taylor Buena Vista Sept. 21-23, 1846 Zachary Taylor Chihuahua Feb. 28, 1847 Alexander Doniphan Veracruz Mar. 22-26, 1847 Winfield Scott Cerro Gordo Apr. 17-18, 1847 Winfield Scott Contreras & Churubusco Aug. 18-20, 1847 Winfield Scott\n\nOccupying a foreign country was something new in American foreign policy. Although U.S. forces repeatedly invaded British Canada during the War of 1812, they occupied only one small section of Upper Canada at the end of the war – and had to give that up in the peace treaty. The invasion of Spanish Florida by General Andrew Jackson in the First Seminole War succeeded in pressuring Spain to transfer Florida to the United States, but Jackson’s forces did not remain to occupy the peninsula.\n\nThe American occupation of Mexico was accompanied by much abuse and violence against Mexican civilians. This violence falls into four categories:\n\nPersonal violence – the abuse of civilians by individual soldiers, including robbery, rape, and murder. This unscripted, wanton violence was especially prevalent in Taylor’s northeastern campaign, despite efforts by U.S. officers to stop it. Counter-insurgency violence – the extension of anti-guerrilla operations to civilians, including revenge attacks, torture, and intimidation; aimed at negating civilian support for guerrillas and extracting information as to their whereabouts. As guerrilla warfare was deemed outside the rules of civilized combat, special U.S. counterinsurgency units engaged in “uncivilized” methods with tacit approval by commanders. Collateral war violence – war operations such as bombardments and sieges of cities that result in extensive civilian casualties and property damage. The U.S. bombardment of Veracruz under General Scott stands out as one of the more egregious examples of “collateral damage,” as hundreds of civilians were killed or wounded. Structural violence – official policies that impoverish, oppress, or humiliate the civilian population, including taxing the population to support the U.S. occupation and imposing martial law. Both Taylor and Scott imposed martial law on Mexican towns but, to their credit, refused to take provisions from the civilian population without paying for them.\n\nIn general, the harsher the measures employed against Mexican civilians, the greater the popular resistance to the American occupation. It was thus a matter of American military security to prevent violence against Mexican civilians. Yet a war of conquest and occupation, imposed no less by undisciplined volunteers, does not easily conform to civilized rules of military engagement.\n\nGeneral Taylor and the occupation of northeastern Mexico\n\nGeneral Zachary Taylor’s occupation of northeastern Mexico began on May 18, 1846, when his troops crossed the Rio Grande and took control of Matamoros unopposed. The Mexican army led by General Arista had retreated to the interior the night before, being short of every kind of provision. In June, Taylor began receiving reinforcements, mainly volunteer regiments, in anticipation of moving on to other towns. He waited until August for the arrival of steamboats to move his troops and supplies to Camargo, 80 miles upriver. The waiting period proved hazardous for the 4,000 residents of Matamoros. According to the U.S. Army military historian General John S. Brown: As the boredom of garrison duty began to set in, plundering, personal assaults, rape, and other crimes against Mexicans quickly multiplied. During the first month after the volunteers arrived, some twenty murders occurred. Initially, Taylor seemed uninterested in devising diversions to occupy his men and failed to stop the attacks. As thefts, assaults, rapes, murders, and other crimes perpetrated by the volunteers mounted and Taylor failed to discipline his men, ordinary Mexican citizens began to have serious reservations about the American invasion. Taylor’s lackadaisical approach to discipline produced an effect utterly unanticipated by the Polk administration, many of whose members, particularly pro-expansionists such as Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker, believed that Mexicans would welcome the Americans as liberators. Instead, public opinion turned against the Americans.[58]\n\nGeneral Taylor’s inclination was to treat the Mexican population with humanity. He ordered that provisions be purchased at full market value, thereby currying favor with the local business community. Taylor also established a newspaper, written in Spanish and English, called Republic of the Rio Grande and Friend of the People. Yet Taylor’s control over his volunteer units left much to be desired. Lieutenant Ulysses S. Grant, in a letter to his letter to his fiancé, noted that a ”great many murders” had been committed against Mexican civilians in Matamoros in recent weeks, and that U.S. officers in charge had failed “to prevent frequent repetitions.”\n\nSome of the volunteers and above all the Texans seem to think it perfectly right to impose upon the people of a conquered City to any extent, and even to murder them where the act can be covered by the dark. And how much they seem to enjoy acts of violence too! I would not pretend to guess the number of murders that have been committed upon the persons of poor Mexicans and the soldiers, since we have been here, but the number would startle you.[59] News reporters caught wind of the mayhem. In mid-July 1846, the journalist George Kendall of the New Orleans Picayune reported from Matamoros, “Several Mexicans were killed in rows last night – some say five or six – by drunken brawlers who hang about the camp of the Texans.” Kendall’s colleague, Christopher Haile, commented on the rising attacks against the American volunteers, observing that the inhabitants “appear sullen and inclined to seek revenge . . . they hate us cordially.” Guy Henry, a writer for the New York magazine, Spirit of the Times, offered a more sympathetic view of Mexicans after visiting hospitals in Matamoros. “I left the hospital shocked with the horrors of war,” he wrote. The hospitals were “filled with wounded and dying” Mexican soldiers, their amputated limbs confirming the effectiveness of American artillery at the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma.[60]\n\nThe big story in the American press, however, was the great victory of Taylor’s “heroic little army” in these two battles. A Illinois paper editorialized, “The prowess of our brave soldiers has made the perfidious Mexicans bite the dust.” A South Carolina paper proudly proclaimed that “since the eventful days of our Revolutionary struggle no battle has been fought in which the heroes who march under the Star Spangled Banner, covered themselves with more glory, than did the little band who pressed forward at the command of the heroic Taylor, and charged an enemy of vastly superior numbers, in the very teeth of their roaring, death-dealing cannon!” [61]\n\nnd Tennessee” regiment. Taylor’s reinforced army of 12,000 regulars and volunteers departed in August 1846 for Camargo. They arrived just after a flood had contaminated the drinking water of the town. During the next few weeks, unhealthy conditions and high heat combined to kill an estimated 1,500 U.S. soldiers. “When the army finally marched out,” notes John Eisenhower, “only 370 of 795 Georgians were present for duty; only 324 of 754 Alabamians; 317 of 588 in the 2Tennessee” regiment. [62]\n\nHaving set up a supply depot at Camargo, Taylor’s next objective was to capture the fortified city of Monterrey, defended by 7,300 troops under General Pedro de Ampudia. Taylor arrived with about 6,600 soldiers, having left behind 4,000 volunteers in Camargo. The 10,000 residents of Monterrey had just celebrated the 250th anniversary of the city’s founding on September 20, 1596. Taylor’s forces struck on September 21. After three days of bombardment and fighting, with each side suffering some 450 casualties, Ampudia offered to surrender the city on condition that his troops be allowed to withdraw without harm and that an eight-week armistice go into effect. Taylor accepted the terms, half-expecting that a political settlement would ensue.\n\nPresident Polk was irate upon hearing the news of the armistice. He recorded in his diary that if Taylor had imprisoned Ampudia’s army, it “would probably have ended the war with Mexico.” [63] Polk had hoped for a knock-out blow that would force the Mexican government to relent. Instead, the Mexican government remained intransigent on ceding its northern territories and Polk began planning for an invasion of Mexico City. He also sent a message to Taylor to terminate the truce. In early October, Secretary of War William Marcy furthermore ordered Taylor to “draw supplies” for our Army “from the enemy without paying for them,” and to “require contributions for its support” to the extent practicable. Taylor wrote back that “it would have been impossible hitherto, and is so now, to sustain the Army to any extent by forced contributions of money or supplies.” [64] He continued to pay Mexicans fair prices for necessary provisions. This official practice, however, did not prevent individual soldiers from taking what they wanted, their low pay or late pay being a catalyst to their thievery.\n\nDespite Taylor’s inclination to treat the population well, the American occupation of Monterrey quickly deteriorated. Within two weeks, the governor of Nuevo León complained to General William J. Worth that American volunteers were abusing the inhabitants, even killing civilians “without mercy or reasonable motive.” Such abuse troubled U.S. officers, who anticipated retribution. Lieutenant George Meade, in a letter to his wife on October 20, 1846, wrote that American volunteers “have made themselves so terrible by their previous outrages as to have inspired the Mexicans with a perfect horror of them.”[65] The retribution was not long in coming, as John Brown notes: The local populace increasingly appeared more than willing to support and shield the guerrillas. The volunteers’ racism, anti-Catholicism and violence provided all the motive that locals needed to oppose the American advance. Guerrilla attacks grew more frequent after the battle for Monterrey, when Brig. Gen. William J. Worth . . . discontinued military patrols in the town for a short time, allowing a bloodletting to occur. Observers estimated that volunteer troops killed some 100 civilians, including many who had been killed by Col. John C. Hays’ 1st Texas Mounted Volunteers. The Texas Rangers were the most notorious of the volunteer units. According to Brown, “The Rangers hoped either to find and eliminate the guerrillas or to terrorize the local people to such an extent that they would stop supporting the irregulars.”[66] Commanding officers did little to control the Rangers, as their skills as scouts and guerrilla fighters were highly valued. Indeed, Texas Ranger units were parceled out to every army division.\n\nAmerican journalists were on hand to observe the American occupation of Monterrey. The Charleston Mercury reported on October 11, 1846: “As at Matamoros, murder, robbery, and rape were committed in the broad light of day, and as if desirous to signalize themselves at Monterrey by some new act of atrocity, they burned many of the thatched huts of the poor peasants. It is thought that one hundred of the inhabitants were murdered in cold blood, and one . . . was shot dead at noon-day in the main street of the city.” This story was republished in other U.S. newspapers and in London as well. American depredations were also reported in the Mexican press, which charged that “the volunteers, the most unprincipled and ungovernable class at home, have been let loose like blood-hounds on Mexico. [67]\n\nWith Monterrey secured, Taylor extended the American occupation to other northeastern towns and cities. General John E. Wool, who recently arrived from San Antonio, was ordered to take charge of Parras; General Worth was directed to Saltillo; and Taylor proceeded to Victoria, 175 miles south of Monterrey. Taylor soon had to backtrack, however, as Santa Anna had intercepted a letter revealing that half of Taylor’s army was departing to join General Scott’s impending invasion on the east coast. Recognizing Taylor’s vulnerability, Santa Anna hastily organized a force of nearly 20,000 soldiers at San Luis Potosí. On the punishing 250-mile hike north to Buena Vista, nearly one-fourth of his army deserted or died. The survivors arrived hungry and exhausted.\n\nThe two armies clashed at Buena Vista on February 22-23, 1847. The battle was fiercely fought and produced heavy casualties, especially on the Mexican side. After two days, Taylor’s troops were on the verge of defeat, but Santa Anna abruptly decided to withdraw his remaining forces in order to meet General Scott’s invasion into the heart of Mexico. Despite Taylor’s near defeat, he was hailed as a hero on the home front and marked as a potential presidential candidate in 1848.\n\nOne week after the Battle of Buena Vista, the last formal battle in the northeast region took place outside the city of Chihuahua. Col. Alexander W. Doniphan and some 1,000 soldiers, having made their way from Santa Fe, defeated a Mexican force of comparable size and took charge of the city. Doniphan arranged for American merchants to be established and kept watch for guerrilla activity during his two month stay. With many of his volunteer enlistments ending soon, he took his regiment to Saltillo on April 28, allowing the Mexican governor of the state to take charge of the city.\n\nWith the end of major battles in the northeastern region, Taylor focused on maintaining law and order, preventing and responding to guerrilla attacks, and, to a lesser degree, protecting communities from Indian attacks. Comanche, Apache, and Navaho raids in northern Mexico were on the rise, due in part to the diversion of Mexican forces to fight the Americans. The U.S. imposed martial law on Mexican communities. One regulation stated, “All Mexicans, except the Police, are ordered to confine themselves to their houses after sunset. Any found in the streets after that time will be fired upon.” Another warned that any Mexican found selling liquor “will be punished by confiscating all their property and such other punishment as may be ordered by a court martial, not excepting death.” [68]\n\nGeneral Wool, as military governor of Saltillo, added to the oppression by instituting a policy that held whole towns responsible for any stolen U.S. Army goods, threatening the residents with large fines. The innocent, as such, were made to pay for the guilty. “Within a few months,” notes Brown, “Wool collected more than $8,000 in fines, as well as livestock and other personal property.[69] General Wool also made an effort to crack down on reckless American violence and abuse. He imposed stricter discipline, instituted curfews, tried to keep troops away from population centers, and threatened disobedient soldiers with discharge. Judging by news reports, however, these measures were not enough. John Durivage, a correspondent for the New Orleans Picayune stationed in Monterrey, wrote on April 25, 1847: You have published accounts of the disgraceful outrage perpetrated before the battle of Buena Vista, and will be no less shocked to learn that an equally sickening scene of outrageous barbarity has been perpetrated in this region by persons calling themselves Americans. It appears that near a little town called Guadalupe, an American was shot two or three weeks ago; and his companions and friends determined to revenge his death. Accordingly a party of a dozen or twenty men visited the place and deliberately murdered twenty-four Mexicans.[70] General Taylor confirmed the lawless personal violence in a dispatch to the War Department on June 16, 1847: I deeply regret to report that many of the twelve months’ volunteers, in their route hence to the lower Rio Grande, have committed extensive depredation and outrages upon the peaceable inhabitants. There is scarcely a form of crime that has not been reported to me as committed by them . . . Were it possible to rouse the Mexican people to resistance, no more effectual plan could be devised than the very one pursued by some of our volunteer regiments.[71]\n\nPresident Polk’s blunt strategy for dealing with the difficulties of occupation was to win the war as quickly as possible and get out. In public pronouncements he gave no indication of the problems of occupation. In his Second Annual Message to Congress in December 1846, he praised “our volunteer citizen soldiers, who so promptly responded to their country’s call, with an experience of the discipline of a camp of only a few weeks, have borne their part in the hard-fought battle of Monterrey with a constancy and courage equal to that of veteran troops and worthy of the highest admiration.” There was no mention of discipline problems or abuses, or efforts to correct these. His message the following year was much the same. “Too much praise can not be bestowed upon our officers and men, regulars and volunteers, for their gallantry, discipline, indomitable courage, and perseverance, all seeking the post of danger and vying with each other in deeds of noble daring.”[72]\n\nNewspaper editors and journalists generally followed the president’s patriotic lead in reporting on the war, but there were times when, as Josiah Gregg of the Louisville Daily Journal wrote, “it is painful to feel compelled to confess that the volunteers . . . have given much cause for the dread in which they are held by the Mexican citizens.” Citing recent “depredations [that] have been a disgrace to the American name,” he wrote to his editors, “Can you explain this?” [73]\n\nThe “Army of the West” in Nuevo México and Alta California\n\nIn 1846, there were about 7,000 Mexicans in Alta California and some 65,000 Mexicans and Pueblo Indians in Nuevo México. [74] There were also about 2,000 Americans in Alta California, most having arrived within the last five years without regard to Mexican immigration laws. The two territories made up a significant portion of the Mexican land mass but held only one percent of the Mexican population. In Nuevo México, Governor Manuel Armijo received news of the war in early July. To meet the expected American invasion, he requested troops from Mexico City, 1,500 miles to the south, and issued a call for volunteers. When no troops arrived, Armijo decided to send home some 3,000 poorly armed volunteers who had responded to his call.\n\nCol. Stephen Kearny’s “Army of the West” thus entered Santa Fe unopposed on August 18, 1846. In a display of power, Kearny’s troops marched in, sabers drawn, with cannons firing in the distance, and hoisted the American flag over the governor’s palace. Joseph Magoffin, an aide to Col. Kearny who later became mayor of El Paso, indicated in his official report that the Americans were graciously received by the inhabitants: “Gen’l. Kearny entered this city on 18th 5 o’c P.M., the authorities & people of the place being ready to give him a hearty welcome.”[75] Lieutenant Richard Smith Elliott, a correspondent for the St. Louis Reveille, looked more closely at the reactions of the residents: Our march into the city . . . was extremely warlike . . . From around corners, men, with surly countenances and downcast looks regarded us with watchfulness, if not terror. . . . Strange, indeed, must have been the feelings of the citizens, when an invading army was thus entering their home . . . all the future of their destiny vague and uncertain – their new rulers strangers to their manners, language and habits, and, as they had been taught to believe, enemies to the only religion they had ever known. . . . As the American flag was raised, and the cannon boomed its glorious national salute from the hill . . . a sigh of commiseration, even for causeless distress, escaped from many a manly breast, as the wail of grief arose above the din of our horses’ tread, and reached our ears from the depth of the gloomy-looking buildings on every hand.[76]\n\nCol. Kearny informed Governor Armijo that the United States was in possession of Santa Fe and all territory east of the upper Rio Grande, in keeping with the extended Texas border appropriated by the United States. He addressed a gathering in the public square, imploring “the inhabitants of New Mexico to remain tranquil in their peaceable avocations and labors, with the assurance that they will not be molested by the American army, but on the contrary, they will be respected and protected in all their rights, both civil and religious.” He warned that anyone who bore arms against the United States “will be looked upon as enemies and treated accordingly.” Kearny also promised to “keep off the Indians” and protect “your persons and property,” a promise that undoubtedly appealed to many, as Navaho and Apache raids continued to terrorize the population outside the main cities of Santa Fe, Taos, and Albuquerque.[77]\n\nCol. Kearny and his officers furthermore made an effort to win favor with church leaders and “reputable citizens of the city,” attending church services and holding a “splendid ball at the Palace.” The occupation, in Magoffin’s view, was an unqualified success. “The fact is, to make a long story short, Gen’l. Kearny by his mild & persuasive manner has induced the good people of New Mexico to believe that they now belong to the greatest nation on earth, & that the stars and stripes, which are now so gallantly waving over the capitol of this city, will always give them ample protection from foreign foes.” [78]\n\nHowever exaggerated Magoffin’s account, the Indian threat did, in fact, create a measure of cooperation between the occupying American forces and New Mexicans. On September 18, Kearny initiated a campaign against the Navajos, his forces augmented by sixty-five Mexican and Pueblo Indian volunteers. The campaign quickly shifted to negotiations, resulting in a treaty of “permanent peace, mutual trust and friendship” on November 22. Col. Alexander Doniphan signed the treaty on behalf of the United States. Fourteen Navajo chiefs signed with an “X,” persuaded no doubt by the American purchase of several hundred sheep and cattle from the Navajos. Col. Kearny had meanwhile departed for California on September 25, leaving Col. Sterling Price in charge of a reduced regiment. Before leaving, Kearny sent a report to President Polk assuring him that civil government had been established and order secured in New Mexico. The assurance was premature. Although Kearny’s occupation was considerably less abusive than that of Taylor in the northeast region, the occupation was nevertheless unwanted and eventually resisted. According to one account: Bored U.S. troops, overcrowded in Santa Fe, started to attack New Mexican civilians; racial tensions escalated (in their memoirs of the conquest a number of U.S. soldiers made ugly statements expressing contempt for Mexicans). Some New Mexicans regretted not having offered more resistance when the U.S. army took possession of the territory. Now they planned revolts. In December, officials uncovered a plot to overthrow the occupation forces and assassinate Governor [Charles] Bent. The conspirators were quickly arrested, and the guard was doubled at the governor’s palace.[79] An insurrection led by Pueblo Indians broke out in January 1847. They killed Governor Bent, rallied support among the small towns of northern New Mexico, and prepared for an attack on Santa Fe. Col. Price, with some 500 soldiers and artillery, attacked the rebels with maximum force at Pueblo de Taos, February 3-5. Price reported 150 Mexican and Pueblo Indians dead, and U.S. casualties of seven dead and forty-five wounded. Over the next three months, trials were held and 22 Mexicans and five Pueblo Indians were hanged. William B. Drescher, a U.S. soldier who witnessed the hangings, wrote in his memoirs. “You should have seen the poor wives of the Indians hung — heard their moans and observed their despair.”[80] The New Mexico territory thereafter remained securely in the hands of the Americans.\n\nThe Polk administration made quick work of conquering Alta California, having prepared well in advance. In June 1845, eleven months before the outbreak of war, he sent “secret and confidential” instructions to Commodore John Sloat, commander of U.S. naval forces in the Pacific: “If you ascertain with certainty that Mexico has declared war against the United States, you will at once possess yourself of the port of Saint Francisco, and blockade and occupy such other ports as your force may permit.” Sloat was thus prepared to act when he received word a year later that hostilities had commenced. He took charge of Monterey on July 7, 1846, and San Francisco two days later, announcing, “Henceforth California will be a portion of the United States.”[81] As in New Mexico, Sloat told the Mexican people that the U.S. was not “an enemy” but a friend who would treat them with respect.\n\nPrior to Sloat’s takeover of the port cities, some thirty Americans in Sonoma, north of San Francisco, initiated a revolt on June 14, 1846. According to an account by one of the rebels, Robert Semple, the armed group woke up General Mariano Vallejo that morning, who inquired of the raggedy looking intruders, “To what happy circumstances shall I attribute the visit of so many exalted personages?” One rebel replied, “We mean to establish our own government in California, and independent republic, and are under arms to support it. You are under arrest, General.”[82] The rebels proclaimed the independent “Bear Flag Republic.” The republic lasted only one week before John C. Frémont, an agent of Polk, arrived and took command of the rebellion in the name of the United States. On July 15, Sloat transferred his command to Commodore Robert F. Stockton, who placed Frémont’s forces under his command.\n\nHaving secured control over the northern part of Alta California, Stockton sailed to the southern part to take the ports of Los Angeles and San Diego, which was achieved without bloodshed in August. For the next six months, however, Mexican Californios organized resistance to the occupation. Mexicans forced the small garrison in Los Angeles to surrender in September 1846. When Col. Kearny’s forces arrived in San Diego in early December they were almost immediately drawn into battle against Mexican forces under Captain Andrés Pico at San Pasqual. Kearny was forced to retreat, but one month later, a combined American force led by Commodore Stockton won the Battle of San Gabriel, ending the resistance. Captain Pico formally surrendered Alta California on January 13, 1847, and Kearny took over as military governor. U.S. naval forces were also in control of the separate Mexican territory of Baja California, but possession was returned to Mexico in the peace treaty at the end of the war.\n\nGeneral Scott and the occupation of middle Mexico\n\nGeneral Winfield Scott was determined to prevent the unwarranted violence and discipline problems that plagued Taylor’s northeastern occupation. It was imperative that he do so, for the population in central Mexico was much larger than that of northeastern Mexico and could cause significantly more problems. According to an 1842 Mexican census, the population in the four Mexican states occupied by Taylor’s forces (Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, Coahuila, and Chihuahua) amounted to 424,112 people, or 6% of the total Mexican population of 7,016,300. The population in the three states on Scott’s route to Mexico City (Veracruz, Puebla, and México) was 2,305,802, or 33% of the total Mexican population. [83]\n\nScott needed to win a measure of acceptance from the Mexican people in order to minimize attacks on U.S. troops, secure food and supplies en route to Mexico City, and maintain law and order in the towns and cities under U.S. control. Upon arriving in Tampico in mid-February 1847, Scott issued General Order No. 20, or Martial Law Order, which “made rape, murder, assault, robbery, desecration of churches, disruption of religious services, and destruction of private property court-martial offenses” for all persons, Mexican and American. According to John Brown, “All accused offenders would be tried before a court made up of officers appointed by the commanding general. The tribunals had the authority to determine innocence or guilt and to levy punishment, which included the lash, hard labor in ball and chain, imprisonment, branding, and even death.”[84]\n\nThis edict, coupled with the fact that U.S. troops were preparing for a major military campaign rather than biding their time as an occupation force, helped curb flagrant abuses against Mexican civilians. Yet Scott’s strategy in taking the city of Veracruz belied his expressed intention to protect civilians. During the three-day bombardment, March 22-25, U.S. forces launched 6,700 cannonballs into the city, causing an estimated 500 civilian and military deaths and significant damage to homes, buildings, and merchandise. [85] On the third day of the assault, Mexican General Juan Morales and the foreign consuls in the city asked for a temporary ceasefire to allow for civilians to be evacuated. Scott rejected the request, calculating that this would only delay surrender. According to the historian Glenn Price, the bombing “was indiscriminate, with explosive shells which were lobbed up with the design of crashing through the flimsy roofs of the adobe houses and exploding among the families after falling inside. The British press was extremely critic"
