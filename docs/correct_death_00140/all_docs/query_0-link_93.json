In the beginning, this mount had form without meaning. It was not visible, nor haunted; now it is both. Getting to the bottom of the matter requires disorientation. The bedrock is liquid. The landmark’s life history begins with the ghost of a lake. Utah Lake occupies the center of Utah Valley, which occupies the center of Utah County, which occupies the center of Utah. The names expand outward concentrically, with decreasing speciﬁcity, for a reason. In the nineteenth century, and for untold ages before, this lake deﬁned a place and a people. Indeed, in its original usage as a placename, “Utah” signiﬁed the lakeside home of the “Utahs.” The name was not endemic; colonial invaders—ﬁrst Spaniards, then Mexicans, then Americans—imposed it. At the time of contact, the natives called themselves Fish-Eaters, Lake People, or the Timpanogos—a name drawn from the river where the lake ﬁsh spawned. The Lake of the Timpanogos was a haven in a hard, inconstant land. Even in the thinnest year, the natives (now called Utes) could procure fat trout in spring. This rich, anomalous ecosystem attracted outsiders. In 1849 a Euro-\n\nOn Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press. All rights reserved.\n\non zion’s mount American settler population—the Latter-day Saints, or Mormons— began colonizing Utah Valley. These farmers became ﬁsh-eaters too as they struggled at ﬁrst to establish an agrarian economy. Here at the shoreline natives and newcomers coexisted edgily for one generation. Under the guidance of their prophet Brigham Young, the Saints aspired to redeem their “red brethren,” the “Lamanites.” In practice, hostility supplanted harmony. Settlers and Indians clashed repeatedly at the mouth of the Provo (Timpanogos) River, the best ﬁshing site in the valley. Ultimately, with the federal government’s blessing, the Mormons forced the starving remnants of the Timpanogos to move to a distant reservation. Without the Lake People, the lake stopped being the Center Place. Nonetheless, Utah Lake remained signiﬁcant to the second generation of settlers as an economic and recreational resource. The presence of water still set the valley apart. In the twentieth century, things changed. Gradually Utah Lake was marginalized. As a result of local overuse and state mismanagement, the trout ﬁshery degenerated into a carp pond. Then, during World War II, the federal government built a colossal steel mill on the lakeshore. The water acquired a reputation—not undeserved—for being polluted. As local recreationists looked elsewhere for ﬁshing, boating, and swimming, Utah Lake lost its centrality. By the end of the century it was perceived as just one element of the valley rather than its essence; Utah’s eponymous lake had symbolically shrunk. In 1996, in conjunction with the state centennial, a local newspaper ran the headline “Timpanogos Has Always Dominated Utah Valley.” The accompanying story had nothing to do with a lake or a river. It was all about a mountain. Mount Timpanogos, a limestone massif in the Wasatch Range, is by far the most-loved, most-hiked, most-photographed, most-talkedabout mountain in contemporary Utah. Its attractions include the Mount Timpanogos Wilderness Area, the Timpanogos Cave National Monument, and the Sundance Resort, built by movie star Robert Redford. More than a million people (and counting) live within twenty miles of this recreational magnet. Here along the Wasatch\n\n2 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFront, Utah’s main population corridor, the overwhelming majority of residents are Mormons—descendents of the pioneers. In conversation, locals refer to the mountain by its endearing diminutive, “Timp.” The bonds of affection are strongest in Utah Valley—otherwise known as the Provo-Orem metropolitan area—where the mountain’s name graces a hospital, three public schools, and a Mormon temple. The proﬁle of the massif adorns the masthead of Provo’s newspaper, whose publisher sponsors a popular summer contest: guess when the last winter snow will be visible on “Timp.” Oil paintings of “Timp” abound in local ofﬁces and foyers; picture windows face north toward the rock face. Climbing to the 11,750-foot summit is a local rite of passage—something to do before you grow old. Grandparents entertain their progeny with “Indian stories” about the landform. The most widespread tale, the Legend of Timpanogos, concerns the lover’s leap of an Indian princess. Tour guides at Timpanogos Cave have repeated this yarn for decades. In the 1930s a Provo composer wrote an opera based on the suicide legend; more recently a local ballet troupe adapted it for the stage. Inﬂuenced by the story, many valley residents—children in particular—visualize the outline of a dead or sleeping maiden on the crest of the mountain. People see what they want to see. But vision, like desire, changes over time. In the mid-nineteenth century people didn’t see the landmark called “Timp” because it didn’t yet exist. Mount Timpanogos didn’t even appear as a named feature on maps. To settlers it was just another long ridge in “the mountains,” which even in the aggregate didn’t merit recognition as Utah Valley’s outstanding natural feature. That distinction belonged to the lake. What caused a mountainous space to become the mountain-place called “Timp”? Remarkably, it was a promotional campaign. In the 1910s and 1920s, boosters from Brigham Young University (BYU) and its home city, Provo, desired their own celebrated mountain. To realize this goal, they organized mass community hikes to what federal surveyors had determined—mistakenly, it turns out—to be the\n\n3 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008.

Promoters pushed a “Wonder Mountain.” The point man, BYU athletics director Eugene “Timpanogos” Roberts, wrote and disseminated the original fake Indian legend. Intuitively he understood a geographic principle: great landmarks are storied landmarks. Since Mount Timpanogos possessed no usable past, boosters invented one. Ultimately they failed to turn their legendary mountain into a national landmark, but they succeeded in making a local one. The booster project worked so well as to be forgotten. In local collective memory, legendary Indians in the rocky highlands replaced historical Utes in the watery lowlands. Notwithstanding the Mormon ﬁxation on pioneer history, the story of Provo’s colonization—a violent, intimate chronicle of Mormon-Ute relations—fell to the margins of consciousness by the 1910s, when the Legend of Timpanogos began to circulate. As a memory site, Mount Timpa-\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press.

Harvard University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nnogos encouraged forgetting. According to the stories told by hikers, the unnamed Indians of olden days were mountain people, too. In short, the sense of place surrounding “Timp” concealed a double displacement—the literal displacement of the Timpanogos Utes, and the symbolic displacement of their lake. To be understood, this splitlevel history must be viewed from the bottom as well the top. The same large-scale historical forces that strengthened one landmark weakened the other. Utah Lake was an emblem of the Aquarian Age—a time when people necessarily developed intimate relationships with their local water resources. Before the twentieth century, fording a stream, carrying water from a well, bathing in a mineral spring, collecting ice were everyday American experiences. In the subsequent Hydraulic Age, water use went indoors even as water knowledge went underground. Today only technocrats and technicians develop familiarity with waterworks. For most residents, it’s enough to know that potable water arrives through one set of invisible pipes, and wastewater leaves through another. Visual and recreational contact with faraway nature has largely replaced tactile and workaday contact with nearby nature. In this respect, “Timp” symbolizes our time.1\n\n^\n\n“Timp” is a landmark—a legible feature of the landscape where meaning is concentrated. Landmarks come in different shapes and sizes. They can be fabricated (like the tallest skyscraper in the city) or biological (like the oldest tree in the neighborhood) or geomorphic (like the biggest boulder in the park). We must resist the temptation to employ a simpler, two-part schema, the man-made versus the natural; trees can be planted, and boulders can be moved.2 The topography of Earth is a hybrid creation. Since ancient times, humans have produced both deliberate and accidental landmarks; burial mounds and shell mounds represent each type, respectively. More often, humans have enhanced “natural landmarks” with modiﬁcations. Inscription Rock (or El Morro)—a sandstone butte beside\n\n5 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press. All rights reserved.\n\non zion’s mount a historic thoroughfare in New Mexico—is both a cultural and a physical landmark. Over the centuries, hundreds of wayfarers have carved names and symbols on its walls. Metaphorically, all landmarks bear human inscriptions. Even unmodiﬁed terrestrial landmarks like “Timp” are hybrid creations in that they wouldn’t exist without the human imagination.3 Environmental perception is more concrete than image and representation. Out in the world, as within our bodies, mental causes can produce physical effects. Once people start or stop imagining a landform as a landmark, that landform will receive more or less intensive use. A designated landmark like Mount Rainier—a national park—attracts tourists who expect roads and trails and facilities, all of which leave footprints. Seeing has consequences: “natural landmarks” equate to human marks on the land. In other words, a perceptual landscape overlaps the physical one. These layers of reality are not glued together in smooth and permanent contiguity; instead, they are fastened together at points. Landmarks are these fastening-points. We use them for orientation. They are the icons of our mental maps. Landmarks fall within a certain size range: big enough that humans can see them, not so big that humans cannot visualize them. Pikes Peak is a landmark; the Rockies, of which it is part, are not. Not everyone “sees” the obvious peak, however. Children are far more aware of the world at their feet than of the world above their heads. From the perspective of adults, children orient themselves strangely. They use smaller, more intimate landmarks. Likewise, old-timers see differently from newcomers. There are as many layers of landscape perception as there are people. Each of these layers has a few unique fastening-points. But major landmarks anchor the perceptions of multiple people—and sometimes of multiple groups of people. These communities of perception may be as small as a family or as large as a nation.4 Mount Timpanogos anchors several sizable communities of perception (for example, the users of Sundance, the students at BYU) and also symbolizes one of them. For the permanent residents of the\n\n6 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nIntroduction\n\nCopyright © 2008.

(Author’s photo)\n\nProvo-Orem metropolitan area, the mountain is an emblem. A speciﬁc sense of place supports a general sense of home. Most cities possess at least one afﬁliated landmark—something that appears on logos and souvenirs. Thanks to media exposure, certain urban emblems have earned recognition far beyond their locale. Everyone knows that the Golden Gate Bridge stands for San Francisco and the Gateway Arch for St. Louis. From 1973 to 2001 the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center functioned as a landmark for New Yorkers. Mount Timpanogos is Provo’s skyscraper. Civic polities aren’t the only communities that create general “place identities” out of speciﬁc “place attachments.” Ethnic and religious groups sustain landmarks even as the landmarks help sustain those groups. The Pyramid Lake Paiutes of Nevada see themselves reﬂected in Pyramid Lake and recognize their mother deity in the form of a\n\n7 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008.

The Mormon temple in downtown Salt Lake City—a granite ediﬁce from which the street grid radiates—symbolizes The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) for its members worldwide.5 For good measure, I’ll use a negative example. According to my usage, the Grand Canyon is not a landmark. Tourists come here to experience disorientation—to feel small and out of place. Like the ocean, the canyon isn’t legible as a discrete topographical feature. The eye doesn’t focus on one thing; the canyon is a vast overlapping series of scenes. While Grand Canyon National Park is a place, the canyon itself is a space. Only rangers and guides—those exceptional people who know the park not as tourists but as residents—see an array of landmarks when they gaze from the South Rim. The original concessionaire at the park recognized the need for visual anchors. In the early 1900s the Fred Harvey Company built a series of eye-catching stone buildings on the edge of the abyss.6 The tourism industry is responsible for creating and maintaining innumerable landmarks. Consider the famous 17-Mile Drive along the Paciﬁc coast near Monterey, California. The highlight of the drive, the only private toll road west of the Mississippi, is the “Lone Cypress.” This photogenic tree is the logo and registered trademark of the Pebble Beach Corporation. Although the scenic drive leads past the landmark tree, the tree wouldn’t be a landmark without the road. Thanks to the well-publicized work of licensed photographers, auto tourists come prepared to see the cypress long before it comes into view. They overlook other gnarled trees on other rocky outcroppings along the coast of California. Only because of historical contingency—the Paciﬁc Improvement Company, a subsidiary of the Southern Paciﬁc, wanted a scenic drive to complement its resort hotel (and eventual golf course) at Monterey—did this tree became the tree.7 Not every tree and rock can be a landmark; that would defeat the purpose. Landmarks are supposed to be outstanding. The question is why do they stand out? Why do certain landforms become totems while most do not? To some extent, geology and sociobiology deter-\n\n8 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008.

Humans are far more ocular than most other creatures; furthermore, certain shapes and color combinations naturally excite the human imagination. Caves (dark recesses) and mountains (bright prominences) are primordial symbols. And of the various types of mountains, volcanoes offer the best visual and imaginative material for landmarks. Lone symmetrical cones demand ocular attention. The heightened sense of place around Mount Hood and Mount Shasta seems easily explicable: these mountains have no visual competition. By contrast, numerous high peaks in the stunning Wasatch Range adjoin Mount Timpanogos. Yet somehow only this massif—not nearby Lone Peak, Cascade Peak, or Mount Nebo—has become a totem. Here, as with most places, historical contingency has far more explanatory power than environmental determinism. “Timp” came to light in a unique historical moment in the early twentieth century. That is a different matter from saying that people arbitrarily ﬁxated on Mount Timpanogos. My point is that landmarks are contingent and timebound. Few are inevitable; fewer are timeless.8 Trees die, buildings deteriorate: landmarks come and go like other mortal things. Compared to a human lifespan, a mountain will last forever; but a mountain landmark’s community of perception will sooner or later disappear, or relocate, or simply change. As the primary mode of long-distance travel shifted from animals to railroads, and from railroads to automobiles, whole sequences of roadside landmarks became unfastened. In certain cases, obsolescent travelers’ landmarks lost their physical as well as their perceptual existence. Utah’s Castle Gate once consisted of two pillars on either side of the canyon of the Price River. For late nineteenth-century railroad tourists, this “natural wonder” marked the entrance/exit to Utah. By 1966 the rock formation had become so unimportant that the Utah Department of Transportation razed one side of it to make room for a wider highway.9 With assistance, some landmarks outlast their “natural” lifespan. In 1983, when the 3,600-square-foot lighted CITGO sign above Boston’s Kenmore Square was scheduled for dismantling, Bostonians rose\n\n9 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press. All rights reserved.\n\non zion’s mount in defense of the deteriorating ﬁxture. In the years since 1965, when it was ﬁrst lit, the neon display transcended its intended community of perception and became a beloved landmark for students at Boston University and fans at Fenway Park. Under pressure from citizen groups and the Boston Landmarks Commission, the CITGO Petroleum Corporation agreed to pay for refurbishment and continuing maintenance. To this day, locals repeat the tongue-in-cheek saying “London has Big Ben; Paris has the Eiffel Tower. Boston has the CITGO sign.” Ironically, the electric sign has outlasted New England’s original elevated landmark, the Old Man of the Mountain. Starting in the 1820s, this rock formation high above Franconia Notch, New Hampshire, earned fame for its likeness to the proﬁle of a human head. In 1945 New Hampshire ofﬁcially adopted the Old Man as its emblem. The rock face appeared on letterheads, road signs, license plates, and eventually the state’s commemorative quarter. All the while, the megalith was developing structural cracks. Aware of the problem, the state paid for a reinforcement project in 1958. To ﬁrm up the granite face, workers applied bolts, cables, and epoxy (all invisible to sightseers below). Even so, in May 2003 the inevitable happened: the Old Man collapsed. People in New Hampshire responded with disbelief and grief, as if a member of the family had died. Mount Timpanogos is bigger and stronger; it won’t fall down. Neither can it be dismantled or blown up. But metaphorically, “Timp”— like all “natural” landmarks—requires its own maintenance, its own cable support. It needs our attention.\n\n^\n\nThe creation of “Timp” was one small part of two vast, interrelated geographic projects: the mapping of the nation and the shaping of the nation’s landscape. Respectively, these projects entailed the representation of terrain as bounded, gridded space and the ﬁlling of that space with mappable places—not just cities and roads and properties but things like mountain summits with ofﬁcial names and elevations.\n\n10 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008.

The natural landmarks they claimed and mapped and named (or renamed) manifested that power.10 Inescapably, the making of the National Map brought about the unmaking of indigenous geographies. In many cases, native landmarks have been omitted from the map if not literally erased from the scene. For example, Bonneville Dam, The Dalles Dam, and Grand Coulee Dam—the deﬁning features of the modern Columbia River—replaced landmark ﬁshing sites: the Cascades, Celilo Falls, and Kettle Falls. A historical cartographer could create an alternative map of the United States composed entirely of lost places and phantom place-names.11 In certain cases Native Americans have contested the destruction or reinscription of old landmarks or protested the creation of new ones. Outside their government-delineated tribal lands, Indian peoples have for the most part been stymied in their campaigns against the desecration or destruction of landmarks. In relation to sacred geography, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (1978) has proven to be a weak legal instrument. This weakness is most apparent on privately owned land. In the late 1990s, for instance, a gravel company bulldozed away portions of Woodruff Butte, or Tsimontukwi, a Hopi pilgrimage site near Holbrook, Arizona. Seen through the property owner’s eyes, the butte was merely one of numerous small cinder cones remarkable only for its high-density, low-porosity aggregate ideal for resurfacing I-40. “I didn’t realize I was destroying anything but a big ugly pile of rocks out in the big ugly middle of nowhere,” he said.12 The Black Hills region of Wyoming–South Dakota offers two instructive examples of contested landmarks on public land. Bear Lodge, better known as Devils Tower, has been a symbol for various native peoples as long as the surrounding country has been peopled. (In Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind, even space aliens use the tower as a landmark.) This quarter-mile-high monolith—the relic of a volcanic plume—rises from the earth like a char-\n\n11 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008.

Because of its “scientiﬁc interest” it became America’s ﬁrst national monument in 1906. More recently the tower has become a rock climbers’ mecca. In the 1990s climbers and Indians clashed in court over the meaning of the site. One group saw a recreational landmark; the other saw a spiritual landmark. Similarly, nearby Mount Rushmore has come to mean different things to different peoples. To most tourists—over 2 million per year— the megalith stands for the dignity of the nation. The Park Service has managed the site as a national memorial since 1933, even before sculptor Gutzon Borglum completed his dream project. Later, in the tumultuous 1970s, the memorial attracted protests by the American Indian Movement. The site has been a point of contention ever since. To native activists, Borglum’s great white heads represent the conquest of the continent and, more speciﬁcally, the theft of the Black Hills from the Lakotas. Mount Rushmore is potent because it functions simultaneously as a landmark, a symbol, and a mnemonic. It reinforces a framework of collective memory: great individuals—especially white male leaders, and most especially presidents—have advanced the destiny of America. More obvious “memory sites” such as history museums and historical markers ﬁll in that scaffolding with details from the past. Whereas museums collect memorabilia for display in exogenous spaces, markers derive their power from endogenous places: “Someone important was born here in this house” or “Many people died here at this site.” The United States is full of such commemorative signs—but not nearly as full as it could be. In the same way that societies don’t turn every feature of the Earth into landmarks, they don’t turn every aspect of the past into memories. For example, the United States commemorates far more Civil War battleﬁelds than Indian massacre sites. Collective memory involves forgetting as much as remembering. Societies, like individuals, forget passively when they make no effort to remember or when their attention gets diverted. Less often, societies choose to forget. They erase or suppress historical knowledge\n\n12 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008.

A combination of passive and active forgetting explains the fading of the Lake Utes in the collective memory of the second-generation Mormon residents of Utah Valley. The LDS Church and its early ofﬁcial historians—and later folk historians—mythologized Utah’s pioneer period. Discordant pieces of the past were discarded incidentally or buried deliberately. The Indianness of Mount Timpanogos resulted from the separate implantation of false memories: the Indians of Utah Valley were mountain worshipers who lived here sometime in the distant past before the Mormon pioneers planted a stake in a desert wilderness. “Timp” is a special kind of memory site—a monument to forgetfulness.13 I don’t mean to be overly negative. Certainly it is good for people to love their home topography. We live in an increasingly “placeless” world in which landscapes are fungible. Like so many other metropolitan areas, the built environment of Provo-Orem has increasingly come to look like “Anywhere, U.S.A.”—the familiar matrix of freeways, storage units, strip malls, and chain stores. In this context, the distinctive sense of place constructed and maintained around “Timp” is beneﬁcent. However, beneﬁcent is different from innocent. In settler nations such as the United States, belonging to place is a privilege that comes with possession.14 To my knowledge, Utah Indians have not contested the Indianness of “Timp”; to the contrary, certain Utes have recently cooperated in it. That is one irony. Another is that the LDS Church, the main architect of collective memory in Utah, made this book—this countermemorial—possible thanks to its assiduous preservation of archival sources.15\n\n^\n\nEveryone engages in place-making and memory-making. The American history offered in the following pages has implications for all nations founded by colonial settler societies. Viewed in national context, “Timp” can be seen as a generic Euro-American settlers’\n\n13 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press. All rights reserved.\n\non zion’s mount landmark as well as a distinctively Mormon creation. A place, like a person, cannot be understood by itself. A place has no meaning except in relation to other places. That is the reason why much of this book, whose starting point is Utah, looks at landmarks elsewhere, why its concern with local history is framed larger.16 By being typical and exceptional at the same time, Utah offers a valuable perspective on the United States. The religious element is of course distinctive, yet the main story of Utah’s formation—settlers colonizing Indian land, organizing a territory, dispossessing natives, and achieving statehood—could not be more American. Even so, the Great Basin, the Mormons’ region of settlement, remains outside the purview of mainstream American history. This relationship is best explained by geographic metaphors. The Great Basin is that large piece of North America that has no outlet to the sea. Its runoff ﬂows inward, where it pools and evaporates. So it is with Utah history. Because of the LDS stronghold in Utah, and because of the LDS emphasis on history, the state sustains a steady ﬂow of scholarship. However, the water lacks proper turbidity. It’s unnaturally pure because so many historians have ﬁltered out non-Mormons and native peoples. Because of provincialism, scholars of Utah rarely push beyond the rim of their basin. They write for an audience of Mormons. History pools at their feet; their stream never reaches the ocean. Meanwhile, in the seaboard cities where opinion generally takes shape, most U.S. historians ignore Utah history and Mormon history. In their coast-to-coast historical surveys, scholars may occasionally glance down, may even notice a curious patch of blue—an inland sea of history. Yet whether through prejudice or indifference, they rarely descend for a closer look. They should. The Great Basin is the perfect place to be disorientated and reoriented.17 As your guide, I offer an insider-outsider perspective. Ironically, doing local history forced me to leave my home state, Utah. In order to write a biography of a local mountain, I had to learn its remote genealogy; I had to become familiar with precedent landmarks and the people who maintained them. By tracing the lineage of “Timp,” I\n\n14 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008.

This book revisits the terrain of the past in a sequence of three parallel narratives. Each begins long ago (late eighteenth or early nineteenth century) and continues to the near present. Part I is bioregional history; the setting is the eastern Great Basin—what is now called the Wasatch Front. Here I reconstruct the water-based geography of what used to be called “Utah Lake Valley” and illustrate the former centrality of Utah Lake and its ﬁsh to indigenous peoples. I narrate the great American story of the colonization of the Great Basin by the Latterday Saints under Brigham Young, a migration that had devastating consequences for the Lake Utes. Then I outline the gradual process by which Utah Lake became diluted as a ﬁshery, a resort, and a symbol. Next I have divided the cultural geomorphology of Mount Timpanogos—Utah Lake’s foil—into complementary halves. Part II resembles local history; the main setting is Provo, Utah. After providing background on Mormons and mountains, I explore why and how people from one particular city afﬁliated themselves with one particular mountain in the early twentieth century. My cast of characters includes surveyors and painters and particularly hikers; the protagonist is Eugene Roberts, director of athletics at BYU in the 1910s and 1920s, who promoted “Timp” through a mass annual hike. I then discuss the enduring legacy of Roberts’ promotional project in the late twentieth century.18 Part III moves away from the linear and the local. It might be described as extralocal history. Here I move back and forth in time and space to show how Roberts and his collaborators marked “Timp” with Indianness. Euro-Americans have often expressed their desire to feel native by “playing Indian.” This cultural tradition has a geographic component. I discuss numerous U.S. landmarks—some familiar, others forgotten—that have been popularly associated with Native Americans. Many of these places functioned as prototypes for Mount Timpanogos. In this discussion, collective bodies—“American culture” and “Mormon culture”—serve as the chief actors.

Indians also reappear here—sometimes as actual people but more often as cultural constructions or as ghosts. I underscore how the place-stories and storied places created by colonizers are persistently haunted by the colonized.19 In the end, this book is about understanding home. It shows how settlers gave meaning to the lands they settled, and how their progeny developed an attachment to place—in other words, how nonnatives became neonatives.20 Utah offers a powerful case study because only here can we ﬁnd a colonial U.S. population that speaks of having a “homeland” in the Native American sense—an endemic spiritual geography. They call it Zion. That the establishment of the Mormon homeland in Utah occurred in tandem with the diminishment of native peoples and places may be discomforting enough. But I must prod further. Mormonism, a religion indigenous to the United States, originally embraced American Indians as spiritual kin, or “Lamanites.” Metaphysically and geographically, this religion reserved a privileged place for natives. But prophecies, dreams, and intentions never quite become realities. In high relief, Utah history exposes an unsettling incongruity of U.S. history: the senses of place that make present-day Americans feel at home would not exist without past displacements. Wherever we live, we live among landmarks—topographic relics from the human past. This book will, I hope, help all of us to survey our homes with new eyes. This matters. What we see affects what we do. The mountains and valleys of the American West have been altered by visions. The great westerner Wallace Stegner wished that his home region might someday have “a society to match its scenery.”21 From my vantage point, I see the reverse. Our scenery has always matched our society—for better and for worse.\n\n16 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008.

Compared to the rest of the Great Basin, the homeland of the Fish-Eaters was muniﬁcent. Its reputation spread to New Mexico even before 1776, the year that traveling Franciscans put the place on the map. Following this entrada, the Lake People became more involved in the Spanish colonial trade system. In exchange for pelts and slaves, they acquired horses. The Timpanogos leader Walkara rode this way of life to fame and wealth and power. This equestrian pioneer ventured as far as the Paciﬁc and the Plains. At spawning time, however, Walkara knew to return to the lake. Even after the horse revolution, this was the place. In 1847 an exotic group of pioneers began to coalesce in the Great Basin. Led by Brigham Young, these religious refugees came in search of a home. Young wanted a “place apart” where his faction of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints could be made into a people. Strategically, he settled for the next-best place, Salt Lake Valley, located immediately to the north. The Mormon vanguard meant to get acclimated before attempting a full-scale colonization of the Ba-\n\nOn Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008.

Unwittingly as well as deliberately, the Salt Lake settlers set the stage for a new revolution.\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press.

Centered on Nevada, the Basin also includes half of Utah, large pieces of California and Oregon, and bits of Idaho and Wyoming. The southern and northern boundaries are difﬁcult to see with the naked eye, but the western and eastern boundaries—the Sierra Nevada and the Wasatch Range— stand out majestically. The Basin is everything between. This is the interior space of the inland West, a closed system cut off from the drainages of the Columbia and the Colorado. “In this strange region all nature seems to be reversed,” wrote a nineteenth-century observer.1 Many streams go parch in midcourse. The larger, more persevering streams push on to pseudoseas. Pulled by gravity, they descend to their lowest reachable points, or sinks. In some places, like Badwater, Death Valley, the sink lies below sea level. After a storm a salt-encrusted sink may transform into a lagoon, only to revert in the next warm spell. A few wet spots, such as the Great Salt Lake and Pyramid Lake, are nonephemeral. “Permanent” is not quite right, since the shape of these water bodies changes by year and by season. No verdure adorns the brackish, gnat-infested shores. The deathly beautiful lakes of the Great Basin attract less attention than the truly dead ones, called playas. Racers go to the Bonneville Salt Flats of the Great Salt Lake Desert to set land speed records; this ﬂat, stark landscape also lures cinematographers. The annual neohippie festival called Burning Man brings tens of thousands to the Black Rock Desert of Nevada—a dried mudﬂat, a geomemory of a departed lake. The land hasn’t always been like this. In the wetter, cooler Pleistocene epoch, the Great Basin had literal playas—beaches—all around. Sinks ﬁlled up, spilled over; coalescence resulted in twin lakes on the\n\n20 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008.

In the west, Lake Lahontan covered 8,700 square miles in the ﬂats beyond present-day Reno. Lahontan’s eastern counterpart, Lake Bonneville, topped out at 20,000 square miles with a maximum depth of 1,200 feet. After the ancient Bear River changed its course and became a tributary, Lake Bonneville tried to grow even bigger. Like a squid, it sent tentacles in every direction; one of these pushed its way through a natural levee at Red Rock Pass in southeastern Idaho. Here, about 14,500 years ago, occurred one of the notable ﬂoods in Earth’s history; in one event, Bonneville lost about one quarter of its surface area. The postdiluvian lake stabilized at the “Provo Level”—still deep enough to submerge Provo and every other modern city on the Wasatch Front. Over the next few thousand years the climate changed, and Bonneville receded, leaving behind residual lakes and one giant bathtub ring called the Provo Bench. It is part of the larger Bonneville Bench—a vertical zone of ancient lake terraces that provides the only transition from the smooth valleys to the steep mountains. Even today there is a mirrored similarity between the Lahontan and the Bonneville drainage systems. On the Nevada side, an upland freshwater lake (Tahoe) discharges into a river (the Truckee) that descends to the desert, where it empties into a salty inland sea (Pyramid Lake). Likewise, on the Utah side, the deep mountain Bear Lake contributes inﬂow to the Great Salt Lake. But the modern Bonneville system possesses one striking difference—Utah Lake. This is the one unsalted lake in the lowlands of the Great Basin. Fur traders called it Sweetwater Lake. In a desert characterized as much by salinity as by aridity, Utah Lake remains (relatively) fresh and constant. It beneﬁts from inﬂow and outﬂow. After accepting snowmelt from the high country, the lake functions as a catchment basin or natural reservoir for the Great Salt Lake, which sits at a slightly lower elevation. The land immediately surrounding Utah Lake is now known as Utah Valley. In this case the word “valley” is somewhat misleading, suggesting as it does a ﬂuvial depression between two stretches of high ground. Utah Valley looks more like an enclosure. Immediately\n\n21 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press.

On the western side of the graben, discontinuous hills obstruct the view of the “West Desert” and the Great Salt Lake (to the north). Without these minor uplifts, Utah Valley would look more like the terrain at Boulder, Colorado—a ﬂatland against the peaks. But the western hills are sufﬁciently large to complete the sense of containment. The enclosed space is crescent-shaped. From tip to tip it runs about forty-ﬁve miles; across the middle it measures twelve miles. The base elevation is 4,500 feet above sea level. The westcentral section of the crescent is submerged by the lake, which has an area of roughly 150 square miles. The water is shallow, rarely more than 10 feet deep. Two important rivers, the Provo and the Spanish Fork, end their journeys here. Several local streams also discharge their ﬂows. Historically, springs and marshes ringed the lake, providing habitat for migratory birds and wetland mammals. Within the lake, native ﬁsh—suckers, chubs, and cutthroat trout—made the water quake. No other area of the Great Basin boasted such a variety of aquatic resources. It was here in 1844 that the Great Basin received its name. Rumors of a landlocked drainage system had circulated for decades, but few explorers accepted the possibility; the idea seemed “Asiatic,” not American. People kept looking for the river that should have been there, some hidden tributary of the Columbia, some long arm of San Francisco Bay. On maps, this mythical river went by the name “Buenaventura” or “Multnomah.” Not until John C. Frémont circumambulated the inland West on his Second Expedition were these geographical fantasies put to rest. Returning to his starting point, Utah Lake, on 25 May 1844, Frémont completed his “circuit” and pronounced the existence of a “rare and singular feature—that of the Great interior Basin.”2 A later explorer, James Simpson, complained that Frémont’s terminology was “erroneous.” Something called a basin, Simpson wrote, “must, as a whole, present a generally concave surface.” He had a\n\n22 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nUte Genesis, Mormon Exodus\n\npoint: the Great Basin looks more like a washboard than a sink. A succession of parallel faults between the Sierra Nevada and the Wasatch has created a stunningly repetitive topography of horsts (upfaulted mountains) and grabens (down-faulted valleys). “While the so-called Great Basin is in some small degree a basin of lakes and streams,” Simpson continued, “it is pre-eminently a basin of mountains and valleys.”3 No comparable region of the Earth contains more mountain ranges. Nevada alone is home to 314 ranges, all of which trend north-south. Many exceed 10,000 feet in elevation. Just as the Sierra Nevada casts a rain shadow over an entire region, each horst steals moisture from winter Paciﬁc storms away from the next graben to the east. Geologically, the Great Basin belongs to the larger “Basin and Range Province” that stretches from upper Mexico to Oregon. In the southern part of the Great Basin, the ranges are comparatively low, and the vegetation aligns with two “hot deserts”—the Mojave and the Colorado. But the better part of the Basin in Nevada and Utah has its own ﬂora, its own ecozone. Here, in the Great Basin Desert, high-elevation plants have adapted to extreme seasonal ﬂuctuations in temperature. The emblematic plants of this “cold desert” are specimens of toughness: sagebrush, shadscale, juniper, bristlecone. The native inhabitants of the Basin adapted to this environment of extremes. When the ﬁrst Europeans arrived, the Great Basin was peopled almost exclusively by members of one linguistic group, the Numa. The Numic language is a branch of the Uto-Aztecan family spoken by peoples from the American Southwest to central Mexico. Numic divides into three groups—Western, Central, and Southern— each of which once included numerous dialects. According to one prominent theory, Numic-speaking peoples migrated northeast from the Death Valley region roughly one millennium ago. Arriving in the eastern Great Basin around 1200, they replaced, displaced, or absorbed the ancient people now called the Fremont Culture. The invaders were the ancestors of today’s Utes and Paiutes (Southern Numic speakers) as well as today’s Shoshones (Central Numic speakers). Before the introduction of the horse, all the Numa practiced similar\n\n23 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008.

This fact is remarkable: similarities in language do not always align with similarities in culture, nor do shared environments necessarily produce shared cultures. Historically, the Great Basin was one of those rare regions where language, culture, and environment reinforced one another. For this reason, historical anthropologists and archaeologists use the term “Great Basin culture area.”4 By all four deﬁnitions—hydrographic, physiographic, ﬂoristic, cultural—Utah Valley belongs to the Great Basin. However, its location at the edge of the Basin made it unusually attractive to the Numa and to American settlers alike. The Basin is not uniform. As Major Frémont wrote, “It is called a desert, and, from what I saw of it, sterility may be its prominent characteristic; but where there is so much water, there must be some oasis.”5 And indeed there are several oases scattered in the middle (for example, the Ruby Marshes) and two broad oasis zones bordering the Wasatch Range and the Sierra Nevada. This hydrography explains the placement of Salt Lake City– Provo and Reno–Carson City. Even before American settlers arrived, these mountain-front oasis zones sustained relatively large populations; the Numa developed ﬁshing cultures at Pyramid and Utah Lakes. In time, outsiders coveted these well-watered places—or just the water. The Great Basin culture area’s most densely populated locale, the valley of Owens Lake, was deprived of its water in the early twentieth century, when Los Angeles breached the Great Basin with giant suction tubes. Over several decades in the same century, federal funding enabled Salt Lake City to engineer the converse, the importation of Colorado River water to supplement its existing oasis. In short, the Great Basin proved to be permeable at its moist edges— for people as well as for water. Because of its position, Utah Valley was a desirable access point for Indians and Europeans.\n\n^\n\nIn 1776 ofﬁcials in New Spain authorized an expedition to ﬁnd an overland route from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to Monterey, Califor-\n\n24 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008.

Even as the king of England witnessed the erosion of British America, the king of Spain worked to shore up the margins of his American empire. The Spanish entrusted the expedition to two friars, Francisco Atanasio Domínguez and Francisco Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, who also wanted new souls to save. More than most people, the colonial Spanish conﬂated spiritual and material gain. Since the sixteenth century, quixotic Spaniards had looked for the Seven Cities of Gold on the Southern Plains. This mythical region came to be known as Quivira. West of Quivira and north of New Mexico lay another mythical province, the Land of Teguayo. Supposedly the ancestors of the Aztecs emerged from caverns in this prosperous land beside a great lake called Teguayo or Copala. Rumor had it that the inhabitants of Lake Copala walked around with golden jewelry on their wrists and arms and ears. To the extent that this geographical fantasy had any basis in reality, Copala referred to Utah Lake or the Great Salt Lake. Eventually the Spaniards devised a general name for the owners of this country: the Yutas.6 Historically, all Southern Numic speakers referred to themselves as Nuche, “The People.” However, there was no metasociety to match this meta-identity—no kingdom or nation or confederation. In the protohistoric period, individual Utes had no ﬁxed identity beyond the large-scale speech community and the small-scale family cluster or band. A cluster might be as small as one married couple, their children, and some relatives from both sides. Related bands who practiced the same subsistence strategy in the same locale could be identiﬁed by geographic “food names.” For example, Numa living in drier areas referred to the various Nuche bands of Utah Lake as “Lake People” (Pawanutch) or “Fish-Eaters” (Tumpanawach). The Fish-Eaters did not constitute a tribe, however; identity was ﬂexible. Over a lifetime an individual could pass from one band to another, from one place to another, from one subsistence to another, from one name to another, even from one language to another. Southern Numic speakers (Nuche) sometimes crossed over to bands of Central Numic speakers (Neme). The Fish-Eaters of Utah Valley referred to Neme\n\n25 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008.

All rights reserved.\n\non zion’s mount bands collectively as Kumantsi (the source of the name “Comanche”), meaning “Left-Handed Ones.” The term implied relatedness: lefthanded people, though different from right-handed ones, still belonged with The People. Thinking historically, it is useful to imagine a Numic continuum on which boundaries were drawn, erased, redrawn, and eventually made permanent. Until the U.S. government mandated tribal rolls, individuals could move across these boundaries with relative ease.7 Lake People/Fish-Eaters clustered along the streams that fed into Utah Lake. The most important ﬁshing and wintering site was the mouth of the Provo River. The bands that used this location as their home base called themselves Timpanogos, referring to the “rocky river” in which they ﬁshed. Expert ﬁshers, the Timpanogos Nuche used tools of harvest such as woven squawbush nets, willow weirs, spears, and bows. At spawning time in spring, the Timpanogos clubbed masses of ﬁsh to death, shot them with arrows, trapped them in weirs, or wrestled them out with bare hands. The ﬁsh could be eaten raw, cooked, or dried. Sacks of dried ﬁsh were buried for storage. Anthropologists estimate that ﬁsh accounted for 30 percent of the Timpanogos diet—twice as much as for the Utes of western Colorado.8 Even so, a lot of calories had to come from other sources. Spring was a ﬂeeting season of abundance. In the summer the Timpanogos retreated to the mountains to gather serviceberries and elderberries. In the late summer and fall some of the men stayed in the high country to hunt big game while others returned to the valley to harvest seeds as well as crickets and locusts, using ﬁre to corral the protein-rich insects. The hunters returned to the lake for the fall migration of birds. Winter brought the lean days. For long stretches, the Timpanogos had to get by with dried ﬁsh reserves, roots and bulbs, and “desert fruitcake”—a power bar made of berries, ground insects, and animal fat. Until the early 1800s Utah Lake and Salt Lake Valleys supported small herds of “Western bison,” a smaller form of the Plains bison. Unfortunately, this valuable source of food and raiment fell victim to\n\n26 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008.

The son of one of Utah Valley’s prominent Mormon settlers remembered a story told in the 1850s by Sowiette, leader of an equestrian Nuche band: “He said one time when he was a young man, (about forty years previously,) the buffalo and deer were as thick as the Mormons’ cattle, sweeping his hand in that direction [toward Utah Lake], but that a deep snow fell as deep as to the ceiling, pointing to the ceiling eight feet high, which killed them all off. The indians camped that winter at the lake border, and by cutting holes thru the ice cought ﬁsh, which added to the scant provisions and tided them over the ‘cold and cruel winter.’”9 Because of its stable ﬁsh resource, Utah Valley was the most densely populated place in the eastern Great Basin. The valley supported several (the exact number is unknown) semipermanent villages composed of wickiups made of bulrush and willow. At critical moments in the food calendar, especially winter and late spring, the Timpanogos (Provo) River hosted hundreds of people. Like all major encampments, this one had multiple men of authority—a leader for war, a leader for diplomacy, and at least one to direct subsistence activities like ﬁshing. Every April or May, at spawning time, the riverside village hosted various bands of Nuche from other regions. The gathered peoples (perhaps 1,000 in number) performed the Bear Dance, a sacred springtime festival. This was also a time for marriage and other forms of social reorganization. The family-cluster system permitted countless permutations. The feast-or-famine environment of the Great Basin encouraged social ﬂexibility.10 Despite its central importance, Utah Lake marked the outer edge of the vast territory inhabited by Nuche. Speakers of Southern Numic could be found as far south as the Colorado River and as far east as the Front Range. People in different subregions experienced different histories. Anthropologists and historians draw a time-bound distinction between the bands in the east (in present-day Colorado) and the bands in the west (in present-day Utah). The distinction turns more on subsistence strategy than on geography. The mountain Utes adopted the horse more quickly and more thoroughly. In 1598 Span-\n\n27 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press. All rights reserved.\n\non zion’s mount iards (re)introduced equines to North America; in 1680 they lost control of the horse trade when Indians along the Rio Grande revolted against colonial rule. Even before the Pueblo Revolt, local Navajos, Apaches, and Utes made a habit of rustling. In this way the “Eastern Utes” of the Rocky Mountains became horse people well over a century before the “Western Utes” of the Great Basin. After adopting the horse, the eastern bands hunted bison on the Plains and took on some of the features of the new Plains Indian culture. Because of their participation in New Mexican trade networks, these bands were sometimes collectively called “Taos Yutas.”11 Why did the Utes of the Great Basin take a different path to horse ownership? They certainly did not lack imagination or access. After the Pueblo Revolt, equines spread quickly to the Northern Plains and the Snake River country. The latter region belonged to the Neme. In the eighteenth century some Neme bands used their new mounts to emigrate to the Southern Plains, where they created a new ethnic identity as Comanches. Other Neme bands used horses to consolidate their existing homeland. These equestrians—people now called Northern Shoshones—rubbed against Blackfeet to the north and Utes to the south. Utah Valley lay immediately to the south of Neme territory. And this borderland was also a crossroads. Bison-hunting equestrians used the Provo and Spanish Fork Rivers as pathways to the Wind River country and the Uinta Basin. In short, Utah Valley was hardly isolated. The Lake Utes must have been aware of the beneﬁts and, more importantly, the costs of equestrianism. Horse lords became servants to their steeds, constantly moving in search of fresh grass. Presented with this way of life, the Fish-Eaters remained committed to their tried-and-true homebound subsistence strategy throughout the eighteenth century. But eventually a combination of threat (from Shoshones) and opportunity (from Spaniards) made them rethink their commitment.12 The journal of Domínguez and Escalante provides an invaluable glimpse into this time of transition. In 1776 the Lake People still lacked horses, but they had begun to establish trade connections with\n\n28 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008.

Tellingly, the friars encountered some “Lagunas” (Lake People) a great distance from their laguna. In late August, along the Gunnison River in present-day western Colorado, the Spaniards came across a Fish-Eater traveling with some “Sabuagana” Utes. The friars told the group that they came not to trade or plunder but to ﬁnd a way to the “pueblos” of the Lagunas. The natives warned them about the “Yamparika,” hostile mounted warriors whom they would encounter in the Uinta Basin. Worse yet, the way was rough and dry. Domínguez and Escalante needed assistance. With a prepayment of goods, they convinced the Fish-Eater they called Silvestre to guide them on their journey. A few days later the fathers met some more Lagunas, including a boy they called Joaquín who joined the expedition. With Silvestre’s help, Domínguez and Escalante traveled safely across the Uinta Basin. This motley group of Spaniards, New Mexicans, and Indians inspired great fear in the locals: when scouts from Utah Valley spied a mounted party headed in their direction, the Lake People defensively started burning the grassland at the mouth of Spanish Fork Canyon. Anxiety turned to happiness on 23 September 1776. Amid the smoke, Silvestre explained the situation to his people. A general council of the various lakeside villages was called. The friars presented gifts and explained (through Silvestre) that they wished to return and establish a permanent presence in the valley. In exchange for the Indians’ acceptance of Christianity, the priests would teach them how to farm and raise livestock. Instead of deerskin and rabbit fur, the indios would have clothing just like the Spaniards’. According to Domínguez and Escalante, the Timpanogos people welcomed the offer and told them to come back soon. The natives were “very poor as regards to dress” but exhibited an “easy-going character.” As a token of goodwill toward the king of Spain, the Lagunas presented the friars with a painting done in red ocher on deerskin. It depicted the valley’s four main leaders with little Christian crosses on their skin. One of the painted ﬁgures was none other than Silvestre, whose Numic name meant “Great Talker.”13\n\n29 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008.

All rights reserved.\n\non zion’s mount Because of the lateness of the season, Domínguez and Escalante did not tarry as long as they wanted. After buying some dried ﬁsh, they turned southward. A few weeks later they abandoned their journey to California and returned—after a near-disastrous fording of the Colorado River—to Santa Fe. Their report comes across not as failed trip to the ocean but as a successful visit to a great lake. The friars had only good things to say about the Lagunas, who were “very simple, docile, gentle, and affectionate.” Domínguez and Escalante likewise spoke highly of the Timpanogos homeland, which “abounds in several species of good ﬁsh, geese, beavers, and other amphibious creatures.” The expedition’s cartographer, Bernardo de Miera, was more effusive. In a letter to the king he offered his vision of a “new empire” between Santa Fe and Monterey. The base of operations should be the Lake of the Timpanogos, he wrote, “because this place is the most pleasant, beautiful and fertile in all of New Spain.” The valley here could “support a city with as large a population as that of Mexico City.”14 Needless to say, this vision was not fulﬁlled. Domínguez and Escalante never even returned to Utah Valley. Crown ofﬁcials focused their expansion efforts on Alta California, and even that project exceeded their resources. Throughout the Spanish period the Great Basin remained beyond the reach of colonial rule. It was not, however, immune from the effects of colonialism. By connecting New Mexico to the Great Basin, the entrada of Domínguez and Escalante hastened the horse revolution among the Western Utes. Traders followed the friars. Despite repeated edicts prohibiting unlicensed trade with the Yutas, many enterprising New Mexicans brought horses along the Domínguez-Escalante trail. In exchange for the animals, the traders accepted two kinds of commodities: pelts and slaves. In an 1813 court case, Mauricio Arze and several companions admitted they had spent several days trading at Utah Lake. Their testimony suggested that this practice was routine. According to Arze, the Timpanogos wanted only one thing—to trade people for horses. Arze claimed to have refused. In response, the Indians began to slaughter\n\n30 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008.

Thus Arze was “forced” to obtain twelve slaves along with 109 animal skins.15 This account demonstrates a key point: the new animal trade between the Great Basin and New Mexico was based on human violence. Sometime around 1800 the Timpanogos Nuche joined the longestablished Spanish slave system. Spaniards bought infants, children, and especially adolescent girls, who were often already the victims of rape. Once baptized in New Mexico, the captives joined society as servants. As genízaros (detribalized Indians), these homeless excaptives occupied the bottom rung of the New Mexican caste system. Over time the genízaros created a new transethnic community of bewildering diversity. The slave trade ensnared people from every group in the Southern Plains and greater Southwest—Puebloans, Athabaskans, Shoshoneans—before reaching its violent climax in the eastern Great Basin. Once they obtained horses, the Lake People—following the lead of other mounted Yutas—preyed on their Neme and Nuche neighbors in the deserts of present-day western and southwestern Utah. Through coerced purchases or outright kidnappings, hundreds of youngsters lost all contact with home.16 These anonymous victims are normally categorized under modern names: “Paiutes” and “Goshutes.” Tellingly, these tribal identities originated in the context of slavery. In the new world made by horses, economic difference replaced linguistic difference as the key cultural boundary. Mounted Western Utes became more like their Neme rivals, the mounted Northern Shoshones. Up and down the rim of the Great Basin, horse ownership created a hierarchy of bands. On top stood the full equestrians, collectively known to English speakers as “Utahs” (Utes) and “Snakes” (Shoshones). The horse economy permitted larger, more stable social groupings. Leaders of these horserich bands acted more like “chiefs.” The second tier was occupied by smaller bands that acquired some horses without becoming horse people. The Nuche of San Pete Valley in south-central Utah exempliﬁed this intermediate lifeway. Certain bands based at Utah Lake may have ﬁtted this proﬁle, too. Pedestrian bands existed at the bottom. On the\n\n31 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press. All rights reserved.\n\non zion’s mount Neme side, these horseless groups became known as “Diggers” or “Goshutes”; on the Nuche side, the equivalent terms were “Piedes” or “Paiutes.” By the mid-nineteenth century, this native caste system became the basis of ﬁxed ethnic identities. It became harder—though not impossible—for individuals to cross boundaries. For example, pedestrian Paiutes were deﬁned in opposition to equestrian Utes, and vice versa, even though they spoke the same language. When Americans came on the scene in the 1840s, they misperceived time-bound power relations as the natural order of things. They explained the pedestrian people’s timidity and poverty with environmental determinism. The earliest U.S. maps of the Great Basin—then called the Great Sandy Plain—indicated that the interior residents of this wasteland were “the most miserable objects in creation.” “The whole idea of such a desert, and such a people, is a novelty in our country, and excites Asiatic, not American ideas,” wrote John C. Frémont. He identiﬁed these un-American Indians as “Diggers,” a word that implied subsistence based on roots and bulbs. Not coincidentally, it rhymed with “Niggers.” The epithets were related in meaning. In the 1850s Anglo travelers sometimes likened the people of the western desert to “old negro women” and orangutans. Captain James Simpson believed that the “Goshoots” illustrated a physical truism: “That the contour, relief, and relative position of the crust of the earth is intimately connected with the development of man.” In the South, Americans used ideas of place and race to defend the enslavement of Africans. In the Great Basin, related ideas of place and race allowed Americans to overlook the effects of Indian slavery.17 Horses and guns gave Western Utes the power to enslave; and these same things gave them the power to expand. By the time Mexico gained independence in 1821, it seems, mounted Nuche had wrested control of the Uinta Basin from Shoshone bands. The newfound power of the “Eutaws” was apparent to the American fur traders who inﬁltrated the eastern Great Basin in the early years of the Mexican period. “They are, by far,” wrote Warren Angus Ferris, “the most expert horsemen in the mountains.” It became customary for Eutaws to\n\n32 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nUte Genesis, Mormon Exodus\n\ndemand tribute from non-Indians passing through their lands. Wise travelers paid up. Armed and mounted, the Eutaws looked intimidating. In 1825, when William Ashley encountered a Western Ute band in the Uinta Basin, he found himself “much supprised at the appearance of these people.” They were clothed in buffalo robes, armed with English riﬂes, and ornamented with pearls and seashells. They met Ashley “with great familiarity and Ease of manner.” In August of the next year Jedediah Smith made a treaty with the “principal Chief” of the Lake Utahs “by which the americans are allowed to hunt & trap in and pass through their country unmolested.” At the time, these Fish-Eaters were gathering serviceberries in the mountains. Smith stayed two days in their camp, which consisted of thirty-ﬁve “lodges” or families, each with “4 or 5 horses.” The animals signiﬁed wealth and prestige. “The Uta’s are cleanly quiet and active and make a nearer approach to civilized life than any Indians I have seen in the Interior,” wrote Smith in admiration.18 The 1830s marked the decline of the fur trade and the rise of another regional trade system, the “Old Spanish Trail.” This name, though ingrained in the historical literature, is anachronistic, since the trail was used mainly between 1830 and 1850—the last two-thirds of the Mexican period. The trail connected Santa Fe and Los Angeles through trade. Great annual caravans carried New Mexican serapes to California and returned with horses and mules. Along the way, traders acquired slaves to sell to buyers at both ends of the trail. From its Paciﬁc terminus, the trail went up Cajon Pass, across the Mojave, and along the western escarpment of the central Utah cordillera before making a wide southward turn across the Wasatch high country and along the edges of the canyonlands. After crossing the Green and Colorado Rivers at present-day Green River, Utah, and Moab, Utah, the trail skirted the San Juan Mountains before dropping into Santa Fe. For Western Utes, New Mexico–bound pack trains presented opportunities for tribute, trade, and theft.19 Inspired by the sight of healthy, well-fed California steeds, some got the idea of raiding from the source. The most famous of these horse\n\n33 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008.

Most of the information on his early life comes secondhand via Dimick Huntington, a Mormon interpreter who dealt extensively with Walkara in the late 1840s and early 1850s. Walkara was born sometime around 1810 in Utah Valley. Chances are his father, a band leader, never traveled far from the lake. The scale of Walkara’s world was much larger. After inheriting a position of leadership, he withdrew from the Timpanogos scene. He developed a horse-based rather than a place-based economy. Equestrianism demanded nomadism. Over the decade of the 1840s Walkara, his herd, and his band—a ﬂuid group of men, women, and children that included Nuche from many places—were almost always on the move. In the winter they often raided horses in California; in the summer they sometimes hunted bison on the Plains. At points between they sold horses and slaves. Walkara’s band numbered around 100 or 150 people, with changing personnel. When John C. Frémont met them in 1844, they were “all mounted, armed with riﬂes, and use their riﬂes well.” Frémont considered them “robbers of a higher order” who “conducted their depredations with form, and under the color of trade and toll for passing through their country.” AngloAmericans gave Walkara strange honoriﬁcs that expressed a mixture of respect and contempt—“Napoleon of the Desert,” “the Indian Land Pirate,” “Hawk of the Mountains,” “King of the Mountains,” “Mr. Eutaw,” and “Soldan [Sultan] of the Red Paynims.” By one account, Walkara cut a striking ﬁgure with “a full suit of the richest broadcloth, generally brown, cut in European fashion, with a shining beaver hat, and a ﬁne cambric shirt” adorned with “gaudy Indian trimmings.” His “richly caparisoned horses” shone and tinkled with “gay metal ornaments.” When this living legend died in 1855, he was entombed with his belongings, including sacriﬁcial horses and slaves.20 Walkara personiﬁed the transformation of the Lake People in the half-century following Domínguez and Escalante. But he did not exemplify that change. Walkara lived outside the norm. No other Western Ute leader embraced equestrianism and nomadism so thoroughly.\n\n34 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nUte Genesis, Mormon Exodus\n\nThe other mounted bands of Timpanogos Nuche modiﬁed but did not abandon their place-based economy. Horses were important, but so were ﬁsh. Tellingly, even Walkara’s grand circuits pivoted on the pastures and ﬁshing grounds of the Timpanogos River. This was his critical replenishment stop. The springtime spawn remained the central event in the Timpanogos calendar. Even in a time of change, some things didn’t change.\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press.

In 1847 a new frontier would be created by the westward exodus of foreigners. Upstate New York in the mid-1820s was a place of high expectations. A miracle of engineering, the Erie Canal, had been completed with great fanfare. Another kind of miracle seemed imminent. The towns along the western reaches of the canal became known as the “burnt-over district” because so many born-again preachers blazed through. During the Second Great Awakening—a collective term for the episodic but widespread revivals that swept the nation in the early 1800s—evangelicals gained faith in Jesus Christ and in his impending return. The Second Coming would end the world and restart time by ushering in the Millennium. Numerous millenarian groups blossomed in the antebellum United States. The now-forgotten Millerites determined the precise date of Christ’s return—22 October 1844 (a day subsequently known as the “Great Disappointment”). The SeventhDay Adventists trace their lineage to this evangelical enthusiasm for the End Days. So do the Mormons, whose millenarian expectations are reﬂected in their formal name, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The founder of the LDS Church, Joseph Smith Jr., came of age in Palmyra, New York. A young farm boy with a propensity for spiritual pursuits—including the use of seer stones to seek buried treasure— Joseph felt excited and troubled by the competing revivals. He prayed for guidance. Like many seekers at the time, Smith received a heav-\n\n35 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press. All rights reserved.\n\non zion’s mount enly visitation from the Lord Jesus Christ. But Smith’s visions continued for the rest of his life. They were unusually powerful and detailed. He was instructed to reject all preachers. He learned that he had been chosen to found a new church that was really an old one—the original one true church of Christ. John the Baptist and later Peter, James, and John descended from heaven to confer the “keys” of the ancient priesthood to the farmer-prophet. On other occasions Smith met Moses and Elijah. But Joseph Smith’s most regular visitor was the Angel Moroni, who showed him where to ﬁnd the ultimate buried treasure, a bound collection of engraved metal plates that contained a new scriptural record. Smith translated the plates using a seer stone and published the translation as the Book of Mormon in 1830, the same year he organized the LDS Church. Even in an age of religious innovation, this new religion stood out. It boasted a prophet who received continuous revelation, a scripture that offered proof of his revelatory powers, and nothing less than the restoration of the ancient priesthood and the primitive church. Over the next decade and a half, Smith added even more: a temple ceremony, plural marriage, a radical theology of the afterlife, and a blueprint for a communitarian economy (called the “Law of Consecration” or the “Order of Enoch”). From the perspective of the Great Basin, Smith’s most important innovation was “the gathering.” In essence, early Mormons were Christian Zionists. The Prophet planned for his followers to gather at one consecrated place where they would build the temple of the New Jerusalem. “It sounds strange to hear of a church having a ‘location,’” commented Charles Dickens. “But a ‘location’ was the term they applied to their place of settlement.” More than any other ﬁgure associated with the Second Great Awakening, Joseph Smith cared about the geographic component of religion. Other sects determined the time of the Second Coming; Latterday Saints determined the place.21 According to one of Smith’s revelations, the “center place” was Jackson County, Missouri. In the exegesis of disciple Sidney Ridgon, the Promised Land was “situated at about equal distances from the\n\n36 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nUte Genesis, Mormon Exodus\n\nAtlantic and the Paciﬁc oceans, as well as from the Alleghany and Rocky mountains.” In the ﬁrst days after the Creation this had been the location of the Garden of Eden. Just as history began here, it would end here. Jackson County would be Christ’s ﬁrst stop on his return. But ﬁrst the Latter-day Saints needed to do their part. Here in the center of North America, on the western edge of the United States, at the “borders of the Lamanites” (Indian Territory), the gathered Saints needed to erect a holy building to usher in the new dispensation. In 1831 Joseph Smith led a vanguard group to Independence, Missouri, where he dedicated a temple site.22 Unfortunately, the hoped-for utopia in Missouri suffered from too few assets, too much dissension, and, most important, too much competition. Neighboring settlers bristled at the Latter-day Saints’ land claims based on divine right. Claims and prophecies sounded even worse coming from nonslaveholding Yankees. Hostility turned into violence. In 1838–39, under threat of extermination, the Mormons were expelled from the state by order of the governor. Joseph Smith and his followers regrouped in Illinois, where they erected Nauvoo (supposedly a Hebrew word for “beautiful plantation”) out of the swamplands of the Mississippi River. They did not intend to stay long; Nauvoo was an interim Zion at best. Joseph Smith promised that Missouri would yet be redeemed. He also hinted that the Saints would ﬁrst seek refuge in the Rocky Mountains. In order to move forward in a time of postponement, the Prophet enlarged his meaning of Zion: “The whole of America is Zion itself from north to south, and is described by the Prophets, who declare that it is the Zion where the mountain of the Lord should be, and that it should be in the center of the land.”23 This proclamation from March 1844—one of Joseph Smith’s last public discourses—allowed the Saints to keep faith in Missouri while moving on to a new gathering place. Doing so became a necessity when Smith once again ran afoul of his neighbors. Acting as church president, city mayor, municipal justice, and militia general, the Prophet had built Nauvoo into a minitheocracy, a forerunner of the\n\n37 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press. All rights reserved.\n\non zion’s mount “Kingdom of God.” The Mormon “king” was at once anxious and hubristic: in June 1844, when a dissident newspaper in Nauvoo complained about the church-state alliance and published allegations about the then-secret practice of polygamy, Joseph Smith authorized the destruction of the press. This action led to his arrest by Illinois ofﬁcials. A mob of vigilantes stormed the county jail as Smith awaited trial. After taking multiple bullets to the chest, the Prophet fell from a second-story window, crying “O Lord, my God!” In the tumult following Smith’s martyrdom, the LDS Church splintered. Various would-be prophets vied for control as anti-Mormon violence spread. Hundreds of believers followed James J. Strang, who chose Beaver Island in Lake Michigan as his gathering place. Thousands more, including Joseph Smith’s family, remained in Nauvoo. In the 1850s many of them coalesced under the banner of “reorganization.” The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints recruited a prophet with a familiar name. Under Joseph Smith III, the RLDS Church disavowed polygamy and “Mormonism.” The Mormon church as such dates to 1845–46, when Nauvoo’s majority faction, 12,000–15,000 strong, lined up behind the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Its president, Brigham Young, approved the idea that Zion could be relocated to the Rocky Mountains or beyond. Young, a carpenter, was the right man at the right time. In the history of religion, very few sects have outlived their charismatic founders. Wisely, Young did not attempt to ﬁll the void. Brother Brigham portrayed himself not as the new Joseph Smith but as the Prophet’s righthand man. Smith had been uniquely fey, as he had to be. Creating a religion—a new order—takes magic and disorder. Managing a large church requires a different set of skills. Stern and pragmatic, Brigham Young proved to be ideal for the job. The westward migration did not begin auspiciously, however. After a hasty, haphazard evacuation from Nauvoo in 1846, the strung-out Mormon caravan got bogged down in the spring mud of Iowa. By the time the lead party got to the Missouri River, it was too late to explore\n\n38 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\nCopyright © 2008. Harvard University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nUte Genesis, Mormon Exodus\n\nwestward. The Latter-day Saints had to postpone their great migration; their desperate situation became worse. Help came from an unlikely source. Back in January, Brigham Young had instructed one of his subordinates to seek aid in Washington, D.C. The man arrived in May, just days after Congress had declared war on Mexico. Given this turn of events, President Polk authorized the Mormons to raise a 500-member battalion to join Colonel Stephen W. Kearney on his march down the Santa Fe Trail. The soldiers would be compensated sixteen dollars per month. In a sense, the “volunteers” would be paid to move to the Far West. Brigham Young accepted the offer with ambivalence. In his mind, he was leading his people to a faraway land—Mexican territory, in fact—because of the failures of state and federal governments to uphold the constitutional right of religious freedom. In his sermons, Young promised eternal damnation for the elected ofﬁcials who had failed to stop the vigilantes. At the same time, he couldn’t refuse the governmental aid. As the summer turned to fall, the remaining Saints hunkered down wherever they were—Illinois, Iowa, or present-day Nebraska. At the Mormon staging ground, “Winter Quarters,” on Omaha Indian land, several thousand Mormon squatters endured a miserable season of disease and death. When the advance party of 143 men (including three slaves), three women, and two children ﬁnally embarked for the mountains on 9 April 1847, everything was at stake. Brigham Young left behind a scattered, bankrupt church of downhearted followers. In order to succeed, the “Pioneer Camp of the Saints” had to cross the Plains quickly, ﬁnd a suitable resting place, plant crops in time for fall, and erect houses in time for winter. Where would this resting place be? During their ﬁnal year in Nauvoo, Young and his counselors held meetings at which they pored over maps and read aloud from the reports of John C. Frémont. Texas, California, and Vancouver Island received passing consideration. Though bountiful, these lands did not offer what the Mormons wanted most, a “place apart.” As early as mid-1845, the eastern\n\n39 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008.

In August the LDS General Council projected that the headquarters “will probably be in the neighborhood of Lake Tampanagos as that is represented as a most delightful district and no settlement near there.” In September the council resolved to organize a company to go to Salt Lake Valley. Then, in 1846, talk shifted to the “Bear River valley” northeast of the Great Salt Lake. The three eligible sites—Utah Valley, Salt Lake Valley, and Cache Valley—were located close enough together that Brigham Young deferred the ﬁnal decision. He said he would recognize the new promised land when he saw it.24 The Pioneer Camp was structured like a religious army, with captains of hundreds, captains of ﬁfties, and captains of tens. Using ﬁreand-brimstone language, Brigham Young ordered that all the recruits be “reformed.” They would get along or else. Their thousand-mile journey was a mission. In his one and only revelation in his thirty years as church leader—“The Word and Will of the Lord”—Brigham Young laid out the camp’s organization and its guiding covenant. If the pioneers were righteous, they would succeed. If they were wicked, they would fail. To emphasize the sanctity of the journey further, camp leaders “sealed” camp members to their families through spiritual adoption ceremonies. All of this group-building seemed to work. With negligible conﬂict (with one another or with Indians), the pioneers made decent time across the Plains despite their sabbatarianism. Only once did their beleaguered leader issue a jeremiad. At Scotts Bluff (near the western border of present-day Nebraska), Brother Brigham excoriated the camp for having fun around the ﬁre—“card playing, chequres & dominoes” as well as “dancing and Nig[g]ering & Hoeing down.” Repent or be ruined, he rebuked. Afterward one of the camp members, William Clayton, wrote that “it truly seemed as though the cloud had burst and we had emerged into a new element, a new atmosphere, and a new society.” Brigham Young had taught the group to think mythically. This was their Exodus; he was their Moses.25 At Fort Laramie the Pioneer Camp rested, resupplied, and unex-\n\n40 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008.

Beyond the fort the Saints continued along the North Platte and then the Sweetwater until reaching the Continental Divide at South Pass (in present-day Wyoming). Near here in late June, they encountered two mountain men, Moses Harris and Jim Bridger, in quick succession. Harris steered the Mormons toward Cache Valley. Bridger, who knew the country better, commended the soil of Salt Lake Valley, but given its late and early frosts, he wondered if the valley could support a large agricultural settlement. He reserved higher praise for Utah Valley, but warned against locating there. “The Indians round Utah Lake will strip a man, if they dont kill him,” recorded Thomas Bullock. “in the Utes Land you must not stick a Stake. all they r ﬁt for is Slaves.” Transcribing the same information, William Clayton wrote, “The Utah tribe of Indians inhabit the region around the Utah Lake and are a bad people . . . They are mostly armed with guns.” After this counsel, Brigham Young “felt inclined for the present not to crowd upon the Utes” in their “choice lands on the Utah” until the Saints had “a chance to get acquainted with them and that it would be better to bear toward the region of the Salt Lake rather than the Utah, & ﬁnd some good place for our seeds & deposit them as speedily as possible, regardless of a future location.”26 The Pioneer Camp crossed the point of no return after Fort Bridger, where for the ﬁrst time they left the well-traveled Oregon Trail. Veering southwest, the Mormons took the one-year-old Hastings Cutoff (more or less the present-day path of I-80). The year before, the Donner Party had come this way on its ill-fated journey to California. Even with the beneﬁt of the Donner Party’s trail-clearing, this was still by far the roughest, most mountainous part of the trek. It didn’t help that many of the Saints, including Brigham Young, came down with fever. Too sick to move, Young directed a small company to race ahead and start planting. The season was getting late, and Salt Lake sounded good enough. Young reserved the right to move the headquarters somewhere else in the future. But when the Mormon leader ﬁnally glimpsed the Valley of the Great Salt Lake from the summit of\n\n41 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\non zion’s mount Big Mountain on 24 July 1847, he “expressed his full satisfaction in the Appearance of the valley as A resting place for the Saints & was Amply repayed for his Journey.” His exact words are unknown. No one recorded the legendary utterance “This is the right place; drive on!” However, Young did say something similar on 28 July during an evening meeting on the valley ﬂoor. As Levi Jackman wrote in his diary, “the camp was called togeather to say whear the City should be built. After a number had spoken on the subject a voat was calld for [and it was] unanimosiley aggread that this was the spot After that Pres Young said tha[t] he knew that this is the place. he knew it as soon as he came in sight of it and he had seen this vearey spot before.”27\n\nCopyright © 2008.

The peculiar water of the Great Basin matched the Mormons’ identity as Peculiar People. For Brigham Young, ﬁnding a gathering place was one thing; convincing everyone to gather there was another. Now his efforts turned to environmental salesmanship—a task that compelled him to leave the place after only a short acquaintance. In late August Young headed back to Winter Quarters on the Missouri River. En route he passed the “Emigration Camp” or “Big Camp,” containing some 1,500 Saints. They had hit the trail in June, two months after the Pioneer Camp. In a “departure of the ﬁttest,” the Big Camp had left behind thousands of less fortunate members to face another winter in limbo. Before these marooned Saints lost faith or defected to James Strang, Young needed to rally their hope with good news about the Great Basin. In late December, during the same week that Brother Brigham was ofﬁcially elevated to the position of prophet, the Church issued a General Epistle to Latter-day Saints worldwide. It called on everyone to gather by the Missouri River in preparation for a general removal to the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. In describing the location, the Epistle was both realistic and optimistic. “The soil of the valley appeared good, but will re-\n\n42 On Zion's Mount : Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape, Harvard University Press, 2008.
