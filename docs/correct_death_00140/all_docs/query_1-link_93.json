        "text": "what is john c. fremont days?\n\nThe John C. Fremont Days festival is an award winning three day celebration of Fremont's history and it's namesake, John C. Fremont, that is held the second full weekend of July each year. This family oriented citywide festival began in 1987 and has events throughout the City of Fremont with something for everyone… and most things are free!\n\nActivities include living history encampments at Clemmons Park, continuous entertainment at our Chautauqua Tent down in John C. Fremont Park along with our antique and collectors show, craft & vendor tents and food vendors, Kennedy's Cruisers on Main Street Car & Bike Show downtown, children's activities at Midland University, rough stock rodeo out at Christensen Field, a historical parade, beer gardens & music, historical tours, and SO MUCH MORE!\n\nthe first three.\n\nPatti Emanuel-Vaughan, Sue Stoeber-Reyzlik and Cherrie Beam-Callway were the driving force behind the first John C. Fremont Days. They worked tirelessly to assemble the first events, gather financial support, recruit volunteers and the many other tasks that go along with doing something for the first time! Without their efforts, John C. Fremont Days would have never happened.\n\n​Patti Emmanuel-Vaughan, left, Sue Reyzlik, right, and Cherrie Clarke, seated,\n\n​pose for a picture following the first John C. Fremont Days in 1987.\n\nJohn C. Fremont"
