        "text": "As I prepare a new family history photo book about my husband's paternal line, I'm freshening up my research to uncover any new info.\n\nThe last time I wrote a booklet about the family trees of James Edgar Wood (1871-1939) and Mary Slatter Wood (1869-1925) was five years ago. Lots of genealogical content has been digitized since then, especially newspapers being added to databases.\n\nSure enough, I discovered there's a little more to the story of Mary's Slatter family. I already knew that her sister, Adelaide Mary Ann Slatter (1868-1947), married James Sills Baker on Aug. 23, 1896 in Cleveland, Ohio, as shown in marriage record at top. What I didn't know was exactly where and who was present.\n\nWhen I searched GenealogyBank for news coverage of Adelaide, I discovered two social items that mentioned Adelaide's father (hubby's great-grandfather) John Slatter (1838-1901). The items are quite similar, so I'll quote from the Cleveland Leader, Aug. 25, 1896, p. 4:\n\nOn Thursday evening, a score or more of invited guests assembled at the home of Mr. John Slatter, 433 St. Clair Street, to witness the marriage of his youngest daughter, Miss Adelaide M. Slatter, to Mr. John Sills Baker of Toledo. Mr. Thomas Lees officiated in tying the legal knot. Hearty congratulations were extended to Mr. & Mrs. Baker by their many friends. Supper was served, and the remainder of the evening was devoted to music and a social time. Many choice flowers and presents adorned the parlors. The young couple leave for Toledo, their future home, Saturday morning.\n\nWell, the father hosted the wedding ceremony and supper for his daughter! John had been widowed for the second time the previous year, and worked as a paper hanger. My impression was that his financial situation was rather tenuous. Perhaps the married couple actually paid for their own wedding supper but the father offered his home for the ceremony? I'll never know for sure, of course.\n\nBut I'll hold onto the image of a father happily watching his daughter get married. And of course this nuance about great-grandpa John Slatter will be in the new photo book.\n\nIn 1914, my husband's 9-year-old uncle, Wallis Wood, received two penny postal greeting cards for Easter. He lived in Cleveland, Ohio, and was the recipient of postcards for every holiday!\n\nAbove, a postcard from his father's older sister, Rachel Ellen Wood Kirby, who lived in Chicago. She signed \"Aunt Nellie.\"\n\nBelow, a postcard from his mother's older sister, Adelaide Mary Ann Slatter Baker, who lived in Toledo. She signed \"Aunt Ada.\"\n\nWishing you and your family a lovely Easter holiday!\n\nIn April of 1914, my hubby's uncle Wallis W. Wood (1905-1957) received two colorful Easter postcards.\n\nHe lived in Cleveland, Ohio and received penny postal greetings for every conceivable holiday, sent by his Wood and Slatter relatives.\n\nShown at left is the postcard from his aunt, \"Nellie\" Wood Kirby (1864-1954) and her husband, Arthur Kirby (1860-1939).\n\nNellie was an older sister of Wallis's father, James Edgar Wood (1871-1939).\n\nAlthough I've tried to find Nellie in the 1950 US Census, I haven't yet succeeded. I checked the 1949 Chicago directory (online for free at the Library of Congress) and didn't see her name listed under Kirby.\n\nNellie was living in a nursing home when she died, and I haven't found her there in the 1950 Census, nor at the address where she lived in 1945, according to the city directory. I'll keep looking!\n\nHere's a pretty postcard sent to Wallis by his aunt Ada Mary Ann Slatter Baker (1868-1947), who lived in Toledo, Ohio when she mailed this card.\n\nBy 1920, Ada and her husband, James Sills Baker (1866-1937) were living in Cleveland and most likely visited with Wallis and his family quite often.\n\nAda was the older sister of Wallis's mother, Mary Slatter Wood (1869-1925).\n\nNow 108 years later, these postcards live on in the Wood family's collection!\n\nI admit it--I get a bit teary-eyed thinking of the babes in my family tree who died too young. I want their names to live on, by putting them on public family trees and making sure their burial places are recorded.\n\nHow Miriam wound up in hubby's family tree\n\nToday I'm focusing on Miriam Louise Wise (1925-1926). This little girl's father was Clifford \"Buck\" Wise (1895-1963) and her mother was Edith Macklin Wise (1897-1947). After Miriam's early death, Clifford and Edith were happy to welcome a second daughter, Janice (1927-1988), bringing light back into their lives, as I know from family letters.\n\nClifford was widowed in 1947 and the following year, he married my father-in-law's first cousin, Edith Eleanor Baker (1901-1989), who became a devoted and loving stepmom to Janice. This connection with the Wise family is how little Miriam Louise Wise wound up in my hubby's family tree.\n\nMaking sure Miriam is remembered\n\nMiriam's parents (both on my family tree already) are buried in Acacia Masonic Memorial Park Cemetery in Mayfield Hts, Ohio, and memorialized on Find a Grave. But until now, I hadn't looked carefully for Miriam's final resting place.\n\nBy searching for \"more Wise Memorials\" in the same cemetery, I came upon a memorial page for \"Marian Wise,\" birth/death unknown (see image above). The plot is exactly where Miriam's parents are buried.\n\nMy conclusion: Marian is surely Miriam. Interestingly, the obit in the Fremont Daily Messenger (which I've ordered*) calls her Mariam Louise Wise, but the Ohio death index lists her as Miriam. Family letters also call her Miriam.\n\nHer now revised memorial page is on Find a Grave.\n\nThis reflects edits I submitted to the memorial page's manager, correcting Miriam's name and including her dates. I also posted an image of Miriam's name in the death index. And I posted Miriam's sweet baby photo, as shown.\n\nMiriam is already on the tree at FamilySearch and on two Ancestry public trees, courtesy of relatives in the Wise family. I'm adding her to all my Wood family trees over time.\n\nIt's comforting that Miriam will not be forgotten, because her name and dates are documented in more than one place by more than one person. Rest in peace, little Miriam.\n\n* Turns out, the obit does name this baby correctly as Miriam Louise Wise. She died of \"telescoping of the bowels\" (causing dangerous blockage). Doctors operated, unsuccessfully, sad to say.\n\nThis post is my \"May Day\" for The Genealogy Blog Party, 2022.\n\nI've been scanning old photos and negatives left by my father-in-law, Edgar James Wood (1903-1986).\n\nAt left, a 1919 image I blogged about just recently, remarking on the fashions.\n\nThis came from a set of negatives that Ed had marked as \"Baker family, 1919.\"\n\nI know the names of these two sisters, who were Ed's first cousins, but not which is which in the photo.\n\nAt right, a photo that my hubby and I believe shows Ed with these same two cousins, 50 years later. No caption, but a family story gave us confidence that these were the Baker sisters. Which is which? We had no idea. Until now.\n\nHearing from a FAN club descendant\n\nThis week, I received a message from a gentleman (Pat) who noticed the Baker names on my public family tree.\n\nPat is not related to the Bakers or to my husband.\n\nHere's where it gets a little convoluted. Pat is the executor of the estate for a lady who was the executor for the estate of one of the Baker sisters. In other words, he's the descendant of a FAN club member.\n\nConnecting through my public family tree\n\nWhen Pat's mom died, he inherited her boxes of stuff, including boxes from her dear friend, Edith, who died a few years earlier. Pat's Mom wanted her friend's photos and letters to survive, so she bequeathed them to her son. (She wisely planned ahead before she joined her ancestors.)\n\nNow Pat is sorting the bequest and looking for descendants who would like to have some of the items he inherited.\n\nPat noticed Edith and her sister on my Ancestry public family tree and sent me a message. I confirmed how Edith was related to my father-in-law and thus to my husband.\n\nThen we exchanged photos. He shared a photo of Edith in her later years. We are so grateful he did.\n\nEureka! Thanks to the FAN club, I now know exactly which of the ladies in both of these photos is Edith and which is her sister. Edith is on the right in the later photo, on the left in the younger photo. And Pat can see how lovely Edith was in her youth.\n\nA good reason to have a public tree...even without photos, it serves as cousin bait and FAN club bait, with ancestor names/dates/locations visible and the option to send a message.\n\nMy late father-in-law Edgar James Wood (1903-1986) was a photo buff. After receiving a camera for his 14th birthday, he took it on family road trips with his father, James Edgar Wood (1871-1939) and his mother, Mary Slatter Wood (1869-1925).\n\nEd saved hundreds of negatives (and a few prints) from 1917 through the 1940s, marking dates on the negatives and notes on the envelopes. I used the \"scan, invert, enhance\" process to turn the old negatives into clearer positives.\n\nVisit to the Baker family in Toledo, Ohio\n\nThanks to Ed's notation that these negatives are of the Baker family of Toledo, I can identify the two young ladies shown at left as Dorothy L. Baker (1897-1981) and Edith E. Baker (1901-1989). I don't which young lady is which, unfortunately. The photographer didn't write an exact date on the negatives, but others in the envelope were taken in 1919.\n\nThese two ladies were Ed's first cousins, and he was in touch with them for the next 50 years. How fashionable they were, fur collar, hats, and all!\n\nFashion of the time\n\nI did an online search for \"ladies coat fashion 1919\" and found similar outfits for that year. As a result, I do think the negatives were from late that year or perhaps the following year.\n\nAt right is Mary Slatter Wood, Ed's mother, in the warm coat and hat she wore during that same trip.\n\nHer husband James drove the family from their home in Cleveland, Ohio to Toledo, Ohio, stopping along the way to picnic and to fix flat tires. Mary and everyone else in the car were smart to bundle up against the elements, because their 1917 Ford probably had no built-in heater!\n\n--\n\n\"Fashion\" is this week's #52Ancestors prompt from Amy Johnson Crow."
