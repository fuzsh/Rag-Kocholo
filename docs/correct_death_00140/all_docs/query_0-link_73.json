There were three Samuel Huntoon's alive in 1790 and known to have married before 1790: Samuel (John, Philip) born in 1718, his son Samuel born in 1750, and Samuel (Philip, Philip), born in 1727. Of these three, it seems most likely that the Samuel Huntoon counted in Unity in 1790 was the last, born in 1727.\n\nThe Samuel Huntoon born in 1718 can be pretty safely placed in Nottingham in 1790. Little is known about his son except that when he married Elizabeth Prescott in 1778 he was \"of Unity.\" While he could have had a daughter under 10 years of age by 1790, he would probably not have had a son over the age of 16, so it seems improbable that there would have been two males over the age of 16 in his family in 1790.\n\nThe Samuel Huntoon described here, born in 1727, may have lived in Unity in 1782 when his daughter Hannah was married there. His son Philip was married in 1792, so very likely he was over 16 in 1790 and still living with his parents. His daughter Lydia may have had a daughter in 1796, so may not have married just shortly before than, so may have been the second female living in his household in 1790.\n\n107 \"Kingston First Church Records,\" NHGR, 14(1997)122.\n\n108 Kathleen Beals, Early Families of Unity, Appendix, p. 13. \"Anna, wf Capt.
