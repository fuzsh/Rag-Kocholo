    "text": "First timer? In this (hopefully) once-a-day blog, I have my computer select a random latitude and longitude that puts me somewhere in the continental United States (the lower 48). I call this “landing.” I keep track of the watersheds I land in, as well as the town I land near. I do some internet research to hopefully find something of interest about my landing location. To find out more about A Landing A Day (like who “Dan” is and what the various numbers and abbreviations mean), please see “About Landing,” (and “Abbreviations” and “Cryptic Numbers”) above.\n\nDan – A solid USer; a new record . . . CA; 83/94; 6/10; 11; 156.6. Here’s my landing map:\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, I landed on the south side of Fremont. While some of you no doubt know where Fremont is, others (like me before this landing) don’t. Well, here’s a somewhat broader view:\n\n\n\n\n\nHow about that? This is my first Bay Area landing!\n\nI landed in the Coyote Ck watershed, which flows into the far southern part of San Francisco Bay. Here’s an old print showing an area of Fremont known as Warm Springs. The waterway with the boats in the background is Coyote Creek!\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a geologist, I can’t help but wonder how close to the San Andrea Fault I landed. Well, here’s a map:\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m ashamed to admit that I thought that the fault ran up the Bay (and that therefore my landing was very close to the fault). Wrong!! It runs right up the peninsula. I’ll never make that mistake again!\n\nSo, Fremont. From Wiki:\n\nFremont is a city in Alameda County, California. It was incorporated in 1956, from the merger of five smaller communities: Centerville, Niles, Irvington, Mission San Jose, and Warm Springs. The city is named after John Charles Frémont, “the Great Pathfinder.”\n\nFremont is located in the southeast section of the San Francisco Bay Area. Home to an estimated 211,662 people as of 2007, Fremont is now the fourth most populous city in the Bay Area. It is included as one of the towns in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe recorded history of the Fremont area began on June 9, 1797 when Mission San José was founded by the Spaniard Father Fermin de Lasuen. The Mission was established at the site of the Ohlone Indian village of Oroysom.The Mission prospered, eventually reaching a population of 1,886 inhabitants in 1831. The influence of the missionaries declined after 1834, when the Mexican government enacted secularization.\n\nHere’s an 1852 picture of the Mission:\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Wiki:\n\nIn 1846 John C. Frémont mapped a trail through Mission Pass to provide access for American settlers into the southeastern San Francisco Bay Area. Fremont grew rapidly at the time of the Gold Rush. Agriculture dominated the economy with grapes, nursery plants and olives as leading crops. In 1868 the 6.8-magnitude Hayward earthquake on the Hayward Fault collapsed buildings throughout Fremont, ruining Mission San José and its outbuildings. Until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake caused its destruction, Fremont’s Palmdale Winery was the largest in California. The ruins of the Palmdale Winery are still visible.\n\nFrom 1912-1916 the Niles section of Fremont was the earliest home of California’s motion picture industry. Charlie Chaplin filmed several movies in Fremont, most notably “The Tramp.”\n\nHere’s a picture of Mission Peak from a wildlife area located right along the shore of the Bay:\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ll close with this absolutely lovely picture taken outside of Fremont. Those are mustard plants in the foreground:\n\n\n\n\n\nKS\n\nGreg\n\n© 2009 A Landing A Day"
