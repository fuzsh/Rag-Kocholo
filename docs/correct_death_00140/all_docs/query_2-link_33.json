    "text": "Fremont, city, Alameda county, California, U.S. Fremont lies on the southeastern shore of San Francisco Bay (there spanned by the Dumbarton Bridge), southeast of San Francisco, on the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct. Originally inhabited by Ohlone Indians, the area became the site of the Spanish Mission San José de Guadalupe (founded in 1797). The city, named for explorer John C. Frémont, was formed in 1956 through the amalgamation of five agricultural communities—Centerville, Irvington, Mission San José, Niles, and Warm Springs. Freeway connections stimulated residential and industrial growth as part of San Francisco Bay area development. Fremont’s high-technology industry is closely linked to that of the rest of Silicon Valley. Automobile manufacturing is also important.\n\nFremont is the seat of Ohlone (junior) College (1965). Ardenwood Historic Farm preserves the area’s agricultural past. Coyote Hills Regional Park, a 1,000-acre (400-hectare) wildlife sanctuary, contains ancient Indian shell mounds and a restored Indian village. Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge is adjacent. Inc. 1956. Pop.
