Just curious. Born in Pennsylvania 1814 (this statement does not seem to be accurate, as per wikipedia, citation needed: COPY ATTACHED THE year of birth varies: 1813/1814/1815 depends on what you are reading. So we must go with the only \"reliable source\" The Friends Birth Record, attached... REGARDING the below statement, if you look at his father's wikipedia BIO it states the family was in England, and came home with 2 more children, Richard/ William........So more proof.... please read the Friends Birth REGISTER copy attached.........THIS IS THE CORRECT WILLIAM GILPIN. \"The William Gilpin birth record from Ancestry.com stating his birth place as England, is not for this William.\" [13]"
