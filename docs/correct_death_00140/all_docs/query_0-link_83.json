Sat Mar 06, 2010 9:39 am\n\nYou can view Darlenes address book at Zodiackiller.com.\n\nAnyone mentioned in the address book that you would like to discuss use this thread, please remember not to reveal full names.\n\nI had posted a little about looking over her address book and seeing that some adressess were made out using a plus sign instead of the word ‘and’ thus +. As in Janet + Bill C********. The Zodiac in his correspondences used the + sign a lot (but not all the time). I was wondering how many suspects or POI’s might have used this method, and do we see this anywhere else. Manson uses the + in this way for example.\n\n\n\n\n\nZamantha , Subject: Darlene’s Address Book. Fri Apr 16, 2010 1:57 am\n\nI previously made this post on the ZodiacZee, but we have some new members here. So thought I’d re-post. One of my friends from Vallejo’s Older Sister was a friend of Darlene’s. She is also listed in Darlene’s address book. Imagine my friends surprise the first time she found Darlene’s address book on the internet…and started snooping…and there was her sister.\n\nHer sister dappled in Witch Craft….. Not saying there is a connection…but…. you never know. Her sister also committee suicide. (I always wonder about some suicides, like were they really suicide??) There was also one other person in the address book that was friends with his person.\n\nThese were girls that were friends…and kinda grew up together….\n\n\n\n\n\nZamantha , Subject: Darlenes Address Book Sun May 02, 2010 2:41 am\n\nA previously post made on the ZodiacZee site, on Darlene’s Address Book.\n\nZamantha\n\nPost subject: Re: Was Darlene Into Witchcraft\n\nPostPosted: Wed Oct 21, 2009 3:54 am\n\nI can not say for sure that Darlene was involved in witch craft, but her friend in her address book was.\n\nMy old school friend from Vallejo told me her Z Story after hearing about my interest in the case. She sent me Darlene’s phone book page with her sister’s name and address. Now I’ve looked at those pages before but never made the connection since her sister was older. A few years ago my friend was reading some Internet information and her extract words were, imagine my surprise and sadness when I stumbled a pond that a few years ago.\n\nHer sister had a book and did some of the \"spells\". She remember that she had a copper bowl and did some stuff with a circle of rock salt around her bed and something with desert turtles.\n\nWhen her sister moved out of her Mom’s home she moved into another home in Vallejo with a friend named ________, who she thinks worked at Mare Island. She is pretty sure her Mom would remember her last name. Then she moved to San Rafael or Novato (Marin Co. CA) and thinks that is were she was living when Darlene was killed. She recalls her sister joining the Air Force. She also recalls her brother in law or her Mom said something about Darlene possibly hanging out with a wilder crowd.\n\nHer sister committed suicide in the early 70’s, she was attending nursing school at the time. Since she was involved with witchcraft her grandmother thought that is what led to her suicide.\n\nThree years ago my friend went to visit her brother in law and they talked about the Zodiac and what a sad time and what might of gone through her sister’s head when Darlene was killed. The next time she talks to her brother in law she will pin him down for more information ( I gave her a list) It is difficult to get him to talk about it sometimes, as it was the worst thing her family has ever gone through…as you can imagine.\n\nAlso there is another one of her sister’s friends listed in Darlene’s address book, she now lives out of the area.\n\nAfter her sisters suicide my friend had her sister’s book on witch craft and was going to start practicing herself. But when she started getting really scared when her Grandmother said the witchcraft was responsible for her sister’s death, and of course her brother in law would think it was the devils work, so she threw the book away as she was so afreared.\n\nLater my friend was brothered by a guy in Vallejo at the Restaurant she worked at in the early 70’s. I will make this post later this week in the Vallejo Vibe Thread.\n\nI will be in contact again with my friend, so if there are any questions I should ask….please let me know.\n\n\n\n\n\nsandy betts , Subject: Zams friend Sun May 02, 2010 3:22 am\n\nZamantha, we need to find out how she died ? Remember that nurse that I said I didn’t think she jumped off of the bridge near Martinez ? Well I still think that was a Z murder, now I just need to find out if she was the woman who lived in the blue house ? The Zodiac told a school teacher who lived in Martinez, that he was going to kill the lady in the blue house.\n\nIf your friends family won’t talk about what method the sister used to kill herself, we can get that info at the recorders office. The idea she was a nurse is of some concern. Find out where she worked. and the name of the restaurant that the other person worked at.\n\nDarlene and myself, were bothered by a man who would watch us at the restaurant where we worked. That by its self isn’t much to believe that it was the Z in both cases , but when you add up all of the other things that this man has done to the both if us.\n\nI don’t see how it could be two different people, from the same area and time ? Then you add K.Johns into the mix ,what are the odds of him being the driver who took her and her baby for the long ride, as well as the same man who Dee and I had bothering us ? It is black and white to me ,with out any gray areas. And this man is still alive !!!!\n\n\n\n\n\njay st , Subject: Re: Darlene’s Address Book.

Wed Aug 17, 2011 5:08 pm\n\nSandy, as far as California goes, I think you will find that informaton that used to be public is not anymore because of a law Governor Arnie signed sometime during his tenure.\n\nRecorder’s Offices are only allowed to give certain limited information now.\n\nI don’t know what the details are, but I had a hard time trying to learn about a friend of mine who committed suicide at age 23 back in 1968. One can still purchase a copy of the death certificate, but no more information given out otherwise.\n\nThis practice may have been reversed. As far as I know, property ownership is still public information. In other states, death records are sealed, period.\n\nbruce3 , Subject: Re: Darlene’s Address Book.
