LEGEND (unabbreviated) \" Sigillum Civitatis Novi Eboraci: \" Seal of tbe City of New York ; Eboraci being the genitive case of the old Roman name for York. SHIELD: Argent, charged with the four sails of a windmill proper; between their outer ends, two beavers proper, one in chief and one in base, and two flour-barrels proper, in fess, one on each side. CREST : A bald eagle proper, rising from a denu-terrestrial globe. The beaver is an emblem of the fur trade, so important in Dutch days ; the sails and barrels represent the bolting industry, a monopoly of which was granted New York merchants by the Bolting Act of 1678. SUPPORTERS (not heraldically part of the city arms and variously represented to-day) : dexter (right) side of shield, a sailor in dress and cap of 1700 holding in his right hand a ship's sounding- line; on the sinister (left) side, an Indian chief with a stringed bow. The sailor is said to be in honor of James who was not only Proprietor of New York but also Lord High Admiral of England ; the Indian represented the inhabitants and possessors of his Province in America. — From a Report of the Saint Nicholas Society. trtje Citp ^imxp Club of ^eto |?orfe 105 West 40TH Street OFFICERS 1912-13 Honorary President President First Vice-President Second Vice-President Treasurer Secretary .

PREFACE The Historical Guide to Nezv York is the result of prolonged ef- forts on the part of the City History Club of New York to discover and to direct attention to the yet visible traces of earlier times which lie hidden within and are fast disappearing from the city of to-day. When the society was founded in 1896 to promote good citizenship through the study of history and civics and by the establishment of self-governing clubs, the need was felt for a systematic survey of and guide to the history of New York City in a simple and convenient form. In order to meet this necessity the Club first published, un- der the direction of a number of well-known writers, The Half Moon Papers, a series of monographs which were afterward incor- porated in two volumes entitled Historic Nezv York. During the past thirteen years, twelve Excursion Leaflets have been prepared, designed to provide, at the lowest possible price, a brief but carefully verified historical description of every part of the city, compiled a? far as possible from original sources. These pamphlets have been extensively utilized b}- members of the junior clubs, some of whom have by their use become competent as trained, and in a few cases, pro- fessional guides ; by the children of the public and private schools of the five boroughs ; and by many other persons who believe, as does the writer, that familiarit}^ with the history of one's own city leading to a knowledge and love of the city itself is the foundation of true civic patriotism. The information thus gathered is now presented in complete form, thoroughly revised and illustrated by maps and photo- graphs. On behalf of the City History Club and on my own part, I thank the many faithful friends of the organization who have contributed of their time and knowledge to the compilation of this work. Some of their names may be found recorded on another page, but the full measure of skill and devotion which they have so generously expended can never be recorded. It is the sincere hope of the founder of the City History Club that this book may prove of real service to all those who desire to know the city better and to work .more effectively for its future good. Catharine A. B. Abbe. Brook End, Bar Harbor, July 5th, 1909. EXPLANATORY EXCURSIONS: the original twelve itineraries still issued as sepa- rate leaflets and numbered in the order of their issue. These are now arranged in -order of topography, beginning with lower Manhat- tan. ROUTES: the Excursions have been divided into Sections, each of which covers sufficient territory for an itinerary of about two hours. Prefixed to the Section numbers are Route numbers (running con- secutively from I to 60) which are also placed at the head of each page (abbreviation R). TYPE. Bold faced type is used for landmarks, tablets or other memorials in existence at the time of publication (1909). Italics indicate directions in routes ; historic sites. Small type indicates general historical accounts, descriptions of historic build- ings which have no visible trace or memorial. Small Capitals in such type indicate some place of importance represented by a name or memorial. KEY MAPS show the approximate location of the various Routes, the numbers thereon corresponding to Route numbers. PLATES : with but four exceptions the maps and diagrams have been specially prepared or redrawn for this Guide Book. The ILLUSTRATIONS in the text are from the set published by the City History Club ; the full page inserts, with one exception, are from original photographs taken for the Guide Book. NOTES : blank pages for original notes are placed at the end of each Excursion, as changes in New York City are so rapid, the old giving place to the new, that accounts of landmarks must be con- stantly amended. SECOND EDITION:—* refers to Addenda and Corrections in- serted at the end of the various Routes, etc. INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION Since 1909 many historic buildings have been destroyed, new monu- ments, statues and tablets have been erected, new streets and parks have been opened and some street names have been changed. More- over, errors in the first edition have been discovered and much additional matter added. The changes in the Bronx have been so great that nearly all the maps had to be redrawn. Plates V, XII and LXVII have also been redrawn. In order to save the expense of making entirely new electroplates, corrections and additions to the text have been inserted at the end of the various Routes, reference to them being made by means of asterisks. Part VI has been condensed and the Bronx portion rewritten; Appendix D has been entirely rewritten and the Index has been thoroughly revised. Thinner paper has been used in order to make the book lighter and more portable. The compiler and the editors welcome criticisms and suggestions, as they desire to make the work thoroughly reliable and complete. Frank Bergen Kelley. February, 1913.

NEW YORK'S DEVELOPMENT AS SHOWN BY THE TRACES OF OLD ROADS AND STREETS. By Albert Ulmann. Author of \" A Landmark History of New York.\" Tradition furnishes an account to the effect that the first habita- tions of white men on the Island of Manhattan consisted of four houses or huts erected in 1613 on a site now known as 41 Broadway where a bronze tablet commemorates this interesting circumstance. From this simple beginning the settlement grew until some thirty cabins, clustered near the southern end of the island, constituted the little town. Then a general conflagration took place and much damage was done. Before this first of the great fires that have visited Manhattan, in 1626, the lines of a fort were laid out, occupying the site of the present Custom House, the work being completed in 1633-5. Iri those days the shore line was less extended than at present so that the fort easily commanded the entrance to both the Hudson and East Rivers, the water coming up to the line of the present State Street. Fort Amsterdam, as the work was called, built of earth and stone and hav- ing four bastions, rose proudly above the group of small houses and became the distinctive feature of New Amsterdam. In the earliest views of the settlement, such as that of Joost Hartger published in 165 1, it stands forth as the dominating landmark of the little hamlet that occupied the southern end of the Island of Manhattan. The main gate of the fort opened on the present Bowling Green, which from the earliest days was maintained as an open space. It was, in fact, the heart of the old Dutch town. It provided a playground for the children, a site for the May-pole around which the youths and maidens danced, a parade ground for the soldiers and a place for the great market and the annual cattle show. Here, also, those great meetings with the Indians were held at which treaties were ar_ ranged and the pipe of peace was smoked. (Excursion VII.) HISTORICAL GUIDE NEW YORK'S DEVELOPMENT The first streets were laid out in a haphazard manner and the town grew np in a random fashion, the first settlers placing their houses according to the dictates of their fancy. Thus footpaths and cow- paths gradually developed into thoroughfares and produced the tangle of streets that characterizes lower New York to this day. Naturally, roadways leading to the fort assumed shape at an early date, two main paths being established in this wise. One of these paths led to the ferry connecting the town with Brooklyn, the other passed north- ward in a general way along the center of the island. The first of these main roads was practically a shore path following the present line of Stone and Pearl Streets and terminating at about the present Peck Slip. The second fixed the line of lower Broadway, leading northward from the fort as far as Park Row (Tnnes says via Ann Street to Park Row), following this and the Bowery and passing on finally into the wilderness. A third pathway was developed when the palisade was erected along the present line of Wall Street. Block-House and City Gate.

Reproduced by permission from Todd's \" The Story of the City of New York \": G. P. Putnam's Sons. Besides these primitive thoroughfares, two other pathways were laid out at an early date. Along the present Broad Street a canal extended as far as Beaver Street where it narrowed to a ditch and drained a swamp that extended northward to about Exchange Place. On either side of the canal because, no doubt, of the pleasant sug- gestions of similar scenes at home, the early settlers erected dwellings and a promenade was thus established. East and west of the Broad Street canal, and intersecting it, there was a second ditch which became a pathway and is now known as Beaver Street. The origin of Wall Street supplies another interesting chapter to the story of New York's old thoroughfares. The wooden wall that was erected along the line to which the name still clings was built in 1653 to protect the town against a threatened invasion of New Eng- landers, \" a lithe, slippery, aggressive race,\" whom the Dutch looked upon half in fear and half in scorn. The invasion never took place, but the wall remained for nearly half a century and succeeded nobly in keeping the town from growing beyond its useless barrier. 6 t>^€: .

Tyler's Reproductions NEW YORK'S DEVELOPMENT In the meantime, the Indians inadvertently became the cause of an important road development. In the early Dutch days several bouw- eries or farms had been established northward of the town, the most distant belonging to Governor Stuyvesant, located in the neighborhood of Tenth Street and Second Avenue. In 1655, the Indians made a number of attacks on the outlying settlers, killing several farmers and their wives. As a measure of protection against such atrocities, an order was issued commanding all settlers to abandon isolated farms and to concentrate in hamlets. This led to the formation of a little colony in the neighborhood of Stuyvesant bouwerie and to the devel- opment of the road that connected it with the town, called in those days the Bouwerie Lane and, subsequently, the Bowery. Three years later the murder of a prominent settler who had purchased the flats on which the Village of Haarlem was afterwards built, led to the establishment of a hamlet in that neighborhood and to the extension of the Bouwerie Lane outward to the northern end of the island. An interesting representation of New Amsterdam's outlines and main thoroughfares has fortunately been preserved in the form of a map generally known as \" The Duke's Plan,\" being a draft made in 1664 for the Duke of York upon the capture of the town by the Eng- lish and showing how it looked in 1661 ; the original of the map is in the British Museum. In course of time, new paths beyond the \" Wall \" were developed. One of these along a rippling stream was called by the Dutch \" The Maiden's Path,\" which the English later translated into Maiden Lane. Whether this title was due to its service as a lover's lane or, as those of a more prosaic nature allege, to its use as a spot where maidens went to do the family washing, will remain in obscurity. The tendency of the city's growth, as shown by a study of a series of the early maps, was northeastward, the western section, together with Broadway, remaining undeveloped. A map of 1728 from a sur- vey by James Lyne and printed by New York's first printer, William Bradford, clearly exhibits the direction of growth. It appears that the shipping interests extended along the East River and this factor in- fluenced the location of warehouses in the neighborhood, as well as the establishment of all sorts of business places near the ferry, in order to capture the Long Island trade. Broadway was, in reality, a distant and unfrequented part of the town. Near Bowling Green there were some five houses, but north of Crown Street (present Liberty Street), there was merely a stretch of open fields. On the map this section appears as the King's Farm. The story of this farm is an interesting 7 HISTORICAL GUIDE and important chapter in the history of New York and it remains a factor to this day. In Dutch days there was a tract between the present Fulton and Warren Streets, extending from Broadway west- ward to the river, known as the Company's Farm, which was set aside to be tilled for the benefit of the Company's civil and military serv- ants. When the English came into control, this property became the private land of the Duke of York. In 1670, additional land was bought from the heirs of Anneke Jans, the farm being then ex- tended to about Christopher Street. When the Duke of York be- came king this tract was called the King's Farm and subsequently, in the days of Anne, the Queen's Farm. In 1705, the entire estate was granted to the \" English Church in the Island of New York,\" (now Trinity) which still retains possession of it. No doubt this very fact, namely that the land belonged to the church, helped to prevent the development of that section, the inhabitants naturally preferring to build where they could acquire title to the land. In the meantime, that portion of Manhattan known to this day as Greenwich Village was developing along lines of its own. The original village occupied the region between West Tenth Street and the present site of Gansevoort Market. Here in the earliest days was an Indian settlement selected by the knowing Red Men for its fer- tility, good fishing and hunting. The Dutch converted the section into a farm and farmers were easily attracted to the fertile spot. For a number of years it retained its Indian title of Sappokanican, but about the year 1720 the name was changed to Greenwich. It grew in popularity and in the course of time became the abiding place of a number of prominent people. Naturally, a line of communication was established between the town and the village, the Greenwich Road along the line practically of the present Greenwich Street being the most direct route. This became a fashionable driveway, but owing to the fact that it crossed Lispenard's Meadows and Minetta Water where there was a causeway, and that after a rain the road became very bad, people frequently gave preference to the Bowery, turning westward at Astor Place where there was a cross road. As has already been mentioned, Greenwich developed along lines of its own, the result being that when the city grew up to it and streets were joined, a hopeless tangle ensued causing such extraor- dinary and startling occurrences as the intersection of West Fourth and Tenth Streets. (Excursion II.). The picturesque Bloomingdale Road which yielded to the aristo- cratic title of Boulevard and subsequently became plain Broadway, NEW YORK'S DEVELOPMENT was opened in 1703, at which time it extended from about Twenty- third Street to One Hundred and Fourteenth Street. In 1795 it Was laid out to One Hundred and Forty-seventh Street where it formed a junction with the Kingsbridge Road. Bloomingdale, which bestowed its pleasantly suggestive name (vale of flowers) upon the roadway that traversed its tract of fine estates, covered the space from about Madison Square to the neighborhood of One Hundredth Street and contained a number of stately mansions nearly all of which have been supplanted by crowded modern structures. The name survives in the designation \" Bloomingdale Square,\" conferred in 1906 on the open space in front of the Bloomingdale Reformed Church at One Hundred and Sixth Street and Broadway. (Excur- sion V.) Kingsbridge Road was the old Post Road to Albany and to New England. It has disappeared from the modern map. As in the case of the Bloomingdale Road, which it joined at One Hundred and Forty-seventh Street, continuing northward along the western section of the island, its name has been supplanted by that of Broad- way. The unvarying rectilinear and rectangular plan of streets that con- signed Manhattan to its prosaic gridiron was the work of a Com- mission consisting of Gouverneur Morris, Simeon De Witt and John Rutherford, appointed in 1807. This Commission, after four years of prodigious effort, evolved the monotonous scheme that has ef- fectively prevented the realization of a city beautiful. Some of the remarks of the worthy commissioners are decidedly interesting. \" Circles, ovals and stars,\" it seems, strongly tempted them, but they did not flinch from their sense of duty. Acknowledging that such fanciful forms would certainly embellish a plan, they remembered that the city, after all, was to be composed principally of the habita- tions of men and that straight-sided and right-angled houses were \" the most cheap to live in,\" and the effect of this economic reasoning was decisive. Referring to another problem with which the commissioners A'restled and which disturbed their consciences to a considerable de- gree, a statement appears as follows : \" It may to many be a matter of surprise that so few vacant spaces have been left, and those so small, for the benefit of fresh air and consequent preservation of health.\" \" Had New York been situated near little streams like the Seine or the Thames,\" reasoned the far-seeing commissioners, \" a great number of ample spaces might have been necessary, but Manhattan 9 HISTORICAL GUIDE being embraced by large arms of the sea, neither from the point of view of health nor pleasure was such a plan necessary. Besides, considering the uncommonly great price of land,\" said the prudent commissioners, \" it was along the line of duty to be economical.\" Another comment is worth repeating : \" To some,\" they remarked, \" it may be a matter of surprise that the whole island has not been laid out as a city. To others it may be a subject of merriment that the commissioners have provided space for a greater population than is collected at any spot on this side of China. They have in this respect been governed by the shape of the ground. It is not im- probable that considerable numbers may be collected at Harlem before the high hills to the southward of it shall be built upon as a city; and it is improbable that (for centuries to come) the grounds north of Harlem Flat will be covered with houses.\" This was just one century ago. Cautious commissioners ! \" To have gone further,\" they explained, \" might have furnished materials to the pernicious spirit of speculation.\" TO EXCURSION NO.

To complete a survey of Dutch traces, the journey should be continued up Broadway, Park Row and the Bowery to the region of Stuyvesant's Bouwerie (Excursion III.). Before taking this itinerary, read Mr. Ulmann's article, p. 3, •* New York's Development.\" See also \"The Greatest Street in the World : Broadway,\" by Stephen Jenkins.

(Figures refer to Plate V; compare with Plates II, III, IV, VI, VII, and VIII). Take Elevated R. R. or Broadway car to Battery Place, or Subway to Bowling Green. The original Hudson River Shore Line approximately followed Greenwich Street and the line of the Ninth Avenue Elevated Railroad to the vicinity of South Ferry Station. Greenwich Street (laid out about 1760) was the shore road to Greenwich Village (Excursion II). The niap of 1695 shows palisades along Greenwich Street connected at the north with the wall on Wall Street. Remains of old posts were dug up when the foundations of the Bowling Green Offices were laid. Battery Place was the western extension of Marketfield Street and derives its name from the battery erected here in English days. (Section IV.) Note the old buildings at the foot of Greenwich and Washington Streets.* i Go up Broadway. Broadway was called the Hcere Straat, the Heere Wcgh and the Broad Way, and extended to Ann Street where it turned east and up Nassau Street to Park Row. I. Tablet on the Washington Building, i Broadway, erected by the Sons of the Revolution to mark the site of the Kennedy House, built about 1760 by Captain Archibald Kennedy, R. N., a member of the Governor's Council and Collector of the Port, later eleventh Earl of Cassilis. It was occupied during the Revolution by Putnam, \" King \" Sears, Generals Clinton and Carleton, but not by Washing- ton, whose headquarters before September 14, 1776, were at Rich- mond Hill (Excursion II). Later it was owned by Nathaniel Prime and became the Washington Hotel. The Washington Building was erected by Cyrus W. Field and from its tower . and roof can be gained fine views of the harbor. Robert Fulton died in a house which stood just at the rear. 9 and II Broadway are on the site of the tavern of Martin Cregier, a Dutch burgomaster, and of the King's Arms Tavern or Burns' Coffee House, where the Non-Importation Agreement was signed by New York merchants in 1766 (by some located at 113 Broadway). Benedict Arnold had his quarters here for a time. Note. So says Valentine, but Innes claims that Cregier's second house was on the site of 3 Broadway, and doubts whether he kept tavern here. There is also reason to doubt whether the name Burns' Coffee House applied to the King's Arms Tavern. HISTORICAL GUIDE v^ K rt n! ;5 Hog l6 Bowling Green MANHATTAN I Route 2. 17-19 Broadway (see stone lions) was once the British Consulate. Here for a time lived Daniel Webster. 3. 21-27 Broadway, the Stevens House, was built about 1800 by Capt. Stevens as three dwellings, later used for business; then as a hotel, where Jenny Lind and P. T. Barnum stopped.* la Morris Street was the open way to Bayard's Brewery. South of it lay thes original Dutch burying ground. On the west side of Broadway were private residences during colonial days, and shops on the east side. 4. Bowling Green, the heart of New Amsterdam and the center (north and south) of the Geater New York. Here some believe Peter Minuit purchased the Island of Manhattan in 1626. It was known as the Plaine and the Marckveldt in Dutch days and later as the Market Field and the Parade. Here were held the Dutch weekly market and annual kermess, and here the soldiers of the fort paraded. In 1732 it was ordered fenced in and was leased at one peppercorn a year for eleven years to three citizens for a private BozvUng Green, the lease being renewed for a second eleven years, at 20 shillings per annum.* 2 The Stamp Act Riot centered here in 1765, when Gov. Colden's coach, containing his effigy, was burned. Here, in 1770, was set up the gilded leaden equestrian statue of George III (made in London by Wilton, who also made a replica), which was torn down by the mob July 9, 1776, after the reading of the Declaration of Independence. The lead was converted into bullets for the patriots, but the stone cap of the pedestal and the tail and bridle of the horse may yet be seen in the rooms of the New York Historical Society. The stone cap was used as a tombstone to mark the remains of Captain J. Smith (see the inscription upon its face), and later was used as a doorstep by the Van Voorst family of Jersey City. The leaden pieces were dug up on a farm in Connecticut. The head of the statue was rescued by Cox, the proprietor of the tavern at Kings- bridge, and later given up to the British authorities. The iron fence was brought from England in 1771; the iron balls crowning the posts were broken off during the Revolution. Here the Federal Procession of 1787 was reviewed by Washington, and the Federal Ship of State, made and presented by the ship car- penters of New York, remained on the Bowling Green until 1789. Here, in 1794, occurred a riotous public meeting to protest against the Jay Treaty. About 1797 the Green assumed its present oval form. See the bronze statue of Abraham de Peyster, Mayor in 1691-5, and holder of many colonial offices 1685-1721. It was erected by John Watts de Peyster, George E. Bissell, sculptor. 17 HISTORICAL GUIDE i8 Bowling Green MANHATTAN i Route 5. Custom House, site of Fort Amsterdam A traders' fort, the original log blockhouse of 1615, probably occupied this site. Fort Amsterdam was begun in 1626, by Minuit, and was completed in 1633-5 by a structure of earth and stone with four bastions, the main gate opening on the Bowling Green. The fort contained the Director- General's house and the Church of St. Nicholas, or the Church in the Fort, erected in 1642, and mother of the Collegiate Dutch churches. To honor the rulers of the Colony the name of the fort was changed successively to James, William Hendrick, William, Anne and George. After the demolition of the fort in 1790 the Government House was erected here as a presidential mansion, but was occupied by Governors Clinton and Jay. Later it was used as a custom house and was burned in 1815, when the land was sold and private residences erected thereon, which afterwards became known as Steamship Row. In 1902-7 the present Custom House was erected, Cass Gilbert, architect. See in the Collector's Office an inscription over the fire- place stating the history of the site. The statuary on the building is by D. C. French and represents the continents and the great trading nations of ancient and modern times.* 3 See note p. 22. In Battery Park, opposite the west side of the Custom House, see the 6. Fort George Monument, erected in 1818 by the City Cor- poration to mark the site of the southwest bastion of Fort George, This stone was unearthed during the excavation for the subway and was reinstated in 1907 through the action of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society and the New York Historical So- ciety. Go down State Street to Whitehall Street, passing 7. Tablet at 10 Pearl Street, near State Street, erected by the Holland Dames of New Netherlands, incorrectly placed here to mark the site of the first city hall (see .33). 8. 7 State Street, now a home for immigrant girls, one of the mansions of a century ago, on what was in 1800 one of the most fashionable residential streets. 9 State Street is the site of the home of John Morton, the \" rebel banker.\" 19 Route I HISTORICAL GUIDE Bowling g. Tablet, at 51 Whitehall Street, erected in 1904 by the Mary Washington Colonial Chapter of the Daughters of the Ameri- can Revolution, marks the site of Whitehall Ferry, where Washing- ton made his departure from New York in 1783. Schreyers' Hoek or Capske was the name given to the extreme end of the island, in commemoration of the Schreyers' Hoek in Amsterdam from which ships set sail for America, Capske Rocks lay just south, beyond the original shore line. They were uncovered during the recent excavation for the South Ferry subway station. Go north on Whitehall Street. Whitehall Street was named for 10. Governor Sfuyrc'esanf's House, erected in 1658, later called the White Hall which stood on what is now the southwest corner of Pearl and Whitehall Streets. In Dutch times it was called the Marckveldt, later Beurs or Exchange Street.* 4 Perel Straet in Dutch days extended east only as far as Whitehall Street, and was probably so called because of the \" pearly shells \" found near it on the beach. It was laid out in 1633 and some of the first Dutch houses were built along it, under the guns of the fort. Pearl Street east of Whitehall Street was here called the Strand. The site of the 11. First (wooden) Dutch Church wac at 39 Pearl Street, not at 33, as is often stated. 12. Tablet, at 23 Whitehall Street, erected in 1902 by the Knickerbocker Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, to mark the site of the house of Dominie Bogardus, whose wife, Anneke Jans, owned the farm which became the property of Trinity Church. Go east on Stone Street. Stone Street was first known as Brouwer Straet, because on it was the Company's brewery (at No. lo); it was called Stone Street from the fact that it was the first New York street to be paved (with cobblestones in 1657). Adam Roelandsen taught the first school of New Amsterdam in liis house on this street (about No. 7).* 5 The West India Company's five stone shops were on the site of the Merchants' Building. Go through the Stone Street entrance of the Produce Exchange, 20 Green MANHATTAN i Route 13. Tablet (on the rear wall of the Produce Exchange, facing the court), erected by the Huguenot Society of America to mark the site of the first Huguenot Church, built in 1688. The White Horse Inn was at the northeast corner of Stone and Whitehall Streets. 14. Marketfield Street is the little street facing the court of the Produce Exchange and in Dutch days was known as Marckveldt Stccgie -(lane) when it connected with the Marckveldt proper. In English days it was called Petticoat Lane, possibly because it was a favorite shopping district for the ladies. Go north on New Street. New Street was so called because opened later than other streets in the vicinity (1679). Go west on Exchange Place and dozvn Broadway. Note the hill, a trace of VerJettenhcrgh (Verlett's Hill), corrupted to Flatten Barrack by the English ; once a favorite coasting place. 15. Tablet, at 50 Broadway, erected by the Society of Archi- tecture and Ironmasters of New York, on the Tower Building to mark it as the earliest example of a skeleton-frame steel structure, originated and designed in 1888-9 by Bradford Lee Gilbert. 16. Tablet, 41 Broadway, erected by the Holland Society, to mark the site of the first white men's houses in Manhattan. They were built in 1613 by Adrian Block who, when his ship, the Tiger, was burned, built the Unrest near this spot. Note. — So says Booth's \" History of New York.'* Innes locates this at the foot of Roosevelt Street, East River. Tlie brook running to the foot of Roose- velt Street was long known as the Old Wreck Brook, and the cove at this part of the East River shore might well have furnished shelter to a small craft during winter storms. 39 Broadway is the site of the McComb Mansion, where Washington lived in 1790. Note the irregular frontage of buildings north, authorized by the city government. 17. Revolutionary cannon, 55 Broadway, forming part of the exterior railing. {Removed, 1912, to he }nountcd in Battery Park.) See the statues, by J. Massey Rhind, of Clinton, Wolfe, Stuyvesant and Hudson on Exchange Court, 52-56 Broadway. 21 Route I HISTORICAL GUIDE Bowling Green Go down Exchange Alley, by some supposed to be the old Tin Pot Alley {Tuyn Faat or Garden Lane), marked by a terra cotta tablet at the corner of Broadway. Valentine refers the name to i8. Edgar Street, connecting Trinity Place and Greenwich Street, one of the shortest streets in the city. See old residences and the Hotel Gruetli on the west side of Trinity Place. Edgar Street led to the Edgar Mansion on Greenwich Street, where April 8, 1834, Daniel Webster made an address to the people on the inauguration of Cornelius VV. Lawrence, first elected Mayor of New York. The West India Comf^any's Orchard and Garden occupied the land north of Exchange alley and west of Broadway. Note (5, p. 19).

(See \"The Church Farm\" in Excursion II). The bronze doors designed by St. Gaudens (the gift of W. W. As- tor) representing Biblical and local historic scenes, and the Astor Reredos (the gift of J. J. and Wm. Astor), In a passageway at the north of the Chancel are the effigy of Bishop Onderdonck, me- morial windows to other bishops and some stones from the old building. In the sacristy at the south side are several pictures and memorial tablets including one to a party of Scotchmen who were shipwrecked off the coast of Sandy Hook in 1783. Among the Trinity tombs not indexed are those of Francis and Morgan Lewis, the English governors Sir Henry Moore, Osborne and Delancey and the wife of Governor Clarke. Note the elevation of the yard above Trinity Place, a trace of the original bluffs along the Hudson River shore at this point. The Lutheran Church (1671-1776) stood at the corner of Rector Street and Broadway, this spot afterwards being the location of Grace Episcopal Churchy 1808-46. 23 HISTORICAL GUIDE 24 TRINITY CHURCHYARD.

The Land Poort, or gate, was at Broadway and the Water Poort at Pearl Street where a Half Moon Battery was located. Bastions stood on the sites of the rear of Trinity Churchyard, 4 Wall Street, the Sub-Treasury, 44 Wall Street and the head of Hanover Street. In 1673 the western line of the palisade was turned south to the shore at Rector Street, the wall was surveyed and Wall Street officially established in 1685 by Governor Dongan.* 7 20. Site of the First Presbyterian Church, just east of the head of New Street. Here Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield preached. The building was used as a hospital by the British during the Rcvolntion. (Excursion II, 17, and Excursion V, Section i:io.) Note the jog in the sidewalk at the northwest corner of Nassau Street (old Picwoman's Lane or Kip Street) over which Federal Hall projected. 21. The Sub-Treasury, on the site of the Colonial City Hall (i(>99-i8i2). riie old building contained the Court Rooms, Common Council Chamber, jail, a debtors' prison, accommodations for • the fire department and a library, the predecessor of the New York So- ciety Library. In front, at the head of Broad Street, stood the cage, pillory, stocks and whipping post. Here was won the Zenger Case securing the freedom- of the press, and here, in 1765, the Stamp Act Congress met. In 1785 it was used as the State Capitol and here the Continental Congress met. In 1788 the building was reconstructed by Major Pierre Charles I'Enfant (who later planned the City of Washington) and was known as Federal Hall. It was used by the first Congress under the Constitution. Here Washington took the oath of office on April 30, 1789. When the capital was removed to Philadelphia, this building became the State Capitol and so remained luilil 1797. Hero, in 1804. the New York Historical Society was founded. In .1812 the builduig was torn down and the present building erected as the Custom House which in 1862 was remodeled for a Sub- Treasury Note the statue of Washington by J. Q. A. Ward, erected in 1W3 by public subscription under the auspices of the Chamber 26 Street MANHATTAN 2 Route 27 Route 2 HISTORICAL GUIDE Wall of Commerce At the foot of this statue there was formerly a great .I'lb of brown stone on which Washington stood while taking the oith of office. It has been enclosed in a bronze frame, covered with Plas. and placed upon the south wall of the interior of the buildmg. Part of the railing of the balcony from which Washington delivered his first inaugural address is in the building of the New York His- torical Society and a second part is in front of Bellevue Hospital. The tablet on the west front of the Sub-Treasury was erected in 1905 by the Ohio Company of Associates to commemorate the passage by the Congress here assembled in 1787 of the Ordinance of 1787, and the purchase by the Ohio Company of Associates of lands in the North- west Territory on which, in 1788, they made their first settlement at Marietta. The tablet on the east front represents Washington in prayer ,at Valley Forge (presented by John T. Clancy; J. E. Kelley, sculptor), erected February 22, 1907, by Lafayette Post, No. 140, G. A. R. 22. The U. S. Assay Office, 32 Wall Street, built in 1823 pn the site of the Verplanck mansion, formerly used as the United Sta^s Rank and Treasury, is the oldest federal building now standing jin Manhattan. Alexander Hamilton's law ofifice stood at 33 (formetily 57) Wall Street, on the site of the Mechanics' National Bank. 23. Bank of the Manhattan Company, 40 Wall Street, the second oldest bank of New York, founded by the Manhattan Com- pany in i7oq which, by the aid of Aaron Burr, was chartered ostensibly to sui)ply New York with drinking water. Within the bank is a piece of the old wooden water pipe; the Manhattan water tank still stands on Centre Street, near Duane (Excursion 111:23). The Merchants' Bank, 42 Wall Street, is the third oldest bank, or>^.ini/.c(l ill 1S03. 24. The corner stone ot' the Bank of New York is at the nf)riheast corner of Wall and William Streets and bears the followi'tig inscription : \" This corner-stone of the Bank of New York was laid June 22, 1797, by Gulian Verplanck, Esq., the President, Geo. Doolett, Architect.\" This is the oldest New York bank and one of the oldest three iji the United States. It was founded by Alexander Hamilt«)n and otliers in 1784. at the Merchants' ColTee House.* 7 'I On the corner of Wall and William Streets (near Governor Tryon's house) stood the marble statue of William Pitt, erected: there in 1770 to honor his defence of the rights of the colonists. It was 28 Street MANHATTAN 2 Route mutilated by British soldiers and may now be seen in the building of the New York Historical Society. At 52 Wall Street, in the Directors' Room of the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company, is the corner stone of the United States Branch Bank, which formerly occupied this site. The stone is dated June 13, 1797. 25. Tablet, 56 Wall Street, erected by the Canadian Society of New York, in 1903, to commemorate Morris Robinson, first president of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, who here established the business of modern life insurance on the American Continent. 26. The old U. S. Custom House (now remodeled and the property of the National City Bank) occupies the site of the Mer- chants' Exchange (burnt in the fire of 1835) ; became the Custom House in 1862. 27. Tontine Building, Wall Street, between Pearl and Water Streets, is on the site of the Tontine Coffee House (1793) where the Chamber of Commerce and many other organizations met. The Merchants' Coffee House was erected in 1740 on the southeast corner, and the region was known as Coffee House Slip. Here were held several important demonstrations by the patriots before the Revolution. 28. Site of the Meal Market, also used as a city slave market, in the middle of Wall, near Water Street. Washington landed at Mur- ray's Wharf near by, April 23, 1789, when he came to be inaugurated. Note, 1912: The Assay Office (22, p. 28) is to be torn down in 1913 to make way for a larger structure for the same uses. 2Q Route 3 HISTORICAL GUIDE Pearl Street ROUTE 3 SECTION III.-PEARL AND BROAD STREETS. This part of Pearl Street was in early days known as the Road to the Ferry. Go south on Pearl Street. 29. At 119-121 Pearl Street lived Gen. Jean Victor Moreau, who tried to assassinate Napoleon Bonaparte. Captain Kidd lived on the same site about 1691. Hanover Square, named for George I of Hanover, was the fa~hi. .liable center, and \"Printing House Square\" of English New V'^rk. 30. Tablet on Cotton Exchange, erected by the New York Historical Society, to mark the site of the first New York newspaper office, Bradford's New York Gazette, 1725. Other papers were pub- lished near by. William Street (named for William of Orange, later William III). I. el ween Stone and Pearl Streets, was Burger's Path. North of Stone Street it was Sniee or Smith Street, opened 1656-7. 31. Marble tablet, 90 Pearl Street, commemorates the great fire of 1835, which destroyed $20,000,000 worth of property, between Wall Street (the old Merchants' Exchange) and Coenties Slip, and led to the more rapid completion of the Croton Aqueduct. 32. Tablet, 81 Pearl Street, erected by the New York Historical Society, marks the site of Bradford's first printing press (1693). ^:^. Tablet, 73 Pearl Street, erected by the Holland Society, to mark the site of Kieft's Stadt Herbergh or Tavern (1641-2), which 1)1 came tlie Stadt Hitys, or first City Hall of New York (1653-4). Coenties Alley, or Sladt Htiys Lane, is the original street from the shore to Iloogh (Stone) Street. The Stadt Huys was used as a jail, debtors' prison, court house, city hall and public storehouse. Governor Lovelace had a tavern next door. A well, pillory and stocks were located on the river shore in front of the Stadt Huys. 34. Coenties Slip is named for Conraet (\"Coenties\") Ten l.yck. who lived here. The \"Slip\" was not filled in until about 1835, iiid the site is occupied by Jeannette Park, named for the Herald Arctic K.xpedition .ship. Part of the Erie Canal fleet lies here.*S 35. Fraunces Tavern, 54 Pearl Street, corner of Broad Street <^sec Excursion VI). Ale^\" lJim*''\"Eichair/c. \"''\"'''^ ^^'\"*' ^\"'^ ^''^\"'^ Fraunces Tavern, was the first 30 Broad Street MANHATTAN 3 Route Opposite Fraunces Tavern, to the west, see the Bush Terminal Company's building; style, eleventh century Gothic, with gargoyles of old mariners' heads (as the upper floor is occupied by the \" Jolly Mariners\" dining club). Pearl Street was the original shore line from the east side of Whitehall Street north. At the foot of Broad (near Pearl) Street the Great Dock was located in Governor Dongan's time. Gradually the shore line was extended to Water, Front and South Streets, but the work was not completed until after the Revolution. Go Up Broad Street. \" Blommaert' s Vly \" was a swampy region, extending along Broad Street from Exchange Place to South William Street, originally imperfectly drained by a creek running through the present Broad Street, which the Dutch converted into a ditch in 1647 and the Heere Gracht or canal in 1657. A street was laid out on either side of the canal, and it became a favorite residence district. After becoming a public nuisance, it was filled in in 1676. Traces of the swamp are found during the construction of tall buildings, it being necessary to ex- cavate many feet to secure solid foundations. At Bridge Street a small bridge crossed the canal. Stone Street, east of Broad Street, was the Dutch Hoogh or High Street, in English days Duke Street, connecting with Pearl Street at Hanover Square, as part of the old Road to the Ferry. Beaver Street, called Bever Gracht, led to the swamp in Broad Street, and was drained by a small canal or ditch. Go east on South William Street. 36. Site of the Horse Mill or Bark Mill, 32-34 South William Street. This was one of the first mills built by the West India Company (1626). In its upper story were held the first regular religious services (1628-33) of the Dutch Church. Here, August 29, 1664, '* by eight of the clock in the morning, at the Old Mill,\" took place the final exi:hange of the documents marking the surrender of New Amsterdam to the English (Innes). It was later used by the Jews until they erected their first synagogue on the opposite side of the street. For a time the building or a part of it was occupied by the negro slaves of the West India Company. 2,7. Mill Stones in the rear of i8 South William Street (or of 40 Beaver Street) supposed to have been used in this mill. Two of these stones have been placed in the foundation of the Temple Shearith Israel at 99 Central Park West, in commemoration of this first synagogue. Note. — So say some writers, but Innes states that the Jews never occupied Bark Mill and that their synagogue was on the north side of the street and several doors east of the old mill. He also believes that the present mill stones came from a later mill in this vicinity (see article on \"The Bark Mill\" in the \" Quarterly Federation of Churches,\" Vol. Ill, No. 5, 1905). 38. \" Mill Lane,\" also known as Ellets' or Elliotts' Alley (con- necting South William with Stone Street), was opened in 1656-7 to connect Slyck Steegh with Hoogh Street.

New York Stock Exchange, organized in 1792 by a group \"f brokers who met first under a buttonwood tree in front of 70 Wall Street, and held daily meetings a few months later at the Tontine Coffee House (see 27). After meeting in various places the present site, 10-12 Broad Street, was purchased in 1863. Traces of the old swamp made the con- truction of the present building (opened 1903) a difficult engineer- ing feat. The architect of the present building was George B. Post and the sculptor of the pediment (typifying the movement of American com- nurce) was J. Q. A. Ward. 3^ i Battery MANHATTAN 4 Route ROUTE 4. SECTION IV— THE BATTERY AND GOVERNOR'S ISLAND. Take Elevated R. R. to Battery Place or Subway to Bowling Green and walk west. The original Battery was a line of cannon extending from the foot of Greenwich Street to the intersection of Whitehall and' Water Streets. The work was begun by Governor Fletcher (1693) *^nd strengthened about 1750. The land beyond this line was under water until after 1800. 43, The Aquarium, built about 1807-11 as the South West Bat- tery, to defend New York, Land under water was ceded to the Congress by the city for this purpose. The fort, about 300 feet from shore, later called \" Castle Clinton,\" was built on a mole and con- nected with the city by a bridge. The embrazures for the 30 heavy guns may still be seen. In 1822 it was ceded to the State and in 1823 leased to the city and in 1824 was leased as a public amuse- ment hall, known as Castle Garden. It was roofed over, and was the scene of Lafayette's reception in 1824. In 1847 it became an opera house. Here Jenny Lind sang (1850) and Kossuth (1851) was re- ceived. In 1855 it became the Immigration Bureau (until 1891), and soon afterAvard the remainder of the Battery Park was filled in. In i8g6 the building was opened as an Aquarium, and was transferred in 1902 to the care of the New York Zoological Society. It is open free daily including Sundays (except Monday forenoons), from 10 A. M. until 4 p. M. in winter and from 9 a. m. until 5 p. m. in summer. See within tablets, pictures of the orignal interior, bombproofs, the old fireplace in the cellar and the original casemates.

Here he built a Bawmill an<l pastured Roats. In 1698 it was set aside by the Assembly for llic benefit of the royal K..vernors, hence its present name. It was temporarily n quarantine station for C.crman Protestants or Palatines in 1710. In 1730 it teramc iwrt of New York City and in 1788 of the County of New York. In 1755 Sir VNni. Pepi.(r« IPs rcKunent en route for Canada was quartered here. In April, 1776. C (ilontl IVcscott's Runker Hill repiment of Continental troops occupied the isl;:nd and threw up fortilications which they held until after the 34 Island MANHATTAN 4 Route Battle of Long Island, when all retreated in safety to Manhattan. The British held it from 1776 to 1783. Little remains of the old works except the well on the eastern side. In 1790 Columbia College was given jjossession of tlie island for a time with the right to lease it for a term of twenty-one years. The present fortifications were begun about 1794 and completed in 1812. Fort Columbus replaced part of the old works in 1809 and Castle Williams was com- pleted in 181 1. In 1800 the island was ceded by the State to the Federal gov- ernment, and in 1821 it became a military headquarters. In 1852 it was the chief depot of the United States Recruiting Service and military prisoners were confined here during the Civil War. In 1878 the island became the head- quarters of the Department of the East. Take Governor's Island Ferry, near the Barge OMce. After landing, take central path, passing on the left the department offices and on the right piles of old ordnance. The Military Museum contains many relics of former wars. Fort Jay (old Fort Columbus) has a well preserved moat, draw- bridge, parapet and guns. The barracks here are still in use. Castle Williams is used as a military prison.* 12 Note the Saluting Battery on the south shore. Much land has been reclaimed from the bay. The South East Battery is a small work well preserved. The Chapel of St. Cornelius contains several trophies and com- memorative banners. The house of the Commander of the De- partment of the East is on the old Parade Ground, flanked by two cannon. Interesting water trips may also be made from the Battery to the Statue of Liberty (boats hourly, 25 cents), on Bedloe's or Liberty Island. This island was patented to Isaac Bedloe by Governor Nicoll when it was known as Oyster Island (called for a short time Love Island). Captain Kennedy became the proprietor after the death of Bedloe. In 1758 the island was purchased by the city for a small-pox hospital. About 1800 it was ceded to the United States. Fort Wood was built here as a defence for the city. Within the star-shaped fort is the Statue of Liberty, by Bartholdi, completed in 1883 and presented by France. The pedestal was erected by popular subscription in the United States ; the statue was unveiled in 1886. Note the view from the head of the statue over the Bay, Staten Island, Long Island, Manhattan and New Jersey.* 13 Ellis Island (pass secured from the Commissioner of Immigration; boats frequently from Pier i, North River). In Dutch days this was a favorite resort for oyster feasts, hence called Oyster Island. Later it was known as Gibbet Island from Ae fact that a pirate by the name of Gibbs was hung there. It was sold by the State to the National Government in 1808 and was long occupied by a magazine. In 1891 it became an immigrant station and, after a fire in 1897, the present buildings were erected. 35 HISTORICAL GUIDE 36 MANHATTAN ADDENDA— 1912 * I.

The site on which Fraunces Tavern stands was originally on or nearly on the edge of the shore line of the East River, subsei|uently extended two or more blocks by the filling-in process. In or before 1671 it came into the i)os- session of Col. Stephen Van Cortlandt, son of Oloff Stevenson Van Cortlandt, a soldier of the Dutch West India Company, who arrived at New Amsterdam in 1637 and was appointed Commissary or Superintendent of Cargoes at the Port of New Amsterdam. In 1642 he married Annetje Loockerman, sister of the leading merchant of New Amsterdam and an Indian trader. He estab- lished a brewery on \" Brouwer (brewery) Straat \" now Stone Street, about 1648, was Burgomaster 1655-65 and one of the Commissioners to arrange for the surrender of New Amsterdam. His descendants were lords of Van Cort- landt Manor. Col. Stephen Van Cortlandt built a cottage on the corner of Broad and Dock (later Queen), now Pearl Street, in 1671 and brought his young wife, Gertrude Schuyler, here to live. The \"Gracht\" or Canal lay in front of the house until it was filled up in 1678. In 1700 he deeded his property to his son-in-law, Etienne (or Stephen) DeLancey, a Huguenot nobleman and an active merchant in the city. INDEX TO PLATE VIII. 4.

It descended to his son, Judge and Governor James DeLancey, and to his son, Oliver DeLancey. At some time before 1757, it became the residence of Col. Joseph Robinson, partner of Oliver DeLancey, James DeLancey having moved to his mansion on site of present No. 113 Broadway. (Excursion I, 25.) 1757. — It became the store and warehouse of DeLancey, Robinson & Co., who announced in Gaines' Mercury, May 28, 1757, that they had \" moved into Col. Robinson's late dwelling next to the Royal Exchange, and should there continue to sell all sorts European and East Indian goods — shoes, shirts, white and checked, for the army, with a variety of other goods.\" 1762. — January 15. — Purchased by Samuel Fraunces, called *' Black Sam,\" from his swarthy appearance, he being a West Indian. Fraunces had been made a \" freeman \" of New York while an innkeeper in 1755. He opened here the Queen's Head or Queen Charlotte Tavern, named in honor of the young consort of George III. 1765. — Leased to John Jones as a tavern, while Fraunces for a time took charge of Vauxhall Gardens. (Excursion I, 21.) 1766. — Leased by Bolton & Sigell (Sigel). 1768. — April 8. — The Chamber of Commerce, composed of twenty- four importers and merchants, organized, with John Cruger as President, in the Long Room, so called in imitation of the long Indian lodges used for tribal meetings. Monthly meetings of the Chamber were held for some time \"at Bolton & Sigel's, precisely at the usual hour, six-thirty.\" 1769. — Richard Bolton alone in charge. One or more meetings were held to consider the passagei of a second Non-Importation Agree- ment. (Wilson's Memorial History, II, 39I-7-) 1770. — Fraunces again In possession of the Queen's Head Tavern, \" refitted in the most genteel and convenient manner for the reception and entertainment of those gentlemen, ladies and others who used to favor him with their company,\" dinners and suppers being served \"not only to lodgets but to those who live at a convenient distance.\" The Long Room was also used for a series of lectures. 43 Route 3 HISTORICAL GUIDE Fraunces ,-7,_ Vprii_Thc Sons of Liberty and the Vigilance Committee met ' here to protest, as the ship London had just docked at the wharf of the East India Company in the vicinity of Fraunces lavern with a cargo of tea. The meeting resuhed in those who partici- pated marching to the dock, where the entire cargo was thrown t)verbuard. ,774._May 14.— A meeting of merchants was held here to organize the \"Committee of Correspondence,\" to whose firm and coiv sistent adherence to the idea of union, the Continental Congress owed its origin. (Wilson, II, p. 434-) It was also the head- quarters of the Social Club, among whose members were John Jay, Gouverneur Morris, R. R. Livingston and Morgan Lewis. l775._Thc Massachusetts delegates to the Second Continental Con- gress stopped here on their way to Philadelphia. l775._August 23.— The building was struck by a shot from the man- of-war Asia, giving rise to the oft-quoted lines of Philip Freneau : \" Scarce a broadside was ended till 'nother began again, By Jove,! It was nothing but fire away, Flanagan! Some thought him saluting his Sallys and Nancys, 'Till he drove a round shot through the roof of Sam Francis.\" TA. of 1786 reads: \" At first we supposed it was only a sham. Till he drove a round ball through the roof of black Sam.\" 1776. — Fraunces' daughter Phoebe revealed the plot to assassii ate Washington, leading to the execution of her lover, Hickey, who was a British deserter and had become one of Washington's bodyguard. At the time Phoebe was acting as housekeeper for the Commander at his headquarters in the Richmond Hill Mansion (Excursion II). Fraunces joined the American army, and it is supposed that he had to give up the Tavern during the British occupancy of New York, but he assumed ownership im- mediate''v after the war and continued in possession for some years, in jtS*; he became Washington's steward. 1783-— November 25.— Governor George Clinton gave a banquet on Evacuation Day to General Washington, the French ambassador, Chevalier de la Luzerne, and many Revolutionary officers and civilians. Thirteen toasts were given, beginning with \"The United States of America\" and ending with \"May This Day Be a Lesson for l*rinces.\" JMieworks followed on the BowHng Green. 44 Tavern . MANHATTAN 3 Route 1783. — December 4. — Washington's Farewell to forty-four officers, in- cluding Generals Greene, Knox, Wayne, Steuben, Carroll, Lincoln, Kosciusko, Moultrie, and Hamilton, Governor Clinton, Colonel Tallmadge and others. Says Colonel Tallmadge, in original jour- nal, now at Fraunces Tavern : \" We had been assembled but a few minutes when His Excellency entered the room. His emotion, too strong to be concealed, seemed to be reciprocated by °very officer present. After partaking of a slight refreshment amid almost b/eathless silence, the General filled his glass with wine and turning to his officers said: 'With a heart full of love and gratitude I must now take my leave of you. I most devoutly wish that your latter days may be as pros- perous and happy as your former ones have been glorious and honorable.* Atler the officers had taken a glass of wine, the General added: 'I cannot come to each of you to take my leave, but shall be obliged to you if each will come and take me by the hand.' General Knox, being nearest to him, turned to the Commander-in-Chief, who, suffused in tears, was incapable of utterance, but grasped his hand, when they embraced each other in silence. In the same affectionate manner every officer in the room marched up to, kissed and parted with his General-in-Chief. Such a scene of sorrow and weeping I had never before witnessed, and hope I may never be called upon to witness again. Not a word was uttered to break the solemn silence that prevailed, or to interrupt the tenderness of the occasion.\" Thence Washington proceeded to the Whitehall Ferry (Excursion VII :g) and took his departure from the city. 1785. — The Tavern was sold by Fraunces and came into various hands. After the Revolution the St. Andrew's Society, the Governors of the New York Hospital, the New York Society and the Society for Promoting Arts and Agriculture, all met here. Balls were also held in the Long Room. 183 . — Interior partly burnt out and a flat roof added. 1837. — Leased by John Gardner, a hotel proprietor who had been burnt out in the great fire of 1835. 1844. — The New York Yacht Club was founded here. 1852, June 15.— While called the Broad Street House and kept by E. Beaumeyer, the Tavern was visited by a very disastrous fire, after which two stories were added, making it five stories high. Further alterations were made about 1890, when the taproom was lowered to the level of the street and the ground floor win- dows modernized. 1883, December 4. — On the looth anniversary of Washington's Farewell the Society of the Sons of the Revolution was formally organized in the Long Room and met here annually for many years. ^ 45 Route 3 HISTORICAL GUIDE Fraunces THE PRESERVATION OF FRAUNCES TAVERN. 1889-1903.— At the time of the centennial celebration of Washington's inauguration (1889), attention was directed to the interesting associations of the building, and during the next thirteen years the Sons of the Revolution made 'several efforts to purchase the property in order to preserve and restore it. Efforts were also made by patriotic individuals and societies to insure its preservation. These finally resulted, in 1903, in the passage of an ordinance by the Board of Estimate and Apportionment to buy the Tavern and half a block on which it stands for a Revo- lutionary museum and park. In the spring of 1904 Messrs. Alexander R. Thompson, James Mortimer Montgomery and Robert Olyphant, on behalf of the Society of the Sons of the Revolution, successfully negotiated a contract for the purchase of the prop- erty. At the same time these gentlemen induced the city to rescind the resolution authorizing the taking of the property by condemnation. The mayor told them that they were the only delegation which had called on him for the purpose of saving the city's money. Thus the City of New York was saved the expense of acquiring the property, preserving and maintaining it, and yet the restoration of this shrine of patriotism was assured. At the time the property was purchased it was subject to a lease with several years to run. Before the lease expired Mr. Frederick Samuel Tallmadge, late president of the society, died, leaving a large bequest to the society. This furnished ample funds for the restoration of the Tavern, which was planned with the greatest care. i'/)4.- July 30.— Transfer of the property to the Sons of the Revo- lution recorded in the Register's Office. 100A7.- Restoration of the building. !-;••/.

The Society of the Sons of the Revolution has been instituted to perpetuate the memory of the men who achieved American inde- pendence, to promote and assist in the proper celebration of Washing- ton's Birthday, the Fourth of July, and the battles and prominent events 01 the War of the Revolution; to collect and preserve records and memorials relative to that war; to inspire among the members and their descendants the patriotic spirit of their forefathers, and respect for the principles for which the patriots of the Revolution contended. The Society now has over twenty-two hundred members in the State of New York. Note. — For other historic events in the neighborhood of Fraunces Tavern (Map, p. 40), see Excursion VII, New York City South of Wall Street. 47 2 Route MANHATTAN Fraunces Tavern THE BUILDING AND ITS RESTORATION There is no known view of Fraunces Tavern before 1854. Fraunces' own description when he offered the building for sale in 1776 reads as follows: \"The Queen's Head Tavern is three stories high, with a tile and lead roof, has fourteen fireplaces, a most excellent large kitchen, tine dry cellars, with good convenient offices, etc.\" The view of New York from Brooklyn Heights, in 1798, shows its top as gambrel-roofed and hipped. See Hollyer's print of its proposed restoration in Mrs. Pierce's \" Landmark of Fraunces Tavern.\" Also see views in the Magazine of American History, Vol. VIII, p. 144, and in Bryant and Gay's \" Popular History of the U. S.,\" showing alterations in the first story. The architect of the restored building was William H. Mersereau and the contractor S. A. McGuire. Mr. Mersereau has endeavored to restore the building so far as possible to its original form. When the added stories were taken down he studied and followed the old roof-lines and rafters. The modern bricks and stone were removed and yellow bricks to match the originals were imported from Hol- land for the Broad Street side, and on the Pearl Street side the old style red bricks were matched with bricks from old dwellings in the vicinity of Baltimore, Md. The first floor was raised to its former level, the windows changed to conform with the original ones and the Long Room restored to its old dimensions. All the original timbers were retained above and below the Long Room and every brick and piece of lumber, so far as possibL, of the original building was left in place. The present appearance of the building is believed to be practically the same as during the Revolutionary period. The first floor is still used as a restaurant.* On the second floor is the celebrated Long Room; note the portraits of Frederick Samuel Tallmadge and John Austin Stevens, the table made from old timbers of the building and the tablets. In the Museum on the third floor are cases holding Revolutionary relics— flags, china, coins, medals, military commissions, letters, deeds and other old documents, including the original deeds of the Tavern, showing the transfer of the property from the De Lanceys and subse- quent owners. The Library is devoted mainly to American History and the men and events of the Revolution. The top floor is used as a dining-room for members of the Society, and on the walls is a collection of engraved portraits of Washington. A caretaker dressed in the style of the Revolution explains the exhibits to visitors. •Select reitaurant for ladies and scntlcnu-n. .1 la carte, Emil Westerburg, proprietor. 48 NOTES NOTE BY ASA BIRD GARDINER The Gardner family, who acquired the Tavern in 1837, came from Fifeshire, Scotland, about 1760, and had no connection with the Gardiner family. The name of the lessee was Robert, not John, and he had not been a hotel proprietor. The property descended in the female line to the Keteltas family, from whom the Sons of the Revolution purchased the property. The Story of Phoebe Fraunces (p. 44) is of doubtful origin; it is also doubtful whether Samuel Fraunces ever served in the American Army. He was probably a mild Tory, and continued to keep the tavern for British Officers during the Revolution. 48a NOTES. 48b EXCURSION NO. I.— CITY HALL TO WALL STREET.

This part of New York was not settled until long after the Dutch flag ceased to wave over New Amsterdam, City Hall Park was the old Dutch Vlacte (Flai) or pasture, later called the Common, granted to the city cor- poration in 1686 by the Dongan charter. During the later English period and the days of the Revolution it was a place for public demonstrations, mass meetings, etc. It was fenced in about 1785, and an iron rail fence was pro- vided in 1821, with gates on the south, west and east sides. The main thoroughfare was lower Broadway, Chatham Street (now Park Row) and the Bowery. The shore line has been extended two or three blocks on either side. The King's Farm, which lay west of Broadway, between Wall and Warren Streets, originally belonged to the West India Company and was later granted, together with the Jans or Bogardus Farm north of Warren Street (Excursion II) to Trinity Church. Many of the street names have a direct connection with early residents. Note. — The * refers to Addenda, 1912, pp. 65-6. Ss HISTORICAL GUIDE ROUTE 5.

City Hall, a fine example of the Italian Renaissance, John McComb, Jr., architect. The foundation stone was laid on the site of the old almshouse by Mayor Edward Livingston, September 20, 1803. The front and sides are of Stockbridge (Mass.) marble, the rear built of brownstone from motives of economy; the common assertion that it was due to the idea that the city would not extend north of the building being untrue, as the city had already advanced beyond Chatham Square. The building was first occupied by the city government on Aug. 12, 181 1, although it was not completed until 1812, in the mayoralty of DeWitt Clinton. Among the important events celebrated here were the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Man- hattan by Henry Hudson, Captain Hull's victory over the British ship Guerriere, the visit of Lafayette in 1824, the opening of the Erie Canal, November 4, 1825; the Croton Water opening, October 14, 1842; the laying of the Atlantic Cable, 1858 (at which time the building caught fire and was badly injured) ; the funeral of General Worth, 1857; the visit of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, i860, and the 250th anniversary of the City Charter, 1903. The building is open from 10 to 4; Saturday 10 to 12. Ascend the spiral staircase to the Governors* Room; see por- traits of Washington and General James Clinton by Trumbull, Peter Stuyvesant, Alexander Hamilton and governors from 1777; busts of DeWitt Clinton and Henry Clay; a copy of Lincoln's Gettysburg speech ; a section of Stuyvesant's pear tree ; punch bowl used at the Erie Canal celebration; portraits of Hudson and Stuyvesant; two desks of Washington and the furniture used in the former City Hall by the Federal Congress (Excursion VII, 21). A good view of the park and its surroundings may be obtained from the balcony.* i The Aldermanic Chamber contains some portraits and a paint- ing symbolic of New York City's commercial greatness. In the ad- joining Committee Room are portraits of Harry Howard in the uni- form of a Volunteer Fireman and of General McClellan. The old Council Chamber, now used by the Board of Estimate and Apportion- ment, contains portraits of national celebrities. On the ground floor are the Mayor's Reception Room contain- ing portraits of Lafayette and of former mayors, and on the ceiling plaster reproductions of seals of the United States, of New York State and City from early days; the City Library, comprising 7,000 volumes, some of great value, and the Bureau of Marriage Licences. S3 Route 5 HISTORICAL GUIDE City Hall In the corridor see a marble tablet, erected in 1903, between md descriptive of two tablets (originally on the roof) containing the names of the architect, sculptor and of the building committee. Oil the opposite wall note the Dutch and Federal standard yard measure. In ihe basement are the Marriage Room, Bureau of Licenses and some rooms once used as prison cells when the Police Headquarters were here. Outride, beneath the Mayor's Window, see the tablet commemorat- iui? the reading of the Declaration of Independence to the army here, in Washington's presence, July 9, 1776. (See painting of this event in the New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West Forty-second Street). A tablet in the sidewalk in front of the building marks the first excavation for the Rapid Transit Tunnel in 1900; another tablet in tiu- City Hall Subway Station commemorates the opening of the Turiul in 1904. A portion of the tunnel of the once proposed Pneu- matic Rapid Transit Railway, constructed in 1868, still remains un- der Broadway along the Park. The Biiiiczi'dl or common jail, built in 1775, and used by the r.ritish as a prison, stood between Broadway and the site of City Hall. It was torn down in 1838, the stones being used to build the old Tombs Prison. Its great lock and key are in the building of the New York Historical Society. 2. The Statue of Nathan Hale, by Mac Monnies, near Broad- way, opposite Murray Street, was erected by the Sons of the Revolution. ( b:xcMrsion V. Section 7.) Now near E. wing of City Hall. 3. New York Post OfBce, the third building used in the city for the purpn.sc, built in 1875 on part of City Hall Park ceded in 1867 by the City to the National Government. Within the corridor, near the western entrance, is a tablet erected in 1897 by the Mary Wash- ington Colonial Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolu- tion to commemorate the erection of the Liberty Pole and the Battle of (Jojden Hill (see 33 and 38). One Liberty Pole stood on the City Conmion about the middle of Mail Street and another stood near Ilroadway at Warren Street. lu the southeast corridor is a bust and memorial tablet in honor of Postmaster IVarson for his services in reforming the postal .system. 54 Park MANHATTAN 5 Route 4„ Fountain, erected about 1873 j^ist north of the site of the original fountain of 1842 which celebrated the opening of the Croton Aqueduct.

The new Hall of Records at Centre and Chambers Streets. See the statues of Duane, Colden, Hone, Heathcote, Stuyvesant, De Vries and Clinton by Philip Martiny ; allegorical statues by Martiny and Bush-Brown ; groups representing the recording of the purchase of Manhattan in 1626 and the consolidation of Greater New York, 1898, by Albert Weinert. The interior of the building is well worth a visit. The Register will allow visitors to inspect the old city records and maps dating back to Dutch days.* 2 8. Site of the iirst Free School building of New York City in Ot- tendorfer Square. It was erected in 1809 on what was then called Tryon Row, corner of Chatham Street, near the new terminal of the Brooklyn Bridge. Go south along the edge of the Park to the 9. Tablet, erected in 1907 by the Mary Washington Colonial Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, on a granite monument in the Park, nearly opposite the Brooklyn Bridge terminal, marking the site of the old Register's Office which was built in 1758 as a debtors* prison. It became the Provost or British military prison during the Revolution and was the scene of great brutality to prison- ers on the part of Provost-Marshall Cunningham. On the second floor (called derisively \" Congress Hall \") were confined prisoners of note, among them Ethan Allen. Beneath the building were four gloomy dungeons. The building was torn down in 1903 to make way for the Subway. During its demolition coins, buttons and human bones were found in the excavation. Go down Park Row on the line of the early road to Stuyvesant's Bowery (Excursion III., Section 2), and later forming a portion of the Post Road. 55 HISTORICAL GUIDE ^ tn oT ^r'. ^ c ^ .2 i?
