        "text": "Since he was born out of wedlock and his mother was disinherited because of her affair, both parents had to work to provide for their family. They would be considered lower middle class by today's standards, but did have bouts of poverty in John's early years.\n\nEducation and Influences\n\nAfter Fremont's father died in 1818, his family moved to Charleston, South Carolina where he grew up in a society that valued wealth and background over most other traits. Because of his modest upbringing, Fremont was described as ambitious, tenacious, and willing to prove his own abilities. He went to Charleston College in 1829 and taught mathematics and science in country schools. In 1831 he was expelled for attendance and left general academia.\n\nThat year he received patronage from Senator John Poinsett where he was given a position as a mathematics instructor in the US Navy on the USS Natchez. He resigned after a few years and became a commissioned officer in the topographical corps surveying railroads in the American south. When his patron John Poinsett became Secretary of War, he sent Fremont to help explorers navigate and survey lands between the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers.\n\nJohn Fremont's brief exposure to exploration during these survey jobs gave him a passion to travel and explore America's new frontiers. America was growing rapidly at this time period and there was a general need to create and verify the geography of the nation. The Louisiana territory was purchased nearly 30 years prior but was barely investigated by this time point. Growing tensions would cause the Mexican-American War, but the war would result in the United States purchasing several hundred thousand square miles of land from Mexico. Finally, in the 1840s, the Oregon Treaty added modern Washington, Oregon, and Idaho to the United States.\n\nMap of the territorial expansion of the United States\n\nEarly Fremont Expeditions\n\nIn the years after the Louisiana Purchase and the various explorations, the United States government viewed further expansion as inevitable. The Oregon region was identified as a possibility, but the area was relatively unknown. Fremont was sent in the summer of 1842 by Senator Lewis Linn to explore what would one day be the Oregon Trail and establish routes, determine fertility, and identify what resources existed. Along with famous mountain man Kit Carson, Fremont set out for Oregon with 25 men. Notably, Fremont climbed a mountain (now known as Fremont's Peak), planted the United States flag, and claimed all the last west of the Rocky Mountains as property of the United States.\n\nHis five month expedition was highly successful, having traveled through the Oregon country and taking numerous notes on the flora and fauna in the area. After returning, he was sent the next year on a second expedition to Oregon to map out the western portions of the territory and provide alternative routes. Failing to find alternative routes, he did explore the northern portions of the Great Salt Lake and successfully mapped much of Oregon. On his return he wrote a pamphlet detailing the ease of travel and the fertile nature of the land. This pamphlet was copied 10,000 times and distributed across the country to increase expansion sentiment.\n\nAfter the election of James Polk, John Fremont was sent on a third expedition to California. Growing tensions between the United States and Mexico meant that Polk was set on securing California. Fremont, now known as \"The Pathfinder,\" and 60 armed men left in the summer of 1845 to California. Arriving at Sutter's Fort near modern day Sacramento, they were quickly attacked by a detachment of Mexican soldiers. Being outnumbered, Fremont went north and at this time committed several atrocities against the Natives in the area. This included the Sacramento River Massacre and Klamath Lake Massacre. Native casualties range from 800-1500 depending on reports, and Kit Carson called the event \"perfect butchery.\"\n\nFremont Expedition's: 1847 and After\n\nFremont had legal issues involving a court martial during the Mexican-American War, and in an attempt to preserve his honor he went on a fourth expedition in 1848. The growing ideology of Manifest Destiny meant that people were moving west at a rapid pace. With private funding he attempted to map the areas between Sacramento, California and St. Louis, Missouri for plans to build a railroad. Due to poor weather conditions, the expedition was largely a failure, having lost a majority of his animals and supplies along with 10 men.\n\nA fifth expedition was done five years later in 1853 to again find a route for the transcontinental railroad along the 38th parallel. Weather conditions were again intense, but his expedition successfully traveled through the Rocky Mountains. After, Fremont wrote that he was confident that the railroad could exist, and his group proved travel across the Rocky Mountains in winter was possible. By the end of his career he had explored most of California, Nevada, and Oregon.\n\nFremont in the American Civil War\n\nAt the onset of the American Civil War, John Fremont was made a Major General by Abraham Lincoln and appointed commander of the Department of the West. His plan was to remove the Confederate forces from the border state of Missouri and send forces down the Mississippi River into Memphis, Tennessee. Abraham Lincoln gave Fremont total authority on how he wanted his campaign fought. His main goal was to protect Springfield and Cairo Illinois from Confederate forces and to extend army control south into Missouri.\n\nIn 1861, a political feud with Frank Blair, a relative of a Lincoln cabinet member, lead to another military inquest. It was determined by Blair and various other military officers that Fremont was wasting money and largely incompetent in army matters. A military committee determined that Fremont was making decisions bordering on embezzlement and corruption, and was removed from military expenditures in the future.\n\nLater in 1861, Springfield was captured by Confederate forces. Fremont along with General Pope and General Grant retook Springfield from the Confederates and secured a Union victory. This was the only victory in the Western campaign during the entire year of 1861.\n\nIn the same year, Fremont made some radical decisions in order to secure the border state of Missouri, which he viewed as a severe threat to the security of Springfield and the north as a whole. Without notifying Abraham Lincoln, Fremont put Missouri under court martial and declared that any civilian who would take up arms against the Union would be guilty of treason and punished by death and that all slaves were to be immediately emancipated. As Missouri was still a neutral state Lincoln feared this radical act would push them toward succession. This along with the report of embezzlement from the war department led to Fremont being dismissed from his post in 1861, officially being court martialed for his forced emancipation of Missouri.\n\nJohn Fremont was known for his explorations of the American west, but he also had numerous political exploits before and after the Civil War. After a brief stint as a senator for the state of California, he ran for president in 1856 for the Republican Party but was defeated by James Buchanan. He again ran for president for the Radical Republican party in 1864 but withdrew before the general election. His political career also extended after the Civil War in Arizona.\n\nCalifornia Politics\n\nDuring the Mexican American War, John Fremont commanded a small militia largely consisting of his original expedition. He fought largely in California against native Mexican settlers and was eventually named the Military Governor of California. Disobeying orders from Washington to step down and for his militia to join the United States army, he was arrested and court martialed in 1847. He was found guilty of the charge but his sentence was commuted and he was allowed back in the army. Though found guilty, his popularity among the America people as \"The Pathfinder\" was at an all-time high.\n\nWhen California became a state in 1850, Fremont was elected as one of its first senators. Viewed as a hero of Western expansion, many people in California viewed his court martial as unjust and out of jealousy. Fremont first began voting for emancipation and abolition during his tenure as senator, voting to not punish individuals who harbored runaway slaves, and eliminate the slave trade in Washington D.C.\n\nArizona Politics\n\nAfter some failed speculations in various railroads and mines, John Fremont was made nearly destitute by the Panic of 1873. During this low point of his career, President Hayes made Fremont the governor of the Arizona Territory in 1879. John Fremont spent very little time in the actual territory, and was given the ultimatum to move to the territory or resign. He resigned instead of moving to the territory in 1881.\n\nSeveral years later, John C. Fremont died in 1890 at the age of 77 from a bacterial infection called peritonitis."
