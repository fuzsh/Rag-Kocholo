    "text": "On January 21, 1813, John Charles Frémont, was born, his birth name either being Fremon or Frémon.[a] Frémont was born out of wedlock, a serious social handicap at the time. His mother, Anne Beverley Whiting, was the youngest daughter of socially prominent Virginia planter Col. Thomas Whiting. The colonel died when Anne was less than a year old. Her mother married Samuel Cary, who soon exhausted most of the Whiting estate. At age 17, Anne married Major John Pryor, a wealthy Richmond resident in his early 60s. In 1810, Pryor hired Charles Frémon (Louis-René Frémont b. 1768 in Québec), a French-Canadian immigrant who had escaped from a British prison, to tutor his wife. In July 1811, Pryor learned that his wife, Anne Whiting Pryor, and Frémon were having an affair. Confronted by Pryor, the couple left Richmond together on July 10, 1811, creating a scandal that shook city society. Pryor published a divorce petition in the Virginia Patriot, in which he charged that his wife had \"for some time past indulged in criminal intercourse.\" A household slave called Black Hannah helped raise young John.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMrs. Pryor and Frémon moved first to Norfolk, Virginia, to live as a couple (though unmarried); they later settled in Savannah, Georgia. Mrs. Pryor financed the trip and purchase of a house in Savannah by selling recently inherited slaves valued at $1,900. When the Virginia House of Delegates refused Mr. Pryor's divorce petition, it was impossible for the couple to marry. In Savannah, Mrs. Pryor took in boarders while Frémon taught French and dancing.\n\n\n\n\n\n..."
