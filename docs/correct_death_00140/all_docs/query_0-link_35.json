They were natives of Tennessee and were married in Ray County, Missouri. R. W. Patton's father, James E. Patton, was a native of Tennessee and came to Missouri in 1844. He entered land in Ray County and lived on his farm there until his death in 1872 at the age of 78 years. Lucetta Jane (Hale) Patton's father, Isaac Hale, was also a Tennesseean who came to Missouri about 1844 and entered land. His farm was near the Patton homestead. Mr. Hale did general farming and raised stock. He died at Richmond, Ray County, at the age of 80 years.\n\nR. W. Patton was a veteran of the Mexican War in which he served under Colonel Doniphan. Mr. Patton was a successful farmer and stock-raiser of the county. He died at his farm north of Richmond in 1892 at the age of 67 years. His wife died in 1869. The remains of both are buried in the Patton family cemetery. Their children were: W. C, a farmer at Weston. He spent 40 years in the drug and book business at Richmond, Mo. ; W.

He operated this business successfully until 1890 when he came to Albany and opened a drug and book store there. He ran this store with marked success for more than 20 years and at the end of that time sold the business to W. D. O'Neal who had been a clerk in the store for some time.\n\nOn May 8, 1915, Mr. Patton was appointed postmaster at Albany and was reappointed on Jan. 23, 1920.
