She was a most lovable young lady, and for the past year has been in delicate health. A short time ago she had a severe attack of erysipelas, and although she had recovered sufficiently to be about, it left her in a very weakened condition, and about two weeks ago she took to her bed and it was plainly apparent to all that her dissolution would rapidly come. Her illness was severe and painful, but all was borne uncomplainingly. In her times of consciousness she always expressed her gratitude to those about her for their care and attention. A day or two prior to her death extreme unction was administered and she died in the Catholic faith. The deceased was born March 25, 1876, and was aged 15 years, 6 months and 8 days.

BEACH - Sudden Death Comes To a Well Known Merchant - He Went To Sleep Feeling Slightly Ill but Never Awakened\n\nWithin the past few days Fort Wayne has lost two of her best known and substantial business men - men whose names have been household words for years and who did their part in increasing the material wealth of the city. We refer to John C. Eckert, who died Saturday, and Frederick J. Beach, whose death occurred very suddenly Sunday. The announcement of the death of Mr. Beach, member of the well-known hardware firm of Morgan & Beach, spread rapidly over the city Sunday afternoon. It was not known that he was ill, and, in fact, the attack which caused his death came very quickly. Saturday he was at his desk at the store in the morning and in the afternoon he spent the time trimming some trees at his East Berry Street home. In the evening he went downtown and spent some time with a number of old friends. Upon his return home he complained of slight pains in the arms and Dr. Sweringen was sent for. The physician did not anticipate anything serious, and after prescribing, left the house. Shortly after midnight Mr. Beach fell asleep and it was a sleep from which he never awakened. About six o'clock his wife went to the room to call him and received no response. She shook her husband, thinking him very sound asleep but a convulsive movement of the lower limbs was the only signs of life. Dr. Sweringen was sent for immediately and later Dr. Meyers was called, but no efforts upon the part of the physicians could arouse the patient, who gradually sank until death came at 12:30 o'clock p.m. The immediate cause of dissolution was locomotor staxis, superinducing paralysis. Frederick J. Beach was born in Berlin, Germany, September 21, 1832, and was consequently in his sixty-third year. He came to America in 1846 and came at once to this city, where he has since resided. He first entered the employ of Durrie & Co., hardware merchants, at the same stand now occupied by Morgan & Beach. In 1856 Oliver P. Morgan bought out the firm of Durrie & Co., and about two years later Mr. Beach was taken into partnership, since which time the firm has been known as Morgan & Beach, and is one of the best known in northern Indiana. In 1860 he was united in marriage to Miss Magdalene Adams, of Findlay, Ohio, and she, together with five children, survive him. The children are Mrs. Murray Hartnett, Frederick, Jr., Edward A., Murray and Oliver, all of whom, with the exception of Mrs. Hartnett, are living at home. Mr. Beach, although a very wealthy man, carried no life insurance. The time of the funeral has been set for Thursday afternoon at 2 o'clock from the house. Rev.
