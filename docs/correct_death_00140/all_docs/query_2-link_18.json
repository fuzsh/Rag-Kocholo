In 1878, Manuela Sosa and her husband, Michael McKenna, sold the property to Jesus Suarez de Carrillo, wife of businessman Leopoldo Carrillo, who completed this house in 1880. In 1881, the daughter of Territorial Governor John C. Fremont lived here. Carrillo family members occupied the house until 1968, when the city cleared the area for a community center.

It was originally called Alisal-The Sycamores. Following the Battle of Sunol Canyon, General John C. Frémont withdrew to this building, which became his headquarters for several days. — Map (db m3558)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn this spot, which marks the summit of the Kit Carson Pass stood what was known as the Kit Carson Tree on which the famous scout Kit Carson inscribed his name in 1844 when he guided the then Captain John C.

Above is a replica of the original inscription cut from the tree in 1888 and now is in Sutter’s Fort, Sacramento. — Map (db m12032)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the original site of the residence of pioneer merchant Alphone Weill, wife Henrietta, and three children, Irma, Blanche, and Lawrence. The house, built in 1882-3, and now standing in Pioneer Village, was constructed by Alexis Godey, former scout for General John C. Fremont. — Map (db m52572)\n\n\n\n\n\nNear this site stood the home of Alexis Godey, frontiersman and scout, who lived here from 1883 until his death on January 19, 1889. Born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1818, he acted as guide for John C. Frémont's expedition through the Kern area in 1843-44, and was honored for his services at the Battle of San Pasqual in 1846. Moving here in 1883, Godey died January 19, 1889. — Map (db m51676)\n\n\n\n\n\nNear this spot at the confluence of the north and south forks of the Kern River the Theodore Talbot Party of Captain John C. Fremont’s third expedition to the West camped for several weeks during December 1845 and January 1846. The river was named by Fremont in honor of Edward M. Kern, Topographer for the expedition. Kern County was established in 1866 and derived its name from that of the river.

Advised of the plot, Fremont was guided over the San Marcos Pass by Benjamin Foxen and his son William, and captured Santa Barbara without bloodshed. — Map (db m50546)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis house was built by Thomas Fallon in 1854. A handsome, charismatic figure, Fallon was one of the early San José’s most prominent citizens: he captained the volunteer company that seized San José from the Mexicans, served in the California Battalion of John C. Fremont and, in 1959, was elected mayor. His house, surrounded by an extensive pear orchard and magnificent gardens, was one of San José’s most impressive residences. The building was enlarged at the turn of the century and adapted for commercial use. — Map (db m30692)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1846 General John C. Fremont passed this site of the sycamore tree on his way to sign a treaty with General Andres Pico to secure California for future annexation to the United States. It served the Padres as a resting place; the community as a polling place and a temporary post office; and a location for religious services. — Map (db m51037)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen John C. Fremont came this way mapping emigrant roads in 1843, he found an important Indian village at Fishing Falls (Kanaka rapids) about 4 miles above here. He reported that native salmon spearers there were \"unusually gay...fond of laughter; and in their apparent good nature and merry character...entirely different from the Indians we had been accustomed to see.\" As Snake River's highest salmon cascades, Fishing Falls was included on many early western maps. — Map (db m31652)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1812, Joseph Miller found 100 lodges of Indians spearing thousands of salmon each afternoon at a cascade below here. Each summer they dried a year's supply. After 1842, they also traded salmon to Oregon Trail emigrants. John C. Fremont marveled at Salmon Falls 18-foot vertical drop, adjacent to \"a sheet of foaming water...divided and broken into cateracts\" by islands that \"give it much picturesque beauty, and make it one of those places that the traveler turns again and again to fix in his memory.\" — Map (db m31597)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legendary Paiute Leader; friend and guide to pioneers; breveted a \"Captain\" by John C.

Frémont viewed the field at Cross Keys and without proper reconnaissance assumed that Gen. Richard S. Ewell’s left flank was the strong side of the Confederate line. Frémont ordered his artillery to soften Ewell’s position. A duel ensued from 10 a.m. until noon, 20 Confederate guns against almost 50 Union cannons. Accurate Confederate fire caused a soldier from Ohio to remark that Stonewall Jackson himself must have paced off the range . . . — Map (db m25549)\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Charles Fremont was a naturalist, explorer, scientist and Captain with the U.S. Topographical Engineers on his third expedition to the West when he camped on this mountain. His assignment was to survey, map, chart trails and find the shortest route between the East and the West for the U.S. Government.

The Princeton Mine produced almost 4,500,000 of gold in 1860. Carlo Marre opened a general store. In 1862 Princeton was changed to Mount Bullion because a Princeton post office existed in Colusa . . . — Map (db m46407)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn January 27th, a cold winter day in 1844, Captain John C. Fremont and his guide Kit Carson, led as small band of half-starved men west past this point. They were in search of the fabled Buena Ventura River, which they believed would give them easy passage through the high range to the west and on to the fort of John Sutter. A short way northwest of here, they were forced to abandon their howitzer because of the deep snow, as their tired men could no longer pull the 1500 pound gun and caisson. . . . — Map (db m49887)\n\n\n\n\n\nCombined American forces under Captains Charles D. Burrass (or Burroughs) and Bluford K. Thompson clashed with Comandante Manuel de Jesús Castro's Californians in this vicinity on November 16, 1846. Casualties on each side consisted of several men killed and wounded. The Americans saved a large herd of horses for Lt. Col. John C.

Pike and his men, who traveled through this area in November and December 1806, were the first American explorers to view the Arkansas River Canyon now known as the Royal Gorge. A small party from the Maj. Stephen H. Long expedition visited the mouth of the canyon in 1820, as did members of Lt. John C. Fremont's expedition in 1845. In 1878 a right of way through Royal Gorge became the focal point of a bitter struggle between The Denver and Rio Grande and the Atchison, Topeka . . . — Map (db m34858)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lush willow bottoms of Rock Creek provided Native Americans with a natural campsite. During the early and mid-1800s, Rock Creek was an oasis for the trappers, explorers and Oregon-bound emigrants attempting to traverse the arid Snake River Plain. Astorian Robert Stuart camped in this vicinity August 28-29, 1812 during his epic eastward trek from Astoria to St. Louis in which he pioneered what would become the Oregon Trail. Captain John C.

Obsidian, bear grass, and slaves were transported over these trails to major trading locations along the Columbia River in exchange for dried salmon, smelt, sturgeon and decorative sea shells. The long established route was later used by Peter Skene Ogden's fur trapping expeditions in 1825 and 1826. Fur trader . . . — Map (db m36498)\n\n\n\n\n\nLate in April 1862, Maj. Gen. Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson marched his army out of the Shenandoah Valley through the Blue Ridge Mountains to deceive Union Maj. Gen. John C. Fremont into thinking he was headed for Richmond. On 3 May, Jackson bivouacked at nearby Mechum’s Station on the Virginia Central Railroad. The next day, part of the army entrained for the Valley while the rest followed on foot.
