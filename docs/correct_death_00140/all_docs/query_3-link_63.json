    "text": "rest mainly German-Americans, recruited in the states of Missouri, Ohio and Kentucky. Despite his broken English and quaint pronounciation, Zagonyi had the respect of his men and fellow officers. Albert Tracy, one of Fremont's staff who harbored a strong dislike of foreigners - stating that the Italians serving with him \"are of about as much use as fifth wheels on a coach\" - refers to Zagonyi as \"my good friend\" in his diary. Asa Mahan, in his A Critical History of the Late American Civil War, published in 1877, calls Zagonyi \"one of the most chivalrous heroes of the age.\" In October 1861, when Fremont's army approached Springfield, Missouri, the Guard, along with another cavalry formation, the Prairie Scouts, spearheaded the army. Encountering an enemy force which outnumbered them 5 to 1, Zagonyi ordered an attack and decisively routed the Confederates. This gallant charge, although a minor affair in the war, captured the imagination of the public and has been the subject of poems, articles and books and has been honored by plaques, markers and various memorials. The highly acclaimed and widely popular The Story of the Guard, by General Fremont's wife, the redoubtable Jessie Benton Fremont, recounts the actions of the Guard in vivid details with Zagonyi as the overt central hero. University Club historical marker no. 17 at Springfield, commemorating Zagonyi and the Guard, was erected on May 6, 1931. When Fremont assumed command of the Mountain Department in West Virginia in early 1862, Zagonyi became his chief of cavalry with the rank of colonel. Incensed at being subordinated to General John Pope whom he loathed, Fremont resigned in June of that year and was put on the inactive list along with Zagonyi, one of his most devoted followers. Neither of them saw any more service in the war. Zagonyi remained with the Fremonts and became a fixture in their household. He frequently accompanied Jessie on her trips and spent many hours giving riding lessons to the Fremonts' daughter Lily, transforming her into an expert horsewoman and becoming worthy, said a proud Jessie, to ride with Kit Carson. According to Mary Lee Spence's The Arizona Diary of Lily Fremont, Lily carried a life-long crush on Zagonyi. Zagonyi intended to go back to Hungary after the Compromise of 1867. Before he could do so he vanished and neither his American nor Hungarian friends ever heard from him again. His fate remains a mystery to this day. He most certainly did not, as some American writings claim, return to Hungary and operate a cigar shop in Budapest. This error seems to owe its origin to a note in the February 24, 1871 issue of the Tuscumbia Osage Valley Sentinel. The museum of the Greene County Historical Society in Springfield contains a multitude of Zagonyi memorabilia. He has also been honored with a medallion by the American Hungarian Federation in 1986. To commemorate his services in the War of Liberation, a stone column was erected in his native town of Szinérváralja (now Seini, Romania) on the 150th anniversary of that event. Erroneous and preposterous statements about Zagonyi and the Body Guard abound in the Civil War literature. For example, James Neal Primm in his Lion of the Valley refers to the Body Guard as a \"resplendent 300-man personal bodyguard of foreign volunteers.\" Fletcher Pratt's Ordeal by Fire states that \"his [Fremont's] bodyguard had lined their pockets with five million dollars' worth of contracts.\" Obviously, both authors did their best to ignore indisputable facts when penning these remarks. Incidentally, Pratt's work is subtitled An Informal History of the Civil War. An Inaccurate History of the Civil War would be far more appropriate. Anselm Albert - A native of Pest, Albert was an officer in the Hapsburg Imperial Army until 1845. He spent the next three years working abroad, in France and England. During the War of Liberation he participated in numerous battles and led one of the attacking columns at the siege of the fortress of Buda, which culminated in the expulsion of the Hapsburg forces occupying the Hungarian capital. Following the victory of the Hapsburg and Russian armies he sought asylum in Turkey and served briefly in the Ottoman army. Upon coming to America in 1852, he lived at various places, settling eventually in St. Louis, Missouri. In the spring of 1861, when Missouri was torn by factional strife as pro- and anti-Union elements were vying for control, Albert helped to organize Home Guard units to protect the citizens from marauding secessionists. He fought at Wilson's Creek under General Nathaniel Lyons and was wounded and captured. The Confederate bullet, which lodged in his hip, remained with him for the rest of his life, leaving him partly crippled. Following his exchange, he joined Fremont's staff as an adjutant to Asboth. Albert was among those who testified on Fremont's behalf before the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, a body established by Congress in December 1861 as a result of public outcry over Union defeats and Lincoln's apparently ineffectual war strategy. At Cross Keys in the Shenandoah Valley on June 6, 1862, he and Lieutenant-Colonel John Pilsen bore the primary responsibility for aligning the Federal troops. Referring to Albert and fellow Hungarian General Julius Stahel, Fremont wrote to President Lincoln: \"Both of them displayed distinguished courage & ability in the battle of Cross Keys and are every way worthy of your regard.\" Fremont asked President Lincoln to appoint Albert brigadier-general. However, the request was never acted upon. When Fremont resigned from command of the Mountain Department, both he and Albert were placed on the inactive list and neither saw any further service in the war. Incensed by the inactivity her husband and his loyal followers were forced to endure, an embittered Jessie Benton Fremont wrote to Indiana Congressman George Julian on January 16, 1864: \"Col Albert has been twelve years in America [...] He has steadily done good duty until shelved with the General. He speaks as good English as we do & is thorough in French & German - is a Hungarian & a trained officer.\" After the Civil War, Albert became the president of the Metropolitan Bank of St. Louis. He managed to accumulate a substantial wealth while business was good, but a series of financial reverses wiped out his gains. He was subsequently employed as the assistant editor of the German-language paper Amerika and then worked as District Assessor. He died on November 20, 1893. John Fiala - Educated at the prestigious Graz cadet school, Fiala was an officer in the Hapsburg Imperial Army until 1843 when he resigned his commission to embark on a civilian career as an engineer. At the outbreak of the War of Independence in 1848, he enrolled in the revolutionary forces, eventually attaining the rank of major. Like many others, he fled to the Ottoman Empire after the defeat. Following a brief Turkish service, he came to the United States and made his home in St. Louis, Missouri. While working for the railroad, he drew up the first great map of Missouri. At the outbreak of the Civil War he was employed in the Surveyor-General's office. He was one of the first to use his influence to organize the German-born residents of the city in pro-Union military units. In the Western Department, Fiala was Fremont's chief topographical engineer, and played a significant role in the construction of the fortifications around St. Louis and the establishment of the river flotilla of gunboats. He held the same position under Fremont in the Mountain Department. Like Albert and Zagonyi, he was placed on the inactive list following Fremont's resignation from command. During the remainder of the Civil War he promoted Fremont's political interests in St. Louis. Later he moved to California and died in San Francisco at the age of 89 in 1911. Fiala's memoirs, which extend up to his arrival in America in 1852, were published in Hungary in 1940. Fiala was the brother-in-law of four other distinguished Hungarians of the Civil War from St. Louis, the Rombauer brothers: Robert Julius, Roderick Emil, Raphael Guido and Roland, having married their sister Ida. Over the years, descendants of the Rombauer family have donated numerous papers of their ancestors, as well as those of Fiala, to the Missouri Historical Society. Fiala's sister, who remained in Hungary, was the wife of the well-known writer and historian Frigyes Pesthy. Fiala maintained a lively correspondence with Pesthy as well as with another respected author, Frigyes Riedl, a relative of the Rombauer family."
