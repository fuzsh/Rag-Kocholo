Irma was born 5 Feb 1909 in Paulding Co., Ohio. She died 6 Jan 1987. She was married sometime after 1932 to Windom Groves. It is believed that she was married to GROVES prior to 1940. After 1942 and before 1963 is as close as I can get for the\n\nmarriage to George Herding. In between, it was possible that she was married to at least two other men, so her name on the marriage certificate could have been Chisholm, Heycock, or Beelick (not sure of exact spelling).
