Her family album has some good photos of people that have been marked by name with some identified as \"neighbors\".\n\nHere are the names:\n\nMr. and Mrs. John Granby with Peder and Anna (neighbors in Harmony)\n\nElmer Jacobson, (Photo by Sleyster studio in Preston, MN)\n\nAndrew Lee (neighbor)\n\nMr. and Mrs. Sam Harstad (neighbors)\n\nHarstad children\n\nCarl Siem or Siern (Albert Lodahl studio, Harmony, MN)\n\nWalter Jacobson (Photo by Sleyster studio in Preston, MN)\n\nHenry Amundson\n\nElsie and Ole Horem or Horen (Photo by Sleyster studio in Preston, MN)\n\nHannah Albson\n\nIf these neighbors (probably all from Harmony) are your relatives, you can contact me at RBurchWv@aol.com\n\n\n\nANDERSON/BRINGELSON/EKLUND/ELLISON/HEDSTROM/HILLER/\n\nJACOBSON/JOHNSON/LINDBERG/LINDSTROM/LUND/OKESON/PLATT\n\nI just bought a photo of 24 children and a minister in Crystal, Minnesota at a garage sale for $2.00, I believe its a conformation picture and probably from around the late 1800's most of the children's names are on the back of the photo, the photo is in very good condition and with the names it's probably a Minnesota picture, the names are Harry ANDERSON, H.V. HEDSTROM, Selma LUND, Charles OLSON, Ferdinand OLSON, Lillian JACOBSON, Glennie OKESON, Anna L. HEDSTROM, ALFRED LINDSTROM, Arona LOUISE HEDSTROM, Gust JOHNSON, Leander EKLUND, Olga M. PLATT, Ella BRINGELSON, Anna ELLISON, Albert JOHNSON, Albert John LINDBERG, and the Minister A. E. HILLER some names not on picture. R. Clark\n\nANDERSON/JOHNSON/LARSON/SLETTEN\n\nMy name is Solvig Meijer and I live in Borlänge, Sweden. I got a photo from my grandfather with a lot of people on it who must be my relatives, in one way or another. I think the photo has been taken in a place namned Lake Lillian. I hope someone will recognize them because I would like to get in contact. The people are: Mrs Eric Anderson, Christina Anderson Larson, Ernest, Violet, Sally, Eris, Irving, Andrew and wife Louella, Marvin Sletten and wife Judy, Marie and husband Ed Johnson and daughter Farolyn, Effie. This photo was taken 1938.\n\nARTMANN/EVANS/FRAUENDIENST/POPELBA\n\nI have a Christmas card sent to my grandmother for Christmas 1964 (she had passed away by then) from E. E. Frauendienst of Glencoe, Minnesota, that includes quite a number of snapshots that I'd be happy to mail to a family member. Photos are: Steven Evans (toddler) Dec 1963 (says \"Rachel's youngster\" on back)\n\nGrandma Frauendienst, Patricia, Christmas 1963, Rachel & Michael Evans, Dec. 1963, Louise, Kevin & Kurt Artmann, Aunt Emma, Ern & Gil Artmann, Bruce, Mary & Richard, Christmas 1963 (says \"our three inbetweeners\" on the back), Grandpa Papelba, Cheryl, Grandma Frauendienst (Cheryl's confirmation 2nd Sunday, April 1964) - 2 copies of this photo Cheryl, April 1964, Aunt Emma Popelba, Teresa Christmas 1963 (Says \"Aunt Emma with our baby\" on the back). The Christmas card is signed: The Frauendiensts Ern, Elaine, Cheryl, Rick, Mary, Bruce, Patricia, Teresa.\n\nEmail: lauriekeller@waitrose.com with your name, connection and mailing address.\n\nASHLEY/STONE\n\nI have a copy/print of my grandmother, Helen Maud Stone and three other ladies, dressed in their hats and finery. I do not have the 3 others names but can only speculate they may have attended the Normal school at Winona, MN. from which my grandmother graduated in 1905. This picture appeals to me due to it showing the fashions of the day but someone may know these other ladies and want a copy or include it in some sort of display. She was the daughter of Azro Ashley and Sarah Francis Stone. Azro was active in civic and church affairs of Niccollet , holding various offices, including Mayor of St. Peter for one year (their home being a brownstone on Main Street across from the Nicolett County Courthouse). Later, they lived at 4o8 Washington Ave., St. Peter. Or are these 2 the same? Included in some history she has written are included these names, who possibly may be her friends in the photo---- Mable Hanscom who died of Typhoid Fever in her Sr. year, & Rosalie Burns. If you are interested, I can mail you a copy I've had made-- it is perhaps a 3x5 -- at any rate , not a large photo. Phyllis Johnson\n\nAUGUNSON/TORGRIMSON\n\nI have this old photo taken probably in the 1890's in Moorehead, Minnesota. The front of the photo has printing indicating the photo shop was Flaten in that community. The back of the photo has \" Ma's uncle & wife\" and on the front of the photo someone has placed x's over the supposed relatives. I think that all of these folks are related to me, why would they all be posed for a formal photograph if not related? Any comments would be appreciated. The home of these folks is somewhere in northwestern Mn, around Otter Tail county. I believe the surnames to be first, Augunsons & possibily Torgrimsons. If you recognise anyone in the photo please email Curt Paulson - Invalid email address 31 May 2019\n\nThank you, Curt Paulson\n\nBARRETTE\n\nI have in my possession a family photo taken at A. E. Woolett Photographers address was 110 Washington Avenue South, Minneapolis. The picture is of an elderly female family member to one of my Great Great Grandfathers family (Louis Barrette) who resided in the area during the 1800's, I know it's a long shot but somtimes glass negatives from old photographers are preserved at area historical societies and I was wondering if anyone had knowledge of this photographer. I am trying to identify the person in the picture. Any help would be appreciated. Lisa Merglewski\n\nBEAUCHAMP/BEMIS/GAGNON/GONION/HOUSE/KENNEY/LYMBURNER/\n\nNELSON/TURCOTTE/WILLITS\n\nThis picture of an unknown woman was taken by H. Boetcher, 225 E. 7th Street, St. Paul, Minnesota. It was probably taken during the 1890's or early 1900's. It was found, along with some other unknown pictures, among pictures having belonged to my great grandmother, Louise Anna GONION HOUSE. She lived in Willow City & Towner, North Dakota and also several different places in Montana. Known related family names are: HOUSE, GONION, GAGNON, WILLITS, LYMBURNER, KENNEY, YATES, NELSON, TURCOTTE, BEMIS, BEAUCHAMP. LaVonne Murray\n\nBERGSTROM/SIBLEY/STULL/THORPE\n\nPhotos found in a very old pillow in the attic of STULL house in Staples, MN. They could be STULL, THORPE, BERGSTROM or SIBLEY family members. Someone please help us identify these people! If you have ANY information at all contact me. Bernie\n\nBETLACH/PAULSON\n\nI have a large number of PAULSON family photos. They are the Paulson family from Yellow Medicine County, and St. Paul in Minnesota. They also lived in Big Stone, SD. Some of the first names are Bertha, Ella, John, Simon, Sam, Henry, Peter. Bertha was my grandfather's (Rudolph BETLACH) second wife. I believe Bertha and Rudolph met in the Granite Falls, Minnesota area. I need help identifying some of the photos. Bertha was married once before to a Carl Farnum and I think they may have lived in Aberdeen, SD. You can contact: Patty Betlach Russell.\n\nBLANCHARD\n\nItem Found - Rescued sepia-toned picture of a woman -- no date, but her hair is pulled back and she has a lace collar.

The Gotts seem to have lived in Maine, the Brookfields in San Diego. I have a ton of newspaper clippings, cards, letters and photographs that partain to this family. The last known person in this family died in 1969 at the age of 100 years. I would love to find a living relative for this stuff! Katharin Christman\n\nBROWN/TRUAX\n\nPicture of my grreat grandpa's cousin Esther Marie Brown and her husband Fred Melville Truax with there 3 children and friend, 9 Chester Lyle, and Marian Esther, and Lois Evelyn estimate photo from 1940's after a wedding maybe?? Back of photo says there from St.Paul. RickJBain@aol.com\n\nBRYANT/COOPER/CRARY/FAIRBANKS/LOUNSBERRY\n\nMy pictures of unknown persons, St. Paul, Minneapolis, Duluth or Red Wing, which relate to this family: Dr. George Holmes Crary (dentist), son of John Wesley Crary (1808-1902) and Mindwell Permelia Holmes (1810-1877) born 24 Sept 1838, Potsdam, St. Lawrence, NY married Catharine Phoebe Cooper, daughter of Ezra Cooper (1810 - 1885) and Maria Fanny Johnson (1818-1901) born 27 Jan 1840, Champlain, Clinton, NY.\n\nThe two young girls are in a tent that is marked COOPER.\n\nOr Possibly pictures of Bryant family or Fairbanks family or Lounsberry family. Probably taken at Minneapolis, St Paul, or Red Wing, or Duluth, MN Photo #3 Cooper Family Photo #5 Photo #6\n\nAnn Lounsberry Monnier\n\nBUETOW/KIRCHOFF\n\nI have a large group photo of which my great grandparents are in. There are no markings on the pictures and I am unable to identify others in the photo. It could be a family picture as it appears to me many resemble another. My ggrandparents names are Henry Kirchoff and Agnes Buetow. They resided in St. Paul since l900's but had relatives in Belle Plaine. Henry died in 1948 so the photo was obviously before then but perhaps not too much. If anyone can help identify others in the photo I would greatly appreciate it! Please contact Karen\n\nBURSLIE\n\nI am looking for photos of \"Burslie Eat Shop\" in Fertile, MN. My father, Arthur Burslie owned this restaurant in the late 1930's and early 40's. Any photos or newspaper clippings would be very much appreciated if found. Thank you! Mary Burslie Davis, Madras, Oregon 97741\n\nCASLER/HENRY/PORTER\n\nI need some guidance on a problem I am having difficulty solving. In my possession I have a photo of an infant I cannot identify. This photo was among others I inherited from my father who died in 1984. As far as any of our family knows none of the immediate lines lived in Minnesota but the photo is in a paper folder with the name of the photographer: L.C. Chamberlin, Northfield, Minn. Any suggestions would be appreciated. The surnames I am researching that possibly might be connected to this child: CASLER, HENRY, PORTER. The photo may date from late 1800s. Thank you for your time. Marilyn Casler Riesbol, Santa Maria, California\n\nCLARGO/COUSINS/HOOK\n\nI have inherited 3 photographs of I assume members of my family. I have no idea who they are. I know that members of the HOOK family who went to the border areas of Illinois and Wisconsin (GraysLake and Waukegan). These may be from the COUSINS or CLARGO family I don't know. Any way one was taken by D B NYE 811 Nicollet Ave, Minneapolis, another says MILLER 415, 417 & 419 Nicollet Ave, Minneapolis{branches Ashland,Wis & St Cloud, Minn. The 3rd says BISHOPS STUDIO, Minneapolis. Is there any one out there who could tell me when any of these company's were in business to help me date the photo's. Would it be worth getting copies made and sent to a local Minneapolis newspaper to see if they would print them in case any body could identify any of the subjects. I believe they date from between 1880 and 1920. Photo 1, Photo 2, Photo 3. Any help from your listers would be much appreciated. Best regards, Susan Stone, Bedfordshire, England\n\nCLARK\n\nI have found more information on my 2nd great uncle, who owned CVR Clark Photography Studio's. He was at 602 1/2 Central Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Then in Montrose, Minnesota, Delano, Minnesota, and then to Lake Benton, Minnesota. He was in Delano from July 1889 to December of 1889, then on to Lake Benton. If any one has Photos with CVR Clark Photography Studio's and could date them and where they were taken, I would really like to hear from you as I'm trying to find out where Charles Van Rensalaer Clark, ended up as I believe my 2nd great grand mother, his mother Catharine Janet Gillett Clark, ended up with him, as she lived to 1923, 15 years longer then my 2nd great grand father. Thanks. R. Clark\n\nCOOK/CARPENTER/FRASHER/MOREY/ODELL/SMITH/TRASHER\n\nI have four graduation photos from the class of 1897 of Minneapolis Central High School. These pictures were given to me by my grandmother's cousin, Kathleen Crockett Van Fleet and were classmates of one of her sisters, either Virginia Crockett or Claudia Crockett. The names on the backs of these pictures are: Clinton M. ODELL - Central High, 1897; C.B. Cook - CHS \"97\"; Vera L. Morey - CHS \"97\"; Emma, or possibly Ewina Carpenter - CHS 97; (Nannie) A Smith CHS 97. All of the above were taken at the O.F. Stafford & Co. Photographer, 520 Nicollet Ave. I also have another photo of Vera L. Morey taken in 1896 also taken at the Stafford studios.Another single photograph of a young girl. Written on the back is \"Bessie Trasher/Frasher, born in Minneapolis. Finally, a photograph of another young girl, who looks as though she may be Native American, but dressed in a dark dress with a light colored pinafore with flowers on it. On the back of the photo is written, Adelaid Smith (Addie), born in Minneapolis. This photograph was taken by Cottrel Studio, Photo & Artist, 11& 13 - 5 St. So., Minneapolis. Would be glad to share any of these photographs. Claudia Schuman\n\nDAVIS/DRUEY\n\nI have recently been scanning some old family pictures that belonged to my grandmother and/or her sister, and have run into a small snag identifying 5 of them. To set the stage, my grandmother was Grace Druey, daughter of John Druey who lived for a few years prior to 1878 in Chatfield. John had a brother Frank that lived in Chatfield most of his adult life and is buried there. Some of his children stayed in the area and maybe some stayed in the Winona area. I have recently found out that my grandfather, Melvin Perry Davis, had an uncle Edwin Sumner Davis that spent most of his adult life in Winona and is buried there. The five photos presented here probably came from my grandmother's sister Lilly, who occasionally visited the Rochester area. According to my mother, these pictures are from friends of Lilly's and had no connection to the family that she knew of. I seriously believe however, that these photos could be of some Druey or Davis boys and would love to make contact if any of the descendants of Frank Druey or Edwin Davis are still around the Chatfield or Winona areas. If anyone could help identify these lads I would be very grateful.\n\nPhoto 1, which is in a brown tri-fold folder, has no markings whatsoever, and would appear to be a \"wannabe\" World War I soldier.\n\nPhoto 2 is in a brown tri-fold folder and is a great picture of a young US Reserve Infantry Officer. As can be seen on his sleeve, \"Givens Photo San Francisco\". No other identification.\n\nPhoto 3 is a small wallet size photo of a young soldier that looks to be wearing the leather leggings of a cavalry man. The steep hill and the trolley track in the background suggest to me that this picture also could have been taken in San Francisco. The only other identification is \"X 22\" on the back, which leads me to believe he may have ordered 22 more copies to give out to his friends and relatives?\n\nPhoto 4 is of three apparent Military Police soldiers, one a Sergeant. Two at least, are sporting some kind of \"US\" patch on their lower left sleeve, but I can't make out what it says. On the back of this photo is \"This is a GUARANTEED Print by VAN VRANKEN'S STUDIO WINONA, MINN. Mail Orders Solicited\" I believe that these were the people that made this print, but where the photo was actually taken is subject to question. These three photos, 2, 3, and 4 could all have been taken in San Francisco, and I'm wondering, did Minnesota send some US Reserve units to assist in keeping order during the earthquake of 1906??? Last but not least,\n\nPhoto 5 is a fading picture of a soldier from the Signal Corps. I'm thinking this picture was from the same time frame, but from an entirely different locality. This is a postcard, and is stamped on the back, \"Viden 319 So. El Paso St.\". Was this from El Paso, TX? The campaign hat is somewhat reminiscent of the Spanish American War, or maybe this trooper was with Pershing chasing Poncho Villa.\n\nAnyway, thanks for taking the time to look these fine looking boys over, and if any look familiar, please contact Rod Stroud\n\nDUCKERING/SALKUM\n\n2 Photos of Kimball MN.....sent from their in 1907 and 08 to Washington State from one of my relatives to another! 2 photos Postcards of Kimball, MN......Stearns Co....The one simply on the front says Kimball, MN (snow picture) and the other one says \"Street Scene Kimball, Minn)......On the Snow picture on the back side Sent from : Lizzie Duckering with a note saying \"A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, yours sister Lizzie\".....postmark sent on Dec. 24th, 9pm 1907 from Kimball and sent to G.W.

It is in a folder that has a shield on the front with these words: Qualitas Servitum. Underneath is written B.C.Golling St. Paul, Minn. It is not a uniform of St. Thomas Military or Cretin High School. If I knew how to scan and send as an attachment I could do that but alas, I'm not too knowledgeable. Any suggestions as to what Military school this might be? Q1952@aol.com\n\nGRAHAM/WALDRON\n\nWALDRON - I have a photograph of Bert Waldron taken by Crowell (?) Artistic Photographer at 285 1/2 Broadway, Rochester, Minnesota and a younger photo of him from J.H. & L.J.B. Easton Photographers in Rochester. I also have a picture of Mary & William \"Willie\" Waldron from Easton's Photographic Gallery in Rochester.

Thank you, Cara Mumford\n\nGREEK\n\nI am Trying to find who and where this Wedding Photo of LUTHER GREEK was taken, and who are in this Wedding Party? The Best man is my father Raymond E. Raitor(Raiter) he was born 1912 and was married in 1937. This picture was found behind a other picture. My mother never has seen this photo. Could of been taken in Waverly Mn? or Deerwood Mn?

I purchased this at a second hand store and would like to find the Hanson family or relatives to return this to them...............Terrance Jestin, Nanaimo, B.C., Canada\n\nHARGENS/PERRINE/PRIEN\n\nOur family has a copy of the wedding photo of Antje Maria Caroline PRIEN. Unfortunately, this is only a copy of one of the originals, which the photographer supplied for the happy couple to give to friends and family. One of these originals most likely would have included the name of the photographer and his location. The information recorded on the back of or copy states, \"sister of great-grandmother HARGENS (PERRINE)\". While researching the parish registers of Heide, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany for the PRIEN family, we discovered the bride's name and that she was born on 11 Nov 1855. Her parents were Johann Nicolaus Heinrich PRIEN and his wife, Catharina Margaretha FICK. A marriage for Antje Maria Caroline PRIEN was not registered in Heide, but she may have married in Hamburg, where she worked as a maid during the late 1870's and 1880's. It is also possible that she came to America and was married here. Our ELLGEN relatives, who live in Murray and Pipestone counties may be able to help us find out the name of the groom and where they were married. We would love to solve this mystery. Thank you.

It says on the back \"Mrs. Jennings Children Beaudette Minnesota.

I have other photo's of many of the individuals in this picture, so if there's anyone out there that thinks it might be one of their people I can scan other individual photo's of these same people. The photo was taken in Crookston, Minnesota but may be a family of Euclid or surrounding area. It was taken at Shrin Seth (unsure because the writing is pretty fancy). This photo was among my g.grandmother Barbara Sasch Johnson's personal belongings. Brenda Gaetz\n\nI have a family picture of mine that I was hoping that other members of the KNICKERBACKER family in Minnesota maybe able to help. The picture had to have been taken before 1894, because GG-Grandpa Herman Knickerbacker died in May of 1894. They were from the St. Cloud, MN area since 1869.\n\nWritten on the back is...\n\nTop row from Left:\n\nOliver Knickerbacker, Harry W. Scherfenberg, Emma Caroline Knickerbacker Scherfenberg, Samuel ???, William Knickerbacker\n\nMiddle row:\n\nMary Mooney Knickerbacker, Jane M. Hutchins Knickerbacker, Herman Knickerbacker, Etta Knickerbacker\n\nFront row:\n\nfour unknown little girls\n\nThe little girl in the middle between Jane and Herman was noted as my Grandma Reva Knickerbacker Scherfenberg Stickles...but she was born in 1895 and Herman supposedly died in 1894. SOOO...am having troubles with the dates and names. I do not know of any Samuel Knickerbacker during this time period.\n\nAm hoping to find any living Knickerbackers that would be able to help me correctly identify everyone. Thanks. Email Michelle Stickles Whitaker at dutchandirish@yahoo.com or redwings66@juno.com.\n\nKOCK/McTURK/REMSEN/SOLL\n\nI have an envelope full of small portraits that seem to be all of the same family. On the back of only one of these is the location given, and that seems to be Pipestone, Minn. The pictures are only about an inch in diameter, and are of the McTurk, Soll, Remsen, and Kock families. The names are as follows, Farlam(F); Tom and Addie McTurk; Uncle Henry & Louise; mother Anna Soll & Meta Kock Remsen; Tom McTurk & Louise; Louise 14 yrs; Pete & Meta Kock; grandpa Clausen & Andrew Soll & Pete Kock; and Linda. I would like to find the proper home for these and would ask only a small reimbursement to cover my expenses. I enthusiastically endorse Gen Web and your attempt at returning such things as photos and memorabilia to their families. Thanks. Wayne Shannon\n\nKRAMER/RUSSET\n\nI have a few photos (at very high resolution, they'll take a while) from various years that others may want copies:\n\nHaEdSixtet.jpg is an army photo from the late 1940s, showing my grandfather and five other men. It's a high probablity that they are in the 47th Infantry Divsion at Fort Rucker, AL. There are no markings on the back and no names to go with the other men. Does anyone recognize these men?\n\nBenice And Girls.jpg is of my grandmother from the late 1920s or early 1930s. Again there are no names or markings on the back, so I can't name the girls in the center or right. If anyone knows who the two are, I would appreciate knowing.\n\nEdward Russet1938.jpg and RayKramer1938.jpg are photos my grandfather had. I don't know who these men are but I am guessing they lived in the east side of St. Paul in the 1938 or went to Cretin HS. Both are taken in 1938.\n\nLisa Radunz\n\nLANBIER\n\nI came across a photo in a Portland, Oregon antique shop that might interest someone. The best I can make out from the inscription on the back is that it is Mr. Les. W. Lanbier and family and that it was taken in Alexandria, Minn. Penny Stewart\n\nLANGDON/ROACH\n\nThe attached photograph is of Margaret and Roberta Langdon, taken in April 1919. Margaret was 6 years old and Roberta 1 1/2. This picture was one of many that had belonged to a relative in my husband's family, Thoris Roach, and given to me after her death. The Roach family lived at 3324 1st Ave South in Minneapolis from 1901 to the 1970's when Thoris Roach was moved to a nursing home. She was the daughter of Fred & Ida Roach, born in 1901 and lived at 3324 1st Ave S. her entire life. It appears that the Langdon family were neighbors and friends of the Roach family. I would be happy to give the original photograph to a relative of the Langdon family, and I may have other photos the Langdon children appreared in. Claudia Schuman - schuman16@att.net\n\nLARSON\n\nMy grandfather, Bror Hugo Larson, is seated on the far right and I understand he attended a baking school in Minnesota. He talked about living in Little Sweden. The only marking on the photo is in the lower right corner, \"Johnston & Co.\" and \"MPLS\" which I have thought may be an abbreviation for Minneapolis. The man seated on the far left has a badge sticking out of his pocket that says \"baker's union\" and two of the men in the front row are wearing what appear to be Eagle's Lodge badges, as they look similar to the one my grandfather had. I do not know the significance of the \"canes\" they are holding. I would estimate this photo was taken about 1906-1912. If anyone knows about this baking school, I could use help in identifying it. Sheila Larson\n\nLINDQUIST\n\nThis picture was send to my grandmother in Menahga, MN from a Mrs. Wm Lindquist, box 643..Dec. 17, 1916. There is no post mark or stamp. Is as follows: Dec. 17, 1916.. Dear Friend...Thanks for the postal received some time ago. why don't you drop a card once a year at least. Wishing you a Merry Xmas. Mrs. Wm Lindquist Box 603. Side 1 and side 2 Hope you can find an owner, Claudia Thiry\n\nMADISON/SELKE\n\nSELKE FAMILY. I have a whole box of family photos mainly of the Alfred Paul Selke family of Sauk Rapids. Alfred was my uncle by marriage to Bertha Madison of St. Paul. Anyone in the family who would like to have these photos please contact Gordon Madison\n\nI have several MANKE Family photos:\n\nFirst is the Gottlieb & Hanna MANKE family taken about 1898 in front of their homestead in Alta Vista Twp., Lincoln Co., MN. From left to right are: Wilhelm \"Bill\"Julius 1881-1927,\n\nGottlieb, born in the town of Osiek, Kreise Wirsitz, Prov. of Posen, 1855-1920,\n\nCelia \"Sally\" Hannah 1896-1928,\n\nHanna Marie, born HAASE in Pomerania, 1862-1932,\n\nFredrich \"Fred\" Herman 1890-1950,\n\nLouise Bertha 1880-1962. Married Emil Reynold Pochardt.\n\nGottlieb and Hanna are my paternal great grandparents. All their children were born in Alta Vista Twp. and all except Louise are buried in the Alta Vista Cemetery in Alta Vista Twp.\n\nThe second picture was taken before 1906.\n\nIt is of Gottlieb, Hanna Manke and Julius August Manke 1852-1906 and his 2nd wife Augusta Carolina Henrietta Liedke Voll 1851-1935. The picture indicates it was taken in Wheaton, MN. Why, I don't know. Maybe it was a funeral?\n\nI do have the Manke family histories.\n\nThanks, Karen Weiss\n\nMARKS/MARX\n\nThis is a pic of Charles Marks [Marx] taken in Clara City, MN. Owners of the studio, were E. Waters & A. Levy. Rumor in the Marks family for years was that Charles was the illegitmate son of Karl Marx, the communist, but from all the searching I have done this is untrue. Charles\n\nMILLER\n\nCROOKSTON- If anyone has any photos of the Crookston Tanning Company or the Miller Tanning Company please let me know. Also any pictures, newspaper accounts of August Miller, Herman U. Miller or Ronald K. Miller all of Crookston, MN.

Large 2 ft by 18 inches (aprox) framed original wedding certificate WITH PHOTOS for:\n\nAugust MILLER and Mary SWENSEN married May 7, 1890 in Minneapolis, MN, witnesses John and Margaret Calder, Pastor SW Boft.\n\nThis was the kind of beautiful piece in fabulous shape that should be reunited with it's family members! I did not buy it (It cost $80) but I did write down who had it for sale. The dealer info was: Mark Christenson (651) 455-0541\n\nIf anyone knows descendants of this family the two photos (one of bride and one of groom) with the certificate would be priceless to them.\n\nPlease feel free to pass this along to whatever list you feel can help. ~Kathy\n\nNISSEN\n\nI rescued an old photo album from a thrift store, trying to find family of Nissens. Names include Anna Myatt Nissen, Phylis Nissen, Mildred Nissen, Joann, David. One picture is at a Lake Delavon, Wis. Most pictures are of the 1920's. Would love to find next of kin.

Some are identified and some are unknown....any help appreciated. I will be posting more in the near future Karen Sander Helfert\n\nPECK\n\nThis house on Fremont Blvd. in Minneapolis, belonged to my husband's great grandparents, Merit Butler Peck and Anna Peck.\n\nThe man in the photo is Merit and his photo was taken on Sept 22, 1890 in MN. I scanned the front and back of the three photos.\n\nI hope they will be of value to researchers.\n\nMerit lived from 1841 to 1896. He died in Minneapolis ~\n\nBest Regards, Bonnie Arnold\n\n\n\nPICKETT/SCOTT\n\nI am searching for any old photos of the Scott and Pickett family from the 1800' and on. They were from Pipestone and Edgerton MN. If you have any information on these families or photos please e-mail me (BeJae)\n\nREYNARD\n\nHave old photos (c.1900) of Mr. and Mrs. Peter Grant Reynard of Merriam Park, near Minneapolis. Any relatives or archival library may contact me. Virginia\n\nRICE/WERNER\n\nThis photo was taken around 1925. I know the identity of three of the individuals: Center, Nelson Rice, Civil War veteran; right of him, Jacob Arthur Werner, went on to be mayor of St. Louis Park in the 1940s and 1950s; left rear, Willard Werner, Jacob's son and my grandfather. Nelson was Willard's grandfather, and Jacob's father-in-law. I'd like to know more about the other people in the photo, as well as a better date for it. Willard was born in 1910, and looks to be about 15 in the picture, hence the extimate of 1925. The small mark in the lower left corner is a photographer in Minneapolis. Michael Werner\n\nRUTLEDGE\n\nI have several pictures and some hand written family history, on a Rutledge Family as he was my stepfather, We knew very little about him. He was born in MN, around 1902 or 03. I would be more than happy to send this to anyone, that might like to have it.

Lisa Burt\n\nSTULL\n\n(and more)\n\nCan anyone help identify these pictures found in the attic of the Stull home in Staples,Mn. after the death of Marion Stull in Feb. 1942. Marion was the son of John Stull and Lavinia Sibley. His brothers and sisters were Mary Alice Stull (Mrs. Wilbert Emery), Emma Florence (Mrs. Edward Loeffler), Rebecca Stull (Mrs. Frederick Thorp), Julia Stull (Mrs. Cockle), Walter Stull, Lottie Stull, (Mrs. Peck), Adeline Stull (Mrs. Milton Berryman),Nellie Stull, and Edna Stull (Mrs. Schwert). Any help appreciated! Please email if you can help. Thank You. Bernie Schwindt\n\nSTUNTEBECK\n\nThis is a photo of the Stuntebeck family from Freeport Minn. My great grandmother was the woman named Josephine. Does anyone have any information about her brothers and sisters as to where they lived and died or any of their decendents? Any information would be appreciated. Thank-you, Joy F.\n\nSWENSON\n\nWe have an old old photo album with very small pictures in it. Some of them are tintypes. We believe the album belonged to Torger Swenson (sometimes referred to as Targei Svensson) who came from Aseral, Vest Agder County, Norway, Tjaldal Farm to Crow Lake Township, Stearns County, MN. He was a member of the Crow River Lutheran Church in Kandiyohi County, MN. He was brother to my husband's great grandfather, Anon Swenson of Pope County, Lake Johanna Township, MN. Only one of Torger's children married and she didn't have any children so the album was passed on to our family and we fell heir to it several years ago. There are over 50 pictures in it and only 1 of them is identified. Some of the pictures have photographer's names on them. Two of the pictures were taken in Willmar, MN, by John Ericks, photographer. I went to Willmar's Historical Society earlier this week and the curator there said that he had to have been a photographer there before 1900 because they have researched all the photographers in Willmar back to around 1900 and John Ericks is not one of them. Torger's wife was Mari (Mary) Tollefsdatter, born 1849 in Bygland, Setersdal, Norway and she died in 1931 in Stearns County, MN. Her parents were Torstein Tollefson and Matilda or Birgit Torsteinsdatter. It is possible that some of the pictures could be of her family, but we definitely know that at least 2 of the pictures in the album are of brother's of Torger who stayed in Norway. We would be glad to send photocopies of all of the unidentified pictures to anyone who would possibly have any knowledge about this family or who would be interested in this project. Many of the pictures are from shortly after the Civil War, we think, and some of them are from CT, NY, IL. Many have been taken in Minneapolis. One has been taken in Crookston. Torger's children were: Alice (Mary Alice) Swenson, Betsy Swenson, Sven Swenson, Anne Swenson, Jorgine Swenson and Thea Swenson who married Frank Johnson and was a furrier in Duluth, MN. We have only identified 3 of the pictures and so we have a long ways to go! email me at: scm3@prodigy.net\n\nTHOMPSON\n\nPhoto of the Hill City baseball team my grandfather played on. My grandfather, Clarence Arthur Thompson, is the 3rd person from the right. Joan (Thompson) Perry\n\nVIEBROCK\n\nA picture of my great-grandaunt Adelheid Viebrock recently came into my possession. She was born Oct. 22, 1837 in Plönjeshausen, Hanover, Germany. (I have attached the picture.)\n\nI have been told that the picture of her and her husband, taken by A.R.Hawkinson of Mazeppa, MN at an unknown date. Unfortunately no one recalls Adelheid's married name, i.e. her husband's surname. Although the picture quality is not what I had hoped for, perhaps someone out there has a clue as to their name or any other hints as to what I could do next to discover my relative's 'identity'. What was her married name? Where did she and her husband live, and where did they die? Thank you for any help you may be able to provide. Ingo Viebrock - Invalid email address 31 May 2019\n\nWARNER\n\nI am searching for my \"Warner\" family branch and the search has taken me to Minnesota. I have attached two antique photographs that were apparently taken in the \"G. Collier Studio 2005 S. Superior Street West, Duluth, Minnesota.\" The name \"G Collier\" was printed on the photocard in gold ink. It is written in script that somewhat resembles this \"G. Collier.\" The thin sides of the photo are also covered with gold ink or other type of shiny material. The photo itself seems to have been glued to the card. I do not have a specific name for the people depicted in the photos, but by deduction they are probably Warner's. The children in the one photo and the young man in the other, bear a striking resemblance to the Warner Photos posted by Cheryl L. Parsons of Clay New York. Kevin O'Brien\n\nWESTMARK\n\n(and more)\n\nPhotos: Late 1800-Early 1900's unidentified old cardboards from MINNEAPOLIS, MN I gained access to about 35 professional photos taken in Minneapolis MN from various studios. They were given by \"Helen\" to a local bank for a Centennial Celebration. The daughter found these in a bundle in her moms attic. Some are from the WESTMARK family.\n\nSome maybe from other families. Do contact me kanootson@yahoo.com if you know who any of these are! Thanks!\n\n1.

It is likely members of the Jesse or John J. Youngs family. Appears to be taken very early and would date from the mid to late 1800's and looks like a 4 generation picture. It was sent to me by a Youngs family member, with no identifying marks on it.\n\nJesse Youngs b: 1790 in Conn. and d: 1864 in Wabasha co., Mn. He was the father to the following children; John J, Joseph, Phidella, Anna, Robert, Enoch, and Mathilda Youngs.\n\nJohn J. Youngs was married to Almeda E. Lovell and both died in Wabasha county Mn.\n\nThey were the parents of the following children; Benjamin Franklin Youngs, Henrietta Amanda Youngs, Phoebe A Youngs, George Riley Youngs, Jesse E. Youngs, and Joseph Henry Youngs.\n\nThese children married as follows and lived in Wabasha county, Mn. area some until the early 1900's.\n\nBenjamin Franklin to Annis Bump; Henrietta to Henry \"Howdy\" Sibley; Phoebe to James Harrison; George Riley to Naomi Ann Sibley ( Henry \"Howdy\" and Naomi were brother & sister); Jesse to Bernice Owens; and Joseph Henry to Elizabeth Hook. I believe the picture is of Jesse Youngs (the elder), John J. (center), one of his sons and grandsons. Any help in identifying the picture is greatly appreciated.\n\nCan anyone help identify this photo? It came from a descendant of George Riley YOUNGS and Naomi Ann SIBLEY. George and Naomi were married in 1874 in Wisconsin, George was the son of John J.Youngs and Almeda E. Lovell. Naomi was the daughter of Phebe Ann Covey and Joseph Charles Sibley, Sr. The John J. Youngs family resided in Mazeppa, Mn. and this is likely where the picture was taken.\n\nThis photo is either Naomi Ann Sibley Youngs, or her mother; Phebe Ann Covey Sibley Chapman Browning. Phebe was married (1) Joseph Charles Sibley abt. 1812 in New York state, Joseph died June 1859.(2)Royal Jessie Chapman July 1859, in Mazeppa, Mn., they were likely divorced, although no records to document such an event.(3) Alexander H. Browning July 2, 1861, Pepin county, Wi. Phebe is buried Rock Falls Cemetery, Rock Falls, Dunn county, Wisconsin in an unmarked grave between her daughter; Agnes R. Porter and Alex Browning. She died abt. Feb. 1901. Is there anyone related to this family who may have seen this picture and can make a positive identification??? I have circulated to all known family members to no avail.\n\nPlease email if you can help identify anyone in these photos! Thank you. Bernie Schwindt"
