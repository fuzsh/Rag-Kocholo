    "text": "Notes: “During the war of the Rebellion, which broke out when he was eighteen years of age, he joined the Union army, and served with honor and distinction, participating in several of the most important battles. Coming to Utah at the close of the war, he was soon engaged as an instructor in the University, when that institution was conducted in the Council House, Salt Lake City” [LDSBE, 1:204]. He enlisted in the Union army on September 6, 1862, and served until June 28, 1865. His unit fought in numerous battles across Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama, including Chickamauga, Chattanooga, and Atlanta. From the date of his enlistment until August 15, 1863, his unit pursued and eventually defeated the Confederate General John Hunt Morgan (of Morgan’s Raiders fame), who was John Hamilton Morgan’s fourth cousin. Several of his Civil War letters have survived. On December 21, 1863, for example, he wrote: “A mother’s love is not purchased by either gold or diamonds; in camp, on the march, the bloody field of strife or the chill bivouac—the soldier’s veneration for his mother remains the same. Falling on the blood drenched battlefield or stricken down by sickness, his last words are invariably: My mother—My Country! Often I have seen an unbidden tear spring to the eye of the rough soldier who had braved death in a thousand different shapes; whose cheek was unblanched and nerve steady amid the roar of battle; whose voice was as clear and ringing on a charge as the bravest of the brave—I have seen such men moved to tears on receiving a simple short letter from a mother.” He was recognized for bravery during the battle for Selma, Alabama, on April 2, 1865. An account of the battle written by Captain Owen Wiley (the Regiment’s commanding officer) reported: “It is unnecessary to make particular mention of either officers or men. All did their duty, so deserve the highest praise. Sergt. John Morgan, Company I is deserving of the highest credit for his credit for his gallantry in action in being the first to plant a flag upon the rebel works and for being in the extreme advance until all the rebel forts were captured, planting our colors upon each of them successively.” At the end of the war, he was offered an officer’s commission if he would reenlist, but he declined the offer. He joined the LDS Church after coming to Utah with a herd of cattle. In 1867, he founded the Morgan Commercial and Normal College—Utah’s “first successfully conducted school in Utah for higher education during the period from 1867 to 1875.” Students at Morgan College included Heber J. Grant, Brigham H. Roberts, Ira N. Hinckley, Orson F. Whitney, Ruth May Fox, and J. Golden Kimball. He served as president of the Southern States Mission. Beginning in 1878–79, many of his Southern States converts settled in Manassa, Conejos County, Colorado (where Morgan Street was named in his honor). He was ordained by Wilford Woodruff on October 5, 1884, to serve as one of the First Seven Presidents of the Seventy. Arthur M. Richardson, The Life and Ministry of John Morgan (n.p.: Nicholas G.
