Frémont led five expeditions to explore the West between 1842 and 1853.\n\nRobert Stockton promoted Frémont to the military commandant and civil governor of the Territory of California in 1847, and that same year Frémont purchased a large track of land in California. As a result of the California Gold Rush, he became very wealthy because his land holdings.\n\nIn 1850, John C. Frémont was one of the first two senators from California and, in 1856, he became the first presidential candidate for the anti-slavery Republican Party losing to Democratic candidate, James Buchanan. During the Civil War, President Lincoln made Frémont a Major General in the Union Army and Commander of the Western Federal Army.
