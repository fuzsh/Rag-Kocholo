We recently heard from some from folks across the pond who made a documentary about the Hardy Brothers company and other classic British fishing tackle producers. It’s called The Lost World of Mr. Hardy. We checked it out and we think you should too.

Whether or not you’ve got a study full of Perfects and Bougles, if you’re at all interested in classic tackle or the history of our sport, you’re going to want to have a look.

This is not an action-packed destination angling movie. It’s a soulful, insightful look at the traditional approach taken by Hardy in the early days, and the changes that the company (and the industry) has made over the years.

The vintage photos and video footage alone are worth the price of admission. The trailer gives a little taste.

NOTE: If you’re viewing this in a newsletter or a reader, click here to see the trailer on Vimeo.

They’ve got some more video clips on their Vimeo page as well.

Interested? You can pick yourself up a copy on their web site.
