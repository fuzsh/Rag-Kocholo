        "text": "Comedy western. - Laurel and Hardy: Way Out West: Vol.3 review by Steve\n\nIt's not clear why anyone would hazard to trust Stan and Ollie with delivering a valuable deed to one of the world's most profitable goldmines, and true to form they mistakenly leave it in the hands of crooked saloon keeper James Finlayson and his mercenary moll rather than the intended deserving sweetheart (Mary played by Rosina Lawrence) kept hard at work in the scullery. So the pair are soon breaking into the premises, trying to get it back.\n\nHaving Stan and Ollie striving to protect the rights of the bullied Mary against the finagling Finlayson makes the audience really root for them, an anxious prospect given how flawed are their methods.\n\nThe standout here is Stan and Ollie trying to force entry into the upper room of the saloon using a pulley, with a donkey at one end and Mr. Hardy at the other. Eventually, the donkey ends up on the balcony. There's some great comedy too arising from Stan trying to get a locket over Ollie's head without opening the clasp.\n\nAround now, Laurel and Hardy are at the peak of their craft, every visual gag and character reveal perfectly honed. One scene works its way into the next without friction. There is a little singing and dancing in this film but this just adds a little warmth rather than unwelcome diversion. Probably worth indicating here just how much input Stan had in many areas of film making, usually without credit. Here he is listed as producer, though the duo are still with Hal Roach."
