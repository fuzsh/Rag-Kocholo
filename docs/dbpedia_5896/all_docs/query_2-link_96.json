        "text": "Everyone needs a friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, and perhaps that is why the character's legacy — and universe — has endured for so long on the silver screen.\n\nSony has kept a tight hold of the rights to the Marvel franchise since bringing the character to audiences with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy starring Tobey Maguire, though they chose to make a landmark deal with Marvel in 2015 that allowed Tom Holland to don the webslinger's suit for the MCU.\n\nOver the years, Sony has been expanding the Spider-Man universe little by little, and things kicked into high gear after the box office success of Venom. The film opened the door for Sony's own cinematic universe, one they had long sought after, which focuses on various iconic villains from the Spidey comics.\n\nThis means that there are plenty of films in the Spider-Man universe for fans to look forward to.\n\nRead more: The best Easter eggs and cameos in Across the Spider-Verse\n\nWith the original live-action Spider-Man movies set to return to UK cinemas in summer 2024, here is everything you need to know about what future films are in the pipeline...\n\nVenom: The Last Dance | 25 October 2024\n\nTom Hardy's Venom franchise will be getting a third entry, titled Venom: The Last Dance, in which he will return as Eddie Brock. It will be the first Spider-Man spin-off since Madame Web slumped at the box office.\n\nPlot details are still under wraps but the film will likely see the character deal with the aftermath of being sent to the world of Tom Holland's Spider-Man in Spider-Man: No Way Home.\n\nThe blockbuster will co-star Juno Temple, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Clark Backo, with newcomer Kelly Marcel directing.\n\nKraven the Hunter | 13 December 2024\n\nAaron Taylor-Johnson makes his Spider-Man debut as Kraven the Hunter, another iconic adversary from the webslinger's gallery of villains.\n\nThe film, which also stars Russell Crowe and tells Kraven's origin story, will be released on 13 December 2024, having been delayed from January 2023.\n\nA first-look trailer was revealed in June 2023 which showed Taylor-Johnson in character as he became accustomed to his super-powers that he received after a vicious lion attack.\n\nSpider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse | TBC\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse delighted audiences worldwide but the third film in the franchise, titled Beyond the Spider-Verse, is currently stuck in a bit of web-tangle.\n\nThe film will follow on from the events of the second animated film, which saw Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) learn that he is an anomaly in his universe and was never meant to be Spider-Man.\n\nRejecting the idea that all Spider-people have to follow the same path as Miguel O'Hara (Oscar Isaac) tells him, he escapes and ends up in the universe where he Miles Morales is the Prowler.\n\nSpider-Man 4 | TBC\n\nSpider-Man 4 is still in the works at Sony, with Tom Holland expected to return to the franchise as Peter Parker after the dramatic events of Spider-Man: No Way Home.\n\nIn an interview with Deadline in April 2024, the British star said \"everyone wants it to happen\" and that Marvel has \"the best in the business\" working on the film.\n\n\"The simple answer is that I'll always want to do Spider-Man films,\" he said. \"I owe my life and career to Spider-Man. So the simple answer is yes. I'll always want to do more.\"\n\nSpider-Man Noir (TV) | Prime Video\n\nNicolas Cage is set to reprise his role as Spider-Man Noir for an upcoming live-action TV series for MGM+ and Amazon's Prime Video.\n\nCage previously voiced the character in 2018's animated film Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, and the show will mark the legendary actor's first ever regular television role. \"No one else could bring such pathos, pain, and heart to this singular character,” said Katherine Pope, president of Sony Pictures Television Studios, said about Cage when Amazon announced the project in May 2024.\n\nNoir will tell the story “of an aging and down on his luck private investigator (Cage) in 1930s New York, who is forced to grapple with his past life as the city’s one and only superhero.” It will be produced by the Spider-Verse team of Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and Amy Pascal. The showrunners will be Oren Uziel (22 Jump Street, Mortal Kombat) and Steve Lightfoot (Hannibal, The Punisher).\n\nIn July 2024, a flurry of casting news made its way online with Brendan Gleeson joining New Girl actor Lamorne Morris in boarding the project. While Gleeson's role remains a mystery, it was revealed that Morris will play a gritty journalist Robbie Robertson.\n\n“Driven, hard-working, and won’t take no for an answer. A dedicated journalist trying to make it with the odds stacked against him as a black professional in 1930s New York,\" says the official character synopsis. \"He takes on riskier stories that no one else would touch in order to catch attention and a paycheck. He is willing to do whatever is necessary for his career.”\n\nSilk: Spider Society (TV) | TBC\n\nIn 2022 it was confirmed that Amazon would be moving forward on multiple live-action shows based on Sony's world of Marvel characters. The first series coming to Prime Video is said to be Silk: Spider Society, based on the character Cindy Moon \"a Korean-American woman bitten by the same spider that bit Peter Parker, as she escapes imprisonment and searches for her missing family on her way to becoming the superhero known as Silk.”\n\nThe series, also produced by Lord, Miller, and Pascal, is being developed by Angela Kang, best known as a showrunner on AMC's zombie series. The Walking Dead.\n\nEl Muerto | On hold\n\nEl Muerto was set to star musician Bad Bunny in the title role with Jonás Cuarón directing it. The Spider-Man character is a wrestler with super-human strength and a notable villain in the comics.\n\nHowever, because of the rapper's busy touring schedule and the 2023 Hollywood strike, Sony decided to delay the release of El Muerto. It's still without an ETA, and in May 2024, Bad Bunny confirmed that he had left the project.\n\nSony's unconfirmed Spider-Man films\n\nSony has a number of Spidey-related projects currently in development. These include villain-movie The Sinister Six, a Nightwatch adventure, a Jackpot adaptation, a Hypno-Hustler feature that has been linked to Donald Glover and untitled films attached to both Olivia Wilde and Roberto Orci.\n\nThere is also talk of a feature based around Jake Gyllenhaal's Mysterio, a character first introduced in Spider-Man: Far From Home."
