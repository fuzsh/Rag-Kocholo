        "text": "The first of Lugosi's famed \"Monogram Nine\" pictures, and one of the more interesting films he'd ever make in his career. Which isn't too say that it's GOOD you understand; it sure is fascinating, though, mostly for all the wrong reasons but then, it does boast director Joseph H. Lewis, who went on to make Gun Crazy and The Big Combo, and not for nothin', but when you've got The Invisible Ghost on your resume, having Gun Crazy on there too sure doesn't hurt your place in cinema history.\n\nBela is disturbed by the disappearance years ago of his wife, who ran off with some other guy who no doubt wasn't Hungarian. When I say \"disturbed\", I don't mean \"annoyed\" or \"vexed\", I mean, oh, \"unhinged\" and \"demented\". He sets a place for her at the table, has his faithful servant Clarence Muse serve her soup, compliments her on how particularly beautiful she looks on any given occasion, and is quite convinced that some day she'll return. Boy, is HE right, because she's actually living under the garage in a secret room; she'd been in an auto accident that gave her brain damage and she's cared for and fed by gardener Ernie Adams, and why he does that we'll never know, but \"abject stupidity\" is part of the norm with Monogram scripts, so please hush. The plot of the film, such as it is, is that Mrs. Lugosi (played by, of all people, Betty Compson, and if you just said to yourself, \"Surely not the Betty Compson from Docks of New York and the 1930 version of The Spoilers? Not the Betty Compson who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress? SHE didn't end up on Poverty Row, did she? Please, tell me this is some OTHER Betty Compson! PLEASE TELL ME THAT!\" To which I can only say, \"Life ain't easy, pal, life ain't easy.\" To say that she's the best actor in this film is like getting a blow job in the bathroom of a McDonald's and then announcing you finally had something there you liked.\n\nWell, on THAT possibly inappropriate note, we return to our film and find Betty wandering around the grounds of Manor Lugosi, where her husband occasionally finds her peering in the window, which sets him off into a homicidal rage and he strangles one of the servants. Apparently, this has been going on for YEARS and (a) the police can't figure out who is behind this, and (b) they don't have any trouble whatsoever hiring new servants. Bela also has a daughter, Loretta Young's lookalike sister but not the one that's Sally Blane, no, this lookalike sister is Polly Ann Young, and she's engaged to a nice young man who used to sleep with the household's new maid, and so when she's murdered he's accused, despite the fact that nearly a hundred other servants have been strangled in the same house, and he's executed but his twin brother shows up to woo Polly Ann and figure out who REALLY killed the girl and I TOLD you Monogram pictures were stupid and by the way, both brothers are played by John McGuire and neither of them can act. Neither can Polly Ann or maid Terry Walker or police detective George Pembroke, who apparently was instructed to \"dress like a police detective\" and so wears a trench coat and fedora and chomps on an unlit cigar in every scene he's in, no matter where or what he's doing. Seriously, this is one of the worst-acted films I've ever seen. Clearly, director Lewis was concentrating on other things, because it's terrific to look at, with a lot of unusual shots and camera angles and long takes and weird POVs and stuff like that, way above the Monogram Pictures norm.\n\nAnd then there's that Lugosi fellow.\n\nSee, here's the thing... When that ol' debbil takes him over, he acts like a somnambulist, staggering around the house in a daze, arms outstretched, fingers flexing for a warm throat to crush. Lewis lights him from below, so his face is filled with the shadows of eerie madness. In 1941, in the gloom of a darkened theatre, I'm certain it was most horrifying, and worthy of the good name of Bela Lugosi, Master of Screen Terror. Seriously, it's scary. Um, well, that is to say in 1941 it was. Now? If you don't laugh out loud and think it's one of the stupidest things you've ever seen, it's because you fell asleep during the film, always a possibility with these things. It's a rip-snorter. And only Lugosi can say \"Apple Pie? My! That WILL be a treat!\" and make it sound terrifying. But fret not, there's a lot of million-dollar stupid Monogram dialog in the film for EVERYONE to say.\n\nMillion-dollar stupid Monogram dialog:\n\nCop in trench coat and fedora, chomping on unlit cigar: \"All we want to know is if the fellow's crazy.\"\n\nAged, wise psychiatrist guy: \"That's very easy to determine.\"\n\nRotten actor twin brother man: \"Is it possible, doctor, for a man to be normal, say, for two or three months at a time and then go completely insane for an hour or two?\"\n\nPsychiatrist: \"Yes. Quite common!\"\n\nBela: \"This should be most interesting.\"\n\nYeah, it SHOULD be, huh?\n\nActually, as mentioned, the film IS interesting; director Lewis takes crap and makes a tasty omelet out of it (so to speak). There's also something to be said for letting Bela be Bela; none of this \"bill him prominently but have him play the red-herring butler or groundskeeper who's only in a few scenes\" when Lugosi was at Monogram or PRC, peoples. How many of YOU have got to spend the better part of an hour wandering through a big, dark house with a flashlight under your chin? I mean, in a movie, not in real life.\n\nI always wanted to give a shout out to Clarence Muse, who plays the Negro manservant with dignity and poise and is also one of the best things in the picture. Nice to see a character like this as something other than comic relief.\n\nThe Invisible Ghost is in the public domain, meaning it's on a thousand or so DVDs, but the Roan Group also offers it and they have a nice print of it, not great but nice enough until the Criterion folks finally do something with this film.\n\nThe first of Lugosi's famed \"Monogram Nine\" pictures, and one of the more interesting films he'd ever make in his career.

Factory BD $39.95) One of those âfilm classicsâ Iâve never seen; Carl Reiner directed, 1979, Steve Martinâs big-screen breakout role.

The originals were so popular that they were printed to death, and the studioâs financial woes in the â40s and â50s ensured that no effort was made to take care of original materials â or in some cases first and second generation copies. A few years ago, the UCLA Film & Television Archive and the Film Foundation embarked on a massive search-and-rescue mission to restore the existing films from the best surviving elements, partially funded by L&H fans themselves. The result wowed everyone lucky enough to see the restorations in their limited theatre engagements, and we were promised a collection on Blu-ray and DVD, and here it is, 17 short subjects and 2 feature films with more than 8 hours of bonus material. There is good news and bad news about the set, so letâs launch our overview, shall we?\n\nThe Good\n\nNo, make thatâ¦\n\nThe Great\n\nImagine everything you could possibly want as bonus material on a L&H set; thatâs all here, plus more, much of it compiled and shared by Randy Skredvedt, probably the worldâs leading expert on Stan Laurel and Oliver âBabeâ Hardy and author of must-have books on the subject. Among the fascinating rarities are interviews Randy did with L&H co-workers like Anita Garvin, Billy Bletcher, and Hal Roach himself; vintage extra film footage; scripts and notes; commentary on each of the films by Richard Bann or Randy Skredtvedt; hundreds and hundreds of vintage stills and other promotional material; and three shorts of great interest, led by a restoration (for the first time ever) of the Boysâ 1927 classic Battle of the Century (the one with the colossal pie fight), including the âlost reelâ discovered just a few years ago; the Technicolor WWII propaganda short Tree in a Test Tube; and the oddball Thatâs That, an outtake/blooper reel compiled in the late 1930s for Stanâs birthday.\n\nIf the set contained just the bonus material, I would find it worth the money and recommend it without reservation.\n\nThe Films\n\nThe set contains L&Hâs two most popular features Way Out West (the one with the famous dance) and Sons of the Desert, plus a variety of fair to great short subjects, including The Music Box (the one with the piano and the impossibly high flight of stairs), County Hospital, Busy Bodies, Towed in a Hole, and Hog Wild, amongst many others. The sound has been cleaned up nicely on all of them; as part of this review, we compared the films with earlier DVD and Blu-ray releases, domestic and foreign, and the improved soundtracks struck us as the most impressive part of the upgrade.\n\nThe films have been meticulously restored, with flutter, scratches, and missing frames corrected beautifully. Some of the early talkies were reissued later with new musical soundtracks; in those cases, both soundtracks are included. The commentaries (some of which go on long after the film itself has ended) are wonderful. Which brings us toâ¦\n\nThe Bad\n\nSomebody deserves a swift kick in the arse for a terrible, miserable, horrible decision to take the restorations they were handed and submit them to extra digital scrubbing to remove additional speckles or other minor issues. They overdid it (to say the least) and also removed the grain on many of the films (the thing that makes a film look look like a film and not like a video tape) and left us with a waxy sheen, a complete and total bastardization of the restorations that is both obvious and infuriating. We're currently enjoying the Blu-ray serial restorations VCI Entertainment has put out, including The Red Rider, and they look 100% better than these highly vaunted \"restorations\".\n\nSo, who is this âsomebodyâ that's responsible? All I can tell you is what Kit Parker has said: âThese Laurel & Hardy Films underwent photochemical restoration by UCLA. Unlike digital restoration, improvements in sound and picture are limited when working with celluloid. The digital technicians took the UCLA version and greatly improved on it, and the result was used in the collection.â\n\nAh. The âdigital technicians.â And âgreatly improved on it.â Uh-huh. I know one person who worked on the bonus material, who shall remain nameless, but who told me that they were aware that the films were, in their words, âover workedâ but there was nothing they could do about that. For my part, Iâm greatly disappointed at the heavy-handed digital scrubbing that was done, and thus withholding my support of a Vol. 2 (if there is one, after this) until I get some assurance that this abomination wonât be repeated.\n\nYeah, I'm pissed that I cannot recommend this set without reservations. But what great bonus material!\n\nMore in the Fun House\n\nPage Two of the Laurel & Hardy Fun House\n\nPage Three of the Laurel & Hardy Fun House"
