        "text": "Oscar-winning Actress Julianne Moore recalls exactly what was like to carry around a 70-lb animatronic dinosaur on the set. Her reveal came from Vanity Fair as she is promoting her latest film titled \"May December.\" Moore chat about how she carried around a baby Tyrannosaurus rex for director Steven Spielberg. Here is her statement about that experience:\n\n\"I think the most memorable thing about it was carrying around that baby dinosaur. Which, these were the days of animatronics, so it was before CG. It was an actual, heavy, mechanical dinosaur. It weighed probably 70-lbs, and it had a motor in it. They would turn the motor on, and you could hear it go *mimics motor noise*, and it would move like that too, in my arms, and I’d have to run. I ran everywhere holding that dinosaur, I was like, ‘This is so heavy guys! Let me put it down!' It was so fun to be in a series that’s become so iconic to us.\"\n\nThe Lost World: Jurassic Park is the sequel to \"Jurassic Park\" and it's based on the novel written by Michael Crichton. This is the only sequel that the author has written in his entire writing career.\n\nBelow is the actual video that Julianne Moore discussed about her experience in The Lost World: Jurassic Park( Start at 2:50). The film is currently on Netflix.\n\nSource: CinemaBlend"
