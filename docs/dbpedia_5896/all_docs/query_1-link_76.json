        "text": "1. David Lynch\n\nAfter all the discussion, no one could fault the conclusion that David Lynch is the most important film-maker of the current era. Providing a portal into the collective subconscious, the daydream nation conjured up in tales such as Blue Velvet, Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive is by turns frightening, exasperating, revelatory and wild. Nobody makes films like David Lynch. He is our spooky tour guide through a world of dancing dwarves, femme fatales and little blue boxes that may (or may not) contain all the answers. We wouldn't want to live in the places he takes us. Somehow, we suspect, we do.\n\nSubstance 17\n\nLook 18\n\nCraft 18\n\nOriginality 19\n\nIntelligence 17\n\nTotal 89\n\nWild at art: profile\n\nMore about Mulholland Drive\n\n2. Martin Scorsese\n\nScorsese's influence is impossible to overstate. His red-blooded canon has spawned a generation of copycats while his muscular style has become a template. That said, opinion is divided over the man's recent output. Some regard his monumental Gangs of New York as a classic to rank alongside Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. Others worry that the heavyweight champion of American movies is no longer quite punching his weight.\n\nSubstance 17\n\nLook 18\n\nCraft 18\n\nOriginality 17\n\nIntelligence 18\n\nTotal 88\n\nMore about Gangs of New York\n\nA terrible beauty: interview\n\n3. Joel and Ethan Coen\n\nTheir latest film, Intolerable Cruelty, may have marked a new, \"commercial\" phase in their career, but no one could ever accuse the Coen brothers of selling out. The Coens' special mix of arch, sculpted dialogue, film-history homage and scrupulously-framed cinematography has never failed them yet, and through their associations with Sam Raimi and Barry Sonnenfeld, have exerted a powerful, if unacknowledged, influence on mainstream event cinema. Until Fargo, they seemed content to mess about in their own particular corner of the film industry; that film's stunning popular success suddenly catapulted them into the Hollywood big league.\n\nSubstance 14\n\nLook 18\n\nCraft 18\n\nOriginality 18\n\nIntelligence 18\n\nTotal 86\n\nDouble vision: interview\n\nMore about: Intolerable Cruelty\n\n4. Steven Soderbergh\n\nSteven Soderbergh is a one-off: an independent-minded film-maker who has forged a happy working relationship with Hollywood. This is thanks to a brilliant balancing act. Soderbergh soothes the studios with expert, intelligent crowd-pleasers like Erin Brockovich and Ocean's Eleven then shifts gear for more esoteric, personal projects (Solaris, Full Frontal). His ongoing alliance with George Clooney, moreover, is the most reliable director-star double act since Scorsese found De Niro.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 17\n\nCraft 18\n\nOriginality 16\n\nIntelligence 18\n\nTotal 85\n\nMore about Solaris\n\nSteven Soderbergh at the NFT\n\n5. Terrence Malick\n\nThe lofty ranking of Terrence Malick just goes to show that it's quality, not quantity, that counts. Renowned as a ghostly, Garbo-style recluse, this fabled figure has made just three films over three decades. Even so, the wild beauty of his 1973 debut Badlands casts a formidable shadow, while his sprawling 1999 war epic The Thin Red Line at least proved that the master had lost none of his magic. Next up, apparently, is a biopic of Che Guevara. But don't hold your breath.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 18\n\nCraft 17\n\nOriginality 17\n\nIntelligence 17\n\nTotal 85\n\nMore about The Thin Red Line\n\n6. Abbas Kiarostami\n\nThe highest ranking non-American, and one of the most respected film-makers working today - by his peers if not the general public. Operating mostly in rural Iran, Kiarostami has often concealed potentially life-threatening political commentary within films of simplicity and compassion. But he has complicated his medium, too, by mixing drama and documentary, and actors and non-actors, to dizzying effect. His recent in-car drama Ten provided a daring Tehran expos√© as well as a radical new film-making technique - one that almost does away with the director entirely.\n\nSubstance 18\n\nLook 15\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 17\n\nIntelligence 18\n\nTotal 84\n\nJonathan Rosenbaum on Kiarostami's short films\n\nPeople watching: Interview\n\n7. Errol Morris\n\nMorris is the joker in this top 10, in that his position is solely down to his documentaries. Put simply, Morris is the world's best investigative film-maker. He possesses a forensic mind, a painter's eye and a nose for the dark absurdities of American life. High points include The Thin Blue Line (which unearths the nightmarish truth behind a Dallas cop killing), Mr Death (a treatise on execution-device inventor and Holocaust denier Fred Leuchter Jr), and the forthcoming Fog of War, his compelling autopsy on the war in Vietnam.\n\nSubstance 17\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 17\n\nOriginality 17\n\nIntelligence 17\n\nTotal 84\n\nMore about Fog of War\n\n8. Hayao Miyazaki\n\nIt's about time the rest of the world came to appreciate the genius of Japanese animator Miyazaki, whose films have been breaking box-office records in Japan for years. He's now in his 60s, but as this year's Spirited Away proved, the work just keeps getting better. His films create the world anew, literally. Each is set in an intricate, self-contained fantasy world that's been built from scratch and drawn with devotion. Miyazaki's stories are frequently considered children's fare but they are deeper than they look - like the best fairy tales, they conceal dark, very adult themes beneath their surfaces.\n\nSubstance 15\n\nLook 18\n\nCraft 17\n\nOriginality 18\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 84\n\nNick Park pays tribute to Hayao Miyazaki\n\nMore about Spirited Away\n\n9. David Cronenberg\n\nFew directors have ploughed such distinctive furrows as Cronenberg. And now in his fourth decade of film-making, he is still at the cutting edge. Crash set the entire film world agog with its bizarre sexual constructs; eXistenZ examined the implications of the virtual world more thoughtfully than most; and Spider superbly summoned up a bleak, decaying Britishness (largely forgotten by our own film-makers). His next film, with Nicolas Cage playing a plastic-surgery fetishist, is already inducing shudders.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 17\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 18\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 83\n\nMenace to society: interview\n\n10. Terence Davies\n\nOur highest-placed British film-maker is here because of his uncompromising and unique cinematic vision; but, with painful irony, it's also made him the highest-profile victim of Britain's commercial film industry revival. Emerging from the state-sponsored art-film sector in the mid-80s, Davies completed a trilogy of short films and two features - Distant Voices, Still Lives and The Long Day Closes. But, in a more cut-throat environment, the sensitive Davies has suffered, making only two films in a decade - one of them the international hit The House of Mirth. So it seems a shame - and somehow scandalous - that his current project, an adaptation of Lewis Grassic Gibbon's Sunset Song, should be facing major funding obstacles.\n\nSubstance 17\n\nLook 17\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 16\n\nIntelligence 17\n\nTotal 83\n\nMore about The House of Mirth\n\n11. Lukas Moodysson\n\nYou would assume that the surest way to hobble a young Swedish film-maker is to label him \"the new Bergman\". Fortunately, Lukas Moodysson seems immune to such pressure. His 2001 hit Together - about hippies living communally in 1970s Stockholm - was warm, witty and altogether disarming. By contrast, his follow-up, Lilya 4-Ever (about a Russian teen dragooned into prostitution), was a social-realist vision of hell. Heartfelt and uncompromising, Moodysson treads his own path.\n\nSubstance 17\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 17\n\nOriginality 17\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 83\n\nLukas Moodysson at the NFT\n\nMore about Together\n\n12. Lynne Ramsay\n\nRamsay, the second highest-placed Brit - and the highest woman of any nationality - has trodden a distinctive path through the lottery-fuelled sludge of modern British cinema. Her first film, Ratcatcher, set during the binmen strikes of 70s Glasgow, was the anti-Billy Elliot; her second, adapted from Alan Warner's novel More about Morvern Callar, confirmed her promise. Morvern is an authentic modern classic, with an actress, Samantha Morton, whose blank-faced performance is a perfect complement to Ramsay's studied camerawork.\n\nLynne Ramsay at the NFT\n\nMore about Morvern Callar 13. Bela Tarr\n\nIn just a few years, the Hungarian director has emerged from obscurity to be revered as the Tarkovsky of his generation, with his dark and mysterious monochrome parables, shot with uncompromisingly long, slow single camera takes. His recent Werckmeister Harmonies was a dreamlike film: compelling and sublime. From 1994, Satantango has cult status on the festival circuit, not least for its awe-inspiring length: seven hours. He is now developing a movie at least partly set in London.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 18\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 82\n\nMore about The Werckmeister Harmonies\n\n14. Wong Kar-wai\n\nHong Kong has become synonymous with action cinema, but Wong Kar-Wai is one of few exceptions. His trademark portraits of quirky urban longing have influenced Asian film as a whole, but the delectably sensuous In the Mood for Love proved that Wong is still improving (and that he has one of the best cinematographers in the business in Christopher Doyle). Next up he's making a sci-fi movie - should be interesting.\n\nSubstance 14\n\nLook 18\n\nCraft 17\n\nOriginality 17\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 82\n\nMood music: interview\n\n15. Pedro Almodovar\n\nPost-Franco Spain needed Almodovar like a desert needs rain. His early films were gaudy, bawdy and loud; drunken celebrations of the country's new-found social and sexual freedoms. But Almodovar is much more than some posturing agent provocateur. He spins soulful, spellbinding stories and creates characters that ring with life. All About My Mother and Talk to Her were exotic masterpieces that confirmed their creator as the most important Spanish director since Luis Bu√±uel.\n\nSubstance 15\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 18\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 81\n\nPedro Almodovar at the NFT\n\n16.

In 1996 Haynes had made an earlier masterpiece, Safe; few directors could have topped that, but Far From Heaven managed it.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 16\n\nIntelligence 17\n\nTotal 81\n\nTodd Haynes at the NFT\n\n17. Quentin Tarantino\n\nThe jury may still be undecided on the virtues of Kill Bill, but no one can deny the massive impact the former video-store clerk has had on cinema across the world. The chewy, minutiae-obsessed dialogue and abundant bloodletting of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction catapulted him to era-defining stature and influence beyond the wildest dreams of any director; had this poll been taken in 1995, he would have been top three, no question. But Tarantino has since been the victim of his own success: he took three years to make his third film, Jackie Brown, and another six to make his fourth. Perhaps inevitably, neither of them made the splash of his first two, but whatever else, Tarantino can still make the simple act of watching a film seem oh-so-exciting.\n\nSubstance 14\n\nLook 17\n\nCraft 18\n\nOriginality 18\n\nIntelligence 14\n\nTotal 81\n\nSaint Quentin: interview\n\nMore about Kill Bill: Volume 1\n\n18. Tsai Ming-Liang\n\nOne of the least well-known names on the list, but a director who has steadily refined his own gentle, bittersweet style. Using his native Taipei as a backdrop, Tsai distills the complexity and alienation of city life into films that are austere, unhurried and emotional, but also comical. His pre-apocalyptic The Hole included 1950s musical numbers, for example, while What Time Is It There? paid homage to Harold Lloyd in a movie about death and loneliness. In his latest, Goodbye Dragon Inn, he has almost done away with dialogue altogether.\n\nSubstance 15\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 16\n\nIntelligence 17\n\nTotal 80\n\nMore about What Time Is It There?\n\n19. Aki Kaurismaki\n\nCinema needs the occasional breath of fresh air, and you can always rely on Kaurismaki to provide it. Coming from Finland, he had a head start, but where other quirky directors last a film or two, Kaurismaki seems to have a bottomless pool of eccentric ideas to draw from. His films are an acquired taste, but they never pander to good taste. For a supposed director of art films, he's more interested in the world out on the street, or in the gutter. And his most recent, The Man Without a Past, saw him re-emerge into the global spotlight after some years at its fringe.\n\nSubstance 15\n\nLook 15\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 18\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 80\n\n'I am a lousy film-maker': interview\n\n20.

As well as being technically brilliant and a seeming workaholic, Winterbottom is arguably the most politically astute director in the business, with an unerring eye for the stories that matter.

His two best pictures (Boogie Nights and Magnolia) are works of gob-smacking ambition in one so young - lush, multi-layered ensemble pieces that spotlight the damaged souls of his native San Fernando Valley. But let's not forget the recent Punch-Drunk Love, starring Adam Sandler and Emily Watson.

After a long career in TV, Haneke graduated to the big screen in the early 90s and audiences quickly came to know they were in for a profoundly uncomfortable experience.The Piano Teacher, with Isabelle Huppert, was a disquieting study of a musician driven to agonies of despair and self-loathing.

Aleksandr Sokurov\n\nThe veteran Russian director is inexhaustibly prolific, making both features and documentaries, with 31 credits to his name over a 23-year career. His movies are powerful, poetic, often severe, and at their most accessible when they meditate on the nature of Russia. Sokurov had his biggest recent success with Russian Ark: a staggeringly ambitious single-take 90-minute journey through the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg. His latest movie, Father And Son, is an enigmatic and often baffling study of a father-son relationship between two soldiers. His work gets a lively, mixed reaction in the west, but Sokurov's admirers revere the haunting, occasionally austere power of his films.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 15\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 16\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 79\n\nMore about Russian Ark\n\n27. Ang Lee\n\nHe may have taken a bit of a stumble with The Hulk, his elevation to blockbusterdom, but the Taiwanese-born Lee clocked up plenty of brownie points over the preceding decade for his dazzling versatility, if nothing else. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (a record-breaker for a subtitled film), The Ice Storm, The Wedding Banquet and Sense and Sensibility are all testament to a career of wonderfully fertile cinematic cross-pollination. Lee's proficiency at swapping genres, but retaining a purposeful humaneness, is his hallmark.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 17\n\nOriginality 14\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 79\n\nThe middle man: more about Ang Lee\n\n28. Michael Moore\n\nYou could say it's Moore's blend of humour, righteousness and persistence that has made his documentaries so successful, but his political commitment would be nothing without the film-making skills to back it up. Bowling for Columbine has been one of the most influential films of recent years, affecting the public in a way that most directors on this list will never know, but it would never have become such a cause had it not been so rigorously researched, painstakingly constructed and broadly entertaining.\n\nSubstance 17\n\nLook 13\n\nCraft 15\n\nOriginality 18\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 79\n\nGuerrilla in the Ritz: interview\n\nMore about Bowling For Columbine\n\n31. Richard Linklater\n\nLinklater is the grunge philosopher of independent cinema. Hailing from Austin, Texas, he casually defined an era with 1991's loose-knit, haphazard Slacker. The uproarious Dazed and Confused and the seductive Before Sunrise extolled the joys of footloose youth, while his animated Waking Life spun a woozy, bong-smoking rumination on dreams and reality. Incredibly, Linklater recently graduated to the big time when his School of Rock hit number one at the US box office.\n\nSubstance 15\n\nLook 15\n\nCraft 15\n\nOriginality 17\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 78\n\nMore about Waking Life\n\n32. Gaspar No√©\n\nNot bad for someone who's only made two features, but No√© has made as much impact as you can with them. There's nothing pretty about either his carnal debut Seul Contre Tous, or last year's backwards-told rape-revenge drama Irr√©versible - both have challenged boundaries of decency and induced reactions as extreme as nausea and vomiting. In a supposedly unshockable age, that's some kind of cinematic achievement.\n\nSubstance 15\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 16\n\nIntelligence 14\n\nTotal 77\n\nMore about Irreversible\n\n33. Pavel Pawlikowski\n\nWith only one substantial feature under his belt, Polish-born, British-based director Pawlikowski has arguably the slenderest claim of all to be on this list. But Last Resort, with its mix of heartfelt social insight (the then-radical subject of asylum seekers) and improvisatory, documentary-style film-making, has exerted an influence of gigantic proportions on a whole generation of British cinema.

David O Russell\n\nRussell's natural habitat is the dysfunctional American family. He dished up a deadpan Oedipal comedy with 1994's Spanking the Monkey and then dispatched Ben Stiller cross-country in the freewheeling adoption caper Flirting With Disaster. Yet this tart, original talent adapts well to other terrain. On the one hand his big-budget Three Kings was an expert, high-concept war thriller. On the other, it can be read as a savage assault on bungled US policy during the first Gulf War.\n\nSubstance 15\n\nLook 15\n\nCraft 15\n\nOriginality 15\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 76\n\nMore about Three Kings\n\n35. Larry and Andy Wachowski\n\nNow that their Matrix trilogy is finally wrapped up, it's a good time to draw breath and appreciate the scale of the Wachowskis' achievement. Merging the techno-porn of the contemporary action movie with the artful ballet of the Hong Kong martial arts film, the sci-fi paranoia of Philip K Dick with the visual exuberance of Japanese anime, the Matrix phenomenon utterly redefined the nature of the blockbuster movie serial, as well as relegating such mid-90s action luminaries as John Woo and Roland Emmerich to the margins.

Samira Makhmalbaf\n\nYou could say Ms Makhmalbaf had it easy, being the daughter or one of Iran's greatest film-makers, but she's hardly taken any easy options. Her films get bolder and more confrontational every time - Blackboards took her into the Kurdish lands on the Iranian border; her latest, At Five in the Afternoon, was shot in the chaos of post-Taliban Afghanistan - but for all their political currency, there's still evidence of an artistic sensibility. And she's only 23 years old.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 15\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 14\n\nIntelligence 15\n\nTotal 76\n\nA woman's place: interview\n\n37. Lars von Trier\n\nTo his fans he's the impish genius who redefined cinema with his Dogme doctrine. To his critics he's Jeremy Beadle with a degree in anthropology. Either way, there's no denying the impact of this phobic, Prozac-popping Dane. His most successful pictures (Breaking the Waves, The Idiots, the upcoming Dogville) are hazardous human dramas in which cruelty and compassion come equally blended. Happily there seems little danger of von Trier selling out and heading to Hollywood. He hates America and nurses a crippling fear of flying.\n\nSubstance 14\n\nLook 15\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 17\n\nIntelligence 14\n\nTotal 76\n\nNo Dane, no gain: interview\n\nMore about The Five Obstructions\n\n38. Takashi Miike\n\nIf Miike had channelled his energies into making one film every year, rather than his customary six or seven, he could be a lot further up the list. Not that you'd want him to change. Miike's casual technical brilliance and total disregard for taste are what makes his best films such a joy. Sure, there are plenty of misfires and generic gangster pictures to his credit, too, but there's plenty of everything when it comes to Miike, surely that can't be bad?\n\nSubstance 14\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 15\n\nIntelligence 14\n\nTotal 75\n\nInterview: 'Blood isn't that scary'\n\n39.

In Alien 3, Seven, and Fight Club, he forged a string of visceral, unforgettable images; but his subsequent career has been dogged by aborted projects. Fincher's most recent film, the unremarkable Panic Room, saw him in a holding pattern - it's certainly cost him a few points.\n\nSubstance 12\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 14\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 74\n\nInterview: 'Directing is masochism'\n\n40.

The first makes gloopy studio fodder like Good Will Hunting and the odious Finding Forrester. The second is the visionary auteur of Drugstore Cowboy, Gerry, My Own Private Idaho and the Palme d'Or-winning Elephant (an elegant, ultimately devastating take on the Columbine tragedy). For the record, it is the second Gus Van Sant who gets the votes here.\n\nSubstance 14\n\nLook 14\n\nCraft 15\n\nOriginality 14\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 73\n\nMore about Elephant"
