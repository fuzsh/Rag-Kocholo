        "text": "Main article: Denis Gifford\n\nIn addition to published work on cinema, this article also includes Denis Gifford's film credits.\n\nDenis Gifford provided one of the earliest researched archives of early cinema, with The British Film Catalogue, 1895–1970, and produced numerous authoritative works on previously uncatalogued films from the UK and the US. Gifford had a particular interest in early horror and science fiction, and early comedy including Laurel and Hardy.\n\nGifford's work on cinema included both original research on cinema, such as The British Film Catalogue, 1895–1970 and British Animated Films, 1895–1985: a Filmography, which has considerable academic credibility, and more popular, heavily illustrated books, often on genre films, such as Movie Monsters.\n\nSpace Patrol Official Handbook[1] (1952); self-published.\n\nBritish Cinema: an Illustrated Guide to the Leading Players and Directors (1968); Zwemmer.

ISBN 0-85965-362-5\n\nGifford's involvement in cinema fanzines dates back to the early 1950s, and he continued to write for the fan press well into the 1980s, long after he was well established, in large-circulation magazines such as House of Hammer. Gifford also conducted a large number of recorded interviews with vintage showbusiness figures, including actors and filmmakers, intended for personal reference.
