        "text": "CHARLIE BRONSON, born Michael Peterson, is a British career criminal who has spent 35 of his 57 years behind bars. A former bare-knuckle boxer, he received a seven-year prison term in 1974 for armed robbery and has since had his sentence repeatedly extended for a series of attacks on guards and fellow convicts. In the British press he is often called the country’s most violent prisoner and  thanks to his knack for setting off riots and engineering hostage situations  its most expensive inmate.\n\nBut in “Bronson,” a stylized film biography by the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, this tabloid legend is above all a kind of performance artist, a savage showman for whom, Mr. Refn said, “violence is the brush and life is the canvas.”\n\nThis may seem like an overly romantic way to portray the life of a man who has been held in solitary confinement for a total of some three decades. But when Mr. Refn, 39, identifies Bronson’s aggression as a perverse means of creative expression, he is, in a sense, speaking from experience.\n\n“I used to think art had to be a destructive medium,” Mr. Refn said over lunch in Manhattan recently. “When I began making films I was 24. It was like punk rock. Everything had to be destroyed.”\n\nMr. Refn, the subject of a retrospective at BAMcinématek that runs from October 1 through 4, is best known for his “Pusher” trilogy  brutal, black-comic tales of criminal entanglements in the Copenhagen underworld. For “Bronson,” opening October 9, the producer and distributor Rupert Preston, who released the first “Pusher” in Britain and was a producer on the other two, came up with the idea to pair Mr. Refn, who was born in Copenhagen and raised partly in New York, with a subject that was British to the bone.\n\n“It was interesting that Nicolas knew nothing about Bronson,” Mr. Preston said. “He was able to look at the character without any preconceptions at all.”\n\nMr. Refn was skeptical at first. “I didn’t want to do another movie about crime,” he said. “But I was interested in the concept of someone who transformed himself and created his own mythology”  to the extent of renaming himself after the tough-guy actor Charles Bronson. Mr. Refn said he radically revised the existing screenplay. He added: “This is not a movie about a man escaping outward, which is usually the objective of prison movies, but about a man escaping inward.”\n\nHardly a typical biopic, “Bronson” more or less takes place inside the head of its cellbound antihero (played by Tom Hardy), who also serves as the story’s narrator, appearing on a spotlighted stage as a sinister M.C. in burlesque makeup.\n\n“The one thread that goes through everything he does is the narcissistic need for fame,” Mr. Refn said. In this regard, too, he could identify. “When I was young, all I really wanted was to be famous,” Mr. Refn said. After his parents divorced, he moved with his mother and stepfather to Manhattan, where he was, by his own account, a wild teenager and an avid club kid. “Experiencing the nightlife of New York,” he said, was like “being tempted by Faust.”\n\nHe enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts but wasn’t invited back after his first year, he said, because he smashed a table during an acting class. (“I was acting on impulse.”) Returning to Denmark, he gravitated to the family business of filmmaking (his father, Anders Refn, is a veteran editor who has worked on several Lars von Trier movies, including the new “Antichrist”). But having received much of his film education in the 1980s at New York’s declining grindhouses, he was drawn less to European art film (“the correct cinema,” as he put it) than to the grunge and gore of exploitation movies. “ ‘Texas Chainsaw Massacre’ changed my life just like ‘Breathless’ I’m sure changed my parents’ life,” he said.\n\nHe dropped out of the National Film School in Denmark to make his propulsive first feature, “Pusher” (1996), about a small-time dealer deep in debt and quickly running out of options. By the time he directed his first American film, “Fear X” (2003), an eerie psychological thriller starring John Turturro as a tormented widower, he had enough clout to recruit a pair of idols as collaborators: he wrote the screenplay with Hubert Selby Jr.; Brian Eno composed the score.\n\nBut despite earning strong reviews, “Fear X” was a financial disaster. Mr. Refn said the film had left him on the verge of bankruptcy just as his wife was expecting their first child. To pay off nearly $1 million of debt, he took a gamble and made back-to-back sequels to “Pusher,” which had been a cult hit in Europe. (This period, which Mr. Refn called “the darkest time in my life,” is chronicled in a documentary called “Gambler.”)\n\n“At first I hated the thought of going back to ‘Pusher,’ ” Mr. Refn said. But ambitious television series like “The Wire” and “The Sopranos” convinced him that there was great potential in the serial form. The eight-year gap between “Pusher” and “Pusher II” had also given him time to mature, both as a filmmaker and as a family man. Beneath their sordid surfaces the second and third “Pusher” movies focus on the power of filial ties.\n\nNot unlike the characters in his “Pusher” movies, Mr. Refn is upfront about monetary considerations. He makes genre films because “they can be financially rewarding,” he said. “Bronson” was a job he took “purely for financial reasons,” so he could buy out a producing partner and work independently on “Valhalla Rising,” a brooding movie about the Viking discovery of America that he described as “mental science fiction.” (The film was screened at the Venice and Toronto festivals recently and is expected to open in the United States next year.)\n\nThere are still traces of the self-mythologizing wunderkind in Mr. Refn’s amiably swaggering manner. A few years ago he was the subject of a Danish television biography. On one segment, he said, he delivered a teary monologue about the difficulty of growing up in a family of domineering artists.\n\n“People didn’t know if it was real or an act,” Mr. Refn said. (It was both, he explained.) On another segment, he read out all the text messages he had exchanged with Mr. von Trier, with whom he apparently has a jokingly contentious relationship.\n\nWhen he started working on “Bronson,” Mr. Refn butted heads with the film’s star, Mr. Hardy, who was already attached to the project and whom Mr. Refn said he considered replacing.\n\nMr. Hardy, speaking by phone from the set of Christopher Nolan’s “Inception,” confirms that it was an inauspicious start. “He got right up my nose,” Mr. Hardy said with a laugh.\n\nApart from his central insight about Bronson’s fame-seeking narcissism, Mr. Refn, who has never met Mr. Bronson, was not remotely interested in the conventional character psychology of a biopic. He also relished the idea of subverting a “lads’ movie,” in the British parlance, with what he called “feminine” trappings, operatic bursts of style and emotion borrowed from filmmakers like Kenneth Anger and Derek Jarman.\n\nBut Mr. Hardy, who had researched the role through a series of meetings with Mr. Bronson in a maximum-security prison, said he was uncomfortable with taking such a theoretical approach to a living subject. “My process was to get to know Charlie as best as possible and produce a work as nonjudgmental as possible,” he said. He also wrestled with the ethical question of contributing to “an already warped public opinion of a man who is perpetuating the myth himself.”\n\nBut the result suggests that the aims of director and actor were not mutually exclusive. “Bronson” combines Mr. Refn’s taste for abstract stylization with Mr. Hardy’s commitment to shaping a flesh-and-bone character.\n\n“It ended up being a real collaboration,” Mr. Refn said of his partnership with Mr. Hardy, who helped fine-tune the colloquial cadences of Bronson’s monologues.\n\n“You have to roll up your sleeves when you work with Nic,” Mr. Hardy said. “We had a good old wrestle.”\n\nFor Mr. Refn, a filmmaker who identifies with his antiheroes, “Bronson” represents a kind of exorcism. “I have a dark side, and I get it out when I make films,” he said. “By making a movie about me through Charlie’s life, it’s allowed me to analyze myself, and it’s made me a better person to live with for my wife and children.”"
