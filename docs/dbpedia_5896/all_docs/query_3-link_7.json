        "text": "Only the hardest of hearts could fail to be moved by this tremendously warm-hearted, yet clear-sighted documentary by the British film-maker Beadie Finzi, which I first saw earlier this year at the Rio film festival, at a special screening in the notorious Complexo do Alem√£o favelas, where the movie is set.\n\nIt is the story of Irlan Santos De Silva, the Billy Elliot of the Rio ghetto, a supremely talented teenage ballet student hoping to dance his way out of poverty. Finzi shows his struggle to get an audition with a classical dance company in New York, and juxtaposes this story with that of 14-year-old Isabela Coracy, a would-be ballerina fighting a tougher, uphill battle.\n\nWith wit and compassion, Finzi makes sure some of her spotlight falls on Irlan's dedicated mum and dad, struggling with empty-nest melancholy once their son has gone. A lovely film."
