        "text": "Born in 1927, Jim finished his education at Uppingham in 1944, and then served with the Derbyshire Yeomanry in North Africa and the 15th/19th King’s Royal Hussars in Palestine. In 1948 he took a special engineering apprenticeship with Vickers Armstrong in Newcastle before joining the Hardy fishing tackle business, where he spent a year ‘working at the bench’ and learning the ropes in various departments. He then qualified in work-study engineering before setting up the company’s own Work-Study Department. He joined the board in 1959 as Works Director and in 1967, shortly after the firm was bought by the Harris & Sheldon Group, was appointed Marketing Director. It was partly due to his efforts that Hardy’s fortunes improved dramatically in the home and overseas markets.\n\nLike all Hardys, Jim was a fervent and very knowledgeable fisherman, having been first introduced to the sport at the age of seven. A formidable competition caster, he won three Professional Casting Championships at world championship level and took 35 British and All-Comers Professional Casting records.\n\nHe retired from the company in 1992, after 44 years, but was retained as a consultant, often being seen in the factory taking a keen interest in the business. He spent many years researching the history of the company and writing a book, The House the Hardy Brothers Built, which was published in 1998 by The Medlar Press."
