        "text": "Synopsis\n\n'Mister Jim' is how the employees respectfully addressed their boss Jim Hardy, the last Hardy to work in the family business and now retired. It was Jim's Grandfather and Greatuncle, who in 1873 opened a small shop in the far north of England. Both passionate fisherman, they invented fishing tackle and began to sell it. Their skill, devotion, and innovative marketing strategies allowed them to conquer the world. The name Hardy's has now been synonymous with fishing for 130 years. Vintage Hardy's handmade tackle stirs the heart of many a fisherman with Prince Charles amongst the enthusiasts, these are now prized collectors items.\n\nToday the skills involved in hand made fishing tackle are dying although the company does survive. Under Hardy's and Grey, Richard Sanderson, current managing director has adapted the company to the modern world, made redundancies and transferred most of the production to China.\n\nMister Jim takes us on a journey through fast fading times to recreate this charming old family business loved the world over. We follow through changing times and the struggle to survive as a sustainable business in a modern world. Are the original values the Hardy Brothers held dear all now lost in our modern world of capitalist globalisation?\n\n√Ç"
