        "text": "Right now, it's blustery, wet and bleak, which doesn't exactly inspire going outside behaviour. Still, spring looms on the horizon – as do a slew of Netflix originals, with everything from dramas and comedies to action thrillers and cosy animated wonders. As we march on through the first few months of the year, we can look at what's ahead for our small screens.\n\nThis year, we have exciting projects from the likes of Tom Hardy and Zac Efron, a return from Lindsay Lohan, big-budget series and exciting directorial debuts from Dan Levy, Daniel Kaluuya and Dev Patel. While plenty of films and series' are already cemented in the calendar, others are still floating around looking for a place to land. Even so, here's everything we can expect on our Netflix small screens in 2024.\n\nPlayers – 14 February\n\nNetflix is edging back into the romcom game in 2024, with a handful of romantic capers, one of them being Players. The film, which stars Tom Ellis (of Luther and Miranda fame) and Gina Rodriguez, follows sports writer Mack (Rodriguez) who, after a series of successful and meaningless hook-ups orchestrated with her best friend (Damon Wayans Jr.), ends up falling for one of her targets (Ellis). Classic romcom shenanigans, no notes.\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender - 22 February\n\nBased on the hugely popular animated series of the same name, this Netflix live-action series seeks to right the wrongs of the famously terrible Avatar: The Last Airbender film that we got back in 2010. The show follows a war-torn world where people can bend the elements. Aang, the last known Airbender, has to keep order in the fragile world and fend off plans for a total takeover. It will star Daniel Dae Kim and a whole host of newcomers. The series has not been without its controversies, which is to be expected for an adaptation of such a beloved property (and considering its past turkey). Still, at least it means people will be tuning in!\n\nSpaceman – 1 March\n\nSpaceman will be the next film in Adam Sandler's $350m deal with Netflix, but if you think it will follow in the footsteps of goofy comedies like Murder Mystery or Hubie Halloween, think again. This film will see Sandler enter into the canon of sci-fi drama as he plays an astronaut sent to the edge of the galaxy who encounters a mentoring voice from the beginning of time (who takes the form of… a spider). It's based off the novel Spaceman of Bohemia by Jaroslav Kalfař and will also star Carey Mulligan and Paul Dano (as the spider). Let's hope Sandler's venture back to drama is as exciting as his turn in Uncut Gems.\n\nDamsel – March 8\n\nWe've all been there, agreeing to marry a handsome prince only to realise it was all a trap and actually we're a human sacrifice to a dragon in order to generationally keep the population of a kingdom safe. Millie Bobby Brown plays said damsel in this film, alongside the likes of Robin Wright and Angela Bassett (doing the thing). It's the latest team-up for Netflix and Brown and will tee up her final outing as Eleven in Stranger Things which is due to come out in 2025.\n\nIrish Wish – 15 March\n\nAfter the release of her schmaltzy Christmas movie Falling for Christmas, it was announced that Lindsay Lohan will be making her sustained return to the movies with an overall deal with Netflix. The next project is Irish Wish, a romcom (naturally) where Lohan finds herself in the rolling green hills of Ireland in search of her true love, only to find that her soulmate might not be who she expected. Oh, and there's some magic in there too.\n\n3 Body Problem - 21 March\n\nAfter more or less taking over the entire discourse of popular culture for a hot minute, Games of Thrones creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss have left the rudimentary tools of Westeros behind and are entering into the science fiction game with this adaptation of the bestselling novel of the same name. It follows an astrophysicist who, after seeing her father brutally murdered during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, is conscripted by the military and sent to a secret radar base in a remote region of the country. There, decisions she makes in the 1960s ripple through time. This story is so popular that two different Chinese versions have recently been made!\n\nShirley - 22 March\n\nThis is another one that's been in the works for a while but has now been pushed to sometime in 2024. Regina King stars as Shirley Chisholm, America's first Black congresswoman and the first Black woman to run for President of the United States, in this biopic set in the 1970s. The movie also stars Lance Reddick, in one of his final roles before he sadly passed away, as well as Terrence Howard and Lucas Hedges.\n\nThe Beautiful Game - 29 March\n\nThere's nothing quite like the rousing, emotional euphoria of a good feel-good sports story. And luckily, we don't ever seem to be in short supply. The Beautiful Game centres around the Homeless World Cup, a real football tournament that spotlights gifted, unhoused athletes from all over the world. Bill Nighy stars as Mal, the manager of England's homeless football team, while Michael Ward stars as Vinny, an incredible striker who has some trauma that's preventing him from reaching his full potential. Like all good sports sagas, this one revolves around a big game in Rome. Many of the people seen in The Beautiful Game are actually players who've taken part in the Homeless World Cup since its inception in 2001.\n\nRipley - 4 April\n\nIt's been a long road to get Andrew Scott's small-screen adaptation of The Talented Mr Ripley on the horizon, but all good schemes have a few hiccups along the way. Having initially been set to release on Showtime, it's now been picked up by Netflix to launch in the spring. Since then, the streamer has been drip-feeding us with some first-look images and an ambiguous teaser. Not much is known about this iteration of Tom Ripley, although we can probably guess most of its story thanks to the original source material and the iconic Jude Law and Matt Damon starring film from the '90s.\n\nMonkey Man - 5 April\n\nAh, Dev Patel. A man who should be in absolutely everything all the time. Monkey Man sees Patel take the reigns as director for the first time, and he also stars in and co-wrote it too. Not a lot is known about it yet, but the action-thriller follows a recently released ex-felon living in India struggling to get to grips with the reality of corporate greed and spiritual immorality. It's been dubbed “John Wick in Mumbai”, so count us in.\n\nRebel Moon Part 2: The Scargiver - 19 April\n\nZack Synder's Rebel Moon is only just coming out this Christmas, but he's already got a sequel planted in 2024. Synder's no stranger to building worlds, famously, and this is his sci-fi epic akin to the likes of Star Wars or Star Trek. Rebel Moon follows Sofia Boutella's Kora, a former member of the oppressive Imperium army who rallies a crew to try and overthrow the government, known as the Motherworld. Naturally, like any enormous, galaxy-spanning epic, there are more places to go and Snyder has a pretty sizeable Netflix film deal to his name.\n\nUnfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story - 3 May\n\nSomehow, we're still making business biopic stories. First Tetris, then Hot Cheetos and now Poptarts. Jerry Seinfeld is responsible for the inception of this film, which follows the great pastry race of 1963 between Kellogg's and Post Consumer Brands to try and come up with a packageable breakfast pastry. Of course, because this is Seinfeld, a killer cast has been roped in, including Melissa McCarthy, James Marsden and Hugh Grant and a whole host of comedy favourites you'll shout ‘Oh, that guy!’ at your TV about.\n\nBridgerton (Season 3) - 16 May/13 June\n\nPrepare for more bodices to be ripped, pearls to be clutched and pop bangers made into old-timey ballroom ditties. The Ton will be abuzz once the new season of Bridgerton hits our screens, this season focusing on the love story between Penelope (Lady Whistledown) and Colin. After insulting her to the rest of the lads in the final episode of last season, it's going to take some hard graft to get Colin back in the good books. Expect much of the same – dresses, balls, vague ideas of Regency England. Following its recent tradition with highly-anticipated shows, this season will drop in two parts.\n\nHit Man - June 7\n\nIt's a shame that Hit Man, from director Richard Linklater and starring Glen Powell, a man so Ken doll adjacent it's almost a crime he wasn't in Barbie, is landing on Netflix rather than getting a cinematic run, but at least we'll be able to see it one way or another. In it, Powell, who also co-wrote the film with Linklater, plays Gary Johnson, an undercover cop posing as a hitman as a way to arrest the people trying to hire him. Of course, when he ends up falling for one of his fake marks, a spanner is thrown into the works. It's some good old-fashioned action-comedy fun, but with Linklater at the helm there's a little more heft to its parts. The film is actually semi-rooted in reality, as Gary Johnson was a real guy who worked as a fake contract killer for the cops.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F - 3 July\n\nAfter mining his hit Coming to America for Amazon, Eddie Murphy is digging back into the archives for Netflix with a new outing for his iconic Beverly Hills Cop series. In Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F, Axel Foley is back on the streets with a new partner, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in the aftermath of his daughter's life being threatened. But it wouldn't be some good old-fashioned nostalgia bait without some returning characters, so Judge Reinhold's Billy Rosewood and John Ashton's John Taggart will be back too.\n\nThe Union - 16 August\n\nEver wondered what happened to your old high school flames? Mark Wahlberg and Halle Berry find out in The Union. Wahlberg plays a guy called Mike who, after tracking down his school girlfriend Roxanne (Berry), is whisked away into a world of action, secret missions and thrills. Yeah, sounds like a Mark Wahlberg and Halle Berry joint.\n\nTBC\n\nA Family Affair\n\nIt's been over a decade since Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman first played lovers in The Paperboy, but let's hope A Family Affair is less of a turkey. The film also stars Joey King, of Netflix The Kissing Booth fame, who plays a young woman who catches her mum and former boss in a bit of a steamy triste. It was originally due to be released last year, but like so many projects, fell off the calendar amidst the actor's strike. It will now land sometime this year.\n\nBack in Action\n\nIt's been a while since Cameron Diaz made a movie – nearly a decade, in fact, by the time Back in Action comes out. It's fitting for the very short logline we have for the plot, which simply says \"A woman who has been retired for 6 years comes back smarter and stronger than ever.” The comedy will see her team up with Jamie Foxx, in his fifth original for Netflix, and will also star Glenn Close, Kyle Chandler and Andrew Scott.\n\nHavoc\n\nWe've been waiting for this one for a while, and we'll have to wait a bit longer. Havoc is a gritty return for Tom Hardy, as he plays a detective fighting his way through the seedy, grimey criminal underworld of London in the midst of a drug deal gone awry to try and find a politician's missing son. The film is directed by The Raid's Gareth Edwards and also stars Forrest Whittaker and Timothy Olyphant.\n\nShout It Out Loud\n\nWe simply can't go a year without a musical biopic, and in 2024, the nostalgic lens is being turned to KISS, the glam metal rockers who became one of the most successful rock groups of the 1970s. The film will follow the first few years of the band in the 70s as they edge towards global fame and is being made in line with the group's farewell tour. Casting details haven't been released yet, so right now we have no idea who is going to be starring under all that white and black face paint.\n\nThe Electric State\n\nThis is the next Netflix/Russo Brothers link-up after The Gray Man, and will see them team up again with Marvel alum Chris Pratt. The film also stars Millie Bobby Brown, once again keeping it in the Netflix family, Ke Huy Quan and Michelle Yeoh, who we hope never stop working together. According to the logline, the movie follows “an orphaned teenager traversing the American West with a sweet but mysterious robot and an eccentric drifter in search of her younger brother.”\n\nThe Old Guard 2\n\nIt's been so long since The Old Guard came out that we wondered if we'd ever get its sequel, although, when you live forever, maybe the space of a few years feels like minutes. 2020's The Old Guard followed a group of centuries-old mercenaries – headed up by Charlize Theron – with the ability to heal themselves and live forever who are on the run from people who want to air their big secret. The film, which is based on a series of graphic novels, is fertile ground for sequel stories, and considering the first film became one of the most successful films in Netflix history, a complete no-brainer.\n\nWallace and Gromit\n\nAardman may or may not be running out of clay, but their upcoming Wallace and Gromit film is safe, don't worry. The grand return of everyone's favourite cheese-obsessed fella and his dog is due to hit screens next year in a brand new adventure, the first since 2005's The Curse of the Wererabbit. This one will see Wallace get lost in the sauce of his own inventions, and Gromit has to save him from his latest contraption, the ‘Smart Gnome’, which has developed a mind of its own. Not even our wholesome Aardman classics are safe from the looming threat of AI!\n\nAtlas\n\nSomehow, Jennifer Lopez manages to do absolutely everything, case and point her next venture into the world of sci-fi with Atlas. In it, she plays the titular Atlas Shepherd, a brilliant data analyst who joins a mission to capture a rogue robot whom she shares a mysterious past with. We've all been there. Also relatable is that she has a big distrust for A.I., but this kind seems more genuinely world-ending than fake pictures of a dog wearing jeans, and she has to forgo her scepticism to save the planet.\n\nCarry-On\n\nNo, this isn't another of your nan's favourite comedies filled with double-entendre and dirty old men. It's always good to see more Taron Egerton on screen, and in Carry-On he'll be donning the blues and badge of airport TSA agent Ethan Kopek who gets blackmailed into letting a mysterious passenger slip something suspicious onto a plane. The film will mark the first collaboration between Netflix and Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Partners, a partnership which was announced back in 2021.\n\nSix Triple Eight\n\nWe simply must excavate the forgotten stories of WWII heroism every year until we die or the world will fall off its axis. Sorry, that's just a fact. However, in Six Triple Eight by Tyler Perry, there is something genuinely quite remarkable about the history it brings to light. It focuses on the war’s only Women’s Army Corps unit of colour. Headed up by Kerry Washington, the film chronicles the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, which contributed to the war effort by sorting through years of unsent mail and making sure it made its way to soldiers deployed overseas.\n\nScoop\n\nCan you make Spotlight out of Prince Andrew's disastrous Newsnight interview? Probably not, but it will probably be fun to watch a dramatisation of the royal sweating (or not, apparently) his way through his own version of events regarding his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Scoop will see Gillian Anderson star as Emily Maitlis, Rufus Sewell as Prince Andrew and Billie Piper as producer Sam McAlister. More than just a recreation of that interview, the film will detail all the behind-the-scenes work that went into securing what is possibly one of the biggest television moments in recent history.\n\nUglies\n\nIt's been a long time since the adaptation of Scott Westerfeld's bestselling 2005 novel was announced, but now we can finally see it on the horizon for 2024. Uglies lands us in a future world where physical beauty trumps all. When people reach the age of 16, they're forced to undergo cosmetic surgery to get rid of any physical differences and make them ‘pretty'. Its lead is Tally, a 15-year-old who can't wait to get her surgery and be welcomed into the privileged world of the pretties until her best friend runs away and opens her eyes to the horrors of their society. Joey King will star.\n\nWoman of the Hour\n\nConsidering our cultural penchant for mining true crime of all its horrors, it's a surprise we haven't already dramatised The Dating Game Killer, which is one of those weird, stranger-than-fiction discoveries of a serial killer. Anna Kendrick will make her directorial debut and star in this film about Cheryl Bradshaw, the woman who, while a contestant on the '70s game show The Dating Game, chose a date with Rodney Alcala. But behind his funny answers and winning charm, Alcala was hiding the fact that he was one of the country's most brutal serial killers.\n\nBlack Doves\n\nRumour has it that the UK must produce a gritty spy thriller per year or some ancient evil from the depths will swallow the earth whole. Black Doves looks set to be that bounty this year. The series stars Keira Knightley, Ben Whishaw and Sarah Lancashire and revolves around a secret spy who hides her identity from her new partner, only for him to get roped into the grim reality of London's underworld.\n\nThe Diplomat (Season 2)\n\nThe Diplomat's first-season success proved we can never get enough of a good political thriller. So it's no surprise they're raring to get its second outing out the door. At the end of season one, the titular diplomat, Kate Wyler (Keri Russell), who is on deployment in London to prevent all-out war, is left reeling from the potential death of her husband Hal (Rufus Sewell) in an explosion ordered by the Prime Minister (Rory Kinnear) who is trying to cover up his international faux pas. Allison Janney is re-entering the political arena after The West Wing to join the second season.\n\nSquid Game (Season 2)\n\nHow do you follow the first season of a show that literally took over the entire world and became Netflix's biggest show in history? We don't envy the creators of Squid Game for having to tackle that beast, but at least they've given themselves a couple of years to hopefully get it right. The first series, about a deadly game inflicted on the most debt-ridden people in society, ended on a cliffhanger. After taking home the massive winnings, Gi-hun has his sights set on the game masters who want nothing more than for him to keep quiet so they can keep playing their evil games. Let's hope we don't find out its release date through the creepy voice of a giant playground doll.\n\nThe Umbrella Academy (Season 4)\n\nIt's the final outing for possibly the most dysfunctional family on screen. The fourth and final season of The Umbrella Academy, based on the Gerard Way comic book of the same name, will hit our small screens sometime this year, wrapping up a huge plot twist that saw our enhanced siblings sans their superpowers. According to Netflix, this final season will also see them face a bigger and worse enemy than ever before, one that wants them out of the picture for good. One last family reunion before we bid our final farewells!\n\nBodkin\n\nLike Only Murders in the Building, Bodkin will give us a group of podcasters who fancy their skills as investigators. The comedy thriller series will land us in Bodkin, Ireland, an idyllic coastal town that's become the focus of true crime vultures as three mysterious disappearances continue to plague its shores. A group of podcasters, led by Will Forte, will descend on Bodkin to try their hand at unravelling its suspicious threads but will end up stumbling across a much bigger, weirder and more destructive story than they could have imagined.\n\nThe Gentlemen\n\nGuy Ritchie's The Gentlemen gave us a lot of things: Hugh Grant being a creep, some classic Ritchie-an ‘bladdy ‘ell wot’s all this then’ and more c-bombs than you could count. Now imagine that spread across an entire series. Building on the film's premise, of drugs and London's seedy underworld, the series will land us in more moneyed territory and the tarnish beneath the upper-crust aristocracy. The White Lotus' Theo James leads, alongside Skins' Kaya Scodelario, Joely Richardson, Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito, Vinnie Jones Ray Winstone. We told you it had Guy Ritchie all over it.\n\nHeartstopper (Season 3)\n\nAre you ready for more ooey-gooey, saccharine teen queer romance that you can't help but feel so warmed by it's like your insides have stuffed inside an air fryer? Good, because Heartstopper's third season is coming this year. The coming-of-age story between Nick, Charlie and their friends continues as the gang moves through all the necessary hurdles of adolescence, from romantic fumbles to family trauma and future anxiety. Though the series has made a name for its cosy warmth, the third season will venture into darker territories than before.\n\nThe Madness\n\nIt's a good time to be Colman Domingo. Not only is he up for his first Oscar (and guaranteed to be the best dressed of the night bar none), but he also already has a slew of big projects lined up for the year - including The Madness, an 8-part thriller series. Domingo will play Muncie Daniels, a media pundit who finds himself fighting for his innocence after stumbling across a murder.\n\nOne Hundred Years of Solitude\n\nNetflix's adaptation of One Hundred Years of Solitude will mark the first-ever attempt to bring the best-selling 1967 novel to the screen, and it's no small feat. The story spans seven generations across hundreds of years of turbulent history in Latin America. It will likely face similar challenges to Apple TV+'s Pachinko, which also tackled generations of a Korean family living through Japanese occupation. Not much is known about the series yet, but it will be entirely in Spanish as per the author Gabriel Garcia Marquez's family's wishes.\n\nThe Perfect Couple\n\nSomething just feels right in the world when Nicole Kidman plays a bitchy, affluent woman in a bad wig. It's her destiny! Hopefully, The Perfect Couple will bring us more of that, as she stars as the soon-to-be mother-in-law of a woman (played by Eve Hewson) marrying into one of Nantucket's wealthiest families. However, wedded bliss is put on hold when a dead body washes up on the shore and suddenly fingers are pointing everywhere. Kidman, man, she just can't keep away from beachside murders. Elsewhere in the cast will be Liev Schrieber and Dakota Fanning."
