        "text": "While I was teaching at a Moscow film school in 1996, I was approached by Russian television to appear in a programme about my documentaries. The producer wanted to put me together with a Russian film-maker, to contrast their work against my own for British TV, and asked if I had any ideas who that might be. I didn't know much about Russian documentaries, but I had just seen a strikingly original 17-minute film called Paradise. It was made up of five scenes filmed in a village in the Kazakh steppe, each shot in one uninterrupted take. It was all pure observation, and yet each scene fell into a perfectly timed, often funny, and seemingly God-given mise en scene. The director turned out to be a student at the school where I happened to be teaching. That's how I met Sergei Dvortsevoy.\n\nAs you'd expect, this \"double portrait\" turned out rather unbalanced. On the one hand, you had an established film-maker on a BBC salary working with proper budgets; on the other, a student making a film for no money at all and living with his wife, child and cat in one room on the 11th floor of a decrepit hall of residence. Yet, embarrassingly, it was my films that felt like works in progress – uneven, impatient, trying too hard – while Dvortsevoy's short was a single-minded work of art, beautifully formed and in perfect harmony with itself.\n\nA lot changed since our meeting in 1996. The world has turned more cynical and nasty, but Dvortsevoy has stuck to his guns, making a series of extraordinary documentaries all as pure and uncynical as his student debut. He took his time over each one, working and reworking them, until they were complete. When, five years ago, Dvortsevoy disappeared off the face of the earth to make his fiction debut, I was secretly disappointed. I knew he wasn't one of these career-minded directors who treat documentary as a stepping stone to making \"real\" movies. Still, I suspected that plot, actors,and a larger crew would lead him astray.\n\nI needn't have worried. It took him four years and the odd reshoot to get it right, but in Tulpan, the story of a sailor who returns home to the Kazakh steppe to find a wife, he has managed to blend his documentary method with narrative storytelling to create something fresh and original. The film's success at Cannes, where it won the Un Certain Regard award last year, may have taken the film world by surprise, but for Dvortsevoy's fans it was a continuation of a long and patient journey, one inspiringly at odds with the logic of today's film industry. Where he can go from here is hard to say, but one thing is clear; the producers and financiers who've started besieging him with scripts and deals are barking up the wrong tree.\n\nWhen I met Dvortsevoy last February he'd just come out of a football game at Stamford Bridge. Typically, he appeared less excited about a late equaliser and Chelsea's stoppage-time winner than about the movement and body language of Frank Lampard and John Terry. Football was Dvortsevoy's first big love affair. Growing up in provincial Chimkent, southern Kazakhstan, his only plan for life had been to become a footballer. \"From the age of 10 I had nothing else on my brain,\" he says. \"I trained all day, slept with my ball in the bed.\" He got into a special sports school and at 18 he had trials with a team in Almaty, the largest city in Kazakhstan, before an injury put paid to his hopes. Instead, he fell into a traineeship as a flight radio engineer and spent nine years with Aeroflot before he came across a newspaper advert for directors' courses at a Moscow film school. \"I've no idea what possessed me to apply, especially as I'd never been that interested in cinema or even photography,\" he says. \"Literature, yes, that was serious. Chekhov, Tolstoy, I used to read a lot; but cinema was just something you went to on a Saturday night with the lads.\" He remains mystified how he got through the selection process. \"Maybe they were tickled that here was this flight engineer from nowhereseville who had no idea about film. They probably needed one village idiot in each year.\"\n\nHe says it was precisely because of his naivety and total lack of cinematic baggage that he found his style so soon. \"Basically I quickly worked out what I didn't like. They were showing us these Soviet-style documentaries, which were made of vérité shots, lots of commentary and talking heads, with people saying the sort of things they were expected to say; for the most part they were lying. But what seemed interesting were the images, the glimpses of reality where you could see people doing something, I was more interested in how people behaved rather than what they had to say.\"\n\nDvortsevoy shot his graduation film, Paradise, with a jobbing cameraman from a local TV station. \"The man kept trying to teach me what cinema was about. I remember this scene where a small kid eats a bowl of sour cream, and then licks it clean, burps, falls over backwards and falls asleep. I wanted to shoot it all in one take. The cameraman said: 'Come on, we have to cover this scene properly from different angles, close, wide, one way, then the other, and then you put it together in the cutting room and you have a scene. That's cinema!' I didn't want to antagonise the man, couldn't afford to, so I just said: 'You're probably right, but let's try and do it my way first and then we do it your way.'\"\n\nHis next film, Bread Day, was set in an abandoned Russian village, whose only inhabitants were old people, alcoholics and goats. They were kept alive by a weekly delivery of bread, which was left in a train carriage at a railway junction five kilometers from the village. The film opens with an wonderful 10-minute shot of the locals pushing the carriage with bread along an abandoned railway track.\n\nDvortsevoy's most moving and most difficult documentary, In the Dark, is contained in a small flat in an anonymous Moscow tower-block, where a blind pensioner lives alone with only a mischievous white cat for company. To stay sane, the old man weaves woollen bags, while the cat – his only friend and greatest enemy – keeps stealing, hiding and unravelling his wool. \"I was so limited in that flat. There was so little movement, even my hero's face was quite still, though he did have his emotional moments. But basically, it was a man and a cat in a room. I thought if I can make a film out of this, I must be pretty good.\"\n\nIn the Dark was Dvortsevoy's last documentary. \"I'd started feeling bad about spending time with these people, using their lives, turning them into art and then abandoning them to their own devices. You can't interfere in life like this and expect there won't be consequences. Paradise, for instance, seemed like an innocent enough film, but it went down badly with some local apparatchiks, it didn't show a positive enough image of the country, so they took it out on my hero. They made his life a misery, even had him arrested. Also, working with real people you're always tempted to dig deeper and deeper into their lives – but for the sake of what exactly? You become a vampire.\"\n\nIf, in documentaries, Dvortsevoy's strategy was to observe and lie in wait for the right moment to turn over, letting reality choreograph itself into an eloquent shot, Tulpan was a balancing act between the accidental poetry of his documentaries and the needs of drama and plot. His central character, Asa, comes back to live with his sister Samal and her sheep-herding husband Ondas, and begins negotiations to a marry local girl called Tulpan – the only eligible girl in the area. Dvortsevoy tried to organise his action in such a way as to tell each scene in a single long take, while staying open to happy accidents. A real whirlwind, for example, rises up in the steppe to engulf Asa and Ondas as they round up the herd; a goat comes up to the lovestruck Asa and kisses him on the mouth; a hyper-active toddler chases after his uncle Asa, but then changes his mind halfway through the shot and starts playing with his tortoise, which scampers off in the sand. \"This could only work with a really alert camera operator, who was constantly framing things out and including events at the right moment,\" Dvortsevoy says. \"That little boy kept looking at the camera, so it was a real challenge.\"\n\nKeeping the long takes going and getting performances from the actors can't have been easy. Admittedly, the characters and the emotions involved were not very complicated, but it must have been a challenge to keep the energy and the focus through these long takes, in which so many planned and unplanned elements played together. \"Yes, that's why I often talked out loud throughout the shots, to the horror of my French soundman, I had to shout stuff or make noises to energise the actors.\"\n\nThe key moment in the film is when Asa accidentally comes across a pregnant sheep in the steppe and helps her give birth. It's all told in a continuous 10-minute take. \"We did a lot of preparation for that. We spent days getting the sheep used to the crew and the actor, and we observed a few live births to give everyone an idea how it all works. It was a major operation. We had people keeping an eye on the herd, so we'd know in advance which sheep might be giving birth and were always at the ready.\"\n\nOf course, Dvortsevoy's methods are unthinkable in the context of contemporary western cinema, with nosy executives, fussy crews, agents, actors, health and safety issues, and completion bonds. More importantly, Dvortsevoy's cinema depends on a particular sort of landscape, where objects have texture and history, where people physically interact with nature – rather than sit in front of screens, commute in cars or trains, work out in gyms and live out their adventures in some virtual space.\n\n\"I must admit, I don't envy you having to make films in Britain,\" Dvortsevoy tells me. \"It seems like this world is becoming more and more digitised. When I applied for a visa to come to the UK, I had to go on the internet and fill in a long questionnaire with questions about myself. In the end the computer said no. I was refused a visa four times! I was turned down not by a human being who looked, listened and made a decision, but by a computer. Something in my personal details didn't make sense. It seems like people's behaviour is becoming more and more predictable and programmed. Everyone knows their place, how they fit in. But there's no way you can digitise reality out in the steppe; the world is open to possibilities. There's no way of telling which way the camel might go.\""
