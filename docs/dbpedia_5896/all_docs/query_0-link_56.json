        "text": "Post category:Miscellaneous\n\nWe could argue all day about the definition of Britishness in war films, but we all know what it means. This is the Think Defence list of the Top 25 British War Films\n\nThe definition of a British War Film is one that is largely British in character, they may have been directed by non-British directors, or have non-British actors in the cast. and may even have been made in Hollywood or elsewhere, but they retain that element of Britishness that we all understand.\n\nSo no Das Boot, Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now, sorry folks.\n\nThe judging criteria do not include historical accuracy, whether the correct buttons and rank insignia were worn, or whether the film is a ‘visceral and worthy portrayal of the realities of war’ or some other such artsy bollocks, instead, it is simply enjoyability for a wet Sunday afternoon in.\n\nIt is not a list for the film buff, historian or the yoghurt-weaving wheatgrass smoothy types for them to bemoan the inhumanity and pointlessness of war.\n\nMost of these have a backstory that is as good as, if not better, than the film.\n\nThe Think Defence Top 25 British War Films\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\n25 – Breaker Morant\n\nBreaker Morant (1980) Drama, History, War | 107min | July 3, 1980 (Australia) 7.9\n\nDirector: Bruce BeresfordWriter: Jonathan Hardy, David Stevens, Bruce BeresfordStars: Edward Woodward, Jack Thompson, John WatersSummary: During the Boer War, three Australian lieutenants are on trial for shooting Boer prisoners.

Resistance fighter Knut Straud (Richard Harris) enlists the reluctant physicist Dr. Rolf Pedersen (Kirk Douglas) in an effort to destroy the German heavy water production plant near the village of Rjukan in rural Telemark. In the process, Pedersen discovers that his ex-wife Anna (Ulla Jacobsson) and her uncle (Sir Michael Redgrave) have also joined the resistance. British commandos dispatched to destroy the plant are killed when their glider hits the mountainside at night. An improvised raid by the resistance ends in the partial destruction of the heavy water canisters, but the contingency plans of Reichskommissar Terboven (Eric Porter) enable the Germans to resume production quickly. Pedersen wants to recommend to London that the Allies bomb the plant. Straud opposes him because of the potential death toll on Norwegian civilians and a fight ensues. They send in separate recommendations, and the air raid takes place, but it fails to destroy the heavy water. A Norwegian traitor gives away the resistance hideout, and Anna's uncle is killed. The Germans load the canisters onto a ferry for shipment to Germany, and the resistance rig explosives to sink the ferry in the fjord. As the ferry is about to leave, it is boarded by the widow and baby of one of Pedersen's and Straud's colleagues. Pedersen boards the ferry and organizes a children's game of \"lifejacket\" in order to minimize civilian deaths. This movie closes with resistance members rescuing passengers as the ferry sinks. —Peter Grosvenor\n\nPhotos\n\nSee all photos >>\n\nWatch it because…\n\nThe scenery, Kirk Douglas’ chin, and the bit on the boat with the kids, nail-biting.

The Acheron is currently in the Atlantic off South America headed toward the Pacific in order to extend Napoleon's reach of the wars. This task will be a difficult one as Aubrey quickly learns in an initial battle with the Acheron that it is a bigger and faster ship than the Surprise, which puts the Surprise at a disadvantage. Aubrey's single-mindedness in this seemingly impossible pursuit puts him at odds with the Surprise's doctor and naturalist, Stephen Maturin, who is also Aubrey's most trusted advisor on board and closest friend. Facing other internal obstacles which have resulted in what they consider a string of bad luck, Aubrey ultimately uses Maturin's scientific exploits to figure out a way to achieve his and the ship's seemingly impossible goal. —Huggo\n\nPhotos\n\nSee all photos >>\n\nWatch it because…\n\nRussell Crowe is excellent.\n\nCapt.

The idea was for U.S. airborne divisions to take the towns of Eindhoven and Nijmegen and a British airborne division, reinforced by a Polish airborne brigade, to take the town of Arnhem. They would be reinforced, in due course and in turn, by the British XXX Corps, land-based and driving up from the British lines in the south. The key to the operation was the bridges, as if the Germans held or blew them, the paratroopers could not be relieved. Faulty intelligence, Allied high command hubris, and stubborn German resistance would ensure that Arnhem was a bridge too far. —grantss\n\nPhotos\n\nSee all photos >>\n\nWatch it because…\n\nTwo bridge-related films in the Top 10, who would have thought it!\n\nCorporal Hancock: Sir.\n\n[Offers mug of tea]\n\nMajor General Urquhart: Hancock.
