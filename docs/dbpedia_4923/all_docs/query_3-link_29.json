        "text": "For almost three weeks now, there has been an unceasing buzz at Hal & Mal's, a lunch spot just down the street from Mississippi's elegant, whitewashed Governor's Mansion, about the mysterious Election Day car wreck that nearly killed Gov. Kirk Fordice.\n\n''Most people,'' said the owner, Malcolm White, ''are still having a little bit of Fordice with their lunch every day. We'd be barbarians to say we're not sorry it happened, and we wish him well. But there are a gazillion questions about what happened, and I guess they can't be answered until he's well.''\n\nSince being pulled from his flaming Jeep Grand Cherokee by a passing trucker on Nov. 5, the 62-year-old Mr. Fordice has been steadily recovering at the University of Mississippi Medical Center here. His injuries included a bruised heart, lungs and liver, a broken left collarbone and shoulder blade, four broken left ribs, fractured vertebrae and a partly severed ear, his doctor said. The blustery two-term Republican, who won re-election in 1995, has endured pneumonia, a tracheotomy and shoulder surgery; he has spent most of his time in intensive care.\n\nBut because Mr. Fordice has not communicated with the public during his recuperation, the state has been atwitter with speculation and rumor about why the Governor veered inexplicably off Interstate 55 in northern Mississippi, why he was traveling without the protection of state troopers, why his aides initially provided inaccurate information about the accident, and what he was doing in Memphis, without his official escort, shortly before the crash.\n\nIt is unclear whether Mr. Fordice will be able to return to work by January, when the Legislature, which Democrats control, will convene to consider welfare overhaul, tax cuts and the state budget. But early Republican concerns that Mr. Fordice might never come back, leaving the state in the hands of the Democratic Lieutenant Governor, Ronnie Musgrove, seem to have abated.\n\nWhile serving as Acting Governor in Mr. Fordice's absence, Mr. Musgrove has been a model of restraint, limiting his activities to signing proclamations, processing extraditions, declaring weather-related emergencies and making appointments recommended by the Governor's staff.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
