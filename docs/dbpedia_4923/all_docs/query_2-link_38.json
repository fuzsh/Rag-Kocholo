        "text": "Young Guru\n\nAudio Engineer, Producer, DJ\n\nGimel Androus Keaton (born February 24, 1974) better known by his stage name Young Guru, is an American audio engineer, record producer and DJ. Young Guru was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2011 for his work on \"Empire State of Mind\" by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys. Revered as “The Sound of New York,” Young Guru possesses over a decade of experience in sound engineering, production, and A&R for the acclaimed Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings. Most recognized for shaping some of the biggest talent in hip hop, Young Guru has mixed 10 of Jay’s 11 albums, and has earned himself a number of shout-outs on Jay-Z’s tracks paying homage to his exceptional skills behind the boards. Young Guru officially became Jay-Z’s tour DJ in 2010. It is an endeavor well-suited for him, considering his impeccable knowledge of Jay-Z’s discography, and their long-standing personal and professional relationship. With such a successful track record, there is no question why Young Guru is the DJ of choice, the instructor of the creative, and a producer of timeless music. Check out his blog at http://www.djyoungguru.com/blog/ and follow him on Twitter: @Young_Guru\n\nFollowing a 16 year career in public service as State Senator, as Lieutenant Governor and finally as Governor of the State of Mississippi, former Governor Ronnie Musgrove now offers strategic guidance to Copeland, Cook, Taylor & Bush, Attorneys at Law and provides assistance in various legal specialties.\n\nDuring his term in office, Governor Musgrove focused his attention on building a solid foundation for economic growth through Mississippi’s public schools. From the early years of his public service career when he focused on the basics of air conditioning, textbooks, health care benefits for educators, and school supply money for Mississippi’s teachers to his days as Lieutenant Governor and his successful push for quality education through adequate, equitable funding for every public school in Mississippi, Governor Musgrove changed the face of public education in Mississippi. As Governor, his commitment continued as evidenced by a teacher pay package guaranteed to meet or exceed the Southeastern average, the placement of Internet‐accessible computers in every classroom in the state (a first in the nation), and his challenge to the Mississippi Legislature to fund education first before any other budget matter, a challenge the legislature met in 2003.\n\nDuring his first months in office, Musgrove led the charge to revamp Mississippi’s economic development strategies. Under his tireless leadership, Mississippi created a comprehensive approach to economic development which included reworked incentives, regional cooperation and rewarding excellence. This work paid off quickly with the location of a Nissan production facility in Canton, Mississippi, bringing a capital investment of $1.4 billion and 5,300 jobs and over 25,000 indirect jobs.\n\nGovernor Musgrove is the recipient of a Distinguished Service Award from the National Guard Bureau in Washington, D.C. He is also chairman of the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services, chairman of the Mississippi Center for Legal Services Advisory Group and is the Senior Policy Scholar in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. Additionally, he has served on the faculty of the University of Mississippi and Mississippi College School of Law. Born and raised in Tocowa near Batesville, and a graduate of Northwest Mississippi Junior College, the University of Mississippi, and the University of Mississippi Law School. Governor Musgrove and his wife, Dr. Melody Musgrove, who received her masters and doctorate from the University of Southern Mississippi and who serves as Director of the Office of Special Education in the U.S. Department of Education, have four children and reside in Madison, MS.
