        "text": "JACKSON, Miss. — As a Democrat running for the Senate in the Republican stronghold of Mississippi, Ronnie Musgrove faces a challenge that was summed up in the angry words of a middle-aged white voter doing business at the courthouse here this week.\n\n“I wouldn’t vote for him if he was the last man on earth,” said Roger Case, an employee of a fire-extinguisher company, as Mr. Musgrove campaigned a few yards away. Blacks in the courthouse beamed at Mr. Musgrove, a lanky former governor; whites, mostly, looked the other way.\n\nMississippi has not elected a Democrat to an open Senate seat since 1947, but that is not stopping the Democratic Party from heavily financing a major effort here, one of a handful of states — including North Carolina, Minnesota and possibly Oregon — it thinks it can pull from Republicans this fall in a reach for the filibuster-proof 60-vote majority.\n\nMore than $3 million has been spent by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to support Mr. Musgrove; turn on a television here and the candidates can be found flailing at each other’s ethics, morals and probity in what local analysts say is a never-seen-before barrage of negative advertisements.\n\nMr. Musgrove has inched up in the polls and one recent survey showed him statistically even with the Republican incumbent, Roger Wicker, a former congressman appointed in December to fill the Senate seat vacated by Trent Lott.\n\nThe odds for a Democratic pickup, however, out of all the states in play, may be longest in Mississippi.\n\nThe numbers in this state — which has perhaps the most racially polarized electorate in the nation — do not favor the Democrat: whites, the majority, overwhelmingly vote Republican, and 85 percent of them voted for President Bush in 2004. Even if there is a record black turnout, Mr. Musgrove would have to get about 30 percent of the white vote to win. Nonetheless, analysts give Mr. Musgrove, a hill-country populist who championed education during his terms as governor and lieutenant governor, a better-than-passing chance, particularly as the credit squeeze penetrates even here.\n\n“He’s got a shot,” said W. Martin Wiseman, a political scientist at the Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University, noting a surge in voter registration in the state that now tops 170,000 since Jan. 1. “There’s an unknown out there, and it’s going to work in Obama’s behalf.”\n\nIn mostly black Hinds County, which includes Jackson, there are now more than 20,000 new voters on the rolls since 2004, a plus for a Democrat who has also managed to attract enough white support in the past to be elected twice to statewide office.\n\n“His dilemma is how to keep every one of those conservative whites and get all the Obama vote,” Dr. Wiseman said. “It’s not easy to do in a conservative state like Mississippi. He wouldn’t have a shot if it weren’t for Obama.”\n\nIf Mr. Musgrove wins it would be an even bigger coup for Democrats than the House seat the party scored in Mississippi last spring. But the hostility of the political environment is palpable.\n\n“It won’t be Muskrat,” said Steve Covington, the patriarch of a family tent-rental business at the Mississippi State Fair here, employing a common term of derision for the former governor, when asked whom he was voting for. “Both of them are crooks,” Mr. Covington said, chuckling. “One of them’s just a little bit less.” Out of 20-odd white voters interviewed at random here this week, only four said they would vote for Mr. Musgrove.\n\nMr. Wicker and Mr. Musgrove roomed together as state senators in Jackson in the early 1990s and are similar in appearance — narrow, white-haired and in their 50s. Mr. Wicker, 57, a reserved, somewhat taciturn Air Force veteran, was known as an ally of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in his early years in Congress, where he was president of the freshman class in 1994. Anti-abortion and pro-school prayer, he nonetheless bucked his state’s conservative former governor, Kirk Fordice, as a state senator in voting for a tax increase in support of education.\n\nThe intensity of their battle has only increased as Mr. Musgrove continued his unexpected climb in the polls.\n\n“It’s really no longer about Ronnie Musgrove and Roger Wicker, it’s about the direction our country takes,” Mr. Wicker told a partisan crowd at a fish fry in rural Scott County this week, linking his opponent to Mr. Obama, whom he called, to murmurs of assent, “the most liberal person ever to run for the president of the United States.”\n\nMr. Musgrove — 52, conservative, anti-abortion, pro-gun, the son of a road-crew worker who died of pneumonia when the candidate was 7 — calls himself a “Mississippi Democrat” to separate himself from the national party. But he carries the albatross that led to his failure to win re-election as governor in 2003: he supported ridding the Mississippi flag of its Confederate emblem.\n\nMany Mississippi white voters hated the idea and turned out in force to defeat it in a referendum, and they have not forgotten.\n\n“I ain’t voting for him,” said Kerry Epperson, a supervisor at U.P.S. who was having lunch at a fried-fish restaurant as Mr. Musgrove went table-to-table nearby. “I didn’t like the way he run as governor. I didn’t like the way he handled the flag issue.”\n\nMr. Wicker is making sure the flag issue stays on voters’ minds, running a ubiquitous television advertisement this week saying Mr. Musgrove “tried to kill our state flag.” At the fish-fry rally for the Republican, an outsized flag, Confederate heraldry intact, presided over the room. On the highway into Jackson, billowing, gargantuan Mississippi and American flags fly over a giant banner promoting the McCain-Palin ticket.\n\nMr. Wicker is identifying himself with all three banners, a strategy to compensate for his unknown status outside his home precincts in the northern part of Mississippi, though he represented it over seven terms in Congress. “I’m also a conservative,” he began at a debate with Mr. Musgrove here last week, before going on to associate himself with the word “conservative” four times in rapid succession.\n\nThere are also reminders along the way of Mr. Musgrove’s divorce while in office — Mr. Wicker frequently cites the stability of his own marriage — and frequent mentions of the Democrat’s contributions from executives of a failed, state-backed beef-processing plant that cost Mississippi some $55 million. Two of those executives have pleaded guilty to giving an illegal “gratuity” to Mr. Musgrove.\n\nMr. Musgrove, for his part, avoids mentioning Mr. Obama, but does connect his Republican opponent at every opportunity with hated “Washington” — his own term of derision, and one he is betting has potency in a climate of fear that has penetrated even in an insular state that for generations has considered itself immune to national trends.\n\n“Washington told Wall Street, ‘We’re going to let y’all regulate yourselves,’ ” Mr. Musgrove told bleary-eyed students at Millsaps College here one morning this week. “The Republicans were in charge. They never said a word.”\n\nPrivately some Democratic insiders still give the edge to Mr. Wicker, in a state where the word “liberal” is still the most potent scarecrow of all. Still, the new voters make the equation an uncertain one.\n\n“You’ve got a lot of folks who have never voted, or were dormant, who are likely to vote in greater numbers than ever before, and they’re breaking for Obama,” said Dr. Wiseman, the political scientist."
