While in office, Governor Musgrove strived to provide quality public education and create economic opportunity for all Mississippians. He successfully pushed for adequate, equitable funding for every public school in Mississippi and secured improvements including increased teacher salaries, internet-equipped classrooms, and a 2003 agreement from the Mississippi Legislature to fund education before any other budget matter."
