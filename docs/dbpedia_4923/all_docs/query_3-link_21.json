        "text": "About\n\nPhil Bryant served as Mississippi’s 64th governor. Before becoming the state’s chief executive, Bryant was lieutenant governor from 2008-2011. He also served as state auditor and represented his legislative district in the Mississippi House of Representatives for five years.\n\nThe son of Dewey C. and Estelle R. Bryant, a diesel mechanic and a mother who stayed home with her three boys, Bryant learned early the value of hard work and the importance of education. The Moorhead native earned an associate’s degree in criminal justice from Hinds Community College and completed his bachelor’s degree at the University of Southern Mississippi. He holds a master’s degree in political science from Mississippi College, and before assuming his role as governor, Bryant served as an adjunct professor of government there.\n\nGov. Bryant began his career as a deputy sheriff in Hinds County and later worked as an insurance investigator before being elected to the House of Representatives in 1991. In 1996, then Gov. Kirk Fordice appointed him state auditor, a position he was re-elected to in 1999 and 2003.\n\nAs governor, Phil Bryant led Mississippi in implementing transformational public education reforms, promoting economic development and building a competitive business climate that attracted major employers like Yokohama Tire Corporation, Amazon, and Continental Tire. Under Gov. Bryant’s administration, over 36,000 jobs were announced along with more than $7 billion in new corporate investments. He is also an avid outdoorsman and is a longtime member of the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action.\n\nGov. Bryant and his wife, Deborah Bryant, have two adult children, Katie Bryant Snell and Patrick Bryant."
