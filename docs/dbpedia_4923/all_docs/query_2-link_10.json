        "text": "Stew Deen presided over the meeting. Mark Killingsworth provided the opening prayer. Bryan Shaver led us in the Pledge of Allegiance. Stew then led the club in the Four Way Test. The meeting was held at the Mugshots Bar and Grill in Hattiesburg.\n\nCoty Primeaux was the 50/50 winner today, but he failed to draw the correct card.\n\nLee Kemp introduced todayâs guest speaker, Stephen East. He is the Director of Business Development for Gulfport Behavioral Health Systems.\n\nMr. East says the primary mission of the System is to erase the stigma about mental health. He noted that a suicide is committed every eleven minutes in the United States. Twenty-two vets commit suicide every day.\n\nGulfport Behavioral Health was established on the Gulf Coast in 1984. They now have ninety beds and work with 350 other hospitals. The system is the only dedicated military unit from Florida to Texas. In addition to inpatient services, they provide outpatient programs which are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nThere are many causes for mental health issues. They include bullying, phobias, alcohol and drug abuse and gambling additions. Every treatment plan is unique to the individualâs need. Their programs include pet therapy, exercising, art, music, meditation, yoga and gardening therapy. Their treatments are covered by insurance, Medicare and are approved by the Joint Commission.\n\nIf you need assistance, dial 988. It is the 911 number for mental health treatments.\n\nThere being no further business to come before the club, Stew thanked Mr. East for his work and his comments and then adjourned the meeting with our motto: âService Above Self.â"
