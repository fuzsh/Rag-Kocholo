        "text": "MISSISSIPPI LEGISLATURE\n\n2013 Regular Session\n\nTo: Rules\n\nBy: Senator(s) Brown, Horhn, Blount, Browning, Bryan, Burton, Butler (36th), Butler (38th), Carmichael, Chassaniol, Clarke, Collins, Dawkins, Doty, Fillingane, Frazier, Gandy, Gollott, Hale, Harkins, Hill, Hopson, Hudson, Jackson (11th), Jackson (15th), Jackson (32nd), Jolly, Jones, Jordan, Kirby, Lee, Longwitz, Massey, McDaniel, Montgomery, Moran, Parker, Parks, Polk, Simmons (12th), Simmons (13th), Smith, Sojourner, Stone, Tindell, Tollison, Ward, Watson, Wiggins, Wilemon\n\nSenate Concurrent Resolution 502\n\nA CONCURRENT RESOLUTION MOURNING THE LOSS AND COMMENDING THE LIFE AND PUBLIC SERVICE OF SENATOR BENNIE L. TURNER AND EXPRESSING THE SYMPATHY OF THE LEGISLATURE ON HIS PASSING.\n\nWHEREAS, the Legislature and the State of Mississippi lost a wonderful friend, colleague, gentleman and enlightened lawmaker with the death of State Senator Bennie L. Turner, 64, on Tuesday, November 27, 2012. Senator Turner was an expert on the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 and the Senate Rules; and\n\nWHEREAS, Senator Turner, an attorney, served in the Senate seat representing all of Clay and parts of Lowndes, Oktibbeha and Noxubee Counties since 1992. He was current Chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, Vice Chairman of Judiciary, and former Chairman of Judiciary; and\n\nWHEREAS, Senator Turner led the Senate Judiciary Committee for eight years. He was first appointed to the chairmanship in early 1996 by Lieutenant Governor Ronnie Musgrove. During the election year of 1999, Senator Turner was unopposed in seeking his third Senate term. He was reappointed as Judiciary Committee Chairman by Lieutenant Governor Amy Tuck. As Chairman, Senator Turner was one of the lead negotiators during the 2002 Extraordinary Session dealing with limiting awards in civil lawsuits. This Extraordinary Session dragged on for three months amid political pressure from business people and doctors who wanted the limits and attorneys and consumer advocates who opposed them; and\n\nWHEREAS, intensely interested in the preservation and improvement of the judicial system, Senator Turner championed bills promoting increased economy and efficiency in the courts, increasing judicial support, and improving access to the courts for all citizens. As former county prosecutor, he had a special interest in the abused, neglected and delinquent children of our state and was a tireless advocate for the youth court system. He had a particular interest in the betterment of all aspects of the criminal justice system. A bill he authored established the Victims' Bill of Rights. He was also vitally involved in the movement to achieve improvements in the public defender system. With a heart for education and juvenile justice, he helped mold the Mississippi Adequate Education funding formula; and\n\nWHEREAS, former Senator, Lieutenant Governor and Governor Ronnie Musgrove said that he will miss Turner. \"Bennie Turner took every aspect of his duty as State Senator seriously. He was respected and admired by everyone because of his professionalism, even those who disagreed with him. I consider it a privilege to have served with him. Many people in Mississippi are better off today because of his work and effort\"; and\n\nWHEREAS, United States Senator Roger Wicker of Tupelo served in the Mississippi Senate from early 1988 until late 1994. He said that he and Turner were close friends for three decades. \"In addition to our years together in the State Senate, I served with him on the Board of Directors of North Mississippi Rural Legal Services in the 1980s when he served as Chairman. Bennie Turner was a true public servant who exhibited integrity and bipartisanship. He led a successful law practice and was a smart small business owner. His passing is a great loss\"; and\n\nWHEREAS, \"Senator Turner fought for fairness and justice for all Mississippians,\" Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves said. \"He was well-respected in the Mississippi State Senate, and he was beloved by both Senators and Capitol staff\"; and\n\nWHEREAS, Senator Turner was past President of the Clay County Bar Association, served four terms as Clay County Prosecutor and was past President of the Magnolia Bar Foundation; and\n\nWHEREAS, survivors include his wife, the former Edna Walker of Columbus, Mississippi, and three daughters: Angela, Carolyn and Leta; and\n\nWHEREAS, Bennie Turner was absolutely one of the most admired and respected members of the Mississippi State Senate. He had a commanding presence but was soft-spoken. He excelled in a variety of major responsibilities and served the Senate, his constituents and the State of Mississippi exceptionally well. Bennie's public service was exemplified by fairness and sound judgment, and he set the highest standard as a leader in the Mississippi Senate and as a true friend:\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING THEREIN, That we do hereby mourn the loss and commend the life and legacy of public service of Senator Bennie L. Turner of West Point, Mississippi, and express to his family the sympathy of the Legislature on his passing and our thanks for sharing Bennie with us and with the State of Mississippi.\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That this resolution be presented to the family of Senator Bennie L. Turner and made available to the Capitol Press Corps."
