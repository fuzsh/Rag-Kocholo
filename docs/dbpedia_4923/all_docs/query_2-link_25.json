        "text": "Mississippi political leaders, including former Govs. William Winter and Ronnie Musgrove, turned out to see Sam Gore's new sculpture of the late Lt. Gov. Evelyn Gandy.\n\nThe event Thursday at the old Supreme Court chambers was a tribute to \"Miss Evelyn,\" a trailblazer whose distinguished career in public service spanned more than 50 years. Mississippi's first female lieutenant governor, she served in that role from 1976 to 1980.\n\nSpeakers like retired Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Kay Cobb and retired Mississippi Court of Appeals Judge Mary Libby Payne spoke of their long friendship with Gandy and her lengthy list of accomplishments.\n\nIt was Gandy who persuaded her Payne to run for the Court of Appeals and her endorsement was a key factor in her winning the race in a district covering 19 counties.\n\n\"She was a loving big sister,\" Payne told the crowd packing the chambers on the second floor of the Capitol. \"She was not an aloof politician. She was a personal friend.\"\n\nCobb, Payne and Mississippi attorney Jennifer Ingram Wilkinson were among the members of the Evelyn Gandy Memorial Committee organizing the event. They got help with from Gandy friends and supporters. The Women in the Profession Committee of The Mississippi Bar sponsored the program and helped raise funds for the sculpture.\n\nDuring her remarks, Wilkinson noted Sam Gore's hard work. A 1951 Mississippi College graduate, former MC art department chairman and internationally celebrated artist, Gore spent four months working on the Gandy sculpture at his home in Clinton.\n\n\"Thank you Dr. Gore for your personal gift and talent,\" said Wilkinson, whose father and Gandy were law partners in Mississippi.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Musgrove was among those who stopped by to personally thank Gore. House and Senate members plus former Gandy staffers and supporters lined up for photographs beside the sculpture of the late lieutenant governor.\n\nGandy, who died in 2007, also served her native Mississippi as state treasurer, commissioner of insurance, public welfare commissioner and as a Mississippi House member. She made two unsuccessful races for governor. But Gandy didn't quit serving the Magnolia State. She practiced law in her hometown of Hattiesburg.\n\nMany in the crowd of distinguished guests - from former Supreme Court Chief Justice Ed Pittman to Lt. Gov. Phil Bryant and lawmakers like Rep. Alyce Clarke and Sen. Alice Harden have been Gandy admirers for decades. They say Gandy's superb record of public service made a long-lasting impact in Mississippi.\n\n\"I believe Gov. Gandy would be pleased to be honored in this special way,\" Wilkinson said.\n\nDr. Gore's bronze sculpture of Evelyn Gandy will stay on permanent display at the Mississippi Capitol.\n\nThe ceremony in the old Supreme Court chambers was held one floor below the Mississippi Senate where Gandy served four years as the Senate's presiding officer.\n\nSign-up For Our Newsletter\n\nGet the latest news about Mississippi College delivered right to your inbox by subscribing to the Along College Street e-newsletter."
