He was the son of Chief Sobhuza I and Thandile Ndwandwe. Mswati was the greatest of the Ngwane chiefs, and the Ngwane adopted his name and came to be known as Swazis, and their country as Swaziland. In 1845 he established contact with the Boer settlers of Ohrigstad and in 1846 a treaty was concluded ceding some territory to them in exchange for 110 head of cattle. In the early years of his reign several of his brothers were challenging his authority. His relations with one of them, Somcuba, who negotiated the 1846 treaty, became openly hostile in 1849; after a skirmish Somcuba and his followers received the protection of the new Boer settlement of Lydenburg. At the same time Mswati had to face the threat of Zulu invasions. But because of internal Zulu divisions the last major Zulu attack occurred in 1852; as a result Mswati was able to dispose of Somcuba in 1855, and the remainder of his reign was free from either domestic challenges or serious external threat. He consolidated Ngwane hegemony internally, and expanded his influence externally. In 1860 a disputed succession in the Shangane kingdom enabled him to extend his control far towards the north. Much of his acquired territory was later lost again, but by the time of his death Swaziland was a far more cohesive political unit than it had been at his accession. His encouragement of contact with the Boers, however, may have been responsible for the eventual loss of Swazi independence in 1894.\n\nMswati III\n\nMswati III, original name Makhosetive (b. April 19, 1968, Manzini, Swaziland [now Eswatini]), king of Swaziland/Eswatini (1986- ). He was one of more than 60 sons of King Sobhuza II (d. 1982); according to some estimates, Sobhuza had had 112 wives and as many as 600 children. Reported to be the second youngest son of Sobhuza, Prince Makhosetive had the necessary qualifications to succeed him - he had no full brother and was left-handed - and as soon as he was chosen, he was sent to be schooled in the U.K., where, at Sherborne School in Dorset, he resumed his education following his coronation on April 25, 1986. At the age of 18, he became the world's youngest head of state. His accession had been expected to take place when he reached the age of 21, but the political uncertainty resulting from the lack of a monarch was thought to have caused the coronation to be held earlier. Leaders representing 37 countries traveled to Mbabane for the coronation ceremony, which included a series of rich displays of Swazi culture including traditional dances and Swazi poets reciting coronation poems. No invitations were issued for the royal dinner, to which all were welcome. Hundreds of thousands of Swazis attended the ceremonies, and every Swazi household contributed about £1.50 toward the costs. The highlight of the ceremony was the wedding of the king to his chosen bride. Despite his youth, he was quick to consolidate his power. In May he dissolved the Liqoqo (council of elders), which was the king's traditional advisory body but which had become the most powerful body in Swaziland during the three years without a monarch and thus posed a potential threat to his power base. In October he reshuffled his cabinet, putting two of his brothers in key positions. He married his 12th wife in 2005. In 2018 he renamed the country Eswatini.\n\nMtei, Edwin (Isaac Mbiliewi) (b. July 12, 1932, Marangu, near Moshi, Tanganyika [now in Tanzania]), secretary-general of the East African Community (1974-77) and finance minister of Tanzania (1977-80).\n\nMtshali\n\nMuallem\n\nMtshali, Lionel (Percival Hercules Mbeki) (b. Nov. 7, 1935, Utrecht, Natal [now in KwaZulu-Natal], South Africa - d. Dec. 13, 2015), premier of KwaZulu-Natal (1999-2004). He was also South African minister of arts, culture, science, and technology (1996-99).\n\nMtshweni-Tsipane, Refilwe (Maria) (husband's name Tsipane added in 2019), Mtshweni also spelled Mtsweni (b. Sept. 3, 1973, Witbank [now Emalahleni], Transvaal [now in Mpumalanga], South Africa), premier of Mpumalanga (2018-24). She has also been chairman of the National Council of Provinces (2024- ).\n\nMuallem, Walid (Muhi Eddine), also spelled Moallem, Arabic Walid al-Mu`allim (b. July 17, 1941, Damascus, Syria - d. Nov. 16, 2020, Damascus), foreign minister of Syria (2006-20). He was also ambassador to Romania (1975-80) and the United States (1990-99) and a deputy prime minister (2012-20).\n\nMuasher, Marwan (Jamil), Arabic Marwan al-Mu`ashir (b. 1956, Amman, Jordan), foreign minister (2002-04) and deputy prime minister (2004-05, 2005) of Jordan. He was also ambassador to Israel (1995-96) and the United States (1997-2002), information minister (1996-97), and minister of the royal court (2005).\n\nMuatetema Rivas, Cándido (b. Feb. 2, 1960, Batete village, near Luba, Bioko island, Spanish Guinea [now Equatorial Guinea] - d. June 16, 2014, Berlin, Germany), prime minister of Equatorial Guinea (2001-04). From 2005 to his death he was ambassador to Germany.\n\nMuazu, (Alhaji Ahmadu) Adamu (b. June 11, 1955, Boto [now in Bauchi state], Nigeria), governor of Bauchi (1999-2007).\n\nMubako, Simbi (Veke) (b. April 20, 1936, Zaka, Southern Rhodesia [now Zimbabwe]), home affairs minister of Zimbabwe (1984-85). He was also minister of justice and constitutional affairs (1980-84) and national supplies (1985-90) and ambassador to the United States (1999-2005).\n\nMubarak\n\nMubarak, (Muhammad) Hosni (Said), Hosni also spelled Husni (b. May 4, 1928, Kafr al-Meselha, al-Minufiyah governorate, Egypt - d. Feb. 25, 2020, Cairo, Egypt), president of Egypt (1981-2011). He rose through the officer corps of the air force, becoming director of the air academy (1967-69) and air force chief of staff (1969-72). In 1972 Pres. Anwar as-Sadat appointed him commander of the air force. He was credited with the success of the force in the opening days of the war with Israel in October 1973 and was promoted to the rank of air marshal in 1974. In 1975 he was named vice president. He served as chief mediator in the dispute between Morocco, Algeria, and Mauritania over the Western Sahara. In 1978 he took over a key position as vice president of the ruling National Democratic Party. He was seated next to Sadat when the latter was assassinated on Oct. 6, 1981. The parliament then nominated him as presidential candidate, and he was confirmed in a referendum on October 13. He was reelected the same way in 1987, 1993, and 1999. He improved relations with the other Arab countries, although he reaffirmed Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel and cultivated good relations with the United States, which provided more aid to Egypt than to any other country except Israel. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, he supported the U.S.-led military coalition against Iraq. He was chairman of the Organization of African Unity in 1989-90 and 1993-94. In June 1995 he escaped uninjured when gunmen fired on his motorcade as he arrived in Addis Ababa for an OAU meeting; it was one of several attempts on his life. Islamic militants threatened his regime throughout. In 2005 he won Egypt's first multi-candidate presidential election, which was marred by a very low turnout. His son Gamal was seen by many as his likely successor. In the face of a massive popular uprising in early 2011 he made the concession not to seek another term in elections later in the year, but refused demands to step down immediately; however, as the protests intensified, his resignation was finally announced. In June 2012 he was sentenced to life in prison for complicity in the killing of protesters; in January 2013 a retrial was ordered. In July 2013 a military coup seemed to restore the old guard; after having themselves massacred hundreds of protesters, they released Mubarak from prison in August. However, in May 2014, he was sentenced to three years for embezzlement (confirmed on appeal in May 2015).

March 25, 1989), prime minister of Jordan (1950, 1955, 1956). In 1924 he entered local government service in Amman. A strong nationalist, he balked at the 1928 constitutional agreement with Britain, claiming it gave Britain too much say in Transjordan's affairs. Britain was responsible for Transjordan under a League of Nations mandate. From 1929 he served repeatedly in the cabinets of Transjordan (later Jordan), including as minister of communications (1944), interior minister (1944-45, 1948-50, 1951-53, 1957), foreign minister (1955), and deputy prime minister (several times). As a member of the non-Arab Circassian minority, he was generally respected by the Palestinians living in Jordan. After the formal annexation of the West Bank (1949-50), he was prime minister and opposed King Abdullah's negotiations with Israel. He was a major figure in the interim between the abdication of King Talal in 1952 and the full accession of King Hussein in 1953. In 1955 he resigned as prime minister due to his opposition to the Baghdad Pact, a U.S.-backed plan to create a belt of anti-Communist nations from Turkey to Pakistan; in 1956 he was recalled by King Hussein in an effort to regain public support but he resigned again a month later. In 1957 he was again asked to form a government but failed. He left the cabinet in 1963. He was also president of the Senate (1956-59, 1961-63, 1965-74). In 1958 he was also chairman of the federal parliament of the short-lived Arab Union formed by Jordan and Iraq. One of his sons, Azmi al-Mufti, was assassinated in 1984 while serving as a diplomat in Romania.\n\nMuftic, Osman (b. March 8, 1934, Sarajevo, Yugoslavia [now in Bosnia and Herzegovina] - d. July 27, 2010, Zagreb, Croatia), Croatian politician. He was minister of science and technology (1990-91) and ambassador to Iran (1993-96).\n\nMüftüoglu, Ismail (b. 1939, Çaykara, Turkey), justice minister of Turkey (1975-77).\n\nMüftüoglu, Sadik Tekin (b. 1927, Çaycuma, Turkey - d. June 14, 1975, Ankara, Turkey), finance minister of Turkey (1973-74). He was also minister of commerce (1966-67) and a minister of state (1967-69).\n\nMugabe\n\nMugabe, Robert (Gabriel) (b. Feb. 21, 1924, Kutama, Southern Rhodesia [now Zimbabwe] - d. Sept. 6, 2019, Singapore), prime minister (1980-87) and president (1987-2017) of Zimbabwe. He joined the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole in forming the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), a breakaway from Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), in 1963 and became its secretary-general. In 1964 ZANU was banned and he was arrested for \"subversive speech.\" While still in prison he ousted Sithole as ZANU's leader in 1974. In 1975 he was freed, and in 1976 he and Nkomo formed the Patriotic Front to fight against the white-ruled Rhodesian government. Their guerrillas operated from bases in neighbouring Zambia, Mozambique, and Angola. He participated in the negotiations in London in 1979 that ended the war and led to British-supervised parliamentary elections in February 1980. His party, now called the Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front), or ZANU (PF), which drew its support from the majority Shona people, won a majority of seats, and he became prime minister, forming a coalition government with ZAPU, which was supported by the minority Ndebele people. But in 1982 he ousted Nkomo from the coalition cabinet, and ethnic strife between the Shona and the Ndebele followed. In 1984 his party adopted a new constitution aiming for the establishment of a one-party state. In 1987 Mugabe's and Nkomo's parties merged under the name of ZANU (PF) and Mugabe became the first executive president of Zimbabwe. He was reelected in 1990, 1996, and 2002. In 1998 he intervened in the civil war in Congo (Kinshasa) in support of Pres. Laurent Kabila. Controversial programs of land redistribution and slum clearance in the early 2000s resulted in international isolation of Mugabe and Zimbabwe's withdrawal from the Commonwealth. Amid hyperinflation and economic collapse, Mugabe seemed to try to rig the 2008 elections, leading to further condemnations of his regime; Britain stripped him of an honorary knighthood he had received in 1994. His opponent Morgan Tsvangirai, who was leading in the first round, pulled out of the runoff, citing intimidation, and Mugabe then won with 90% of the vote. A unity government with Tsvangirai as prime minister was formed in 2009. In 2013 Mugabe - at age 89 - roundly defeated Tsvangirai in the first round, winning 61% of the vote. Though there were still complaints of fraud, improved economic conditions had certainly reduced popular resentment. In 2015-16 he was chairman of the African Union, having already been chairman of the OAU in 1997-98. In 2017 his apparent attempt to set up his wife Grace as his successor led to a military intervention, loss of support by his own party, and a threat of impeachment, in the face of which he, at age 93 the world's oldest leader, finally resigned.\n\nMughairy, Lyutha Sultan al- (b. May 9, 1947, Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika [now in Tanzania]), Omani diplomat. She has been permanent representative to the United Nations (2011-16) and ambassador to Germany (2016- ).\n\nMugica (Rodríguez), Adolfo (b. June 11, 1867, Gualeguay, Entre Ríos, Argentina - d.

Sept. 22, 1859, La Marsa, Tunisia), bey of Tunisia (1855-59); cousin of Ahmad.\n\nMuhammad (ibn Abdul Aziz Al Saud) (b. 1910/12, Riyadh, Nejd [now in Saudi Arabia] - d. Nov. 25, 1988), Saudi prince; son of Abdul Aziz. He was governor of Madinah (1926-54).\n\nMuhammad IV, original name Sidi Muhammad ibn `Abd al-Rahman (b. 1803 - d. [drowned during boating party] Sept. 11, 1873, Marrakesh, Morocco), sultan of Morocco (1859-73).\n\nMuhammad V\n\nMuhammad V, original name Sidi Muhammad ibn Yusuf (b. Aug. 10, 1909, Fès, Morocco - d. Feb. 26, 1961, Rabat, Morocco), sultan (1927-53, 1955-57) and king (1957-61) of Morocco. He was the third son of Sultan Yusuf. On his father's death in 1927, he was chosen as successor by the French authorities, who expected him to be more manageable than his two older brothers. In 1933 the Moroccan nationalists, wanting to make Muhammad a national symbol, initiated the Fête du Trône, an annual Throne Day festival to mark the anniversary of his accession. His speeches on these occasions, while moderate in tone, served to encourage nationalist sentiment. During World War II, he supported the Allies, and U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt met with him at the Casablanca conference in 1943 and expressed opposition to continuing French rule. In 1944 Muhammad began to let his sympathies for the nationalists appear. In a speech in Tangier in 1947 he ignored France but stressed the affinities of Morocco with the other Arab states. In 1951 the French, unable to impose their will on the sultan, mobilized the Berber tribesmen against him and on the pretext of protecting him surrounded his palace with troops, extorting from him a partial disavowal of the nationalist movement. In 1953 the French deported the sultan to Corsica and then to Madagascar and appointed an elderly nonentity to succeed him. The result was a great increase in his popularity and in acts of violence. The French government, already faced with rebellion in Algeria, yielded in 1955 and he made a triumphal return. In 1956 he secured Morocco's full independence; in 1957 he took the title of king. His son Mawlay Hassan (later King Hassan II) resented the slow pace of government, and in 1960 Muhammad made him deputy prime minister and relinquished active direction of the country.\n\nMuhammad VI\n\nMuhammad VI, original name Sidi Muhammad ibn Hassan (b. Aug. 21, 1963, Rabat, Morocco), king of Morocco (1999- ). The oldest son of King Hassan II, he completed secondary schooling at the Royal College in Rabat, then entered the Muhammad V University in Rabat, where he received a bachelor's degree in law in 1985 and certificates of higher studies in political sciences in 1987 and in public law in July 1988. In November 1988 the crown prince went for a few months' training to the headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels. He then entered the University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis in France and received a doctorate in law in October 1993, his thesis dealing with relations between the European Economic Community and the Arab Maghreb Union. Although he was rumoured to lead an active social life, he also took on increasing public responsibilities and represented his father at a number of political meetings and ceremonial functions, both in Morocco and abroad. He especially became known for heading several campaigns to alleviate poverty. In July 1994, he was promoted to general of division. In February 1999 he represented Morocco at the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan. After the death of King Hassan on July 23, 1999, he took the throne as Muhammad VI. He brought about a policy of gradual liberalization; in November 1999 he dismissed the long-serving interior minister Driss Basri, who symbolized political repression. In March 2002 he married Salma Bennani; their engagement had been officially announced in October 2001 in a break with royal tradition as previous kings' wedding details had never been discussed.\n\nMuhammad, Abdel Halim (b. April 10, 1910, Omdurman, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan - d. April 16, 2009, Khartoum, Sudan), member of the Committee of Sovereignty of The Sudan (1964-65). He was mayor of Khartoum in 1956-60.\n\nMuhammad, Ali Mahdi, Somali Cali Mahdi Maxamed (b. c. 1939, Mogadishu, Somalia - d. March 10, 2021, Nairobi, Kenya), president of Somalia (1991-97).\n\nMuhammad (Husani), Ali Nasir (b. 1939, Dathina district, Yemen), prime minister (1971-85), chairman of the Presidential Council (1978), and chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Council (1980-86) of Yemen (Aden).\n\nE. Muhammad\n\nMuhammad, Elijah, original name Elijah Poole (b. c. Oct. 7, 1897, Sandersville, Ga. - d. Feb. 25, 1975, Chicago, Ill.), leader of the Nation of Islam (1934-75). Around 1930, he met the founder of the sect, Wallace D. Fard (or Wali Farad), at Temple No. 1 in Detroit. He soon became a devoted aide to Fard, who relieved him of his \"slave name\" Poole. When Fard mysteriously disappeared in 1934 Muhammad succeeded him as head of the movement. His succession was disputed by others in Detroit, and he moved to Chicago in 1936 where he established Temple No. 2. During World War II he advised followers to avoid the draft, and as a result was jailed (1942-46) for violating the Selective Service Act. Calling himself the \"Messenger of Allah,\" he gradually built up the membership of the \"Black Muslims,\" aided by his most prominent disciple, Malcolm X, who broke with him, however, in 1964. Muhammad advocated black separatism and the adoption of a religion based on the belief that blacks are Allah's chosen people; because triumph would be divinely accomplished, blacks should not involve themselves in politics. He became known especially for his flamboyant rhetoric demonizing white people. In his later years, however, he moderated his tone and stressed self-help among blacks. He developed the Nation of Islam's empire of schools, restaurants, stores, a bank, a publishing house, and farmlands. After his death in 1975, the Nation of Islam was continued under different names, led by his son Wallace D. Muhammad, before becoming part of the worldwide orthodox Muslim community in 1985. Another group, restoring both the name and the founding principles of Elijah Muhammad's original Nation of Islam, was established under the leadership of Louis Farrakhan in 1978.\n\nMuhammad, Fadel (b. May 20, 1952, Ternate, Maluku [now in Maluku Utara], Indonesia), governor of Gorontalo (2001-09). He was also Indonesian minister of maritime affairs and fisheries (2009-11).\n\nMuhammad, Mar'ie (b. April 3, 1939, Surabaya, Netherlands East Indies [now in Jawa Timur, Indonesia] - d. Dec. 11, 2016, Jakarta, Indonesia), finance minister of Indonesia (1993-98).\n\nMuhammad Ahmad\n\nMuhammad Ahmad (ibn al-Sayyid `Abd Allah) (b. Aug. 12, 1844, Dirar island, Sudan - d. June 22, 1885, Omdurman, Sudan), ruler of the Sudan (1881-85). Having attracted a number of disciples, in 1870 he moved with them to a hermitage on Aba island in the White Nile, 280 km south of Khartoum. He built a unified movement that for a time would transcend tribalism and weld the Muslim faithful into an unconquerable military machine. He gradually became convinced that the entire ruling class had deserted Islam and that the khedive, the viceroy of Egypt, was a puppet in the hands of unbelievers and thus unfit to rule over Muslims. In March 1881 he revealed to his closest followers what he considered his divine mission - to purify Islam and to destroy all governments that defiled it. On June 29 he publicly assumed the title of al-Mahdi (\"the Right-Guided One\"), an eschatological figure in Islamic tradition. In the following years he made himself master of almost all the Sudanese territory hitherto occupied by the Egyptian government, capturing an enormous booty of money, other valuables, and military supplies - including Krupp artillery and Remington rifles. By the end of 1883 his Ansar (\"helpers,\" a name first given to those people in the city of Medina who helped the Prophet Muhammad) had annihilated three Egyptian armies sent against them, the last a force of 8,000 men with a huge camel train, commanded by Gen. William Hicks. His crowning victory was the capture of Khartoum on Jan. 26, 1885 (during which Maj.Gen. Charles George Gordon was killed against the Mahdi's order). He then set up his capital at nearby Omdurman. But his rule was brief. He fell ill and died in June 1885. At his wish his temporal functions were assumed by the caliph `Abd Allah.\n\nMuhammad al-Amin, also spelled Mohamed Lamine (b. Sept. 4, 1881, Ksar Said, near Tunis [or Carthage], Tunisia - d. Sept. 30, 1962, Tunis), bey of Tunisia (1943-57); cousin of Muhammad al-Munsif.\n\nMuhammad al-Habib, also spelled Mohamed Lahbib (b. Aug. 13, 1858, Le Bardo, near Tunis, Tunisia - d.

May 11, 1906, Dermech palace, near Carthage, Tunisia), bey of Tunisia (1902-06); son of Ali Muddat.\n\nMuhammad al-Munsif, also spelled Mohamed Moncef (b. March 4, 1881 - d. Sept. 1, 1948, Pau, France), bey of Tunisia (1942-43); cousin of Ahmad. He was deposed by the Free French on May 15, 1943, on the grounds that he was a Vichy collaborator; he abdicated on July 6. He was exiled to Algeria (Laghouat, then Tenés) and, from 1945, to Pau.\n\nMuhammad Ali (Bey), Arabic in full Muhammad `Ali Bay bin Muhammad Tawfiq (b. Nov. 9, 1875 - d.

Aug. 2, 1849, Alexandria, Egypt), governor of Egypt (1805-48, 1848-49). He arrived in Egypt in 1801 as second in command of an Albanian regiment sent by the Ottoman government to oust the French, who had invaded Egypt in 1798. He managed to be named the wali (governor) in 1805. Continuing the task begun by the French, he put an end to Egypt's traditional society and eliminated the Mamluks, the former ruling oligarchy. He introduced elements of European civilization but governed generally according to Ottoman principles. He sought to entrench himself and his family as hereditary rulers. By 1815 most of Egypt's agricultural land had been converted into state land, and profits from agriculture became available to the ruler. His attempt to construct a modern industrial system failed. Even the agricultural sector declined ultimately and by the mid-1830s his policy of turning Egypt into a massive plantation for his own benefit had reached a point of diminishing returns. Meanwhile, he helped suppress rebellions against Ottoman rule in Arabia and Greece and also invaded the Sudan. European intervention in Greece caused the destruction of his fleet at the Battle of Navarino (1827), but in 1831 he felt that he was strong enough to challenge the sultan and invaded Syria, which was given to him on condition of tribute. In the second war (1838-41) he came close to winning the throne of Constantinople, but the European powers intervened, agreeing in 1840 to end Egyptian rule in Syria. In 1841 he and his family were granted the hereditary right to rule Egypt and the Sudan, but the sultan's suzerain rights remained intact. Owing to his failing lucidity, power was officially transferred in 1848 to his son Ibrahim, who died shortly thereafter; Muhammad Ali was restored but himself died in following year.\n\nMuhammad `Alim Khan (b. 1881 - d. April 28, 1944, Kabul, Afghanistan), emir of Bukhara (1911-20).\n\nMuhammad an-Nasir, also spelled Mohamed El Naceur (b. July 14, 1855, La Marsa, Tunisia - d.

May 10, 1886, Waterford, Ireland - d. Dec. 16, 1971, Dublin, Ireland), Irish politician. He took part as a lieutenant in the Irish rebellion of 1916, was afterward interned at Frongoch and then was returned as Sinn Féin member of parliament for the Clontarf division of Dublin in December 1918. A member of the Irish Republican brotherhood, he became chief of staff of the Irish Volunteers in 1918 and assistant minister for defense (1919-21) in the Dáil ministry. He played a prominent part in the fighting before the truce of July 1921, and his assessment of the military situation caused him to give significant support to the treaty in December of that year. He was defense minister in the Dáil ministry formed by Arthur Griffith in January 1922. After Michael Collins' death in August, Mulcahy became commander in chief of the Free State forces and carried chief responsibility for the conduct of operations against the irregulars in the civil war. He was also defense minister in William Thomas Cosgrave's administration from September 1922 to March 1924 when he resigned. He returned to office as minister for local government and public health (1927-32) and represented Dublin city in the Dáil (1921-37 and 1938-43). He succeeded Cosgrave as president of the Fine Gael party in 1944 when he was returned to the Dáil for County Tipperary but served under John A. Costello, a less controversial figure, as minister for education in the interparty governments of 1948-51 and 1954-57. He resigned from the leadership of Fine Gael in 1960.\n\nMulder, Connie, byname of Cornelius Petrus Mulder (b. June 5, 1925, Warmbad [now Bela Bela], Transvaal [now in Limpopo], South Africa - d.

Jan. 4, 1896, Zutphen, Netherlands - d. March 18, 1970, Amsterdam, Netherlands), justice minister of the Netherlands (1951-52).\n\nMuldoon\n\nMuldoon, Sir Robert David (b. Sept. 25, 1921, Auckland, N.Z. - d. Aug. 5, 1992, Auckland), prime minister of New Zealand (1975-84). In 1949 he became chairman of the Young Nationals, the youth section of the conservative National Party (NP). After two unsuccessful bids (1954, 1957), he was elected a member of parliament (1960) and served as undersecretary of finance (1963-66), supervising the country's conversion to a decimal currency. After serving as minister of tourism (1967), he became minister of finance (1967-72) and developed into an interventionist who referred to his budget tinkering as \"fine-tuning.\" In 1972 he became deputy to the new NP leader John Ross Marshall, and a general election defeat later that year left Marshall defenseless against a challenge from his deputy in 1974. He led the National Party to victory in the general elections of 1975 and again in 1978 and 1981. Also holding the finance portfolio throughout his premiership, he pursued generally conservative financial policies in an attempt to achieve balanced growth without undue inflation. The results were not as intended; the economic pattern was one of low growth, high inflation, growing unemployment, and high external debts and borrowing. In foreign policy, he was decidedly anti-Soviet in his views, re-emphasized New Zealand's defense commitments to the United States and Australia under the ANZUS pact, and backed Britain in the 1982 Falklands crisis. Muldoon identified with the average New Zealanders he called \"Rob's Mob,\" and he retained his leader-of-the-mob image even after he was knighted (1983). The NP was defeated in an ill-advised snap election he called in July 1984 and he lost the party leadership soon afterward, but he retained his seat in parliament until 1991.\n\nMulele, Pierre (b. July 25, 1929, Kulu-Matenda village, Belgian Congo [now in Kwilu province, Congo (Kinshasa)] - d. Oct. 9, 1968, Kinshasa), commander-in-chief of Kwilu (1964). A supporter of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, he was education minister of Congo (Léopoldville) in 1960. After the overthrow of Lumumba, he switched his allegiance to Antoine Gizenga, serving in his rump government in Stanleyville and as its envoy to the United Arab Republic. After the collapse of that government, he spent about a year in China. He returned in 1963 and started a bloody uprising in Kwilu. His rebels controlled most of the province by January 1964. But Congolese army forces finally routed him; in November 1964 he was reported to have fled to the Sudan. In September 1968 Pres. Joseph-Désiré Mobutu sent his foreign minister, Justin Marie Bomboko, to Congo (Brazzaville) to lure Mulele back by giving the impression he would benefit from an amnesty proclaimed in August. But on his return he was arrested and Mobutu said the amnesty applied only to political prisoners, not to war criminals. An emergency military tribunal sentenced him to death for murder, rape, armed robbery, and rebellion on October 8, and he was executed the following day.\n\nMules, Sir (Horace) Charles (b.

Müller\n\nMüller(-Franken), Hermann (b. May 18, 1876, Mannheim, Germany - d. March 20, 1931, Berlin, Germany), chancellor of Germany (1920, 1928-30). In 1903 he was elected to the Görlitz town council. Elected to the executive committee of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 1906, he steered a moderate course between the left and right wings. He represented the party at congresses of the Second International and in July 1914 was sent on an abortive mission to France to coordinate Socialist opposition to the impending World War I. He became a member of the Reichstag in 1916 and, after the revolution of November 1918, entered the new provisional government and was co-chairman of the Central Council of the republic (1918-19). As foreign minister (1919-20) he signed the Treaty of Versailles for Germany (June 1919). After Wolfgang Kapp's abortive coup (March 1920), Müller assumed office as chancellor until the June 1920 elections. From then on, Müller (who acquired the byname Müller-Franken to distinguish himself from other Müllers in the Reichstag) was the parliamentary leader of the SPD, which was to remain in opposition for eight years. After its success in the 1928 elections, he formed a \"grand coalition\" government with the moderate parties - the last parliamentary-based government of the Weimar era. A naval construction program was begun under his administration, and the Young Plan was negotiated, which reduced the reparations payments stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles. He was frequently in conflict with his own party. The advent of the Great Depression led to the breakup of the coalition; Müller was forced to resign on March 27, 1930, when his party wished to increase unemployment benefits for the workers and would not support him in a compromise on the question.\n\nMuller, Hilgard (b. May 4, 1914, Potchefstroom, Transvaal [now in North West province], South Africa - d. July 10, 1985, Pretoria, Transvaal [now in Gauteng], South Africa), foreign minister of South Africa (1964-77). He served as a city councillor (1951-57) and mayor (1953-55) of Pretoria. He was elected to parliament as National Party member for Pretoria East in 1958. He was high commissioner (1961), then, following South Africa's withdrawal from the Commonwealth, ambassador (1961-64) in London before becoming foreign minister. Both as ambassador and minister, Muller encountered problems resulting from South Africa's increased isolation following its change of status from Commonwealth member to republic and its rigid enforcement of apartheid policies. Though he remained largely a background figure, he played an influential role in formulating policies governing relations with black African countries. He withdrew from politics in 1977.\n\nMüller, Johan (b. Oct. 22, 1889, Viljandi, Russia [now in Estonia] - d. Nov. 3, 1981, Scarborough [now part of Toronto], Ont.), interior minister (1933-34) and justice minister (1933-38) of Estonia.\n\nMüller, Júlio Strubing (b.

Aug. 25, 1954, near Newmarket, Ont.), Canadian politician; grandson of Sir William Mulock. He was postmaster general (1940-45).\n\nMuloki\n\nMuloki, Henry Wako (b. Feb. 18, 1921, Bulamogi, Uganda - d. Sept. 1, 2008, Kampala, Uganda), Kyabazinga of Busoga (1956-62, 1996-2008); son of Ezekieri Tenywa Wako III. His first period of rule was characterized by power fights, some of which ended up in the High Court following suits by two of his challengers. With Muloki subscribing to the Democratic Party, his predecessor William Wilberforce Kadhumbula Nadiope III, then vice-president and a ruling Uganda People's Congress party diehard, used his political muscle to grab the throne from Muloki. Nadiope's attempt to use the courts to legitimize his usurpation of the throne was unsuccessful. It took the intervention of Pres. Milton Obote through an express parliamentary act for Nadiope to be recognized as Kyabazinga. Nadiope, however, ran out of favour shortly after when Obote locked him up together with four cabinet ministers over an alleged rebellious act. The kyabazingaship, like other traditional, cultural, and hereditary institutions, was abolished in 1967 by Obote's government. In 1980, Muloki was appointed chairman of Uganda Airlines and later, a director of the Uganda Marketing Board. The traditional institutions were restored in 1993, but his return to the throne met another round of interference as another royal traditional chief, Eriakesi Kiregeya, claimed it was his turn to be Kyabazinga. The two ended up in court, where Kiregeya lost, and Muloki was re-installed on Feb. 11, 1996. The kyabazingaship in Busoga is an elective post from within the five royal clans of the 11 Busoga clans, and it is held for a given period, but when Muloki was elected the second time, the royal chiefs decided that he was to rule until his death, in recognition of his age and contribution to the kingdom.\n\nMulroney\n\nMulroney, (Martin) Brian (b. March 20, 1939, Baie-Comeau, Que. - d. Feb. 29, 2024, Palm Beach, Fla.), prime minister of Canada (1984-93). He did not at first run for elected office but instead concentrated on gaining control of the provincial Progressive Conservative Party apparatus in Quebec. He made a bid in 1976 for the national PC leadership, finishing a close second to Joe Clark. In his second attempt he defeated Clark on June 11, 1983. He won a seat in the House of Commons in a Nova Scotia by-election on August 29. In the general election of Sept. 4, 1984, the Conservatives won a parliamentary majority by one of the largest margins of victory in Canadian history, 211 of 282 seats. In the election campaign he put the Conservatives in the centre of the political spectrum. He promised efficiency in government management and an improvement in economic conditions. During his first term economic growth was strong, job creation was high, and inflation was kept under control. His government was reelected in 1988; the elections were viewed partly as a referendum on his proposed free-trade pact with the United States. His political success rested in part on his creation of a coalition of Quebec nationalists and western conservatives, and he sought to unify the country while recognizing Quebec's status as a \"distinct society\"; the collapse of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords were among his greatest disappointments. After signing a free-trade agreement and an acid rain pact with the United States, he announced his retirement from politics in early 1993; he was succeeded as party leader and prime minister by Kim Campbell that June. Allegations that he had accepted kickbacks in 1988 on the sale of 34 Airbus jets to Air Canada led to the first-ever criminal investigation into the affairs of a Canadian prime minister in 1995; it was ended in 2003 for lack of evidence.\n\nMulugeta Eteffa, Ethiopian diplomat. He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1992-96). He was also ambassador to France and the Vatican (1996-2000).\n\nMulumba Lukoji, (Crispin) (b. March 5, 1943 - d. March 3, 1997, Johannesburg, South Africa), prime minister of Zaire (1991).\n\nMulumba Mudiandambu, Édouard (b. Jan. 16, 1956, Tshimbulu, Kasaï, Belgian Congo [now in Kasaï Central, Congo (Kinshasa)]), acting governor of Lomami (2021-22).\n\nMuluzi, Atupele (Austin) (b. Aug. 6, 1978, Lilongwe, Malawi), home affairs and internal security minister of Malawi (2015); son of Bakili Muluzi. He has also been minister of economic planning and development (2012-14), natural resources, energy, and mining (2014-15), lands, housing, and urban development (2015-17), health (2017-19), and energy (2020- ) and a minor presidential candidate (2019).\n\nB. Muluzi\n\nMuluzi, (Elson) Bakili (b. March 17, 1943, Machinga, Nyasaland [now Malawi]), president of Malawi (1994-2004). He was minister of education (1976-77) and transport and communications (1982) and minister without portfolio (1977-82) under Pres. Hastings Kamuzu Banda. He became president in an election that ended Banda's dictatorship, riding a wave of popular support for his promise to reduce poverty afflicting 60% of Malawians. But not much changed in the 10 years he held power; Malawi remained one of the world's poorest countries. He conceded that democracy did not bring economic gains. \"Malawians cannot eat democracy,\" he often said. His bid to amend the constitution to allow him to stand for a third term was rejected by parliament. He then handpicked Bingu wa Mutharika as his successor. Mutharika was elected in 2004 but in 2005 left Muluzi's United Democratic Front (UDF), accusing his former allies of blocking his clampdown on corruption. Muluzi himself was briefly investigated for corruption in 2006, but remained a powerful political force and was endorsed by the UDF as its candidate for the 2009 presidential election.

April 30, 1980, San Juan), governor of Puerto Rico (1949-65); son of Luis Muñoz Rivera. He served as secretary to the resident commissioner in the U.S. (1916-18) and returned to Puerto Rico in 1926. After joining the Liberal Party, he was elected to the Puerto Rican Senate in 1932. He was expelled from the Liberal Party in 1937 because of his alignment with the radicals advocating complete independence from the United States. He changed his mind about the issue, however, and called for an improvement of living conditions on the island before statehood or independence should be considered. In 1938 he organized the Popular Democratic Party, which won the 1940 elections on this platform. He was made president of the Senate, a post he held until 1948. He worked closely with the U.S.-appointed governor, Rexford G. Tugwell, to improve housing, farming, and industrial conditions. When the U.S. granted Puerto Rico the right to elect its own governor (1948), Muñoz Marín won the office by an overwhelming margin; he was reelected in 1952, 1956, and 1960. In 1952 Puerto Rico's status was changed to that of a commonwealth. It thus became self-governing in most internal matters without giving up the benefits of economic union with the United States and exemption from U.S. taxes. His \"Operation Bootstrap\" brought rapid economic growth; by the 1960s Puerto Rico had the highest standard of living in Latin America. In December 1963 he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He refused to run for a fifth term as governor in 1964, stepping aside to serve once again in the Senate of Puerto Rico.

Nov. 15, 1916, Santurce, Puerto Rico), Puerto Rican leader. He founded the newspaper La Democracia, the purpose of which was to obtain Puerto Rican autonomy from Spain, in 1889 and became a leader in the autonomist parties. In 1897 Puerto Rico was given a charter of home rule, and he soon became secretary of state and later president of the first autonomist cabinet. He resigned in 1899 as the United States put an end to the short-lived home rule. He spent most of the rest of his life in the U.S., urging measures to help his country. In 1904 he dissolved the Federal Party he had founded earlier, and joined the broad-based Unión de Puerto Rico. He became Puerto Rico's resident commissioner in Washington, D.C., in 1910 and died just before successful completion of his campaign for passage of the Jones Bill, which gave Puerto Rico a large measure of self-government (though less than under the Spanish charter).\n\nMuñoz Rodríguez, Fidel (b.
