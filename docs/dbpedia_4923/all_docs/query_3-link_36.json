        "text": "Mrs. Fordice was called the \"Eternal First Lady\" and received numerous awards for her activities both during and after her husband's tenure as governor. The Mississippi State Legislature awarded her a formal recognition during the 1999 regular session.[1] In Washington, D.C., she received the Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson National Award, and U.S. President George W. Bush presented her with the Presidential Service Award.[2]\n\nShe was listed in 2000 in Marquis Who's Who in the World and the following year in the Cambridge Press's 1000 Great Americans. In 2002, she was included in Marquis Who's Who of American Women. She also received the Medal of Honor from the Daughters of the American Revolution. She was knighted as \"Dame of Grace\" by the Russian Orthodox Order in recognition of humanitarian efforts on behalf of the city of St. Petersburg, Russia.[2]\n\nFollowing the divorce, her ex-husband remarried in 2000 but divorced again in 2003. Kirk Fordice then became ill with cancer, and his ex-wife was at his side when he died at the age of seventy in 2004.[3]"
