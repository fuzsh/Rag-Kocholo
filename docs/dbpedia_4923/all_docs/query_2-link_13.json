        "text": "Ronnie Musgrove: The 2008 Special Election for the US Senate\n\nRonnie Musgrove has dedicated his life to serving the people of Mississippi. For over two decades, he's taken a leading role in the State to improve education, expand economic development, and ensure that government lives within its means.\n\nIn 2008 he ran for the U.S. Senate to change the way Washington works and restore honesty and integrity to our government.\n\nThis was his website for the 2008 campaign.\n\nContent is from the site's 2008 archived pages.\n\nCampaign Headquarters\n\n921 N. President St. - Suite A\n\nJackson, MS 39202\n\n(601) 592-5047\n\nMailing Address\n\nP.O. Box 24477\n\nJackson, MS 39225-4477\n\nWashington Isn't Working\n\nMississippi needs a senator determined to change the Washington way of doing things, because it's hurting Mississippi and every other state in this country.\n\nThere is a complete disconnect between what they argue about in Washington and what people worry about at home. But I hear you. That's why I'm running for the U.S. Senate.\n\nJoin me and together we'll change the direction of Mississippi and our nation.\n\nGov. Ronnie Musgrove\n\nCandidate for U.S. Senate\n\nAn aside: I followed Gov. Ronnie Musgrove's campaign from its start to his defeat by incumbent Senator Roger Wicker in a 2008 special election for one of Mississippi's seats in the U.S. Senate. His opponent, Republican candidate Roger Wicker, was appointed to the position by Governor Haley Barbour when Trent Lott resigned.\n\nAll I can say is thank goodness for the wonderful hair alternatives that most of us refer to as wigs. Without my Raquel Welch wigs saving me from any bad hair days when I was doing live on camera reports, I don't know what I would have done- perhaps wear a hat all the time. I don't think so. I can't understand how any professional woman doesn't have a least a couple of wigs in her arsenal of \"looking good\" under all and any circumstances back up. I happen to like the Raquel Welch wig brand, but there are certainly other wig manufacturers that offer stylish looking wigs for the professional woman. Heck, you don't even have to have a job. What a great option ( a wig) when you simply don't have the energy, or more likely the time to coif one's unruly hair.\n\nGetting back to the campaign... In 2000 and 2004, Mississippi overwhelmingly supported George W. Bush by a nearly 60 percent margin. Despite some polling showing Republican Sen. Roger Wicker with a comfortable lead over former Democratic Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, both campaigns agreed the race was going to come down to every last vote. An exciting presidential election was also proceeding at the same time and some folks was hoping that with an African-American (Obama) at the top of the Democratic ticket, the prospect was high for all Democrats to win big in November. Unfortunately for Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, his campaign fell short of that goal.\n\nOnce the elections were over I took a well needed vacation. Several months before the end of the campaign I looked into The Whaler Resort in Kaanapali on the Hawaiian island of Maui. This Maui resort looked perfect for relaxing. I could spend my days sunbathing or snorkeling on the three mile beach right out in front of the resort which is exactly what I did for the first four days. Once I had decompressed I then started tp explore other aspects of the island. I did a sunrise watch at the top of the Haleakala crater followed by a 24 mile downhill bike tour. A stupendous adventure. Every night I would relax on the rental's lanai sipping wine and watching the sunset. I don't happen to play golf so I couldn't take advantage of the two world class golf courses located in Kaanapali. However I did stroll some of the links in the early evening after all play had stopped. By the end of two weeks I was refreshed and ready to get back to my job.\n\nIssues\n\nBiography\n\nRonnie Musgrove lost the special Senate race with 44.7% of the vote to the Republican incumbant, Rodger Wicker who won with 55.3%.\n\nRoger F. Wicker had takenover Trent Lott's seat after Mr. Lott resigned.\n\nMusgroveForSenate.net"
