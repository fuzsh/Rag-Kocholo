        "text": "A first-term Democrat in the Mississippi House is running for lieutenant governor in 2019. MPB's Ashley Norwood reports.\n\nRep. Jay Hughes of Oxford is running for the second-highest office in state government. The lieutenant governor presides over the state Senate and has considerable influence over which bills become law. Hughes's top priorities if elected include public education, highways and mental health services, priorities he says the current leadership is ignoring.\n\n\"I failed to see any real bills every year that are brought just for the good of the people. I realized how broken it really is at the top and it needs change. I think the more people get to know me, they'll see that I am not a seasoned politician. But I am just like them and I want a better Mississippi and I want change,\" said Hughes.\n\nThe seat will be open because Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves is limited to two terms. Former Mississippi Gov. Ronnie Musgrove says he's supporting fellow Democrat Jay Hughes because he's been among the most vocal supporters of public education in the Legislature.\n\n\"Jay Hughes and a few others are the ones that have been talking about education and how education has been shortchanged by the leadership in the legislature today. Jay Hughes has been a consistent voice for improving and investing in education. Investing in our teachers and investing in our public schools is the reason Mississippi will be better, because of our investment in education,\" said Musgrove.\n\nRepublican Delbert Hosemann, the third-term secretary of state, is widely considered among possible candidates for lieutenant governor. His office declined to comment. In a statement, Lt. Gov. Reeves says he appreciates the opportunity to serve and hasn't decided if he will run for governor in 2019.\n\nAshley Norwood, MPB News."
