        "text": "FLASHBACK to JANUARY 4, 2000: The tightest governor's race in state history is finally settled by a vote in the Mississippi House of Representatives. Neither Democrat Ronnie Musgrove nor Republican Mike Parker had gotten a majority of the popular or electoral votes, so it was up to the legislature to choose the winner.\n\nMusgrove was the lieutenant governor at the time, and he was presiding over the state Senate when a messenger stepped in to whisper in his ear that that the majority-Democrat House, voting mostly along party lines, had just voted in his favor. He would be sworn-in in a matter of days.\n\nSince neither candidate had gotten a majority, they were forced to wait two months until the house could make a final decision, as dictated by the state constitution. That left no time to plan the customary inaugural ball and related festivities.\n\nMusgrove served four years as governor, but he lost his bid for re-election to Republican Haley Barbour.\n\nCopyright 2016 MSNewsNow.
