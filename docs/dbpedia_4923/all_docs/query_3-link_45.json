        "text": "In a night of surprises, Democrats came within inches of winning the coveted Mississippi governor's race in a dead heat that could be decided in the Democratic-controlled state House.\n\nWith ballots still uncounted in Mississippi, Democrats stood to gain two of the top three political prizes of the off-season election after narrowly winning the Philadelphia mayor's race.Republicans achieved their own victory in the South: complete control of the Virginia Legislature, which gives the GOP the power to redraw congressional lines and an edge for next year's expected challenge to vulnerable Democratic Sen. Charles Robb.\n\nWith next year's presidential races in sight, Tuesday's elections provided crucial momentum. The Republican National Committee spent twice as much as the cash-strapped Democratic National Committee, pumping about $1.5 million into races nationwide.\n\nDemocrats had high hopes for a big win in Mississippi, however. If the election goes to the House, where Democrats hold a better than 2-to-1 advantage, Democratic Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove would succeed two-term Kirk Fordice, the state's first Republican governor this century.\n\nUnder state law, the House would elect the governor during its session next year if no candidate gets a majority of the popular vote. Two minor-party candidates split just enough votes to make that scenario likely.\n\nWith 99 percent of precincts reporting, Musgrove had 369,267 votes or 49 percent and Republican Mike Parker, a former congressman, had 362,988 votes or 49 percent. Republicans said they expected to seek a recount.\n\n\"We're going have to wait another day to find out exactly what has happened,\" Parker told about 500 supporters who were not subdued by the close numbers.\n\nIn Virginia, Republicans retained their majority in Virginia's Senate and claimed at least 52 seats in the 100-seat House -- the first time ever that the GOP has held control of the entire Legislature.\n\nGov. Jim Gilmore had pushed hard for the victory, and spending for the races was expected to top $25 million.\n\nIn Philadelphia, operatives in both major parties had expected GOP businessman Sam Katz to upset City Hall veteran John F. Street, despite Democrats' 4-to-1 edge over Republicans.\n\nWith 96 percent of precincts reporting, Street had 211,136 votes or 50 percent of the vote, while Katz had 203,908 or 49 percent.\n\nTurnout and race were key factors in the nation's fifth-largest city, where 40 percent of the 1.4 million residents are black. Katz is white; Street will become the city's second black mayor.\n\nLast-minute campaign appearances from President Clinton may have made the difference in Philadelphia's hard-core Democratic districts. With outgoing Mayor Edward G. Rendell as the DNC's new chairman, Democrats would love a victory in the city that will be host to the GOP presidential convention next summer.\n\nDemocrats also scored big victories in Indianapolis, where Bart Peterson defeated Republican Sue Anne Gilroy, and in Columbus, Ohio, where Democrat Michael B. Coleman defeated Republican Dorothy Teater. Both cities have been run by Republicans for more than a quarter-century.\n\nVoters also decided a number of ballot issues. In San Francisco, voters banned ATM bank fees even though many experts consider the law unenforceable and the industry has promised a court fight. Maine voters approved a measure to legalize medical marijuana and rejected a proposal to ban a certain late-term abortion procedure.\n\nColorado voters approved a $2.3 billion bond issue for 28 statewide road improvements, including widening congested I-25, which runs through Denver. A measure to expand a light-rail system in the Denver area also passed.\n\nTax questions for sports stadiums failed in St. Paul, Minn., passed in Scottsdale, Ariz., and were up in the air in Houston and San Antonio.\n\nIn Houston, Mayor Lee Brown, former national drug czar, won a second term, and in Baltimore, Democrat Martin O'Malley was elected on platform of zero tolerance on crime. In San Francisco, Mayor Willie Brown was forced into a runoff by fellow Democrats.\n\nIn New Jersey, Democrats made slight inroads into the GOP's 48-32 margin in the Assembly. Democrats picked up at least one and possibly three seats.\n\nIn Washington state, a Republican incumbent defeated his Democratic challenger in a special election for a state House seat, assuring a 49-49 partisan split for another year. The district, along the Idaho line, hasn't sent a Democrat to the Statehouse since 1936.\n\nDemocrats control the state Senate and the governor's office."
