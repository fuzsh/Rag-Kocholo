I'm canceling car rolling and it\n\nisn't right for me to welcome you to the second inauguration of Daniel Kirkwood Fordyce Jr. as governor of the state of Mississippi. Today it's historic for the car scam in this century the electorate has chosen a man to succeed himself in the highest elected office in our state and traditionally marks the celebration of new responsibilities and new opportunities to often we expect the rights and rewards of living in a free society. But are not willing to accept the hard work the dedication and sacrifice. Which must be the foundation of that society. In the Book of Virtues William Bennett emphasizes self-discipline compassion responsibility friendship. Work. Courage. Perseverance honesty. Loyalty. And by. Far\n\nthe stripes are not optional. For history tells us that when such values are abandoned civilization and chaos running. It is therefore imperative that we teach these values to our children. Proverbs 22 tells us. Trying up a child in the way he should go and when he is oh he will not depart from it. If we do not accept this task we will be responsible for the mass of the uniques. After too many years of self indulgence. It is now time for us to reflect upon the importance of personal involvement service to our community and individual work for the good of all. It is time to set aside personal agendas and to work toward renewing the Jeffersonian concept of a citizen democracy. Consider the words of Representative Robert Clark of Ebenezer. This is how we have brought Mississippi as far\n\nas we have. All these people working together. Working together will continue to make a better Mississippi.

Let us show them the agents of our future that one person can make a difference. And that has inherently right. Tis a small thing that just properly pricing our children and yet depends upon it is the\n\npreservation of this day and this nation the last best hope of freedom. Thank you very much.

Born in February of 1934 Daniel Kirkwood Jr. received degrees from Purdue University. And has completed a distinguished\n\nmilitary career retired with the rank of colonel after serving 18 years in the Army Reserves. Family. And long time resident of Vicksburg. Kirk has established himself as a successful businessman and has been recognized by his peers within the state. And across the nation for his accomplishments in his field. Governor Ford eyes is the immediate past chairman of the Southern Governors Association and the Southern got growth policies but were currently serves on the executive committee of the Republican Governors Association Committee on Economic Development and commerce. And as co-chair of the National Governors Association job creation task force. That's the biographical part but two faces two phrases best describe Governor Ford eyes during his first term in office. He is truly a fiscal conservative and a promoter of economic development. He deserves great credit for establishing\n\nMississippi's righted a phone and supporting the 98 percent rule which prevents the legislature from budgeting 100 percent of the state's revenue and creates a reserve fund for emergencies. Fordyce has been in office we have seen the elimination of the cap capital gains tax an increase of five million dollars in the tourism budget the creation of thousands of new jobs and it concentrated effort to recruit new businesses and industries to expand existing businesses. But the governor made perhaps his decision in 1955 when he married the Patricia Owens object. They have four children and eight grandchildren and I assure you that on any given day Governor forward eyes is more than willing to discuss with you as opposed to politics. Daniel Card Jr. the name will be remembered in Mississippi history for generations to come as the only governor to be elected to two consecutive four year terms during the 20th\n\ncentury. It is my pleasure to present to you the governor of the state of Mississippi the honorable Kirk for dots. Thank. The mother of. The grandmother of eight. And wife of Governor four eyes. First Lady Pat Fordyce has surely are in for her sale. A place in history as one of Mississippi's most energetic enthusiastic warm and gracious first ladies as first lady Mrs. Fordyce has worked to implement literacy programs promote immunization of Mississippi's children and recruit volunteers to raise funds with the\n\nhope of improving the quality of life for our handicapped and seriously ill children and their families in a coordinated effort with the Department of Public Safety. Mrs. Fordyce contributed to the publication of The Violence Prevention resource. She truly exemplifies. What we term as hospitality and southern charm. Ladies and gentlemen it is my pleasure to present to you the first lady of the state of Mississippi MS Patricia Owens for us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank. You. Scripture which he has chosen for this occasion.\n\nThank you Governor Musgrove. From the Sixty seventh chapter. God be merciful unto us and bless us and cause his face to shine upon us upon earth. Among all nations. Let the people praise thee. Let the people praise. Oh let the nations go ahead and sing for them. Judge the people righteously and govern the nations upon the earth. Let the people praise the people praise the. Then shall the earth yield her increase and God even our own God shall bless us. God shall bless us. And all the ends of the earth shall fear him.\n\nAmen and Amen. Yeah.\n\nMississippi code section seven states that the governor\n\nand augur write it at 12 on the first Tuesday following the ascertaining of who is elected governor or as soon thereafter. As practicable as the noon hour approaches on this selected day. And keeping with this statutory mandate I called on Chief Justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court the honorable Diane Lee to administer the governor's Oh Chief Justice. Governor if you would come forward. Which of these repeat it to me. I thought I was doing you. I then your Kirkwood Fordyce during your home is where you solemnly swear that I will support the\n\nConstitution United States that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the state of Mississippi and the Constitution of the state of Mississippi and obey the laws there are. That I am not disqualified from holding the office of governor that I am not disqualified from holding the office of governor and that I will discharge the duties of the others and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office with him about which I am about to enter so help me God. Thank you very. Much. It was good.\n\nRight. That's it. So thank you. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you all. Thank you so much what I have a beautiful glorious day this is. Warmer than 1992 and. I stood on the steps of this capitol four years ago. Humbled by the challenge before us and heartened by your support and thankful for this opportunity for service given by God. To a 57 year old contractor from Vicksburg. I stand here today no less humble. Even more heartened. And\n\nsupremely full. I feel the weight of this momentous occasion. And I'm keenly aware that after the first four years of public service a governor is judged by the voters. But in the last four years he is judged by history. The challenge in 1992 was to move this ship of state together forward. The challenge now. Is to prepare for the years beyond 2000. I say today that with the new millennium. Will come a new Mississippi. We have moved Mississippi forward. Together we have accomplished much. Free enterprise and entrepreneurship are alive and well in the state of Mississippi. People are more prosperous. Our welfare recipients are enjoying their first taste of personal initiative and hope in decades. The future for Mississippi's children beckons brighter. Criminals are more\n\nfearful for their punishment is administered more swiftly and with more certainty. Together. We have introduced into the great marketplace of ideas. Efficiency and accountability in state government. Effectiveness in innovation in education and fiscal responsibility with a hard earned tax dollars of this at the center since four years ago all these have been revolutionary ideas but now they are the driving force behind the citizens to restore government of the people by the people and for the people. This is not been an administration it has been a crusade. The great political movement of which we are a part. Is in a sense a rediscovery of what originally made this country great as we\n\nanticipate the 21st century. What was a radical idea in the latter part of the 18th century is unfortunately still an extreme concept to many. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence we hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their create. By their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among those are life liberty. And the pursuit of happiness. And then he went on to write that the only powers a government can morally exercise are those given with the consent of the governed. Mississippi has a unique opportunity to succeed in the next millenium. Not only because of the success that our state has enjoyed in the last four years but also because of our shared experiences of the entire 20th century.\n\nExperience is a great teacher. Mississippi like no other state has experienced and faced the problems and challenges of the last 100 years. It has been said that character is forged in the crucible of adversity. Our mettle has been forged in the same bar. We have a hard shining and tempered with the strength that can be obtained only through problems on behalf of the state of Mississippi and with the blessing of our citizens both black and white. Yellow red and brown. Let me say to our sister states and to the rest of the world. Mississippi doesn't do race anymore. The 60s are over. This is 1996 and we want to be judged by our deeds here and now and not by what happened then and there.\n\nWe will acknowledge our history. But we will not let it determine our future. The only race that we're concerned with is the race for more jobs for better schools for safer neighborhoods and the race for lower taxes. Despite the adversities of 20th century life our people have not abandoned that which made them strong. We still have faith in God. We have not abandon our home towns and farms. And we still believe that those values which are best. Are those we learn from our families Mississippians like no other people. Are ready for the challenges of the future. We here in Mississippi have seen others stand before this podium and promised greatness. And all too many times we have been disappointed. That is as we gather here today.\n\nNot with me. But with you. Keep more of your tax dollars let you have the opportunity for a job. You control your child's school and let you control your own destiny. Ronald Reagan my hero. May have best summed up this government 20 years ago in 1976 when he said and I quote. I'm sure everyone feels sorry for the individual who can't keep up in our competitive society. But my compassion goes beyond that. To those millions of unsung men and women who get up every morning when the kids go to work. Try to keep up the payments on the house. Pay exorbitant taxes to make possible\n\ncompassion for the less fortunate. And as a result have to sacrifice many of their own desires dreams and hopes the government owes them something better than always finding a new way to make them share the fruit of their toils with others in the nation. There are many critics among us whose only vision for the new millennium is the one. There are fears some wring their hands and say there is less federal money to spend. Some tremble and ask what will we do without Uncle Sam to regulate us to the profits of doom and the naysayers and the critics say steady your nerves and check your cynicism at the door. I believe it to be no coincidence that wants what was once the poorest state in the union. Also is the one burdened with the most federal intervention for too long a distant capital has used our state as a social\n\nengineering project. It is time for that project in. Federal devolution will create tremendous opportunities for us we can build our own welfare system one that is more like a safety net and less like a hammock. We can maintain our clean air and our clean water without mountains of paper and regulations too complex to be understood by even the most specialized of lawyers. We can provide real job training not make work and poorly disguised government employment programs and we can do all this without building up billions and trillions of dollars of debt if we do these things. We will be in the new millennium. After I was elected four years ago many people told me that the best way to be successful in this was to get along. Four years later I'm amazed at how this advice is still given to me. I\n\nsuppose it is only human nature to want to be liked. However. That's not the job description for the job you have given me. It is not a job for the faint hearted and I need to be strong with me. I believe that I need to be tough as governor so that our children and our grandchildren won't have it so tough when they grow up in Mississippi. You may not always agree with me. You must admit that you never have to doubt where I stand on an issue. I will always shoot straight with you and I promise that I will never change in that regard. Four questions that I asked myself before any decision that I make as governor. Is it pleasing in the eyes of the Lord. Is it good for the people of Mississippi. How much will it cost. And how are we going to pay for it. It's no secret that like many of you I love the outdoors. I have a\n\nkeen appreciation for the balance that exists in nature and the roles of each of God's creatures. A Lion in the bush can be a very docile creature but wants his attention is aroused and switch flips in his head. He is hard to dissuade. He isn't always successful the first time. But he can be counted on. To persist. A lot for having a strong personality. He does what he knows best and there is a role for him on this earth created by God. My place is not in the middle of the road. I cannot go along just for the sake of getting along. On occasion I may have to swallow my pride but I cannot swallow my principles are. As a contractor.\n\nBuilding things of stone. But my greatest project in life has been this wonderful state. It is made of heart and hope. The greatest building materials known to man. You have a contractor work for you on this glorious project. And one more time and give it all of the blood sweat and tears that God has ever given one man. Four years from now. On January the year 2000. Yes in the new millennium we will meet here one last time on that. Sitting in one of the chairs right behind me now as a spectator just like you are many things on that. But most of all I hope and pray that as I look into the crowd be able to tell by the smiles on your face that we were successful in our mission that we stayed.\n\nTogether Forward and that has truly brought. In every one of you. God bless. God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Oh. Oh.\n\nThat's. What.\n\nYou. Do. And. Yet YOU. And you. Can and look. And again. And. Now. I mean. Now.\n\nBenediction would be given by Dr Samar's after which we would have the formal adjournment of the joint to stand. Let us first bless God for what God has lost our Lord give us light who gives us the beauty of this earth in which we live and who offers us the opportunity to live in such a land as this blessed start the Lord who gives us the opportunity for good work to be just as you are just who gives us the opportunity to person to supply with you in the work of your hands. And so with the knowledge of the blessing which you are taking us from this place to be your\n\nservice and your blessing continue to be seen upon the people who call upon Your name and who live by your word. The Lord bless you and keep. The Lord make His face to shine upon you and be gracious and the more to lift up his countenance applied and give you peace. The county. Dissolved.\n\nLike\n\nwhat. I can barely hear them. But. I can hear him. Hi John. I don't know Liz. There are lots of people hanging around here. One of the parcels. One of the. Public\n\nofficial says Tehran today is speaker of the house for. Thank you for joining us. We have a new foreign eyes has talked about and now the new millennium a new Mississippi What do you. We started off the gavel a time to gather myself as well as our respective bodies on a very good note very positive note. We feel like it's going to carry us into the next four years into the new millennium with a positive approach to government. How did what impact do you think we're going to have on the 96 legislative session feel like it's going to be very very good year we hope the whole four years are very good this year we don't have near as much money. Revenues are coming in as we have the last three years. Every now and then you need to have a leveling off period to see where you are. Next year we hope it's going to be better. Let me back up and say we have revenues are in very good shape. We just don't have the growth that we've experienced the last three years. Thank you. John Hill is back to you.\n\nYeah.\n\nSure. You. Mean. Good morning ladies and gentleman. I'm canceling car rolling and it\n\nisn't right for me to welcome you to the second inauguration of Daniel Kirkwood Fordyce Jr. as governor of the state of Mississippi.

Let the people praise the people praise the. Then shall the earth yield her increase and God even our own God shall bless us. God shall bless us. And all the ends of the earth shall fear him.\n\nAmen and Amen. Yeah.\n\nMississippi code section seven states that the governor\n\nand augur write it at 12 on the first Tuesday following the ascertaining of who is elected governor or as soon thereafter. As practicable as the noon hour approaches on this selected day. And keeping with this statutory mandate I called on Chief Justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court the honorable Diane Lee to administer the governor's Oh Chief Justice. Governor if you would come forward. Which of these repeat it to me. I thought I was doing you. I then your Kirkwood Fordyce during your home is where you solemnly swear that I will support the\n\nConstitution United States that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the state of Mississippi and the Constitution of the state of Mississippi and obey the laws there are. That I am not disqualified from holding the office of governor that I am not disqualified from holding the office of governor and that I will discharge the duties of the others and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office with him about which I am about to enter so help me God. Thank you very. Much. It was good.\n\nRight. That's it. So thank you. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you all. Thank you so much what I have a beautiful glorious day this is. Warmer than 1992 and. I stood on the steps of this capitol four years ago. Humbled by the challenge before us and heartened by your support and thankful for this opportunity for service given by God. To a 57 year old contractor from Vicksburg. I stand here today no less humble. Even more heartened. And\n\nsupremely full. I feel the weight of this momentous occasion. And I'm keenly aware that after the first four years of public service a governor is judged by the voters. But in the last four years he is judged by history. The challenge in 1992 was to move this ship of state together forward. The challenge now. Is to prepare for the years beyond 2000. I say today that with the new millennium. Will come a new Mississippi. We have moved Mississippi forward. Together we have accomplished much. Free enterprise and entrepreneurship are alive and well in the state of Mississippi. People are more prosperous. Our welfare recipients are enjoying their first taste of personal initiative and hope in decades. The future for Mississippi's children beckons brighter. Criminals are more\n\nfearful for their punishment is administered more swiftly and with more certainty. Together. We have introduced into the great marketplace of ideas. Efficiency and accountability in state government. Effectiveness in innovation in education and fiscal responsibility with a hard earned tax dollars of this at the center since four years ago all these have been revolutionary ideas but now they are the driving force behind the citizens to restore government of the people by the people and for the people. This is not been an administration it has been a crusade. The great political movement of which we are a part. Is in a sense a rediscovery of what originally made this country great as we\n\nanticipate the 21st century. What was a radical idea in the latter part of the 18th century is unfortunately still an extreme concept to many. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence we hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their create. By their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among those are life liberty. And the pursuit of happiness. And then he went on to write that the only powers a government can morally exercise are those given with the consent of the governed. Mississippi has a unique opportunity to succeed in the next millenium. Not only because of the success that our state has enjoyed in the last four years but also because of our shared experiences of the entire 20th century.\n\nExperience is a great teacher. Mississippi like no other state has experienced and faced the problems and challenges of the last 100 years. It has been said that character is forged in the crucible of adversity. Our mettle has been forged in the same bar. We have a hard shining and tempered with the strength that can be obtained only through problems on behalf of the state of Mississippi and with the blessing of our citizens both black and white. Yellow red and brown. Let me say to our sister states and to the rest of the world. Mississippi doesn't do race anymore. The 60s are over. This is 1996 and we want to be judged by our deeds here and now and not by what happened then and there.\n\nWe will acknowledge our history. But we will not let it determine our future. The only race that we're concerned with is the race for more jobs for better schools for safer neighborhoods and the race for lower taxes. Despite the adversities of 20th century life our people have not abandoned that which made them strong. We still have faith in God. We have not abandon our home towns and farms. And we still believe that those values which are best. Are those we learn from our families Mississippians like no other people. Are ready for the challenges of the future. We here in Mississippi have seen others stand before this podium and promised greatness. And all too many times we have been disappointed. That is as we gather here today.\n\nNot with me. But with you. Keep more of your tax dollars let you have the opportunity for a job. You control your child's school and let you control your own destiny. Ronald Reagan my hero. May have best summed up this government 20 years ago in 1976 when he said and I quote. I'm sure everyone feels sorry for the individual who can't keep up in our competitive society. But my compassion goes beyond that. To those millions of unsung men and women who get up every morning when the kids go to work. Try to keep up the payments on the house. Pay exorbitant taxes to make possible\n\ncompassion for the less fortunate. And as a result have to sacrifice many of their own desires dreams and hopes the government owes them something better than always finding a new way to make them share the fruit of their toils with others in the nation. There are many critics among us whose only vision for the new millennium is the one. There are fears some wring their hands and say there is less federal money to spend. Some tremble and ask what will we do without Uncle Sam to regulate us to the profits of doom and the naysayers and the critics say steady your nerves and check your cynicism at the door. I believe it to be no coincidence that wants what was once the poorest state in the union. Also is the one burdened with the most federal intervention for too long a distant capital has used our state as a social\n\nengineering project. It is time for that project in. Federal devolution will create tremendous opportunities for us we can build our own welfare system one that is more like a safety net and less like a hammock. We can maintain our clean air and our clean water without mountains of paper and regulations too complex to be understood by even the most specialized of lawyers. We can provide real job training not make work and poorly disguised government employment programs and we can do all this without building up billions and trillions of dollars of debt if we do these things. We will be in the new millennium. After I was elected four years ago many people told me that the best way to be successful in this was to get along. Four years later I'm amazed at how this advice is still given to me. I\n\nsuppose it is only human nature to want to be liked. However. That's not the job description for the job you have given me. It is not a job for the faint hearted and I need to be strong with me. I believe that I need to be tough as governor so that our children and our grandchildren won't have it so tough when they grow up in Mississippi. You may not always agree with me. You must admit that you never have to doubt where I stand on an issue. I will always shoot straight with you and I promise that I will never change in that regard. Four questions that I asked myself before any decision that I make as governor. Is it pleasing in the eyes of the Lord. Is it good for the people of Mississippi. How much will it cost. And how are we going to pay for it. It's no secret that like many of you I love the outdoors. I have a\n\nkeen appreciation for the balance that exists in nature and the roles of each of God's creatures. A Lion in the bush can be a very docile creature but wants his attention is aroused and switch flips in his head. He is hard to dissuade. He isn't always successful the first time. But he can be counted on. To persist. A lot for having a strong personality. He does what he knows best and there is a role for him on this earth created by God. My place is not in the middle of the road. I cannot go along just for the sake of getting along. On occasion I may have to swallow my pride but I cannot swallow my principles are. As a contractor.\n\nBuilding things of stone. But my greatest project in life has been this wonderful state. It is made of heart and hope. The greatest building materials known to man. You have a contractor work for you on this glorious project. And one more time and give it all of the blood sweat and tears that God has ever given one man. Four years from now. On January the year 2000. Yes in the new millennium we will meet here one last time on that. Sitting in one of the chairs right behind me now as a spectator just like you are many things on that. But most of all I hope and pray that as I look into the crowd be able to tell by the smiles on your face that we were successful in our mission that we stayed.\n\nTogether Forward and that has truly brought. In every one of you. God bless. God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Oh. Oh.\n\nThat's. What.\n\nYou. Do. And. Yet YOU. And you. Can and look. And again. And. Now. I mean. Now.\n\nBenediction would be given by Dr Samar's after which we would have the formal adjournment of the joint to stand. Let us first bless God for what God has lost our Lord give us light who gives us the beauty of this earth in which we live and who offers us the opportunity to live in such a land as this blessed start the Lord who gives us the opportunity for good work to be just as you are just who gives us the opportunity to person to supply with you in the work of your hands. And so with the knowledge of the blessing which you are taking us from this place to be your\n\nservice and your blessing continue to be seen upon the people who call upon Your name and who live by your word. The Lord bless you and keep. The Lord make His face to shine upon you and be gracious and the more to lift up his countenance applied and give you peace. The county. Dissolved.\n\nLike\n\nwhat. I can barely hear them. But. I can hear him. Hi John. I don't know Liz. There are lots of people hanging around here. One of the parcels. One of the. Public\n\nofficial says Tehran today is speaker of the house for. Thank you for joining us. We have a new foreign eyes has talked about and now the new millennium a new Mississippi What do you. We started off the gavel a time to gather myself as well as our respective bodies on a very good note very positive note. We feel like it's going to carry us into the next four years into the new millennium with a positive approach to government. How did what impact do you think we're going to have on the 96 legislative session feel like it's going to be very very good year we hope the whole four years are very good this year we don't have near as much money. Revenues are coming in as we have the last three years. Every now and then you need to have a leveling off period to see where you are. Next year we hope it's going to be better. Let me back up and say we have revenues are in very good shape. We just don't have the growth that we've experienced the last three years. Thank you. John Hill is back to you.\n\nYeah."
