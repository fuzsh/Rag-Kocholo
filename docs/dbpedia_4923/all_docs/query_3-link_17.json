        "text": "Chairman of Democratic National Committee\n\nBy B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.\n\nore than 740,000 people went to the polls in Mississippi on Tuesday to choose a new governor. But it appears the race will be decided by the 122 members of the state's House of Representatives.\n\nThat is because neither candidate ended up with more than half the vote, barring a recount or absentee ballots tipping the balance over the next several days. And, under Mississippi law, such outcomes are decided by the House.\n\nDemocrats outnumber Republicans 2 to 1 in the state House. So if the decision is left to that body, in all likelihood the next governor of Mississippi will be the Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove.\n\nWith 100 percent of precincts reporting, Musgrove had 49.5 percent of the vote; his Republican opponent, Mike Parker, a former Congressman, had 48.6 percent, and the rest was split between two little-known candidates.\n\n\"This is the state's closest governor's race, certainly in the 20th century, and I think forever,\" said Eric Clark, the Mississippi secretary of state.\n\nOne reason the race was so close was that the two candidates held almost identical views on the issues, especially on how to improve Mississippi's schools and economy. Both also played up family values, a hot issue in a conservative, Bible Belt state whose incumbent governor, Kirk Fordice, has had very public marital problems.\n\nUnder Mississippi law, a winning candidate for a state office must have 50 percent of the vote, plus one more vote. Until now, there has never been any reason to resort to the law to decide a governor's contest.\n\nShould Musgrove end up the winner, his victory will do more than return control of the office to the Democrats after eight years in Republicans hands, the only period of Republican control in the past 125 years. A Musgrove victory would also be a significant addition to an already impressive string of victories around the country by Democrats in Tuesday's off-year balloting.\n\nRepublicans had some signal victories too, most notably capturing control of the Virginia Legislature for the first time. But the Democrats had the most victories, though not enough, in the opinion of many political analysts, to draw any reliable indication about what might be in store for the major parties in 2000 elections.\n\nDemocrats took over the mayors' offices in Indianapolis and in Columbus, Ohio, putting together inner city multiracial coalitions to end almost 30 years of Republican control in each city. Democrats also narrowly beat back a determined Republican challenge in the mayor's race in Philadelphia and they easily brushed aside Republican efforts to capture the mayors' offices in Baltimore and Houston.\n\nFurther, the Democratic incumbent in the Kentucky governor's race, Paul Patton, readily won re-election.\n\nPresident Clinton called Tuesday's results a big win for his party and characterized the Mississippi race as \"truly historic.\"\n\nJoe Andrew, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, proclaimed that \"the Democratic Party is on the move\" and saw the victories in Indianapolis and Columbus as encouraging demonstrations of resurging Democratic strength in urban America, especially in the industrial Midwest, which could be a major battleground in Election 2000.\n\nJim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, chose to focus on his party's win in Virginia, calling it \"a bellwether for all the elections which are going to be held all over America next year.\" He also found victory in the narrow Republican defeat in heavily Democratic Philadelphia.\n\nMore dispassionate observers of national politics tended to take less definitive views of Tuesday's results.\n\nSteven Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said, \"You really can't make an awful lot out of an election like this.\"\n\nAnd Earl Black, a political scientist at Rice University, said that \"no party goes into 2000 with a clear, comprehensive national victory from these off-year elections\" because of their \"obviously mixed results.\"\n\nBoth national parties poured big money into the Virginia and Mississippi contests.\n\nAt issue in Virginia, from a national standpoint, was which party would be in control of the legislature in 2001, when Congressional district lines will be redrawn around the country. That process could ultimately help determine which party controls Congress.\n\nAt issue in Mississippi, from a national standpoint, was whether Democrats could keep a victory roll going in Deep South governors' races, having stemmed a long Republican roll by winning last year in Alabama and South Carolina.\n\nBut outside help in the Mississippi race was not limited to outside money. In the case of the Democrats, the Rev. Jesse Jackson also provided some help, bringing in volunteers to help register black voters in the Delta, a region that reported a particularly heavy turnout on Tuesday.\n\nThe black vote also played an important role in the mayor's elections in Indianapolis, Columbus and Philadelphia. In Indianapolis and Columbus, where black voting power has expanded as more and more whites have moved to the suburbs, blacks teamed with working-class whites and gave the Democratic Party the edge it had previously lacked to take over the mayor's office.\n\nIn Philadelphia, many black voters took the politically rare step of going over to the Republican side, drawn by a candidate willing to address their issues. In the end, however, not quite enough jumped across to provide a victory, especially after worried Democratic leaders persuaded President Clinton to come in for a rally.\n\n\"What Tuesday's voting in Mississippi and the Midwest and elsewhere ultimately tells us,\" said Jackson, \"is that blacks and whites increasingly are voting shared economic interests and not just racial issues. That's an important new pattern.\""
