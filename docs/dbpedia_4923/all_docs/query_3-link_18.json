        "text": "MISSISSIPPI LEGISLATURE\n\n2011 Regular Session\n\nTo: Rules\n\nBy: Senator(s) Davis, Hewes\n\nSenate Resolution 30\n\nA RESOLUTION TO COMMEND GOVERNOR HALEY BARBOUR FOR HIS DISTINGUISHED SERVICE TO THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI.\n\nWHEREAS, known for strong integrity and leadership, Governor Haley Barbour is the 63rd Governor of the State of Mississippi and is completing his second term of office. He has been suggested as a strong candidate for the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States; and\n\nWHEREAS, Governor Barbour defeated incumbent Democrat Ronnie Musgrove in the General Election on November 4, 2003, with 53% of the vote to Musgrove's 46%. Barbour became the second Republican Governor elected in Mississippi since Reconstruction, the first being Kirk Fordice. He took office in January 2004 and announced the beginning of his reelection campaign at a series of meetings across the state on February 12, 2007; and\n\nWHEREAS, Governor Barbour made attracting high-skilled, high-paying jobs utilizing advanced materials a priority of his administration. World-class corporations have located facilities in the state providing top-notch jobs requiring advanced skills. PACCAR, Severstal, GE Aviation, Northrop Grumman and Nissan have major production facilities in Mississippi. Even clean-energy companies are calling Mississippi home, including solar panel manufacturer Twin Creeks Technologies and biofuel maker KiOR, Inc. Toyota Motor Company is scheduled to open their latest North American plant near Tupelo in 2011; and\n\nWHEREAS, on Monday, August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina slammed into Mississippi's Coast, killing 231 people, devastating the state's $2.7 Billion-a-year casino industry and leaving tens of thousands of its residents temporarily homeless. Barbour's response was characterized by a concerted effort at evacuation, tough-minded talk on looters and an unwillingness to blame the federal government. His response included a Special Session of the Legislature to facilitate the rebuilding effort. Barbour credited the countless government workers who helped Southern Mississippi cope with the hurricane. Barbour was praised by the Coast's citizens as a strong leader who can communicate calm to the public. Governor Barbour was blunt with the facts about the utter devastation of the Coast, but his own demeanor in public appearances suggested that the state would summon the will to rebuild. Mississippi reopened all of its public schools by November 2005; and\n\nWHEREAS, Governor Barbour translated his lobbying skills into success at winning over a Legislature dominated by Democrats. He vowed not to institute any new taxes or raise any existing ones. He called several Special Sessions to focus on issues. Among his most meaningful policy changes was including a tort reform measure in a Special Session that has been hailed as one of the strictest in the nation. Barbour rarely made a speech during his gubernatorial campaign without mentioning this subject and was able to convert political support into law; and\n\nWHEREAS, before being elected Governor, Barbour had a long career on the national stage and has been well-known as a Republican operative since the Reagan years. He worked as a lawyer and lobbyist, was a candidate for the U.S. Senate and also served as Chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1993 to 1997, during which time the Republicans captured both the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives for the first time since 1954. On June 24, 2009, Barbour was elected Chairman of the Republican Governors Association; and\n\nWHEREAS, Barbour, the youngest of three sons, was born in Yazoo City, Mississippi, where he was raised. At the age of 22, he ran the 1970 Census for the State of Mississippi. He enrolled at the University of Mississippi Law School, receiving a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1972. Subsequently, he joined his father's law firm in Yazoo City; and\n\nWHEREAS, after Governor Barbour renewed calls for a Civil Rights Museum early this year, state lawmakers approved a bill authorizing the multimillion-dollar construction of two new Mississippi museums - one devoted to the Civil Rights struggle and another focused on the state's overall history. \"The Civil Rights Museum and the Museum of Mississippi History will serve as outstanding projects to teach the lessons of our past and honor those who shaped our great state. Both will be positive for our state's image,\" Barbour said; and\n\nWHEREAS, Governor Barbour was named 2006 Governor of the Year by Washington, D.C.-based Governing magazine, awarded the Gulf Guardian Award by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for his work to rebuild and protect sensitive Coast ecosystems, and received the 2008 Adam Smith Medal from BIPAC for his pursuit of the principles of free enterprise in June 2009. Haley and his wife, Marsha, have two sons and a grandson; and\n\nWHEREAS, Governor Barbour's service has been marked by his commitment to success and recognized leadership, sound judgment and fairness. He has set the highest standard in all of his many roles, as a father, husband, citizen, statesman and leader in the State of Mississippi and as a true friend:\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI, That we do hereby commend and recognize Governor Haley Barbour, whose outstanding service as Governor enriched everyone in the State of Mississippi, and we wish Haley and his family much success in their future endeavors.\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That this resolution be presented to Governor Barbour, and made available to the Capitol Press Corps."
