David Ronald "Ronnie" Musgrove (born July 29, 1956) is an American politician who was the Democratic Lieutenant Governor from 1996 to 2000 and the Governor from 2000 to 2004 of the U.S. state of Mississippi. He was recently defeated by incumbent Senator Roger Wicker for one of Mississippi's seats in the U.S. Senate.

Musgrove was born in Tocowa, Mississippi. He grew up in the nearby city of Batesville. When Musgrove was seven years old, his father, a road crew worker with the Mississippi Highway Department, caught pneumonia while laboring during a record snowstorm and died. His mother worked at a Fruit of the Loom factory, tended a half-acre garden and raised him and his four siblings by herself.

He is a graduate of Northwest Mississippi Community College, the University of Mississippi, and the University of Mississippi School of Law. It was at Ole Miss Law School that Musgrove became friends with fellow law student, future Mississippi House of Representatives member and future author John Grisham. Grisham would later campaign for Musgrove in each of his races for Lt. Governor, Governor and U.S. Senate.
