        "text": "I’ve been wondering…\n\nI have a bad habit of publishing as I go; not waiting until I have finished a story before I start uploading the chapters for the general public. It’s because I doubt myself, and frankly, I’m seeking validation from my readers.\n\nThe problem is, people are very quick to tell me how they think the story might end, or how they want the story to end, and on a few previous occasions, I’ve completely altered the ending or even added an entirely new sub-plot just to make sure I’m giving the readers what they want.\n\nBut then I always publish with a slight sense of insincerity, because I prioritised positive feedback over my vision of how the story would end.\n\nSo that’s what I’ve been wondering: should an author always get what they want?\n\nWe’ve all heard the old saying, “kill your darlings”; take your favourite parts of your story, be it metaphors, characters, or descriptions, and just beat them to death with a rusty pipe, because if you like them, you’re too attached, you can’t be objective about what your story needs.\n\nBut does an author have to be objective? After all, you know your own story better than anyone else, and what you actually put down on paper is just the tip of an iceberg that extends vastly and intricately under the surface of your mind-sea. Maybe the reason for putting something in your story is simply because you want to, and you feel it’s right.\n\nThat got me thinking about ownership. Perhaps the story doesn’t even truly belong to you. Perhaps it should belong to the readers. I believe that once you publish something, it doesn’t belong to you anymore. Not in the copyright sense, obviously, but it could be argued that your intentions for a story become redundant as soon as you release it into the world, because it is the reader’s interpretation that becomes the relevant one.\n\nAuthors are often seen as having the final word on their own stories, but I think speculation over the characters’ pasts is half the fun, and unless it is implicitly written on the page, it’s anyone’s game; anyone can decide where the characters have been.\n\nNow, imagine (as I often do) that I have written a best-selling novel. There are three characters, John, Mark, and Anna. None of them have any implicit romantic attachment in the novel, but in an interview I inform my adoring public that John and Mark were secret lovers. Does that make it canon? Does that make it true just because I said so? What if a reader decided that, actually, Mark and Anna make a better couple, and one day, long after the end of the novel, they’ll get together and have lots of lovely babies. Is that reader wrong? Is their opinion somehow less valid than mine?\n\nDoes the author have authority over their story after it has been released to the public? I don’t think so.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I never imagined Dumbledore was gay, but once J.K. Rowling announced that he was, I’ve always seen him as such.\n\nActually let me rephrase: once J.K. Rowling announced that she saw Dumbledore as gay. Nowhere in the seven books does it say that Professor Albus Dumbledore likes the fellas. So, really, hers is just one of many, equally valid interpretations, right?\n\nI wrote a post about fan fiction a couple of years ago, defending it as a valid form of writing, and an excellent place to hone your skills as a writer. But this time I want to address the fandoms themselves; the people who write the fan fiction. The fandom that surrounds a film, TV show, or novel is often much larger, much more detailed, and more intricate than its origin. Single words or solitary meaningful glances in an episode are extrapolated into 60,000 word epics, and while the plots and events depicted in fan fiction rarely come to pass in the “real” show, I don’t think anyone has the right to tell them they are wrong.\n\nSo no, I don’t think writers should have the final say when it comes to their work. It’s selfish, and it’s so very restrictive. Why would you settle for one point of view when you can have a thousand?\n\nThere are writers who are centuries dead whose works are being interpreted constantly, and in new and modern contexts. Their work doesn’t belong to them anymore, it belongs to the world to interpret as they please, in any context they please, contexts that would have been far beyond the original author’s wildest imagination. The themes, the metaphors, the carefully crafted imagery in these novels take on a new significance to every new reader, in every country and decade.\n\nWriting is limitless. And I think that’s pretty amazing.\n\n“While it is impossible to make a competent writer out of a bad writer, and while it is equally impossible to make a great writer out of a good one, it is possible, with lots of hard work, dedication, and timely help, to make a good writer out of a merely competent one.” – Stephen King, On Writing.\n\nUhh… sorry?\n\nThat’s all fine and dandy if you already consider yourself a great writer, but if not, that’s pretty soul-destroying. I have the potential to improve, everyone does, and I don’t much like being told my limits by a total stranger.\n\nStephen King is a great writer, but I can almost guarantee that he has improved tenfold since the very first time he put pen to paper. I hold him in very high regard, and he has inspired me to write on many occasions, which is perhaps why this particular quote bothers me so much. How can someone so inspirational to writers also be the one telling them that they are limited before they even begin?\n\nPerhaps he’s just speaking the harsh truth and I, in all my naïve, blindly optimistic glory don’t want to accept it. After all, he’s got sixty novels and forty years on me. And I can’t really go any further without admitting that the rest of his book On Writing is brilliant and full of great advice for writers, I’d thoroughly recommend it to anyone, aspiring writer or otherwise. Except for that one sentence.\n\nThe thing is, I don’t think in transcendent imagery and if I were to come up with a genuinely beautiful metaphor it would likely be the highlight of my year. So maybe that kind of literary insight will never come to me.\n\nHaving said that, I would consider myself a competent writer, and according to Stephen King that means I have the potential to be good. Oh boy, thanks Stephen. But what if I want to be great? Why the hell can’t I be great?\n\nI’d say about ninety percent of writers start writing because they realise they already have an affinity for it, but occasionally some brave souls will start writing knowing that they just plain suck. And that’s okay. Everyone starts somewhere, maybe from scratch or maybe from a few steps ahead, spurred on by a spark of natural talent, but that shouldn’t dictate how far each person can go.\n\nI have to have the confidence that I can be great, with or without an innate ability to infuse my every syllable with sixteen layers of significance.\n\nBut I’m not great. Yet.\n\nThat’s the operative word. Yet.\n\nDon’t let anybody, world-renowned author or otherwise, tell you that you can’t succeed because you didn’t start from the right level.\n\nBut Mr King is right about one thing, it takes hard work and dedication to improve your writing, but anyone can do it. We are all capable of greatness.\n\nI just have a long way to go.\n\nThis might be an unpopular opinion, and I’m not playing devil’s advocate here, and I’m also not an angst-fuelled tween desperately trying to vocalise my confusing sexy feelings, but hear me out when I say someone needs to stand up for fan fiction.\n\nIt got some media attention a few years ago with the revelation that Fifty Shades of Grey started its strange little life as a story based on Twilight. They say all press is good press, but fan fiction already had a reputation as a breeding ground for badly written, angst-ridden stories of stolen glances and aching loins, and Fifty Shades didn’t help correct that misconception.\n\nBefore I go on, just in case anyone isn’t familiar with the notion of fan fiction, you take established characters from existing works of fiction (books, movies, TV shows), you write stories about them, and you publish them online. Simple as that. It’s a great way of exercising your writing skills, playing with different types of characters, and entertaining a few hundred people while you’re at it.\n\nIt’s also a pretty great sounding-board for new writing styles and plot-lines that you can easily transfer back in to your own original writing.\n\nUsing popular characters guarantees readership – sometimes an audience of thousands – and it almost always guarantees feedback, which, good or bad, is invaluable. Any feedback is always exciting, but it’s even better when it’s from people who enthuse over the same books and shows as you do, and I make no apologies for completely and shamelessly loving something. I take inspiration and happiness wherever I can find it.\n\nI’ll admit it, a lot of the writing on fan fiction sites is bad. But I challenge you to look back on some of the first things you ever wrote and see if they don’t require a bit of work. A lot of these writers are just babies, they need encouragement, and they look to likeminded people to find it.\n\nThe world of fan fiction is a wonderful place where young writers can experiment and seasoned writers can entertain. So if you have the patience to wade through adverb- and simile-laden stories filled with eyes like blue orbs, and breaths catching in people’s throats, you might be surprised by what you find. But if you don’t happen to find anything you like, you can always take a few seconds to pass on some constructive criticism, because your words can help a novice writer find the skill and the confidence to pursue their passion.\n\nFan fiction shaped me in to the writer that I am today, still not a very good one, but a hell of a lot better than I was ten years ago."
