It is by far the best treatment of the topic. \" — Allen Buchanan, author of Justice, Legitimacy, and Self-Determination: Moral Foundations for International Law\n\n\"This is a controversial work and while I don't agree with its main positive conclusion, there is no denying that Steinhoff demolishes many of the influential arguments of those who believe that torture can never be justified. For this reason alone, the book warrants attention. \" — Seumas Miller, author of Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism: Ethics and Liberal Democracy"
