Please familiarise yourselves with the checklists in the link provided before submitting the paper.\n\nPlease also see the guidelines for submitting your article on our online submission platform here.\n\nFurther information:\n\nSelection of manuscripts will, amongst other things, be on the basis of the subject being worthy of investigation, as well as on the suitability and soundness of the research methodology and the soundness of the conclusions. Additionally, priority will be given to articles that provide original knowledge and information, particularly those with comparative and interesting or new perspectives. Articles categorised as clinical trials, research methodology papers, data based population examinations, critical or explaining case descriptions may in some incidences be preferred.\n\nThe Torture Journal welcomes all submissions, and has a wish to promote submissions particularly from low and middle income countries. Where possible and if necessary, we will assist those working for the rehabilitation of torture survivors and the prevention of torture to make their submissions more publishable, especially those from non-English native speaking countries. (Please note, however, that publication of scientific articles cannot be guaranteed due to the integrity of the double-blind peer review system).\n\nThe Torture Journal will endeavour to provide succinct, relevant and timely feedback to authors on a manuscript, even when it is rejected. The editors reserve the right to reject a manuscript at any time up to publication.\n\nResearch and Scientific articles\n\nResearch and scientific articles include an abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion.\n\nReview articles\n\nReview articles provide a critical survey and examination of the literature of a particular subject of research which generally consist of Abstract, Introduction (including explanations of conflicts in the literature, and analysis of the field), Methods, Results, Conclusions and Outlook (including limitations of current knowledge and future directions to be pursued in research).\n\nCase reports\n\nThe Torture Journal welcomes the submission of case reports with respect to unusual cases for any specific reason (either social, nosological, clinical or therapeutic).\n\nPerspectives\n\nA personal view or reflection in a clear narrative voice can also be submitted to the journal. It is intended that this section can add a more qualitative perspective to other scientific articles. Perspectives from torture survivors or field workers are particularly encouraged.\n\nResearch news\n\nPlease let us know at publications@irct.org if there is something you believe is newsworthy for the Torture Journal.
