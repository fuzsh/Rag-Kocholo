The characters in Death by a Thousand Cuts seek connection while facing longing, fear, rage, and the impossible expectations placed on women. With bracing honesty and a skewering wit, these stories boldly wrestle with themes of illness, pain, desire, bodily autonomy, and their inescapable impacts on a woman's relationships with others and with herself.",
