        "text": "Swift dropped her 11th studio album on Friday, April 19\n\nTaylor Swift is looking ahead to her future after the release of her new record.\n\nOn Friday, April 19, the pop megastar, 34, shared an Instagram post celebrating the release of her 11th studio album The Tortured Poets Department.\n\n\"The Tortured Poets Department. An anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time - one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure. This period of the author’s life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up,\" she wrote.\n\n\"There is nothing to avenge, no scores to settle once wounds have healed. And upon further reflection, a good number of them turned out to be self-inflicted. This writer is of the firm belief that our tears become holy in the form of ink on a page. Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it. And then all that’s left behind is the tortured poetry.\"\n\nRelated: Taylor Swift Announces 'Fortnight' Featuring Post Malone Is First Tortured Poets Single: 'Can't Wait for You Guys to Hear'\n\nOn Thursday, April 18, Swift announced on Instagram that the lead single of The Tortured Poets Department would be \"Fortnight,\" which features Post Malone.\n\n“I’ve been such a huge fan of Post because of the writer he is, his musical experimentation and those melodies he creates that just stick in your head forever,” she wrote alongside a black and white image of her and Malone. “I got to witness that magic come to life firsthand when we worked together on Fortnight.”\n\nSwift also announced that the duo would be releasing a music video for \"Fortnight\" at 8 p.m. ET on Friday, April 19, the same day of the album’s release.\n\n\"Honestly can’t wait for you guys to hear this song at Midnight TONIGHT and see the video at 8pm ET TOMORROW,\" the \"Maroon\" artist wrote.\n\n“Fortnight” is the opening track on Tortured Poets, and only one of two songs to feature another artist; “Florida!!!” features Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine.\n\nIn February, Swift announced the album during her acceptance speech for best pop vocal album at the Grammy Awards.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nRelated: Taylor Swift Gives a First Look Inside 'The Tortured Poets Department' and Teases Timetable of Release Schedule\n\nThe 14-time Grammy winner also recently teased that heartbreak would be a major theme of the LP, sharing five exclusive playlists with Apple Music and sharing some snippets of lyrics.\n\nIn the lead-up to the release of Swift's album, Spotify hosted a pop-up exhibit in Los Angeles where Swifties could explore a library-themed room filled with subtle clues about the record, featuring new lyrics and imagery that hinted at possible themes within the music.\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department was written with Swift’s frequent collaborators Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, and Post Malone is listed as a co-writer on “Fortnight.”\n\nRead PEOPLE\"s review of The Tortured Poets Department and dive deeper into the album's deeply personal lyrics, call-outs and more.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
