        "text": "A problematic situation that will gradually increase in severity until it reaches calamitous proportions, such that the people involved or affected by it will not notice the danger until it is too late to act.\n\nIt is a metaphor taken from an anecdotal parable about boiling a frog, in which a frog placed in boiling water will immediately try to save itself, but one placed in cool water that is gradually brought to a boil will not notice the heat until it is boiled to death.\n\n\"Drug addiction is often a boiling frog, as many people don't see their addiction as problematic until it has consumed their lives.\"\n\nto reduce the amount of, as if by whittling;\n\npare down;\n\ntake away by degrees (usually followed by down, away, etc.)\n\nto whittle down the company's overhead; to whittle away one's inheritance.\n\ncarve (wood) into an object by repeatedly cutting small slices from it. synonyms: pare, shave, trim, carve, shape, model\n\n\"he sat whittling a piece of wood\"\n\ncarve (an object) from wood by repeatedly cutting small slices from it. reduce something in size, amount, or extent by a gradual series of steps.\n\n\"the short list of fifteen was whittled down to five\"\n\nsynonyms: erode, wear away, eat away, reduce, diminish, undermine, weaken, subvert, compromise, impair, impede, hinder, cripple, disable, enfeeble, sap\n\n\"his powers were whittled away\"\n\nreduce, cut down, cut back, prune, trim, slim down, pare down, shrink, decrease, diminish\n\n\"the ten teams have been whittled down to six\"\n\nthe straw that broke the camel's back\n\nThe final limit of capacity, including patience.\n\nAn Arabian anecdote told of a camel whose owner loaded the beast of burden with as much straw as possible. Not satisfied with the staggering load he had put on the camel, the owner added just one last piece of straw. Even that one wisp was too much, and the animal collapsed with a broken back, leaving the owner with no way to take his goods to the market. The story is a parable for all the times you've been repeatedly irked until you can't take it anymore and you explode."
