        "text": "#1 by MasterOfDisillusionment\n\nOkay, so the title is tongue in cheek. Not sure if most writers actually like writing torture scenes but whatever. Still, this is a legit subject matter.\n\nSo, what's your opinion on torture scenes? Obviously, they have to exist for a reason but that goes for everything in your writing anyway. There isn't much point in debating that. Everybody will agree that pointless violence that doesn't serve any story purposes is not good writing. But what is more open for debate is how much detail to go into when writing the torture.\n\nFeel free to call me a psychopath, but I was legitimately surprised when I first heard that some readers find torture scenes uncomfortable or hard to read. I get it they would feel that way if they were watching a movie or show where you can actually see what is happening, but if it's just written text I don't see what the big deal is. Again, it still has to be there for a reason. It can't just be an edgy gorefest for its own sake (unless you're writing some kind of torture fantasy I guess).\n\nHere's my opinion on this: The same writing principles apply to torture scenes as any other scene where the character experiences strong emotions. That means you should actually go into the disgusting details. The reason? It makes you experience the character's pain more. Some readers may find that uncomfortable, but I would argue that is actually the point. You are feeling the character's pain because you actually get a better idea of what they are going through. If the torture scene is just sort of glanced over and things don't go into the details, it just won't have the same emotional impact. Also, note that more detailed descriptions don't have to relate to the actual gore/violence but rather it can also be things like the character's personal thoughts while he/she's being tortured.\n\nOr maybe I'm just a sicko who enjoys tormenting his characters I dunno :/\n\nReport this post\n\nRep (4)\n\nRe: Let's talk about torture and how fun it is to write!\n\n#2 by Armon\n\nNo soy muy fanático de las escenas de tortura pero ni de lejos las odio, solo que me aburre la típica tortura de romper dedos o los mil cortes y demás, me gusta mucho formas de torturas novedosas y que se note que es muy doloroso para el.

I feel like the line between just right for discomfort and seeing somebody's wildest torture fantasies played out is pretty thin. If it adds to the story, it can stay, but if it doesn't or does not add enough, away it goes.\n\nAs for disgusting details, I think that is also up to the author. I could give more details in some scenes that would be more uncomfortable, but I chose not to, mainly because I think they aren#t needed to make the scene better.\n\nReport this post\n\nRep (2)\n\nRe: Let's talk about torture and how fun it is to write!\n\n#5 by Cynical Stranger\n\nPersonally, I don't think you should hold back if you choose to show the torture scene. Torture is, well torture. It should be uncomfortable and even painful to read, that way you are connected to the pain of the character.

It should be pretty self explanatory, not everyone wants to read graphic torture just like not everyone wants to read explicit sex. (or literally any topic or genre for that matter)\n\nIf you're trying to write for a large audience, \"uncomfortable\" to read makes a lot of people drop the story. It's not even about whether they can \"handle it or not\" like CynicalStranger said... It actually has to do with whether the story is enjoyable. Uncomfortable = not enjoyable most of the time.\n\nThere's certainly an audience for dark fiction, but it has much smaller market potential. A LOT smaller than erotica.\n\nIf you want a lot of people to read your story, handle the torture scenes delicately....\n\nReport this post\n\nRep (1)\n\nRe: Let's talk about torture and how fun it is to write!\n\n#12 by C Owens-Walsh\n\nCynical Stranger Wrote:\n\nArmon Wrote: No soy muy fanático de las escenas de tortura pero ni de lejos las odio, solo que me aburre la típica tortura de romper dedos o los mil cortes y demás, me gusta mucho formas de torturas novedosas y que se note que es muy doloroso para el.

Like, crazy alchemical shit. Otherwise much like with rape scenes I prefer a fade to black/off-screen with maybe some sound effects or screams. I've experienced some really horrible shit directly or indirectly, so nothing some rando web serial author comes up with is likely to interest or impress me. And of course there are people with PTSD who might otherwise enjoy a story, but have to put it down because of pointless torture scenes.\n\nReport this post\n\nRep (0)\n\nRe: Let's talk about torture and how fun it is to write!\n\n#14 by Paradoxcloud\n\nMost of the fight scenes that I’ve written are basically torture scenes.\n\nMan gets head smashed into the pavement while fighting, great applause.\n\nMan gets head smashed in while bound to a chair, no applause.\n\nI think the main problem is that few people are interested in seeing someone get tortured, not because they’re uncomfortable per say, but because it’s not something that they’re used to seeing. Same goes for other forms of suffering, I don’t imagine most people would want a detailed description of how a one of punch to the jaw ‘caused a rando non-player character permanent brain damage when the MC still needs to beat the demon king and expand his harem.\n\nIn the same vain, realism in general is not always a liked aspect, political games, disease, weather, etc are all things that can affect you in your day to day life, in stories however these things mostly evaporate into thin air, usually, but not always, to the benefit of the reader.\n\nReport this post\n\nRep (4)\n\nRe: Let's talk about torture and how fun it is to write!\n\n#15 by Temple\n\nSpeaking on the web novel writing side (since we're here on RR after all), web novel readers usually prefer relaxing reads. That's why OP MC is so popular. You might think that it sucks in a literary sense because it doesn't have stakes, etc., but that's kind of the point. Web novel readers usually want to relax and enjoy, which is why there are a lot of readers who actively avoid the tragedy tag. If just on writing violence, then I agree with this.\n\nParadoxcloud Wrote: Man gets head smashed into the pavement while fighting, great applause.\n\nMan gets head smashed in while bound to a chair, no applause.\n\nLike I have a chapter where one of the characters got swallowed by a monster, and it goes into detail as she was getting digested (she's a superhuman so it took some time and she got saved, but already partially digested though). Many readers enjoyed that chapter. However, if I wrote that scene as someone getting tortured with acid for example, I'm sure a lot of readers would get turned off by it. So, it's really the scenario I suppose, whether it be nitty-gritty details, flashes, or fade-to-black, torture is just a touchy subject to write. And it's really not tied to the violence but to the emotional impact. I do like writing very violent scenes though, but not torture because I don't think I'm skilled enough to make it impactful rather than being gratuitous violence.\n\nReport this post\n\nRep (0)\n\nRe: Let's talk about torture and how fun it is to write!\n\n#16 by L M Stephens\n\nMmmm...\n\nTo be honest, I'm more so into mental torture than physical torture.
