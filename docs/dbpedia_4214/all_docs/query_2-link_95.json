        "text": "Title IX: History\n\nTitle IX Foundation: The Education Amendments of 1972\n\nNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.â\n\nâ Title IX, Education Amendments of 1972\n\nWhat we refer to as \"Title IX\" is a single section, Title IX, of \"the Education Amendments of 1972.\" (Public Law No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235) These amendments were intended to regulate education programs or activities. The federal government made these requirements necessary for educational institutions that depend on federal financial assistance, like federal student aid.\n\nAlthough the Education Amendments of 1972 include provisions for special education, school busing, and student financial aid, we're focusing on its prohibition of sexual discrimination.\n\nIn 1974-75 Title IX was most commonly used to stomp out gender discrimination in school athletics programs. By July 21, 1975, Title IX regulations specified that athletics programs had to provide equal treatment \"on the basis of sex\" at colleges, high schools, and elementary schools.\n\nOn October 29, 2002, following the death of Patsy Takemoto Mink, the first woman of color elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and a co-author of the Title IX amendment, Title IX is officially renamed the âPatsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Actâ in her honor.\n\nThe 'Dear Colleague' Letters\n\nIn 2011, the Department of Education issued a \"Dear Colleague Letter\" that rocked the higher education world. According to the letter, all students, not just student athletes, could call on Title IX protections against sexual harassment, including sexual violence. The rationale for this protection is that sexual harassment is sex discrimination. It limits equal treatment \"on the basis of sex\" to the extent that harassment \"creates a hostile environment.\"\n\nThe letter explained that schools needed proactive sexual assault prevention efforts as well as formal reporting processes that students coudl use to get help. Maybe most importantly, the letter said that schools' Title IX investigations should use a 'preponderance of evidence' standard rather than a 'beyond a reasonable doubt' standard.\n\nPreponderance of evidence: the accused is found guilty if the fact-finder decides they are more likely than not to have committed the offense in question. This is the standard used in civil law cases.\n\nBeyond a reasonable doubt: the accused is found guilty only if the fact-finder decides that no reasonable person would consider the accused innocent. This is the standard used in criminal law cases.\n\nIn 2015, another \"Dear Colleague Letter\" reminded schools that if they received federal money, had to hire a Title IX coordinator. These coordinators are responsible for telling students (including those who report sexual assault, witnesses, and the accused) about their legal rights. They also make sure that educational institutions are aware of their legal obligations.\n\nIn 2016 the Departments of Education and Justice issued guidance regarding protection of transgender students under Title IX. This \"Dear Colleague Letter\" explained that schools must \"help ensure that trangender students enjoy a supportive and nondiscriminatory school environment\" (emphasis added).\n\nTitle IX: The Pendulum Swings Back(wards)\n\nIf you click on the links above for the \"Dear Colleague Letters,\" you will see the following disclaimer:\n\nRescinded: This document has been formally rescinded by the Department and remains available on the web for historical purposes only.\n\nThat is because the Department of Education, under Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, withdrew all three \"Dear Colleague Letters\" between 2017 and 2020. The letter protecting transgender students was withdrawn first, on February 22, 2017. This came less than one year after that particular \"Dear Colleague Letter\" came out in the first place.\n\nAlthough it is helpful to be able to read prior documents in order to better understand the history of Title IX, the fact that the \"Dear Colleague Letters\", intended to provide guidance to institutions, were rescinded is a problem for multiple reasons. One, by rescinding this previous guidance, schools become less certain as to how they should perform their jobs regarding the protection of students. Two, it has been argued that these guidelines were rescinded without following the Administrative Procedure Act because there was no notice-and-comment period. If required Administrative provisions were not followed then schools will become less confident about how quickly they should react to future guidance. This then impacts how future guidance from the Department of Education will be perceived generally. Worse, future guidance regarding Title IX's applicability to prevention of future harms and protection of those already harmed might not be acted upon as required.\n\nUnfortunately, while DeVos was Secretary of Education the Department of Education engaged in its own arguably \"unconscionable\" behavior, undoing many of the protections and processes afforded to students under Title IX. In addition to the rescission of protection for transgender students the DOE also withdrew the 2011 guidance protecting all students.\n\nAnd in August 2020 the DOE continued to damage processes and policies designed to provide students with equal access to education, to prevent future inequities, and to provide justice to those who have already been harmed. The August 2020 changes to Title IX Protocols included \"significant changes to grievance procedures and requires live hearings in all formal complaints of sexual harassment at Post-Secondary Institutions.\" The Summary of Major Provisions of the Department of Education's Title IX Final Rule runs nine pages.\n\nUnderstanding these changes and their impact is difficult even if one has a strong understanding of due process, IPV (intimate partner violence), and consent. These are complex, intertwined issues and not easy to navigate even for those with the requisite background. The result is that, under the August 2020, \"Final Rule\" that Title IX was likely to be implemented in different ways from one school to the next based on differing interpretations of these revisions.\n\nTitle IX 2021: Clarifying Rules and Correcting Harms\n\nSoon after President Biden's election, his administration reinstated some of the original intentions behind Title IX's support to provide equal treatment \"on the basis of sex\". On January 20, 2021 President Biden released Executive Order 13988 which states, among other things, that \"[a]ll persons should receive equal treatment under the law, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation.\"\n\nOn March 8, 2021 President Biden released Executive Order 14021 which states, among other things, that Title IX is the governing law which guarantees all students \"an educational environment free from discrimination on the basis of sex, including ... sexual harassment, which encompasses sexual violence, and including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity ...\"\n\nThese latest interpretations of Title IX have been welcomed by those who believe that everybody should be allowed equal access in the pursuit of an education. Further, these changes are important to those who care about violence prevention and victim's rights.\n\nHowever, these changes also highlight how uncomfortably fluid these protections are for such fundamental human rights. The right to learn - to live - in an environment free from sexual assault and harassment is a foundational concept that should remain stable. We are hopeful that in the future the abrupt changes to Title IX during the period of 2017-2020 will be seen as aberrations. Schools, students, and those responsible for enforcing Title IX deserve better. Our hope, as a nonprofit organization focused on violence prevention, is that we will see schools focus on the prevention of future violence as they continue to support those who have already been victimized.\n\nElements of Consent\n\nConsent is a fundamental part of a healthy relationship that involves correctly giving and getting permission. However, consent is not limited to dating relationships. It also applies to many other aspects of our lives.\n\nIf you decide to have elective surgery, you will be told about the possible problems from that surgery before consenting to have that surgery performed. You are then in a better position to make an informed decision, an important element of consent.\n\nSimilarly, if you are decide to participate in a test of a new skin lotion, you should be informed about the possible risks before giving your permission to be a test subject. This affords you the opportunity to make an informed decision as to whether or not you want to participate.\n\nThe more you think about the basic principles of consent, the more you'll realize how often consent affects you. (And you will also realize how often others are not properly getting your consent!)\n\nThe elements of consent:\n\ninformed, freely given, actively given, and revocable.\n\n(1) Informed\n\nFor permission to be informed, the person giving that permission understands what that permission entails.\n\nFor example, a person must be above a certain age to legally engage in sexual activity. While they are young, can't fully understand the consequences of sexual activity. If a person is under a jurisdiction's age of consent, it is often referred to as \"statutory rape.\" They are considered, per se, as lacking the ability to make informed decisions regarding sex. That's why sex with a person under the age of consent for that jurisdiction is legally considered rape based on an age-specific statute.\n\nAlthough these statutes, like most laws, are not perfect, they do simplify the process of determining if people under a given age are sufficiently informed to make such decisions.\n\n(2) Freely Given\n\nFor permission to be freely given, the person must do so without being coerced, intimidated, forced, or threatened.\n\nFor example, an employee is not freely giving permission for their work supervisor to engage in sex with them if they are only doing so out of fear that they would otherwise lose their job. The threat of being fired means that the necessary permission was not freely given.\n\nThis is one reason that many companies forbid supervisors from dating employees who report to them, and it's also why some universities forbid professors from dating their students. The greater the power imbalance, the more difficult it is to know if permission granted by the one with less power is given freely.\n\n(3) Actively Given\n\nFor permission to be actively given the person giving it communicates that permission verbally or through action.\n\nFor example, an unconscious person cannot actively consent. Neither can a person who is too drunk, high, or sick to give permission.\n\n(4) Revocable\n\nPermission given by a person is revocable â they can change their mind whenever they choose.\n\nFor example, if you had consensual sex with your high school sweetheart while you were both in school, that does not mean that the consent still exists when you see them at the twenty-year reunion.\n\nThe fact that consent is revocable is why marital rape is illegal in most countries. Although some countries do not have laws protecting spouses from sexual assault, most countries recognize that, because consent is revocable, merely being married is not sufficient to indicate that consent exists. This recognition is relatively recent. In 1975, Nebraska became the first U.S. state to outlaw marital sexual assault, but the last U.S. states to outlaw marital rape, Oklahoma and North Carolina, didn't do so until 1993. Unfortunately, the fact that the victims are married to the perpetrators means that some jurisdictions still treat marital rape differently than non-marital rape. Lawmakers who allow such distinctions do not understand consent."
