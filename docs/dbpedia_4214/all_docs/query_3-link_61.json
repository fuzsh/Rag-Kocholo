        "text": "Once you have committed to becoming and being a writer, there is no turning back.\n\nWhen you have an idea in your head, it doesn't stay there.\n\nIt crawls into your veins and your mind and your inner being.\n\nYou become your idea.\n\nEspecially when you have committed to writing a book; it will mentally kill you. But I think that’s what writers live for.\n\nWe love the pressure, we love the frustration, it gives life to our product, to our work. That’s why we put so much time into it, it’s literally our blood, sweat and tears going onto a page.\n\nIt’s our life’s work, in every context of that statement.\n\nBut when you have that idea in your head, you better be sure you do something about it.\n\nIt will literally haunt you until you put pen to paper.\n\nAs a writer, you cannot sit with an idea; for fear that you will lose it and once you lose an idea, it never comes back and if you are lucky enough that it does come back, its never quite the same.\n\nThat is why, for the past 6 or 7 years or maybe even more, I have been tortured by myself to write my book, my story. An autobiography.\n\nI am finally going to finish it and I am terrified about it. It is not an easy thing to do and it takes a lot of commitment in terms of time and effort and putting yourself out there.\n\nYou think my blog posts were intense?\n\nWait until you read the book.\n\nThe nice thing though is that the more you write, the more you write.\n\nThe more time you spend writing, the more work you produce which is ultimately what you want as a writer.\n\nI have gone through periods where I didn't write for months and then all of a sudden I’m writing for 3–4 consecutive hours every single day for weeks on end.\n\nBut then the opposite end of this dilemma is the quality of your content or your writing; sometimes we write a lot but then we end up writing crap, whereas if you find yourself working on one piece of work, it turns out to be your best work.\n\nBut this can differ from person to person.\n\nIt really is a writer’s curse that never seems to end so if you are going to title yourself a writer, please do so with caution because its the one career (I say career because I don’ t believe that writing can simply be a hobby) that could drive you absolutely crazy."
