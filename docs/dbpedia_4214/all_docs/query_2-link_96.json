        "text": "How long has Taylor Swift been singing about Matty Healy? When did Matty start dedicating songs to Taylor? There is only one way to find out – by dissecting Taylor Swift and Matty Healy’s relationship through song lyrics.\n\nSome may say I’m doing the Lord’s work while others – like my husband – believe I need to find a new hobby. However, I went to college for this – as an English Literature major it is in my blood to find the true meaning in written word. There are countless resources online studying the lyrical romance between Taylor and Matty, but it can be overwhelming to sift through it all. Never fear, Caitlin is here. I’m breaking it down in an easy to read (and comprehend) form for you!\n\nThanks to numerous internet friends (like this one – thanks Siciliy! – and this one – thanks Esra!) and a little help from my daughter, here are my findings.\n\nIf you look at album release dates and interviews, it is hard to find any romantic mention of Taylor by Matty or vice versa. Neither artist is on record declaring to be in love with the other exactly, except when they both mouthed “this one is about you, I love you” during shows last year. It is strange Matty and Taylor declared to be happier than ever during their brief relationship in 2023 – but that’s all we have to go by.\n\nTaylor Swift and Matty Healy’s secret romantic relationship spans over ten years. Is there concrete proof Taylor Swift has been pining over Matty since 2014? Are there facts stating Matty’s been in love with Taylor for ages? No, not necessarily, but sometimes the biggest confessions are revealed through lyrics (or poetry).\n\nWe’re going to explore Taylor Swift’s music first – then I will cover Matty another day!\n\nTaylor Swift and Matty Healy’s Lyrical Romance\n\nRumors suggest Taylor Swift began weaving Matty Healy into her songs sometime after they became connected in 2014. There are countless parallels between Taylor’s music and The 1975’s songs, as well as mentions of Matty in some of Swift’s most well known songs. Taylor Swift doesn’t talk about her personal life; she sings about it.\n\n“Dress” – 2017 – A song about hidden love in a crowded room – “Flashback when you met me /\n\nYour buzzcut and my hair bleached”\n\nOur secret moments in your crowded room\n\nThey got no idea about me and you\n\nThere is an indentation in the shape of you\n\nMade your mark on me, a golden tattoo\n\nDress\n\n“Death By a Thousand Cuts” – 2019 – This song doesn’t necessarily scream MATTY but it does mirror The 1975’s “Me & You Together Song.” “I think the story needs more pages / Cuz I’ve been in love with her for ages.” Matty revealed the song is based on 4a true story during an April 2023 concert – but has never publicly stated his love is Taylor.\n\n“Cardigan” – 2020 – I’ve always loved this song, not really knowing who it was about. I missed lyrical references to real life events, like “Chase two girls, lose the one” is about Matty Healy dating Halsey. First Taylor mouths “This is about you” with him in her audience at the Eras tour. Then you hear “Peter” on TTPD and there is no doubt “Cardigan is about Matty Healy.”\n\n“I knew you / Tried to change the ending / Peter losing Wendy.”\n\nCardigan\n\n“And when you are young, they assume you know nothing\n\nBut I knew you’d linger like a tattoo kiss\n\nI knew you’d haunt all of my what-ifs\n\nThe smell of smoke would hang around this long\n\n‘Cause I knew everything when I was young“\n\n“The 1” – 2020 – This entire song is about Taylor and Healy’s romance during their 20s and how it did not work out. Aaron Desner, who co-produced this album, believes it is about a long-time friend/lover. Taylor switched out “Invisible Strings” with “The 1” during her Eras tour while dating Healy in 2023. Taylor’s mention of Rosé flowing with your chosen family (Matty’s band is his family) will later appear in “Maroon,” another Matty song, two years later:\n\nWe were something, don’t you think so? / Rosé flowing with your chosen family\n\nThe 1\n\nMidnights – THE ALBUM – 2022\n\nFans are going wild over the lyrical connections on Midnights and TTPD. Was Taylor Swift trying to tell us in Midnights about Matty? The first song we can’t deny, “Question…?” The lyrics reference a blind item – a kiss in a crowded room – revealed by real life gossip girl Deux Moi: Somebody wrote in saying how in 2014 when Taylor’s 1989 album was released, “a friend of mine was part of her performances/tour that era and was around her a lot. The whole thing started when she was at a big party and his band was there and she out of nowhere kissed him in front at least a dozen other people (including my friend!).”\n\nThe next song from Midnights possibly about Matty Healy is “Maroon.” One may not have ever drawn any parallels until they heard “Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus” on The Tortured Poets Department. Taylor Swift doesn’t mention a word (or past song title) like maroon for no reason.\n\nScarlet maroon? There are other bits of “Maroon” with ties to Matty, as previously mentioned above in “Cardigan” drinking Rosé with a lover.\n\nWhen the morning came we were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf\n\n‘Cause we lost track of time again\n\nLaughing with my feet in your lap\n\nLike you were my closest friend\n\n“How’d we end up on the floor anyway?” You say\n\n“Your roommate’s cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that’s how”\n\nThe third song on Midnights that may be a peek into Taylor’s pining for Matty is “Labyrinth.” I can’t find any solid evidence, but it is such a powerful heartbreak song. “It only hurts this much right now / Was what I was thinking the whole time. / Breathe in, breathe through / Breathe deep, breathe out /I’ll be getting over you my whole life.”\n\n“Mastermind” – “Once upon a time, the planets and the fates / And all the stars aligned / You and I ended up in the same room / At the same time.” Too coincidental?\n\nThe Parallels between The 1975 and Taylor Swift Songs\n\nThis incredible Reddit user has put together the most extensive research document I have ever seen about Taylor Swift and Matty Healy. One must note a common denominator between 1975 and Swift: Jack Antonoff. Not only is he a mutual friend, but he also produced multiple albums for the artists.\n\nFor all of my regular readers, don’t worry – Caitlin Houston Blog will continue to be a site dedicated to motherhood, mental health, and all the in-between. <3"
