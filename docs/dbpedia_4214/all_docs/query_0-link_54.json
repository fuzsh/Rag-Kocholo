        "text": "Are you familiar with the term “Lingchi”?\n\nThe literal meaning of Lingchi means “slow slicing” or “lingering death” in Chinese.\n\nOr, as we’ve come to recognize it here in America, Lingchi means…\n\nDeath by a Thousand Cuts.\n\nThe term, “death by a thousand cuts”, originates from a thousand year old Chinese torture method which involved the slow, methodical removal of small portions of the body, prolonging the victim’s agony and eventual death.\n\nBravo Ryan! You have outdone yourself. This must be the least inspiring weekly dose of courage on record to date!\n\nIn modern usage, “death by a thousand cuts” has taken on a metaphorical meaning. It describes a situation where a large problem is caused by many smaller, seemingly insignificant problems or events that accumulate over time. “Death by a thousand cuts” is widely used to describe how continuous minor issues or setbacks can cumulatively cause significant damage or failure, whether in personal situations, businesses, or other contexts.\n\nThis leads us to the true aperture of this weekly dose of courage: If you’ve been following me for a while, then you know I wear the following t-shirt for many of my keynotes:\n\nI’ve never been a fan of “Fake It ’Til You Make It”.\n\nI’m all for and all in on “Mistake It ’Til You Make It.”\n\nAnd Mistaking It ’Til You Make It means that you have to put yourself in a position to (drum roll please) make mistakes.\n\nMaking mistakes requires you to take cuts.\n\nJust this week, I had lunch with the hilarious host of #REI’s Wild Ideas Worth Living Podcast Shelby Stanger. Shelby always has a way of conveying her unique perspective. We were discussing how hard it is to take action on a new idea, while at the same time, recognizing that what comes with action is new information about the idea itself. It’s as if each of us is a blood hound detective in search of answers testing the hypothesize of an idea we deem as “worth pursuing”. Shelby and I are aligned that if an idea continues to show up in your head, then you can’t just sit back and dream about the idea; you actually have to go do it. Action summons new information.\n\nBy “doing”…we learn….we pivot….we make mistakes…we try not to make the same mistake again….we keep going….and we keep growing.\n\nIf it’s death by a thousand cuts, then it’s growth by taking a thousand cuts.\n\nLife’s relentless challenges often feel like enduring a thousand cuts, each one a painful reminder of how hard it is to break new ground on a new project, manifest a courageous idea or take action on something that feels truly scary.\n\nYet, these cuts, though agonizing, are the marks of courage and growth. Choosing to face them head-on is far better than the alternative: a life of inaction, where fear paralyzes ambition and dreams wither away.\n\nTrue progress demands more than words; it requires bold action.\n\nAs Picasso poignantly observed, “After all is said and done, more is said than done.”\n\nEach cut we take is a testament to our determination to grow and achieve. The slow death begins not with failure, but with the unfulfilled potential of ideas never realized. In this light, courage becomes our most valuable asset, our insurance against the regret of inaction.\n\nEmbracing the pain of life’s cuts is the only way to avoid the far greater pain of a life well lived only in your head.\n\nDeath by a thousand cuts fades when you learn from your mistakes.\n\nWhen you create forums to discuss what’s working and what isn’t.\n\nWhen you aren’t paralyzed by fear but remain curious by what’s next."
