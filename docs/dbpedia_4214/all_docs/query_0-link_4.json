        "text": "And yet I see people doing it to themselves, day in and day out. Ok, we aren’t slicing ourselves with a knife, but we are killing ourselves little by little. Think about all the choices we make, every day, which are killing us slowly.\n\nHere’s a few for you in case you’re struggling to identify them:\n\nJobs we don’t like\n\nRelationships we hate\n\nNo passions in our life\n\nMouth breathing\n\nPoor food choices\n\nSedentary lifestyles,\n\nLiving indoors more of our life.\n\n....the list goes on.\n\nWe are literally suffering the same barbaric fate Chinese prisoners faced in the Ling Chi. At least the prisoners had the act done to them. We are doing it ourselves. What’s more, is we are also drugging ourselves so that we can withstand all the pain of a life unfulfilled.\n\nOur drugs of choice are:\n\nAccumulation of things we don’t need or want\n\nAlcohol\n\nMeaningless Sex\n\nFood\n\nTV, magazines, social media and mindless surfing of the net.\n\nCigarettes\n\nHarder core drugs\n\nLook at each of them carefully, then look to your own life. Can you see them there? In and of themselves, most of these habits won’t kill you. But if you allow any one of them to get out of control or, even worse, if you build one practice on top of another, then you are effectively torturing your own body over a long period.\n\nSleepless nights, fatigue and ‘getting through the day’ are not healthy ways of life for humans.\n\nCoffee, sugar (in all its forms) alcohol, cigarettes and drugs are not required to keep us going.\n\nLow energy, pain and disease are not things we should be living with daily.\n\nThe Human Being is born to do more than just survive, we are born to thrive. Breathing, movement, natural food and play is what we need to thrive as Humans. Love, faith, hope, passion, community, forgiveness and thanksgiving are requirements as whole Beings. All of these lifestyle practices together foster a fulfilled life. They are your superpower. Together, they unleash the influential person you were born to become. They develop your Innate Strength.\n\nSo, instead of torturing yourself slowly over a lifetime, you can choose to live a Strong life inside and out.."
