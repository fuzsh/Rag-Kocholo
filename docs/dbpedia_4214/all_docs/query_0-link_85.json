        "text": "Fortnight (Feat. Post Malone)\n\nFortnight is the first song on the album and it features Post Malone; we weren’t expecting such a legendary collab in TTPD. So far, only this song has a music video, which already makes it special for Taylor and Swifties. The lyrics of Fortnight are about a short-lived romance, which could be about Taylor’s many ex-boyfriends. However, the music of this song is Electrpop— making it one of the catchiest songs on the album. It can be perfect for travel videos on Instagram, as the vibe of the song is fresh and new.\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department\n\nDon’t we all agree that Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist?\n\nTaylor won us over with this declaration in the title track of the album, and what good would this list be if a song as good and true as The Tortured Poets Department didn’t make it?\n\nTTPD is about a doomed yet deep relationship. This song is rumored to be heavily influenced by Taylor’s fling with Matty Healy as she talks about typewriters and tattoos, and Healy is known to be a fan of both. Taylor also mentioned the name Lucy in her lyrics, and fans speculate that she’s talking about Matty Healy’s old friend, Lucy Dacus. Since this title track is trending, it makes the perfect choice for Instagram Reels.\n\nMy Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\n\nI know I’m just repeating myself, but TTPD is straight out of the heart of a tortured poet, and you can sense it in the lyrics.\n\nThe title of this song already warns you about a heartbreaking tale you are about to listen to and it serves. Taylor talks about the aftermath of a relationship where she has been hurt even though her partner loved her. It could be about her breakup with Joe Alwyn but can also be about Healy because it is believed that Matty Healy ghosted her after a short fling— leaving her heartbroken.\n\nDown Bad\n\nAnother song that would make you vibe in your car to the music but have you down bad for the whole night sobbing is “Down Bad.” Taylor, in an interview, described this song from the perspective of someone who had an extraordinary love for a short time and who dazzled their world, but the other person abandoned them along the way. This is one of the most catchy songs on the album and has been getting a lot of attention on social media, so get on the bandwagon and use it in your Instagram Reels, and win over the algorithm now.\n\nSo Long London\n\nWe’re onto Track 5, so buckle up because things are about to get personal.\n\nSo Long London is the 5th track on the album and also on our list. We all know what track 5 means in a Taylor Swift album. As the name hints, the song is rumored to be about Joe Alwyn and has a lot of lyrics hinting back to “You’re Losing Me,” which was a breakup song Taylor wrote for Alwyn and her relationship, and both the songs SERVED!\n\nSo Long London is one of our favorites on the album and this song is rightfully getting attention not only on Instagram, but on TikTok as well.\n\n@maddiejuno\n\nJUNGEEEEEEEEE 😭 ich geh kaputt #ttpd #solonglondon\n\n♬ So Long London SPED UP – evermoki\n\nWho’s Afraid of Little Old Me\n\nEveryone should be scared of little old Taylor Swift, considering the chaos her albums like “Red” made. She’s as raw and untouchable in TTPD as she was in Red and delivers this message very clearly in this song. It sounds like revenge, but you can add it to any type of content on Instagram, and here’s an example.\n\nGuilty as Sin\n\nGuilty as Sin is also gaining popularity on social media slowly because of the Roxy music. The vibe of this song makes it a perfect choice for Instagram Reels, and while you might not agree with the lyrics, as this song is about wanting to cheat, you can’t miss out on the catchy tunes and have to shake a leg with them. Check out this Reel to learn how people enjoy this song regardless of the meaning behind it.\n\nloml\n\nIf you’re looking for a piano, you’ll get it in loml.\n\nThis song is also about a relationship that has been back and forth without any commitment. Taylor hints at her relationship with Matty Healy in this song by saying,\n\nIf you know it in one glimpse\n\nIt’s legendary\n\nWhat we thought was for all time\n\nWas momentary\n\nOne of the biggest reasons for this song’s popularity is its sweet and somber music, which is different from all the other tracks on the album. Loml is perfect for aesthetic videos on Instagram like this one.\n\nI Can Do It with a Broken Heart\n\nIf you thought we don’t have Taylor Swift’s trademark song on The Tortured Poets Department, we thought too soon. I Can Do it With a Broken Heart is the 13th track on the album and sounds the most like Taylor’s original music with Synth and Rock elements. Just the name of this song is enough for people to feel motivated to listen to it. No wonder, this song is getting popular on Instagram.\n\nFlorida (Feat. Florence+ The Machine)\n\nTaylor Swift has a lot of secret messages in TTPD for fans and this is not the first time she did it. All of her albums have Easter Eggs for fans to observe and create their own theories because everything is by design, cuz she’s a Mastermind!\n\nIn Tortured Poets Department, she has mentioned Florida in the main track Fortnight and also has an entire song about it. Fans are wondering what this means to their idol because when it comes to Taylor she doesn’t write anything just for writing. The catchy tune of this song is perfect for some transition videos on Instagram or maybe a fit check like this one.\n\nthanK you aIMee\n\nWho doesn’t know about the rift between Ms. Swift, Kanye West, and Kim Kardashian?\n\nTaylor has always written songs about them without mentioning their names. Fans just know that it’s about them when Taylor drops a minor hint, just like the title of this song where the only capital letters are K, I, and M— making it KIM!\n\nTaylor Swift had a song in Speak Now named “Mean” where she threw shades at Kanye West, and similarly, she’s probably talking about Kim Kardashian in thanK you aIMee. Things related to the Kardashian fame get in the trends quicker than expected, hence, this song is also hitting it hard on Instagram and TikTok as people are trying to understand who it is about.\n\n@thethriftyswiftie\n\nWho is thanK you aIMee really about? #taylorswift#swifttok#taylornation#swiftietiktok#swifttoker#swifttoks#swiftliketaylor#taylorswiftlover #taylorswifttorturedpoetssociety#ttps#thetorturedpoetssociety#thetorturedpoetssociety#ts11#taylorswift11 #ttpd #thankyouaimee\n\n♬ original sound – Ginnie\n\nI Look at People’s Windows\n\nThe first sound of this song takes us back to the Lover Era as it has a similar rhythm and music to Deaths by a Thousand Cuts. It has a very calming start— making this song a perfect fit for videos shot around nature. Whether you are an influencer showing the beauty of nature or a business owner producing natural products, you can use this song to trend on Instagram.\n\nCassandra\n\nAnother strong element of Taylor’s songwriting is that she creates fictional storylines and characters. Cassandra is a character from Greek mythology who had a tragic tale, and Taylor seems to be talking about her in this song. The music in this song hints at betrayal and disillusion— making it an even sadder tale. However, Instagram users have found a way to celebrate this song regardless of its genre and why not? All you need to do is make the most of these trending sounds for a boost in engagement.\n\nPeter\n\nPeter seems to be another fictional (or maybe not) character who told her he was going to come find her and marry her when she was a child. This song reminds us of Love Story and how Taylor was waiting for her Prince in that song till he came and knelt on the ground and pulled out a ring. Peter gives the same feeling as Taylor writes,\n\nForgive me, Peter, please know that I tried\n\nTo hold onto the days when you were mine\n\nBut the woman who sits by the window has turned out the light\n\nUnlike Love Story, this tale of young love doesn’t have a happy ending, but that shouldn’t stop you from making Instagram Reels on the song.\n\nThe Bolter\n\nThe Bolter is one of the last tracks on The Tortured Poets Department and is very likely to be about a viral picture of Taylor Swift with Joe Alwyn where the two were seen bolting after an award show. Who knows what it could be about? Taylor writes about a woman who’s in love with a man who’s not right for her."
