        "text": "Kelli Rubin Based off of one line in Verity’s letter where she says something along the lines of “I don’t expect you to understand because you don’t have the mind of a writer” I think the manuscript was true and the letter was posed as if it were to Jeremy, but Verity anticipated that Lowen would find it. I think Verity observed for so long that Lowen had the manuscript and didn’t show Jeremy, so she knew she wouldn’t show him the letter either. Her letter was manipulative, as was her entire character, to torture Lowen for the rest of her life for taking her husband and her secret away.\n\nAdele I just finished this and I do not know what to believe. But I want to say one thing... WHY THERE WAS NO WARNING ON THE MANUSCRIPT LIKE 'THIS IS A FICTION PLEASE DO NOT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY' ???\n\nVian I think Verity most definitely killed Harper. Ever the 5 year old Crew knew Harper could not swim, yet mom took them boating without a life vests? Also, Verity says she took a whole 30 seconds to realize Harper wasn’t behind her and Crew as they got out of the water. 30 seconds? That is an ion for a mom in such situation. Verity had just lost Chasin and yet was somehow this careless? No. She is too smart for that. She called for Crew to hold his breath, why not tell them both? Verity did favor Chastin and Jeremy was aware of this.\n\nThe letter at the end, if it was truly meant for Jeremy, why was it describing Verity and Jeremy’s encounter while he drove her to fake the car accident? She went on to describe how he saw her open her eyes hence knew she want paralyzed, etc. The letter wasn’t written for Jeremy.\n\nIn the end Verity, the queen of manipulation even after her death, lost because it didn’t get to Lowen nor did it destroy her relationship the way it was intended.\n\nMelissa Didn't anyone else find it weird that the entire family was sleeping on the second floor?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm leaning toward team manuscript on this one, but I have to wonder if Jeremy knew or suspected more than he let on.\n\nIf you have someone who is truly incapacitated, why on earth would you move them to the second floor? That would be a serious hazard safety-wise. (Crap happens to elevators.)\n\nI'm just over here wondering if Jeremy did this for a couple of reasons, one, to put as much distance between Verity and her office.\n\nAfter all the jig would be up if someone caught her sneaking around. (Even though she claims to have done this while he was sleeping, that's a hell of a risk.)\n\nAnd Two, possibly, would be to put himself between her and Crew while everyone slept.\n\nIt's a little different during the day when the nurses are hanging on her every move. It'd be hard to trust a woman if you thought she might've had something to do with your child's death. It doesn't matter if that thought only lasts a split second. Once it's there, it's there.\n\nAnd honestly, letting another woman sleep in their bed? Guest or not, that'd be like giving Verity the middle finger. Relationship over.\n\nSo how could Verity retaliate? By squirreling away a letter that might manipulate the situation in her favor even after the fact. So as the couple goes, I feel like they're both unreliable. One being vengeful and the other...just a villain. I mean, it gives \"Write what you know.\" a whole different meaning.\n\nThough I do find it strange that Lowen kind of takes on some of Verity's quirks and mannerisms. Girl, did you really have to bite the headboard?\n\nCora Ducolon Yes, it is interesting which of the two versions is the truth: manuscript or letter. However, I think it's more interesting that it leads us to all the double sides to people in the book. Is Jeremy a sweet loving victim or is he a manipulative wife killer? Is Lowen an innocent person who just happened to fall in love with Jeremy or is she a manipulative, codependent woman who bites on the bed just like her predecessor and kills when she can't have him all to herself?\n\nIn other words, is the scary truth (the verity) that both Jeremy and Lowen are just as awful as the wife, that by hating her, they actually became her?\n\nKassee Buonano One key thing that stands out to me is Chastin's scar that she was born with. I know they said it can be common for twins (scarring tissue) but her version really sticks out in my head... the abortion attempt with the hanger.\n\nClara Lowen is the villain of the book...\n\nlet me finish properly. She states at the very beginning that many people can not differentiate between the author and their book characters, which made her editor fall in love with her, while reading her first novel. But she states that she couldn't be more different than the protagonist of her first novel. My guess is that is quite the same with Verity. Lowen writes loveable characters and isn't quite loveable herself and Verity writes terrible characters that have nothing to do with herself.\n\nI would even go so far that Lowen is no reliable narrator. She has absolutely no people skills because she isolates herself her entire life, her own mother ist terrified of her even when she was just a little girl and has little other friends.\n\nAnother point adding to this is that Jeremy is absolutely in Love with Verity after he reads her first novel script, which is not a thriller and was written about him. He hasn't read the other book series of his wife because he cannot differentiate the ideas from her. He then confesses to Lowen that not Verity but himself is a big fan of her work and wanted to get to know the author. Like her editor Jeremy falls in Love with the idea of the author after reading Lowens first book.\n\nLowen also becomes obsessed with Jeremy quite like the Verity in the manuscript. She gets pregnant (on purpose) and eats the pieces of the letter with Jeremies name on it.\n\nMy take is that the manuscript is not the truth but that Lowen falls in love with the manuscript version of Jeremy and Jeremy with the novel version of Lowen. They both have psychotic tendencies and are highly traumatized because of the deaths they witnessed in the past and the one in the beginning of the book.\n\nOlivia Ouellette Did anyone think the response from Verity’s dad when Jeremy called him about the accident to be strange? I don’t remember verbatim what he said but something about evil people deserve it.\n\nThat is not a response you think you’d get from a father estranged or not.\n\nGracie I starred at my ceiling for a good hour after I finished this book, contemplating the ending. I believe the manuscript is the real story. She only started writing the letter when she found out that Lowen and Jeremy were becoming romantically involved, in addition to the fact that Lowen now had access to the script and was onto her act.\n\nKrista Hjelmstad Just finished reading and my mind is blown. I am on team manuscript for sure. One of the biggest things that gets me is if Verity were to be innocent, how could she possibly write about her self doing such horrible things to her daughters who had both recently died tragic deaths? I just can’t believe that an innocent person would be able to write a story like that from their own perspective of their “real life”\n\nAdelaide Okay I just finished this book and I’m definitely team “Manuscript” but I’m also kind of confused, mostly in relation to Jeremy.\n\nFirst of all, if he tried to kill Verity twice, why not do it a third time? I mean, clearly he wanted her dead after she killed his daughter. Instead though, he keeps her around. I’m not asking about this because I suspect him of anything necessarily, but I find it kind of odd nonetheless.\n\nMy second area of confusion is in relation to him not believing Lowen when she said that Verity wasn’t actually brain dead. If he knew that Verity was a master manipulator and killed her own child (not to mention that she did many other crazy and awful things), why would he have trouble believing Lowen about this? I mean for a second there, when Lowen was confronting Verity, he asked her to leave because she was “acting crazy”.\n\nNext I want to address the fact that he allowed Crew to be alone with Verity. It’s one thing to be in the same house with her where there is supervision, but alone with her? That seems like a disaster waiting to happen. Especially after he got cut by that knife! If I had read -and believed- the manuscript I wouldn’t let my kid within 100 yards of that woman. Sure, he believed she was brain dead but there were points within the story where he seemed a little on edge when Lowen suggested that Verity may not be brain dead, yet he still let Crew be around his mother. Also Jeremy claimed that he didn’t want Crew to lose his other parent but how is a parent who has killed one of their children a good influence?\n\nLastly, why did Jeremy react so strangely to the manuscript? He’d already read it, so why did he act as though he was reading it for the first time?\n\nAnyway, I didn’t mean for this to be so long. I just finished the book and, clearly, I have many questions.\n\njahnvee the most concerning part to me was how well verity faked her injuries that her own nurse couldn't see behind it. if this doesn't tell how fucked up her mind was then idk what will?\n\ntho I'm still confused about parts related to jeremy,\n\n1. its sure he knew that verity killed harper bc he was so detached with her\n\n2. if he knew about the manuscript and read verity's thoughts on thier kids then how could he let crew near her BUT then his reaction when low showed him the manuscript is a bit confusing\n\n3. he was clueless about verity faking her coma and injuries\n\n4. and lastly I don't think jeremy was behind verity's car wreck (it was her own doing) bc the passenger side was suppose to get wreck in order to harm verity and if jeremy did it and later shifted her to driver seat, wouldn't that raise suspicions?\n\nKenzie i think the manuscript is real. for a lot of reasons, many of which i’ve read here but the main one that sticks out to me, and one i haven’t seen mentioned, is the night lowen found crew with the knife in veritys room.\n\nCameron Gahres I believe the manuscript is real, I also believe Jeremy found out and decided to torture her by one of two scenarios:\n\n1: Drugging her/forcing her into the car to crash. Perhaps the last bit of the manuscript was written by him so if found it would be a suicide note. It sounded like her writing because he was writing from a newly made \"villain\" perspective. Written on a computer and printed, it would be easy to add on to...\n\nShe survived and he continued to drug her and torture her. Only he administered these secret \"night-time meds\". He's no doctor so he didn't drug her enough. Why he was always certain Lowen was imagining things because he assumed the drugs were keeping her comatose.\n\n2: She did try to kill herself because Jeremey found out and she could not live without his love. She survived and Jermey wanted to continually torture her anyways.\n\nEither way, Jeremey was a vengeful villain in his own right. Lowen was too blinded by her love/lust (like Verity) to see the truth/verity.\n\nSleepwalking is possibly an analogy to a latent \"other-you\" everyone has the potential of unlocking and becoming given the right circumstances. Like how even Jeremey, a legitimately good person, and father could become a villain to punish a woman who took his daughters away from him\n\nAndrawes ICloud THESE ARE MY THOUGHTS ON THE ENDING:\n\nI think Verity left that letter for Lowen to find. She’s been observing her throughout the whole book and knows that if Lowen found something that could hurt Jeremy this much, (Like the manuscript) she wouldn’t share it with him unless she felt she had no other choice.\n\nThink about it, why would she fill the letter with backstory if it were actually addressed to Jeremy who lived through those alleged moments. I think Verity planted that letter to torture Lowen for the rest of her life. The letter was an evil genius (successful) attempt to own Lowen for the rest of her life.\n\nAlso, Jeremy’s reaction to the manuscript is proof that he hadn’t seen it before. I know his words were “where did you find this” and that could either mean that he knew about it or that he was shocked it existed. But still, his rage and emotion was not that of someone who had read the manuscript before and definitely not that of someone who had time to process his wife’s evil side.\n\nI mean really, would Jeremy seriously be as unsuspecting as he was for most of the novel (notably with the locked door incident) if he had read the manuscript?\n\nThink about it…\n\nBeth M Okay, I also think the manuscript is real and I don't know if it's just because that's an easier pill to swallow, however my reasoning is\n\n1) when Jeremy read the manuscript he would have a real life frame of reference for those events. He would remember them not playing out how the manuscript describes them. After her coat hanger abortion, he would remember them waking up in blood. He also would know that she talked about Chastin all the time and left Harper out. If she really was this loving mother like the second letter says, he would have known the manuscript was fiction\n\n2) the scar\n\n3) Jeremy saying there wasn't a connection there, just sex lines up with the manuscript\n\nHowever, I would like to know why all of Lowens crazy tendencies were brushed past. Like purposefully getting pregnant from a man you barely know whose deep in grief. Her sleep walking was made out to be a lot more dramatic than it was. She also obsessed over Jeremy in a similar way Verity did, but without the psychopathic tendencies\n\nwowsophiawow I think the manuscript is real and for a small yet but reason.\n\nAt some point in the book when Low and Jeremy are getting romantic- maybe after they had sex for the first time-, Low asks him about his love/bond with Verity. Jeremy states that the connection was always almost there, but fell short and that he thought time would fix their marriage. Jeremy practically states that there was something “off” about their relationship, for the whole length of it. I don’t believe Jeremy has any reason to lie about this, so why did Hoover include this? Is it just to make Low and Jeremys relationship more passionate? It definitely could be a one off thing to make Verity more suspicious and have Jeremy be more open to moving on. I believe that, whether intentional or not, this shows that Jeremy knew something was up with Verity that she couldn’t manipulate her way out of, that deep down he saw through the facade. Food for thought!\n\nJames Crisp I actually think the letter was true.\n\nthe reason being, I personally think it makes more sense, verity waved to crew from her window that one time because she loved him. She probably wasn't in her best state of mind after Chastin died so wasn't alert at the time of the boat ride. She was probably thinking about saving the weak one so they would both live. I think it also proves why everything in the basement was rummaged through as she was looking for the manuscript. Its also why she didn't escape when she locked the bedroom door as she still didn't have the money. I think the reason she was at the top of the stairs that night was she'd gone to look for the manuscript and then saw her husband with Lowen and got carried away and just watched it happen. I also think Jeremy had already read the manuscript as he said \"Where did you find that?\" and he said he only read her first novel as he didn't want to get inside her head but he loved the manuscript for her first one. Maybe the reason she told Crew not to talk about the boat ride is that she didn't want Lowen to get the wrong idea and try to kill Verity herself? Then again I think Colleen Hoover personally left clues for both theories so it was possible to believe both. Also verity means truth which may be another clue that the letters true.\n\nanaya I think majority of the readers would not believe the letter she wrote. If anyone reading this believes Verity is innocent... Let's see what you think after you read this.\n\n- Lets begin with the manuscript. Verity mentioned that Amanda suggested writing an antagonist pov journal, or creating her life into a villain's story. Let's consider this IS true. But tell me this... how'd Verity nail every \"villain pov\" page, flawlessly. Her entire take on the villainess was so real.\n\n- I'd like to mention how she labelled her manuscript as an 'autobiography'. Why label it as an autobiography, if it was meant to be a \"practice journal\"?\n\n- this is a very subjective one, based mostly on my evaluation. Every word, every sentence in her manuscript was so nail-biting. I don't think anyone would come up with such a good storyline for a mere journal. Who the hell thinks so creatively. Also, the information, the detail and how it felt as though she wrote it as though she was living it is a very good example too.\n\n- if Jeremy had read the manuscript, why did she bother taking so long to write an apology letter? Why did it take her a Lowen, to write an apology letter. I don't think Jeremy would've crouched under her hospital bed because the guy didn't even know she could move and why would he check the floor? It was definitely there for Lowen to read, to either make Jeremy seem like the bad guy, or to make Lowen question everything.\n\n- the scar on Chastin, is literally evidence. & I think Harper's autism is an affect of the wine and pills Verity took.\n\n- Why the hell would you take them on a boat without a life vest if you had good intentions. She's a mother. She probably imagined every possible way of them to get hurt, and would've remembered it if she cared.\n\n- Why did she tell Crew to not tell Lowen anything about her?\n\n- Did she want to run from her husband, or the police?\n\nI'm definitely not sane after thinking why and how this whole book ended the way it did. But my opinion. I just mentioned every reason why I think Verity is guilty.\n\nnethra Jeremy as the real villain:\n\nStarting with the fact that Jeremy read Lowen's book and staged the whole plan of her coming and staying at their house. Maybe he fell in love with her writing, and possibly her, or maybe he just wanted to kill Verity and needed an ally.\n\nIn Verity's letter, she reveals that it was actually Jeremy who tried to kill her, so maybe the whole thing about them being \"chronics\" was a ruse and a way for Lowen to feel pity for Jeremy. Further, if Jeremy had already read the manuscript, why did he make Lowen think that he knew nothing and played the victim? I'm not saying that Verity may have been a good person, we will never know that, but maybe the villain was Jeremy all along.\n\nWhen Jeremy went to Manhattan, Verity said that she looked all over her office for the manuscript but couldn't find it. This shows that clearly someone placed it there, and the only person who had read it was Jeremy. After he came back from the trip with Lowen, he placed the manuscript in such a way that Lowen would find it and finally see Verity as the bad guy.\n\nIn the end, I feel his plan worked out as he planned it to. He had one kid left, he could start a new family with Lowen, and....Verity was dead.\n\nClaire Harper I just finished this book and have been reading all the comments on here. I think that Jeremy placed the printed manuscript in the office knowing Lowen would find it. Like he wanted a reason to kill Verity without as much guilt. I also lean more towards believing the manuscript over the letter, simply because I don't think a mother could write (in detail) about the multiple different times she tried to kill her own daughter(s). I also saw someone mention the scar on Chastin's face, which also makes me believe she tried to abort the twins herself.\n\nBut maybe Jeremy never had a chance to read the full manuscript the first time? Maybe seeing more of it caused more anger when Lowen was with him? Maybe he never knew the printed version was in the office? I have no idea.\n\nI thought this book was absolutely amazing, and the ending really left me questioning the entire thing. It was great!\n\nReem Manuscript is definitely real. If it’s true that Amanda her agent asked her to write this manuscript as the opposite of her true intentions then Verity would not have went to such extreme lengths to destroy it she would have simply asked her agent to help corroborate her story and that indeed this is what her agent had asked of her. Instead, she says she didn’t say anything to Jeremy because he wouldn’t have believed her when in fact she had a witness, or what supposedly would have been a witness (her agent)\n\nGina She was a true narcissist and that letter was her last manipulation. If she knew Jeremy was going to kill her, she could’ve told the nurse or a doctor or gotten out without money and got to the authorities.\n\nSares i think manuscript is real one. heres my reasons.\n\n1. the most obvious one are the twins, Chastin with the scar, yes it was possible it happened if the twins had fight in the womb but if that was the case the doc said it would fade over the time but it didn't - so this might have happened during the abortion attempt. So far I could still give it a doubt but after finding Harper was on autism spectrum this confirm that Verity did try to abort the twins. Because the only way both twins were born like that if something terrible happened during the pregnancy. We all know how much Jeremy cared and loved her during the time she was pregnant, she never had a reason to feel unloved but only due to her jealousy and disturbed mental.\n\n2. Not once, but multiple times she explained in great detail how she tried to harm both twins, then Harper. It didn't sound like writing exercise more like she is her own villain.\n\n3. The manuscript was supposed to writing exercise then autobiography, but there were at least 4 chapters she wrote in detail about her sex life and only 2 paragraphs about the birth of Crew.\n\n4. She did put a warning in the beginning, which was everything she wrote was the truth, yet she could have said it was fiction. She didn't because she never had plan for it to be out, to be published. so she thought it was safe on her laptop with her until she decided to print it out.\n\n5. The letter she wrote it a sorry attempt to prove her innocent. she always used the word \"fucking\" in her manuscript to hide or bite down her frustration and that word slipped few times in the letter.\n\n6. Her intention if to be true was to take Crew out and she could have done it but instead she wrote the letter the entire night. Yes, she was waiting for the money, but if she had to leave with crew she can just drive to the bank the day and get the money anyway.\n\n7.The letter described how much Jeremy hated her. The letter was supposed to be for Jeremy she didnt have to go to extend length for that but she had to because she hoped someone else would find it, either Lowen or Police or April, anyone that would read the letter and know that Jeremy attempted to kill her twice and would do it again. Thats how twisted she is.\n\nmaali I think that the manuscript contained the truth because it seems weird that Verity wouldn't put a warning at the beginning of it saying something along the lines of: \"THIS IS JUST A WRITING EXCERSIZE AND IS A WORK OF FICTION.\" For someone so manipulative and cunning, Verity surely would've thought that through.\n\nHowever, it also makes me wonder why she didn't put that warning on anyway. If, by chance, someone had read the manuscript, even if it was real, the warning would've made them think it was false anyway.\n\nSo the question is: why wasn't there a warning? Whether or not the manuscript was true, writing something at the beginning would have stopped anyone from suspecting Verity was guilty.\n\nHonestly the entire ending just has me unsure of what to believe.\n\nPeyton Lewis I agree with everything in these replies, and everything points me towards thinking the letter is a lie and the manuscript is what actually happened. Except, what reason would she have to act incapable of any interaction if she did really want nothing except for Jeremy? If the manuscript is true then she drove into a tree because she sensed Jeremy was suspicious and couldn’t love her. But when she accidentally survived, what is the purpose of not recovering? Or why not try to do it again.\n\nOlenya Viegas Everything is fine but can anyone please clear it out that the baby monitor was on and recording Jeremy kill Verity and Lowen witnessing it Right??????!!!!! I mean I was hoping someone to kinda find out that Verity was killed based on the monitor?\n\nJaimie Algas I didn’t Like how jeremy and lowen killed verity. I’m not saying that verity wasn’t a manipulative b!tčh but… thruthfully speaking I wanted verity to recieve karma not the way jeremy and lowen did but life sentence in jail. She needed to look over and repent on her past. I also wanted to preserve the memories of jeremy and lowen being an ok couple without being murdere. Honestly the letter has got me, but looking at the other comments, in the end verity was a manipulative person.\n\nMelissa Bastone I am team “Manuscript is the truth” and my one single piece of supporting evidence is that the one twin did in fact have a scar on her face. Hence proving the hanger story.\n\nTwoTonYoda This ending was absolutely unbelievable poop.\n\nAzza Bn honestly after giving it much thought i do believe the letter is the truth and i do so for so many reasons to start with why the hell would verity fake her injuries if she wasn't truly afraid from jeremy ,afraid that he might try to kill her again for the third time, also if verity was the true villan here why wouldn't she do smth to lowen knowing how obssesed she is with jeremy and allowing a woman in herbed with her husband like comeon it doesn't make sense if she killed her own daughter than she's campable of doing much worse, in addition to that if the manuscript was true and it showed how equally jeremy was obsssesed with verity as much as she was why the hell he will go for another woman if he didn't read the manuscript already and found out how aterrible person his wife is ... it'sbecause he believed the manuscript, jeremy said at the beginning he doesn't like reading verity's work because how dark her writing was in fact he was afraid to believe what she writes and that's exactly what happendwhen he read themanuscript , to mention the scar on chastin actually i do believe it was because it's common to happen to twins and not because of the faild try of abortion ,colleen played with our minds let us believe that verity was crucial and evil why the truth is that both loawen and jeremy are the true villans lowen was obssesed withe the jeremy that verity wrote about and that's what justifyher actions towards him and jeremy was a psycho himself too cuz he read the manuscript and believed it and wanted to torture verity more by bringing lowen to their house .. and also there's a point most of the people neglected which is the similarity between lowen and her mother's situation and jeremy and verity after the accident low's mother was terrified of her la hated in a way oe another her mom and it's the same for jeremy but despite all the hate that stayed by theirsides and took care of them also if verity as a villan am sure crew will beafraid of her beacuse he witnessed the death of his sister that his mother responsible of by lowen always mentioned how he spand most of his time next to his mom in bed , not to mention that \"verity\" means the truth so yeah i dobelieve the letter was true and both lowen and jeremy are fucked up\n\nMeghan Did no one else notice last line of the book, “the end” is written in the same handwriting style as “the end” of the autobiography?\n\nClara I have never been a mother so the closest thing I can approximate this to is how much I love my cat. And even though I know it is not very similar, and I do love writing from different perspectives, there is absolutely no goddamn way I could even think about hurting my cat, never mind writing an in depth manuscript about my hatred for her. Doing that towards a fictional character sure, but to someone I know? My DAUGHTER? If I was able to even write it just an exercise, I would feel so absolutely sick about it I would not be able to keep any evidence of it. Sure, maybe the file kept on your computer is one thing. But to print it out... how could you want something like that about someone you love so very much to exist physically?\n\nThe more I think about it, the less I believe it. You could not write something like that about someone you love who is still living, never mind someone you so recently lost.\n\nYou could not think those thoughts unless they already existed. I call bullshit.\n\nGabriela Garrido The manuscript is real and the letter is just a last ditch effort to clear her name.\n\ntaline Oh my god. I just finished this book and i can’t even wrap my head around the ending. I’m definitely team manuscript because the letter was clearly written after Verity found out Lowen and Jeremy were involved together. And in my opinion, the manuscript was too realistic not to be real. The fact that Verity mentioned more than once that she wanted to kill harper is more than just “a writing exercise”. And only a manipulative person would brush it off as just such.. If it wasn’t real, i don’t think she would’ve been able to write it with that much detail about the twin’s— specifically harper’s— death since it would’ve been too hard for Verity (if she were innocent) to write about them since they died so recently.\n\nThe fact that she faked her paralysis (or whatever she had) for that long and that she played the part really well is suspicious to me. I strongly believe that if she was innocent and Jeremy was not, she would’ve reached to Lowen for help, not scare the living shits out of her. And if Jeremy really tried to kill her in the car crash, how did he get out with no scratch. The letter just made no sense to me since there is more than enough evidence to prove it wrong.\n\nAnnie A good editor would have cut the final chapter. It stood on its own much better without the ending.\n\nJennifer If the manuscript was fake, Jeremy would have picked up on the fake details and question it. Like about their sex life, like the time he threw his dinner across the wall etc If the things that were written in the manuscript didn’t play out as Verity claims they did, Jeremy would have been the one to know. Another example is how Verity favoured Harper. It mentions it in the manuscript but if it wasn’t true, Jeremy would have known this and questioned the whole manuscript as to what was true/false. Instead, he believed it.\n\nBesides, if the ‘writing exercise’ was to twist the truth and turn it bad, why didn’t she make out in her manuscript that Jeremy was a terrible husband and father?\n\nLauren I'm not sure what team I'm on. But having gone through these comments, I've noticed many people are using the fact that Verity wrote the letter after finding out Lowen and Jeremy were hooking up, as part of proof as to why her letter was a lie.\n\nMy question is: If the letter is a lie, why do you think the timing of when she says she wrote it is true? Just seems like cherrypicking to me. If you think the letter is a lie, then you can't trust any information in it. To say the whole thing is a lie, oh but the time she says she wrote it is true, just doesn't work for me!\n\nAlphul Kashyap First of all Lowen has some real prblms.. I feel like in a way or other she is kind of similar to Verity. It's quite disturbing bcoz she kept reading d manuscript instead of handing it over to Jeremy.. Yes I do feel like the manuscript was the truth but the point here is why didn't she hurt Crew? I don't understand or maybe she did after all hurted him as in d incident of knife?! Idk it's all so confusing\n\nJothilakshmi I think the manuscript is real her letter is manipulation why because verity doesn't want lowen to live with Jeremy because she is kind of insecure person and she made up those letter and she already it will be taken by lowen Apparently I don't think Jeremy already knew about verity it's all verity made up those letter.If Jeremy knew about verity then why he made crew to be with verity so this are all made up so verity is the villain in this story.\n\nPrerana Sharma I'm going in circles on this one. Neither side sits well 100%. But here are my thoughts...\n\nSuppose everything in the manuscript actually happened- that Verity is a bad mother. Then the question is- Why would she confess to it on paper, on computer? What was her point of even writing all this down....\n\nWhich makes you think why would the manuscript even exist?\n\nWhich makes me think that a plausible reason for the manuscript existing could really be because Verity was practising \"agnostic journaling\".\n\nAnd if she's practising agnostic journaling, then that means what she said in the letter could actually be true. Jeremy knew and a few things about Jeremy and Lowen make me so uneasy:\n\n1. How Lowen is a Verity in the making with the bad childhood, obsession with Jeremy, bed-biting, getting pregnant immediately etc.\n\n2. How Jeremy was already \"obsessed\" with Lowen that he contacted her to finish his wife's books. Almost as if he needed a new Verity in life- but a version who could love his children.\n\n3. How the manuscripts fell into Lowen's laps so easily. Almost as if Jeremy wanted her to read it, become his accomplice.\n\nI don't know if the manuscript is true or rather by what percentage it is true, but the letter might be true. I believe Jeremy knew about his wife, but just didn't know of a way to get rid of her without being jailed. His first attempt after all failed. So he brought in Lowen to think of a scot-free ending. And Jeremy was okay with Crew and Verity being together because he believed that Verity would not kill Crew- she saved Crew and Crew obeyed her.\n\nThe only thing Jeremy did not know was that she was faking her injuries. That's when he thought \"FTS, let's end it now. Lowen, tell me what's a scot-free way?\"\n\nMaybe Verity wasn't as evil as what Jeremy believed her to be....\n\nSusan Schleppenbach Does anybody else question crews involvement? I feel like he did bad stuff and the parents were covering for him. I also think at some point verity didn't want to cover for crew anymore. I think Jeremy wrote both the manuscript and the letter. And why in the end did crew leave the hidden compartment open?\n\nMarjorie I think the letter was true. It sounded more like something a real person would write. It just seemed more authentic, while the manuscript was so over the top that it seemed more like fiction or melodrama.\n\nBefore getting to the ending, I had already stared having some doubts about the manuscript. I thought that maybe Jeremy had written it and planted it in Verity's office so that Lowen would read it. I thought maybe he was the one who had killed the girls. I was expecting a plot twist, just not exactly the one that we got.\n\nLowen comes across as likable because she's the narrator of the book and we're seeing things through her eyes, but there are hints along the way that there may be something sinister about her. Why was her mother so afraid of her? Why did she end up in Verity's bed while sleepwalking? Why was Lowen so scared of her own capacity for doing something evil while sleepwalking? She says her therapist told her that her actions while sleepwalking and her intentions were not connected, but she doesn't really seem convinced. She seems afraid of herself! Maybe we should be afraid of her too.\n\nI'm less sure of what's going on with Jeremy. I think he pretended that he hadn't read the manuscript because he saw an opportunity to get Lowen to help him finally kill his wife. I think, as the letter says, that he did try twice before. Maybe it became harder to try again once she was back in the house with an attendant.\n\nLooking at it this way isn't a perfect fit. There are some holes. But I guess I just don't believe that someone could be the extreme psychopath that Verity was portrayed as being in the manuscript without anyone noticing in real life. And I feel there were just too many clues to sinister things going on with Lowen underneath the surface.\n\nAnd then the way she tore up the letter at the end confirmed that for me. She was willing to live a lie and cover up a murder to have her perfect life with Jeremy. She was the psychopath who was obsessed with Jeremy -- not the fictional Verity in the manuscript.\n\nEdited to add: I just thought of something. Maybe the whole book was \"antagonistic journaling\" -- on the part of Colleen Hoover! The character Lowen was similar, in some ways to Colleen. They were both writers and they both wrote suspense novels. But in other ways, Lowen was the opposite. Lowen's mother feared her and tried to limit her. Colleen's mother supports and encourages her. Lowen was a loner. Colleen has lots of people who love, help, and support her. The editor, Amanda, (at least as described in the letter) said that Verity should take events from her own life but make her inner dialogue sinister, the opposite of what she was actually thinking. Maybe Colleen Hoover was doing the same -- writing events or experiences for Lowen that were similar to what Hoover herself had experienced, but with a sinister spin -- turning Lowen into Colleen's twisted alter-ego.\n\nDora Weasley Why didn't lowen just ask Amanda if the manuscript was fictional? Or Jeremy if all the things written happened? Just doesn't make sense\n\nSarah if Jeremy had truly read the manuscript before as Verity says in the letter, then why did he act so enraged when Lowen showed him and only THEN decided to kill her? His reaction was so visceral. That is why i am TEAM MANUSCRIPT\n\nJeanne did Verity love Crew?\n\nLaura M I think the manuscript was true. The letter has to many plot holes. For example, if Verity had been such a good mother, why would Jeremy think that she would kill Harper. Verity states in the Letter that it hurt her Jeremy would think that. And if she was so scared of him and wanted to run away, what better opportunity did she need than the night she locked Lowen and Jeremy into the bedroom? Why would she fake beeing asleep after locking them in? She would never get a better opportunity than this! And lets not forget that it wouldn't be easy if not even possible to stage an accident where the drivers side is so smashed in to cause Veritys injuries when she's actually in the passenger seat and you on the driver seat?\n\nClaire in my opinion, the manuscript was the piece of writing in which Verity was telling the truth. my reasons for this are:\n\n1. Verity's only reason in her letter that the manuscript was only a writing exercise was barely even a reason; it was trying to get Jeremy to reconsider what he thinks of her. She provided no real reason for which she wasn't the murderer of her child.\n\n2. Who in their right mind would write about killing their own child, who she claimed to love very much, just a few days after her death. Even writing about shoving her fingers down a small child's throat, you would think that this is too much for a grieving mother to even think about writing, no matter how good of a writer she was.\n\n3. The manuscript was written in way too much detail to be fake. I mean if you weren't obsessed with the sex in your relationship, would it even slip your mind to write about that? if you didn't feel that much hatred toward your child, would you think about writing it?\n\n4. Jeremy had read the manuscript and was convinced that it showed how psychotic she really was, meaning he could confirm that some of these disturbing conversations had actually happened including their conversation about how Verity talks about Chastin more then she does about Harper and after their argument when he woke up with her sucking his dick to make him forgive her.\n\nVerity is a pshyco and you can't tell me otherwise xoxo\n\nSamantha This is my personal opinion but I personally did not enjoy the ending. I like endings to have a clear ending but I can see where she was going with this. Some may choose to believe she did these things in her manuscript or not. I would've liked her to end the book before finding the letter, then I believe the book would've been amazing. The book would've been a 5 star but with the ending I think it is a 4. Honestly still an amazing read but not a book I would read again. all love though :)\n\nTeresa I think Verity definitely killed Harper. When Jeremy first found the manuscript, if it wasn't true, why wouldn't Verity IMMEDIATELY explain what actually happened? It didn't seem like there was any \"no, wait, Jeremy, let me explain!!\" before he took her to the car, drove away, and crashed it.\n\nAnother part that really stuck out to me was when Crew was \"playing\" with a knife and cut his chin, Verity was in the room with him the whole time. It almost makes me think she was trying to kill or hurt Crew? If she was truly the sweet, loving mother as depicted in the letter, she definitely would have pulled the knife out of Crew's hand and wouldn't have let him continue to play with it.\n\nBella Webb I think the manuscrpt shows the true verity. The scene that really did it for me was when crew bit down into the knife. What happened on the lake that made it so bad? If she wouldn’t have done something to Harper, Verity wouldn’t have been so serious about Crew keeping his mouth shut. Also, who could write about THEIR OWN CHILDREN like that without it being true. The letter was simply just to manipulate and torture Lowen.\n\nHeaven I believe the manuscript was all true but when Verity found out that Lowen knew about her \"secret\" she wrote the note. Like why would you write such disturbing stuff about your children? Especially the stuff that had to do with trying to ab*rt the girls... so disturbing. No loving mother would write such gory stuff about her children. I believe she also wrote that note so if the police found it they'd arrest Jeremy and not come after her.\n\nMage you know it really makes you wonder.. but I'm truly amazed at how captivating the novel was to read it in one sitting. in matters of which reality to believe, it makes the most sense that the manuscript was her true self. just because how can someone be capable of writing such gruesome acts/thoughts without having an ounce of evil in them. it was just insanely believable as the book progressed that she was insane. the whole faking of her injury, to receive some empathy from her husband after everything makes the most sense. but towards the end when lowen finds the hidden letter it really makes you think. just for a second wondering if she really was capable of keeping those sick ideas strictly in writing. and the reason why hoover decided to keep that last part in, its truly amazing the way her mind works. but personally I just don't picture verity writing that letter with any honesty, the manuscript and injury faking were signs of a psychopath. so the letter at the end is really just verity realizing her end is coming, she knows lowen is on to her, and she can't reverse any of this mess she's created. but we know how obsessed she is with her husband, she could never leave without causing more harm. she knew no matter who found the letter it would destroy them, and the regret would eat them alive. but in a more evil intention she knew that now that they had fallen in love, if lowen was to find the letter, she'd never compromise her relationship with jeremy. and so she has left her with a huge secret to keep from him forever, almost haunting their future as they leave her behind.\n\nRebecca McHale I am team manuscript, largely because there was no explanation for Crew and the knife incident, was this Verity’s attempt to kill Crew?\n\nI think when the death of Harper raised suspicions with Jeremy, Verity knew this could be the end of their marriage, and she would lose Jeremy forever as his love for her was conditional.\n\nI think she then purposefully crashed her car for attention, Verity will go to extreme lengths for Jeremy’s attention and love, even if that means putting herself or others at risk.\n\nFaking her locked in syndrome, would mean Jeremy would have to dedicate the rest of his life to looking after her 24/7, and attend her every need and acquire all his attention.\n\nI don’t think Verity ever expected Lowen or anyone else to come into the picture, however with Jeremy not working and needing to pay for her care, he will still need an income and so hired Lowen to finish the series Verity had started.\n\nWhen Lowen and Jeremy started developing feelings, and a clear family picture forming between the 3 of them, Verity wrote that letter with the intention Lowen would read it, as Verity was well aware of Lowen’s suspicions of her.\n\nThe letter was intended to try end the relationship between Lowen and Jeremy by painting Jeremy to be the villain in all this, and make Lowen feel guilty for her relationship with Jeremy. If successful, Lowen would end the relationship and Verity would have Jeremy all to herself again.\n\nAimee Bennett Jeremy said: after the accident Lowen witnessed at the beginning of the book “I’ve seen much worse” (than a mans head being crushed beneath a truck wheel!?!)\n\nVS\n\nHe also said of Crew: “He never even mentions his sisters” (Verity told him not to talk about Harper to Lowen and I assume anyone).\n\nSandy Pernick I was completely disappointed with the end. Authors frequently don't know how to end their books so they think a twist makes sense. It just disappoints the reader.\n\nHagar Bakr I trully believe that Verity is innocent.\n\nThere is evidence of it scattered throughout the book, first of all, if she was the villain that killed harber then I am sure she would have tried to kill Lowen when she saw her with Jeremy, but she didn't, she never attempted to hurt Lowen,not even once, although she had so many chances to do so, secondly, after harber death she didn't write for 6 month, if the manuscript was the truth then, why would she not write for 6 months when she cared that much about her career?\n\nThirdly, nothing justifies what jeremy and lowen did!! Even if the manuscript was the truth, they didn't have the right to kill her, they should have just turned her in, and lowen is the real sociopath here, she was okay with spending the rest of her life with a man who possibly tried to kill his wife twice and finally succeeded in the third try, but at the same time she was okay with the fact that verity might have been innocent, and the justification she gave herself?! That either way verity did manipulate a truth? We just don't know which one is it?!!! For real?\n\nI really believe that the lowen and jeremy was at fault, if at least verity was trialled, her innocence could have been proven, but instead they decided to kill her by their own hands which is very unsettling.\n\nShannon Starre Verity writing the manuscript makes more sense to me —especially with Chastins scar and Crews account on what happened when Harper died (and how Verity told him not to tell people about it).\n\nAlso, choking could cause brain damage to lead to Harper being diagnosed with Aspergers, right? And I would have to think with identical twins with the same dna that if it were a condition they were born with they’d both have it... but not so with only Harper being diagnosed and only Harper getting choked as a baby.\n\nWhy pretend to be comatose unless you’re a manipulative bitch? If Jeremy actually set up the accident, wouldn’t you want to recover? And keep writing your book series? And leave the crazy man that “tried to kill you” ASAP and turn him in? You’re the one with the money girlfriend. But I guess if you’re obsessed with Jeremy then you’d think he’d wait on you hand and foot if you were comatose.\n\nAnd wait, how do you hit a tree on the passenger side and then move the injured person to the drivers seat and walk away? Like the passenger seat would’ve taken all the damage? Anndd, if Jeremy knew she was playing him, why the heck would he have kept her in his house and cared for her? And hired nurses? He could’ve easily kept her at a facility if she was truly comatose, as insurance and doctors usually recommend that...\n\nIt doesn’t sound like he knew she wasn’t brain dead and like torturing her or giving her comatose pills at midnight... (why would you hire nurses and invite a writer to live in your home if you were torturing your wife?) (also, I would have to think a steady supply of the supposed comatose pills would be hard to come by without a prescription?). and she was able to lock lowen and Jeremy in the bedroom after her midnight pills.. right?\n\nUnless he knew she was faking her condition. The only proof of the extent of her injury we know is from Jeremy saying that he saw the scans.\n\nThe manuscript seems planted though. And I can’t figure out whyVerity would’ve planted it. She knew about Jeremy hiring someone to finish her books and she “couldn’t find it”, according to the letter. So say she did put it in the drawer. What benefit would that be to her? Would she think that a writer would read it and side with her? After painting Jeremy as the victim of your villainess?\n\nAnd so what if Jeremy planted the manuscript? If the letter was true, couldn't Jeremy have changed the manuscript to say it’s true and an autobiography? And not a practice journal? But if he had changed the manuscript, how would verify have know he changed it to say it was true and not a practice journal? And she wouldn’t have known if he added the end sentence about hitting the tree if he had added it... which she clearly knew about.\n\nThough if the letter was true, why hide it in the floorboard? She hid it because she didn’t want it to be found right away by the wrong person and shredded. If she wanted lowen to read it, or police or whatever to clear her name, why not slip it under lowens door? Or in the desk drawer.... but if it was to Jeremy, why so much backstory? And why do you still love him if he tried to kill you twice before and you assumed he’d try again and succeed (hence the letter). Why not call your agent and clear your name and accuse your husband of attempted murder?\n\nUuggghhhhhh\n\nThe8thPoodle I’ve read comment after comment and my head is SPINNING! What sticks out to me is .. if Verity did in fact despise her children, why was Crew any different? If she truly hated that they took Jeremy from her then why tell Crew to hold his breath? Did she like Crew because he reminded her of Jeremy? Or was it because he was cynical like her (assuming the manuscript was true and Crew laughed with Verity after Harper ran upstairs to cry)?\n\nBecca So many thoughts dissected and analyzed in this book! What a mind twist. I do see a parallel and foreshadowing of Lowen and Verity. Lowen judged Verity 100% on her book. Lowen was judged by her editor Corey, he fell in love with her book characters. Jeremy sought out Lowen as a writer probably feeling the same about Lowen. Lowen became obsessive…. Like Verity. To please Jeremy. To compete with Verity. I feel the ending was a foreshadow that if Lowen stays with Jeremy and Crew, she could become a Verity type.\n\nIn the very beginning, after Lowen witnessed the bloody accident. Jeremy found her, took her to a bathroom. That wasn’t just a kind stranger helping. He was scouting/stalking her. They were both so calm together in the bathroom, with Lowen covered in blood. She even acknowledged how people who have experienced death are drawn to each other, like her and Jeremy.\n\nI do feel Lowen’s intentions when she first arrived at house were good. She mentioned Jeremy deserved to know the “truth,” to be happy, deserve better than Verity, and Crew as well. I feel the house and Jeremy contributed to her anxiety and trepidation. Jeremy wasn’t concerned at all of Verity moving or being awake. He was so comfortable, passive about locking Lowen’s door and Verity’s. I thought that was off-putting.\n\nAnd Crew, is one F’d up boy. Jeremy not giving him help for therapy was strange. Jeremy was very dismissive of any issues with Crew. Jeremy did show he cared for Crew. He showed he cared for Verity by feeding her and bathing her. When Lowen mentioned she was awake, Jeremy told Lowen to leave!!! I thought why would he ask that……\n\nThis was a great book, with lots of different thought provoking possibilities.\n\nKiki (Formerly TheGirlByTheSeaOfCortez) Verity's \"autobiography\" was true, of course. She really did try to kill her twins before they were born, and she managed Harper's drowning. If her autobiography, her confession, really, hadn't been the truth, Jeremy would have protested that they certainly didn't have that much sex, some of the things didn't happen, etc. In addition, Verity knew Lowen was watching her through the baby monitor and saw her hide something under the floorboards. The letter was meant for Lowen, to destroy her trust in and happiness with Jeremy because Lowen wasn't smart enough to figure out the whole thing. The three main characters were despicable. I'm glad none of them got a happy ending. Hated them all. Terrible book, really, but clever ending. Edit: Verity couldn't have caused Chastin's scar. To do so would have necessitated breaking the amniotic sac, which would have induced labor and an abortion, not just bleeding. So, that doesn't prove the hanger part is true.\n\nJaya Well for lowen I don't care what others have to say I find her a very selfish immature 32 year woman who viciously did it with a married man with a child who had massive tragedies take place in there lives. She saw,taught bout no one not even Jeremy before wanting herself and ideal husband material,fantasizing bout him in his and his wife's bedroom while he is still suffering really? Regardless of her feelings towards verity or her sympathy for Jeremy nothing gives her the right to be in any kind of relationship with him,or help him build on she never truly loved or cared for Jeremy because if she did she wouldn't take advantage of his vulnerable,depressed and disturbed state which was left unattended since ever. She barely gave him any time to recover from his past relationship. Also her advice for shifting verity far from them was just as vile,it only felt like she was trying to make space for herself desperate self coz it hasn't been long since had lost his daughters and according to her he still loved his wife and cared for her and Crew needed her the most,I would have appreciated the suggestion if it was like 5-6 yrs of that incident ,No one in real life giving such suggestion to a man like that would be appreciated. I don't support either of the characters when it comes to the infidelity practiced in verity's house in her bed.\n\nLowen never loved Jeremy she would help him cheat,share good times but the moment she would fear verity (like when crew cut his chin and Jeremy took him to doc leaving verity and lown alone) all she could think was of leaving that job, that house and running away. No thoughts of Jeremy.\n\nIf the letter was true and if Jeremy hated her he could have at least respected their relationship to not do it in their house with someone he met like 10 days ago,in a house where his child lives and could see and hear all of it. he could have divorced her first. And if the letter wasn't true then I can't even explain to what level he has disrespected his decade old relationship in two weeks\n\nThe disrespect for his relationship was not smth I could appreciate .\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nTHE KNIFE LOWEN FOUND WITH THE LETTER WHO DID IT BELONG TOO?\n\nIT WAS QUITE FISHY HOW JEREMY IMMEDIATELY KILLED HER AFTER READING THE MANUSCRIPT LIKE HE HADN'T READ IT ALREADY(if the letter was true) WAS HE TRYING TO HIDE SMTH? Like he knew all of it already right? So why did he not tell lowen he has already read it,and then read it twice and had a reaction like he was reading it for the first time?\n\nWHAT WAS JEREMY PLANNING TO TO DO WITH VERITY? (If letter was true)\n\nIf he was so mad at verity that he was planning her death why didn't he try to kill her in her poor state after accident since it would be easier? Or why did he not report her to police? If he wanted her for crew how long was he deciding to keep her with him or what was he deciding to do if she wakes up? Kill her and take away crew's mother from him? Adding more to his trauma?\n\nIF THE LETTER WASN'T TRUE\n\nJeremy said he wasn't guilty for cheating on his wife of 10 yrs he legit said that what was he planning to do if by chance verity woke up? Throw divorce papers on her face right after waking up from coma only to move on with another woman he impregnated after him meeting with her within two weeks? Cuz he didn't know the murder and all?\n\nAll the characters seemed flawed to me it was an amazing book though the manipulation,characters,suspense loved it.\n\nPrevish Two main reasons I think Jeremy hadn't read the manuscript before so Verity lied:\n\n1. His reaction when Lowen told him and he read the manuscript was too intense to not have been real, he had only show authenticity throughout the entire book, even in Verity's perspective (if you think Lowen is an unreliable narrator)\n\n2. If he really had read the manuscript previously, he would never let Crew constantly be alone with Verity, on the same floor or even in the same room alone. We see from both Lowen and Verity's chapters that he was always a good father.\n\nAbby Chamberlain I am team manuscript, I feel as verity could of grabbed Harper and Crew both to shore. The letter was just another way to manipulate Jeremey. She is the queen of lying and gaslighting.\n\nAdrija Goswami I agree with @Adele that Verity should have written in the beginning of the manuscript that this is not the truth in case someone read it by mistake. But, I think that the letter is the truth because if Verity was actually psychotically obsessed with Jeremy and saw him being with another woman, she would have definitely tried in a hundred ways to kill her because she would not have been able to take that in. And why would she talk to Crew and plan to take him away, the motive does not make sense looking at the characteristics of manuscript Verity.\n\nJaviera Vega I think that Verity was a sociopath so the manuscript was real. What kind of a grieving mother writes about taking pleasure of killing your kids?\n\nJY I hate all three, Lowen, Jeremy and Verity.\n\nI am team letter though.\n\nI think Verity wrote the manuscript in a villain psycho way but Jeremy edited it for her to appear even more evil so he had the justification to kill her.\n\nLowen read the edited manuscript with the giga-psycho version of Verity.\n\nJeremy then seduced Lowen and he knew exactly what he was doing. He played the sad and concerned father/husband.\n\nAlso when he answered Lowen`s questions about his relationship with Verity he used the same vocabulary as the manuscript.\n\nAnnabel Custer I’m team Manuscript as well, because I feel like an innocent person would’ve tried harder to prove that they were innocent… though I do have to wonder, if she truly is a psychopath, would she be writing about herself in such a honest way? Most psychopaths have delusions of grandeur / inflated egos, and I didn’t sense this from her autobiography.\n\nKate Brooks The more I process this book (I read it last weekend)...I'm more inclined to lean to towards both Jeremy and Verity both being psychopaths. It doesn't make much sense because the majority of the book was written from Lowen's point of view...\n\nI mean either way, Verity was mad (it was a very desperate situation to put herself in). However, what kind of husband behaves this way after losing his wife, and his two children in such a short space of time?? And then gets Lowen pregnant after two weeks of her moving in???\n\nI enjoyed reading this book (couldn't take it too seriously - but it was a very good psychological thriller)...\n\nAmy Siegler If he already knew about the manuscript, then why at the end pretend to scream and get in her face and tell her if she doesn’t come clean he’s going to the police and she says “I had to”. The manuscript is real and she only wrote the letter after her suspected Lowen onto her. He had never read the manuscript until then.\n\nHailie so i actually think that manuscript was real, Verity could have placed letter somewhere more easily to find from for jeremy and veritys behaviour must have been really weird that actually made jeremy suspectate her too .\n\nok but why did jeremy hide the fact that he had already read the manuscript thats kinda weird like he could have tell lowen he already read it instead of reading it again in front of lowen and then acting like he read it for the first time and then killing verity too. he could have killed her after accident just like he did at the end too...\n\nLobna I don’t see this discussed, so I am not sure if I am alone in these thoughts or I just have not come across someone else saying them yet, so, here goes:\n\nMy starting point is that I feel Jeremy is 1. Too good to be true with Lowen and 2. Is not “stable” himself to rule him out of suspicion.\n\nI think he has been trying to groom Lowen from the start. Asking her about her favourite meal, getting too close and personal. I think from the get go he was trying to foster a connection and there was not a real attempt to keep his distance or respect to the professional work Lowen was supposed to be doing, nor to his wife.\n\nIf he had intentionally picked Lowen, then the scene in the elevator where he pretends to google her books was not fully truthful neither. This is a man comfortable with lying as we see with the limousine story with Verity, he is not above having lied to Lowen, point one for him not being a saint.\n\nHad he even especially selected her because of her history with hospice and mental health? Because of the evictions? Because he is rich enough to order a background check if that information was not online. She is perfect to understand his situation, be suspicious of herself enough and homeless to stay at the house.\n\nPoint two is that he has found a second Verity to love. She is a writer, also writes thriller books like his wife, uses his wife’s office, seems to have a similar nocturnal schedule. At this point in tragedy, he should be fully repulsed by or scared off, or creeped out by someone that similar to his wife, that much of a reminder. Or then, maybe he fell in love with Lowen just because she was Verity? I don’t know but I would like some psychological input on this and both explanations make him creepy AF to me.\n\nAnd, jee, how many times is he going to impregnate women without their explicit consent? And a woman he has been with for less then 2 weeks and 2 nights? What does he know about her?\n\nSo, given these suspicions I have over Jeremy, I think that he intentionally re-planted the manuscript in the office for Lowen to find and fall in love with him and understand when he either 1. Puts Verity in a facility yet still being respect by Lowen as an amazing husband father, rather than one who left his wide behind in her need or 2. tries to get rid of Verity again and Lowen would become a witness to clear his name to the police, insurance company etc., maybe that was his starting point: wanting to groom and accomplice that clears his name or as some insurance policy for him, I am not sure.\n\nVerity, sensing that her end in any form was near: either she would be killed by Jeremy or removed from the house, wrote the letter. The letter strikes me as more detailed than necessary to be written to Jeremy, so maybe it was written to Lowen or to the police, but not to him. This is not how she would plead with him I think, if it was truly for him.\n\nThe letter was written to plant doubt in Lowen and destroy their life, if it was meant for Lowen. And it was there to at least attempt to frame Jeremy if it made its way to the police. An insurance policy for Verity, and lashing out out of anger. I don’t think she meant to run, ever. She loved Jeremy too much to leave or harm him by seeking police protection. She hoped they would remain in this care relationship for ever, or for as long as she felt he started to forgive her, but if he killed her, it was better to die then to live without him.\n\nVerity, manuscript and letter Verity, would never hurt Jeremy or Crew (mini Jeremy). But she tried to spook out Lowen a couple of times without blowing her cover. She hoped Lowen would just leave with that spookiness but she didn’t. And then Lowen was never truly alone for Verity to harm her, except for one evening, so, Verity could not harm her without getting caught or burning the house, harming Crew and Jeremy for example. That one night she was left alone with Lowen in the house, maybe she was on the floor to get the knife out and kill Lowen? Because why else would she be on all fours on the floor? I don’t see why she did not continue with her plan though or fight off Lowen. Maybe she was only planning to sneak up on Lowen and felt that in an all out confrontation, she would loose. She would die or be found out and sent away from Jeremy. So, she ended up changing her confrontational plan.\n\nWhen Lowen presented Jeremy with the manuscript, he put on an act. Maybe he did not plan for it to end up with Verity’s death, maybe he genuinely lost it when he realised she was faking it after all of this. If Verity was not faking it, then he anyway would have a very solid excuse for Lowen to send Verity to a facility and appear like a noble, heartbroken man that she would still love and re-start a life on a clean slate, continuing to be with a Verity he was obsessed with\n\nMy conviction is Verity was not a great person. Jeremy was borderline and all of this pushed him over the edge. Lowen was so much in love, and also generally gullable to question things\n\nMichelle Langton I am definitely team manuscript. As a mother, I could never write such hurtful things about my children- even if it was to be used as a learning tool for writers. These leads me to believe that the manuscript was true. If it wasn’t, how could a caring mother even pretend these things?\n\nWhy not change the names of the children? God forbid the children get their hands on it.\n\nBook Dragon Okay, team manuscript over herd. Like honestly. We get to the first \"so be it\" chapter. It said MULTIPLE times that this was the 'ugly truth' and that she wasn't going to gloss things over or portray herself in a better light. If I were doing an exercise like this then YEAH I'm not going to risk my family funding something like that with no evidence saying it was fake. And the letter? Why would you write when lowen and Jeremy got together? Why not sooner? Why not call the police? I mean if my husband tried to kill me... And why would Crew get cut with that knife? Did Verity tell him to cut himself if Lowan asked him questions? Or why would Verity give him the knife the first time? And if she cut him, did she hope to cut him deep enough for him to need to be taken to the hospital so she could escape? If so why not escape at night?\n\nOk sorry, that was very long. But the manuscript HAS to be the truth.\n\nBruna I just finished reading Verity and wow first of all...i was not expecting that plot twist at all when i was reading it.I honestly I'm leading to team manuscript because the letter was positioned way to perfectly for Verity to be taken as a victim and show Jeremy in a whole different light from as being described as a grieving father to now a manipulator wife killer.It simply just all does not make sense as to if Jeremy really was suspecting Verity and if he had had read the manuscript already then when was his reaction so so convincible.\n\nAlso the letter was never posed to be written to Jeremy, the letter was intended to Lowen. I think that Verity spent enough time to analysing Low to realise that she wouldn't tell Jeremy about the letter and isn't that it was place the time exactly after Low confronted her as if she knew that she was catching up to the truth and wanted to cover her tracks.\n\nAlso one thing no-one has talked about is the knife that verity kept in the bedroom;yes it could be to defend her self from maybe Jeremy but it cut Crew's chin and hand like what kind of mother would do that and stage as it an accident and also force a child to their secrets to the point they bit a knife is insane.\n\nBut i do see that Jeremy and Lowen both had very dark sides and were quite similar to Verity in that way as they were grieving in some kind of way.\n\nThere many questions to this book still that we may never get answers to but sure as hell was and intriguing,horrific,suspense,creepy and cringe book at some moments.\n\nLesley Hodge ugh. I hate to say this but I think Verity was innocent because the only thing that got her to speak up was the threat of taking her child (Crew) away. I hate this\n\nArchie As fas as I think, the manuscript and the letters are both partially true.\n\nEverything that Verity wrote in the manuscript is true because I see absolutely no point in writing about all those detailed intimate scenes recollecting the time she had with Jeremy in the creepy ass exercise she was doing called “antagonist journaling” I presume, in order to improve her writing skills. Not to judge, but what kind of a twisted person gets peace after writing such fucked up shit, anyways? Thus, she's a psychopath and needs to be isolated away from human kind either way. Wheather she killed her daughter or not.\n\nBut I don't think she's completely lying in the letter either. I mean, of course she's lying about how Harper actually died but I don't think she's lying about whether Jeremy read the manuscript on the laptop or not. Primarily because, she wrote the letter addressing Jeremy and had Jeremy not read the manuscript before her accident, he obviously would've told Lowen that. Or maybe she intended for Lowen to get the letter cause Lowen did see Verity on the staircase and knew/suspected that Verity was faking the brain damage, so in order to drive her away from Jeremy she wrote all that letter hoping Lowen would get the letter be hella spooked and leave their mansion. It's also noticeable how she explain everything that happened between her and Jeremy like Jeremy wasn't actually there to witness it all firsthand. Or who knows, maybe she meant for the feds to find that letter because she obviously could not get to the physical copy of the manuscript as she admits in the letter. So she figured it was only a matter a time before that manuscript ended up in the hands of the police and she was in rotting a medical ward. But obviously after such strong allegations the police would check their house and voila they have the manuscript and the police arrests Jeremy and set Verity free.\n\nAlso, when Jeremy is handed the manuscript by Lowen he asks her “Where did you find it?” suggesting he already knew if it's existence. Lowen even admits it took him a lot less time than she'd expected him to read it which further solidifies that he already knew of the manuscript.\n\nNot to forget, he moved into a room on the second floor after Crew wanted to be closer to his mother and chose the room in between Verity's and Crew's as if creating a metaphorical barrier between them exactly the way he did that night when Verity wrote the last chapter and he asked her why she told Crew to hold his breath before the canoe tipped over.\n\nNot sure whether Jeremy actually tried to kill Verity or not but that just depends upon the perception him that he the readers have.\n\nKaylee verity never read the book only Jeremy did so maybe lowen becoming the ghostwriter is actually a set up just so Jeremy could have someone to be with\n\nAnd if Jeremy knew about the manuscript when did he have time to confront verity about it? Was it before or after her car wreck that made her paralyzed? Jeremy’s original plan to kill her was to get her in a car accident so how did she actually get “paralyzed” or if she actually was paralyzed when did she recover from that and decide to pretend to be paralyzed\n\nEmma I feel like the whole Team Manuscript vs Team Letter ordeal would quickly be settled if Lowen would have gone and talked to Verity's editor and asked whether or not she told Verity about writing through a villain's perspective was true.\n\nHailey Hawkes Another interesting thought is that Jeremy at one point says to Lowen “ the sex life was amazing with Verity, and I always was super attracted to her, but I always thought some things were missing between us, but i thought those gaps would soon be filled with time and marriage,” kind of comment. Nope she really is just a mentally ill/nutso woman!! Also, I don’t believe it ever mentioned how the heck he would escape the vehicle before running it into the tree. Or him moving her body. And why would he put himself in that situation with a vehicle? No way…too difficult\n\nLanee I just finished his book. The writing style at the end of the book felt rushed? Why was Jeremy in Verity's office reading the manuscript when its been noted he never reads her work?\n\nCallum Neil I think the manuscript is true. There is a few things that have pointed me in this direction I can explain.\n\nIf she was writing this Manuscript to help her writers block or creativity, why would she write in the editors note that's she is going to bare all her ugliness and gives the reader a generous warning. Why not write just before that for the fictional purposes of this book \"if you read this please be aware that this is a writers exercise and is not true and I would never hurt my children etc\".\n\nIf you type a doc and print it what are the chances of someone finding it?? First Chapter entitled 'find what you love and let it kill you' surely points to the fact she's aware of her outrageous thoughts and knows that her life will come crashing down before it even happens.\n\nAlso the fact that in the manuscript she does detail a lot of her and Jermery's sex life and not a lot about her children, she also only writes about Chastin, why would you do that if you were using this method of writing to journal, why is she not journaling about Harper too? And mainly focusing on her and Jeremy, a mind set of a psychopath.\n\nWhy did she have a knife and why/how did Crew have it and able to cut himself. And then he very fiercely defends and protect his mother, Stockholm syndrome. He also cut him gums, could he have traits he's learned from his mother.\n\nVerity pretending for so long and only writing the letter after she realises her family home is beginning to be torn apart shows that she's lying also. A normal person would show some sort of progression if all she wrote was true, to slow she's on the mend and there might be hope for her.\n\nHer letter seems to long and far fetched, over explaining and its as if she's trying to explain to everyone (police, media etc) and not just her husband.\n\nHer mother and father thought she was evil also, she seems like someone who has been exposed to horrific ordeals or thoughts hence the genre of her books and manuscript. She is someone who can manipulate and has an extensive imagination to do so.\n\nJermery also said she felt like he didn't fully know her, he must of found it hard to understand her. If she was so innocent I'm sure he would have never questioned anything.\n\nThis book got me!! loved it.\n\nParri I've seen many points on team manuscript and i am on the same team but haven't seen someone mention this: If she was innocent and not fucked up like she was in manuscripts why would crew bite down on the knife when he realised he shouldn't have said that? Does that ring a bell? Crew with a knife in verity's room with his chin cut. Why would he do that to himself? In the room with her? Why didn't she stop him when there was no one around?? Did he take the knife there? Why did she hide it? Why the knife was still there in the floor all this time? None of this can be explained unless what she wrote in the manuscript was true. The most reasonable explanation is she used to threaten him with the knife and even did hurt him as well. If she were capable of killing harper she most defo was capable of threatening crew with a knife. Or grooming him to do that so not to speak about her actual condition to anyone which would explain why crew hurt himself with the butter knife after saying she talks to him. No way in hell if she were as concerned a mother as she showed herself to be in the letter would she let him hurt himself right in front of her.\n\nMichaela For me it was the line \"After being the perfect wife to you...\" that made me question the genuineness of the letter. It shows how detached from reality Verity was, the kind of feeling you get from her manuscript too. Clearly, if the manuscript was just an exercise as she claimed and she were a perfect wife, Jeremy would have never suspected her of killing Harper in the first place.\n\nMartin Rinehart I didn't get to the ending. I'd very much like to hear from anyone who can tell me if this is a romance. Halfway, it seemed more Stephen King than romance. I'm FirstnameLastname at gmail dot com. TIA!\n\nAishwarya Nair I think Verity killed Harper. And that everything on that original manuscript was the truth.\n\nMy reasons for this -\n\n1. Someone locked the door that night after Jeremy and Lowen slept in the room. Very unlikely it was Crew. It was more likely Verity. And she wouldn’t have done that if it meant alerting Jeremy.\n\n2. Multiple times that Lowen was suspicious. Again, why would she risk this and have Jeremy alerted?\n\n3. Verity’s estranged parents. “God punishes the wicked, Jeremy” (Although one could argue that this was made up by Jeremy to convince Verity)\n\nThe last handwritten letter seemed like a desperate attempt to disprove the manuscript.\n\nJulia This may sound dumb but why did verity write the manuscript? Maybe she was just trynna get it off her chest but surely no one as smart as she was would write that kinda stuff down! And to have it online where police and any hackers can access it, but to also print it and and hide it, but she also FORGOT WHERE SHE PUT IT. I get she had just been in a car crash but i feel like she should've been smarter than that.\n\nNot only that, i personally am team manuscript. No mother could write something that horrible in such detail about her life. I still think the letter was meant for Lowen because why would she spend so much time writing about how Jeremy tried to kill her if he was meant to find it (he obviously experienced that event so he knew what happened). No idea really but absolutely love this book!\n\nMatthew Korgan Verity has no credibility. The one thing we know for sure is that she faked her condition, which she did because she is a psychopath that saw it as a way to continue controlling Jeremy.\n\nHer defense that she was afraid of prison rings hollow. The lady is rich. She can hire a fleet of expensive defense lawyers and use the editor lady who allegedly gave her the idea as a witness.\n\nIn fact the letter itself and the doubt it creates in the reader is why killing her was justified.\n\nDeepak Sahu i dont think that the manuscript was the truth. i think she actaully wrote that in order to hide her pain in pages because if a women who killed her daughter and was so cruel to the infants and who can fake her death is a no sweat to harm lowen and her husband in order to save herself but she didnt even after knowing that now lowen knows about the manuscript even she could have destroyed it earlier as she knows that is the only way to reveal what she really is. but she didnt i think she actually lost her memories and as she didnt harm lowen after getting so many chances i think the letter was right. anyways, you can never understand the mind of a writer.\n\nSahba i thought about this for a long time and ig im team letter.Lowen wanted to \"be\" like verity to write like her,but in order to do that,she read the manuscript but if manuscript was written from prospective of \"The Villain\" verity,as she said in the letter so that means this whole time Lowen was trying to be like the Villain not the true verity and in my opinion this whole love or obsession Lowen has over jeremy it's because she tried too much to be like the Villain and she just got lost the process.that's the real reason she wanted to kill verity.and honestly i can't find any reason for verity to do all of this to her kids because we know nothing about her past and i don't think you wake up one day and become a psycho.but Jeremy and Lowen at least had some reasons to be crazy and try to kill someone.i think Jeremy just wanted to blame someone for her daughter's death cause that makes it easier to get along with the pain of grief.\n\nNafees Wajid Ali Hello all.\n\nI have read many comments here in the favour of manuscript over the letter. But in my opinion letter could have been the genuine one. The reason being that if Verity would have commit such horrendous crimes, why the hell would she accept those by typing it as her autobiography on her laptop and moreover printing it too. If a criminal does a crime he might leave hints of his crime unknowingly but no one writes a manuscript of their own crimes and then waits for it to be read by the police only to get arrested. In my opinion, the manuscript just had been a way to excel her writing skills.\n\nCourtney I don't believe the letter is the truth. It was stated directly from Jeremy that he didn't want to read any of Verity's work so why would he choose to read the manuscript? I think the first time he read it was when Lowen compelled him to read it.\n\nTrista I have a thought, really out there, but what if, Lowen had a mental break after losing her mother and then the person dying in front of her(which resulted in her being covered in blood) caused her to lose it? So a handsome man helps her, also happens to be the reason for the meeting(he read her book not Verity), and her getting a large contract to do what she loves and she picks a famous author. But Lowen is a writer, a creative writer in the dark genre, so she has to have darkness and an antagonist. The “bad guy” being someone popular in the same field. She creates this story where she gets everything she wants and saves the day. Obviously, a little far fetched, but what if …. 🤨\n\nelianna k The manuscript was definitely the truth. If you take a look back at the earlier chapters, Verity’s father said something along the lines of “God punishes the evil”. Plus I don’t believe for a second that Chastin’s scar (or was it Harper’s I’m not quite sure) was because they’re two kids in one womb. It was definitely from the hanger mentioned in V’s manuscript.\n\nMegan Guys i know this isn’t the case.. but imagine if Jeremy told lowen the story of he and verity’s relationship, and then lowen wrote the manuscripts in her sleep without knowing because she was insane or something. like imagine how different and crazy the ending would be\n\nIbtesaam Im very pathetically confused rn i might need some time to digest it. If we believe the manuscript to be true— Verity as mentioned in the letter wrote this on the day when the door was locked and stuff and that was the same day when Lowen said to Verity \"I hope you die with a throat.... Infant daughter\" - Verity might have panicked and tried to cover her shit and also in the letter if it was for Jeremy why was it mentioned— the car incident — as if it for a third person and not for Jeremy.\n\nIf we believe that the letter was true— we remember Jeremy once said he was angry at Verity — the night they first hugged. And then when Lowen showed Jeremy the manuscript he was like 'where did you find this' and not 'what is this'— and also as Lowen mentioned he didn't take much time to read it as if he already had read them and was just trying to pretend to read and before Verity could do anything he kills her— i mean how why! Why would you want to kill her i mean i understand but why kill her your self instead of calling the police. And also hiding the manuscript like wtf\n\nNancy Clayton I was almost annoyed. I felt like the ending was a throw away. Very disappointing because I did enjoy the book until the ending\n\nFay Sukparangsee ok at first i was unsure but then after reading these comments, signs are really pointing towards the fact that the manuscript is true. even in the book, verity states herself that she is good at covering up/lying or manipulating the truth whatever, when she was talking to her husband, trying to come up with excuses. and sure, it can be part of her \"act\" but the more i think about it, the more it doesn't add up: her son being so fearful of talking about her, jeremy letting her stay in the house, and her publisher, amber, not saying a thing about it to laura.\n\nMim Just finished reading the book and wow!! I honestly believe thay Verity is a manipulative character from the beginning to the end of the story, I mean like if the manuscripts were just an exercise how can we explain the cut on Chastin's face??\n\ngracia no mother would ever be able to even think about the terrible things she wrote about her children. you can’t just write that like it’s nothing. the manuscript has to be real, and we know that verity is incredible at manipulating situations in her writings, so the letter could be simply her just manipulating what truly happened. also Chastins scar had to be from the result of a attempted miscarriage. we will never know!\n\nivy Just finished the book and I don’t know what to believe anymore.\n\nAddison i feel like the manuscript was the real version of the truth. yes verity was an amazing thriller author but you could tell in the letter lowen found how scared and rushed she sounded to write and try to make \"Jeffrey\" believe she didn't do anything she said, verity knew lowen was reading the manuscript, Lowen told her too her face what she knew and told her too her face she was going to be with Jeffrey. verity panicked, started writing one last manipulative lie to try to mess with lowen once again. i don't believe Jeffrey did the whole car accident thing on purpose, i think verity got scared because the same night Jeffrey questioned her judgment for the very first time. that is why she stayed faking her condition, she was scared. she was rushed, she was a manipulative wife, and a terrible mother.\n\nShaikh Shumaila Jeremy confessed to lowen that he didn't feel the connection with verity and also she was not really closed or understand Harper this could mean she killed her because but also why would a murderer kill someone and write about it\n\nSharon Brand What an end for real. I don't have the words. Came on here right as I finished to see what everybody is thinking - What a great book!"
