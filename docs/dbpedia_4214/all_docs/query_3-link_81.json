        "text": "Reed College Professor Darius Rejali is one of the world’s leading thinkers and writers on the subject of torture and the consequences of its use for modern society. Princeton University Press has just published his magisterial study of torture and how it has developed as a social and moral issue with a focus on developments through the last century. Rejali tracks the question in many different settings and societies–from Athens in its golden age to the French colonial wars, totalitarian states in the mid-twentieth century, down to America in the Age of George W. Bush. I put six questions to Rejali about his book and its relevance to the current debate in the United States.\n\n1. Your new book, âTorture and Democracy,â reflects a lengthy\n\nengagement with the subject of torture as a phenomenon over a vast\n\nstretch of time and among many different societies. But in the preface,\n\nyou start by relating something about your own background as an\n\nIranian-American, trying to understand how torture was transforming Iran\n\nand complicating its evolution in modern times. Did developments in Iran\n\nlead you to this subject? In what ways do you think torture has\n\naffected the political culture of Iran and its extremely awkward\n\nrelations with the rest of the world?\n\nMost people think torture is a barbaric survivor and that it would\n\ndisappear over time with progress. This is a mistake, and my experience\n\ngrowing up in Iran taught me that and led me to write Torture and\n\nModernity: Self, State and Society in Iran (1994). I used Iran to show\n\nthat while old ritualistic, public torture would disappear over time,\n\nother tortures would survive and new techniques would appear, letâs call\n\nthese modern torture.\n\nI remember one distinguished expert who reviewed my work said,\n\nbasically, how can Rejali say torture is part of modernity? If that was\n\ntrue, America would torture too. It really was amazing, in retrospect,\n\nhow willfully blind people wanted to be. I grew up in Iran at a time\n\nwhen the Shahâs secret police, the SAVAK, did not hesitate torturing\n\nIslamic and Marxist insurgents. No one thought torture was something\n\nincompatible with cars, fast food, washing machines and other parts of\n\nmodern life. I remember talking to a high-ranking SAVAK officer years\n\nafter the Shah was gone, and he certainly felt he played an important\n\nrole in modernization. It wasnât the last time Iâve heard torturers say\n\nhow important they are in making their country safe for economic\n\nopportunity.\n\nAnother point: Everyone forgets that the Iranian revolution of 1978-1979\n\nwas the revolution against torture. When the Shah criticized Khomayni as\n\na blackrobed Islamic medieval throwback, Khomayni replied, look who is\n\ntalking, the man who tortures. This was powerful rhetoric for\n\nrecruiting people, then as it is now. People joined the revolutionary\n\nopposition because of the Shahâs brutality, and they remembered who\n\ninstalled him. If anyone wants to know why Iranians hated the US so,\n\nall they have to do is ask what Americaâs role was in promoting torture\n\nin Iran. Torture not only shaped the revolution, it was the factor that\n\nhas deeply poisoned the relationship of Iran with the West. So why trust\n\nthe West again? And the Iranian leadership doesnât.\n\n2. One of the themes that circulates through your book is that we are\n\nmistaken in attaching torture only to non-democratic states; your\n\nspecial focus is on how democratic states use torture, and you give\n\nexamples stretching from Athens in the golden age to America under\n\nGeorge W. Bush, but with France in its waning colonial phase as perhaps\n\nthe best illustration of them all. But isnât it the case that modern\n\ndemocratic concepts rest on the rejection of torture? I think back to\n\nfigures like Voltaire. When he describes torture in great detail and\n\nattacks its crudeness, its stupidityâas in his brilliant description of\n\nthe cruel execution of the 19-year-old chevalier de La Barreâhe seems to\n\nbe making a political statement by it. This system, he says, does not\n\nvalue the worth of the individual human being, and indeed that is the\n\nessence of its tyranny. Conversely the post-Enlightenment democracies\n\ntook rejection of torture as an element of their identity, as we saw in\n\nWashingtonâs orders, or as the first article of the German Grundgesetz,\n\nwhich states, âThe dignity of the human being is inviolable. The respect\n\nand protection of that dignity is the obligation of all state power.â\n\nLeaving aside the differing concept of democracy in classical antiquity,\n\ndo you not see a fundamental crisis of identity with a democratic state\n\nthat adopts and uses torture?\n\nTorture involves giving absolute power by one individual over\n\nanother. Our founders knew that absolute power corrupts absolutely and\n\nthat we shouldnât even trust ourselves with absolute power. That is why\n\nthey promoted limited government in politics, toleration of minorities\n\nin social life, and dignity in our relations with strangers. The\n\nhistory of slavery teaches us that this kind of power corrupts society,\n\nand history of torture shows how badly it damages states. Thomas\n\nHobbes, whose national security credentials are impeccable, says it\n\nquite clearly in The Leviathan: âAccusations upon torture, are not to be\n\nreputed as testimoniesâ for what each prisoner confesses âtendeth to the\n\nease of him that is tortured, not to the informing of the torturers.â\n\nPeople will say anything under torture to ease pain, says Hobbes, and\n\nthis as far as he concerned, corrupted the judicial process and made all\n\nof us unsafe.\n\nTorture may be compatible with democracy, but it is not compatible with\n\nliberalism, and we live in liberal democracies today. What I document\n\nin Torture and Democracy, is how modern liberal democratic states try to\n\nget around violating the dignity of others by becoming hypocrites. To\n\nthis end, they use a lot of techniques that are physically painful, but\n\ndonât leave marks. A prisoner who doesnât have marks is simply not\n\ncredible when he makes the accusation of torture. So now they can say,\n\nâThere was no torture see? So go home now.â Instead of embracing the\n\nideals of dignity and freedom, states become cleverer in methods of\n\noppression and deception. As John Locke said brilliantly in his Letter\n\nConcerning Toleration, a state that tortures is always a state of\n\nhypocrites. I also document how authoritarian states became cleaner in\n\ntheir torture as liberalism developed into a worldwide human rights\n\nmovement after World War II. These dictators, especially our allies,\n\nrealized their legitimacy and foreign aid, depended on being clean.\n\nHypocrisy isnât just a monopoly of democratic states.\n\nThe good news here is that liberal democratic leaders actually care\n\nenough about legitimacy that they fear clear outrages will cause people,\n\nthe voters, to do something about it. If they didnât, scarring tortures\n\nwould still be common. So when we watch them, they get sneaky. Could\n\nthings get worse? Sure. Locke believed that history was committed to\n\nliberalismâs triumph, but the question today is whether history will\n\neven tolerate liberalism surviving into the twenty second century.\n\nEverywhere, blind nationalism seems to threaten liberalism. Documenting\n\nclean torture in this respect is like the canary in the coal mine. As\n\nlong as torture remains clean â and so far it has â it means that\n\ngovernment leaders know that people are watching, and I find that hopeful.\n\n3. In America today, the debate seems to focus on the efficacy of\n\ntortureâwhether it is a useful tool for getting at the truth. You note\n\nthe flow from the Roman Ulpian, who accepts torture as something quite\n\nnormal to be used in interrogation (though he does at some points\n\nexpress skepticism about its usefulness) to Cesare Beccaria, whose\n\nmonumental denunciation of torture did so much to influence European\n\nideas about torture and criminal justice in the eighteenth century. But\n\ntoday we seem stuck in a debate in which those who use torture are eager\n\nto try to justify themselves but unwilling to let a bright light shine\n\ninto their conduct, ostensibly for national security reasons, though\n\nmany will inevitably suspect that secrecy is driven by concerns for\n\ntheir own culpability. You offer up a very lengthy and nuanced\n\ndiscussion on the efficacy of torture, and in your Washington Post\n\ncolumn on five myths you have pulled some chestnuts out of it. One of\n\nthem is that âpeople will say anything under torture.â But isnât the\n\nclaim rather the way Shakespeare put it in act III of the âMerchant of\n\nVenice,’ that people will say what they think the torturer wants them to\n\nsay? And doesnât that explain why societies that put a premium on\n\nconfessions like torture to extract them, and why al-Libi told the CIA\n\nabout Saddam Husseinâs non-existent WMD plans? Donât you think that the\n\nefficacy discussion has to address the broader consequences that a\n\ndecision to use torture has to reputation, and conversely to the ability\n\nof a terrorist foe to recruit?\n\nYes, I do. During the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the Shahâs torture\n\nwas the best recruiting tool the opposition had. Prisons were places\n\nwhere prisoners met each other and professionalized their skills, as I\n\nand others have documented. It feels like a nightmare watching American\n\npoliticians make the same mistake as the Shah. I like to believe that\n\nwith every mistake we must surely be learning, but sometimes it is hard\n\nto believe.\n\nWhen I talked about people under torture saying anything, I was\n\nespecially interested in the cases where torturers interrogate for true\n\ninformation. Thatâs what I document doesnât work. But it seems pretty\n\nclear that torture works to generate false confessions, which serve\n\nequally as well as true confessions for many state purposes. When judges\n\nand juries value confessions as decisive proof, police are happy to\n\ngenerate confessions for convictions. This can happen in domestic\n\ncrime, as it happened in Chicago in the 1980s where African Americans\n\nwere sentenced to death on the basis of coerced confessions. Theyâre\n\nalso good for international show trials, trials that exonerate the\n\nstateâs failures. Stalin wanted show trials to demonstrate that\n\nterrorists and saboteurs caused his failures, and he wasnât the last\n\nleader who liked show trials to vindicate his decisions. And lastly,\n\nstates use false confessions as blackmail to turn prisoners into\n\nunwilling informants. Torture allows one to collect dependent and\n\ninsular individuals, spreading a net of fear across a population. This\n\ncan happen locally (as in a ghetto) or in a whole state, like East Germany.\n\nItâs also true that torturers often hear what they want to hear. In fact\n\nthatâs one of the big problems with torture that I document in the book\n\nand the âFive Mythsâ article. Even if torture could actually break a\n\nperson and they told you the truth, the torturer has to recognize it was\n\nthe truth, and too often that doesnât happen because torturers come into\n\na situation with their own assumptions and donât believe the victim.\n\nMoreover, intelligence gathering is especially vulnerable to deception.\n\nIn police work, the crime is already known; all one wants is the\n\nconfession. In intelligence, one must gather information about things\n\nthat one does not know.\n\nAnd letâs remember, torturers arenât chosen for intelligence; they are\n\nchosen for devotion and loyalty, and they are terrible at spotting the\n\ntruth when they see it. In the âFive Mythsâ piece I talk about how the\n\nChilean secret service lost valuable information in that way when they\n\nbroke Sheila Cassidy, an English doctor, and she told them everything\n\nbut they didnât believe her. And one can just repeat dozens of stories\n\nlike this. My favorite is when Senator John McCain tried to explain the\n\nconcept of Easter to his North Vietnamese torturer. âWe believe there\n\nwas a guy who walked the earth, did great things, was killed and three\n\ndays later, he rose from the dead and went up to heaven.â His\n\ninterrogator was puzzled and asked him to explain it again and again. He\n\nleft, and when he came back, he was angry and threatened to beat him.\n\nAmericans couldnât possibly believe in âEasterâ since no one lives\n\nagain; McCain had to be making this up.\n\n4. You talk about a ânational security modelâ for torture and discuss\n\nin particular the way the French adopted torture to use in the Algerian\n\nwar and how they reconciled this with a legal regime which condemned\n\ntorture. I was most taken by the discussion of the judicial aspect.\n\nAllegations of torture, you report, were referred to a specific\n\nexamining magistrate, Jacques Batigne, who served as a dead-letter\n\noffice. You also point how the democratic process failed to engage this,\n\nin part because the leftist opposition was so badly discredited with its\n\nown Stalinist torture baggage. The analysis you present seems to me to\n\nclosely parallel what Albert Camus writes in his diary, the âChroniques\n\nalgÃ©riennes,â in which he dwells very heavily on torture and how it\n\ncorrupted Franceâs democratic process. In America today, the Bush\n\nAdministration seems to have developed its own repertoire of legal\n\ntricks. Judges refuse to consider torture cases by noting that immunity\n\nof public officials precludes them, or state secrets, or some\n\ncombination of the two. And we recently saw Michael Mukasey tell us\n\nthat because opinions had been given by the Office of Legal Counsel\n\nwhich declared torture techniques lawful, the use of those techniques\n\ncould not be criminally investigated. It seems very close to the French\n\napproach. But assuming the political process produces a change to an\n\nanti-torture political leadership, what are the prospects for a\n\ndemocratic society going back and holding torturers to account? Have\n\nyou given that any systematic study?\n\nStopping torture is actually the easiest part; the harder part is\n\nundoing the long-term damage. To stop torture, all one really needs is\n\nclear leadership that spells clear rules and punishes the slightest\n\nviolations of the rules. It also protects whistleblowers, and requires\n\nregular and open medical inspection, not to mention fair and open trials\n\nfor all prisoners. This was the way we stopped most torture in the US\n\nin the 1940s and 1950s after three or four decades of abysmal police\n\ntorture in America, in cities both large and small.\n\nTorture casts a very long shadow. When a state tortures, many decent\n\nprofessionals retire, leaving the police forces, the military and the\n\nintelligence services in disgust. So those who stayed behind create a\n\nculture of impunity. Torture also has a powerful deprofessionalizing\n\nethic, damaging other intelligence efforts. Why do the hard work of\n\nusing proper police and interrogation techniques when youâve got a bat?.\n\nConsidering that most recent whistleblowers have had to hide in fear,\n\nincluding the man who revealed the Abu Ghraib tortures, it will be\n\ndifficult to recruit good people to do this work. How can you prevent\n\nwaste or fraud, much less torture, if you are not going to protect\n\nwhistleblowers? You canât.\n\nAmericans think in the fantasy terms of Jack Bauer and ticking time\n\nbombs, while our hospitals fill with soldiers who clearly are suffering\n\nthe traumatic side effects of being involved in torture, what is now\n\ncalled âperpetrator induced traumatic stress.â Americans seem less\n\nwilling to acknowledge what our nation asked them to do than fund what\n\nis needed for their recovery. Fifty years after the Algerian War, the\n\nFrench have thousands of soldiers in therapy including their DOPS\n\ninterrogators who are described as âspiritually wounded men, often\n\nravaged by the weight of their guilt and shame.â We have yet to\n\nacknowledge that, much less the damage to victims and innocents we tortured.\n\nA lot of people want trials, not just trials for those who did terrible\n\nthings but also trials for those who had command responsibility and\n\nshould have, and could have, prevented torture. And nothing predicts\n\nfuture torture quite like past impunity. But trials are an imperfect\n\nsolution. They can deeply divide a society. The Argentine government\n\ntried the generals, but when it tried notorious junior officers\n\nresponsible for torture, it faced a series of rebellions. And we\n\ncertainly need to have a final open accounting of what was done, but\n\ntruth commissions also have a mixed history, sometimes helping and other\n\ntimes promoting amnesia.\n\nI would like to think that changing leaders will make a difference. But\n\nthen remember, I lived through a revolution where the most important\n\nthing was to throw out the Shah and stop torture. The irony is that it\n\ndidnât stop. Changing leaders doesnât automatically change torture. In\n\nfact, states usually change their interrogation practices after wars,\n\nnot during them or when leaders change. This is what happened in Iran.\n\nPeople are too scared in wars and uncertain in crises, so they\n\nrepeatedly reach for the same techniques that the people they opposed used.\n\nBut having said that, it is possible to change course in mid-war\n\nsuccessfully. As I show in Torture and Democracy, the Battle of Algiers\n\nturned in favor of the French only after Paul Aussaresses, who ran the\n\ntorture policy, was replaced by the very smart and canny Col. Yves\n\nGodard, and it was his informants, not Aussaressesâ torture policy, that\n\ngave the French the big breaks they needed. Goddard knew how\n\nintelligence really worked.\n\nSo it can be done. And whoever does it is going to have the backing of\n\nthe American people. Every scientific national poll Iâve looked at since\n\n9/11, for example, shows consistently anti-torture majorities in\n\nAmerica. This number hasnât varied, always hovering between 55 to 65%\n\nopposition, and includes both Republicans and Democrats. When pollsters\n\nask not about âtortureâ in general but specific techniques like\n\nwaterboarding, the opposition spikes to 80% opposed even if there is a\n\nticking time bomb. What best predicts whether youâre for torture turns\n\nout not to be a partisan issue, though there is a slight Republican\n\ntrend. What predicts whether youâre for torture best is if you approve\n\nof President Bushâs policies; basically itâs a loyalty vote. The\n\nprotorture folk have always â and I mean always, in every poll Iâve seen\n\nâ been a minority of 35-45% and Iâm pretty sure the number is shrinking\n\nas the Presidentâs approval numbers dip.\n\nSo the good news is that opponents of torture are not alone. I suspect\n\npeople think the majority of Americans are for torture, but this just\n\nisnât supported by any of the polling. Itâs just hype from partisan\n\nmedia, talking heads, and the politicians. The real truth is that there\n\nis intelligence out there. What it requires is for government to tap\n\ninto it and start using it.\n\n5. In the United States, the debate seems to be increasingly focused\n\non waterboarding, which I suspect youâll agree doesnât really present\n\nany serious questions on the definitional front. Obviously it is\n\ntorture. But there are other techniques which are much more problematic.\n\nOne is the sensory-deprivation/sensory-overload technique associated\n\nwith Kubark. Waterboarding has not been used frequently, at least\n\naccording to General Hayden, but the sensory-deprivation technique seems\n\nto have developed into something close to standard operating procedure,\n\nand was even used on a U.S. citizen, Jose Padilla. A psychologist who\n\nevaluated him says he was essentially destroyed as a self-actuated human\n\nbeing, capable of independent thought and direction. Is the Bush\n\nAdministration accomplishing a sort of victory by keeping the debate\n\nfocused on waterboarding while avoiding discussion of the techniques\n\nmore commonly employed?\n\nYes, thatâs right. The historical record is clear. Waterboarding is\n\ntorture, and yes focusing on just waterboarding is a distraction.\n\nWaterboarding is serious, but only the tip of the iceberg. There have\n\nonly been three documented cases of waterboarding, but the CIA has\n\nsubjected at least 30 others to âenhanced interrogationâ as Director\n\nHayden says, so there are other kinds of techniques as well. And there\n\nare unaccounted prisoners last seen in US custody as well as secret\n\nprisons out there where these things continue to happen.\n\nOne day weâll know more, but the historical record now shows that\n\nAmerican interrogators and soldiers, whether authorized or not, have\n\nused forced standing, forced kneeling, sleep deprivation, exposure to\n\nextremes of heat and cold, beatings on the soles of the feet, sexual\n\nhumiliation, and psychological coercion, as well as some cases,\n\nelectrotorture. So it would be a mistake then to confuse the forest from\n\nthe three tallest trees in it. Waterboarding highlights the huge dangers\n\nof torture, but it is only the beginning of political literacy not the\n\nend of it.\n\nAnd the same applies to domestic policing. Iâm less worried about our\n\npolice learning how to waterboard criminals than I am with the use of\n\nstun guns and tasers. Any inspector would wonder what straps and a\n\nbucket of water would be doing in an interrogation room, and investigate\n\nfor torture. But they canât prohibit police from using stun guns and\n\ntasers, which have authorized police uses, and it is very hard for them\n\nto tell when these devices have been used illegally to torture, as they\n\nleave few marks.\n\nLastly, I think we need to understand that torture just doesnât hide in\n\na vault in the CIA. It hides in all the dark pockets of society â\n\nmilitary barracks, schools, frat houses, our supermax prisons and\n\nimmigration lockups. When torture happens, the top authorizes, and the\n\npeople at the bottom come running with the techniques. Vigilance has to\n\nextend far beyond our intelligence agencies to all these other areas.\n\nMost dangerously, I think we need to pay attention to our new culture of\n\nirresponsibility. We live now in an age where something is or is not\n\ntorture depending on when and who it is done to. Zapping an angry\n\nbusinessman on an airplane cabin will be called torture, but zapping a\n\nforeigner might just be good security and completely excusable. This is\n\nbad. All my students at Reed have good intentions, but they donât all\n\ndeserve A’s because what they do matters regardless of their intention.\n\nYet police and intelligence officers, not to mention politicians, want\n\nto get As just because they had good intentions. They want to be\n\nexonerated for having done no torture at all; itâs only torture if they\n\nhad bad intentions. And that is very dangerous and irresponsible because\n\njudging people solely on their intentions, as William Blake said, is the\n\nroad to hell.\n\n6. This week Congress will again take up the intelligence bill, and\n\nthe proposal to clarify that the ban on torture accepted by the\n\nuniformed services is applicable to all U.S. actors, including the\n\nintelligence community. Of course, the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005\n\nalready says that, but the Bush Administration has apparently developed\n\nits own secret understanding to the contrary. Part of the argument that\n\nhas been made in favor of this measure is that the idea of\n\ncompartmentalization or limitation of torture doesnât work, that once it\n\nis known that certain techniques are being used they spread, or\n\nâmigrateâ in the language of the Armyâs Faye-Jones Report. You seem to\n\nchart the same sort of migration many times in your study. Are the\n\nproponents of the torture ban correct on this?\n\nYes, torture does migrate, and there are some good examples of it\n\nboth in American and French history. The basic idea here is that\n\nsoldiers who get ahead torturing come back and take jobs as policemen,\n\nand private security, and they get ahead doing the same things they did\n\nin the army. And so torture comes home. Everyone knows waterboarding,\n\nbut no one remembers that it was American soldiers coming back from the\n\nPhilippines that introduced it to police in the early twentieth century.\n\nDuring the Philippine Insurgency in 1902, soldiers learned the old\n\nSpanish technique of using water tortures, and soon these same\n\ntechniques appeared in police stations, especially throughout the South,\n\nas well as in military lockups during World War I. Likewise, the\n\nelectrical techniques used in Vietnam appeared in the 1960s appeared in\n\ntorturing African Americans on the south side of Chicago in the 1970s\n\nand 1980s, and, as I argue in the book, that wasnât just an accident.\n\nSo torture always comes home. And the techniques of this war are likely\n\nto show up in a neighborhood near you. Likewise, the techniques that\n\nappeared in the War on Terror were already documented in INS lockups in\n\nMiami in the 1990s. There is no bright line between domestic and foreign\n\ntorture; the stuff circulates.\n\nYes, I am opposed to two track systems, where one group of people can\n\ntorture and the other people canât. And it is not hard to understand\n\nwhy. Suppose youâre an interrogator who is not allowed to use some\n\ntechnique, but the guy from the Other Governmental Agency can. What is\n\nmore, you believe that these techniques work. So why should you be stuck\n\nusing techniques that are slow and time consuming, when the guy from the\n\nOGA can get good results and win all the glory? Arenât you just an\n\nidiot for sticking to the rules? Of course not, and so torture will\n\nspread, and that slippery slope is a lot slicker in counterinsurgency\n\nconflicts than in domestic policing, as I show in the book.\n\nThere are good reasons to believe that whatever these âenhanced\n\ntechniques areâ they will seep into other agencies and organizations.\n\nAnd since many of these techniques leave no marks, it will be impossible\n\nto prove that they were even used. We saw this pattern in Iraq and\n\nAfghanistan, where soldiers reported having learned their interrogation\n\ntechniques by imitating CIA field officers.\n\nSo I think it is only a matter of time now before new rot sets into the\n\nUS military thanks to the two track system our government has endorsed.\n\nThis is inevitable when you codify two track interrogation systems into\n\nlaw. In the 1970s, the Brazilian military had a similar system, and the\n\nstate had to turn on and kill its torturers in order to preserve itself.\n\nAs the Brazilian journalist Elio Gaspari observed at the time, âUnless\n\neveryone in the army participates in torture, you very quickly develop\n\ntwo kinds of soldiers.â He call them âthe combatants,â who fight the\n\nterrorists with torture, and the âbureaucrats,â who are committed to\n\npreserving the militaryâs everyday functioning and discipline. In\n\nBrazil, the day came when the combatant-torturers refused to accept the\n\norders of the bureaucrats and regarded with contempt their peers who\n\nwere committed to army disciplines. The generals reluctantly concluded\n\nthat the âtorturers were going to have to be isolated, marginalized, and\n\neliminated, so as to save the Army.â"
