        "text": "So this isn’t exactly a Masterpost. Good sources on torture are hard to find and it’s not always obvious what they cover. I’ve had a couple of people recommend fictional titles in the comments and while fiction can be helpful for working out how to handle torture in stories it is rarely accurate and no substitute for factual sources.\n\nI thought it might be helpful to give everyone a quick run down of the sources I’ve found most useful and what they cover.\n\nThis may well be edited in the future as I find more books. :)\n\nTorture and Democracy by D Rejali\n\nThis is basically the book on torture.\n\nIt’s the size of a breezeblock.\n\nRejali covers torturers and victims, provides a systematic breakdown of why torture fails, gives a history of electrical torture, an analysis of factors that encourage torture in society and an overview of how the law fails torture victims. Interrogation is extensively covered.\n\nThis book covers torture in the modern era globally and in that area it is very thorough. Historical torture is not extensively covered.\n\nBut for a thorough understanding of the topic and modern torture, Rejali is a must.\n\nWhy Torture Doesn’t Work: The Neuroscience of Interrogation by S O’Mara\n\nO’Mara’s book is much more focused on science than Rejali’s. It is a point by point analysis of some of the most common ‘clean’ (ie non-scarring) torture techniques used today, explaining exactly how harmful they are and debunking claims that they’re not ‘real’ torture.\n\nO’Mara’s speciality is the brain and he uses his knowledge to show the biological under-pinings of why torture can not work.\n\nAn excellent source on torture generally and a brilliant explanation of how pain, memory and distress work. This is useful for writing any traumatic event but doesn’t cover a wide range of torture techniques and is very Western-focused in its approach.\n\nCruel Britannia: A Secret History of Torture by I Cobain\n\nWhile I have some problems with Cobain’s book he remains an excellent source.\n\nMy problems are pretty simple, Cobain’s a journalist not a scholar and he often allows apologist arguments to creep into his book. He often takes torturers’ word for it and believes them when they suggest that valuable information can come from torture.\n\nRejali and O’Mara will tell you why that’s wrong.\n\nBut the interviews in this book are incredibly valuable. Cobain interviews victims and torturers and sets them in a wider political context, showing how governments have supported or ignored torture.\n\nHis interviews on the London Cage and the collected work on Ireland, Aden, Cyprus and the Mau-Mau is well worth a look for anyone interested in those conflicts in particular or the British ‘National Style’ of torture in general.\n\nSourcebook on Solitary Confinement by S Shalev\n\nShalev’s Sourcebook is a free resource that’s available online and an excellent break down of the damage solitary confinement causes.\n\nWhile this is obviously focused on one technique this Sourcebook contains pretty much all the information you could want on solitary.\n\nThe majority of the data comes from US prisons and the book is obviously biased towards confinement in a prison context. But the discussion of symptoms, risk factors and long term effects makes this utterly invaluable.\n\nAny author who writes about solitary confinement or isolation should consult at least the second chapter.\n\nMao’s Great Famine by F Dikötter\n\nOne of the best books on famine in print.\n\nThe style is somewhat impersonal, but I think that works in its favour. The focus is essentially on how widespread famine can occur rather than how starvation affects the individual.\n\nThe discussion on community and the role of enforcers is particularly good.\n\nI’d recommend it for anyone writing a large-scale natural disaster or atrocity.\n\nAmnesty International Reports (Annual 2016/2017)\n\nAmnesty’s annual reports give good concise updates on torture globally, year by year. They are freely available online and generally contain a lot of survivor accounts.\n\nIt can be difficult to find specific information using them. You can not, for example, tell from the summaries whether particular techniques are covered. They rarely contain follow-ups on survivors and so are not a good resource for the recovery process.\n\nBut the accounts of survivors, in their own words, are invaluable.\n\nWorld Food Programme\n\nAn excellent resource on starvation and malnutrition. If you want to know how a starving or malnourished character would be treated or recover this is probably the best free resource you can find.\n\nVery good for physical effects and for descriptions of disaster relief programs. Not so great on survivor accounts or giving an idea of what starvation feels like on a personal level.\n\nInternational Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims\n\nIf you’ve been following my blog for a while you may have heard of these guys. Not only do they work to support torture victims but they also publish a free online journal dedicated to helping survivors recover.\n\nRather academic and dense, this material often requires a lot of effort and engagement. This is very much the academic side. It can be incredibly helpful, but it’s not always easy to find the information you’re after.\n\nA Darkling Plain by K R Monroe\n\nA collection of interviews with survivors of a wide range of atrocities, Monroe’s book shows a real range of both traumatic events and responses to them.\n\nThe main focus of the book is how people move on with their lives after atrocities and how they hold on to their sense of humanity. As such it’s incredibly useful to authors whose writing touches on these themes and authors who want to include a wider range of realistic responses to traumatic events.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nThe Wretched of the Earth by F Fanon\n\nThe appendix contains some of Fanon’s notes on people he treated during the Franco-Algerian war.\n\nThese notes include two torturers, a family member of a torturer, victims and relatives of victims.\n\nThis is still one of the most valuable readily accessible sources on torturers’ behaviour.\n\nThe Question by H Alleg\n\nAlleg’s account of torture during the Franco-Algerian war is a classic for a reason. This is a lucid, often harrowing account of torture failing from a victim’s perspective.\n\nI talk about victims refusing to cooperate. Alleg describes what it feels like from the inside.\n\nI strongly advise anyone writing from a victim’s perspective to read this book.\n\nWe Wish to Inform you that Tomorrow we will be Killed with our Families by P Gourevitch\n\nThe Rwandan genocide. This book provides both an overview of the events, interviews with survivors and transcripts/quotes from the time period.\n\nA difficult but important book, and extremely useful for writing conflict and war crimes.\n\nA History of Torture by G R Scott\n\nThis book was written in the 30s and boy does it read like it was.\n\nThe casual racism and sexism is extreme and off putting however this remains one of the most thorough books on historical torture globally. Just…read it with a critical eye.\n\nTo the Kwai and Back by R Searle\n\nThis collection of war drawings is, in my opinion, Searle’s best and most affecting work.\n\nThey chronicle Searle’s experience of the Second World War as a prisoner of the Japanese. The drawings document torture, starvation, forced labour and death marches and are interspersed with Searle’s commentary and memories.\n\nThe book serves as both a survivor’s account and (as Searle is looking back) a discussion of how he as an individual recovered. It serves as a very good source on large-scale atrocities seen from a personal perspective.\n\nNonviolence: The History of a Dangerous Idea by M Kurlansky\n\nThe focus of this work is in the title but torture crops up in this wide ranging historical narrative time and time again.\n\nIt won’t be relevant to everyone’s stories, but I’m including this book for its numerous moving examples of people across cultures and history resisting torture, slavery and genocide without violence. We have very few fictional examples of this kind of action, and the history is rarely remembered.\n\nI want you, my readers, to be aware of as many sources as possible so you can break the mould if you want to.\n\nTell Me Where I Can Be Safe: Human Rights Watch report on LGBTQ Rights in Nigeria\n\nThis is a pretty harrowing read containing a lot of rape and sexual violence as well as torture. Victim accounts are prominent and the report only covers a relatively recent period in one country.\n\nI include this because my reading strongly suggests that it is typical of anti-LGBTQ violence across much of Africa and the Middle East. The methods and tactics used crop up across multiple countries and have been known to occur in Europe (though Gay and Trans Rights legislation has helped combat such violence).\n\nAs a result I think this is a very valuable resource for writing torture and abuse of LGBTQ people specifically and an extremely important resource for Western writers who wish to write LGBTQ characters who are not from the West.\n\nThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by R Skloot\n\nAn incredibly valuable overview of unethical experimentation in modern America.\n\nWhile far from a complete survey this book covers unconsenting or uninformed experimentation on minors, mental health patients, black people and prisoners.\n\nIt talks about how experiments were conducted, how subjects were chosen and the effect on both the victims and their families.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who wishes to write unethical experimentation.\n\nThe Horrible Histories Series by T Deary and M Brown\n\nYes these are children’s books and yes I am sure they deserve a place here.\n\nWith their focus on the ‘gruesome bits’ of history these books generally contain quick and accurate overviews of historical tortures. Descriptions of punishments, methods of execution and medical treatments at the time are present in almost all of these short, accessible books.\n\nThe focus is on English history as such there’s a lot that isn’t covered, but they’re very good for getting a sense of the tortures that were used during different historical periods quickly and easily.\n\nMen and Hunger: a psychological manual for relief workers by H S Guetzkow, P H Bowman, A Keys, 1946 (The Minnesota Starvation Experiment)\n\nThis is not the full text but the 70 page summary sent out to relief workers immediately following the experiment. This covers all the important psychological and physical effects of starvation in enough detail for an author writing a starving character to find it extremely helpful. It contains a lot of specific examples of behaviours and quotes from the men involved with the experiment, giving a rounded, detailed sense of their experience.\n\nHowever it does contain some racist and sexist language common during the 1940s when it was written.\n\nUN Human Rights report on Rohingya refugees from Myanmar\n\nThis is the UN report on the on-going genocide/ethnic cleansing taking place in Myanmar.\n\nThe report contains accounts of murder, rape, gang-rape, torture and the murder of children. It also contains brief statistical analysis of the crimes survivors reported witnessing or experiencing (over half of Rohingya women reported being raped or sexually assaulted, over half of the survivors interviewed reported that a family member had been murdered).\n\nThis could be useful to people writing about ethnic cleansing and genocide. I think it gives an overview of the situation within countries where these crimes occur, giving a sense of what they’re like before, during and after these atrocities.\n\nWar Child: Reclaiming Dreams\n\nThis is a quick summary of the effects war has on children by the charity War Child. It focuses on the work they do in various countries; it aims to raise money for the charity and awareness of the causes they’re involved in.\n\nIt provides a decent, quick overview of the many factors that affect children in war; both as civilians and as combatants. It talks about how children are used by armies (pointing out that the idea of they are always forced to fight is false) and how families and children caught in the cross fire are affected.\n\nA useful source for authors writing about children in combat zones and a good starting point for anyone planning on writing child soldiers.\n\nThe UN Standard Minimum Rules for the treatment of Prisoners, aka the Nelson Mandela Rules\n\nThis is a pretty dense legal document outlining how prisoners should be treated and the conditions that are a minimum acceptable standard for keeping them.\n\nIt’s tough reading but it could be useful for anyone planning to write about prisons and prisoners in a modern setting.\n\nThe collected works of S Kara\n\nKara’s research on slavery today is based on almost twenty years experience and thousands of interviews with enslaved people across continents.\n\nHe covers both individual experiences and the larger global picture of modern slavery. He covers multiple countries and slavery in different kinds of industries.\n\nHe also provides a thorough and convincing breakdown of the numbers; how many slaves there are today and where. This is accompanied by a clear analysis of how slavery has been allowed to continue and what needs to be done to stop it.\n\nBrilliant, harrowing, necessary books that are a must for anyone writing about slavery."
