        "text": "I suggest not using the term â€˜psychological tortureâ€™ because it uhâ€¦ itâ€™s got some baggage. Itâ€™s a term thatâ€™s usually used by torture apologists to dismiss and belittle the harm caused by certain torture techniques. Usually clean torture techniques, which are those that donâ€™t leave lasting obvious scars. These are the majority of tortures today.\n\nI understand what youâ€™re saying, and I understand most people donâ€™t know this stuff. But uhâ€¦ most of the time when someone says â€˜psychological tortureâ€™ what they mean is â€˜I donâ€™t believe this is physically harmful.â€™ And most of the time it really is.\n\nThere is not really such thing as â€˜psychological tortureâ€™ as a separate category. Thereâ€™s a whole host of ways people can be manipulated, coerced or abused without inflicting physical injury. These are wrong. But they do not necessarily fall under the legal definition of torture.\n\nIâ€™ll talk about the legal definition first but I think that what youâ€™re interested in isnâ€™t exactly the question youâ€™re asking. Because whether something meets the strict, legal definition of torture or not does not necessarily tell you whether it is harmful, wrong or illegal but covered under other laws.\n\nYou can find the legal definition of torture here.\n\nBriefly: the UN Declaration against Torture defines it as: â€˜any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes a obtaining from him or a third person information or confession, punishing him for an act he has committed, or intimidating him or other persons.â€™\n\nI know this is a little dense but what it basically means is that for an act to be torture it must:\n\nBe done by a government official, group that controls territory or someone that represents them.\n\nPainful\n\nDone knowing it would inflict pain\n\nDone for one of the four defined motivations\n\nAttempting to force a confession is one of the defined motivations. However for the kind of act you describe to meet the definition a prosecutor would need to prove that it causes pain and that the person doing it knew that in advance.\n\nTriggering someoneâ€™s paranoia is not necessarily torture because it can be done without knowing the person is paranoid or knowing the pain triggering paranoia causes. This does not make triggering someoneâ€™s paranoia OK. It does not reduce the pain it causes. But it can be done without understanding it will cause pain.\n\nSo, no. I do not think that this would be defined as torture.\n\nHowever I think it could be entrapment. Pressuring someone into incriminating themselves is a crime in a lot of places.\n\nItâ€™s also notâ€¦ a very accurate way of trying to figure out whether someone actually committed a crime. As you point out, mental illness can effect things making people act in ways that are read as â€˜guiltyâ€™, which is part of what leads to higher rates of charges.\n\nThereâ€™s also a pretty high rate of false confessions in scenarios like this, regardless of the mental health of the suspects. Coercion of this kind leads to an awful lot of false confessions. Which means that itâ€™s both immoral and bad practice.\n\nThereâ€™s an awful lot of fictional tropes in crime fiction that donâ€™t just depict bad practice but things that are straight up immoral. I watched some Columbo for the first time during the pandemic and while I enjoyed it, I agree that thisâ€¦ isnâ€™t the way real law enforcement should behave. At least not if the aim is genuinely finding people responsible for crimes and holding them accountable.\n\nI donâ€™t think the use of these tropes and conventions in fiction is always a problem. But people not understanding or recognising the reality, believing the fiction is reality, I think that can be a problem.\n\nNow obviously my focus is torture. The fictional tropes about torture specifically are often taken to be â€˜realâ€™ by readers/viewers because accurate information on torture is hard to find. And that has an effect on everything from reporting to policy.\n\nMy impression is that the situation surrounding tropes in crime fiction more broadly isnâ€™t quite as dire. There seems to be increasing understanding of how investigations are conducted both in fiction and in general public awareness.\n\nThere is still a big stress on interrogation and dramatic confrontation in fiction. I think thatâ€™s because itâ€™s easier to write in a way thatâ€™s tense and compelling.\n\nDonâ€™t get me wrong, this sort of stuff does still happen in real life and it leads to a lot of false confessions and wrongful imprisonment.\n\nAs for any stories you want to write- I think that if you want to show a detective as competent and good at their jobs, itâ€™s probably better to show them actually investigating rather then browbeating or coercing people.\n\nIn the scale of things I think Columbo handles this stuff better then a lot of other crime shows made at the same time. That doesnâ€™t necessarily mean itâ€™s always comfortable viewing, depending on your own limits and comfort zones. And it doesnâ€™t mean that the show is perfect.\n\nI hope that helps ðŸ™‚\n\nDisclaimer\n\nUnless it was a very light chain it would probably cause lethal damage in a few strikes/seconds.\n\nA chain can be made of different materials to different weights and thicknesses. So for the sake of clarity I am picturing a metal chain of width wider then two fingers, with a weight thatâ€™s at least several kilos. These are not common torture implements, which means Iâ€™m extrapolating based on what I know, rather then consulting a statistically sound modern data set.\n\nLethal whips, which are predominantly leather but studded with metal, strip skin and fracture bones.\n\nA chain would break bones, split skin and probably cause damage to internal organs. I think that in order to survive a character would have to be hit very few times, have immediate access to modern medicine and be very lucky.\n\nA single blow to the head would be enough to break the skull and cause significant brain damage. If struck in the front of the face it would likely break the nose and jaw, possibly causing enough damage that the victim would suffocate. It could also blind the character.\n\nThis is assuming it didnâ€™t kill them outright. A single punch to the skull can kill someone if theyâ€™re unlucky. A blow with a chain could definitely kill.\n\nBlows to the body would break the ribs and possibly the spine as well (depending on the weight of the chain and amount of blows.) Broken ribs could be forced into the lungs with further blows. A broken spine often leads to paralysis.\n\nBlows across the belly or lower back would probably damage the internal organs and I suspect that they would be lethal. However I am not a doctor and I am not confident enough in my knowledge to say exactly what would be damaged and how.\n\nA blow to the hips could potentially fracture the hip bone. Which is incredibly serious.\n\nI think a blow to the neck would straight up kill someone.\n\nDefensive injuries to the arms and legs would probably break the arms and legs. They could lead to complex breaks, a very long recovery time and possibly permanent reduction in fine motor control and strength. But thatâ€™s actually the most survivable scenario: one or two blows that only hit the arms or legs.\n\nDeath would probably be down to a combination of blood loss and multiple organ failure or uh whatever the correct medical term is for â€˜too much widespread damage to everything for the body to fix it.â€™\n\nSo there are a lot of different potential injuries depending on how the attack plays out.\n\nAs a general rule Iâ€™d say if you want the character to live without disability then uhâ€¦ may be pick something else for the other character to hit them with? A belt would be dangerous but would have a much better survival/physical recovery chance.\n\nIf on the other hand you want to write a disturbing attack with awful long term consequences or a murder scene, this is a really good choice.\n\nWith a surviving character you might want to take a look at the masterpost on common symptoms over here.\n\nI hope that helps. ðŸ™‚\n\nDisclaimer\n\nNot off topic at all though the answers can be hard to find sometimes.\n\nBefore I go into Australian torture, this is your regularly scheduled reminder that torture does not work as an interrogation technique. Iâ€™ve got a Masterpost here on writing torture in an interrogation context (and how to show it failing.) It has links to more posts on why torture doesnâ€™t work for those wanting more information. ðŸ™‚\n\nRejali, who is a pretty good source for National Styles during the 80s globally, does not mention Australia at all. The references I have to Australia in most sources are in the context of colonial torture and other abusive practices by the British. Going through my usual textbook sources I canâ€™t find a single reference to Australia after independence.\n\nMost of the online sources I go to talk about modern torture in Australia in one of four contexts:\n\nChinese-Australians speaking about their experiences in China\n\nAboriginal Australians describing modern torture and abuse in the context of racism in Australia\n\nCover ups by religious groups in Australia for historic and more recent crimes\n\nThe Australian immigration system (off shore detention)\n\nThe latest references to Australian torture after independence that Iâ€™ve found were from 1994. The majority are from the early 2000s or the 2010-2020 period. Everything I found referred to police officers not the army or special forces.\n\nUnsurprisingly the most common torture method I found was beating. I also found references to temperature tortures, solitary confinement and Taser use. However the older references donâ€™t mention Tasers and I could not find a clear date for when Taser use in Australia started.\n\nBasically what Iâ€™ve found is a massive gap in global torture studies with Australia being consistently overlooked.\n\nWithout clear information I think the best course of action for your story is to make up a National Style that fits the general global pattern and seems consistent with the little bits of evidence we have. I think the most reasonable thing to do is to try and approach this logically. That way even if what we create doesnâ€™t line up to the reality of Australian military torture in the 80s, it will at least seem plausible.\n\nBy the 80s clean tortures were the most common global torture techniques. So weâ€™ll stick to clean tortures.\n\nSome clean torture techniques have remained fairly niche. There isnâ€™t any clear evidence for why some torture techniques spread and others donâ€™t. But we can probably rule out torture techniques particular to one countryâ€™s National Style.\n\nSome clean torture techniques are so common globally that itâ€™s fair to assume theyâ€™re used in every country. These are: beating, starvation and sleep deprivation.\n\nStress positions and electrical torture are both globally common in this period. Both were widespread in Western countries (though Britain has rarely used electrical torture it is an exception to the general pattern.) Iâ€™d suggest going with stress positions over electrical torture, on the basis that I have no idea whether Australian special forces at the time would have had Tasers, stun guns, magnetos etc as part of their general equipment. However if your own research suggests special forces would have had easy access to these devices, then electrical torture would be quite likely.\n\nAustralia does not have a history of using pepper, so far as I know and I wouldnâ€™t describe the mainstream cuisine as relying on mild irritants like chili peppers. So I think pepper can be ruled out.\n\nThe climate throughout most of Australia makes temperature torture relatively easy and that makes it more likely. You can read about heat exhaustion and heat stroke on ScriptMedicâ€™s blog over here. Some countries have paired temperature torture with dehydration by rationing water in hot climates.\n\nWithout clear evidence that they occurred I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a good idea to pick waterboarding or dry choking tortures. Their popularity has fluctuated a lot over the years, they tend to be either very common or non-existent in a country and they come with some pretty serious long term injuries for victims when they go wrong.\n\nForced exercise isnâ€™t as common as choking tortures generally. But itâ€™s incredibly simple and incredibly difficult to prove, which I think makes it a good fit for your story.\n\nSo that gives a you this as a general list to pick from:\n\nBeatings\n\nStarvation\n\nSleep deprivation\n\nStress positions\n\nTemperature torture\n\nDehydration\n\nForced exercise\n\nDepending on what you want from the story and how long these characters are held you might want to focus on some options and rule out others.\n\nStarvation and sleep deprivation typically take place over several days. Dehydration, stress positions and temperature tortures become painful over several hours. Beatings and forced exercise are more immediate. Stun guns and Tasers (if you want to include them) are also more immediate.\n\nNow that Iâ€™ve talked about whatâ€™s plausible Iâ€™d like to make one thing clear: your comfort while writing this story matters.\n\nNo matter how â€˜likelyâ€™ or â€˜realisticâ€™ an abuse if it makes you uncomfortable to the point you donâ€™t want to write about it that is a valid decision.\n\nI could justify that with the fact that these attacks are varied and not every victim suffers the same abuse but to be honest as writers there are times when we should break from reality. And preserving our own mental and emotional health is definitely one of those times.\n\nWe are not obligated to show or represent everything. You, as the writer, will always be with the story long then any reader. Be kind to yourself.\n\nWhich leaves the rather more nebulous question of â€˜how far do torturers go.â€™\n\nAnd there is no clear cut answer to that question. The evidence we have does not suggest a consistent pattern.\n\nHere are a couple of examples from real cases of when torturers stopped for a while:\n\nThe victim died\n\nThe victim passed out\n\nThe victim was so mutilated or injured they required emergency medical care to live\n\nA new victim was brought in\n\nThe torturer got tired\n\nThe torturer got hungry\n\nThe torturer got bored\n\nThe torturer needed to go to the bathroom\n\nThe torturer got called away by someone they couldnâ€™t ignore\n\nThe torturerâ€™s friends got bored\n\nThe torturerâ€™s friends got tired\n\nThe torturerâ€™s friends got hungry\n\nThatâ€™s a non-exhaustive list.\n\nTorturers have stopped in some cases because they believed something a victim said. But they have also kept going in exactly the same circumstances.\n\nThere are recorded cases of torturers continuing to torture victims who couldnâ€™t speak the same language, victims who couldnâ€™t speak, victims who were clearly unconscious and victims who were clearly dead.\n\nTorture is not a controlled process and torturers are not in control of the violent situations they create. They will often claim that they are. But the evidence suggests they behave in a random, inconsistent fashion with little insight or acknowledgement of the consequences of their actions.\n\nThis means that we can not predict how far torturers will go. The answer is too varied, even when concentrating on an individual torturer.\n\nSo approach it as a writing decision: how far do you want them to go?\n\nThese children are going to suffer some of the long term symptoms of torture regardless.\n\nDo you want any of the characters to die? Do you want any of them to have lasting physical injuries? What kind of physical injuries or disabilities fit with the story you want to tell? How long do you want the characters to be held? Why are they released? Do you want every character to be treated in the same way or do you want the torturers to focus more on one character?\n\nHow does this incident effect the relationships between the victim characters? How does that influence the rest of the plot? Do any of the characters feel guilty or somehow to blame for what they survived? Do they see any sort of justice? If so how long does it take?\n\nThink about the answers to those questions and think about what serves the story.\n\nA choice that furthers the plot, adds interesting challenges or conflict for the characters and/or furthers narrative themes is going to be a good choice.\n\nI hope that helps ðŸ™‚\n\nDisclaimer\n\nVery broad question without clear, satisfying answers Anon.\n\nBasically: there is no guaranteed way to change a personâ€™s mind. There are strategies we know canâ€™t work. But everything that has a chance of success also has a chance of failure. And it isnâ€™t a clear cut thing that I can give you a clean list of factors for.\n\nHumans are difficult creatures to study because they come with a lot of inbuilt confounding factors and individual variation. This makes it very difficult to identify clear reasons why something didnâ€™t work. Because we have to assume that multiple factors are at work and the interaction of those factors may be as important as each factor individually.\n\nEven if you write your villains performing ICURE â€˜perfectlyâ€™ there is still a chance of failure. And therefore it is realistic for you to decide it fails for this character.\n\nWe canâ€™t really study which â€˜bitsâ€™ of ICURE are most effective. Partly because of that little thing called ethics but partly because setting up a study would be incredibly difficult. Itâ€™s hard enough to measure belief. Finding a large enough sample size, controlling for every possible confounding factor or variable and studying people for the years it would take to get any answersâ€¦ Itâ€™s a big ask. Itâ€™s probably never going to happen.\n\nSo with the caveat that we canâ€™t tell if any of the parts of ICURE are more important letâ€™s talk about how they can break down.\n\nICURE, for everyone who hasnâ€™t heard me talk about it before, is a set of techniques which can (sometimes) be used to manipulate a person into changing their views. They take months or years to have any real effect and as mentioned theyâ€™re not always successful.\n\nThe acronym stands for Isolate, Control information, create Uncertainty, Repetition and Emotive responses. And if youâ€™re writing a story where villains are trying to apply this but not doing it well it can break down at literally any one of these points.\n\nI would say based on what Iâ€™ve read that different groups focus more heavily on different aspects depending on their setting and strategy. Groups that are straight up kidnapping or imprisoning people often seem to focus more heavily on isolation and controlling information but often fall down on the other three. Whereas the impression I get of cults and some extremist political groups is that they focus more on creating uncertainty and emotive responses, which they can then use to further isolate members from family and friends.\n\nControlling information is a common place for ICURE to break down nowadays. The rise of the internet and the decreasing size of devices has made it easier for victims to access unauthorised sources even when imprisoned.\n\nBut repetition is also a very common place for ICURE to break down because in large groups not every individual is going to follow the same script perfectly. Group members can also undermine ICURE by lashing out, physically or verbally, driving their target away.\n\nCreating uncertainty doesnâ€™t always work. Sometimes victims straight up do not believe what theyâ€™re told. Some attempts to create uncertainty around core beliefs lead to a knee-jerk rejection of whatâ€™s being said. Sometimes targets know more about a given subject then the person trying to create uncertainty and as a result the attempt is absurdly obvious.\n\nEmotive responses are similarlyâ€¦ charged. Attempting to instil a sense of disgust or rejection of something an individual supports wonâ€™t always work. Over a long period of time it can. But I can think of a lot of cases where it has instead taught individuals to lie to the group, hide their beliefs or activities and served to drive them away from the group.\n\nIsolation is either difficult or easy depending on the context of the story. A character who is in a literal prison can easily be isolated from anyone but vetted individuals. A character who has been targetted by a cult, but is still going about normal day to day business, is a lot harder to isolate completely.\n\nCults and extremist groups tend to rely on uncertainty, repetition and emotive responses because they know that if they can shift a targetâ€™s beliefs the target will isolate themselves.\n\nLet me give you an example to illustrate this. Imagine a country where thereâ€™s a big, culturally important celebration that involves eating candied orange peel and wearing red. Now imagine a cult within the country that rejects candy as sinful and wearing red as a sign of bad character.\n\nA character targetted by this cult might feel increasingly uncomfortable with this festival. May be at first they go with their friends and family, wear red but donâ€™t eat the candied orange peel. May be the year after they decide not to go, missing a chance to spend time with their friends and family. May be a few years later their rejection of the festival is so deep they try to persuade their friends and family not to go.\n\nThis leads to a big argument. They and their friends/family say things in the heat of the moment. Now all sides are upset and communication becomes harder.\n\nThese kinds of patterns of behaviour lead to the target isolating themselves from friends and family, as their views become more extreme and drive away people who arenâ€™t members of the cult.\n\nBut crucially they can still choose to socialise with people outside of the cult. This will probably be met with social censure from the cult, making it difficult and painful. It is still possible. And outside friendships or activities can help a person to break free or resist ICURE techniques.\n\nAll of this basically means you have a lot of options for your story because there are plenty of things you can weave in that would undermine ICURE.\n\nYour character is in prison, so breaking isolation is more difficult. But if the prison is overcrowded or thereâ€™s a sudden influx of people being transferred between facilities the character might end up with aâ€¦ poor choice of cell mate from the guardâ€™s perspective. Some one with beliefs radically opposed to the guards or someone who could support and shore up the characterâ€™s old beliefs.\n\nThere may also be opportunities for covert communication and bonding within the prison. Perhaps prisoners can gather during breaks and have worked out a cant or code to talk about beliefs the guards are trying to stamp out.\n\nControl of information can break down because isolation has broken down, with prisoners trading information. It can also happen through the prisoner trading for a phone or a similar item allowing them to access forbidden information. Or it can happen through things like guards inadvertently giving out information.\n\nUncertainty is difficult to create around core beliefs. The impression I get from anecdotal accounts is that pushing too hard at core beliefs too early often causes targets to withdraw from the people attempting ICURE. It can also lead to targets doubling down on their beliefs.\n\nPeople attempting ICURE can also mess up on creating uncertainty, as described above.\n\nRepetition can break down because guards donâ€™t all do or say the same things consistently. They could contradict each other. Or they might just not repeat the same thing very often.\n\nEmotive responses can break down in much the same way creating uncertainty does. Not everyone responds emotionally to the same things or in the same way. Once again different guards can undermine the desired response. The character might dig in to their original position, they might withdraw from the people attempting ICURE. They might just learn to lie to them.\n\nI think as a writer the best approach to this is to use a mix of internal and external factors effecting multiple parts of ICURE. Just because I think that would create a better story.\n\nThe readers can see the internal struggle and resistance in the character. They can also see the guards messing up and how that impacts the character. May be the importance of support from other people, fellow prisoners or cleaning staff or doctors or anyone else that fits with the setting.\n\nBasically including multiple elements will give you a more fleshed out story with more emotional depth and impact. Thatâ€™s a good narrative reason to include it.\n\nI hope that helps. ðŸ™‚\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAnon I donâ€™t think this is a good idea. Thereâ€™s an awful lot to unpack here about why that is so Iâ€™m going to start off with a simple question that effects how you move forward: whatâ€™s most important for you about this character?\n\nIs it that sheâ€™s sympathetic? That sheâ€™s effective at her job? That sheâ€™s highly skilled and trained? That sheâ€™s part of a productive organisation that can actually do the tasks it sets out to?\n\nBecause if sheâ€™s a torturer then realistically she would be none of those things. And making her any of them is (in my opinion) torture apologia: because it is portraying a torturer in an extremely unrealistic way that favours the torturer and excuses the abuse they carry out.\n\nYou would, literally, be repeating lies popularised by real life torturers.\n\nTorture does not work. It is impossible to get accurate, timely information by using torture. Hereâ€™s an introduction to why. Hereâ€™s a post on what torture does to investigations. Hereâ€™s a guide to writing what torture does to interrogations. Hereâ€™s a list of investigative strategies that actually work. Hereâ€™s a post on the damage torture does to human memory. Please read these masterposts and take a look at my sources as well.\n\nTorturers are not indoctrinated radicals. The organisations that torturers are part of actively try to screen out anything they see as radical, deviant or a product of illness. There arenâ€™t enough studies on torturers for me to give you a break down of their politics but my impression from the anecdotes and interviews Iâ€™ve read? Their politics is â€˜normalâ€™ and mainstream for the organisation they are part of. Whatever that organisation is.\n\nTorturers are not taught from a young age because torture is not complex. It does not take months to learn how to hit someone. Torturers learn on the job by assisting other torturers.\n\nTorture is simple. It is functionally easy. I really canâ€™t stress that enough. The most common tortures globally right now are: hitting people, depriving them of food and depriving them of sleep. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s an exaggeration to say that six year olds could come up with that list.\n\nHurting people is not complicated. It requires no skill and no training.\n\nThe evidence we have suggests torturers lose skills as they turn to torture, a process Rejali calls â€˜de-skillingâ€™. The basic idea is pretty simple: if you spend all day hitting people instead of practicing what you were trained for (gathering evidence for example) you get so out of practice that you start to forget how to do those things.\n\nAnd then thereâ€™s the effect that torture has on torturers. They get symptoms. They develop lasting, serious, mental health problems which directly effect their ability to do their jobs.\n\nI have a list of the common symptoms here as well as a rough guide for how many symptoms you should be considering for torturers and torture survivors.\n\nSeparate to the symptoms is the general pattern of behaviour torturers exhibit. We donâ€™t have a lot of high quality studies on torturers and there are a lot of questions we do not have clear answers to. However the studies and the anecdotal evidence of survivors, witnesses and torturers themselves points to some consistent behaviours.\n\nTorturers donâ€™t work alone. They form little sub-cultures within larger organisations. These groups are incredibly aggressive, competitive, self-important, hyper-masculine and violent. Torturers look down on everybody else. They are convinced that they are the most important people in their organisation, the only oneâ€™s doing â€˜real workâ€™. They have an arrogant, puffed up pride that combines with mental illness and seeing their colleagues as competition to create the worst asshole youâ€™ve ever had the misfortune of working with.\n\nThey do not cooperate with other people. They use abuse as a pissing contest, competing to see who can be the most brutal in order to try and â€˜impressâ€™ fellow torturers.\n\nThey define strength and group loyalty by hurting other people.\n\nThey have a fracturing effect on organisations, because they donâ€™t obey orders and see their colleagues as competition or useless. At the low end of the scale this means cliques, secrets from the larger organisation and a terrible working environment as they bully and belittle their colleagues. At the high end of the scale there are cases where torturers have attacked and murdered people within the same organisation.\n\nDoes any of that sound sympathetic?\n\nI like a challenge when I write. Iâ€™ve described my writing style as â€˜hold my beerâ€™ because I tend to take ideas other people dismiss as impossible to pull off and try my best to make them work. I do this because I love exploring human complexity through fiction.\n\nA torturer who is currently torturing is not a sympathetic person. They are a bullying, violent, arrogant brute who contributes nothing useful to the organisation they latch on to, sucking up time and resources like a tick. They see other people as garbage. And they lack insight into their own crimes. Which means they do not appreciate or acknowledge the pain and damage they cause.\n\nNow I have written a character who is an ex-torturer who I think is sympathetic in some ways. But getting to the point where they could be sympathetic meant them having to leave the organisation they were part of on a stretcher.\n\nTheir fellow torturers turned on them. They lost a leg. They changed sides and in the middle of a messy civil war they dedicated themselves to keeping their friendâ€™s children safe.\n\nAnd I had to set the story twenty years after these events to get that character out of their own ass enough for them to be sympathetic.\n\nEven then, Iâ€™d say theyâ€™re sympathetic in spite of having been a torturer. Because theyâ€™re still clinging to that insistence that they did something meaningful. They still canâ€™t accept the extent of their own crimes or the effects those crimes had.\n\nBut their pride broke. And they did keep those children alive. They helped raise them. And the tie to those children is what makes them sympathetic by the time of the story.\n\nTorturers are not sympathetic people. They are self absorbed abusers who bend over backwards to downplay the harm they did to their victims and to justify their crimes.\n\nIs that really what you want to write?\n\nI say that, not to be harsh, but because it sounds to me as though what you actually want to write is a genuine investigator with psychic powers.\n\nIt sounds as though you want to write a character who is good at her job. Who is skilled and dedicated and a great person to work with.\n\nIf thatâ€™s the case my advice is to ditch the torture entirely. Look at the masterpost on genuine investigation instead and write a character who is good at interviewing people.\n\nHave her use her psychic powers to present herself as sympathetic to the criminals sheâ€™s interviewing. Because she can walk into a room and know their politics, their religious beliefs, their internal justifications for what theyâ€™ve done. And she can use that, may be even manipulatively, to seem like someone the prisoner would like, someone theyâ€™d agree with.\n\nThat gets people talking.\n\nAnd if you want to show her as ruthless, as having an edge to her, that can still work.\n\nImagine someone sitting down across from a suspect, holding their hands, smiling, talking to them gently. Imagine them gradually, kindly, getting this suspectâ€™s life story. Imagine them being sympathetic about the reason the suspect murdered someone, validating the murderâ€™s feelings and may be even actionsâ€¦ Right up until they have the information they need.\n\nThen they turn on a dime. The persona drops, the false-sympathy drains away. They stand up with a sneer and say they hope the murderer never sees the light of day again. And walk out.\n\nThink about what you want from the story Anon. A character who tortures, or a character who is competent, smart and sympathetic.\n\nBecause it really is one or the other.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPersonally I would treat this as if you were writing an adult survivor of war and genocide. Thatâ€™s a writing decision and itâ€™s partly rooted in me not knowing much about childhood development or the particular ways age effects trauma.\n\nI think you could choose to write this character as a child if you wished. However I think youâ€™d find more sources and more interviews if you focused on them as an adult.\n\nWhichever way you decide to approach it youâ€™re talking about a character who has been through multiple traumatic events and would be traumatised. Youâ€™re talking about multiple, complex mental health problems and symptoms. Iâ€™d say PTSD in particular was pretty likely but all the common symptoms of trauma are possible.\n\nI think the best thing to take from the sources on child solders is information on how adults respond to them. Because even if the character is functionally adult other people will see him as a child.\n\nIâ€™ve got a couple of books on child soldiers recently and Iâ€™ve been working through them slowly. Mostly because I find dealing with sources on child victims/survivors very difficult.\n\nSo with the caveat that I may change my mind on some of this or add things to later asks as I read more from these sources, here are some of the things that seem to come up a lot with the adult perception of child soldiers.\n\nA false dichotomy where child soldiers are either seen as passive victims or as monsters\n\nDismissing the idea of children acting with agency\n\nCommanders using their size, power or experience to further exploit children (ie withholding wages, sending them on particularly dangerous missions adults with experience might refuse, physical or sexual abuse etc.)\n\nEspecial fear of child soldiers by civilians, linking them to horrendous abuse of civilians (this is sometimes justified in the sense that armies often use child soldiers to sow terror.)\n\nNarrow view of the roles child soldiers perform in armies (ie focus on children fighting and ignoring child messengers, spies, couriers, cleaners, cooks etc.)\n\nDismissing the childâ€™s experience and politics and how that plays into recruitment\n\nI think this could create a really interesting story. Because on the one hand you have a character with enough experience and emotional maturity to have insight into his own trauma. This is a character who probably has a clear idea of why heâ€™s experiencing symptoms, coping strategies he could use and his own motivations for being part of an armed group.\n\nAt the same time heâ€™s probably going to be approached in a pretty patronising way by the people around him. Because theyâ€™ll see him as a child and assume that he does not have that experience, emotional maturity or insight. Theyâ€™re likely to dismiss his own assessment of his motives, feelings, etc.\n\nWhich makes for a very interesting conflict in the narrative, especially if youâ€™ve got a â€˜masqueradeâ€™ type of setting where fantasy creatures hide themselves from normal humans.\n\nBeyond that Iâ€™m not sure what to suggest. It sounds as though youâ€™re doing a lot of your own research and reading. So repeating what Iâ€™ve already said in other posts probably isnâ€™t helpful.\n\nObviously this is a fantasy ask with no clear answers or parallels in the real world. Which makes it a bit more difficult for me to suggest things.\n\nI think that my only other suggestion is to try and read some things by genocide survivors. I get the impression youâ€™re probably already reading interviews and so forth focused on genocide itself. While we should not treat fiction as sources, it might be helpful to read some fiction or see some art by genocide survivors.\n\nIâ€™ve found that looking at the art survivors create can sometimes be a really good source of inspiration when Iâ€™m struggling with a character. In a fantasy story particularly, it can help ground the fantastical character in humanity.\n\nI hope that helps. ðŸ™‚\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIâ€™m gonna be honest Anon Iâ€™m probably not the best person to ask for fiction recs. Since starting the blog Iâ€¦ donâ€™t have a lot of time to read fiction any more. Iâ€™ve got a full time job. I write fiction, I play D&D and I make my own clothes. Also I have a garden. And friends.\n\nItâ€™s also really common for books to be really good on some aspects of torture and really bad about others. So Iâ€™d advise reading about the common misconceptions and tropes over here first. I also think reading about real life torture survivors is a brilliant source of inspiration.\n\nYou might also want to take a look through the Torture in Fiction tag.\n\nMy favourite fictional book that tackles torture is probably Pratchettâ€™s Small Gods. Itâ€™s not perfect, running through the book is an assumption that torture can be effective. But it explores the way torture effects society in a way I really liked. To the extent that Iâ€™d say itâ€™s the best attempt Iâ€™ve seen by a Western author.\n\nHonestly Iâ€™ve been meaning to do a proper review of it for years, but finding the time to re-read it and take detailed notes has been impossible.\n\nThe other Western author Iâ€™d recommend is Diana Wynne Jones, who actually didnâ€™t write about torture that often.\n\nWhat she wrote was child abuse, based on her own experience. And her work contains a lot of nuanced, deep looks at manipulation, emotional abuse and recovery. At the more overt, gut-punch end of the scale Iâ€™d suggest The Lives of Christopher Chant and Charmed Life. At the more subtle end Howlâ€™s Moving Castle and Eight Days of Luke. The Merlin Conspiracy is the one that comes to mind as containing legally defined torture.\n\nBut I think her work is important for the way it subverts and explores narratives of victimhood, recovery and the idea of what makes a happy ending. I learnt a lot about how to write from her work.\n\nTo be honest now I mostly try to avoid torture in fiction. Iâ€™m soaked in this stuff all the time and itâ€™s nice to have some time away from it when Iâ€™m trying to relax. That means if a book is telegraphing that it could contain torture I probably wonâ€™t pick it up.\n\nEspecially if it thinks itâ€™s a â€˜darkâ€™, â€˜adultâ€™ story. Mostly because Iâ€™ve seen far too many stories which throw in abuse, torture and the like to try and get a cheap emotional response without actually creating an enjoyable story. And usually while repeating a whole load of apologia.\n\nSo I think Iâ€™m going to leave it there.\n\nDiana Wynne Jones is my main recommendation here. She was a truly unique and creative author. Not without flaws, no one is. But she did character driven stories with unusual endings. That makes her a good place to look if youâ€™re trying to find ideas.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nWell Anon Iâ€™m not the best place for question two; Iâ€™m a synthetic organic chemist by training, not a biologist, and my work focuses on human pharmaceutical products. Itâ€™s also pretty far outside the scope of the blog.\n\nAs for question one, the short answer is pressure sores.\n\nIâ€™m not a medic, so I got this from a quick internet search and glance at the NHS website. The recommendation is that paralysed people be moved at least every two hours to prevent pressure sores. Before these kinds of regimes were implemented the life expectancy for someone in hospital paralysed from the neck down, was about two years. Because of pressure sores and infections in them.\n\nI donâ€™t know how bad pressure sores would likely become in a month. I think your best bet for that information is to look up paralysis and medical care for people with paralysis.\n\nI think that even with relatively minor pressure sores this could be a lethal scenario for a pretty simple reason: how often is this character being cleaned?\n\nMoisture generally, and sitting in urine in particular, would increase the rate of skin injuries. Sitting in urine can actually cause minor chemical burns. And that means plenty of small, open wounds coming into contact with their bodily waste. Which means repeated infections. Which means a much higher chance of death.\n\nNow this kind of scenario, people being kept for very long periods lying down and unable to move, has happened relatively recently. Mostly in abusive hospitals and care homes. The time frames Iâ€™ve found in modern cases are shorter then a month. Iâ€™ve more commonly found time frames of a few days or a week.\n\nIn some cases adult diapers were used. This does not necessarily get around the problem of infection though. Because youâ€™re still talking about pressure sores (which commonly form on the buttocks if someone is left lying on their back) coming into contact with waste.\n\nThere have also been cases of people dying after being restrained, lying down, for much shorter periods of time.\n\nI think youâ€™re still in the realm where survival would be possible if the character was kept clean. But be aware that uhâ€¦ spontaneous heart attacks have happened in relatively young, healthy people who were restrained in this manner for a week. This is part of why the medical profession doesnâ€™t tend to use restraints like this often any more: it causes a lot more deaths.\n\nKeeping the character clean could either help prevent, or encourage bed sores depending on how it was done. Because moisture seems to encourage the formation of pressure sores. So unless they were thoroughly dried, washing could result in more sores and more serious sores.\n\nBut regular cleaning, say every few hours, might be enough movement to discourage the formation of sores. To be clear, I genuinely do not know if it would be enough. I am not a medic remember.\n\nA month of no activity is enough time for muscle wastage. It would be normal for someone in this situation to feel physically weak afterwards. It would take time for them to get back to their normal strength level and they might struggle to perform ordinary tasks.\n\nI donâ€™t know whether physiotherapy would be necessary or helpful in this situation. As in I do not know enough to say for sure.\n\nOverall, think carefully about the details in this story Anon. Because itâ€™s the details that determine whether survival is likely or not.\n\nIâ€™ve talked about the infection risk because thatâ€™s the part that stands out most. But consider whether the character is getting enough food and water. Consider whether theyâ€™re getting enough sleep. Because starvation and sleep deprivation increase the risk of infection and all three factors increase the risk of death from infection.\n\nBasically think through whether there are any more, hidden, abuses in this scenario. And consider editing the scenario if thereâ€™s more going on, either by reducing the risk factors (infection, starvation etc) or by reducing the time frame.\n\nI hope that helps ðŸ™‚\n\nDisclaimer"
