        "text": "The long and rich tradition in endocrine-metabolic research at Washington University School of Medicine can be traced to the Nobel Prize-winning work of the late Drs. Carl and Gerty Cori.\n\nAmong their many trainees who rose to leadership positions in endocrine-metabolic research were Drs. William H. Daughaday and David M. Kipnis, who molded and led the Metabolism Division, now known as the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Lipid Research to prominence in the 1950s-1970s. That tradition continues. The current endocrine-metabolic faculty is large (numbering about 50 in the departments of Medicine and Pediatrics alone). Their research and clinical interests are diverse, providing opportunities for broadly based training."
