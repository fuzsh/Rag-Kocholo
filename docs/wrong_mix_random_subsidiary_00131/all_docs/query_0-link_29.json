        "text": "Reports from 2023 Projects\n\nJeonghun Choi, Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, Harvard University.\n\n‘Globalizing Historical Knowledge in the Netherlands and Japan’\n\nIn the research statement I submitted to the Willison Foundation Charitable Trust, I planned to visit Tokyo and Tsuyama in Japan. I stayed in Japan from July 4 to August 25, and made additional visits to the archives in the Fukuoka and Sage Prefectures, which also house some significant but understudied materials concerning Dutch Learning and localization of historical knowledge in the nineteenth century. Overall, I was able to examine more primary sources (as well as some secondary sources) that were relevant to my research on the processes of production, circulation and consumption of historical knowledge in Japan than originally planned.\n\nAs was planned, during my trip I visited the Library of the University of Tokyo, Library of Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, National Diet Library, and Tsuyama Archive of Western Studies. In Tokyo, I examined the titles that are usually labeled as the ‘Foreign Books Collected under the Shogunate Regime’ and some of the Japanese-language texts either written or translated by the scholars of Dutch Learning (rangakusha). While many of the Dutch publications imported during the nineteenth century are already digitized, my study of the physical copies of them resulted in an intriguing discovery that any scholar who relies only on the digital editions would never expect. Even though it is challenging to determine how exactly the Dutch texts were read by the Japanese consumers, I was able to identify some copies whose pages are left uncut – such as Leesboek voor meisjes (2. druk) by P. D. Anslijn (Ran3238)– which is more suggestive of the possibility that those copies were either unread or not actively perused. And the existing catalogues of the Dutch texts have yet to single out such features as significant bibliographic dimensions.\n\nIn a few cases, I also found some traces of the readers’ use such as marginalia and bookmarks, as in a copy of Rekenboek voor meisjes, ter dienste der scholen (2. stukje 12. druk) by Nicolaas Anslijn (Ran3239), attributes to which existing scholarship has failed to pay sufficient attention. The only major challenge I had to face in Tokyo was that some libraries, especially the National Diet Library, prohibit scholars from scanning or photographing the materials. (Presumably this is one reason only a few scholars have discussed the Dutch publications in this collection.) It took more time to take notes on the titles that are most relevant to my research than expected. Also, the National Diet Library limited the number of books one can examine in a single day to about ten. My examination of the collection was far from comprehensive, even limited to the genre of history and pedagogy. Thus, I believe I will need to visit the collection again in the near future.\n\nAt the Tsuyama Archive of Western Studies, I was also able to get photocopied texts by Mitsukuri Genpo 箕作阮甫, the prominent scholar of Dutch Learning. One thing of which I was not aware until I arrived in Tsuyama was that the staff members of the archive were less willing to assist visitors, because they believed the main function of the archive is to exhibit materials in the museum within the archive for the public, rather than offering the copies for the scholars who visit the site. After all, many materials related to Dutch Learning were also accessible at the National Diet Library in Tokyo, a fact of which I was not fully aware. While I ended up getting many manuscripts by Mitsukuri that would be more closely examined for my dissertation, I will need to visit the National Diet Library again.\n\nAdditionally I visited the collections of the Library of Kyushu University (Fukuoka), the Sage Prefectural Library (Saga), and the Takeo City Library (Saga), which also hold printed books and manuscripts that reflect the trend of Dutch Learning and its intersection with other intellectual genealogies such as Neo-Confucianism, National Learning (kokugaku), and Military Learning (heigaku). I was able to examine almost all the texts I intended to at the Library of Kyushu University and Takeo City Library, such as Karaktermastige Beschrijving van het Bijzonder Leven en Gedrag van Napoleon Buonaparte by Lewis Goldsmith.\n\nI realized that many titles relevant to my research project were housed at the collections of the Saga Prefectural Library. A key challenge was that one can read or photograph the Dutch Learning-related texts such as the ones in the Nabeshima Family Archive only after one gets permission for access to each text from the descendants of the family. Thus, it was challenging to examine the titles comprehensively within the limited amount of time available. Nevertheless, I was able to undertake preliminary research on the collection. The Sage Prefectural Library is another site I plan to visit again for a deeper study the materials from the Nabeshima Family Archive. Eventually, though my exploration of the texts in this archive was far from comprehensive, I began viewing Sage as another central site of knowledge production and consumption that I need to emphasise in my project, especially in the dissertation chapter where I plan to discuss both the continuing and waning influence of Dutch Learning from the mid-nineteenth to the late nineteenth century.\n\nI would like to single out two significant points that became clearer during my research trip. First, in my project that examines globalization of European knowledge with an emphasis on Japan in the nineteenth century, both the contexts – of the Western publications, and the East Asian literary sphere – should be taken seriously, as suggested in my research proposal. Tokyo, Tsuyama, Fukuoka, and Sage are all famous for the rich intellectual ecologies, where the orders of knowledge such as Chinese classics and Dutch Learning intersected. The catalogues of the collections such as the Nabeshima Family Archive suggest that indeed it is highly likely that Western knowledge on some major themes such as the Napoleonic Wars was reframed by the conventional fields such as classical studies.\n\nSecond, the attributes in the physical copies housed in the archives can offer more clues through which to understand the process of circulation and consumption of the texts, such as marginalia, bookmarks, and uncut pages. In the chapter I aim to write, I will discuss both the textual and non-textual information as significant evidence that gives useful testimony to the modern Japanese book history.\n\nAs was stated in the synopsis in the Project Proposal, this research trip will result in a chapter in my doctoral dissertation that I plan to write. An e-copy of the dissertation, or the link to its web page will be provided to the Trust when it is completed. My trip to Japan was significantly funded by the Willison Foundation Charitable Trust, and I would like to express my deep gratitude for the Trust’s support.\n\nTim Fulford, Professor of English, De Montfort University.\n\n‘The Collected Poems of Henry Kirke White’.\n\nI am happy to say that the grant generously made has enabled me to undertake the research I proposed, and a little more. My research has resulted/is resulting in the following publications:\n\nThe Collected Poems of Henry Kirke White, ed. Tim Fulford. Liverpool University Press. April 2024. This now contains a hundred-page introduction assessing Kirke White’s poetry, explaining the preparation of his work for the press after his death, and surveying the production and circulation of editions of his work, including pirate editions, on both sides of the Atlantic, and also the circulation of poems in British and US magazines and journals. It also contains extensive editorial notes detailing the first publication of poems in magazines and editions, documenting the gradual establishment of Kirke White’s oeuvre and reputation by the nineteenth-century press. The grant enabled me to prepare the introduction and notes because the archival visits which it funded exposed me to the many US editions of his work, to the presentation of the poet made in the editorial apparatus of these editions, and to the magazine publication of certain poems.\n\nAn invited essay by me on the production and reception of editions and biographies of Kirke White in the UK and US, entitled ‘The rise, fall and revival of labouring-class poetry in the commercial market, 1800-1821’ in the book collection British Working-Class and Radical Writing Since 1700, ed. John Goodridge (London: University of London Press, 2024). This article makes use of MS correspondence and early editions of the poetry that I read on the New York and Philadelphia visits financed by the grant.\n\nAn invited article by me in the journal European Romantic Review (forthcoming 2024): ‘Farmers’ Boys and Doomed Youths: Producing the Poet in the Print Culture of the Romantic Era’. This article makes use of MS correspondence and early editions of the poetry that I read on the New York, Harvard and Philadelphia visits financed by the grant.\n\nAn extensive website, edited and part-written by me, containing essays on Kirke White’s poetry and biography, and the impact made by the circulation of specific US editions of his work on later writers’ publications. https://kirkewhitecom.wordpress.com/ Articles on this website that are especially indebted to the Willison grant include:\n\nChristopher Catanese, ‘Patronage and Poetic Form: Henry Kirke White, Capel Lofft, and the Monthly Mirror’. I published this piece after my work on magazine publication of Kirke White brought me into contact with the author.\n\nR. J. Ellis, ‘Harriet Wilson, Our Nig and Henry Kirke White’s Poetry’. Ellis’s article discusses the use of Kirke White made by the first black American novelist. It identifies the specific edition of the poet that Wilson likely used. My work in US libraries on editions of Kirke White, funded by the grant, allowed me to assist Ellis’s argument by inspecting editions.\n\nMy article ‘Kirke White in America: Transcendentalism — Bryant and Whitman’ assesses the impact on the poetry of William Cullen Bryant and Walt Whitman of reading specific US editions of Kirke White. I inspected these editions in the New York Public Library.\n\nMy article ‘Visionary Boys and Spots of Time: Kirke White, Wordsworth – the Romantic Child and the Memorialising Poet’ depends upon evidence as to the popularity of the biographical portrait of the Romantic boy genius that was created by the widespread editions of Kirke White’s work. I documented this popularity, in part, by inspecting editions and reprints in the New York Public Library and the Houghton Library, as stipulated in my bid to the Willison Trust.\n\nIn addition to these print and digital publications, I delivered a conference paper on the poet at the 2023 meeting of the North American Society for the Study of Romanticism in Huntsville Texas. This was given on a Book History panel and used my findings from the Willison-funded archival visits to demonstrate Kirke White’s popularity in the nineteenth-century book market. I also delivered an online talk on Kirke White’s reputation for the British Association of Romantic Studies. This benefitted from the discovery, on my visit to the New York Public Library, of a Paris pirate edition that grouped Kirke White’s poetry with that of Samuel Rogers and James Montgomery.\n\nOverall, the Willison Trust’s funding has enabled me to acquire the expertise and information about Kirke White’s publication history and presentation in print that is necessary to generate significant scholarly interest in his poetry and his reputation, and in his role in influencing readers and poets in the nineteenth century. The success of this research is evidenced in the invitations I have received to publish articles in books and journals and in the willingness of literary historians to contribute articles on Kirke White to my website. These continue: I shall later in 2024 publish online an article by the renowned Shelley scholar Greg Kucich—Kucich was brought to Kirke White’s work by hearing my conference paper on his reception. I shall myself discuss cheap print pirate editions of Kirke White at the 2024 meeting of the North American Association for the Study of Romanticism in Washington DC (August). I will also publish further commentaries on his writing on the website.\n\nAbhijit Gupta, Professor of English, Jadavpur University.\n\n‘Indologists among the Epics: H.H. Wilson and Charles Wilkins’.\n\nThe research on this project was carried out for a period of five weeks, from early June to mid-July 2023, chiefly at the British Library, London, and the Bodleian Library, Oxford. The core of the project was to examine the many rough and fair copies of the manuscripts of an English translation of the great Sanskrit epic, the Mahabharata, generated by a team lead by the Orientalist Horace Hayman Wilson in Calcutta in the late 1820s. The significance of the translation lay in the fact that though approximately two-thirds of the epic was translated—over half a century before the first published translation of the entire epic in English between 1883 and 1896—there was no attempt by Wilson to publish the work. Consequently, this led to a near-total ignorance about the existence of the translation, even among Mahabharata scholars. No less significant was the presence of a number of Indian translators and scribes—all happily named—who worked according to Wilson’s direction. In most textual projects of a collaborative nature from this period, the names of the ‘native’ assistants are missing. In this instance, the following names emerged: the lexicographer Ramkamal Sen, his son Harimohan Sen, Tarachand Chakrabarti, Sivakrishna Tagore, and Gobindaram Upadhyay. The names of some lesser-known scribes could also be gleaned from the MSS, as well as the occasional European hand.\n\nThere was a single research question with which I began this project: why did Wilson carry out this massive undertaking without once moving towards publication? What was it intended for? I am happy to report that I was able to answer this question, though it was not what I had expected. Very briefly, the translations were intended as rough notes or background research for other, more esoteric, Sanskrit texts Wilson was engaged in translating, such as the entire canon of the Hindu philosophical texts known as the Puranas. In fact, Wilson’s marginal notes and instructions indicate that he was assembling a digest of the epics for his own research needs, first starting with an index of the Ramayana in 1821-23 (MSS Eur D379). In the case of the Ramayana, only the index is compiled before a terse marginal note ‘Go on with the Mahabharata’ (MS Eur D415) signalled the shift to the Mahabharata for the next few years. What emerged from the study of the MSS was a fascinating narrative of reception, choice, and interpretation, carried out in a collaborative environment, and for a specific purpose. It also revealed a protocol of workshopped translation not wholly dissimilar to that employed by early Christian missionaries, but with additional features of its own such as access to a trained cadre of Western-educated Indian translators.\n\nIn addition to the MSS of the epic, a considerable volume of private papers, letters etc were also studied. But as I examined the textual production of Wilson and his team, I was able to realise that this was not in fact an isolated attempt, but rather, part of a longer history of orientalist engagement with the South Asian world of letters dating back to nearly half a century, from the time of William Jones and Charles Wilkins, Of course, Wilkins’s famed English translation of the Bhagavad Gita—a metaphysical text and the centrepiece of the Mahabharata—had been carried out under the direct patronage of the East India Company in 1785. But his manuscript output—much of it unpublished—is significant, such as his glossary of Hindi and Bengali words (Eur.MSS D130), or his own attempts at translating the first canto or Adiparva of the Mahabhrarata. In this case too, we have both the fair and rough copies, in Wilkins’s hand, as we as that of scribes. Other MSS also emerged, some unattributed, all comprising early attempts at chipping away at the textual mountain that was the Mahabharata. The choices of the passages taken up for translation are revealing, and seem to signal towards a process of miniature canon-formation. What is also interesting are the transliteration strategies employed by Wilkins in his 1780s translations, where Sanskrit names are Bengali-ised, a tendency which is reversed by the Wilson team. Though the project did not closely study questions of linguistic register and style, one could not help but take note of the comparative merits or demerits of the translations–Wilkins’s translation, for example, is rendered in a surprisingly modern idiom, and does not suffer in comparison to the authoritative translation carried out a century later by Kisori Mohan Ganguly.\n\nA third, wholly unexpected figure stepped up in course of the research—none other than the Governor-General-in-Council Warren Hastings himself. Hastings was an enthusiastic champion of Wilkins and his role in the securing funding for the latter’s Gita is well documented, but his own attempt to translate the Mahabharata—as part of a love-letter to his future wife Marian Imhoff—came as a revelation, and adds a further strand to the already complex tapestry of the early Orientalist engagement with the epic.\n\nSome questions remained unanswered, owing to lack of sources and/ or time. I was unable to find evidence of payments made to the translators by the East India Company for their work on the Mahabharata. More sifting of the Company papers may throw up more information on this. As I had indicated in my original proposal, the historical diaspora of material—especially from MSS—from India to depositories in the West is in itself worthy of study. Thus the history of acquisition, cataloguing, and preservation of material is also a part of the life of a textual object; in the case of the BL, particularly, the trail of acquisition would often grow cold after a point, or provide only partial information. Part of the story may also be located in Calcutta, especially in the holdings of the Asiatic Society.\n\nIn 2024, I expect the following publications to result from the research:\n\n-a scholarly article on the Wilson project (work ongoing)\n\n-a slim volume, provisionally titled ‘The Love-Song of Warren Hastings, Esq.’, featuring his translation from the Mahabharata with annotations, written for a more general readership (work ongoing)\n\nI also hope to explore funding opportunities to digitize the Wilson MSS, particularly of the Mahabharata.\n\nThanks to the generosity of the grant made by the Willison Foundation Charitable Trust, I was able to spend over five weeks in London and Oxford consulting the sources. Owing to the voluminous archives (over a hundred volumes of Wilson papers alone), it was necessary to devote a considerable length of time to the MSS. Without the support of the Trust, this project would have been impossible to carry out, even in a shortened form, and I am grateful to the Trustees for their support and encouragement for the project.\n\nRenske Hoff, Lecturer in Middle Dutch Literature, Utrecht University.\n\n‘Souters and Psalteriums: Paratext and Readership in Middle Dutch and Latin psalters in the Low Countries, c. 1480-1510’\n\nIn the project ‘Souters and Psalteriums’, undertaken with financial help of the Willison Foundation Charitable Trust, I have studied the use and (intended) readership of Latin and Dutch psalters printed in the Low Countries (current Netherlands and Belgium) between 1480 and 1510. In this period, nine Middle Dutch editions and twenty-five Latin editions of the book of Psalms were published in this area. I worked on this project between May and November 2023. With the received grant, I have been able to study books from libraries in England, Germany, and Belgium in July and November. In England, I have visited the British Library in London. In Germany, I have visited the Bayerische Statsbibliothek in Munich and the Württembergische Landesbibliothek in Stuttgart. In Antwerp, I have visited the Erfgoedbibliotheek Hendrik Conscience and the library of Museum Plantin Moretus. In this report, I will indicate how I spend the money, reflect on the results of my research, and look towards the future.\n\nAs stated above, I have been able to visit five libraries in three countries. Contrary to what I expected and indicated in my application, I was not able to visit the Bodleian Library and Cambridge University Library during my stay in England; I hope to visit both libraries at my own expense sometime next year. Furthermore, rather than travelling to Berlin, I realised that a visit to Antwerp would benefit my research more. I decided to visit the Erfgoedbibliotheek Hendrik Conscience and the library of Museum Plantin Moretus.\n\nThe study of the various copies has allowed me to formulate some preliminary conclusions about the paratext, layout, and intended readership of the Latin and Middle Dutch psalters.\n\nMiddle Dutch printed psalters sometimes contain Latin incipits that help users connect the Middle Dutch translation to the Latin text. This will have played a role in navigation, as other religious textual devices – such as liturgical overviews – would often provide the incipit of a psalm rather than its number. Latin psalters do not contain Middle Dutch incipits.\n\nAll Middle Dutch printed psalters studied in this project were in sextodecimo. With regard to Latin psalters, there is more variety. These psalters were published both in sextodecimo and octavo size.\n\nThe Middle Dutch editions often contain paratextual material alongside the psalms, including a preface, short introductions to each psalm, and several supplementary hymns and prayers. In general, the Latin psalters contain less paratext. Prefaces and introductions are absent.\n\nThe Middle Dutch nor the Latin psalters contain musical notation.\n\nAll Middle Dutch editions were printed on paper. The majority of the Latin psalters were as well, but a few were printed on parchment.\n\nRegarding layout, the Latin psalters show more variety than the Middle Dutch psalters. Some Latin editions have their lines further apart to allow for extensive annotations (as have indeed been added to the 1496 copy in Munich) or provide space for hand-added musical notation, as is the case in a copy of a 1502 psalter by Hugo Janszoon van Woerden in Amsterdam (University Library, Inc. 407), studied not as part of but still in relation to this project. However, most editions – both Latin and Middle Dutch – have a similar, simple layout. They are all printed in a Gothic type, single column, with simple devices, such as pilcrows and printed initials, to indicate the beginning of each new psalm.\n\nA number of Middle Dutch psalters are decorated with extensive penwork, done professionally or by a user him- or herself. This is generally absent in the Latin psalters.\n\nIn general, these results appear to indicate that some Middle Dutch and Latin psalter editions share a certain reading public, but that the Latin psalm books were produced in more variety, addressing a wider public and more diverse contexts of use. However, I have realised that I need more material to confirm this preliminary conclusion. At the moment, I am extending my research corpus by studying copies of Latin and Middle Dutch psalters located in various libraries in the Netherlands. I aim to present these results in an article, which I will hopefully be able to write in Spring 2024.\n\nAs explained in my application, this study was part of a larger research project dedicated to Psalm culture in the Low Countries around 1500. I am currently working on an application to the Dutch Research Council (NWO) for a large postdoc fellowship. The project ‘Souters and Psalteriums’ has been significant for this larger project in the following main ways:\n\nIt has enhanced my understanding of the differences and similarities between Latin and Middle Dutch psalters, confirming the relevance of approaching psalm culture as a multilingual affair.\n\nIt has strengthened my conviction that paratext and layout can provide valuable insights into intended readerships, both within religious and lay contexts.\n\nIt has emphasised the multidimensionality of the use of psalters: as textual containers, as material object, as visual things, and as enablers of song, performance, and prayer.\n\nI will continue working on the topic of psalm culture in the Low Countries. The project undertaken with the financial support of the Willison Foundation Charitable Trust has been fruitful both for my research and for my personal development as a researcher.\n\nPriti Joshi, Professor of English, University of Puget Sound.\n\n‘For Illustrative Purposes Only: From Wood to Litho to Photo in 19th Century Indian Newspapers.’\n\nThanks to the generosity of the Willison Foundation, I was able to travel to the UK in June/July 2023 for almost four weeks. During this time, I conducted research on images in the 19th century Indian press, as well as studied the technologies used for mass-producing images, primarily woodcut/engraving and lithography, in the 19th century.\n\nIn London, my archival research was centered on the British Library, with forays to the Wellcome Centre, the Victoria & Albert Museum, and the National Archives. (The British Museum, where I was hoping to access materials was unable to accommodate me.) At the BL I was able to consult and study closely a broad range of illustrated periodicals between 1850 and 1890. With loupe and light in hand, I discovered, for instance, that images that I had taken to be wood-cuts were in fact lithographs (and in some cases vice versa).\n\nI had taken the Delhi Sketch Book’s images to be woodcuts, but the signature on an image from that publication – a salamander whose tail curls into the word “lithog” – clearly indicates that the journal was at least occasionally using lithography for its satiric images. Details from Mookerjee’s Magazine, one of India’s earliest review magazines, suggests that rather than following in footsteps of the satiric, Bengali-language Basantak that preceded it by about five years and that relied on woodcuts, Mookerjee’s used lithography instead. Time poring over images at the BL taught me that though in British periodicals ‘wood was king’ late into the 19th century (displaced only by two-tone photographic images), in India lithography dominated in periodical images.\n\nIn London I also had archival successes at the Wellcome Institute and the Victoria & Albert Museum. As I embarked on the project, I was looking to trace the representations of figures in the press to 18th century oil portraits; what I had not anticipated was turning my attention ‘downstream’, as it were, to inexpensive, street prints that proliferated in the bazaars of 19th-century India. Both the V&A and Wellcome Institute have collections of prints produced in the Batalla market of Calcutta and sold for a few annas (pence). My access to these prints was a break-through for my research and project. While I have yet fully to absorb and formulate the meaning of these findings, my preliminary assessment is that Batalla prints show a far greater syncretism and cosmopolitanism than the prints produced and consumed by a growing middle-class elite in newsprint.\n\nMy weeks at London libraries were punctuated by a two-day workshop on lithography at the Centre for Book Cultures and Publishing at the University of Reading. This fantastic event allowed me to converse with scholars such as Michael Twyman and Fiona Ross, as well as emerging scholars such as Vaibhav Singh (who works on Indian periodicals and type design) and Borna Izadpanah (who works on lithography in 19th and 20th century Iran). Along with the research findings I describe above, this workshop opened my eyes to the centrality of lithography in the 19th century print market.\n\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne, Thomas Bewick territory, was my next stop – and revelation. Though I had anticipated staying in Newcastle only a short time, I extended my trip to ten research days as the archive there felt like a cloud-burst opening up. When I headed to Newcastle, the questions I was seeking answers to appeared a long-shot (after all, Bewick and his workshop methods were distant – calendrically and geographically – from Indian periodicals). Notwithstanding the unclear relation between my research questions and Bewick’s wood engraving methods and workshop organization, Peter Quinn, the president of the Bewick Society, kindly gave me his time, expertise, and vast knowledge during my stay in Newcastle. I am especially grateful to him for introducing me to Chris Daunt, a master wood-engraver who allowed me to crash his day-long workshop on wood-engraving; while my engraving was decidedly below-par in terms of skill, what I learned in that workshop about Bewick and wood engraving methods were invaluable. The archival door that swung open into a veritable treasury was the Newcastle City Library whose archivists were enormously generous in bringing out a wide range of Bewick materials: carved woodblocks, proof books, and many editions of his books. The latter made clear that the levels of degradation even after frequent printings from the same block was minimal. Though I am not a Bewick specialist, I have already crafted a short newsletter-style piece on Bewick’s vignettes and Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre (that novel famously opens with the young Jane securing Bewick’s British Birds for company as she shuns and is shunned by her cruel aunt and cousins).\n\nThough I had intended to travel to Manchester, the archival finds in Newcastle were so rich and productive that I decided to forgo that trip. The weeks of research this past summer were stupendous: in just over three weeks, I returned home with some 1,200 image scans! I am deeply grateful to the Willison Foundation for making this research possible; I will be drawing on this archive for many years to come.\n\nIn July, I presented a paper at the Research Society for Victorian Periodicals in which I incorporated some of my findings of the Batalla woodcuts. I have incorporated materials from the Bewick archive in my teaching already (in a class I taught this past term on Jane Eyre) and am working on a short article on Bewick’s vignettes and the ways their meaning shifts as their location in his various volumes shifts. I have completed an article on the borrowings and exchanges between Indian and British illustrated periodicals (‘Periodical Transactions: The Indian Press Repurposes the British Press’) that is in final editing stages and slated to appear in the Routledge Companion to Global Victorian Literature and Culture, edited by Sukanya Banerjee and Fariha Shaikh. A paper on labour and labouring conditions in wood-cutting workshops is partially completed and is my next project to come out of these archival gatherings. I am still grappling with my research finding about the central role of lithography in Indian periodicals, but understand now that the interplay between wood and stone will be a central facet of my next publication/this project.\n\nNicholas Pickwoad, Professor Emeritus, University of the Arts London.\n\n‘Report on the examination of the 12 manuscript notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci in the library of the Institut de France in February, 2024.’\n\nI spent the three weeks from 4-26 February in Paris examining the 12 notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci in the company of the Leonardo scholar Carmen Bambach, Curator of Drawings and Prints at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. This allowed us three working weeks (Monday to Friday) of continuous study, from 12.00 noon, when library opened to readers, until 6.00 pm, when it closed. Because of these somewhat limited hours, we worked each day without a break, for the full 6 hours, sitting side by side in the reading room of the Institut, under the watchful supervision of different members of the library staff. We established a routine of work, initially each of us examining one notebook at a time, and then swapping them over, before calling for the next pair of manuscripts, but once the library staff had got used to us and what we were doing, we were given remarkably free access to the notebooks, and we were able to revisit ones already seen to check on details and to have more than the allotted number of two notebooks on the desk at the same time, to allow comparisons to be made. We brought with us a cold-light source with a fibre-optic swan-neck light guide, and we were able to borrow a second one from the conservator at the Fondation Custodia, which allowed each of us much greater access to controlled lighting, including transmitted light photography to try to record watermarks. We also made use of my Dinolyte Digital Microscope to record details at high magnification, and were allowed to take as many photographs of the mss as we needed.\n\nWe worked through the notebooks more or less in shelfmark order and were just able to examine all of them within the time available to us, though inevitably more time would have been useful. I took my photo-lights, tripod and camera in order to take high quality images, but it quickly became obvious that we did not have time for this level of photography, and made use instead of a small digital camera and an iPad as we examined the books. This meant that we were unable to take the transmitted-light photographs of the leaves that we had hoped to have, though we were able to photograph a large number of the watermarks. There is still work, however, to be done on the paper used in the notebooks.\n\nI was able to carry out a thorough analysis of all the bindings, and although it had hitherto been believed that only one of the notebooks, Paris M, was in the state in which Leonardo handled it, and therefore in its first and only professionally-made longstitch binding, I was able to establish that the four other longstitch bindings are also all in their first bindings and thus also survive as they were when acquired by Leonardo. Three of them, MSS Paris E, F, and G, clearly came from the same source, most probably a Milanese stationer, showing identical sewing patterns and the simplest possible covers of cartonnage. MS Paris L was a little more sophisticated, with a cover of blue cartonnage, which retains most of a secondary cover of white paper. Paris M has a stronger structure with secondary pierced supports of parchment on the spine. Such informal notebooks are the sort of bound books that seldom survive, and certainly not from this early date (ca 1500), and these survive because they were treated from the time of Leonardo’s death in 1519 with something of the reverence given to holy relics, and were left untouched. Had they belonged to someone less famous, they would probably not have been preserved intact. None of the notebooks in other collections have survived in these bindings, though it is clear that part of one of the Forster Codices in the V&A (Forster II) preserves the six gatherings from such a binding, probably in the same order in which they were acquired as a blank note book.\n\nFour of the books (Paris MSS A, B, H and I) are now in parchment-covered bindings of the same type as the three Forster Codices and the Codex Trivulzianus, which I examined in the Castello Sforzesco in Milan in 2019. With the exception of the six gatherings from a notebook mentioned above, all these books are made up from the separate, unbound, tacketed quires that were presumably made up in Leonardo’s workshop and used on a daily basis, and in which they appear to have survived until he died. His heir, Francesco Melzi, collected them together in different volumes and had them bound in new longstitch bindings sewn though thick cartonnage covers. The four Paris examples of this type all bear evidence of their earlier history as separately-sewn gatherings. The sides of these cartonnage covers were subsequently cut off, and new parchment covers were added, secured to the bookblocks with the slips of endbands, worked with a secondary sewing in coloured silk thread. All of the covers have fore-edge envelope flaps with loop and toggle fastenings. It has been suggested that these covers may have been added in Spain, though as one is to be found on the Codex Trivulzianus, this seems unlikely, as there is no evidence that this book has ever left Italy.\n\nThe leaves stolen from MSS A and B by Guglielmo Libri were returned to the library bought from the collection of Lord Ashburnham, and these too we examined. Their removal in fact opened up access to the structures of the notebooks from which they we taken which would not otherwise have been accessible. The leaves remain in the guard-book bindings made for them after their removal.\n\nWhile I was studying the bindings, Carmen Bambach was working on the composition of the contents, and throughout our work we were able to ask questions of each other, each proposing ideas that other would see as possible or impossible according to our own specialist knowledge. It was highly productive collaboration that exceeded my most optimistic expectations. A considerable amount of data was assembled, but we were handicapped by what the on-line photographs of the mss did not provide, and which we were not able to photograph within the scope of our visit. The notebooks were all photographed in such a way (with 360° lighting) as to eliminate shadows, thus hiding much of the information one would hope gain from the surface of the paper (such as evidence of the felt side of the paper, the texture of the laid moulds and watermarks, erasures, etc.). We were also unable to take transmitted-light photographs of more than small details (such as some of the watermarks).\n\nThe question of photography formed part of the discussion which took place in a meeting at the end of our visit with Yann Sordet, directeur des bibliothèques de l’Institut de France and Sabrina Castandet-le Bris, conservatrice en chef of the library. Our case for the need for further photography of the manuscripts was greatly assisted by the discovery by Carmen Bambach the previous day of a hitherto unrecorded drawing by Leonardo in one of the notebooks. This was finely executed with a metal point, as was his habit for the preparation of his more carefully executed drawings, but never completed in ink. It shows some complex groined vaulting, possibly intended for the cathedral in Milan, and is completely invisible unless viewed with raking light, and does not therefore show up in the on-line images.\n\nWe also asked about the possibility of photography of the whole collection using transmitted light. This would not only give an accurate record of all the watermarks, but would also allow the virtual reconstruction of the sheets from which the notebooks were made which would in turn allow missing leaves to be identified (and possibly found in other collections) and establish how the existing gatherings, many of which in MSS A, B, H and I are very irregular in their composition, were put together.\n\nYann Sordet undertook to explore the possibility of further photography by the Institut, as well as the possibility of the Institut publishing a book on the notebooks, to include the Forster Codices and the Codex Trivulzianus. He is to propose this work and the publication to the board of the Institut. He also invited us to return to the Institut for such further examination of the notebooks as might be necessary to complete our work. Carmen Bambach and I are in the meantime assessing and putting in order the data we recorded, but as she is currently heavily involved in the preparation for a major Raphael exhibition in the Metropolitan Museum in New York, this is inevitably slow work.\n\nAsha Rogers, Associate Professor in Contemporary Postcolonial Literature, University of Birmingham.\n\n‘A publishing history of the Igbo language novel Omenuko (1935), by Peter Nwana’.\n\nThe Trust funded a significant portion of research towards a publishing history of Peter Nwana’s novel Omenuko (1934), widely believed to be the first published novel in the Igbo language. That it did not appear in English translation until 2014, despite its considerable cultural status regionally in Nigeria including as an examination text, raises important questions about the non-circulation of literatures composed in African languages. The research contributes directly to work on twentieth-century African literature and its publishing conditions, including scholarly outputs.\n\nThe research was organised in the following way:\n\nProvenance and sponsorship (1928-1948): To illuminate how Omenuko emerged as a text in relation to religious, publishing, and other British-based agencies involved in its commissioning, publication and sale, thereby increasing our understanding their historical role in making African language publications available on certain terms.\n\nLanguage and materiality (1935-1963): To analyse the forms of linguistic difference rendered in four materially distinct editions in 1935, 1951, 1958, and 1963, studies in light the available archival information on commissioning, , and sales. To identify how material issues of language, including standardisation, institutionalisation, and translation, might bear upon the interpretation of the text.\n\nProvenance and sponsorship\n\nI was able to identify some aspects of the novel’s origins during research visits to the Methodist Missionary Society at SOAS and the archives of the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures at the LSE.\n\nThe International Institute’s Executive Council minutes between 1926-1939 showed the extent to which its assemblage of interests – religious, educational, anthropological and those relating to imperial governance – were mediated through the annual prize ‘for Vernacular Books Written by Natives’. It was under these conditions that Omenuko came into being initially as an entry that received a second place ‘consolation prize’. In this scenario, missionary anthropologists and others who perceived themselves as a progressive, culturalist influence on imperial policymaking took on the role of literary critic, committed to producing ‘authentic’ ‘African’ literature according to its pre-given judgments. The ample evidence of such thinking in the minutes speaks to a colonial politics of location where the spoken worlds of language, its newly alphabetised forms, and the ownership of writing through formal authorship was entangled with the relations between locals and outside agencies like the IIALC.\n\nUnfortunately, it was not possible to locate the relevant folders holding the reader reports delivered by African language specialists of a European background, nor evidence of Nwana’s initial entry. This demonstrates a potential limitation of the ‘organisational’ approach; granular material on Nwana’s life and writing conditions lay ‘on the ground’ in south-eastern Nigeria; and of the archival approach, in which documentary evidence may still prove unexpectedly ephemeral. The extent of the IIALC’s role in supporting original African-language writing and, of the potential changes Nwana wrought prior to publication following its feedback, thus remain an ongoing enquiry.\n\nThe stage was to consult the papers of the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society, principally the Methodist West African Literature Committee, set up in 1922 to supply English language materials to West African primary schools, and the main repository of information about the business dealings of the Atlantis Press, an imprint of the Methodist Missionary Society for overseas sales, which had published the first edition of the novel in 1935. The Minute Book not only documented annual the sales of the novel from 8 copies in 1936 to an impressive, if not massive, 5000 copies at its seventh impression in 1949, showing a steady drip effect of sales into the changing world of the forties.\n\nIt also clarified its position outside the main business of the Press (religious publications and school textbooks), which was buffeted by rivals such as Longman, and existed in wider colonial markets (non-saleable texts were potentially redirected to West Indian markets). Omenuko was dubbed ‘Ibo story book’ by the Press, including in a particularly striking discovery, a hand-inscribed internal copy of the first edition held by the Press. It was the only African-authored individual work that I could see signs of. It generated some profits as a side-enterprise and complemented the Press’s extant interests in developing a ‘vernacular literature’ evident elsewhere (e.g. the publication Parables in Ibo; the Methodist Synod’s interest in educating an African in English studies at Exeter University to take over the vernacular strand of the business).\n\nAlthough the Minute Book confirmed Omenuko was sold on to Longmans, it did not explain why. Outstanding questions include how and why this rival was able to extract the title, what attracted the press to Nwana’s book in the first place other than its novelty, and the sizeable issue of reception in the missionary school system. My research also benefitted from the SOAS Library’s collection of rare African studies and colonial titles.\n\nLanguage and materiality\n\nFor all its strengths in grappling with issues of materiality, the history of the book as a discipline has not always engaged questions of language and language diversity, nor the materiality of language (see McDonald 2016). Among the most exciting parts of this research, then, was to spend time identifying changes in the different versions of Igbo orthography in which Omenuko appeared in various editions. This involved close work with original books and printed orthographies at British Library and SOAS, sourcing the extant 1963 edition in consultation with librarians at the Library of Congress, and liaising with Igbo cultural consultant Yvonne Chioma Mbanefo, who confirmed the various orthographies had been correctly identified. Digital reproductions of the parts of the four editions helped me analyse publishing and copyright information, and document how the rival orthographic systems bearing on written Igbo in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, bore upon the material book. This suggested to me that Omenuko’s fate as a work of African-language writing was made provincial partly through larger disputes over language and writing systems.\n\nConclusions and outcomes\n\nI have presented work-in-progress to the ‘New Directions in Indigenous Book History’ on the historical and contemporary significance of the material book to Indigenous peoples. I have also written a 10,000-word research article, submitted Open Access to an international peer-reviewed journal, which documents the research described above on institutional provenance and patronage, and the intricate and decisive ways language and its materiality impacted Omenuko as a printed book and its circulation. The visual presentation and impact of this article will be greatly enhanced by the 4 high-resolution colour images of the various editions of the novel, the inclusion of which has been made possible by the Trust funding my acquisition of digital reproductions of sufficient quality.\n\nThe article marshals histories of publishing, translation and educational institutionalisation to intervene on debates on literary circulation and the geographical relation between the “local” and the “global” in world literary studies. It elaborates new insights into the novel’s reception based on my recuperation of a bootleg adaptation of Omenuko in the Nigerian newspaper the Daily Star in 1976 (unexpectedly made available to me locally on microfilm by the Library of Congress and University of Birmingham Library, which was not ultimately covered by the grant). It is this final example of the novel’s material life, I suggest, which promises to change how we read Omenuko from a text of putatively ‘local’ relevance to one with a much more expansive world, uses, and set of audiences, in view.\n\nSydney Shep, Reader in Book History, Victoria University of Wellington.\n\n‘Joyce in the Antipodes: the Chelsea Book Club connection’.\n\nThe aim of this research project was to reconstruct the history of the London-based Chelsea Book Club [CBC] and analyse its role in the antipodean distribution of the first edition of James Joyce’s Ulysses. The research was divided into two main segments: archival research at the National Library of Australia in Canberra which holds the personal papers of Arundel del Re [ADR], the founder of the CBC; and archival research in London at the British Library and the London Metropolitan Archives. While in Toronto I consulted the Virginia Woolf archive at Victoria College, my former alma mater, and met with Claire Battershill, one of the principal researchers on the Modernist Archive Publishing Project [MAPP]. As a result of a meeting with Nicola Wilson, MAPP’s project lead, in London in 2023, I will make a further research visit to Reading University’s Hogarth Press Archive in July 2024, in conjunction with the SHARP annual conference in Reading, where I am delivering a paper on the subject of my research. During this time I will also return to the British Library to continue my research, interrupted last year due to industrial action.\n\nArundel del Re’s personal papers deposited at the National Library of Australia (MS 1879) in Canberra proved to be an exceptionally rich source of information about this enigmatic figure who straddled many worlds and many places. Although posthumously purchased from the family, it was clearly a collection curated by ADR during his lifetime. Spartan early life history sources were fleshed out by many drafts of his many newspaper and magazine articles, public talks, lectures, and academic writings including transcript variants of his ‘Georgian Reminiscences’ the oral history recordings of which are housed at the JC Beaglehole Room at Victoria University of Wellington, NZ. Substantial correspondence with Japanese colleagues and friends provided evidence of his long-standing interest in Japanese culture and the impact he made on their professional and personal careers during his residency there and in Formosa (Taiwan) from 1927-1954. Notable lacunae were substantive references to his London period with Harold Munro, The Poetry Review, and the Poetry Bookshop as well as any mention of the Chelsea Book Club. As was discovered later, his personal effects including correspondence and books were confiscated when he was interned in Tokyo during WWII as a foreign national with sympathies to the Italian King rather than Communist Party and Mussolini. The idea that ADR brought his personal copy of Ulysses with him to New Zealand was, therefore, finally dispelled.\n\nThe British Library houses the extant UK-based correspondence, diaries, and manuscripts of Harold Monro (BL Monro papers, Add MSS 57734-68), the key literary figure with whom del Re was associated in Florence and London. In addition, the papers of the journalist Ruth Tomalin (BL Add MSS 89048) who embarked upon a biography of Monro’s wife, Alida Klemantaski, revealed an unexpected treasure trove of correspondence – mostly reminiscences – from ADR sent in the hope that she might write his biography. Unfortunately, due to ongoing industrial action, the Manuscript Reading Room was closed for the two weeks I was scheduled to be in London. Despite ordering up material from these collections and having an initial tantalising glimpse, I had to wait until the strike action was finished before I could access them again. With no time left for transcription and because personal photography or digital scans were not permitted, I had to order photographic reproductions which cost £1,068.\n\nIn the meantime, I had a very productive time tracking down ADR’s copious journalistic writings through the British Newspaper Archive and reconstructing his life in London (1911-1917) and Oxford (1921-1927) where, in addition to being the Taylorian Lecturer in Italian and the Italian Delegate for the League of Nations, he co-founded the Oxford Arts Club and Oxford University Operatic Society, and was involved with the Dramatic Society and various literary enterprises including those based at Basil Blackwood’s Broad Street bookshop.\n\nIn 1919, ADR established the Chelsea Book Club at 65 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. This was the same year that Sylvia Beach founded Shakespeare & Co., in Paris. The two booksellers, who had previously met in Paris while ADR ran intelligence for the Italian Military Consul during the war, had similar aspirations and operated across similar literary networks. As the publisher of Ulysses, Beach was a key node in the often clandestine distribution of this work, documented by Seymour Leslie in his 1964 memoirs. Although I have yet to find any extant business archives, advertisements for CBC are found sprinkled throughout the leading literary and art periodicals of the period and reviews in mainstream newspaper media. ADR makes a guest appearance in Virginia Woolf’s diaries, CBC bookseller’s tickets and invoices can be found in online antiquarian booksellers’ listings, and the London business directories of the time include CBC. Several photos of the Cheyne Walk location complete with signage, window displays and browsing patrons were discovered at the London Metropolitan Archives. Local business directories proved that the Club continued after ADR left for Japan in 1927. It moved to 326 Kings Road, Kensington in 1929 and was managed by a consortium of amateur booksellers: Hon Oliver Brett, O[live] Guthrie, Seymour Leslie, and Morton Sands. The Club disappears from the public record in 1931. Of note, the original Cheyne Walk location was taken over by the Johnson Head Bookshop run by A. and L. Whitehead from 1929-1931.\n\nADR’s bookselling enterprise stocked rarer English language titles and international authors, underpinned by a lifelong philosophy that international understanding was best achieved through the eye and the mind. He was also well connected with the local and international art scene. One of the unique features of the CBC was its exhibitions, ranging from drawings and prints by Cezanne and Renoir, paintings by Augustus Johns and Walter Sickert, and prints by Eric Gill to the first exhibition of African (Congolese) sculpture in the UK, famously reviewed by art critic Roger Fry. Advertisements reveal that the CBC stocked fine press books, including those from the Hogarth and Ovid presses, something in keeping with ADR’s own experiences of editing two Golden Cockerel Press titles: The History of Pompey the Little (1926) and Troilus & Criseyde (1927). However, when he published work under the CBC imprint, his output was far more limited than anticipated: two books and one broadsheet. Nine Songs from the Twelfth Century French (1920) translated by Claude Colleer Abbot featured five woodcuts by Claude Lovat Fraser (who had been affiliated with Monro’s Poetry Bookshop) and was produced in a limited edition of 50 copies. The bilingual New Keepsake for the Year 1921 was a far more ambitious project of 600 copies, 50 of which were on Japanese vellum, and featured poems, stories, essays, original woodcuts and etchings edited by X.M. Boulestin and J.E. Laboureur. Finally, the Chelsea Book Club Broadsheet No. 1 was an excerpt from Virginia Woolf’s short story, “The Mark on the Wall” with two woodcut images by her sister, Vanessa Bell.\n\nMy research to date has uncovered a complex, networked history of Arundel del Re. The bibliographic component of my application is ongoing, having morphed into a bibliography of ADR’s writings as well as a census of the known copies of Ulysses sold by the Chelsea Book Club. Once completed, these will be posted online. Archival absences have led me to re-engage with a career-long interest in auto/biography, resulting in some notable outputs and publications, listed below. I have also developed a new research platform that reframes the theory and method of auto/biography as it engages with ‘big biography’ and generative artificial intelligence. My BSANZ and SHARP conference papers introduce these concepts and a Marsden Fund application is in the review process.\n\nOutputs to date:\n\nPreliminary bibliography of the writings of Arundel del Re, including journalism, academIc writing and editing;\n\nPreliminary bibliography of the Chelsea Book Club’s publications;\n\nCensus of CBC copies of Ulysses, tracking current owners and provenance;\n\n“Ulysses Number 82: a bibliomystery,” public talk, Wellington Wayzgoose 2023, 25 November 2023;\n\n“Joyce in the Antipodes: the Chelsea Book Club connection,” conference presentation, Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand, 27 November 2023;\n\n“In pursuit of Arundel del Re: scholar, translator, bibliophile,” book chapter for New Zealand Encounters with Japan, ed.

The grant came at a fortuitous time as I finished my PhD and set out to write a monograph on the economics of the British book trade during the Industrial Revolution. Dickinson serves as a crucial case study for this topic. Besides being the inventor of the cylinder-mould papermaking machine, Dickinson had close ties with two of London’s leading book tradespeople, the printer Andrew Strahan and the publisher Thomas Norton Longman. The primary goal of my project was to elucidate the growth of Dickinson’s papermaking and stationary businesses and to trace his connections with Strahan, Longman, and the London book trade during the first phase of his career, during which he erected four machine-powered mills and a rag processing plant near Hemel Hempstead.\n\nThe Trust’s generous grant of £4,000 covered the expenses of a one-month trip to Hertford. In all, I consulted roughly 5,000 pages of archival material at HALS, including all of Dickinson’s surviving business records through to 1840. The grant afforded me the luxury of time to be thorough, to document my progress methodically in order to ensure accurate citations, and to take legible photographs for reference when I return to the US. These steps were crucial for Dickinson’s papers at HALS, as the only extensive study of the materials, Joan Evans’s The Endless Web (1955), predates Victoria Brunton’s systematic catalogue. Unlike the Longman Archives in Reading and the Strahan Papers at the British Library, the Records of John Dickinson and Company have not been reproduced in microfilm. As I plan out my monograph, the trip to Hertfordshire has made it possible for me to write a dynamic account of the interactions among all three firms.\n\nMy first priority was to study Dickinson’s financial accounts, which comprise 40 volumes across the period 1801–1840. Of these records, the most actionable—though unfortunately not always the most legible, owing to faint ink and occasional water damage—were Dickinson’s Company Accounts of 1821–1840 (HALS D/EDi/1/3/1/1–16), prepared during his successive partnerships with T.N. Longman’s brother George and son Charles. These accounts contain detailed inventories of the paper held at Longman & Dickinson’s stationary business at 65 Old Bailey, including the numbers of reams of various sizes and grades they had in stock and their valuation by cost. These records make it possible to trace the growth of Longman & Dickinson’s stationary business, which included the wholesale distribution of paper made at Dickinson’s mills alongside the output of other mills. The financial statements also include outstanding debts to Longman & Dickinson from their customers, the largest of whom were prominent London publishers and retail paper merchants.\n\nOther aspects of Dickinson’s accounts have proven more challenging to interpret. Although the Company Accounts include valuations of the operating capital at Dickinson’s mills, they do not seem to proffer a clear record of Dickinson’s papermaking machines and other equipment. Dickinson’s Cash Books (D/EDi/1/3/9/1–16) and Bank Pass Books (D/EDi/1/3/13/1–4) are similarly vexing: they contain day-by-day accounts of Dickinson’s transactions, but most of the records only give a name and a numerical sum without further clarification. To be sure, these records are instructive, especially in the case of Dickinson’s large interest payments to Strahan on his loans and the mortgages of two of his mills. Although I expect to find much useful information in these records, it will take some effort for me to make the most of them. Another area in which HALS’s coverage proved somewhat mixed was in the documentation of Dickinson’s inventions. For instance, I had been intrigued to see that the collection included an 1804 manuscript of Dickinson’s patent for the cylinder-mould papermaking machine (D/EDi/1/4/1), but this turned out to be a fair copy of the patent: it contains some interesting marginal notes and revisions, but no original diagrams or other materials absent from the patent filing itself.\n\nThese mild frustrations were offset by troves of information that I had not expected to find on Dickinson’s partnerships, mill properties, and dealings with book tradespeople. Of these records, the most arduous to read were the many parchments containing deeds, copyholds, and leases for the various properties on which Dickinson operated, some of which contain detailed colour maps of the properties and their outlying areas. Before visiting HALS, I had also failed to appreciate the quantity and depth of Dickinson’s surviving correspondence, especially with his later partner Charles Longman (D/EDi/1/10/35) and with various of his customers in the book trade. In one particularly instructive 1818 letter to Lepard & Smith apologizing for delays in the manufacture of post printing paper (sheet size c. 19 × 15 in), Dickinson gives one of the clearest statements of the productive capacity of one of his cylinder machines: “the machine . . . turns out full 300 reams per week.” (D/EDi/1/10/34).\n\nIn addition to Dickinson’s records, HALS also proved to hold other materials relevant to the history of early machine-made paper. The most important materials I found were a collection of business records from Henry Fourdrinier, whose entrepreneurship of the Fourdrinier papermaking machine helped to spur Dickinson’s invention of the cylinder-mould machine. Besides housing Fourdrinier’s letters to Christopher Thomas Tower, who leased him Frogmore Mill (80623–80690), HALS also holds a complete inventory of Frogmore’s machines and equipment prepared by the engineer Bryan Donkin in 1810 (80856). For the purposes of my monograph, this discovery was a welcome surprise. Besides clarifying the relationship of the Fourdrinier family’s manufacturing operations to their stationery and patent business, these records offer a rare glimpse of Henry Fourdrinier in his own words, outside of the ponderous legal proceedings that followed from his financial ruin in 1810.\n\nI would like to reiterate my thanks to the Willison Trust, whose generosity has helped me immensely during my transition from graduate school to professional scholarship. When the Trust accepted my application during the last weeks of my doctoral studies, I had not yet conducted any sustained archival research apart from consulting microfilm reproductions. Having completed my project, I feel far more confident in my ability to make independent use of primary sources. For the purposes of my monograph, the research I have conducted at HALS will furnish material for two chapters: one on the Longman-Strahan Dickinson triumvirate, and another discussing the entrepreneurial contexts of Dickinson’s and Fourdrinier’s inventions. My analysis of Dickinson’s mills has also provided crucial context for a separate project in analytical bibliography, for which I am measuring variations in the machine-web seam marks left on printing paper that Dickinson sold to Longman. I hope that the scholarship I am able to write thanks to the Trust’s grant will help to advance book historians’ understanding of the interactions between the book manufacture and publishing during a period of rapid change in the British public’s engagement with print.\n\nReports from 2020 Projects\n\nPlease note that, because of the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-21 and its aftermath, those holding grants for 2020 were faced with many and continuing problems. For this reason, some of the reports below are interim ones.\n\nHyei Jin Kim, St Hugh’s College, Oxford\n\n‘The World According to PEN and UNESCO: Literature as Patrimony and Property from 1920s to the Present’.\n\nIn January 2020, the Willison Foundation Trust generously provided me with a grant to visit the UNESCO Archives housed in its headquarters in Paris and I was able to conduct two weeks of research here in late February 2020. The main Archives hold documents produced before 1966, including those pertaining to the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC) in the 1920s and 1930s; Conference of Allied Ministers of Education (CAME), and UNESCO Preparatory Commissions in the 1940s. The Annex Archives, in contrast, hold documents between 1967 and the present. As the Annex Archives were open only in the mornings and by appointment, I spent the mornings in the Annex and afternoons in the main Archives. I examined mainly the correspondence files (divided into three series), publication files, and UNESCO’s own printed collections held in its Library. Except for the publications in the Library, the files were all individually labelled by their subject and for this reason I spent some time looking through the card catalogues and compiling a long list of relevant materials. I am grateful to the archivists, who kindly assisted me in searching the printed catalogues and online databases to locate the exact files I wished to consult. Overall, I did not have much difficulty accessing the material; however, there were a handful of files that were inexplicably missing or unfortunately destroyed by fire, while the documents dated after 1999 were still under embargo. I shall detail three select findings, namely on translation, literary publications, and PEN International.\n\nTranslations\n\nI initially indicated in my application that I wished to consult materials on UNESCO’s book and translation programmes throughout the 20th century, including its efforts to promote the Universal Copyright Convention. When I consulted the folders related to copyrights, it quickly became clear that these consisted mainly of administrative and/or technical documents that were largely irrelevant to my research. Instead, I was intrigued by the documents of the IIIC (those that have not been digitised on UNESCO Archive’s website), CAME, and Preparatory Commissions that recorded various projects promoting translated books between 1922 and 1946, the most notable of which were the IIIC’s Ibero-American and Japanese Collections published in the 1930s. The entire collections were available in the UNESCO Library and these books provided a useful comparison with UNESCO’s own Collection of Representative Works and insights into its early history. While many of the early ideas did not come to fruition, these were significant findings for my thesis as they illustrated the origins of UNESCO’s book programmes and, more broadly, the intricate connections between these entities and their successor, which are not widely explored in critical studies. Discovering this early history enabled me to trace the organisation’s own intellectual history and more fully to understand its central ideal that promoted translated books as a means of mutual understanding and world peace.\n\nThe Archives also held considerable materials on UNESCO translation programmes that were active from 1950s onwards. I was familiar with the early stages of the Collection of Representative Works, which translated literatures around the world mainly into English and French, but I could not find much information about the project in its later years and hoped to discover how it changed (or did not change). I was thus delighted to find many correspondence files and other documents in the Annex Archives that revealed the project’s increasingly complex inner workings. For instance, the project on the one hand endeavoured to expand its geographical reach in the 1970s and 1980s but on the other resisted modifying its original policy. This tension was soon increased by significant budget cuts. I was equally delighted to find many folders on the International Council for Philosophy and Human Sciences (ICPHS), one of UNESCO’s own NGOs, which provided valuable information not only on the role of ICPHS but also on the actual makings of the Collection in the later years. I unexpectedly came across some files on UNESCO’s literacy projects wherein the organisation produced reading materials, including the literary ones, for its member countries via translation. While these literacy projects were by no means specific to literature, I gained a better sense of UNESCO’s overall translation programmes that ranged from producing booklets for the ‘new literates’ to publishing books for more educated readers. Overall, these materials answered my numerous questions about the project and confirmed that the Collection indeed remained as the literary translation project throughout the 20th century, this despite the financial difficulties and the organisation’s increasing interest in literacy and cultural development.\n\nLiterary Publications\n\nThe UNESCO Library holds most of, if not all, the physical copies of the Collection and other literary publications, many of which are not easily available in other libraries. Using this vast resource, I was able to examine the paratexts, including the book covers, blurbs, prefaces, and/or forewords, of various books from the Asian and the European Series, and study how these books were circulated to English-speaking readers, mainly in Britain and the United States. While the designs were vastly different depending on the publisher, the paratexts generally did not mention the name ‘UNESCO’ in an explicit manner, indicating American and British commercial publishers’ cautious approach to presenting books sponsored by the (Western) multistate body.\n\nThe Archives’ publication files further complemented these investigations. The Archives kept a number of files on the books published by UNESCO or jointly with external publishers and, while a handful of files were missing or lost, I was delighted to find some publication data about the Collection as this information was not easily available, and could only be speculated on. The data I gathered included contracts, copyright arrangements, royalty payments and, on occasions, sales figures, which showed the actual outcomes and reception of these publications. Except for a few bestsellers, the books did not seem to be popular or as widely circulated as I had assumed, providing a new insight into the reality and afterlife of the Collection in the international book market.\n\nPEN International\n\nThe files on PEN International, the second organisation central to my overall thesis, were very illuminating. There were only a few relevant documents in the 1940s and 1950s, which were scattered across different folders and thus difficult to track down. Those from 1960s onwards, however, were substantial and organised by date. There was not as much information about PEN’s literary publications as I had hoped but the files instead illustrated a rich, entangled history of the two organisations, ranging from their numerous collaborations, failed projects, debates, and conflicts. While it is difficult to summarise the findings of this considerable and varied collection, it primarily showed how the differences between a non-governmental organisation and a multistate body greatly impacted their collaboration in promoting and publishing literary translations. UNESCO and PEN each had their own ideas of the nation, state, language, and literature, which at times came into conflict and (unexpectedly) shaped the final result of their cooperative programmes. The constant negotiations over the subventions for literary projects further showed how the two organisations influenced, or attempted to influence, each other in making their own versions of world literature. The files overall provided detailed insights into UNESCO’s relations with PEN, which gradually evolved from simple collaborations to a dynamic and at times (in)tense partnership, and various translation initiatives that reflected and addressed the broader debates on decolonisation, cultural developments in the so-called ‘Third World’, and even literacy.\n\nThis invaluable, in-depth research would not have been possible without the generous grant from the Willison Foundation Trust. The materials I gathered from this trip significantly improved and expanded my doctoral thesis; I wrote a new chapter that examined the heritage of UNESCO’s book and translation projects. I am currently working on another chapter about UNESCO’s complex relations with PEN. I have as well revised and updated the pre-existing chapters on the Collection based on this new research. I also relied on these new materials for my conference paper, which I presented at ‘Art and Action: Literary Authorship, Politics, and Celebrity Culture’, a conference that was unfortunately cancelled due to the pandemic but revived in a digital format in August 2020.\n\nProfessor Rachael King University of California, Santa Barbara\n\n‘Improving Literature: The Textual Forms of Eighteenth-Century Progressive Thought’.\n\nInterim report provided 10th November 2022.\n\nIn August 2022, I was able to complete the archival research that had been postponed since August 2020 due to the global Covid-19 pandemic. I travelled to Oxford and Cambridge to conduct research at the Bodleian Library and Cambridge University Library. During this trip, I undertook archival research for Chapter Four of my in-progress monograph, Improving Literature: Media, Environments, and the Eighteenth-Century Improvement Debate. This chapter, ‘Keeping an Account: Improving Women and the Spaces of Self-Improvement’, examines how the debate on what constituted ‘improving literature’ for women highlighted the material forms in which women wrote and read. The archival research for this chapter discusses pocket diaries, a hybrid manuscript-print genre that encouraged women to keep an account of their daily activities with blank spaces for entering expenses and memoranda. I argue that this form explicitly supported conservative emphasis on women’s ‘improvement’ while implicitly offering a space for subversion of those standards.\n\nBoth the Bodleian Library and Cambridge University Library hold examples of pocket diaries that provided valuable support for my argument. At the Bodleian, I viewed the more than two dozen pocket diaries of Julia and Anne Woodforde, which span the 1830s to 1870s. These diaries feature two sets of handwriting, one of which uses the diary for its usual purpose of recording social occasions and the other of which uses it to keep a gardening calendar. They also show how people would switch between different diary titles, as the sisters did not purchase a particular diary each year but alternated between Rees’ Improved Diary or Memorandum Book, Pennys’ Annual London Diary and Almanack, Poole’s Select Pocket Remembrancer, The Ladies’ Pocket Book, and other titles. Some of the diaries, such as Marshall’s Ladies Fashionable Repository, include fashion engravings. At the Bodleian, I also viewed a printed Almanach de Lausanne, which the owner had used to keep a diary of travels in Europe, and William Stukeley’s notebooks, which he also entered on blank pages of printed almanacs. These diaries help me show how users turned printed annual books to their own purposes.\n\nAt Cambridge University Library, I also viewed diaries and journals, including Quaker teenager Mary Howard’s copy of The Minor’s Pocket Book, for the Youth of Both Sexes from 1813, in which Howard created her own symbol system to track her progress in reading as well as her continuing inability to live up to her own standards. In addition, I examined a handwritten book titled Writing and Arithmetic with Merchants-Accompts, an elaborate workbook mimicking print for the study of handwriting and penmanship exercises. Although it is directed to merchants, the book is inscribed ‘Rachell Tapper Her Book’. These materials will be crucial in bringing actual women’s diaries into conversation with the advice of conduct literature as well as proto-feminist responses in the later eighteenth century. The Willison Trust Fellowship allowed me to fund travel to England to complete this research as well as to begin writing the chapter, which is now about 50 percent drafted.’\n\nSuzan Alteri, Baldwin Library of Historical Children’s Literature – Special and Area Studies Collections University of Florida .\n\n‘Guiding Science: Women-Authored Science Books for Children, 1790-1890’.\n\nInterim Report\n\nI was able to complete the first of my proposed research trips to the UK in late February 2020 just prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. During this trip, I was able to visit five different archives to collect and analyse documents relating to the following writers: Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Priscilla Wakefield, Sarah Scudgell Wilkinson, Mary Pilkington, Maria Edgeworth, Sarah Lee, Maria Hack, and Mary Somerville. From these initial sources, I have been able to ascertain two networks of women writers. Those connected to social circles of Maria Edgeworth, Mary Somerville, and John Herschel, and women writers linked through the Society of Friends active around the London area. This last network is of particular interest because it connects women who were aware of each other’s work though the Society rather than through personal friendships or correspondence. Barbauld connects through both networks, but it appears that she is the only link between the two. By studying the correspondence and notebooks of Mary Somerville, Maria Edgeworth, and Priscilla Wakefield, I was also able to identify the patterns of scientific research undertaken to write their books, as well as their reliance on connections to scientists to review manuscripts and offer scientific advice.\n\nIn addition to the research and writing networks above, I was also able to work in-depth with the Royal Literary Fund papers at the British Library. The case files of two writers – Mary Pilkington and Sarah Wilkinson – from the late eighteenth century reflect the perilous life of a female author who is unmarried and makes her primary income from writing. Both writers wrote many heartbreaking tales to the Royal Literary Fund for subsistence while trying to finish a number of manuscripts for publishers. The files of later nineteenth century writers, such as Agnes Giberne, illustrate progress made both by science and children’s writing through the intervention of Lord Balfour, then Lord of the Treasury.\n\nThe onset of the pandemic made further research trips impossible. Currently I am working on an article relating to my findings from the Royal Literary Fund papers. I have been able, from this early research, to update and significantly revise seven biographies of women writers who are part of the Guiding Science project. The chaotic academic environment in the US due to the pandemic meant that progress was slow.\n\nOnce international travel resumes, I hope to complete my research trips funded from this generous grant and submit a manuscript for publication to the Elements imprint at Cambridge University Press. I will be able to update the Trustees as to further progress made on the project and with dates for further research.\n\nProfessor Nicholas Mason, Brigham Young University\n\n‘The literary periodicals of Britain’s Romantic age’.\n\nIn late 2019 I was awarded a generous fellowship from the Willison Trust to conduct research for an ambitious new history I am writing on the literary periodicals of Britain’s Romantic age. As outlined in my fellowship application, my original plan was to use funding from this award to help pay for trips to the Newberry Library in Chicago and the National Library of Scotland during the summer of 2020. But as COVID lead to travel restrictions and the closure of most major archives through the latter part of 2021, I requested and received permission from the Willison Trust to extend my timeline for using this award through the end of 2022.\n\nIn the interim, I used a small portion of the fellowship to subscribe to the British Library’s British Newspaper Archive, a remarkable database that includes near-complete runs of all major newspapers from the period I am studying. While newspapers factor less centrally in the narrative I am telling than magazines, annuals, and quarterlies, this resource allowed me to develop a clearer timeline for when literary reviews, gossip, and news began appearing in both local and national newspapers.\n\nBy the time travel restrictions were lifted, I had found alternate ways to conduct much of the bibliographic research that I had intended to do at the Newberry. So, while on sabbatical at the start of this year, I instead made two separate trips to the UK, where I spent a total of three weeks at the Wordsworth Trust in Grasmere, the John Rylands Library in Manchester, and the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh. Here is a brief review of the research I conducted at each site:\n\nWordsworth Trust (late February 2022): While my visit to Grasmere was primarily connected to entirely different research project on Dorothy Wordsworth’s journals, I spent part of my time there studying manuscript letters in which members of the so-called ‘Wordsworth Circle’ comment on the reviewing practices of their age and register their opinions on Blackwood’s, the Edinburgh Review, the Quarterly Review, and various other leading periodicals of the 1810s and 1820s.\n\nNational Library of Scotland (late March/early April 2022): Most of my time in Edinburgh was spent browsing the NLS’s remarkable archives of such major Romantic-era publishers of both books and periodicals as John Murray, Archibald Constable, and William Blackwood. Specifically, I focused on their ledgers (which provide crucial information on the economics of launching and maintaining a literary periodical) and correspondence (which are indispensable for understanding everything from relationships with contributors to back-room deals to secure favourable reviews to the grind of producing high-quality issues every month or quarter).\n\nJohn Rylands Library (early April 2022): From Edinburgh I travelled to Manchester, where I spent two days at the Rylands studying the correspondence of Maria Jane Jewsbury, a young writer of the 1820s and 1830s who, before dying young, was considered one of Britain’s most promising ‘poetesses’ as a result of her prolific contributions to Manchester papers and literary annuals.\n\nNeither of these trips across the ocean would have been feasible without the Willison Trust’s generosity, and I am immensely grateful to both Ian Willison for funding this award and the Foundation’s trustees for administering the programme. Although the pandemic postponed my research and, by extension, the projected completion date for this book (which now likely won’t be ready for submission until 2024 or 2025), the final product will be significantly better thanks to this funding, and I fully intend publicly to thank the Willison Trust in the acknowledgments page.\n\nIan Stuart Morrison, Libraries Tasmania\n\n‘Completeness and Authenticity in Early Twentieth-Century Book Collecting’.\n\nThis project grew from my research into the Allport Library’s copy of The Description of a Voyage of Certaine Ships of Holland into the East Indies (1598). (‘A Description of a Voyage: The “Allport” Copy of STC 15193’, Script & Print 44.2 (2020): 69-89; and ‘An Addition to a Description: Further Notes on John Wolfe’s Houtman Narratives, STC 15193 and STC 11747’, Script & Print 45.2 (2021): 105-111.) That volume is ‘completed in facsimile’ and I became interested in larger questions: how were facsimiles made? How common was the practice? How long did it continue? What effect did it have on the desirability of the book so ‘completed’?\n\nTo clarify the boundaries: this project focusses on the practice of completing printed books in facsimile. It does not explore the practice of repairing manuscripts by inking in missing or damaged letters. Nor does it address commercial publication of facsimile reproductions of entire works. There are instances of facsimile publishing that shed light on the practice of completing in facsimile, but they are fundamentally different activities. A commercial reproduction involves making multiple copies, with all the attendant marketing and publicity. ‘Completing in facsimile’ is generally done to one particular faulty copy.\n\nThere are two main strands to my research: an examination of the records of the leading British bookseller Maggs Brothers, and an analysis of booksellers’ catalogues from the late nineteenth through to the mid-twentieth century. The analysis of booksellers’ catalogues is ongoing. Some suggestive patterns are emerging but it is too early to report in detail.\n\nMaggs records from 1914 through to 1978 are held in the British Library. Funding from the Willison Foundation Charitable Trust and Tasmania’s State Library and Archive Trust enabled me to spend a block of weeks working through them. I samplied files at intervals from 1914 through to 1950. This paper is my first attempt at digesting findings from that research.\n\n‘Everything that a flower should have’\n\nA little way into my time at the British Library, I opened a file that presented a startlingly apposite metaphor.\n\nOn 30 September 1926, Liverpool businessman Leslie Fairrie wrote to Maggs:\n\nI shall be greatly obliged if you can assist me in tracing an old story.\n\nAn Eastern potentate had among his subjects some wise men of exceptional wisdom, and some artificers of exceptional skill. Working together they produced a bouquet of artificial flowers so wonderful in texture, colour, perfume, and everything that a flower should have, that they regarded it as impossible to differentiate between them and the flowers they had imitated….\n\nThey took the real and the artificial bouquets to their king, told him what they had done, and asked him which was which.\n\nHe took a bouquet in each hand, and going to that corner of the palace gardens which was under the care of the chief Bee-Keeper, he planted them in one of the flower-beds …. Soon the bees came and hovered round them both, but only into the flowers of one bouquet did they creep in search of honey. ‘There,’ said the King, ‘is your answer’.\n\n(BL Add MS 89311/1/546)\n\n2. How and when were facsimiles made?\n\nIn the mid nineteenth century the finest facsimiles were made by hand, a process involving tracing another copy. Photography was used as early as the 1850s, and by the end of the century was capable of results equal or superior to all but the most accomplished hand facsimilist. (David McKitterick, Old Books and New Technologies, CUP, 2013; Nicolas Barker, Forgery of Printed Documents, Ancora, 2016; Sarah Werner, “Pen Facsimiles of Early Print” https://collation.folger.edu/2013/05/pen-facsimiles-of-early-print/.)\n\nFrom the mid-1920s to the early 1950s Maggs worked with Riviere and Son, bookbinders, and the Courier Press, Leamington Spa, printers and engravers. Other firms appeared occasionally, but Riviere and the Courier Press were regulars. No single document sets out the process in detail, but piecing together individual comments in various letters a fairly clear picture emerges.\n\nThe first step was to photograph an original, usually in the British Museum. From this, the printer made a block. Maggs supplied paper matching as closely as possible the original. The book to be completed was also delivered to the printer, enabling them to work to the exact page dimensions and ensure that the colour of the paper matched the original, dyeing it if necessary. The book with its new facsimile leaves would then go to the binder.\n\nRestoration or sophistication?\n\nFrom the mid-1920s through to the early 1950s, when Maggs were offered a book completed in facsimile they invariably rejected it. They had good reason. Even if a facsimile was of an insignificant element, the aggrieved buyer could and did return the book and expect a refund. The sums involved could be substantial, as when the Cambridge bookseller Heffer paid £86 for a first edition of Humphry Clinker, and within a fortnight sought to return it ‘on the grounds that the half-titles of two volumes are in facsimile and that the other appears to have been substituted from another edition’. Heffer had purchased the book, presumably for a client, at a Sotheby’s sale; Maggs were liable because they had catalogued the books. (Sotheby to Maggs 13 Nov 1928, Add MS 89311/1/639.)\n\nAnalysis of dealers’ catalogues is so far tending to support the hypothesis that books completed in facsimile were becoming less attractive to wealthy collectors by the late 1920s, and continued to decline in value over the following decades.\n\nThis eminent, long-established, widely respected bookseller actually completed books in facsimile. Usually, Maggs would offer a recent or prospective purchaser the chance to have an incomplete book completed in facsimile; in most instances the book was exceedingly rare. When it was unlikely that another copy could be obtained, and the book was sought as much for its information content as its iconic status, the argument for completion became compelling. In 1951, Ken Maggs wrote to a client in Uruguay:\n\nI have acquired recently a copy of the first edition of Buenos Ayres Truth and Reason 8vo 1807. I have had the second edition once in my life time but this is the first time I have had the original issue. Unfortunately, the last page which only contains a few words of print is missing and I am having it replaced by an exact facsimile, in fact, I doubt the difference will be discernible. (Maggs to Alberto Dodero, 8 June 1951, uncatalogued file 1683 Part 1.)\n\nRelics and replicas: instruction and wonder in public collections\n\nMuseums have long used replicas in their displays, to protect precious original artefacts, and to illustrate and instruct. But museums also display relics, ancient objects that offer a tangible connection with another time, and instil a sense of wonder. The British Museum’s Sutton Hoo display includes a reconstruction of the shield, a replica that both improves understanding and enhances the wonder of the original artefacts displayed alongside it. Many of the V&A’s replicas, especially of medieval artefacts, have acquired such a patina of age that they now have the status of original artefacts themselves, albeit illustrating a different story from the one they were created to tell. Likewise, the facsimile leaves in the Allport Description of a Voyage perform their original function of filling a gap in the text, and also have their own story.\n\nThis is not to deny the importance of distinguishing original elements from later interpolations. The stakes can be high, for example the forgery of early editions of Galileo and Columbus in the early 21st century (Nick Wilding, ”Forging the Moon”, Papers of the American Philosophical Society 160.1 (2016): 37-72). My point is simply that every element of a book, every accretion, every loss, is part of its history. There are so many situations where a complete book is preferable to an incomplete one that the fastidious collector’s horror of facsimiles is really quite odd. If you want a first edition of Humphry Clinker because you are working on a critical edition, say, you can probably cope with a replica half-title. Maggs’ records show that by the 1920s, a mainstream commercial printer was able to produce facsimiles of such fidelity that the question of their ‘authenticity’ quickly becomes mired in abstruse philosophical arguments.\n\nOne last thought. Which is more authentic: a facsimile drawn by hand, or one produced by a complex industrial process? In the Treasures Gallery at the British Library I saw many wonder-inducing objects, not least a Shakespeare first folio. Intriguingly imperfect: the title page was supplied in hand-drawn facsimile, doubtless an accurate representation, but – perhaps it was the lighting in the gallery – somehow seeming to lack the density and gravitas of print. Yet in that ‘imperfect’ copy there is a work of art executed hundreds of years ago, a loving attempt to complete a famous book.\n\nReports from 2019 Projects\n\nMs Trude Dijkstra (PhD candidate in Cultural History at the University of Amsterdam)\n\nThe Production and Reception of Chinese medicine in Early Modern Europe.\n\nA grant of £2890 generously provided by the Willison Foundation Charitable Trust allowed me to conduct a six-week research stay in London in November and December 2019, primarily to visit the Wellcome Institute and Library. The project towards which the grant contributed examines how the culture of print affected the introduction of Chinese medicine in early-modern Europe. It examines how the print-revolution met the until then unknown Chinese world and its medicine in the Dutch Republic. The objective is to analyse how producers of print influenced the transmission of medicinal information, and how readers received and applied this new knowledge. Through comparative analysis, this project assesses long-term developments and effects (1595-1750) of publishing strategies, marketing-structures, and the reciprocal relationship between printwork and its intended audience(s). Through systematic analysis of textual transmission in books, newspapers, journals, and pamphlets – together with handwritten ‘recipe-books’ – this research gauges the importance of authors, translators, printers, and publishers in shaping the ‘medical consumption’ of China, and how these representations influenced contemporary cultural and scientific discourses.\n\nOver the course of six weeks I daily visited the Wellcome Institute and Library, the British Library St. Pancras, and/or the Warburg Institute to consult research materials, review literature, and discuss my findings and hypotheses with colleagues and peers. The Wellcome Institute explores ‘ideas about the connection between medicine, life and art’, focussing on the history of medicine in a broad sense. Its Library holds an extensive collection of unique materials. Most relevant for my purpose is their unrivalled collection of ‘receipt’ books, containing European recipes for medical (home) treatments. These show how literate Europeans incorporated Chinese medical ideas and products into pre-existing notions of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. These handwritten materials were supplemented by early modern newspapers, books, and learned journals held at the British Library, together illustrating the close connection between commercial goods arriving from Asia and their practical application in Europe. The book historical approach focussing on both manuscript and print therefore provided the ideal opportunity to study both production and reception of intercultural contacts between China and Europe during the early modern period.\n\nTo understand early modern representations of Chinese medicine, I aimed to analyse how texts are related to each other, and how the form in which texts and images are presented influenced the transmission of their content. The innovative character of this project lies in its pioneering a new focus on the materiality of the printed word, through an exploration of the influence of the form and presentation of printwork on the way in which knowledge about China was transmitted. This means that the proposed research methodology was highly interdisciplinary. I used a corpus of different Dutch text types on China, consisting of books, newspapers, learned journals, and pamphlets. The concept of transtextual transmission, derived from literary theory, provided an analytical tool that guided the selection criteria for this corpus. This concept illuminates the relationship between early modern Dutch texts on China and other texts, and how these relationships affect contemporary resonance. The transtextual component was complemented by a focus on paratext – a concept derived from the discipline of book history – which refers to those elements that surround and frame the main text (title-page, illustrations, paper, typeface) together with elements outside of the text (private letters, public announcements, reviews). The resulting data were analysed using an imagological method, derived from the discipline of comparative literature, which studies the ideological circumstances and cultural conventions that determine the emergence of ethnic and national stereotypes. Here, the dynamic of the discourse itself is essential, regardless of whether the stereotype adequately reflects reality. Finally, this research integrates the imagological approach with the book historical concepts of sociology and socialisation of texts and the circuit of communication. Both account for the importance of authors, translators, printers, publishers, editors, illustrators, and booksellers in shaping the medical consumption of China.\n\nThe Willison Grant allowed me further to explore academic research in all its forms, and to share my findings and historical curiosity with a broad range of people, both inside and outside academia. Even before the start of my research visit, I was invited to present my findings at the monthly meeting of the Bibliographical Society of London. There I gave a lecture on Chinese medicine in printwork produced in the Dutch Republic in the Seventeenth century, opening the door to a publication in the Oxford University Press peer-reviewed journal The Library. Furthermore, I have started working on a peer-reviewed article aimed at the BMGN Low Countries Historical Review (Koninklijk Nederlands Historisch Genootschap). In the slightly longer term, the grant allowed me to work on a NWO-Rubicon Fellowship which will be submitted in spring 2020, not only as it provided the research foundation for this application but also because it helped me establish useful contacts in the Wellcome Institute, British Library, and Warburg Institute. In the long term, the Willison Grant works towards a NWO-Ve"
