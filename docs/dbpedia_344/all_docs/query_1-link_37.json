An operation offers a likely chance for a cure, but with the procedure’s cost well outside of the family’s reach, Guled takes to the road to ask extended family members for financial help. The film crosscuts between his journey and Nasra’s life at home, as husband and wife each tell friends and strangers the story of how they met and fell in love. Filmed with subtlety and grace and an O. Henry-like sense of irony, the film is a humanistic plea for society to aid its neediest members.\n\nTrailer\n\nFilm Details"
