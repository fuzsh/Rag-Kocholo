        "text": "Krysten Anderson, 21, has rounded out her first year as a professional Monster Jam truck driver with Grave Digger as her chariot. Her story is one of legacy: Anderson's father, Dennis, is the creator and original driver of Grave Digger -- one of the most iconic monster trucks in the world. Her two brothers, Adam and Ryan, have been driving for nearly a decade as well. Adam drives another one of the Grave Diggers and Ryan drives Son-uva Digger.\n\n\"I realized that my life was different from other little girls around the fourth grade,\" she says. \"The kids in my class took a field trip to my house because we had a huge monster truck shop and gift [store] attached to it. My dad built Grave Digger in the shop. My brother Adam had a ride where, for $5, you could get on the back of a monster truck.\"\n\nAs a teenager, she had dreamed of attending college, but the world of monster trucks caught her attention.\n\n\"I didn't want to look back, I didn't want it to be a big 'what if,'\" she says. \"College would always be there for me, but I wasn't sure how long a seat in a monster truck, especially Grave Digger, would be waiting for me.\"\n\nIn 2017, Anderson competed on the Triple Threat Series, a 10-city tour that challenged athletes in their ability to handle Monster Jam trucks, ATVs and Speedsters. After a year on the Triple Threat Series in small arenas, it was Anderson's time to shine at the Monster Jam World Finals in Las Vegas last month.\n\n\"I was the slowest qualifier last year. I couldn't even make it down the track correctly,\" she says. \"But this year, I was making fast times and every time I made a pass, I was shaving time off.\""
