Just days after his life unexpectedly changed, Zion found the perfect way to honor his late father one night at the Los Angeles Coliseum. Jen Lada\n\nGravedigger – On fourth-and-31, against their rival and with their season on the line, Alabama pulled off a play for the ages that will surely go down in Crimson Tide lore.

John Fornaro\n\nThe Maturation of Quinn Ewers – Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers rededicated himself before this season began, putting behind him the distractions and focusing on what he could do to live up to his potential and achieve a lifelong dream – to lead his beloved Longhorns to a national championship.

Marty Smith\n\nSeminole Fuel – The Florida State Seminoles enter the Orange Bowl undefeated but not unbothered.
