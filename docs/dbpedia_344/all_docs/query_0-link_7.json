        "text": "Krysten Anderson (born May 16th, 1997) is a monster truck driver out of Currituck, North Carolina. She is the daughter of Dennis Anderson and the sister of Adam, Ryan and Weston Anderson. Because of that, she has driven Grave Digger since 2017.\n\nCareer[]\n\nIn 2017, Krysten competed on Triple Threat Series Central. She won her first freestyle in just her second show. Krysten finished 6th. She was invited to that year's Double Down Showdown. For the Grave Digger 35th anniversary encore, she drove the Grandma Grave Digger body.\n\nIn 2018, Krysten competed on Triple Threat Series West and finished 5th. She was again invited to that year's Double Down Showdown.\n\nIn 2019, Krysten competed on Triple Threat Series East and finished 4th. Later that year, she would be drafted onto Team Ice and debut Grave Digger Ice for the inaugural Monster Jam All Star Challenge.\n\nIn 2020, Krysten would compete on Triple Threat Series Central and would be placed 5th after the tour abruptly ended due to the pandemic. In August, she set the new Guinness World Record at the Monster Jam Breaking World Records special event for the highest leap in a monster truck at 33 ft, 9.6 in.\n\nIn 2021, she made her Stadium Tour debut in Houston, Texas on January 30th after her brothers Adam and Ryan drove Megalodon and Bakugan Dragonoid respectively on the tour. She got her first & only stadium freestyle win in Jacksonville, Florida in the same year. She finished 12th on the tour. This is the worst that any Grave Digger has finished on any stadium tour.\n\nIn 2022, she would compete on Arena Championship Series Central and win the series, which would give her an automatic bid to compete at Monster Jam World Finals XXI in Orlando, Florida, as well as qualify for the high jump championship competition, although she would finish last. Also in that event, she would drive the Grave Digger 25th Anniversary body for the Grave Digger 40th anniversary encore. She won the Rising Star award that year.\n\nIn 2023, she drove Grave Digger on Arena Championship Series West and finished in 3rd place. She would later be invited to the main field for Monster Jam World Finals XXII in Nashville, Tennessee and ran a special pink body on her truck. Bari Musawwir fills in for her in Rosemont. Krysten served as the Team Captain for Team Neon for the inaugural Monster Jam Superstar Challenge in Anaheim, California on November 11th, 2023. Her truck was used for the forward momentum backflip as one of the 2 trucks that ThunderROARus jumped over, which was driven by Tom Meents.\n\nIn 2024, she competed on the East Arena Tour. On Friday night in Baltimore, she scored a 1.000 in the donut competition. She finished 2nd to Armando Castro, who got his first career points tour championship. She would still be invited to World Finals XXlll in Los Angeles, where she used the pink body again.\n\nMonster Jam World Finals appearances[]\n\n2017 - Grave Digger (DDS) (Grandma Grave Digger; 35th anniversary encore)\n\n2018 - Grave Digger (DDS)\n\n2019 - Grave Digger (DDS)\n\n2022 - Grave Digger (main + high jump) (Grave Digger 25th Anniversary (fleet); 40th anniversary encore)\n\n2023 - Grave Digger 41 (pink)\n\n2024 - Grave Digger 41 (main field)\n\nMonster Jam All-Star Challenge appearances[]\n\n2019 - Grave Digger Ice (Team Ice)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nKrysten is the first and only female to compete as a driver of Grave Digger.\n\nKrysten is the third female Grave Digger driver, behind Debra Miceli (Madusa) and Heather Williams, but the first competing female Grave Digger driver.\n\nKrysten was the first Anderson sibling to start her career in Grave Digger. (Adam debuted in Vette King and Ryan debuted in Monster Mutt). Weston would be the second.\n\nKrysten is the only female driver to date to win a Monster Jam championship series.\n\nUnlike the other team Grave Digger drivers, Krysten is labeled as being \"Blonde to the Bone\" instead of \"Bad\".\n\nWhen she isn't driving Grave Digger, she works at Digger's Diner."
