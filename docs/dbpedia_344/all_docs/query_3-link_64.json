        "text": "\"It's a pretty good landing with the suspension we have today, the custom built seats,\" Porter, 52, says. These days he drives one of the 10 or so trucks in the Grave Digger fleet, founded by Dennis Anderson in 1982. \"We're strapped in tight to those seats to try and become part of the vehicle. If you become a part of the vehicle and you're not a flying object inside of it, you don't get beat-up nearly as bad as you did in the early days when we'd come loose in some of our seats or seatbelts.\"\n\nPorter will be driving Grave Digger when the Monster Jam truck series returns to Von Braun Center Propst Arena, located at 700 Monroe St., 7:30 p.m. March 14 and 2 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. Tickets ($27 - $57 adults; ages 2-12 receive $15 off the $27 tickets; ticket prices increase $3 day-of-show.\n\nAccording to monsterjam.com, other monster trucks scheduled to appear include Monster Mutt, Fullboar, War Wagon, Black Stallion and Overkill Evolution. The show features racing and freestyle competitions.\n\n\"I was interested in monster trucks before I'd actually seen one in Indianapolis, back in 1982, I think,\" Porter says. He checks in for this phone interview from his Wadesboro, N.C. garage while taking a break from working on his Grave Digger. \"My older brother and all his friends had Jeeps and four-wheel-drive trucks and I sort of caught the bug from them.\"\n\nPorter says Grave Digger is capable of 40-foot-high jumps in an outdoor setting, and about 20-feet-high in VBC-sized indoor arena. In mid-air he says, \"A lot of the times, I'll look over and see what the fans are doing - if they're jumping up and down and hollering - but I have to stay focused on what the next obstacle is.\"\n\nThe body of the Porter-driven Grave Digger is a 1950 Chevy Panel Van. It's said the menacing red headlights on Anderson's original Grave Digger were repurposed from a school bus. Porter's Grave Digger truck runs on a 540-cubic inch, 1,500-plus horsepower engine.\n\nGrave Digger's four tires reportedly measure four feet wide and five-and-a-half feet tall, and weigh 800- to 900-pounds each.\n\nAway from the monster truck circuit, Porter's personal vehicle is a Chevrolet Silverado 3500 pickup. He says it's been about five years since he received his last traffic citation, which was for speeding. \"It's been longer than what I deserved,\" he jokes.\n\nPorter sold his Carolina Crusher monster truck in 2000 and signed on as a Grave Digger driver the following year. \"Dennis and I were good friends. He and I raced a lot against each over the years and traveled up and down the road a lot. We helped work on each other's trucks. We shared hotel rooms when we didn't have enough money to pay for a room by ourselves.\"\n\nClick through the above photo gallery to look at Monster Jam truck series images through the years."
