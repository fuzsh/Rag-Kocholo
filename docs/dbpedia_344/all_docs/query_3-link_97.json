        "text": "Weapon and Armor Proficiencies\n\nA gravedigger is proficient with simple weapons and scythes, and can fight with gravediggersâ tools such as a shovel or lantern as if she had the Catch Off-Guard feat.\n\nA gravedigger is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.\n\nThis replaces the investigatorâs weapon and armor proficiencies.\n\nLimited Alchemy\n\nA gravedigger prepares and uses extracts as an investigator but gains no other benefits of the alchemy ability. This also means that a gravedigger canât take the alchemist discovery investigator talent or any discovery that affects or involves alchemy.\n\nThis alters alchemy and investigator talents.\n\nGrave Magic (Sp)\n\nA gravedigger can sacrifice unused extract slots of the level given below or higher to use the following spells as spell-like abilities, using her investigator level as her caster level and her Intelligence to determine DCs: 1stâexpeditious excavation; 2ndâcalm spirit; 3rdâspeak with dead; 4thârest eternal; 5thâcall spirit; 6thâundeath to death.\n\nRelic Focus (Su)\n\nA gravedigger can form a psychic bond with a skull or bone that she has personally exhumed or recovered from a burial site, using it as an occultist necromancy implement and gaining its base focus power. The gravedigger cannot invest mental focus into the implement and thus doesnât receive any resonant powers. However, once per day she can expend one use of inspiration to use any focus power she knows that has a cost of 1 point of mental focus. She can do this an additional time each day at 3rd level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter. To activate a focus power that costs more than 1 point of mental focus, the gravedigger can expend that number of daily uses of this ability (as well as uses of inspiration) at the same time. In addition, any number of times per day, she can expend 1 use of inspiration to use grave words as spell-like ability.\n\nThis ability replaces trapfinding and trap sense.\n\nDeny Death (Ex)\n\nAt 2nd level, a gravedigger gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against death effects and energy drain. This increases to +4 at 5th level, to +6 at 8th level, and to +8 at 11th level.\n\nThis ability replaces the investigatorâs poison resistance and poison immunity.\n\nRead the Bones (Su)\n\nAt 2nd level, a gravedigger can perform object reading as an occultist, but only on corpses, bones, and other physical remains.\n\nThis ability replaces poison lore.\n\nFocus Talent (Su)\n\nA gravedigger can select a focus power for one of her implements as per an occultist of her investigator level in place of an investigator talent.\n\nThis ability alters investigator talents.\n\nKill the Dead (Ex)\n\nA gravedigger focuses on battling the undead, and her studied combat and studied strike function as if she were 2 levels lower against creatures other than undead (this means she canât use them at all against such creatures until 6th level).\n\nThis ability alters the investigatorâs studied combat and studied strike.\n\nGrave Lamp (Su)\n\nAt 4th level, a gravedigger can form a psychic bond with a lantern, using it as a conjuration implement in much the same way as she uses her relic focus as a necromancy implement. She can expend inspiration to fuel her grave lampâs focus powers the same number of times each day as she can for her relic focus (for example, a 6th-level gravedigger with 6 points of inspiration could expend up to three uses of inspiration as mental focus for her relic focus and up to three uses of inspiration as mental focus for her grave lamp).\n\nThis ability replaces swift alchemy."
