Well I check my stats and my title is grave digger.......can I get rid of this or will it mess up some quests? I heard this game can be quite unforgiving am I screwed?\n\nhttp://i.imgflip.com/1lo7h.gif\n\nTuroko 15 years ago#2\n\nI was able to do all the quests with the gravedigger title, even the Woody quest in the den.\n\nSoIidLegacy 15 years ago#3\n\nThere are 2 graves in the entire game which you can dig up once without getting slammed with the Grave Digger title and those are connected to good deeds. If you dig up any other grave(s), the game will assume you're doing this out of greed and your character will carry the title of Grave Digger for life. This won't affect your game all too much, except it will give you a -5 penalty to your Karma per grave you dug.\n\nChoco: why are americans so weird\n\nomniryu: To make a long story short, self esteem issue.\n\nred255 15 years ago#4\n\nI thought you got grave digger when you LOOTED a grave. not just digging it up.\n\nIf the next one is called, because of his MO, the underwear bomber, you'll know I'm on to something. Calvin Trillin June 16, 2006.\n\nSoIidLegacy 15 years ago#5\n\nDigging is enough to get the title. Plus to answer another unasked question; no, there's nothing to loot in those 2 'legal' graves.\n\nChoco: why are americans so weird\n\nomniryu: To make a long story short, self esteem issue.\n\niforgotnmyname 15 years ago#6\n\nGrave Digger has no negative effect in game. It may or may not be mentioned anywhere, but it won't stop you from doing things like being a Slaver or Childkiller will.\n\nIn fact, in Killap's restoration patch, being a Grave Digger is one way you can solve a quest, or at least get a certain reaction out of somebody.\n\nThe only other thing to note is that there is a -10 karma penalty for each grave dug up.\n\nSo dig away.\n\nYes i am insane. Abnormally insane though. For that reason i can keep my sanity.\n\nCless929 (Topic Creator)15 years ago#7\n\nGreat! By the way I did loot it all I got was beer....... but I have another question how do you get rid of addiction I ttok some rad-away and I got addicted and only off one dose.\n\nhttp://i.imgflip.com/1lo7h.gif\n\nCheesy_Pie 15 years ago#8\n\n^\n\nJust don't use RadAway for a while and you should be back to normal. Now if you get addicted to Jet, that's a different story, since Jet addiction doesn't go away on its own.\n\n>') Nom\n\nSpaceAgeSamurai 15 years ago#9\n\nDrugs and addictions were covered in the sticky.\n\nWhen all else fails, read the instructions."
