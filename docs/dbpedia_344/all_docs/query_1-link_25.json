        "text": "As mothers often do, Gail Anderson summarized her son Dennis’ life with a simple phrase during a recent Sunday morning phone call.\n\n“I was chatting with her before she went to church. She told me she would pray for me,” Dennis Anderson recalled earlier this week. “Now that I’m getting older, she wanted to make sure I didn’t get hurt. I said, `If you’re praying for me, pray that I hit the lottery.’\n\n“She said, `Son, you already hit the lottery when God gave you Grave Digger.”‘\n\nAmen.\n\nWhat started as a weekend excursion in bog racing 30years ago has been transformed into one of the popular, and profitable, operations in American motorsports.\n\nGrave Digger not only is the most recognizable of all monster trucks in the country, but has evolved into a household name.\n\n“I’m just an All-American boy, living the dream,” the 51-year-old Anderson said. “When I first started, I was looking for a decent shop with a concrete floor. It was never a dream to be a professional Monster Truck driver.\n\n“I feel very fortunate.”\n\nAnderson and his truck are the centerpiece of a year-long celebration by promoter Feld Motor Sports to commemorate their 30th anniversary in the sport. The Advance Auto Parts Monster Jam returns to Angel Stadium in Anaheim tonight for the second of three shows.\n\nDodger Stadium will host the tour Feb. 18.\n\n“We will pay special tribute to its place in the history books,” Charlie Mancuso, president of Feld Motor Sports, said about Grave Digger. “More importantly, a celebration of the millions of Monster Jam fans around the world who have supported Grave Digger through the years.”\n\nSo many that Anderson is seeing second- and third-generation fans in attendance at shows on a regular basis. Not only do fans turn out in large numbers, but generate the millions of dollars in merchandising that seem to drive the sport.\n\n“This past Christmas, I was in Walmart and Target and saw the Grave Digger trucks on the shelf,” Anderson said. “I couldn’t believe I created that, I love toys. I know I’m very lucky.”\n\nThe road from obscure Florida swamps to the biggest stadiums in the country has been filled with numerous bumps, literally and figuratively. By his own count, Anderson has crashed more than 2,500 times, but only six have resulted in hospitalization.\n\nAlthough no longer an issue, there were also financial road blocks in the early days, to the point it threatened his future. Anderson credits his fans for surviving those times and moving forward.\n\n“I can still recall getting a letter from a young fan, I could tell by the handwriting,” he said, emotion creeping into his voice. “He was sending us $5 to help fix the truck. We’ve had quite a few letters like that and I can tell you they were an inspiration to me.”\n\nOf all the motorsports disciplines in the country, Monster Trucks have captured the youthful demographic. Anderson believes it’s the ticket prices (starting at $10) that attract families and the action that keeps them coming.\n\n“Our trucks are something kids can relate to,” Anderson said. “It’s not boring or long, but exciting throughout, colorful and loud. In many kids’ eyes, we’re stronger than NASCAR.\n\n“This is bigger than life for kids. They can actually hold the truck while watching us, whether it’s live or on television. I will tell you, that as far as marketing is concerned, Feld is at the top of the world.”\n\nThere was a point in his career the weight of responsibility for the brand was almost too much for Anderson. In 1999, he made the decision to share his Grave Digger license with Clear Channel Motor Sports (which is now Feld). Feld now operates the fleet of trucks that comprise the traveling show.\n\n“I was thinking about retiring,” Anderson said. “I decided to start driving for the fans. My life is better than ever and I’m having fun.\n\n“It’s easier now, no more worrying about getting the next crankshaft or going to a junk yard looking for spare parts, or to make a part.”\n\nGrave Digger has allowed Anderson to turn monster trucks into a family business for his family. Sons Adam and Ryan, champions in their own right, will also compete in Anaheim.\n\n“I just got lucky,” said Anderson, whose early goals were to beat Big Foot, the first well-known monster truck. “As a kid, I was chasing (Big Foot owner) Bob Chandler, trying to compete.\n\n“In 1986, on national TV, we finally beat Big Foot. It was a very big deal for us. If not for Chandler, I probably wouldn’t be where I am today.”\n\nThat’s in front of thousands of cheering and adoring fans."
