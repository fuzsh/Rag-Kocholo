        "text": "Terry Woodcock (Born July 22nd, 1960) is a monster truck owner and driver originally from Othello, Washington. He is the driver of Cyclops and the owner of Freedom Racing based out of Bakersfield, California. He has driven and created many trucks such as D.A.R.E., the chassis for Summit Truck Style,Dangerous Toy, Bruce Ray's Dragon truck, Sunny, Frequent Flyer, Robo Shark, High Flyer & Grave Digger 5 (Huffaker). Besides driving and working on monster trucks, he stars in films and tv shows as a stunt driver or simply just a driver. His trucks also appear in many music videos. He is the brother of Dave Woodcock and Danny Woodcock.\n\nCareer[]\n\nBefore he was into monster trucks, Terry built 4-wheel drive cars in New Mexico. His first time crushing a car was in his 1969 Dodge Charger he built. He later moved to California where he got a job at a 4-wheel drive shop. He later met Gary Gardiner, who Terry helped with Cyclops.\n\nIn 1995, Woodcock acquired the rights to Cyclops, and would begin competition on the monster truck circuit later that year on the Berzerk chassis. The truck featured an S-10 body with a giant cyclops head replacing the hood. Woodcock ran the truck for about two years until he signed a contract with the World Wrestling Federation, which would require him to run trucks based on wrestlers.\n\nIn 1999, he would debut his new truck, Generation X (Wrestling). He would drive the truck with the wrestling sponsorship for a year before dropping it and simply calling it Generation X. He would drive that truck until 2002, when Woodcock decided to bring Cyclops back with an all new design. Cyclops was briefly brought back on the former Generation X chassis, before receiving a completely brand new chassis. The Generation X chassis was then sold to Rex Smith that same year and became King Kong, while the brand new chassis ran as both Cyclops and Red Cactus Crusher until 2005, when it was sold to Don King to become his first Bear Foot. Around this time, Woodcock was building two new identical chassis for his fleet. One of the chassis he was building would sport a 1969 Dodge Charger body, while the other chassis would sport a pickup truck body. Both of these trucks would be sold to Don King before they were finished because Woodcock had financial difficulties, which was the same reason Woodcock sold Cyclops and Venom. The first unfinished chassis would become The General, while the other one would become Torqzilla and later Don King's third Bear Foot.\n\nIn 2016, Woodcock revived Cyclops with a new chassis, that same year Woodcock was inducted in the International Monster Truck Hall of Fame. He still runs Freedom Racing, which lately has switched gears to restoring and bringing back classic monster trucks from the golden age of monster trucks.\n\nHe has run a Bigfoot body on his Cyclops chassis for two shows. He also built the Dr. Doolie truck. Terry also owned Earthquake, Generation X, Shawn ''Heartbreak Kid'' Michaels, Wild Thing, Thunderstruck, Warrior Woman, Big Red, Wizard, Red Cactus Crusher, & Venom, which he was the original owner of until he sold it to Bobby Holman.
