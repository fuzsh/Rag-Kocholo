        "text": "Alright, here we go again!! This season will be one to remember. I love that all of the players have shown their cards already. We already know who is naughty and who is nice. I'm excited to see how the villains will \"get along\". I can see some sparks already.\n\nOkay, we've got five good guys and five bad guys. We've got five good GIRLS and five bad, very bad girls. There will be a lot of fascinating power plays going on to find out who is top dog in each department.\n\nQuick predictions: In the aforementioned categories, I'm saying that James will be the last standing male Hero. Candice will be that last female Hero. Rob will be last Villain standing and Sandra will outlast her female villains. Why? Keep reading.\n\nI have a spreadsheet with all of the characters listed which I will attach when I get to a decent virus free computer. It's confusing with all the different seasons and the rankings as to how they ended up in each.\n\nTo break it down, briefly, there are two returning winners from each team (JT & Tom and Sandra & Parvati). There are three runner up heroes (Colby, Amanda and Stephenie) and four runner up villains (Courtney, Danielle, Russell and Rob). That means eleven of the twenty have made it really far. These people know how to play, they know how to manipulate, then know how to work their own social skills.\n\nHere is a look at the players.\n\nAmanda, 24 lives in LA. She was the second runner up in China and the Runner up in Micronesia (Fans vs. Favorites). She's young, athletic and a strong player. I can see her going far. She doesn't seem to have good luck though. She's imposing, but never quite makes it all the way.\n\nCandice, 27, lives in DC. She was the 5th jurist in Cook Islands. I don't remember much about her, and maybe the others don't either. That could be to her advantage.\n\nCirie, 39 lives in Connecticut. She was the 6th jurist in Panama and the 7th in Micronesia. She is married to some famous football player and had some endearing moments in each season. Most memorable, was when she had to look down the pants of the skinny smoking loony guy from her first season.\n\nStephenie (all e's), 29 is our local girl, living in Philly. It's kind of nice to hear that heavy familiar accent. She is a formidable player with huge athletic skills and no tolerance for whiny, bitchy people. She was the 3rd jurist in Palau, when her whole team was decimated with a run of losing challenges. She returned in Guatemala and made it to runner up. I hate to say that I think her temper will be her undoing.\n\nSugar, 29 lives in LA. She was second runner up in Gabon. This poor girl kept getting selected for Exile Island but lasted a long time. She's adorable, but susceptible to her open hostility for others. She hated Randy in her season, and old feelings may fly.\n\nColby, 35 originally from Texas, now lives in LA. He's a regular on the Rachel Rey show. He is extremely handsome and engaging and wants to do better than previous seasons. He was runner up n Australia and 5th out in All-stars. He and Jerri have a long history of animosity which will be interesting to watch.\n\nJames, 23, is the grave digger from Louisiana. He is a fan favorite with his sweet honest personality. He was 4th jurist in China and 4th in Micronesia after an infection injury. He'll be playing hard to make up for his force out.\n\nJT, 25 lives in Alabama. He won the hearts of fans and the votes of castmates to win the Tocantins season. He was lovable, but seems a bit egotistical now. I think the \"winners\" will have a target on theri backs with the other players, he's got to be careful.\n\nRupert, 45, still lives in Indiana. He used his winnings to provide a save outlet for young troubled teens. This man has a heart of gold, but he wears it on his sleeve. Once he's got something in his head, it's hard to shake it. He was 2nd jurist in Pearl Islands and 6th in All-Stars.\n\nTom, 45, the handsome fireman from NYC won Palau. He's honest and humble. I like him a lot hope his own target isn't too big.\n\nNow for the villians.\n\nCourtney, 28, now lives in NYC (originally from Boston). She was runner up in China. She came across as very unlikeable to her team mates, but I thought she was refreshingly honest. If she can keep her trap shut, she will outlast many.\n\nDanielle, 26, lives in LA. (originally from Boston too). She was the runner up in Panama. Don't remember too much from her, but I think she was a troublemaker.\n\nJerri, 38, now lives in LA. She was 2nd jurist in Australia and 7th out in All-stars. She and Colby will do well to stay away from each other. I'm hoping to see some old tensions arise from the two. Jerri is hoping to redeem herself from her weak spots in All-stars.\n\nParvati, 27, also lives in LA. She uses sex appeal like no other. She will have a tough time of it this season, with only Tyson a ready victim for her wiles. She was the 7th jurist in Cook Islands and the Winner of Micronesia.\n\nSandra, 34, lives in North Carolina. She won Pearl Islands. Not sure why she's on this side of the game. She had a few devious moves, blaming the tall blond for some theft, but as a whole, I think she's straightforward.\n\nCoach, 38, lives in his hometown in California. He's the \"dragon slayer\" from Tocantins where he ended as 5th jurist. His annoying ways will get on the others nerves quickly. He needs to tone it down.\n\nRandy, 50, lives in Texas. He's the crankiest, and most obnoxious of the lot. He was 3rd jurist in Gabon. He and Sugar are enemies which may prove entertaining, if he can keep his comments to himself and the camera.\n\nRob, 33, from Florida (but Originally Boston, can the three Bean-towners get an alliance early on?). \"Boston Rob\" was 7th out in Marquesas and runner up in All-stars. He got his second place price and wed Amber the winner. I love Boston Rob and hope that he goes far. He's a great player.\n\nRussell, 37, from Texas. Runner up in the last season. He really should have won. Not sure how Natalie pulled it off. Russell should have told them he'd give away his winnings, since he was a self proclaimed millionaire. I bet Russell will be kicked off quickly. He's shown his strategy and his season is fresh in everyone's memories. Sorry, Russ, you were fun to watch, but you are going DOWN!!\n\nTyson, 30 lives in Utah. He did have some hilarious interviews. He is so full of himself that he might make it farther than the 2nd jurist in Tocantins. He just needs to shut up and keep his comments for the viewers. I think Parvati will make a beeline right to him. She doesn't have a shot at modeling with the other males.\n\nWell, the season starts in hours. Can't wait!! It's just GOT to be good!!"
