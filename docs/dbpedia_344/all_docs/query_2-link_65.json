        "text": "Article content\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the world of Monster Jam and everything monster-truck-associated, it’s a monstrous event that promises the most high-flying action-packed motorsports experience. This year, four shows are set to take place on April 23 and 24 at the FirstOntario Centre in Hamilton, Ont. — the only Ontario dates for 2022.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nDon't navigate the car buying road alone!\n\nJoin our thriving community on social media and connect with other car searchers and enthusiasts.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nKrysten Anderson is Monster Jam’s only female Grave Digger driver Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nEach of the five tour lineups consist of a mix of drivers and popular trucks. However, each lineup gets a Grave Digger truck, which happens to be one of the most — if not the most — popular Monster Jam monster trucks. And this year, piloting Grave Digger in Hamilton is the first-ever and only female Grave Digger driver, Krysten Anderson, who also happens to be the only female competing for the Hamilton championship title.\n\nAnderson told Driving she is excited to be back in Canada and loves Toronto but is excited to be in Hamilton for the first time. “I really do encourage people to come out and see us compete live. You might have seen us on TV; you might have seen us on social media, YouTube, or on your phone, whatever the case may be, but until you actually come out and experience the monster trucks live — and you’ve heard it, seen it, smelt it — you haven’t experienced a monster truck yet.”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Grave Digger legacy\n\nThe 24-year-old from North Carolina was basically born into the sport, and that high-flying action and monster truck blood seems to run through her veins. Her father is none other than Dennis Anderson, retired monster truck driver and creator of Grave Digger. If that’s not enough — she’s got a whole family of Monster Jam truck drivers, including her two older brothers, Adam and Ryan, and younger brother, Weston, who started this year. It’s safe to say the siblings are carrying on their father’s legacy, and Anderson says they’re very happy to do that.\n\nAnderson got her start in Monster Jam back in 2016 when another Grave Digger was to be added to the fleet, as well as another tour. She was turning 18 that year — the eligible age to audition to drive the 12,000-lb trucks — and thought there’s really no better time to join the family legacy than the 35th anniversary of Grave Digger, which happened to coincide with her father’s retirement the following year.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnd that she did, making her the first-ever female Grave Digger driver — still the one and only. And since then, she has gone on to dominate, winning multiple accolades such as 2021 Save of the Year, as well as breaking the Guinness World Record for the highest ramp jump in June 2020. The previous record was 21.33-feet, but Anderson shattered that by jumping well over 33-feet.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nEven before piloting Grave Digger, Anderson knew she wanted to be a part of the Monster Jam world, as she had previous plans of studying studio art and graphic design at college, mentioning earlier thoughts of a career as a graphic designer for Monster Jam trucks.\n\nWhen asked if she still aspires to design, she said she might still consider that an option but “it kind of just depends on where I’m at and where I end up. I’m a female so things are very different for me.” She added that whatever she wants to be in the future, whether it’s a mom — or something else — she doesn’t necessarily want to be touring all over the world and driving monster trucks for 20-plus years.\n\n“Don’t accept ‘no’ for an answer.”\n\nThe sport has no age limits, she explained; some people only drive monster trucks for one or two years, but many stick around for five or even 10 years. Her brothers Adam and Ryan have been driving for 17 and 13 years, respectively, and her dad drove for 35 years.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhile she says there’s no set time to retire, it can also be hard on the body, and it’s pretty rare to see someone driving for 20 or 30-plus years. “I don’t think I’ll drive for as long as my dad did,” she said.\n\nHome life\n\nWhile Anderson loves traveling, competing, and meeting her fans, she said the worst part of being on the road every weekend is being away from home.\n\nWhen she isn’t driving monster trucks, she’s back home in North Carolina with her family, where Anderson drives a lime green Jeep Wrangler Sahara. She has had it for three years and absolutely loves it, but she thinks it may be time for a change. “I like horsepower. I like to go fast,” she says.\n\n“Growing up, my dad used to have a ’69 Chevelle that was really cool, and we used to take rides in it,” she said, adding that her family loves American muscle. “I think it would be cool to have one of those again, it’s just really sleek.”\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMore realistically, she’s also considering a different kind of Jeep. “There is a Jeep Trackhawk that actually has a Hellcat motor in it, and a Hellcat is really fast. So, I think that would be really cool because it’s like a little sleeper vehicle. It looks like a Jeep Cherokee — a regular grocery-getter — and then it’s got this big, powerful motor in it that sounds insane. I think that’s pretty cool.”\n\nAdvice for young female drivers\n\nThough Anderson was born into the business, she has surely made a name for herself (she’s currently leading in the point standing for her tour) and is very adamant about encouraging young women to come out and compete.\n\n“Don’t accept ‘no’ for an answer,” she said. “I think they shouldn’t give up and they shouldn’t let anyone underestimate them because they’re females.”\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFellow competitor and Max-D driver Blake Granger — married to Monster Jam driver Kayla Blood — said, “Everyone’s story is going to be different,” in regards to how they made their way to Monster Jam, but it’s important to go to shows, meet whoever you can, and get your name out there. It’s important for young kids “to see these female drivers, like Krysten on the tour, and getting the opportunity to say ‘Wow, we can do this too.’”\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nMonster Jam returning to Hamilton, its only Ontario stop in 2022\n\nWatch this five-ton monster truck pull off an impossible stunt\n\nHe also said, “Monster Jam is always looking for these awesome ladies to come out and beat our guys’ butts, so there definitely is opportunity out there right now.”\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnd that’s exactly what Anderson is doing.\n\nShe is currently the only female in her point series, and as of April 10, she’s in first place and leading seven other men; she’s ahead by 36 points. “I think that’s a true testament to not letting men, or anybody, underestimate you or question you based on your gender,” she said, quickly adding, “Don’t let anybody make you question yourself.”\n\nAnderson also explained, “I think Monster Jam is great because this is one of the only motorsport platforms where men and women compete on the same level, on the same track, and at the same time. It’s a completely equal playing field for the men and women.”\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFuture of the Anderson legacy\n\nWith generations fully enthralled in the sport, we couldn’t help but wonder if the Andersons would ever consider doing some type of reality show — think Duck Dynasty, but with monster trucks. Truck Dynasty?\n\nShe said, “Maybe — I feel like our life at home is pretty interesting. Maybe people would be interested to see what it’s like and see what my dad does, now that he’s retired. He’s not competing and on TV as often anymore, so we wouldn’t be opposed to it.”\n\nAs for the future of Grave Digger, Anderson has three nephews who are also obsessed with motorsports and monster trucks. “We have a pretty good inclination that by the time they turn 18, we’ll be passing our steering wheels on to them.”\n\nThe monster truck legacy continues!\n\nSign up for our newsletter Blind-Spot Monitor and follow our social channels on X, Tiktok and LinkedIn to stay up to date on the latest automotive news, reviews, car culture, and vehicle shopping advice.\n\nMore in People\n\nHow Hyundai N ties its street cars to its race machines\n\nBernd Mayländer: F1's Mr. Safety Car\n\nA day in the life of a Hot Wheels designer\n\nMotor Mouth: Is 'Rob The Mechanic' the smartest person on TikTok?\n\nMarcello Gandini, father of Countach and Miura, dies at 85\n\nSee more\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nRenita Naraine\n\nSoon after joining the Driving.ca team in 2021 as an online editor, Renita also began writing car reviews under the Millennial Mom title.
