        "text": "CAN YOU DIG IT? — Thomas Desmond Donnelly IV, rural Clarks Grove, otherwise known as ‘Digger,’ has lived in many places around the world. (Star Eagle photo by Kathy Paulsen)\n\nNative of Ireland has seen, and dug, a lot in his 60 years\n\nAs you ramble through life, whatever be your goal;\n\nKeep your eye upon the doughnut, and not upon the hole.\n\nIrish proverb\n\nBy KATHY PAULSEN\n\nStaff Writer\n\nThere is something about the Irish, and there is a lot about the man and character of Thomas Desmond Donnelly IV. With a sly sense of humor, he describes himself as an \"internment specialist,” otherwise known as a grave digger.\n\nKnown to some as Tom and to many as \"Digger,\" he is like a quick little leprechaun, and as friendly as can be. He was born in Donegal, Ireland 60 years ago. He admits to being the oldest and the smallest of the family of four boys.\n\nHis father was in the Army Air Force, so his family moved around a great deal until he was 18 years old. He came to America in 1953, and has lived in many places around the world.\n\nHe went to elementary school in Japan and Colorado, junior high in Texas, and high school in Utah, where he was named student body president. He then went on to attend college in California, Utah and eventually went to Boston to attend a macrobiotic cooking school. He worked two years as a cook and became a vegetarian for several years.\n\nTom worked as a jockey when he was about 24 for a year. The envy of the jockeys at 5 feet tall and 95 pounds, he had all the makings of being a fine jockey. But, he felt that working with horses was really not his calling.\n\nHe met his wife, Shelia O'Leary, while he was in Boston and after they got married, they moved to Dublin where he was a cook. Shelia got home sick for Albert Lea, her hometown, so Tom found a job working on a farm in the Blooming Prairie area. He worked there for 20 years.\n\nThen, when his father-in-law had a heart attack, they started working as a team to dig graves. Digger has been in the grave business since 1988, digging well over 3,000 graves in as many as 19 different cemeteries. Digger digs graves in many of our local cemeteries including Geneva, First Lutheran in Ellendale, St. Aidens, St. Mary’s, St. Ansgar, East Freeborn, Central Freeborn,North Freeborn, West Freeborn, Hayward and Moscow.\n\nAsked if he digs them by hand, he laughed and said, \"I am glad you asked me that, a lot of people do. No. I use a shovel.\" He feels it is easier to dig them by hand, using a shovel, than by doing it mechanically.\n\nHis slim, little arms of his have learned how to do it, one shovel full at a time. He has learned to work in a rhythm, which really helps. Digger said an \"easy\" grave can be dug in about two hours and 45 minutes. But a tough one, with tree roots and stone, will take four or five hours.\n\nJeff Carlson has been working with him for a number of years. The sexton marks out the grave, and the grave digger removes the sod and proceeds to set up a wooden frame work to hold the dirt that will be used, once the vault and coffin have been put in place. He also has a dump truck that he uses to remove a large amount of the dirt that will no longer be needed.\n\nAt one time, Digger dug about three or four graves a week, but has only been digging about one or two a week now. Generally, his hand shovels last him about three years. He has a couple of his old shovels on display in front of his home and has cut his last name, \"Donnelly,\" into them.\n\nDigger’s dad was a semi-pro baseball player and coach. He was also head of the umpires association while the family lived in Japan. Digger enjoyed playing baseball while he was growing up, always remembering his dad’s advice: \"Keep your eye on the ball.”\n\nWhen Tom was born, in 1951, he was so little they could only estimate his size. The doctors had to run a needle into his head, and as a result, he has always had a bald spot there.\n\nTom has three brothers. They all live in the Western states. His brother Mike is 13 months younger than him and is six feet tall. Mike was selected as all-state in football in Utah. His brother Kevin and his youngest brother, Pat, are also six feet tall.\n\nTom was married for 30 years and is the father of six children. His son, Dan, is a lawyer in Austin and is the father of three. Tom’s daughters, Mary, Bridget and Molly, all live in the Twin Cities area. Mary and Bridget each have one child. Tom’s daughter, Theresa, and son, Tim, both live in Northern California.\n\n\"Mayor\" of Harmony Park for 15 years, he runs the \"Lucky Pub\" there when they have music festivals, which occur about five times a year.\n\nTom lives near Clarks Grove and his favorite foods are shrimp at Geneva Bar and Grill and Irish Stew.\n\nDigger misses Ireland. He would jump at the chance to go back."
