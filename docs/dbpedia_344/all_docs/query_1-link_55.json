After taking him in, the Gravedigger learns that the man is actually the creation of Dr. Victor Frankenstein, who is hunting down his man-made monster before he can kill again. The Gravedigger is faced with the choice of saving the monster, whom he has befriended, or allowing Dr. Frankenstein to exact his bloody revenge. The story asks the question, what does it mean to be human?",
