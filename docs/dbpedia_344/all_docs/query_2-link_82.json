        "text": "Ever wonder what’s going through Gary Porter’s mind when he is locked behind the wheel of Grave Digger, destroying everything that gets in his way during a Monster Jam show?\n\nThink chaos.\n\n\"I can sit there and look at the track and plan this and plan that and hit this obstacle first, second and so on,\" said Porter, of Wadesboro, N.C. \"But when I get into the truck and hit the first obstacle, it might twist the truck different than I planned. Sometimes I do a better job if I play it off the cuff.\n\n\"I just go out and hit the first obstacle and see what happens.\"\n\nGrave Digger and a field of Monster Trucks are returning to Van Andel Arena for the Advance Auto Parts Monster Jam Thunder Nationals. Action begins 7 p.m. today, followed by shows at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday.\n\nMONSTER TRUCKS\n\nWhat:\n\nAdvance Auto Parts Monster Jam Thunder Nationals\n\nWhen:\n\n7 tonight, 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Saturday and 7 p.m. Sunday\n\nWhere:\n\nVan Andel Arena downtown\n\nAppearing:\n\nTrucks include Grave Digger, High Maintenance, Raminator, Rammunition and Spiderman\n\nTickets:\n\nAvailable at\n\nand the Van Andel Arena and DeVos Place box offices. Advance admission ranges from $16.50 to $41.50. Children 2-12 are $11.50 each show.\n\nPorter started Monster Truck racing with the Carolina Crusher in 1985, before joining Grave Digger founder Dennis Anderson in 2001 to race for the sport’s most popular team. Porter will be breaking in a brand new $180,000 truck his team built for the 2011 season.\n\n\"I have a new No. 25 truck that we started running this year. It’s a nice piece and a new truck that people haven’t seen before,\" he said. \"The body is the same and the engine is closer to the front. It has a shorter and narrower wheelbase than the No. 12 that I drove for nine years. It drives and handles a lot better.\"\n\nPorter will be joined in Grand Rapids by hometown Wadesboro rival, Whit Tarlton, who races Spiderman. Tarlton, 41, only started competing five years ago, which is considered a late bloomer in the sport.\n\nTarlton previously worked in the forestry industry. Tarlton drove backloaders, taking rigs into the forests, where he would cut down trees, load them up and haul them to the mills.\n\nBut then Porter helped him break into the sport.\n\n\"I never thought about doing something like this,\" he said. \"I never thought there would be a chance at it. Gary’s brother owned a 4-wheel drive shop, and they always did my 4-by-4s. I did the tire work on heavy equipment and did a lot of work for Gary.\n\n\"Monster Trucks run a lot faster than the skidders and logging equipment I used to drive. You mash the pedal to the floor in a piece of logging equipment and it isn’t going to jump into the air.\""
