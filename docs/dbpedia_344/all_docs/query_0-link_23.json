        "text": "It’s been a while, but I’m ready to stick my toe back in the bloggin’ waters. I spent the last several months home in San Anselmo, chasing after my future livelihood, intimidated and excited about the need to reinvent myself. But I also had a great time firing up the song machine, going to Kerrville, Song School, and the Casey Jones Music festival. I’m ready to get back to the non-business of giving the songs away. I have my friend Ellis’ song in my head. “Start where you are…”\n\nWhere I am is back in Singapore, where our exit strategy is in full swing and every day is one more sweet good-bye. It’s been a good run. Sabrina and I are so grateful for having had this experience. It’s back home for the holidays in November and December. Then January and February is our final stint in Singapore.\n\nOf course, what we’ve missed most here are family and friends. Also playing music with others as opposed to writing music in solitude. This tune, “Days When We Lived Close” is a nod to that all-too-brief time that family gets to spend together. I wrote a whole blah-g for it last December, when we were with our boys in New Orleans. But it was so close to the holidays, which is a rough time emotionally for so many friends, that I balked about putting this sentimental song out there.\n\nSo I’m still sussing out how much sugar is just enough. Sometimes what’s called for isn’t less sugar, but more salt. I like the way poet May Ruefle says it:\n\n“If your teachers suggest that your poems are sentimental, that is only half of it. Your poems probably need to be even more sentimental. Don’t be less of a flower, but could you be more of a stone at the same time?”\n\nMary Ruefle ― , Madness, Rack, and Honey: Collected Lectures\n\nJimmy Webb is another songwriter that was a big influence. I basically learned to play guitar out of reading the chord boxes in a Jimmy Webb songbook:\n\nA critic can call any poem ‘doggerel.' That is no more than a slur. ‘Doggerel' or ‘maudlin' or ‘sappy' or ‘sentimental' is in the ear of the listener. By the by, sentimental is okay as it is defined as ‘marked or governed by feeling, sensibility, or emotional idealism.' It is sentimentality that is to be avoided, like the fiddleback spider, being as it is ‘the quality or state of being sentimental to excess or in affectation.' Again we are faced with a judgement call and must keep a sharp eye on our outpourings to insure they are not overly gooey.\n\nJimmy Webb / Tunesmith\n\nAnd one last quote, from Charles Bukowski. The first poet I ever read that wasn’t part of some school assignment. We spotted him more than once after sneaking into the 9th race at Santa Anita.\n\n“I drive around the streets\n\nan inch away from weeping,\n\nashamed of my sentimentality and\n\npossible love.”\n\n― Charles Bukowski, Love Is A Dog From Hell\n\nRolled Up His Sleeves is based on the true story of going with my friend Dennis to see Bobby Kennedy speak at the El Monte Mall. The song pretty much tells the story. About two weeks later my Mom woke me up to come to the television and watch the live feed from the Ambassador Hotel. Over and over I watched (and listened) to the gunshot replays of my newfound icon lying on the floor, head held by a busboy. Impressionable stuff. I was 11 years old at the time.\n\nThis makes me want to share this song on his birthday. I’d much rather celebrate his life. If I could, I’d just as soon forget the rest of it.\n\nI do want to mention the part of the song that’s fictionalized. I took liberties in making my friend Dennis a Republican. I thought it made for a better story. In truth, as 6th graders neither one of us were affiliated with any party in particular. I apologize to Dennis for any embarrassment this lie might cause. Please bear in mind that I wrote this song several years ago, before the Republican bar was lowered so extremely to its present standard. I’m not sure I would subject my friend to such cheap artistic liberties today.\n\nIn case you haven’t noticed, clowns are a big thing right now. The red nose is peaking. Especially the scary clown. Scary clowns have been walking the streets and lurking in the forest on the news lately. And more recently, the movie adaptation of Steven King’s “It” has gotten a lot of attention. Not to mention the endless depictions of the “president” as a clown. Clown bashing has seemingly joined baseball as a national pastime.\n\nI love clowns, though I’m not a fan of the evil clown phenomenon. I get it though. Clowns are scary; the transformative power of the mask and all that. And I do remember being repulsed by clowns at our town parade as a kid. Getting too close and seeing how the white makeup highlighted the creepy wrinkles of the old weirdo underneath.\n\nAt that same parade years later, when I was in 5th grade or so, my best friend and I followed Ronald McDonald around making nasty comments until he finally snapped.\n\nSo I’ve seen the scary clown up close. Not pretty stuff.\n\nHere’s a picture of me as a clown for Halloween, aged 4 or 5. All I remember is how itchy the ruffle was, and the smell of the slimy red lipstick my mom put on my face.\n\nIt’s hard to like clowns with memories like these. But I came around eventually.\n\nI think I love clowns because they are iconic figures of kid world. I’ve spent so much time working and playing with kids (my livelihood), that I’ve grown fascinated and fond of most things that relate to the culture of childhood. One day I woke up loving clowns. People change.\n\nSleeping With Clowns, is one of my more popular novelty tunes. I want to offer it up for download before the big clown craze tanks. It’s bound to happen. Kinda like that big “folk music scare” of the early sixties. (sorry, I know how that music still creeps some people out.) This tune has a sad vibe that works hand in hand with the humor. There’s a kind of tension created by mixing those emotional opposites. There’s also a dash of bitterness, anger, regret. It’s a freakin’ clown cocktail. Who knew Bozo could be so complicated?\n\nSleeping With Clowns would never have come to be were it not for the influence of kindergartners. Kindergartners are very literal animals. Some examples: when one boy overheard me tell the principal that another child was having an “episode”, he came unglued. He thought I was talking about a cartoon. With tears in his eyes, he asked me, “Did I miss an episode???” Very upsetting. You have to be careful what you say. I had one little girl who refused to come to school on Martin Luther King Day, because she was so freaked out about having to “stand in someone elses’s shoes.”\n\nConsequently, I’ve developed an ear for that kind of literal interpretation. I was in a coffee shop when I overheard two guys talking about their ex’s . “So have you heard anything from Jenny?”…”Yeah, she’s sleeping with some clown…” BINGO! A song is born.\n\nAnd if you happen to be starting your holiday shopping early, here’s some lovely clown gift ideas to get for that “someone special”. I especially like this copulating-clowns Hawaiian shirt.\n\nOr perhaps Smokey The Clown is more to your liking.\n\nAnd.... if you haven't seen enough, watch the video:\n\nIt’s been a while since posting because I’ve been home for the last six weeks or so in California (and song camps in Colorado and Oregon.) I slept off the 16 hour flight upon arrival in Singapore yesterday, so today is like waking up to a blank page. It’s a little daunting.\n\nSince I haven’t been at my desk recording, I’m sharing a song I recorded several years ago that’s never been released. Twisted Open starts with a guy who’s conflicted about home:\n\n“Not my town, not my town\n\nNever felt at home here\n\nGot no friends to gather round\n\nLonely to the bone here. “\n\nIt’s a little bit like the way I feel about living in Singapore, though a tad overly dramatic. Being a Cabana Boy is never really lonely. But truth be told, it was so great being home in America to see family and friends. It had been a long 7 month stretch in Singapore and I was ready to see my peeps. (There were a few I didn’t get to see but I’ll hopefully catch them next time.)\n\nI’m the kind of person who would rather go to the Downton Exhibition than to Nascar or a 49er’s game. I really enjoy historical fiction, costume dramas, and any take on things in the past. And I would generally rather go to a “chick flick” than to some manly “action adventure”. These are qualities I used to keep somewhat hidden from the world (kept my Jane Austen in a plain brown wrapper.) Now I’m trying to be more up front about it. Frankly, I think world could use a little less testosterone.\n\nThis presented some challenges for me in writing this tune. The very term “bodice ripper” suggests a woman being forced against her will. In it’s strictest sense, bodice ripper refers to the romance genre of fiction that was very popular in the 1970s. They typically featured virgin women, pure as the driven snow, and the rapist-turned truelove hero was a common stock character. Contemporary romance novels have come a long way since then. Feminism is alive and kicking butt in much of the historical fiction written today. (For a good article on the subject, read this piece by Jessica Luther in the Atlantic.)\n\nBut I hope the listener understands that I don’t mean bodice ripper in this strictest sense. In fact, I’ve never read any of these novels. The term has come to be used in a much broader sense for any historical novel or drama (though some measure of romance and/or sex is seemingly required for anything to be called a bodice ripper.)\n\nAs I was writing lyrics it began to nag at me that this might not be automatically understood. I began to worry a little about “what people might think”. Consequently, I wrote a “disclaimer” bridge that went like this~\n\nI hope nobody judges me\n\nFor all my gothic fantasies\n\nThese silly dime store novelties\n\nAre a harmless addiction,\n\nMe rippin’ off a woman’s dress\n\nIs just a load of PBS\n\nCu’s no no no cannot mean yes\n\nIn anything but fiction~\n\nThankfully, I came to my senses and the public service announcement wound up on the cutting room floor. The bridge stuck out like a sore thumb and robbed the song of its humor. I couldn’t go there. The song’s supposed to be kinda funny, or at least mildly amusing.\n\nUnfortunately, when writing a humorous song you never really know if it’s funny until someone actually laughs at it. I’m throwing this out there untested, but keeping my fingers crossed. I think it's more a smiler than a belly-laugher. The humor hinges upon incongruity; a somewhat swaggering manly bluster about a predilection that’s generally not perceived as manly at all. Consequently, I turned the letch-level up to eleven. I trust the listener to know that I’m not really the old goat twisted up in petticoats that’s depicted. Anyone who knows me understands that I’ve been faithfully ripping on the same sweet bodice for more than 30 years. That romance got written a long time ago. A great story but not really all that funny. Fiction was required for humor's sake.\n\nI also want to add a little disclaimer. When I gawk and squawk about the weirdness of the place, I mean no cultural disrespect. In my heart of hearts I feel quite the opposite. And also, when crafting the melody and arrangement I tried to hint at an Asian sound. My recording software features a lot of world instrument sounds, so I may have over indulged on the Chinese cheese a little. Some may view this as cultural appropriation. Again, I mean no disrespect. I’m just playing with my toys.\n\n(and... oh fiddlestix! Another disclaimer is in order. While singing this \"rough draft\" demo, my dyslexic-trickster muse inspired me to sing \"Har Paw\" Villa throughout. It's HAW PAR! When I was a kid and pronounced it \"Dickeyland\" everyone thought it was cute. Not so cute anymore. I'll fix it eventually~)\n\n(lyrics here)\n\nI tried to make the song more complex than pure good vs. evil. . Clearly the narrator has his own demons to contend with. They’re not just in the bag. And that gets to the heart of what this is about.\n\nIt seems like many of us are somewhat overwhelmed by the sense that we are living in a dark time. I know I feel that way. And there’s this cumulative effect going on. Things seem to get stormier by the day, and with every new tweet of destruction I wish we could just throw Sauron’s cell phone into the Crack of Doom and be done with him. Deep down inside I’m aware of the faint impulse to want to kill the evil that he represents. In other words, what I perceive as the external shadow triggers my own internal shadow. This is the kind of thing that inspires Kathy Griffin to make poor artistic choices. It’s not who I wanna be, but it is who I am.\n\nTruth be told, he was a man of many friends, and I wasn’t one of his closest. Our friendship was mostly centered around music. We went to shows together, jams, parties, and local bars. We took many road trips to Yosemite for the Strawberry Music Festival. But best of all I spent time with Gordy in his home, where I was frequently invited to come over and make music. Gordy was a human jukebox, and what he lacked in raw talent he mad up for in joyful enthusiasm. Jamming with Gordy was always an exercise in free play. I was encouraged to play any tune, any instrument, any clam. He was everybody’s biggest fan. When you forgot the words to your own song, Gordy would tell you what they were. He also got me a bunch of gigs. My best gig ever, (over 20 years of Sundays at Book Passage in Corte Madera) was thanks to Gordy. You’d be hard pressed to find anyone who had anything unkind to say about the guy, with one small exception… there were a few who wished that he’d tune his guitar a smidge more carefully. But I’d give anything to play with him now, in-or-out of tune. I miss him like the dickens.\n\nEven as a child, the only thing I loved more than going to school was NOT going to school. I’ve always treasured the alternative education that summer provides. A different kind of learning; less structured, more self-directed. There was more creativity and play, more risk-taking, more boredom, and more time. So as an educator I was always out of step with the constant pressure to make summer shorter and the school year longer. I understand the concern over summer learning loss (AKA the “summer slide”) and the detrimental effect this especially has on children from low-income families. But I think that there are other ways to meet the needs of students without tacking on more school days and longer school hours. The negative side of a long summer is easily measured. The positive side, on the other hand, is immeasurable and seldom acknowledged.\n\nSo summer, for me, has always been sacred ground. The song Barefoot in L.A. is my homage to the golden days of June, July and August. I lament the fact that kids don’t get to run as freely as they used to. But as adults we can do a lot more toward providing safe environments where kids can sow their wild oats. It starts with valuing play.\n\nI’ve posted Barefoot in L.A. in the past on my YouTube channel. It was one of my first attempts at playing with music video. The music on the video is a home demo that I put together myself. The song download is a completely different version. It features the low-strung violin stylings of Tom Prasada Rao. Such a cool sound. Sometimes it almost sounds like an oboe to my ears. Drum master Jagoda is laying down the rhythm, and I'm frailing on the uke.\n\nI used to think that this was because my Dad had served in Okinawa in WWII. I figured that cured him of wanting to go anywhere. It wasn’t until I got older that I realized that my parents lived from paycheck to paycheck. I’m certain now that they never really had the means to take us anywhere but up north to visit the grandparents. This serves as an ever-present reminder to me, what a privilege it is to have the opportunity to get out and see the world a little bit.\n\nIt wasn’t until I started high school that I became aware of wanting to travel. The Let’s Go Europe, backpacking-on-a-shoestring thing was in full swing. I read about it and talked to people who had been, and started saving for it. My first trip out of state was to Colorado, my second trip landed me in Paris (1976). Despite camping in the Bois de Boulogne for 4 weeks, I found that I was burning through my nest egg way too quickly, so I headed east toward cheaper adventures. I traveled overland through Austria, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, to India. When I reached Varanasi I hunkered down and stayed for 6 months (leaving once to go to Nepal to renew my visa). I stayed in India until I ran out of money. My parent’s had a yard sale in L.A. to help pay my ticket home. Altogether, I was gone for about 9 months. It was enough to feel bit by the travel bug for life.\n\nBut we are also people who enjoy putting down roots. We so look forward to returning to our home and family in California. And we realize that this addiction for planes, trains and automobiles is not everyone’s cup of tea. I have some dear friends who have little to no desire to leave home, despite having the means to do so. And I don’t chalk this up to living in the Golden State (a great place to never leave, IMHO.) Though I don’t entirely understand this way of thinking, I do respect it. I especially enjoy those local village characters who know everybody, are seen often, and really have no desire to be anywhere else.\n\nWhich brings me to this song, Driftwood Way. It’s about a guy whose roots keep him from going anyplace else. He loves his home. He could never leave. And he’s mostly okay with that, though it’s clearly a mixed bag as he sits by the fire. This tune has kind of a retro-folk sound to my ears. It sounds a little to me like it could have come out of Greenwich Village in the 60s. But it’s another one recorded with Tom Prasada Rao in Texas, (in this present century.)\n\nTo wrap up I want to circle back around to what a privilege it is to have these travel opportunities. It’s something that I’m constantly aware of, but some things really drive it home. Sabrina’s work in Singapore has her traveling home to California about 4 times a year. We can’t really afford to fly Cabana Boy home that often, so I go twice a year. When I get left behind in Singapore, sometimes I go on a shorter, cheaper, jaunt in Asia. About a year ago I was able to return to Varanasi to reconnect with that first exotic trip abroad in my youth.\n\nWhile traveling with an instrument, the truth is I hardly ever play it. So much time and energy goes into being out and about that I rarely feel the urge to work on a song or play for hours. But I underestimated the value of checking in with the strings and making a joyous noise, even if it’s just for a few minutes. It’s like making a phone call back home. It’s kind of grounding that way.\n\nThis song I’m posting for download is called Still My Guitar. I wrote it for my beloved Alvarez Yairi, which sits patiently waiting for me back home in the Bay Area. I kept it at the Singapore love nest for a while, but I began to worry about the effects of heat and humidity, so I took her home last Christmas for safe keeping. I have a utilitarian beater waiting for me when I get back to Singapore in another couple of weeks, and I will be thrilled to see her. But she’s not my main squeeze.\n\nSabrina surprised me with the Alvarez after watching me drool over it at Bananas At Large in San Rafael (back when it was still on the corner of 4th and Lincoln.) That was about 35 years ago. They’ve both been with me ever since. I know a good thing…\n\nFor several years after that Sabrina worked for Acoustic Guitar Magazine in our hometown of San Anselmo. At that time I got to play a lot of amazing, one-of-a-kind handmade acoustics. But I never did play anything that drove me to replace her. We are just plain happy together.\n\nSo the song speaks to that loyalty and longevity. When I wrote the song I tried to give it an element of surprise; to make the first verse sound like I was talking about a woman. But the title is one big spoiler alert. (So is blogging. )\n\nThis is another one recorded with Tom Prasada Rao at the Tofu Bar in Richardson, Texas. Instead of a bass, we used a twelve string. (Which, if I recall, was a trick learned from Drum Master Jagoda.) I love that sound. The Wilbury-esque slide guitar was added later by my dear friend Paul Robinson.\n\nMay everyone be so lucky as to find a guitar they can love deeply and never let go of. Some players find several. Who am I to judge?\n\nDon’t let the facial hair fool you. This is the Gene Kelly of the Blue Danube himself. Pretty bohemian looking for a waltzer, don’t you think? My favorite version of his greatest waltz hit is “The Danube Isn’t Blue, It’s Green” by the legendary Spike Jones and his City Slickers. I had some of his stuff on 78s when I was a kid, and I’m still a big fan. All wild, cartoonish parodies; Weird Al meets Bugs Bunny. Here’s another takeoff, The Black and Blue Danube from Spike’s TV show. Great stuff.\n\nWhen I wrote about Gravedigger’s Boy, I mentioned my love of composing in ¾ time and waltzing too. What better place to share a waltz than Vienna? Of course, the Viennese waltz is a lot faster and way out of my league. I prefer the big, slow, Titanic-nautical-roll. It suits my body type. Besides, I don’t have the duds to dance like an Austrian.\n\nSo this waltz I’m posting is called The Closer You Are. I wrote it a while ago while Cabana Boss was off on a work trip. Sometimes we travel together and sometimes we travel separately. We give each other room to move around that way. So I was missing her when this song popped out. And the bridge, “Sometimes we fight…” is just a big fat lie.\n\nOnce I made a lemonade stand. I painted the signs and my mom helped me make the lemonade. As will happen, I pretty much drank it all myself. When I set up shop out at the curb it was dead as a door nail; no foot traffic, no cars coming to a screeching halt. My mom came out and bought a glass. That was my only sale. This prepared me for the folk business.\n\nIt was fun anyway. Painting the signs. Making the product with Mom. Doing commerce with my one loyal customer. Watching the cars go by... drinkin’... and that was enough. So I’ll never be Minutemaid.\n\nToday I’m opening a new lemonade stand. It’s called setting free the songs dot com. The only difference is this time I’m not trying to sell anything. It’s more like a lemonade soup kitchen for parched ears.\n\nThese days I’m writing my little tunes while living in Singapore. My wife Sabrina took a job here and I tagged along as full time Cabana Boy. There’s no question of doing any music business here. It’s pretty much pop only. There are no venues for the kind of folksy, lyric-heavy, story-driven stuff I do. They'd look at me like Farmer John just stepped out of his time machine.\n\nBut oddly enough, that’s been very freeing. I get to woodshed and work on craft. My Cabana Boy workload is a actually quite light. So my mind is off-leash, taking the long walk in the tropical heat. I'm thinking of new stuff to say, so I'm building a place to say it.\n\nConsequently I’ve had sort of a Jedi mind shift regarding this website stuff. My old website was a dead letter office. I avoided it like the plague, because the pretense of doing business and the charade of sounding professional didn't resonate with me. It felt inauthentic. . Now that I'm in a situation where business isn't an option, a website becomes something I wanna make. Like painting the signs and squeezing the lemons, just building it has been fun. And I'm exited about building a home to put my stuff in, instead of just pouring it down the Facebook hole.\n\nSo here's what I plan to do here. First, I'm giving away the tunes from my first two records. You can freely download them from these links (Sweet River Grace, Gravedigger's Boy). Having lived with these songs for a while, I used them as jumping off points for blogging, so there is a short blog attached to each of the songs (if you're into this reading thing.) From here I plan to post once or twice a week with quick sketches of new tunes and lots of older unreleased stuff as well. Any music will be available for download, no strings attached. I am removing my major stumbling block -- the burden of perfection. I just wanna share this stuff warts-and-all, with the understanding that I may record a better \"definitive version\" down the road. If you want to know when I post stuff, sign up here. If you hear anything you like, help yourself. If it's not your cup 'o tea, no problem. There's a 24 hour Jiffy Mart right up the street. Go buy yourself some Minutemaid."
