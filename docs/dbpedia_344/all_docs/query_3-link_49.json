        "text": "The show of high-flying six-ton monster trucks competing in a series of races and stunt competitions at up to 70 miles per hour will be back in Syracuse this April.\n\nMonster Jam fans will fill the Carrier Dome on April 6 to cheer for their favorite drivers and trucks, including Grave Digger, driven by Adam Anderson.\n\nAnderson has been competing for 14 years in the Monster Jam circuit and you could say he was born to do this job. Anderson’s father is the creator, team owner, and former driver of Grave Digger. Ever since he was a baby, Anderson has been in and around monster trucks and on tour with his dad.\n\nAnderson spoke with us about the Grave Digger family legacy, what scares him more than crashing monster trucks, and what goes on behind the scenes at Monster Jam.\n\nIf someone doesn’t grow up in a monster truck family, how does someone learn to drive monster trucks for competition like Monster Jam?\n\nIt’s crazy to think that my first time I ever jumped cars was in front of a crowd of 15,000 people; all of my training was in public. Now, however, Monster Jam has created Monster Jam University where people can go and be taught not only how to drive, but all the other things that is involved with Monster Jam. There’s media training, fitness training, and it’s all in one place. There’s only a select few that get to go there.\n\nThere’s fitness training for Monster Jam?\n\nThey get people on an individualized plan for going to the gym and train them basically to get beat up.\n\nDo you have a fitness plan that you follow?\n\nI don’t stop driving Grave Digger, and as long as I don’t stop, it doesn’t hurt. All of the employees at our shop in North Carolina go to the local YMCA together.\n\nWhat’s the best part about being in Monster Jam?\n\nIt’s hard to describe. I don’t know if it’s the thrill or the excitement of the people you’re showing off for, but it’s like a sickness. It takes a certain type of person to do this job and a certain type of family to support it. With the amount of traveling we do and the late nights, it is never ending and it goes year-round now with the international component. If you become a part of this and try to leave, you are immediately drawn back to it. It’s an unbelievable opportunity to travel the world and drive a monster truck.\n\nDo you have a favorite country that you have visited so far?\n\nAustralia was amazing to me. It was different than the United States, but getting around was easy, we had access to communication, and every place we went was beautiful. I have been to every major city in the continental U.S. and in comparison every Australian city was clean and the people were so nice.\n\nWhat kind of car do you drive when you’re not driving Grave Digger?\n\nMy addiction is trucks. I have a bunch of older trucks that I fix up and are really cool and I take a lot of pride in. I have two kids though, so for my daily driving I did get a regular vehicle. It’s somewhat of a bigger truck, but I’m just a normal guy driving a regular truck up and down the highway. I get my road rage out on the Monster Jam track.\n\nHow much time a week do you spend on your tricks for Monster Jam?\n\nHonestly, most of the time if I try something new, it’s discussed between the crew and I, I do it at the event. I judge it based on how the other competitors are doing. If they’ve done well and just completed these awesome maneuvers, then I think I need to try something different to try and top them. If you try it and you make it you’re a hero, but even if you crash, you’re still a hero because people love a good crash.\n\nSenior drivers can go to Monster Jam if they’re trying to learn a new trick and they just want to repetitively practice it.\n\nIs there anything fans might be surprised to learn about the behind the scenes at Monster Jam?\n\nWe do private pit parties and people come to meet us and see the nice pretty trucks. A lot of people ask if it’s the same truck I drive during the show. Sometimes they ask if it’s the same truck I drove the night before, or even the week before. I always tell them yes, it is the same. The Monster Jam crew does whatever it takes to get the truck back out on the track again, even after a horrific crash. I always make it back for the next competition.\n\nMy team and all the teams come together to get other competitors back out on the track. It’s a pretty unbelievable feat.\n\nHow many people are on your crew?\n\nThere’s only three guys, but you really don’t want more than that or you will be stepping over each other. Everybody works together to get the job done. The other crews will come in to help my guys if they need it and my guys will do the same in return. We want it to be a fair competition. It is real and legit, but I don’t want to just win because another competitor couldn’t get back out there.\n\nDo you drive other competitor’s trucks?\n\nI have helped other people with their trucks because I have been around them for so long, but I’ve never driven anyone else’s truck. The Grave Digger name has been in my family for so long, I don’t really want to drive anyone else’s truck. Other people have driven my truck though. I don’t care; I want them to. If they think I’m cheating, I say go ahead and drive it and see what it feels like.\n\nWhat kind of pressure is there with the ‘Grave Digger’ family legacy?\n\nWhen I show up to an event and you pull out on the track and there’s 50,000 people cheering for Grave Digger, that’s because of what my dad has created over the past 36 plus years or so. They want Grave Digger to win so there is definitely pressure. It is hard, but a lot of times I thrive on that. It gives me goosebumps every single time because I know people came to see Grave Digger go crazy and that is what I want to give them. I don’t want to let them down. My biggest fear is that the truck won’t start up when I get ready to go, that the dumbest thing will happen and I won’t get to go out in front of all these people who have been behind not only Monster Jam, but Team Grave Digger and my father for 30 plus years. I want to give them what they deserve.\n\nDo you any other extreme activities, like skydiving?\n\nI am scared of heights. I have kids now so I have to hang up Christmas lights so I am just starting to get comfortable being up on a ladder and on my roof at home. We’re on the Outer Banks in North Carolina and right on the ocean so we play in the water all summer long, take ATVs out on the beach with our kids. I have my two boys and my brother has a little boy so it is non-stop playing in the dirt.\n\nAre your sons interested in Monster Jam and being drivers like you?\n\nOne of my sons says he is going to be a doctor, so I’m great with that. He’s been saying it since he was four and now he’s six and I’m not going to stop him. I hope one of my sons will be a driver, but I don’t know if that will happen. Those kids can drive so good already on their ATVs and go-karts. We got them these toys to start conditioning them now in case they do want to drive monster trucks someday. That is what my dad did with us. He would get us cars for Christmas and my brother and I would race them through the woods and around our large property to learn how to drive when we were eight years old. That is sort of the same conditioning we’re trying to do with my kids.\n\nWhat can people expect when they come to Monster Jam at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse?\n\nOne of Monster Jam’s slogans is to ‘expect the unexpected.' It could be the same format, drivers, trucks, and you will never get the same show twice. I think that’s why people keep coming back. It’s a great competition for the entire family to be a part of and cheer for your favorites. I am still a fan myself, watching from inside my truck, and then I realize, “Oh shoot, I have to do better than that guy.” To still be excited about it myself after doing it all these years, something’s done right there.\n\nWant to experience Monster Jam and see Grave Digger in action? Here are the details:\n\nWhere: Carrier Dome, 900 Irving Ave., Syracuse.\n\nWhen: Saturday, April 6. Gates open at 5:30 p.m.; show starts at 7 p.m. The pre-show Pit Party will take place on the Carrier Dome floor from 2:30 to 5:30 p.m. Early access to the Pit Party is from 1:30 to 2:30 p.m."
