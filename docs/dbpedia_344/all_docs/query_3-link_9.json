        "text": "<Background 1> Weary-eyed Gravedigger Hm? How deep are we? Pasty-faced Gravedigger Reckon we should dig a little more?\n\nIt'll all be a wasteland here sooner or later. It's not like you could stick wheels under the graves.\n\nFolks want to leave behind some trace of their lives after they die... but it's all a pointless dream, sadly. Might as well ask for a cremation and have your ashes scattered in the wilderness. Weary-eyed Gravedigger That would put us out of a job, though. Pasty-faced Gravedigger True enough. Weary-eyed Gravedigger If you ask me, graves aren't for the dead. It's the living who need these things... The ceremonies and the big chunk of rock that goes on top of them.\n\nThose are the things that folks say their goodbyes to before starting anew— Pasty-faced Gravedigger Hah, until it's their turn to bite the dust. <Background fades out and in> Andoain The preparations for the ritual are almost complete. Cecelia Um...\n\nI... I'm not sure.\n\nI... I don't feel so good today...\n\nMamma...\n\nMister Friar, I was really happy yesterday...\n\nRosella told me about lots of fun stuff... We prepared for the funeral together, and it felt like... I was doing something for Mamma.\n\nBut... we're done with everything now... What comes next?\n\nI think... I worked really hard... for Mamma...\n\nBut... can Mamma see all that?\n\nDoes all of this... really mean something?\n\nMister Friar, have you gone through this a lot?\n\nWhen it happens... during... the funeral... what... what should I do?\n\nAnd what do I do... once it's over? Andoain Hm. Right, the funeral...\n\nYou're still young, but I don't want to hide anything from you.\n\nWe do a lot of things for others, but, in the end, we do it for ourselves.\n\nCecelia, this isn't selfishness. Rather, it just means that, ultimately, everything that the living do is to mold and shape themselves.\n\nWe hold funerals and say our goodbyes when our loved ones leave us, but it's also a respite for ourselves.\n\nIt's a way to mark the road that we've trodden.\n\nMany grown-ups... use this as a way to find peace, but whether they truly find it, or indeed anything, isn't the fault of the funeral itself.\n\nIt's really up to us, after we go through the thing.\n\nOnce we are done looking back and resting, we must keep going forward. Cecelia But where do we go after that? Andoain That is something you need to ask yourself, Cecelia.\n\nThis is a question that only you can answer yourself, and it's a question that both you, I, and everyone must answer in our lifetimes. Cecelia Ask myself... Andoain Only you can find the right way forward for yourself, and it is only with your own two legs that you can walk that path. Cecelia What about you, Mister Friar? You know so much... What is your road like? Andoain I can't answer you that. I'm afraid I can't even say I've found it.\n\nIt's a tough search, and a sad journey. It makes you wonder if the way forward ever truly exists.\n\nBut I haven't given up, and that is why I, and my brothers and sisters, call ourselves...\n\n...\"the Pathfinders.\" <Background 2> [Ezell searches for something around the chapel.] Ezell Candelabra, candelabra. Where does one find...?\n\n(Somebody's there... That Liberi from the hospital? Patia, was it? And the Legatus called Oren, too. <Background fades out and in> [Oren is seen arguing with Patia.] Oren I really don't get it. What is that guy even doing? Patia Watch your words, Oren. Oren This is the perfect time to act. There are lots of other things we could be doing besides wasting time on a funeral. Patia And I thought you were close to the girl's mother. How cold-blooded of you. Oren I'd already made my decision when I told Andoain about Cecelia.\n\nShe's capable of knocking this city off its godly throne.\n\nThat also means she can shake that saint who's always hiding behind the red and gold curtain... and plenty of others besides. Ezell (What is he talking about?) Patia A Sankta wants to bring down his holy city with the help of a mixed-blood girl? Scandalous. Oren You make it sound like I just want to burn it all down for no good reason. I said \"capable.\" That doesn't mean we have to do it.\n\nIn fact, if we don't do it, then her worth as a bargaining chip is that much more.\n\nI just have to make sure Cecelia doesn't end up in the Pope's hands... On that point at least, Andoain and I are aligned. Patia A word of advice.\n\nI don't know what kind of tricks you're trying to play with Cecelia, but do not forget the promise you made to the Guide. Oren Thanks for the tip... I don't mind walking this path with you folks for a little longer.\n\nNow, you'll have to excuse me. I have better places to be than a funeral. [Ezell eavesdrops the talk between Oren and Patia.] Ezell ......\n\n(Looks like they aren't all on the same wavelength.)\n\n(But what worries me more... is that there's a Legatus involved.)\n\n(I'll take Cecelia and leave once the funeral is over.) <Background 1> Ezell Cecelia. Cecelia! Andoain Senior Ezell, the funeral will be starting soon. [Ezell walks to Andoain.] Ezell Andoain, I don't care about your grand ideals, and I'm not interested in discussing faith with you.\n\nSo once the funeral is over... I'm leaving with Cecelia. Andoain Where will you go? Ezell ......\n\nNone of your concern. Andoain It's time to light the candles, Senior Ezell. Go, be with Cecelia. <Background fades out and in> The early spring mornings are still frigid here in Laterano.\n\nSankta funerals are often accompanied by laughter, music, sweets, and the occasional, inconsequential explosion.\n\nThe departed become one with the Holy Spirit and return to Heaven. This is worthy of celebration.\n\nBut there is another kind of Sankta \"funeral\" unknown to other races:\n\nOn a certain hour of a certain day, a great sorrow will seize all Sankta by the throat. They will not be able to move, breathe, or avert their eyes.\n\nEach and every fragile soul will be swept away as if by the floodwaters of a broken dam.\n\nYet neither the joy of the former nor the awesome power of the latter can be found today in the Ecclesia Requietum of Pagus Stevonus.\n\nWe find only a frail girl, trying her hardest to swing the absurdly unwieldy shovel in her hands.\n\nA girl trying to shovel the last bit of dirt onto her mother's resting place. Andoain Go, Cecelia. It's time to see goodbye. [Cecelia stood before her mother's grave.] Cecelia ......\n\nMamma... What should I do?\n\nWhen I think to myself that... I'm doing this for Mamma, I don't feel scared of anything... I feel like I can do anything.\n\nIt feels like I've gotten a little stronger since you've been gone... Is it because I got a little older?\n\nBut Mister Ezell says... I won't get to see you anymore. Even if I grow up and grow even stronger, I won't see you again... right?\n\nWhen I do a good job, you won't be there to reward me... When I do something bad, you won't be there to get angry at me...\n\nSo, why should I grow up?\n\nMister Friar says... I'm doing your funeral and saying goodbye to you... for myself...\n\nWhat does it mean to do something for myself?\n\nI'm scared... Mamma...\n\nA few days ago, a prioress lady that I don't know told me that, whether we do it with tears or smiles, the ones who are leaving us will accept our goodbyes.\n\nI don't get it... Mamma, should I cry, or should I smile?\n\nMister Friar said it's a question for myself... but I... I don't know... Andoain There is no rush, Cecelia.\n\nYou still have lots of time. ??? Too bad, then, that yours just ran out. [Suddenly an explosion occurs close to Andoain as Fiammetta and Mostima reveal themselves.] Mostima Hey, been a while. Fiammetta I've finally got you, Andoain. Andoain Mostima, Fiammetta... my dear old friends, long time no see.\n\nIf you're here to mourn the dead, I'm afraid you came a little too late. Fiammetta That's alright.\n\nWe can always make some more. <Background 1> [A fight broke out between Fiammetta and Mostima against Andoain and his followers.] Ezell Cecelia, watch out! Cecelia Mister Ezell! Patia Guide... We have to hold our ground! Ezell It's you! Cecelia isn't your bargaining chip! Fiammetta Ezell, give her to me! Ezell ...... Fiammetta Hey, Ezell! What's the big idea? Don't tell me you're working with these... [Patia strikes Fiammetta...] Patia Heretics? Terrorists? Apostates? Are those the only names that the Church can come up with? Fiammetta Out of the way, Patia! Patia You were right, Fiammetta... It's not easy to change the way someone thinks.\n\nThat goes for both of us. [...and both engages in a duel.] <Background fades out and in> Andoain You look like you're doing well. Mostima Much thanks to you. You look like you've aged a lot, though... \"Guide.\" Andoain Haha, I have you to thank for that, too. The gunshot wound took forever to heal. Mostima Hahaha, not bad. Definitely better than having her shoot you. Andoain That is true. Mostima Lemuen almost died. Andoain I know.\n\nIt was the better option, over her bullet. Mostima Looks like that mental illness of yours hasn't gotten any better.\n\nHey, kid. You must be Ezell. Ezell (Another Legata...? What should I...?) [Mostima removes her hood to reveal her horns.] Cecelia ! Ezell A fallen angel?! Miss Fiammetta, what's going on? Andoain Ah... you fell. Of course. You shot at me.\n\nYou can't feel anymore. Mostima So I use my eyes to see and my mind to think.\n\nThe little girl there is Cecelia, right? Cecelia Miss, you have horns, but you also have a halo... Are you a Sankta? Mostima Uh, maybe? I don't exactly know, actually.\n\nListen, Ezell. Bring Cecelia over here. She'll be fine. Ezell I'm supposed to trust a fallen angel? Mostima I've gotta be more trustworthy than a pissed-off Liberi. Fiammetta Hey! You mean that bitch over there, right?! Patia ...... [Patia fires several shots at Fiammetta while she is being distracted, but she deflected them in time.] Andoain Mostima... We haven't finished her mother's funeral yet. Mostima Whoa, I almost bought into that. Are you really such a dutiful curate for this Ecclesia Requietum, Andoain? Fiammetta Mostima! Did you follow me here just to catch up on old times? Mostima Ezell, have you made up your mind yet? Ezell Cecelia, we... [Rosella shows up.] Cecelia Miss... Rosella Cecelia... You aren't done yet. Cecelia Right... Ezell ...... Mostima Andoain, you've got a decent crowd here.\n\nYou brought so many with you just to get Cecelia? Andoain ...... Mostima Oh, almost forgot. I have a message for you. It's from the guy in the Lock and Key—\n\nYour bravery is commendable, but you won't like the final answer. Andoain Thank you for that. I may not be fortunate enough to walk my path with it, but I benefited greatly from its opening my eyes all those years ago. Mostima Look at you... Are you sure you \"benefited?\" Andoain Only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches. Fiammetta —Not good! Ezell, stand back! Andoain Ah... [An explosion occurs.] <Background black> Can you believe it—\n\nI saw an ocean formed of faith. <Background 3> Fiammetta That concludes the report for this operation. Some of my colleagues present were involved in the incident. If you have anything to add, please do. Apostolic Knight Brothers and sisters, I propose we immediately declare a state of emergency across the entire city. Andoain is already enough trouble to deal with, but now we have a 'mixed-blood Sankta' on our hands too. Velliv Gun-Knight Giovanni, the conference is set to open soon. Surely you know that a state of emergency would lead to panic among the envoys? Apostolic Knight Your Eminence, we face a dangerous element. If a little panic could solve the problem at hand, I consider that an easy win. Velliv His Holiness has been planning this conference for years... the \"Summit of Nations.\" It could be the key to Laterano's primacy on land as we know it, but now... a panic threatens to destroy this key. Apostolic Knight And how do you know that Andoain won't bring this conference to ruin if you leave him be? Oren No need to worry, Gun-Knight Giovanni. We're talking about a group of desperate people without a future and a small girl of unknown background. Apostolic Knight Oren, how do you think we Laterans have enjoyed peace for a millennium? It's because we stayed vigilant, taking no chances with such uncertainties! Oren (Even though Laterans set off explosions on the streets day in and day out, huh?)\n\nThe way I see it, the Reverend Gun-Knight just might be looking for an opportunity to use that awe-inspiring but so often holstered gun of yours? Apostolic Knight I take pride in my gun. Got a problem with that?! Fiammetta Please, this is urgent. May I continue? Apostolic Knight ...You may. Fiammetta I'm sure you all know that Mostima and I used to... work with Andoain.\n\nThe Andoain I know isn't one to go off half-cocked. He wouldn't start a war without preparing for it. So even though he could sow chaos in Laterano, he wouldn't do it without a reason.\n\nThe only clue the Astray have given us so far is their attempts on the mixed-blood girl called Cecelia.\n\nWe can surmise that taking her is their primary objective.\n\nAnd since they already have her in their possession, I think Andoain's next step is very likely to be... exfiltrating Laterano.\n\nTherefore, I suggest we focus on the two following points.\n\nFirst, we need to step up our border controls and deploy more guards to the crossings. We should also form a special elite squad to locate their hideout and bring Andoain in.\n\nSecondly, to be on the safe side, I would like the Seventh Tribunal to lead the investigation into whether the Astray have made contact with the visiting envoys to determine whether or not they are targeting the conference.\n\nAs for the conference itself... Mostima Proceed according to plan, right? That's what you have in mind, isn't it? We're just testing the waters, anyway.\n\nOh, I've got to say, though. The cold buffet's desserts are disgusting. The cactus tarts are an atrocity. I would like to see some improvement there. The Pope I think there's a certain charm to the taste. Velliv I agree with Mostima on that point, and that point alone. Apostolic Knight Blasphemy! I think they're delicious! Fiammetta ...... Oren Gun-Knight Giovanni has spoken. I suppose we can all agree, then? Velliv Agreed. Mostima Anything that Giovanni likes, you know is bound to be terrible. Apostolic Knight Mostima, belittling me again, are you?! Fiammetta .................. The Pope Please, my children, quiet down. I'm too old for all this bickering.\n\nThe laws instruct us to face the unknown with goodwill...\n\nWe mustn't treat fruit tarts with such scorn. Velliv And why am I unfamiliar with this law? The Pope I just thought of it this morning. Fiammetta ..................\n\nYour Holiness... The Pope We'll go with your plan.\n\nVel, Giovanni, give Fiammetta all the help she needs.\n\nAndoain... will make his way to his goal. <Background 4> Mostima Phew... This is why I hate closed-door meetings... Fiammetta We spent three minutes on the main topic! The rest of the meeting was everyone babbling their stupid side conversations! [Ezell run towards Fiammetta and Mostima.] Ezell Excuse me, Seniores? May I ask what the decision was? Fiammetta You're still here.\n\nI'm taking over the Andoain case. Thank you for your work the past couple days. You should head home to get some rest. I'll talk to the Notarial Hall later. Everything you've done will be written off as you helping us out. Ezell Miss Fiammetta, I... Fiammetta Anything that comes after this is way beyond the bounds of your authority and ability. Don't forget. You're still in training.\n\nI know you're worried about Cecelia, but I'm taking over this case, and that's the best case scenario you could hope for. Ezell ......\n\nMiss Fiammetta, are you friends with this... fallen angel? And the both of you are familiar with Andoain? Fiammetta That's right. Ezell Is that your answer to both of those questions? Fiammetta ......\n\nWe aren't familiar. We're nemeses.\n\nBut don't you worry. I won't take it out on Cecelia. I don't really understand what was going on with her this morning... but she's still a kid.\n\nWhat about you? You stayed there for two whole days. Did Andoain say anything to you? Ezell Just a bunch of heretical nonsense. Fiammetta I suggest you forget all of it, then.\n\nYou still have your whole life ahead of you, right?\n\nGo home and take a couple days off, then keep up with your good work at the Notarial Hall. You are pretty qualified for the job if you ask me. Mostima Cherish your life, you know? Life in Laterano is precious. Even I look back on it fondly sometimes. [Fiammetta and Mostima leaves.] Ezell My life...\n\nRight, unlike them, I'm just a regular nobody.\n\nOkay, let's clock out!\n\n...... <Background 5> Patia The Pontifica Cohors have taken over the border checkpoints, and the Apostolic Knights are keeping an eye out for us too. We won't be making it out anytime soon... We have a safehouse, but still...\n\nI can't get in touch with Oren either... Dammit! Andoain No matter. We can wait. Cecelia ...... Andoain Cecelia? Cecelia ...... Andoain Do you regret your decision? Cecelia I don't know...\n\nBut if I went with Miss Fiammetta... she would've taken me... to the Basilica, right?\n\nI still haven't figured out... my goodbye to Mamma. Andoain It's okay, Cecelia. You still have lots of time to think. Cecelia Mister Friar... There was a lady with horns and a halo in the Ecclesia Requietum just now... Is she... a Sankta? Andoain Maybe. Maybe not. It's up to her to decide. Cecelia I thought... Sankta are Sankta? Andoain That's true for most of us.\n\nBut some people get to choose. Or perhaps I should say they don't have a choice but to choose, because of some... unfortunate circumstance.\n\nIncidentally, you too have to choose, Cecelia. As for whether that is fortunate or not... no one can tell. Cecelia Can't the Sankta be with the Sarkaz? Andoain If you're always worrying about everything, you won't get anything done.\n\nPeople will always fight. Neither \"gentleness\" nor \"understanding\" can stop that.\n\nA lot of times, when people fight, it's not because one side is right and one side is wrong. It's because the things that both sides have to do conflict with each other.\n\nIn other words, the things that you and I need to do are different, and that means we're in somebody else's way. Andoain ......\n\nBecause, for a lot of people, the path that they take is determined by the path itself.\n\nFor example, the Sankta and the Sarkaz. No one can say why the two sides fought each other at first, but the hatred between them has paved the road for everyone. Cecelia Can't we choose our own path? Andoain We can, Cecelia, but it's not that simple. If you want to leave the path you are on and find a new path forward, you must first make your way through a boundless wilderness...\n\nIt's vast and empty there. You might never find that new path, even if you give up everything you've ever known. Cecelia Then... why do we still have to look? Andoain Right... why do we have to look?\n\nMaybe it's because that's what we want. Cecelia \"What we want...\" Is that so important? Andoain It's the only thing we still have. Cecelia ......?\n\nMister Friar... Can I ask a question? Andoain Go ahead. Cecelia What is it that you want? Andoain Cecelia, can I tell you a little story? Cecelia Sure, Mister Friar. Go ahead. Andoain Many years ago, when I was still young, I ran into some... setbacks, and then I left. Cecelia Where did you go? Andoain Anywhere. I traveled everywhere.\n\nThere was a place I stayed for a while. It was a very small town, and it felt a little like my hometown.\n\nBut it was even more run-down. Life was tough for everyone there. Cecelia (Huh? That doesn't sound like Laterano...) Andoain Once, I passed by the town's pub and came across a humming drunkard. He threw up all over me and insisted that I'd tripped him, and that I should pay for his drink.\n\nEveryone in the pub... no, everyone in town laughed at him and cursed at him.\n\nThose who were scared of him avoided him. Everyone called him a dirty, filthy moron, a lowlife, a sick scumbag... He was a Sarkaz.\n\nThey never chased him out of the town, however. He kept living from one day to the next, doing little odd jobs.\n\nThen, on one windy, rainy night, a night when no one would go outside, the church's bell started to ring. It was an alarm, and it woke everyone up... There were... some bad people in town.\n\nIt was lucky that the bells woke everyone. It was hard, but we chased the bad people away. No one knew who rang the bells, and we all thought it was a miracle...\n\nI headed in the direction of the bell tower and reached the wastes beyond. There, I found the church watchman digging a grave. Next to him was a cart, and in it a thin coffin, with the Sarkaz drunkard inside, wounded all over.\n\nI started to help digging. The watchman kept complaining as he dug. He said he was saving the casket for his mother and it was a waste to give it to a Sarkaz. Then he complained that he'd have to bury the sick Sarkaz...\n\nThe watchman said that, not long after the bells started ringing, the Sarkaz came and knocked on his door, telling him to run, before the man died at his doorstep.\n\nThe watchman said that since he saw it was about to rain, he couldn't bear seeing the Sarkaz man sleep out in the streets, and so he let him into the bell tower for the night.\n\nHe kept complaining and kept digging. Then, when he was finished, he stood in front of the grave and sang a song that the drunkard always used to sing, even though he didn't remember how the second half went.\n\nIn the end, he complained a little more, and poured half a bottle on the grave.\n\nThe winds through hills on high...♪ Tail the hero's farflung stride...♪ Over long ways long...♪ Over briars and thorns...♪\n\nSorry, I don't remember it either. Cecelia That's... the song that Mamma and Rosella taught me...\n\nSo... the Sarkaz man rang the bell? Andoain I think he did. Cecelia So he was the hero that saved everyone? Andoain Maybe. I don't know if someone like him can be called a hero, but I think most people probably wouldn't want to call him one.\n\nMaybe he was just trying to help the watchman who helped him. Cecelia What about you, Mister Friar? Do you think he was a hero? Andoain ......\n\nWhat is a hero, Cecelia?\n\nI thought about it for a long time... but I know that the answer to this question doesn't tell us who the Sarkaz man was. Rather, it tells us who I am.\n\nI don't think he himself climbed up the bell tower to be a hero.\n\nBut it doesn't matter if we sing his praises, look at him with scorn, or even forget about him. None of that changes anything about him anymore.\n\nAll the questions that I pondered have nothing to do with him. Only me. Why did I witness this? What does it mean to me? How is it going to guide me forward?\n\nIt is always the living who are questioned.\n\nBut I kept thinking and thinking, what if he didn't do what he did?\n\nWhat if he did it, but led the fanatics... the bad people to the bell tower?\n\nWhat if the townspeople couldn't fend the bad people off even after they got woken up?\n\nAnd what if... what if he even died on the bell tower, and no one ever found him?\n\nThere are no guaranteed successes, and there are no choices that are certain to be right.\n\nSo I came to this conclusion. On that rainy night, he climbed up the bell tower because he wanted to.\n\nIt's the most straightforward conclusion, out of somewhat stubborn goodwill.\n\nWhether that's true or not doesn't concern him.\n\nHe was a hero, no different from the hero in the song. Rosella The winds through hills on high...♪ Tail the hero's farflung stride...♪ Cecelia Over long ways long...♪ Over briars and thorns...♪ Everyone starts humming the song.\n\nTheir quiet singing drifts throughout the room.\n\nI feel peace.\n\nIn this Lateran evening.\n\nA peace that I have not known for a long time. Cecelia Are you thinking something, Mister Friar? Andoain No, nothing at all.\n\nThank you, Cecelia. Cecelia You're looking at something...\n\nIs that a bell tower? Andoain It's Laterano's bell tower. A very, very old tower made of stone. I often went there when I still lived in Laterano. It was so close to Heaven. Cecelia Heaven... Is that where Mamma is? Andoain If that's where you wish for her to be, that's where she is. Cecelia Mister Friar, could you help me with something?"
