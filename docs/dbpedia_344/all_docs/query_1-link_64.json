        "text": "WORCESTER, Mass. - You could say driving monster trucks is in Weston Anderson's blood.\n\n\"Ever since I was young, I always grew up around the truck,\" he said. \"It seemed normal to me because I didn't know that everybody didn't grow up with a monster truck.â\n\nThe 19-year-old is the youngest son of Dennis Anderson, the creator of Grave Digger.\n\nLike his siblings before him, Anderson has taken the reins of the iconic monster truck.\n\nThis year is different though. The Andersons are celebrating the 40th anniversary of Grave Digger.\n\n\"This truck, it is my family,\" Anderson said. \"Whenever you say Grave Digger, they automatically think of my family. If it wasn't for Grave Digger, we probably wouldn't have a Monster Jam.\"\n\nAnderson spent some time driving smaller trucks, but this is his first time competing with monster trucks.\n\nHe only had three weeks to train before hitting the road in 2022.â\n\n\"There's a ton of veterans on my tour,\" he said. \"I think the person with the least experience next to me has 5 years under their belt and this is my 6th weekend.\"\n\nThis weekend, he'll be tearing things up at the DCU Center.\n\n\"My favorite thing by far is the Monster Jam freestyle,\" Anderson said. \"That's where we come out here and we have 75 seconds to do whatever we want. We wow the fans. We have back flips. We have moon walks. We have crazy saves. Anything you can think of, and even then some, we do in these trucks.\""
