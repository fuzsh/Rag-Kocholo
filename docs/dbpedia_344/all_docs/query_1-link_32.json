        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Monster Jam is kicking off their 2024 season in San Francisco and it's their first time back inside of Oracle Park in more than 10 years.\n\n\"Grave Digger,\" one of the most iconic and popular monster trucks is one of seven that will be competing and putting on a show over the weekend.\n\nThe concept for \"Grave Digger\" was developed more than 50 years ago by Dennis Anderson, the father of the driver of this truck, Adam Anderson.\n\nIt was originally built out of an old 1951 Chevy Panel Wagon and parts scrounged up from junk yards and it's now one of the most decorated trucks in the world.\n\nThe driver, 38-year-old Adam Anderson, has five Monster Jam World Championship wins under his belt.\n\nOrganizers of this event say Oracle Park's very unique footprint right on the water will make for one of the most compelling settings for a Monster Jam event this year.\n\nMonster Jam kicks off on Saturday with a Pit Party at 12:30 p.m.\n\nDoors open at 3:30 p.m. and the event starts at 5 p.m.\n\nOn Sunday, doors open at 12:30 p.m. and it starts at 2 p.m.\n\nTickets for this weekend start at $20."
