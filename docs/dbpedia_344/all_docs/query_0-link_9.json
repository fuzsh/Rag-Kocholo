        "text": "The most visited grave in Goldfield is that of the Unknown Man Died Eating Library Paste. But, the famous cemetery is filled with stories of life in the Wild West. While most stories revolve around who is buried at the historic cemetery, a few are about those who dug the graves, including Goldfield’s Grave Digger’s grave.\n\nJohn F. Meagher\n\nJohn F. Meagher was born in Iowa on January 18, 1845. He mined in Colorado and had multiple claims on Independence Pass in Pitkin County.\n\nMeagher moved to Goldfield in 1905 or 1906. Thomas Dunn, the undertaker, employed Meagher as a grave digger. During the winter of 1906, when Goldfield had a “large death list,” Meagher reportedly made a fortune and employed multiple additional diggers.\n\nBy 1918, Meagher was an aged and feeble man, but he continued to dig graves for Goldfield. Diggers often ran into rocks at the cemetery. Explosives blasted through the rock so the rows could remain orderly.\n\nOn March 27, 1918, Meagher was digging a grave in the Catholic section of the cemetery. It appeared that after he set the explosive, he was unable to climb out of the grave. The explosion sent a rock into Meagher’s brain, and it is thought, and hoped, that he died instantaneously.\n\nNeighbor Mrs. May noticed newspapers pilled on Meagher’s porch. She and Tom May, the road supervisor, went to the cemetery to investigate. They found Meagher dead in the grave.\n\nMeagher was only 73 when he died. He reportedly had a sister in Omaha whom The Knights of Columbus attempted to reach.\n\nGoldfield’s Grave Diggers Grave\n\nIn a twist of fate, the cemetery interred Meagher, where he died. The Coroner “held an inquest on the body.” Records do not clarify if Meagher’s body was removed from the grave or remained where he fell.\n\nWANT MORE GHOST TOWNS?\n\nFor information on more than five hundred ghost towns in Nevada & California, visit the Nevada Ghost Towns Map or a list of Nevada ghost towns.\n\nNevada Ghost Towns Map\n\nReferences\n\nFollow me on social media:"
