        "text": "We’ve been contemplating our mortality here at Brainiac Central lately. A handful of friends and colleagues have shuffled off this mortal coil, too soon, too suddenly. A friend from college, two friends from newspapers we worked at before this one. It’s a sad thing all around.\n\nSo now, when Brainiac drives by Westminster Memorial Park, we look askance at the lush green lawns, thinking, “Don’t get any ideas, Mr. Gravedigger, you aren’t planting us 6 feet under any time soon.”\n\nOf course, once you start thinking those kinds of thoughts there’s no stopping them, which is how we found our way down the rabbit hole of Findagrave.com and discovered all kinds of famous folks are planted in our hometown boneyard.\n\nInstead of just telling you, though, let’s have some fun and do it quiz show-style. See how many you can figure out from the clues we provide, OK? Let’s begin.\n\nThe harried police chief\n\nAfter Batman and Robin, Alfred and Commissioner Gordon, Gotham Police Chief O’Hara was probably the next most-seen character in the kitschy ’60s TV series “Batman.”\n\nHe was the master of stating the obvious – “All adds up to a sinister riddle … Riddler!” – and he often seemed to try the patience of Batman, who often spoke to him like a child, for instance: “Let that be a lesson. In the future, be more careful from who you accept free lemonade.”\n\nHe died in November 1974 of a heart attack while playing the ponies at the Hollywood Park racetrack and was buried in Westminster. Who was he? Batman knows; do you? All the answers are at the end of the story.\n\nThe rock star who OVERDOSED\n\nThis guy had it made. A Long Beach native, his band’s mid-’90s success with a blend of punk rock and reggae made it a favorite on stations like KROQ-FM with songs about smoking two joints, practicing Santeria, looking for freedom in a 40-ounce bottle of beer – all well-established forms of rock ’n’ roll bad behavior, right?\n\nFor bonus points, his band, oh, it was a sublime act, even wrote a song titled “Garden Grove.”\n\nHe took it too far, though, in May 1996 and died of a heroin overdose in a hotel room in San Francisco. A few days later, he found his final freedom in a plot at Westminster Memorial Park. Can you name him? See the answer below.\n\nA Vietnam war hero\n\nThe Marine Corps lance corporal was an orphan from New Mexico who ended up in a very bad spot in the Bo Ban Hamlet of Quang Nam province in August 1968. After securing a spot for the night, he and his platoon mates were awakened by cries of, “Grenades!”\n\nThis 20-year-old did that classic move of military self-sacrifice and heroism – he threw himself on the grenade. It cost him his life but in the Medal of Honor commendation it was said his actions had almost certainly saved the lives of five fellow Marines. Can you name this hero who came home to a plot in Westminster?\n\nThe answers\n\nChief O’Hara was played by Stafford Repp. The rock star is Bradley Nowell of Sublime. The Medal of Honor winner was Lance Cpl. Kenneth Lee Worley.\n\nNowell grew up near here in Long Beach, so his burial here makes sense. We’re not sure why Repp or Worley were interred here, whether they lived here, too – so if you know, give us a shout!"
