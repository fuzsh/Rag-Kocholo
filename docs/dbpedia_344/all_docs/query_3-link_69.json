        "text": "When all is said and done, when you have contended with the hampering undertow of Joyce Carol Oates’s flaws, there comes a moment when you surrender to the overpowering force of Joyce Carol Oates’s virtues. You yield to Oates much as her beleaguered heroines yield to the relentless, intoxicating strength of her dangerous men.\n\nOates’s routes of excess often lead to rambling mansions of truly apprehended life. On the other side of her sentimentality lies a rare intensity of feeling; driving her melodrama is a heightened receptivity to tragedy. Her stereotypes fall, like overripe fruit, from the fertile boughs of her archetypes. This is especially true in earlier novels like “Them,” “American Appetites” and “Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart.”\n\nOates’s fiction courses around the twin poles of our national existence: hybridity and fluidity. That makes her the most American of writers. But being quintessentially American also makes Oates vulnerable to a peculiar pitfall of American velocity — getting too excited about everything that happens. Oates is addicted to events. She is an Eventophile. Like small towns, her novels are often fixed on something sensationally dramatic that took place long ago and can’t be shaken out of local memory. Her fictions pull like wild horses against this gravitational violence for hundreds of pages until something snaps and “closure” comes.\n\nHer need for closure, in fact, is Oates’s great weakness, just as the evocation of exhausted yet resilient people straining for a fresh start is her greatest strength. There is more than a little Oprah in Oates’s swings between grotesque sadness and sunny self-reinvention. That is to say, there is more than a little Hollywood schmaltz. But if something unreal hangs about Oates’s overheatedness, then that is what also keeps her true to the overheated, unreal-seeming nature of American life, in which Hollywood movies seem less entertainments than actual experiences. Schmaltz can provoke powerful feelings, after all.\n\nStill, Oates achieves success as a storyteller when she overcomes her tendency to surrender to extremes. Her latest novel, “The Gravedigger’s Daughter,” springs to life when its central character, Rebecca Schwart, becomes pedestrianly shrewd rather than remaining superhumanly afflicted. The source of Rebecca’s monstrous ordeal makes the first half of the novel mostly rough going. Along with so many other American fiction writers, Oates has discovered the Holocaust, and she labors mightily to incorporate it into her distinctive vision.\n\nRebecca is the daughter of Jacob and Anna Schwart, German-Jewish refugees from Hitler. In 1936, they flee to America with their two young sons, Herschel and August; Rebecca is born in New York Harbor while the family is still on the boat that brought them over. A former mathematics teacher, soccer coach and printer’s assistant, Jacob can find work only as a gravedigger and cemetery caretaker in the small town in upstate New York where the Schwarts have settled. Haunted by Nazi demons, his ego battered by prejudice and humiliation in his new life, Jacob torments his terrified wife and children. Finally he erupts and commits an incredible act of violence, traumatizing Rebecca yet at the same time releasing her into the world and a new beginning.\n\nPerhaps conscious of her plot’s mythic weight — the European gravedigger’s daughter reborn in America — Oates doesn’t bother to give her secondary characters much depth. Jacob, Anna, Herschel and August don’t so much act as reiterate the identities Oates has assigned to them. Once again, she has created people who teeter between archetype and stereotype. They thrive as the former when she evokes them in affecting expository passages, but they lapse into the latter when they interact along obvious lines. “Electricity doesn’t grow on trees, want not waste not,” the predictably parsimonious refugee Jacob likes to tell Rebecca, with equally predictable malapropism. Like many of Oates’s heroines, Rebecca must outmaneuver her creator’s literary purposes every bit as much as she must escape the social barriers of her world.\n\nAt moments, Oates herself seems slyly aware of her own obtrusive artifice, particularly in her portrayal of Rebecca’s relationship with her first lover, Niles Tignor. Passages in which she repeats words as if in a shaman’s trance, and in which she alludes to some primal combat between man and woman, must be — one hopes so — conscious allusions to D. H. Lawrence: “She felt the thrill of her will in opposition to his. She felt almost faint, exulting in her opposition.” (Except that Lawrence would never have succumbed to the jingly “thrill of her will.”) After the jealous Tignor beats her and cheats on her, Rebecca flees from him with their young son, Niley.\n\nHere is where the novel at last becomes gripping and fresh. Through a portentous coincidence, Rebecca changes her name to Hazel Jones. Borrowing a name from the Bible, she makes her son Zacharias. Oates is at her best describing Rebecca’s slowly growing attachment to Chet Gallagher, the disaffected scion of a wealthy family, who has found a second life playing jazz piano, just as Rebecca and Niley will find a second life with him. Oates’s nuanced suggestion that jazz and movies — Rebecca meets Chet when she is working as an usherette in a movie theater — are regenerating opportunities for the aspiring American self amounts to a beautiful inhabiting of real people’s everyday dreams.\n\nBy that point, you might just forgive writing that has become so rushed it sometimes appears semiliterate. Oates’s maddening habit of using “that” instead of “which” in a nonrestrictive clause — “most of the papers continued to run Chet Gallagher’s column, that had won national awards” — is too ugly and incoherent to be an attempt at stylistic innovation. Such indolence is surprising in a writer of Oates’s caliber.\n\nBy the end of the novel, Rebecca/Hazel has thrown off her father’s corrosive pessimism and drawn strength from his cynical cunning. She exists as a living, breathing, complex presence on the page. For the sake of her son, she exploits Chet, yet amid her maternal machinations she genuinely loves him, and Oates’s depiction of such ungraspable ambiguity is masterly and wise. The novel’s epilogue, an exchange of letters between Rebecca and a previously unknown cousin, a college professor who has written a book about surviving Theresienstadt (and whose embittered virulence Rebecca almost fiendishly reduces to its essential naked need), is virtually Dostoyevskian.\n\nAs a connoisseur of modes of American doom, Oates is sometimes compared to Theodore Dreiser, the author of “Sister Carrie,” a fictional guidebook to American variations on going under. But in the way her novels take off at the moment when her heroines break free, Oates is sometimes more like Carrie herself, more like a person writing about experience than a novelist writing about “them” — about nonwriterly people. At moments like that, you want to say about Oates what Ford Madox Ford said about “Sister Carrie”; you want to shout to the sky that Joyce Carol Oates is “a goldenish spot in the weariness of the world.” Too bad all those sloppy, self-indulgent pages keep getting in the way."
