        "text": "Feb 27, 2009\n\nMichael Vaters and the K&N Ford Powered Black Stallion Team took on the Monster Truck competition in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.\n\nMonster Truck Black Stallion flies the K&N Flag in the Wachovia Arena\n\nMonster Trucks Black Stallion and Grave Digger battle it out in front of a sold out crowd\n\nSix of the top trucks on tour battled it out on the Monster Jam Tour with Michael Vaters in the Stallion, and Vaters won several of the events throughout the four show weekend.\n\nIron Warrior propels through the air at Wachovia Arena in Pennsylvania\n\nMichael Vaters pilots the K&N Ford Powered Black Stallion as top Monster Trucks battle for the points win\n\n“The tone of the weekend competition at Wachovia Arena was determined by the results of the wheelie contest,” said Vaters. “There was a four way tie until a silent judge determined that the winner was hometown favorite Andy Slifko in Eradicator. This sparked a fire in me and I was determined to show the fans Black Stallion ruled the arena regardless of the scores.”\n\nIn round one of racing, Monster Mutt defeated Backdraft, Black Stallion defeated Grave digger and Eradicator defeated Iron Warrior. In the semi-finals, Eradicator defeated Grave Digger and Black Stallion defeated Monster Mutt. In the finals, Michael Vaters and the K&N Ford Powered Black Stallion rocked the house with an upset win over Grave Digger.\n\nVaters and the team worked frantically to replace the starter and solenoid just as Black Stallion was about to begin the freestyle run. The officials called off their run with only seconds to go and Grave Digger was declared the winner.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the competition was fierce in the freestyle competition. Iron Warrior began with a good run but Vaters was determined to take the win in freestyle. That did not happen because the judges found him just short of the win.\n\nOn Saturday night, Michael Vaters and the K&N Ford Powered Black Stallion took the win in the Wheelie competition in front of a sold out crowd. “When it was time for racing, I was on a mission,” said Vaters. “I marched through the rest of the field to take on Grave Digger in the finals. We roared to take off as the starting light turned green and I drove the K&N Ford Powered Black Stallion to the win. Gary Porter lost a transmission in the Digger as he tried to catch the Stallion.”\n\nVaters was on a roll. The freestyle had all the drivers pushing their Monster Trucks to the limit. Vaters launched over the cars and van stack landing at the far end of the arena. Next, he launched the Black Stallion backwards over the van stack in reverse. Finally, Vaters cross- threaded off the cars and landed on the van stack in his last jump.\n\n“I use K&N Engineering’s injector and oil filters,” said Vaters. “Over the years I’ve used a lot of products and K&N can handle the Monster Truck scene. We are known across the country for a wild and crazy driving style and the ability to push the limits at indoor and outdoor events. We’re hard on our motors and K&N protects our engines.”\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Vaters and the K&N Ford Powered Black Stallion took the win with the highest score of the weekend. “I kept the truck dialed in on win,” he said. “Everyone knew we ruled the Wachovia Arena all weekend.”\n\nMichael Vaters and the K&N Ford Powered Black Stallion will be in their hometown Monster Jam this weekend at Baltimore’s First Mariner Arena.\n\nFind K&N products for your vehicle using the K&N application search then use the K&N dealer search to find a K&N dealer in your part of the world."
