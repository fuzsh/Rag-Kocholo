        "text": "Kane Brown and Marshmello joined forces on a high-energy music video for “Miles On It,” the duo’s first collaboration together in five years.\n\nMarshmello took a “quick 24 hour trip to Nashville,” to join Brown on the music video set, the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-born DJ and producer wrote in an Instagram caption last week. In that post, Marshmello shared photos and videos offering behind-the-scenes glimpses of the video, which includes the Grave Digger Monster Jam truck.\n\n“Girl, let's go put some miles on it/ Back of the Chevy with the engine running/ Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King/ We could break it in/ If you know what I mean/ Put some miles on it/ Back of the Chevy with the engine running/ Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King/ We could break it in / If you know what I mean/ Put some miles on it / We could break it in/ If you know what I mean/ Put some miles on it”\n\nBrown and Marshmello released “Miles On It” earlier this month. It’s their first collaboration together since they teamed up on “One Thing Right” in 2019. Brown previously teased on his Instagram story that he and Marshmello had “the song of the summer” on the way. the single arrives as Brown is in the midst of his headlining “In The Air Tour,” titled after a lyric in his Phil Collins-inspired anthem, “I Can Feel It.” Brown’s tour includes special guests Tyler Hubbard, Jon Pardi, Chris Young, Bailey Zimmerman, Cole Swindell, Parmalee, LOCASH and RaeLynn. Brown’s wife and “Thank God” duet partner, Katelyn Brown, who is pregnant with Baby No. 3, previously said she plans to join her husband on tour as much as she can."
