        "text": "Featured\n\nTales From The Tree\n\nAunt Edith Ingold with husband James Puddifant and children at Croxley Green Farm, Edgware @1906\n\nPictured above is Edith Ingold Puddifant, older sister of my grandfather George Ingold. She’s pictured with her husband James Puddifant and 6 children. I’ve dated this about 1906 because Edith had two more daughters in 1907 and 1910. She was likely pregnant at the time this photo was taken. Note the footstool.\n\nEdith had 8 siblings: Bertha, Esther, Maggie, Harry James, Lilian, George, Frank and Charley.\n\nMy father never met any of his Ingold aunts and uncles or any of their descendants. My grandfather George was 10 years younger than his sister Edith and didn’t father children until his 40s, so even though the children in this photo are my father’s first cousins, they are over a generation older.\n\nThe family is pictured at the Puddifant farm, Croxley Green, in Edgware UK. James Puddifant is the picture of of a gentleman farmer in fine clothes, proudly showing off his watch chain and large family. The boys (Charles and James Jr) and their sisters, (Mary, Maud, Lucy, Edith Jr) are immaculately dressed and Edith wears a high necked blouse and patterned jacket. I imagine the photo was meant to celebrate their prosperity as a family.\n\nI realize it wasn’t common to smile in photos back then, but I enlarged Edith’s photo and I can’t help but notice how tired she looks. Tired and sad (she’d be about 32 in this photo). Aside from that, I see the family resemblance to my grandfather George and the Ingold features – a long oval face, equally long nose and an unusual and somewhat distinctive mouth which turns down at the edges.\n\nThe Puddifants eventually emigrated to Canada to join my grandfather in 1912, where they farmed in Headingley, Manitoba for several more decades. Here’s a photo of them in later years at their home in Winnipeg. I am astounded how much my father and his sisters resemble Edith…\n\nEdith Ingold Puddifant b. 1874 Edgware, UK d. 1935 Winnipeg, MB\n\nFeatured\n\n2023: 52 Ancestors in 52 Weeks: Week One: “I’d Like to Meet”\n\nI’m travelling back in time to Tuesday June 25, 1895 to meet my great grandfather, Henry John Ingold. I’ll visit him at his carpentry shop on High Street in Edgware, England and introduce myself as the granddaughter of his son, George.\n\nHere’s what I will say to Henry:\n\n“Henry, tomorrow morning you will take a walk down Church Lane towards Doctor’s Hole pond. After swallowing a bottle of hydrochloric acid, you’ll neatly hang your coat and hat on a fence, then wade into the pond and die by drowning.\n\nI understand how sad and depressed you are. You are slowly going deaf. You have been mourning your wife for 5 years. You also wrongly believe your business is failing. It is in fact, prospering.\n\nLet me tell you how your suicide will affect those you love:\n\nYou will leave behind 9 children, ages 23 to 5. The two youngest will be placed in an orphanage.\n\nYou will be the 8th of your mother Sarah’s 9 children to predecease her.\n\nYour eldest daughter will find your suicide note and testify at your inquest. She’ll shoulder the burden of shepherding her siblings to adulthood and finally marry at age 33 to a hapless man who will eventually hang himself, leaving her penniless with 6 children.\n\nYour second daughter has just given you your first grandchild.\n\nWithin 10 years, all 9 of your children will scatter and there won’t be a single Ingold left in Edgware despite being a prominent local family for over 200 years. Your 4 sons will emigrate. The eldest will go as far as South Africa, never to be heard from again and with no known descendants\n\nAt least 2 of your sons will suffer from crippling depression and linger for years in insane asylums. Your middle daughter will contract syphilis at a young age and die horribly of syphilitic paralysis, also in an asylum.\n\nYour youngest son will become a shiftless and is eventually deported from Canada on a smuggling charge.\n\nYour son George will be the grandfather I never meet. He will grow up to be a bitter, larcenous man who believes the world is out to cheat him. He will pass on his own morbid depression to his daughter.\n\nSo, I’m asking you Henry, please don’t take that walk down Church Lane tomorrow. Do not subject your children to the trauma of losing you that way. They need you and your grandchildren will need you. You have friends and community who respect you. Let them help you lead a healthier life and leave a healthier family legacy. Do not take that walk…”\n\nHenry John Ingold b. Edgware UK, d. Edgware UK, 1895\n\nFeatured\n\nTales From The Tree\n\nHarry James Ingold: The Long-Lost Uncle\n\nb. Sept19.1879 Edgware UK d. Aug14.1945 East London South Africa,\n\nOn August 14, 1945, Harry James Ingold died alone at Frere Hospital in East London, East Cape, South Africa. The cause of death was “carcinoma of the esophagus”, and “cachexia” – a kind of anorexia related to cancer. He was 65 years old. Occupation: “Caretaker at Tattersalls Club”.\n\nThe only thing my father knew about his Uncle Harry James Ingold was “he went to South Africa to look for diamonds and the family never heard from him again”.\n\nIn 2017 we found an interesting item in my late Aunt Glenna’s belongings: an uncashed cheque payable to her for $20,000 dated March, 1942, signed by “H. Ingold, Esq”. It was drawn on my grandfather’s George’s local bank account, but the signature was clearly an “H” in the penmanship style of that era.\n\nWe briefly wondered if Harry had come to Canada to visit his family in 1942, but eventually decided George was playing a prank on his daughter, weaving a tale of his long-lost brother being rich enough to write her a $20,000 cheque.\n\nI really wanted to find out what actually happened to Harry to the point that when my Aunt Glenna was on her deathbed, I desperately wanted to ask what she knew about him.\n\nHarry James Ingold was the 5th of 9 children born to Henry John and Lucy Hannah Ingold in Edgware, UK. He was 15 and just out of school when his father took his own life. At 19, but claiming to be 23, Harry boarded the steamship Goorkha on October 1, 1898, destination: The Cape, South Africa. Harry’s stated profession – “miner”, which fits the family story. There was only one place he could be headed: The Kimberley Mine.\n\nBelow: The Steamship Goorkha\n\nBelow: Harry Ingold’s manifest entry. The voyage took 42 days!\n\nThe Kimberley Mine, Northern Cape, South Africa\n\nIf Harry actually arrived at or worked as a miner at Kimberley, it’s certain he didn’t stay long. An egregious example of colonialism, the Kimberley Mine was rampant with disease and violence. The abuse of black workers was horrific. Only the De Beers family profited, otherwise it was a place to die. Kimberley even had it’s own cemetery.\n\nBelow: Kimberley Mine, 1900\n\nBelow: Kimberley Mine today – one of South Africa’s top tourist attractions\n\nCape Town and Service in The Boer War – 1901\n\nIn 1901 Harry was living in Observatory, a suburb of Cape Town. He lived on Station Road in Albany Park.\n\nBelow: Station Road, 1901\n\nOn January 19, 1901, he walked into Drill Hall at Cape Town to answer a call for militia men for “Warren’s Mounted Infantry”. His attestation lists his occupation as “horse trainer”. He was unmarried at the time, naming his next of kin as his eldest sister, Bertha Maud Ingold.\n\nWarren’s Mounted Infantry played an unremarkable role in the Boer War. Harry served as a Trooper from April to August of 1901.\n\nBelow: Standard Kit for Mounted Infantry and Warren’s Mounted Infantry Uniform Badge\n\nAfter his stint in the Boer War, Harry returned to England, but not for long. On September 20, 1902 he sailed back to The Cape from Southhampton.\n\nBelow: Harry James Ingold’s return to South Africa on the ship’s manifest. The voyage took 65 days!\n\nHarry must have had high hopes for his prospects in South Africa, otherwise why endure over 2 months on a steamship in 3rd class?\n\nLater Life\n\nThe lack of access to South African records makes it difficult to trace Harry’s further life in South Africa. After 1902, there is a 40 year gap in my research except for a few snippets:\n\nThe 1906 Red Book South African city directory lists Harry as living in a suburb of East London, Eastern Cape and working as a clerk for the Cape Government Railway at Komgha Station.\n\nOn December 8, 1908 Charley Ingold, Harry’s youngest brother placed an ad in the London Echo. Charley was about to depart from England to South Africa as a Private with the 7th Hussars. I don’t know if the two ever connected again.\n\nOn January 31, 1939, Harry James Ingold claims his Boer War Victory Medal 38 years after his service.\n\nOn September 7, 2020, this death record popped up for me on FamilySearch.org Discoveries like this make many hours of tedious research worthwhile.\n\nBelow: Harry James Ingold’s last known address: 47 Longfellow Street, East London, SA. Note the bars on the windows and doors. South Africa is a dangerous place.\n\nBelow: East London is a tourist town today…\n\nMarriage\n\nAlthough the death certificate indicates ‘single”, there is evidence that Harry had been married. I found a 1971 South African burial record for a Kate Ingold, described as divorced and born the same year as Harry. I was unable to connect her with any other Ingold in South Africa. Lastly, a 2nd cousin provided this photo of Harry and his wife. She has a ring on her left hand. Judging by Harry’s boxy jacket, I would say the photo is from about 1910, so it’s really not certain when the family lost contact with him.\n\nBelow: Harry James Ingold and wife c. 1910.\n\nLate Life: “Caretaker at Tattersalls”\n\nSince the 18th Century, Tattersalls has bred and auctioned race horses, as well as sponsoring prestigious races all around the world. In Harry’s time, Tattersalls operated a chain of betting shops throughout the country.\n\nBelow: Tattersalls Betting Shop in Johannesburg\n\nI hoped for a better ending for Harry James Ingold, but his is another sad tale in the Ingold family: a young man travels to faraway land hoping to get rich, but at the end of his life he’s sweeping floors and emptying ash trays in a bookie joint.\n\nHe should have stayed in England.\n\nFeatured\n\n52 Weeks of Ancestors – Week 7 – “Landed”\n\nGrand Aunt Maggie Ingold and the Long Grove Asylum\n\nRecently I broke through the final “brick wall” in my family tree. What ever happened to my Grandfather George’s spinster sister..?\n\nMaggie was born on March 16, 1878 making her 6 years older than George. She appears in both the 1881 and 1891 censuses as a daughter living with the family in Edgware.\n\nBy age 17, she had lost both parents.\n\nFrom BritishNewspaperArchive.co.uk I learned she participated in plays and music programs, taught school at age 16 for 4 shillings a week, and was a bridesmaid at her sister Edith’s wedding.\n\nMaggie is missing from the 1901 Census, but in 1911 she is a 33 year old spinster living in 2 rooms in Paddington and working as a Draper’s Assistant (Shopgirl).\n\nAfter 1911, nothing – no records whatsoever in regard to Maggie – no directory entries, no voting records, no travel, no workhouse and most importantly, no death record. In 2016 I realized I would have to wait 6 years for the 1921 UK census. It was a long 6 years.\n\nIn the meantime, I developed some wild theories about what happened to her: perhaps she was one of the victims of the great 1911 heatwave in England, or succumbed to the Spanish Flu around 1918. I also clung to my father’s anecdote that one of his aunts had drowned in Lake Winnipeg (now debunked).\n\nImagine my disappointment when, after 6 years of waiting for the release of the UK 1921 census in January 2022, Maggie was not there! How does someone just disappear? It was as if she didn’t want to be found, even in death.\n\nIt was when I came into possession of my grand uncle Frank’s asylum records that I learned solid information about Maggie. Frank’s patient record notes the family history of melancholia, citing his father’s suicide and a sister who suffered from depression and died at age 45. Since I knew the death dates for all the Ingold siblings, this “sister” could only be Maggie Ingold, who would have been 45 in 1923.\n\nI now had the approximate year of her death thanks to Frank’s records. So, I went back to the 1921 UK census and found an interesting entry contained on a patient register from Long Grove Mental Hospital, Epsom, Surrey: “Freda Ingold, age 43, born in Edgware, single, a draper’s assistant”, the identical information as in Maggie’s 1911 census form save for the given name. I had finally found my grand-aunt.\n\nSometime after the 1911 census, for whatever reason, Maggie took to calling herself “Freda”.\n\nOn FindMyPast.co.uk I found a burial record for “Freda” Ingold who died in the Long Grove Mental Hospital in early February, 1922 at age 44 and was buried in a pauper’s grave in Morden, Epsom, Surrey.\n\nSo, why did Maggie Ingold re-name herself as “Freda”? I wondered if she had some sort of dissociative identity disorder, but when I ordered her actual death certificate, the story became clear: Tertiary Syphilis\n\nCause of Death: “General Paralysis of the Insane” (GPI)- a fatal disease brought on by tertiary syphilis. GPI was more common in male patents and usually appears 10-30 years from the date of infection, meaning Maggie could have been a young teen when she contracted it or as old as 30.\n\nSymptoms of General Paralysis (Paresis) of the Insane\n\nDelusions can be grandiose, melancholic, or paranoid including ideas of great wealth, immortality, thousands of lovers, unfathomable power, apocalypsis, nihilism, self-guilt, self-blame, or bizarre hypochondriacal complaints. Later, the patient experiences jerks, confusion, seizures and severe muscular deterioration. Eventually, the paretic dies bedridden, cachectic and completely disoriented.\n\nFreda Dudley Ward on the cover of “Tatler”, April 1919\n\nIt’s entirely possible that “delusions of grandeur” were a symptom of her condition and she fancied herself a celebrity.\n\nMaggie (Freda) Ingold b. Edgware UK 1878, d. Epsom UK 1922\n\n52 Weeks of Ancestors – 2023 “My Favourite Photo”\n\nHere’s a photo of my grand aunt Edith Ingold Puddifant, older sister of my grandfather George Ingold. She’s pictured with her husband James Puddifant and 6 children. I’ve dated this about 1906 because Edith had two more children in 1907 and 1910. She may very well have been pregnant at the time this photo was taken.\n\nI value this photo because Edith was my father’s aunt. My father never met any of his 8 Ingold uncles and aunts and knew little about them, so by extension, my siblings and I never met or knew about any of his Ingold cousins or their children. My grandfather George was 10 years younger than his sister Edith and didn’t father children until his 40s, so even though the children in this photo are my father’s first cousins, they are over a generation older.\n\nThe family is pictured at the Puddifant farm, Croxley Green, in Edgware UK. James Puddifant is the picture of of a gentleman farmer in fine clothes, proudly showing off his watch chain and large family. The boys are similarly dressed in suits and short pants. Edith has outfitted her young daughters in frilly white dresses and immaculate hair styles. Edith herself looks like a very upstanding Edwardian woman with her full pompadour, high necked blouse and patterned jacket. I imagine the photo was meant to celebrate their prosperity as a family.\n\nI realize it wasn’t common to smile in photos back then, but I enlarged Edith’s photo and I can’t help but notice how tired she looks. Tired and sad (she’d be about 32 in this photo). Aside from that, I see the family resemblance to my grandfather George and the Ingold features – a long oval face, equally long nose and an unusual and somewhat “prissy” mouth which turns down at the edges. Noting that family resemblance gives me comfort.\n\nThe Puddifants eventually emigrated to Canada to join my grandfather in 1912, where they farmed in Headingly, Manitoba for several more decades. My grandfather moved to Niagara Falls, Ontario in 1923 and never saw his sister again….\n\n52 Weeks of Ancestors – Week 12 – “Joined Together”\n\nMy Grandmother Was A Bigamist\n\nOn May 7, 1917, my grandmother safely crossed the border into Canada at Emerson, Manitoba with $25 dollars on her person. She was listed on the manifest as “Mrs. E.G. Folsom”. It was likely the last time she would go by that name. She had left her American husband in Fairmont, West Virginia and was returning to her previous life in Winnipeg, as a single woman named Lina Walker (Pronounced “LIE-na”). She was the only woman to cross the border that day.\n\nBelow: Canadian Immigration Admissions at Emerson Manitoba, May 7, 1917\n\nYears later, she would confess to my mother: “he was an awful beast, he made me do terrible things”. As kids, we always knew George Ingold was her second husband, that she had never divorced Edward Folsom. She always claimed she didn’t know there was any such thing as divorce. We knew that was nonsense: her own sister Lottie had been divorced.\n\nLet’s go back to the beginning ….\n\nOn July 3, 1911, 25-year old Angelina Walker married Dr. Edward Folsom in Toronto. He was a native of Chicago and a recent graduate of the Ontario Veterinarian College. The newlyweds made their home in Fairmont, Virginia where he was employed as a horse doctor at Consolidated Coal Company.\n\nThere’s nothing unusual in any of that other than only a few weeks earlier, she had been enumerated in the 1911 Canadian Census as living in Winnipeg at the same rooming house as her sister Ella, and another man who hoped to marry her, our grandfather, Walter George Ingold.\n\nBelow: entry from 1911 Census of Winnipeg, taken in June of 1911.\n\nWe know Lina and George were a couple at this point, because her sister, Lottie Walker Thompson, announced it in the local newspaper.\n\nWinnipeg Tribune, July 25, 1910\n\nWhatever possessed Lina to suddenly abandon George Ingold and run off to Toronto to marry Dr. Folsom?\n\nI have a theory:\n\nIn 1910, George Ingold was working as a meat cutter for Wm. Coates Meats. I’m guessing Lina’s siblings, particularly her older brothers in Toronto, didn’t think George was good enough for her.\n\nAfter all, sister Ella was a nurse, sister Jennie had married a respectable shoe store manager who would eventually own his own shop in Barrie and Lottie married an insurance broker.\n\n(I say these things because Lina herself was a bit of a snob – all we ever heard from her as kids was “you must marry a doctor or lawyer”….”so and so is a teacher”…”this person is a banker”. She judged people by their profession”. )\n\nSomehow, on a visit to Toronto, she met Dr. Folsom, recent graduate and a member of an elite University of Toronto fraternity. Lina may very well have been manipulated by her 3 Toronto brothers – Hawley was a successful clothier with his own shop, Chauncey was a manufacturer of farm equipment. A third brother, Frank Walker, a grocery wholesaler, would eventually help George buy into his own grocery business in Niagara Falls in 1923.\n\nI really believe the siblings didn’t want Lina to marry a “meat cutter”.\n\nBelow: Dr. Folsom’s University of Toronto fraternity credentials likely knocked the Walkers off their feet.\n\nThe marriage certificate offers evidence that could support my theory of family influence.\n\nThe ceremony took place in York (east of Toronto) where her brother Chauncey Walker resided. One of the witnesses to the marriage is “Bob Walker”, who lives at 420 Brunswick Avenue in Toronto, which just happens to be the the address of Lina’s brother, George Hawley Walker. Hawley’s fifteen-year son old “Bob Walker” must have gotten a kick out of being a witness to a marriage. Also witnessing the marriage is one of Lina’s and George’s Winnipeg room-mates, Annie Mutch. The cuckolding of George Ingold was complete.\n\nWe’ll never know exactly what Lina endured during her 6 year rust-belt marriage to Dr. Folsom but it drove her to an act few women of the time considered. According to my father, Frank Ingold, an unhappy Lina consulted her sisters and they urged her to return to Canada. I like to think she left without Folsom knowing.\n\nFolsom was the first to commit bigamy: he married Lillian Baker in 1918, then Evelyn Hamilton in 1924. Both women divorced him on the grounds of “extreme cruelty”. No children came from any of his marriages, so there’s that.\n\nLillian Folsom divorce – 4 years of marriage\n\nEvelyn Folsom divorce – 5 years of marriage\n\nRecently on a genealogy site, I spoke to a descendant by marriage to Dr. Folsom. He confirmed to me that Folsom had been repeatedly whipped behind the woodshed as a child and he learned to “give what he got”. A brother of his was an angry alcoholic.\n\nBack in Winnipeg, Lina reunited with George Ingold. In January of 1920 they travelled to Hennepin Country, Minnesota where they were married. Presumably they thought a US marriage would throw a smoke-screen over her Canadian marriage. The nuptials were never valid and she risked 5 years in jail if caught. They spent a few years “on the run” in Regina, Calgary, Vancouver and Toronto before settling down in Niagara Falls, Ontario in 1923.\n\nThe date below is incorrect. I’ll have to order the certificate for proof.\n\nWhen I was younger, I judged Lina as squeamish about marriage and there is plenty of evidence of that, but now, with all the information about Folsom and how he treated his subsequent wives, I sympathize with her. She just wanted to be rid of him, and men held all the cards legally.\n\nDr. Folsom died in 1930. I remember Lina showing us a news clipping about him, which I now possess. I don’t know where she got it, but she kept it all those years. I wonder why…?\n\nBelow: Angelina Walker (1886-1977)\n\nBelow: Edward G. Folsom (1886-1930)\n\nWalter George Ingold (1884-1954) and Lina Walker in Headingly, Manitoba about 1920\n\nTales From The Tree\n\nThe Resilience of Aunt Bertha Maud Ingold\n\nOn July 11, 1917, 47-year old Frederick James committed suicide by hanging himself at his workplace, William Barker’s butcher shop. He left behind his widow, Bertha Maud Ingold, 6 children and a history of professional failures.\n\nBelow: 9 Chalk Hill, Bushey, UK where Fred James hung himself\n\nTragically, it wasn’t the first time Bertha had suffered the suicide of a loved one.\n\nTwenty-two years earlier her father, Henry John Ingold drowned himself in an Edgware pond. Henry had been suffering from melancholia since the death of his wife and wrongly believed his business was failing. His suicide shaped the direction of Bertha’s life.\n\nIt was Bertha who found Henry’s suicide note. She was the chief witness at the inquest, and as the eldest child, she had to administer his estate and wind down his building business. At 23, she was already considered a spinster and in addition to weathering the suicide scandal, she had to take on responsibility for 7 younger siblings at home (ages 4-19), one of who was my grandfather, Walter George Ingold. Sometime between 1895 and the 1901 census, the Ingold family had to give up their home on High Street and scattered. Eventually, the two youngest, Frank Ingold and Charley Ingold, were placed in the London Orphan Asylum and the others were put out to work at 14 years old. As each sibling came of age, Bertha gave them their inheritance from Henry’s estate. Assuming the estate was equally divided among the siblings, each received the equivalent of $15,000 Canadian dollars in today’s currency.\n\nBelow: A terrible photocopy of Bertha provided by the Puddifant family. I can see the long, angular face and prominent nose of an Ingold.\n\nA year after Henry’s death, Bertha appears in the 1896 London Trade Directory as a “builder”, reflecting her role in winding down her father’s business…\n\nBeginning in 1901 and by virtue of occupying a house, Bertha becomes the first female Ingold in my family to get the vote. It was only the parochial and county vote, but a milestone for the women in the family\n\nAbout Frederick James (1869-1917)\n\nSidenote: A few years ago, I corresponded with Fred and Bertha’s granddaughter. Marg Cortens described him as “a bad businessman who lost all his money”.\n\nThe red flags are in the UK census:\n\nIn 1891, Fred was running a shop in Islington, declaring himself a “master butcher” and employing 3 people. At the tender age of 21, he may not have been up to the task.\n\nTen years later Fred is no longer running his own business, but living in a Public House in Edgware and employed as a butcher at the Muddle family’s shop. This is likely around the time he met Bertha Maud Ingold.\n\nBelow: The Green Man Pub, home of Fred James in 1901\n\nFred and Bertha married in October of 1904 around the time her family responsibilities ended. She was 33 and he was 35. Given their daughter Ellen Maud was born the following March, Bertha was likely pregnant at the time of the marriage.\n\nIn 1905 Fred bought the Muddle’s shop. He seems to have had some animosity towards the family. Muddle Jr. was reportedly an alcoholic and unpleasant to be around.\n\nSidenote: my 17 year old grandfather Walter George Ingold was working as a butcher in Edgware according to the 1901 census, and I’ve often wondered if he was employed at the Muddle’s shop.\n\nFred James failed to make a go of the butcher shop. By 1908, he and Bertha and their growing family were living in Bushey, Hertfordshire where he was employed at “The White Hart”, a public house. Fred took over as landlord in 1911, but that didn’t work out either and he surrendered the license after a year.\n\nBelow: The White Hart Public House, Bushey, UK\n\nBelow: 1911 Census: Fred is listed as “Licensed Victualler” at “The White Hart. He and Bertha have 4 children at the time.\n\nWho knows what transpired in the years between 1911 up until his suicide in the summer of 1917, but Fred’s death certificate provides a clue: Once a master butcher, he ended his life as a delivery man. (“butcher’s roundsman”).\n\nBelow: “Suicide by Strangulation by Hanging”\n\nAs for the long-suffering Bertha, she sent her eldest son, 13-year old George to Canada to live and work at his aunt Edith Puddifant’s family farm in Headingly, Manitoba.\n\nBertha’s brother, Frank Ingold directed his WW1 army pay to Bertha until he was demobilized. Frank was one of the siblings she shepherded through the London Orphan Asylum. Fifteen years older, she must have seemed like a mother to Frank.\n\nThe recent release of the 1921 UK census revealed that Bertha was operating a “tea and coffee room” at 266 High Street, and her 16 year old daughter Maud was contributing to the family by working as a tailor.\n\nBelow: 266 High Street, Bushey, Watford, UK\n\nI lost track of the James family after the 1923 directory, but Marg Cortens told me a member of Fred’s family took in Bertha and her remaining children.\n\nIn the 1939 UK registry, Bertha was retired and living on Whippendale Road in Watford. Three of her children remained at home and were employed in lucrative war-time jobs.\n\nBelow: 22 Whippendale Road, Watford, UK\n\nOne final note, my late father, Frank Ingold, did a family history in 2007 and he got a lot wrong, including his belief that 4 of the Ingold sisters, including Bertha visited the Puddifant family in Canada around 1920. There is absolutely no proof of that, no travel records exist on either side of the Atlantic, and particularly in Bertha’s case is logistically impossible. It’s a reminder that family memories can be sketchy and some need to be taken with a grain of salt…\n\nBertha Maud Ingold James b. Edgware UK 1871 d. Watford UK 1953\n\nTales From The Tree\n\nMy Grandfather George Ingold and his Larceny – Debunking a Family Story\n\nWhy lie about going to prison? Who would do that? My grandfather did.\n\nAs our dad told it, George took the blame for his boss in a shady deal cheating the Canadian army of meat supplies during WW1. George allegedly spent a year in Stoney Mountain Prison, Manitoba.\n\nThat story was only partially true. I’ve learned from my family history research that you shouldn’t rely on any wild information your family gives you. Get the back up details.\n\nI found the facts about George’s arrest and court case at Newspapers.com\n\nIn 1916 George Ingold was 32 and unlike his brothers, didn’t volunteer for wartime duty and somehow avoided conscription. He was employed as a manager at one of John Enright’s two meat shops in Winnipeg.\n\nBelow: George’s entry from Henderson’s Winnipeg Directory, 1916\n\nLike many food suppliers of the day, John Enright secured a government contract to supply meat to Canadian troops in Winnipeg. In late March of 1916 and after some investigation, evidence of a conspiracy was found. Enright’s government contract was cancelled and George Ingold was arrested and charged with fraud and bribery. George may or may not have “taken the fall” for his boss.\n\nBelow: Winnipeg Tribune, May 16, 1916\n\nAt the trial in November of 1916, Sergeant Milgate, George’s co-accused turned King’s evidence and testified for the Crown.\n\nThe jury didn’t accept Milgate’s testimony and acquitted George.\n\nWhether or not George’s boss, John Enright had anything to do with this crime, we’ll never know. Enright must have been angry at the loss of a lucrative government contract. It’s also telling that in the 1918 directory George is no longer a “manager”. He’s listed as a “meat cutter”.\n\nBelow: George’s entry from Henderson’s Winnipeg Directory, 1918\n\nGeorge died before we were born, but everything we heard about him indicates he was entirely capable of this type of larceny. He was obsessed with money schemes. I believe he saw an opportunity to profit from the war and jumped at it. His boss knew it too and demoted George to meat cutter.\n\nGeorge was lucky to be acquitted. At worst, he may have spent a couple of days in jail. He paid his own surety – $100.\n\nWalter George Ingold, b.1884 Edgware, UK d.1954 Niagara Falls, CA\n\nTales From The Tree\n\nCharley Ingold’s scandalous wife: Florence Caroline Newman Selby Linley Ingold Brown (yes, that’s her name).\n\nPart One:\n\nIn April of 1937, Florence Caroline Ingold sat in the witness box at the inquest into the death of her “border”, 39 year old Reginald William Frank Jauncey. On the evening of March 24, 1937, Mr. Jauncey went out drinking and never returned. Mrs. Ingold reported him missing 3 days later and he was found in her garage at the wheel of his car, dead of carbon-monoxide poisoning.\n\nFrom The Norwood News, April 2, 1937 – BritishNewspaperArchive.com\n\nAccidental death was the verdict, but I wonder if the Court or the Police were aware that Mr. Jauncey was a former lover of Mrs. Ingold and who was 22 years his senior? Would the law have looked a little closer into Florence? I would not be surprised if she had something to do with Mr. Jauncey’s death.\n\nShe was the legal wife of my father’s uncle Charley Ingold (1890-1968) and the widow of “lyric-writer” and “comedian” Albert Linley, the father of her young daughter, Audrey. She fancied herself an “actress” and used the stage name “Florence Selby”. I could find only 2 references to her in the theatre columns of the time, but I also believe she was living with a stage actor named Arthur Selby at one point.\n\nI like to believe Charley was a “Stage Door Johnny”: on leave from Flanders in 1918, he takes in a few London theatricals and meets “actress” Florence Selby. The oddest thing about these two is that they married twice – once in 1918 and once in 1920.\n\nPhoto: Charley and Florence on the “Victorian”, headed for Canada in June of 1920..\n\nAfter the second marriage to Charley in 1920, they emigrated to Winnipeg. Charley worked as a confectioner and she at a grocery shop. I’m guessing she didn’t like working, so she left Charlie after a year and ran off to Australia with a man named Leslie Townsend. She also had an affair with Joe Higgins, who was on the same ship to Australia. After returning to England she took up with Reginald Jauncey, 22 years her junior, the same Reginald who would later die in her garage.\n\nIn 1927 Florence sued Charley for divorce on the grounds of adultery. Charley contested the divorce, producing convincing evidence of her above-mentioned lovers. The King’s Proctor refused to grant her a divorce.\n\nIn the meantime, she opened up a night club in Streatham with a much younger man, Ernest Brown. Predictably, she named it “The Florence Club”…\n\nFlorence had a knack for getting her name in the newspapers. Previous to her appearance at the inquest to Mr. Jauncey’s death, she reported the disappearance of her daughter in 1926.\n\n…and in June 1939, a Mr. Moore was charged with passing bad cheques to Florence and her “club”…\n\nShe was enumerated as living with Ernest Brown in the 1939 War Register.\n\nIn 1945, obviously giving up on ever divorcing, she put an ad in the London papers announcing she would be foregoing the surname “Ingold” and henceforth be known as “Florence Brown”.\n\nTo Be Continued…\n\nI will be writing a 2nd post on Florence delving into her years in Australia, where she got her money, her “club” and whatever happened to her daughter Audrey…\n\nFlorence Caroline Newman Selby Linley Ingold Brown 1888-1968\n\nTales From The Tree\n\nWilliam Ingold and the 21 Turkeys\n\nWilliam Ingold, b. Elsenham, Essex, 1785, d. Bishop’s Stortford, Essex, 1858\n\nMy 3rd Great-Grand Uncle, William Ingold (1785-1858) was transported from England to Australia in 1836 for taking possession of 21 stolen turkeys from a local farmer. He was one of several men involved in the crime.\n\nOne of William’s descendants on Ancestry.com describes his crime as a “desperate act of a widowed man trying to feed his 9 children”. I wondered if there were more to the story.\n\nAt BritishNewspaperArchive.com, I found a much more colourful story of William Ingold’s criminal past..\n\nHe didn’t actually steal the 21 turkeys – his accomplices did the thieving and William took possession of them with intent to sell. Trouble is, by the time he got them to market the turkeys had rotted. He was arrested and charged.\n\nWhile William may indeed have been a widower with 9 children, he was also a habitual criminal. Not only did he confess to receiving the stolen turkeys, but he showed no remorse and offered a plea deal to give up his accomplices, save for his stepson, Henry Claydon. You have to admire a man who would hang rather than implicate his stepson.\n\nFrom the Essex Standard, December 15, 1835, British Newspaper Archive:\n\n“If I am promised no punishment and not obliged to name one of them (his son), I will make a further confession, but if not I will have a rope put around my neck and be hanged afore I will impeach one of them”\n\nAt trial it was revealed William had been a member of the notorious “Elsenham Gang”, who terrorized the locals with a series of violent night time burglaries in 1817. William Ingold escaped and fled while 3 of his accomplices were hanged for the crimes.\n\nAlso, in 1825 William spent a month in jail for an “offence against game laws” (stealing).\n\nGetting back to the case of the 21 Turkeys, William pleaded to the court he should not be jailed as he had not done the stealing.\n\nIn the end, William’s plea fell on deaf ears and he was sentenced to 14 years of hard labour at Goulburn, Australia. In January of 1836 at age 51, he was placed aboard “The Bengal Merchant” with 270 other “criminals” bound for the penal colony at Goulburn, New South Wales. His stepson, Henry Claydon continued his thieving ways and was transported 2 years later\n\nBelow is a fascinating blog which gives some insight into the kind of hard prison life he experienced at Goulburn. A terrible punishment for thieving.\n\nhttps://towrangstockade.com.au/convicts/\n\nWilliam Ingold earned his pardon after 14 years and returned to England in 1854. His pardon record describes him as 5’3″ with a ruddy complexion, grey eyes and hair. He had no front teeth and was missing the forefinger of his right hand.\n\nFour years after returning to England, William died in the Workhouse at Bishop’s Stortford in January, 1858.
