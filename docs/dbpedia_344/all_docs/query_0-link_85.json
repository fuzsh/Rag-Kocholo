        "text": "Saturday night saw the AllMonster crew out in full force. First, Robert Haught took in night two of Milwaukee’s Monster Jam Freestyle Mania at the Bradley Center. Jocelyn Perrin came away with the wheelie contest victory (above), pogoing the truck into the dirt with a no-doubt win. From there, it was all Gary Porter and Grave Digger, as Porter took the wins in the Maniac Challenge and freestyle. Enjoy the teaser photos above and below, and be sure to read below for Greensboro news and Champaign teasers and a recap:\n\nGreensboro’s second night went off with a bang, and Dustin Hart checked in long enough to let us know that Charlie Pauken took Grave Digger to the wheelie contest victory, then Candace Jolly and Monster Mutt Dalmation swept through the brackets to win racing. It was Pauken’s turn to shine again in freestyle, and two slap wheelies in the tight confines were more than enough to give Pauken the victory. Photos are on the way!\n\nFinally, Josh Rhodes caught up with the Monster Nationals tour in Champaign, Illinois. Shane Smith in Ironman had a highlight moment, planting the truck vertically in the cars for several seconds in the wheelie contest before bringing it back to earth (above), good enough for the wheelie contest victory. Rick Long’s Bigfoot and Dale Gerding (Tailgator) would face off in the finals of racing, with Long taking the win. Bobby Holman took Lucas Oil Stabilizer to the freestyle victory. Enjoy the teasers below:\n\nFull galleries from all three shows and coverage from Council Bluffs and Milwaukee will be online very soon! Thanks to Josh and Dustin for a job well done this weekend, and we have more on the way!\n\nNight one from Milwaukee is in the books, and Freestyle Mania saw Gary Porter (Grave Digger) and Dave Rappach (Rap Attack) take victories, with Porter winning the Wheelie and Maniac Challenge (timed obstacle course) contests, and Rappach edging out the field with a 37 out of 40 in Freestyle and a great, fast-paced run. Hometown hero Mark Schroeder’s show recap can be found on the Devastator web site. Teasers are above, courtesy Robert Haught.\n\nIn Greensboro, it was all Charlie Pauken and Grave Digger, completing a sweep of the Wheelie, Racing, and Freestyle Competitions. Pauken just nipped Rickey Ownley’s Mopar Magic at the finish line by a tire in racing after getting a great wheelie and capped his night with a great freestyle. More to come from all of our shows this weekend; thanks for visiting!"
