        "text": "These days, it would be hard to imagine a major league baseball player holding down a second job in the offseason.\n\nBut former Detroit Tigers third baseman Richie Hebner did, and he was proud of it.\n\nHebner worked as a gravedigger at his family-owned cemetery in Massachusetts during an 18-year playing career.\n\n\"My grandfather had it first, and then my father had it, and then my brother took it over -- I dug graves for 35 years with a pick and shovel,\" said Hebner, who will visit Fifth Third Ballpark as part of the West Michigan Whitecaps Tiger Fridays series.\n\n\"I don’t know if a lot of people believed it because I was in the big leagues, but back then you didn’t make the money they are making now. You give a shovel to a guy in the big leagues now, and they will laugh at you. But I enjoyed it, and it didn’t bother me. I’m not afraid to work.\"\n\nHebner, 63, will make his first trip to West Michigan at Friday’s game, as the Whitecaps host the Kane County Cougars.\n\nThe first 1,000 people will receive Richie Hebner bobbleheads.\n\nHebner played in Detroit from 1980-82, and had a career-high 82 RBIs in only 104 games in 1980.\n\n\"I could’ve had a few more (RBIs), but I got hurt in the middle of August when I sprained ligaments in my ankle,\" Hebner said. \"That would have been a good year, but I didn’t play in many games after I got hurt.\"\n\nHebner, who compiled a career batting average of .276 and had 203 home runs and 890 RBIs in 1,908 games, spent time with five different clubs over 18 seasons.\n\nHowever, he is best known for his days in Pittsburgh when he helped the Pirates win five division titles in seven years.\n\nHebner batted .301 as a rookie in 1968, and was a starter on Pittsburgh’s 1971 world championship team.\n\n\"We had good players and good pitching (in Pittsburgh), and it was fun,\" Hebner said. \"I’ve been in 11 playoffs, and it is a whole lot easier putting on a uniform and winning in September than not, because when you are not winning, you are kind of counting the days in September.\n\n\"When you get to that many playoffs, it’s fun, and there is nothing like winning. Losing sucks.\"\n\nRICHIE HEBNER\n\nAge:\n\n63\n\nPlaying career:\n\nPittsburgh Pirates (1968-76), Philadelphia Phillies (’77-78), New York Mets (’79), Detroit Tigers (’80-82), Pirates (’82-83), Chicago Cubs (’84-85)\n\nPositions:\n\nFirst base, third base\n\nNotable:\n\nHebner was a talented hockey player for Norwood (Mass.) High School and led his team to the state finals.\n\nHebner still keeps tabs on his former team in Pittsburgh, and is enjoying the current resurrection taking place this season.\n\nThe Pirates have endured 18 consecutive losing seasons, but entered Wednesday atop the National League’s Central Division with a 51-44 record.\n\n\"I’m glad for them because they have had 18 rough years, and they have a lot of dedicated people in that town,\" Hebner said. \"And in 18 years, when you don’t play .500 ball, it sure starts getting old.\n\n\"I’ve have been to Pittsburgh twice in the last six weeks, and they are playing a whole lot better mainly because they are getting good pitching. When you get good pitching, you have a chance to win every game, and I like going back to Pittsburgh because I played there for 10 years and there is no better ballpark in baseball.\"\n\nAfter Hebner’s playing career ended after the 1985 season with the Chicago Cubs, he spent several years as a hitting coach at the major league and minor league levels. He also managed minor league teams in the Pirates, Toronto Blue Jays and Baltimore Orioles farm systems."
