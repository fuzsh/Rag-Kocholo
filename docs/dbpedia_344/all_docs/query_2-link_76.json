        "text": "The Pittsburgh Steelers have been used to burying opponents over the last 40 years but now it appears they have their very own personal “Grave Digger.”\n\nWhile it’s very early in the 2016 version of Steelers’ Training Camp, one rookie in particular has been having a very good go of it. Third round draft pick Javon Hargrave has been doing some burying of his own so far and has Steeler Nation thinking of a future of dominance in the heart of the defensive front.\n\nHargrave’s nickname may sound familiar to you and it should if you follow NFL football regularly. Former Green Bay defensive lineman Gilbert Brown, an important stalwart on the Packers’ defense was also known as the “Grave Digger.” If you think it’s wrong that Hargrave take on a nickname that someone already has then you need to take a breath. There are plenty of ‘A-Rods’ out there and hey, the Steelers already have another “Juice” too.\n\nGrave Digger seems appropriate for Hargrave who has proven he can get low with both power and speed and leave blockers in the dust. Despite not seeing a ton of time with the first unit, the players he has faced have had their hands full. In my book, I don’t care who is across from you, if you’re winning those battles then you’re doing something right.\n\nThis was part of the knock on him coming out of South Carolina State. Yes, he was dominant but was it because he was so good or was it because the competition was so much beneath him? I just don’t think it matters because you are what you are as a player and I think Hargrave is on the way to being a darn good one.\n\nAt this point, I think you’ll see him most often in passing situations where he can shoot gaps and use that speed and low center of gravity to get to the quarterback. Once Steelers’ defensive line coach John Mitchell has had more time with him then I would expect to see him used more often.\n\nGrave Digger has all of the elements – both on and off the field – that we Steelers’ fans look for and the nickname sure as hell doesn’t hurt either does it?"
