        "text": "Fans of alt-pop maverick Livingston have found refuge in the worlds he creates through his music, as heard in songs like “Fairtytale” and “Superkid.” By sharing some of the darker times that plague him and transforming them into moments of triumph, Livingston has been able to empower listeners and remind them that they do not have to go through the bad times alone. This is why he has gained over 7 million followers through projects like his debut album, A Hometown Odyssey, which has amassed over 70 million streams on Spotify alone. With recent sold-out headline tours across North America, Europe, and the UK, worlds collided as Livingston was able to meet these fans and give them a chance to escape and indulge in real time. He heads out on Part 2 of his North American tour in the fall, where he will no doubt continue to play songs from A Hometown Odyssey, as well as new singles like “Gravedigger,” released today. We had a chance to catch up with Livingston during this riveting time, where he talked “Gravedigger,” touring, and his goal for his music to be “a canvas for people’s lives.”\n\nHey, Livingston! It is nice to connect with you. How are things going for you on this warm July day?\n\nLikewise! Things are wonderful here in Texas. When I’m getting my steps in under the blazing sun, I imagine I’m a cowboy walking through the desert, and it makes me feel slightly cooler.\n\nYou have a new single (out now) called “Gravedigger.” Is this the start of a new chapter or is this related to your debut album? Or neither?\n\nThis song captures a lot of the darker emotions on A Hometown Odyssey, but also a lot of the hope. It’s a song with a lot of drama and a lot of closure. So, it feels right to start the ‘Deluxe’ of the album with a song like this.\n\nThere are a lot of layers to “Gravedigger,” from mental health to self-worth… How did this song come about for you?\n\nThis song is kind of a unique story because it was written/thought about over several years. The original idea came from one of my first sessions in LA in 2021. The concept and story never stopped following around, so I felt the pull to revisit it after I put my album out. I’m glad I did, because I don’t think it would’ve ever left me alone. Some ideas are like that. You just have to get them out.\n\nHave you always felt like a “gravedigger” or is this something that you feel more as you grow up?\n\nI feel like I look back at a series of moments that felt impossible to overcome at the time, yet I’m still here stronger than I was before. The more that pattern revealed itself, the more I realized how much it was in my head. I am my own worst enemy, and I’m the only one who can get myself out of that place. It’s both a dark and a powerful connotation at the same time, somehow.\n\nWill fans get more new music from you this year?\n\nAbsolutely, and I can’t wait to see what they think.\n\nI also want to congratulate you on the release of your debut album, A Hometown Odyssey, which dropped in March! They say you spend your whole life making your first album, so how long did this take for you?\n\nSo true. This took five years for me. “The Ending You Deserve” has vocals from when I was 16. And “Half Life” was finished just last year. So many emotions about self-discovery and moments captured in time that I am so grateful get to exist on that album. I’m so happy it’s out.\n\nThere are so many tracks on the album, and they all have millions of streams, as is the tendency for your songs (no big deal)… But what are some on there that you wish had a little more love or that you think are underrated?\n\n“Half Life” still feels slept on. That song fuses so much of the early 2010s EDM nostalgia of songs like “I Can’t Stop,” some of the old Monstercat records tapes, and has a hook I’m really proud of. It really comes to life. I feel like my fans get it.\n\nI have to ask, where did the idea for J.K. Simmons to make an album trailer come from?\n\nI always wanted a narrator on the album because of its storybook/fairytale aesthetic that started five to six years ago with “The Ending You Deserve.” I originally was going to have my high school headmaster narrate it, he had this giant deep voice. The J.K. Simmons thing was a total winding road that I’m so lucky I got to go on, and I’m forever grateful to him for being a part of this. And deeply legitimizing the debut album of a kid from the middle of nowhere.\n\nYou also recently completed your first headline North American tour and UK/EU tours. How did it feel to get out on the road and bring some of these songs to life?\n\nIt has been the greatest joy of my life. I am now followed by a motivation and daily energy deeper and more electric than I have ever felt. I am so grateful that people showed up. I can’t believe 27 shows in a row were completely sold out. The crowds were amazing, and people had the most beautiful moments and stories to share.\n\nWhat were some of your favorite cities to visit on these tours?\n\nSome highlights were Salt Lake City, Atlanta, London and Berlin. Those shows had some special energy. It felt like they were ahead in the story. Really gave me life, and I hope they enjoyed it as much as I did.\n\nYou have already achieved so much in your career, but what else do you want to check off your bucket list?\n\nI want to play stadiums one day. My goal with music is to become smaller and smaller on the stage so that the songs can become bigger and bigger. I want my music to be a canvas for people’s lives and stories, to be so much bigger than me. That would be an honor.\n\nThanks so much, Livingston. Do you have any last thoughts or comments?\n\nThanks for the great questions. I have so much I’m excited to share on the horizon.\n\nYou can listen to “Gravedigger” on platforms like Spotify, SoundCloud, and Apple Music.\n\nCatch Livingston on ‘A Hometown Odyssey Tour – Part 2’ here."
