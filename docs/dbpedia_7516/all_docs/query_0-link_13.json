        "text": "April 18, 2007: Memorials\n\nMerle Lawrence ’38 *41\n\nThe class lost a distinguished member with Merle’s death from heart failure Jan. 29, 2007. He was 91.\n\nMerle graduated from the Peddie School. He earned a bachelor’s in biology and stayed on at Princeton to earn a Ph.D. in psychology.\n\nMerle was commissioned as a naval aviator in 1942 and served in the South Pacific. He was wounded and later was awarded the Silver Star, Purple Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross, and Air Medal. As one of the first naval helicopter pilots he was instrumental in developing devices for helicopter rescue work. He also published research on human factors in engineering design. In August 1942 Merle married Bobbie Harper, sister of Brud Harper ’39.\n\nFollowing his discharge, Merle returned to Princeton as an assistant professor, conducting research on human behavior and hearing. His pioneering work on acoustics, measurements of hearing ability, and ear function led to his career at the University of Michgan Medical School. He established the Kresge Hearing Research Institute there, and served as its director until his retirement in 1983.\n\nIn retirement, Merle and Bobbie excelled in competitive swimming at a national level.\n\nMerle is survived by Bobbie, their three children, five grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren. To them, the class extends heartfelt sympathy and recognizes a remarkable career and a life well and fully lived.\n\nThe Class of 1938\n\nCraig Hugh Smyth ’38 *56\n\nCraig died of a heart attack Dec. 22, 2006, in Cresskill, N.J.\n\nHe attended Hotchkiss School and majored in classics at Princeton, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated summa cum laude. Craig worked three years as a postgraduate student at Princeton before entering the Naval Reserve in 1942. At the end of World War II, he became director of the Munich Central Collecting Point, where art and culture relics stolen by the Axis armies were collected and returned to their former owners or nations.\n\nReturning from Germany, Craig became a lecturer at the Frick Collection. In 1949 he was awarded a Fulbright research fellowship in Florence, Italy. Here he became aware of the need for art conservation, a cause that he promoted the rest of his life.\n\nCraig received his Ph.D. in art history from Princeton six years after becoming a professor at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University. In 1960, Craig became a director of the institute.\n\nHe was an honorary trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the director of the Harvard Center for Italian Renaissance Studies at Villa Tatta in Florence. Over the years he wrote many scholarly articles and books.\n\nCraig is survived by his wife, Barbara Linforth Smyth; two children; and two grandchildren. The class extends sincere condolences to the family.\n\nThe Class of 1938\n\nWilliam Rowley Bishop Jr. ’39\n\nBill died Jan. 1, 2007, in Reading (Pa.) Hospital. He was a resident of the Highlands at Wyomissing, Pa., having recently moved there from his longtime residence in Reading.\n\nAfter Princeton, Bill continued his education at the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a master’s in 1941 and was asked to stay on as an assistant in the history department. In 1948 he became professor of European and naval history at Albright College, where he served for 34 years, retiring in 1982.\n\nHe served as president for four terms on the Reading and Berks County World Affairs Council, and was a past secretary of the Reading Shade Tree Commission. He also enjoyed studying the genealogy of the old families of Worcester and Somerset counties in Maryland.\n\nBill was predeceased by his wife, Jane, in 1982 as well as by his son William III and daughter Ellen. He is survived by his son John and his daughter Sally Bishop Noll. We offer them our sincere sympathy.\n\nThe Class of 1939\n\nRobert Pease Smith ’39\n\nBob died in Clermont, Fla., Jan. 19, 2007, after a long and distinguished medical career.\n\nHe graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1943. After an accelerated internship, he joined the Army as a battalion surgeon with the 10th Armored Division. He served as a captain, and was awarded a Bronze Star for bravery in treating soldiers while under fire.\n\nAfter the war he completed internal-medicine training in Boston, where he met and married Caroline Wheelock, beginning 59 years of devoted companionship.\n\nMotivated by his experiences in the war, he returned to Massachusetts General Hospital to train as a fellow in the new specialty of physical medicine and rehabilitation. He pursued this specialty for the rest of his career, from Vermont to Kentucky to Connecticut, maintaining his private practice in addition to serving as a teacher, lecturer, and consultant to rehabilitation centers. Somehow he also found time for power-boating, tennis, and hiking.\n\nBob is survived by Caroline, their six children, and 10 grandchildren, who remember his unwavering warmth and good humor. We offer them our sincere sympathy.\n\nThe Class of 1939\n\nCarter Harman ’40 *42\n\n“Composer, Music Critic, and Record Producer Dies” was The New York Times headline that noted Carter’s death Jan. 23, 2007, in Stowe, Vt.\n\nHe prepared at Morristown School, following his relative, W.G. Kennedy ’14, among others, to Princeton. He majored in music and graduated with high honors and also took graduate music courses. Carter was music editor of the Lit, a student tutor, and a member of the choir, band, Sandwich Agency, and Dial Lodge.\n\nRobert F. Dorr’s book Chopper recounts how Carter was the first helicopter pilot in World War II to attempt a rescue behind enemy lines, extracting three Allied soldiers from a jungle in Burma. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nHe worked as a music critic for The New York Times and as music editor for Time magazine,where he wrote stories on musical giants of the time, including Duke Ellington. He spent 10 years in Puerto Rico as a critic and producer, doing sound for Peter Brook’s film of Lord of the Flies, and, as executive producer of records for CRI for 20 years. He also wrote two books, A Popular History of Music and A Skyscraper Goes Up.\n\nCarter’s wife died in 1989. His classmates wish to extend their sympathies to his daughter, Lisa Diomande; three sons, Bruce, Scott, and Alex; and three grandchildren.\n\nThe Class of 1940\n\nJOHN ABNER BELL III ’41\n\nJohn (known to us as “Pappy”) died Jan. 31, 2007, of pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nHe prepared at Shady Side Academy and The Hill School. At Princeton, he majored in geology, played freshman soccer and basketball, was a member of Sigma Xi, and graduated with honors. He joined Tiger Inn, and roomed with Don Robertson and Chuck Winston.\n\nPappy attended Harvard Business School before entering the Army in 1942, where he served in the Medical Administrative Corps. In 1945 he founded Jonabell Farm in Fayette County, Ky., where he owned and bred thoroughbred horses. He raised Never Say Die, the first American-bred horse to win the English Derby. Jonabell Farm also was the final resting place of triple-crown winner Affirmed. In 2001 he sold Jonabell Farm to Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al Hakton.\n\nPappy was past president of the Thoroughbred Club of America and of the National Association of State Racing Commissioners. In an article in Spur magazine several years ago, he was described by Alfred G. Vanderbilt as “the best man in Kentucky.”\n\nHe created the Bell Chair for Alcohol and Addictions at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine.\n\nPappy is survived by Jessica Gay Bell, his wife of 60 years; daughters Jessica Nicholson and Harriet Bennett Williams; and sons John IV and James G.\n\nThe Class of 1941\n\nLUTHER HARRY BRIDGMAN ’41\n\nLuke died Nov. 8, 2006, after a struggle with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nHe came to Princeton from Culver (Ind.) Naval School. He majored in English and was a member of Theatre Intime and Triangle Club. He joined Dial Lodge and roomed with Ted Price.\n\nLuke spent the war as a lieutenant and executive officer on destroyer-escort duty in the North Atlantic until his separation in September 1945.\n\nHe then entered the television advertising business, first with Paramount Newsreel, next with the Kudner Agency, and finally with William Esty & Co., all in New York City.\n\nIn 1955, Luke and a partner started Brown Bridgman Co. in Burlington, Vt., marketing life insurance and annuities to major corporations and the investment-banking community. This enabled Luke and his wife, Elizabeth, to enjoy skiing in the Green Mountains and sailing on Lake Champlain.\n\nLuke is survived by Elizabeth, his wife of almost 62 years; his sons, C. Torrey and Benjamin; his daughter, Sara; two grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.\n\nThe Class of 1941\n\nCHARLES BLAKEY BLACKMAR ’42\n\nCharlie died Jan. 29, 2007, in Bellair, Fla.\n\nOur youngest classmate, Charlie came to us from Southwest High School in Kansas City, Mo., majored in politics, won the John G. Buchanan Prize, and graduated summa cum laude with election to Phi Beta Kappa. He was a member of Gateway Club.\n\nDuring World War II he served as a first lieutenant in the Seventh Army, earning a Silver Star, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Michigan Law School, Charlie practiced law in Kansas City until 1966 when he became a professor of law at St. Louis University School of Law. While there he served as special assistant attorney general of Missouri and authored numerous books and articles.\n\nAppointed to the Missouri Supreme Court in 1982, Charlie reached the peak of his career when he was elected chief justice in 1989. After mandatory retirement in 1992 he devoted the rest of his life to promoting stem-cell research and abolishing the death penalty. In retirement Charlie edited The Class of 1942 During World War II.\n\nIn 1943, Charlie married Ellen Day Bonnifield. They had five children and eight grandchildren. Two years after Ellen died in 1983, Charlie married Jeanne Stephens Lee. To Jeanne and the family, the class extends deepest condolences.\n\nThe Class of 1942\n\nWILLIAM BANNARD RANKEN ’42\n\nBill, son of David B. Ranken 1904, died peacefully Jan. 8, 2007, in the house where he was born in Wilmington, Del.\n\nHe prepared at Tower Hill and the Lawrenceville School. At Princeton, Bill majored in chemical engineering and was a member of Tower Club.\n\nAfter a stint with DuPont in ordnance manufacturing during World War II, he served in the Navy as a lieutenant. Bill returned to DuPont and engaged in sales until 1964, when he joined the Equitable Life Assurance Society. His insurance career included the presidency of both the local certified life underwriters chapter and the Delaware State Life Underwriters Association. He received the Charles B. Palmer Award in 1980 in recognition of ethical and moral standards and outstanding performance in the life-insurance industry combined with dedicated contributions to the community.\n\nFor 45 years he was an active member of his church. For more than 30 years he served FISH of Northern Delaware Inc. as board member, treasurer, and driver. Bill enjoyed upland game hunting and skeet and trap contests with his family.\n\nIn 1948 Bill married Margaret Tucker Caperton, who died in 2002. To their daughter Tucker; sons David, Caperton, and William; seven nieces and nephews; and nine grandchildren, the class extends deepest sympathy.\n\nThe Class of 1942\n\nTERRILL E. PRICE JR. ’44\n\nA third-generation officer in the U.S. Cavalry, Terry died Dec. 11, 2006, in San Antonio. His brother is William G. Price ’42.\n\nTerry came to us from Phillips Exeter Academy, majored in mathematics, and was active in swimming and track. He left us in 1942, married Polly in 1943, and served eight years in the horse, mechanized, and armored cavalry, earning the Silver and Bronze stars and a Purple Heart in the Pacific campaign and surviving capture by the Japanese.\n\nDischarged as a first lieutenant, he attended the University of Pennsylvania Medical School and wrote to us that he was “the slowest student in ’44” when he got his degree in 1961. He followed with an internship in Hawaii and almost 16 years as an Air Force flight surgeon, serving also attached to the Korean Air Force and Air Rescue and Litter-\n\nbug and Flare missions. Retiring as a colonel, he worked for Phillips Petroleum in Texas and built a solar house in his spare time.\n\nPolly survives him. His extended “family” included Texas longhorns, llamas, American bison, horses, and assorted cats and dogs. We all will miss this rare man.\n\nThe Class of 1944\n\nHoward Adler ’47\n\nHowie joined us in 1943 as a premed V-12er. During World War II and the Korean conflict he served as a seagoing physician. He returned to Princeton in 1946, married Alice Richman in 1947, and graduated in 1948. He finished his medical degree at New York University and moved to Bridgewater, N.J.\n\nHe practiced radiology for 50 years in Somerset County, receiving a Golden Merit Award from New Jersey’s Medical Society. (Despite this honor Howie often would recount, with glee, how a lady once asked if his vocation was fixing radios, and would he kindly fix hers.)\n\nHe and Alice lived a “wonderful, contented life” in Bridgewater, while raising three beautiful daughters (who came to be known as “Howard’s Harem” — though Howie was no sultan). He enjoyed a lifelong passion for studying the ocean and its many treasures, an avocation nurtured by his Navy experience and seaside vacations in New Jersey and Massachusetts. He cherished Princeton and said he was a “grateful guy, lucky enough to attend such a wonderful university.”\n\nAlice died in July 2006, ending a 58-year love affair. Howie followed her soon afterward, dying Dec. 24. We send these fond recollections and our sympathy to their three daughters and their grandchildren.\n\nThe Class of 1947\n\nHOWLAND AUCHINCLOSS FOWLER ’51\n\nHowland was a gifted scientist. He majored in physics at Princeton and earned both a master’s and doctorate in physics from Brown.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1994 he was with the NBS, now the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where he specialized in low-temperature physics and applied mathematics. He was, successively, a physical scientist in the atomic physics and electricity divisions, scientific assistant to three directors, and administrator in applied mathematics. He authored or co-authored 35 papers on electron interference and scattering, ultraviolet reflectivity, superconducting voltage standards, the geometry of quasi-crystal alloys, and the growth of high-voltage breakdown streamers. In retirement he read scientific texts for Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic.\n\nHe died Sept. 3, 2006, of lymphoma in Bethesda, Md. He was 76.\n\nHowland came to us from Phillips Exeter. He was a member of Prospect Club and sang in the Glee Club and the Chapel Choir. A eulogy by Markley Roberts was read at his memorial service at the National Presbyterian Church.\n\nIn 1962 Howland married Shirley Boers. She and their two daughters, Joanna Fowler Jonsson ’85 and Amy Fowler Kinch ’91, and five grandchildren survive. Howland’s brothers, Winthrop ’37, David ’42, and Alexander ’43, predeceased him.\n\nThe Class of 1951\n\nGERALD MORTIMER MAYER JR. ’51\n\nGerry died of cancer and Parkinson’s disease July 22, 2006, in Newbury, N.H. He was 77.\n\nHe attended Eaglebrook School and Deerfield Academy prior to coming to Princeton, where he roomed with John Davis, Duke DeConingh, Bill Dwight, Clint Gilbert, Don Mathey, Neil McConnell, Ralph Peters, Don Scott, and John Michael White. Gerry was captain of the 150-pound crew and a member of the Cottage Club crew that successfully defended the Thames Challenge Cup at the 1949 Henley Regatta. He graduated cum laude from the Woodrow Wilson School.\n\nIn the course of a distinguished 32-year career with Citibank as an international banker, Gerry served as European division head and a senior credit officer. From 1978 to 1986 he was a senior fellow at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business.\n\nIn 1952 Gerry married Gordonna “Donna” Grower in Paris. Two years after her death in 1985, he married Susan Slye. He is survived by Susan; his children, Cathey Kennedy, Deborah O’Brien, Cynthia Benfield, and Gerald G. Mayer; Susan’s children, Robin McNutt, Janet Meagher, David Slye, and Paul Slye; and 20 grandchildren. “Old Nassau” was sung at his memorial service as a final salute to a beloved member of our class.\n\nThe Class of 1951\n\nRICHARD KATES PAYNTER III ’51\n\nWhen Dick died June 26, 2006, the class lost its longtime secretary. From 1966 to 2001 he wrote 700 columns for PAW and many memorials.\n\nIt would be hard to think of Dick without remembering Pat, too — it all began when she typed his thesis. They were married in June 1951.\n\nHe came from Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Va., the son of R.K. Paynter Jr. ’25. A history major, Dick roomed with Jim Rose and Henry Tifft and was a member of Colonial.\n\nDick was in advertising in New York, principally with Doremus & Co. A longtime member of Trinity Episcopal Church in Princeton, he was a docent at Drumthwacket and a Princeton Historical Society guide, and was active in the Alumni Council and the Rockingham Association.\n\nPat died in 2003, and Dick retreated more and more into a private world. His service was at Trinity, and his ’51 pin with the logo he had created for our 25th was interred with him.\n\nHe and Pat are survived by their children Jonathan, David, and Ann, and two grandchildren. His brother, Grenville ’53, predeceased him. In our hearts, there will always be a special place for Dick in our P-rade.\n\nThe Class of 1951\n\nJohn Martin Mayer ’53\n\nJohn Martin “Marty” Mayer died of bone cancer on Jan. 9, 2007, in Cleveland, Ohio. He grew up in suburban Lakewood, where he was class president and a state wrestling champion in high school.\n\nMarty wrestled for Princeton and also played football during our 24-game winning streak. A member of Cannon Club, he majored in history and roomed his senior year with Cal Perrine, Chip Sibbers, and Bob Unger.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard Business School, Marty started a construction business wiith his father in Cleveland. He married Robin Yost in 1957 and they raised three children, Jim, Megan, and Fred.\n\nMarty’s entrepreneurial interests led to ownership of a concrete-construction company and a pay-to-swim recreation area. In 1975, he bought a material-handling company and developed a bulk unloader that is still widely used in ethanol processing.\n\nMarty served for several years as the Schools Committee head for Northeast Ohio, interviewing hundreds of high school candidates for Princeton. He established a family legacy at Princeton; following him were his brother Don ’57, daughter Megan ’84, niece Maria ’88, and nephew Richard ’89.\n\nTo Marty’s wife of 49 years, Robin, their children and their seven grandchildren, the class extends its sympathy.\n\nThe Class of 1953\n\nJAMES MCKEE RIDGWAY ’53\n\nJim, who graduated from Plainfield High School, was named New Jersey all-state in basketball, and played for Coach Cappy Cappon’s 1951-1952 Eastern Intercollegiate League champions, died Dec. 9, 2006, in Newtown Square, Pa.\n\nFellow hoops member Bob Hauptfuhrer joked that he and Jim shared lots of basketball bench time because Cappon usually used only five men.\n\nAt Princeton, Jim belonged to Tiger Inn, the Republican Club, and Orange Key. After graduating with honors in economics, he was in the Army’s Central Intelligence Corps and received the Korean Service Medal. He spent his business career as a financial-services specialist in the Philadelphia area with Smith Barney, Tucker Anthony, and Superior Investments Group, from which he retired as a top executive. He contributed to many charitable and community organizations and was a leader in his church.\n\nHigh school and college comrade Peter Enander remembers Jim as “the rare good listener, interesting to be with, and genuinely caring about others, with a fine sense of humor and able to laugh at himself.”\n\nBesides Louisa, his wife of 26 years, he is survived by son James M. Jr., daughter Rebecca Ayars ’83, brother Richard C., stepsons David S. Robb and Stephen C. Robb, and eight grandchildren. Jim had a giving heart filled with wit and an understanding mind.\n\nThe Class of 1953\n\nRonald E. Parker ’54\n\nRonald Parker died Jan. 14, 2007, at home and surrounded by his family.\n\nA graduate of Phillips Andover Academy, Ron majored in chemistry, was a member of Quadrangle Club, and was active in a variety of sports. He subsequently graduated from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and practiced obstetrics and gynecology at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Mass., for many years. He was an early advocate of natural childbirth in a safe medical environment in Massachusetts.\n\nIn addition to his wife of 50 years, Jane, he is survived by his four children, Janet, Lynne, John, and Leslie; and eight grandchildren. The class extends its sympathy to his family.\n\nMemorials may be addressed to Brightest Horizon Child Development Center, 10320 Gladiolus Drive, Fort Myers, FL 33908.\n\nThe Class of 1954\n\nNicholas R. Flagler ’58\n\nNick Flagler of Oxford, Md., died Sept. 19, 2006, exactly two months after his 70th birthday.\n\nNick’s life held three passions: family, medicine, and sailing. He grew up in Stroudsburg, Pa., and spent summers sailing on Barnegat Bay in New Jersey. In 1952, Nick entered Exeter, where he acquired his enduring nickname, The Blade. At Princeton, he majored in biology, played freshman lacrosse, and joined Ivy Club.\n\nNick received a medical degree from Temple University’s School of Medicine and embarked on a nine-year career as a Navy doctor. Leaving the service in 1971, he co-founded an obstetrics and gynecology practice in Easton, Md., remaining there until his retirement in 2000. It is estimated that Nick delivered more than 3,000 babies, including children of women he had delivered as babies.\n\nIn addition to countless hours on Chesapeake waters, Nick sailed the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and the Caribbean. He also was involved in many civic activities.\n\nNick is survived by the love of his life, Diane, whom he married in 1971; a daughter, Alice; two sons, Nicholas Jr. and Daniel; a stepson, Robert; nine grandchildren; a great-grandson; and a brother, Philip. The class extends sympathy to his family.\n\nWe will all miss Nick convulsing with laughter just before reaching the punch lines of his own jokes.\n\nThe Class of 1958\n\nFREDERIC M. QUITKIN ’58\n\nFred Quitkin died Oct. 9, 2005, of pancreatic cancer.\n\nFred came to Princeton from Samuel V. Tilden High School in New York, where he played football and baseball, and was president of his senior class. At Princeton he majored in biology, played freshman baseball, and was a member of the Pre-Med Society.\n\nUpon graduation Fred attended and received his medical degree from SUNY Downstate Medical Center. Later he received a D.M.Sc. and became a diplomate of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. He dedicated his career to understanding and relieving mental illness, publishing more than 200 peer-reviewed journal articles.\n\nFred was the founding director of the Depression Evaluation Service and became a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia’s College of Physicians and Surgeons. Fred developed the concept of an atypical depression that is quite chronic, where people overeat and oversleep and respond very specifically to a group of medications that aren’t used that much. In addition to his work on atypical depression and schizophrenia, Fred conducted research on other psychiatric disorders, including those associated with drug and alcohol dependence.\n\nTo his son, Matt, and daughters Megan and Rachel, the class sends deepest sympathy.\n\nThe Class of 1958\n\nWalter George Schroeder ’61\n\nWalt died Dec. 10, 2006, in Tampa, Fla., where he had lived since 1973. He battled diabetes for many years, but we do not know the specific cause of his death.\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Walt came to Princeton from John Marshall High School as a National Merit Scholar. At Princeton he majored in history, was a member of Quad, Orange Key, and the Lutheran Student Fellowship, andwas elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He roomed with Ben Bassett, Sid Friedman, Tack Kuntz, Dave Hulett, and Jim Raybin.\n\nAfter a Defense Department internship in Washington, he attended UC-Berkeley to pursue a Ph.D. in history. He taught at both Berkeley and Stanford, and then at Berkeley Preparatory School. We know little else about his life after 1981. Tack Kuntz was in very occasional touch and reports that Walt was involved in state and local politics in Florida and was a devotee of classical music, philosophy, and opera.\n\nWalt was married shortly after college and subsequently divorced. His obituary lists only his many siblings as his survivors. We join them in their sorrow and regret that we had not seen more of Walt over the years.\n\nThe Class of 1961\n\nSydney Jaffe ’79\n\nNeurologist and avid cyclist Sydney Jaffe died Sept. 30, 2004, following a bicycle accident on her way to work at Yuma (Ariz.) Regional Medical Center. She was 47.\n\nAlways a soft-spoken person, Syd changed at Princeton from a shy freshman into a “small but mighty” Commons captain whose dry wit was in evidence when she would point out that someone on her shift had “missed a spot — again.”\n\nIn addition to working at Commons, Syd was a resident adviser, a member of Hillel and the Center for Jewish Life, and a participant in Outdoor Action. Her roommates included Vivian Pyle, Robin Eisman, and Susan Cayer.\n\nAfter graduation, Syd enrolled at Texas A&M University College of Medicine and earned her medical degree in 1984. She did an internal-medicine residency in Roanoke, Va., a neurology residency at Wake Forest University, and an EMG/EEG fellowship in Morgantown, W. Va.\n\nAfter her death, tributes to Syd came from medical-school classmates and patients’ families. One family cited Syd’s skill, caring, and compassion, and their luck in having her in their lives at a critical time.\n\nSyd is survived by her mother, Audrey Jaffe; her sister, Deborah Jaffe; and her grandmother, Rose Lipman. The class extends belated but heartfelt sympathy to them all.\n\nThe Class of 1979\n\nBurton C. Hallowell *49\n\nBurton C. Hallowell, economist and ninth president of Tufts University, died Nov. 21, 2006. He was 91.\n\nAs president of Tufts from 1967 to 1976, he led the university during the difficult Vietnam War era. Applying his financial-planning skills, he replaced budget deficits with surpluses, unified the schools and colleges within the university, eliminated many restrictions on women, and increased the minority population on campus.\n\nBy 1976, the advances allowed Hallowell to resign and implement his belief that a college president should remain for no more than 10 years. He turned his efforts to U.S. corporate governance, and became chairman of the Keystone Custodian Funds and a director of seven corporations.\n\nPrior to working at Tufts, Hallowell worked at Wesleyan University, where he was a professor and chair of the economics department, and later executive vice president. Hallowell earned his bachelor’s and master’s at Wesleyan and a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton.\n\nHis first wife, Pauline, died in 1998. He is survived by his second wife, Joyce, whom he married in 2002; a son; two stepchildren; and three step-grandchildren.\n\nJerome P. Levine *62\n\nJerome P. Levine, professor of mathematics at Brandeis University and a prominent theorist in topology, died April 8, 2006, of lymphatic cancer. He was 68.\n\nAfter earning a bachelor's from MIT in 1958, Levine earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton in 1962, under Professor Norman Steenrod. He then taught at MIT and began to enhance the subject of topology, especially knot theory. His early work in this field produced significant applications of the new tool of surgery theory, which then dominated geometric topology in the 1960s and 1970s. More recently, his contributions were important to the algebraic and geometric topology of low-dimensional knots and links.\n\nAfter MIT, Levine moved to the University of California, Berkeley, and then spent a year at Cambridge University as a postdoctoral fellow before joining Brandeis University in 1966, rising to full professor in 1969.\n\nLevine was known among his colleagues for his support of younger mathematicians, his kindness, and his generosity.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Sandy, three children, and five grandchildren.\n\nThis issue has undergraduate memorials for Merle Lawrence ’38 *41, Craig Hugh Smyth ’38 *56, and Carter Harman ’40 *42."
