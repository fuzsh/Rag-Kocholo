        "text": "Thanks to our members’ generous support Greenpeace was able to protect our Earth sanctuary in many vital ways throughout 2018. The year was packed with hard-fought battles—and victories!—for our environment, our communities, and our rights.\n\nIn huge wins for free speech and advocacy, courts sided with us, dismissing baseless claims in lawsuits filed against Greenpeace and others by corporations attempting to silence dissent. And we also won in our lawsuit to stop huge logging projects in Alaska’s old-growth forests.\n\nPeople power protected water and stopped pipelines, defended the Amazon Reef, and made the fourth largest Exclusive Economic Zone on the planet off limits for new fossil fuel exploitation. Taking collective action together we convinced more corporations to go to 100% renewable energy, phase out single-use plastics trashing the planet, and eliminate rainforest destroyers from the palm oil supply chain.\n\nThe credit lies with the thousands of people who made it happen … climate champions, forest defenders, ocean lovers, activists, resisters, rainbow warriors, and passionate Greenpeace volunteers and members.\n\nThank you for doing your part in solidarity with Greenpeace to protect our Earth sanctuary.\n\nGreenpeace Fund is consistently ranked among the nation’s top charities—for our achievements and for the high percentage of revenue that goes directly towards the protection of the planet.\n\nGreenpeace Fund is recognized by Charity Navigator with a four-star rating as having demonstrated financial efficiency and excellent accountability and transparency.\n\nGreenpeace Fund is proud to be a part of the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) and to carry the “Best in America” seal from Independent Charities of America. Of the one million charities operating in the United States today, it is estimated that fewer than 5% meet or exceed these standards and fewer than 2,000 charities have been awarded this seal.\n\nI find it humbling to be in a position of leadership within the organization at this time of truly existential crisis for our world in the face of unbridled climate change. I don’t know what the future holds for us any more than anyone else does. But I do know that I could not live with myself if I didn’t do everything in my power to try to steer that future in a better, more sustainable direction.\n\nI am fighting for a world that is socially just, environmentally sustainable, where people are spiritually connected, and there is a deep and wide shared prosperity for all people, ecosystems, and animals. Being part of this band of brave Greenpeace warriors keeps me firmly grounded in the change we so desperately need.\n\n– Jakada Imani\n\nGreenpeace, Inc. Board Chair\n\nTo me, a green and peaceful future involves all the things we long for and fight for—an end to conflict and war, an end to poverty and suffering, an ending to racism, sexism, and inequality of any sort, and a new age of justice, of respect for all living things, and of deep renewal of the lives and spirits of every one of us and every part of the planet.\n\nI am deeply honored to support the incredible work of Greenpeace’s activists in the U.S. and around the globe. I am inspired by the smart, creative people on the staff of Greenpeace USA and as humbled as I am by the task we have before us, I have no doubt we will win.\n\n– Liz Gilchrist\n\nGreenpeace Fund Board Chair\n\nIn a huge win for people power and the climate, after seven years of Greenpeace’s sustained campaigning alongside Indigenous Māori groups and the wider community, the New Zealand Government passed a law banning new offshore oil and gas exploration. The law means that around four million square kilometers of Earth’s surface are now off limits to oil and gas companies, and any deposits under the deep seas will stay in the ground where they belong.\n\nThousands of people taking action year after year changed history and gave hope to the world as the tide turned irreversibly against the fossil fuel industry. This is how we win—together.\n\nAfter a decade-long legal battle to protect Alaska’s Tongass National Forest, Greenpeace prevailed when a federal court invalidated four U.S. Forest Service logging projects. Together the four projects would have required building 14 miles of logging roads to clear-cut 33 million board feet of timber from 1,700 acres of old-growth forest.\n\nAt 17 million acres, the Tongass National Forest is the Earth’s largest remaining temperate rainforest. The four timber sales would have destroyed habitat vital to deer, Alaska’s Alexander Archipelago wolf, and subsistence hunters. The lawsuit focused on all three, and the court’s ruling protects many kinds of wildlife in those areas and diverse forest uses. It’s also a victory for the climate, as the Tongass is world-renowned for storing carbon in its soil, trees, and vegetation.\n\nFollowing an intensive global campaign by Greenpeace, Wilmar International, the world’s largest palm oil trader, published a detailed action plan to map and monitor all of its suppliers. If implemented, this would put the palm oil giant that supplies 40% of the world’s palm oil one step closer to finally eliminating deforestation from its supply chain.\n\nWilmar’s new action plan commits the palm oil trader to map its suppliers’ entire landbank by the end of 2019, including concessions from which it does not yet source, and to use high-resolution satellite monitoring to check for deforestation. Companies caught clearing rainforest are to be immediately suspended.\n\nWilmar’s move puts pressure on the rest of the industry, and other traders and brands must now follow with credible plans to map and monitor all of their suppliers to stop the destruction of rainforests.\n\nDuring an intensive “reef hunt” in the rough seas off French Guiana, the crew and the scientists onboard the Esperanza found the same coral reef structures as those of the Brazilian Amazon Reef. It was a beautiful discovery for science, biodiversity, and the environmental heritage of French Guiana.\n\nFinding these formations was an important achievement and exciting for all the scientists involved, to think of the possibilities for developing new research. More studies are needed—nature still has a lot of surprises in store for us.\n\nThe expedition also revealed a crucial piece of information: it proved the existence of a reef formation inside the area where the French oil company Total wanted to drill, off the coast of Brazil. After nearly two years of campaigning, two million Amazon Reef Defenders made history together when the Brazilian environmental agency denied Total the license to drill for oil.\n\nA majority of the European Union’s national governments voted to ban all open-field uses of three neonicotinoids—a particularly nasty class of insecticides. The win was the result of a Greenpeace “Save the Bees” campaign launched five years ago along with the work of allies highlighting the decline in bees and the link to the toxic chemicals used by the farming industry.\n\nWith this latest victory, the tide has turned against the chemical companies and the big agribusiness lobbies—and in favor of bees.\n\nResearch indicates that several other insecticides are a threat to bees and other beneficial insects, however. Failure to address the wider chemical burden on bees could mean that farmers simply replace banned chemicals with other permitted chemicals that may be just as harmful. Greenpeace is calling on governments to ban all beeharming pesticides and shift away from toxic chemicals in farming.\n\nAfter a year of Greenpeace campaigning and global protests, Samsung Electronics committed to 100% renewable energy in the United States, Europe, and China by 2020. As the world’s largest smartphone and computer chip manufacturer, Samsung’s commitment represents a big step forward in reducing the impact that our technology is having on the planet.\n\nIf the company follows through with meaningful actions, Samsung will join Apple, Facebook, Google, and other IT business leaders who recognize the sense of urgency around climate change and are working to move their operations off of fossil fuels as fast as possible. Greenpeace and the thousands who took action with us will be watching Samsung carefully to ensure it follows through on its commitments.\n\nA federal court dismissed the majority of claims, including all under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), in the case brought by Resolute Forest Products against Greenpeace defendants and others. Resolute’s intent is to bully advocacy organizations and forest defenders with baseless legal claims. The judge’s decision to throw out the racketeering claims, designed to prosecute mobsters, is a positive development and a win for free speech and advocacy.\n\nAll claims against Greenpeace defendants and others in the baseless $900 million lawsuit filed by Energy Transfer (the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline) were rejected by a federal court judge, sending a clear message to companies trying to muzzle civil society that corporate overreach will not be tolerated. It was a huge victory not just for Greenpeace but for anyone and everyone who has ever stood up against powerful corporate interests. After the federal court’s dismissal, Energy Transfer repackaged its meritless claims in a North Dakota state court lawsuit against the Greenpeace defendants and others. The fight for free speech and advocacy continues, but we are confident that the state court will dismiss all claims and send a final message to corporations like Energy Transfer that these abusive legal tactics will not be tolerated.\n\nProtect Water, Stop Pipelines\n\nThe Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise began the ship tour by documenting what is at stake in the Pacific Northwest, from the Trans Mountain pipeline to the tar sands tanker superhighway that would threaten the extinction of the Southern Resident Orca Whale.\n\nBreak Free From Plastic\n\nIn San Diego and Long Beach Greenpeace drew attention to the epidemic of plastic pollution with beach cleanups and brand audits, and we conducted microplastics surveys. The Arctic Sunrise also visited the Great Pacific Garbage Patch to show what “away” looks like with throwaway plastics. In Honolulu Greenpeace worked with local groups to put together a Pau Hana (a Hawai‘ian term meaning “work is done”) informal event to discuss plastics bans with legislators. The Hawai‘i Senate presented Greenpeace with a plaque commending us and the crew of the Arctic Sunrise for raising awareness and spurring solutions to the devastation of plastic pollution.\n\nGreenpeace’s annual Backstage gala at our West Coast Action Center in Oakland, California provided our guests with an up close and personal behind-the-scenes experience, at the place where our iconic actions to save the planet begin. The evening included demonstrations of the techniques and equipment that are signature to our work, and the chance to learn more about the unique aspects of Greenpeace that make us so effective on a global scale. Rousing guest speakers inspired the crowd, and attendees had the opportunity to bid on one-of-a-kind silent auction items like a ride in the Greenpeace airship or hot air balloon, or an excursion in one of our rigid inflatable boats. It was a wonderful evening with a diverse group of people who share our strong commitment to a green and peaceful future.\n\nMarc Levin\n\n“I have been following Greenpeace since I was in high school. I was inspired by the volunteers on the Rainbow Warrior who seemed so brave, committed, and fearless. I continue to be inspired by the substantial successes of Greenpeace and am proud to be a major supporter of the organization.”\n\n– Marc Levin\n\nA Greenpeace member for nearly 20 years, Marc has graciously included a gift to Greenpeace Fund in his will, ensuring his values live on forever.\n\nIf you would like to know more about how you can remember Greenpeace in your estate plans, please contact Corrine Barr at 1-800-328-0678 or [email protected].\n\nThis annual report highlights the work, the wins, and the ongoing resistance that the Greenpeace community makes possible. The fight goes on—and your active support is invaluable.\n\nGreenpeace is a powerful global community with unique resources, and our oceans, forests, and animals facing extinction need our protection. Last year many of you joined us on the West Coast as the Arctic Sunrise amplified the cry against new fossil fuel infrastructure and the single-use plastics that are choking our seas. As you read this, the Greenpeace ship Esperanza is sailing from the Arctic to Antarctica in our quest to protect 30% of the high seas as sanctuaries to help build ocean resilience. And Greenpeace is also intensifying our efforts to ensure that the climate crisis is not ignored as the 2020 primary gears up.\n\nThank you for helping make all of this possible, and for making our movement even stronger by encouraging others to join you as members of the Greenpeace community.\n\nWe are seeing greater than ever threats to our environment and we feel as though this is the time that we need to spend additional resources, especially from the donations given in 2017 when we saw an incredible outpouring of support from donors like you wanting to counter the current threats. In 2018, we saw the effects of the mid-term elections and the timing of some gifts in our fundraising. The year-end downturn in investment markets also impacted our revenue. However, we remain dedicated to fighting the good fight for the long-term, recognizing that this is a key moment in both our nation’s and the planet’s future.\n\nIn the United States, Greenpeace fulfills its role in protecting the environment through two corporate entities: Greenpeace, Inc., a nonprofit organization formed under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, and Greenpeace Fund, Inc., a nonprofit organization formed under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nGreenpeace, Inc. furthers its mission of protecting the environment through research, advocacy, litigation, and lobbying (direct and grassroots). The organization also bears witness to environmental degradation and takes action to prevent it. Contributions to Greenpeace, Inc. are not tax-deductible.\n\nThe mission of Greenpeace Fund, Inc. is to promote and protect the environment through research and public education. Greenpeace Fund, Inc. also makes grants to other nonprofit organizations for activities that are consistent with its mission. Contributions to Greenpeace Fund, Inc. are tax-deductible."
