Imageon Solutions closed its first round of major financing last month, which should further the companys efforts to develop Internet-based clinical image management networks. Emerging Technology Partners of Birmingham, AL, led the round, which concluded Jan. 10 and included Paradigm Venture Partners, Finn Partners, and other private investors.

Imageon, also of Birmingham, plans to use the funds to expand its sales and marketing structure and to seek alliances with OEMs and HIS/RIS vendors. The amount raised was not disclosed.

Also last month, the company named Charles Jett to the post of chairman and CEO, and Jeff Timbrook to the position of vice president of sales and marketing. Jett joined Imageon from Walker Interactive Systems, where he served as vice president and general manager of the companys Immpower division. Timbrook comes to his post with 15 years of healthcare information technology sales and marketing experience, and has served as vice president of sales and marketing for StorCOMM.
