        "text": "1900 Series History\n\nFP6000\n\nAround 1963 Ferranti were looking for a system below the speed of Orion and Atlas to replace Pegasus, Mercury and Sirius. Their Canadian subsidiary, Ferranti Packard had recently visited the UK, and based on their knowledge of the Ferranti they designed the FP6000. The first FP6000 was installed and running at the US Federal Reserve Bank in New York in March 1963.\n\nA joint ICT/Ferranti team visited Toronto in March 1963. The interest was in both the machine architecture and how they had produced it in such a short timescale. The party reported back that it would be quicker to build the FP6000 than design an alternative. A later visit by Arthur Humphreys of ICT and colleagues were equally impressed and saw it as a definite competitor to the RCS systems (an IBM copy) that was being looked at by ICT.\n\nAn ICT Computer Range\n\nAbout this time, it was beginning to be realised that producing a range of incompatible systems was both labour intensive and expensive. Having a system that could cover a range of different sizes and speeds would have distinct advantages. IBM announced the System/360 series and others need to compete. The only way to do that in the short term was to base a series on hardware that was already in production. ICT selected the FP6000 as the basis of their range and this speeded up the ICT/Ferranti merger.\n\nThe 1900 Series was announced in September 1964, only six months after IBM launched System/360 and some 1900 models were delivered earlier than their IBM equivalents. The FP6000 was based on logic cards developed in Ferranti Wythenshawe for Orion 2. Some major changes had to be made to the architecture to turn it into a range. The order code had to be altered to allow the memory size to be greater than 128K 6-bit characters.\n\nAtlas was demonstrating the advantages of a rich operating system and this resulted in the development of GEORGE III. The FP6000 became the ICT 1904 and with floating point as the 1905. More powerful machines - the 1906/1907 - were planned and included in the initial announcement. Faster machines pushed the technology and the architecture. Smaller machines needed to be made cheaper. Charlie Portman of ICT was instrumental in showing that cost effective smaller systems could be built and eventually it was possible to go down to the 1901.\n\nLong timescales in IBM's delivery of System/360 and the cheaper cost of ICT's 6-bit systems gave ICT a price advantage that allowed them to sell well in Europe and outside the USA. Long-term, 6-bit characters and 48-bit words became a distinct disadvantage and there was always going to be a need to introduce a new range in the not too distant future. The 2900 series was finally launched in 1974.\n\nFor information on the ICL 1900 Series see: http://www.icl1900.co.uk/\n\nIn the beginning was the FP6000 which was made by Ferranti-Packard in a distant land And there were in another country at that time divers International Computers and Tabulators and though they did tabulate as their fathers before them yet they could not compute And they said unto one another let us go even unto West Gorton to see this marvel that has come to pass and they beheld the FP6000 and saw that it was good And they said let us offer many shekels that the FP6000 may be ours and Ferranti did say lo here are men who will pay for what loseth us much money praise be Then the International Computers and Tabulators did take the FP6000 clothed it in panels of blue and did call it the 1905 thus was accomplished the birth of the 1900 series And on the next day they created the 1904 which was the image of the 1905 but lacked a floating point unit next did they fashion the 1902 which was slower and the 1903 which was the same but with a floating point unit Finally they did fashion the 1907 a mighty engine for the crunching of numbers and the 1906 that lacked a floating point unit and the unbelievers asked who shall purchase a scientific computer that hath no floating point unit and none could answer Yet another time they salesman said behold the great multitude that clamour crying out lo we have mighty programs yet the 1905 hath not sufficient core to hold them so there was created the 1905E which much store and the 1905F that some did buy believing the F to signify fast though none did know for a certainty and they did yoke together two 1905s like unto a pair of oxen to make the 1907F and no man could comprehend the reason therefor Then the salesman said verily we have so many machines that we know not what we sell neither do the customers know what they buy and the engineers said a new technology hath been revealed to us in platters of many layers let us make a new series called the a series and let there be the 1901A 1902A 1903A AND 1904A and the company saw that it was good And the devil taketh the company to a high place and showeth them the IBM 195 and the CDC6600 and they said let us fashion a mighty machine like unto the walls of jericho and call it the 1906A and let there be set up a graven image called George 3 that the heathen may worship and it was accomplished Now the time was come when there should be fulfilled the prophecy that was written in that time they shall travail and bring forth a New Range And it came to pass that although the time was long passed that the new range should be delivered yet it did not appear and there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth in the land And there arose instead a false prophet who did privily sell semiconductor stores wherewith were made the 1903s and the 1904s that the people might forget the new range in wonder at a store so fast that the processor could not keep pace with it And there came forth in succession the 1903T and the 1901T and the heathen were confused knowing not which machine was which In that season they did call together a monstrous gathering of the press and there appeared a spokesman of the company saying Behold I bring you tidings of great joy for unto you is available the 2970 and if peradventure you are willing to wait the 2980 and there is System B that controlleth both their going out and their coming in But certain unbelievers gathered together privily and murmured among themselves saying truly the mills of System B grind fine but they grind exceeding slow And the spokesman replied O Ye of Little Faith Is it not written in your contract that all shall be accomplished even unto the fourth benchmark and the unbelievers answered how can these things be\n\nGeorge 3: Computer Weekly May 3 1979\n\nOVER 130 George 3 alumni were rounded up at ICL's Beaumont training centre last Friday: April 27, by that still virile organisation, the George 3 Beer Committee.\n\nThe occasion was the tenth anniversary of the announcement of George 3 on April Fools Day 1969 and, as one wag commented, being only 26 days late after ten years was not bad going.\n\nThat reference to lateness struck a nightmarish chord among those who had been involved in the early releases of George 3 when changes and delays were happening so rapidly that the user notices to update newly published manuals were often larger than the manuals themselves.\n\nYet when George 3 began to reach maturity at the age of about Mark 5 and the teething problems receded into the warmth of childhood memories, the operating system began to achieve first respect and then love among its users.\n\nThat love has become embarrassing for ICL because, as reflected by the comments of the chairman of the ICL Computer Users Association at last month's user convention, users are asking why the 2900 operating systems have not yet lived up to the standards set by George.\n\nThis favourable user response to George is the true vindication of the work which grew in the mid-60s from the nucleus design team of Jeff Strauss, Dan Oestreicher, Brian Moore and Mick Bailey to encompass around 500 development staff and untold person hours of work. Many users would now proudly wear the vintage badge produced some years ago by ICL sales promotion, which stated GEORGE 3 FOR ME.\n\nMingling among the merry at Beaumont, Strauss recalled how George was named. Seven design options were being considered, identified by the letters A to G. The seventh option was chosen and the G turned to George and was then linked to the manager of the division responsible for its development, George Felton. Finally came the expansion of the name to GEneral ORGanisational Environment so that an answer could be given to the question \"What does George mean?\"\n\nThe loyalty to George 3 by its former staff was indicated by the large turn-out at Beaumont. Beer Committee chairman Roy Walker said he had managed to draw up a list of over 300 staff who had been on George 3 development."
