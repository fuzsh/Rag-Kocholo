        "text": "The purpose of this project is to enhance freight mobility and address congestion along the I-45 corridor. There are two proposed segments within the Central Walker County Project that were studied by TxDOT. Segment 2A is a proposed 4.4 mile long project in the city limits of Huntsville from 0.3 miles north of SH 19 to 0.9 miles north of SH 30. Segment 2B is a proposed 4.7 mile long project in the city limits of Huntsville from SH 30 to 0.7 miles south of FM 1696.\n\nBackground\n\nThe existing I-45 facility consists of a four-lane divided controlled access freeway. There are two travel lanes in each direction, bounded by 10 foot outside and six foot inside shoulders. South of FM 1791, two-lane one-way frontage roads are positioned outside of the main lanes. North of FM 1791, two-lane two-way frontage roads are positioned outside of the main lanes.\n\nThe freeway within the project limits was constructed in the early 1960s.\n\nPassenger and truck traffic has greatly increased during the last 60 years.\n\nI-45 serves as the primary hurricane and disaster evacuation route for metro Houston and Galveston.\n\nSegment 2A\n\nSegment 2A is a proposed 4.4 mile long project in the city limits of Huntsville from 0.3 miles north of SH 19 to 0.9 miles north of SH 30. It would widen I-45 from four to six lanes and would include reconstruction and realignment of the main lanes and ramps; improving drainage structures and bridges; and improvements to frontage roads, crossroads adjacent to new ramps, and interchanges. The project also includes adding collector-distributor roads, which is a road that parallels and connects the main travel lanes and frontage roads.\n\nThe proposed Segment 2A project would require additional right of way of approximately 11.5 acres and would displace four commercial structures. This project began in October 2021 with a project cost of $210 million.\n\nSegment 2B\n\nSegment 2B is a proposed 4.7 mile long project within the city limits of Huntsville with a usual right of way of 400 feet. It would widen I-45 from four to six lanes and would include reconstruction and realignment of freeway main lanes and ramps. The project would create two new interchanges. The first would be for westbound SH 75 near San Jacinto Street (west of I-45) and Moffett Springs Road (east of I-45). The second would be north of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Headquarters. In addition, the project would improve drainage structures, bridges, frontage roads, and crossroads adjacent to new ramps and interchanges. A raised median along SH 75, from Brookview Drive to FM 2821, would be constructed to reduce vehicle turning conflicts.\n\nThis project has an estimated letting of Summer 2026 and construction to begin in Fall 2026.\n\nGet involved\n\nVirtual Public Hearing with In-Person Option - IH 45 Central Walker County Widening Project Segment 2B - Jan. 13, 2022\n\nPublic Hearing and Open House â€“ August 9, 2018\n\nOpen House - Nov. 29, 2016\n\nDownloads\n\nSegment 2A"
