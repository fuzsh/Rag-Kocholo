Specifically, humor and creativity both involve making non-obvious connections between seemingly unrelated things. It was found that improvisational comedians produced more creative ideas than professional designers in controlled, time-limited idea generation challenges, and that engineers can generate significantly more ideas after improvisational training. Researchers have also found that a playful attitude is helpful in creative problem solving and ideation. It seems obvious to promote play for children, but we tend to discourage it in adults. If we want to be creative leaders, we should encourage play and humor in our work environments.\n\nBio: Barry Kudrowitz, PhD, is a professor of product design and department head in the College of Design at the University of Minnesota, USA. There, he founded and directed the product design program from 2011–2021. Kudrowitz received his PhD from the Mechanical Engineering Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), studying humor, creativity, and idea generation. Kudrowitz is interested in how creativity is perceived, evaluated, and learned. He has years of experience working with the toy industry and has taught toy design for over a decade. Kudrowitz co-designed a Nerf toy, an elevator simulator that was in operation at the International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C., and a ketchup-dispensing robot that was featured on the Martha Stewart Show. He is the author of Sparking Creativity: How Play and Humor Fuel Innovation.\n\nCultural Aspects of Accessibility and Assistive Technology\n\nLaleh Nourian\n\nOctober 23rd, 2023\n\n3:00pm\n\nLocation: ITE 430 OR virtually at: https://meet.google.com/iee-bkqt-rvj\n\nDescription: Previous research has delved into the influence of cultural differences on various aspects of digital design (e.g., design methods, visual design preferences). However, it is unclear how cultural differences might affect the process of “accessible design”. My research focuses on the intersection of culture and digital accessibility and within this realm, I investigate the presence of potential conflicts between designers’ cultural design preferences and the established accessibility guidelines. The objectives of my research include raising awareness (e.g., through education), devising strategies/recommendations to address designers’ needs, and to provide more support for them in the process of accessible design.\n\nBio: Laleh Nourian, is a PhD student in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at Rochester Institute of Technology.\n\nDesigning for Social Justice in Science Teaching and Learning: Working towards Rightful Presence\n\nDr. Angela Calabrese Barton\n\nNovember 21st, 2022\n\n3:00pm\n\nLocation: ITE 430 OR virtually at: https://meet.google.com/iee-bkqt-rvj\n\nCurrent discourses of equity in teaching and learning are framed around calls for inclusion, grounded in the extension of a set of static rights for high-quality learning opportunities for all students. In this seminar we provide an overview of Rightful Presence, a guiding framework for social justice science teaching, developed on-the-ground with partner teachers in Research Practice Partnerships. This framework highlights the limitations of equity as inclusion, which does not adequately address the ways in which systemic injustices manifest in local classroom practice. Rightful presence centers youth having legitimate membership in their science learning community because of who they are and not who they should be. Rightful presence draws on the ingenuity, knowledge and practice youth bring to learning and doing science. Rightful presence orients the field towards new forms of teaching that restructure learning opportunities such that the lives of all youth are made visible and integral to science, especially those lives made invisible in STEM through a history of systemic racism and heteropatriarchy. Three tenets for guiding the use of this framework in teaching and learning are offered. Case studies from partner teacher classrooms across settings will be used to illuminate key points.\n\nBio: Angela Calabrese Barton is a professor in the Educational Studies Department at the University of Michigan. Her research is grounded in the intersections of teaching and learning science with an emphasis on equity and social justice.\n\nDesign as Democratic Inquiry\n\nDr. Carl DiSalvo\n\nNovember 3rd, 2022\n\n12:00pm\n\nLocation: TBD\n\nIn this talk, I’ll share my new book, Design as Democratic Inquiry. This book discusses a series of projects grounded in collaborations with communities and institutions. In these collaborations, I explore the potentials and limitations of design to participate in democracy through what I call design experiments in civics. In particular, I explore how, as engaged designers, we might contribute to the work of communities and institutions who explore alternative civic imaginaries, which keep our democracies vibrant. This requires rethinking the stories we tell about design, how we practice design, and how we theorize design. Rather than repeating the heroic tales of innovation, I argue for embracing design as fragile, contingent, partial, and compromised: designing becomes a way to care for our collective futures together.\n\nBio: Carl DiSalvo (he/him) is an Associate Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology. His work explores the political qualities of contemporary design, and he is particularly interested in participatory and critical approaches to making and using technology. He is the author of Design as Democratic Inquiry and Adversarial Design, co-editor of Participatory Design for Learning, and an editor of the journal Design Issues.\n\nDr. Sang Won Lee\n\nOctober 26th, 2022\n\n3:00pm\n\nLocation: ITE430\n\nThis talk discusses ways to design computational systems that facilitate empathic communication and collaboration in various domains. My research agenda is a journey for me to create a framework we can use to understand the components we need to consider in using technologies to foster empathy. The framework will be introduced, and I will focus on the recent projects that suggest sharing perspectives as a prerequisite towards empathy and address technical barriers to sharing perspectives in emerging technologies.\n\nBio: Sang Won Lee is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. His research aims to understand how we can design interactive systems that facilitate empathy among people. His research vision of computer-mediated empathy comes from his computer music background, thriving to bring music’s expressive, collaborative, and empathic nature to computational systems. He creates interactive systems that can facilitate understanding by providing ways to share perspectives, preserve context in computer-mediated communication, and facilitate self-reflection. He has applied these approaches to various applications, including creative writing, informal learning, writing, and programming.\n\nMedia Ruins: Infrastructural Restitution and Historical Futuring in Post-Conflict Cambodia\n\nMaggie Jack, PhD\n\nApril 25th, 2022\n\n3:00pm\n\nOnline: https://umbc.webex.com/umbc/j.php?MTID=me8b94e5f82417f39be02e783ec814e36\n\nThis talk describes the ways that Cambodian new media creators commemorate lost artists and an imagined better way of life through finding, repairing, and disseminating historical film, photography and cinema artifacts from before the Khmer Rouge period, often using digital tools. Reconstructing such media artifacts through a process of infrastructural restitution is a mode of healing from decades of national conflict and a form of subtle political action in an increasingly authoritarian Phnom Penh. Building on theory at the intersection of infrastructure studies (Star and Ruhleder, 1996; Larkin, 2013) and media’s relationship to memory (Gordon, 2008; Larkin, 2008; Richards, 1994), the concept of infrastructural restitution allows us to (re)integrate the importance of memory, the affective, and the spiritual into scholarship of infrastructure. This case gives new insight into the tension in transnational technology use between creative appropriation and the problematic political economy of mainstream platforms. The empirical sections of this talk are based on my historical and ethnographic research in Phnom Penh beginning in January 2014, including 20 months of full-time research from June 2017-January 2019.\n\nBio: I am a postdoctoral scholar on the NSF-funded project “Creating Work/Life” with a team spanning Syracuse University (PI: Ingrid Erickson) and University of California, Irvine (PI: Melissa Mazmanian). I am a research affiliate at the Digital Life Initiative at Cornell Tech in New York City and an adjunct professor at NYU Tandon, teaching “Transnational Technology” in the spring of 2022. I hold a PhD in Information Science (2020) from Cornell University, where I had a minor PhD concentration in Anthropology and was an active member of the Southeast Asia Program. I use my past professional experiences in the technology industry in Silicon Valley and the international development sector and my academic background in the History of Science (BA Harvard University; MPhil University of Cambridge) to approach questions of contemporary computing with both scholarly and practical lenses. My writing is published in the Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing (CHI), Interactions Magazine, The Information Society, Global Perspectives, Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), and elsewhere. My book-in-progress Media Ruins is under contract in the Labor and Technology series at the MIT Press (Katie Helke, editor; Winifred Poster, series editor).\n\nLighting up Learning: Addressing Systemic & Individual Oppression in K-12 CS Education\n\nJoanna Goode, PhD\n\nApril 18th, 2022\n\n3:00pm\n\nOnline: https://umbc.webex.com/umbc/j.php?MTID=me8b94e5f82417f39be02e783ec814e36\n\nJoanna Goode will visit the Designing pARticipatory futurEs (DARE) research lab and HCC department at UMBC to discuss how the interaction of systemic discrimination and individuals’ biased belief systems in K-12 schools results in inequitable participation and engagement of students in computer science classrooms. Despite multiple efforts over the past decades, an examination of who benefits from computing education continues to be stratified by students’ intersectional identities of race and gender. Joanna will talk about how addressing equity in computing education requires a commitment to developing race-conscious policies and identity-inclusive practices that have evidence of supporting students with intersectional identities. Lastly, she will share how reforming educational policies and practices can support teachers in creating learning spaces characterized by culturally responsive pedagogy, inquiry-based teaching and learning, and a focus on personally-authentic computing topics that resonate with youth.\n\nBio: Joanna Goode is the Sommerville Knight Professor of Education at University of Oregon. Dr. Goode is an educational researcher, a teacher educator, and formerly, a high school teacher. Dr. Goode is a co-author of Stuck in the Shallow End: Education, Race, and Computing and a co-creator of the Exploring Computer Science high school course.\n\nUsing Biology to Make: Design Biology for Research, Learning, and Practice\n\nJustice Walker, PhD\n\nOctober 25th, 2021\n\n3:00pm\n\nOnline: https://umbc.webex.com/umbc/j.php?MTID=me8b94e5f82417f39be02e783ec814e36\n\nIn recent years enabling biotechnologies have not only had significant impacts on modern society, but have also shifted how we interact with life science. These changes expand inquiry to include a new emphasis on design—where tools such as synthetic biology can be used to generate new materials and functional objects for use in myriad applications. Concomitant with these shifts have been efforts to understand how we might leverage these tools in education to support societal innovation, occupational attainment, and literacy. A central line of inquiry in my research involves learning science perspectives to examine the learners, learning and learning spaces where design biology is a driving frame for participation. I share research insights from three research projects involving design biology—and implications they have for K-12 education.\n\nBio: I am an assistant professor at The University of Texas at El Paso of STEM Education interested in understanding how emerging technologies like synthetic biology can be leveraged in ways to encourage learning conditions that are both accessible and equitable. I work with a team of incredibly creative researchers who bring myriad perspectives drawn from the arts and sciences. This affords me insights into the ways academic domains intersect to create innovative outcomes.\n\nTechnology of the Oppressed: Inequity and the digital mundane in Favelas of Brazil\n\nDavid Nemer, PhD\n\nOctober 11th, 2021\n\n3:00pm\n\nOnline: https://umbc.webex.com/umbc/j.php?MTID=me8b94e5f82417f39be02e783ec814e36\n\nNemer draws on extensive ethnographic fieldwork to provide a rich account of how favela residents engage with technology in their everyday lives. Their stories reveal the structural violence of the information age. But they also show how those oppressed by technology don’t just reject it, but consciously resist and appropriate it, and how their experiences with digital technologies enable them to navigate both digital and nondigital sources of oppression—and even, at times, to flourish.\n\nBio: David Nemer is an Assistant Professor of Media Studies and Affiliated Faculty in Latin American Studies at the University of Virginia. David Nemer has a PhD in Computing, Culture, and Society from Indiana University, and a Master’s in Anthropology from the University of Virginia, and in Computer Science from Saarland University. He is also an Affiliated Scholar at Princeton University’s Brazil Lab. He is the author of “Technology of the Oppressed” (forthcoming February 2022, MIT Press) and “Favela Digital: The other side of technology” (2013, GSA).\n\nPersonal Biochips\n\nMirela Alistar, PhD\n\nSeptember 27th, 2021\n\n3:00pm\n\nOnline: https://umbc.webex.com/umbc/j.php?MTID=me8b94e5f82417f39be02e783ec814e36\n\nIn my work, I investigate how to ubiquitize healthcare by moving the process of diagnosis closer to the patient. Today, diagnosis requires patients to see a doctor to provide samples, which are then sent to a wetlab. The lab conducts tests on the samples and reports back to the doctor, who ultimately reports back to the patient. This process tends to take days or even weeks – valuable time during which patients live in uncertainty and disease is allowed to spread. What if instead doctors could perform the tests while the patient waits? Or, what if we could empower patients to perform selected tests at home, as part of their decision whether to see a doctor in the first place?\n\nI pursue this vision by creating cyber-physical systems based on small electronic devices called biochips. Biochips manipulate droplets of fluids by executing “bio-protocols” – simple programs that move, split, and mix droplets with chemical compounds (“reagents”). Biochips thereby automate processes traditionally performed manually in wet labs. The key advantage of biochips is that they are adaptable, thus capable of running different bio-protocols. Instead of going to a specialist, a patient can download a bio protocol. This transforms diagnosis into a software problem that has the potential to scale the way software scales.\n\nIn order to enable the transition towards doctors and ultimately patients, I am working on ways to design biochips that can be operated at the level of expertise of doctors and patients. I design and fabricate novel biochip hardware (recently adopted by researchers at universities like MIT and the University of Washington), write system-level software (real-time compilation and fault-tolerant synthesis), and am currently developing a user-facing system that allows users to edit bio-protocol interactively​.\n\nBio: Mirela (assistant professor, ATLAS Institute, Computer Science) investigates the extent to which we can change healthcare to make it a personal process. Her research focuses around microfluidic biochips, devices that enable direct interaction of humans with their microbiome for diagnosis purposes. So far Mirela has built systems based on biochips to serve as personal laboratories: small portable devices that people can own and use to develop customized bio-protocols (“bio-apps”).\n\nMirela is an active contributor to the DIYBio movement, having led and co-founded community wetlabs. In this context, she organizes interactive performances, art installations and open workshops, in order to engage the public in direct interaction with living materials (e.g., bacteria, viruses, fungi)\n\nMirela received her PhD from the Technical University of Denmark in 2014, and until 2018, she was a postdoc in Patrick Baudish’s lab at Hasso Plattner Institute in Germany. Mirela’s work is published in top-tier journals and conferences (IEEE TCAD) and has been demonstrated at venues such as IEEE ESWeek and Molecular Communications. Mirela has served as a guest editor for Current Biotechnology journal (CBNT) and as a reviewer for venues such as Applied Materials and Interfaces, DATE, TCAD, ToDAES, NanoCom and UIST.\n\nPrototype Nation: China & the Contested Promise of Innovation\n\nSilvia Lindtner, PhD\n\nMonday, April 19th, 2021\n\n3:00pm\n\nOnline: https://umbc.webex.com/umbc/j.php?MTID=me8b94e5f82417f39be02e783ec814e36\n\nHow did China’s mass manufacturing and “copycat” production become transformed, in the global tech imagination, from something holding the nation back to one of its key assets? Prototype Nation offers a transnational analysis of how the promise of democratized innovation and entrepreneurial life has shaped China’s governance and global image. Lindtner reveals how a growing distrust in Western models of progress and development, including Silicon Valley and the tech industry after the financial crisis of 2007–8, shaped the rise of the global maker movement and the vision of China as a “new frontier” of innovation. Lindtner’s investigations draw on more than a decade of research in makerspaces, tech incubators, corporate offices, and factories. She examines how the ideals of the maker movement, to intervene in social and economic structures, served the technopolitical project of prototyping a “new” optimistic, assertive, and global China. In doing so, Lindtner demonstrates that entrepreneurial living influences governance, education, policy, investment, and urban redesign in ways that normalize the persistence of sexism, racism, colonialism, and labor exploitation. Prototype Nation shows that by attending to the bodies and sites that nurture entrepreneurial life, technology can be extricated from the seemingly endless cycle of promise and violence.\n\n**Get Prototype Nation now for 30% off with code P234 from the Princeton U Press website**\n\nBio: Silvia Lindtner (she/her) is Associate Professor at the University of Michigan in the School of Information and Associate Director of the Center for Ethics, Society, and Computing (ESC). She is a founding member of Precarity Lab, a research collective working on various forms of insecurity, vulnerability, and social and cultural exclusion that digital platforms produce, and mediate. Lindtner’s research interests include cultures and politics of technology innovation and entrepreneurship, with a particular focus on the gendered and racialized forms of labor necessary to incubate entrepreneurial life and sustain technological promise. Lindtner draws from more than ten years of multi-sited ethnographic research, with a particular focus on China’s shifting position in the global political economy of technology production, economic development, and science and technology policy. Lindtner’s work contributes to the fields of STS (science and technology studies), cultural and feminist anthropology, China studies, HCI (human computer interaction), global communication studies, science and technology policy, and design. Her research has been awarded support from the US National Science Foundation, IMLS, Intel Labs, Google Anita Borg, and the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation.\n\nTowards Accounting for the Human in Emotion Recognition/AI Technologies\n\nNazanin Andalibi, PhD\n\nMonday, March 29th, 2021\n\n3:00pm\n\nOnline: https://umbc.webex.com/umbc/j.php?MTID=me8b94e5f82417f39be02e783ec814e36\n\nEmotions are powerful, mediate humans’ experiences with their surroundings, and impact decision-making and attention online and off. Sharing and signaling one’s emotions to other humans can be beneficial, but involves privacy calculations and complex decision-making processes. Despite the deeply personal nature of human emotion, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are being built to recognize and infer emotions using data sources such as social media behavior, streaming service use, voice, facial expressions, biometrics, and body language in ways often unknown to users.\n\nA key perspective missing from debates in emotion AI/recognition is that of the humans who produce the data that make emotion recognition possible, and whose experiences are shaped by these technologies. In this talk I will share insights from my recent work around data subjects’ attitudes toward and conceptions of emotion recognition technologies, factors informing these attitudes, as well as anticipated risks and benefits. I focus on social media as a technological context and discuss data subjects’ attitudes towards emotion recognition on social media broadly, as well as emotion AI’s use in wellbeing and advertising domains. I then complicate accuracy and transparency notions in emotion recognition through an analysis of data subjects’ attitudes towards these notions and related folk theories. I conclude with a discussion of my research group’s ongoing and future research in this space.\n\nBio: Dr. Nazanin Andalibi is an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Information.

Those benefits rarely reach billions of underprivileged lives around the world fighting extreme poverty, illiteracy, gender discrimination, forced migration, and various other exploitations and marginalization. The services that are available through computing often fail to address their needs and constraints. My research with various marginalized communities in the Indian subcontinent over the last twelve years has revealed how this failure is often associated with some of the core issues of computing, including access, autonomy, and justification. In this talk, I will explain these three topics by describing three projects that I have been working on, each of which involves ethnography and design work with marginalized communities in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Canada. My talk will focus on how access to computing becomes limited by the imposition of colonial perspectives, how autonomy over a digital platform is curtailed by discriminatory standards, and how computing technologies often silence local voices by using western scientific rationalities. In this talk, I will further demonstrate how my design research explores possible ways to strengthen the voice of marginalized communities by focusing on local values, participation, and pluralism.\n\nBio: Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Toronto.

Though technology cannot fully solve these problems, technological solutions may help to address some of the challenges trans people and communities face. In this talk I will discuss how “trans technology” can be designed. Drawing from participatory design research with trans and nonbinary people, I detail four types of technologies trans people envision: technologies for changing bodies, technologies for changing appearances and gender expressions, technologies for safety, and technologies for finding resources. I show how centering trans people in the design process enabled inclusive technology design that primarily focused on sharing community resources and prioritized connection between community members. Next, I will discuss some of my research conceptualizing life transitions more broadly and people’s online sharing behaviors surrounding them. Finally, I will describe next steps for trans technology design research.\n\nBio: Oliver Haimson is an Assistant Professor at University of Michigan School of Information and a recipient of a National Science Foundation CAREER award.

At a large scale, social simulations are being used, for example, to model people’s response to a natural disaster. At a medium-scale, models of human decision-makers are being used to study social technical systems such as the pharmaceutical drug supply network. At the highly detailed individual scale, virtual replicas of humans are being crafted. These virtual humans are facsimiles of people that can engage people in face-to-face interactions using the same verbal and nonverbal behavior people use. The designs of these various models heavily leverage psychological theories and data. Psychology and the social sciences, in turn, are increasingly using these computational artifacts as means to formulate, test and explore theories about human behavior.\n\nIn this talk, I will first give a brief overview of my group’s work in social simulation and virtual humans. Then I will provide my perspective on the synergy between psychology and the engineering of these artifacts as well as illustrate this perspective using our work on the computational modeling of emotion.\n\nBio: Stacy Marsella is a professor in the Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology at University of Glasgow, where he is the director of the Centre for Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience.
