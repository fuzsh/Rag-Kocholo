        "text": "Presented by: Dr. Matthew Johnson, CDAO; CDR Michael Hanna, ONI\n\nThe Deputy Secretary of Defense has said that Responsible AI is how we will win with regard to strategic competition, ‘not in spite of our values, but because of them’…but what does this actually mean? This presentation introduces the DoD’s work to operationalize this approach, showing how Responsible AI sustains our tactical edge. The presentation provides a deep dive into a key piece of the DoD’s approach to Responsible AI: the Responsible AI Toolkit. The Toolkit is a voluntary process through which AI projects can identify, track, and mitigate RAI-related issues (and capitalize on RAI-related opportunities for innovation) via the use of tailorable and modular assessments, tools, and artifacts. The Toolkit rests on the twin pillars of the SHIELD Assessment and the Defense AI Guide on Risk (DAGR), which holistically address AI risk. The Toolkit enables risk management, traceability, and assurance of responsible AI practice, development, and use.\n\nModerator: Mr. Peter Teague, CDAO\n\nPanelists: Mr. Jon Elliott, CDAO; Dr. Shannon Gallagher, CMU SEI; Dr. Catherine Crawford, IBM, Mr. Shiraz Zaman, Nand AI\n\nA key problem with leveraging AI is understanding how it will integrate with existing workflows. I push this notion of understanding human parity in a given task so that we know what to expect when the model is deployed – i.e., we have performance parameters determined. However, with comprehensive capabilities, like LLMs, there may be multiple steps in a workflow that get replaced and we need to understand the impact of this.\n\nModerator: LtCol Jeffrey Wong, CDAO\n\nPanelists: Dr. Kathleen Fisher, DARPA; Dr. Andrew Moore, Lovelace AI; Mr. Peter Guerra, Oracle\n\nThe rise of LLMs over the past year has accelerated the development of AI and educated the public about the potential of this powerful technology. It has also flagged some of the problems inherent in complex, data-centric systems, to the point where many noted data scientists have questioned the wisdom of progressing too fast. What have LLMs taught us about the future of AI? How does this technology change the trajectory or expectation of new technology development?\n\nModerator: Dr. Diana Gehlhaus, Special Competitive Studies Project\n\nPanelists: Ms. Jennifer Schofield, DAIM; Rear Adm. Alexis Walker, NRC; MajGen William Bowers, MCRC\n\nThe question is not whether DoD needs digital talent, but rather how to get it, grow it, keep it—and how to use it most effectively. We’ll discuss the challenges facing DoD, including those systemic to the entire tech ecosystem, as well as those unique to DoD. We’ll explore ideas for addressing these challenges, and debate their pros, cons, and feasibility. There is no easy answer, but we’ll come away with a better sense of the options and trade space available to DoD.\n\nModerator: Mr. David Jin, CDAO\n\nPanelists: Dr. Beat Buesser, IBM; Dr. Nathan VanHoudnos, CMU SEI; Mr. Alvaro Velasquez, DARPA\n\nAs DoD systems become integrated with AI and autonomy capabilities, the question of novel attack surfaces and vulnerabilities arises. While adversarial AI has become a topic of great interest in recent years, much of the existing work within the field of adversarial AI has been done within academia and research.\n\nThis panel discussion will bring together DoD adversarial AI experts to discuss the realistic application of adversarial AI on the DoD’s AI-enabled capabilities.\n\nModerator: Dr. Robert Houston, CDAO\n\nPanelists: Mr. Evan Jones, UMD ARLIS ; Mr. Yosef Razin, IDA; Ms. Amber Mills, JHU-APL\n\nThis panel emphasizes the importance of Human Systems Integration (HSI) Test and Evaluation (T&E) throughout the lifecycle of an AI-enabled system, advocating for its implementation early, often, and always. Traditional HSI T&E data is usually captured through discrete experiments, an approach not well-suited for the automated, continuous testing required for AI/ML models. The panel will discuss (1) the challenges in instrumenting HSI-relevant data capture, (2) strategies and methodologies for integrating HSI into automated, real-time testing environments, and (3) innovative measures that utilize real-time user inputs such as search queries, tone of voice, response latency, and sentiment analysis.\n\nModerator: Ms. Margie Palmieri, CDAO\n\nPanelists: Dr. Michael Horowitz, OSD Policy; Lieutenant Colonel Kangmin Kim, ROK Army; Commodore Rachel Singleton, UK, Head, Defence AI Centre; Military Expert 6 Wilson Zhang, Singapore, Deputy Future Systems & Technology Architect\n\nThe United States works closely with allies and partners to apply existing international rules and norms and develop a common set of understandings among nations guiding the responsible use of AI in defense. This panel provides the opportunity to promote order and stability in the midst of global technological change. The United States has been a global leader in responsible military use of AI and autonomy, with the Department of Defense championing ethical principles and policies on AI and autonomy for over a decade. Among various national and international efforts, the United States, together with 46 nations, endorsed the Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy in November 2023, providing a normative framework addressing the use of these capabilities in the military domain. Given the significance of responsible AI in defense and the importance of addressing risks and concerns globally, the internationally focused session at the Symposium will be focused on these critical global efforts to adopt and implement responsible AI in defense. This panel will provide various country perspectives on the development, adoption, and implementation of principles and good practices on responsible AI, including multilateral efforts related to the Political Declaration on the Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy.\n\nPresenter: Ricky Clark, NIH\n\nIn May 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to strengthen and improve America’s cybersecurity. Known as “Zero Trust” the order called for federal agencies to wall off information technology (IT) systems behind a secure network perimeter. Two years later, federal agencies are “on the clock” and actively working to integrate Zero Trust architecture into their existing IT environment.\n\nAccording to a recent report from General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), the “Agency Guide to Zero Trust Maturity,” civilian and federal agencies are making progress toward meeting zero trust but continue to face significant challenges in implementation, such as lack of IT expertise, identifying and prioritizing needs and concerns around repairing or rebuilding existing legacy infrastructure.\n\nWith a September 2024 deadline looming for compliance, what can agencies do to ensure they are compliant in 2024.\n\nDuring this session, NIH Information Technology Acquisition and Assessment Center (NITAAC) will explore the barriers agencies face in realizing zero trust and identify solutions that exist within the confines of the NITAAC Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC)s.\n\nThe session will discuss the following:\n\n• Overview of Zero Trust\n\n• Common barriers agencies face\n\n• Practical solutions within the NITAAC GWACs to help overcome them\n\nPresenter: John Lee, NGA\n\nSoftware is key to almost every NGA mission, which means NGA must provide its developers with the best tools to build, release, and operate software securely at the speed of mission. NGA’s Common Operations Release Environment (CORE) seeks to answer that requirement by providing a shared environment with a collection of integrated development and operational services for teams inside and outside of NGA. The beginning of CORE dates back to 2016, when NGA first delivered a modern Platform-as-a-Service for teams to build on. The capabilities grew over the years. Today’s version of CORE gives software development teams a common toolset to build software more reliably, efficiently, and securely on all domains. CORE currently has seven service offerings—DevSecOps, Platform-as-a-Service, API Management, Developer Experience, Continuous Monitoring, Workflow Orchestration, and Messaging—with ML Ops coming soon. This presentation will provide an overview of CORE services and how adoption of the CORE is facilitating fulfillment of the NGA Software Way strategy, as well as give some examples of mission capabilities delivered to operations through the CORE.\n\nPresenter: Graig Baker, DISA\n\nDISA SD43 National Gateway Branch provides a range of assured messaging and directory services to a customer community that includes the Military Services, DoD Agencies, Combatant Commands (CCMD), and Other U.S. Government Agencies (OGA) and the Intelligence Community (IC). DISA is preparing to field the Organizational Messaging Service Java Messaging Service (OMS-JMS), a cutting-edge messaging and directory support solutions and services implementing the IC Message Service (ICMS) XML standard for hi-fidelity message formatting while continuing to support legacy ACP-127/128 gateway connections to provide seamless interoperability across our customer community for the preservation of National Defense. This presentation provides the messaging community an overview of the new DISA OMS-JMS solutions and services which are to begin fielding during FY24.\n\nPresenters: Katie Kalthoff, DIA; Jonathan Abolins, DIA; Joshua Burke, DIA\n\nDIA Platform-as-a-Service (DPaaS) is an enterprise container management platform that provides an open ecosystem to build, integrate, and enhance applications and services to meet requirements for production mission capabilities. Containerized applications hosted on DPaaS environments benefit from scalability, built-in security, hybrid-IT capabilities, and infrastructure-agnostic deployments. DPaaS enhances a developer’s ability to focus on functionality, enabling mission applications to be rapidly prototyped, deployed, and moved at the speed of mission while reducing technical overhead. DPaaS is also a leading force in DIA’s effort to provide compute and storage services at Edge locations. DPaaS enables application developers to build once and deploy everywhere, meaning to multiple networks as well as to the Edge. Edge deployments are a necessity in the era of strategic competition where warfighters and decision-makers must be able to quickly access data and applications in low-bandwidth or disconnected areas. DPaaS is pushing deployments to regional and edge locations to enable mission support while making applications easier to manage. Edge deployments allow for fewer service disruptions to forward deployed intelligence personnel and continued operations during disconnected events. This greater flexibility and ability to meet mission need will be a driving factor for greater innovation within IC application development.\n\nPresenter: Charles Bellinger, NGA\n\nAs part of NGA’s greater multi-tiered edge strategy, Joint Regional Edge Nodes (JREN) and Odyssey systems—designed to facilitate the movement of critical intelligence and data sharing—are being deployed to combatant commands. JREN is an innovative, highly scalable, next-generation edge node capability providing the foundation to support Sensor to Effect (S2E) and future ground architecture with multiple cloudlike layers to enable seamless interoperability and collaboration in both connected and disconnected states. Deployed in January 2022, JREN provides significant storage, computing power, transport bandwidth, and applications closer to the tactical edge. JREN will support expanding DoD, IC, and coalition customer requirements with AOR-specific content, GEOINT/partner applications, and high-performance computing. Odyssey is a forward-deployed system that provides access to applications and theater GEOINT data hosted on local servers to support users at the edge in the event of disconnected ops. Using a combination of hardware, apps, data, and products, Odyssey deployments are available via a web browser established on theater users’ networks and connected back to NGA. This presentation will focus on design considerations such as increased resiliency in Denied, Degraded, Intermittent, and limited bandwidth (DDIL) environments via direct satellite downlink; reduced transport latency; and use of NGA’s Common Operations Release Environment to develop, deploy, and operate modern GEOINT software. This presentation will also highlight how automation, artificial intelligence, and other JREN and Odyssey services are prepared for the exponential growth in intelligence sensors and collection capabilities.\n\nPresenter: Vanessa Hill, DIA\n\nIn today’s digital age, websites and applications have become an integral part of our daily lives and the digital landscape has transformed the way we interact with the world. However, not all users have the same abilities, and it is crucial to ensure that digital experiences are inclusive and accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. DIA’s first-ever 508 IT Accessibility lab promotes a more inclusive and diverse digital environment, where everyone can participate and benefit from digital experiences by ensuring products are usable and accessible to all users. Come join us to learn how DIA is developing and testing capabilities, such as improved closed captioning on multiple platforms (VTC, SVTC, and DVTC) to leveraging virtual desktop to host a lightweight application that provides translation capabilities to support DIA’s multilingual Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) members, and more. Incorporating accessibility testing into your digital product development process, and embracing the power of accessibility testing and training, unleashes the full potential of your digital products and creates a more inclusive digital environment for all users.\n\nPresenters: Jonathan Abolins, DIA; Katie Kalthoff, DIA; Joshua Burke, DIA\n\nHybrid IT provides a solution that combines the capabilities of commercial cloud, government-owned data centers, and edge devices into one single capability. By using Hybrid IT, the Defense Intelligence Enterprise gains the flexibility to leverage the advantages of each service model to address the needs of different mission sets. A mix of cloud and on-prem provides improved disaster recovery capabilities, higher availability, and the ability to access mission-critical applications and data from anywhere, even in disconnected locations. However, hybrid and multi-cloud architectures pose unique security challenges and require a different approach than what solely on-prem environments or single clouds require. Without additional protections, we face the risk of fragmented security solutions and a decrease in threat visibility. The Defense Intelligence Agency protects enterprise and customer applications with a security service mesh which provides zero-trust enabled capabilities such as authorization and access control, network segmentation, end-to-end encryption, and continuous monitoring. The application networking layer provides baked-in security from development to production and enables threat monitoring across fragmented application networks and clouds.\n\nPresenters: Kevin Shaw, Guidehouse; Christine Owen, Guidehouse\n\nThe Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity (EO-14028) was released over two and a half years ago. While the EO rapidly accelerated programs across the federal government, we are now in a position to reflect and look to the future of Zero Trust. We will share lessons learned from real-life Zero Trust deployments (including what has worked, what hasn’t) and how organizations can and should continually evolve and adapt their program.\n\nPresenter: Bailey Bickley, NSA\n\nDefense Industrial Base (DIB) companies are relentlessly targeted by our adversaries, who seek to steal U.S. intellectual property, sensitive DoD information and DIB proprietary information to undermine our national security advantage and economy. NSA is working to contest these efforts by providing no-cost cybersecurity services to qualifying DIB companies. NSA’s services are designed to help protect sensitive, but unclassified, DoD information that resides on private sector networks by hardening the top exploitation vectors that foreign malicious actors are using to compromise networks.\n\nEradicating cybersecurity threats to the DIB is an NSA priority. NSA’s Cybersecurity Collaboration Center (CCC) provides no-cost cybersecurity solutions for qualifying DIB companies. These solutions are easily implemented and scalable to protect against the most common nation-state exploitation vectors and are designed to help protect DoD information and reduce the risk of compromise. These services include Protective DNS, attack surface management, and access to NSA non-public, DIB-specific threat intelligence. Our pilot program is evaluating additional services for release.\n\nHundreds of industry partners of all sizes and complexities have already signed up for NSA’s cybersecurity services, which has helped protect these networks against malicious cyber activity. The no-cost cybersecurity services have also assisted with the early identification, exposure, and remediation of multiple nation-state campaigns targeting the DIB.\n\nPresenter: Andrew Heifetz, NGA\n\nWith the rise of Commercial Cloud Environment (C2E), programs have the potential to use services from multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). Multiple CSPs can decrease cost through competition and increase innovation by providing exquisite and unique services. However, developing for a multiple cloud environment is fraught with challenges including data gravity/portability, lack of interoperability standards, multiple cloud knowledge gaps, and security accreditation. In order to address these challenges and prepare for C2E, NGA conducted several multiple cloud pilots and will share the lessons learned as well as recommendations to prepare for multiple cloud development. This presentation is important for anyone considering multiple clouds and hybrid environments.\n\nModerator: Bob Crawford\n\nPanelists: Randy Resnick, DoD; David Voelker, DoN; Jennifer Kron, NSA; Ben Phelps, ODNI; Evan Kehayias, NGA\n\nThis session is essential for attendees responsible for or in roles related to defending against the growing, sophisticated Cyber threats the DoD and IC face. To strengthen our defenses, a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) will be implemented across the DoD and IC. To enable this, sound strategies with support from a ZT Architecture (ZTA) will help to guide the DoD and IC to accomplish Zero Trust maturity from basic, to intermediate, to ultimately advanced levels over the next five years.\n\nThe Office of the Intelligence Community Chief Information Officer (OIC CIO) developed a comprehensive Zero Trust (ZT) strategy and framework. The framework was developed by the IC ZT Steering Committee (ZTSC) and approved by all 18 IC elements. This session will focus on the tenets of the framework to include 31 capabilities, 4 maturity models, 7 pillars, and the IC ZT Architecture.\n\nDoD has developed their own robust Zero Trust framework. Working collaboratively the IC and DoD must implement Zero Trust, improving overall Cybersecurity while maintaining interoperability and data sharing capabilities.\n\nIn this panel discussion, cybersecurity experts from the DoD and IC will discuss both the challenges and opportunities to significantly improve information protection capabilities and implementations by adopting the Zero Trust approach — “never trust, always verify, assume breach” — to protect U.S. national security assets.\n\nPresenters: Marissa Snyder, DIA; Lauren Hix, DIA; Lisa Schrenk, DIA\n\nVintage is in, but not when it comes to payroll and benefits. Operating in a 20+ year-old IT system, DIA’s Office of Human Resources (OHR) current processes are overly complex, manual, and siloed. This resulted in incomplete, inconsistent datasets and slow reaction times to pivot the HR apparatus to mission needs. Even more importantly, this has taken DIA employees away from mission by burdening them with mundane administrative tasks. Soon, all of this will fade into history (like disco)!\n\nPropelled through the HR Modernization investment, we’ve taken revolutionary steps to transform DIA’s HR infrastructure to strengthen DIA’s mission posture for strategic competition. We invite you to learn more about our efforts and how we’ve gleaned helpful, data-driven insights from various studies of our workforce, networking with Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community (IC) partners, and engaging with commercial entities.\n\nThis transformative shift requires a whole-of-agency cultural change to scale our capabilities for future needs. The modernization and overhaul of DIA’s HR is centered around creating exceptional employee experiences, reducing process timelines, increasing data quality and transparency. Cutting through the chaos created by a constrained and outdated infrastructure, HR Modernization is enabling DIA to put the right people in the right place, with the right skills needed to execute the mission.\n\nPresenter: John Boska, DIA\n\nMany government processes are lengthy and time-consuming, including the process of taking an application from development to production on government hosted networks. This poses a problem for mission-critical applications for which speed and efficiency is essential for getting information to intelligence personnel in the era of strategic competition. DIA’s Capability Delivery Pipeline (CDP) was created to simplify and modernize application development in the IC. CDP is a streamlined software development pipeline which embraces the DevSecOps methodology and industry standards. CDP will streamline the Authority to Operate (ATO) process, incentivize continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), and abstract much of the overhead that comes with developing and deploying applications – including built-in security, governance, and hosting. CDP’s strategic goal is to provide one ecosystem used for secure software, hardware, service development, testing, and deployment spanning DIA’s Unclassified (IL5), Secret (IL6), and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) networks. CDP also aims to bring in more cloud service providers to DIA to allow for infrastructure-agnostic development and reduce costs of development by eliminating duplicate services and capabilities. This pipeline will enable max capability for DIA customers and stakeholders and increase information sharing with agency partners and foreign allies. Ultimately, CDP empowers DIA to accelerate the delivery of capabilities and services to obtain a competitive advantage against our adversaries.\n\nModerator: Ramesh Menon\n\nPanelists: Robert Lawton, ODNI; Dr. Abby Fanlo, CDAO; Elham Tabassi, NIST\n\nAs AI becomes increasingly more prevalent and advanced, the potential to positively impact every sector of our society has become apparent. While AI technologies have created tremendous efficiencies in how we live, think, and choose to invest our time and energy, it also has the potential to harm those that use it if not properly managed. The risks can become especially high when AI is used for critical national security missions. As the Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community (IC) continue to adopt AI as a disruptive technology used to advance warfighting and intelligence gathering capabilities, it is imperative that we trust AI that is being used for these critical national security missions. On this panel, you will hear from experts spearheading the AI Ethics initiatives that will affect industry, DoD, and IC. Topics discussed will include the new AI Risk Management Framework, DoD Ethical AI Principles, and how these will affect how we use and create trustworthy AI systems. Panelists include AI Ethics experts from the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office and National Institute of Standards and Technology. This panel will be moderated by DIA’s Chief Technology Officer, Mr. Ramesh Menon.\n\nModerator: Sudhir Marreddy\n\nPanelists: James Long, NGA; Ben Davis, ODNI; Amy Heald, CIA; Dylon Young, OUSD (I&S)\n\nThis session will be a must-attend breakout for attendees to gain an understanding and perspective of the emerging technologies that present both threats and opportunities for U.S. national security. The panelists will include participants from both the DD and IC covering rapidly emerging technology areas such as AI/ML, Cloud, Cybersecurity/Zero Trust, Data, Digital Foundations, Interoperability, Networks, and more.\n\nWith adversaries on the cusp of surpassing the U.S. in the near future, challenging our technological leadership, this panel will discuss the existential threat of rapidly emerging technologies. We will explore how we can both protect U.S. national security and prevent our adversaries from gaining access to, acquiring, developing and advancing their capabilities while we leverage those same capabilities.\n\nPresenters: Col Michael Medgyessy, USAF\n\nDAF CLOUDworks provides Enterprise and Security Services (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Collaboration tools (SaaS) to the DoD and AF IC. Partnered with Platform One, we provide DevSecOps pipelines across the Unclass, Secret and Top Secret cloud environments. Using our Operational DevSecOps for ISR NEXGEN (ODIN) platform enables your developers to focus on your application instead of underlying infrastructure. Our enterprise services reflect the security guardrails our Authorizing Official set forth. We are constantly iterating and adding common services to bring max value to our customers across the DoD and IC.\n\nPresenter: Dan Hetrick, ODNI\n\nBuilding clarity into a shared vision by defining the chaos. What does DEIA have to do with aligning a workforce? Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Accessibility. Regardless of how one sees the message of DEIA, amazing potential rises by aligning organizational mission with DEIA principles.\n\nThis presentation will highlight 10 ways to begin building a mindset under the Universal Principles within DEIA that will create a vision that drives mission to produce these benefits (at minimum), including better informed leaders in tune with the workforce, effective decision making, a shared vision that everyone supports, better products usable by everyone, Innovation, Security, Risk Mitigation, effective succession planning, and finally… A model of excellence for everyone to follow!\n\nModerator: Shannon Paschel\n\nPanelists: Elciedes Dinch-Mcknight, DIA; Katie Lipps, DIA; Dr. Rosemary Speers, DIA ; Lori Wade, DIA\n\nCIO is trying to foster a growth mindset to drive organizational change in culture and structure by making a concerted effort to develop and promote leaders from within and to fully utilize the talents of executive women for more diverse leadership. Addressing barriers and challenges experienced from various types of discrimination and bias based on the intersection of gender, race, and other personal characteristics. CIO Women in Leadership Program showcases a panel of women leaders who share their experiences and successful strategies to advance their careers at DIA-CIO. A key to success for women to achieve Senior Executive Levels at CIO is allyship and advocacy. According to research and organizational best practices, inclusive behaviors and communication patterns from all employees and leaders create inclusive organizational cultural change.\n\nPresenters: Sonny Hashmi, GSA; Brian Shipley, Navy; Chris Hamm, GSA\n\nGovernment procurement is often a complicated business. Between budget issues, Federal Acquisition regulations (FAR), and mission-critical needs, getting the products and services you need in a timely and straightforward manner is challenging at best.\n\nHear from customers and users who balance these requirements every day and help make it easier to get technology to the mission at the speed of need. The discussion will focus on the acquisition space and how partnerships between federal agencies can make it easier to rapidly field emerging technologies and do business with and across government.\n\nPresenter: Stephen Kensinger, DIA\n\nDIA is taking a holistic approach in reviewing and modernizing all of its provided services for Zero Trust to support the demands for its future data-centric architecture. This discussion will include how the agency is approaching Zero Trust to be a mission enabler for the Enterprise. This DIA vision includes efforts to streamline the Risk Management Framework (RMF) by integrating results through Zero Trust enabled technology/services and modernized processes. Although focus has been for near term maturity requirements, the team has started to explore the integration of machine learning to contribute to this streamlining effort. It will also delve into the planning and prototype efforts that the DIA Zero Trust team has led for development and integration of core cyber services to provide entitlements access to properly tagged data objects. The DIA Zero Trust team has partnered with DIA mission stakeholders and our Chief Data Office to begin to address these challenges and to convey to the workforce the new value these modernized DoDIIS services will offer to mission.\n\nPresenter: Robert Williams, DIA\n\nThe Defense Intelligence Agency’s Analytic Innovation Office will discuss the AI Roadmap for All-source Analysis, which adds clarity and cohesiveness to the all-source analytic modernization process. The Roadmap provides a comprehensive and applied approach to artificial intelligence (AI) that spans experimentation, quality and tradecraft assurance, AI skills and digital literacy development, and business process improvements – aspects that were largely fragmented until now. The Roadmap achieves clarity from chaos by tightly aligning six key objectives that address the application of applied AI methods to mission, building an AI-ready analytic workforce, and equipping AI practitioners with a framework for ensuring compliance with analytic tradecraft standards. Hear about the critical challenges such as systematically upskilling an analytic workforce, accelerating the development of an AI-ready workforce by reducing the skills gap with low code solutions, and assessing analytic workflows at-scale to identify optimal human-machine-teaming opportunities. Other challenges include accessing data in ways that enables the leveraging of machine learning methods at-scale, and pivoting from reactionary to predictive analytics. You will hear about aspects of AI adoption through the lens of an organization responsible for leading analytic modernization, that will leave the audience and industry participants with an appreciation for the unique challenges of achieving AI-readiness within an all-source analytic organization.\n\nPresenters: Peter Guerra, Oracle; Josh Tatum, Oracle\n\nTactical edge capabilities enable organizations to extend cloud services and applications to the edge. This allows for improved performance, security, and availability of applications and services, as well as to collect and analyze data at the edge, which can provide real-time insights and decision-making capabilities in connected and disconnected environments. Tactical edge capabilities, across classification boundaries, allow the warfighter to obtain situational awareness through edge compute, AI, and security where needed. This talk will walk through the use of tactical edge within the DoD and IC to present real world use cases.\n\nPresenters: Theresa Kinney, NASA; Kanitra Tyler, NASA; Jeanette McMillian, ODNI; Lisa Egan, DIA\n\nUS Government Employees Only. Welcome to “The Exchange”; an internal, selective government-only community of intelligence and non-Title 50 agencies dedicated to initiating practices that help secure government-wide supply chains.

Reserve your space here.\n\nIn this fireside chat we are going to have a conversation with two of the DoD’s premier R&D organization’s senior leaders. We will be covering topics such as SAP IT, cybersecurity, risk, mission, and policy. You are going to want to come to this chat to understand how well we are communicating at the most senior levels, where our community can do better, what keeps them up at night, and the challenges imposed by R&D.\n\nDerek Claiborne, Chainalysis\n\nJackie Koven, Chainalysis\n\nWeb3 is all about innovation and collaboration – but with that comes heightened risks. Chainalysis has a commitment to creating a safer environment for all who enter the world of Web3. In this discussion, we will explore blockchain’s potential in addressing challenges faced by our warfighters. The evolving threat landscape involving strategic competitors, rogue nations, and terrorist groups is examined, with a particular emphasis on their exploitation of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities. The role of blockchain technology in countering these threats is then elucidated, showcasing its characteristics like decentralization and transparency.\n\nThis includes a deep dive into using blockchain for geolocating threat actors and tracking illicit activities. International collaboration and the integration of blockchain-based intelligence into defense strategies are discussed as well. Challenges, considerations, future prospects, and recommendations for blockchain adoption in cybersecurity and defense form vital segments of the discourse, ultimately underlining the significance of embracing emerging technologies like blockchain to empower warfighters and enhance national security in an ever-evolving digital landscape.\n\nAudiences will gain a comprehensive understanding of how blockchain technology can effectively address blockchain-enabled threats and enable the geolocation of threat actors in the realm of cybersecurity and defense. They will also recognize the pivotal role of international collaboration and blockchain integration in bolstering national security efforts across evolving global challenges.\n\nHarry Cornwell, Palo Alto Networks\n\nDelivering zero trust at an enterprise level begins with a fundamental change in how the DoD builds its cyber security architecture to prioritize both security and performance. Zero trust is built upon the foundation that there is already a malicious actor or compromised data or devices within the enterprise. This assumption creates a need for a process of continuous validation of users, devices, applications, and data in an entirely controlled and visible manner. With Palo Alto Networks’s Zero Trust Network Access 2.0 (ZTNA 2.0), coarse-grained access controls based on an “allow and ignore” model is left behind to introduce a consistent least-privilege access control model focusing on application layer security inspection.\n\nJosef Allen, USAF\n\nAdam Gruber, Applied Insight\n\nThose defending our nation depend on access to accurate, timely information – and must manage large amounts of data from more sources now than at any other point in history. Disparate data sources, networks, and classification levels currently make it impossible for users in SAP and CAP environments to view data within a single standardized and normalized lens, limiting mission agility and increasing the time between data ingest and incorporation into command decisions.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, mission teams must currently develop custom tools and rely on manual processing of information to aggregate data and inform decisions. Feature gaps in pre-existing cloud capabilities within SAP environments further inhibit Guardians and other teams from efficiently leveraging cutting-edge technological capabilities to satisfy mission requirements, such as real-time data streaming, access to native cloud resources, and multi-cloud capabilities.\n\nProviding holistic data processing in SAP environments presents three major challenges: data transfer across and between classification fabrics, data access governance, and multi-tenancy. Additionally, implementing a fully comprehensive Zero Trust Architecture is paramount.\n\nThis problem is complex, but with the right tools it is solvable.\n\nTo accelerate data sharing to mission teams in a Common SAP across classification fabrics and disparate networks, USSF built a highly scalable, multi-tenant, ATO’d environment – empowering program teams to migrate critical mission workloads to the cloud while maintaining logical separation of those workloads. Additionally, the USSF team designed and implemented a cutting-edge data management capability that enforces Zero Trust access to data assets leveraging a cloud-based architecture.\n\nDouglas Gourlay, Arista Networks\n\nIn this presentation, we delve into the challenges and possible solutions when designing a unified, multi-domain network architecture that seamlessly integrates a diverse range of platforms: GEO & LEO satellites, airborne platforms, terrestrial networks, GovCloud transit, and trans-oceanic cables. This architecture not only ensures dynamic, encrypted, and secure multi-access networks, but also incorporates a self-healing fabric that can adapt to signal-denied environments while reducing operational load.\n\nComplementing this vision, we will explore the paradigm shift from legacy network operating models towards a software-centric ‘modern operating model’. Here, configurations are procedurally generated by automation that incorporate variables from multiple discrete systems-of-record. We also simulate network changes in a virtual twin environment, deploy to the network upon completion, and generate comprehensive documentation of the change.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards (NIST) has released several Post Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms planned for standardization in 2024. The National Security Agency has announced the Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite 2.0. The executive branch has released NSM-10. What does this mean for the SAP community?\n\nDr. Whitfield Diffie, Dr. Robert Campbell, and Mr. Charles Robinson will discuss what this means for SAP program managers and how they can effectively plan for the upcoming migration to post quantum cryptography. The Panel will discuss current and past cryptography role outs.. The panel will discuss process, landscape, and do a deep dive of the underlying cryptography. The panel will explore past cryptographic migrations best practices and discuss what’s different now. A discussion on what government organizations should be aware of when migrating to the new Post Quantum Cryptography Algorithms. We will discuss of best practices guidelines that NIST NcCOE program is developing to support implementation and transformation of government IT environments. Finally, some consideration of the strategy and a tactical construct SAP program managers should consider when migrating to a Quantum Safe enterprise.\n\nIn this session, we will delve into the transformative impact of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) models on modernizing network operations within the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community. The focus will be on leveraging procedural generation and IaC models for creating networking configurations, coverage-guided automated testing, and self-generating documentation. These techniques, integrated across a next-generation WAN, Campus, and Data Center reduce the complexity inherent in traditional networking configuration. This approach fosters the creation of repeatable design patterns that automate efficiently at scale and facilitate the generation of digital twin environments for functional testing and staging deployments.\n\nThen we will discuss and demonstrate a practical application of these models and technologies in deploying and operating a global WAN, encrypted with quantum-safe/secure cryptography, with trusted and measured/attested secure booting of each router, and utilizing a combination of networks including geostationary and commercial low-earth orbital satellites, LTE/5G, free-space photonics, public and private MPLS services, dark fiber and wavelength services, submarine transoceanic cables, and cloud provider backbones.\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) applications in cybersecurity sensing are heavily focused on threat detection by identifying abnormal indicators and eliminating false positives. The mathematical techniques used to achieve this have converged, with most applications still focused on perfecting existing algorithms. However, there are many aspects of human cognition which are not captured by AI/ML algorithms as they are applied today. Creativity, intuition, contextualization, topology, and even the special theory of relativity are emerging perspectives for AI/ML. New approaches are critical to “level up” our current sensing tools, and create the next generation of advanced artificial intelligence-driven cybersecurity.\n\nIn most discussions about the digital divide, we’re referring to the fact that approximately one-third of the world’s population lacks access to the internet. We often associate it with developing countries and attribute it to factors such as economics and infrastructure. The negative consequence of this digital divide in the information age is that we leave behind individuals and entire communities. As cloud technologies become central to everyday life, that divide grows wider. Ironically, although the SAP community works on the most bleeding-edge technologies for our warfighters, it also suffers from being on the wrong side of a similar digital divide. In this session, we’ll look at how we can close the digital divide for the SAP community.\n\nScott Devitt, General Dynamics Mission Systems\n\nBrian Newson, General Dynamics Mission Systems\n\nThe GDMS Chief Engineer for Multilevel Security, Scott Devitt, will demonstrate and explore real-world SAP use cases with MLS containers for DE Environments. During his 37 years with General Dynamics, Scott has designed, built, installed, and maintained classified capabilities for the DoD and IC including operational mission cells supporting forward locations with multiple stove piped networks at different classification levels. His presentation will highlight the value of a DE polyinstantiated or containerized framework in safeguarding SAP data and the benefits of leveraging a multilevel file share when working across multiple connected classified environments. It will also discuss the challenges faced in integrating the innovative capability into legacy stovepipe SAP networks with existing applications and explore potential solutions.\n\nIn summary, these three leading edge MLS DE design patterns present a robust set of solutions to the growing challenge of collaborating and working effectively in the ever-complex SAP community. By leveraging this capability, organizations can bolster security, consolidate costly licenses across networks and safeguard their most valuable data while also dramatically improving user operational efficiency on their primary network. By employing containerized applications, data transfers between networks are eliminated, reducing the risk of information leakage through unauthorized channels.\n\nOperational Technology (OT) plays a crucial role in controlling industrial processes and our critical infrastructure. However, with the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and increased connectivity, OT systems face amplified cyber risks. Historically isolated, these systems now often intersect with IT networks, making them vulnerable to threats, especially given their outdated software and the difficulty in patching them. The stakes are high: cyber-attacks on OT can disrupt power grids, halt manufacturing, and pose significant safety threats. Addressing these concerns requires a holistic strategy, integrating both OT and IT cybersecurity measures. As we advance in this digital age, it’s imperative that we prioritize and invest in the protection of these vital systems.\n\nIn the presentation “Breaking Barriers with Generative AI: Enhancing Systems Security and Data Sharing for the Warfighter,” we will explore the transformative potential of Generative AI in the context of emerging technologies to support the warfighter. This presentation directly addresses the theme of the conference, which focuses on the intersection of systems security, access management, and data sharing.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) should care about the application of Generative AI because it offers a unique opportunity to overcome existing barriers and enhance the DoD’s systems security and data sharing capabilities. Generative AI has the power to revolutionize the way the DoD operates by enabling the creation of synthetic data, generating realistic scenarios, and simulating complex environments. This technology can significantly improve training, testing, and decision-making processes, leading to more effective and efficient warfighter operations.\n\nBy leveraging Generative AI, the DoD can enhance systems security by simulating and identifying potential vulnerabilities, predicting and countering cyber threats, and developing robust defense mechanisms. Additionally, Generative AI enables secure and controlled data sharing, allowing the DoD to collaborate with partners, share information across agencies, and leverage collective intelligence while maintaining data privacy and integrity.\n\nThe impact of embracing Generative AI in the DoD environment is significant. It empowers the warfighter with advanced tools and capabilities, enabling them to make informed decisions, respond rapidly to evolving threats, and achieve mission success. By breaking barriers with Generative AI, the DoD can enhance its operational effectiveness, improve situational awareness, and ultimately ensure the safety and security of the nation.\n\nLeveraging AI to augment our information forces gives us massive new capabilities. Adversaries know the same thing and are trying to do the same thing. A small amount of high-performance computing (HPC) in the right places will solve many problems of AI relating to deployment, engagement, and data ingestion in environments where data security and access controls are paramount.\n\nUsing AI in secure, reliable, resilient, rapidly updated ways will give us an edge. Relying on commercial cloud providers for all computing, R&D, and services for machine intelligence is a risky way to get that edge. Relying on commercial cloud for the foundations and using in-house HPC expertise and resources to deliver the last mile of machine intelligence will reduce risk and accelerate the adoption of secure, reliable, robust, and repeatable AI inside the enterprise.\n\nToday’s warfighter is more connected than ever before to a streaming vector of actionable intelligence. Platforms, systems, and data – all traversing an ever-increasing number of endpoints. As we look to events around the world as leading examples of how the battleground continues to change, we are called to action to improve both the offensive and defensive digital capabilities of our military. To win, our priorities must clearly align to automating heterogeneous environments at a moment’s notice, delivering consolidated AI-infused digital experiences to each warfighter, and leverage Automation and AI to protect our digital advantage.\n\nScaling quantum computers will eventually break the digital security used in virtually all modern data networks. For decades, our adversaries have been collecting encrypted communications with the intention of decrypting and operationalizing it when larger quantum computers become available. This Cold War technique is known as “harvest now, decrypt later” (HNDL); it makes headlines today because quantum computers can break our existing algorithms by brute force. The transition to Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) does not solve the HNDL problem because the new algorithms have no mathematical proof of hardness. As such, NIST advised developers to be “crypto-agile” and prepared to replace PQC at any time in the future.\n\nFor decades, implementation errors, weak encryption keys, poor randomness, corrupted software libraries and a variety of attacks resulted in the total exploitation of stored HNDL data. The issue is fundamental to the single-points-of-failure in public key infrastructure (PKI) which is based on a 1970s architecture predating the internet, cloud, virtualization, and containerization used in modern information systems. Qrypt leverages multiple quantum entropy hardware sources and distributed software algorithms to enable end-to-end-encryption (EE2E) with simultaneous key generation at any endpoint. This mechanism decouples the data from the decryption keys, eliminates key distribution and is unaffected by multiple weaknesses in the system, including the potential failure of the PQC algorithms and insider threats.\n\nThe modern warfighter will operate in converged PKI environments on 5G/6G networks, using autonomous systems, in smart cities, built on technology under adversarial control. Secure communications will need much higher levels of assurance than currently possible. Incremental improvements to classical techniques will be insufficient in the quantum era.\n\nKelly Dalton, AFRL\n\nJonathan Thompson, AFRL\n\nThis is an update to last year’s presentation regarding an effort to provide DoD funded, shared supercomputing to the acquisition engineering, research, development, and test & evaluation communities. Large scale supercomputers are funded by the DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program for the purpose of providing no-cost computing to scientists and engineers working on DoD problems. Contractors can also access these resources under a DoD contract involving an RDT&E project. This unclassified/CUI presentation will provide information regarding current status and future plans by the Department of Defense to provide continued access to free supercomputing resources to government and contractors supporting special programs and/or SCI-related projects in the research, development, acquisition, and test & evaluation mission areas. Specifically, the large-scale computing resources provided by the DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) will be discussed as well as how to access these resources. The supercomputing systems undergo a recurring technical refresh funded by the DoD HPCMP. The individuals/organizations do not pay for compute time or storage on the DoD supercomputers as these are funded through the DoD HPC Modernization Program.\n\nUSG has prohibited acquisition of hardware from sanctioned entities and excluded those companies from doing business in the United States. But most program managers don’t realize that those same sanctioned entities and foreign adversaries actively develop, maintain and control software dependencies used by classified military programs. While these dependencies can theoretically be code-reviewed before approval, they’re almost never reviewed beyond a one-time check for viruses or known vulnerabilities – with little to no monitoring of upstream risks. And even if their source code is reviewed, there’s no chain of trust between repositories and published packages.\n\nThis talk will illustrate how Chinese and Russian developers are positioning in the upstream software supply chain, how that risk can be detected and how it can be managed in an automated way, at scale, in the absence of any known or detectable vulnerabilities in the code. Single-maintainer projects belonging to Russian government employees have been identified in federal APIs that handle highly sensitive data at high scale. The ecosystems in which adversarial entities are active include AI/ML used in defense, which was the subject of a year-long analytic project that Ion Channel (recently acquired by Exiger) executed for DTRA. The data backplane for identifying adversarial FOCI in upstream software dependencies has both defensive and offensive value in software-intensive programs and missions.\n\nKathleen Featheringham, Maximus\n\nMichael Sieber, Maximus\n\nFrank Reyes, Maximus\n\nAs the Defense Department (DoD) continues its cloud modernization journey with the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) and other programs, managing sensitive data in the cloud is a top priority and cybersecurity challenge.\n\nEmerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) offer novel strategies to fortify cryptographic practices, enhance data encryption, and bolster cloud security.\n\nReaping the benefits of AI-powered cloud security requires good data practices and data governance as well as proper configuration management and modern encryption strategies to ensure data security.\n\nThis session aims to address common cloud security concerns and outline use cases for comprehensive cybersecurity and encryption practices powered by AI to properly manage sensitive data in the cloud.\n\nRob Case, DON SAP CISO\n\nAn examination of the Risk Management Framework as a dynamic cybersecurity program featuring Cyber Hygiene, Cyber Readiness, and Continuous Compliance as prime disciplines. The end in mind is to finally mature beyond checklists and firefighting, develop locally relevant threat intelligence programs, prepare for continuous ATOs with fully developed ConMon programs, and generate feedback loops between the monitors and responders. This presentation explores the Risk Management Framework and JSIG control families as features of Cyber Hygiene (management of the authorized) and Cyber Readiness (management of the unauthorized) and encourages RMF practitioners to go beyond the ATO. The concept of outprocessing the checklist is encapsulated in a change of mindset; completing a task is not compliance and compliance is not security. Narrative-based bodies of evidence authored and informed by ISSOs are insufficient. Cybersecurity practitioners must seek system-based artifacts as their proof of configuration and ISSOs must be informed by the system.\n\nChad Steed, ORNL\n\nVisual analytics is a viable approach for enabling human-machine collaboration in today’s most challenging data analysis scenarios. While the increasing volume and complexity of modern data sets severely limits the viability of purely manual, human-centered strategies, most data analysis tasks are inherently exploratory (meaning the user doesn’t know all the questions they may ask of the data beforehand) and require interactive query capabilities. Visual analytics solutions that balance human and machine strengths are ideal, but achieving such a balance is not trivial. It requires judicious orchestration of human strengths, namely creativity, intuition, visual perception, and cognition, with the computational power of machines and the automated algorithms that run on them. In this talk, I will discuss modern data analysis challenges and how visual analytics tools can help solve them. To illustrate these ideas, several visual analytics systems will be described with an emphasis on the integration of human interaction, data visualization, and algorithmic guidance into flexible tools. I will also highlight the application of these tools to real-world applications in explainable AI, sensitivity analysis, multivariate analysis, and text mining. I will conclude with an overview of active and future visual analytics work.\n\nCaleb Snow, WWT\n\nKimberly Haines, WWT\n\nAIDN leverages state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to detect and respond to even the most advanced and elusive threats.

This knowledge helps AIDN adapt its defenses and protect your organization from new attack vectors.\n\nKenny Bowen, Microsoft\n\nRebeka Melber, Microsoft\n\nHistorically, the DoD SAP Community has faced a glaring challenge – one of disconnection. Over the past decade, a remarkable transformation has taken place. Thanks to a roll out of enterprise-level SAP capabilities over the past decade, connectivity has surged to unprecedented levels. These advancements have become the backbone of an entirely new era, opening doors to a consolidated stream of data that is poised to reshape the landscape of national defense. The proliferation of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) authorized for SAP data further signals the dawning of this transformative era. In the midst of this technological evolution, it’s crucial not to overlook the basics. While the buzzwords of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are reshaping our technological landscape, the foundation for these innovations must be steadfastly established. Our success hinges on getting the fundamentals right, ensuring that the most fundamental functions are in place. Collaboration emerges as the cornerstone that will pave the way towards a truly robust and effective national defense strategy. This talk will delve into the narratives of the past, the dynamic landscape of the present, and the exciting potential of the future. It encompasses communication between Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and Government, Enterprise and Mission Users, and General and Privileged Users. As we stand on the precipice of unparalleled technological advancements, it is our responsibility to steer this transformation with clarity, unity, and a shared vision. Through collaboration and convergence, we shall not only bridge past disconnects but also construct a foundation for a stronger, safer, and more technologically empowered future.\n\nJohn Loucaides, Eclypsium\n\nNot a month goes by without another deep vulnerability in CPUs, memory, BIOS, BMCs, or some other component buried inside nearly every piece of IT equipment. While these issues sound serious, the very premise of these components is to abstract away hardware details. With adversaries known to be exploiting these bugs, how can we assess vulnerabilities not mitigated by traditional endpoint security solutions?\n\nIn this talk, John will explore some of the technical issues related to cyber security of the supply chain. He will explain the most common issues, how to check for them, and how to avoid being taken by surprise. Having personally been involved in research into and coordinated disclosure of serious platform-level vulnerabilities, John will speak from personal experience (both within USG and outside) to suggest practical solutions involving both open source and commercial tools to help with this evolving problem. After discussing issues that affect firmware updates, end of life, component vulnerability scanning, integrity checks, and sanitization/destruction, attendees will discover that even though perfection is impossible, all is not lost.\n\nAndrew “AJ” Forysiak, Varonis\n\nChad Mason, Varonis\n\nThe United States faces persistent and increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber campaigns that threaten the public, private sector, and ultimately, the American people’s security and privacy. By implementing Zero Trust (ZT) across all agency systems, the U.S. government seeks to protect high-value assets, but without first building a solid foundation, any zero-trust architecture will be largely ineffective and unwieldy. Agencies must now strive to provide best-in-class zero trust-based security while satisfying compliance requirements such as EO 14028, DOE O 471.1, and OMB 22-09. Zero Trust represents a paradigm shift in how we think about protecting our assets and requires a multi-phased process to deploy successfully.\n\nDavid Metcalf, UCF\n\nAI, Blockchain, and Cybersecurity (ABC) advances are reshaping the enterprise solutions that support the warfighter. This session provides a survey to explore use cases under development at University of Central Florida’s Institute for Simulation and Training including the ARO sponsored Blockchain and Quantum Defense Simulator for multi-protocol prototyping, modeling, and testing, Army TRACRChain Blockchain for automated range data from TRACR2, and Navy Project AI Avenger analysis of AI media scrubbing tools. A review of design, standards, early results, and scalability opportunities and issues will be shared. Synergy with other projects and next steps in ABC solutions to meet emerging requirements for cross-warfighter solutions will be presented. Tangible examples include a digital twin prototype to combine operational readiness and trusted career-spanning data from recruit to retire and a quantum computing cyber awareness and AI Assurance simulation platform. Using platforms like digital twins, quantum-as-a-service, large language models-as-a-service, and advanced simulations allow Commands to explore specialized use case, protocols, standards, and scalability before committing vital resources – leveraging modeling, simulation and analysis techniques such as NSF ICorps and Hacking for Defense. Concluding remarks include discussion of methods of collaboration between military, industry, and academia to leverage public university research and other nonprofit entities.\n\nCaden Bradbury, NetApp\n\nAI models are only effective if they can be utilized in the most extreme tactic edge scenarios. (Think: in the back of a Humvee, on a Naval Ship, in a remotely operated drone, etc.) While the training of accurate models is vital, the biggest challenge in these edge environments is moving data and models to and from the tactical edge to core data center.\n\nModels must be continuously improved to be used effectively. They must perform at the highest level possible for the DoD. This is especially true in life-or-death scenarios, like automated target acquisition models. To optimize models, new data must be continuously fed to the algorithm.\n\nIn order to face the challenges posed by great power competition in the digital age, the Defense Intelligence Enterprise (DIE) must adapt its mindset and approach by embracing digital transformation. The DIE must accelerate digital transformation efforts to efficiently and effectively share data, information, and intelligence among Military Services, Defense Agencies, and Combatant Commands. A critical enabler of digital transformation is a seamless digital foundation. The Digital Foundation includes the services comprising the digital substructure that enables rapid deployment, scaling, testing, and optimization of intelligence software as an enduring capability. A digital foundation will achieve a simplified, synchronized, and integrated multi-cloud environment that can adopt innovation at scale and promote good cloud hygiene. The delivery of a Digital Foundation ensures DIE data, architecture, and infrastructure are integrated and ready to enable: Joint Warfighting Concepts, Innovation at Scale, AI, Augmentation, and Automation, and Zero Trust.\n\nAs the agency has begun its journey to transitioning to Zero Trust, we have been meeting with industry partners to discuss best practices in order to support the objectives identified in National Security Memorandum 8; Improving the Cybersecurity of National Security, Department of Defense, and Intelligence Community Systems. We have initiated a prototype effort exploring innovation opportunities in order to enhance core service offerings contributing to the Zero Trust journey. This brief will highlight areas we are collaborating with community and industry partners to adapt our environments to be positioned for supporting future mission requirements with a secure data-centric enterprise.\n\nThe ability to access data necessary to make battlefield decisions at the speed of relevance is critical to the Nation’s defense and tactical advantage. The Common Data Fabric (CDF) fast data broker is an evolution in data sharing across silos, organizational and mission boundaries making data available to any consumer machine that can enforce data policy. The CDF is a cloud-based commercial software data brokering capability that functions anywhere a connection can be established and easily integrates with existing and legacy architectures to make data available to U.S., Joint Taskforce Warfighters, US Allies and Mission Partners. CDF is deployed by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and is a foundational pillar of the data sharing vision of the Secretary of Defense as we transform the digital ecosystem towards an Enterprise Construct.\n\nCIO has applied Service Delivery Modernization to improve the customer experience. We have implemented large efforts to stand up In Person Service Centers, integrated Live Chat on the desktop, ensured our Knowledge Articles and IT Equipment Catalog are 508 compliant, Service Central automated workflows, @CIOTechTips, and small initiatives to improve IT training/lab sessions for our new officers, and play jazz music for our listeners as they wait for a technician to answer their questions. This presentation will be an opportunity to share the advanced services that have been implemented, share our journey map, and to hear from our customers in a question and answer session about what improvements they would like to see. We’ll introduce the 13 December 2021 Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service to Rebuild Trust in the Government and time permitting, explore self-help options that are available (Self-service-password-reset, go words, cross domain dialing, extension mobility, virtual desktops, etc.)\n\nIn 2018, there were more than 31,000 cybersecurity incidents affecting government agencies. In 2019, the U.S. government accounted for 5.6 percent of data breaches and 2.1 percent of all exposed records. It is imperative the US Government secures citizens’ information and federal agencies must continue to deliver services, regardless of cyber-attacks seeking disruption of those services. Fortunately, significant strides have been made to ensure just that. The Biden Administration’s budget request includes roughly $10.9 billion for civilian cybersecurity-related activities, which represents an 11% increase compared to 2022. To date, over a billion dollars has been awarded through NITAAC for cybersecurity solutions including training and awareness programs, professional and technical support services, and IT modernization for the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Agriculture, Department of Justice, and more. In fact, all aspects of cybersecurity products, services, and commoditized services are readily available under the three Best in Class GWACs that NITAAC administers: CIO-SP3, CIO-SP3 Small Business, and CIO-CS. NITAAC’s federal customers can quickly obtain cybersecurity solutions without the tedious processes under FAR Part 15; instead using FAR Part 16.5 to issue task and delivery orders quickly and easily for mission requirements. Customers also have access to NITAAC’s secure electronic government ordering system (e-GOS) to further streamline competition, management, and award. During this session, NITAAC Deputy Director Ricky Clark will provide an overview of the NITAAC GWACs and discuss how as the U.S. government continues to roll out mandatory cybersecurity standards for government agencies, NITAAC can help agency partners raise the bar for cybersecurity beyond the first line of defense.\n\nThe DIA Platform-as-a-Service (DPaaS) is an enterprise container management platform enabling application developers to build to a single standard that provides advanced and commonly used technical enterprise services necessary to decrease development time while achieving strategic competition goals.\n\nDPaaS enhances a developer’s ability to focus on functionality, enabling mission applications to be rapidly prototyped and move at the speed of mission by reducing technical overhead.\n\nThis functionality coupled with DevSecOps and the Capability Delivery Pipeline (CDP) enables applications to be developed and deployed securely, quickly, and easily no matter the location or infrastructure, freeing up development teams from tedious and complicated deployments.\n\nThe DoD and the US more generally is increasingly dependent on commercial products that provide crucial elements of our cybersecurity. Located in NSA’s Cybersecurity Collaboration Center (CCC), Standards and Certifications plays a significant role in shaping the marketplace for these products across the lifecycle of development. Through its leadership in standards bodies (ensuring that critical security requirements are built into the standards that commercial products implement) and its leadership of the National Information Assurance Partnership (which sets the testing requirements for commercial products that will protect classified information and systems), Standards and Certifications establishes a baseline that products will be built to and tested against. The placement of Standards and Certifications in the CCC enables it to bring to bear relationships with Defense Industrial Base companies as well as NSA’s enormous capacity for threat intelligence to inform and strengthen the standards and certifications mission. This talk will provide the audience with an overview of NSA’s standards and certifications programs, give examples of how the programs raise the level of security in commercial products that protect DoD systems and describe how our DoD customers can help us by providing concrete requirements that strengthen our bargaining position in standards development organizations.\n\nDevelop Network Infrastructure More Rapidly, and Operate It More Securely and Effectively.\n\nUsing model-driven DevOps and the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) paradigm, teams can develop and operate network infrastructure more quickly, consistently, and securely–growing agility, getting to market sooner, and delivering more value. This is a pragmatic talk about implementing model-driven\n\nDevOps for infrastructure. It contains insight in to lessons learned and illuminates key differences between DevOps for infrastructure and conventional application-based DevOps.\n\nWhether you are a network or cybersecurity engineer, architect, manager, or leader, this talk will help you suffuse all your network operations with greater efficiency, security, responsiveness, and resilience.\n\nThis session will describe how to leverage graph database technology to enhance analysts’ ability to fuse together and interact with extensive volumes of data from disparate intelligence feeds, both controlled/protected and publicly available/open source. These disruptive graph-based views can be integrated into most existing analysis platforms, extending and providing more immersive views and experiences with data and the ability to extract meaningful and actionable insights as data volumes increase in size and complexity.\n\nThrough these new graph database views, analysts interact with data represented by nodes and edges. This flexible data architecture allows for rapid filtering of data layers, producing a truly immersive environment filled with color, highlighting, line thickness, borders, icons, badges, and more, allowing the analyst to fully leverage graph database node and edge methodology. These visual cues help the analyst to find and link critical pieces of data together, providing highly reliable information that the analyst uses to see data more clearly, make more accurate predictions, and be confident in their decision-making.\n\nJoin the DIA Chief Information Officer, Mr. Doug Cossa, as he moderates a discussion on the future of CIO considering the ever-evolving landscape of Information Technology. Panel members will feature junior civilian personnel across DIA CIO—the forces on the ground implementing DIA CIO’s key initiatives and riding the waves of the latest technological advancements. Through this session, attendees will gain a better understanding of DIA CIO’s current successes and challenges from the action officer viewpoint. Further, attendees will gain insight into how the Intelligence Community and Department of Defense must continue to evolve to enable mission.\n\nThe IC treats data and software as strategic assets. The IC transcends strategic competitors through innovation, adaptation, and collaboration by facilitating a shared environment for software modernization. We set the foundation for success via common software environments, which provides a mature, versatile DevSecOps environment for internal and external teams. This game-changing tool suite and associated approach provides the fastest way to deliver mission-specific software — independent of the underlying data and infrastructure. It enables teams to have quick delivery to operations, security early on, and the benefit of code sharing and reuse. This presentation will provide an overview of that ecosystem and will focus on how:\n\nInternal and external DoD and IC teams are provided with:\n\nIndustry leading DevSecOps capabilities.\n\nParity of tools on all security domains.\n\nLow to high automated movement of code and artifacts.\n\nMaturity of capabilities\n\nHow to onboard:\n\nCompletion of the external team questionnaire hosted on Intelink at https://go.intelink.gov/ku5ZQH2\n\nCoordination of a service agreement and funding.\n\nChallenges\n\nReciprocity\n\nPeople/Process\n\nThe ongoing strategic power competition along with the adversarial implementation of innovative technology, such as Artificial intelligence (AI), has emphasized the need for increased awareness and strategic warning in nearly every warfighting domain. Increased use of this technology provides a unique challenge and strategic avenue for the U.S. Intelligence Community and its partners as they seek to maintain their competitive edge in the era of near-peer adversary competition.\n\nThis research project addresses Edge AI technology affecting the U.S. strategic defense posture in the Space Domain. The use of this dynamic technology in one of the most influential and uncharted mission spaces lends an insightful discussion on the cascading effects of AI advancement. This project has the potential to lend itself to further engagement with the private sector, as well as future substantive research projects.\n\nTo address our methodology, we will divide this research into a discussion on the existing technologies that would be impacted given the event of a flash war in space. Discussion on the interconnectivity and vulnerabilities of these systems, the way Edge AI would be able to potentially augment or damage the intended functionality of these systems, as well as the legal ramifications for the use of edge AI in the space domain. It would include communications satellites, GEOINT constellations, ground nodes, and cloud data storage.\n\nIt is important to note that though policy capabilities and funding specific to each military branch are important considerations regarding AI employment within the Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) architecture, expanding these topics in detail would extend beyond the scope of our project.\n\nFor a number of years, strategic competitors have exploited and subverted vulnerabilities in the DoD/IC supply chain. These adversarial efforts, which includes stealing U.S. intellectual property, results in decreased confidence in securing critical solutions, services and products delivered to the DoD. Contractor facilities supporting hardware/software design, development, and integration are frequently targeted as cyber pathways to access, steal, alter, or destroy system functionality. Since malfeasant activities can compromise government programs or fielded systems, DIA continues to evaluate and implement efforts to harden its supply chain commensurate with the risk to national security. Within DIA’s implementation of the Risk Management Framework, DIA has aligned cyber supply chain risk management with the acquisition process and engineering strategies. These efforts enable DIA to create a framework for cybersecurity due diligence – influencing the Intelligence Advantage.\n\nThis session will describe and clarify DIA’s implementation of the DoD/IC supply chain risk management program. Specifically, the briefers will discuss how Cyber supply chain risk management has been integrated within cybersecurity, engineering, and DIA’s acquisition strategy. Both internal and external customers will also obtain knowledge of: (1) How to obtain DIA’s SCRM Services, and (2) best practices to actively and pre-emptively address supply chain threats.\n\nWhile detailed information would normally be provided on a need-to-know basis at classified levels, our session will not cover any details that would expose classified information. Since this conference is unclassified, we are only going to speak to large trends, concepts, and generic activities. There will not be any details provided to attendees about any particular agency’s status, and we will not be discussing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries.\n\nService mesh can play an important role providing a zero-trust networking foundation, however, it also poses a few operational and security challenges. First, in current implementations, a service mesh is opt-in by deploying a sidecar process with the secured resource. Second, tying infrastructure components into application deployments makes it more difficult to patch and upgrade when vulnerabilities are discovered. Lastly, current service mesh implementations can be difficult to extend to existing workloads. In this talk, we dive into an “ambient” service mesh that runs without sidecars and addresses these previous issues without trading off zero-trust properties.\n\nThe Public Sector must deliver on ever-expanding missions while battling against siloed legacy applications and vast, untold volumes of information. This session will explore how Defense Logistics Agency, a 26,000-person combat support agency for the U.S. Department of Defense, has treated AI-powered content management as a strategic tool to save time and energy to supply the warfighter. Learn how DLA has gained an information advantage in supplying the U.S. military with its equipment needs.\n\nTopics covered will include military moves, supply chain and audit readiness, content services, intelligent capture, password complexities, and unstructured content.\n\nEnabling classified communications and situational awareness can be difficult and expensive for deployed, remote, collaborative, and contingency use cases.\n\nFollowing guidelines from NSA’s Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) program can overcome many challenges associated with legacy systems for classified communications and can help organizations benefit from the fast pace of commercial innovation in mobile devices.\n\nUsing CSfC, organizations have options for enabling executive mobility and remote work (e.g., using laptops and smartphones), site-to-site extensions of classified networks (e.g., for remote tactical teams, branch offices, home offices, or multi-building campuses), and classified campus-area Wi-Fi networks.\n\nThis session covers how to design and deploy systems conformant to the CSfC program and illustrates specific real-world examples of systems in use today for federal enterprise and tactical use cases. This session also covers emerging technologies and solutions that address the newly updated CSfC requirements such as continuous monitoring, as well as complexity challenges inherent in these solutions.\n\nThe session will provide insight into the Intelligence Community’s IT and mission needs. Industry attendees will learn how to utilize the Joint Architecture Reference Model (JARM) to address requirements on IC elements acquisitions. IC attendees will learn how to align priorities into mission resource needs across the Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) moving down from their strategy to define capabilities and their enabling technical services. The session will demonstrate how the JARM can be utilized to make invest/divest decisions, develop IC Service Provider catalogs, and discover IC services. JARM supported capability gap analysis will also be demonstrated by using heat maps to align investment to capability and service needs. DoD attendees will learn how to define their architecture to integrate with the IC.\n\nThe US Army National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) is exercising a portfolio-based approach to transition its mission capabilities to the cloud through rationalization, integration, and modernization. A key strategic focus is human capital and talent management that holistically invests in its workforce shifting from declining IT responsibilities to focus on emerging skills and disciplines such as cloud computing, data engineering and modern application development. This briefing will describe the human capital and talent management strategy and implementation plan to drive operational readiness of its IT workforce to meet the current and future demands of the NGIC mission. This will also include a demonstration of the tooling used to visualize the IT workforce’s skills and disciplines mapped to mission needs and capacity.\n\nThe space domain requires analysis in four dimensions (x, y, z, t). Unlike the other warfighting domains, space planning, wargaming, and decision making must be done using tools capable of multi-dimensional visualization and simulation of near-Earth orbits (e.g., Analytical Graphics/Ansys Incorporated Systems Tool Kit, or STK). Such tools have proliferated over the last decade across a vast array of government and non-government space users. Much like the Microsoft Office 365 suite of productivity tools, or Adobe’s Acrobat/Creative Suite, Systems Tool Kit has become the modeling and simulation software of choice for those involved in the national security space arena. In the area of orbital warfare training specifically, STK is used an instructional aid to make tangible the realities of space flight, systems engineering, astrodynamics, and orbit propagation. Organizations like the US Space Force’s National Security Space Institute, US Space Command, rely on STK to perform computations and analyses to inform real-world decision making during critical moments of space launch, orbit maneuver determination, and other activities in space. In this regard, modeling and simulation technologies for the space domain have become as ubiquitous as Microsoft-type productivity software deployed on a standard desktop configuration. Therefore, STK or other software tools like it, must be treated as a productivity tool and not as a special-use case to be found in a high-performance computational center or battle lab. Licensing arrangements, deployable efficiency, and proliferation must continue to be made advantageous to the average space user.\n\nAs part of NGA’s greater multi-tier Edge Strategy, the JREN is being deployed to Combatant Commands. This highly scalable capability is designed to position significant storage, compute, transport bandwidth, and applications closer to the Tactical edge. JREN will support expanding Department of Defense, Intelligence Community and Coalition customer requirements with content specific to their area of operations, GEOINT/partner applications and high-performance compute. Design considerations include: increased resiliency in Denied, Degraded, Intermittent, Limited (DDIL) communications environments via direct satellite downlink, reduced transport latency, and the use of the NGA CORE software development method to develop, deploy, and sustain modern GEOINT software. All designed to facilitate the movement of critical intelligence and data sharing.\n\nDeployment has started at USINDOPACOM with additional COCOMs receiving delivery in the upcoming outyears.\n\nWith more than 15% of the world’s population experiencing some form of disability, DIA understands accessibility is more than an adherence to Section 508 standards. It’s about inclusive design – developing digital solutions to meet a broad spectrum of intersectional needs, perspectives, and behaviors, rather than solely creating accommodations for specific disabilities. This presentation will describe resourceful ways DIA is expanding its IT accessibility expertise across the Enterprise and how to utilize collaborations with Industry to develop innovative solutions like a speech recognition application for its Deaf and Hard of Hearing community. This presentation will share DIA’s plan to integrate accessibility and inclusivity into its software development lifecycle rather than adding it on as an afterthought.\n\nThe IC Security Coordination Center (SCC) is the Federal Cybersecurity Center for the IC and coordinates the integrated defense of the IC Information Environment (IC IE) with IC elements, DoD, and other U.S. Government departments and agencies. Working with the other defense-oriented Federal Cyber Centers—the Joint Force Headquarters (JFHQ) Department of Defense Intranet Information Network (DoDIIN) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)—the IC SCC facilitates accelerated detection and mitigation of security threats and vulnerabilities across the IC by providing situational awareness and incident case management within the shared IT environment.\n\nIn FY ’23 the IC SCC is enabling a better IC cyber defense posture through the procurement of IC-wide enterprise licenses of commercial Cyber Threat Intelligence from multiple vendors, an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) pilot program for IC-wide adoption, and an enhanced patch repository for prioritizing patch management and driving down shared risk across the enterprise. Join us as we detail these initiatives and how they can help secure your environment!\n\nThe session will provide an opportunity to hear from Chief Architects from NRO, NSA, NGA, DHS Coast Guard, DNI, and DoD. The panel will be hosted by the Intelligence Community Chief Information Office (IC CIO), Architecture and Integration Group (AIG). The panelists will respond to questions on how they are shaping their agency’s technology roadmap and how they coordinate and drive mission integration within their element and across the IC and DoD. Attendees will gain understanding of programs and initiatives across the IC that are modernizing systems that support the intelligence lifecycle and improve integration. The panel will leave the attendees with a better understanding of the role of the Chief Architect within each represented organization.\n\nAt DoDIIS 2021, the Army Military Intelligence (MI) Cloud Computing Service Provider (AC2SP) briefed the mission outcomes realized by leveraging its cloud-based Data Science Environment (DSE) to rapidly respond to a mission requirement in less than two weeks from problem to solution. This briefing will build upon the prior successes and describe the AC2SP Data Science Product Line to include its core product offerings and underlying cloud services supporting Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) to enable multi-tenancy and respond to the variability in data science requirements across the Army Intelligence and Security Enterprise and multiple operational networks.\n\nWe hear that promoting and maintaining a healthy work environment is important. Cyber and physical security threats from trusted insiders are on the rise and there is evidence that what happens in the workplace impacts motivation for and mitigation of possible attacks. This interactive presentation introduces research and case studies to highlight the complex role the work environment and the resulting work culture play in deterring and mitigating risks that can lead to attacks that harm national security and result in loss or degradation of vital resources and capabilities. The presentation includes promising practices for those who want to improve their respective work environments and reminders for those already doing the work. The topic offers an opportunity to engage, reflect and specific examples of ways to innovate, adapt and collaborate to improve and protect work settings that are increasingly targeted by our adversaries.\n\nTechnological innovation is disrupting societies with serious implications for the era of Strategic Competition. AI is rapidly emerging as a powerful technology with the ability to illuminate tactical and strategic advantages against our competitors. Federal mandates, such as the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence’s mandate that all Intelligence Community (IC) and Department of Defense (DoD) entities be AI-Ready by 2025, reinforce the urgency and imperative of leveraging AI.\n\nIn response to this mandate, DIA’s Chief Technology Office (CTO) was named as the office of primary responsibility for DIA Strategy Line of Effort (LOE) 2.9 – AI Readiness, outlining how the Agency can reach AI readiness, AI competitiveness, and AI maturity. The purpose of LOE 2.9 Is to transform culture and capabilities, creating an AI ready workforce that enables DIA officers and organizations to innovate, incorporate and advance AI throughout Agency missions and processes to meet the demands of Strategic Competition and obtain data driven dominance. CTO is collaborating with partners across industry, academia, IC, DoD, and Five Eye (FVEY) to create a strategy that will ensure we meet this purpose.\n\nLearn about the DIA AI Strategy goals and objectives and the key pillars for transforming DIA into an AI Ready organization.\n\nThe DIA Data Hub’s (DDH) objective is to offer an Agency data platform that ensures easy discovery of and secure, automated access to DIA data assets. The DDH concept will modernize the DIA’s data handling, storage, and delivery by using best-of-breed technology and treating data as an enterprise-wide asset. DDH will both provide a place for new data to reside, as well as free existing data from process and technologically driven silos. By treating data as an enterprise-wide asset, it will give mission and business analysts the full range of information necessary to provide insights to stakeholders ranging from the warfighter all the way to congress. DDH’s strategy is to meet customers where they are, enabling customers to keep data and services where they need it. This capability will allow data scientists to comingle data to derive new insights, and let developers quickly build applications by leveraging DDH as their data store. When data is treated as an asset, it opens the door to new efficiencies, insights, and capabilities. By providing all DIA users the data they need, DDH creates a foundational capability that will be key to maintaining a strategic and competitive advantage over our adversaries.\n\nThe Transport Services Directorate Senior Technologist at the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) provides a strategic outlay of future enabling technologies, initiatives and capabilities that will deliver the next generation of global resilient communications capabilities to the warfighter. He will provide a strategic roadmap on the DISN core global transport evolution – from the barriers, to modernization areas, and information sharing approaches – to deliver a no-fail long haul transport architecture for DoD, Intelligence Community, US and Allied Government capabilities. Additional discussion on the need for joint mission integration to ensure the operational status of the underlying environments can be seamlessly integrated with the different domain owners, such as DIA, to assure end-to-end mission delivery and performance.\n\nUnderstanding Artificial Intelligence in IT Operations (AIOps) can be a daunting task given the various definitions of the term. IT Operations teams are seeking the advantages of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to unlock better decision-making and to drive automation and self-healing to support mission essential applications. AIOps is not a single product, rather a journey where key components intersect and leverage machine intelligence and speed to drive outcomes. Join Lee Koepping from ScienceLogic as he de-constructs the essential elements of AIOps and how context driven observability and automated workflows can accelerate mission results to optimize IT service delivery.\n\nFor years, operations squadrons across the globe used whiteboards and printed crew binders to execute global missions. A handful of aircrew members teamed up with Platform One to revolutionize the way crew management and distributed operations are done using a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution hardened and hosted on government servers. We discovered a fast and secure way to pass mission data from operations centers to crew members enhancing safety and mission velocity. This collaborative command and control flow enabled the early recognition of issues allowing us to maximize crew effectiveness on the road. The team used a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant to work with Mattermost to make defense enhancements focused on Air Operations Center workflows and needs. We realized that these types of collaborative capabilities allowed us to build a shared reality outside of our silos and solve issues before they occurred. This capability was demonstrated during the Kabul evac where stage managers took full advantage of the ability to self-organize and collaborate during the Kabul evac enabling the largest Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) in U.S. history. This talk gives an in-depth look at how innovation and technology laid the ground work for success.\n\nThis talk will present an overview of DNS cyber attacks over the past several years by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and how the types of attacks and mitigations have evolved over time. It will discuss why DNS continues to be a commonly used vector for adversaries and how cyber defenders can innovative to strategically defend against the most sophisticated APT using complex DNS techniques for malicious activity.\n\nAs strategic competitors continue to adopt AI as a disruptive technology used to advance warfighting and intelligence gathering capabilities, it is imperative that the defense community come together to develop solutions for leveraging human-machine teaming to achieve decision advantage and dominate our strategic competitors. This panel will address how the Intelligence Community (IC) and Department of Defense (DoD) utilizes AI to continue to revolutionize the way we maintain strategic and tactical advantage in an era of Strategic Competition. Attendees will hear from AI experts spearheading efforts within their agencies to adopt AI as a means to outpace our strategic competitors and ultimately prevent and decisively win wars. Agencies include: the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office. This panel will be moderated by DIA’s Chief Technology Officer and AI Champion.\n\nMany compliance officers inherit the negative reputation of, “wearing the black hat,” generating fear of involving them early and often in discussing current architecture, planning new infrastructure, or establishing programs. Strategic competition requires compliance officers and programs to participate early in the planning processes to streamline development and thereby ensure a reduction in incidents. Compliance officers must pursue opportunities to evolve their reputation and work with innovation leaders in a collaborative relationship that shifts outcomes to the benefit of the community, government, foreign partners, and taxpayers.\n\n"
