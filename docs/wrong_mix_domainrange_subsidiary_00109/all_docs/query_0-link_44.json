Implementing and managing multiple leading edge IT systems including IBM, Microsoft, Apple, Huawei, Cisco, VMware, and particularly passionate about imparting knowledge onto others to learn new ways of working. Michelle arrived back in UK in 2016 and started working as an Admissions Officer for a local Independent school, whilst studying for a degree in Human Resource Management. Michelle is originally from Bristol, but parents are Spanish so grew up bilingual. Free time is spent with family and friends, and playing netball."
