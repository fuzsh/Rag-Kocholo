        "text": "An Initial Consultation is an information gathering appointment and tool for CAPS Mental Health Clinicians to match students to the appropriate options for care.\n\nInitial Consultations are offered at varied times, Monday through Friday. Students will need to fill out required paperwork and then will meet with a clinician for approximately 30-minutes.\n\nDuring the appointment, you and a CAPS mental health clinician will talk about the nature of your concerns, existing coping skills, additional resources/strategies and our services. From there, you and your CAPS mental health clinician will determine the most appropriate next steps based on CAPS Care Matching Model.\n\nThese might include any combination of referrals to a campus resource, referral to groups/workshops, counseling services, psychiatric services, case management, or referral to a community provider.\n\nInitial Consultations: Stop by CAPS for a first come, first serve, walk-in consultation Monday - Thursday from 8:30am-10am & 1pm-3pm; Friday from 9am-10am & 1pm-3pm. Call 479-575-5276 if you have questions.\n\nReturning clients:You may be asked to return through an initial consultation depending on when you were last seen at CAPS. Call 479-575-5276 and inform the front office staff of your situation; they will schedule the appropriate appointment.\n\nImportant: Throughout the semester, CAPS at times may have very limited availability for on-going individual counseling. CAPS Mental Health Clinicians will partner with you to identify the most appropriate care and resources based on the CAPS Care Matching Model. CAPS offers several resources in addition to individual counseling, such as groups, workshops, outreach, assistance connecting to community providers and/or other campus support, etc.\n\n*Please let our staff know if you would like your Initial Consultation to be with a Person of Color or with someone who speaks Spanish."
