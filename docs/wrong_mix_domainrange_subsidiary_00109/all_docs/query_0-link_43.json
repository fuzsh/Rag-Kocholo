        "text": "Collection and Billing System\n\nOn September 1 2004, the Bureau of Land Management's Collection and Billing System, which was developed by Advanced DataTools in October 1999, hit an important milestone when it reached the $1 billion mark in deposits for FY2004. The Bureau of Land Management is one of the largest sources of revenue for the US Federal Government. Advanced DataTools teamed up with BLM personnel to develop the web-based collection and billing transaction system, which allows BLM to enter every dollar collected into one centralized system.\n\nManagement Information System Finalist for the President's Quality Award Program\n\nIn 2002, the Bureau of Land Management’s Management Information System was selected as one of 7 Finalists out of 100 for President [Bush]’s Quality Award Program. Advanced DataTools provided the software design, development, and implementation consulting support to build the IBM Informix and web-based financial MIS. The MIS data warehouse provides reports to over 7,000 program staff, financial analysts, and budget staff in 300+ field offices.\n\nBudget Planning System\n\nIn 2002, the Bureau of Land Management’s Budget Planning System (BPS) was designed to streamline the BLM’s budget process and enable them to compete effectively for a budget that would support their programs and goals. Advanced DataTools developed BPS in two phases."
