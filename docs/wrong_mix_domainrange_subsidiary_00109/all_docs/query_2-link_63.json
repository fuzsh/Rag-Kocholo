        "text": "Dr. Lorne Walker enjoys getting to know his patients and their families, so they can work together to find the best approach for each child.\n\nDr. Walker is a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases, or illnesses in children from viruses, bacteria and other causes. He often works with children who have weak immune systems. Cancer treatment, organ transplant or genetic differences can harm children’s natural defenses to disease. When a child’s immune system isn’t working well, there is higher risk for rare or severe infections. Dr. Walker uses his knowledge and training to help children cope with these illnesses.\n\nAway from work, Dr. Walker spends time with his spouse and two children. He enjoys tending his backyard vegetable garden and cooking. Dr. Walker and his family like to explore camping and hiking spots in and around Oregon.\n\nBefore scheduling your appointment, we recommend you contact your insurance company to verify that the OHSU Health location or provider you plan to visit is included in your network. Your insurance company will also be able to inform you of any copayments, co–insurance, or deductibles that will be your responsibility. If you proceed in scheduling an appointment and your health insurance benefits do not participate with OHSU providers, your out of pocket liability may be higher. Visit the billing and insurance section of our site for more information."
