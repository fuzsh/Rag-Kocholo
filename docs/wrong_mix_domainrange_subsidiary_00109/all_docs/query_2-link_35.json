        "text": "Selecting a Subcommittee\n\nOverview\n\nCHI 2022 anticipates more than 3,000 Papers submissions. The review process needs to handle this load while also providing high-quality reviews, which requires that each submission is handled by an expert Associate Chair (AC) who can recruit expert reviewers. The organization of the CHI program committee into topical subcommittees helps achieve this. See the description of the Papers review process for a detailed explanation of the responsibilities of the ACs and Subcommittee Chairs (SCs).\n\nAuthors should examine what constitutes a contribution to SIGCHI and recognize that there are many different types of contribution possible for a SIGCHI paper.\n\nNotes on Composition of Subcommittees\n\nOnce abstracts are submitted, individual subcommittees may grow or shrink based on the number of probable papers for that subcommittee. As in previous years, the paper chairs will be undertaking a survey to detail the diversity for each subcommittee. Please see, for example, this blog post on Diversity of the Program Committee for CHI 2020 which was published in July 2019.\n\nAuthors are required to suggest a subcommittee to review your submission. This page provides guidance on choosing the appropriate subcommittees for your submission.\n\nList of the Subcommittees\n\nSixteen subcommittees are listed and described below. Each has a title, short description, and an indication of who will Chair and serve on the subcommittee and if a subcommittee consists of multiple tracks. Subcommittees have been constructed with an eye to maintaining logically coherent clusters of topics.\n\nUser Experience and Usability\n\nSpecific Applications Areas\n\nLearning, Education, and Families\n\nInteraction Beyond the Individual\n\nGames and Play\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\nVisualization\n\nHealth\n\nAccessibility and Aging\n\nDesign\n\nBuilding Devices: Hardware, Materials, and Fabrication\n\nInteracting with Devices: Interaction Techniques & Modalities\n\nBlending Interaction: Engineering Interactive Systems & Tools\n\nUnderstanding People: Theory, Concepts, and Methods\n\nCritical Computing, Sustainability, and Social Justice\n\nComputational Interaction\n\nSubcommittee Selection Process\n\nWhen you submit a Paper, you can designate up to two appropriate subcommittees for your submission. In the vast majority of cases, the subcommittee that will review your submission is one of the two subcommittees that you proposed. In cases where the Papers Chairs and/or Subcommittee Chairs recognize that your submission will be reviewed more thoroughly in another subcommittee, a submission may be transferred from one subcommittee to another. If a submission is transferred to another subcommittee, this will happen in the first week of the process, before reviewers are assigned; i.e., transferring will not affect a submission’s review process, it will only ensure that it receives the most complete, fair set of reviews.\n\nBelow, you will see a list of subcommittees and descriptions of the topics they are covering, the name of each SC, and the names of the ACs serving on each subcommittee. It is your responsibility to select the subcommittee that best matches the expertise needed to assess your research and that you believe will most fully appreciate your contribution to the field of HCI.\n\nCHI has traditionally supported diverse and interdisciplinary work and continues to expand into new topics not previously explored. We recognize that as a result, you may find more than two subcommittees which are plausible matches for your work. However, for a number of reasons, it will be necessary for you to select no more than two target subcommittees, and you should strive to find the best matches based on what you think is the main contribution of your submission (examples of papers that are considered good matches are linked below for each subcommittee). You can also email the SCs for guidance if you are unsure (an email alias is provided below for each set of SCs).\n\nNote that the scope of each subcommittee is not rigidly defined. Each has a broad mandate, and most subcommittees cover a collection of different topics. Further, SCs and ACs are all seasoned researchers, experienced with program committee review work, and each is committed to a process which seeks to assign each paper reviewers who are true experts in whatever the subject matter of the paper is. ACs recognize that many papers, or perhaps even most papers, will not perfectly fit the definition of their subcommittee’s scope. Consequently, papers will not be penalized or downgraded because they do not align perfectly with a particular subcommittee. Interdisciplinary, multi-topic, and cross-topic papers are encouraged and will be carefully and professionally judged by all subcommittees.\n\nIn making a subcommittee choice you should make careful consideration of what the most central and salient contribution of your work is, even if there are several different contributions. As an example, let’s say you are writing a paper about Ergonomic Business Practices for the Elderly using Novel Input Devices. Perhaps this is a very new topic. It covers a lot of ground. It’s not an exact fit for any of the subcommittees, but several choices are plausible. To choose between them, you need to make a reasoned decision about the core contributions of your work. Should it be evaluated in terms of the usage context for the target user community? The novel methodology developed for your study? The system and interaction techniques you have developed? Each of these evaluation criteria may partially apply, but try to consider which is most central and which you most want to highlight for your readers. Also look at the subcommittees, the people who will serve on them, and the kind of work they have been associated with in the past. Even if there are several subcommittees that could offer fair and expert assessments of this work, go with the one that really fits the most important and novel contributions of your paper. That committee will be in the best position to offer constructive and expert review feedback on the contributions of your research.\n\nEach subcommittee description also links to several recent CHI papers that the SCs feel are good examples of papers that fit the scope of that subcommittee. Please look at these examples as a way to decide on the best subcommittee for your paper – but remember that these are just a few examples, and do not specify the full range of topics that would fit with any subcommittee.\n\nUser Experience and Usability\n\nThis subcommittee is suitable for papers that extend the knowledge, practices, methods, components, and tools that make technology more useful, usable, and desirable. Successful papers will present results, practical approaches, tools, technologies, and research methods that demonstrably advance our understanding, design, and evaluation of user experience and/or usability. The focus is on usability and user experience of widely used technologies with contributions being judged substantially on the basis of their demonstrable potential for effective reuse and applicability across a range of application domains or across a range of design, research, and user communities.\n\nSubcommittee Chairs\n\nLynne Baillie, Heriot-Watt University\n\nMagy Seif El-Nasr, University of California at Santa Cruz\n\nEffie Law, University of Leicester\n\nEduardo Velloso, University of Melbourne\n\nContact: sc.ux@chi2022.acm.org\n\nSubcommittee Chairs’ Assistants\n\nErica Kleinman, University of California at Santa Cruz\n\nQiushi Zhou, The University of Melbourne\n\nAssociate Chairs\n\nAbdallah El Ali, Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), Amsterdam\n\nAhmed Sabbir Arif, University of California, Merced\n\nLonni Besancon, Monash University\n\nMark Billinghurst, University of South Australia\n\nMax Birk, Eindhoven Unversity of Technology\n\nDaniel Buschek, University of Bayreuth, Germany\n\nClara Caldeira, Indiana University Bloomington\n\nElin Carstendottir, University of California at Santa Cruz\n\nJinghui Cheng, Polytechnique Montreal\n\nErin Cherry, Northrop Grumman Mission Systems\n\nTanja Döring, University of Bremen\n\nJennifer Ferreira, Victoria University of Wellington\n\nAlisa Frik, Berkeley\n\nPeter Frohlich, AIT\n\nMarkus Funk, Cerence GmbH\n\nJan Gugenheimer, IP-Paris (Telecom-Paris)\n\nBenjamin Hanrahan, Pennsylvania State University\n\nNyi Nyi Htun, KU Leuven\n\nStephen Intille, Northeastern University\n\nHans-Christian Jetter, University of Lübeck\n\nAnirudha Joshi, IIT Bombay\n\nAuk Kim, Kangwon National University\n\nThomas Kosch, TU Darmstadt\n\nSandeep Kaur Kuttal, University of Tulsa\n\nDanielle Lottridge, University of Auckland\n\nAndres Lucero, Aalto University\n\nKarola Marky, University of Glasgow\n\nAlexander Meschtscherjakov, University of Salzburg\n\nNicholas Micallef, New York University\n\nKen Pfeuffer, Aarhus University\n\nClaudio Pinhanez, IBM Research\n\nHenning Pohl, University of Copenhagen\n\nAndreas Riener, TH Ingolstadt\n\nSabirat Rubya, Marquette University\n\nEnrico Rukzio, University of Ulm\n\nZhanna Sarsenbayeva, University of Melbourne\n\nMartin Schmitz, TU Darmstadt\n\nAneesha Singh, University College London\n\nBenjamin Tag, University of Melbourne\n\nJoe Tulio, Facebook\n\nTeija Vainio, Aalto University\n\nElizabeth Veinott, Michigan Technological University\n\nAlex C.

Accessibility papers are those that deal with technology design for or use by people with disabilities including sensory, motor, and cognitive impairments. Aging papers are broadly categorized as those dealing with technology design for or use by people in the later stages of life. Relationships with technology are complex and multifaceted; we welcome contributions across a range of topics aimed at benefiting relevant stakeholder groups and not solely limited to concerns of making technology accessible. Note that if your paper primarily concerns interactions with health data or with healthcare providers, then the Health subcommittee is probably a better fit, whereas papers reflecting on how technologies are used and/or designing interfaces and interactions suited to specific needs are better suited for this subcommittee. We strongly suggest that authors review this Accessible Writing Guide in order to adopt a writing style that refers to stakeholder groups using appropriate terminology. Submissions to this subcommittee will be evaluated in part based on their inclusion of and potential impact on their target user groups and other stakeholders. This subcommittee balances the rigor required in all CHI submissions with awareness of the challenges of conducting research in these important areas. This subcommittee welcomes all contributions related to accessibility, and aging, including empirical, theoretical, conceptual, methodological, design, and systems contributions.\n\nSubcommittee Chairs\n\nCosmin Munteanu, University of Toronto Mississauga\n\nAisling Kelliher, Virginia Tech\n\nContact: sc.access@chi2022.acm.org\n\nAssociate Chairs\n\nVero Vanden Abeele, KU Leuven\n\nDragan Ahmetovic, University of Milan\n\nJosep Blat, Universitat Pompeu Fabra\n\nDanielle Bragg, Microsoft Research\n\nRobin Brewer, University of Michigan\n\nMichael Crabb, University of Dundee\n\nMingming Fan, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\n\nBenjamin Gorman, Bournemouth University\n\nAnhong Guo, University of Michigan\n\nFoad Hamidi, University of Maryland\n\nYasamin Heshmat, Electronic Arts\n\nWilko Heuten, OFFIS Institute for IT\n\nSooyeon Lee, Rochester Institute of Technology\n\nWanda Li, University of Guelph\n\nKathleen McCoy, University of Delaware\n\nTimothy Neate, King’s College London\n\nVania Neris, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Brazil\n\nEmma Nicol, University of Strathclyde\n\nTeresa K.

Papers submitted here include novel designs of interactive products, services, or systems that advance the state of the art; creation and evaluation of new design tools, processes, methods, or principles, including those that explore alternatives to scientistic ways of knowing; work that expands the scope of design thinking within HCI research or practice; work that applies perspectives from other disciplines to inspire or to critique the design of interactive things; or work that advances knowledge on the human activity of design as it relates to HCI research or practice. We particularly encourage contributions of new designs that broaden the boundaries of interaction design and promote new aesthetic and sociocultural possibilities. Examples of design approaches include : industrial/product design, visual/information design, participatory design, user-centered design, interaction design, user interface design, user experience design, service design, critical design, and design fictions. Finally, this committee encourages submission of work that addresses design research issues such as aesthetics, values, effects (such as emotion), methods, practices, critique, constructive design research, and design theory.\n\nSubcommittee Chairs\n\nChristopher LeDantec, Georgia Tech\n\nAnna Vallgårda, IT University of Copenhagen\n\nDaniela Petrelli, Sheffield Hallam University\n\nMelanie Feinberg, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nContact: sc.design@chi2022.acm.org\n\nSubcommittee Chairs’ Assistants\n\nAdriana Alvarado Garcia, Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nAlyssa Rumsey, Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nAssociate Chairs\n\nSarah Fdili Alaoui, LRI-Université Paris-Sud 11\n\nAmid Ayobi, University of Bristol\n\nCynthia Bennett, Carnegie Mellon University\n\nMaria Menendez Blanco, University of Bozen-Bolzano\n\nMiguel Bruns, Eindhoven University\n\nDavid Chatting, Goldsmiths\n\nFranceli Cibrian, Chapman University\n\nEric Corbett, New York University\n\nAykut Coskun, Koc University\n\nChris Elsden, Edinburgh University\n\nJonas Fritsch, IT University of Copenhagen\n\nVerena Fuchsberger, University of Salzburg\n\nMaliheh Ghajargar, Malmø University\n\nElisa Giaccardi, Delft University of Technology\n\nColin Gray, Purdue\n\nIan Gwilt, University of South Australia\n\nMarius Hoggenmueller, University of Sydney\n\nNoura Howell, Georgia Tech\n\nWoodrow Winchester III, University of Maryland Baltimore County\n\nHeekyoung Jung, University of Cincinnati\n\nCindy (Hsin-Liu) Kao, Cornell University\n\nRohit Ashok Khot, RMIT University\n\nLaura Maye, University College Cork\n\nTroy Nachtigall, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences\n\nValentina Nisi, University of Madeira\n\nWill Odom, Simon Fraser\n\nHyunjoo Oh, Georgia Tech\n\nParinya Punpongsanon, Osaka University\n\nAmon Rapp, University of Turin\n\nMaria Rosseou, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens\n\nCorina Sas, Lancaster University\n\nEunice Sati, UX Indonesia\n\nKarin Slegers, Tilburg University\n\nDavide Spallazzo, Politecnico di Milano\n\nPaul Strohmeier, Saarbrücken University\n\nJosh (Adi) Tedjasaputra, UX Indonesia\n\nCesar Torres, University of Texas at Arlington\n\nDaisuke Uriu, Tokyo University\n\nNervo Verdezoto, Cardiff University\n\nVasilis Vlachokyriakos, Newcastle University\n\nHeike Winschiers-Theophilus, Namibia University of Science and Technology\n\nJohanna Ylipulli, Aalto University\n\nClement Zheng, National University of Singapore\n\nExample Papers\n\nUnderstanding Everyday Experiences of Reminiscence for People with Blindness: Practices, Tensions and Probing New Design Possibilities\n\nProceed with Care: Reimagining Home IoT Through a Care Perspective\n\nDesigning Menstrual Technologies with Adolescents\n\nSketching NLP: A Case Study of Exploring the Right Things To Design with Language Intelligence\n\nThe SelfReflector: Design, IoT and the High Street\n\nFrom Research Prototype to Research Product\n\nIndoor Weather Stations: Investigating a Ludic Approach to Environmental HCI through Batch Prototyping\n\nField Trial of Tiramisu: Crowd-Sourcing Bus Arrival Times to Spur Co-Design\n\nMaking Multiple Uses of the Obscura 1C Digital Camera: Reflecting on the Design, Production, Packaging and Distribution of a Counterfunctional Device\n\nArtful Systems in the Home\n\nSabbath Day Home Automation: It’s Like Mixing Technology and Religion\n\nEmpathy and Experience in HCI\n\nWhat Should We Expect from Research Through Design?\n\nResearch Through Design as a Method for interaction Design Research in HCI\n\nOn Looking at the Vagina through Labella\n\nSomaesthetic Appreciation Design\n\nMonadic Exploration: Seeing the Whole Through Its Parts\n\nGenerating Implications for Design Through Design Research\n\nDesign Patterns for Exploring and Prototyping Human-Robot Interactions\n\nMaking Public Things: How HCI Design Can Express matters of Concern\n\nDo-it-Yourself Cellphones: An Investigation into the Possibilities and Limits of High-Tech DIY\n\nStay on the Boundary: Artifact Analysis Exploring Researcher and User Framing of Robot Design\n\nDIYbio Things: Open Source Biology Tools as Platforms for Hybrid Knowledge Production and Scientific Participation\n\nSnot, Sweat, Pain, Mud, and Snow – Performance and Experience in the Use of Sports Watches\n\nOn the Design of OLO Radio: Investigating Metadata as a Design Material\n\nThe SelfReflector: Design, IoT and the High Street\n\nBuilding Devices: Hardware, Materials, and Fabrication\n\nThis subcommittee focuses on advances in interactive hardware, new sensing, display, and actuation approaches, developments in materials that lead to novel interactive capabilities, and new fabrication techniques.

Typical papers study or enhance interaction underpinned by, for instance, machine learning, optimization, statistical modeling, natural language processing, control theory, signal processing and computer vision. Beyond simply applying such methods, they seek new ways to describe, predict, and change interaction and guide the design of interactive systems that rely on computational methods or demonstrate applications of such systems. Core contributions typically take the form of novel theories, methods, techniques, and systems for computational approaches in HCI, as well as reports of rigorous empirical studies of interactive systems supported by computational approaches. Contributions will be judged by their rigor, significance, validity, and practical or theoretical impact.\n\nAccepted papers contribute to our understanding of computational methods in human use of computing. The subcommittee is not limited to algorithms but welcomes a broad range of contributions, including but not limited to:\n\nData set or analysis\n\nEmpirical study, including replication studies\n\nMethod\n\nTheory and modeling\n\nDesign\n\nCommentary or essay\n\nAn excellent paper advances knowledge of computational approaches in human-computer interaction. Even in algorithmic contributions, the human viewpoint is central and kept visible throughout. In particular, an excellent paper 1) addresses a well-scoped phenomenon in human use of computers; 2) rigorously introduces and argues for the chosen approach, including assumptions both about humans and the computational approach, as well as differences and similarities with previous work; 3) explicates the claimed contribution in terms of benefit or disadvantage to humans; 4) provides adequate evidence; and 5) offers a balanced discussion of the contribution, including generalizability and limitations. In addition, critical viewpoints and negative findings are welcome. For example, a critical commentary of social implications of machine intelligence, an empirical insight to algorithmic threats, or a failed replication study are valued as contributions in this subcommittee.\n\nSubcommittee Chairs\n\nPer Ola Kristensson, University of Cambridge\n\nRebecca Fiebrink, University of the Arts London\n\nXiaojun Bi, Stony Brook University\n\nContact: sc.compint@chi2022.acm.org\n\nSubcommittee Chairs’ Assistants\n\nBo Kang, University of Cambridge\n\nAssociate Chairs\n\nNikola Banovic, University of Michigan\n\nAndrea Bunt, University of Manitoba\n\nXiang ‘Anthony’ Chen, UCLA\n\nJohn Dudley, University of Cambridge\n\nAnna Feit, Saarland University\n\nElena Glassman, Harvard University\n\nAndrew Howes, University of Birmingham\n\nJussi P.P.
