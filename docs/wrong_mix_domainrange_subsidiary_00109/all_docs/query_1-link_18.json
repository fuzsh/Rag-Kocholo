        "text": "On July 29, it will be two years since I lost my 12-year old daughter to suicide. She was a beautiful light and the world is so much darker without her presence. There are no words to describe the anguish and devastation this has caused for those who loved her. The loss is immeasurable and learning how to come back from such a tragedy has been the hardest thing I have ever undertaken. To say I have been bereft would be the understatement of the century. No one ever discusses the collateral damage that occurs in the space that is left when someone chooses to end their life. In the aftermath of her passing my family was completely torn apart and my life crumbled like a house of cards. My career, along with most everything else that mattered to me, lost their meaning as I tried to navigate the unfathomable. In the first year, the anger, guilt, and blame almost destroyed me. Fortunately, I had a solid friend base, my art, my dog, and more importantly, I had a son who still needed his mother. These factors have given me the strength to persevere in what has truly been an uphill battle. There have been times where I have likened my life to country song. I lost my child, I lost my job, I lost my financial security, I lost my home, and I even lost my dog. After taking time off to grieve through the Family and Medical Leave Act, my employer who was based in India, laid me off at their earliest convenience. This is the same company that suggested I \"get back up on the horse\" just two weeks after she died. So why am I posting something so personal on a career job board? For the last six months, I have desperately been trying to find employment again but I have been unable to break through the noise to secure an interview. Before my child died, I was making well into the six figures. In the last year I have applied to hundreds of jobs ranging from minimum wage to those of the same caliber I used to have, but to no avail. As a result, I had to move in with my sister and I applied for food stamps for the first time in my life. It has been so humbling. I have been working in technology as an Experience Architect for over 20 years. Some of my clients include Microsoft, Procter & Gamble, The Gates Foundation, and T-Mobile. My strengths include Digital Strategy, Product Design, and User Research. I am an earnest and hard worker who brings integrity and tenacity to all that I do. My coworkers would say I have a positive outlook, a warm smile, and that I am quite insightful. To quote a Software Development Manager, “Summer will be the spark that will make any team push the limits of creativity and productivity.” If you are reading this and know of an opening that fits my skillset, could you please give me an introduction to your hiring manager? My resume and cover letter can be found at: https://summer-sky.me/ Thank you for your time, Summer https://lnkd.in/eVSb2B7q"
