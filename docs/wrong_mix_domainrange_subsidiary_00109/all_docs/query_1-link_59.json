        "text": "•\n\nBackground and Diversity. The nominating and governance committee seeks director nominees from diverse professional and personal backgrounds who combine a broad spectrum of experience and expertise with a reputation for integrity. This assessment will include an individual’s independence, as well as consideration of age, skills, and experience, and a policy of promoting diversity, in the context of our needs. While our Board does not establish specific goals with respect to diversity, the Board’s diversity is a consideration in the director nomination process.\n\n•\n\nCharacter. Directors should be persons of good character and demonstrate high ethical standards and integrity in their personal and professional dealings. Directors should have a history of achievements which reflects high standards for themselves and others. Directors should possess the ability to provide wise and thoughtful counsel on a broad range of issues and be willing to be accountable for their decisions as directors. Directors should interact with one another in a manner which encourages responsible, open, challenging, and inspired discussion.\n\n•\n\nSufficient Time to Devote to Board Matters. Each director is expected to dedicate sufficient time, energy, and attention to ensure the diligent performance of his or her duties. To that end, no director should serve on more than four other public company boards, and no member of the audit committee should serve on more than two other public company audit committees, in each case without the prior approval of the Board. No director who is the chief executive officer of another public company should serve on more than two other public company boards, aside from the board of his/her own company without the prior approval of the Board.\n\n(1)\n\nRepresents director fees earned during fiscal 2024. Mr. Kolek’s director fees include $50,000 for his service as Chair of the Board and $25,000 for his service as Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee. Mr. Hovsepian’s director fees include $25,000 for his service as Chair of the Compensation Committee (from which he resigned in April 2024 upon his appointment as Executive Chair), and Ms. Mills’ director fees include $25,000 for her service as Chair of the Audit Committee.\n\n(2)\n\nEach non-employee director received an equity award of 3,750 restricted stock units on July 20, 2023. The fair value of such restricted stock units was computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718 excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures at $29.80 per share. All such restricted stock units are subject to vesting in full one year from the grant date, or the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders, whichever is earlier. Includes amounts deferred by certain of our non-employee directors at their election. As of January 31, 2024, the aggregate number of outstanding equity awards (unvested restricted stock units) held by each director was 3,750.\n\n(2)\n\nFor fiscal 2024, the amounts represent the aggregate grant date fair value of time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures and, in the case of the PSUs, based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions as of the grant date. See “Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End” below for a listing of RSU and PSU awards outstanding for each named executive officer as of January 31, 2024. See Note 18 to our financial statements included in our Annual Report for descriptions of the methodologies and assumptions we used to value performance-based restricted stock unit awards. The PSUs vest according to service and market conditions, and therefore have no maximum grant date fair values that differ from the grant date fair values presented in the table.\n\n(3)\n\nFor fiscal 2024, the amounts for each named executive officer include a matching 401(k) contribution of $4,000 under the 401(k) Plan (as defined below) on the same terms as provided to all of Skillsoft’s regular full-time employees. In addition, the amount for Mr. Tarr includes $3,150 towards an annual executive health evaluation and $1,847 related to guest travel expenses and a $1,447 tax gross-up related to the same. For Mr. Purakayastha, includes, amounts of $4,677 related to guest travel expenses and a $1,943 tax gross-up related to the same. Guest travel expenses for Mr. Tarr and Mr. Purakayastha were incurred for an annual conference where NEOs were permitted to have spousal participation.\n\nName\n\nNumber of\n\nsecurities\n\nunderlying\n\nunexercised\n\noptions /\n\nwarrants\n\n(#)\n\nExercisable\n\nNumber of\n\nsecurities\n\nunderlying\n\nunexercised\n\noptions (#)\n\nUnexercisable\n\nOption\n\nexercise\n\nprice ($)\n\nOption\n\nExpiration\n\ndate\n\nNumber\n\nof\n\nshares\n\nor units\n\nof stock\n\nthat\n\nhave not\n\nvested\n\n($)\n\nMarket\n\nvalue of\n\nshares\n\nor units\n\nof stock\n\nthat\n\nhave not\n\nvested\n\n($)(1)\n\nEquity\n\nincentive\n\nplan\n\nawards:\n\nNumber\n\nof\n\nunearned\n\nshares,\n\nunits or\n\nother\n\nrights\n\nthat have\n\nnot\n\nvested (#)\n\nEquity\n\nincentive\n\nplan\n\nawards:\n\nMarket\n\nor\n\npayout\n\nvalue of\n\nunearned\n\nshares,\n\nunits or\n\nother\n\nrights\n\nthat not\n\nvested\n\n($)(1)\n\n(13)\n\nRepresents the unearned portion of the PSU award granted on June 1, 2022.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the compensation committee may act prior to January 1 of a given year to provide that there will be no January 1 increase for such year or that the increase for such year will be a lesser number of shares of common stock than provided herein.
