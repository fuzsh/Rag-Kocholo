        "text": "Business analytics is a collection of tools and techniques used to turn data into insights for business decision making.\n\nAnalytics Magazine regularly features applications of analytics. The BC Library has a subscription, so you can access it through their website (search for “analytics journal”).\n\nThe most important skill to have is an aptitude for problem solving, but it is also helpful to have a familiarity with:\n\nProgramming (Python is the most commonly used general-purpose language—and it's free.)\n\nStatistical software (R is the most widely-used statistical software. It’s free, and the interface R Studio, also free, can make getting started a little easier.)\n\nVisualization software (Both Python and R have great visualization capabilities; Tableau is a standalone product that you can get a free student license for, and you’ll find that you can teach yourself a lot.)\n\nGetting data from databases.\n\nAnalytics has a wide range of applications. The tools you learn in the Business Analytics co-concentration apply not only to traditional business problems but to any issue of interest where data is collected. Below are a few examples.\n\nSocial impact\n\nBayes Impact\n\nDataKind\n\nMarketing\n\n“How to Make the Most of Predictive Analytics,” Marketing Week.\n\n“Analytics Applications in Consumer Credit and Retail Marketing,\" Analytics. This one has lots of jargon and is a dense read, but also has lots of details about applications.\n\nHealthcare\n\n“9 Examples of Big Data Analytics in Healthcare That Can Save People,” Datapine.\n\nInvestment Banking\n\n“How to Secure a Big Data Job in Investment Banking,” Efinancialcareers.\n\n“What is it Like to be a Data Scientist at an Investment Bank,” Quora.\n\nAccounting\n\n“Business Analytics: Transforming the Role of Management Accountants,” Managing Accounting Quarterly (2015). Page 5 of this link has examples of how analytics is used in accounting.\n\nThere are lots of competitions and hackathons for students to practice their analytics skills, and experience with these can help to build students' resumes.\n\nASA Data Fest\n\nKaggle has a revolving menu of competitions.\n\nFound a good resource that should be listed here?
