        "text": "Herta Günther posthumously on her 90th birthday\n\n12.04. - 07.06.2024\n\nFollowing art Karlsruhe in February, we would like to commemorate the unforgotten artist and her timelessly impressive work posthumously on her 90th birthday with this exhibition. Galerie Döbele has accompanied Herta Günther since the 1980s. We celebrated her 70th and 80th birthdays together (each with an exhibition catalog) and it is certainly in the spirit of the artist to celebrate her 90th birthday with you.\n\nWe cordially invite you and your friends to the opening on Friday, April 12, at 6 p.m. at Richard-Wagner-Straße 51 in Mannheim.\n\nart Karlsruhe 2024\n\n20. - 25.02.2024\n\nUnder new management, art Karlsruhe is returning to its original date in February this year. From February 22 - 25, 2024 you will also find us again at the fair at booth A 01 in hall 1.\n\nAs always, we would like to inspire you with a mixture of our Our Classics program including Max Ackermann, Hermann Glöckner, Ida Kerkovius, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Ernst Wilhelm Nay and Otto Piene in combination with contemporary artists - Eberhard Freudenreich, Martina Geist, Herta Günther, Mona Pourebrahim, Annette Schröter and Max Uhlig. But we still leave a little room for surprises...\n\nContinuum\n\n02.02. - 05.04.2024\n\nUnder the title Continuum, six young international artists have come together to make exciting contributions to this further development - this continuum - through their diverse perspectives and forms of expression. All six positions deal with the painterly space in different ways. This creates connections to the past and art-historical tradition in many places, which are linked to the present through contemporary motifs and themes. One thing they also all have in common is an overlap in their otherwise very different biographies.\n\nThe opening of the exhibition will take place on Friday, February 02, 2024 at 5 p.m.\n\nRespectively - Martina Geist, Katharina Hinsberg, Annette Schröter\n\n22. - 24.09.2023\n\nin correspondence with artists from our classics program:\n\nMax Ackermann - Eugen Batz - Peter Brüning - Jacques Germain - Hermann Glöckner - Kurt Günther - Otto Ritschl - Max Uhlig\n\nOn the one hand, our new exhibition reveals a field of tension in the correspondence between the classics from our gallery program - works of abstraction, expressionism and surrealism - and contemporary women artists. This opens the possibility for new ways of seeing and categorization - and also for trouvailles. You will be surprised!\n\nOn the other hand, the different approaches and techniques of the artists are also interesting:\n\nMartina Geist - The artist from Stuttgart, who varies the oldest printing technique, the woodcut in a new way and sets new accents by combining the boundaries between print, printing block, graphics, painting and object. In this way she has developed a new visual language.\n\nKatharina Hinsberg - The exhibition features specifically colored pencil drawings on paper, cut out. Her central design tool is the line.\n\nAnnette Schröter - The special feature of her work lies in a completely new interpretation of the classic paper cut. Again and again the Leipzig artist takes up the challenge to create a different kind of painting with her works.\n\nThe exhibition will open on Friday, June 16, 2023, starting at 5:00 pm at Leibnizstraße 26 in the presence of the artists. At 18:00 Hedwig Döbele will give an insight into the work of the artists and on the exhibition concept.\n\nYou are cordially invited. We are looking forward to your coming! Registration is not necessary.\n\nHedwig and Johann Döbele\n\nRespectively - Martina Geist, Katharina Hinsberg, Annette Schröter\n\n16.06. - 12.08.2023\n\nin correspondence with artists from our classics program:\n\nMax Ackermann - Eugen Batz - Peter Brüning - Jacques Germain - Hermann Glöckner - Kurt Günther - Otto Ritschl - Max Uhlig\n\nOn the one hand, our new exhibition reveals a field of tension in the correspondence between the classics from our gallery program - works of abstraction, expressionism and surrealism - and contemporary women artists.

Registration is not necessary.\n\nHedwig and Johann Döbele\n\nHIERZULANDE - Pictures from the Palatinate at the open storage of Döbele Kunst Mannheim, Richard-Wagner-Str. 56\n\n27.04. - 03.06.2023\n\nIf something is to be good, it must be done with passion. This is also true for our upcoming art exhibition: an exhibition that has been put together with a lot of perseverance and dedication by a private collector - himself from the Palatinate. The passion for the region in the triangle between Karlsruhe, Mannheim and Kaiserslautern, for the Wine Route, the Palatinate Forest, for castles, palaces, rural life and the people themselves has finally produced a wonderful collection of paintings from the past century.\n\nOur upcoming exhibition shows this art from the Palatinate, almost 50 works by 25 artists who came from this region or chose it as their home. You can experience how versatile their perception and view of the homeland is from April 27th in the rooms of our exhibition depot in Richard-Wagner-Str. 51!\n\nExhibition from April 27 - June 3, 2023\n\nWe would like to invite you to the opening on Thursday, 27.04.2023, at 7 pm!\n\nThe introductory speech will be held by Dr. Heinz Höfchen, Offenburg (curator of the Pfalzgalerie in Kaiserslautern for many years).\n\nDoris Ziegler - Das Passagen-Werk. Paintings - at the gallery rooms of Döbele Kunst Mannheim at Leibnizstraße 26\n\n14.04. - 27.05.2023\n\nFirst brought to public attention by the sensational exhibition \"Point of No Return\" at Leipzig's Museum der Bildenden Künste in 2019, the paintings can now be seen again in two parallel exhibitions:\n\nAt Kunstmuseum Moritzburg Halle (Saale) | \"I am You\" | Feb. 26-May 21, 2023.\n\nAt Döbele Kunst Mannheim | \"Melancholy and World Theater\" | 14.04. - 27.05.2023\n\nPaintings from the years 1977 to 2016 are shown at the Kunstmuseum Moritzburg Halle (Saale) with great resonance. The title of the solo show there is the 1988 main work \"Ich bin Du!\" - a self-portrait in nude androgynous double form, provocative at the time of its creation, which is being offered by Döbele Kunst Mannheim. The public and the press were unanimously enthusiastic about the unexpected new discovery of this artist: In March 2023, the reviewer of the Berliner Zeitung and Frankfurter Rundschau, Ingeborg Ruthe, wrote with fascination how masterfully and authentically Doris Ziegler succeeded in reporting \"in austere stylistics on the struggle of human existence between political storms and self-assertion.\n\nWhile the cabinet exhibition in Halle (Saale) features excerpts from the complete works of the artist represented by Döbele, the focus in the gallery is pointedly on the \"Passagen-Werk\" created between 1988 and 1994. This cycle of paintings is undoubtedly the main artistic achievement of the painter, who was born in Weimar in 1949.\n\nIn Mannheim, eight paintings from the \"Passagen-Werk\" are now available, which is already a novelty considering the art-historical significance of these paintings. In addition, all the paintings come directly from Doris Ziegler's Leipzig artist's studio, where, completely unnoticed by the public, they have survived the political upheavals and art-historical reassessments.\n\nThe World on the Upper Rhine - Photographs by Robert Häusser from the 1960s\n\n22.09. - 12.11.2022\n\nThe 30 most beautiful motifs of the series \"The World on the Upper Rhine\" by Robert Häusser have been published by Döbele Kunst Mannheim in a very small edition of 10 copies.\n\nThe first 8 works on our website cost 1.200,- EUR, all further works are available for 980,- EUR. The edition can be viewed at any time by prior arrangement by mail or telephone. Do not hesitate to contact us for a visit.\n\nThe Finishing - Mona Pourebrahim & Hamidreza Yaraghchi\n\n23.04. - 16.07.2022\n\nAt first, the title of our new exhibition \"The Finishing\" seems a bit misleading, as this double show is the long-awaited new beginning, a spring awakening from the long pandemic hibernation, so to speak. A new beginning that we have been longing for for two years and that we now want to celebrate with two fresh artist positions.\n\nBut \"The Finishing\" can also be translated as \"The Refining,\" and so it is in this spirit that we are pleased to introduce Mona Pourebrahim and Hamidreza Yaraghchi.\n\nWe are looking forward to your visit! Hedwig and Johann Döbele\n\nThe Freedom of Thought\n\n30.10.2021 - 29.01.2022\n\nThe freedom of art is a fundamental right and one of the most protected in the German catalog of fundamental rights. From today's perspective, it is hard to imagine what it meant to work non-figuratively as an artist in the 1950s/60s, contrary to the expectations of the state apparatus of the GDR. However, the intense political discussions about the role of art as an instrument of popular education already in the early years of the GDR made any deviating aesthetic positioning be understood as hostile to the state. It is therefore all the more astonishing, and has so far been all too little discussed, how courageously and defiantly a whole series of artists stood up to this.\n\nHerta Günther (1934-2018) - Pastels\n\n04.09. - 09.10.2021\n\nIn her pastels Herta Günther used the potential of oil painting in combination with the technique of drawing, she also mastered both methods.\n\nMainly she painted with the three colors that have been used since the beginning of pastel painting in the 15th century: Black, white and red.\n\nThis reduced color palette, the picture details as well as the striking figures give her paintings a captivating appeal.\n\nTheir looks and poses are unusual and when looking into the pictures the viewer tries to look behind the facades of the portrayed and to guess what shaped them.\n\nHerta Günther found her \"types\" during visits to cafés and bars. Here she observed, then pulled out the pen, sketched and noted the essentials.\n\nHead over Heels. Doris Ziegler - Painting\n\n03.07. - 07.08.2021\n\nThe world exists through change and transition. In Doris Ziegler's painting \"Kopfüber\" (Head over heels) (1992), time seems to be out of joint and the figure-personnel in the midst of an upheaval in search of hold. The figures' postures avoid any sense of security and symbolize the intrusion of the unforeseen into the static of life's plans.\n\nThe exhibition presents a panorama of the Leipzig artist's oeuvre, from self-portraits to figure paintings (including Passagenbilder) and architectural paintings.\n\nThe exhibition will be accompanied by the monograph \"DORIS ZIEGLER. The Passage Work - Painting\". Edited by Dr. Paul Kaiser, with essays and image texts as well as the catalog raisonné of the paintings (1970-2020), Weimar 2020, ISBN 978-3-00-066335-2, 39,90 €.\n\nThe baroque Hassebrauk (1905-1974)\n\n26.06. - 07.08.2021\n\nThe title of the exhibition already points to Hassebrauk's great arc of color. To the opulence of things he added an opulence of color, thus creating a singular artistic signature with a high recognition value.\n\nIn the exhibition Döbele Kunst Mannheim shows an exquisite selection of market-fresh paintings and pastels, in which the inner connection of the artist with the epoch of opulence and pleasure - the baroque - is represented. For art connoisseurs certainly a new discovery!\n\nEYE CONSUMPTION - Original Photographs from the Artistic Work of Robert Häusser\n\n27.03. - 24.04.2021\n\nFrom a private collection, intended for private collectors, we show 25 of the original photographs of Robert Häusser, signed and authorized with his thumbprint, which are only available in small numbers.\n\nHis photographic images are not intended for quick eye consumption, said Robert Häusser himself. In these days of Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube, quick image consumption is booming. We swipe, scroll and flood our eyes by looking at the screen.\n\nThe black-and-white photographs of Robert Häusser (1924-2013) are characterized by their own visual language. The Mannheim-based photographer plays with perception, aesthetics and unfamiliar reality. With the black-and-white photographs he gives his interpretation of reality. It is the small quiet things that attracted him, from geometric structures, multi-layered perspectives to poetic compositions.\n\nThe thoroughly composed productions give something sublime to the ordinary, which stimulates the viewer to reflect.\n\nIn 1995, Robert Häusser was the first German photographer to receive the Hasselblad Award, the most important international award for photography. Even during his lifetime, he exhibited worldwide, was influential in shaping styles, and paved the way for generations to come.\n\nInquiries at any time at:\n\nDöbele art private\n\nLeibnizstr. 26, 68165 Mannheim, Germany\n\n+49 621 79943078 +49 174 1663050\n\nJohann Döbele\n\nMax Uhlig: The Moving Line in Expressive Rhythm\n\n03.11.2020 - 27.02.2021\n\nThis exhibition in our open storage at Richard-Wagner-Strasse 51 has been extended until 27.02.2021.\n\nThe Corona - regulations decree the closing of the rooms in the open storage.

They do not enter into any comparison and yet they reinforce the meaning of the other. In the joint exhibition these metaphors can be felt. This is highly inspiring and exciting.\n\nAccompanying the exhibition, we invite you to a talk with the artists and the photo historian Prof. Dr. Claude W. Sui on Saturday, 01/26/2019 at 7 p.m..\n\nRobert Häusser (1924-2013) The photographic, artistic work\n\n05.05. - 09.06.2018\n\nLike hardly any other artist, Robert Häusser shaped the development of contemporary photography. With his presence at this year's ART COLOGNE (19.-22.4.18) through our gallery, a new look at an oeuvre is offered, which is more current than ever with regard to current developments of the medium.\n\nNow Robert Häusser is strategically represented by \"Döbele Kunst Mannheim\" in cooperation with Museums Management Mannheim GmbH, subsidiary of the Curt-Engelhorn-Stiftung. The aim is to establish him as a modern classic on the art and photography market.\n\nLINE FORM PAPER Eberhard Freudenreich\n\n23.03. - 29.04.2017\n\nEberhard Freudenreich prints it, cuts it, draws on it and currently he also folds it - paper. In his latest works he takes the material, which in art is otherwise mainly anchored in the second dimension as a picture carrier, into the third dimension.\n\nVernissage on Thursday, 03/23/2017 at 7pm - together with the artist.\n\nThe introduction will be held by Eva Wick M.A. A catalog will be published.\n\nHerta Günther - between dream and knowledge\n\n26.01. - 04.03.2017\n\nHerta Günther (b.1934) observes people very closely. She draws from the everyday, visits pubs, cafes and restaurants - places where people meet. This is how her street and interior scenes are created. One believes to know the sitters, feels connected to them, their looks nevertheless do not reveal everything, something mysterious surrounds them.\n\nOpening on Thursday, 01/26/2017 at 7pm.\n\nHedwig Döbele will hold the introduction.\n\nFrom Bauhaus to new beginnings - Eugen Batz + Xanti Schawinsky\n\n19.11.2016 - 14.01.2017\n\nWith the exhibition \"Vom Bauhaus zum Aufbruch\" Döbele Kunst Mannheim participates in the current scene discourse that rediscovers and reevaluates the art of the post-war period.\n\nThe artists Xanti Schawinsky (1904-1979) and Eugen Batz (1905-1986) studied at the Bauhaus in Weimar and Dessau. They developed their own art profiles beyond the Nazi era into the 40s and 50s awakening years and into the 70s.\n\nOpening on Sunday, 11/20/2016 at 11:30 am.\n\nThe introductory words will be held by the art historian and curator of the exhibition Eva Wick."
