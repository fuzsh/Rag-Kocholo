        "text": "This film documents the meeting of two painters – the older artist in front of the camera demonstrates his work to the younger artist behind the camera. It almost seems as though 96-year-old Glöckner has forgotten his colleague’s presence as he draws with sweeping gestures, observes his work on paper, throws some attempts away, accepts others – all with a sincere sense of self-confidence. Glöckner also speaks of his experiences under the Nazis and his difficulties with Socialist Realism in the 1950s and 60s. His work was a revelation for many American art historians when it was shown in the groundbreaking 2009 LACMA exhibit, Art of Two Germanys: Cold War Cultures. This is the only filmic portrait of the artist.\n\nThis film is available for purchase or streaming as part of the collection ART | WORK Six Shorts."
