        "text": "In 2024 we celebrate Caspar David Friedrich's 250th birthday. Many contemporary artists have explored this great role model, but probably none as intensively as Hiroyuki Masuyama. Consequently, Masuyama is in great demand this year: he is exhibiting at the Hamburger Kunsthalle, the Bundesrat, the Alte Nationalgalerie and the Pommersches Landesmuseum in Friedrich's native city of Greifswald. And of course with us!\n\nDie Lebensstufen (nach C.D.Friedrich, 1835), 2023, LED Lightbox, 72 x 94 x 4 cm, Edition 5 + 2 AP, 15000 Euro\n\nHamburger Kunsthalle, 15.12.2023 - 1.4.2024\n\nRothamel Gallery at the Art Karlsruhe, 22-25 February 2024\n\nOld National Gallery, 14 April 2024 - 4 August 2024\n\nGerman Federal Council, 21 March - 21 June 2024\n\nRothamel Gallery Frankfurt, 6 December 2024 to January 2025\n\nHiroyuki Masuyama focuses on space and time. He condenses their presence and flow into overwhelming yet subtle works.\n\nFor Masuyama, art is a great adventure and freedom beyond all restrictions of space and time: he shows us places where all seasons prevail at the same time. He proves that you can see something from all sides at the same time. He cycles through an entire year in one minute and lets us float freely in space.\n\nDas große Gehege (after C.D. Friedrich, 1832), 2016, diasec/led lightbox, edition 5, 73,5 x 102,5 x 4 cm, 12.000 Euro\n\nA whole series of time travels leads Masuyama to Caspar David Friedrich. Masuyama recomposed the works of the great Romantic artist from hundreds of photographic images and allows us to experience their fascination anew in a contemporary form.\n\n\"The temporal levels merged in this way emphasise once again: art only ever has one present. It is the one in which thinking about it takes place.\" Michael Freitag\n\nGalerie Rothamel - Art Karlsruhe 2024\n\nFebruary 22 - 24, 2024\n\nHall 1 / A 24 and sculpture square Hall 1 / B26Karlsruhe Trade Fair Center, Messeallee 1, 76287 Rheinstetten, Germany\n\nPreview on Wednesday, February 21 from 2 to 7 pm.\n\nThursday to Saturday: 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.\n\nSunday: 11 am to 6 pm.\n\nThe longing for stories is back. For us, the current edition of Art KA 2024 is all about narrative, storytelling art: painting, photography, sculpture and ceramics. All of the artists presented are masters of the means of their respective medium and convey substantial content in their works. The narratives are extraordinarily multifaceted, reach deep into art history and are at the same time highly topical.\n\nSoloshow\n\nMoritz Götze\n\nOrdnung und Disziplin (Rostocker Pappe) 2022, Mischtechnik auf botanischer Wandtafel, 81 x 67,5 cm, 3200 Euro\n\nGötze describes his art as German Pop and dates its roots back to the Humanist art of the 16th century. He has created one of the most extensive artistic\n\noeuvre of our time: Paintings, architectural artworks, enamels, mosaics, sculptures, objects, drawings and graphics.\n\nHe created new screen printing techniques and renewed contemporary enamel painting.\n\nSculpture Square\n\nGrita Götze\n\nTageszeiten, 2022, Engobemalerei, Hohe 50 cm, 6000 Euro\n\nGrita Götze creates ceramics whose quality confidently transcends the boundaries of applied art: her painting is virtuoso, her technical perfection enormous. Works by the artist can be found in collections such as the August Kaestner Museum in Hanover, the Badisches Landesmuseum in Karlsruhe, the Kunstmuseum Moritzburg in Halle, the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Berlin and the Museum Ludwig.\n\n\"Anyone who wants to experience how beauty and the image of nature can mutually enhance each other in the artistic object will find fascinating visual models in Grita Götze's ceramic works. With the gesture of the self-evident, usability and decoration, vessel form and ornament are in perfect harmony in these objects.\"\n\nKarin Thomas\n\nThe artist works on these vessels for weeks. They are the visible luxury of time at rest. Self-will and an astonishing degree of mastery are her unique selling points. There is no squinting to the side. This is a splendor that does not care in the least about concepts, trends, innovations and all the other current affairs.\n\nHiroyuki Masuyama\n\nDie Lebensstufen (nach C.D.Friedrich, 1835), 2023, LED Lightbox, 72 x 94 x 4 cm, Auflage 5 + 2 AP, 15000 Euro\n\nIn 2024, we will be celebrating Caspar David Friedrich's 250th birthday. Many contemporary artists have explored this great role model, but probably none as intensively as Hiroyuki Masuyama. Consequently, Masuyama is in great demand this year: he is exhibiting at the Hamburger Kunsthalle, the Bundesrat, the Alte Nationalgalerie and the Pommersches Landesmuseum in Friedrich's hometown of Greifswald. And of course with us!\n\nHiroyuki Masuyama focuses on space and time. He condenses their presence and flow into overwhelming yet subtle works.\n\nFor Masuyama, art is a great adventure and freedom beyond all limitations of space and time: he shows us places where all seasons reign at the same time. He proves that you can see something from all sides at the same time. He cycles through an entire year in one minute and lets us float freely in space.\n\nA whole series of time travels leads Masuyama to Caspar David Friedrich. Using hundreds of photographic images, Masuyama recomposed the works of the great Romantic artist and allows us to experience their fascination anew in a contemporary form.\n\n\"The time levels merged in this way make it clear once again: art only ever has one present. It is the one in which thinking about it takes place.\" Michael Freitag\n\nDana Meyer\n\nDana Meyer's \"South Pacific Expedition\" has already lasted several years. To date, it has yielded a rich collection of fictitious metal insects, which the artist classifies, stores in antiquated jars and labels neatly. She lists numerous South Sea islands as the places where she found them, dating them to the first decade of the twentieth century.\n\nNguyen Xuan Huy\n\nVera, 2023, Öl auf Leinwand, 207 x 147 cm, 24.800 Euro\n\nOne of the most exciting positions in contemporary painting is represented by a man born in Hanoi. His works are nothing less than a proposal for a new European art. He often makes his statements in the form of mythological, philosophical or literary parables. Transcending the avant-garde, he builds a bridge from classical European art to the visual culture of the present. His paintings are cultivated and at the same time unsparing analyses of the current state of our continent and its inhabitants.\n\nNguyen Xuan Huy was born in 1976. He studied at the Hanoi School of Architecture, at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Bordeaux and received his diploma in painting at the HfKD Burg Giebichenstein in Halle in 2003. He lives and works in Berlin.\n\nThitz\n\nLondon Utopian Tower Bridge, 2021, Acryl und Tüten auf Leinwand, 120 x 180 cm, 16500 Euro\n\n\"Bags and acrylic on canvas\" is how Thitz describes the material structure of his paintings. Vivid, tangible, immediate testimonies to a world steaming with vitality. \"If you really want to paint big cities, you must not depict an imaginary city, but try to paint the perceived experience itself, with all the noises, noise, dust and smells. An infinite amount of information fits into one second of a city - I mean this city, these are my inner images,\" Thitz postulates."
