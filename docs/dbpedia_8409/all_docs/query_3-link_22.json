        "text": "While Anka, Eva’s mother, was working in the factory in Freiberg, the Allies began to extensively bomb Dresden.\n\nAlthough devastating for those in Dresden, Anka and the other prisoners had hope that the Allies were getting closer, and might one day free them.\n\nIn March 1939, the Nazis invaded and occupied Czechoslovakia.\n\nDuring their occupation of the country, the Nazis implemented a number of antisemitic laws, restricting Jewish life.\n\nIn this video, Eva discusses her mother’s experience of this pre-war persecution.\n\nDuring the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, Jews were forced to wear a yellow star with the word ‘Jew’ on it, to distinguish them from non-Jews.\n\nHere, Eva describes her mother’s memories of wearing the star.\n\nBetween November – December 1941, both of Eva’s parents were transported to Theresienstadt (also known as Terezin).\n\nIn this video, Eva explains how her parents found out they were being transported and her mother’s journey there.\n\nIn 1944, Anka, by then pregnant with Eva, was sent to Auschwitz, where she survived a selection and was selected for work.\n\nIn this video, Eva recounts her mother’s memories of the journey and selection.\n\nAfter arriving at Auschwitz, Anka went through ‘selection’, where prisoners were selected to work or sent to the gas chambers to be murdered on arrival.\n\nAnka was selected to work. Here, Eva describes her mothers memories of selection and roll call in the camp.\n\nEva’s aunt and other family members were sent to Auschwitz earlier than her mother and father.\n\nAfter arriving in the camp, Eva’s aunt was forced to write a postcard home to her family stating that she and her child, Peter (Eva’s cousin) were happy and healthy.\n\nAlthough the postcards were screened for any messages that may have warned others of their situation, Eva’s aunt managed to hide the hebrew word for ‘bread’ into the postcard, to indicate that they were starving.\n\nThe family understood the message and sent food to Eva’s aunt, but before the postcard had even been posted from Auschwitz, Eva’s aunt and cousin had been killed.\n\nIn October 1944, after spending ten days in Auschwitz, Eva’s mother was transferred to a military factory in Freiberg to complete forced labour.\n\nShe was kept at the factory for six months, working on German bomber planes. All the while, she became more and more pregnant with Eva, which was very dangerous.\n\nIn this video, Eva describes her mother’s memories of the factory.\n\nWhile Anka, Eva’s mother, was working in the factory in Freiberg, the Allies began to extensively bomb Dresden.\n\nAlthough devastating for those in Dresden, Anka and the other prisoners had hope that the Allies were getting closer, and might one day free them.\n\nIn April 1945, as the Allies closed in, the Nazis began to evacuate prisoners. Anka was transferred from the factory to Mauthausen concentration camp.\n\nShe was transported in a coal truck, with no roof, on a journey that took three weeks. The Nazis gave the prisoners no food or water during that time.\n\nAfter arriving in Mauthausen, and seeing the name of the camp, Anka went into labour, giving birth to Eva on 29 April 1945.\n\nEva and Anka were liberated just a few days after Eva was born in April 1945.\n\nAfter their liberation, they returned to Prague, where they lived with Eva’s aunt for three years. It was during this time that Anka learned of the death of her husband, and Eva’s father, Bernd.\n\nIn 1948, Anka remarried, and the family moved to Britain."
