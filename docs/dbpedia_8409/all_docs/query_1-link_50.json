        "text": "Alfred Gabali\n\n1886-1963\n\nGerman-American, Massachusetts-affiliated ship painter\n\nAlfred Gabali was born in Cologne, Germany on May 4, 1886. When he was sixteen, he left home to become a seaman aboard the four masted bark Pamier, a German ship trading between Antwerp and England. He later sailed on the Potose where he met a passenger, artist Schnars Alquist, who gave him his first formal art training. After several trips, Gabali returned to Germany and continued his studies in a seaman navigation school. During this time, he continued his art studies with Schnars Alquist. After several tumultuous years working on various ships and surviving WWI, Gabali finally married and settled down as a professional artist in Hamburg, Germany in 1923. During the Nazi regime, Gabali declined the request to join the Nazy Party artists organization. A decision which later caused him to leave his possessions and flee the country. He fled to Holland where it took him two years to reestablish himself professionally and to find a group of Dutch artist friends. These friends later helped him hide during WWII when it was invaded by the Germans. Finally, in 1949, Gabali and his wife emigrated to the United States, and he started his career once again. He became a citizen in 1955, the same year that he settled in Cape Cod, West Dennis, MA. He died in 1963.\n\nAlexander Galtchansky\n\n1959-2006\n\nTanya Wissotzky\n\n1959-2008\n\nSemi-abstract still life painters\n\nTanya Wissotzky and Alexander Galtchansky were both born in 1959 in Crimea. Alexander studied in Dnepropetrovsk, and Wissotzky studied in Simferopol, but both continued their studies at the Kiev Institute of the Arts. At Kiev, Wissotzky studied painting and Alexander studied book illustrating. After getting married, the couple immigrated to Israel and united their creative activities. Their works were done in acrylic, pen and ink, and collage on specially prepared canvas. In their still lifes, one can see the excerpts of calligraphy from old English flower painting manuals, as well as other quotation that celebrate Paris in the 1920s. Their work has received critical acclaim and success in both Israel and abroad and can be found in public and private collections all over the world. Tanya Wissotzky died in 2006 and Alexander Galtchansky died in 2008.\n\nLionel Garner\n\nb. 1960\n\nFrench Realist painter\n\nGarner is a recognized painter of photo-realism in France. Born in the Loire Valley in 1931, the artist became enraptured with the works of Renoir and Manet at an early age. While these Impressionists influenced his earlier canvases, paintings that included such scenes as the lush Loire Valley, he found himself progressing towards a style that was almost photo-realistic. It is this style, which is likened to Englands John Constable that Garner continued to develop, and of which he became a master. He was awarded the coveted Prize de Salon Independents from the Famous Parisian Salon. Then, in 1991, his works were acquired by the Museum of the City of Paris, which collected works of all famous French artists. The demanding technique Garner uses allows him to create only a handful of paintings each year. His beautifully executed works display painstaking detail. Thus, while his paintings have become a phenomenon throughout France, and he is sought after by Europes most prestigious galleries, Garners work remains scarce.\n\nClaude Gaveau\n\nb 1940\n\nFrench painter of female nudes\n\nClaude Gaveau was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France in December of 1940. His grandfather was the creator of the green houses of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, and his uncle was a painter. He enrolled at the School of Applies Arts in Paris, where he studied for five years specializing in mural art, stained glass, tapestry, mosaic, and fresco. Gaveau then studied for an additional six years at the National Superior School of Les Beaux Arts in Paris. His talent was soon recognized and he was awarded a scholarship from the Antwerp Academy, which allowed him to study Flemish painting in Brussels. In 1965, he had his first solo exhibition at the Angle Aigu Gallery in Paris. At the end of the 1970s, Gaveaus talent was discovered in America. He is internationally acclaimed, celebrated for his nudes and still life compositions.\n\nJonas Gerard\n\nb. 1941\n\nAmerican Contemporary abstract artist\n\nBorn in Casablanca, Morocco of French and Brazilian parentage, Jonas Gerard is a self-taught artist whose studio and gallery is currently in Asheville, NC. He begins each new painting with random brushstrokes of color and continues to work unpredictably and intuitively, often responding to the rhythm of music playing in his studio. He emerged onto the contemporary art scene in the 1990s. His influence comes from abstract expressionist artists like Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Hans Hoffman, and Franz Kline. Jonas believes that spirituality has to be the very essence of pure abstract art, otherwise it is lifeless. Gerards work has been exhibited all over the United States and abroad, and is in numerous collections, including the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nYankel Ginzburg\n\nb. 1945\n\nSoviet artist and sculptor\n\nYankel Ginzburg was born Yuri Zhukov in 1945 in Alma-Ata, capital of the Kazakhstan Republic near the Chinese border. His parents were both Russian Army officers, and his family escaped to Israel in 1957. He graduated from the Tel Aviv Academy of Art in 1964. At the age of nineteen, he sold his first painting. His work became increasingly popular in Israel, and he was invited to work in the United States. He travels between the United States and Israel to keep up with a busy schedule of commissions and gallery showings. In 1968. Ginzberg was invited to America and was honored with a solo show at the Washington Gallery of Art, sponsored by the Ambassador of Israel and Lyndon Johnson. Mystical symbolism and religious overtones typify the artists earlier works and offer an intriguing representation of the meshing of Gentile and Jew, Russian and Israeli. As the artist has continued to grow he has expanded to a different spectrum of motifs, modes, and techniques. One senses stylistic elements reminiscent of Miro and Kandinsky, as well as surrealistic components. Ginzburg is deeply attached to traditional artistic virtues such as craftsmanship, refinement of surface and detail, and conceptions of structure. The artist has been honored with the distinction of a formal invitation from the Egyptian Embassy to meet with Anwar Sadat at the Camp David Summit. He is to become the first Israeli artist to exhibit in Cairo. The goal of Ginzburgs forthcoming Mid-East trip will be to bring the people of Israel and the people of Egypt closer through appreciation of the arts.\n\nAndre Gisson\n\n1921-2003\n\nNew York City affiliate Neo Impressionist painter\n\nAlthough many sources cite him as a French painter, Andre Gisson was in reality a struggling painter in New York City. To enhance his reputation, he claimed to be French and adopted the brush name of André Gisson. He also professed to have been born in 1910 rather than his true birth date of 1921, to be more closely aligned with the founders of the Impressionist movement. Gissons real name was Anders Gittelson. Born in 1921 in Brooklyn, he graduated from the Pratt Institute and was a Captain in the Army during World War II. His paintings reflect his adopted Francophile persona, backed by travels and studies in Europe and the Far East and his desire to appear cosmopolitan in background. Over four decades, his one-man shows extended from New York, Washington, Texas and California to London, Paris and Tokyo. Gisson's landscapes, beach scenes, and portraits were intended to create a reflective mood of serenity. The still-lifes show Japanese influence in his work, while the French influence is more pronounced in his landscapes, beach scenes and studies of the human figure. However, there is little question that the artist approached his subject matter with a singular gesture, and with the romantic history of his persona, Gisson has a strong following among collectors of his works. Paintings by Andre Gisson can be found in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution and the Triton Museum of Art, in North Carolina. Among his private collectors were President Lyndon B. Johnson and W. Somerset Maugham. He lived and worked in Westport, Connecticut for twenty-five years prior to his death in 2003.\n\nAlbert Gleizes\n\n1881-1953\n\nFrench cubist artist\n\nAlbert Gleizes was born in 1881 and raised in Paris. He was the son of a fabric designer who ran a large industrial design workshop. After completing his secondary school, he spent four years in the 72nd Infantry Regiment of the French army and then began pursuing his career as a painter. In 1901 he began to paint self-taught in the Impressionist style. In 1909, Gleizes showed a great interest in color and reflected an interest in Fauvism, his work continued to become more synthetic with cubist components. From 1910 onward, he was directly involved with Cubism, both as an artist and principle theorist of the movement. Together with Jean Metzinger, he wrote the first major treatise on Cubism, Du Cubisme in 1912. He died in Avignon in 1953.\n\nHermann Glockner\n\n1889-1987\n\nGerman Constructivist painter and sculptor\n\nHermann Glockner was born in Cotta, Germany in 1889. He attended the vocational school in Leipzig in 1903 and worked as a designer for textiles. Beginning in 1904, and until 1911, he attended evening classes at the Kunstgewerbeschule Dresden. Glockner was very interested in drawings, but also in projections and geometry. He studied with Otto Gussmann from 1923-24 at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, but left the Academy when it was made known that his experimental style was not appreciated. As a freelance artist, he turned more deeply towards constructivism, however, the Nazis refused him any opportunities to exhibit and sell his works. He lost his home during World War II and moved to Loschwitz. Glockner made his works from objects he had on hand, such as twine, cardboard, matchboxes, and scraps of wood. In 1969, he was given an exhibition for his graphical works in Dresden. Finally, in 1984, he was awarded with the National Prize of the GDR and the DEFA dedicated a film to him. In a central area in Dresden, he was given permission to erect a sculpture. He died in West Berlin in 1987.\n\nWilliam Gropper\n\n1897-1977\n\nAmerican genre-satire painter and illustrator\n\nBorn in New York in 1897, William Gropper was a painter and cartoonist who, with caricature style, focused on social concerns, and was actively engaged in support of the organized labor movement throughout his career. As a young man, Gropper was a student of Robert Henri and George Bellows at the Ferrer School from 1912 to 1915. He painted on the side until the early 1920s, and has his first solo exhibition in 1936. He did much work for the New York Tribune newspaper, Vanity Fair magazine, and the politically Left-wing publication New Masses. Gropper died in 1977.\n\nChaim Gross\n\n1904-1991\n\nAmerican New York affiliated sculptor/wood carver\n\nBorn into a Hasidic Jewish family in 1904, Chaim Gross was a sculptor originally from Austria. He is known for his lively, naturalistic, often interlocking figure compositions. In 1912, his family moved to the Southwest of Ukraine and Gross went to Hebrew school. World War I broke out and in 1916, at the age of twelve, he escaped and went to Vienna, followed by Budapest, supporting himself with menial jobs. He sketched in his spare time, and by the end of the war, he was determined to be an artist. He studied for six months at the free art academy in Budapest, but in 1920, the government of Hungary was overthrown and as a Jewish alien, Gross was held in a detention camp. He ended up in Vienna, where he studied at the School of Arts and Crafts for almost a year. Meeting up with his brother, he emigrated to New York in April 1921. In New York, he took classes at the Educational Alliance Art School, and in 1922, he began sculpture and drawing classes at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, where Elie Nadelman became his most influential teacher. From that time, the human figure was his most important subject. Gross was committed to wood carving until the late 1950s, when he switched to bronze. His first exhibition was in 1926 at a group show at the Independent Students Gallery in NYC, and his first solo show was in March 1932 at Gallery 144 in Greenwich Village. In 1934 he became an American citizen. The Chaim Gross Studio Museum was founded in 1989, just two years before Gross death.\n\nFrank Gubernat\n\n-\n\nAmerican artist\n\nFrank Gubernat is a local artist based in Basking Ridge, NJ.
