        "text": "This study is based on an interactionist perspective, which conceives the art world as a social system. According to this view, the art world involves an interconnected group of actors, who share common interests and are embedded in a network of social relations. The aim of the essay is to offer an overview of the activity of visual artists in the German Democratic Republic and to outline their cultural exchange with Italy. Since the 1950s this interchange between GDR and Italy was supported by several actors and institutions at various levels (micro, meso and macro).\n\nThis article firstly gives an overview of Werner Tübke's commissioned works which for the most part are of political nature (revolutions, civil rights movements, the effects of globalized capitalism etc.). Secondly it discusses in depth his four paintings \"History of the German Working Class Movement\" of 1961. It also discusses Tübke's use of documentary photography and the critical reception of his paintings by political functionaries of the GDR.\n\nThis article looks at the impact that East Germany’s gender policies had on the visual arts and especially women painters across four decades. The first two sections focus on women’s participation in the national art exhibitions in Dresden during the Ulbricht and Honecker years, looking at how their artwork responded to official gender policies, and at the emergence of three women—Heidrun Hegewald, Gudrun Brüne, and Doris Ziegler—as nationally prominent painters. The third section focuses on the paintings and agitations of Angela Hampel in the 1980s as an example of a new phase in the pursuit of gender equality in East Germany, one abruptly cut short by the unification process. Ultimately this article argues that East Germany’s gender policies, despite not having achieved the stated goal of true equality, had a positive impact on women artists, and especially painters, in East Germany, increasing the number of women included in major exhibitions, encouraging greater complexity in their work, and ultimately fostering a socialist-feminist critique of lingering patriarchal biases.\n\nThis essay on the visual representation of landscapes in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) suggests the historical and aesthetic significance of romantic traditions of the nineteenth century for the Socialist cultural practice of the GDR as well as for theoretical reflections on the importance of landscape and nature for the development of a Socialist society. With such a comparative approach, we can not only interpret philosophical work by Lothar Kühne as a Marxist reflection on romantic notions of the importance of landscape but we can also trace the stylistic influence of romantic artists like Caspar David Friedrich on the GDR’s Socialist landscape painting. More specifically, the essay shows how Wolfgang Mattheuer became the foremost GDR landscape painter by adapting, transforming, and reevaluating Friedrich’s art. Relying on the tradition of German romanticism, Mattheuer developed a new genre of Socialist landscape representation comprising both important artworks and tools of critique.\n\nIn 1956, Diego Rivera (1886-1957) visited the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and was appointed as corresponding member of the Academy of Arts, Berlin for his lifetime achievements. When in East Berlin, he was asked to create some murals for the then still partly destroyed capital of the GDR, but neither Rivera nor the other two of Los Tres Grandes –Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros (1896-1974), and José Clemente Orozco (1883-1949)– ever executed a mural in Germany. However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Spanish artist Josep Renau (1907-82), who was exiled in Mexico after the Spanish Civil War for about twenty years from 1939 onwards, brought his theoretical and practical experiences with Mexican Muralismo to the GDR. This paper presents Renau’s \"Futuro Trabajador del Comunismo\", an unexecuted Project for a Berlin mural of 1969,2 deeply inspired and influenced by the Mexican mural movement. I will explain the mural within the artistic and historical background of the so-called era of the scientific-technical revolution of the 1960s, in which there was a belief in an unlimited progress in science and technique. My text analyzes for the first time hitherto unknown archival records from Renau’s archive on the history of the mural and its failure."
