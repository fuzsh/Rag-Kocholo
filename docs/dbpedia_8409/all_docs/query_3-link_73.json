        "text": "This podcast explores the extraordinary life of the Pakistani physicist Abdus Salam, who is celebrated for his ground-breaking theoretical work and for his championing of physics and physicists in developing countries.\n\nIn 1964, he founded the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy – which supports research excellence worldwide with a focus on physicists in the developing world. In 1979 Salam shared the Nobel Prize for Physics for his work on the unification of the weak and electromagnetic interactions.\n\nSalam spent most of his career at Imperial College London and the university is gearing up to celebrate the centenary of his birth in January 2026. In this episode of the Physics World Weekly podcast, Imperial physicists Claudia de Rham and Ian Walmsley look back on the extraordinary life of Salam – who died in 1996. They also talk about the celebrations at Imperial College.\n\nImage courtesy: AIP Emilio Segrè Visual Archives, Physics Today Collection"
