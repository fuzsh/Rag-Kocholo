        "text": "A Dialogue of the Collections Lafrenz, Hamburg, and Daimler, Stuttgart/Berlin\n\nJune 20 – September 21, 2008\n\nOpening Thursday, June 19, 2008, 7 pm\n\nHaus Huth\n\nAlte Potsdamer Straße 5\n\n10785 Berlin\n\nGermany\n\nOpen daily 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., Admission free\n\nwww.collection.daimler.com\n\nThe Daimler Art Collection is pleased to announce the exhibition Private/Corporate V at Daimler Contemporary at Potsdamer Platz in Berlin. Private/Corporate V – a collaboration with Collection Lafrenz, Hamburg – is the fifth in a series of exhibitions initiated in 2002, in which the Daimler Art Collection presents itself in a dialogue with an international private collection once a year. These co-operations have always gone hand in hand with a sense of focus that is typical of each private collector invited to participate and so the holdings of the Collection can be examined from the point of view of a related collecting interest.\n\nThe Lafrenz Collection concentrates on aspects of Minimal and Concept Art, Post Painterly Abstraction, Land Art and Arte Povera. It was established in the 1970s by Dr. Klaus and Rosemarie Lafrenz, and its works lay behind the foundation of the Neues Museum Weserburg Bremen, which is seen as the prototype of the collector’s museum. At the same time, part of the Lafrenz Collection is on permanent loan to the Kunsthalle Hamburg, and has also been shown in various national and international exhibition contexts. As the oldest of the four children, Björn Lafrenz took over continuing and presenting the collection as a private commitment, after his father’s early death. So among other things he is still pursuing the original idea of not concentrating on work series, but on placing individual works by different artists, from the 1960s to the present day – for example Judd, Ryman, Serra, LeWitt, Marden, Mangold, Novros – in new dialogue situations. In the mean time, work by contemporary artists, represented here by Johannes Esper, Frank Gerritz and Liam Gillick, have joined what are mainly American classics – but also German work such as that of Albers, Erben, Palermo\n\nand Ruthenbeck.\n\nThe idea for Private/Corporate V was born in a flash in Hamburg in summer 2007 – after each of the partners had taken a thorough look at the other collection. Björn Lafrenz and Dr. Renate Wiehager, the head of the Daimler Art Department, deliberately chose work by some artists – Gillick, LeWitt, Novros – from both collections. The exhibition starts with a conversation between the ‘fathers’ of Minimal Art – Judd, Ryman, Novros – with the younger artists Gerritz and Gillick. In the main gallery at Daimler Contemporary works by Franz Erhard Walther, Palermo and McCracken – backed by an ‘all-over’ of Minimalist drawings – lay Minimal Art’s analytical relation with space open to physical experience. Private/Corporate V also introduces German exponents of Minimalism – Posenenske and Schene – to a conversation with American pioneers and young artists such as Tom Sachs, Katja Strunz and Jonathan Monk.\n\nThe show comprises over 60 works by some 20 artists, dating from the 1960s to the present day.\n\nParticipating Artists:\n\nFrom the Lafrenz Collection: Josef Albers (D), Markus Amm (D), Carl Andre (USA), Alan Charlton (UK), Johannes Esper (D), Frank Gerritz (D), Liam Gillick (GB), Donald Judd (USA), Sol LeWitt (USA), Brice Marden (USA), John McCracken (USA), David Novros (USA), Blinky Palermo (D), Robert Ryman (USA).\n\nFrom the Daimler Art Collection: Markus Amm (D), Hanne Darboven (D), Liam Gillick (GB), Hermann Glöckner (D), Sol LeWitt (USA), Jonathan Monk (GB), David Novros (USA), Charlotte Posenenske (D), Peter Roehr (D), Tom Sachs (USA), Eckhard Schene (D), Jan J. Schoonhoven (NL), Katja Strunz (D), Franz Erhard\n\nWalther (D).\n\nPrivate/Corporate V is accompanied by a comprehensive program, including artist talks, lectures and discussions with represented artists as well as thematic guided tours: These tours are available on every first Saturday of a month at 4 p.m. (July 05 / Aug 02 / Sept 06, 2008).
