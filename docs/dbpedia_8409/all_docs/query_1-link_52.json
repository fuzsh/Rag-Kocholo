        "text": "Episode No. 329 of The Modern Art Notes Podcast features curators Lynette Roth and Mazie Harris.\n\nRoth is the curator of “Inventur — Art in Germany, 1943-55,” which is at the Harvard Art Museums through June 3. It is the first exhibition to examine art made in Germany by artists who stayed in Germany throughout World War II. “Inventur” presents more than 160 works made by 50 artists, art made when Germans were forced to acknowledge and address the war, the Holocaust, their defeat and occupation by the Allies, and the beginning of the Cold War. The fascinating exhibition catalogue, which is full of new discoveries and analysis, was published by Yale University Press. Amazon offers it for $55.\n\nRoth, the curator of the Busch-Reisinger Museum and the head of modern and contemporary art at HAM, was previously a guest on Episode No. 192, when she discussed her catalogue of the Saint Louis Art Museum’s Max Beckmann collection.\n\nOn the second segment, J. Paul Getty Museum curator Mazie Harris discusses “Paper Promises: Early American Photography,” which is at the Getty from Tuesday, February 27 through May 27. The exhibition examines why daguerreotypes-loving Americans were so much slower to embrace paper photography than other nations, and what prompted the belated switch. The terrific catalogue for the exhibition is full of surprising history and is published by the Getty. Amazon lists it at $50."
