        "text": "Drawing Room is pleased to present A moving plan B – chapter ONE, a group exhibition selected by Thomas Scheibitz, one of Germany’s most important contemporary artists. While providing insight into the working processes of the artist, the exhibition will also expose rare and unseen works by a wide range of international creators.\n\nA moving plan B – chapter ONE reveals the motivation and inspiration behind Thomas Scheibitz’s paintings, sculptures and works on paper and introduces various approaches to drawing as used by artists, architects, film-makers and writers over the past 50 years. The exhibition will include sketches, drawings, notes and working journals not usually available for public viewing.\n\nDrawing occupies a very important position within the working processes of Scheibitz, providing the connecting link between the idea and its execution. He is interested in how creators of different disciplines use drawing and sketches to transport personal ideas and thought processes into the public domain. In his own work Scheibitz draws inspiration from a wide range of sources including films, literature, music, art history and visual details that he encounters in daily life. These are harnessed through the camera, sketch-book and cuttings from printed material. A process of sketching and drawing transforms this visual material into the lexicon of forms that inhabit his paintings and sculptures.\n\nScheibitz has selected drawings that possess autonomy and convey meaning beyond the often very constrained and specific conditions within which they were made. All of the works display an attention to materials and form that distinguish his own practice.\n\nAs well as artists of his own generation – Dirk Bell, Tacita Dean, Thomas Demand, Mathew Hale, Manfred Pernice, Andreas Slominski and Peter Stauss – Scheibitz has also selected those of an older generation born in East Germany – Carl Friedrich Claus, Hermann Glöckner, Manfred Kuttner, A.R. Penck and Eugene Schönebeck. Sketches and drawings from those working beyond the fine arts such as the Yugoslavian architect Bogdan Bogdanovich (b.1922) and the German writer Arno Schmidt (1914-79) provide an insight into the artists eclectic interests.. Öyvind Fahlström (b.Brazil 1928,d.Sweden 1976) and the structuralist film-maker Paul Sharits (USA, 1943-93) will also be included."
