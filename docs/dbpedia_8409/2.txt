Hermann Glöckner dissolved the strict boundaries of genres early on, made everyday objects artistic, playfully jumped between surface and space, between painting and sculpture. Glöckner belongs to the generation that shows a historical continuity in European art, that directly connects post-war art with modern art and reaches into the present. (E.W., J.D.)
