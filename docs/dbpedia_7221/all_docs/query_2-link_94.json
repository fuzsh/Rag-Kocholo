        "meta_description": "Nephew Tommy House Party Comedy Jam at the Miller Theater on Friday, September 6. Thomas “Nephew Tommy” Miles has built a career encompassing radio, television, film, and more. Thomas’ role as co-host of the nationally syndicated Steve Harvey Morning Show puts him in front of a live radio audience of more than 8 million listeners daily. As Nephew Tommy, he provides a vital role in the morning show, perhaps best known for his prank calls and lighting it up with his cast of colorful characters. Thomas also has a loyal following as a stand-up comedian and has earned a reputation for wowing crowds. For three years, he served as the exclusive opening act on the Luther Vandross tour. In addition, Thomas served as the exclusive Mainstage host for the Essence Festival in New Orleans for seven years, which draws over 250,000 fans and features acts such as Beyonce, Janet Jackson, Alicia Keys, Mary J. Blige, Usher, and Kanye West. Thomas also hosted the “Time To Laugh” event at Bishop T.D. Jakes Megafest.  Thomas recorded his one-hour special at the famed Motor City Casino in Detroit. He continues to keep the crowds laughing as he tours nationally to sold-out crowds across the country. He’s a talented thespian who studied theatre at Texas A&M University, has worked in over a dozen stage plays, and studied with the Royal Shakespeare Company of London. In addition, several films are on his resume, including “N-Secure” and “The Heart Specialist” with Zoe Saldana; David Talbert’s “Baggage Claim;” “Think Like A Man” he also made a cameo appearance in Tyler Perry’s “Madea’s Halloween.” Thomas is currently in production as he approaches season eight as the host of the Oprah Winfrey Network’s hit dating show “Ready to Love,” produced by one of Hollywood’s blockbuster hit makers, Will Packer. He also returns to host the Black College Quiz Show for the fourth season; the purpose of the Black College Quiz game show series is to encourage an appreciation of African-American Heritage by all people in an entertaining quiz show format. Thomas traveled to over a dozen military bases in the Middle East with the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff USO Holiday Tour, where he shared his humor, insight, and wisdom with thousands of military men and women. This interaction with soldiers, stateside and around the world, inspired Thomas to establish “Miles of Giving,” a non-profit foundation created to assist wounded veterans. Whether on the stage, big screen, television, or radio, Thomas “Nephew Tommy” Miles continues to demonstrate his remarkable talent to the delight of audiences worldwide.
