        "text": "When it comes to popular TV show formats, nothing beats shows about doctors. And it's obvious why. The medical profession lends itself to drama. Doctors deal with heart-pounding life-and-death situations every day of the week. It feels more realistic, too: while it's somewhat ridiculous for an ongoing detective show to revolve around murder after murder every week (although some do), people are always being rushed to hospital.\n\nIllness and death are something we're all scared of but watching them happen in the comfort of our home on our TV screen, well, that allows us to deal with them in a way that doesn't affect us personally. What follows are 10 of the best medical shows on TV ever, based on ratings, awards and longevity. A list of 10, however, will inevitably leave some shows, perhaps your favorites, out. So let us list the ones that were great, but didn't make the list of 10. Our runners up: Marcus Welby, M.D., Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, and Medical Center.\n\n10. Dr. Kildare/Ben Casey (tie)\n\nThese two shows harkened in the birth of popular, mainstream doctor-as-hero shows. Up to the early 1960s, TV ratings were dominated by westerns, like Wagon Train and, of course, Bonanza. Then along came Dr. Kildare, a series based on the popular movies, and starring the strikingly handsome Richard Chamberlain. About the same time another network aired its own medical show, Ben Casey. Here was the \"anti-Kildare.\" Casey, as portrayed by Vince Edwards was a brilliant surgeon but a bit gruff (with a heart of gold of course). Sound familiar? Casey was Dr. House before there was a Dr. House. Both shows were ratings winners and made stars of their lead actors.\n\nVital signs (Kildare):\n\nYears ran: 1961-1966\n\nStar: Richard Chamberlain, Raymond Massey\n\nAwards: 9 nominations, 2 wins, including Best Actor (Chamberlain)\n\nVital signs (Ben Casey):\n\nYears ran: 1961-1966\n\nStar: Vince Edwards, Sam Jafee\n\nAwards: 14 nominations, 3 awards\n\n9. Nurse Jackie\n\nEdie Falco had just left The Sopranos, when she landed this role as a nurse with a bucketload of personal problems. One of SHOWTIME's most popular original series ever, Jackie Peyton, an overworked RN, got through her days on drugs, which made each story either dramatic, comedic or both, often at the same time. The show ended its run this past June.\n\nVital signs:\n\nYears ran: 2009-2015\n\nStar: Edie Falco\n\nAwards: Falco won an Emmy for Best Actress in 2010; Show has had 79 nominations for various awards and won 13, including Falco's Emmy.\n\n8. Nip/Tuck\n\nA medical drama that is as sharp as a surgeon's scalpel. The insidious adventures, often sexual, of two plastic surgeons, with South Florida and Beverly Hills practices as backdrop. Watching it, you often didn't know if it was satire or drama; maybe best to call it dramedy. Through the years you were treated to several star turns (satire, Ms. Rivers?) as viewers joyfully watched the wretched personal lives of two very successful business partners, and surgeons.\n\nVital signs:\n\nYears ran: 2003-2010\n\nStars: Dylan Walsh, Joley Richardson, with notable guest stars, including Joan Rivers\n\nAwards: 50 nominations, 10 wins, including program of the year. Emmy and Golden Globe award winner.\n\n7. Scrubs\n\nScrubs follows the story of John Michael \"J.D.\" Dorian as he begins his medical career at Sacred Heart Hospital. The show occasionally veers into more serious or dramatic storylines, and has earned praise for the accuracy of both its medicine and its depiction of the early-career experience. At its core, however, Scrubs strives for bizarre, even absurd comedy first and foremost, and places detailed depictions of medical practice much further down on the priority list.\n\nVital signs:\n\nYears ran: 2001-201\n\nStar: Zach Braff, with guest appearances by Brendan Fraser, Heather Graham, and Colin Farrell.\n\nAwards: 117 nominations and 31 wins, including lead acting by Braff\n\n6. St. Elsewhere\n\nSt. Elsewhere enjoyed great popularity in the 1980s, in no small part thanks to a star-studded cast. Show alumni include Denzel Washington, Howie Mandel, David Morse, and Mark Harmon. The show drew both praise and criticism for the twist at the very end of its final episode, but its impact on popular culture endures to this day in the form of a popular theory that suggests that hundreds of television shows share its universe.\n\nVital signs:\n\nYears ran: 1982-1988\n\nStar: Ed Begley Jr., William Daniels, Howie Mandel, Denzel Washington, Mark Harmon\n\nAwards: 83 nominations, 24 wins, including Outstanding Drama (Emmy) and Best Actor (Daniels, an Emmy).\n\n5: General Hospital\n\nYou mean you've never seen an episode of this long-running afternoon soap opera? Or you've never heard of Luke and Laura? Where have you been the last 50 years? Like most soap operas, this one had its share of murders, marriages, mistresses and general all around mayhem. But what really stands out are the number of big stars who got their start on GH. And Elizabeth Taylor, who was such a fan that she signed up for a series of guest appearances as one of the key characters in a story arc.\n\nVital signs:\n\nYears ran: 1963- present\n\nStar: Demi Moore, John Stamos, Elizabeth Taylor, Ricky Martin, Kristin Davis, Mark Hamill, Rick Springfield, Richard Dean Anderson, Genie Francis, Jack Wagner,\n\nAwards: 494 nominations, 246 wins including many best actress, best show, best actor awards.\n\n4. Grey's Anatomy\n\nThere was no stopping Grey's Anatomy when it first aired in 2005. Ratings and awards were a given. Women swooned over McDreamy (Dempsey)â¦but the core of the show were the women doctors, strong, sexy and very smart. Yes, the show is a soap opera of sorts, and a long running one at that. But despite cast changes, the show rolls on, still popular, still ground-breaking.\n\nVital signs:\n\nYears ran: 2005-present\n\nStar: Ellen Pompeo, Patrick Dempsey, Katherine Heigl, Jeffery Dean Morgan, Chris O'Donnell\n\nAwards: 172 nominations, 61 wins, including best drama and best actress\n\n3. MASH\n\nA classic, in every sense of the word. Based on the Robert Altman movie of the same name, no one could have expected the TV series to even approach the popularity of the flick, which was a not so veiled criticism of war in general, and the Vietnam War in particular (though the TV show took place in Korea). But it did. Alan Alda, already a star, became a mega star as the wise cracking surgeon, using his wits to remain sane in a blood soaked makeshift operating room. Radar, Hot Lipsâ¦what great characters. These are shows that never grow old.\n\nVital signs:\n\nYears ran: 1972-1983\n\nStar: Alan Alda, Wayne Rogers, Loretta Swit\n\nAwards: 153 nominations (Golden Globes, Emmy) and 61wins, including Best Comedy, Best Actor (Alda)\n\n2. House\n\nYou may fight us on this one. Many critics think that House is the best medical show ever, and that would be hard to deny. The original pitch was simple: Sherlock Holmes as doctor who solves mysterious cases every week. So far, so good. But the way actor Hugh Laurie played the character broke all the rules. How many drug addicted, grumpy, rude genius doctors become heroes and star in a long running TV show? House was never likeable, but the shows were brilliantly written and acted. A show for the ages.\n\nVital signs:\n\nYears ran: 2004-2012\n\nStar: Hugh Laurie, Olivia Wilde, Sela Ward, Chi McBride\n\nAwards: 116 nominations (Golden Globes, Emmy) and 53 wins, including Best Drama, Best Actor (Laurie, 2006,2007)\n\n1. E.R.\n\nRemember E.R.? It ruled the airwaves for 15 years, with its mix of drama, comedy, and angst, set in a large city emergency room. And the starsâ¦ George Clooney became a mega star based on his work in ER. Julianne Margulies (she of The Good Wife) as well, was introduced to the world. Created by best-selling author Michael Crichton, ER was more than about just love and lives gained and lost. It was must see-TV at the very highest level of artistic achievement."
