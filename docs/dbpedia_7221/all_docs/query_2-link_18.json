        "text": "1922 film by Frank John Urson\n\nThe Heart SpecialistDirected byFrank UrsonWritten byHarvey ThewStory byMary MorrisonProduced byRealart PicturesStarringMary Miles MinterCinematographyAllen M. DaveyDistributed byParamount Pictures\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n5 reelsCountryUnited StatesLanguageSilent (English intertitles)\n\nThe Heart Specialist is a 1922 American silent romantic comedy film directed by Frank Urson and starring Mary Miles Minter and Allan Forrest. It was adapted by Harvey Thew from a story by Mary Morrison.[1] As with many of Minter's features, it is thought to be a lost film.[2]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAs described in various film magazine reviews,[3][4][5] Rosalie Beckwith (Minter) works for a New York newspaper, editing a column devoted to romance. When her editor (Mathis) threatens to dismiss her on the grounds that romance does not exist, Rosalie bets her job that she can find romance within forty miles of the newspaper office.\n\nArriving at a small town chosen at random, Rosalie is mistaken for Muriel Murat Bey, the cousin and heir of Bob Stratton (Forrest), a wealthy but wounded and ailing war veteran. Accepting this misidentification, Rosalie moves in to Stratton's estate, where she rapidly falls for the wounded veteran, and also incurs the enmity of family physician Dr. Fitch (Beery). Fitch has been systematically embezzling Stratton's funds and now, fearing discovery, he plots to kill him.\n\nWhen Rosalie discovers that Fitch is attempting to poison Stratton, Fitch decides to dispose of her. He throws her down a well, and introduces his sister Grace (Phillips) as the \"real\" Muriel Murat Bey. Rosalie however escapes from the well, and before Stratton can eat the poisoned food that Fitch has prepared for him, she reveals the plot. The Fitches are arrested, and, although she has won her wager along with Stratton's heart, Rosalie chooses to leave her newspaper column behind for a real romance with Stratton.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMary Miles Minter as Rosalie Beckwith\n\nAllan Forrest as Bob Stratton\n\nRoy Atwell as Winston Gates\n\nJack Mathis as City Editor\n\nNoah Beery as Dr. Thomas Fitch\n\nJames Neill as Fernald\n\nCarmen Phillips as Grace Fitch\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
