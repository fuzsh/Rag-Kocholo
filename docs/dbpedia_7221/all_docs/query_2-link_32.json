        "text": "The new comedy film titled The Heart Specialist which stars Wood Harris, Zoe Saldana and Brian White just to name a few is doing better than predicted for an independent film.\n\nWe hear that the film which has only been out for 2 weeks has already approached the 1 million dollar mark and is sure to be a hit when it hits the DVD market. Not bad for a film that had no major studio behind it at all. Anyway, here is the clip of the film- make sure you see it!"
