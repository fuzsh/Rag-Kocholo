Get ready for some heart-stopping, jaw-dropping comedy when the hilarious romantic indie film THE HEART SPECIALIST drops onto Blu-ray and DVD on October 4 from Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment.

White, “Men of a Certain Age”), a young Harvard Medical School graduate, arrives for his internship at a hospital in South Florida to pursue his ex-girlfriend Valerie (Grammy Award®-winner Mya, Chicago) who can’t forgive his womanizing ways. When his supervisor, Dr. Sidney Zachary (NAACP Image Award®-nominee Wood Harris, “The Wire”), discovers that Ray has put the moves on his own girlfriend, nurse Donna (BET Award®-winner Zoe Saldana, Avatar, Star Trek), the two conspire with the rest of the hospital staff, patients, and friends to teach Ray a lesson—not just about medicine, but also about true love.
