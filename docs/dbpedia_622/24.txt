Zhejiangosaurus (meaning "Zhejiang lizard") is an extinct genus of nodosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian stage) of Zhejiang, eastern China. It was first named by a group of Chinese and Japanese authors Junchang Lü, Xingsheng Jin, Yiming Sheng and Yihong Li in 2007 and the type species is Zhejiangosaurus lishuiensis ("from Lishui", Chinese administrative unit on which the fossil was found). It has no diagnostic features, and thus is a nomen dubium.
