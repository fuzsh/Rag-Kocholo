I wasn't able to show you another shelves before now, too much other things to do first and this kind of topic needs more work than a \"what's new\" or a walkaround.\n\nThe 1/25 (or 1/24) scale is a classic in the toy world, and was widely used officially in Germany in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nWith 99 inhabitants, it's the 5th most populated floor in my mainstream collection.\n\nThis is a pivotal scale for me, from here on and beyond, models of extinct species will occupy more space, both in number and size. For the 1/25, they only represent a quarter of the total, but that's not bad for a collector as unspecialised as me.\n\nLet's begin our journey as usual, with Africa\n\nSouth Africa: CollectA white rhino, Takara Tomy Lion and Meerkat\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nKenya savannah: Mojo White rhino calf, Eikoh White rhino, CollectA Giraffe, Colorata African wild dog and Yujin Warthog\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nLiberia: Preiser Buffalo,used as a Sudan buffalo, Play Visions Spotted hyena, Starlux Goliath heron and Starlux Jentink's duiker.\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nOuganda marsh: Eikoh Shoebill and Warthog, Nayab Crocodile and Play Visions Sitatunga.\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nBecause I didn’t want to let the poor lemur alone, my African and Malagasy Primates tribe: Kaiyodo Black-and-white ruffed lemur and Lowland gorilla, Bandai Chimps.\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nEurope: Starlux Otter, Hausser elastolin Alpine ibex, Otter, Pine matter and Brown bears, Schleich Moose.\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nSouth-east Asia: Marx Elephant, Schleich Malayan tapir, Milelire and Safari Ltd Sumatran rhinos, Divartsity Greater mouse deer, Kaiyodo Komodo dragon and Milelire Siamang.\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nChina: Kaiyodo and Colorata Giant pandas, Bandai Red pandas\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nIndia: Eikoh Black panther, Colorata Asiatic lion,Safari ltd Indian rhino, yujin Indian star tortoise, Schleich Indian rhino calf, Colorata Sloth bear\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nJapan: Kaiyodo Ryukyu wild boar, Hokkaido wolf and Yezo sika deer, Ikimon Japanese hares\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nSouth America: Kaiyodo Capybara, Jaguar and Giant anteater, Colorata Spectacled bear.\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nHausser Polar bear (who needs a repaint) and Safari Ltd walrus\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nOceania: Bandai Koalas and Western grey kangaroo pair, Ikimon Red kangaroo, Preiser Dromedary and calf, Takara Tomy Thylacine.\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nAbove the Pacific ocean: Colorata Sea otter and Kaiyodo Laysan Albatross.\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nBelow the seas: Kaiyodo Emperor penguin, Long snouted lancetfish and Blacktip reef shark, CollectA Pygmy sperm whale, Short-finned pilot whale and Blainville's beaked whale, Colorata Humphead wrasse and Yujin Loggerhead sea turtle.\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nSome comparison pics maybe ?\n\nCamels\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nDeers\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nCrocs\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nSome \"giants\"\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nHorned gang\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nHorns and Tuscks\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nBears\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nHunters\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nRhinos\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nThyreophorans\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nYou know, I'm really into these topics!\n\nIt's incredible how small the figures representing animals smaller than wolves are.\n\nFor instance, a fox at this scale appears tiny, yet you can still depict martens, meerkats, and so on.\n\nIt's interesting that there isn't a single Noah's Pals which is known for working at this scale.\n\nAlso no Papo among extant animals but, these figures other major brands make at 1:24 scale, Papo tends to make them larger, namely the moose. Birds always look too big in your picture groups, I don't know if it is the way they are measured in real that promote a wrong perception or more likely it is my perception of their sizes which is adulterated.\n\n_________________\n\n~ Rogério [You must be registered and logged in to see this image.] [You must be registered and logged in to see this link.]\n\nThanks to vintage or Japanese manufacturers, you can find tiny animals for small scales, there are even smaller-scale foxes.\n\nMake no mistake, some Papos are too big for 1/25, but others, like elephants, are too small.\n\nAs for birds, the Goliath Heron is the world's largest heron, reaching 1.50 m in height, as is the shoebill, while the Emperor Penguin can reach 1.20 m. The Laysan albatross has a wingspan of 2m. The Copepteryx titan has an estimated length of two meters.\n\nI had quite a few Noah's Pals when I first started out, but I let them all go because I didn't like the style that much. Today, all I have still are platypus, marabou storks and skunks. I'm waiting for a pair of jackals...\n\nAs for the famous 1/25, I don't trust Noah's Pals any more than any other manufacturer. The Maiasaura that Kaiyodo concocted for us in the 90s is reputed to be 1/35, whereas it's actually 1/25 for a 9m animal.\n\nAnd we all have preconceived ideas about the size of animals. For example, we imagine many dinosaurs to be extravagantly large but, for example, Nasutoceratops are actually smaller than white rhinoceros.\n\nIt's the same for me Jolie, I sometimes forget how big or small are these animals actually are. Thats' why I like very much that exercise.\n\nAlain, Miragaia are not longer than 6m long with a lot of neck and tail in these 6m. It's not a big dino, just like the Nasutoceratops, Zhejiangosaurus and Pinacosaurus. For a long time, we were led to believe that all dinosaurs were gigantic beasts, with a few exceptions. Even though we now know that there were many small dinosaurs, we can't help imagining the Tanks and other ceratopsians to be bigger than they actually are.\n\nSometimes it's even the manufacturers who mislead us. For example, Kaiyodo claims that its Maiasaura is at 1/35 scale, when in fact it's at 1/25 scale for a beautiful 9m animal. At 1/35 it would measure over 12m, which was not the case.\n\nInostrancevia was the biggest gorgonopsian known with a total lenght between 3m and 3.5m, it dwarves even a 2.5m long Polar bear\n\nBlaine, even though you're not sensitive to scale, you go to great efforts to inform us in your Museum\n\nYes, regarding the Papo figures, I was exclusively referring to models that other brands usually place near this scale, and Papo's counterparts are usually larger. But it's not a rule, as nothing is a rule when it comes to scales and major brands.\n\nAbout birds, I tend to perceive them as always smaller. I remember my shock when I saw a simple white stork near me, not to mention an ostrich that escaped from the circus and stopped quite close to me. Also, during demonstrations with birds of prey, I'm always surprised to see that the wingspan of the birds clearly exceeds the size of the humans handling them. All of this makes presentations with figures at the same scale even more interesting.\n\n_________________\n\n~ Rogério [You must be registered and logged in to see this image.] [You must be registered and logged in to see this link.]\n\nKikimalou wrote:\n\nHunters\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nRhinos\n\n[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]\n\nso many wonderful photos to study Christophe! I bet it took you a long time to lay them all out and get the angles just right for photographing?? But I bet it was fun though?\n\nI really love your scale topic as well. I always learn so much and I am amazed at all the figures that are 1/25. I have quite a few of them as well so was surprised and delighted to see them here at this scale.\n\nOfcourse it's always an interesting journey to work out what will and won't fit into my scale collection and sometimes I have models that are bigger, or smaller than normal.\n\nStill, I was surprised - is the hyena actually bigger than a wolf? I always thought wolves were massive animals! haha, maybe I've seen too many wilderness movies\n\nAnd I just LOVE the photo with the 2 baby rhinos side by side! These models are really beautiful.\n\nI think they will fit into my rhino creche as well.\n\nYes Annette, it takes along time to produce pics for such a topic, that's why I can't do one every week. Work, the necessities of life and family life obviously come before photo shoots.\n\nI can only do it when I have enough free time. This week I was off work, I had planned to take care of the garden, but it rained like a cow is pissing almost every day... What luck, I was able to devote myself to this topic !\n\nGetting the angles just right for photographing is a big part of the sport. To be able to compare the size of animals as big as or bigger than us most effectively, the camera should ideally be placed at human eye level. At 1/25 this means that the center of the lens is between 6.5 and 7cm from the ground. For smaller animals, try to position the camera at their average eye level.\n\nThe problem is that when there are a lot of animals to compare, or when they're roughly the same size, the advice I've just given no longer works, because you can't distinguish one animal from another. In this case, you need to raise the camera above the mix.\n\nChoosing the right angle is always a compromise between these two rules.\n\nThis means that for each photo, I must try to arrange the animals as harmoniously as possible, and also try to respect rule n°1 as best I can. Sometimes I have to make several attempts. It also means that for each photo I have to adjust the height of my photographic tripod.\n\nThat's the most physical part of the job, after which all that's left for me to do is spend my time doing lab work on my computer, drinking too much coffee or tea. But I suppose, Annette, you know all that too.\n\nAbout wolves and hyenas, Hokkaido wolves stood 70 to 80 cm at the withers, Spotted hyena stood 70 to 91.5 cm. What's more, the PV Hyena stands erect on its paws, while the Kaiyodo wolf bends down slightly as if on the hunt."
