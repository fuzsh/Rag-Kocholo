        "text": "\"A new, small ankylosaurid, Ahshislepelta minor, from the upper Campanian Kirtland Formation (Hunter Wash Member), San Juan Basin, New Mexico, consists of shoulder girdle and forelimb elements, vertebral fragments, and numerous osteoderms. Ahshislepelta minor differs from other ankylosaurids on the basis of a prominent dorsolateral overhang of the acromion and its osteoderm texture. It ranks as one of the most complete ankylosaur specimens known from New Mexico and adds to our understanding of ankylosaurid paleobiogeography, stratigraphy, and taxonomy.\"\n\nIsolated bones and osteoderms of ankylosaurian dinosaurs recovered from Late Cretaceous sediments of northern Coahuila, northeastern Mexico, have been identified as remains of nodosaurids. Here, we summarize these discoveries and provide a review on Mexican Ankylosauria from a taxonomic perspective. We also present a new taxon, Acantholipan gonzalezi gen. et sp. nov. from the Pen Formation and provide a phylogenetic analysis integrating the new taxon. A. gonzalezi is the first named ankylosaur from Mexico that adds to the currently rare nodosaurid diversity from southern Laramidia.\n\nNodosaurid ankylosaur remains from the Upper Cretaceous of Mexico are summarized. The specimens are from the El Gallo Formation of Baja California, and the Pen and Aguja Formations of northwestern Coahuila, Mexico. These specimens show significant differences from other known nodosaurids, including ulna with very well developed olecranon and prominent humeral notch, the distal end of the femur not flaring to the extent seen in other nodosaurids, and a horn-like spine with vascular grooves on one side. The specimens are important because they are the southern-most occurrences in North America, and provide an important biogeographical link between nodosaurids of the United States and Canada on the one hand, and Argentina and Antarctica on the other.\n\nFossil evidences of the presence of ankylosaurian dinosaurs in Gondwana are scarce but consistent, being found in Antarctica, Oceania and South America. In spite that there are no nominated species in South America, the ankylosaur fossil record has increased in the last years. Indeterminate nodosaurid specimens, some isolated osteoderms and many trackways are known from the Upper Cretaceous of South America. The aim of the present contribution is to report new ankylosaurian remains from the Allen Formation (Campanian-Maastrichtian) at the Salitral Moreno locality, Northern Patagonia, Argentina. These osteoderms are small and conical, and includes thoracic, sacral and caudal scutes. The thoracic and sacral pieces are similar to those belonging to nodosaurids. The caudal osteoderm is a new element for the record of South American ankylosaurs. It resembles the caudal plates of Kunbarrasaurus and some ankylosaurids. The scutes show a mixture of characters so it is not possible to assign these pieces to a nodosaurid-like or ankylosaurid ankylosaur. These elements are consistent with the previously known ankylosaur fossil record of the Upper Cretaceous of Argentina, being a new sample of the diversity of the latest Cretaceous from South America."
