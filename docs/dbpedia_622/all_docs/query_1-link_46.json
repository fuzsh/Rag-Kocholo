        "text": "摘要:At 08:02 on April 20, 2013, a Ms7.0 earthquake occurred in Lushan, Ya’an, in the Longmenshan fault zone, Sichuan. The epicenter was located between Taiping Town and Shuangshi Town, Lushan County and the maximum earthquake intensity at the epicenter reached class IX. Field investigations in the epicenter area found that, although buildings were seriously damaged, no obvious surface rupture structure was produced, only some ground fissures and sand blows and water ejection phenomena being seen. An integrated analysis of high-resolution remote sensing image interpretation, mainshock and aftershock distribution, and focal mechanism solutions indicated that this earthquake was an independent rupturing event in the southwestern segment of the Longmenshan fault zone, belonging to the thrust-type earthquake. Ruptures occurred along the south-central segment of the Shuangshi-Dachuan fault and the principal rupture plane dipped SW at 33–43°. It is inferred that the Lushan earthquake might be related to the ramp activity of the basal detachment zone (13–19 km) of the Longmenshan fault zone. Historically, there occurred at least two Ms6-6.5 earthquakes along the Shuangshi-Dachuan fault zone; thus it is thought that the Lushan earthquake, different from the Wenchuan earthquake, was a characteristic one in the southwestern segment of the Longmenshan fault zone. In-situ stress measurements indicated the Lushan earthquake was the result of stress release of the southwestern segment of the Longmenshan fault zone after the Wenchuan earthquake. This paper analyzes the tectonic setting of the seismogenic structure of this earthquake.\n\n摘要:Geohazards induced by the Lushan Ms 7.0 earthquake on April 20, 2013 mainly have four types: collapse, landslide, slope debris flow, and sand-soil liquefaction. These geohazards mainly occurred near the epicenter, on steep slopes or below cliffs in high mountain and deep valley areas, and at or near fault ends. They have no obvious relationships to active faults, but their relationships to the weathering degree and structures of rock and rock mass are obvious. Compared with the Wenchuan Ms 8.0 earthquake on May 12, 2008, the Lushan earthquake is relatively little in the impact force and the throwing amount. All of these should be related to the magnitude of this earthquake, not very large but not very little. This character of the Lushan earthquake would make some processes uncompleted so as to bring about some concealed geohazards. Finally, in order to deal with challenges presented by such conceal geohazards, some brief recommendations are put forward.\n\n摘要:Dongyangopelta yangyanensis gen. et sp. nov. from the Chaochuan Formation (Albian - Cenomanian) of Dongyang, Zhejiang Province, China is characterized: the convex anterior surface of the first presacral rod centrum strongly inflates laterally and slightly curves posteriorly; the fused pelvic shield composes of larger pebble-shaped bosses, defined by smaller tubercles or flat stretches of bone; most osteoderms are heavily roughened with notches and grooves for dermal attachment along the edge; domed triradiate osteoderm is present; sigmoid curvature of the dorsal surface of the ilium is present; the preacetabular process curves lateroventrally at the anterior end and has a shallow groove in the edge of the lateral and anterior ends and strong lateromedial expansion of the distal femur. The femoral head is well separated from the greater trochanter, indicating that Dongyangopelta is a nodosaurid ankylosaur, the second from southeast China. Phylogenetic analysis also positions this taxon in the Nodosauridae clade. Dongyangopelta differs from Zhejiangosaurus in the characters of presacral rod, ilium, and femur. Dongyangopelta represents the first ankylosaur outside North America and Europe that definitively possesses a pelvic shield with fused armor.\n\n摘要:Based on the systematic study of two fossil skeleton specimens collected from the top of the third member of the marine Lower Triassic Jialingjiang Formation of Yuanan, Hubei Province, South China, a new Early Triassic primitive ichthyosaur Chaohusaurus zhangjiawanensis sp. nov. is reported and described. The beds yielding the type material are correlated with the Neospathodus homeri–N. triangularis Conodont zone. The new taxon is most similar to Chaohusaurus geishanensis Young and Dong, 1972 in the shape and configuration of the scapula, forefin, pelvic girdle and hindfin, presacral vertebral count and well-developed caudal peak, but distinguished from the latter by its larger size, the position of the pineal foramen in the centre of the parietal, the occurrence of a larger calcaneum in hindfin and the first sacral rib with distal expansion. The new species exhibits common features of primitive ichthyosaurs such as: (1) the prefrontal has an antero-dorsal shelf projecting towards the orbit; (2) the upper temporal fenestra is small; (3) the postorbital and the squamosal meet laterally to the upper temporal fenestra; and (4) cylindrical centra. However, more derived ichthyosaur characters are seen with the frontal separated from the orbital dorsal margin by the contact of the prefrontal and postfrontal, which offer new clues to the early radiation of ichthyosaurs.\n\n摘要:Lindera is a large genus of graceful, pleasantly scented and common native trees and shrubs of southern China and neighboring regions of SE Asia. There is a well-documented Cenozoic fossil record not only in these regions but also from elsewhere. A new fossil leaf record has been found in diatomite beds from the Upper Pliocene Mangbang Formation of Tuantian, Tengchong County, Yunnan. The leaves are identified and assigned to Lindera acuminatissima K. Q. Dao et B. N. Sun sp. nov., by comparing their leaf architecture and epidermal characteristics with those of 51 extant Lauraceae species and with 15 known fossil Lindera taxa. The specimens have well-preserved cuticles, with typical leaf architecture and epidermal characteristics of the Lauraceae, including entire leaf margin, intramarginal veins, basal ternate acrodromous primary veins, one-cell trichome base, paracytic stomatal apparatus, sunken guard cells, subsidiary hardly staining cells and presence of oil cells. These characteristics are consistent with Lindera sect. Daphnidium but are different from reported fossil and extant species of Lindera. The cuticles of Lindera are fragile and delicate with only three Lindera fossils reported based on this tissue. In terms of paleobiogeography, the fossil record indicates that Lindera is distributed in high- to mid-latitude regions of the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene northern hemisphere. Coincidentally, the records of Lindera located on both sides of the Bering Land Bridge possibly support the hypothesis that ancient plants extended via transcontinental exchanges through the Bering Corridor. In the Eocene, ancient Lindera spread to Europe through the Northern Degeer Route and the Southern Thulian Route. At the same time, ancient Lindera spread into Central Asia. Climatic changes and tectonization since the Neogene prevented the propagation of Lindera throughout Asia, North America and Europe, and hence the distribution areas have just regressed to the low-latitude regions in Asia and North America. From the Paleogene to the Neogene, Lindera has changed its distribution by surviving extreme climate changes. Quaternary glaciations ultimately led to Lindera becoming extinct in Europe. The new record from Tengchong, Yunnan, with its lower latitude located in tropical and subtropical regions, indicates that Lindera has lived in those regions since the late Pliocene.\n\n摘要:Based on high-resolution remote sensing image interpretation, digital elevation model 3-D analysis, field geologic field investigation, trenching engineering, and ground-penetrating radar, synthetic research on the evolution of the Yuguang Basin South Margin Fault (YBSMF) in northwest Beijing was carried out. We found that the propagation and growth of faults most often occurred often at two locations: the fault overlapping zone and the uneven or rough fault segment. Through detailed observation and analysis of all cropouts of faults along the YBSMF from zone a to zone i, we identified three major factors that dominate or affect fault propagation and growth. First, the irregularity of fault geometry determine the propagation and growth of the fault, and therefore, the faults always propagate and grow at such irregular fault segments. The fault finally cuts off and eliminates its irregularity, making the fault geometry and fault plane smoother than before, which contributes to the slipping movement of the half-graben block in the basin. Second, the scale of the irregularity of the fault geometry affects the result of fault propagation and growth, that is, the degree of the cutting off of fault irregularity. The degree of cutting off decreases as irregularity scale increases. Third, the maximum possible slip displacement of the fault segment influences the duration of fault propagation and growth. The duration at the central segments with a large slip displacement is longer than that at the end segments with a smaller slippage value.\n\n摘要:Many equiaxial dome-like structures developed in the north segment of the Xuefengshan orocline, Central China are obviously inconcordant with the NE-trending linear structures in this area, which contain important records for understanding the structural framework and evolution of this belt. In this paper, taking one of the typical dome-like structures in the Xuefengshan orcline (e.g. Moping dome-like structure) as an example, based on its structural framework interpratatoin, superposed deformation analysis and paleo-stress fields reconstruction, we propose the Moping dome-like structure is composed of two populations of different-striking thrust-fold structures, ~E-trending and NE-striking structures, indicative of two-stages shortening, ~N- and NW-striking, respectively. Together with the geochronological analysis, we suggest the first stage of shortening occurred in Late Triassic to Early Jurassic, due to the Indosinian intercollisional orogeny of the Yangtze Block and the North China Block. The second occurred during Late Jurassic?Early Cretaceous owing to Yanshanian intracontinental orogeny, leading to the intensive superposition of the NE-trending structures onto the ~E-trending structures, and the final ocurrence of the Moping dome. Thus, our study indicates the Xuefengshan arc-shape belt also experienced two-phase deformation, and resulted from the superposition of NE?SW structures onto ~E–W structures in Late Jurassic?Early Cretaceous, which could provide new structural evidence for probing the Mesozoic tectonic framework and evolution of the Xuefengshan orocline.\n\n摘要:The Late Cretaceous ü?kap?l? Granitoid including mafic microgranular enclaves intruded into metapelitic and metabasic rocks, and overlain unconformably by Neogene ignimbrites in the Ni?de area of Turkey. It is mostly granite and minor granodiorite in composition, whereas its enclaves are dominantly gabbro with a few diorites in composition. The ü?kap?l? Granitoid is composed mainly of quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase, biotite, muscovite and minor amphibole while its enclaves contain mostly plagioclase, amphibole, minor pyroxene and biotite. The ü?kap?l? Granitoid has calcalkaline and peraluminous (A/CNK= 1.0–1.3) geochemical characteristics. It is characterized by high LILE/HFSE and LREE/HREE ratios ((La/Lu)N= 3–33), and has negative Ba, Ta, Nb and Eu anomalies, resembling those of collision granitoids. The ü?kap?l? Granitoid has relatively high 87Sr/86Sr(i) ratios (0.711189–0.716061) and low εNd(t) values (-5.13 to -7.13), confirming crustal melting. In contrast, the enclaves are tholeiitic and metaluminous, and slightly enriched in LILEs (K, Rb) and Th, and have negative Ta, Nb and Ti anomalies; propose that they were derived from a subduction-modified mantle source. Based on mineral and whole rock chemistry data, the ü?kap?l? granitoid is H-(hybrid) type, post-collision granitoid developed by mixing/mingling processes between crustal melts and mantle-derived mafic magmas.\n\n摘要:Authigenic gypsum crystals, along with pyrite and carbonate mineralization, predominantly calcites were noticed in distinct intervals in a 32 m long piston core, collected in the gas hydrate-bearing sediments in the northern portion of the Krishna-Godavari basin, eastern continental margin of India at a water depth of 1691 m. X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive spectrum studies confirm presence of pyrite, gypsum, calcite, and other mineral aggregates. The occurrence of gypsum in such deep sea environment is intriguing, because gypsum is a classical evaporite mineral and is under saturated with respect to sea water. Sedimentological, geochemical evidences point to diagenetic formation of the gypsum due to oxidation of sulphide minerals (i.e. pyrite). Euhedral, transparent gypsum crystals, with pyrite inclusions are cemented with authigenic carbonates, possibly indicating that they were formed authigenically in situ in the gas hydrate-influenced environment due to late burial diagenesis involving sulphate reduction and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Therefore, the authigenic gypsums found in sediments of the Krishna-Godavari and Mahanadi offshore regions could be seen as one of the parameters to imply the presence of high methane flux possibly from gas hydrate at depth.\n\n摘要:Chemoautotrophic organisms have once been excluded from the development of universally applicable CO2 fixation technology due to its low production yields of biomass. In this study, we used Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (A.f.) as a model chemoautotrophic microorganism to test the hypothesis that exogenetic photoelectrons from semiconducting mineral photocatalysis can enable the regeneration of Fe2+ that could be then used by A.f. and support its growth. In a simulated electrochemical system, where exogenetic electrons were provided by an electrochemical approach, an accelerated growth rate of A.f. was observed as compared with that in traditional batch cultivation. In a coupled system, where light-irradiated natural rutile provided the primary electron source to feed A.f., the bacterial growth rate as well as the subsequent CO2 fixation rate was demonstrated to be in a light-dependent manner. The sustaining flow of photogenerated electrons from semiconducting mineral to bacteria provided an inexhaustible electron source for chemoautotrophic bacteria growth and CO2 fixation. This finding might contribute to the development of novel effective CO2 fixation technology.\n\n摘要:The Shenhu gas hydrate drilling area is located in the central Baiyun sag, Zhu II depression, Pearl River Mouth basin, northern South China Sea. The gas compositions contained in the hydrate-bearing zones is dominated by methane with content up to 99.89% and 99.91%. The carbon isotope of the methane (δ13C1) are ?56.7‰ and ?60.9‰, and its hydrogen isotope (δD) are ?199‰ and ?180‰, respectively, indicating the methane from the microbial reduction of CO2. Based on the data of measured seafloor temperature and geothermal gradient, the gas formed hydrate reservoirs are from depths 24–1699 m below the seafloor, and main gas-generation zone is present at the depth interval of 416–1165 m. Gas-bearing zones include the Hanjiang Formation, Yuehai Formation, Wanshan Formation and Quaternary sediments. We infer that the microbial gas migrated laterally or vertically along faults (especially interlayer faults), slump structures, small-scale diapiric structures, regional sand beds and sedimentary boundaries to the hydrate stability zone, and formed natural gas hydrates in the upper Yuehai Formation and lower Wanshan Formation, probably with contribution of a little thermogenic gas from the deep sedments during this process.\n\n摘要:It is important to determine the properties of the tectonics in Cambrian period for the sake of prospecting deep hydrocarbon in the near future in the southern Ordos Kratogen of North China. Authors chose the marginal areas of the southern Ordos basin as the object of research, avoided the effects of both the Qinling Orogenic Belts (QOB) and Weihe River Graben (WRG) whose geological structures are too complicated. By surveying typical Cambrian outcrops and profiles in the basin edges and based on the cores of 57 wells which penetrated the Cambrian in the basin, combined with the seismic profiles, the field gammaray measuement results and the carbon isotope analysis, Authors conclude that the southern margin of the Ordos Kratogen during Cambrian was a passive continental margin which resulted from sea–floor spreading of the Ancient Qinling Ocean. Epicontinental sea carbonate sediments formed in the south Ordos continental margin during Cambrian, and were predominant as tidal flat and o?litic shoal. Both transgression–regression process and the change in palaeostructure have the obvious cyclicity. Using the junction between the late Nangao age of Qiandong epoch and the early Duyun age of Qiandong epoch as a boundary, each had a full transgression cycle at the upper and lower stages. The early cycle is characterized by high energy clastic littoral facies while the late cycle is characterized by carbonate ramp on which clear water and muddy water developed alternately changing to carbonate platform last. During the early stages, An aulacogen was formed in the middle section of the southern margin. The southern Ordos margin was uplifted and denudated by the Huaiyuan Movement which occurred from the late Furongian age to the middle Flolan age and the history of the passive continental margin ended and entering into a new tectonic cycle. The unconformity surface caused by the Huaiyuan Movement, along with its neighborhood areas where dissolved pores and cavities are developed, may be another important district for good hydrocarbon reservoirs (excluding the unconformity surface on the top of the Ordovician in the Ordos basin).\n\n摘要:BSR (Bottom Simulating Reflector) occurs widely in the strata since the late Miocene in the deep-water area of the northern continental slope of South China Sea (SCS). It is an important seismic reference mark which identifies the gas hydrate and its distribution influenced by the tectonic movements. Single-point basin modeling was conducted using 473 points in the study area. To discuss the relationships between the tectonic subsidence and BSR, the volume and rate of tectonic subsidence in each geological time have been simulated. The results show that there are three tectonic accelerate subsidence processes in the study area since the late Miocene, especially since 1.8Ma the tectonic subsidence accelerates more apparently. Since the Late Miocene to Pleistocene, the rate of tectonic subsidence in deep-water underwent a transformation from weak to strong. The ratio of tectonic subsidence to the total subsidence was relatively high (65-70%). Through the superposition of the BSR developed areas and the contours of tectonic subsidence in this area, it was discovered that more than 80% of BSR tend to be distributed at the slope break or depression-uplift structural transfer zone and the average tectonic subsidence rate ranges from 70 m/Ma to 125 m/Ma.\n\n摘要:In order to understand the origin and flow of formation water and to evaluate the hydrocarbon accumulation and preservation conditions, the properties of formation water chemistry and dynamics of the Zhenwu area in the southern Gaoyou Sag, North Jiangsu Basin, China, have been investigated. The results show that Xuzhuang oilfield is infiltrated discontinuously by meteoric water under gravity, which consequently leads to the desalination of formation water. Formation water in the Zhenwu and Caozhuang oilfields is less influenced by meteoric water infiltration, and the origin is interpreted to be connate water. Hydrocarbon migration, accumulation and preservation are closely related to the hydrodynamic field of formation water. Formation water concentrates gradually during the process of centrifugal flow released by mudstone compaction and the centripetal flow of meteoric water infiltration, leading to the high salinity of the central part. The geological conditions of the southern fault–terrace belt are poor for hydrocarbon accumulation and preservation as meteoric water infiltration, leaching and oxidation, while the central part, i.e., northern Zhenwu and Caozhuang oilfields is beneficial for an abundance of hydrocarbon accumulation. Most of the large scale oil–gas fields locate herein.\n\n摘要:Eastern Iran has great potential for the discovery of different types of mineralization. The study area encompasses Tertiary magmatism in the northern Lut block located in northern Khur, South Khorasan, eastern Iran and is mostly covered by volcanic rocks, which are intruded by porphyritic subvolcanic intrusions in some places. Application of the spectral angle mapper (SAM) technique to Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images detected sericitic, argillic, and propylitic alterations, silicification, and secondary iron oxides. The alteration is linear and associated within vein-type mineralization. Twelve prospective areas are selected for detailed exploration and based on our processing results, in addition to NW–SE faults, which are associated with Cu mineralization indications, NE–SW faults are also shown to be important. Based on the presence of subvolcanic rocks and numerous Cu ± Pb-Zn vein-type mineralizations, extensive alteration, high anomaly of Cu and Zn (up to 100 ppm), the age (43.6 to 31.4 Ma) and the initial 87Sr/86Sr ratio (0.7047 to 0.7065) of the igneous rocks, and the metallogenic epoch of the Lut block (middle Eocene–lower Oligocene) for the formation of porphyry Cu and epithermal deposits, the studied area shows great potential for porphyry copper deposits.\n\n摘要:This paper discusses the enrichment and depletion regularities for porphyry copper-molybdenum ore deposits in different regions and varied deposit genetic types in the same area, taking three porphyry copper-molybdenum ore deposits (i.e., the Chengmenshan in Jiangxi, Wunugetushan in Inner Mongolia, Baishantang in Gansu) and two copper deposits in Gansu Province (the Huitongshan skarn deposit and Gongpoquan composite deposit) as case studies. The results show that porphyry Cu-Mo deposits or skarn copper deposits include both enrichment of the ore-forming elements and associated elements, and depletion of some lithophile dispersed elements, rare earth elements (REE) and some major elements. And the depleted elements vary with deposits, having generality and their own features. On a deposit scale, the positive anomalies of enriched elements and negative anomalies of depleted elements follow in a sequence to comprise regular anomaly models of spatial structures. The exploration in the Tongchang deposit in Jiangxi and Huitongshan deposit in Gansu suggests that anomaly models play a key role in the identification of mineral occurrences and deposits compared to one single enriched element anomaly. And the anomaly models exert a critical effect on the optimization of prospecting targets and their potential evaluation.\n\n摘要:An anisotropic geomechanical model for jointed rock mass is presented. Simultaneously with deriving the orthotropic anisotropy elastic parameters along the positive axis, the equivalent compliance matrix for the deflection axis orthotropic anisotropy was derived through a three-dimensional coordinate transformation. In addition, Singh's analysis of the stress concentration effects of intermittent joints was adopted, based on two groups of intermittent joints and a set of cross-cutting joints in the jointed rock mass. The stress concentration effects caused by intermittent joints and the coupling effect of cross-cutting joints along the deflection-axis are also considered. The proposed anisotropic mechanics parameters method is applied to determine the deformation parameters of jointed granite at the Taishan Nuclear Power Station. Combined with the deterministic mechanical parameters of rock blocks and joints, the deformation parameters and their variability in jointed rock masses are estimated quantitatively. The computed results show that jointed granite at the Taishan Nuclear Power Station exhibits typical anisotropic mechanical characteristics; the elastic moduli in the two horizontal directions were similar, but the elastic modulus in the vertical direction was much greater. Jointed rock elastic moduli in the two horizontal and vertical directions were respectively about 24% and 37% of the core of rock, showing weakly orthotropic anisotropy; the ratio of elastic moduli in the vertical and horizontal directions was 1.53, clearly indicating the transversely isotropic rock mass mechanical characteristics. The method can be popularized to solve other rock mechanics problems in nuclear power engineering.\n\n摘要:Identifying the provenance of aeolian sediments in the Hunshandake Sandy Land is of great importance for understanding the formation of the dune fields in the mid-latitudes and for deciphering information about desert’s responses to global change. By determining the major and trace elements concentrations of aeolian sands in three grain size fractions from the central and western parts of the Hunshandake Sandy Land, we systematically study the provenance and the depositional history of aeolian sands in this desert environment. Our results show that aeolian sands from the Hunshandake Sandy Land are enriched in SiO2 and are depleted in many other elements compared to those of the Upper Continent Crust (UCC). Variations of the immobile elements ratios like Zr/Hf, La/Yb, Th/Nb, La/Nb, LaN/YbN, GdN/YbN are relatively large in the coarse and medium fractions but minor in the fine fractions. Eu anomalies are quite different in the coarse fractions, but mostly positive in the medium fractions and all negative in the fine fractions. Decreasing tendency of Zr concentrations from the west to the east in the Hunshandake Sandy Land is evident in the coarse sands but rather weak in the fine grain size fractions. Our geochemical data indicate that the sources for the coarse and medium fractions of aeolian sands are diverse, influenced by local geology and geomorphology, while the fine sand fractions are more homogenous due to intensive mixture mainly by aeolian processes. Various ratios of immobile elements suggest that these sands should be sourced primarily from the surrounding mountains by fluvial/alluvial processes rather than from any remote territories. Aeolian sands with Ce negative anomalies are widely distributed in the Hunshandake Sandy Land, indicating that aquatic environments have occurred extensively prior to the occurrence of the dune field.\n\n摘要:The knowledge of Martian salts has gone through substantial changes during the past decades. In the 70th of last century, Viking landers have noticed the existence of salts on Mars. Several salt species have been suggested from then on, such as sulfates and chlorides. However, their origin was a mystery due to the lack of observations. The recent explorations and related studies at the beginning of this century revealed that the crustal composition of Mars is similar to that of Earth, and it was hypothesized that almost one third of Martian surface was covered by oceans and lakes in the early stage of Mars. The huge water bodies may have dissolved a large quantity of ions from Martian primary rocks during the whole Noachian and Hesperian epoch. After the enormous drought event happened during the late Hesperian and the early Amazonian, these dissolved ions have formed huge salts deposits and most of them were preserved on Mars until today. To date, carbonates, sulfates, chlorides have all been detected by orbital remote sensing and by landers and rovers. However, the salt mineral assemblages on Mars seems to have some differences from those on Earth, e.g., rich in sulfates and lack of massive carbonates. To explain this difference, we propose that most of the surface carbonates precipitated from the ancient oceans may have been dissolved by the later ubiquitous acidic fluids originated from the global volcanism in the Hesperian era, and formed the enormous sulfate deposits as detected, and this hypothesis seems to be supported by the evidence that most of the sulfate deposits distribute around the Tharsis volcanic province while the survived carbonates located far from it. This process can release most of the carbon on Mars to the atmosphere in the form of CO2 and then be erased by the late heavy bombardments, which might have profound influence on the climate change happened in the Hesperian age. The positive correlation between the GRS results of the potassium distributions and the distribution of chlorides on Mars, together with the high Br concentration measured from the evaporate sediments at two Mars exploration rover landing sites, indicate that the brines in the regions where the chlorides deposited may have reached the stage for potassium salts deposition, thus we propose for the first time that potassium salts deposits might be prevalent in these regions."
