        "text": "The Zorralbo locality of the eastern Cameros Basin, near Soria, Spain, has produced a diverse dinosaur assemblage from the Lower Cretaceous Golmayo Formation. Ankylosaurs are represented by dorsal vertebrae and ribs, a fragmentary sacrum and ilium, and several types of dermal armour. Most, if not all, of the material probably belongs to a single medium to large-sized adult individual. The Soria remains are referred to Polacanthus on the basis of the presence of conical, ungrooved presacral spines, a sacropelvic shield composed of irregularly arranged bosses and small tubercles, large spined plates, and hollow-based triangular caudal plates with an extended posterior basal edge and a pointed spine. Polacanthus is well known from the Wealden Group (Barremian-Aptian) of the Isle of Wight and from the Weald Clay Group of West Sussex (England). In addition, isolated remains have been reported from the penicontemporaneous formations of the Iberian Peninsula. The Soria outcrop is currently the most productive Polacanthus site outside England. Moreover, it has yielded the oldest record (late Hauterivian to basal Barremian according to charophyte association) of this ankylosaur known to date in Europe. Minor anatomic differences between the Soria material and the taxa P. foxii (type-species) and P. rudgwickensis suggest the presence of a third species of Polacanthus in the Iberian Peninsula, but additional material is needed to confirm this interpretation.\n\nNodosaurid ankylosaur remains from the Upper Cretaceous of Mexico are summarized. The specimens are from the El Gallo Formation of Baja California, and the Pen and Aguja Formations of northwestern Coahuila, Mexico. These specimens show significant differences from other known nodosaurids, including ulna with very well developed olecranon and prominent humeral notch, the distal end of the femur not flaring to the extent seen in other nodosaurids, and a horn-like spine with vascular grooves on one side. The specimens are important because they are the southern-most occurrences in North America, and provide an important biogeographical link between nodosaurids of the United States and Canada on the one hand, and Argentina and Antarctica on the other.\n\nSources of morphological variation (dimorphism, individual variability, ontogeny, and pathology) can obfuscate taxonomic variation. This is true for Late Cretaceous nodosaurid ankylosaurs, for which several complete, well-preserved skulls and postcrania are known. Although a generalized taxonomy has been accepted for about 25 years, new specimens show mixtures of features considered diagnostic for more than one taxon. Because these taxa are well-accepted and overlap temporally and geographically, they are good candidates for testing intraspecific variation in dinosaurs. This was done by quantitatively testing taxonomic characters a priori with bivariate and clustering analyses. A character-specimen matrix was coded for a parsimony analysis to aid in taxonomic referrals. Because many phylogenetic characters are based on relative proportions or shapes, taphonomic distortion is problematic for this group. Nevertheless, four taxa are valid: Edmontonia longiceps, E. rugosidens, Panoplosaurus mirus, and Denversaurus schlessmani, the latter two more derived. Compared to contemporaneous North American ankylosaurids, nodosaurid taxa do not correlate as well with their stratigraphic distribution. A posteriori character analysis reveals that Panoplosaurus has a shortened skull and rounded cervical/pectoral osteoderms. Denversaurus and Panoplosaurus share inflated cranial sculpturing with visible sulci between individual elements. Denversaurus has a relatively wider anterior snout. The clade shows some overall evolutionary trends: doming of the skull over the orbits, thickening of the vomer and closure of prevomer foramen, encroachment of sculpturing over the anterior temporal bar, shortening and widening of the snout, etc. Use of proportional character data is common in dinosaur systematics, often subjectively. This study demonstrates that quantitatively testing such characters increases their repeatability and clarifies taxonomic decisions.\n\nNew stegosaurian remains have been recently recovered from the Jurassic-Cretaceous transition sandstones of the Villar del Arzobispo Formation (Tithonian-Berriasian) in the Valencia province, eastern Spain. Specimens consist of two partially articulated (or closely associated) postcranial skeletons. The Baldovar specimen is composed of appendicular bones (scapula, femur) and two pairs of dermal tail spines, two of them articulated with two distal caudal vertebrae. The second specimen, unearthed in the vicinity of La Yesa village, consists of dorsal vertebrae and ribs, fragments of caudal centra and an incomplete femur. The new specimens are tentatively referred to the clade Dacentrurinae and may belong to Dacentrurus on the basis of features observed on the dorsal vertebrae and caudal dermal spines. Stegosaurs are represented so far in the Jurassic-Cretaceous transition of Spain by Dacentrurus. The presence of other taxa (Stegosaurus, Miragaia) in Spain, recently documented in the Late Jurassic of Portugal, cannot be attested on the basis of the currently recorded material.\n\nWe present new nodosaurid teeth from the Valanginian of Bexhill, Sussex and the Barremian of the Isle of Wight, the first from the Lower Cretaceous of the United Kingdom. Teeth found during the mid-1800s from the Valanginian and ascribed to the nodosaurid Hylaeosaurus are probably from sauropod dinosaurs. The Isle of Wight tooth could possibly be referred to Polacanthus foxii, the teeth of which are unknown. These new English nodosaurid teeth are similar to those of North American and European Jurassic to Late Cretaceous nodosaurids, especially the American Gastonia, Texasetes,"
