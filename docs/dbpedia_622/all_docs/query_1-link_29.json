Their remains are known from the Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous from every continent except Africa (Tumanova, 1987; Vickaryous et al., 2004). Aspects of ankylosaurian anatomy, phylogeny, and paleobiogeography have been thoroughly studied in the last few decades (e.g., Maryanska, 1977; Tumanova, 1987, 2012; Coombs and Maryanska, 1990; Carpenter, 2001; Vickaryous et al., 2004; Thompson et al., 2012; Arbour and Currie, 2016). Despite this progress, our knowledge of the neurocranial osteology and endocranial morphology within\n\nTable 1. Measurements of the studied braincases of Bissektipelta archibaldi.

[2018]).\n\nA number of isolated specimens belonging to An-kylosauria are known from the Late Cretaceous of Central Asia (Averianov, 2009). Bissektipelta archibaldi is the only valid ankylosaur species from the territory of the former USSR reported to date. It was initially described as \"Amtosaurus\" archibaldi based upon a single braincase incorporating the skull roof from the Late Cretaceous Bissekty Formation of Uzbekistan (Averianov, 2002). Later, it was re-assigned to a new genus (Bissektipelta) by Parish and Barrett (2004) as these authors concluded the type species of \"Amtosaurus\" \"A. magnus\" is nondiagnostic and should be considered a nomen dubium. Since the initial description, the affinities and phyloge-netic position of Bissektipelta have been debated (Averianov, 2002; Parish and Barrett, 2004; Tumanova, 2012; Arbour and Currie, 2016; see \"Phylogenetic analysis\" below) but have never been formally assessed. Recently, Alifanov and Saveliev (2019) described a high-quality synthetic endocast made from the holotype of Bissektipelta archibaldi. However, many of their anatomical interpretations and biological inferences appear to be controversial and in need of further review.\n\nHere, we redescribe in detail the holotype of Bissektipelta archibaldi (ZIN PH 1/16) with the aid of CT scanning. Additionally, two new ankylosaur braincases from the Bissekty Formation are described and assigned to the same species. One of these (ZIN PH 281/16) preserves clear sutures between the elements forming the brain-case, which is exceedingly rare for ankylosaurs. Endo-casts for two studied specimens have been made, which is the largest sample for a single species of ankylosaurs to date. A thorough review of the literature and com-\n\nparison between the described taxa allowed us to propose new and revise previously known braincase characters from the most current taxon-character matrices of ankylosaurs (Thompson et al., 2012; Arbour and Currie, 2016; Arbour and Evans, 2017; Zheng et al., 2018) and subsequently test the phylogenetic relationships of Bissektipelta. Based on a solid phylogenetic framework and detailed digital endocranial casts, we discuss aspects of cranial vasculature and inferences concerning the paleobiology of ankylosaurs.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nInstitutional abbreviations. OUVC, Ohio University Vertebrate Collection, USA; ZIN PH, Paleoherpetologi-cal Collection, Zoological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Saint Petersburg, Russia.\n\nMaterial. The studied material comprises three braincases: the holotype of Bissektipelta archibaldi (ZIN PH 1/16) and two newly described specimens (ZIN PH 281/16 and ZIN PH 2329/16). The material came from the Late Cretaceous (Turonian) Bissekty Formation at the Dzharakuduk locality in the Central Kyzylkum Desert, Uzbekistan. The measurements for the specimens are provided in Table 1.\n\nThe holotype of Bissektipelta archibaldi ZIN PH 1/16 is a well-preserved, fully ossified braincase with a partial skull roof. This specimen was the only known cranial material of the Bissekty ankylosaur and constituted the basis of the original description of \"Amtosaurus\" ar-chibaldi (Averianov, 2002) and subsequent taxonomic reappraisal of this taxon as Bissektipelta archibaldi (Parish and Barrett, 2004). The newly described specimens include ZIN PH 281/16, a partial braincase of slightly\n\nsmaller size with open sutures between some bones, and ZIN PH 2329/16, which is similar in size to the holotype of Bissektipelta archibaldi (Table 1). ZIN PH 2329/16 preserves most of the braincase and part of the skull roof. The sutures cannot be traced in ZIN PH 2329/16 because it is damaged and partially covered with matrix.\n\nComputed tomography. The holotype ZIN PH 1/16 and the referred specimen ZIN PH 281/16 were X-ray CT scanned using a Toshiba Aquilon 64 medical tomographer at 0.5 mm slice thickness, 120 kV, and 300 mA. The resulting stacks compile 334 images (512x512x334 resolution) in DICOM format for ZIN PH 1/16 and 149 images (512x512x149 resolution) for ZIN PH 281/16. Data acquired from CT scans were imported into the visualization software Amira 6.3.0 (FEI-VSG Company) and manually segmented. The resulting 3D models have the voxel size of 0.313x0.313x0.3 for ZIN PH 1/16 and 0.625x0.625x0.8 for ZIN PH 281/16. Measurements on the 3D models were performed using Amira 6.3.0 and MeshLab (Cignoni et al., 2008). The CT scan data and 3D models are available upon request from the first author.\n\nDescription of the holotype of\n\nBissektipelta archibaldi ZIN PH 1/16 (Figs. 1-9)\n\nGeneral comments. The braincase of Bissektipelta is highly ossified, and the bones of the skull roof are completely fused to it. Most sutures were obliterated. We do not support previous assumptions about incompletely ossified portions of some elements in the holotype (e.g., basal tubera, right basipterygoid process, occipital condyle, and the distal tip of the paroccipital process; Averianov, 2002) and regard those as preservational artifacts. These structures are variably preserved in the three studied braincases (notably, also in the smaller specimen ZIN PH 281/16) and are frequently broken off. The braincase is non-pneumatic. CT scans show that no internal pneumatic structures are present. Externally, there is neither the medial pharyngeal recess on the ventral surface of the basicranium nor a well-defined anterior/lateral pneumatic recess on the lateral surface of the parabasisphenoid.\n\nSkull roof. The preserved skull roof has a relatively flat dorsal surface (Fig. 1A, B). Sutures are completely obliterated and are not evident either on the specimen's surface or in the CT images. General observations suggest that ZIN PH 1/16 preserves the posterior portion of the skull roof that corresponds to the frontoparietal region of taxa with known sutural relationships (e.g., Pinacosaurus, Maryañska, 1977; Godefroit et al., 1999; Hill et al., 2003; Kunbarrasaurus, Leahey et al., 2015; Ce-darpelta, Carpenter et al., 2001; \"ZhongyuansaurusXu et al., 2007, = Gobisaurus in Arbour and Currie, 2016: Fig. 6D). A truncated Y-shaped groove that separates\n\nthree polygonal areas of remodeled bone (= caputegu-lae; Blows, 2001; Arbour and Currie, 2013a) is present. The resulting areas are identified here as the paired pos-terolateral nuchal caputegulae (nuca, Fig. 1B) and central parietal caputegulum (paca, Fig. 1B) using the terminology of Arbour and Currie (2013a). Each groove terminates in a pronounced pit; a small offshoot of the left groove is present and is directed anteromedially from the corresponding pit. The CT data for ZIN PH 1/16 shows that these grooves, paired pits, and the skull roof surface are pierced by numerous vascular foramina that connect through canals with the endocranial cavity and the lateral braincase wall. The left branch of the Y-shaped groove interrupts its course for one millimeter, and there is a short contact between the left nuchal and the central parietal caputegulae. The skull roof surface of ZIN PH 1/16 was remodeled, but it is uncertain if osteo-dermal ossifications were involved in that process. According to the hypothesis of Vickaryous et al. (2001a), \"the superficial furrows that divide the cranium.. .represent the areas of coosification between adjacent cephalic osteoderms\". The presence of the Y-shaped groove thus implies that the osteoderms are preserved and co-ossified with the skull roof in ZIN PH 1/16. There is no frontoparietal depression. The posterior edge of the skull roof is broken off. The broken lateral edges of the skull roof overhang the adductor cavities, and there are no traces of the supratemporal fenestrae.\n\nThe boundaries between the skull roof and brain-case are partly recognized on the preserved right par-occipital process in the occipital view (Fig. 1E), and are inferred on the lateral surface of the specimen based on the position of small vascular foramina that frequently lie near the border between the skull roof and brain-case (Galton, 1988; Galton and Knoll, 2006; Fig. 2A). The pattern of facets on the skull roof in the referred specimen ZIN PH 281/16 supports this reconstruction of the boundaries in the holotype. The parietal has two posterolateral processes that are sutured ventrolaterally to the dorsal surface of the paroccipital processes and medially to the supraoccipital (the latter contact is hard to trace; Fig. 1E). The posterolateral processes are an-teroposteriorly thin and oriented almost perpendicular to the sagittal plane of the skull. The posterior surface of the posterolateral processes is slightly posteroventrally-anterodorsally inclined. On the lateral aspect of ZIN PH 1/16, the skull roof appears to form an almost horizontal, slightly posteroventrally inclined contact with the braincase posterior to the capitate process of the lateros-phenoid and a gently anteroventrally inclined contact anteriorly (Fig. 2A). Posteriorly in lateral view, the parietal roofs a small vascular recess (nvr, Fig. 2A, B) and forms the dorsomedial wall of the adductor cavity. Here the skull roof reaches its greatest dorsoventral thickness of 21 millimeters.\n\noc\n\nFig. 1.

The basioccipi-tal and the parabasisphenoid meet at an angle of approximately 90o in ZIN PH 1/16; the suture between these bones is evident in lateral and ventral views (Figs. 1D, 2). Overall the basioccipital is massive and robust. The neck of the occipital condyle is barely defined. The ventral surface of the basioccipital is posteroventrally oriented, concave, and broad; it is slightly wider lateromedially than the corresponding surface of the parabasisphenoid. The basal tubera (= sphenoccipital tubera in Kurza-nov and Tumanova [1978] and Tumanova [1987]) are rounded, anteroposteriorly thin, and project laterally (bt, Fig. 1D, F). The basioccipital fenestra (bofe, Fig. 1D) is present as a distinct blind fissure on the ventral surface between the basal tubera. CT data show that two small, presumably vascular canals extend from it anteriorly and posteriorly inside the bone and gradually disappear in the trabeculae. The basioccipital fenestra is present in the same location ventral to the occipital condyle in present-day crocodylians; a small vein traverses this foramen (Owen, 1850).\n\nThe parabasisphenoid has a triangular, anteroven-trally oriented ventral surface (Fig. 1C, D). The surface between the basipterygoid processes is mediolaterally wider and gradually tapers anteriorly. The left basiptery-goid process is slightly incomplete (bpt, Fig. 1D). The basipterygoid process is a knob that projects ventro-laterally. It is oval in cross-section, with the longer axis directed anteriorly. Its anteroposterior length is nearly twice the mediolateral width at its base. The surface between the basipterygoid processes is relatively flat; there is a shallow depression on each side close to the base of the process. Only the base of the fused parabasisphenoid rostrum (= cultriform process) and the ossified/calcified interorbital septum is preserved. It is situated anterior to the basipterygoid processes (pbsro-ios, Fig. 1D). The base of the fused parabasisphenoid rostrum-interorbital septum extends obliquely anteriorly to the spheneth-moidal complex, where it merges with the septum that separated the olfactory bulbs (= mesethmoid in Miyas-hita et al. [2011]; Figs. 1D, 2E). Regarding the preserved part, the base of these elements is slightly transversally constricted at its mid-length and then expands anteriorly. On each side of the fused parabasisphenoid rostrum-interorbital septum are longitudinal depressions (possibly for the sphenopalatine artery; gaSP, Fig. 2D). A pronounced ridge ventral to the foramen for the optic cranial nerve (CN II) delimits the course of the longitudinal depression dorsally. No sutures in the region of the sphenethmoidal complex are discernable.\n\nOccipital surface. The occipital surface is inclined at the angle of about 125o to the dorsal surface of the skull (Fig. 2A). When the specimen is held such that its skull roof surface is oriented horizontally, the occipital condyle is directed posteroventrally and barely projects\n\nbeyond the occipital plane. The articular surface of the condyle is crescent-shaped and transversely elongated (lateromedial length nearly 1.5 times larger its dorsoven-tral depth; Fig. 1E, F). The articular surface of the con-dyle is slightly eroded. The suture with the otoccipital is visible on the right lateral and posterior surfaces of the condyle (Figs. 1E; 2A); it indicates that the otoccipitals formed the dorsolateral corners of the occipital condyle. The posterior surface of the basioccipital ventral to the condyle is notably arched dorsally and overall faces pos-teroventrally (Fig. 2).\n\nThe foramen magnum is nearly circular. Its lateral and dorsal margins are formed by the otoccipitals; the supraoccipital appears to be excluded from the dorsal margin. Paired triangular surfaces (proatlas facets) project from dorsolateral corners of the foramen magnum (proaf, Fig. 1F). They merge medially and form a dorsal shelf over the foramen magnum. The proatlas facets overhang rounded notches that are sometimes interpreted as the path of the first spinal nerve (Kurzanov and Tumanova, 1978; Parish and Barrett, 2004). In addition, or as an alternative hypothesis, these sulci can correspond to the route of a venous vessel that branches off from the longitudinal venous sinus or its posterior expansion (occipital sinus) at the foramen magnum and courses ventrolaterally (Porter, 2015). Just dorsal to the proatlas facets, there are paired small foramina with associated grooves. These foramina pierce the occipital surface of the braincase directly to the endocranial cavity and likely transmitted small supraoccipital veins (fvSo, Fig. 1F). A venous foramen in a similar position above the foramen magnum was noted for \"Amtosaurus magnus\" (Kurzanov and Tumanova, 1978). Medial to these vascular foramina, on the assumed posterior surface of the supraoccipital, there is the base of the sagittal nuchal crest; dorsally, this surface is obscured by damage.\n\nPaired rounded posttemporal fenestrae are present lateral to the sagittal nuchal crest (ptf, Fig. 1E, F). In general, the posttemporal fenestrae appear to lie near the contact of the parietal, supraoccipital, and otoccipital, but the precise sutural pattern is entirely obscured on the left side and is not clear on the right. The presumed parietal-otoccipital suture is situated at the ventrolateral margin of the posttemporal fenestra; thus, the ventral margin of the posttemporal fenestra is likely formed by the paroccipital process of the otoccipital, and its dorso-lateral margin by the parietal. It is likely that the supra-occipital contributed to the margin of the fenestra medially; alternatively, the medial margin of the fenestra may have been formed by the otoccipital and the parietal. The posttemporal fenestra pierces anteriorly into a small recess on either side of ZIN PH 1/16. This recess is evident in lateral view (nvr+g, Fig. 2A, B); it lies dorsal to the paroccipital process and medial to the adductor cavity.

Both the walls of the recess and the anterior groove are pierced by numerous small vascular foramina.\n\nThe preserved right paroccipital process extends laterally and slightly posteriorly and is incomplete distally (pop, Fig. 1). It is anteroposteriorly thin at its distal end and thick and robust at its base. The process is relatively narrow dorsoventrally; its depth equals the height of the foramen magnum. Two blunt ridges curve dorso-laterally and converge to form the ventral margin of the paroccipital process. The ventral margin of the paroc-cipital process is slightly arched dorsally and is nearly at the same level as the ventral border of the foramen magnum. Dorsally, the process is sutured to the skull roof. There is a small but pronounced depression at the posterior surface of the paroccipital process.\n\nLateral braincase wall. The elements forming the lateral wall of the braincase are fused (e.g., the sphen-ethmoidal complex, the orbitosphenoid, the lateros-phenoid, the parabasisphenoid, the prootic, and the otoccipital). No clear sutures can be observed, with the exception of the basioccipital-otoccipital suture on the condyle on the right side and the suture between the basioccipital and parabasisphenoid. All structures are paired, and the right and left sides of ZIN PH 1/16 have the same general structure and proportions. The lateral wall is penetrated by numerous neurovascular foramina (Fig. 2). These are clustered into two major groups and are relatively closely spaced within the cluster. The anterior group includes the foramina for CN II-VII and two primarily vascular foramina (for the cerebral carotid artery and the sphenopalatine artery and vein). The posterior group is situated ventral to the base of the par-occipital process and comprises the columellar recess/ fenestra ovalis, the metotic foramen, and the foramina for CN XII.\n\nThe two clusters of foramina are separated by a flattened strip of bone that extends ventrally between the basioccipital and the parabasisphenoid portion of the basal tuber. Dorsally, its posterior margin arches over the fenestra ovalis onto the ventral edge of the paroc-cipital process (crp, Fig. 2D). This structure corresponds to a poorly developed crista prootica (= otosphenoidal crest in Sampson and Witmer, 2007) that in diapsids separates the more anterior cranial nerve foramina from the posterior depression containing ear-related structures (fenestra ovalis plus metotic foramen). Generally in diapsids, the crista prootica arches posterodorsally from the parabasisphenoid lateral surface, just above the basipterygoid process. The crista prootica in Bissek-tipelta contacts ventrally the basal tubera instead of the basipterygoid proces. This is likely due to the highly divergent braincase structure of Bissektipelta (and other ankylosaurs) from the basic diapsid pattern, specifically\n\nthe posterior position of the basipterygoid processes close to the basal tubera.\n\nThe olfactory fenestrae are the only neurovascular foramina directed anteriorly instead of laterally (olff, Fig. 2D, F). They are paired and separated by a thick bony septum (= mesethmoid in Miyashita et al. [2011]). They are the largest neurovascular foramina and approach the foramen magnum in size. The olfactory fe-nestrae housed short paired olfactory bulbs and the ethmoid vessels, and they communicated directly with the olfactory region of the nasal cavity (Miyashita et al., 2011). The internal walls of the olfactory fenestrae are covered by numerous anteroposterior grooves, indicating that a large number of neurovascular bundles passed through them (nvg, Fig. 2E, F). The two separate cavities for the olfactory bulbs converge posteriorly into a single chamber that is separated from the rest of the endocra-nial cavity by a rounded constriction.\n\nOnly the base of the broken preorbital septum is preserved. The preorbital septum is a thin transversal bony lamina that separates the nasal and orbital cavities in ankylosaurs; it was first named by Maryanska (1977) (= ectethmoid in Miyashita et al. [2011]; see the description of ZIN PH 2329/16 below). Between the base of the preorbital septum and the anterior cluster of neurovas-cular foramina, the surface of the braincase wall bears no foramina and has dorsoventral striations. The largest foramen among the anterior cluster is that for CN V; the opening for CN II is the second largest. The foramina for the cerebral carotid artery and for the sphenopala-tine vessels are prominent and nearly equal in size (faCC and faSP, Fig. 2F). The large recess of the ganglion of CN V has a triangular projection from its dorsal margin that separates the anteriorly directed groove for CN V1 (ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve) from postero-ventrally directed grooves for CN V2+3 (maxillary and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve; see Holli-day and Witmer [2007]). The small foramen for CN VII lies in the same large recess with that for CN V and is separated by a small ridge from the latter. The foramen for CN II is separated from the more posterior foramina by a thick vertical strut of bone. A small groove on the ventral margin of the foramen for CN II possibly indicates the course of a small vessel (Fig. 2D, E). There is a prominent depression on the lateral braincase wall dorsal to the foramen for CN IV and anterior to the adductor cavity (the postocular shelf is not preserved here in ZIN PH 1/16; see the description of ZIN PH 2329/16 below). The depression is pierced by two foramina for the orbitocerebral vein and a series of smaller vascular openings (fvOC, Fig. 2F).\n\nThe columellar recess/fenestra ovalis (CR/FO), the metotic foramen (MF), and three external foramina for CN XII are closely spaced and situated in a single depression ventral to the paroccipital process. This de-\n\npression is bordered by the crista prootica anteriorly, the basal tuber ventrally, and the prominent blunt ridge posteriorly (r, Fig. 2D). The latter connects with the ventral margin of the paroccipital process so that the foramina for CN XII are not evident in posterior view (Fig. 1E, F). The external openings of the CR/FO and MF are almost equal in size and large. The crista interfenestralis (= ventral ramus of opisthotic in more basal archosaurs; e.g., Gower, 2002; Sobral et al., 2016) separates FO and MF (ci, Fig. 2B). It is a slightly anteroventrally inclined lamina of bone that is barely visible in posterior view. The three foramina for CN XII are almost vertically arranged posterior to MF. The posteriormost foramen is the largest of the three. The anteriormost foramen for CN XII is the smallest and lies below MF.\n\nEndocranial surface. The complex endocranial surface can be anteroposteriorly subdivided into four main concave regions (olfactory and cerebral fossae, and two fossae anterior and posterior to the otic capsule) separated by convex crests (Fig. 3). The anterior part of the endocranial cavity in ZIN PH 1/16 corresponds the pos-teriormost portion of the olfactory region of the nasal cavity (distinguished by rugose walls with numerous neurovascular grooves) and paired cavities of the olfactory bulbs that merge posteriorly into the cavity for the olfactory tract (olfbc and olftc, Fig. 3). The olfactory tract cavity is constricted laterally by paired blunt crests, which emphasize the division between the olfactory region anteriorly and the cerebral fossa posteriorly.\n\nThe cerebral cavity is circumscribed by the blunt olfactory crest anteriorly and by the tentorial crest (sensu Sedlmayr [2002]) posteriorly on each side (olfcr and tencr, Fig. 3A). Several neurovascular structures pierce the surface of the cerebral fossa, including the foramen for CN IV and two conspicuous foramina for the orbito-cerebral vein (Fig. 3A). The surface of the cerebral cavity has a gently corrugated texture but lacks prominent vascular valleculae, indicating that the brain was not in close relationship to the endocranial wall and loosely fitted the cerebral cavity (Evans, 2005). The large transverse groove for CN II is offset anteroventrally and opens posteriorly into the cerebral cavity (Fig. 3B). Its dorsal margin forms a blunt crest that arches posterodorsally onto the lateral endocranial surface on each side and merges with the tentorial crest. This oblique crest marks the subdivision of the cerebral fossa into two smaller fossae, roughly corresponding to the cerebral hemispheres anteriorly and the optic lobes posteriorly. The ventral margin of the CN II groove forms a sharp crest that denotes the anterior dorsal limit of the hypophyseal cavity.\n\nThe cerebral cavity merges into the hypophyseal cavity ventrally (hypc, Fig. 3). The hypophyseal cavity is comparatively shallow, being half the depth of the cerebral cavity. Foramina for the cerebral carotid and sphenopalatine arteries and for CN III pierce its surface\n\n(Fig. 3). The internal foramen for CN III is unexpectedly situated ventrally, well in the limits of the hypophyseal cavity. A groove connects the internal openings of the sphenopalatine artery and CN III, raising the possibility that the latter may actually be a vascular foramen, perhaps for a branch of the cerebral carotid/sphenopalatine artery (e.g., the orbital artery of extant birds) or for the orbital/hypophyseal vein that drains into the cavernous sinus (Bruner, 1907; Porter and Witmer, 2015; Porter and Witmer, 2016a). In that case, the actual CN III would leave the braincase through the dorsally situated foramen for CN IV, as in Euoplocephalus (Miyashita et al., 2011). We tentatively follow the initial description by Averianov (2002) and maintain a conservative interpretation of the foramen in question as for CN III.\n\nThe dorsum sellae bulges over the hypophyseal cavity dorsally. It has a short anterior triangular projection surrounded by two grooves medially. This projection is also evident in the referred specimen of Bissektipelta ZIN PH 281/16, in \"Amtosaurus magnus\" (Kurzanov and Tumanova, 1978), and is possibly present, though less developed, in several other Mongolian taxa (Averianov, 2002; Parish and Barrett, 2004). We regard these grooves as vascular impressions that indicate the course of posterior venous branches of the cavernous sinus (caudo-ventral cerebral veins) or, as an alternative hypothesis, the course of the caudal encephalic arteries (Sedlmayr, 2002; Porter, 2015; Porter et al., 2016). Posteriorly to the dorsum sellae, the floor of the endocranial surface is essentially flat.\n\nThe tentorial crest is prominent; ventrally, it is confluent with the lateral aspect of the dorsum sellae, arches anterodorsally over the anterior margin of the foramen for CN V, and then curves posterodorsally and extends to the roof of the endocranial cavity (tencr, Fig. 3A). The internal opening for CN VI pierces the base of the tento-rial crest; the foramen for CN VII lies dorsolateral to it (Fig. 3B). The tentorial crest circumscribes a fossa dorsal to the foramen for CN V that was likely occupied by the cerebellum and a large venous vessel (middle cerebral vein; vMC, Fig. 3A). The latter opened externally through a series of foramina at the posterodorsal aspect of the fossa. The floccular (= auricular) fossa is very shallow.\n\nThe medial wall of the otic capsule is incompletely ossified (sc+ves in Fig. 3A). The amount of the exposure may have been exaggerated by postmortem fracture; however, both the referred specimens have largely medially open vestibules. The recesses for the vestibule, common crus, and lagena are medially open and confluent with the endocranial cavity. Paired unossified fossae with unfinished margins at the floor of the endocranial cavity mark the position of the lagenae (lagf, Fig. 3B). These fossae are comparatively large and probably contained additional structures such as supportive vascular plexus. A bifurcating groove extends posterodorsally\n\nFig. 3.

The internal opening of the metotic foramen (MF) is just posterior to the otic capsule. The metotic foramen is undivided (see discussion in Rieppel [1985]; Gower and Weber, 1998; Sobral et al., 2012) and likely transmitted the perilymphatic sac, CN IX-XI, and the posterior cerebral vein (vagal vein in Sedlmayr [2002]). The wall between the vestibular recess and the MF is incised. This notch indicates the position of the incompletely ossified perilymphatic foramen that transmitted the perilymphatic sac from the otic capsule to the MF (Baird, 1960; Gower, 2002; Gower and Walker, 2002). Two larger internal foramina for CN XII pierce the endocranial wall posterior to the MF; a single small opening is just ventral to it. An extensive shallow depression with a deeper pit above these structures indicates the position of the occipital venous sinus (Fig. 3B; Sedlmayr, 2002; Witmer et al., 2008; Porter, 2015).\n\nEndocast. The endocast of ZIN PH 1/16 generated from a CT scan data is complete, undistorted, and relatively detailed (Fig. 4; Table 2). It comprises casts of the endocranial cavity, cranial nerves, both endos-seous labyrinths, and vascular canals. The morphology of the inner ear and braincase vasculature of ZIN PH 1/16 are described in separate sections below. The brain of Bissektipelta loosely fitted the endocranial cavity as is common for many non-avian dinosaurs and for reptiles in general (Hopson, 1979; Witmer et al., 2008). Thus, the produced endocast is more a cast of the meninges (including endocranial venous sinuses) rather than the brain itself. Nevertheless, it appears to be a faithful inference of gross morphology of the brain as is suggested by recent research on extant archosaurs (Watanabe et al., 2019). Additionally, the endocranial vessels of various extant diapsids have a rather conservative pattern (Porter, 2015; see Vasculature and Fig. 9 below), and their disposition revealed on the endocast of Bissektipelta is a reliable proxy for recognition of major brain divisions.\n\nolft ch\n\nFig. 4. ZIN PH 1/16, holotype of Bissektipelta archibaldi from the Bissekty Formation (Turonian), Uzbekistan. Cranial endocast with endosseous labyrinth of the inner ear in dorsal (A), ventral (B), and left lateral (C) views. Scale bar equals 1 cm. Abbreviations: aCC, cerebral carotid artery and vein; aSP, sphenopalatine artery and vein; cbl, cerebellum; ch, cerebral hemisphere; lab, endosseous labyrinth; MF, metotic foramen passage; olfb, olfactory bulb; olfc, olfactory cavity cast; olft, olfactory tract; optt, optic tectum of the midbrain; vn?, vomero-nasal bulbs?; II — XII, cranial nerves.\n\nThe endocranial cast is elongate and relatively straight, with low angles of cerebral and pontine flexures of about 30o; the cranial nerves and the fenestra ovalis of the labyrinth are correspondingly linearly arranged (Fig. 4C). The olfactory bulbs diverge anteriorly at an angle of approximately 80o from a short and broad olfactory tract (CN I; olfb and olft in Fig. 4A). The bulbs and the tract are nearly circular in cross-section. The olfactory ratio (the ratio of the greatest diameter of the olfactory bulb to the greatest diameter of the cerebral hemisphere regardless of their orientation; Zelenitsky et al., 2009) equals nearly 63-69 %. It is comparable to that of other ankylosaurs (see Discussion below) and suggests proportionally large olfactory bulbs in Bissektipelta and other ankylosaurs. Anteriorly, the endocast of each olfactory bulb terminates in a rounded expansion with wrinkled walls that corresponds to the olfactory region of the nasal cavity (olfc, Fig. 4A). The wrinkles most likely represent neurovascular bundles passing to and from the endocranial cavity, and part of them was visualized as the vascular olfactory plexus (olfP, Fig. 6; see \"Vasculature\" section below). Paired cavities within the ossified ethmoidal region, ventral to the olfactory tract, were segmented (vn?, Fig. 4A, B). A similar cavity was also found ventral to the broken mesethmoid in the referred specimen ZIN PH 281/16 (see Figs. 11-14). These struc-\n\ntures lie below the olfactory complex of Bissektipelta and could correspond to the part of the vomeronasal bulb or vascular sinuses. These structures are reported for the first time in dinosaurs and require additional study to elucidate their nature.\n\nThe short olfactory tract posteriorly merges into a rounded cast of the cerebral cavity. The anterior part of the cavity's endocast reaches maximum dorsoventral depth and lateromedial breadth (Table 2) and corresponds to the cerebral hemispheres (ch, Fig. 4A). The cerebral hemispheres are relatively discrete on the endo-cast. The absence of a dorsal groove between the hemispheres indicates that the dorsal longitudinal venous sinus occupied the space above the latter.\n\nThe endocast of Bissektipelta lacks the dorsal dural peak present on endocasts of stegosaurs (Galton, 1988; Galton, 2001; Leahey et al., 2015: Fig. 10), most sauro-pods (Witmer et al., 2008), and some theropods (e.g., Sampson and Witmer, 2007). Dorsal expansions of dinosaur endocasts have been interpreted as an unossified gap plugged with cartilage in life (Hopson, 1979) or as corresponding to extensive dural sinuses that may have surrounded the pineal complex (Sampson and Witmer, 2007; Witmer et al., 2008). In Bissektipelta, the only structure of the endocast that may correspond to the pineal complex is a conspicuous median vessel (medVs,\n\nTable 2. Endocast measurements of Bissektipelta archibaldi. All linear measurements in millimeters; volume in cm3\n\nParameter ZIN PH 1/16 ZIN PH 281/16\n\nWhole endocast length 103 70\n\nEndocast length without the cast of the olfactory region of the nasal cavity 85 -\n\nEndocast volume (without vessels and nerves) 53\n\nEndocast width across cerebral hemispheres 33 29\n\nOlfactory bulb maximum cross-sectional diameter 15 -\n\nOlfactory tract width 19.5 12\n\nPituiatary depth 19 18\n\nPituitary diameter 16.5 12.5\n\nFig. 7). Its canal pierces the skull roof all the way through to the endocast and connects to the anterior branching plexuses laterally (see Vasculature below). The median vessel emerges at the surface of the endocast just an-terodorsal to the inferred division between the cerebral hemispheres and the optic lobes (assessed by the position of the cerebrotectal venous sinus and the disposition of crests on the endocranial surface), at the level of the optic chiasm and the pituitary. This position broadly corresponds to that of the pineal complex in other di-apsids (e.g., Sphenodon; Dendy, 1911). Notably, the pineal complex, optic chiasm, and the neurohypophysis are all diencephalic derivates. However, the external pineal (parietal) foramen was lost early in archosauriform evolution (Hopson, 1979; character 63 in Nesbitt, 2011); extant birds have a pineal that lies internally within the braincase, adjacent to the skull roof (Ralph, 1970). Thus, we doubt that the median canal of Bissektipelta contained a pineal/parapineal organ that was exposed on the dorsal surface of the skull roof and consider the structure a vascular canal. However, noting its remarkable position, we hypothesize this canal enclosed vessels that may have been connected to pineal vasculature. The point of emergence of the median vessel from the endocast thus marks a possible position of the pineal complex in Bissektipelta.\n\nThe optic chiasm is located on the ventral surface of the endocast of Bissektipelta, below the cerebral hemispheres and just anterior to the hypophysis (Fig. 4). Each CN II leaves the braincase by a separate lateral foramen. The endocasts of the canals for CN II and of the optic chiasm form a single straight trunk that is oriented strictly perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the braincase (Fig. 4B).\n\nThe complete cast of the hypophyseal (pituitary) fossa is present just posterior to the optic chiasm and ventral to the hemispheres (Fig. 4B, C). The pituitary projects vertically from the ventral surface of the en-docast. Overall, the pituitary cast is a tubular structure with an even diameter throughout; the stalk itself is not\n\nexpressed. It is relatively short dorsoventrally (its dorso-ventral depth equals nearly 19 mm and is half the depth of the cerebral cavity above it), broad, and nearly circular in cross-section (Table 2). The hypophyseal fossa apparently contained the infundibulum (hypophyseal stalk) and the hypophysis, which were likely surrounded by the cavernous venous sinus, as it in extant archosaurs (Neumeier and Lametschwandtner, 1994; Sedlmayr, 2002; Porter et al., 2016; Porter and Witmer, 2016a). The hypophyseal fossa of Bissektipelta was well vascularized. Large cerebral carotid arteries entered the hypophyseal cavity transversely as in most other ankylosaurs (e.g., Paulina-Carabajal et al., 2018); the sphenopalatine arteries branched off of them and left the hypophyseal cavity slightly anteriorly (a+vCC and a+vSP in Fig. 4B, C). The cerebral carotid and sphenopalatine veins that drained the cavernous sinus and the orbit/palate apparently shared canals with similarly named arteries. The stalk of CN III appears roughly at the mid-height of the endo-cast of the hypophyseal cavity, which occupies an unusually ventral position compared to those on most other dinosaur endocasts (Fig. 4C). A swelling on the lateral surface of the pituitary endocast connects the CN III trunk with the sphenopalatine artery endocast, which, combined with its low position, possibly indicates that the former represented a vessel (e.g., orbital artery and vein) rather than a nerve.\n\nThe optic lobes of the midbrain (optt, Fig. 4C) are not directly discernable on the endocast of ZIN PH 1/16 as they were likely overlain by sizable dural venous sinuses. The approximate position of the midbrain could be determined through the disposition of major encephalic vessels and general topographic cues of the diapsid brain (reviewed by Hopson [1979], Witmer et al. [2008], and others). The optic tectum of the midbrain in Bissektipelta apparently laid between the cerebral hemispheres anteriorly and the cerebellum posteriorly (Fig. 4C); thus, the brain had a linear arrangement that is similar to that in extant crocodiles, plesiomorphic for dinosaurs in general, and characteristic of many ornithischians in par-\n\nticular (Hopson, 1979; Balanoff and Bever, 2017). The endocranial cast of Bissektipelta is slightly constricted mediolaterally at the level of the optic tectum; its dorsal outline smoothly arches posteroventrally in lateral view. The short trunk of CN IV projects anterolaterally and slightly ventrally from the endocast above the pituitary (Fig. 4C). If we assume that the canal for CN III housed vascular structures rather than the actual cranial nerve, CN III must have left the braincase through the canal for CN IV.\n\nThe cerebellum is not distinctly expressed, and there is no prominent flocculus on the endocast of ZIN PH 1/16 (cbl, Fig. 4A, C). The region of the endocast that corresponds to the cerebellum is posterior to a groove reflecting the position of the tentorial crest. The cerebellum was circumscribed by extensive dural vessels, e.g., the middle cerebral vein anterodorsally and the longitudinal sinus (torcular Herophili part) dorsally (Figs. 6A, 7A, 9A).\n\nPart of the endocast corresponding to the medulla oblongata is nearly as broad mediolaterally as it is anteroposterior^ long. The structure of the medulla ob-longata is obscured by extensive occipital venous sinus (sOc, Fig. 7A). The ventral surface of the brainstem is essentially flat and straight in lateral view; it is only slightly notched behind the endocast of the hypophyseal fossa anteriorly (Fig. 4B, C).\n\nThe single large trunk of CN V expands shortly after its emergence from the lateroventral surface of the endocast and superficially subdivides into three lobes (Fig. 4C). This expansion of CN V endocast likely corresponds to the Gasserian ganglion, and the three lobes reflect its main branches — the ophthalmic (CN VI), maxillary (CN VII), and mandibular (CN VIII) nerves (see Holliday and Witmer [2007] for a survey of the diapsid condition). The middle cerebral vein exited the brain-case together with CN V (vMC, Fig. 9). The endocast of CN VI extends anteroventrally and slightly laterally from the ventral surface of the brainstem. It comes off at the level of CN V, passes by the hypophyseal cavity, and exits the braincase through a separate foramen anterior to CN V (Figs. 2, 3, 4). The trunk of CN VII emerges between the endocasts of CN V and the inner ear and parallels the course of CN V. CN VIII was not digitally rendered; however, a groove at the endocranial surface of ZIN PH 1/16 that extends posterodorsally from the internal foramen of CN VII into the inner ear recess, just below the ampullary spaces, corresponds to the course of CN VIII (Fig. 3A). CN IX and CN X share the same exit via the metotic passage. The endocast of the MF is directly posterior to that of the inner ear and is relatively large (comparable to the endocast of CN II and slightly smaller than that of CN V). Three trunks of CN XII are evenly spaced posterior to the MF endocast; the anteri-ormost trunk is the smallest and lies adjacent to the MF.\n\nInner ear. The endosseous labyrinth of the inner ear was digitally reconstructed for both sides of ZIN PH 1/16 (Figs. 4, 5). The endosseous labyrinth is the endocast of inner skull cavities that carried the endolymphat-ic (otic or membranous) labyrinth surrounded by the perilymphatic (periotic) labyrinth (Baird, 1960; Witmer et al., 2008). Part of the perilymphatic labyrinth associated with semicircular canals is uniform among reptiles and closely matches the semicircular ducts of the endolymphatic labyrinth in shape. The lower part of the perilymphatic labyrinth that surrounds the saccule and the cochlear duct (lagena) of the endolymphatic system has a more complex structure that obscures the form of the endolymphatic labyrinth (Baird, 1960). The endosseous labyrinths of Bissektipelta, as well as those of other dinosaurs, reflect the structure of both the endolymphatic and perilymphatic systems as a whole. The perilymphatic labyrinth of Bissektipelta has an extracapsular portion (perilymphatic sac) that extends posteromedi-ally into the undivided metotic passage (MF) to participate in a compensatory secondary tympanic membrane (pls, Figs. 4B, 5B). This is a common condition for many diapsids including Sphenodon, basal archosaurs, and dinosaurs (Baird, 1960; Gower, 2002; Gower and Walker, 2002; Witmer et al., 2008). The position of extracapsular portion of the perilymphatic sac is marked by a notch between the vestibular recess of the inner ear cavity and the MF and was digitally visualized as part of the endosseous labyrinth (pls, Fig. 5B, C).\n\nThe endosseous labyrinths from both sides of ZIN PH 1/16 are undistorted and symmetrical. The medial aspects of both labyrinths are incomplete due to incomplete endocranial ossification of the otic capsules (Fig. 5C). The semicircular canals are robust. The am-pullar regions are not discrete and are present as expansions at proximal ends of the canals. Each semicircular canal lies in a single plane and does not curve beyond its limits. The anterior canal is the tallest and the largest of the three; it is roughly circular in shape (asc, Fig. 5B). The angle between the anterior and posterior canals equals approximately 90o. The posterior semicircular canal has a marked elliptical shape and is relatively low (psc, Fig. 5B); the anterior canal is one and a half times taller than the posterior one. The common crus is low (nearly equals the depth of the posterior canal) and broad (nearly twice the average canal breadth) (crc, Fig. 5). The lateral semicircular canal is ovoid in shape and appears to be equal to or only slightly smaller than the posterior canal (lsc, Fig. 5D). The utricular and sac-cular compartments of the endolymphatic labyrinth are not apparent as they were laterally covered by the peri-otic cistern of the perilymphatic labyrinth (as in other diapsids; Baird, 1960).\n\nBelow the level of semicircular canals, the endosse-ous labyrinth is markedly constricted anteroposteriorly.\n\nFig. 5. ZIN PH 1/16, holotype of Bissektipelta archibaldi from the Bissekty Formation (Turonian), Uzbekistan. Digital reconstruction of the endos-seous labyrinth of the left inner ear in anterior (A), lateral (B), medial (C), and oblique dorsolateral (D) views. Scale bar equals 1 cm. Abbreviations: asc, anterior semicircular canal; cochd, endosseous cochlear duct; CR, columellar recess; crc, crus communis; CR+FO, external openning of columellar recess leading to fenestra ovalis; lsc, lateral semicircular canal; pls, perilymphatic sac; psc, posterior semicircular canal.\n\nThis point is level with the columellar recess and the fenestra ovalis and marks the approximate line of division of the endosseous cochlear duct (lagena). The cochlear duct curves ventromedially below the vestibular portion of the labyrinth (cochd, Fig. 5A). Large unossified spaces below the endocranial cavity on both sides of ZIN PH 1/16 (lagf, Fig. 3B) were segmented as parts of the inner ear labyrinth. Although these structures are natural, symmetric, and observed in all studied specimens, we doubt that the actual cochlea was that elongate in Bissek-tipelta and curved below the endocast as in birds (e.g., Witmer et al., 2008). We suggest that these spaces could have contained either enlarged outgrowths of the peri-lymphatic sac and/or supportive neurovascular tissues of the inner ear. Overall, they just might have been plugged\n\nwith cartilage. Accounting for the uncertainty regarding the actual extent of the cochlear duct in ZIN PH 1/16, we perform two sets of measurements of its length (Table 3): a conservative assessment that does not include the medioventral portion of the cochlear endocast and an extended assessment that accounts for a complete model length. The presence of the extracapsular portion of the perilymphatic sac in Bissektipelta (which is the continuation of the scala tympani that encircles the la-gena medially in archosaurs; see Baird, 1960: Fig. 2) suggests that small portions of the perilymphatic labyrinth bulged out intracranially and, thus, were not visualized in the model. According to our approximate estimates, the length of the endosseous cochlear duct equals nearly 10-11 mm under a conservative measurement and 11-\n\nTable 3. Endosseous labyrinth measurements and hearing properties of Bissektipelta archibaldi. The best frequency of hearing and the high-frequency hearing limit are calculated based on the equations from Gleich et al. (2005). We assume that the basilar papilla represents only two thirds of the cochlear duct length as in Gleich et al. (2005). For ZIN PH 1/16, two types of measurements were conducted — a more conservative approach (when a straighter line through the cochlea was measured) and an extended approach (when a strongly ventromedially curved line through the cochlea was measured). A single set of cochlear dimensions was taken from ZIN PH 281/16. All linear measurements in millimeters, hearing frequencies in hertz\n\nParameter ZIN PH 1/16 ZIN PH 281/16\n\nLeft labyrinth cochlear duct length, conservative 10.8\n\nLeft labyrinth cochlear duct length, extended 13.9 13.1\n\nRight labyrinth cochlear duct length, conservative 10.1\n\nRight labyrinth cochlear duct length, extended 11.6 14.4\n\nMean cochlear duct length for both labyrinths, conservative 10.45\n\nMean cochlear duct length for both labyrinths, extended 12.75 13.75\n\nBest frequency of hearing, conservative 1002\n\nBest frequency of hearing, extended 682 576\n\nHigh-frequency hearing limit, conservative 2889\n\nHigh-frequency hearing limit, extended 2299 2105\n\n14 mm under an extended assessment, which amounts to 38-41 % and 41-53 % of the overall height of the en-dosseous labyrinth (the height of the vestibular part is around 15-16 mm). Thus, the lagena of Bissektipelta was moderately elongate.\n\nA long canal extends laterally from the cochlear duct of ZIN PH 1/16 (CR, Fig. 5A). It has two parallel oblique sharp margins along its sides. We hypothesize that this structure represents the stapedial recess partly enclosed in bone due to extensive ossification of the lateral wall of the braincase in ZIN PH 1/16. In dorsal and anterior views, the distal part of the recess delimited by the aforementioned margins resembles the shape of the oblique stapedial footplate (Fig. 5A, D). Thus, the actual fenestra ovalis was likely displaced internally from the lateral surface of the braincase.\n\nVasculature. The CT data allowed digital reconstruction of a complex pattern of blood vessels in the ho-lotype of Bissektipelta archibaldi (Figs. 6-9). Endocranial vasculature and the system of vessels piercing the skull roof and lateral braincase wall has been reconstructed for Bissektipelta based on relative osteological correlates such as grooves and canals within bone (Witmer, 1995; Porter, 2015). Major vessels that are external to the braincase and did not leave direct bony features are only briefly mentioned here and are discussed later (see Discussion). As it is often hard to discriminate which component (arterial/venous) is prevalent in a given os-teological structure (save for well-known features such as the cerebral carotid canal predominated by the arterial component or grooves for the dural venous sinuses at the endocranial surface; see Porter [2015]), we have not distinguished between the types of blood vessels that pierced the skull roof and the braincase wall in our model. However, many of them are considered mainly or exclusively venous as encephalic arteries form a closed network around the brain under the dura matter and do not communicate with the orbital and temporal vessels (Sedlmayr, 2002; Almeida and Campos, 2010, 2011), with the exception of the ethmoid artery that communicates anteriorly with the supraorbital artery to form the nasal artery (Porter et al., 2016; Porter and Witmer, 2016a).\n\nIn extant diapsids, the main artery that supplies the braincase is the internal carotid artery and two of its branches — the cerebral carotid and the stapedial arteries (Porter and Witmer, 2015, 2016; Porter et al., 2016) (aIC, aCC, and aST in Fig. 8). In Bissektipelta, each cerebral carotid artery enters almost at the floor of the hypophyseal cavity (a+vCC, Fig. 6A). Small vessels branching off of the cerebral carotid curve anteroven-trally along the floor of the hypophyseal cavity (Fig. 4B). These small lobose vessels, though visualized as parts of the cerebral carotid artery endocast, possibly represent ventral parts of the cavernous sinus that drains into the\n\ncerebral carotid vein (compare Fig. 4B with Neumeier and Lametschwandtner, 1994: Fig. 15). The latter vein shares the canal with the cerebral carotid artery; thus, both vessels are represented by a single trunk in the endocast of ZIN PH 1/16. The cerebral carotid arteries were likely connected medially because extant birds and crocodylians show anastomizing vessels/plexuses in the posteroventral region of the hypophyseal cavity (Sedlmayr, 2002; Porter et al., 2016; Porter and Witmer, 2016a). A horizontal swelling at the posterior surface of the pituitary endocast of ZIN PH 1/16, between cerebral carotid arteries, possibly corresponds to the intercarotid anastomosis (Fig. 4B). Just anterior to its entrance into the hypophyseal cavity, the cerebral carotid artery gives off the sphenopalatine artery (a+vSP, Fig. 6A). It is a distinct but smaller-caliber vessel compared to the cerebral carotid. A possible anterior course of the sphenopalatine artery is marked by a notch and depression on each side of the parabasisphenoid (gaSP in Fig. 2D, aSP in Fig. 8). The artery courses anterodorsally into the nasal region. A similar route of the sphenopalatine artery is present in extant birds (Porter and Witmer, 2016a). The dorsal courses of the common encephalic artery (= cerebral carotid after branching off sphenopalatine artery) and its branches that ramify around the brain inside the endocranial cavity are hard to trace. Possible osteologi-cal correlates are paired grooves on the dorsum sellae that could correspond to the caudal encephalic artery (Fig. 3A).\n\nAnother branch of the internal carotid is the sta-pedial artery, which continues anteriorly through the temporal region as the temporoorbital artery and then divides into three main orbital vessels (supra-, infraorbital, and ophthalmotemporal arteries; Sedlmayr, 2002; Porter, 2015) (aST, aTO, aSO, aOpt + aIO in Fig. 8). Anterior to the supratemporal fossa, a large curved canal within the lateral wall of the braincase, dorsal to the foramina for CN II-IV, is interpreted as the passage for the supraorbital artery and vein (preserved on the left side of ZIN PH 1/16 and opened by fracture on the right) (ca+v and fa+vSO in Fig. 2B, F; a+vSO in Fig. 6A; aSo in Fig. 8; vSO in Fig. 9). These vessels accompany each other through their course over the anterior surface of the laterosphenoid and ventral surface of the frontal in extant archosaurs (Porter et al., 2016; Porter and Witmer, 2016a). The supraorbital vessels course external to the bone surface in extant taxa; however, some dinosaurs with heavily ossified skulls (e.g., pachycephalo-saurids) show evidence for the bony enclosure of their branches into canals (Porter, 2015). The same is likely true for ZIN PH 1/16. The supraorbital artery/vein canal communicates via small-caliber vascular canals with the anterior branching plexus of the cranial roof dorsally and with endocranial vessels medially and posteromedi-ally (Figs. 6, 7, 9). The latter corresponds to numerous\n\nFig. 6. ZIN PH 1/16, holotype of Bissektipelta archibaldifrom the Bissekty Formation (Turonian), Uzbekistan.

The supraorbital artery/vein canal also receives a number of small canals from the lateral surface of the braincase. The anterior course of the supraorbital vessels is marked by an antero-ventrally directed groove and the orbitonasal foramen in the preorbital septum (Fig. 8). The latter structure is broken in the holotype but preserved in the referred specimen ZIN PH 2329/16 (Fig. 15). The communication of the supraorbital and ethmoid vessels (situated dorsal to the olfactory tract and bulbs in extant taxa; Almeida and Campos, 2010, 2011; Porter et al., 2016; Porter and Wit-mer, 2016a) occurred through some of the small canals piercing the lateral wall of the braincase (Figs. 6A and 7A) and further anterior to the orbitonasal foramen (see Figs. 8-9). The latter communication of the supraorbital and ethmoid vessels gave rise to the nasal vessels that supplied and drained the nasal cavity.\n\nThe encephalic vessels seldom leave direct traces on the endocranial surface (with some notable exceptions; see Evans [2005]); however, their basic pattern appears to be rather conservative among known diapsids (Bruner, 1907; Dendy, 1909; Sedlmayr, 2002; Witmer et\n\nal., 2008; Porter, 2015; Porter and Witmer, 2015, 2016; Porter et al., 2016). Major endocranial veins are recognized as swellings on the endocast surface that communicate with external vasculature via vascular or nervous canals (Hopson, 1979; Sampson and Witmer, 2007; Witmer et al., 2008; Porter, 2015). The latter are important landmarks that trace the course of the vessel. The digital endocast of the holotype of Bissektipelta allows recognition of several dural venous vessels/sinuses and their communications with external vasculature (Fig. 9).\n\nThe dorsal longitudinal sinus appears as a shallow but broad prominence on the top of the endocast that extends from the olfactory tract anteriorly to the level of the otic capsules posteriorly (Figs. 7, 9). Anterior to the olfactory tract, the dorsal longitudinal sinus apparently splits into a pair of vessels (olfactory veins in Dendy [1909]; ethmoid vein in Porter and Witmer [2016]; Porter et al., 2016) that overlaid the olfactory bulbs and continued forward to drain the olfactory cavity as nasal veins (vET + vNas in Fig. 9). A large number of neurovascular grooves are preserved around the olfactory bulbs/posterior portion of the olfactory region of the nasal cavity in ZIN PH 1/16 (Fig. 2F). These grooves indicate the presence of a vascular plexus around the ol-\n\nolfP sLon\n\nFig. 9. ZIN PH 1/16, holotype of Bissektipelta archibaldi from the Bissekty Formation (Turonian), Uzbekistan.

In extant birds, the olfactory bulbs are surrounded by a dense venous plexus that eventually drains into the longitudinal sinus via the ethmoidal veins and/or the olfactory sinus and their anastomoses (Sedlmayr, 2002; Porter and Wit-mer, 2016a).\n\nA conspicuous median vessel arises sagittally at the top of the endocast of Bissektipelta, dorsal to the cerebral hemispheres (medVs, Fig. 7). The vessel extends dor-sally within a canal inside the bone and opens through a foramen on the dorsal surface of the skull roof. Along the way, it issues left and right major branches as well as smaller branches in a slightly asymmetrical manner; each major branch communicates with a corresponding anterior branching plexus (Fig. 7A). The median vessel was apparently connected to the dorsal longitudinal sinus ventrally. Undoubtedly this structure was vascular (most likely, venous), as it commences from the endo-cast at the inferred position of the longitudinal sinus and connects to vascular branching plexuses. We are unaware of any similar dorsal extensions of the encephalic vessels in extant diapsids. As noted earlier in the description of the endocast, the position of the median vessel in Bissektipelta generally corresponds to the position of the pineal complex in extant lepidosaurs and birds. In extant diapsids, the pineal complex is well vascularized, supplied by branches of the posterior cerebral artery and drained by the dorsal longitudinal sinus (Dendy, 1909; Ralph, 1970). We doubt that the canal housed the pineal/ parapineal organ itself but hypothesize that the median vessel and its branches may represent dorsal continuations of the pineal complex vasculature.\n\nThe dorsal longitudinal sinus is most prominent posteriorly where it received the middle cerebral veins and appears as a broad triangle in the dorsal view (tor-cular Herophili; Dendy, 1909; Sedlmayr, 2002; sOc, Fig. 7A). Posterior to this, the dorsal longitudinal sinus likely bifurcated into two sinus-like posterior cerebral veins (vena cerebralis posterior, vena cephalica posterior, vagal vein, occipital venous sinus of different authors) (sOc, Fig. 7A; sOc/vCP, Fig. 9A). The posterior cerebral veins likely left the endocranial cavity through the foramen magnum, as in most extant diapsids (Bruner, 1907; Sedlmayr, 2002; Witmer et al., 2008; Porter and Witmer, 2015, 2016; Porter et al., 2016). However, Sphenodon shows an important variation of the course of the posterior cerebral vein, which leaves the endocra-nial cavity through the metotic foramen (Dendy, 1909). The same route for the posterior cerebral vein through the metotic foramen was reconstructed for basal croco-dylomorphs (Walker, 1990) and other pseudosuchians (Gower, 2002; Gower and Nesbitt, 2006; Sulej, 2010). Both pathways for the venous drainage (via the metotic foramen/foramen magnum) are likely traced in extant\n\ncrocodylians through their development (Dendy, 1909; Sedlmayr, 2002). For Bissektipelta, we imply that most, if not all, of the venous blood left the endocranial cavity posteriorly through the foramen magnum, with possible additional venous drainage through the metotic foramen via the posterior cerebral vein (sOc and sOc/vCP, Fig. 9A). Sobral et al. (2012) arrived at a similar conclusion regarding the pathway of the posterior cerebral vein in the ornithopod Dysalotosaurus.\n\nA pair of small foramina (fvSo in Fig. 1) directly above the foramen magnum of Bissektipelta apparently transmitted small veins and accompanying arteries (su-praoccipital veins; vSo in Figs. 6A, 7A and 9A). In Sphen-odon, these vessels drain from the dura matter and the dorsal part of the occipital sinus extracranially through similarly distributed foramina (Dendy, 1909).\n\nAlong its course, the dorsal longitudinal sinus receives several transverse veins that drained lateral aspects of the endocranial cavity. We assume the presence of a number of superior cerebral veins that extended along the lateral aspects of the olfactory tract and the anterior cerebrum, dorsal to CN II, as was described for Sphenodon (venae cerebrales superiores; Dendy, 1909) (vSC, Fig. 9A). Additionally, the presence of corresponding but unidentified vessels dorsal to CN II was discussed for Caiman and reported for fossil endocasts (Hopson, 1979). The presence of superior cerebral veins in Bissektipelta is established by numerous small vascular canals that connected the anterior branching plexus and the canal for supraorbital vessels with endocranial dural veins (Fig. 7A). These veins joined the corresponding ethmoid vein/dorsal longitudinal sinus dorsally.\n\nPosteriorly, at the level of CN IV, conspicuous swellings on the endocast and a pair of the orbitocerebral veins on each side indicate the course of a transverse venous sinus (sCT, Fig. 9A, B). The latter received confusing terminology in the literature: vena cerebri posterior in Hopson (1979); sphenotemporal sinus in Sedlmayr (2002); sphenoparietal sinus in Witmer et al. (2008); and cerebrotectal sinus in Porter et al. (2016) and Porter and Witmer (2016). In extant archosaurs, this venous sinus extends dorsally along the tentorial crest to join the dorsal longitudinal sinus and wedges in between the posterior region of the cerebrum and the optic tectum (Hopson, 1979; Sedlmayr, 2002). A series of veins on each side of the brain in the same region (venae begime-nales superiores) was described for Sphenodon (Dendy, 1909). We use the term \"cerebrotectal sinus\", as it clearly reflects the anatomical position of the vessel. In Bissek-tipelta, the cerebrotectal sinus extends transversally as a swelling on the posterior aspect of the cerebral endocast (compare Figs. 4C, 6A, and 9A). The orbitocerebral veins drain into the cerebrotectal sinus from the orbital cavity (vOC in Figs. 6A, 9B). The cerebrotectal sinus directly communicates via small vascular canals with the\n\nmiddle cerebral vein and dorsal head vein/parietal sinus, the posterior branching plexus, and the canal for supraorbital vessels (Figs. 6, 9).\n\nThe succeeding large transverse tributary of the dorsal longitudinal sinus with complicated nomenclature is the middle cerebral vein (vena cerebralis media in Bruner [1907]; transverse sinus in Dendy [1909] and Porter and Witmer [2015]; recessus lateralis of longitudinal sinus in Hopson [1979]; rostral petrosal sinus in Sedlmayr [2002]; cerebellotectal sinus in Porter and Witmer [2016] and Porter et al. [2016]) (vMC, Fig. 9). In extant diapsids, it is a large vessel that extends between the optic tectum and cerebellum, just in front of the otic capsule. At the point of its divergence from the longitudinal sinus, the middle cerebral vein is sinus-like and broad, and thus its dorsal portion was designated the transverse, rostral petrosal, or cerebellotectal sinus (Dendy, 1909; Sedlmayr, 2002; Sampson and Witmer, 2007; Porter and Witmer, 2016a; Porter et al., 2016). Ventrally, the sinus drains into one or several smaller and more defined veins (= middle cerebral vein sensu stricto, e.g., Sampson and Witmer, 2007; trans-versotrigeminal vein of Porter and Witmer [2015]; rostral middle cerebral vein in Paulina-Carabajal et al. [2016]) that frequently pass through the trigeminal foramen ex-tracranially. We use the simpler term \"middle cerebral vein\" for both portions of the vessel (the transverse sinus and its continuations) in an effort to keep the terminology as concise as possible and to ensure compatibility with previous accounts on dinosaurian cranial vasculature (Sampson and Witmer, 2007; Witmer et al., 2008; Miyas-hita et al., 2011; Leahey et al., 2015; Paulina-Carabajal et al., 2016, and others).\n\nIn Bissektipelta, the middle cerebral vein/transverse sinus extends dorsally from the foramen for CN V as a bulge on the endocast surface, then arches posterodor-sally, parallel to the anterior semicircular canal, and finally joins the dorsal longitudinal sinus (Figs. 6A and 9). In Bissektipelta, there is no separate branch of the middle cerebral vein that passes extracranially in the lateral direction through its own canal (= rostral middle cerebral vein of some authors). Thus, the middle cerebral vein likely exited the braincase via the large foramen of CN V. Dorsally, a conspicuous posterodorsally curved swelling on the endocast marks the course of the middle cerebral vein. Here, the middle cerebral vein is laterally confluent with the dorsal longitudinal/occipital sinus (Fig. 9A). Three short vascular branches extend posterodorsally and laterally from the middle cerebral vein on each side of ZIN PH 1/16 (Fig. 7A). These vascular branches connect the middle cerebral vein with the external veins of the temporal and occipital regions of the skull (dorsal head vein, transversooccipital vein, parietal sinus; Figs. 6A, 7A, 9B). Additionally, a separate vessel extends from the anterior-most of the three described vascular branches and connects with the cerebrotectal sinus anteriorly (precisely,\n\nwith the dorsal orbitocerebral vein, Figs. 6A, 9B). As described, the course of the middle cerebral vein in Bissek-tipelta is consistent with observations on extant diapsids (Bruner, 1907; Dendy, 1909; Porter and Witmer, 2015; Porter and Witmer, 2016a; Porter et al., 2016) and various dinosaurs (see Discussion).\n\nThe dorsal head vein and the transverso-occipital vein (caudal middle cerebral vein of some authors) exit the braincase of Bissektipelta via separate foramina on the lateral (nvr+g, Fig. 2B; vCD, Fig. 6B, C) and occipital (ptf, Fig. 1; vTOc, Fig. 7B) surfaces of the skull, correspondingly. However, their endocast suggests that they either represent a single vessel or a continuous anasto-motic loop that extends from the temporal to the occipital region of the skull and maintains the connection with the middle cerebral vein/transverse sinus (Fig. 7A). In Bissektipelta, the groove passes anterior from the foramen of the dorsal head vein (nvr+g in Fig. 2B). This groove corresponds to the continuation of the dorsal head vein; we term this continuation as the parietal sinus (sP, Figs. 6B, 7A, 9B-C) following the terminology of extant squamates (Bruner, 1907; Porter and Witmer, 2015; see also Discussion).\n\nNumerous small openings at the dorsal surface of the skull roof of Bissektipelta lead into the canals within bones that eventually converge ventrally (Fig. 7). This pattern of vascular canals is herein referred to as branching plexus. There are paired anterior and posterior branching plexuses that supplied and drained the skull roof and overlying dermis in Bissektipelta (ABP, Figs. 6-7 and 9). The anterior branching plexus can be subdivided into two parts: one part that lies above the olfactory bulb and the olfactory cavity and is connected ventrally to the ethmoid vessels (olfABP in Fig. 9B) and the other part that lies posteriorly and communicates with the supraorbital vessels ventrally and dural veins medially (ABP in Fig. 9B). Some parts of these canals likely transmitted small branches of the supraorbital artery that pierce the frontal and emerge onto the outer surface of the skull in extant birds (Porter and Witmer, 2016a) and some dinosaurs (Porter, 2015) in a similar way (braSO in Fig. 8). The posterior plexus is situated above the dorsal head vein (PBP in Figs. 6, 9); it is less distinct compared to the anterior plexus and was not visualized on the right side of ZIN PH 1/16. As previously described, small vascular canals integrate the anterior and posterior branching plexuses as well as various endo- and extracranial vessels into a single vascular network around the brain (see Discussion for physiological implications).\n\nDescription of ZIN PH 281/16 (Figs. 10-14)\n\nGeneral comments. ZIN PH 281/16 is exquisitely preserved, with fine features of the external and endocra-nial surfaces and clear sutures and facets. It appears to\n\nbe only slightly smaller compared to the holotype; most of its measurements are only 5-15 % smaller than those for ZIN PH 1/16 (Table 1). The braincase is externally and internally non-pneumatic, as is evident from the CT data.\n\nSkull roof. ZIN PH 281/16 does not preserve bones of the skull roof and has slightly rugose fine facets on its dorsal surface (Figs. 10A, 11A). This indicates that the skull roof was not completely co-ossified with the braincase in this particular specimen. A lack of fusion between the skull roof and braincase is present in adults of Pinacosaurus (Maryanska, 1977; Tumanova, 1987) and Minotaurasaurus (Miles and Miles, 2009; Penkalski and Tumanova, 2017), and the two cranial components are strongly sutured in adult individuals of other anky-losaurs. The unfused skull roof in ZIN PH 281/16, along with open sutures between individual neurocranial elements, indicates that the specimen probably represents a somatically subadult individual.\n\nVentral surface of the basicranium. The ventral aspect of the specimen is formed by the basioccipital posteriorly and the parabasisphenoid anteriorly; the suture between these bones is clearly visible on both the lateral and ventral surfaces (Fig. 10C). Unlike in the holotype, the two bones join at an obtuse angle of approximately 120o. The ventral surface of the basioc-cipital is smoothly arched and bears a vascular foramen (basioccipital fenestra). The triangular ventral surface of the parabasisphenoid bears the base of the fused para-basisphenoid rostrum-interorbital septum anteriorly and small, bump-like basipterygoid processes (left one is broken off), which are offset posteriorly, close to the suture between the basioccipital and parabasisphenoid (Fig. 10D).\n\nOccipital surface. The occipital surface of the specimen is formed by the supraoccipital, basioccipital, and paired otoccipitals; the sutures between these bones are easily recognized, unlike in the holotypic cranium and most other known ankylosaurs (Fig. 11C). The occipital surface forms the same angle of about 125o with the skull roof (inferred from the plane of corresponding facets) as in the holotype. The occipital condyle barely projects beyond the occipital plane. It has a more rounded shape compared to those of the holotype and ZIN PH 2329/16. The otoccipitals form the dorsolateral portions of the condyle. The otoccipital-basioccipital suture is evident on both sides of the specimen (Figs. 11C, 12). The suture extends onto the lateral and endocranial surfaces, where it gradually disappears toward the external and internal openings of the metotic foramen, respectively. The foramen magnum is bounded by the basioccipital ventrally and by the otoccipitals laterally and dorsally. The supraoccipital was probably excluded from the dorsal margin of the foramen magnum by a short dorsal contact between the otoccipitals; however, the latter is\n\nnot preserved. The supraoccipital-otoccipital suture is apparent dorsal to the foramen magnum and further anterolaterally where the supraoccipital reaches the prootic and probably the laterosphenoid on either side (Figs. 12A, 13A).\n\nThe supraoccipital bears a clear sagittal crest with two depressions on its sides (scr, Fig. 11D). These depressions could correspond to the ventral border of the posttemporal fenestra (ptf? in Fig. 11D) and the course of the transverso-occipital vein; they are, however, too close to the sagittal plane compared to the position of the posttemporal fenestra in the holotype (Fig. 1F). Paired canals within the paroccipital processes, just ventral to the contact with the parietal and lateral to the suture with the supraoccipital, almost certainly transmitted vascular elements. These canals could have transmitted some tributaries of the dorsal head/transverso-occipital veins or the occipital artery (vf in Figs. 11D, 12B, 13B). The latter canals are absent in the holotype ZIN PH 1/16; thus, the arrangement of vascular foramina on the occipital surface is variable among the specimens assigned to Bissektipelta. Small paired foramina for the supraoc-cipital vein are present at the suture between the supra-occipital and otoccipital (fvSo, Fig. 11D).\n\nLateral braincase wall. In general, the structure of the lateral wall of the braincase of ZIN PH 281/16, including the distribution of the neurovascular foramina, closely matches that of the holotype. The neurovascular foramina are grouped into anterior and posterior clusters divided by a flattened crista prootica.\n\nThe otoccipital forms most of the posterior aspect of the lateral wall of the braincase and encloses much of the posterior cluster of foramina: the undivided metotic foramen (MF), two or three external foramina of the CN XII (varying between the two sides of the specimen), and partly the fenestra ovalis (FO) and the columellar recess (Fig. 12). These openings are incised ventral to the broad base of the paroccipital process. A pair of grooves begins from the FO and MF and extends distally on the ventral surface of the paroccipital process. The openings for CN XII and the MF are completely enclosed by the otoccipital; the basioccipital is apparently excluded from the external ventral border of the MF (Fig. 12E). The MF is separated from the foramina for CN XII by a laminalike process of the otoccipital that descends anteroven-trally toward the basal tuber. The metotic foramen is separated from the anteriorly situated FO by an oblique crista interfenestralis (= ventral ramus of opisthotic in more basal archosauriforms). The crista interfenestralis is a minor process that is not visible in occipital view. The columellar recess and the FO are bounded by the prootic anteriorly and by the otoccipital posteriorly, which is a common condition for diapsids in general (e.g., Sobral and Müller, 2016). The columellar recess is more open laterally that in the holotype ZIN PH 1/16. It leads into\n\nFig. 10.

It broadly adheres to the anterior surface of the par-occipital process, as in various archosauriforms except crocodylomorphs (character 105 in Nesbitt [2011]). The anterior contact of the prootic with the laterosphenoid is evident on both sides of the specimen. The prootic-supraoccipital contact is not clearly observable, and the ventral contacts of the prootic with the parabasisphenoid\n\nare obliterated. The prootic forms a triangular projection that descends from the dorsal margin of the foramen for\n\nCN V and partially subdivides it.\n\nThe suture between the laterosphenoid and prootic and a prominent capitate process (cap in Figs. 11B, 12B) mark the posterior extent of the laterosphenoid. The latter participates in the anterior margin of the foramen for CN V. It is likely that the laterosphenoid also encloses the orbitocerebral vein openings and the foramen for CN IV. A pair of foramina for the orbitocerebral veins is present on both laterosphenoids; additionally, a groove at the presumed laterosphenoid-frontal contact on both\n\nFig. 11.

An internal vascular canal for the supraorbital vessels was reconstructed for the holotype at this region; the canal is absent in ZIN PH 281/16, indicating a lesser degree of ossification of the braincase wall. The capitate process is stout and bears a rounded head with an unfinished articular surface (Fig. 12A). The facet on its dorsal surface and round head indicate a synovial joint between the laterosphe-noid and the postorbital (Holliday and Witmer, 2008) that was nevertheless akinetic, as in extant crocodylians. The blunt crista antotica (Sampson and Witmer, 2007, and references therein; laterosphenoid buttress in Hol-liday and Witmer [2009]) descends from the capitate process and subdivides the orbital and adductor aspects of the external surface of the laterosphenoid (Fig. 12B,\n\nD). On the left side of ZIN PH 281/16, a groove passes through the crista antotica. It likely indicates the course of the temporoorbital artery/vein (gTO in Fig. 12D).\n\nSutures cannot be distinguished between the preserved elements of the sphenethmoidal complex and between them and the parabasisphenoid. The medial septum that separated the olfactory bulbs is broken off in ZIN PH 281/16, but the preserved surface is symmetrical on both sides and most likely represents a facet (ameth, Fig. 11A). Thus, this medial septum was a separate element (mesethmoid in Miyashita et al. [2011]). It contacted the elements of the lateral wall of the braincase laterally, the parabasisphenoid ventrally, and the skull roof dorsally (based on the holotype that preserves both the medial septum and the skull roof) and was probably continuous anteriorly with the ossified nasal septum as\n\nCR+FO CN VII bP*\n\nbt\n\nfaCC\n\nFig. 12.

Features of the complex external surface of the sphenethmoidal complex include prominent vertical striations dorsal to the foramen for CN II (possible site of attachment of the preorbital septum; ectethmoid in Miyashita et al. [2011]) and multiple grooves, ridges, and bumps around the foramen for CN II (indicating courses of neurovas-cular elements and possible attachment sites of ocular musculature).\n\nThe parabasisphenoid constitutes most of the an-teroventral aspect of the lateral surface of the braincase (Fig. 12A, C). Paired grooves mark the course of CN VI from the dorsum sellae toward the external surface of the braincase, bypassing the hypophyseal cavity (Figs. 12D, 13). The participation of the prootic in the canal for CN VI is not clear. A large foramen for the cerebral carotid artery is present on either side of the specimen (faCC in Fig. 12B, D). The breakage of the specimen anterior to the cerebral carotid foramen on both sides makes the\n\ninterpretation of certain foramina challenging. On the left side, the anterior rounded margin of a foramen is preserved (faSP?, Fig. 12D). This opening is comparable in size to the foramen for the cerebral carotid artery. Dorsal to it, the bone is broken, and no additional foramina could be identified. On the right side, the margin of a small-sized foramen is preserved anterior to the foramen for CN VI (faSP?, Fig. 12B). It is half as large as the abovementioned foramen on the left side but is located at the same level as the latter. Considering the position of these foramina, both of them could equally likely represent foramina for the sphenopalatine artery or foramina for CN III. In the latter case, the sphenopal-atine artery would have branched off from the cerebral carotid artery before the latter entered the hypophyseal cavity in ZIN PH 281/16. However, as the nature of foramen for CN III is controversial in the holotype (see above), we assume that these foramina represent exits of the sphenopalatine artery (faSP?, Fig. 12B, D).

The endocranial surface of ZIN PH 281/16 does not differ significantly from that of the holotype in the general division into regions or the distribution of neurovascular foramina (Fig. 13). Its surface is mostly smooth, indicating a loose infilling by the brain. Vertical striations at the surface of the cavity for the olfactory tract probably result from a closer contact between the brain and its dura with the walls of the brain-case (Fig. 13A). Most sutures on the endocranial surface are obliterated; however, the basioccipital-otoccipital, basioccipital-parabasisphenoid, and prootic-otoccipital sutures are visible (Fig. 13A). The straight basioccipital-otoccipital sutures extend ventral to the internal foramina for CN XII and disappear towards the MF and la-genar fossae. The suture between the basioccipital and parabasisphenoid extends transversally between large, unossified lagenar fossae. The basioccipital apparently forms most of the ventral endocranial surface. Possible\n\nprootic-otoccipital sutures extend as ridges on the preserved surface of both otic capsules.\n\nA single transverse canal for CN II opens laterally on either side in a separate foramen (Fig. 13C). The hypophyseal cavity is comparatively shallow, nearly half the dorsoventral depth of the cerebral cavity above it. The tentorial crest separating the cerebral and cerebellar cavities appears to be prominent and sharp at its dorsal part; it is broken off ventrally on both sides and the canal for CN VI is exposed (Fig. 13B). The dorsum sellae preserves the central triangular projection. Posterodor-sally in the prootic, a foramen leads into two canals, one anteroventral (for CN VII) and the other posterodorsal into the otic capsule (for CN VIII) (Fig. 13C). The medial walls of both otic capsules are largely unossified, and two huge lagenar fossae are present on the floor of the endo-cranium (ves+lagf in Fig. 13B). Anterodorsal to the otic capsule, a distinct fossa is present on either side, which is not particularly evident in the holotype (floc, Fig. 13C). These depressions correspond in their position to the\n\nfloccular (auricular) fossae in other archosaurs (Gower, 2002; Sampson and Witmer, 2007; Witmer et al., 2008; Sobral et al., 2016). Each fossa has a pair of sediment-filled openings at the bottom that apparently connect to the inner ear cavities within the bone (the CT data offer insufficient resolution to trace these structures with confidence). These foramina likely transmitted vessels to the inner ear labyrinth. Although the external foramina for CN XII vary in number (two or three) between both sides of the specimen, there are three internal openings on either side (Fig. 13C).\n\nEndocast. The digital "
