        "text": "The scientific publications of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County have been issued at irregular intervals in three major series; the articles in each series are numbered individually, and the numbers run consecutively, regardless of the subject matter. • Contributions in Science, a miscellaneous series of technical papers describing original research in the life and earth sciences. • Science Bulletin, a miscellaneous series of monographs describing original research in the life and earth sciences. This series was discontinued in 1978 with the issue of Numbers 29 and 30; monographs are now published by the museum in Contributions in Science. • Science Series, long articles and collections of papers on natural history topics. Copies of the publications in these series are sold through the Museum Book Shop. A catalog is available on request. The museum also publishes Technical Reports, a miscellaneous series containing information relative to scholarly inquiry and collect...\n\nAbstract The entire catalogued paleontological collection of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science (NMMNH), including 35,902+ fossils from New Mexico, is now online and searchable by the general public, avocational paleontologist, researcher, and geoscience educator. The Web site does not include sensitive geographic localities, but all aspects of the taxonomy, stratigraphy, and chronology of the specimens are viewable at http://164.64. 119.14/nmmnh/web/default. html.\n\nTerrestrial vertebrate remains were recovered from sediments that lie on remnants of the lowest marine wave-cut platform between Point Buchon and Point San Luis. Uranium series ages of these samples, which range from 83 to about 49 ka suggest a correlation to late Pleistocene climatic and eustatic events associated with marine oxygen isotope substage Sa, and establish a maximum age of &quot;&#39;&quot; 80 ka for the occurrence of terrestrial mammal fossils. The Point San Luis area assemblage appears typical of the late Pleistocene regional vertebrate paleo­ fauna from west-central California. Five mammalian taxa are added to the Pleis­ tocene record from San Luis Obispo County. Equus sp. cf. E. occidentalis, Ca­ mclops sp. cf. C. hesternus, and Bison antiquus were recovered from the Point San Luis area, and A1ammut americanum and B. latiffons from near Morro Bay and the Carrizo Plains in eastern San Luis Obispo County.\n\nPaleontologic localities of significant scientific value occur on public lands in California. Some localities private land on are administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the United States Forest Service (USFS) for their mineral resources. There is now an-opportunity to protect non-renewable palaeontologic resources through establishment of Areas of Critical Environmental Concern or through cooperative agreements with private institutions and other public agencies prior to these resources being lost, vandalized or developed for on-paleontological purposes. As a positive example, cooperation between governmental agencies and private institutions has resulted in the preservation and appropriate curation of palaeontologic resources from public land' These localities are important not only because they contain significant palaeontologic resources, but because they are field repositories offering insight to past community dynamics and structural activities of the crust, and offer data regarding rates and amounts of fault offset which directly effects the health and safety of California residents. The key to management of paleontological resources are (1) inventory, 2) cyclic prospecting for protection, and (3) curation of specimens into retrievable institutional storage to allow research and reporting."
