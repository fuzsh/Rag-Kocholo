This exciting book from Joe Haldeman sets the stage for an exciting trilogy and won him the awards for the Best Novel from the Hugo and Nebula Awards.

Now he is being shuttled through time and space as a soldier who has been conscripted to fight in this 1000-year war.He will be expected to perform his duties and might even be able to rise through the ranks.\n\nWhile Mandella never actually wanted to take the ticket and ride the train to war, he doesn’t have a choice about it. If that’s what the military leaders say that he does, then that is what he does.\n\nMandella is doing his best to get along and not rock the boat. His grand plan is to do what he has to in order to survive the ordeal and go home. The enemy is an alien that cannot be known and they appear to be unable to be conquered, not to mention very far away. But that is what Earth’s leaders want; to take on the alien and try to win the war in the process. They’re drawing a line in the sand.\n\nEven though he’s going to war, William has no idea that his true test will begin once he gets back home. Like Odysseus returning from afar, his trials are not over. And space travel is not what it seems to be. Because of the fluctuations caused by time dilation from his travels, Private William Mandella is now aging just months. But the planet is aging centuries at the same time. They’re on two different wavelengths, and they are never going to be able to catch up. His journey back home is not what he thought that it would be.\n\nWilliam finds that what he thought would be the same place waiting for him has radically changed. Even though he survived the war, he isn’t able to find the home that he thought he would be returning to. In fact, he might never be able to go home again. With a heavy heart, William must learn to go on and adapt to the place he finds himself. It might not be the same home that he remembers, but it will have to do. Can Private Mandella adapt to the new place he finds himself into, or will he be emotionally destroyed by the loss of what he knew?

Julian is a soldier who is totally burned out on the war. But he does have one thing, and that is the company of Dr. Amelia Harding.\n\nAmelia and Julian are lovers, and when they make a discovery together one day it could change everything. What they find could change the universe forever and put everything back to the way it was at the start. This could stop the war machine and end everything for good, ending the destruction of life once and for all. The Ngumi War could be ended tomorrow.\n\nThe soldier and the scientist are now faced with the ultimate temptation to fix everything for good and end the war.
