        "text": "Still one of the best,and well narrated.\n\nMany years have passed since I have read this excellent book, it still rates for me as one of the best sci-fi reads. Not too much battle action, just enough romance and for a story, spread as the name suggests, over many centuries, it is entirely believable.\n\nThe main characters are entirely believable as well.\n\nWritten before many of our 2010 incarnations of technology, the authors mind picture of the immediate future is very close to reality but also much that he describes as happening in the far off future is real today.\n\nJoe's depictions of society and his assumption that homosexuality would become more accepted prove very close to actuality, although happening earlier than Joe anticipated.\n\nAltogether a great listen, well narrated.\n\nIf you missed this and like Heinlein, Moorecock, Aldiss, Asimov and the like, give it a go you wont be disappointed... Brian\n\nAnti-War?...Might be...\n\n\"Back in the 20th century they had established-to everyone's satisfaction-that \"I was just following orders\" was an inadequate excuse for inhuman conduct\". But what can you do when the orders come from deep down in that puppet master of the unconscious?\"\n\nA story that goes beyond stories. Is what Forever War is.\n\nHomosexuality is used as a means of birth control. Currency takes the form of \"Kilo-calories\" (K) as the world-at that time-has become dependent upon food consumption and inadequate regulation. Frivolous excursions with accumulated capital. Injury and regeneration. Loss of love. The last campaign of the over 1300 year Forever War; successful due to a \"stasis field\".\n\nUnderstandably, there are some very strong insinuations in the novel. But the writing and story are one, how do you say...for the books. I highly recommend this novel, no matter your stance on military actions.\n\nGreat Listen\n\nIf you could sum up The Forever War in three words, what would they be?\n\nThought provoking, entertaining\n\nWhat did you like best about this story?\n\nThe authors careful attention to detail and interesting yet believable future worlds.\n\nWhich scene was your favorite?\n\nThe returns to the Earth with grand seperations in time.\n\nDid you have an extreme reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry?\n\nIt made me think.\n\nAn incredibly technical war book\n\nI don't think I have ever read so much physics in a fiction but the story was fun overall. Enders game is a little lighter reading. This is hard core science fiction.\n\nA good use of time\n\nWell writing and a good linear story. Some interesting physic's but it lacked personal development and I didn't connect with the main character.\n\nDated but still holds up\n\nWhat made the experience of listening to The Forever War the most enjoyable?\n\nI had heard about this book but never had been able to get around to reading it. Its a very interesting story with regards to the issue of near light speed travel and time dilation and the impact it has on the lives of the soldiers who travel back to Earth. I do reccommend this book highly.\n\nSo glad I discovered this scifi classic\n\nMy main comment about this book is the narrator: he was completely perfect. He brought the main character fully to life, which really added a great dimension to the story for me. There is a lot of military jargon and battle scenes which might have been a struggle to read through, but delivered in the first person narration it all worked. He was also able to present other characters in an engaging way. I especially liked the strange diction of one person William meets while recovering from injury and the laconic style of Charlie in the last section.\n\nThe story was episodic and thus the narrative momentum was uneven. But there was a lot to like and a ton of intriguing ideas about how warfare and society might develop over the centuries.\n\nClassic with classic issues\n\nI can see why this book is a classic and why it won the awards when it did. It does have material that is dated. It is not misogynistic as Heilien’s Strange in a Strange Land, but does contain dated views of homosexuality and women. It is a good commentary on war and the odd experience of the soldiers that fight.\n\nIt is a worthwhile read and useful exploration of what it would be like to essentially not age in during a thousand year war."
