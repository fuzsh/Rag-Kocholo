        "text": "Dawn is a post-apocalyptic tale with a twist. Protagonist Lilith Iyapo is here to help rebuild civilization, but she has a little bit of help. In fact, she and the other apocalypse survivors have been held in a cryo-sleep by aliens for hundreds of years. The aliens aren’t in it for charity, though: they genetically merge with the humans, meaning that the humans repopulating our planet won’t quite be human at all.\n\nStill not convinced? Lupita N'yongo gave the book a glowing review, listing it as one of her favorites: \"I was stunned by how relevant the themes of the book are to today. I did not imagine that sci-fi would be an enjoyable genre to get into for me, but Butler writes with such a familiarity that the alien is welcome and intriguing. She really artfully exposes our human impulse to self-destruct.\"\n\nHumans have long dreamed of making contact with an alien species. But if we found them, what would we say? In this brilliant and thoughtful novel, Russell tells the story of a Jesuit Priest and master linguist who is charged with communicating with our extraterrestrial counterparts for the first time—and emerges from the event broken and maimed.\n\nHaldeman’s 1970s book ranks among the most famous sci-fi warfare novels ever written. In The Forever War, the reader returns to Earth with conscripted soldier William Mandella. Thanks to relativity and Mandella’s high-speed space travel, the Earth has undergone decades of change over a period that has only felt like two years to Mandella. The Forever War captures the feeling of returning from the front in a way that remains evocative and relevant to this day, and it earned Haldeman both the Nebula and the Hugo.\n\nThe Girl With All the Gifts is a moving and personal thriller. In a world where mankind has reached the brink of extinction thanks to a zombie-like infection, one girl represents the hopes of our whole species. But in the process of saving the human race, what are scientists and people in power willing to do to her?\n\nThe Earth is doomed, but that doesn’t mean you have to give up on your job. In The Last Policeman, an oddball detective refuses to give up on his final case. His job is to solve a murder, and he’s determined to get it done. So what if a meteor is destined to obliterate the Earth in a mere six months?"
