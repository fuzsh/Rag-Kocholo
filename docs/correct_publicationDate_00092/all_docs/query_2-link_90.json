        "text": "written by David Steffen\n\nThis is the first year that I’ve chosen to pay for a supporting membership to Worldcon.Â This is where the Hugo awards, the fan-based major award of the science fiction community, are presented.Â Paying for a supporting membership not only gives you the right to nominate and to vote, but also gives you the Hugo packet, a package containing most of the individual Hugo nominated works and examples of work from Hugo nominated individuals and magazines.Â That’s a load of bargain-priced brand-new fiction at $50.\n\nNow, I should mention that I don’t think that the Hugos are generally indicative of the best science fiction and fantasy out there.Â Many of the nominees and winners I just find perplexing, often dull or unimaginative, and some authors get nominated every year even when it seems entirely clear to me that they are just “phoning it in” and the fans somehow feel that they are obligated to vote for this person.\n\nAnother thing I should add is that I only ended up getting registered on July 19th, a relative latecomer to the registration.Â The Hugo voting deadline was on July 31st, and I had only read a few of the entries.Â So to fully vote, I had more reading to do than I had time to do it.Â So for this first installment I’ll only be covering those categories in which I had a chance to absorb enough of the content that I feel comfortable making an informed vote.Â For each category I’ll list my first choice as well as any others that I was close to voting for.\n\nBest Novella\n\n1.Â The Man Who Bridged the Mist by Kij Johnson\n\nAn Imperial engineer travels to a small town on the banks of a mist-river to connect two halves of the empire.Â Novellas in general tend to be too slow for my tastes.Â This one is as slow as most, but I felt like it really used the space effectively.Â I really felt like I knew the characters by the end and I wanted them to be happy.\n\n2.Â Kiss Me Twice by Mary Robinette Kowal\n\nThis one was a close contender for my top pick.Â It’s an effective science fiction mystery story, which uses the SF effectively as more than just a backdrop.Â Mystery generally isn’t my favorite genre or I might’ve picked this as the top instead.\n\nBest Novelette\n\n1.Â Ray of Light by Brad R. Torgerson\n\nBrad’s a friend, but I didn’t pick his story because of that.Â I truly thought that this was the best of the group.Â It made me care about the characters.Â This takes place in a future Earth where inexplicable aliens have come and put up a shield between Earth and the sun so that the earth freezes over.Â The only humans who lived are those who fled deep below the ocean’s surface to live in underwater colonies.Â Nobody expects the surface to be thawed for several more lifetimes, but when a group of teenagers goes missing, a father goes to investigate.\n\n2.Â Six Months, Three Days by Charlie Jane Anders\n\nA story about a romance between a man who can see the future and a woman who can see a variety of possible futures.Â I enjoyed reading this one as well, though its appeal was more of a thought experiment than the emotional connection I am more typically looking for.\n\nBest Short Story\n\n1.Â The Paper Menagerie by Ken Liu\n\nThe story of the son of a Chinese mail-order bride and the emotional connection she tries to make with him.Â Heartbreaking on several levels, this story really made me watch for more Ken Liu stories.\n\n2.Â Shadow War of the Night Dragons:Â Book 1:Â The Dead City:Â Prologue by John Scalzi\n\nThis story was posted as an April Fool’s joke last year on Tor.com, formatted as an excerpt from an upcoming Scalzi novel.Â It was based on a previous blog post analyzing the most common words used in fantasy novel titles.Â John Scalzi took this as a challenge, and wrote this beast of a title, and the story itself is just as funny, making fun of all the common epic fantasy cliches.Â I heard Scalzi read this live at MiniCon 2011, and the live performance made it even better.\n\n3.Â Movement by Nancy Fulda\n\nThe story of a child with “temporal autism”, although the story says explicitly that it is not actually autism but is has some common symptoms.Â The girl does not think on the same timescale as everyone around her, this story is about her efforts to understand the world around her on her own terms.\n\nBest Dramatic Presentation (Long Form)\n\n1.Â Hugo\n\nAwesome Martin Scorsese movie adapted from the children’s book titled The Invention of Hugo Cabret.ÂÂFollows an orphan boy living in the mechanical depths of a train station in Paris in 1931.Â The main storyline itself is really great, but it was very effective at showing the magical appeal of early cinema in the few decades before that.\n\n2.Â Game of Thrones Season 1\n\nI haven’t read any of George R. R. Martin’s books in this series, so this was my first exposure to them.Â The casting is amazing across the board, the special effects are great, great characters, great plot.Â Not a lot of fantasy in it, though there are a few select key places of fantasy, as the name implies much of it revolves around political maneuvering to rule countries.Â Great stuff, and it makes me want to read the books.Â Now if Martin would only ever finish writing them.\n\nBest Dramatic Presentation (Short Form)\n\n1.Â Remedial Chaos Theory (Community)\n\nThis is one of the best shows on TV right now anyway, but this episode was above and beyond.Â It begins with a simple enough premise.Â The study group that the show centers around is at one of their apartments, and have ordered in some pizza.Â The apartment building’s door buzzer is broken, so when the pizza man arrives, someone has to go down to retrieve it.Â Nobody wants to, so they roll a die to decide.Â From there the episode splits into 6 timelines, each one with a different person going down to get the pizza.Â It doesn’t sound that interesting, but a lot of small variations add up to major and differing consequences between each timeline.Â I’m hoping for another Hugo nomination next year for the Community episode “Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne”, in which Pierce and the rest of the study group have to play a very complex 8-bit video game to earn Pierce’s inheritance.Â Brilliant.Â I wanted to play that game so much!\n\nBest Editor (Short Form)\n\n1.Â Neil Clarke\n\n2.Â John Joseph Adams\n\n3.Â Sheila Williams\n\n4.Â Stanley Schmidt\n\nBest Artist\n\n1.Â Dan Dos Santos\n\nI just think that Dos Santos’s artwork is the best out there today.Â I have a signed print of his illustration of Moiraine that was published in ebook rerelease of the Wheel of Time series.\n\nBest Magazine\n\n1.Â Apex\n\n2.Â Lightspeed\n\nBest Fan Artist\n\n1.Â Maurine Starkey\n\nBest Fancast\n\n1.Â SF Signal Podcast\n\nI like the SF Signal site anyway, but I really liked the discussion in the example episode with a lot of recognizable names about the future of the publishing industry\n\n2.Â SF Squeecast\n\nA Christmas themed episode that was a lot of fun.Â All of the members of the group are clearly having fun while they tape, and they really comes across.\n\n3.Â Galactic Suburbia Podcast\n\nBest New Writer\n\n1.Â Mur Lafferty\n\nStrange to think that she counts as a new writer because I’ve been listening to her stuff for years on the Escape Artists podcasts, and hearing about her self-published books.Â I really like her style though, some of my favorite EA episodes have been written by her.\n\nAs the year rolls on I’ll be reading the rest of the Hugo packet just for fun, at which point I might have more posts to pick out my favorites.Â And this is also the first year that I’ve been eligible for SFWA membership, which means that I can now nominate and vote for the Nebula award–so I may have something about that as well.\n\nwritten by Frank Dutkiewicz\n\nWe have another month of reviews for you! Thank you to those who helped me to smoke out find Mr Anonymous. His reviewing talents were desperately needed missed here. Now on to the good stuff.\n\nA woman counts the tragedies in her life in “Seven Losses of Na Re” by Rose Lemburg (debut 5/1 and reviewed by Frank D).\n\nThe author of “Seven Losses” uses her own memories as a template for this story. The subject of this depressing tale is of a Ukrainian Jewish peasant girl who tells of events in her life ranging from Stalin’s oppression into the later years of the Soviet Union.\n\nAlicia finds comfort with a friends creation in “Clem” by Cassandra Rose Clarke (debut 5/2 and reviewed by Frank D). Clem, Alicia’s close friend and co-worker, has passed away. She evades her colleagues by eating her lunch in Clem’s old office. After four days of dining in her departed friend’s work environment, the computer that Clem created speaks to Alicia.\n\nThere wasn’t much to this piece. It was a type of story I have seen before, two people connect by a common friend who has died that become fast friends. What made it different was that one of the people was a machine. I had trouble buying that the office Clem worked in would be left vacant yet her equipment would be left undisturbed as if she were on a vacation. It was a hole in the premise that felt should have been filled.\n\nThe boogeyman returns to the protagonist’s life to ask for a favor in “An Old Acquaintance” by K. G. Jewell (debut 5/3 and reviewed by Frank D). It seems times have gotten hard for Oscar (the name the protagonist has given his boogeyman). Kids have night lights and stay up later these days. He needs a referral, and the much older protagonist has just the kid in mind.\n\nThis story is short so I won’t reveal any more of this very delightful and funny tale. I enjoyed it immensely.\n\nRecommended.\n\nBecca has a special relationship with her departed uncle in “Dancing in the Dark” by Stephanie Burgis (debut 5/4 and reviewed by Frank D). Becca’s family is getting smaller. Both of her parents have just died. Now her uncles Kev and Rom care for her and her brother Billy. Jack died in a robbery years before but keeps Becca company. A photo she has of him with an old girlfriend is what keeps him around. Only she can see Jack, and she sees him in a different light when the strange woman in the photo shows up at the front door one day.\n\n“Dancing” is a sad tale. The grim tone of it made it difficult for me to enjoy. However, after reading the author’s comments on the inspiration of the piece, I can see that the tale was a work of therapy for the author. I did find the end satisfying.\n\nSylvia wants to know from her parents when they’ll be going on their yearly vacation in “One Childhood of Many” by Andrew S. Fuller (debut 5/7 and reviewed by Frank D). Sylvia is eager to start the family trip to Lake Moo-noo fHul-pa, a magical place fitting Ã¢â‚¬ËœAlice in Wonderland’. She speaks of the spectacular things they do every year there.\n\n“One Childhood” reads more like a spoiled and bored child’s wool gathering in her over active imagination, which may be what the tale was all about in the end.\n\n“The Rush of the Wind and the Roar of the Engines, and the Call of the Open Road” by Lavie Tidhar (debut 5/8 and reviewed by Dustin Adams) is more of a summation, or a cataloging. For a moment I thought perhaps a character was on a super-futuristic ride, a history of a local portion of the universe, but no. Maybe?\n\nThe writing was fine, but I think this story would work best upon a second read. There could be nuances here I didn’t catch reading it though only once. However, I find stories without characters difficult to latch on to. Especially one spanning a time frame, and divulging a history. In the end, I have to ask myself if it’s worth committing this litany of fictional facts to memory.\n\nI’ll skip the second read.\n\nThe protagonist travels to the Great Library of Tourmaline to read the Tome in “The Tome of Tourmaline” by Ken Liu (debut 5/9 and reviewed by Frank D). The words in the book have power. Power of the inner wonder in each person. It is mysterious, moving, and magical. The story within is the story each person needs to read for themselves. What is in it? You’ll have to read the Tome for yourself to find out.\n\nIf you are looking for a story as marvelous as the fictional book in “The Tome”, you might as well pass this story by. This tale is only about how one man is moved by words and a tale you will never see. So what is the point of “The Tome”, you may ask? This story was an exercise in prose. Ken Liu demonstrates on how writing a story that is only about a person reading a story, can be done so well. Even the ending to this piece I found intriguing.\n\n“The Tome” is a tale for writers and serves as a lesson on how to write well.\n\nIn “Wrong World” by Steve J Myers (debut 5/10 and reviewed by Anonymous) the story is delivered as a monologue to doctor (psychiatrist, methinks…). The main character is explaining why he was picked up by the police, naked and ranting on the highway.\n\nThe story glances at the idea of a multiverse; a theory that every possibility can happen and does happen in other versions of the universe and there exist an infinite number of universes.\n\nIt’s a nice idea to think that in some universe, by making a different decision at some crucial point in your life, you are a rich and famous author, loved by all (or perhaps that’s just me…). In ‘Wrong World’ –the title kinda gives it away–things don’t go as planned for the main character.\n\nI found this story mildly entertaining. The main hook is the explanation of events leading up to the main character being arrested running down the highway naked. I found motivations a little lacking–someone who has saved money for years suddenly risking it all on the roulette table based on some knowledge of physics seemed a little far-fetched. No doubt people do odd things, but I’d want some reason for their sudden change in character (stopped taking his meds?). Turning thirty wasn’t enough for me.\n\n“Great White Ship” by Lou Antonelli (debut 5/11 and reviewed by James Hanzelka).\n\nA traveler stuck waiting for a flight strikes up a conversation with an old airline employee. The Old Timer tells him a story of a Great White Airship that arrives from a most unusual destination. The story of a craft from an alternate reality and how it got there is only the precursor to the final act.\n\nThis is one of my favorite stories from this site. I have a great passion for lighter-than-air craft and their potential as a future means of transport, which opens the story. The author uses this speculation to launch into an engaging tale. As fascinating as the main story line is, the alternate history premise that accompanies it is just as worthwhile. This story was well written and very well thought out. It is well worth the read.\n\nRecommended.\n\nThe family hears the call in “The Call” by Erin M. Hartshorn (debut 5/14 and reviewed by James Hanzelka), a summons to adventure and new worlds. It’s a call that ends in death; yet it’s a call that none can ignore. Ash heard it first and has answered his last call. His sister has heard it at times, but she know his oldest child is hearing it more strongly, and far too early. When she finally hears it clearly, can she ignore it? Even if she must to protect Ash’s child?\n\nThis is a good story about family, far off adventures and unheeded callings. I like the way the author built the suspense and mystery in a short story set in a single venue. She also touched on how differently our destiny calls each one of us. Nicely crafted tale and well written prose.\n\n“Dragoman” by Helen Jackson (debut 5/15 and reviewed by Frank D). Amanda is the only person who can save the planet from giant lizards, so the story begins. She is a young girl who plays two grandfathers to get what she wants, and she wants a lizard for a pet. The lizards like to dance, and Amanda seems to know what their steps mean.\n\n“Dragoman” starts as a rivalry between two grandpas. The tale drifts away from that subplot and becomes a completely different story. It made me wonder if half the story was needed to tell this tale.\n\nYoung Jason is on the run from a monster in “Monsters Big and Small” by Jakob Drud (debut 5/16 and reviewed by Frank D). Jason is a troubled child. He just hurt another child and his single parent father is furious at him. His teachers say he is filled with anger, but Jason has a bigger worry; there is a monster under his bed.\n\n“Monsters” is a tale where metaphors become reality. Jason is afraid. He really doesn’t believe he is an angry boy but he knows that he is scared. He feels alone and frightened. What he needs is someone to slay his monster for him. Salvation comes from a person who is familiar yet a stranger to him.\n\nIt is a very rare feat when an author can write a metaphor within a metaphor. This is a very good story, one worth reading.\n\nAn Ark to the stars is man’s last chance in “Hoist With an Ark to the Stars” by David Glen Larson (debut 5/17 and reviewed by Frank D). A comet is headed straight towards the Earth. All attempts to stop it have failed. The Ark is the vessel that will repair the Earth. Filled with the genetic make-up of the planet, it is set for a half million year journey back to its home.\n\n“Hoist” is told from the eyes of a janitor left roaming in the most important room in history. The fate of Earth has been sealed, but there is no time like the present time for cleanliness. The silliness of that notion was just one of the problems with the premise that I had. The ending to this piece is one that I have seen before.\n\nJohn is marooned on a wasteland in “The Vault” by Leslie Claire Walker (debut 5/18 and reviewed by Frank D), and discovers he has brought with him what he hoped to escape from. John has crashed on a world others avoid. He has done so intentionally but finds his most precious possession in the vault of the ship, his 15 year old daughter, Reya.\n\nJohn wants to know why his daughter would stow away. She has questions of her own for her father. John discovers the answers are what he was escaping from all along. His journey to get lost becomes an opportunity to be found.\n\n“The Vault” is a voyage of self-discovery. Items John has lost and forgotten about, are found with his daughter’s help. A moment in the story shows the wayward soul what true loss is all about. Although heartwarming, I found this tale to be a slow solving puzzle. It took half of the tale for me to figure out what the real dilemma to the story was. By then, any sympathy I had for John’s blight was long gone.\n\nThe protagonist is waiting for her magical moment in “Fantasies” by Jasmine Fahmy (debut 5/21 and reviewed by Frank D). She counts the day on her calendar, waiting for a letter, sign, event that she has read about in the many books that she has read.\n\n“Fantasies” is a cute tale. My own daughter went through the same dilemma the over-imaginative child in this tale goes through. A very enjoyable tale.\n\n“The Numbers” by Timothy Moore (debut 5/22 and reviewed by James Hanzelka).\n\nThe world is plugged in, tied together to the point where everyone can view each other’s emotions. Everyone lives vicariously through the eyes of others. Parties and hedonism is the rule. Danny feels out of place, a schmuck lost in the sea of beautiful people. Now they are sending out numbers, the sum total of you as a being. Danny is sure his will be the source of amusement, something to provide comic relief to the world. He is astonished when they are shown, but he has forgotten how saints are treated in their own land.\n\nThis story was well written and shows us a glimpse of a possible future. One where idle frivolity is the rule of the day. Where individuals derive pleasure from the joy and misery of others. Into this the author has placed a genuine good person, one who actually cares for others. The story of what happens is a well written and well thought out cautionary tale. This is a good read.\n\nThe protagonist searches the bookstore for something to fill her empty life in “Wishes” by Patricia Ash (debut 5/23 and reviewed by James Hanzelka), something to provide brightness she doesn’t have. She finds it in a book titled “Wishes”. She finds more than she bargained for. She finds peace, but will others see it the same way?\n\nThis story is a nice little fable. A story of finding solace and our place in the world. A story of finding something that someone else couldn’t understand. It’s also a fable about finding happiness where you least expect it. This is a good story.\n\nRecommended.\n\nIn “Pocket” by Elizabeth Creith (debut 5/24 and reviewed by Anonymous), a customer at a cafe notices how the pretty waitress, Zenobia (Zen for short) is able to produce, from her tiny pocket, whatever customers need– extra creamer, sugar, ketchup, etc. It is a very small pocket…\n\nHe turns up one day unexpectedly and discovers a little too much…\n\nThis very short story was nicely done. It is well-written and subtle with a nice tone throughout. I liked the ending, although a touch more explanation wouldn’t have gone amiss. I would give the story 5 out 7 rocket dragons.\n\n“Ballad of a Hot Air Balloon-Headed Girl” by Douglas F. Warrick (debut 5/25 and reviewed by James Hanzelka).\n\nA young man trains to be a soldier and loves a girl who fantasizes her head will burst into flame and carry her away. The girl has fashioned a balloon to catch the heat from the conflagration and attached it to her body. The boy like to climb trees. As the young man is drawn into the harsh realities of war, the young woman becomes more enmeshed in her fantasy. The girl begins to change, but so does the young man. Finally they have grown apart and she makes a final appeal for him to leave reality and join her, but he cannot. He spends the rest of his life regretting the decision, finally trying to join the girl, but is it too late. Has the chance passed him by, or can he regain what was lost?\n\nThis is a tale that interweaves the harsh reality of war and politics with pure fantasy. The author does a good job of playing off both storylines and intersecting them in the lives of two young lovers. The writing is vivid and well structured; though it was long I found it easy to read. The story will not be for everyone, but if you invest the time your will be rewarded.\n\nA man toys with death in “Endgame” by Thomas Canfield (debut 5/28 and reviewed by Frank D). The protagonist in this tale has received his death machine. It is set at 30 seconds and counts down from there. The voice is seductive, inviting. Once the machine is started, the time cannot be reset but can be stopped. It is scary and alluring.\n\n“Endgame” is about dancing with death. Your own means of expiration is in your hands. What will death be like? What will I feel when it comes? The questions have an answer, it is all a matter if your curiosity is stronger than will for preservation. Good story but if it were me, I would have bought a safe and locked the damn thing inside.\n\nA pair of research scientists conduct a series of interviews with the were-people in “Brief Interviews With Therianthropes” by Marissa Lingen & Alec Austin (debut 5/29 and reviewed by Frank D). Dr’s Yue and Bjornson contact and question the werewolf, were-bear, were-orca, and such, of society, trying to determine how they fit into today’s world.\n\nThis is an amusing tale. A fun piece to read.\n\nIn “The Girl She Truly Was” by Lauren K. Moody (debut 5/30 and reviewed by Anonymous) Ms Moody re-tells the story of Cinderella. The only difference between this and the classic fairytale is that Cinderella is born a boy, but feels as though he should be girl–what we call gender dysphoria nowadays. Apart from that, the story pretty much unfolds the way you’d expect, with magic filling the gaps and making the whole thing work.\n\nIt was well written, but since the twist of the story (what makes it unique) happens at the beginning, the rest of the story seems a little predictable as barely changes from the original.\n\nThe protagonist is meeting her alien hybrid daughter for the first time in “Sapience and Maternal Instincts” by Krystal Claxton (debut 5/31 and reviewed by Frank D). Twenty years later, she can see a bit of herself in her alien offspring. Gathering the nerve to meet her was difficult but they do share a bloodline, and a bit more she soon discovers.\n\n“Sapience” is a unique twist on the parent/child reunion trope. Like a mother who is meeting the child she gave up for adoption, the protagonist is full of anxiety. Unlike those women, she was forced to carry the daughter who is sitting before her. The story evolves into something sweet and loving. I found myself as surprised at the outcome as the protagonist did.\n\nRecommended.\n\nMaking the List\n\nWhile looking for material to post here, I found this delightful reviewing site, BestScienceFictionStories. The ezine reviews speculative fiction spanning several decades with links of where you can find them. I just read and enjoyed the sites administrator’s (Rusty) assessment of OSC’s award winning novelette Ender’s Game.\n\nRusty invites guests to post a review and I found one done by an Amanda Watson. She lists the top four magazines new writers should consider when they are submitting their speculative fiction tales. Daily SF ranked # 3 on her list (behind Lightspeed and Clarkesworld). Here is a short excerptÃ¢â‚¬\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Daily Science Fiction publishes a relatively high volume of stories, many new writers find it to be an excellent site to use as a vehicle to establish themselves in the science fiction writing world. Just don’t be surprised if your first few submissions to this magazine don’t make the cutÃ¢â‚¬\n\n#4 on her list is Asimov’s (never a bad thing when you can beat Asimov’s on a list). I found that I agreed with most of Ms Watson’s advice, but heading my list of the greatest understatements of the year, she writesÃ¢â‚¬\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Don’t get discouraged if your story doesn’t get published by one of the magazines listed aboveÃ¢â‚¬\n\nPlease, please don’t be discouraged if you don’t get published by any of the publications on her list but plan on buying a sheet of drywall if you do. You will need to repair the hole in the ceiling your head made when you jumped for joy when you received your acceptance.\n\nUnidentified Funny Objects edited by Alex Shvartsman is an anthology of humorous speculative fiction. The publication will debut in late 2012 and will be available in print and e-book formats. UFO has already locked up many regular Daily SF authors , such as Mike Resnick, Lavie Tidhar, and Ken Liu (to name a very few) – and has opened up their kickstarter campaign, an opportunity to guarantee your own copy of the book and contribute to expand this ambitious project.\n\nÂThe editor and Daily SF author, Alex Shvartsman, has said the project is filling up nicely (a claim this associate editor can verify) but says he still has room for more hilarious material. If you think you have what it takes to be funny, feel free to check out UFO’s guidelines. For an idea what it takes, UFO would like to give you a taste of funny with Jake Kerr’s “The Alien Invasion As Seen In The Twitter Stream Of @DWEEBLESS”.\n\ninterviewed by Carl Slaughter\n\nLois Tilton is the short fiction reviewer for Locus Online. ÂPreviously, she reviewed short fiction for the Internet Review of Science Fiction. ÂShe won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History in the short form category for her story “Pericles the Tyrant” in 2006.Â In 2005, her story, “The Gladiator’s War” was a nominee for the Nebula Award for Best Novelette. ÂShe has also written several novels concerning vampires and media-related novels, one each in the Babylon 5 and Deep Space Nine universes.Â She has published 4 novels:Â Vampire Winter (1990), Darkness on the Ice (1993), Written in Venom (2000), Darkspawn (2000).Â She sold over 70 piece of short fiction between 1985 and 2009, many of which appeared in Asimov’s and Realms of Fantasy.Â Many of her stories have been included in anthologies.\n\nCARL SLAUGHTER:Â What type of relationship does a reviewer have with the science fiction community?Â Do you hobnob with authors and publishers?Â What happens at conventions when fans, authors, editors, and publishers discover you’re the Locus reviewer?Â Do they argue with you, thank you, lobby you on behalf of an upcoming story, avoid you?\n\nLOIS TILTON:Â Essentially, I don’t have a relationship with the science fiction community.Â I don’t believe I’ve been to a convention since I started reviewing.Â For one thing, they don’t invite me.Â And I don’t really see the use in it.Â I don’t particularly enjoy most conventions, where I find myself with nothing much to do except maybe the token panel.Â An author goes to these things to rub the elbow with agents and editors, bask in the presence of the famous, hang out with the posse.Â I’m not there anymore.\n\nAlmost all my previous interaction with the SF community has been online, but online has gone Elsewhere these days and I feel no inclination to chase it around.Â This makes me fairly insulated from the tides of community opinion, which I consider to be an advantage.Â It lets me form my opinion of a story without being influenced by prevailing views.Â I don’t know what stories are currently popular on Facebook or being denounced on Twitter.Â Think of a hermit in a cave with limited internet access.\n\nCS:Â How does your background as a successful writer influence your reviewing?\n\nLT:Â It’s a huge advantage that I’m no longer writing fiction.Â I don’t have to be concerned about the reactions of publishers and editors who might be in a position to reject my stuff.Â In my first column at IROSF, I wrote as my manifesto:Â “I consider that my mandate is to the readers, not the authors or editors of the stories I review. I have no one else to please and no one else’s opinion concerns me, save that of the editors of IROSF.”Â This still holds true, mutatis mutandis, with Locus.Â If it didn’t, I wouldn’t keep doing reviews.Â When I reached the age of curmudgeonhood I decided that the rest of life is too short to let other people tell me what I can and can’t say.\n\nCS:Â Have an author or publisher ever tried to fire or prevent you from reviewing any more of their stories, or wrote you nastigrams, or publicly corrected your review?\n\nLT:Â If any publishers have ever attempted to get me fired, it apparently hasn’t worked so far.Â On a very few occasions, publishers have indeed been peeved by my opinions enough that they stopped sending me stuff for review.Â Sometimes I review it anyway, and it doesn’t work in the case of online zines that anyone can read.\n\nAs far as author reaction goes, I find that it usually falls into two categories:Â “Lois Tilton trashed my story, who the hell does she think she is?” and “Lois Tilton recommended my story, what a great reviewer!”ÂÂ Writers tend to take critical reaction personally.Â I do everything I can to keep it from being personal on my side.Â So if it comes to that, and it has, I’ll write a negative review of a friend’s story and recommend stuff from a person I happen to dislike.\n\nCS:Â Do meet or correspond with other reviewers and what do you talk about?\n\nLT:Â I’ve always liked reading reviews, by which I mean reviews with something to say, not just lists with a few stars next to the titles.Â I like to read other reviewers’ opinions of the stories I’ve read, to see how far we agree and disagree.Â Have I seen many reviews from other sources that totally changed my assessment of a work?Â Not really.Â Sometimes I think, well, that’s a good point.ÂÂ Sometimes, “Duh!Â How could I miss that!”\n\nEven where there is strong disagreement, it’s definitely a Good Thing to have reviewers who come to a work from different points of view, using different scales of critical measurement.Â There’s a lot of subjectivity in these things.Â Even in factual matters, if an author, say, misstates the size of the solar system, different reviewers will assign more or less importance to the error.\n\nEarlier this year, the three regular short fiction reviewers from Locus , Horton, Dozois and Tilton , did a roundtable thing for podcast on reviewing the year’s stories, but there were technical difficulties in the recording.Â Which was too bad, I think readers would have found it interesting.Â One thing on which we all agreed was not having enough time to read many novels.\n\nCS:Â Tell us about the reviewing process.\n\nLT:Â The advantage I have, reviewing online, is the absence of space constraints.Â I don’t have the word limits that reviewers for print venues have to put up with.Â When I started doing this, it was common for reviewers to pick out the most notable stories in a magazine and skip over the rest.Â There wasn’t a lot of negative commentary.Â Because I don’t have the space constraints, I decided I would comment on every story in every publication I review, including the bad ones.Â This definitely means some negative reviews.Â Authors may not like this, but as I’ve said, I’m writing for readers, not authors.\n\nIn choosing publications to review, I first look at what I think most readers will be reading.Â The digests, the regular prozines, both print and online.Â I also like to review the little magazines and less-seen publications of higher quality, to point potential readers in their direction.Â I’ve made it a point to read any new publication sent to me, but that doesn’t guarantee I’ll review it if I find the quality to be sub-professional.Â In essence, I want to review publications that I think readers will want to read.\n\nThere don’t seem to be many high-quality original anthologies anymore, and publishers don’t always send them to me, which is vexing.Â I miss out on some good stuff that way.Â But another policy I adopted when I started this gig is “Text flows to the reviewer.”Â Which means I don’t spend my own money on material for review.Â I’m also not happy about jumping through hoops to access stuff from third-party sites with proprietary formats and encoding.\n\nCS:Â Do you wear kid gloves when you review a story by a new writer?\n\nLT:Â I don’t hold new authors to a different standard.Â If a story is supposed to be good enough to be professionally published, this means it ought to be ready for review as a professional story.Â It does no one a favor if I say, “Well, this one is good enough for a new writer.“Â I think readers want to find good stories, regardless of the author’s age or experience.Â What I will do, particularly in the case of excellent work from a new author, is point out that the writer is new to the game so that readers can look out for more stuff from that author.\n\nCS:Â Any stories you labeled duds that won awards; stories you consider a jewel that received little or no attention; cases of the rest of the speculative fiction community agreeing with you that a story is a dud or a jewel?\n\nLT:Â The trouble with awards is that most of them are made on other grounds than quality.Â There’s the popularity of some authors, there’s outright logrolling, there’s contagious groupthink, whereby people assume that if so many other people like a given work, it must be good.Â And beyond all that is the inescapable fact that most readers, including some of those who vote on awards ballots, don’t read all that widely.Â They may only read stuff by their friends, or stuff recommended by their friends;Â some people will vote for stuff by their friends without bothering to read it.\n\nKnowing this, it’s no surprise when inferior fiction ends up getting awards.Â I very much doubt if a negative review by me has ever changed this.Â I do think that a strong recommendation from me may have helped boost some stories into contention.Â At least, I’d like to think so.\n\nCarl Slaughter is a writer, reviewer, critiquer, muse, English teacher, recruiter, webmaster, editorialist, essayist, and journalist.Â His essay on Chinese culture is in Beijing Review and his essay on Korean culture is in Korea Times.Â His latest essay is on Internet piracy.Â He is also the editor of ESL Book Review.Â He has traveled to 19 countries on 4 continents.Â He has a collection of 1500 DVD movies and TV shows, a collection of Asian and Egyptian art, and an almost unmanageable number of ESL, history, law, business, and science textbooks.Â At the moment he is teaching ESL in China.Â He reviewed extensively for Tangent for 2 years, has participated extensively in the Critters Workshop for 5 years, contributes research frequently on the Writers of the Future Forum, and currently writes reviews and conducts interviews for Diabolical Plots.Â His career plans include contest judge, anthologist, magazine editor, and eventually television producer."
