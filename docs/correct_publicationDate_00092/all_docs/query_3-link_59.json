Signed inscription by Haldeman dated 1976 to SF fan publisher Bill Bowers for \"many good times\" on the title page. \"Tough, slick narrative of an interstellar war which lasts [over] 1000 years. To the soldier hero, it seems to last about ten years, thanks to the time-dilation effect of faster-than-light travel. Good, realistic, military SF which actually subverts many of the clich√©s of that category ... (he was a Vietnam veteran, which helped). Initially rejected by 18 publishers, it has since sold over a million copies.\" - Pringle, The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction, second edition (1995), pp. 141-2. Haldeman's first SF novel. Winner of the 1975 Hugo award for best novel. Anatomy of Wonder (2004) II-479. Sargent, British and American Utopian Literature, 1516-1985, p. 360. Survey of Science Fiction Literature II, pp. 813-8. A fine copy in very good dust jacket (priced $7.95) with rubbing at spine ends and corner tips and several faint scratches to rear panel. A nice copy overall and a pleasant association. (#146487).\n\nPrice: $1,250.00"
