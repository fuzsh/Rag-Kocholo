        "text": "Dust jacket by Lee Moyer.\n\nJoe Haldeman has been one of the world’s most universally admired and beloved science fiction writers for more than four decades. He has earned the respect of both lifelong science fiction fans and mainstream literary writers, both for the originality of his concepts and for the unsurpassed clarity of his prose, and his characters are among the most memorable in all of science fiction.\n\nThis first career retrospective of Haldeman’s finest work ranges from early tales such as “Hero”—which instantly earned his reputation and provided the basis for his classic novel The Forever War—to mid-career masterpieces like “Seasons” and “The Hemingway Hoax,” his major tribute to a favorite literary godfather, to very recent stories such as “Sleeping Dogs” and “Complete Sentence.” Haldeman has provided original story introductions for this new landmark collection.\n\nWhat emerges from The Best of Joe Haldeman is a stunning portrait of a writer who may be more complex and varied than even his most devoted fans suspect. He can build a touching far-future romance from a Shakespeare sonnet (“For White Hill”), depict with ruthless intensity the horrors of war (“Graves”), and ask classic science fictional “what if” questions worthy of Robert A. Heinlein, to whom Haldeman has often been compared as a worthy successor.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nHero\n\nAnniversary Project\n\nTricentennial\n\nBlood Sisters\n\nLindsay and the Red City Blues\n\nManifest Destiny\n\nMore Than the Sum of His Parts\n\nSeasons\n\nThe Monster\n\nThe Hemingway Hoax\n\nGraves\n\nNone So Blind\n\nFor White Hill\n\nCivil Disobedience\n\nFour Short Novels\n\nAngel of Light\n\nThe Mars Girl\n\nSleeping Dogs\n\nComplete Sentence\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly:\n\n“Demonstrating that the hard-to-market novella is perfect for science fiction, this collection of 19 stories by SFWA Grand Master Haldeman (Earthbound) features several tales that bring out his ability to wrap hard science speculation with deep human feeling…”\n\nFrom Library Journal:\n\n“From the tense, military action of ‘Hero’, the basis for Haldeman’s award-winning classic The Forever War, to the horrific short story detailing the prison of the future, ‘Complete Sentence’, the 19 pieces collected here bear witness to the brilliant and hard-hitting prose of one of today’s most significant sf voices.”\n\nFrom Locus:\n\n“Another (relatively) Old Master, from the generation just after Le Guin, is Joe Haldeman, who has a big retrospective collection out in early 2013. The best story here may be the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning novella ‘The Hemingway Hoax’, but there’s plenty of other first-class work here, including ‘Hero’, the seed that grew into his famous novel, The Forever War, ‘For White Hill’, ‘None So Blind’, ‘The Mars Girl’, ‘Sleeping Dogs’, ‘Anniversary Project’, ‘Tricentennial’, and ‘More Than the Sum of His Part’”, as well as stuff a bit removed from his usual science fiction, such as ‘Manifest Destiny’, a Western, and ‘Lindsay and the Red City Blues’, a supernatural horror story.”"
