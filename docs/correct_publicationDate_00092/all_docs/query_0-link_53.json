        "text": "REVIEW\n\nThe Forever War | Joe Haldeman\n\nMilitary Science Fiction/ Winner of the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award\n\nBy\n\nadmin\n\n-\n\n368\n\nISBN: 9780312536633 | BUY HERE\n\nThis is the best SF war novel and best SF title I’ve ever read, period (next to Old Man’s War.) You follow Private William Mandella, a reluctant conscript draftee into an elite military unit. As childish as the plot may sound, this book is far from it. Take Full Metal Jacket and mix it with Sci-Fi and BAM you have this titan in the genre. Even with that said, no matter how much praise this book is given it’ll never be enough."
