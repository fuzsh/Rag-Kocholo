        "text": "There are still multiple reasons why we think science fiction should be a key component of an effective, broad reading program for military officers and national security professionals. And it has become clear that this is not just some speculative notion harbored by the authors and those who responded through social media.\n\nIn the past, science fiction fostered thinking about future conflict and international competition. Before World War One, hundreds of books were written about the future of war. These include classics such as The Battle of Dorking (1871), War of the Worlds (1898), and The Great War Syndicate (1889).\n\nDuring the Cold War, it was also popular to tell stories about future conflict. Aliens in movies such as The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and books like The Forever War (1974) were stand-ins for the Communist threat or the broader impacts of war on societies. In the same era, dystopian fiction was also popular, and a large number of books were written in this time, including well-known titles like On The Beach (1957) or The Day After (1983).\n\nFinally, recent scholarship by eminent historians and strategic thinkers like Lawrence Freedman and Antulio Echevarria shows us how military theorists and planners in the past were shaped by the ideas of their own day, which impacted decisions as they prepared for future warfare. Reading and considering contemporary science fiction can provide military leaders and national security professionals the “raw material that the millworks of imagination break up, grind down, and combine anew.”\n\nScience fiction has been a mainstay of more recent military senior leader reading lists, with books such as Ender’s Game, Ghost Fleet, and Starship Troopers maintaining popularity among military and national security professionals. The U.S. Marine Corps’ Destination Unknown series and the U.S. Army’s Future Warfare Writing Program have used science fiction, graphic novels, and short stories to solicit ideas about future conflict and competition. So, the use of science fiction for military education and professional development continues to be accepted. Why is this so?\n\nReading science fiction nurtures hope that there is a better future. While conflict, catastrophe, and climate change feature in many of these novels and movies, much science fiction is highly optimistic in nature. Uplifting stories of positive futures—or of hope and agency in the face of dystopian futures—fill national security professionals with optimism that we can drive our services to make positive possibilities happen.\n\nReading science fiction also allows us to consider a variety of negative potential futures. The dystopian future genre has been popular lately, but this is not new. Science fiction has always dealt with futures where society breaks down or must deal with a far more pessimistic view of the possible. It is beneficial for military officers to read such descriptions of alternate futures; it is the first step in ensuring that they do not come to pass.\n\nScience fiction permits individuals and organizations to nurture innovative thinking without running afoul of organizational cultures. Because it is fiction it does not interfere with current policies, providing a safe place for ideas that do not threaten current institutional rice bowls—but they might and should in the future. In cultivating this innovative thinking as national security professionals, we might demonstrate that creativity remains an important aspect of military thinking and leadership.\n\nScience fiction allows us to think about new and old technologies in fresh ways. Whether it is an alternate reality or the distant future, science fiction can inspire divergent thinking about advanced technologies and how to apply them in concert with new ideas and new organizations. It also permits the thinking through of ethical issues related to using new technologies in a way that is accessible to more of our people. As our national security requires leaders to invest more in thinking about military ethics and moral injury, this is vital.\n\nFinally, science fiction reminds us of the enduring nature of war. Some of the finest science fiction novels explore this. These stories remind us that the clash of wills, the fear, interests, and honor integral to human warfare, are enduring. Notwithstanding the technological marvels of science fiction novels, war ultimately remains a human endeavor.\n\nThis edition contains some holdovers from our previous list, but new additions as well. We are thankful for feedback from readers that has brought many fantastic new books from the last couple of years to our attention. We seek to capture those that had the most valuable insights for those in the profession of arms or military strategy. As we wrote previously, our hope is that readers of this list continue to engage with us to fill any other holes in our knowledge!\n\nWe have retained the five sections of our 2018 article: a place to begin, military-focused, social-focused, mind-expanding, and online resources to keep abreast of new material. And we have added one additional category—historical fiction. These are the books that predate the massive explosion in science fiction in the wake of the Second World War. We hope that in including these, readers can gain an appreciation of how previous generations of military leaders and thinkers have sought to use fiction and science fiction as a foundation for imagining different military and national security futures.\n\nReading widely in a professional capacity increases a person’s capacity for generating imaginative options to solve complex problems. Reading science fiction provides this variety. We hope this list provides additional variety in personal and professional reading programs, and guides readers through their journey to discover the insights that science fiction offers national security professionals."
