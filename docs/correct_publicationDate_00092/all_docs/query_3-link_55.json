        "text": "This year contained many ups and many downs, so it’s hard to say how I really feel about 2018. One thing I am positive about though is that this year was full of fantastic reads. Twenty-six books fell into my hands these past 365 days, and it’s time I share with my loyal readers the definitive ranking of every book I read this year. Now let’s get down to business!\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhat:The Forever War\n\nWho: Joe Haldeman\n\nPages: 365, soft cover\n\nGenres: Science fiction; classic literature\n\nPublished: 1974\n\nThe lit: of 5 flames\n\nI’ve always said sci-fi wasn’t really my “thing.” I don’t gravitate toward it at the library.

Intense technological enhancements? Human-erasing bugs? That’s him. I’ve read exactly one sci-fi novel in our time together (Station Eleven, ). So it was only natural that when I closed the cover on Eleanor Oliphant a few weeks ago while sitting next to BF that he suggested I read one of his favorite sci-fi novels: The Forever War. I relented, but he reminded me how I always say I’m going to read one of his books and don’t (truth) and convinced me that the story’s undertones of the Vietnam War, in which the author served, would captivate me.\n\nUgh he knows me so well.\n\nFine. For BF, I will read sci-fi. The things you do for love.\n\nContinue reading →"
