        "text": "There's something about Florida that seems to attract writers.\n\nThink Hemingway, for example.\n\nWhatever the reason, the Sunshine State is home to an array of science fiction writers, humor writers and poets.\n\nThe inaugural Florida Voices Book Fair, an event dedicated to these Florida writers, will be held today at the Santa Fe Community College Downtown Blount Center from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\n\"A book fair is the ideal venue for authors to meet their reading audience and for readers to be introduced to new authors,\" said Norma Homan, executive director of the Gainesville Association for the Creative arts and the fair's lead organizer.\n\nFor those who have never been to a book fair before - don't worry. Some of the authors have never been to one, either.\n\n\"I've given talks at universities . . . signed books at book stores. I've just never been to a book fair,\" said UF alum Robert Mason, author of the New York Times bestseller \"Chickenhawk,\" a personal account of the helicopter war in Vietnam.\n\nHe and his wife, Patience Mason, who is also an author, live on the Santa Fe River and will be participating in the book fair.\n\nRobert Mason will have the new edition of \"Chickenhawk\" available at the fair, which now includes a section of photographs never published before.\n\n\"It has a picture of me that he had over there,\" Patience said. \"And [our son] Little Jacky . . . now Big Jack.\"\n\nAlong with the Masons and authors including humor writer Shelley Fraser Mickle and poet Peter Meinke, will be science-fiction writer Joe Haldeman.\n\n\"It's fun to meet your readers and some of the other writers,\" he said.\n\nHaldeman, who attends book fairs occasionally, can recall a particular fair in Los Angeles that sticks out in his mind.\n\nHe met a reader who had a copy of his first science-fiction novel in a bound galley, which is the stage before a book is printed.\n\n\"I offered him $1,000,\" said Haldeman, who doesn't have a copy - there are only five or six in existence. \"He just laughed.\"\n\nHe has only signed two bound galleys in his life, Haldeman said.\n\nAlthough bound galleys are not common at book signings, fans seeking advice from authors are.\n\nRobert Mason said he is usually asked about Vietnam or complimented on his writing.\n\n\"They think they can actually go fly a helicopter after reading the book,\" he said.\n\nHaldeman, on the other hand, is often answering questions about how to write.\n\nMany people ask him what kind of rituals he has or whether on not he has a lucky charm.\n\nNeither rituals nor lucky charms aid in Haldeman's writing, he says.\n\n\"People's ideas of what it means to be a writer gets in the way of the process,\" he said. \"It should come naturally.\"\n\nAnd he should know. Haldeman teaches a writing course at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., every fall semester.\n\nThe rest of his time is spent in Gainesville, where he does most of his writing outside on his porch.\n\n\"It's a wonderful town,\" he said. \"I really like Gainesville. Great library, museums - it's civilized. A lot of Florida is not civilized.\"\n\nWhat: Florida authors Joe Haldeman, Shelley Fraser Mickle, Robert Mason, poet Peter Meinke and others will meet fans and discuss their work.\n\nWhen: 10 a.m.-4 p.m. today\n\nSanta Fe Community College's downtown Blount Center, 401 NW 6th St.\n\nCost: Free\n\nFor information: Call (888) 917-7001\n\nFlorida Voices is today"
