Eos 04:20

Waiting for light perceived to free us from life's frail deceit; grace born of untold lies shrouded in indistinct shadow As reason came to being, our sky was shaped by soul, the earth by mind; our faith undying was conceived through perception Quest for our answer - converging form; apotheosis become our reflection Subsiding darkness confining untold life, absolving all this dissolving illusion Yet minds divided, corrupted by disease of doubt with our means to understand the form of our existence dying out Blind god behind our eyes, a mute representation, deciding light Hells conform to one's will as grace alone exists inside a mind Solo - Eetu Solo - Szymon Eos Solo - Eetu Solo - Nick Padovani Solo - Eetu Solo - Nick ...and when there was no presence of worship shrouding ground, our deity forged us from the earth and soul With god and his will desecrating us with hearts we could not bear we begin our life of desire and despair

Mother Cosmos 04:20

We sail the astral tides, glide through the gloom of cosmic light bound by cerebral shores that carve the edge of earthen fluorescent might Time's waves of gleaming light churn wrath as the pious scorn turns the stellar tide The spectral cries that sing in a choir of insolent minds unfolding cast our will aside Our inclination to obey our sin breeds putrefaction as defection hones the thorns that pierce within As a soul is mortal, one must abide - rot underneath a sky that opens wide Time is dissolving in balmy streams - vanquished decay firmly unwinding in the hearts above and below in death to lie Turmoil resolving - chaos that currents washed away Harmonious calling - paradise conceived into soul condemned to die As time corrodes the mind, hope remains concealed unseen behind the face of true divine - material dependency, the glorified sufficed design Until our planet dies, universe giveth home to eternal life Calling of starlight night - the ocean of creation's might Solo - Eetu Solo - Darius Wave We sail the astral tides, glide through the gloom of cosmic light bound by cerebral shores that carve the edge of earthen fluorescent might Time's waves of gleaming light churn wrath as the pious scorn turns the stellar tide The spectral cries that sing in a choir of insolent minds unfolding cast our will aside Our inclination to obey your sin bred putrefaction, now perception breathes eternal peace within As we're immortal, we stand aside - reign underneath our sky that opens wide our reality

Flesh Over Finite 04:20

Dreaded reign of the earthen king, the archaic lie untold is formed Where messian light's existence hides, now desire's bleak deceit lies drenched in blood Under a blackened sky the smallest spark could light up the fire adorned burning throughout sinner's heart, a flame that couldn't permeate the void of god The sons of brightest star rejoice beneath the unhallowed decay of time, their mortal, rotten blood become that of heavens' sweetest, exquisite wine Anoint divine, perished race in the sea of the light once dimmed by their azure might The master overthrown, the creation burnt in tides of Belial's light Drink from the godhoodâ€™s crimson grail, rot as imperfections prevail Solo - Caleb Solo - Juan Ayestas Solo - Garrett Peters Solo - Denis Shvarts Solo - Eetu Carnal sin erodes within as the passion takes control of soul Where devotion lies, now death resides, the ambition that intent could not enthrall Unseen, the lies pervade as decades turn a fruitful desire foul Cursing defiled, hollow soul, the mind of man conforms into the craving's call
