        "text": "→ The selection committee for the second call for the guest room refurbishment project has selected two winning teams.\n\nAs part of the third chapter of the Re-enchanting Villa Medici project, the French Academy in Rome has issued a second call for projects for the refurbishment of the guest rooms at Villa Medici in March 2023.\n\nThe two winning projects were announced by Sam Stourdzé at the Edit Napoli fair on October 6, 2023:\n\nIL CIELO IN UNA STANZA by Giorgia Zanellato and Daniele Bortotto (Studio Zanellato/Bortotto) with Patrizia Mian (Incalmi).\n\nPARS PRO TOTO by Eliane Le Roux, Miza Mucciarelli (Atelier Misto), Terre di Sciara (represented by Giannella Sanna), and Pietro Spoto.\n\nThose projects will be set up between 2024 and 2025 in the guest rooms of the historic Villa Medici edifice. They join the two winning projects from the previous call:\n\nCAMERA FANTASIA by Gaëlle Gabillet and Stéphane Villard (Studio GGSV), Riccardo Cavaciocchi (Paper Factor), and Matthieu Lemarié.\n\nSTUDIOLO by Sébastien Kieffer and Léa Padovani (Pool), Romain Boulais, and Félix Lévêque (Atelier Veneer).\n\nThis project is being carried out in partnership with the Mobilier national, a leading centre for the creation and preservation of heritage since Louis XIV, and with the Fondation Bettencourt Schueller, a patron of the arts and crafts for over 20 years. Also supported by the Fondation Banque Populaire, Maison Tréca Paris and Edit Napoli, this project provides a unique space for contemporary design at Villa Medici.\n\nThe Academy also launcheda new call for the refurbishment of guest rooms in the historic Villa Medici edifice. The competition is open from 6 October to 6 December 2023.\n\nStudio Zanellato/Bortotto & Incalmi : Il Cielo in una stanza\n\nGiorgia Zanellato and Daniele Bortotto (Studio Zanellato/Bortotto)\n\nPatrizia Mian and Gianluca Zanella (Incalmi)\n\nInspiredby a walk through the streets of Rome, the project draws on the city’s distinctive elements. The green of Rome’s pine trees contrasts with blue walls which extend the sky into the room. The wall runs vertically along the staircase and is covered in fire-enamelled copper tesserae. The material reflects the light streaming in through the large window. The walk continues among the Roman bricks, which, with their geometric interplay and sunshade walls, inspired a module of white fireclay bricks.\n\nEliane Le Roux, Miza Mucciarelli (Atelier Misto), Terre di Sciara (Gianella Sanna) & Pietro Spoto : Pars pro toto\n\nEliane Le Roux, Miza Mucciarelli (Atelier Misto)\n\nTerre di Sciara (represented by Giannella Sanna), and Pietro Spoto\n\nDrawing inspiration from the techniques of Balthus, painter and director of Villa Medici from 1961 and 1977, the team plans to work the room like a micro-architecture, using systems of vaults and arches. The spaces follow one another with new volumetrics, creating a fluid and harmonious dynamic. The team’s craftspeople will then apply unique patinas, specially designed for the room, using traditional methods. These patinas, subtly varying in texture, create a unique atmosphere, evocative of the art and tranquillity that characterise this place.\n\nThe competition jury\n\nThe competition jury is made up of Alberto Cavalli, executive director of the Michelangelo Foundation for Creativity and Craftsmanship and general curator of Homo Faber Event, Domitilla Dardi, design historian and founder of EDIT Napoli, Hedwige Gronier, director of cultural sponsorship at the Bettencourt Schueller Foundation, Hervé Lemoine, chairman of the Mobilier national, Christine Macel, director of the Musée des Arts décoratifs, India Mahdavi, architect, designer and scenographer, Isabelle de Ponfilly, chair of the Board of Governors of the École nationale supérieure des Arts décoratifs. The jury is chaired by Sam Stourdzé, director of the French Academy in Rome -Villa Medici.\n\nPartner of the Re-enchanting Villa Medici project:"
