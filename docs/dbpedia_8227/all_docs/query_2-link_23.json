        "text": "France have made two changes to the side that defeated New Zealand last November as they prepare to open their 2022 Six Nations campaign against Italy in Paris on Sunday without coach Fabien Galthie.\n\nLoose forward Dylan Cretin and hooker Julien Marchand have been brought into the starting XV, while there is also a 5-3 split between forwards and backs on the bench as opposed to 6-2 in their famous 40-25 win over the All Blacks.\n\nGalthie will lead the side remotely this weekend having tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday morning. The rest of the squad were given the all-clear.\n\nHe will be able to join the squad again on Tuesday if he returns a negative test, but his assistant Raphael Ibanez will be in the coach's box for the Italy clash.\n\n\"This morning, I tested positive COVID-19. I am doing well and I have light symptoms,\" Galthie said in a Twitter post on Friday.\n\n\"As a result, I am going to self-isolate and will be working remotely this week. Raphael Ibanez and the rest of my staff, in whom I have full confidence, will be acting as my go-betweens on the pitch.\"\n\nLock Cameron Woki has been declared fit to partner Paul Willemse in the second row, while in front of them in the scrum will be Marchand, and props Uini Atonio and Cyril Baille.\n\nThe back three are made up of No. 8 Gregory Alldritt, and loose-forwards Cretin and Anthony Jelonch.\n\nCaptain and recently crowned World Rugby Player of the Year Antoine Dupont is at scrumhalf to partner flyhalf Romain Ntamack. Jonathan Danty and Gael Fickou make up the midfield pairing.\n\nDamian Penaud and Gabin Villiere are on the wing, with Melvyn Jaminet at fullback.\n\nFrance have won the last 11 meetings between the sides dating back to 2014, and claimed a 50-10 victory when the teams clashed in Rome in the Six Nations last year.\n\nItaly head coach Kieran Crowley has named debutants Tommaso Menoncello and Toa Halafihi in a youthful Azzurri side\n\nBenetton wing Menoncello, 19, makes the step up from Italy's under-20 side, while his 28-year-old club mate, New Zealand-born No. 8 Halafihi, recently qualified for selection under residency rules.\n\nMontpellier's 21-year-old playmaker Paolo Garbisi starts at fly-half with Gloucester man Stephen Varney, 20, inside him at scrum-half, while captain Michele Lamaro, 23, is at openside.\n\nTighthead prop Tiziano Pasquali starts in what will be his first international appearance since the 2019 Rugby World Cup, making up the front-row with loose-head Danilo Fischetti and hooker Gianmarco Lucchesi.\n\nThere are two more debutants, flanker Manuel Zuliani and fly-half Leonardo Marin, in a 6-2 split of forwards to backs on the bench.\n\n\"The work we have done in recent weeks in preparation for the Six Nations was intense and high quality,\" Crowley said.\n\n\"There is a lot of energy in the group and an awareness that they are taking to the pitch in one of the most important tournaments in the world of rugby and sport. The focus is on our performance: it will be important to stay calm in the key moments.\"\n\nFrance XV:\n\nMelvyn Jaminet, Damian Penaud, Jonathan Danty, Gael Fickou, Gabin Villiere, Romain Ntamack, Antoine Dupont (capt.), Gregory Alldritt, Dylan Cretin, Anthony Jelonch, Paul Willemse, Cameron Woki, Uini Atonio, Julien Marchand, Cyril Baille.\n\nReplacements: Peato Mauvaka, Jean-Baptiste Gros, Demba Bamba, Romain Taofifenua, Francois Cros, Maxime Lucu, Yoram Moefana, Thomas Ramos.\n\nItaly XV:\n\nEdoardo Padovani, Tommaso Menoncello, Juan Ignacio Brex, Marco Zanon, Montanna Ioane, Paolo Garbisi, Stephen Varney, Toa Halafihi, Michele Lamaro, Sebastian Negri, Federico Ruzza, Niccolo Cannone, Tiziano Pasquali, Gianmarco Lucchesi, Danilo Fischetti.\n\nReplacements: Epalahame Faiva, Ivan Nemer, Giosue Zilocchi, Marco Fuser, Giovanni Pettinelli, Manuel Zuliani, Callum Braley, Leonardo Marin."
