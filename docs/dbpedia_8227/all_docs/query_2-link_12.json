        "text": "Introduction\n\nDespite intensive multi-modality treatment, children with brain tumors have a variable prognosis, depending on tumor type, quality of resection, limitations to apply radiotherapy and resistance to chemotherapy. Most patients with relapsed brain tumors have a dismal prognosis. Patients with low grade glioma (LGG) may respond or stabilize to several lines of chemotherapy and vinblastine has proven its efficacy (Bouffet et al., 2012; Lassaletta et al., 2016). However, notwithstanding the “benign” histology of LGG some refractory patients have a poor functional and/or vital long term prognosis (Colin et al., 2013).\n\nAngiogenesis is defined by the development of neovascularization in and around solid tumors supplying nutrients and oxygen to growing tumors. Angiogenesis plays a key role in both tumor growth and the potential metastatic development (Bergers and Benjamin, 2003; Ferrara and Kerbel, 2005; Kerbel, 2008). Anti-angiogenic treatments are now established strategies to treat cancer (Colleoni et al., 2002; Kerbel and Kamen, 2004; Kieran et al., 2005; Sterba et al., 2006; Pasquier et al., 2007, 2010; André et al., 2008; André and Pasquier, 2009). Metronomic chemotherapy (MC) is defined as the frequent administration of chemotherapy at doses below the maximal tolerated dose and without prolonged drug-free intervals (André and Pasquier, 2009; Pasquier et al., 2010; André et al., 2013). Metronomic therapy has a distinct mode of action as compared to maximum tolerated dose (MTD) chemotherapy as used in standard regimens, since it may act through various mechanisms: by assuring continuous exposure during cell cycle, thereby preventing tumor cell regrowth (Kerbel and Kamen, 2004; André and Pasquier, 2009; Pasquier et al., 2010); by causing anti-angiogenic effects through affecting the tumor endothelial cells and by targeting circulating endothelial progenitor cells (CEP) (Ferrara and Kerbel, 2005; Pasquier et al., 2007; Kerbel, 2008; André and Pasquier, 2009), thereby contributing to tumor dormancy; by increasing in situ drug delivery to the tumor cells by decreasing the interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) of the tumor environment (Pasquier et al., 2010); by restoring the anticancer activity of the immune system by decreasing regulatory T-cells (T-regs), or inducing dendritic cell maturation (André and Pasquier, 2009; Pasquier et al., 2010) and by direct impact on cancer cells or cancer stem cells (André et al., 2013, André et al., 2017).\n\nAs a consequence MC is now regarded as a form of intrinsic multi-targeted chemotherapy.\n\nMetronomic chemotherapy has also been reported to induce less severe adverse events (AEs) usually associated with chemotherapy (Choi et al., 2008; Barber et al., 2013). MC is frequently combined with drug repositioning or repurposing (DR) which consists in reusing old drugs for new indications (André et al., 2013). The combination of MC and DR has been defined as metronomics (André et al., 2013).\n\nMetronomic chemotherapy has shown its efficacy in adult tumor types such as breast and ovarian cancer (Colleoni et al., 2002; Barber et al., 2013). The combination of anti-angiogenic compounds such as bevacizumab with low-dose (LD) cyclophosphamide has shown response rates as high as 42% in refractory ovarian cancer (Barber et al., 2013).\n\nMetronomic therapy has to some extent been studied in pediatrics with a majority of retrospective series and phase I or phase II trials, although randomized trials have also been reported recently (Pramanik et al., 2017; Senerchia et al., 2017). Combinations of thalidomide/celecoxib with alternating LD etoposide/cyclophosphamide (Kieran et al., 2005) showed prolonged disease stabilizations in especially CNS-tumors. Similarly a combination of celecoxib with alternating LD etoposide/LD-cyclophosphamide given as a maintenance lead to sustained disease stabilization in different tumor types (Choi et al., 2008). Continuous celecoxib and on/off isotretinoin with alternating LD etoposide and LD temozolomide (Sterba et al., 2006) may be beneficial in intra- and extra-cranial tumors. Vinca-alcaloids like vinblastine may have anti-angiogenic effects (Pasquier et al., 2007; Senerchia et al., 2017). Vinblastine has shown its anti-tumor efficacy for the treatment of LGG (Bouffet et al., 2012; Lassaletta et al., 2016) and was integrated in metronomic regimens (Heng et al., 2016), where the pharmacokinetics of combinations of vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, and celecoxib were previously studied. However, little is known on the anti-tumor efficacy of this combination.\n\nWe previously reported our pilot study with a four-drug metronomic regimen in relapsed/refractory pediatric malignancies (André et al., 2011). This pilot led us to a slightly modified treatment scheme with an 8 week cycle using celecoxib, vinblastine, alternating oral cyclophosphamide, and oral methotrexate. This MC scheme was used for a phase II clinical trial in CNS- and non-CNS tumors. We report here the results for the CNS tumors. The results of the other non-CNS tumors will be reported separately.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe report here the results for the two groups of children with relapsing or refractory brain tumors included in a multicentre phase II clinical trial using a four-drug metronomic regimen.\n\nWe developed this new multidrug metronomic regimen for children with brain tumors and extra-cerebral tumors, integrating the different mechanisms of action of MC. Indeed, although MC was initially considered to be an anti-angiogenic therapy (Bergers and Benjamin, 2003; Kerbel and Kamen, 2004; Ferrara and Kerbel, 2005; Kerbel, 2008), recent findings have highlighted new effects, which all likely contribute to treatment efficacy (Pasquier et al., 2007, 2010; André and Pasquier, 2009; André et al., 2013, 2017). These effects include the potential direct effects against cancer cells (André et al., 2017), the stimulation of the anticancer properties of the immune system and re-induction of tumor dormancy (Pasquier et al., 2007, 2010; André and Pasquier, 2009; André et al., 2013, 2017).\n\nWe designed a metronomic regimen relying mainly on oral medications and used a continuous LD methotrexate and cyclophosphamide backbone published in Colleoni et al. (2002). Besides, since MC may be given for a long period of time resulting in high accumulated doses of drugs received we wanted to avoid etoposide and temozolomide that have been previously reported to potentially induce secondary leukemia (Le Deley et al., 2005; Dufour et al., 2008; André et al., 2011). Both drugs are used in the most efficient pediatric metronomic regimen published so far (Kieran et al., 2005; Stempak et al., 2006; Sterba et al., 2006; Choi et al., 2008; Göbel et al., 2014; Robison et al., 2014; Ali and El-Sayed, 2016; Berthold et al., 2017). Vinblastine was also part of this regimen since this drug has limited hematological toxicity and anti-tubulin agents are known to have potent anti-angiogenic properties (Pasquier et al., 2007; Heng et al., 2016). Moreover, vinblastine can activate dendritic cells (André and Pasquier, 2009) and hence can be included in metronomic protocols (Pasquier et al., 2010). Celecoxib has been part of most pediatric metronomic regimen (Kieran et al., 2005; Sterba et al., 2006; Pasquier et al., 2007; Choi et al., 2008; Berthold et al., 2017) as it adds potential anti-angiogenic effects and tumor sensitization to chemotherapy (Stempak et al., 2006) and also display immune-modulating properties (Göbel et al., 2014).\n\nThe anti-tumor efficacy of this regimen seems predominant in LGG where two PRs were observed and 6 SDs among 10 evaluable patients, of which 7 patients continued treatment beyond 1 year and 2 patients had 2 years of treatment with ongoing stabilization. It should be emphasized that 9 out of evaluable 10 patients had previously been treated with vinblastine, which in most patients did not prevent a relapse or refractory disease at that time since the median duration of previous vinblastine treatment was only 4.4 months. Although we cannot rule out that the tumor stabilization was caused by a re-challenge by vinblastine, it seems likely that the addition of the other three compounds had an additive or synergistic effect. It should be emphasized that the patients with LGG in our series tolerated well the MC with >90% of dose intensity of vinblastine received during the first year of treatment but the dose of vinblastine is twice lower than the one used by Bouffet et al. (2012). Stempak et al. (2006) reported protracted stable disease in a patient with low grade astrocytoma using vinblastine and celecoxib.\n\nWhen comparing the observed PFS of 70% at 2 years to other vinblastine-containing regimens for LGG, it can be noted that this PFS is similar or even slightly better as compared to the phase II with vinblastine monotherapy (Bouffet et al., 2012; Lassaletta et al., 2016) where 2-year PFS was ±60%. It should be emphasized that in this cohort of 51 patients there were 23% of NF1 patients that responded better to vinblastine as compared to non-NF1 patients (5-year PFS of 42%) (Lassaletta et al., 2016). In our series only one patient had NF1. Moreover, vinblastine was used as first line in the series as reported by Lassaletta et al. (2016), whereas our patients with LGG in majority had had ≥3 lines of chemotherapy. It should be stressed that in the Bouffet series 1 CR and 9 PRs were observed in 51 patients, which is a comparable response rate as in our series (2/10 patients with a PR). We previously reported a case-series of 4 patients with optic-pathway glioma that received vinblastine maintenance therapy after an induction with irinotecan and bevacizumab (IB). One patient responded to vinblastine after being stable after IB, while the other 3 patients remained stable, all of them having had 12 months of vinblastine therapy with a median follow-up of now more than 30 months (Heng et al., 2016). Our results in LGG are comparable in terms of PFS to the series of 12 LGG patients as described by Robison et al. (2014) using a MC regimen with continuous celecoxib, fenofibrate, thalidomide and alternating oral etoposide with cyclophosphamide. They observed 4 PR, 5 SD, and 3 PD with however only 7 patients reaching the 27 weeks of MC where in our series 7/10 had at least 1 year of MC. Elsewhere, Zapletalova et al. (2012) observed disease stabilization in 9/10 low grade tumors, among which LGG, using the COMBAT II regimen containing celecoxib, fenofibrate, vitamin D with alternating etoposide and temozolomide. No PFS was mentioned specifically for the patients with LGG.\n\nThe concept of MC was previously explored by several teams in non-brain and brain tumors. Two randomized studies were published that were performed in cohorts of pediatric patients with relapsed extra-cranial solid tumors. Pramanik et al. (2017) compared the effect of MC on PFS in pediatric patients progressing after at least two lines of chemotherapy. The MC regimen consisted of daily celecoxib and thalidomide with alternating periods of etoposide and cyclophosphamide, whereas the other arm received placebo. They showed no benefit on PFS for the entire group although subgroups of patients with none-bone sarcoma seemed to have some benefit (Pramanik et al., 2017). Senerchia et al. (2017) showed no benefit of 72 weeks of MC containing oral daily cyclophosphamide and twice weekly oral methotrexate after a conventional backbone of chemotherapy for localized osteosarcoma.\n\nSeveral phase II trials with MC have been published in pediatrics (Kieran et al., 2005; Stempak et al., 2006; Sterba et al., 2006; Pasquier et al., 2007; Choi et al., 2008; Senerchia et al., 2017). Choi et al. (2008) used a MC regimen based on alternating oral etoposide, temozolomide, and cyclophosphamide in combination with either retinoic acid or celecoxib. The patient population consisted of high risk patients with several malignant histologies and predominantly residual disease at time of inclusion. One PR and four prolonged SDs were observed while 3 patients remained in remission after having no residual disease. The responding or stabilized patients had 6–12 months of MC (Choi et al., 2008). The responding patient had an oligodendroglioma. In our series one patient with anaplastic oligodendroglioma had SD for 2 years and still is progression-free. We acknowledge the fact that these are only two cases but may merit additional explorations given the limited therapeutic options for these patients at relapse. Kieran et al. (2005) explored a similar regimen with interesting responses in neuroblastoma, LGG, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and medulloblastoma.\n\nIn our phase II clinical trial, no significant activity was observed in other brain tumor histologies but LGG. Nearly all patients with HGG (one excluded), ependymoma, medulloblastoma, or other BT were not stabilized by our regimen. This is in contrast with the series reported by Kieran et al. (2005) where prolonged remissions/stabilizations were observed in ependymoma (n = 4/5), medulloblastoma (n = 1/1) and optic pathway glioma (n = 1/1), after using a metronomic regimen with thalidomide, celecoxib and alternating etoposide and cyclophosphamide (Kieran et al., 2005). In the 19 patients with ependymoma reported by Robison et al. (2014), 2 PR, 10 SD, and 7 PD were observed with 37% having at least 27 weeks of MC. These observations were one of the rationale to explore a separate group of ependymoma in our phase II trial. The MC regimen consisted of alternating oral etoposide and cyclophosphamide with continuous thalidomide and celecoxib. We can consider that the lack of etoposide and/or temozolomide in our MC regimen led to an inadequate efficacy in our groups of BT (LGG excluded).\n\nWe want to emphasize that even if MC is considered to induce lower toxicity, that our series showed acceptable though notable AEs with a majority of grade 2 or 3 events and few grade 4 events. We had more grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity as compared to the series published by Ali and El-Sayed (2016) who used a similar MC scheme in combination with focal RT. A high clinical benefit rate of 76% was observed with only grade I hematological toxicity observed. It should be emphasized that pathologies and previous treatments were not comparable to our series."
