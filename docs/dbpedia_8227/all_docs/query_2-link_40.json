        "text": "France v Scotland\n\nThis was a game where, based on the two previous rounds, Scotland would have been expected to play an attacking game, and France would have been expected to lose again. However, Scotland have not won at the Stade de France in twenty years, and that statistic showed as this game played out.\n\nFrance started the game very well, with pressure constantly being applied to the Scottish defensive line, and unfortunately for Scotland, first choice full-back Stuart Hogg was among the many injuries for Scotland. Blair Kinghorn started in his place, having replaced him two weeks ago as a substitute. For me, having watched him yesterday, I would have to say I prefer him as a winger going forward than as a full-back marshalling the defence. France obviously saw this weakness and they played to it. Only individual errors denied them a couple of tries in the first half, either side of a try which was legal and was brilliantly worked. Firstly, the excellent Damian Penaud was involved in the creative side of it on the wing, exchanging passes to get around the Scottish defenders, but the reason that this try succeeded was because France ran forward at the same time across the entire pitch. What this meant is that Scotland couldn't just pour all their men into the one area where the ball was, because they had to watch other players as well. One of those was fly-half Romain Ntamack, whose run took him to just underneath the posts. Scotland's uncertainty about where to defend most was all France needed, and they were unable to prevent the try. This was something we haven't seen from the French in the last two rounds, and it was very impressive. As mentioned though, they should have had two more in the first half, but a knock-on denied each one, and this is the story of France's overall tournament so far - too many individual errors at key moments that are letting them down.\n\nFrom the outset, France knew that they had to try and stop Scotland from attacking their own depleted back line, as they had changed to play Yoann Huget on the wing and Thomas Ramos came in at full-back for this one. Ramos was the designated kicker, but he really didn't have a great game with this. Les Bleues don't have a regular kicker at the moment, choosing specifically for each match, but as things such as Points Difference come into play in the later stages of the tournament, missing penalty kicks and conversions is something that will not help their PD.\n\nHowever, they did play with a daintiness and swagger that is quite unlike what we have seen so far from them, and their second legal try was just this. Mathieu Bastareaud - someone who is known for being a battering ram in the tackle - played a wonderful kick pass over the top into the space behind Scotland's ranks, and allowed France to pick up the ball, cut inside and score. It was a really nice try and really showed France's newfound ability to play high-quality rugby. They also seemed up for it, as when box kicks went high, it was noticeable that France's players were leaping off the ground to win the ball, and Scotland weren't. France were also very awake to the individual Scottish passes, and were able to intercept and strip the ball off them time and time again, and made it look easy. Overall, it was a seriously impressive performance from them, and should give them real hope going into the final two rounds of the tournament.\n\nFor Scotland, this was an awakening. The Scots have played well so far this year, with a good win over Italy and a slightly unlucky loss against Ireland, but in Paris they were always second-best. They weren't able to adapt to the new threat from France that led to the first try from Ntamack, and that put them behind and they never recovered from that. Blair Kinghorn was making runs in the middle of the park, but not so much as against Ireland. Clearly, they were aware of the threat posed by Huget and Penaud on each of the flanks, and rightly so. But as I mentioned, Scotland's biggest problem was that they simply didn't want this match enough. It wasn't from a lack of trying, but there were just signs such as not jumping for box kicks when France were that gave this away. They almost seemed nervous, and the fact that they haven't won there in twenty years might have been playing on their mind a bit. The fact that they changed their entire front row as well as a lock and the scrum-half after just 63 minutes showed that they needed someone to make a difference. Fortunately, the replacement scrum-half, Ali Pryce, did grab a breakaway try for them, but France were tiring in the second half and Scotland didn't make the most of this. Similarly to France, when they got in good areas, they were let down by individual errors too.\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH:\n\nI thought there were several French players who had good matches. Penaud was instrumental again, Bastareaud showed a newfound daintiness in his play, but I think that Yoann Huget's switch to the wing was an inspired tactical move. He was phenomenal all game, constantly kicking balls through to give his teammates something to chase, and even chasing other balls himself. He was a very deserving MOTM.\n\nWHAT NEXT?\n\nThe next round of games is in two weeks' time. Scotland are back at Murrayfield, when they welcome Wales to Edinburgh on Saturday lunchtime, whilst France are on the road, travelling to the Aviva Stadium to take on Ireland on Sunday afternoon.\n\nWales v England\n\nThis was the match billed by many to be the decider in who would probably end up as champions at the end of it, as both teams were unbeaten thus far. I said last time that Wales, if they wanted to stop England, had to keep players back to prevent the new kick-pass tactic that England have adopted. They did just that. Liam Williams was kept back, and he is good enough to keep England at bay on his own, as was the case in this match. He was alert and careful with picking up loose balls, and understandably so given some of the errors we have seen so far this tournament. Wales wanted to make sure that they didn't give away any penalties in areas close to the try line, knowing how much of a threat England are from there.\n\nHowever, in the first half, Wales were yet again very untidy and error-strewn, and it really wasn't pretty with some of the things that they did. However, in the second half, they started really well and pressed much more, ensuring that England didn't have as much thinking time when they had the ball. By putting England under pressure, they were able to stop them playing their box-kicks and kick-passes, because you need time in order to execute these This effectively took away England's Plan A. It was really clever from the Welsh, and at the end of the match they were worthy winners.\n\nEngland didn't do an awful lot wrong in either half. It wasn't that they were playing badly - they were tackling well and making sure that Wales where possible didn't have time to think in the first half, which led to Wales hurrying and becoming untidy, and ultimately with a hostile crowd, for England to be up at half-time was a result and a great effort in itself. The try that they scored through Tom Curry of Sale Sharks was really well worked, with England patient and going through the phases before eventually finding the gap and Curry went over. He had a good match overall too.\n\nIn the second half, it was simply a case of Wales moved up three gears, and England didn't and were very stagnant. But again, this wasn't all their fault, because Wales were pressing much more and England didn't have as much time to think and plan ahead as they did in the first half or as they have done in the previous matches against Ireland and France. The Roses didn't offer much going forward and Jonny May was withdrawn after 70 minutes, which considering how influential he had been in the first two games, shows how much Wales prevented England using the wings and stifled their play.\n\nIt should be noted that I thought Manu Tuilagi was very lucky to remain on the pitch when he appeared to grab Josh Adams by the throat, but that is just my opinion.\n\nI think the main thing that came out of this match was that England have only so far developed a Plan A - the kick-pass tactic. Against Ireland and France, they didn't have to try anything else, because that was working. But here, the kick-pass tactic wasn't working and England were left wanting. So the one thing, if anything, that they will have learnt is that they can't rely on just having one plan. Against Scotland they should be able to get away with it, because Scotland showed today that they have weaknesses in those areas, and Italy are weak in the wide areas anyway, but England should not get complacent with either side. Scotland have shown at times this tournament that they have turned a corner, whilst Italy have also shown positive signs this year.\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH:\n\nAs mentioned, Tom Curry had a good game, and Courtney Lawes played well and tackled hard again, but for Wales I thought that there was one stand out performer, and that was Liam Williams. The Saracens' full-back/wing was calm and collected at the back, and also hugely influential in keeping England back and stopping them playing their game. Certainly without him, there would have been gaps that England could have exploited, so that shows just how important he was to the Welsh victory.\n\nWHAT NEXT?\n\nThe next round of games is in two weeks' time. Wales are on the road for the third time in four matches, when they travel to Murrayfield to face Scotland in what could be a tricky game on Saturday lunchtime, whilst England are back at home, hosting Italy at Twickenham in Saturday's late kick-off.\n\nItaly v Ireland\n\nThis was a very good match overall, and it showed an improving Italy stepping up one more gear from their last game against Wales at the Stadio Olimpico two weeks ago. There I thought they were good, but here they actually showed a real threat.\n\nThey turned up with a game plan, and were up for the fight. They also knew when to contest lineouts, and when not to and to instead contest the maul that often resulted from those lineouts. They also knew where the space was. This was a match where we saw the future of Italy, because Sergio Parisse, who is expected to retire from Italy duty after the upcoming World Cup, was not playing through suspected concussion after playing for Stade Francais in the week off. With this in mind, we were looking today for the players that are likely to replace him in the leadership element if this is the case. Step up South African-born duo Dean Budd and Brahm Steyn, who were absolutely brilliant today. Italy's play so far this tournament has been very strong in the middle of the park, but quite weak on the wings, and with Budd and Steyn contesting every ball and driving Italy forward, they always had an advantage. There were still signs of the lack of coherency that does often cloud their performances, especially when Ireland scored through Jacob Stockdale, as captain-for-today Leonardo Ghiraldini and Budd got in a communication mess when Italy knocked on, but the referee didn't blow the whistle and Ireland played on. But there were excellent individual performances from Jayden Hayward, Eduardo Padovani, Michele Campagnaro, Luca Morisi, Angelo Esposito, Tito Tebaldi, as well as the aforementioned Budd and Steyn, so there are signs that Italy may have hopes for the future.\n\nFor Ireland, though, this was another edgy and ultimately slightly result for them. I didn't think that they played that well, but just managed to get the points when they needed to. Having said that, their first try came from significant pressure being applied to the Italian defence, and a willingness to just go through the phases and not make an error, which is what has sometimes been their downfall in the last two weeks. But other than this, they did make mistakes, with quick passing often being too quick and causing a knock-on. It sounds silly, but Ireland almost needed to just slow down their passing a small amount at times, and not be so rushed. It was directly responsible for the Green Army being unable to really get any momentum going.\n\nA good thing that Ireland were doing was using their kicks to find the wings where they could, and both Stockdale and Keith Earls had busy afternoons on each flank. This was very clever, because, I have said many times, this is Italy's weak point. It didn't always work but it was making Italy think and that was important.\n\nUltimately, Ireland's biggest opponent was not the Italians in this match, but their own lineouts. They were their own worst enemy at times. In fact, Italy's first try from the in-form Padovani came straight from an Irish lineout, and this is a huge problem for Ireland. It is not the first time this tournament that they have had issues with them either, so they can't even say it was down to the absence of captain Rory Best. Sean Cronin was making his first Six Nations start today in his place. Ireland also had a few catching issues from kicks, and it is these small things that ultimately will lead to conceding in the long-term. Ireland did go back to the phases because Italy do tire easily, so that is the way to beat them if you can't win balls easily. But the Italians' also had their own issues with the lineout, and Ireland's fourth try came from a mistake at one of them. In this case, Italy went in to the maul too quickly, leaving captain-for-today Peter O'Mahony off the ground and on top of the packs, and Conor Murray cleverly saw the opportunity to wheel the maul and create the gap to go over for the try.\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH:\n\nI thought there were several excellent Irish performances, most notably from Keith Earls and Peter O'Mahony, but I am going to break with tradition and give my MOTM to a player on the losing side. Padovani played well, Campagnaro was impressive, Tebaldi showed why he is currently keeping Carlo Canna out of the side, and Budd and Steyn were dominant in the middle of the park too, but everything good from Italy started from the man at the very back of the pitch - Jayden Hayward. I thought he was fantastic and very unlucky to be on the losing side. He continues to be an adequate replacement for Matteo Minozzi.\n\nWHAT NEXT?\n\nThe next round of games are in two weeks' time. Italy travel to Twickenham on Saturday lunchtime to face an England team who will be hurting after their loss in Cardiff, whilst Ireland are back at home, when they host France in Sunday's game."
