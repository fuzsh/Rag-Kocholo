        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nFor over 40 years, a considerable number of clinical trials and studies have been carried out to assess the effectiveness of family psychoeducation in schizophrenia,[1-3] and it is now widely recommended as an essential complement to conventional treatments for the illness.[4,5] The assumption sometimes held in family interventions is that the family is an interconnected system, with each member influencing the other.[6] In line with this idea, the aim would be to focus on family processes and interactions when intervening, rather than on isolated individuals. Although this principle is not the usual basis of family psychoeducation, we may nevertheless wonder whether, when it is not the case, it does not lead to a reduction in effectiveness in improving family functioning. If we want to put this principle into practice, we come up against a number of practical considerations. Adopting a systemic approach to family functioning generally requires bringing together several of the members of the family system who are experiencing difficulties in functioning.\n\nPatient participation is often difficult to obtain, either because of a lack of insight (60% of patients)[7,8] and therefore a lack of perception of a problem, or because of poor management of their emotions[9-12] which leads them to avoid “groups” where the level of emotion expressed can be high. Similarly, other family members may be reluctant to participate in a group with a patient who may be aggressive toward them.[13] In addition, the patient may be disorganized or have communication difficulties[14,15] which could compromise their effective participation in the group.\n\nIt is also difficult to obtain the cooperation of all family members. In practice, for various reasons, fathers and siblings often feel less motivated to participate in such groups. It is often the case that the mother comes alone. Requiring several family members to attend would reduce the number of families who could participate in a psychoeducational program.\n\nIn practical terms, when interventions are carried out without the patient, and often with a single family member, although it is conceivable that they can modify the representations, know-how, and emotional management skills of the caregiver participating in the group, we may well ask whether they have an impact that is not limited to the participant but is positively significant for the family system as a whole. Can this have a sufficiently significant effect on family functioning, and the patient’s level of interaction with the rest of the family?\n\nIn particular, two questions arise\n\nDoes family psychoeducation, without the patient present, modify the quality of the psychoeducation participant’s interactions with the patient in the direction of greater patient support?\n\nDoes the behavior developed by the participant influence other family members who did not participate in the program? To what extent does learning transfer?\n\nMETHODS\n\nThis is a retrospective study of data from the delivery of the patient-free multifamily psychoeducation program called Profamille.\n\nThe Profamille psychoeducation program, version V3.3, is used in several French-speaking countries and consists of 2 consecutive modules: An intensive module of 56 h in 14 sessions over a period of around 6 months, and a second module of 48 h for consolidation and deepening, half of which is delivered without professionals and supervision, over a period of 2 years. The program develops skills to reduce emotional overload, over-investment, and over-stimulation. It seeks to reinforce patient support based on motivational techniques with the principle of “rolling with the resistance,” and develops skills for developing positive, reinforcing feedback. To personalize the intervention and boost participants’ motivation, as well as to guarantee delivery fidelity, evaluations are routinely carried out at the beginning and end of the 1st module, in the form of self-questionnaires completed by the participants. Each group comprises around 12 participants.\n\nSubjects\n\nAll participants were French-speaking people. They have been recruited between 2019 and 2023, mainly in France but also in Belgium, Morocco, and Switzerland.\n\nParticipants are family carers who are sometimes referred by professionals, but more often come via a family association or an article in the press. Patient consent or information is not required. Families come for their own training, they do not need to ask for permission, and they are free to inform whoever they wish. The high probability of a diagnosis of schizophrenia or a related disorder is checked with the animation team during a prior individual interview with the participants. In most cases, the team does not know the patient.\n\nMeasurements\n\nThe data are the answers to self-questionnaires. The questions are about the types and duration of interactions between the participant and other family members with the patient. To help estimate the total time spent interacting with the patient, the following instructions are given to the participant:\n\nTotal number of hours you spend with the patient outside mealtimes per week (gardening, watching TV together, housework, shopping, games, talking [including on the phone], etc.).\n\nExample (1) watching TV together every day in the evening from 7:30 to 10 p.m. that’s 2H30 × 7 = 17H30/week\n\nExample (2) talking to him or her 2 mn × 30 mn on the phone during the week and coming to see him or her for 1H30 on the weekend makes 2H30.\n\nEstimate the percentage of time\n\nPleasant, enjoyable, or positive interaction\n\nNeutral interaction\n\nTense, unpleasant, or difficult interaction.\n\nEach participant estimates the time spent interacting with up to 5 other significant people. The times of these people are added together for analysis. For each participant, we analyze the different times of interaction with the patient and the different times of interaction of the patient with all the other associated people.\n\nTo estimate the overall improvement of the patient and participant, and to compare this with changes in interactions with the patient, four other questions are asked:\n\nTwo questions concern the participant’s mood and the patient’s condition. They are formulated as follows:\n\nOverall, compared to before I started Profamille, my mood these days is:\n\nOverall, the psychological state of my sick relative, compared to what it was before starting Profamille, is:\n\nWith an expected response on a 7-point scale formulated as follows: much worse, worse, slightly worse, about the same, slightly better, better, and significantly better.\n\nThere are 2 other questions on the ability to communicate with the patient and the ability to cope.\n\nOverall, compared with before you started Profamille, how comfortable are you in communicating with your ill relative? With the following response pattern: much less comfortable, less comfortable, slightly less comfortable, about the same, slightly more comfortable, more comfortable, much more comfortable\n\nOverall, compared to before you started Profamille, how are you currently coping with the situation you are experiencing with your loved one? With the following response pattern: Much less well, less well, slightly worse, about the same, slightly better, better, much better.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nSince questionnaire data do not follow normal distributions, the statistical tests used are nonparametric, either Wilcoxon median comparison tests or Spearman correlation tests. The tests were performed with R software version V4.3.1.\n\nRESULTS\n\nDescriptive data\n\nThere were 1277 participants at the beginning, corresponding to 138 psychoeducation groups. The attrition rate was 13% (37% of sessions had <4% attrition).\n\nSome teams did not distribute or enter certain questionnaires for organizational reasons. In addition, some data could not be used due to data entry errors or caregivers’ failure to respond. This leads to a certain loss of data, as shown in Figure 1. However, these losses are not particularly linked to a factor that could bias the data.\n\nMost participants are women (71%), and it is mainly the patient’s parents who come (86.7%) [Table 1].\n\nThe duration of interactions varies according to whether or not the patient lives with the participant [Figure 2a], but this does not change the percentage of positive or negative interactions [Figure 2b].\n\nEffect of the program\n\nOverall participants in the Profamille program described a decrease in the duration of negative interactions with the patient [Table 2] and an increase in the duration of positive and neutral interactions and of the total duration of interactions.\n\nA reduction in negative interactions was reported by 49% of participants and an increase in positive interactions by 59%.\n\nAnalysis of the change in each type of interaction as a function of their initial level makes it possible to explore the existence of a level of change influenced or not by the initial level of interaction. As shown in Figure 3, for example, if we take the curve corresponding to positive interactions, for a value of 95% on the x-axis (i.e., for people whose level of positive interaction is between 90% and 100% at the beginning), the y-axis point indicates the average percentage of final positive interaction for this group of people. On the curve, it is close to 60%, i.e., on average, it is fallen. The dotted line indicates where the point should be if there is no change. Below the curve means a reduction in this type of interaction after the program, above it means an increase in this type of interaction for the group with an initial value of x noted on the x-axis.\n\nFor initial negative interaction levels between 30% and 100%, the final interaction level remains between 15% and 25% (lower curve). There was no significant correlation between the percentage of negative interactions at the beginning and the end of module 1 (rho spearman = 0.34, P = 0.32). On the other hand, the final percentage of positive and neutral interactions were correlated with the initial rate (rho spearman >0.93 for both and P < 0.001). Very high positive interactions tended to decrease toward a central value of between 40% and 60%. When we questioned participants who initially declared over 70% positive interactions and who had experienced a drop of at least 15% by the end of the module, 63% of them nevertheless declared that they found it easier to communicate with the patient.\n\nThe patient’s condition, mood, ease of communication and coping were significantly improved in more than half of the participants, and at least slightly improved in more than 75% [Table 3].\n\nThe analysis of the correlations between participants’ subjective assessment at the end of module 1 of changes in their mood, their ease in communicating with the patient, their overall ability to cope, and the patient’s psychological state shows weak correlations (rho of <0.15 in all cases), but some correlations are nevertheless statistically significant. Thus, the increase in the time of positive interactions is correlated with the improvement of the patient’s condition (P = 0.0008 rho spearman = 0.1310), the improvement of the participant’s coping (P = 0.0024 rho spearman = 0.1189) and the improvement of the participant’s mood (P = 0.0259, rho spearman = 0.0872), whereas the decrease in negative interaction time was only correlated with an improvement in the patient’s condition (P = 0.020, rho spearman = −0.0907) and the increase in total time was correlated with an increase in the participant’s ease of communication (P = 0.038, rho spearman = 0.0811).\n\nOther significant people not taking part in the program\n\nThe analysis was carried out on the relatives of participants who came alone to the program sessions (to avoid a member who took part in Profamille being included in the analysis of the other relatives). This corresponds to 544 participants with complete data.\n\nHalf of the patients had only 2 significant contacts in addition to the participant, and at least 25% had more than 3 significant contacts both at the beginning and at the end of module 1. The number of significant contacts fell significantly between the beginning and end of the program (Wilcoxon signed-rank test P = 0.04), while the total time increased by almost an hour.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to compare the interaction time of the participants with that of the other relatives, who are variable in number, it is interesting to compare the percentages of the different types of interaction time of the participants and the other relatives, to see whether, overall, the other relatives have a different quality of relationship with the patient than the participants. Neither at the beginning of the program nor at the end, is there any statistical difference between the different types of interaction.\n\nRegarding the effect of the program on other family members who did not take part in the program, the following can be observed only the negative interaction times were statistically reduced [Table 4]. No correlation was found between changes in the interaction times of participants and those of their significant others.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe over-representation of mothers in the groups illustrates what was said about the difficulty of bringing the whole family together. We have shown that after the first module of the psychoeducational program Profamille, participants describe an improvement in their interactions with the patient, just as they describe that the patient is much better and that they themselves are much better, cope much better, and are much more comfortable communicating. These results are in line with previous results obtained with an earlier version of this program[3,16,17] showing for example that the annual rate of suicide attempts by patients is halved in the year following their family’s participation compared with the year before. All these findings are consistent with recent meta-analytic evidence[18] and refutes certain studies which assert that the patient must be involved in the process to obtain a certain degree of efficacy.[19] The nonneed for the patient to be present also makes it easier for families to access a psychoeducational program.\n\nAnother result of this psychoeducation program is that participants also report that other family members who are not part of the program have fewer negative interactions with the patient. However, their ability to have more positive, and therefore supportive, interactions with the patient is increased in a more modest and nonsignificant way.\n\nIt is possible that acquiring the ability to have positive, and therefore more supportive, interactions is more difficult. In fact, positive interactions could be linked to the patient’s capacity for positive feedback, and therefore to the patient’s condition, to a less demanding vision of the family’s expectations, and to the ability to find pleasant relationships with a person who may be emotionally blunted, lacking in motivation, and requiring greater relational effort.\n\nIn line with this idea, we find that the increase in positive interactions between the participant and the patient is linked to several factors in the participant (their own mood and a better ability to cope), whereas the decrease in negative interactions is not linked to participant change. Thus, it is observed that the more the participants change, the more the positive interactions increase, hence the hypothesis of a more difficult learning process to obtain an improvement in positive interactions. It is possible that for some participants, the 56 hours of the first psychoeducation module is not enough to achieve optimal improvement. Better results could be expected after the second module.\n\nThese data are based on declarative statements and can be biased in several ways.\n\nOn the one hand, what is identified as positive or negative communication is the participant’s subjective point of view, and not necessarily what an outside observer would have noted. However, if the participant were to inappropriately label the quality of interactions, these would in fact remain unsatisfactory, and this would have consequences either in terms of overall participant dissatisfaction or in terms of the patient’s condition. Yet, overall, the participants declared that they were doing better, that they were coping better, and that the patient was doing better. The hypothesis that what participants attribute to a positive interaction is in fact an over-stimulation of the patient and that it is experienced by the patient as, on the contrary, an unpleasant interaction, is probably not the rule, since a high level of expressed emotions usually has an aggravating effect, and the vast majority of participants say that the patient is clearly better. The convergence of all participants toward a low rate of negative interaction [Figure 3], whatever their starting level, tends to show that this skill has been acquired homogeneously.\n\nThe percentage of positive or neutral interactions when initially rated high [Figure 3] tends to decrease, suggesting that they may have been initially overestimated in some participants and that as the exercises proposed in the program are tested, these interactions are assessed more accurately. It could therefore be that the improvement in positive interactions is actually greater than observed, due to an initial overestimation. This hypothesis is supported by the large number of participants with a significant drop in the rate of positive interaction, who nevertheless find it easier to communicate with the patient.\n\nAnother bias is that this analysis is based on participants who were assessed at 2 points in time, i.e., on those who were motivated to remain in the program and most satisfied with the results. The improvement in communication induced by the program could therefore be weaker. Trained teams have a low overall attrition rate (around 4%), but in this study, which involved many groups during the COVID-19 epidemic, the average rate was 13%. However, even if the rate of improvement in interactions was lower, this does not change the conclusions with regard to the two initial questions, i.e., whether we act only on the participant or also on the participant’s interaction with the patient and the interaction of other family members with the patient.\n\nThe number of relatives not participating in the program but interacting significantly with the patient was slightly lower, but the total time spent interacting increased. This small drop in numbers may be linked to a change in family balance, leading some relatives who disagree with the changes implemented by the participant to interact less, or leading the participant to limit interactions he or she finds harmful. This effect had no negative impact on either the participant or the patient. There was no correlation between changes in the participant and changes in other relatives, but this may be due to the very high variability of the data, given the presence of several possible relatives.\n\nPerhaps the reduction of negative interactions is easy to pass on and involves more cognitive changes in the representation of what to avoid than new behavioral skills. They are therefore more easily transmitted in oral family exchanges and do not necessarily require the participant to have mastered the new behavior to transmit it. On the other hand, developing positive interactions are perhaps more complex, and are better transmitted by participants if it serves as a model. As many of the significant others interacting with the patient do not live with the program participant, they have less opportunity to develop “vicarious learning.” This difference in communication performance between the participant and the rest of the family suggests the importance of behavioral exercises over a sufficient period to acquire specific interpersonal skills toward the patient and, consequently, the need for psychoeducational programs of sufficient duration to make this possible.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe aim was to prove the concept that a psychoeducational intervention directed at a single family member could improve the quality of interactions with the patient and that this could be transmitted to other members who did not attend the psychoeducational program.\n\nIndeed, action on single members not only improves them but improves the patient overall and improves the quality of interactions. We also see an improvement in the quality of interactions with nonparticipating relatives, but this mainly concerns the reduction of negative interactions. Their ability to develop more positive and supportive relationships may require a longer time. This presupposes that the participants have acquired the ability to relate positively to the patient so that they can serve as role models for other family members.\n\nThe study focused only on the first module of the program, consisting of 56 h of psychoeducation, which may not be sufficient to acquire complex skills at the highest possible level. Today, the pursuit of recovery from schizophrenia is taking often priority over the goal of remission. However, helping the patient to recover is facilitated by a supportive environment, and relying solely on the social environment is problematic as it is influenced by too many factors of instability. It is probably easier to act in the family environment, which is often more motivated to help its loved one. However, this presupposes being able to provide appropriate support, and the ability to increase positive interactions is probably a determining factor. In this hypothesis, it is hard to imagine recovery-oriented interventions achieving significant success if they are not supported by psychoeducational programs for families of sufficient duration to transmit the necessary know-how. Our study supports the idea that increasing the patient’s positive interaction with his or her family circle requires a substantial amount of time.\n\nFinancial support and sponsorship\n\nNil.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nThis research does not involve any pharmaceutical laboratory or industry, and use of the Profamille psychoeducational program by the teams is free of charge and delivered as part of standard clinical practice.
