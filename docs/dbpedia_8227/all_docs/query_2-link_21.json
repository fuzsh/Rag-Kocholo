        "text": "Triathlon is a treat to watch, but even better to do! 🏃♂️💪 🇫🇷🥇 In the lead-up to the Olympic Season and at my humble age-grouper level, I had the privilege of finishing an Ironman-distance triathlon a few weeks ago in the region where I grew up ! 🏊♂️🚴♂️🏃♂️ At my performance level, rankings or finish time don’t really matter. Instead, the slower pace at which I complete these efforts gives me the chance to meet amazing people (both athletes and volunteers) and to finish “as a team” in a sporting event that was generous in its quality and authentic in its organization. 🤝🏅 Nicolas Pierens Huge thanks to the entire Chtriman - Gravelines team for such a great event, the champagne at the finish line, and the personalized post-race meal! 🍲🙌 I’m grateful to have completed the Chtriman - Gravelines (laboriously but joyfully) always wearing the colors of BarthFrance ! 🎉🏅 [ The Barth Syndrome is a rare, potentially life-threatening genetic disease that primarily affects the hearts and immune systems of children. Feel free to visit their website (https://lnkd.in/ew6QqgpW and https://lnkd.in/eSxaZxXJ ) to learn more. And if you're planning a race, do it in Barth's colors, too💙 There are associations in many countries. 🎗️] #chtriman #barthfrance #triathlon #imfinisher\n\n\"This is huge! 🚀 Just days after the EU AI Act announcement, Dataiku is ready to fast-track compliance for organizations. This achievement is the result of many years of expertise in #AIgovernance and regulatory knowledge, establishing Dataiku as a key player in AI Governance. Now is not the time to wait until the last minute; compliance is not a sprint but a marathon that requires preparation and organization to reach the finish line and wisely avoid regulatory penalties.🏃♂️💨 And the good news is that a series of ai governance webinars is just around the corner. 😎 Congratulations to the Product & Solutions Team ! Sophie Dionnet Patrick Peinoit Ph.D Aurélien Coquard Camélia Bessaa Jacob Beswick S. Ben Montgomery Triveni Dataiku #AI #Dataiku #EUAIAct #Compliance #AIGovernance #ResponsibleAI\n\nI had the pleasure of co-authoring this blog with Patrick Peinoit 🤝 , inspired by our session at #Everyday AI Paris last month. Beyond the crucial regulatory aspects of the 🇪 EU AI Act, the key is to build a system of trust capable of protecting value and adapting to future regulations, no matter what they may be. #EverydayAI #EUAIAct #aigovernance 🌐📑 Thanks Dan Darnell for your insights!"
