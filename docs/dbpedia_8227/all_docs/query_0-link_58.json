Charlton Athletic released their season's squad numbers on 5 August, with no number being allocated to either Moutaouakil or team mate Martin Christensen.\n\nOver the 2009 summer break, Moutaouakil joined Portsmouth on a trial basis. He played in a number of pre season friendlies but did not join permanently. Moutaouakil was also linked with a return to France by joining Le Havre on loan but that also didn't happen. On the last day of the UK summer transfer window, Moutaouakil joined Motherwell on a six-month loan deal. After joining Motherwell, Moutaouakil revealed that Rangers defender Madjid Bougherra had convinced him to join a Scottish club.

In November 2012, Moutaouakil revealed he had nearly joined Millwall in the summer transfer window In April 2012, Moutaouakil suffered an ankle injury, ruling him out for two weeks. On 20 November, he scored his first career goal, against Chelmsford City.\n\nPortsmouth\n\nIn January 2013, he was close to joining Luton Town but signed for Portsmouth instead, on 24 January. Two days later, he made his Pompey debut, in a 1-3 home loss against Hartlepool United. On 9 May 2013, he signed a new one-year contract with Pompey following the club's relegation to League Two.\n\nReturn to Hayes and Yeading\n\nIn summer 2016, Moutaoukil re-joined Hayes and Yeading in the Southern League Premier Division.\n\nInternational career\n\nMoutaouakil has played for France at Under-19 and Under-21 levels. With the Under-19s, he won the 2005 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship in July 2005. He has five Under-21 caps with France, and has also captained the side as well as playing in the 2007 Toulon Tournament.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nAs of 21 December 2013"
