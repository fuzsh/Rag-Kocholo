        "text": "Bipolar disorder is a severe mood disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 1–2% and is considered the sixth leading cause of disability among women of reproductive age.Reference Merikangas, Akiskal, Angst, Greenberg, Hirschfeld and Petukhova 1 Women with bipolar disorder are at increased risk of having a serious episode of illness in relation to pregnancy and childbirth: they have at least a one in five risk of suffering a postpartum psychosis and an even higher risk (up to 40–50%) of experiencing any mood episode in the postpartum period, including non-psychotic major depression.Reference Di Florio, Forty, Gordon-Smith, Heron, Jones and Craddock 2 , Reference Wesseloo, Kamperman, Munk-Olsen, Pop, Kushner and Bergink 3 A personal or family history of postpartum psychosis can increase this risk still further.Reference Jones and Craddock 4 When considering pregnancy, women with bipolar disorder face many decisions, ranging from whether to have a child, whether to stop or change their medication because of fear of effects on the fetus,Reference Bodén, Lundgren, Brandt, Reutfors, Andersen and Kieler 5 and how best to plan for the birth and the potentially dangerous postnatal period. 6 Understanding how decisions in this complex area of healthcare are reached and identifying the barriers which prevent women from accessing the treatment they need could inform the development of better information and advice for these women and their partners.\n\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the factors that women with bipolar disorder regard as important when deciding whether to have children and considering how to stay well in the perinatal period. We used a service-user-led design as this can improve recruitment and aid with the collection of rich data.Reference Ennis and Wykes 7\n\nDiscussion\n\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the factors influencing the decision-making around pregnancy in women with bipolar disorder. Accessing information to inform decision-making was generally very difficult for participants, as professionals were described as lacking the specialist knowledge to answer their questions adequately and were reluctant to refer them to a specialist, often because they held discriminatory attitudes towards them as potential mothers. This echoes a previous report of women with other disorders finding it difficult to access information on perinatal mental health, particularly around risks and benefits of medication.Reference Megnin-Viggars, Symington, Howard and Pilling 10 An additional concern related to the weight gain associated with many medications for bipolar disorderReference Allison, Mentore, Heo, Chandler, Cappelleri and Infante 11 as obesity is known to increase the risk of birth complications.Reference McDonald, Han, Mulla and Beyene 12 Fear was also a major theme, with women finding the term ‘high risk’ unhelpful, frightening and uninformative; indeed, several women described their terror of becoming dangerously ill. As a result, some were considering Caesarean section to avoid a long labour (though there is no evidence whether this would be helpful in preventing relapse), and surrogacy or adoption to avoid the postnatal period of risk. Others expressed their fear of the baby being harmed by teratogenic medication, and some were especially worried that they were taking valproate, which the European Medicines Agency has issued strong warnings against in pregnancy. 13 Women were also concerned about the effects of a traumatic birth and coping with the sleep deprivation associated with caring for a young baby. A supportive partner and family were seen as important factors in mitigating these effects.\n\nStigma against women with bipolar disorder becoming mothers was cited as a significant issue, as has been described elsewhere for women with other mental disorders.Reference Dolman, Jones and Howard 14 There has been no previous research examining the influence of stigma against women with bipolar disorder in relation to childbirth and only two small qualitative studies about their experience postnatally in relation to parenthood.Reference Venkataraman and Ackerson 15 , Reference Wilson and Crowe 16 This study supports the literature reporting stigma against women with mental illness and doubts about their capabilities as mothers, which discourages them from talking openly about what they are experiencing and can act as a deterrent to help-seeking.Reference Clement, Schauman, Graham, Maggioni, Evans-Lacko and Bezborodovs 17 , Reference Jeffery, Clement, Corker, Howard, Murray and Thornicroft 18 In addition to the stigmatising attitudes they feared and experienced in relation to motherhood, women reported feeling stigmatised by health professionals when they needed to bottle-feed their infants because of the medications they were taking (namely lithium). A systematic review of mothers’ experiences of bottle-feeding (whether from choice or because of problems experienced) reported similar themes of shame, a sense of failure and worry,Reference Lakshman, Ogilvie and Ong 19 but the concerns of women with bipolar disorder in particular have not been reported previously; such stigma might be associated with a deterioration of a woman's mental state postnatally.\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nStrengths include a sample with representation of women at different stages in their journey through or prior to motherhood, and from different ethnic backgrounds. However, a relatively high proportion of interviewees were educated to degree level or above (67%), which might partly be explained by half of the sample being recruited via pre-conception clinics which tend to see a disproportionate number of educated women from higher socioeconomic groups as they are more likely to have actively sought specialist advice on pregnancy. The novel service-user-led design employed in this study was particularly appropriate for this previously unexplored area of research to ensure the development of user-relevant research questions and to counteract reluctance to disclose potentially upsetting experiences. The positive impact of service-user involvement in health and social care research has been demonstrated by an international systematic review.Reference Brett, Staniszewska, Mockford, Herron-Marx, Hughes and Tysall 20 However, the principal researcher's position as a service-user researcher who had had similar experiences to her participants (as a woman with bipolar disorder who had had two children and experienced a postpartum psychosis) could be viewed as both a strength and a limitation. As other studies have found, it was an advantage in terms of recruitment and obtaining rich dataReference Ennis and Wykes 7 but may have affected the interpretation of the data. We made efforts to guard against researcher bias by having an independent researcher conduct a parallel analysis of data and, in a further attempt to enhance confidence in the findings, methodological triangulation was employed.Reference Flick, Flick, von Kardoff and Steinke 9 Triangulation refers to the use of more than one method for gathering data as a validation strategy and, although both methods of collecting data – direct interviews and internet discussion where responses were delivered in written form – have limitations in terms of generalisability, it was felt these two sources complemented each other and strengthened the validity of the findings. Given the anonymity of internet communication, participants on the e-forum may have felt freer to discuss their experiences.Reference Engqvist, Ferszt, Åhlin and Nilsson 21\n\nThe data obtained via the internet forum was also very valuable because it was able to gather the views of women who had made the decision not to have children because of their bipolar disorder (such women would not be attending pre-conception clinics or pregnancy advice workshops, the two main sources of recruitment for interview). Only one woman interviewed said she would not be having a second child, whereas 13 (26% of respondents) wrote in their forum posts that they had decided against becoming pregnant, including 6 (12%) who said they had decided against having any children because of what they saw as the risks due to their illness.\n\nClinical and research implications\n\nResults of the combined thematic analysis of the qualitative interviews and e-forum texts highlight the complexity of decision-making around pregnancy for women with bipolar disorder and the anxiety this causes them at a time when they need to be as stress-free as possible. Women described how much they wanted good advice to help them make difficult choices over medication, the conduct of labour and birth and treatment in the postpartum period, and how ‘frustrated’ and ‘angry’ they were that such information and support was often denied. This emphasises the need to implement nationally the recommendations of NICE 6 which recognise the need for specialist up-to-date advice, preferably a considerable time before a woman becomes pregnant. The expression of fear by women with bipolar disorder about taking medication in pregnancy is in line with previous research indicating a high level of maternal anxiety over the teratogenicity of medications for depression in pregnancy.Reference Ververs, Kaasenbrood, Visser, Schobben, de Jong-van den Berg and Egberts 22 , Reference Einarson, Selby and Koren 23 Women in this study suggested that information on the pros and cons of different treatments should be delivered in a comprehensible, jargon-free way, with a compassionate understanding of the potential it had for provoking greater anxiety in the recipients, who were understandably hoping that they would have a relatively ‘normal’ pregnancy and birth. Einarson and colleaguesReference Einarson, Selby and Koren 23 demonstrated that a majority of women with depression resumed taking their medication while pregnant after receiving well-informed counselling on the subject; women in this study suggested that it is professionals as well as women who need to be informed of the up-to-date evidence base. Indeed, recent research found that perinatal suicides were associated with a lack of prescribing of medication.Reference Khalifeh, Hunt, Appleby and Howard 24 An individualised risk–benefit analysis is therefore needed for women with bipolar disorder and other serious affective disorders. 6\n\nResearch into the effect of high-quality pre-conception counselling for women with bipolar disorder would be helpful in establishing how much it influenced medication decisions and whether it reduced the rate of relapse in this population. It would also be informative to investigate the usefulness or otherwise of a decision aid in this area. Such a tool has been developed to help women with decisions about taking antidepressants in pregnancyReference Walton, Ross, Stewart, Grigoriadis, Dennis and Vigod 25 and the development of something similar for bipolar disorder would be in line with NICE recommendations 6 Fear of Social Services removing the child is an issue that has been raised in many studies on perinatal mental disorders.Reference Megnin-Viggars, Symington, Howard and Pilling 10 , Reference Dolman, Jones and Howard 14 Anxiety and stress caused by such fear could be detrimental for the baby in uteroReference Beydoun and Saftlas 26 as well as for the mother, and health professionals could potentially alleviate some of the distress by raising the subject themselves (as most women fear introducing it) and reassuring women about how rarely babies are removedReference Howard, Thornicroft, Salmon and Appleby 27 or how, in some circumstances, Social Services can be a source of support. Peer support groups – preferably aimed at mothers with bipolar disorderReference Venkataraman and Ackerson 15 – and parenting classesReference Reupert and Maybery 28 were suggested by participants as ways of improving their child-rearing abilities.\n\nMaternity services could mitigate the problems faced by women forced to bottle-feed their infants by adopting a more sensitive and non-judgemental approach to mothers in this situation. As suggested by nurse educator Professor John Mozingo: ‘mothers should be reassured that bonding, attachment and infant health are not irreversibly damaged [by bottle-feeding] and the quality of their mothering should not be questioned because of the feeding method chosen’.Reference Mozingo, Davis, Droppleman and Merideth 29 They might also encourage mothers to use methods to enhance bonding such as ‘skin-to-skin’ contact and maintaining eye contact while bottle-feeding. Despite the emotionally taxing dilemmas faced when contemplating pregnancy and the challenges of being a mother with mental illness, this study also attests to the enormous importance women with bipolar disorder attach to having children.Reference Dolman, Jones and Howard 14\n\nFinally, the results of this study have implications for the training of all health professionals working with women with bipolar disorder of childbearing age, not just psychiatrists but GPs, psychiatric nurses and all maternity staff, underlining the need to increase knowledge of bipolar disorder and its importance in the perinatal period and reduce stigmatising attitudes.Reference Clement, Schauman, Graham, Maggioni, Evans-Lacko and Bezborodovs 17 , Reference Ross and Goldner 30"
