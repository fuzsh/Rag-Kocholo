        "text": "If pre-season is anything to go by, summer recruit John Sullivan seems to have grabbed Pompey's goalkeeper's jersey for Saturday's League two opener against Oxford United, with Paul Smith set to bench warm once again.\n\nDanny East, Bondz N’Gala, Romain Padovani, Tom Craddock, Andy Barcham, Ricky Holmes, Simon Ferry, Sonny Bradley and Joe Devera could all also make their competitive debuts for the Blues'.\n\nUp top, Whittingham seems to favour Patrick Agyemang and I expect either David Connolly or Tom Craddock to partner him.\n\nThere are no injury concerns coming into the opening fixture and Guy has a full squad to select from.\n\nLet the journey begin!\n\nOxford United boss Chris Wilder has been tipped by many bookies as this season's dark horse. Many believe the marquee signing of former Pompey striker Dave Kitson, could spearhead an impressive season where many fans are expecting to be in and around the play-offs.\n\nExpected Pompey team: Sullivan; Moutaouakil, Devera, Bradley, Butler; Wallace, Ertl, Ferry, Barcham; Agyemang, Connolly\n\nStat of the Day: The last time the two sides met was in 1998/99 season when the sides drew 2-2 at Fratton Park.\n\nPrediction: Pompey 3-0 Oxford United — An emphatic start to the new season with a full house watching\n\nWhat to read next:"
