        "text": "French footballer\n\nRomain Padovani (born 15 October 1989) is a French professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nMonaco and trials\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in Nice, Padovani began his career on FC Villefranche's youth system, and joined Monaco in 2001. He then left the club in the following season, finishing his formation with Cavigal Nice Sports.[1] In 2008, he returned to Monaco, after a brief period with Rapid Menton (only playing friendlies). He was assigned with the club's B-side, in CFA.[2] On 6 January 2009, he appeared on the bench in a first-team friendly against Juventus.[3] In June 2010, Padovani signed a one-year professional deal with Monaco,[4] which was renewed a year later.[5]\n\nHe was released at the end of 2011–12 season, without featuring with the first team. However, after failed trials with Nantes,[6] Laval and CA Bastia, he returned to Monaco II with an amateur contract. He then was a regular starter at the reserve side for 2012–13.[7] In April 2013, Padovani went on a trial at Leyton Orient. He trained with the club for a week, but nothing came of it.\n\nPortsmouth\n\n[edit]\n\nLate in the month, Padovani went on a trial at Portsmouth, after Sebastien Ewen (Yassin Moutaouakil's agent) indicated the player to Pompey.[8] On 9 May, he signed a two-year deal with the club,[9] with Niort also providing competition for his signature.\n\nPadovani made his Portsmouth debut on 9 July 2013, in a pre-season friendly against Havant & Waterlooville; he also scored the fourth of a 5–0 win.[10] In his following game, against Bognor Regis Town, he scored the second of 4–2 win.[11]\n\nPadovani made his league debut in a 4–1 home defeat to Oxford United on 3 August 2013. He scored his first goal in English football on 26 December, scoring the only goal in a 1–0 home win over Dagenham & Redbridge, through a 45th-minute header.[12] On 23 June of the following year, Padovani was released from Pompey by mutual consent.[13]\n\nChampionnat National spells\n\n[edit]\n\nA day after being released by Portsmouth, Padovani joined Fréjus Saint-Raphaël in a two-year deal.[14] After just one season he moved on the Les Herbiers and then the following season to Chambly.[15] He stayed at Chambly for four seasons, including one in Ligue 2 after promotion from the 2018–19 Championnat National.\n\nIn July 2020 he joined US Quevilly-Rouen.[16]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 28 November 2020.\n\nClub Season League National Cup League Cup Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Monaco II 2008–09 CFA 14 0 – – – 14 0 2009–10 CFA 2 11 3 – – – 11 3 2010–11 CFA 14 4 – – – 14 4 2011–12 CFA 21 3 – – – 21 3 2012–13 CFA 23 4 – – – 23 4 Total 83 14 0 0 0 0 0 0 83 14 Portsmouth 2013–14 League Two 18 1 0 0 1 0 3 0 22 1 Fréjus 2014–15 National 33 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 29 2 Les Herbiers 2015–16 National 30 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 31 3 Chambly 2016–17 National 30 6 3 1 0 0 0 0 33 7 2017–18 National 29 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 36 2 2018–19 National 25 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 26 1 2019–20 Ligue 2 10 1 2 0 1 0 0 0 13 1 Total 94 10 13 1 1 0 0 0 108 11 Chambly B 2018–19 National 3 3 0 — — — 3 0 2019–20 National 3 4 0 — — — 4 0 Total 7 0 — — — 7 0 Quevilly-Rouen 2020–21 National 11 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 11 1 Career total 276 31 14 1 2 0 3 0 295 32\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
