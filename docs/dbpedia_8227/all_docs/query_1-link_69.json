Adventure Algeria’s tour includes visits to many of the places associated with St Augustin’s life between studies and wanderings.\n\nSaint Augustine or Aurelus Augustinus, a son of Algeria who was born to a Pagan father and devout Christian Catholic mother in Thaghaste (now Souk Ahras) on 13th November 354 AD. He is the most famous amongst the churchmen and he is considered as the greatest spirit of the 1st century of Christianity.\n\nSt Augustine is regarded as “The father of Roman Catholicism “or “The doctor of grace” because he preached peace and tolerance. All his thought was concentrated on God and the destiny of man.\n\nSaint Augustine is also the founding father of the African monasticism. He hoped that Catholicism should be a religion of love. He was also the most humble churchman of his time. Aurelus began his studies first in Thaghast, then he went to Carthage to further his education like other promising Numidian students. He lived during the end of the Roman Empire.\n\nArrive Algiers, transfer to hotel in central Algiers for four nights followed by a walking tour including Esplanade , Place des Martyrs followed by Place Emir Abdelkader and Grande Poste (Algiers’ quintessential neo-Moorish building).\n\nAlgiers’ UNESCO-designated casbah, lunch in private home, visits to mosque and Museum of Arts and Crafts followed by Bab El Oued including Algiers lycée, Marengo Gardens, Padovani beach and Notre Dame d’Afrique cathedral.\n\nHippo Regius, a city which is more ancient than Carthage and the city of adoption of St Augustine in which he become the Bishop, dying there in 430 when the city underwent the siege.

It was extremely well organised by you and your team. I was amazed by the variety found in Algeria and believe I have to return to see more at some point in time. Please do pass on greetings to my guide Soumia and driver Mohammed as well as the colourful character in Ghardaia who was about to get married. TAM was an experience as well. Greetings to the owner of Mouflon- I must admit that I forgot his name- and his kind wife who invited me to her house. Everybody was so friendly.\n\nUrsula\n\nRob and I wanted to tell you how much we enjoyed our travels in Algeria. Both Azzedine and Mustafa were excellent. Azzedine was efficient, knowledgeable and nothing was too much trouble. Mustafa, too, could not have been more helpful and did a superb job of looking after us. All the hotels in which we stayed met our expectations. We would have no hesitation at all in recommending Algeria and your company to others.\n\nJane & Rob\n\nI am deeply indebted to my friend Ahcicene Segouini, who hasn’t only taken exemplary care of my tour groups through his company but also, at his expense, facilitated this journey. I was driven skilfully and with good humor over a very large distances by Mustapha Gueraini and was accompanied for the much of the time by Abdelkader Bensalah, who I have also long counted as a friend and whose acquaintance with antiquities staff through the country greatly facilitated my task.\n\nDr Philip Kenrick\n\nSaint Augustine - The Algerian\n\nSaint Augustine or Aurelus Augustinus, a son of Algeria who was born to a Pagan father and devout Christian Catholic mother in Thaghaste (now Souk Ahras) on 13th November 354 AD.
