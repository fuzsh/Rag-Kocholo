It was action packed and we did so many fun things. The Red Dune buggy experience was exhilarating and beautiful. The sand surfing was hard but so much fun. The food was ample and absolutely DELICIOUS!! Sometimes you go on tours offering a bbq buffet and the food is crappy. Not this tour. Our whole group raved about how yummy the food was. And the ambiance was gorgeous and felt culturally authentic. Our tour guide Asif Bettani was funny and really showed us a great time. And he took some AWESOME pictures for us! We would do this tour again for sure. Highly recommend!\n\nDate of experience : November 06, 2022\n\nA very professional company with very…\n\nA very professional company with very professional people.

I had quite a memorable and enjoyable time in Dubai . The guide was highly knowledgeable, informative, professional and punctual. I learned so much from him during the tours. I was highly pleased with the staff and I was also very pleased with the hotel accommodations and the breakfasts that was served. Everything ran smoothly and efficiently. I would certainly use Al Inara travel again and have already referred your name and agency to a friend who is considering travelling abroad soon. Thank you for your professional assistance with these travel plans.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nSarah Sajid\n\nDate of experience : July 08, 2022\n\n5 star Desert Safari trip\n\nMyself, husband & 18 year old son, went on the desert Safari & had Alam as our tour guide. Alam was superb & made the whole trip from start to finish 5 star! We were treated like VIPs everywhere. We went in the car in the dunes which was so fun & we were all made to feel very safe. Then my son went on a buggy & my husband had a quad which they loved! Then off for dinner & live entertainment which was a brilliant experience too. Booking was simple & very reasonably priced compared to other companies we looked at. Honestly don’t book with anyone else! If you’re wanting 5 star treatment, these are your guys!! Thank you to Alam & Syed for everything\n\nDate of experience : September 29, 2022\n\nExceptional Service and Awesome Private Yacht Cruise\n\nI would definitely recommend booking your Dubai experiences and tours with this company. I received a very professional and prompt service right from the start. It was so easy to discuss options and my requirements via what’s app and responses were immediate, even late in the evening. I booked the 3 hour private yacht cruise during sunset and it was the most incredible experience on a gorgeous yacht. The crew members and captain were so friendly and helpful and ensured we were served drinks and looked after. They even went out of their way to ensure we captured perfect pictures and managed to get so awesome pictures of my family and I.\n\nNothing was too much trouble and the most special part was they arranged decorations (balloons and banners) at no extra cost for my mums 70th birthday.\n\nI did a lot of research to find the best company and can honestly say this is one of the best!\n\nDate of experience : April 11, 2023\n\nSunset desert safari\n\nI came across syed & his company on a Facebook group. I was wanting to book a desert safari that allowed my daughter to be able to enjoy as well, as with being pregnant a lot of companies said pregnant ladies couldn’t do it. We also wanted to do the gender reveal in the desert & Syed made sure this was possible for us. On the day Alam our guide was just amazing. He went above & beyond to make sure our experience was fab from start to finish. Four of us did the dune buggy which was such a fun experience, would deffo recommend it. Dune bashing was also a lot of fun, Alam made sure we had the best experience while doing this. A couple of us tried the sandboarding which was fun but much more difficult that you think. The sunset & photos Alam took were just amazing. This whole experience was made even more memorable & special being able to do the balloon pop gender reveal 😍 Alam was very knowledgeable & gave us lots of interesting facts as we were driving to the desert. The BBQ had plenty of choice for food & the entertainment was very traditional. Booking was simple & very reasonably priced compared to other companies we looked at. Honestly don’t book with anyone else! If you’re wanting 5 star treatment, these are your guys!! Thank you to Alam & Syed for everything\n\nDate of experience : February 20, 2023"
