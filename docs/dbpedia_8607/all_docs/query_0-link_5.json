        "text": "The present essay aims at discussing the recent volume Creolizing the Modern: Transylvania across Empires (2022) by Anca Parvulescu and Manuela Boatcă as a significant contribution to the recent attempts at rethinking Romanian literature. In this regard, the examination of the volume is constantly reckoned in dialogue with some of the previously undertaken projects. The dialogic approach highlights two significant aspects, related to both the volume and the context in which it is received. On the one hand, it shows that the theoretical and methodological framework deployed in the volume can constitute the ground for future studies. On the other hand, it draws attention to the fact the rethinking of Romanian literature has been a collective and gradual endeavor.\n\nSocialist realism has often been perceived as a mass culture movement, but few studies have succeeded in defining its true structure as being mass-addressed. The general view on literature under socialist realism is that of standardized writing and formulaic genre. This paper aims to analyze the genre fiction and subgenres of fiction translated in Romania during socialist realism with a view to acquiring a more comprehensive perspective of the social purpose and functions of socialist realist literature. There have been many attempts to control popular and youth novels in keeping with the ideological program of the USSR and its entire sphere of influence. At the same time, these struggles should be opposed/connected to the development of popular fiction in the Western cultures, as the two opposite cultural systems share several important similarities: if we consider that the most translated authors of fiction within the Stalinist Romanian cultural system were Alexandre Dumas, Jack London and Mark Twain, the gap between Western and Eastern popular fiction would no longer seem so great, while their functions may be opposite.\n\nThe fall of Communism gave way to a frantic search for the “truth” wherein competing narratives aimed at expunging collective memory and reconstruct national identity. In post-socialist Romania memory, history and justice have become embedded in an ongoing struggle for political power between the surviving forces of the old regime and those who believe in a complete break with the pre-1989 nationalist-communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. Twenty five years after the Revolution, Romania’s cultural milieu has not yet escaped the boundaries of the aforementioned paradigm. This paper will not dwell on the critical anthologies cited above. Instead, it will focus on the debates surrounding the critical role of the writer-intellectual and the production of literarure inside an authoritarian regime. The main questions this paper seeks to answer is how should we approach literature produced during the Communist period? Were literary productions entirely the product of ideology? How did the literary canon evolve and how was it influenced by the historical and political context of the time? In an effort to break away from the socialist regime should all literary creations produced during he Communist era be discarded? In retrospect how should one asses the role of the writer/intellectual?\n\nConstructed by Western discourse as part of the same absence/ non-significance area with which ‘the centre’ seems to associate ‘the margin’, Romanian literature (including writers and writings regarded as ‘canonical’ by the local school of criticism) has yet to find a way to decentre or dispute the dominant hegemony of the established Western canon. A case in point is exposed by Julian Barnes, in ‘One of a Kind’ (1982/1987). The accuracy of the detail in this short story reveals a narrator keenly acquainted with the realities of Romania and its culture during the communist era. Apparently objective and realist, the text artfully conceals the metafictional subversion of established truths and values, and sheds some light on a political context hindering the development of culture, which was virtually unknown to the English readership in the 1980s. This paper aims at discussing the strategies employed in this game of appearances, whose scaffolding shows the oppositions between subjectivity and objectivity, but also between Englishness and Romanianness.\n\nOur article represents a short analysis of the literature from ideological point of view during Communist regime in Romania. Taking into consideration the complexity of this topic, we focused particularly on the first stage of the communism. After 1944-1945, the process of sovietisation and satellisation has just begun in Central and Eastern Europe. The Romanian Communist Party and its internal allies managed to seize power. After that, the Romanian society underwent radical transformations. It is also the case of the culture and literature. They both suffered total changes, being influenced by the Soviet pattern. We can perceive a total metamorphose of Romanian literature. The literature, like the historiographical discourse, turned into a docile and very useful tool for propaganda and Communist ideology. So, in this period the literature became profoundly ideologized. As a consequence, we notice the poor quality of literary texts. We resorted to a theoretical approach, explaining the main concepts. We identified and analysed the main differences between socialist realism and proletcultism. We underscored the principles and characteristics of the socialist realism insisting on its anti-cosmopolitanism. Actually, in Romanian People’s Republic, we had a different type of anti-cosmopolitanism, not similar to that from U.S.S.R.\n\nThe Remains of the Day: Literature and Political Eloquence in 19th–century Romania aims to retrieve the lost rhetorical moments from the history of 19th–century Romanian political eloquence. Assuming that literature and political eloquence do not just co–influence each other, but function within a complex cultural ecology, the problematological model presented here is the best approach. By addressing the works of four eminent orators, a development from the revolutionary seeking for glory (1848), through memory and energy, to a dissident melancholy (1890) can be inferred. But more than sketching an evolution or a sense of tradition, the four moods fashioned by literary experiences indicate which parts have been sunk from the isle of the rhetorical moment. The appeal to literature was thus a way to “cure” the mishaps of rhetorical analysis and the feeling that, much as you strive to tamper with the moment’s “black box”, something is always missing from the picture."
