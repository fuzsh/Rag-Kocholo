As such, I've always been on the hunt for useful resources, from which I can learn, become better at my job and help me \"preach\" science writing to researchers.

It was chock-full of opportunities and a great round-up of news and resources that will help improve my writing, sourcing, and career. It would be really helpful to have editor Q&As or to share when editors are looking for stories!” - Wendee Nicole, M.S., Writer, Photographer, Editor (September 1, 2020)"
