        "text": "How to format your references using the International Review of Financial Analysis citation style\n\nThis is a short guide how to format citations and the bibliography in a manuscript for International Review of Financial Analysis. For a complete guide how to prepare your manuscript refer to the journal's instructions to authors.\n\nUsing reference management software\n\nTypically you don't format your citations and bibliography by hand. The easiest way is to use a reference manager:\n\nJournal articles\n\nThose examples are references to articles in scholarly journals and how they are supposed to appear in your bibliography.\n\nNot all journals organize their published articles in volumes and issues, so these fields are optional. Some electronic journals do not provide a page range, but instead list an article identifier. In a case like this it's safe to use the article identifier instead of the page range.\n\nBooks and book chapters\n\nHere are examples of references for authored and edited books as well as book chapters.\n\nWeb sites\n\nSometimes references to web sites should appear directly in the text rather than in the bibliography. Refer to the Instructions to authors for International Review of Financial Analysis.\n\nReports\n\nThis example shows the general structure used for government reports, technical reports, and scientific reports. If you can't locate the report number then it might be better to cite the report as a book. For reports it is usually not individual people that are credited as authors, but a governmental department or agency like \"U. S. Food and Drug Administration\" or \"National Cancer Institute\".\n\nTheses and dissertations\n\nTheses including Ph.D. dissertations, Master's theses or Bachelor theses follow the basic format outlined below.\n\nNews paper articles\n\nUnlike scholarly journals, news papers do not usually have a volume and issue number. Instead, the full date and page number is required for a correct reference.\n\nIn-text citations\n\nReferences should be cited in the text by name and year in parentheses:\n\nHere are examples of in-text citations with multiple authors:\n\nTwo authors: (Meguro & Sato, 2014)\n\nThree authors: (Oganov et al., 2001)\n\n6 or more authors: (Yasue et al., 2014)\n\nAbout the journal\n\nOther styles"
