        "text": "About The Creator of COcoa With Books Blog\n\nMy name is Richetta and I am a lifelong learner and reader. One of my major pursuits in life is to be both well-read and widely read. As a secondary educator and mom of three, I read both for work and pleasure. I love to write, garden and I have a slight addiction to drinking hot cocoa. I will definitely have one in my hand if it hits below 60 degrees and is a little windy! For whatever reason having a hot drink helps me to focus, so I love drinking it while I am reading. Plus I can’t drink coffee…long story. I began my journey of writing reviews for both books and a variety of products in past roles as a running magazine intern and a features editor for a newspaper. Read this post to learn more about me as a reader. Check me out on my GoodReads, Instagram and Twitter accounts for more content.\n\nWhat I blog about"
