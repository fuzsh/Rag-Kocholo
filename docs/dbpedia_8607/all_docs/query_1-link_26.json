        "text": "May Flora I'm a 17 yr old and I absolutely loved this book. I think it is such a good book to read in your late teens as it solidifies this idea of not worrying too much about trying to make the perfect choices. I'm at the age where I'm starting to make lots of big decisions about my life, so it was really nice to have this idea that there are so many things that I could end up doing with my life, but there is no possibility that is inherently better than another. I would say that it's probably a good book for people aged 16+, but it also completely depends on the person. If they are younger they may not fully understand everything that the book is saying, but in that sense it may be nice for them if they read it again a couple years later and suddenly pick up on little things that they missed the first time around. :)\n\nCharlene Hardin I think it depends on the teen, but generally, I would say it is. Teens may, or may not, fully grasp the weight of regrets felt around the mid-way point in life. Even so, the book offers decent insight into how we become the choices we make and the stories we tell ourselves. I may pass this along to my daughter when I'm done with it.\n\nSusan Suicide is central to the story. As a parent, you might read the book first. Then decide if you your teen is ready to tackle the topics of severe depression and suicide. If you decide to move forward, perhaps read it together, and discuss it chapter by chapter. These are very sensitive topics, consider providing helpful resources about depression and suicide in addition to reading the book. This book has many emotional triggers.\n\nJenBsBooks I know profanity is pretty common with teens ... but I also know it's something some parents would like to know about, if it's in a book or not. The F-word is very prevalent, in fact, at one point it's said about twenty times in a row ( pretty funny actually) but, just a heads up. I know, kids probably hear that every day at school ...\n\nMirthe I am a 15 year old girl and I have just read this book, I absolutely love it. I agree with the comments that it isn't for every teen and some people who struggle with things that the author wrote will like it more than others. We had to chose between a few books in class and I chose this one, along with 2 of my classmates who are also 15 so I think it is suitable for teens but it depends on the boy or girl itself. I personally really recommend this one. My mother language isn't English, so I'm sorry for mistakes in my writing.\n\nNoor Chahal 📝I have to say as a 18 year old\n\nThis book sure set me off with the right attitude towards life. REALLY!\n\nI have power in just being alive, so do YOU!\n\n...so the only regret one can really have is giving that up when all SEEMS hopeless. Theres always a ray of hope...a chance, all depends on you!\n\n-I AM ALIVE🧡\n\nTracy Shea I would be loathe to allow my teens to read this book. Without a trigger warning of suicide, I was completely gobs-macked by the theme. This is a very well-written fantasy about all of the do-overs you will have presented to you, when you swallow a fistful of pills. It scoffs at the finality and gravity of suicide.\n\nCory Instead of jumping on the bandwagon of negative opinions, I'll just say: Yes. It is suitable for a teen. There are adult themes and language, but nothing graphic or gratuitous in the story. It is a broadly inspirational piece of general interest fiction that kept my interest to the end. It's a bestseller because its appeal is broad, not because it's a life altering work of literary mastery.\n\nAmelia.Caldwell I'm 17 years old and I personally think this is suitable for anyone 16 and up it does talk about suicide but parents seem to act like we haven't already heard of the name we know it's a trigger warning and responsible teens should know what good and bad for them like anyone of us does a parent shouldn't say no let the teen found it out if they like it we have already started, making our decisions so guide us but don't force us.\n\nDenise Hale It is not unsuitable for teens if they want to read it. The central character is in mid-thirties so I don't think the author aimed it as a YA novel, it starts with a suicide but unfortunately, nowadays many teens will of someone their age who has committed (or tried to) suicide before they reach their twenties."
