        "text": "User Centred Design (UCD) laboratory at University of Brighton focuses on research and innovation at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and User Centred Design (UCD).\n\nThe primary goal of our lab is to design, develop, and evaluate AI systems that are user-friendly, ethical, and beneficial to society, hence developing Human Centred AI technological solutions.\n\nBased at the University's Moulsecoomb campus, UCD laboratory aims to create Human Centred AI technologies that are not only advanced and innovative but also aligned with human values and societal needs. We help to measures usability, interaction and interface design, and factor beyond usability, such as privacy, trust and security.\n\nOur laboratory consists of state-of-the-art equipment, we are able provide empirical data collection to support requirements engineering, design, prototyping and development, formative and summative evaluations resulting in highly accurate process and product analysis.\n\nLab co-ordinator, Dr Sanaz Fallahkhair is a Principal Lecturer in Human Centred AI and Interaction at the School of Architecture, Technology and Engineering, and Co-leading Computing and Mathematical Sciences Research Excellence Group.\n\nDr Fallahkhair can advise on development of Human Centred AI system, Human Computer Interaction, User Centred and User Experience Design, developing and evaluating intelligence technologies to be useful, usable, and accessible in multiple areas, including healthcare, education and cultural heritage, across multiple platforms including mobile, ubiquitous, interactive television, wearable, tag-bas, game-based, and robotic technologies and applications.\n\nShe can also address persuasiveness, desirability, privacy and ethical considerations when designing and developing an intelligent system, ensuring maximum benefit to system users, product optimisation and ultimately, competitive advantage."
