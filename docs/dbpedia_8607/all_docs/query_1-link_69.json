        "text": "I am doing a coding course on codecademy and am currently stuck at a certain question within a coding challenge. I have received 3 JS files, two of which I should not modify in any way, as I was told that they are helper functions I should use and a file with an array of books. Question 2 is leaving me completely baffled. I have sat on it for a solid 2 hours now and although it works locally on vscode it gives me the same error message over and over. I would greatly appreciate any help because I am really frustrated. I will first send the introduction of the challenge and the first question for some added content:\n\nIntro: In the code editor, we have provided you with the starting code for a Book Finder website. Once the application is complete, you will be able to input a genre, title, or author into the search bar, and get back a list of books that match that criteria. You can see the list of books that your application will search in bookList.js.\n\nYour task is to finish building the application by completing the function definitions for the captureSearchValue(), filterBooks(), structureBooksAsHtml(), and searchBtnClickHandler() functions. You should only make edits to these four function definitions within script.js. Weâ€™ve defined helper functions in helper.js that you will need to use as you build out your program.\n\nQuestion 1: The captureSearchValue function captures the search bar input value and returns it.\n\nMy code for the first question is correct according to them.\n\nQuestion 2: The filterBooks() function takes in a search string and a list of books as parameters and returns all of the books that contain an exact match of the search input as an array of objects. Objects in this array should be formatted as books with title, author, and tags properties, similar to the original books array. It should use the flattenObjectValuesIntoArray() function to search all fields within a book object easily.\n\nThe helper code:\n\n// Flatten object keys into an array so that we search the entire object by the input value const flattenObjectValuesIntoArray = (arrOfObjs) => { let flattenedObj; const flattenedObjsArr = []; for (let obj = 0; obj < arrOfObjs.length; obj++) { const objValues = Object.values(arrOfObjs[obj]); flattenedObj = [...objValues.flat()] flattenedObjsArr.push(flattenedObj) } return flattenedObjsArr; }; // Structure filtered books as HTML and return const structureBookAsHtml = (book) => { const bookDiv = document.createElement(\"div\"); bookDiv.setAttribute('class', 'bookDiv'); const bookTitle = document.createElement(\"h2\"); bookTitle.innerHTML = book.title; bookTitle.setAttribute('class', 'bookTitle'); const bookAuthor = document.createElement(\"h3\"); bookAuthor.innerHTML = book.author; const bookTags = document.createElement(\"p\"); bookTags.innerHTML = book.tags.join(\", \"); bookDiv.append(bookTitle, bookAuthor, bookTags); return bookDiv; }; const renderBooksToDom = (elements) => { const bookListContainer = document.querySelector(\"#bookList\"); bookListContainer.innerHTML = \"\"; bookListContainer.append(...elements); };\n\nThe array file:\n\nconst books = [ { title: \"The City We Became\", author: \"N. K. Jemisin\", tags: [\"fantasy\", \"fiction\", \"afrofutursim\", \"science fiction\", \"sci-fi\"] }, { title: \"The Catcher in the Rye\", author: \"J. D. Salinger\", tags: [\"fiction\", \"young adult\", \"YA\", \"realism\", \"coming of age\", \"classic\"] }, { title: \"The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms\", author: \"N. K. Jemisin\", tags: [\"fantasy\", \"fiction\", \"adventure\", \"series\"] }, { title: \"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\", author: \"Yuval Noah Harari\", tags: [\"nonfiction\", \"history\", \"anthropology\", \"science\", \"sociology\"] }, { title: \"Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst\", author: \"Robert M. Sapolsky\", tags: [\"nonfiction\", \"anthropology\", \"science\", \"sociology\", \"biology\"] }, { title: \"The Parable of the Talents\", author: \"Octavia Butler\", tags: [\"fiction\", \"dystopian\", \"science fiction\"] }, { title: \"1984\", author: \"George Orwell\", tags: [\"fiction\", \"dystopian\", \"science fiction\", \"classics\", \"adult\"] }, { title: \"Remarkably Bright Creatures\", author: \"Shelby Van Pelt\", tags: [\"fiction\", \"mystery\", \"magical realism\"] }, { title: \"Crying in H Mart\", author: \"Michelle Zauner\", tags: [\"memoir\", \"nonfiction\", \"autobiography\"] }, { title: \"Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail\", author: \"Cheryl Strayed\", tags: [\"nonfiction\", \"memoir\", \"adventure\", \"travel\"] } ]\n\nThe index.html:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"> <script src=\"bookList.js\"></script> <script src=\"bookList.test.js\"></script> <script src=\"helper.js\"></script> <script src=\"script.js\" defer></script> </head> <body> <h1>Book Finder</h1> <input id=\"search-bar\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Search for books by tags\"> <button class=\"btn\" id=\"search-btn\">Search</button> <div id=\"bookList\"> <!-- List of books will be rendered here --> </div> </body> </html>\n\nmy code:\n\n// Click handler for search button let cap = document.getElementById('search-bar') let capValue = cap.value; const captureSearchValue = () => { return cap.value }; const filterBooks = () => { let flattenedArr =flattenObjectValuesIntoArray(books); let match = []; for (let i = 0; i < flattenedArr.length; i++) { for (let j = 0; j < flattenedArr[i].length; j++) { if (flattenedArr[i][j] === capValue){ match.push(books[i]) } } }; return match }; // Empty the book list container, iterate over list of filtered books, return list of books formatted as HTML using the function in `helper.js` const structureBooksAsHtml = () => {}; // Handler triggered when a user clickers the \"Search\" button. Chains previously defined functions together to filter books based on the search value, formats the books as HTML and renders them to the DOM const searchBtnClickHandler = () => {}; // Grab search button from the DOM // Attach an event listener to the search button searchBtn.addEventListener(\"click\", () => { searchBtnClickHandler(books); });\n\nI am only at the filterBooks function, I have not reached the other functions yet so dont mind them.\n\nThis is the message i am getting for question 2 when i submit my answer:\n\nGiven the filter fantasy, your filterBooks function returned an array with 0 elements. We expected it to return 2.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any help on this problem. It does not seem to make any sense to me\n\nI think that the issue is related to the capvalue but I am honestly clueless"
