        "text": "Author-journalist-blogger\n\nLeo Adam Biga\n\n“Celebrating the stories of people, their passions, and their magnificent obsessions”\n\nHow did I end up a writer?\n\nThe die was cast when I developed a precocious command of fancy words at a fairly young age. That’s when I also became a moderate reader, mostly of Marvel comic books, World Book Encyclopedia, Sports Illustrated, Life Magazine, and my older brothers’ English Lit books.\n\nPraise from teachers for my fledgling attempts at essays and short fiction encouraged me to try more. A high school journalism teacher recruited me to write for the school paper. I majored in “J” at UNO, writing a bit for The Gateway, but getting most of my practical experience writing promotional copy for the campus film program I ran. Out of college my most valuable training ground came as public relations director at the Joslyn Art Museum.\n\nDespite contributing to dozens of newspapers and magazines, I’ve never worked on staff at one. I’ve always freelanced. In 24 years I’ve had well over a thousand articles published. I am both a generalist and a specialist, as I write about all manner of subjects but also concentrate on a few. Arts, entertainment, culture, social justice, history, and sports stories make up a good portion of my work. I also write on African-American subjects.\n\nAside from profiles and features, I do some depth and enterprise work as well. I chronicled the rise and fall of the Omaha stockyards. I accompanied a Midwest baseball tour through several states. I reported from the Santa Barbara set of Alexander Payne’s Sideways. I covered the Obama inauguration trip a group of Nebraskans made. I’ve profiled several Holocaust survivors and rescuers.\n\nI interview notables from the worlds of art, film, literature, music, sports.\n\nI have a new book out entitled Alexander Payne: His Journey in Film, A Reporter’s Perspective 1998-2012. It’s a compilation of my stories about the filmmaker over the course of 15 years. Payne has occupied a special place in my work as a reporter. Conducting dozens of interviews with the writer-director, making an extended visit to one of his sets, talking to his collaborators, and charting his artistic development have given me rare access into his creative process. My coverage of the two-time Oscar-winner has also produced a body of work about him unmatched anywhere. With Payne coming off the huge success of The Descendants and his new film Nebraska about to be released, I thought the time right to compile all the articles I have written about him into a book. Interest in him is at an all-time high.\n\nAvailable now, Alexander Payne: His Journey in Film A Reporter’s Perspective 1998-2012 is the first comprehensive treatment of the artist in any medium. The fact that Nebraska’s best-known contribution to cinema is the subject of a book by a fellow Nebraskan is appropriate given that four of Payne’s six feature films have Nebraska settings and that he feels so deeply about this place.\n\nThe book, retailing at $19.95, is published by Concierge Marketing and my own Inside Stories. You can soon preview a portion on this blog site, which will also contain a link to order or purchase the book.\n\nIt is my sincere desire that you add the book to your personal library and recommend it to friends, family, associates, et cetera.\n\nMy long planned The Making of an Alexander Payne Film book may soon become a reality. My first book, a biography called Open Wide, was published in 2010. A pair of books I contributed to came out in 2012. I am due to start on a new biography before year’s end.\n\nI also write documentaries, including a produced film on the J.L Brandeis & Sons Department Store empire.\n\nI have a niche publishing business called Inside Stories that finds me writing biographies along with family and company histories. I also present Freelance Writing Academy Seminars to small groups. You can find details about these services by clicking the tab for each in the menu at the top of this blog.\n\nMy peers at the local, state, and national levels have recognized my work.\n\nThe best way to appreciate the breadth and depth of what I write is to spend some time on this blog. Then you’ll see why I brand myself as “telling the stories of people, their passions, and their magnificent obsessions.”\n\n_ _ _\n\n402-445-4666 • leo32158@cox.net\n\nleoadambiga.wordpress.com\n\nLeo Adam Biga – Author-Journalist-Blogger\n\nTelling stories about people, their passions, and their magnificent obsessions\n\narticles • web content • newsletters • press releases • white papers • biographies • company histories • historical narratives • books • scripts\n\navailable on project assignment, commission, contract, or retainer basis\n\n“I’ve long admired Leo’s journalism and prose portraiture for its honesty, thoughtfulness, and accuracy.” Alexander Payne\n\n_ _ _\n\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/leoadambiga • http://www.google.com/profiles/leoadambiga\n\nWriter Leo Adam Biga has won awards from:\n\nOmaha Press Club • Nebraska Press Association • American Jewish Press Association\n\n“Leo portrays his subjects with both precision and generosity, practicing a literary journalism that is enlightening, honest, and immensely readable. His writing is eloquent and provocative, and quite often moving,” Timothy Schaffert\n\nStories about people, their passions, and their magnificent obsessions\n\nFirst off, thanks for visiting my blog.\n\nOne of the most important things you should know about me is that I am a full-time, professional writer. Writing is my sole source of income. It is not a sideline or a hobby or a mid-life experiment with me, it is what I focus my energies on the bulk of the time, day in and day out. Mine is very much a writer’s life from sun up to sun down. Writing, editing, researching, interviewing, transcribing, corresponding, I am always juggling multiple tasks and projects at a time.\n\nYou should also know that I am highly experienced and trained. I have a degree in journalism, I have worked in different aspects of journalism, communications, public relations.\n\nI brand myself as an award-winning freelance cultural journalist writing about people, their passions, and their magnificent obsessions.\n\nMy work is primarily for newspapers, magazines, web sites, and blogs. I also do some corporate writing from time and time, and I am just venturing into authoring books.\n\nThe subject matter I write about is quite diverse, and my blog site certainly reflects that. My posts consist of articles I have written and had published, past and present. In a few cases, the articles are new versions of previously published material. There’s even a few pieces that had never been published before.\n\nWith each post I try to give a bit of insight about the project or the subject. Kind of the back story or context to it. My award-winning work has been recognized by my peers at the local, state, and national levels.\n\nSome testimonials:\n\n“I’ve long admired Leo Biga’s journalism and prose portraiture for its honesty, thoughtfulness, and accuracy. On a personal note, throughout many years of being interviewed, I find Mr. Biga’s articles about me to be the most complete and perceptive of any journalist’s anywhere. They ring true to me — even in critique — in a way that reveals the depth of his talent in observation, understanding, and expression.” Alexander Payne, filmmaker (Citizen Ruth, Election, About Schmidt, Sideways)\n\n“Leo Adam Biga portrays his subjects with both precision and generosity, practicing a literary journalism that is enlightening, honest, and immensely readable. His writing is eloquent and provocative, and quite often moving.” Timothy Schaffert, novelist (Phantom Limbs of the Rollow Sisters)\n\n“Leo Adam Biga is an astute, conscientious journalist whose interviews and articles have been widely admired for their accuracy, generosity, depth, and perceptiveness. I would position him among the finest of our national reporters on the arts and culture.” Ron Hansen, novelist (The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford)\n\n“Leo Biga personifies one of H.L. Mencken‘s more memorable observations: ‘There are no dull subjects. There are only dull writers.’ Biga consistently teaches and delights, not with showy vocabulary or flashy syntax, but by placing his prodigious talents in the service of his subject and his readers.” Richard Dooling, author (White Man’s Grave and Brain Storm)\n\nI trust that you will find something of interest to read among all the eclectic categories and tags you will find on my site.
