        "text": "From Marlon Brando’s role as an outlaw biker in The Wild One to the Ramones’ brick-wall shot for the cover of their first album, the black-leather motorcycle jacket has been a reliable symbol of rebellion. But the sinister item has become ubiquitous in contemporary American culture. In 2011, it’s not unusual to see the unthreatening sight of a 14-year-old walking around in moderate weather wearing a leather coat that is at least two sizes too big. While leather jackets may not instill the fear they did in the ’50s, attendees of a recent performance by the Japanese power-trio Guitar Wolf know that there is still some danger to be found in the confines of a biker coat.\n\nThe Knitting Factory\n\nGuitar Wolf\n\nNew York"
