You dont have any facts on hand do you? As another poster said, it was rented and Altobelli was something of an asshole. I think a big part of his problem was he was extremely greedy his entire life. After the murders he sued Sharons estate for basically devaluing the rental market value of his hiouse because she was so careless by being murdered there (saracasm on purpose). He settled for damages to some contents that couldnt be restored due to perm blood stains.\n\nThe really ironic thing is Sharon s parents ought to have sued Altobelli. He relentlessly rented the prioperty out and it became well known as a place to score free drugs and party when Melchor lived there. Altobelli didnt seem overly picky who he rented to. Manson was on the premises at least 3 times during and after Melchor rented or vacated the property. The last time was in march if 1969 and Manson deliberately sought out Altobelli who was living in the guest house on the property as Manson was trying to get any help he could to further his music career. Altobelli was a business manager for entertainers in the industry and was well connected. He refused to help and was rude to manson. On that last visit Manson eye balled Sharon on the property as well as Abby, Jay, and Wytold.........all were together having dinner and spotted Manson loitering around. Manson knew that Melchor had moved out and he knew Melchor was living in Malibu. Charles tex watson had been on the property at least 3 times/ once, Candy Bergen found him in the kitchen waiting for Melchor (the maid had let him in) and she kicked him out in pretty hasty fashion. Another time he came over and borrowed Melchors car. Melchor knew him thru Manson. So really Altobelli unknowingly fostered antagonism in Manson by representing in a way success in Hollywood/ it was this success and the symbol this particular house had for Manson to lash out against rich white people making it in society.\n\nManson didnt have much imagination really and he struck houses he was familiar with. The next night Manson chose the house in Los Feliz as he had been to the house next door several times. Both houses, cielo and Waverly, were slightly remote (by LA standards) and Manson probably figured a murder could happen at those locations without alerting the entire neighborhood. He was right about that (unfortunately).\n\nby Anonymousreply 74\n\nDidn't one of the neighbors near Cielo hear a scream?\n\nby Anonymousreply 75\n\nJohnny Carson's sons were miserable.\n\nby Anonymousreply 76\n\nSage Stallone, Sylvester Stallone's eldest son from his first marriage, died in 2012 at only 36, surrounded by so many drugs that police thought he was dealing and assumed it an overdose.

He said the mansion was extremely gorgeous ,but it was so neglected inside to the point his parents were astonished. The house was neglected as a result of being an acholic. He said he remembers this enormous chandelier that crashed at one time to the floor. He said by the look of the chandelier's shape and prisms it must have been stunning at one time. It's hard to explain ,but I believe this old man was telling the truth and he wasn't spouting BS.

She was just beginning a career as an actress when she was killed in an automobile accident on Mulhullond Drive in Los Angeles. Losing control over her car, she ran off the road and the car rolled, ejecting her through the sunroof and killing her instantly. She was 22 years old when she died. She had appeared in just one movie, âOn the Air Live with Captain Midnightâ (1979), in the role of Spunky, the blonde girlfriend of teenager Ziggy who starts a pirate radio station in Los Angeles and manages to stay just ahead of the FCC agents trying to shut down the station. Her accident is similar to the way in which her father, Ernie Kovacs, was killed. Some information about her life can be found in biographies about her father, including \"The Ernie Kovacs Phile\" (1975) by David Walley, and \"Kovacsland: A Biography of Ernie Kovacs\" (1990) by Diana Rico.â\n\nOffsite Link\n\nby Anonymousreply 415\n\nHoly shit R415- I started googling the Kovacs and they all die so young!!
