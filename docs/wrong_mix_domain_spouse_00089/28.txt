R44 It's hard because fame is intoxicating but really unhealthy for the mind.

to the person commenting about Terry melcher and the cielo driove house. You dont have any facts on hand do you? As another poster said, it was rented and Altobelli was something of an asshole. I think a big part of his problem was he was extremely greedy his entire life. After the murders he sued Sharons estate for basically devaluing the rental market value of his hiouse because she was so careless by being murdered there (saracasm on purpose). He settled for damages to some contents that couldnt be restored due to perm blood stains.

The really ironic thing is Sharon s parents ought to have sued Altobelli. He relentlessly rented the prioperty out and it became well known as a place to score free drugs and party when Melchor lived there. Altobelli didnt seem overly picky who he rented to. Manson was on the premises at least 3 times during and after Melchor rented or vacated the property. The last time was in march if 1969 and Manson deliberately sought out Altobelli who was living in the guest house on the property as Manson was trying to get any help he could to further his music career. Altobelli was a business manager for entertainers in the industry and was well connected. He refused to help and was rude to manson. On that last visit Manson eye balled Sharon on the property as well as Abby, Jay, and Wytold.........all were together having dinner and spotted Manson loitering around. Manson knew that Melchor had moved out and he knew Melchor was living in Malibu. Charles tex watson had been on the property at least 3 times/ once, Candy Bergen found him in the kitchen waiting for Melchor (the maid had let him in) and she kicked him out in pretty hasty fashion. Another time he came over and borrowed Melchors car. Melchor knew him thru Manson. So really Altobelli unknowingly fostered antagonism in Manson by representing in a way success in Hollywood/ it was this success and the symbol this particular house had for Manson to lash out against rich white people making it in society.

Manson didnt have much imagination really and he struck houses he was familiar with. The next night Manson chose the house in Los Feliz as he had been to the house next door several times. Both houses, cielo and Waverly, were slightly remote (by LA standards) and Manson probably figured a murder could happen at those locations without alerting the entire neighborhood. He was right about that (unfortunately).

Sometime before that he inherited money from his late stepfather and used some of that money to cover his dental work. He does volunteer work at rehabs and NA groups he frequently tells people to get clean as soon as possible before the drug use really fucks up your teeth and body.

Drugs, I think.

I know a lot of semi-messed up adult children of rich parents--they also have suffered from neglect, high expectations, narcissism, etc. I think the difference is that they see/saw their parents put a suit on every day and go to work, living a normal routine (even if on a wealthy scale).

I think when the parents are voltaile--and in a very volatile career where they're only sometimes working--and otherwise drugged out themselves, it just makes everything worse.

Ms Sellers, who starred in a sex tips video and has spent time in American jails for drug and robbery-related offences, is being held at an immigration centre in Orange County, California, according to a spokesman for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The spokesman said Ms Sellers, 41, has been living illegally there since April 2002, when an immigration judge revoked her residency and ordered that she leave the country because of a previous criminal conviction.

Ms Sellers will be deported as soon as possible but the spokesperson declined to say when.

[quote]Briefly mentioned by [R65], but Barbara Stanwyck's adopted son Dion Anthony Fay. What actually happened to him? I guess Barbara just adopted him for show, but it's pretty detestable to adopt a child and just cast them aside when they don't suit you anymore for whatever reason.

According to Stanwyck biographers, Dion's adoption was a bust from the beginning. Stanwyck had had a terrible childhood and survived by growing up quick and tough. Stanwyck didn't like whining or neediness and her first husband, Frank Fay, was a wife-beating drunk so no love there.

Robert Taylor, Stanwyck's second husband, tried to bond with the boy and do outdoorsy stuff with him, but Dion wasn't very good at that. In fact, the boy just seemed to be a damp squib and unattractive to boot.

In later life Dion just drifted around and got busted a few times for selling porn to minors. Stanwyck kept bailing him out until she didn't. He may have tried to sell his Hollywood upbringing to the scandal sheets but nothing came of it.

âEverybody that really knows Francesca knows why she passed away. It was a massive heart attack caused by the stress of one Frederic von Anhalt.â

Ultimately, authorities ordered an autopsy and did not allow von Anhalt to claim Francescaâs body. One of Francescaâs half-brothers, Stephen, reportedly will step forward and claim the body, so that Francescaâs friends can lay her to rest in the manner they believe she would have wanted.

It was quite a fall from grace for the daughter of the woman called âglamour personifiedâ and one the worldâs most successful hoteliers of all time. With all of the time, energy and money invested into battling over her motherâs best interests, itâs too bad that Francesca did not take more care to plan for her own estate. Francesca could have planned out her funeral and burial arrangements, even if she did not have assets to plan for. Exercising that forethought would have ended any concern that the man she battled against so fervently may have been the one to plan her funeral and burial.

Celeste Holm's son hated his mother with venom. He didn't want even her name to be mentioned. I think he became a police officer.

Someone mentioned Carrie Fisher was screwed up by her mother which I doubt that. They did have their usual mother and daughter friction when Carrie was growing up, but they patched things up. Debbie Reynolds said Carrie Fisher was bipolar like her father which is one of the main reasons why she had issues with drug use. Also, Eddie Fisher didn't give a rat's ass about ANY of his kids and Debbie tried to be there for them as best as she could. I think when Debbie was told Carrie was dead and there after Debbie said I don't want to live with out Carrie and died, I think that is very telling how much Debbie truly loved her kids and she was devoted to them.

Wow! R178, I didn't know that about Barbara Stanwyck's son. What I herd, like Celeste Holm's son, he too hated his mother and didn't want anything to do with her.

Agnes Moorhead's adopted son was crazy. He carried a gun around and did bizarre things. Eventually Agnes Moorhead threw him out.

Jerry Van Dyke's daughter was in porn ,and died from drug use. She was very messed up.

One time many moons ago I watched the Phil Donahue show with my mother when I was a kid.He was interviewing Sylvester Stallone and his son who at the time was around 12?13? something like that. His son as I recall was a good looking kid. When Phil Donahue would try to ask Sylvester Stallone's son certain questions, Sylvester Stallone kept budding in saying, he is preoccupied with WOMEN! Oh he loves WOMEN on and on about his son and women this and women that. His son looked disgusted and disturbed by his father's obvious obnoxious overbearing reinforcement that his son was girl crazy. His was only 12 or 13 years old. He was just a kid and mother and I were saying, leave the kid alone and let him be a kid.

I wonder how many of the kids of famous parents also had issues because they possibly might have been gay? That must have been difficult to deal with when you have a famous parent or parents ,and your issue could leak to the public.

His daughter with Trudie, Mickey Sumner has been in several films with Greta Gerwig, She seems the most successful, but hardly a box-office name. His lesbian daughter Eliot Paulina is a bassist and singer, she looks exactly like Sting as young man. So, no nose job!

So you know he was full of shit when he made that statement years ago about not supporting his kids. He recent talked about doing a 16 show Las Vegas residency, I assume he'd do it for year.

He seems unable to come up with any new songs, his latest album is more of his older songs re-vamped. Yet he keeps plugging away, gotta keep making that money! Gotta keep supporting those six adult children of his and keeping his wife Trudie in high-end designer clothes.

What does he even do with with his endless stream of money? The money does keep coming in, he still sells his back catalogue of music. He still tours. He produces wine at his Tuscany vineyard. He's loaded, so why make such ridiculous statement? It's not as if he's strapped for cash.

Why not help your children, especially if they're all serious about their careers. I do know one son, Giacomo, is a cameraman, he's probably working.

Last I heard, Sting has 8 residences. No one needs 8 residences. A few years ago, he sold his CPW NYC co-op for about 30 million, not sure if he still has a place in Manhattan. The CPW residence was his third apartment in the city. Years ago, he lived near a close friend on Prince Street, that was Sting's first NYC residence. My friend would see Sting and Trudie all the time when they had their loft on Prince.

R277 I read that book and it was very weak tea, Sermak was more a gopher than the surrogate daughter implied, which probably suited Bette. She described 'Miss D' as a ladylike paragon which we all know and love her for not being. BD is a monster, but the adopted son Michael seems well adjusted, he didn't have the attention lavished on him that BD did, I suspect Bette was the kind of helicopter parent we all hate today, those who thinks their kid is the greatest and gives them everything except a sense of responsibility or respect. Though only the biological one got the full lazerbeam, the adopted ones not so much. Margot ,the adopted daughter who turned out to be mentally handicapped, was set up in a home and Bette took pride in telling everyone how well cared for she was. I was surprised to find out Bette was not quite as devoted as advertised and Gary Merrill paid for their daughter's care from the 60's on and set up a trust for her care after his death in 1990 , Bette made no provision in her will for Margot ( no doubt for reasons that were well known to her! ).

Dorothy Dandridgeâs daughter was doomed from the start. Instead of going to the hospital when her water broke, Dorothy, so obsessed with her husband cheating on her, physically delayed her labor so she could find him and make him come to the hospital with her. Her daughter, Harolyn, lost a significant amount of oxygen and suffered severe, irreversible brain damage as a result. She was a pretty girl, but nothing was upstairs. Dorothy was foolish. He husband ended up leaving her to find success in Europe, saddling her with a disabled daughter. She was forced to institutionalize Harolyn while she pursued her career. After it peaked and her second husband, some white lowlife named Jack Denison, cleaned her out financially, Harolyn was kicked out of the expensive hospital and placed in state care. I donât even think that she was aware that her mother died. Sad all around.

R282, Kermit had served in the British army before we were officially at war and had been wounded in Norway. (This is all from Wikipedia; I have no special knowledge of the man, although my interest has been piqued.) Once we were in the war and K transferred back to the US Army, apparently FDR intervened to protect his cousinâs wife and the Roosevelt family from embarrassment. It was kindly meant, but surely being stationed in Alaska in the 1940s was the worst possible thing for an alcoholic depressive.

Is there a biography of Kermit Roosevelt in print? I couldnât find one on Google. His life would make a great movie, albeit one with a sad ending.

R302, right, but: (1) KR operated in a different world from TH. Haggard's world encourages extensive procreation. In Roosevelt's upper-class WASP world, by the early 20th century, there would have been nothing odd or unusual with having only 1 or 2 children. (2) While having 4 children close together doesn't prove KR was purely heterosexual (any more than TH's adventures prove he is exclusively homosexual), it implies nothing to suggest that he was not. That's why I asked about evidence.

There are rumors about his grandson, KR III, and I was wondering if the first post perhaps confused the two.

Helen Lawson's unfortunate daughter, Elvira, the product of an earlier tryst with a Nicaraguan salesclerk from the corner five and dime, was born with clubfoot and humped back. Although Elvira was quite intelligent, she was socially awkward, nervous, and stuttered in the presence of company. As La Lawson's career took off, the glamorous stage diva became so embarrassed by such ungainly progeny that she passed her off as the help. Ironically, Elvira's congenital defects may have been the direct results of Mama Helen's penchant for embibing dry martinis throughout her pregnancy.

Poor Elvira was in the middle of penning her memoirs, "Mother Hell," when she tripped over her clumsy feet and went crashing through a plate glass window in the shabby Mount Kisco home she once shared with mama. It took weeks before her body was discovered, as nobody ever came to visit. But by then, the hungry cats had had their fill of her.

When my Mom and Dad married, their first LA apartment was in Echo Park. The handyman/manager turned out to also be the landlord, who owned many properties around the city. He also did some sort of grunt work at one of the new TV stations, and mom and dad admired how hard he worked. Later, he made a killing on the sale of one of his big lots, and the next they heard, the 40+ year old landlord was taking acting classes.

Years later, they saw him again, playing the cop in The Odd Couple TV show and then later as the diner owner in early Happy Days. So it worked out for Al Molinaro, although plugging away doesn't have the same power as it used to.

Peter Lorre's daughter Catharine. She only narrowly escaped The Hillside Stranglers in 1977. They had intended to kidnap and murder her -- the police were looking for a lone suspect in the series of murders that plagued L.A. in the late '70s, unaware that they were actually after a pair of pattern killers -- but she just happened to mention who her father was to them. After they were apprehended, they admitted that they only let her live because they liked her father's movies. Peter Lorre ultimately died of a stroke when she was just eleven, and her mother died from alcoholism not long after. Catharine was just seventeen, so Lorre's first wife looked after her. She married, but her husband died in a motorcycle wreck after only a few years of marriage. She would ultimately die at just thirty-two from terrible complications related to diabetes. Like Zsa Zsa Gabor's daughter, she was a forgotten person, her corpse left unclaimed in the morgue for a month before anyone could figure out her true identity.

Marie Osmond once said she was molested by a famous older man when she was just a little kid. She said she had a lot of problems through out her life as a result of being molested.

R365, Is that the daughter who was molested by her father Seward Johnson? He was an evil man.

I once heard Mia Farrow is a shrew. That Hollywood insider who was once on DL, Susan Kastner, said she had a friend whose kid went to the same school as Mia's kids. She said her friend's kid went to the same school as Mia's kids. Susan said her friend said Mia is completely nuts. Susan said her friend was waiting for her son to gather his things to go home when Mia ran right up to her and said to Susan's friend, please take my kid home and ran off. I agree with the poster on here who says Mia and Woody are both loony in their own way.

BTW, one time I was helping my dad and his wife with their garage sale, and this old guy got into a conversation with my dad. He said he was related to one of the Barrymores I can't remember which one, but his parents inherited the man's mansion when he was a little kid. He said the mansion was extremely gorgeous ,but it was so neglected inside to the point his parents were astonished. The house was neglected as a result of being an acholic. He said he remembers this enormous chandelier that crashed at one time to the floor. He said by the look of the chandelier's shape and prisms it must have been stunning at one time. It's hard to explain ,but I believe this old man was telling the truth and he wasn't spouting BS.

She had appeared in just one movie, âOn the Air Live with Captain Midnightâ (1979), in the role of Spunky, the blonde girlfriend of teenager Ziggy who starts a pirate radio station in Los Angeles and manages to stay just ahead of the FCC agents trying to shut down the station. Her accident is similar to the way in which her father, Ernie Kovacs, was killed. Some information about her life can be found in biographies about her father, including "The Ernie Kovacs Phile" (1975) by David Walley, and "Kovacsland: A Biography of Ernie Kovacs" (1990) by Diana Rico.â

Can you imagine the pressure of being Rita Hayworth's daughter and looking like a fat Janis Joplin?

It has to be tough to be homely AF, but you have a beautiful parent.

Look at poor Alexa Ray Joel. She's had several nervous breakdowns because her whole life she's had to hear "wow, you look NOTHING like your mother!" And then she has a half-sister who's as gorgeous as Christie. Mother Nature can be a real cunt sometimes.

[quote]r40 Melcher dated Candace Bergen? Poster upthread claimed she lived with him?

Yes. They'd known each other since childhood, and when Bergen moved back to California after college they lived together for several years.

[quote]Marie Osmond once said she was molested by a famous older man when she was just a little kid. She said she had a lot of problems through out her life as a result of being molested.

Copycat. Next you'll be telling us that Jimmy Osmond likes blue.

All of them. Every last one. I used to think the Newman kids turned out well. Then I met the older daughter. A mess. Her, her husband, her family.

Candice Bergen in her prime lived for years with Terry "massive overbite" Melcher??

That is the most compelling evidence yet that she's 100% lesbian.

R395 If you're talking about Margaux, she was molested by her father, Jack Hemingway. He molested her sister Muffet too. Mariel says she avoided he abuse by sleeping in her mother's bed as a child. Her death was initially reported as an accident, but Mariel now says it was suicide.

I remember Margaux's beautiful magazine ads from the 70s.

I was very sad when she died.

R409 I'll never understand why people don't want to believe things about someone because they're a fan of that person's work. Though that may be because my mom's favorite actor is Errol Flynn, and she she's read all the books about him and loves to recount his escapades.

Woody is an adulterer, but not a pedo. But the more I read about Mia the more I understand why he wanted out.

R441 You know, he could've just broken up with her and moved on with his life without taking nude photos of her daughter and leaving them for her to find?

by Anonymousreply 442

The daughter was old enough, and they had never been married, just cohabiting.

He also could have stayed married to Louise Lasser.

No matter how old they are, nobody wants to find nudie pictures of their child in their significant other's home.

[quote]r427 When Bergen moved back to California after college they lived together for several years.

I wanted to be concise, but in a nod to our saphic sisters, I should have pointed out Bergen moved back to California after college, a successful modeling career, AND making her screen debut as a FULL THROTTLE LESBIAN in [italic]The Group[/italic] ... alongside Lucille Bluth and J.R. Ewing.
