He will explain the weaknesses of the current approach to reducing bailouts, which has been used in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the EU to little effect. Our global economy remains exposed to too big to fail banks, as the recent failure of Credit Suisse highlights. Feldman will review “The Minneapolis Plan,” which would effectively address this problem.\n\nRon Feldman is the chief operating officer and first vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, where he leads the bank’s finance and budgeting process, strategic planning, workforce and talent development, and performance.

Prof. Ron Krebs will walk us through conceivable scenarios, what they mean for the United States, and how the U.S. can play a helpful -- or an unhelpful -- role in bringing about a more peaceful and stable future that serves the interests of the United States as well as the people of Ukraine.\n\nRonald R.

In particular, our seizure of Russian central bank assets has led the IMF and others to predict that dollar dominance may diminish due to a fragmentation of the global financial system. This program will assess the legacy of Bretton Woods and the future of the world economy.\n\nBenn Steil is senior fellow and director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.

Our speakers will analyze key historical examples of aggressive, ideologically-motivated policies leading to famine before taking up the situation in Ukraine and global food insecurity. Ford Runge and Rob Johnson have co-authored several recent articles on food insecurity for Foreign Affairs, copies of which will be available at the dinner program.\n\nC. Ford Runge is a professor of applied economics and law at the University of Minnesota, where he also holds appointments in the Humphrey School of Public Affairs and the Department of Forest Resources.

What will China’s newfound alliance with Russia mean for the situation with Ukraine and beyond? How will changes in China’s economy and foreign policy affect growth, globalization and our ability to deal with transnational threats posed by climate change, new technologies and pandemic disease? Can the U.S. and China find a way to peacefully coexist and thrive or are these two giant powers destined for conflict?\n\nSusan A.

A stark divide exists between financial markets and the main streets of the world, and between companies and workers. The pendulum that allowed economic globalization to run so far ahead of national politics is shifting. Everywhere, a new economic order is taking shape: laissez faire globalization is coming to an end, and we are entering a new era in which place will once again matter. Our speaker will give a definitive account of this shift, based on her upcoming book to be published in October 2022.\n\nRana Foroohar is global business columnist and an associate editor at the Financial Times, based in New York. She is also CNN’s global economic analyst. Her book, Makers and Takers: The Rise of Finance and the Fall of American Business (Crown), about why the capital markets no longer support business, was shortlisted for the Financial Times McKinsey Book of the Year award in 2016. Foroohar is the author, along with colleague Edward Luce, of the Swamp Notes newsletter, which covers the intersection of money, power, and politics in America.\n\nOctober 2021\n\nWorld Order After COVID-19\n\nStephen Walt will examine how the pandemic has affected world politics and describe likely trends for the future.

With the fall of the US-backed Afghan government, Pakistan's influence, in partnership with China, has grown, while India's has waned. Meanwhile, Iran, Russia, and Turkey can be expected to actively pursue their interests in Kabul. Our speaker, Robin Wright, is a noted expert on Afghanistan and the Middle East and will provide insight into the complex trends emerging in the region.\n\nRobin Wright, a contributing writer and columnist, has written for The New Yorker since 1988.

Thus far in 2021, Canada accounts for 14.5% of US trade in goods, second only to Mexico (14.8%), and ahead of China (14.3%). Yet political relations between the U.S. and Canada have been strained in recent years, while economic disagreements still mark the relationship. We appear to be facing an increasingly dangerous world alone, each in our own way, rather than together, as we have done in the past. This program will analyze the current state of bilateral economic and political ties and assess future trends.\n\nChristopher Sands is a Senior Research Professor and Director of the Center for Canadian Studies and also Interim Director of Latin American Studies at Johns Hopkins SAIS.

Jordan's King Abdullah II has publicly accused his half-brother, Prince Hamzah, of sedition, against a backdrop of rumors regarding Saudi involvement. Our speaker, Bruce Riedel, is a noted expert on the Middle East and the author of an upcoming book, to be published in September 2021, titled America and the Hashemites: The United States and Jordan in Peace and War. This program will look at the history of U.S.-Jordanian relations and the current dynamics of the Palestinian issue in Israel and Jordan, as well as Jordan's relations with Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nBruce Riedel is a senior fellow at the Brookings Saban Center for Middle East Policy.

According to a 2020 study by the Pew Research Center, in September favorable views of the U.S. in several European countries reached their lowest point since the Center began polling on this topic two decades ago. Pew polling in January 2021 indicated some improvement in the wake of the U.S. election, but public comments by some E.U. and European national leaders remain mixed regarding the U.S. as a reliable partner. Our speakers will describe Pew research findings in detail and analyze the current state of European public and official attitudes on trans-Atlantic relations and global affairs.\n\nJanell Fetterolf is a research associate focusing on global attitudes at Pew Research Center. She is an expert in survey research and some of her most recent reports look at attitudes toward the U.S. in Europe and across the world, global views of gender, and European public opinion 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

Taiwan is the issue with the greatest potential to turn these tensions into direct confrontation. Professor Zelikow is the co-author, with Robert Blackwill, of a February 2021 Council on Foreign Relations Report titled \"The United States, China, and Taiwan: A Strategy to Prevent War.\" In this program he will provide background on Taiwan and analyze potential strategies to manage an issue that risks escalating toward nuclear scenarios.\n\nPhilip Zelikow is the White Burkett Miller Professor of History and Wilson Newman Professor of Governance at the Miller Center, both at the University of Virginia.

Kupchan received his BA from Harvard University and his MPhil and DPhil from Oxford University.\n\nDecember 2020\n\nUS Opinion and Prospects for a Biden Foreign Policy\n\nThe 2020 presidential election revealed a sharply polarized electorate. Is US public opinion on foreign policy similarly divided? Every two years since 1974, the Chicago Council on Global Affairs has conducted a major survey of US attitudes on America's place in the world, the most important threats facing the country, and the key issues in foreign affairs. In this program, Chicago Council Vice President Brian Hanson will provide details of the Council's most recent survey, released on September 17, 2020. The data indicate where the greatest divisions lurk and where there may be room for compromise. John Rash of the ​Star Tribune​ will comment on trends in local opinion on foreign affairs and how issues raised by the Chicago Council survey play out in the media. With this background, our program will address the foreign policy challenges facing the incoming Biden Administration.\n\nBrian Hanson​ is vice president of studies at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. He oversees the Council’s research operations and hosts the weekly podcast, Deep Dish on Global Affairs.

Prior to joining the Editorial Board, John was a senior vice president, director of media analysis for Campbell Mithun, a Minneapolis-based national advertising agency.\n\nNovember 2020\n\nTrade Wars Are Class Wars\n\nT​rade disputes are usually understood as conflicts between countries with competing national interests. But they are often the unexpected result of domestic political choices to serve the interests of the affluent at the expense of workers and ordinary retirees. This situation is the result of decisions made by politicians and business leaders in China, Europe, and the United States over the past thirty years. Across the world, the rich have prospered while workers can no longer afford to buy what they produce, have lost their jobs, or have been forced into debt. This program will analyze how the class wars of rising inequality are a threat to the global economy and international peace — and what we can do about it.\n\n​Matthew Klein is the economics commentator at Barron's. He previously wrote for the ​Financial Times​, ​Bloomberg​, and ​The Economist​, and was once an investment associate at Bridgewater Associates. He is the co-author, with Michael Pettis, of ​Trade Wars Are Class Wars: How Rising Inequality Distorts the Global Economy and Threatens International Peace,​published in 2020 and longlisted for the 2020 Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award.\n\nOCTOBER 2020\n\nHow Ike Led: The Principles Behind Eisenhower's Biggest Decisions\n\n​Few people have made decisions as momentous as President Dwight D. Eisenhower, nor has one person had to make such a varied range of them. From D-Day to Little Rock, from the Korean War to Cold War crises, from the Red Scare to the Missile Gap controversies, Ike provided leadership that relied on a core set of principles. Susan Eisenhower's well-received new book, ​How Ike Led​, describes not just what her grandfather did, but why — and what we can learn from him today. This is a most timely program, a chance to reflect on other times and other political mores on the eve of the 2020 presidential election. The Eisenhower Memorial was dedicated just last month in Washington, DC. And President Eisenhower's pursuit of a \"middle way\" in domestic and foreign policy has renewed relevance for contemporary America at a crossroads.\n\nSusan Eisenhower is President and Chairman of The Eisenhower Group, Inc. (EGI), a Washington DC based consulting company founded in 1986. For more than thirty years, the company has provided strategic counsel on business development, public affairs and communications projects.

However, this trend can easily be outweighed by the long-run effects of a slowing of clean energy innovation. COVID-19 has reduced consumption of jet fuel and gasoline dramatically, by 50% and 30% respectively, while electricity demand has declined by less than 10%. If future investment in renewable electricity were pushed back by even one year, this step alone would outweigh emission reductions from March-June 2020. The policy response will determine how COVID-19 ultimately influences the future path of emissions. Meanwhile, there is a danger that political discord over the pandemic could hamper international cooperation on the environment going forward.\n\nKenneth Gillingham is an Associate Professor of Economics at Yale University, with a primary appointment in the School of Forestry & Environmental Studies. In 2015 to 2016, he served as the Senior Economist for Energy and the Environment at the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

During his tenure, he helped transform and elevate U.S. Cyber Command into a unified combatant command. He retired from active duty in the United States Navy on June 1, 2018.\n\nSeptember 2020\n\n“Red Penguins: Greed, Corruption and Capitalism Run Amok in Post-Soviet Russia”\n\nIn cooperation with Global Minnesota, the Russian American Business and Culture Council, and the Russian Museum of Art, CFR is co-hosting an online panel discussion of a just-released documentary from award-winning director Gabe Polsky. Shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Pittsburgh Penguins and the famed Red Army hockey team formed a joint venture that redefined what was possible in the new Russia. Eccentric marketing whiz Steve Warshaw was sent to Moscow and tasked to transform the team into the greatest show in Russia, attracting some of the biggest names in Hollywood and advertising along the way. What resulted was a cultural collision of epic proportions graphically illustrating the chaos of 1990s Russia that provides Vladimir Putin with legitimacy through contrast to this day.\n\nA panel that includes director Gabe Polsky and Steve Warshaw will discuss lessons learned from this tumultuous era of oligarchs and corruption and implications for US-Russian relations today. You can view a trailer that describes Red Penguins at this Youtube link. The documentary has been received with acclaim and recently was the #1 download on iTunes in Canada and #2 in the US. Those interested can rent or buy the film on Amazon Prime, iTunes, Google Play, YouTube, or other streaming platforms or pay-TV operators.\n\nPanelists:\n\nGabe Polsky, Filmmaker\n\nSteven Warshaw, Film Protagonist, Professional Sports Marketer\n\nBernadine Joselyn, Director of Public Policy and Engagement, Blandin Foundation; Former U.S. Foreign Service Officer\n\nPer Hong, Partner, Kearney, based in Moscow from 2010-2016; CFR-MN Member\n\nNick Hayes, Russia Scholar/Commentator\n\nPaula Ramaley (Moderator), Principal, PMR Consulting; Former Director, Fulbright Fund Moscow; Former Director, Siberian Bridges\n\nAUGUST 2020\n\n“Social Media and International Relations”\n\n​Democracies have long been thought to have advantages in wartime, leveraging the marketplace of ideas and the free flow of information to ferret out poor foreign policy options. Social media and advances in artificial intelligence threaten those advantages. The combination gives nefarious actors new ways to interfere with domestic politics and puts democracies at a disadvantage relative to autocracies that can cut, censor, or challenge the online material that threatens domestic stability. This new book by Dr. Sarah Kreps, Social Media and International Relations, rethinks fundamental theories of international relations that assume democracies have comparative advantages in wartime and advances propositions about the disadvantages in an age where citizens increasingly obtain their news on social media.\n\nSarah Kreps is the John L. Wetherill Professor in the Department of Government and Adjunct Professor of Law at Cornell University as well as a Faculty Fellow in the Milstein Program in Technology and Humanity at the Cornell Tech Campus in New York City. Her teaching and research focus on the intersection of international politics, technology, and national security. She has written five books, including the newly released book Social Media and International Relations (August 13, 2020, Cambridge University Press). Other books include Taxing Wars: The American Way of War Finance and the Decline of Democracy (2018), Drones: What Everyone Needs to Know (2016), Drone Warfare (2014), and Coalitions of Convenience: United States Military Interventions after the Cold War (Oxford 2011). Beyond these books, Dr. Kreps's work has appeared in a number of academic journals such as the American Political Science Review, World Politics, Journal of Politics, and International Security, and policy outlets such as Foreign Affairs and Foreign Policy. Her opinions have been featured in a series of media outlets including The Washington Post, New York Times, BBC, USA Today, CNBC, and CNN. Dr. Kreps is a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution and has held fellowships at the Council on Foreign Relations (and is a life member), Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, West Point, and the University of Virginia’s Miller Center for Public Affairs.

He holds undergraduate and graduate degrees from Cornell University.\n\nMAY 2020\n\n“Is Grand Strategy Dead?”\n\nAre we in an era of \"entropy\" in global affairs, characterized by the uncertainties of a nonpolar world order as well as domestic polarization in many countries? A grand strategy laying out a roadmap to match means with ends, such as the containment doctrine after World War II, arguably requires a predictable terrain for implementation. Is such a long-term strategic approach feasible or even desirable amid the roiled international and domestic politics of today? Professor Ron Krebs, co-author of an article on grand strategy in the current issue of Foreign Affairs and co-editor of the Oxford Handbook of Grand Strategy, will analyze implications for U.S. strategy and foreign policy.\n\nProfessor Ron Krebs (Ph.D., Columbia University) conducts research at the juncture of international relations and comparative politics, with particular interests in the origins and consequences of international conflict and military service and in rhetoric, narrative, and politics. He is the co-author of an article in the May/June 2020 issue of Foreign Affairs titled \"The End of Grand Strategy: America Must Think Small,\" as well as co-editor of the Oxford Handbook of Grand Strategy. He is also the author of Narrative and the Making of U.S. National Security (Cambridge University Press, 2015), which won the 2016 Robert L. Jervis and Paul W. Schroeder Best Book Award in International History and Politics and the 2016 Giovanni Sartori Book Award, as well as numerous other publications, including In War's Wake: International Conflict and the Fate of Liberal Democracy (Cambridge University Press, 2010).\n\nMARCH 2020\n\n“Global Market Gyrations and the Coronavirus: Black Swan Event?”\n\nAfter widespread concern in the U.S. about the “community spread” of the coronavirus arose late last month, prices in the U.S. equities markets plunged and the 10-year yields on U.S. Treasuries sank to all-time lows. Volatility and uncertainty in global markets have intensified over fears that public health measures seen as necessary to contain the virus will lead to a decline in economic activity worldwide and possibly a recession. Some are suggesting that this could turn out to be a “black swan event” – meaning an unexpected development that could become a significant economic and political game-changer. Our speakers will bring perspective to these concerns by discussing the historical performance of the markets and the various factors likely to influence markets and the economy going forward.\n\nCarol Schleif has had more than 35 years of experience in asset management.

While tightening the party’s grip at home, Xi Jinping has embarked on ambitious projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative for infrastructure across Eurasia. He has also brought China closer to Russia. These developments are of mounting concern in Washington, as is the prospect that China could take the lead in key technologies. Competition with China will test U.S. assumptions that a national industrial policy need not be a priority and that Europe will necessarily follow our lead in reacting against Beijing. Even as we defend Western values, global threats such as climate change will require some degree of cooperation with undemocratic regimes like China.\n\nCo-chair of the Minnesota China Business Council Tom Hanson is a former U.S. foreign service officer with the Department of State whose diplomatic postings included East Germany, France, Norway, the Soviet Union, Sweden, and the former Soviet Republic of Georgia.

So is it just our perception, or does human migration present thornier political and pragmatic challenges today than it has in the past? In recent decades, what has changed — and what hasn’t? In a topic as large as human migration, this presentation will review the trends, context and causes of human migration over the past several decades. We will also examine the regional and global response to migration, with a particular eye towards U.S. actions and attitudes. The question of whether we are becoming more capable or less capable of dealing productively with those underlying causes and consequences looms large. To a significant degree, interpretation of facts and creation of solutions are dependent upon values and moral preferences. What are those values and are they mutually compatible? Should we be optimistic or pessimistic that these differences can be effectively be addressed?\n\nA physician by training, Maureen Reed’s career spans medical practice, non-profit leadership, university governance and politics.

Since 1961, the St. Paul-based institute has brought nearly 600 journalists from almost 100 countries to America for briefings with U.S. journalists, political, business and community leaders and policy experts. This year’s fellows – from Belarus, Bulgaria, Hungary, Uganda, and Uruguay – began their fellowship in the Twin Cities, visited Ely and New Ulm in Minnesota, and then traveled to seven cities across the country, including Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C., Austin, and Miami, where they met with community, business and political leaders as well as policy experts and journalists.\n\nMartin Kibaba​, editorial manager, reporter and talk-show host at ​LifeFm​ radio in Kampala, Uganda.\n\nHanna Liubakova,​ freelance journalist for ​Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Belsat TV​ and other media outlets in Minsk, Belarus.\n\nGergő Plankó​, journalist, video reporter and editor at ​444.hu​, an online digital platform in Budapest, Hungary.\n\nMaría Luján Scarpinelli​, editor and multimedia journalist for Latin America at ​Agence France-Presse​ (AFP), in Montevideo, Uruguay, and in Argentina.\n\nRosen Tsvetkov​, investigative journalist, news reporter and producer of documentaries forbTV​ in Sofia, Bulgaria.\n\nSeptember 2019\n\n“Disputes About ‘Socialism’ Are Actually About Varieties of Capitalism”\n\n​Socialism used to be defined as direct government ownership of the means of production. However, most of the current Americans who refer to themselves as \"socialists\" are instead referring to different varieties of capitalism. This talk will begin with an overview of how the meaning of \"socialism\" has shifted. But the main focus will be on describing some of the key differences across different varieties of capitalism like the US/UK model, the German/Japanese model, the Scandinavian model, and state-run capitalism in its Chinese incarnation. Some key differences include: Is participation in the workforce encouraged by monetary rewards or by providing social programs (Iike child care) that are complementary to work? To what extent does the government rely on broad-based income taxes or on taxes on corporations and those with higher incomes? Is the financial sector bank-based or equity-based? How active is the government in redistribution of income?\n\nTimothy Taylor has been Managing Editor of the ​Journal of Economic Perspectives​, a quarterly academic journal published by the American Economic Association, since the journal’s inception in 1987.

Olson will speak about fictionalizing the very real national security challenges of the 21st Century, to include nuclear proliferation, non-state actors, home-grown radicalism, and cyber warfare. Known as \"The Two Navy Guys\" writing team, they are U.S. Naval Academy graduates who use their extensive military, intelligence community, and business backgrounds to pen \"ripped from the headlines\" national security thrillers. Over the past five years, they have collaborated on three novels. Their first two works, ​Weapons of Mass Destruction​ and ​Jihadi Apprentice​, were crowd-funded and independently published. Their third novel, ​Rules of Engagement​, was released by St. Martin's Press/MacMillan on June 25th. This story opens with a deadly cyber attack on a U.S. power plant and sets the world's most powerful navies on a collision course for World War III.\n\nJune 2019\n\n“Trends in Democratic Governance in Africa\"\n\nBy several measures, African democracy is in decline. New trends in electoral authoritarianism and governance failures are chipping away at the democratic gains made since the end of the Cold War. There are steps the international community could take to shore up democratic governance in the region, but with former champions of democracy distracted or ambivalent, the outlook for resilient and accountable democratic governance on the continent is uncertain at best.\n\nAmbassador Michelle D.

Article Nine of Japan’s constitution, drafted by U.S. authorities in 1946, claims that the Japanese people “forever renounce the use of force as a means of settling international disputes,” and the constraints of this pledge still bind Japan’s military activities today. Yet a fundamental shift in East Asian geopolitics has forced Japan’s policymakers to rethink the role of the Self-Defense Forces. Japan has increasingly flexed its muscles—deploying troops under UN auspices, participating in coercive sanctions, and raising defense budgets. Japan is not only responding to increasing threats from North Korean missiles and Chinese maritime activities but also reevaluating its dependence on its increasingly unpredictable ally, the United States.\n\nSheila A. Smith, an expert on Japanese politics and foreign policy, is senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

What concrete steps are we taking to promote peaceful, productive and profitable international relations? What concrete steps are we taking to challenge the promotion of new wars — cold and hot? How are we actively promoting public and policymaker awareness of our short and long-term global interdependence? And how can we effectively challenge restrictions on our ability to engage in citizen diplomacy?\n\n​Mark Ritchie is president of Global Minnesota, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization devoted to advancing international understanding and engagement.

In the coming months the European Union will be tested by new twists and turns in the Brexit issue as well as by EU parliamentary elections in May that risk a strong showing by populist parties skeptical of European unity. At the same time, external factors — severe disagreements with the US, the constant threat from Russia, China's economic initiatives in the European space, and ongoing immigration from the Middle East and Africa — further complicate EU politics and diplomacy. This program will assess EU strengths and prospects in light of the internal and external challenges facing Europe today.\n\n​Catherine Guisan is Visiting Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Minnesota.

Yet humanity faces floods and waterlogging at the same time we wrestle with droughts and famine. We’ll explore how much water is available on earth and how ‘water-scarce’ we really are. These global challenges, in the context of increasingly significant impacts on many aspects of the environment and climate, are shaping the political and ideological landscape, with potentially profound implications for 21s​ t​ century geopolitics.\n\nProfessor Joseph Underhill teaches courses in environmental politics, international relations, and political methodology at Augsburg College.

The tensions and drivers that provided a breeding ground for ISIS and al-Qaeda to operate from within and beyond the Middle East are still present. Foreign influences, regional sectarian tensions, and economic instability help drive radicalization and instability. In what ways will the caliphate’s demise strengthen or weaken the overall jihadist network? What are the prospects for ISIS to resurge in Syria and the region given the inability to fully destroy its fighting force thus far? And how should America direct its foreign policy and military presence in the region?\n\nJennifer Cafarella is the director of Intelligence Planning at the Institute for the Study of War.

This is occurring against the background of democratic regression, rise of religious nationalism and growing economic woes in Turkey, all under his stewardship of the country. Once lauded as a model for democratic transformation and economic success, the growing tensions with the United States and Europe raise significant questions about the future of the Turkish relationship and its role in the greater Middle East. What is the likely relationship of Turkey with the EU? What is the country’s role as a current member of NATO, especially as Turkey appears to get closer to Russia? What is to become of the Syrian refugee situation in which Turkey is so critically involved? In this special program, Kemal Kirişci will discuss Turkey's historic and future role, describing the challenges the country faces as well as its potential to advance.\n\nKemal Kirişci is the TÜSİAD senior fellow and director of the Center on the United States and Europe's Turkey Project at Brookings, with an expertise in Turkish foreign policy and migration studies.

Despite persistent domestic problems, India is changing how it presents itself to the world, transitioning to a “leading power” rather than a “balancing power.” To better reflect its growing economic weight, India seeks a larger voice in global institutions, including the UN Security Council, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund; and is working on other tracks to create alternative institutions. In 2015, after years of holding out, India stepped forward to help craft the Paris agreement on climate change, and has convened the International Solar Alliance with France. How should the United States work with a rising yet fiercely independent India?\n\nAlyssa Ayres is senior fellow for India, Pakistan, and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations.

The textbook answer is that they obtain it from intelligence agencies or other parts of the government bureaucracy. In fact, the biggest U.S. foreign policy decisions have been guided not by input from those agencies but instead by beliefs that policymakers bring with them into office. Those beliefs are profoundly shaped by the unique American experience. The roots of how Americans view the world can be found in America's own history, geography, culture and domestic politics and society. The uniqueness of the American experience underlies many misperceptions Americas have about other countries. Those misperceptions underlie policy failures ranging from over-optimistic attempts to implant democracy in other cultures to mistaken beliefs about what drives international terrorism.\n\nPaul Pillar is the author of four books, including Why America Misunderstands the World. Pillar was a career officer with the Central Intelligence Agency, where he held a variety of senior analytical and managerial responsibilities.

Over the past five years, he has taken unprecedented steps to consolidate his authority, has overseen the expansion of the Community Party's role in Chinese political, social and economic life and has constructed a virtual wall of regulations to control more closely the exchange of ideas and capital between China and the outside world. Beyond its borders, Beijing has recast itself as a great power, seeking to reclaim its past glory and to create a system of international norms that better serves its more ambitious geostrategic objectives. Will China realize these domestic and foreign policy goals under Xi? How should the United States and others respond in order to protect and advance their own interests?\n\nElizabeth Economy is the C.V. Starr senior fellow and director of Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. She is an acclaimed author and expert on Chinese foreign and domestic policy.

His tenure there spans an earth-shattering era for Russia, and he remains at the Archive today. As head of Russia's major depository of historical documents, he oversaw a broad declassification of the country's classified archives. At the start of his career as director of the State Archive, approximately 40 percent of the files there were classified compared with a global norm of 4 to 5 percent. Mironenko spearheaded an \"archival revolution,\" putting much previously inaccessible information into the public sphere. This process has opened up a treasure trove of new material for historians and other scholars around the world. Sergei Mironenko has railed against the falsification of history, and has used archival documents and research to debunk Soviet era \"myths,\" sometimes drawing heavy criticism.\n\nSergei Mironenko was born in 1951 into a family of a history professor and a pediatrician. He earned his advanced degrees in Russian history from Lomonosov Moscow State University, has taught at several institutions of higher learning and, since 2006, has been the head of the Department of Russian History on the 19th and 20th Centuries at Lomononov Moscow State. Mironenko has edited and authored numerous publications and hosted television programs about history such as \"Archival Secrets\" and \"Documents and Fates.\"\n\nMAY 2018\n\n\"Saudi Arabia on the Cusp of Change: Traditions and Future Prospects\"\n\nUnder a dynamic and forceful young crown prince, Saudi Arabia is embarked on radical new steps in domestic and foreign policy. The jury is still out on the ultimate impact of Mohammed Bin Salmon's ambitious plans for a demographically young yet tradition-bound society. And there is growing concern that the regional rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia in pragmatic cooperation with Israel may be building toward military confrontation. The Trump Administration's abrupt swing away from Iran and toward the Saudis, including support for their campaign in Yemen, adds further volatility to the mix. This program will be based in part on insights and a wide array of images from a visit to the kingdom in 2016.\n\nTom Hanson, Diplomat in Residence at the University of Minnesota-Duluth, is chair of Minnesota Committee on Foreign Relations.
