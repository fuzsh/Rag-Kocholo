        "text": "A\n\na/an\n\nPronunciation is the key. Use \"an\" before any word or abbreviation beginning with a vowel sound, including words beginning with a silent \"h\" (as far as we know there are only four of these: hour, honour, heir, honest and their derivatives). You use \"a\" with consonant sounds (eg: unicorn), including words beginning with an \"h\" which is pronounced (eg: hat, hotel).\n\nAbbas, Mahmoud\n\n(Palestinian Authority president.) We should call him Mahmoud Abbas alone, unless he is referred to in a quotation as Abu Mazen, when we can use the formula \"Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen\" to explain. In feature-type pieces it would be acceptable to use both terms.\n\nAboriginal\n\nMeans indigenous; earliest known inhabitants of a particular country. Use a cap (Aboriginal) if the reference is to the Indigenous Australians but note the term excludes Torres Strait Islander people and culture; otherwise, aboriginal. See also Indigenous Australians.\n\nabortion\n\nAvoid pro-abortion, and use pro-choice instead. And use anti-abortion rather than pro-life, except where it is part of the title of a group's name.\n\nAbu Bakar Ba'asyir\n\nA Muslim cleric, alleged spiritual leader of militant group Jemaah Islamiah, convicted of charges relating to the bombings in Bali and at the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta. Give full name at first mention; subsequently Ba'asyir.\n\nAbu Hamza al-Masri\n\nAt first mention only, spell out his full name - thereafter he can be referred to as Abu Hamza. Never shorten the name to \"Hamza\", even in a headline.\n\nAbu Qatada\n\n(Radical Palestinian-Jordanian cleric.) He remains Abu Qatada at second reference.\n\nAcas\n\n(ie initial cap only) NB: it is not the government's Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. It is independent.\n\naccents\n\nWe do use some accents on foreign names - umlauts, tildes etc on French, German, Spanish and Portuguese personal and placenames. But we don't use them on accented words that have passed into English, such as \"cafe\", \"facade\", \"fiancee\".\n\naccidents\n\nFor legal reasons, be careful about saying one vehicle \"hit\" another. Err on the side of caution and use collided with/was in collision with. (Collisions involve two or more moving objects; they cannot involve something stationary.)\n\nAchilles heel\n\nie no apostrophe and upper case \"A\".\n\nacid attack\n\nmay be incorrect in specific cases (alkali) fine as a generic\n\nacronyms\n\nUse the abbreviated form of a title without explanation only if there is no chance of any misunderstanding (eg UN, Nato, IRA, BBC). Otherwise, spell it out in full at first reference, or introduce a label (eg the public sector union Unite).\n\nWhere you would normally pronounce the abbreviation as a string of letters - an initialism - use all capitals with no full stops or spaces (eg FA,UNHCR). However, our style is to use lower case with an initial cap for acronyms where you would normally pronounce the set of letters as a word (eg Sars, Mers, Aids, Nafta, Nasa, Opec, Apec).\n\nThere are a few exceptions:\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is capped up ie NICE\n\nThe UK Independence Party is capped up ie UKIP\n\nStrategic Health Authority becomes SHA (\"Sha\" looks like a typo)\n\nSeasonal Affective Disorder becomes SAD (\"Sad\" would be confusing).\n\nFor names with initials, we avoid full stops and spaces (ie JK Rowling and WH Smith).\n\nWhen abbreviating a phrase, rather than a name or title, use lower case (ie lbw, mph).\n\nactor/actress\n\nusing the term \"actress\" (or comedienne) is OK. Actors is fine if describing a mixed group: A number of people at the theatre were treated for smoke inhalation, including several of the actors.\n\nActs/acts (of parliament)\n\nUse lower case unless you are naming a specific act - eg: He argued for a new government act on petrol taxes because, he said, the Finance Act had proved a disaster. The same logic applies for a parliamentary bill ie lower case if non-specific, initial cap if named.\n\nAD\n\n(in the year of the Lord) ie unpunctuated. It goes before the year (eg AD800) - with no gap. Avoid CE (Common Era) unless justified by a particular historical, religious or academic context.\n\nadd, to\n\nAs in: \"This is the end of the road,\" he added. Should be used sparingly; acceptable only if it really is the last addition to a set of quotes. And do NOT use with indirect quotes (eg \"He added that this was the end of the road.\")\n\nadmit\n\nUse with care. To say: \"He admitted his companion had fired the first shot\" suggests we accept what is being said as the truth. A more neutral term such as said is preferable.\n\nNB: when using \"admit\" in the sense of \"plead guilty to\", there is no need for a preposition eg \"He admitted to manslaughter\". Just say \"He admitted manslaughter\".\n\nadrenalin\n\nis our preferred spelling - not adrenaline.\n\nAdvertising Standards Authority\n\n- and not \"Agency\".\n\nadviser\n\nis our preferred spelling, not \"advisor\". But advisory - with an \"o\".\n\naeroplane\n\nis the correct spelling - do not use airplane, which is the American term. Better anyway just to write plane.\n\naffect/effect\n\nNot synonymous. The verb \"to affect\" means \"to have an influence on\" eg Wine does not affect me; \"to effect\" means \"to cause, accomplish\" eg A month at the clinic effected my recovery.\n\nAfrikaans\n\nis the language (and the adjective). The people are Afrikaners.\n\nage\n\nAlways hyphenate the adjectival, whether it is eg seven-year-old child or 100-year-old coin. Hyphens should also be included in the noun eg There are to be more school tests for eight-year-olds - though hyphens are not necessary in sentences such as The missing boy is three years old.\n\nAn age placed after a name should be sandwiched between commas eg John Jones, 61, has been knighted.\n\nageing\n\nis our preferred spelling - and not \"aging\".\n\nagenda\n\nIs singular eg The agenda was fiercely contested.\n\nAids\n\nie initial cap only. It stands for \"acquired immune deficiency syndrome\". People carrying the Aids antibody are HIV-positive or carrying the Aids virus. Only when they become ill can they be said to have Aids. They are best described as patients - or people with Aids/people living with Aids, and not victims or sufferers (NB: since HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus it is, strictly speaking, tautological to refer to the \"HIV virus\").\n\nairbase/aircrew/airdrop/airlift\n\nie in each case, one word - and no hyphen.\n\nair force/air strike/air raid\n\nie in each case, two words - and no hyphen.\n\nal-Aqsa mosque (updated November 2023)\n\nie with a hyphen. \"al\" is the equivalent of the definite article in Arabic. Do not say \"the al-Aqsa mosque\", or âthe Aqsa mosqueâ, rather just al-Aqsa mosque.\n\nal-Iraqiyya\n\n(the main Sunni-backed alliance in Iraq) ie with a hyphen and two \"y\"s.\n\nAlasdair/Alastair/Aleister/Alistair\n\nBe aware that there are several ways to spell this name.\n\nA-level\n\nie with hyphen and lower case \"l\".\n\nAl Fayed\n\nEgyptian businessman. Retain the \"Al\" (initial cap, and no hyphen), as it is part of the family name: Mohamed Al Fayed, also Mr Al Fayed and the late Dodi Al Fayed.\n\nAl Jazeera\n\nArabic television channel, based in Qatar. Cap \"A\" and no hyphen.\n\nAllahu Akbar\n\nis our preferred spelling and the translation should be God is greatest rather than \"God is great\".\n\nall right\n\nand never \"alright\" (unless part of a title, as in It'll Be Alright on the Night).\n\nal-Maliki, Nouri\n\n(former Iraqi prime minister) ie not Nuri.\n\nal-Megrahi, Abdelbaset Ali\n\n(Libyan convicted over Lockerbie who died in 2012.) We previously used the full name given in legal documents - Abdelbaset ali Mohmed al-Megrahi. However, for consistency and simplicity, stick to the above. On second reference it is just Megrahi.\n\nal-Motassadek, Mounir\n\n(Moroccan student convicted in Germany for being an accessory to the 9/11 attacks) (ie lower case \"al\" followed by a hyphen). On second reference, just Motassadek.\n\nal-Muhajiroun\n\n(Radical British group also known as Islam4UK, banned since January 2010) ie lower case \"al\", followed by a hyphen and capital \"M\". Make it clear in news stories that this group and others like it are regarded by the majority of British Muslims as unrepresentative - ideally, through a quote to that effect from a leading mainstream Muslim group such as the Muslim Council of Britain. Preachers associated with these groups should not be described simply as \"Muslim clerics\", but as radical, fringe or similar.\n\nal-Qaeda\n\nie lower case \"al\", hyphen, and upper case \"Q\".\n\nalternative\n\nStrictly speaking, alternative should be used only when the choice is limited to two objects or courses of action. If there are more than two, we should refer to an option or choice.\n\nAM\n\nie both caps, no gap. Stands for Assembly Member (plural: AMs), which applied to members of the National Assembly for Wales until May 2020, when the institution became the Welsh Parliament. Since then, members have been called MSs (Members of the Senedd).\n\nMembers of the assembly in Belfast are MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly).\n\nambassador\n\n\"To\" a country, or \"in\" a city (eg The British ambassador to France or The German ambassador in Paris). Always lower case.\n\nAmerica\n\nshould not be used as a synonym for the United States on first reference unless it is clear from the context that is what is being referred to. For brevity, US is OK (eg: The US president is to visit Belfast; Police throughout the US are on high alert).\n\nNB: Do not refer to \"North America\" unless you specifically mean the continent of North America, which includes Canada, Mexico and Greenland.\n\nAmerican spellings\n\nAmerican spellings should not be used for job titles (eg \"US Defence Secretary Robert Jones\", rather than \"Defense Secretary\"). However, they are retained for the official names of organisations, buildings etc (eg US Department of Defense, Lincoln Center, World Trade Center, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n\nAmericanisms\n\nTake care not to copy and paste them from agency copy. We say: meet (not \"meet with\"), consult (not \"consult with\"), talk to (not \"talk with\"), protest against a decision (not \"protest a decision\"), appeal against a verdict (not \"appeal a verdict\"). We say car rather than \"automobile\", town centre rather than \"downtown\", shopping centre rather than \"shopping mall\", dustbin rather than \"trash can\", lorry driver rather than \"trucker\", producer rather than \"showrunner\", mortuary rather than \"morgue\", power cut rather than \"outage\", which should be used in reference only to a website/online service that temporarily breaks down, surge rather than âuptickâ, aluminium rather than âaluminumâ. Do not use ouster. We tend not to convert nouns into verbs (avoid \"to hospitalise\", \"to scapegoat\", \"to rubbish\", \"to debut\"). Our sports teams do not \"post\" a total (eg of runs) - they score it. News agencies might report that protesters have been throwing rocks - we would use stones. Beware words that have different meanings for US and UK audiences eg: \"slated\", \"suspenders\", \"pants\" etc.\n\nThere may be occasions when using the American version of a word in a headline is acceptable for SEO purposes. This might be the use of the word âtruckâ for a lorry attack carried out in the US, or referring to a US shopping centre as a âmallâ in a headline. However even when we use the American version of the word in a headline, we should still continue to use the British version in the story â this is not free rein to use Americanisms throughout the piece. The American version of a word should NOT be used even for SEO purposes in a story which does not originate in or specifically concern North America â eg we should not use the word âroosterâ instead of âcockerelâ for a story about a cockerel based in France.\n\nAmerica's Cup\n\nie apostrophe before the \"s\". Initial caps.\n\namid\n\nAnd not \"amidst\".\n\namok\n\nWe say \"run amok\" - rather than \"run amuck\".\n\namong\n\nAnd not \"amongst\".\n\nampersands\n\nIf an organisation uses one then so do we (eg P&O). We also use one in matchplay golf scores (eg Faldo beat Woods, 3&2), and in R&B as an abbreviation for rhythm and blues.\n\nannex/annexe\n\n\"annex\" is the verb. The noun is \"annexe\".\n\nantenna\n\nThe plural is antennae for an insect's feelers, antennas for aerials.\n\nanthrax\n\nis a bacterium, not a virus.\n\nanticipate\n\nis not synonymous with \"expect\". It means to take action, because of something you expect to happen eg The goalkeeper anticipated the shot by coming off his line.\n\nantisemitism\n\nie lowercase, no hyphen\n\nany more\n\nIs our preferred version, rather than anymore.\n\napostrophes\n\nindicate either possession (eg: the children's nanny, the emperor's new clothes, journalists' pay) or the omission of one or more letters (eg: It's a lovely day today; Life's a bitch; Who's been sleeping in my bed?)\n\nThere is no apostrophe in the possessive \"its\" (eg: Virtue is its own reward).\n\nSome common abbreviations do not require apostrophes (eg: phone, plane, flu).\n\nDates do not require apostrophes (eg: 1900s) - unless the century is omitted (eg: the England squad of '66).\n\nNeither are apostrophes generally needed for plurals (eg: MPs, MBEs), but they are for the pluralisation of letters of the alphabet (eg: Our task now is to dot the i's and cross the t's).\n\nFor names, use the possessive 's whenever possible - eg: Burns's, Jonesâs, Charles's, James's, Dickens's, Phillips's. But be guided by how the last syllable of the name is pronounced - eg: Jesus', Bridges', Moses', Hodges', Griffiths', Walters' - also Wales'.\n\nThere should be an apostrophe before the word \"time\" in sentences such as The game will be played in two weeks' time or They stop work in one hour's time.\n\nThe bank (Lloyds) has no apostrophe, but the insurance underwriter and the register of shipping (Lloyd's) does.\n\nLord's cricket ground has an apostrophe before the \"s\".Sadler's Wells theatre in London has an apostrophe before the \"s\".\n\nThe football ground in Newcastle is St James' Park and in Exeter it is St James Park. The open space in London is St James's Park (also St James's Palace).\n\nQueen's College in Oxford has an apostrophe before the \"s\". Queens' College in Cambridge has it after.\n\nEarls Court has no apostrophe for either the building or the area. (The confusing reality is that the building has never had an apostrophe - while the area is likewise written without one by the Ordnance Survey, but with one by both London Transport and the local council.)\n\nThe church in Langham Place, London - All Souls' - has an apostrophe. The college in Oxford is All Souls.\n\nappraise/apprise\n\nYou \"appraise\" something when you put a value on it. You \"apprise\" someone of something when you inform them about it.\n\nArabic names (updated November 2023)\n\nNames beginning with al- such as Bashar al-Assad lose the prefix on second mention - ie Mr Assad. If it's a place name, no need for the al- at all.\n\nIn Arabic \"al\" is the definite article, so avoid preceding it with \"the\" in English, and use lower case, with hyphen.\n\nDo not use an apostrophe in an Arabic name. Examples: Baath, Shia.\n\nFor the founder of Islam, our style is the Prophet Muhammad. Second reference: Muhammad or the Prophet. For the spelling of individual Muslims named after him: there is no simple rule, because the spelling (Muhammad/Mohamed/Mohammad) varies from country to country. But in the Arab world, where Arabic script rules, we should standardise the name as Muhammad.\n\nBin or bin: Osama Bin Laden has a capital \"B\" because the Bin Laden is in this case a family name. Bin can also mean \"son of\". In such cases we should write Abdullah bin Hussein ie with lower-case \"b\".\n\nAbu: means \"father of\". We do not follow the practice of some news agencies in using a hyphen - eg: \"Abu-Mazen\".\n\nSome common men's names:\n\nAhmad\n\nAli\n\nAbdullah\n\nIbrahim\n\nMahmoud\n\nYasser\n\nYousef\n\nOur preferred spelling of cities/towns often in the news:\n\nAmara\n\nBaghdad - (not Bagdad)\n\nBaquba\n\nBasra\n\nDahuk\n\nDiwaniya\n\nEast Jerusalem (Avoid the phrase âArab East Jerusalemâ, unless you also have space to explain that Israel has annexed the area and claims it as part of its capital.)\n\nFalluja\n\nHilla\n\nIrbil\n\nKarbala\n\nKhan Younis\n\nMedina\n\nMosul\n\nNad Ali\n\nQalqilya\n\nRafah\n\nSharm el-Sheikh\n\nSulaymaniyah\n\nTehran (not Teheran)\n\nTulkarm\n\nAran/Arran\n\nAran sweaters are traditionally associated with the Aran Islands, off the west coast of Ireland. They have nothing to do with the Isle of Arran in the Firth of Clyde.\n\nArchbishops/archbishops\n\nCapitals are always used with the full title, here or abroad (eg Archbishop of Canterbury, Archbishop of York, Archbishop of Cape Town), whether or not it is accompanied by the name of the incumbent. If the place name is not used at second reference, you can write simply the archbishop.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury is the Primate of All England\n\nThe Archbishop of York is the Primate of England\n\nThe Archbishop of Armagh is the Primate of All Ireland\n\nThe Archbishop of Dublin is the Primate of Ireland\n\nThe Archbishop of Westminster can be referred to as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales.\n\narea\n\nAdjectival phrases defining an area should include hyphens in both metric and imperial measures. Always mention both; the context will determine which comes first: eg The French fishermen denied reports that they had been operating inside the X-sq-km (Y-sq-mile) zone (note: there is no \"s\" on nouns used adjectivally). Elsewhere, there is no need for hyphens eg The UK government is calling for a ban on fishing within a zone of X sq miles (Y sq km).\n\nAbbreviations should be used throughout, even at first reference. Never write \"square kilometres\", but always sq km. There is no acceptable abbreviation for \"miles\", so write sq miles (and, adjectivally, sq-mile). Note that the abbreviation km should never have an \"s\".\n\nArgentina\n\nand not \"The Argentine\". Its people are Argentines (not \"Argentinians\"). The adjective is also Argentine.\n\nArmy/army\n\nThe correct title for the UK army is simply the Army (ie initial cap). But if there is a need to distinguish it from other armies it should be lower case - eg: The government is asking the Army to help fight foot-and-mouth disease, but The British army is taking supplies to the earthquake zone.\n\nLower case, also, if you are using it adjectivally - eg: Rain has thwarted army efforts to deliver food.\n\nNote that armed forces is lower case.\n\nForeign armies generally take lower case, but the US Army is the correct title and so takes cap \"A\".\n\nRanks\n\nMost army ranks can and should be abbreviated even at first reference - see list below. Listed separately are those abbreviations to be used only at second reference - after the rank has been spelt out in full at first mention. A third category lists those ranks that we do not abbreviate, even at second reference. But ranks should be spelt out in full (lower case) when they are used without reference to a specific name - eg: The major general attended the meeting.\n\nAbbreviations which can be used at first reference:\n\nIf knighted, military figures would be Gen Sir Arthur Whitehead, then Gen Whitehead. If made a peer, they would just be Lord Whitehead.\n\nGeneral - Gen\n\nLieutenant General - Lt Gen (later, just Gen)\n\nMajor General - Maj Gen (later, just Gen)\n\nBrigadier - Brig\n\nBrigadier General - Brig Gen (later, just Gen) - this is no longer a rank in the British army\n\nColonel - Col\n\nLieutenant Colonel - Lt Col (later, just Col)\n\nMajor - Maj\n\nCaptain - Capt\n\nLieutenant - Lt\n\n2nd Lieutenant - 2nd Lt\n\nStaff Sergeant - Staff Sgt\n\nColour Sergeant - Colour Sgt\n\nSergeant - Sgt (Serjeant - Sjt if a member of The Rifles)\n\nCorporal - Cpl\n\nLance Corporal - L/Cpl\n\nPrivate - Pte\n\nRegimental Sergeant Major - RSM\n\nWarrant Officer - WO\n\nL/Cpl of Horse - L/CoH\n\nField Marshal\n\nBombardier\n\nCorps\n\nBoth the US and UK armies are divided into corps - which should be capped up when you are giving a name - eg: The Royal Corps of Signals. Any preceding number should be expressed as a Roman numeral - eg: III Corps. A corps is led by a lieutenant general - written as Lt Gen at first reference when accompanied by the name. If the full title is Lt Gen Sir John Smith, then the correct form at second reference is Gen Smith.\n\nDivisions\n\nArmy corps are divided into divisions. Capped up when you are giving a name - eg: 1st Armoured Division; lower case if the reference is non-specific - eg: Two divisions of troops will take control of the area. A division is under the command of a major general (which you would spell out only if there is no name attached - eg: A division is led by a major general. As a rank, the title is written Maj Gen, even at first reference.\n\nRegiments/Brigades\n\nDivisions are commonly divided into regiments or brigades. Lower case if the reference is non-specific; capped up when you are giving a name - eg: The Household Cavalry Regiment; The Parachute Regiment; 7th Armoured Brigade; 101st Logistics Brigade. A preceding ordinal number is not expressed as a word.\n\nBattalions\n\nRegiments are divided into battalions. The third battalion of the Parachute Regiment is best written as 3 Para - ie contrary to our usual rule, the cardinal number is expressed as a digit, whatever it is (the form \"3rd Bn\" should be avoided, given that we sometimes abbreviate \"billion\" to \"bn\"). The officer commanding a battalion is a lieutenant colonel: Lt Col when accompanied by a name (Col at second reference), but spelt out when no name is attached.\n\nSmall units\n\nThe correct terms with reference to tanks and armour are regiment/ squadron/ troop with reference to the Infantry, they are battalion/ company/ platoon/ section; and with reference of the Artillery, they are regiment/ battery/ troop/ section.\n\nA troop is a group of soldiers, normally about 30. Do not refer to individuals as troops - to say: \"Five troops have been killed in Afghanistan\" would be wrong. But you can use the term in a generic sense eg: The UK has sent more troops to Helmand province.\n\nart movements\n\nIn general, these should be lower case except where it's a wider cultural movement, as in Renaissance or Romanticism; named after a person or place - Bauhaus and pre-Raphaelite; or there might be confusion with another usage, as in Arts and Crafts.\n\narrest/detain\n\nare not synonymous. The word \"arrest\" is a legal term, where someone has formally been taken into custody - usually the first step towards being charged. \"Detain\" can often mean little more than remove from the streets (and release some time later). Sometimes, it is more appropriate to say held or questioned.\n\naround\n\nDo not use to mean \"approximately\" - the best substitute is usually about.\n\nIs not synonymous with \"round\" - eg: It may drive you round the bend if you work around the clock.\n\nAsbo\n\nie follows our usual rule of upper and lower case for pronounced acronyms. It stands for Anti-social Behaviour Order.\n\nAshkenazi\n\n(Jewish people of European descent) ie with upper case \"A\".\n\nassassinate\n\nUse only for killings with a political or religious motive.\n\nAssembly\n\nPolitical assemblies are lower case (the Stormont assembly), except where the full title is given (eg: the Northern Ireland Assembly). Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly are MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly).\n\nOn 6 May 2020, the institution formerly called the National Assembly for Wales officially became the Welsh Parliament (in Welsh, Senedd Cymru).\n\nassisted suicide\n\nBe careful to ensure this is really what you mean - ie \"encouraging or assisting the suicide of another\", as the revised Suicide Act of 1961 has it. This is not the same thing as killing someone who cannot do it for themselves. It is also different to doctor-assisted suicide, where someone needs or requests the intervention of a doctor in order to take their own life.\n\nasteroid\n\nis a large space rock (probably more than 100m across - smaller ones are called meteoroids). The light phenomenon when an asteroid (or meteoroid) enters the Earth's atmosphere is called a meteor. The lump of rock that hits the Earth's surface is called a meteorite.\n\nasylum seeker\n\nie no hyphen. Be aware that asylum seekers are only one category of migrant. Never refer to \"bogus asylum seekers\" unless you are quoting someone.\n\nat-a-glance\n\nhyphenated when used to headline a summary of key points (eg: Budget at-a-glance), with initial upper case if you choose to introduce it with a colon (eg: Queen's Speech: At-a-glance). Hyphenated, too, if used adjectivally (eg: An at-a-glance guide to the United Nations). In an ordinary news story, drop the hyphens (eg: He told the court he had taken in the murder scene at a glance).\n\nathletics\n\nThe first reference to a time should spell it out in full, following our usual convention with numbers below 10 eg: one hour two minutes 23.34 seconds (ie no commas between the units). After that, switch to a more compact style (eg: 1:03:25.67).\n\nOur numbers convention is ignored in events where times below 10 seconds are regularly achieved, such as the 100m. In such cases: all numbers are written as digits, and the word \"seconds\" need not be used throughout. Eg: X took gold with a time of 9.93 seconds. In second place was Y, on 9.94. And the bronze medal went to Z, on 9.96.\n\nNote that portions of seconds are expressed as decimals, rather than being written out as fractions. But you can refer to \"hundredths\" in the context of times of under a second - eg: They were separated by three hundredths of a second (and not \"0.03 seconds\").\n\nATM\n\nmeans automated teller machine - mainly a US term. It is acceptable only in headlines or direct quotes. Otherwise, use cash machine (but not \"cash point\" which is a trademark). Hole in the wall is also a trademark and should be used only in connection with Barclays machines.\n\nattorney\n\nis most commonly a US term. Substitute lawyer - or if you want to be more specific in the UK, barrister or solicitor.\n\nAttorney General/attorney general\n\nie (both here and in the US) no hyphen. Capped up if the name of the individual follows. Lower case without the name.\n\naudience\n\nStrictly, one has \"an audience of the King\", which most people will think is a typo. To avoid the problem, say eg: The prime minister went to see the King.\n\nAung San Suu Kyi\n\nThe name is always spelt out in full in her own language, as any abbreviation would be regarded as impolite. We should generally spell out her name in full, but can follow the common practice of using \"Suu Kyi\" for headlines and \"Ms Suu Kyi\" in text where this is required for space reasons.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand\n\nIf you want to use the term, our style is down under: ie two words, both lower case.\n\nAustralian Labor Party\n\nie we use its own spelling, without a \"u\".\n\nautism\n\n\"a person is autisticâ is preferred to âa person has autismâ. We do not say âsuffers from autismâ. If referring to specific individuals, where possible and appropriate reflect how they self-identify.\n\nawards\n\nCBE, OBE and MBE stand for Commander, Officer and Member of the Order of the British Empire. So people do not \"get\" an MBE etc: they are appointed, or they can become a CBE etc. Medals such as the British Empire Medal and George Medal are conferred. A person can be made a peer, a baronet or a knight.\n\nAyatollah\n\n(highest Shia religious authority) ie upper case \"A\" if used with name, and retain as title on subsequent references - eg: the ayatollah.\n\nAyman al-Zawahiri\n\n(Leader of al-Qaeda, who died in July 2022). He is Zawahiri (no \"Mr\") at second reference and in headlines.\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nFormer Soviet republic, now independent. The inhabitants are Azerbaijanis - many of whom, but not all, are Azeris.\n\nB\n\nBA\n\n(for British Airways) ie both caps. It should be used only after a first reference where the title is given in full. The same abbreviation is used for Bachelor of Arts.\n\nBaa-Baas\n\n(rugby union) ie two words, both capped, hyphenated, no apostrophe. Acceptable abbreviation - but only after a first reference has spelled out The Barbarians.\n\nBaath\n\n(ruling party in Syria - and formerly in the late Saddam Hussein's Iraq) ie without an internal apostrophe.\n\nbabies/toddlers\n\nA child up to 12 months can be described as a baby. A toddler is generally aged one or two.\n\nbackbench\n\nie one word (eg backbench unrest, backbencher). But two words for back benches.\n\nbacteria\n\nis a plural - the singular is bacterium. They cause food poisoning, cholera, typhoid etc, and may be treated with antibiotics. Not to be confused with viruses, which are smaller organisms - not susceptible to antibiotics - which cause influenza, measles, mumps, chicken pox, Aids etc.\n\nbad news\n\nis, like \"good news\", a term never to be used unqualified, because it is subjective. A rise in interest rates is bad news for housebuyers, but good news for savers. Just say what has happened - and let the punters decide.\n\nBAE Systems\n\nAnd not \"BAe\" (it is the former British Aerospace).\n\nbail/bale\n\nUse bail for the temporary release of someone awaiting trial. To bail out is to help a company or person with financial problems (noun: bailout). Use bale out for removing water from a boat, or jumping out of a plane.\n\nbalance of payments\n\nis not the same as the trade balance, which involves only visible imports and exports. The balance of payments includes so-called invisibles: earnings from the City, international insurance, tourism etc.\n\nBank holiday\n\nie lower case, unless a specific one (eg: the Spring Bank Holiday). Note that some bank holidays do not apply across the whole of the UK.\n\nBank of England\n\nShould be spelled out at first reference, but can be trimmed later to BoE. NB: interest rates are set by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (which can be abbreviated at second reference to MPC).\n\nbankruptcy\n\nA UK company should never be described as \"going bankrupt\" since, under UK law, this can only happen to individuals (who file a petition for bankruptcy). The technical situation for a company in financial crisis is that it faces the possibility of a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), administration, receivership or winding-up. Use the proper technical description in the top four pars (eg: Smith Scaffolding has gone into administration). Elsewhere, it is acceptable to say simply that a company has collapsed or gone bust.\n\nOutside the UK, the term bankruptcy can be valid. In the US, for example, companies can go bankrupt or enter bankruptcy protection. The best-known form of bankruptcy protection is called \"Chapter 11\", which allows a company to continue to operate while all claims from debtors or the company are put on hold. If using the term, explain what Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection means.\n\nBar, the\n\n(barristers) ie with capital \"B\".\n\nBarclays Bank\n\nie no apostrophe.\n\nBasel\n\n(city in Switzerland) ie not \"Basle\". Our style conforms to the rules on banking supervision and the football team.\n\nBBC\n\nSay the BBC in references to the organisation that makes announcements, decisions and programmes (eg The BBC is to devote more money to sports coverage). For news-related items, say eg BBC News understands that... or Our correspondent has learned... For news online, say the BBC News website (ie website, lower case).\n\nDo not start your first sentence with \"The BBC...\" The aim should be to convey the news - not to wave the BBC flag. Always check BBC quotes from other sources with the BBC press office.\n\nBBC networks\n\nStick with the official titles for BBC networks, even when this involves extra characters.\n\nFor the TV networks, say: BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, CBeebies, CBBC, BBC News channel, BBC World News, BBC Parliament.\n\nWrite BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4, BBC Radio 4 Extra, BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 5 Live sports extra.\n\nThe word \"Radio\" does not feature in either BBC 6 Music or 1Xtra - which is also without a \"BBC\" label. Elsewhere: BBC Asian Network, BBC World Service.\n\nNote that some BBC local radio stations do not have the word \"Radio\" in their title (eg BBC Essex).\n\nNon-BBC TV channels include Sky One, ITV, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4 and Channel 4.\n\nChannel 5, which for a time was known as Five, has reverted to its original name.\n\nBC\n\n(before Christ) ie unpunctuated. It goes after the year - eg: 100BC, with no gap. Avoid BCE (Before Common Era) unless justified by a particular historical, religious or academic context.\n\nbeg the question\n\nOften misused. The dictionary definition is \"to assume in an argument the truth of something which is part of what is to be proved\". Best avoided.\n\nBelarus\n\nformerly part of the Soviet Union as Byelorussia; now independent. Adjective, Belarusian.\n\nBenelux\n\ncomprises Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.\n\nbest-seller, best-selling\n\nie with hyphens.\n\nbetween\n\nis correctly used when only two parties are involved (eg: talks between Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn). If there are more than two parties, use \"among\" (eg: talks among cabinet ministers).\n\nBeverley/Beverly Hills\n\nThe town in Yorkshire is Beverley with an \"e\" before the \"y\". There is no third \"e\" in California's Beverly Hills.\n\nbiannual/biennial\n\nThese are often confused: biannual means twice a year; biennial means every two years. (Plants that complete their lifecycle in two years are biennials.) Best to avoid both.\n\nBible/bible\n\nThe original gets an initial cap. Otherwise, lower case (eg: The footballer's bible).\n\nbid\n\nMay serve as substitute for \"attempt\", but should primarily be used to mean \"financial bid\", as in auctions, company takeovers and the football transfer market - as well as campaigns to stage the Olympics, and similar events.\n\nBig Society\n\nOur style is to cap up this government initiative - no quote marks.\n\nBill/bill\n\nIn a parliamentary context, use caps for the full title (eg: the Health Bill). Otherwise, lower case (eg: Pressure is growing for a new education bill).\n\nbillion\n\nSpell the word out, except in headlines, or when using it with currencies (eg: Â£3bn).\n\nBin Laden\n\nFormer al-Qaeda leader who died in 2011. Always with a capital \"B\". At first mention, Osama Bin Laden. Afterwards, Bin Laden (never Mr). He was Saudi-born, but was not \"a Saudi citizen\", as he was stripped of his citizenship.\n\nBiro\n\nDo not use generically - it is a trademark. Say: ballpoint pen.\n\nBishops\n\nBishops (both Anglican and Roman Catholic) are consecrated (whereas priests are ordained, and deacons made). At first reference, say eg The Bishop of St Albans, the Right Reverend John Smith or, if he has a doctorate, The Bishop of St Albans, Dr John Smith. Afterwards, Bishop Smith or Dr Smith. If in doubt, check in Crockford's Clerical Directory for Anglicans; via the diocesan website; or the Catholic Media Office for Roman Catholics.\n\nbits/bytes\n\nThere are eight bits in a byte. Historically, memory (hard drives, file sizes etc) is measured in bytes - kilobytes (kB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), terabytes (TB). However, data rates/speeds or capacities of fibres and networks are quoted in bits (megabits per second, Mbps) eg: Bloggsnet is offering broadband at 20Mbps and a contract comes with a free 16GB USB stick.\n\nblack box\n\nAlthough they tend to be orange, flight recorders are widely known and described as \"black boxes\". But we should clarify what it is at first reference - Divers are searching for the \"black box\" flight recorder - and use quotes in headlines. Be aware there are two recorders â a flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder â that may be together or in separate containers.\n\nblack, in the\n\nAvoid this phrase. It means \"in profit\" for a UK audience, but exactly the opposite for some other English speakers.\n\nblast\n\nShould not be used in sentences such as: \"The prime minister has blasted his own supporters.\" Say: criticised or condemned.\n\nblind\n\nWrite about blind people - not \"the blind\".\n\nblond/blonde\n\nUse blond of a man, and blonde of a woman.\n\nBoat Race, the\n\nie initial caps.\n\nbomb warning/hoax\n\nShould not normally be reported - unless there is a strong news angle (eg: significant disruption).\n\nbook titles\n\nUse initial caps, with short \"link\" words in lower case: eg: Far from the Madding Crowd. No italics or quotation marks.\n\nBoots\n\n(the chemists) ie no apostrophe.\n\nBosnia-Herzegovina\n\nFormerly part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Bosnia-Herzegovina emerged in its present form after the end of the Bosnian war in 1995. Spell it with a hyphen (rather than the official title, which is \"Bosnia and Herzegovina\") and with a \"z\" in Herzegovina rather than a \"c\".\n\nCitizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be referred to as Bosnians, unless their ethnicity or religion is of particular relevance.\n\nThe Dayton accords formalised the division of the country into two parts - the Bosnian Serb republic (Republika Srpska) and the Bosniak-Croat Federation. Most Bosniaks are Muslims.\n\nWhen referring to these groups separately, they should be called Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims).\n\nIn stories specifically about Bosniaks, it may be useful to include this line of background: \"The Bosniak people, most of whom are Muslims, are descended from Bosnian Slavs who adopted Islam under Ottoman Turkish rule in the Middle Ages.\"\n\nIt is wrong to call the Bosnian conflict a \"civil\" war, because neighbouring countries were involved. Stick to \"war\" or \"conflict\".\n\nbottom line\n\nis a clichÃ©. Do not use it unless you are quoting someone, or referring literally to the bottom line of a company balance sheet.\n\nbourse\n\nis a French word, favoured by some agencies. Use the English: stock market or stock exchange.\n\nbrackets, square\n\nUse these, not round brackets, for interpolations within quotes: eg: Reacting to the news, Mr Smith said: \"He [President Brown] must not back down.\"\n\nBrands Hatch\n\nie it has no apostrophe.\n\nBrexit\n\nItâs Brexit, with an initial cap. When referring back to the referendum, it was the Leave and Remain campaigns (initial caps, no quotation marks). The deal struck between the UK government and the European Union is the withdrawal agreement (lower case) and the outline statement on how both sides wish to get along is the political declaration (lower case). Likewise, itâs the backstop plan and the transition period. No-deal is only hyphenated when used adjectivally, eg âWhat does a no-deal Brexit actually mean?â, otherwise not, eg âCleverly says no deal better than no Brexitâ.\n\nIn line with our style guide ruling on parliamentary bills, itâs the Withdrawal Agreement Bill at first mention, the bill at second reference. The acronym Wab and the initialism WAB should be avoided and in direct quotes replaced with [Withdrawal Agreement Bill] at first mention and [bill] at second reference.\n\nSimilarly, in line with our style guide ruling on acts of parliament, itâs the Fixed-term Parliaments Act at first mention, the act at second reference.\n\nItâs Brexit, with an initial cap. When referring back to the referendum, it was the Leave and Remain campaigns (initial caps, no quotation marks). But lower case and quotes when talking about âleaversâ and âremainersâ. The deal struck between the UK government and the European Union is the withdrawal agreement (lower case) and the outline statement on how both sides wish to get along is the political declaration (lower case). Likewise, itâs the backstop plan and the transition period.\n\nBritain\n\n(aka Great Britain) is made up of England, Scotland and Wales; the United Kingdom also includes Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. However, it is a term that can be frowned on in Ireland, so if using it ensure it is employed correctly.\n\nBritish law\n\nThere is no such thing. England and Wales have a separate legal system from Scotland. Northern Ireland's system is similar to England and Wales.\n\nBSE\n\nIt stands for bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The alternative, mad cow disease, should be in quotation marks at first reference.\n\nBTec\n\n(a vocational qualification, available at various levels, from the equivalent of GCSEs to professional diplomas.) ie with both the \"B\" and the \"T\" capped up. Plural is BTecs.\n\nBudget/budget\n\nUse an initial cap for the Westminster extravaganza. Otherwise, lower case (Mr Brown's Budget; Mr Brown's pre-Budget report; the Australian budget).\n\nbullet points\n\nIf, for example, someone has three objections to a pay deal, then use bullet points to summarise them, and then explain in more detail. They are easier to read on screen than dense paragraphs of text.\n\nIf the items in a bullet point list are complete sentences in themselves, then each should start with a capital letter, and in general end with no punctuation: eg:\n\nThere is more than one way to cook potatoes.\n\nYou can roast them in the oven\n\nYou can mash them with milk and butter\n\nYou can fry them in a pan\n\nIf the items are not complete sentences, they should start with a lower case letter, and again omit punctuation at the end: eg:\n\nIf you want to cook potatoes, you can\n\nroast them in the oven\n\nmash them with milk and butter\n\nfry them in a pan\n\nSingle-word lists of nouns should also start with a lower case letter: eg:\n\nTeachers think they are getting a raw deal in three areas:\n\npay\n\nhours\n\npensions\n\nThe exception on punctuation is that we do include a question mark after each item if that is what logic would suggest: eg:\n\nIs the first thing you think about in the morning\n\nyour headache?\n\nyour shower?\n\nyour breakfast?\n\nThis is also true with complete sentence lists. Eg:\n\nThere are three questions you should ask yourself each morning:\n\nWhy am I here?\n\nWho is this person?\n\nWhere are my clothes?\n\nbullseye\n\nie no apostrophe.\n\nBundestag\n\nie initial cap. We should make clear at first reference it is the lower house of the German parliament. Elections for the Bundestag are held every four years.\n\nburka\n\nis our favoured spelling for this form of Islamic veil, which covers the entire face and body.\n\nBurma\n\nWe should use Myanmar rather than Burma in headlines and summaries. Inside the body of our stories, preferably on first mention, we should include the wording \"Myanmar, formerly known as Burma\". Further references should be to Myanmar. We should talk about the main commercial city as \"Yangon, also known as Rangoon\", and thereafter Yangon. The name of the capital is Nay Pyi Taw.\n\nbusinessmen\n\nUse only if they really are all men. Otherwise, say business people, a business audience, business executives etc.\n\nby-election\n\nie no \"e\" - and with a hyphen.\n\nby-law\n\nie no \"e\" - and with a hyphen.\n\nbylines\n\nThe tag in the CPS production system will enable you to provide:\n\na) a first line beginning By (capped) and then giving the person's name.\n\nb) a second line giving further information\n\nExamples:\n\nBy Zoe McGuire\n\nBBC News, Birmingham\n\nBy Jonathan Garrod\n\nBBC Stories\n\nBy Paula Harris\n\nBBC News\n\nSpecialist non-correspondents should be called reporter, not \"staff\" or \"writer\" etc (initial cap, then lower case) eg:\n\nBy Kevin Robertson\n\nPolitical reporter, BBC News\n\nBy Christine Peters\n\nHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nRefer to specialist BBC correspondents and editors as follows:\n\nBy Peter Bywater\n\nPolitical editor, BBC News\n\nBy Jane McGuire\n\nBusiness editor, BBC News\n\nBy Mark Morgan\n\nTransport correspondent, BBC News\n\nWe should refer to (non-specialist) overseas BBC correspondents as belonging to \"BBC News\" and give their location. So examples would be:\n\nBy Simon Hargreaves\n\nBBC News, Beirut\n\nBy Peter James\n\nBBC News, Washington\n\nBy Melanie Buford\n\nBBC News, Brussels\n\nPieces of original journalism by non-staff should normally follow a similar pattern: ie the first line of a byline should consist of the name only eg:\n\nBy Niall Ferguson\n\nIf relevant, a job description or a location can be added as a second line eg:\n\nBy Nicola Horlick\n\nInvestment fund manager\n\nHowever, it will sometimes be preferable with high-profile outside contributors to give further information not as a second line but as a more detailed standfirst, in bold eg: Nicola Horlick has run a number of successful investment funds and earned the nickname Superwoman for having a high-flying career and bringing up five children. If the expert has a rather lower profile, stick with the one-line job description at the top, and add a longer note at the end of the story. This should be written in italics (not bold).\n\nWe do not use correspondents' bylines with on-demand video and audio pages. The convention is to go with BBC News as a label; Sport, where appropriate, say BBC Sport.\n\nbypass\n\nie no \"e\" - and no hyphen.\n\nC\n\ncabinet\n\n(grouping of senior ministers) ie lower case.\n\nCabinet Office\n\nie initial caps. Its ministers report directly to the prime minister.\n\nCac 40\n\n(the main stock exchange index in Paris) ie initial cap and a space before the number.\n\nCaesarean\n\nie upper case (and not \"Caesarian\").\n\nCalcutta\n\nOur style is to use Kolkata for the Indian city.\n\nThe England-Scotland rugby trophy is the Calcutta Cup.\n\nCamorra\n\nNaples-based mafia, separate from Sicilian-based Cosa Nostra. When talking about the Camorra, or any other mafia outside Sicily, we use lower case \"m\" on mafia.\n\ncapital cities\n\nTake care; not every capital city is the obvious one:\n\nAustralia - Canberra, not Sydney or Melbourne.\n\nBrazil - Brasilia, not Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIvory Coast - Yamoussoukro, not Abidjan.\n\nMyanmar (Burma) - Nay Pyi Taw, not Yangon (Rangoon)\n\nThe Netherlands - Amsterdam, not The Hague (which is the seat of government).\n\nNigeria - Abuja, not Lagos.\n\nSouth Africa - Pretoria, not Cape Town (where parliament sits).\n\nSwitzerland - Bern, not Geneva.\n\nTanzania - Dodoma, not Dar es Salaam.\n\nDo not say eg: \"The Pope has arrived in the Syrian capital of Damascus.\" Drop the \"of\" - and substitute a comma.\n\ncapitalisation\n\nA few titles are always capped up, whether you name the person or not (eg the King, the Pope, Archbishop of XX). But our style generally is to minimise the use of capital letters.\n\nPolitical job titles have initial caps only when the title is next to the name, in whatever order. Thus:\n\nThe Foreign Secretary, Harold Thomas, said...\n\nUS President James Tucker\n\nMrs Gordon, who has been prime minister since 2015...\n\nAny post mentioned without reference to the post-holder should be in lower case - e.g.\n\nThe prime minister will be out of the country for several days.\n\nThe same rule applies for former holders of political office (eg The former President, James Tucker, is to make a political comeback. The former president said he wanted to spend less time with his family).\n\nSimilarly, Leader of the Opposition is capped up only if accompanied by the name. Other opposition portfolios are always lower case, with or without the name (eg The shadow chancellor, Brian Banker, was furious. There was jeering when the shadow chancellor left).\n\nAlso, see âjob titlesâ entry.\n\nAlso use lower case for all jobs outside politics, with or without a name (eg the director general of the BBC, Michael Graves, has praised the England cricket captain), except that police and military titles accompanied by the name are always capped up (eg Sgt Wilson is to receive an award for bravery). The UN secretary general is capped when with a name; the director of public prosecutions is always lower case.\n\nGovernments are not capped up (eg The Italian government has resigned).\n\nUse initial cap Parliament with reference only to (a) Westminster in any context, and (b) the Scottish, Welsh and European Parliaments where you are giving the full title. Otherwise, lower case (eg Mrs Gordon will face questions in Parliament; There is to be an emergency session of the Scottish Parliament; But: The parliament in Edinburgh is to be recalled for an emergency session; They say they will halt proceedings of parliament in Strasbourg; The Dutch parliament sits in The Hague). The adjective parliamentary should always be lower case, unless it is part of a proper name.\n\nSimilarly, assembly is capped only with the full title (eg: The Northern Ireland Assembly is to sit for the first time this year; The problems facing farmers will be discussed by the Stormont assembly).\n\nIn general, government schemes and initiatives are capped â Northern Powerhouse, Big Society, National Minimum Wage â while benefits are lower case, such as universal credit and personal independence payment.\n\nFor place names: use upper case for recognised regions, and for vaguer political/geographical areas (eg the Middle East, Western Europe). Otherwise, lower case (south-west France, east Lancashire). Also lower case for south Wales, north Wales, mid-Wales etc.\n\nFor Latin names of plants, animals etc, use italics and cap the first word only (eg Corvus corone).\n\ncaptions (for pictures)\n\nPicture captions in news stories should be no longer than two lines, or one line for large pictures. There is no full stop at the end of a caption, other than in picture galleries. A caption is usually unnecessary with a map or a generic graphic.\n\nThe wording of the caption should follow the geography of the picture, from left to right (eg if Smith is on the left and Jones on the right, the caption should not say \"Jones and Smith\"). Use full names whenever possible.\n\nA caption should be more than a literal description of the picture; it should add value (eg: George Smith and Terry Jones: Long-time friends).\n\nFor direct quotes, use a colon and double quotation marks (eg: George Smith: âIâm lucky to be aliveâ). Any colon in a caption, whether or not introducing a quote, must be followed by a capital letter (eg: George Smith: A lucky man).\n\nTo focus on one individual among several, use brackets rather than commas (eg: Terry Jones (centre) was among friends). If space is very short, you can abbreviate such labels to their initial letter only, capped up, ie (C) (L) or (R).\n\ncardiac arrest/heart attack\n\nThese are not synonymous. Cardiac arrest is when the heart suddenly stops beating. A heart attack is when the blood flow to the heart is interrupted (otherwise known as a myocardial infarction). A heart attack can cause cardiac arrest.\n\ncarjack/carjacking\n\none word, no hyphen.\n\nCatholic/catholic\n\nThere is a glossary of terms here.\n\nDo not automatically equate \"Catholic\" with \"Roman Catholic\". There are Catholics who are Anglicans or members of other denominations not in communion with the See of Rome.\n\nAlways \"Catholic\", ie with initial cap, in the religious context.\n\nLower case in the sense of \"catholic taste\", or similar.\n\ncatseye\n\nis acceptable in a generic sense, even though it is a trademark.\n\nCBI\n\nThe original title (Confederation of British Industry) is obsolete, as the word \"industry\" no longer reflects its membership. It calls itself simply the CBI. It may be described as the employersâ organisation or business lobby group.\n\nCBC/CBS\n\nThe initials CBC (all caps, no gaps) stand for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Not to be confused with US television network CBS (again, all caps, no gaps).\n\nCCTV\n\n(closed-circuit television) ie all caps\n\nC. difficile\n\nOur preference for Clostridium difficile - capital \"C\" with a full stop and a space followed by lower case \"\"â. C. diff is fine at second reference or in headlines.\n\nceasefire\n\n(as a noun) ie one word.\n\ncensor/censure\n\nTo censor something (book, film etc) means to examine it and suppress any part deemed unacceptable. To censure means to express severe disapproval of, or formally reprimand.\n\nCentral Asia\n\nie initial caps.\n\nCentral Europe\n\nie initial caps. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are correctly referred to as being in Central Europe.\n\ncentre\n\nCorrect usage is to centre on - and not \"to centre around\".\n\nAvoid the US spelling (\"center\") - unless it is part of an official title (eg the World Trade Center). Second references not actually repeating the title should use UK spelling, but itâs preferable to avoid using both spellings in the same story.\n\ncentre-back, centre-half, centre-forward\n\nie all with hyphens.\n\nCentury/century\n\nUse upper case (and digits) when you are labelling a century with a number (eg: 20th Century). Otherwise, lower case (eg: The treasure had lain undiscovered for centuries).\n\nIf you omit the century from a four-digit date, replace it with an apostrophe (eg: the class of â66).\n\nCFC\n\nie all caps, no gaps (it stands for chlorofluorocarbon).\n\nchair\n\nDo not describe someone as being the \"chair\" of a meeting. Rewrite the sentence to say eg: Mr Jones, in the chair or The meeting, chaired by Mrs Smith. Alternatively, and where appropriate, use chairman or chairwoman.\n\nChallenger 2\n\n(The British armyâs main battle tank) - and not \"Challenger II\".\n\nChampions League\n\n(European football) ie initial caps - and no apostrophe.\n\nChannel Tunnel\n\nie both words capped. At second reference, just the tunnel. But (even in headlines) never \"Chunnel\".\n\ncharge\n\nshould not be used as a synonym for \"allege\" (as in, eg: \"Princess Jane charged that she had been victimised by the media\").\n\ncheap\n\nDo not say \"The arrival of summer brings cheap prices for vegetables.\" Prices cannot be \"cheap\" - the right word here is low. You could, of course, say The arrival of summer brings cheap vegetables.\n\nChechnya\n\nis an autonomous republic within Russia. Adjective, Chechen.\n\ncheese\n\nNames of cheeses should be lower case unless they include a country: The list includes camembert, Canadian cheddar, brie, wensleydale and Danish blue.\n\nChennai\n\nOur style is to use Chennai rather than Madras.\n\nchief rabbi\n\nthe Orthodox chief rabbi of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the spiritual leader of the United Synagogue, the largest umbrella group of Jewish communities in the country - in later references Rabbi Katz.\n\nChildLine\n\nie we follow the charityâs own convention of including a rogue capital in the middle.\n\nchild pornography\n\nSee Sexual offences\n\nChild Trust Fund\n\nis the governmentâs 2003 Budget scheme to provide cash for every newborn child. Do not call it a \"Baby Bond\" - that phrase is a trademark.\n\nChinese names\n\nThe family name comes first - so Hu Jintao becomes Mr Hu at second reference.\n\nchip-and-pin\n\nie hyphenated as an adjective or noun. Note Pin (number) is capped up when on its own.\n\nChogm\n\n(Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting) ie lower case, because it is pronounced as a word. But best avoided.\n\nChristian\n\nie initial cap.\n\nDo not use \"Christian name\" when you mean \"given name\".\n\nChristieâs\n\nie with an apostrophe before the \"s\".\n\nChristmas\n\nSpell in full - do not use \"Xmas\", even for headlines. And remember that not all Christians celebrate Christmas on 25 December. The Eastern Orthodox Churches mark the festival on 7 January.\n\nChurch/church\n\nLower case for the actual buildings; otherwise Church.\n\nNo human being should be referred to as \"Head of the Church\". The King is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The Pope is the Supreme Pontiff, Chief Pastor or leader of the Roman Catholic Church; he should not be referred to as the \"Holy Father\" (unless you are quoting somebody).\n\nChurch of England\n\nis not the only Anglican body in the British Isles. There is also the Church in Wales, as well as the Episcopal Church in Scotland, and the Church of Ireland.\n\nThe governing body of the Church of England is the General Synod.\n\nChurch titles (Anglican)\n\nArchbishops are the Most Reverend, but we usually say eg: the Archbishop of York or Dr South. Later references can be either to the archbishop (lower case) or, again,to Dr South.\n\nBishops are the Right Reverend, or the Rt Rev if space is short eg: The Right Reverend Nigel North is beginning his duties as Bishop of Manchester. Afterwards, eg: Bishop Norton or the bishop.\n\nArchdeacons are the Venerable - or the Ven if space is short. Later references: the archdeacon or, eg: Archdeacon West.\n\nVicars/rectors are eg the Reverend Margaret Simmonds - or the Rev Margaret Simmonds if space is short. After first mention, you can say just Ms/Mrs Simmonds (or Dr Simmonds if she has a doctorate).\n\nSome Anglicans prefer \"Father\" to \"Mr\"; the safe rule is to follow local practice. Under no circumstance should you say \"Reverend Smith\", \"the Reverend Smith\", \"the Reverend Mr Smith\", or just \"the Reverend\".\n\nDeans/provosts are the Very Reverend or the Very Rev. At later reference eg: Dean Johnston.\n\nCanons are eg Canon Dennis Moore. Later Canon Moore or the canon.\n\nChurch titles (RC Church)\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales is headed by the Archbishop of Westminster, initially referred to with full title and name eg: The Archbishop of Westminster, Jeremy Montague. Afterwards: Archbishop Montague or the archbishop.\n\nOther archbishops are eg: the Most Reverend John Jones.\n\nBishops are the Right Reverend, which may be abbreviated to the Rt Rev.\n\nAbbots are eg: Abbot Fred Sales. Later, Abbot Sales or the abbot.\n\nProvosts are eg: Provost John Smith. Later: Provost Smith or the provost.\n\nCanons are eg: Canon Michael Harris. Later: Canon Harris or the canon.\n\nPriests are eg: The Reverend Eric Cook, or Father Eric Cook. At later reference, Father Cook or Fr Cook.\n\nCIS\n\n(Commonwealth of Independent States) ie all caps, no gaps. Provides a framework for military and foreign policy and economic co-operation between various states, including Russia and Ukraine.\n\nCitizens Advice\n\nie initial caps and no apostrophe. Changed its name in 2015 from Citizensâ Advice Bureau.\n\nCity/city\n\nCapped only when used to mean the London financial centre.\n\nCivil Aviation Authority\n\nie initial caps - and all caps, no gaps if abbreviated to CAA.\n\nIts role is to consider and, if necessary, implement any follow-up action arising from air crash investigations by the Department for Transportâs Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB).\n\nCJD\n\nie all caps, no gaps (stands for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). Note that variant CJD should be written out in text, but vCJD is acceptable in a headline.\n\nclaim, to\n\nWe should not use it with expressions of alleged fact (eg: The Russians claim 80 people were killed), because it suggests disbelief. Say is preferable.\n\nBut it is acceptable with expressions of opinion (eg: Mr Smith claimed the government was out of control).\n\nclaim responsibility\n\n(as for bombings) Avoid this expression. Just say eg: The Real IRA says it planted Saturdayâs bomb.\n\nclampdown/to clamp down\n\nie no hyphen in the noun; separate words for the verb.\n\nclash\n\nBeware of devaluing the word through overuse. And take care when using \"clash\" as a verb. To say: \"The protesters clashed with police\" implies the protesters were the instigators - which may not have been the case.\n\nClass A drugs\n\nie with a cap \"C\" and \"A\", \"B\" etc\n\nclear-cut\n\nie hyphenated.\n\ncliches\n\nare to be avoided, as they say, \"like the plague\". Try not to use: \"got under way\"; \"a question mark hangs over\"; \"quiet but tense\"; \"rushed to hospital\"; \"daring escape\"; \"dawn raid\"; \"emotional appeal\"; \"top secret\"; \"psychologically important moment\"; \"moving the goalposts\"; \"level playing field\"; \"bottom line\"; \"only time will tell\" etc.\n\ncloning\n\nDo not use phrases such as \"embryo cloning\" or \"baby cloning\". It is not the baby or the embryo that is being cloned - rather, it is the adult human or the genetic material from an adult that is cloned to produce a baby or embryo.\n\ncoastguard\n\nOur preference is one word, but we should follow names of specific bodies, such as the US Coast Guard.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nie with a hyphen - and both words capped.\n\nCold War\n\nie initial caps.\n\ncollective nouns\n\ndenote groups (eg: group, crew etc). Our policy is that they should take singular verbs as much as possible. Consistency is important. Do not say eg: \"The jury is considering its verdict. They will spend the night in a hotel.\" However, couple and pair can sound odd in the singular so itâs OK to use them as plurals. Family can be either - judge according to context.\n\nSports teams are plural (eg: Manchester United have beaten Liverpool), but clubs are singular (eg: Manchester United has provided another bonus for its shareholders).\n\nThe police are treated as plural (eg: Police say they are looking for three men), but individual forces are singular (eg The Metropolitan Police says there is no need to panic).\n\nPress and public should be treated as singular, but rewording may be advisable (replacing eg: \"The press arrived soon afterwards. It had lots of questions\" with Journalists arrived soon afterwards. They had lots of questions.)\n\nColombia/Columbia\n\nColombia is a country in South America. It is spelt with two \"o\"s. Columbia is the capital of the US state of South Carolina - as well as a District (as in Washington DC), a river, a university (in New York City), a Hollywood studio and a record label. All of these are spelt with a \"u\".\n\ncolons\n\nIn headlines, captions and subheads, they are followed by an initial cap. Elsewhere, by lower case.\n\nColosseum\n\nThe Colosseum is in Rome. The theatres in London, Oldham and elsewhere are the Coliseum.\n\ncommas\n\nUsed properly, commas can eliminate ambiguity and make blocks of text more digestible - especially important when you are converting the spoken word into copy.\n\nBut they can also create unnecessary clutter and may often be avoided, eg by not including a definite article with a title (Foreign Secretary Erica Simmons protested... rather than \"The Foreign Secretary, Erica Simmons, protested...\").\n\nNeither are they needed where you are using a \"job description\" - whether it fits more than one person (eg: Footballer David Jones has been taken to hospital) or one specific individual (eg: England football captain Roy Rover has...).\n\nCommission, Royal\n\nie initial caps - but only once the commission is a reality.\n\nCommons\n\nAlways retain the initial cap in Commons, or House of Commons. (Also in eg: Mr Collins told the House that...)\n\nCommons committees\n\nKeep them lower case, unless you are giving the full title. (eg: The report from the Public Accounts Committee attacked the ministerâs record).\n\nCommunist/communist\n\nUse lower case for the ideology (eg: He was attracted to communism during his university years), and its adherents (eg Most of his fellow-students were communists). Upper case for the name of the party (eg He was determined to join the Communist Party).\n\ncompany names\n\nWe should spell company names as they do themselves, but always use an initial cap (eg: \"easyJet\" is EasyJet). There are occasional exceptions, such as eBay and iPhone â see separate entries. Also, a name using all caps should be rendered in upper and lower case.\n\ncompare to/compare with\n\n\"Compare to\" is a declaration of similarity (He compared the building to a carbuncle); it means \"to liken\". Use âcompare withâ in all other circumstances (The price of petrol has doubled, compared with last year).\n\ncompass points\n\nare not capped up (ie north, south, east, west). Compound nouns (eg: south-west) are usually hyphenated and lower case (eg: He loved France - and the south-west above all). When referring to areas within cities, the compass point is lower case (eg: south London). But avoid ambiguity - say northern England rather than just \"the North\", which would make no sense for someone in Scotland. Only when the geographical context is clear are terms such as the South East, the North West acceptable (ie separate words, capped up). Parts of Wales are always lower case (ie north Wales, south Wales).\n\nUse lower case and hyphens for adjectives eg: south-east wind, a north-westerly direction, north-east England.\n\ncomplement/compliment\n\nThe verb \"to complement\" means to make complete or supply what is lacking. As a noun, it can mean the number required to complete to a company eg: the crew of a ship. Whether as a noun or verb, the word compliment means (to) praise. Complimentary means flattering, or given free.\n\ncomprise\n\nMeans \"to consist of\", \"to be made up of\". So: The editorial team comprises men and women is right. \"Women comprise half the editorial team\" is wrong.\n\nconcede\n\nLosers at elections should properly concede victory. The phrase \"concede defeat\" is wrong. Avoid the problem by using the phrase admit defeat or simply concede (eg: Joe Green conceded soon after the television announcement).\n\nCongo\n\nDo not confuse the two Congos.\n\nCongo-Brazzaville is the former French Congo. We do not generally use its full title, \"the Republic of the Congo\", but it is sometimes acceptable to call it simply Congo (especially in headlines).\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo is the former Belgian Congo. In headlines and at second reference, refer to it as DR Congo. Where appropriate, make clear in the text that DR Congo is the former Zaire, but do not label it \"Congo-Kinshasa\" and do not refer to this country simply as \"Congo\".\n\nConservative/conservative\n\nAlways with an initial cap in a political context. Both words get capped up in Conservative Party. For later references, the Tories is acceptable. It should be lower case when you mean \"averse to change\" or \"conventional\" (eg: Mr Gladstone always wore conservative clothes).\n\nconstabulary\n\nAvoid, when referring to a police force. Even if a police force styles itself as a âconstabularyâ, describe it as (for example) Hampshire Police.\n\nconstitution\n\n(as in the US constitution) ie lower case.\n\nconsult\n\nCorrect usage is eg: The prime minister consulted his colleagues. Do not adopt the American usage of \"consult with\".\n\nConsumer Prices Index/CPI\n\nmeasures the year-on-year change of consumer prices based on a basket of goods and services purchased by most households, but excludes the cost of mortgage interest rates. The CPI is the basis of the Bank of Englandâs official inflation target and is an internationally standardised measure which allows us to compare the UKâs inflation rate with that of other EU countries.\n\nContinent/continent\n\nLower case eg: Aids spread across three continents - unless you mean the European mainland as distinct from the United Kingdom eg: Cars are usually cheaper on the Continent.\n\ncontinual/continuous\n\nThese are not synonyms. Continuous means \"without interruption\". Continual means \"frequently happening\".\n\ncontractions\n\nDo not use contractions such as \"donât\", \"isnât\", \"canât\" in news stories (except in direct quotes). Spell it out: do not, is not, cannot etc.\n\ncops\n\nDo not use as a synonym for police except in the most informal of contexts.\n\nco-ordinate/co-ordination\n\nie hyphenated.\n\nco-operate/co-operation\n\nie hyphenated.\n\ncorrespondents and reporters\n\nThe titles of correspondents and reporters should always be in lower case.\n\nSpecialist BBC correspondents and reporters should be referred to at first mention by their full title (eg BBC News royal correspondent James Higgins, BBC News political editor Martha Squires) and thereafter as our correspondent or our reporter. Overseas BBC correspondents and reporters should be referred to in copy as BBC Newsâs (name) in (place) at first mention, as should non-specialist domestic correspondents, and thereafter as our correspondent or our reporter.\n\n(See separate entry for Bylines).\n\ncosmos\n\nie lower case.\n\nCouncil of Europe\n\nThe Council of Europe is a non-EU institution, based in Strasbourg. It was set up in 1949 to promote European cultural values. Its activities are decided by a committee made up of foreign ministers from each of its 46 member states.\n\nCouncil of Ministers\n\ncreates EU law through negotiation with the European Parliament - a process called âco-decisionâ. In most cases they act on proposals submitted by the European Commission. Consists of the ministers from each member state who have responsibility for the topic under discussion. Not to be confused with the Council of Europe or the European Council.\n\ncouncillor\n\nAlways lower case. Refer to county, borough, town and parish councillors by their usual honorific ie Mr/Mrs/Ms, rather than Coun or Cllr.\n\ncounty names\n\nshould, whenever possible, be written out in full. If space is limited, it is acceptable in some cases to use short forms at first reference and throughout. Acceptable abbreviations are listed here:\n\nBedfordshire - Beds\n\nBuckinghamshire - Bucks\n\nCambridgeshire - Cambs\n\nCheshire - none\n\nCornwall - none\n\nCounty Armagh - Co Armagh\n\nCounty Durham - Durham\n\nCumbria - none\n\nDerbyshire - Derbys\n\nDevon - none\n\nDorset - none\n\nEast Sussex - E Sussex\n\nEssex - none\n\nGloucestershire - Gloucs\n\nHampshire - Hants\n\nHertfordshire - Herts\n\nKent - none\n\nLancashire - Lancs\n\nLeicestershire - Leics\n\nLincolnshire - Lincs\n\nMiddlesex - Middx\n\nNorfolk - none\n\nNorthamptonshire - Northants\n\nNorthumberland - none\n\nNorth Yorkshire - N Yorks\n\nNottinghamshire - Notts\n\nOxfordshire - Oxon\n\nShropshire - Salop\n\nSomerset - none\n\nStaffordshire - Staffs\n\nSuffolk â none\n\nSurrey - none\n\nWarwickshire - Warks\n\nWest Sussex - W Sussex\n\nWiltshire - Wilts\n\nWorcestershire - Worcs\n\nCourt/court\n\nUse initial cap if you are giving the courtâs official title (eg: the US Supreme Court; the European Court of Human Rights; Bow Street Magistratesâ Court) - otherwise (and if in doubt) cap down (the appeal court in Iceland).\n\ncourt cases\n\nIn reporting the preliminaries to a court case, do not include adjectives that might be considered potentially prejudicial (eg \"Man accused of vicious street attack\"). And do not repeat tracts of potential evidence, since a defence lawyer might be planning to challenge it.\n\nIt is BBC policy not to refer to the accused by surname alone - until a guilty verdict is returned. This is true even of people, like sportsmen and women, who would normally be referred to by surname only.\n\nDo not follow agency practice of lumping together the sentences handed down to a group of accused, as in \"The three men were given prison sentences totalling 30 years\". This is so imprecise as to be meaningless.\n\ncourt martial\n\nNote that the plural is courts martial.\n\nCovid-19\n\nThe Covid-19 virus is a coronavirus that causes the disease Covid-19. As we are unlikely to be referring to any other coronavirus, it is enough to refer simply to coronavirus - or, in very medically slanted pieces, Sars-Cov-2 - and the coronavirus disease at first reference.\n\nPeople who test positive for it are carrying the Covid-19 virus or coronavirus. At second reference, it is enough to refer simply to carrying the virus.\n\nThey are best described as people with the Covid-19 virus or coronavirus, rather than victims or sufferers. At second reference, it might be enough to refer simply to people with the virus.\n\nOnly when they become ill can they be said to have Covid-19 or the coronavirus disease. At second reference, it might be enough to refer to having the disease.\n\nThen, they are best described as patients with Covid-19 or people with Covid-19 or the coronavirus disease. At second reference, it might be enough to refer simply to patients or people with the disease.\n\nWhen reporting deaths, people die with Covid-19/the coronavirus disease. At second reference, it might be enough to refer simply to dying with the disease.\n\nIn line with our style-guide ruling on weights and measures, itâs:\n\n2m (6ft) at first mention, 2m at second reference\n\nAlso:\n\nthe prime minister was in St Thomas' Hospital\n\nNHS Nightingale Hospital London was built inthe ExCel centre\n\nAnd there are two main types of test for the Covid-19 virus:\n\na diagnostic, swab test to see if someone is carrying the virus\n\nan antibodies, blood test to see if someone has had the virus\n\nProf Chris Whitty should be referred to as the UK governmentâs chief medical adviser or the UKâs chief medical adviser.\n\nAt first reference it's the reproduction (R) number, in later references the R number\n\ncredence/credibility\n\nThese are not synonyms: credence means belief or trust; credibility is the quality of being believable.\n\ncrescendo\n\nmeans a gradual increase in loudness - rather than a \"climax\" - so a piece of music cannot \"reach a crescendo\".\n\ncricket\n\nTest match, or Test - ie upper case \"T\".\n\nScores: all numbers should be written as digits eg: By close of play, England had made 265-8, or WG Grace took 4-9.\n\ncriteria\n\nis a plural. The singular is criterion.\n\ncriticise\n\nie with an \"s\" (and not \"criticize\").\n\ncrossbencher\n\nie one word, no hyphen. But two words in cross benches.\n\ncross-heads\n\n(also known as sub-heads) They must be in bold type, since part of their job is to break up blocks of text. But they should also provide an incentive to read on. They should not repeat information already provided in copy. And they should not consist of a random word picked from the sentence immediately afterwards: the ideal cross-head should have its inspiration three or four sentences into the text that follows.\n\nNever put a cross-head in the first four paragraphs of a story. Any quotation marks in a cross-head must be single.\n\nCrown\n\nCap up when the reference relates to the UK monarchy eg: Crown Estate, Crown Court, Crown dependency. Generically, lower case eg: She was the jewel in the crown.\n\ncruise missile\n\nie no hyphen - and lower case, because it refers to a type of weapon (low-flying, long-distance, computer-controlled winged missile), rather than a specific one.\n\ncryptocurrency\n\nie one word\n\nCSA\n\nie all caps, no gaps. The Child Support Agency is responsible for ensuring that parents who live apart from their children contribute financially to their upkeep by paying child maintenance.\n\nCup(s)\n\nSports trophies take a capital letter: FA Cup, World Cup, Calcutta Cup etc.\n\ncurrencies\n\nWe say:50p; Â£5; Â£60; Â£3m; Â£500m; Â£6bn; Â£20bn; Â£15tn\n\nIn UK stories (about UK firms, the UK economy etc), use pounds only in the first four paragraphs, but provide a US dollar conversion of a key figure at the earliest opportunity.\n\nIn eurozone stories (or wherever the original reporting figure is euros), use euros followed in brackets by a pound conversion of a key figure - even in the first four paragraphs.\n\nIn World stories (ie. non pound, non eurozone), use US dollars, followed in brackets by a pound conversion of a key figure - again, even in the first four paragraphs. Alternatively, use the local currency and then convert to both US dollars and sterling (eg. Japanâs Nayaka has announced the worst corporate result in history, losing 40 trillion yen ($340bn; Â£212bn).\n\nAbbreviations: The names of all currencies are written out in full at first reference - with the exception of the pound sterling, the euro and the US dollar, which are always Â£, â¬ and $. If we do spell out euro, the plural is euros. Otherwise, abbreviations to be used after first reference are: SFr (Swiss francs); HK$ (Hong Kong dollars); A$ (Australian dollars).\n\nFor Bitcoin, upper case when referring to the currency - eg: âThe Bitcoin has fallen against the dollar.â Lower case when referring to units of the currency, eg: âYou owe me five bitcoins.â\n\ncyber\n\nAll compound words should use a hyphen â cyber-crime, cyber-space, cyber-security, cyber-bullying, cyber-attack.\n\nCyprus\n\nThe northern part, occupied by Turkey, is not internationally recognised, so do not refer to \"North Cyprus\" - the term the Turks have chosen. Instead, say northern Cyprus, describing it either as Turkish-occupied or Turkish-controlled. And we should speak of the Green Line - not \"the so-called Green Line\".\n\nD\n\nDail\n\nis the lower house of the Irish Parliament. Do not use in headlines or summaries, but it should always be referred to by name at least once - with initial cap. A Member of the Irish Parliament should not be referred to as an \"MP\", but as a member of parliament, parliamentary deputy, deputy or even TD - so long as it is clear from the context that this is the Irish abbreviation for member of the house (\"Teacht Dala\").\n\nDakar/Dhaka\n\nDakar is the capital of Senegal; not to be confused with the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka.\n\nDalai Lama\n\nie with initial caps.\n\ndamage\n\nPhrases such as \"damage worth millions\" are meaningless. Say damage put at, or damage estimated at, or similar.\n\ndaring\n\nDo not use in the context of a crime or military action, as it suggests admiration.\n\ndashcam\n\none word â also helmetcam and similar constructions.\n\ndata\n\nStrictly a plural - but follow common usage and treat it as a singular, taking a singular verb (eg: Data was collected across the country).\n\ndates\n\nPut the date before the month, without suffix (eg: 12 April). There is no added comma for the year (eg: 12 April 2003), but there should be one if the day of the week is included (eg: Saturday, 12 April).\n\nAvoid the 12/04/2012 formulation, as this will be understood in the US as 4 December. And one exception to the general rule: in a US context, spell out the Fourth of July.\n\ndays\n\nOur readers live in various time zones, so avoid references to \"yesterday\", \"this morning\", \"today\", \"tonight\", \"tomorrow\" etc. Instead, days should be referred to by name (eg: Voting begins on Monday). Do not follow the American custom of omitting the preposition (eg: \"Voting begins Monday\").\n\nWhen writing about events that have happened or are due to happen on the day a story appears, avoid putting the day of the week in the top four pars. If some indication of timescale is needed, use another form of words such as \"within hours\", \"shortly\" or \"earlier\". If there is a potential for confusion, include the day lower down the story (although the date stamp should mean this is unnecessary in most cases).\n\nDax\n\n(Frankfurtâs main stock market index) ie initial cap only.\n\nD-Day\n\n(6 June 1944) ie hyphenated - with two caps.\n\ndead on arrival\n\nis a term to be avoided. Itâs ambulance service jargon, being the term used in duty logs, where it often appears as \"DOA\". The implication that the individual died en route to hospital is often false.\n\ndeath row\n\nie lower case.\n\ndecades\n\nUse digits, without apostrophes (eg: 1960s or the 60s; Henry Hyde is now in his mid-40s). The exception is where an adjective is attached - in which case, the decade is written with an apostrophe (eg the Swinging â60s).\n\ndecimate\n\nis a word liable to create misunderstanding. Strictly, it means \"to destroy one-tenth of something\" - but itâs commonly used to mean \"destroy a large part of\". Best avoided.\n\ndefence\n\nis our usual spelling, even with job titles which in their original form use US spelling (eg: the US Defence Secretary John Wayne - and not \"Defense Secretary\"). Follow the American spelling of the department if using its full name (eg: the US Department of Defense), but use UK spelling for an abbreviated form eg: the US defence department. This is often preferable, in order to avoid spelling the same word in two ways in the same story.\n\nDelhi\n\nDo not refer to it as \"New Delhi\", which is only one part of the Indian capital.\n\nDemocratic Party\n\nis the correct name for the US political party, not the \"Democrat Party\". But party members may be called \"Democrats\".\n\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\n\n(responsible for business and enterprise support, higher and further education, promoting scientific research). Department may be abbreviated at second reference to BEIS (ie all caps, no gaps).You can also refer to the business department (no caps)\n\nHeaded by the business secretary who may, according to context, be referred to as energy secretary, or industrial-strategy secretary (titles capped up if accompanied by name).\n\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport\n\nDepartment may be abbreviated at second reference to DCMS (ie all caps, no gaps).\n\nHeaded by the culture secretary (title capped up if accompanied by name).\n\nDepartment for Education\n\n(responsible for education and childrenâs services). No initial caps if referred to as \"the education department\").\n\nDepartment may be abbreviated at second reference to DfE (no gaps).\n\nHeaded by the education secretary (title capped up if accompanied by name).\n\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n\nmay be shortened to Defra (ie initial cap only). No caps for the environment department.\n\nHeaded by the environment secretary (title capped up if accompanied by name).\n\nDepartment for International Trade\n\nDepartment may be abbreviated at second reference to DIT (ie all caps, no gaps).\n\nHeaded by the international-trade secretary (title capped up if accompanied by name).\n\nDepartment for Transport\n\nDepartment may be abbreviated at second reference to DfT (ie no gaps).\n\nHeaded by the transport secretary (title capped up if accompanied by name).\n\nDepartment for Work and Pensions\n\nHeaded by the work and pensions secretary, who, according to context, may be referred to as the pensions secretary (capped up if accompanied by name). Department may be abbreviated at second reference to DWP (ie all caps). No caps for the work department or the pensions department.\n\nDepartment of Health and Social Care\n\nmay be abbreviated at second reference to the DHSC or the health department (ie with no caps).\n\nHeaded by the health secretary (title capped up if accompanied by name).\n\ndependant/dependent\n\nThe noun is dependant (eg: Mr Smith told the court he had 14 dependants). The adjective is dependent (eg: Mr Smith told the court he was heavily dependent on drugs).\n\ndeprecate/depreciate\n\nDeprecate means \"to express disapproval of\". Do not confuse with depreciate, which means \"to diminish in value\".\n\nDerry\n\nThe city and county are Londonderry. The city should be given the full name at first reference, but Derry can be used later. The local council is Derry City Council.\n\ndeterrent\n\nTo talk about a \"nuclear deterrent\" implies acceptance of the doctrine of deterrence, which not all do. Referring to a \"nuclear weapons programme\" might be a suitable alternative.\n\nDiamond Jubilee\n\nAs in Elizabeth IIâs. Capped up.\n\ndifferent\n\nSay different from (rather than \"different to\" or \"different than\").\n\ndirect quotes\n\nPick only the best lines for direct quotation; anything else should be converted into indirect speech. Eliminate superfluous conversational devices (eg: \"to be honest with you\", \"what I want to say is\"). Make sure the meaning is clear - if not, leave it out.\n\nAvoid exposing a speaker to ridicule by bringing his/her grammatical/linguistic incompetence to a wider audience. A combination of indirect speech and omission should solve the problem.\n\nPunctuation: with complete sentences, the closing quotation marks go after the full stop. With a single word or phrase, the quotation marks go before the full stop. Where part of a quote has been omitted, use triple dots with a space after the last dot (eg: The quality of mercy is not strainedâ¦ it is twice blest.)\n\ndirector general\n\n(of the BBC) ie two words, no hyphen, no caps.\n\ndisabilities/illnesses\n\nWe should be careful about the language we use when referring to disabled people. The same applies for mentally disabled people. Where possible, be guided by the preference of the contributor.\n\nRemember, âdisabledâ is a description not a group of people. âThe disabledâ implies a homogeneous group not individuals.\n\nDisabled people do not always want to be solely identified by their disability but there is some debate about whether it is appropriate to talk about âpeople with disabilitiesâ â with critics of the phrase saying, for example, they have been disabled by societyâs failure to cater for them.\n\nDo not refer to someone being \"wheelchair-bound\" or \"confined to a wheelchair\", since wheelchairs provide mobility - not confinement. Instead, write about a person who uses a wheelchair or who is in a wheelchair or a wheelchair user.\n\nWhen referring specifically to an individual or groupâs medical or health condition, âimpairmentâ is relatively neutral, while âsuffersâ or âafflictedâ can have negative connotations. Many disabled people do not see their impairment in negative terms.\n\nâConditionâ is more commonly used to describe a medical condition. Say âliving withâ, âwas diagnosedâ, or âhasâ¦â.\n\nâInvalidâ, âhandicappedâ, âcrippleâ and âdeformedâ should not be used, nor âmentally handicappedâ, âmentally defectiveâ, âretardedâ or âsubnormal.â Consider instead âa person who has a learning disabilityâ.\n\nAvoid describing people as \"mute\". \"Unable to speak\" is a suitable alternative.\n\n\"Spastic\" is a term that is not acceptable. Speak of people with cerebral palsy. \"Handicap\" and \"cripple\" are also not acceptable.\n\nWe do not speak of \"epileptics\" or \"epilepsy sufferers\". Instead, say people with epilepsy. The use of the term \"fit\" for an epileptic incident is increasingly seen as outdated and can be offensive. The preferred word is seizure, though attack can also be acceptable. However, if a speaker uses fit in a direct quote that's OK.\n\nAvoid using the word \"leper\" when describing someone with leprosy. It carries very negative connotations, suggesting an outcast or pariah. There will inevitably be occasions when someone says he/she was \"treated like a leper\". This is acceptable provided it is in direct quotes.\n\nIn reporting stories about albinism, we should recognise that it might not be a familiar term to everyone. People with albinism or albino people would be our preference, with \"albinos\" only to be used in headlines.\n\nRather than âmidgetâ, âdwarfâ or âdwarvesâ, the preferred terms are usually ârestricted growthâ or the medical term âdwarfismâ if used in the right context - for example, âsomeone who has dwarfismâ or âsomeone who has a form of dwarfismâ.\n\nAvoid using the terms âbattleâ and âfightâ when referring to someone seeking to overcome an illness or disease such as cancer, unless they themselves use it.\n\nSee also mental health\n\ndisc/disk\n\nCDs and DVDs are discs, and someone may suffer a slipped disc; but for the computer storage devices we use a disk (eg hard disk, floppy disk).\n\ndischarge\n\nPeople are not \"released\" from hospital - they are discharged (or sent home, allowed home etc).\n\ndisclose\n\nUse with care. It implies that what is being said is true.\n\ndiscreet/discrete\n\nNot to be confused: discreet means \"careful\" or \"tactful\"; discrete means \"distinct and separate\".\n\ndisinterested\n\nmeans \"impartial\" (eg: a tennis umpire is a disinterested onlooker). Do not confuse with \"uninterested\".\n\nDisney\n\nThe original theme park in California is Disneyland. There is also Walt Disney World in Florida. The European one is now Disneyland Paris (no comma), although the company that owns it retains the name, Euro Disney.\n\ndispatches\n\nIs our preferred spelling, as opposed to despatches. In Parliament, ministers lean on the dispatch box ie without caps.\n\ndissociate\n\nie not \"disassociate\".\n\ndistances\n\nIn most cases, use both imperial and metric measures. UK and US stories should usually put miles first, followed immediately by a conversion to km inside brackets. Similarly, yds / ft / in should be followed by a metric conversion (eg: The US president has travelled more than 2,000 miles (3,200km); Officials in Norwich have defended the introduction of a double yellow line measuring just 45in (1.14m). But donât be too literal in the conversion of an approximate figure, as in The lifeboat picked up the man about 200m (656ft) from the shore.\n\nIn non-UK/US stories, metric should usually come first - with a bracketed conversion to imperial (eg: Police in France say the floods reached a peak of 5.3m (17ft 8in); At least five fugitives from English justice are living along a 10km (6.2 mile) stretch of the Spanish coast.) Sometimes, logic will dictate that metric should come first (eg: Train speeds on the British side of the Channel Tunnel compare badly with French top speeds of 300km/h (186.4mph).\n\nThe words \"metre\", \"kilometre\" etc are not written out in full, even at first reference; use the abbreviations m, km, etc - with no space and no \"s\" in the plural.\n\nDA notice\n\nDefence Advisory Notice (formerly D notice) - an official request to withhold a news item for reasons of national security.\n\nDoctor\n\nUse the title Dr (always abbreviated) - but only when it is relevant. Surgeons should be referred to as Mr/Mrs/Ms.\n\ndogs\n\nIn general, lower case unless the name refers to a country eg: German shepherd, great Dane, Afghan hound, rottweiler, labrador, Portuguese water dog, pekinese, Irish wolfhound, poodle, spaniel, dachshund. XL bully\n\nDominica/Dominican Republic\n\nare different places. Dominica is a Caribbean island; the Dominican Republic shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti.\n\ndotcom\n\nie no caps, all one word.\n\nDow Jones\n\n(index of the share prices of the 30 leading US companies) ie initial caps. Full title: Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nDowning Street is an acceptable synonym for a government spokesman (eg: Downing Street says... ). You can also use No 10 ie initial cap, but not âNumber Tenâ.\n\nDownâs syndrome\n\ncap \"D\", lower case \"s\".\n\ndown under\n\ncolloquialism referring to Australia & New Zealand) ie lower case.\n\ndraconian\n\nmeans \"excessively harsh\" only with reference to laws. Do not use in any other context.\n\ndrink-driving\n\nThe legal alcohol limit for drivers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is: 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood; 35 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath; 107 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of urine.\n\nIn Scotland, the limits are 50 milligrams, 22 micrograms and 67 milligrams.\n\nThe limit in most other European nations is lower.\n\ndrugs\n\nWhen referring to seizures of illegal drugs,say drugs with a street value ofâ¦ (and not \"drugs worthâ¦\")\n\nDuchess of York\n\nSay the Duchess of York at first reference; then the duchess (lower case). Do not call her \"Fergie\".\n\ndue to\n\nmeans \"caused by\", and should be used in conjunction with a noun, not a verb: eg His frustration was due to their inefficiency (and not \"He was frustrated due to their inefficiency\").\n\nDuma\n\n(the lower house of parliament in Russia) ie always capped up.\n\nDutch names\n\nIn genuinely Dutch names, it is Van with an initial cap if only the surname is given (eg The painting was by Van Gogh). But it is lower case if you use the whole name (eg The museum is dedicated to Vincent van Gogh). This may vary with anglicised or US derivatives, where an individual might have chosen to retain the capitalised Van in all circumstances.\n\nE\n\nEarth/earth\n\nUse upper case for the planet (eg The spaceship will circle the Earth for weeks). Otherwise, lower case (eg Madonna said it had taken her weeks to come down to earth after the wedding).\n\nearthquakes\n\nWe should describe earthquakes in terms of magnitude, which is the measure used by the US Geological Survey (eg The island was hit by a magnitude seven earthquake). Magnitude measurements can usually be found on the USGS website.\n\nWe should no longer refer to the Richter scale.\n\nEast Asia\n\nie initial cap for each word. Avoid references to the Far East.\n\nEastEnders\n\nie the second capital is retained.\n\nEastern Europe\n\nie initial cap for each word. Note that we shouldnot use the terms \"Eastern Europe\" and \"Eastern European\" when referring to the former Soviet bloc. (Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are in Central Europe.) \"Eastern Europe\" should refer only to countries that sit geographically there eg: Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine and Russia.\n\nEasyJet\n\nie a cap \"E\" and \"J\". Style is to follow a companyâs preference but with an initial cap if one is not used.\n\neBay\n\nie lower case \"e\", and upper case \"B\", except at the start of sentences, where it should be written \"EBay\"; but headlines can begin \"eBay\".\n\ne-book\n\nie lower case with hyphen\n\ne-cigarette\n\n(electronic cigarette) lower case with hyphen.\n\nE. coli\n\nie capital \"E\", with a full stop and a space followed by lower case \"c\". Common variety is O157 (ie with a letter \"O\", rather than a zero). Note that it is caused by bacteria, not a virus.\n\ne-commerce\n\n(electronic commerce) ie lower case, hyphenated.\n\nEcuadorean\n\nIs our preference, rather than Ecuadorian.\n\necstasy\n\nWhether the pill or the state of joy, lower case \"e\".\n\neffect (verb)\n\nNot synonymous with \"affect\". \"To affect\" means \"to have an influence on\" (eg: Wine does not affect me). \"To effect\" means \"to cause, accomplish\" (eg: A month at the clinic effected my recovery).\n\neffectively/in effect\n\nCorrectly used,\" effectively\" means \"efficiently\" or \"successfully\" - as in Despite his inexperience, he rules the country effectively. But the word is frequently misused (and misunderstood) to mean \"in effect\" and so should, in general, be avoided.\n\n\"In effect\" means \"to all intents and purposes\", as in Smith holds no official office, but in effect he rules the country.\n\nIf you mean \"in effect\", then say so. If you mean \"effectively\", then say \"successfully\" or perhaps \"to good effect\".\n\neg\n\nie no full stop.\n\nEire\n\nDo not use either Eire or Southern Ireland. Say Ireland, the Republic of Ireland or the Irish Republic. Its people (and the adjective) are Irish - some people living in Northern Ireland may also describe themselves as Irish or Northern Irish.\n\neither\n\nThe verb is singular if both alternatives are singular (Either Smith or Jones is to stand for Parliament). If even one of them is plural, then the verb is plural (Either Smith or his political colleagues have to make a decision).\n\nElBaradei, Mohamed\n\n(Egyptian opposition figure and former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency) ie one word, capital \"E\" at the start, plus an internal capital \"B\". Second reference: Mr ElBaradei.\n\nelections\n\nOnce a UK general election is called, MPs cease to be MPs - but ministers remain ministers. People standing for Parliament are parliamentary candidates or just candidates - either way, lower case.\n\nelectricity\n\nQuantities of electricity are frequently measured either as power - how much energy is consumed in a given time (kilowatts, megawatts etc), or energy itself eg: kilowatt-hours - the amount of energy required to run a kilowatt-consuming device for an hour.\n\nThese are not interchangeable. When writing about how much a given plant/turbine/hydro dam is producing, use watts eg: The turbine produces 800 kW, enough to power 70 homes.\n\nWhen talking about energy costs or annual consumption, use kilowatt-hours eg: In its first three days of operation, the turbine produced 800 kWh, enough to power an average household for a month. EDF said it would subsidise the energy cost by as much as 3p per kWh.\n\nNote that measurements above kilowatt - megawatt, gigawatt, terawatt etc - take caps when abbreviated: MW/MWh; GW/GWh; TW/TWh.\n\nelectrocution\n\nAlthough often thought to be fatal, we support the view that it can cause death or injury. But because of possible ambiguity, be clear in stories what the outcome was.\n\n11-plus\n\nie hyphenated - with the number written in digits and the word \"plus\" spelt out.\n\nellipsis\n\nWhere part of a quote is omitted, put three dots immediately after the last word used, followed by a space (eg \"Prices have not merely risen... they have soared\"). It is important NOT to start with a space, because this could mean a new line beginning with the dots. If the quote is a complete sentence, there is no need for an ellipsis.\n\nemail\n\nie lower case, with no hyphen.\n\nembassy\n\nlower case - ie The British embassy in Washington.\n\nenormity\n\nUse \"enormity\" only in its traditional sense of \"wickedness\" (eg the enormity of Harold Shipmanâs crimes soon became apparent). Do not use \"enormity\" to mean \"hugeness\".\n\nEritrean names\n\nThe surname comes first - so Abiy Ahmed becomes Mr Abiy at second reference.\n\nescapee\n\nA legitimate alternative for \"escaper\".\n\nesports\n\n(electronic sports) ie lower case, no hyphen. The name for a form of competition using video games.\n\nespresso\n\nFor both the machine and the coffee it makes, espresso is the correct term. \"Expresso\" is wrong for both.\n\nEswatini\n\nThe country formerly known as Swaziland. Add âpreviously known as Swazilandâ, high up. Itâs Swati when describing its people. Initial letter is now capitalised.\n\nEta\n\nIn line with our usual rule, cap up only the first letter because we pronounce it as a word. First reference should always spell out the Basque separatist group, Eta or the Basque separatist movement, Eta.\n\nEthiopian names\n\nThe surname comes first - so Abiy Ahmed becomes Mr Abiy at second reference.\n\nEton\n\nIt is Eton College - and not Eton School.\n\neuro\n\nThe currency adopted by 19 EU member states ie lower case and never abbreviated. Since 2017, we have used the symbol for the euro rather than spelling it out. If using the full name, the plural is euros. Latest information here.\n\nEuro MP\n\nie no hyphen, with three caps. An acceptable abbreviation is MEP ie all caps (plural MEPs).\n\nEuropean Central Bank\n\nThe European Central Bank controls monetary policy in the 19 EU member states that make up the eurozone. Its headquarters are in Frankfurt, Germany. It may be shortened on second reference to ECB.\n\nEuropean Commission\n\nDo not abbreviate to \"EC\". This is the civil service of the European Union, headed by commissioners from the member states. It can propose new laws - but actually enacting legislation is the job of the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.\n\nEuropean Council\n\nThe European Council is the (usually) twice-yearly summit meeting of EU member statesâ heads of government, to determine overall policy direction. Not to be confused with the Council of Ministers or the Council of Europe.\n\nThe current European Council president is Charles Michel. He may for headline purposes be referred to as \"EU president\", but the full title should be in the summary and top four pars.\n\nEuropean Court of Human Rights\n\nThis is not an EU institution. It was established as a permanent entity in 1998 under the auspices of the Council of Europe and sits in Strasbourg. Its task is to ensure the observance of the principles set out in the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Judgements are binding on its 47 member states.\n\nEuropean Court of Justice\n\nThis is based in Luxembourg. Its function is to apply and interpret EU law. Initially, an advocate general presents a legal opinion on a case. The full court then deliberates and delivers its judgement. Not to be confused with the International Court of Justice.\n\nEuropean Parliament\n\nie Initial caps for the full title. Do not abbreviate to \"EU Parliament\". It is lower case if you are dropping the \"European\" label - eg Six MEPs walked out of parliament in disgust.\n\nThe European Parliament sits in Brussels and Strasbourg, and is administered from Luxembourg. Under the Lisbon Treaty, it became a co-legislator with the Council of Ministers in most policy areas. The parliament also has the final say on the European Commissionâs annual budget, the appointment of Commissioners and applications to join the EU.\n\nEuropean Union (EU)\n\nCreated by the Maastricht treaty of 1993. The original EEC (European Economic Community) was founded in 1957 with six member states. The EU now incorporates 27 countries, with seven others (Albania, Serbia, North Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Turkey and Ukraine) recognised as candidates for membership. Latest information here.\n\nEurophile\n\nie initial cap.\n\nEurosceptic\n\nie initial cap.\n\neurozone\n\nCurrently incorporates 19 EU member states where the euro is a valid currency. It should be in lower case, one word.\n\nevacuate\n\nThe rule used to be that only places or buildings were evacuated, not people. This is at odds with common usage, which now allows people to be \"evacuated\", as well as buildings. But avoid the intransitive use, eg: \"People are preparing to evacuate from Lebanon...\"\n\nexceeding the speed limit\n\nJust say speeding.\n\nexecute\n\nOnly after a legal process. Gunmen do not \"execute\" people, though they often claim to; they kill or murder.\n\nExecutive/executive\n\nFor Northern Ireland Executive: cap up the full title (eg The Northern Ireland Executive has voiced concern); otherwise, cap down (eg The executive in Stormont is to hold emergency talks).\n\nexpat\n\nShort for expatriate, ie no hyphen.\n\nF\n\nFA Cup\n\nie upper case \"C\".\n\nFair trade, Fairtrade\n\nTwo words when referring to the concept of trading with developing nations on an equal b"
