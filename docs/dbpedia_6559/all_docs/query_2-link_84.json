        "text": "Behrooz Parhami's Blog & Books Page\n\nPage last updated on 2024 August 28\n\nThis page was created in 2009 as an outgrowth of the section entitled \"Books Read or Heard\" in my personal page. The rapid expansion of the list of books warranted devoting a separate page to it. Given that the book introductions and reviews constituted a form of personal blog, I decided to title this page \"Blog & Books,\" to also allow discussion of interesting topics unrelated to books from time to time. Lately, non-book items (such as political news, tech news, puzzles, oddities, trivia, humor, art, and music) have formed the vast majority of the entries.\n\nEntries in each section appear in reverse chronological order.\n\nBlog entries for 2024\n\nBlog entries for 2023\n\nBlog entries for 2022\n\nBlog entries for 2021\n\nBlog entries for 2020\n\nBlog entries for 2019\n\nBlog entries for 2018\n\nBlog entries for 2017\n\nBlog entries for 2016\n\nArchived blogs for 2015\n\nArchived blogs for 2014\n\nArchived blogs for 2012-13\n\nArchived blogs up to 2011\n\nBlog Entries for 2024\n\n2024/08/28 (Wednesday): Presenting selected news, useful info, and oddities from around the Internet.\n\n(1) Images of the day: [Left] An open knight's tour of an 81 x 81 chessboard: The single-line drawing looks like a 9 x 9 Latin square of 9 different motifs. Each motif is an open knight's tour of a 9 x 9 chessboard. [Center] My prized set of Donald Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming, Vols. 1-3: I've had Vols. 1 & 3 since my graduate-student days and acquired a newer edition of Vol. 2 a few years later. This latter volume has been a great source of ideas & inspiration. [Right] Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis (see the last item below).\n\n(2) Iranian hackers targeted administration officials using WhatsApp: Meta has revealed that Iranian government hackers accused of breaching the Trump campaign with deceptive emails also used WhatsApp accounts to try to trick former Biden and Trump administration officials. The effort was discovered after users reported suspicious messages in which the hackers posed as customer support representatives from Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and AOL. Meta has suspended fewer than a dozen accounts that had targeted fewer than two dozen people in the United States, Israel, Iran, and elsewhere.\n\n(3) Book review: Satrapi, Marjane, The Complete Persepolis (Persepolis #1-4), Pantheon, 2007.\n\n[My 4-star review of this book on GoodReads]\n\nI read the pieces of this compilation at various times and wrote about them on social media as I read them. This review, being put together in mid-August 2024 contains a summary of my views on the book series.\n\nSatrapi's Persepolis was my first experience with a graphic novel. Despite its limitations, the graphic-novel format does allow a simple-to-follow narrative through a combination of words and images, but it also creates a tendency to exaggerate or distort in order to make the graphic part compelling. Deep reflections do not produce compelling graphics.\n\nThese autobiographical books, which have been made into a feature film, trace Satrapi's life from her childhood and coming-of-age within a large and loving family in Tehran during Iran's Islamic Revolution in the late 1970s, all the way to her self-imposed exile in Europe. Along the way, she is sent to Vienna while living at a boarding house and experiences a bittersweet homecoming. Satrapi's leftist family is quite disappointed when it turns out that the revolutionary government replacing the overthrown Shah isn't into honoring personal freedoms and human rights.\n\nSatrapi is among the growing collection of Iranian authors who have used the dramatic sociopolitical developments in the 1970s and 1980s Iran as backdrops for telling personal stories. Authors who do this in the nonfiction framework must take care to accurately portray actual events and not distort history for dramatic effect. Satrapi's book is full of distortion, in part because she wants to exonerate Iranian leftists from their responsibility in raising the mullahs to power.\n\nAs awful as the action of the religious fanatics were, certain reactions of intellectuals were hardly any better. I recall a scene in the book (p. 285 of my copy) where Satrapi has appeared for a rendezvous fully made up. A van filled with Revolutionary Guards suddenly appears, making Satrapi worried about how they might treat her because of wearing make-up. She suddenly thinks of accusing an innocent bystander of saying something indecent to her, in order to deflect attention from herself. The poor young man is taken away, as he pleads with the guards and Satrapi that he is innocent. A few panels later, Satrapi and her boyfriend have a laugh over the incident as they characterize Satrapi's survival instinct as \"too cool!\" What might have happened to the falsely-accused guy in the custody of Revolutionary Guards did not concern them at all.\n\nPersepolis is an important book, given its sociopolitical themes and strong feminism content. I would have given it 3 stars were it not for these positive elements.\n\n2024/08/27 (Tuesday): Today, I offer reviews of two books by political commentator Fareed zakaria.\n\n(1) Book review: Zakaria, Fareed, Age of Revolutions: Progress and Backlash from 1600 to the Present, unabridged 13-hour audiobook, read by the author, Simon & Schuster Audio, 2024.\n\n[My 4-star review of this book on GoodReads]\n\nPolitical commentator Fareed Zakaria sees the present era to be revolutionary, involving fundamental changes marked not necessarily by advances but by retreats into ideologies once discarded. In this regard, Donald Trump fits right in with the global trend, embracing the politics of resentment against the other, be they nonwhite newcomers or members of the urban elite. Zakaria tells us that he has worked on this project, originally entitled \"Beyond Left and Right,\" for years, taking detours to complete other, shorter projects.\n\nAs a fine example of early liberal revolutions, the establishment of the Dutch Republic brought with it a celebration of individual rights and toleration of religious minorities, along with an entrepreneurial spirit that made Holland the wealthiest nation on the planet. Similarly, the post-Glorious-Revolution British government supported inventors, rewarded technological innovation, and introduced parliamentary rule, along with market capitalism, pushing the nation well ahead of its neighbors.\n\nZakaria's points are well-argued and thought-provoking. He asks, for example, why the US is the only industrial nation that never developed a socialist movement. Perhaps it was because the US never experienced feudalism as such, and its ruling class \"obscured the strict lines of class conflict that fed socialism.\" Absent socialism, the country instead developed a liberal democracy along the lines of the old Dutch Republic, and prospered as a result.\n\nDespite the prosperity that liberalism has brought to the US, Americans have, by and large, a negative view of the term, often equating it with leftist ideas or socialism. The US benefited over many decades from the greatest strength of liberalism, that is, freeing people from arbitrary constraints, but it is now facing liberalism's greatest weakness, \"the inability to fill the void when old structures crumble.\"\n\nWe are now at a juncture where old structures are collapsing on every side, with no fresh solutions being advanced from the right or the left. The most-prominent messenger of change happens to be an incompetent, morally-bankrupt character who focuses on what's wrong, emphasizing grievances over rights and fixes. He advocates turning to pre-World-War-II isolationism and protectionism as a way to restore simpler times, when workers worked and masters enjoyed their leisure. Do we really have to go back to those days to realize that they weren't as perfect as they are depicted to be by the far right?\n\nIn his concluding chapter, Zakaria quotes the influential American journalist Walter Lipman, who wrote these words in 1929 about the negative impacts of the revolutions that produced modern life: \"By the dissolution of their ancestral ways, men have been deprived of the sense of certainty as to why they were born, why they must work, whom they must love, what they must honor, where they may turn in sorrow and defeat.\" These words resonate in America's current sociopolitical landscape.\n\n(2) Book review: Zakaria, Fareed, In Defense of a Liberal Education, unabridged 4-hour audiobook, read by the author, Simon & Schuster Audio, 2015. [My 4-star review of this book on GoodReads]\n\nThe debate between skills-based education and broad liberal arts education is never-ending. Zakaria presents ample reasons for the latter approach working better, as evidenced by the success of the United States in leading the world in innovation and tech advances. Countries like China, South Korea, Japan, and even India focus on teaching skills and on selection on the basis of test scores. All of these countries do well on quantitative measures of performance on math and science topics, but they do not produce self-confident individuals who can thrive in a rapidly-changing world.\n\nPreviously, I read and reviewed David Epstein's Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World, Giving it 4 stars. According to Epstein, avoiding super-specialization, or combining breadth and depth, allows you to benefit from the outsider advantage. The very top scientists participate in activities outside their areas of expertise. The higher up they are in scientific prestige, the more likely they are to have outside interests. In today's complex world, people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences & perspectives will increasingly thrive.\n\nCiting his own experience of growing up in India, where tests and specialization rule, Zakaria tells us that he followed his brother's example of getting a college education in the US, where education is broad-based and places great emphasis on reading and writing skills. This approach obviously worked for him, because it gave him the communications and analytic skills to become a sociopolitical commentator and successful TV host. For a while, the success formula in the US seemed to be \"enroll in college, drop out, establish a tech company in your garage, rake millions.\"\n\nAs I write this review, the US is moving further away from broad-based liberal-arts education in favor of job skills. Proceeding in this direction would turn our highly successful universities into glorified trade schools. Many countries copied, with good results, the liberal-arts education approach of great American universities, who are now bent on copying other countries' less-successful narrow education and skills-based training.\n\n2024/08/26 (Monday): Presenting selected news, useful info, and oddities from around the Internet.\n\n(1) Images of the day: [Top left] Barcelona loves/hates tourism: The Spanish city's residents are feeling the frustrations of overtourism, including congestion, pollution, and disregard for local culture. But economically, the city remains reliant on visitors. [Top center] Persian calligraphic art. [Top right] Bearer of the Liberty Torch.

[Bottom right] Course on practicing mindfulness (see the last item below).\n\n(2) Honored by Dr. Amin Lifetime Achievement Award: The formal award will be presented on Saturday 8/31 at the 2024 Sharif University of Technology Association (SUTA) reunion in Niagara Falls, Canada. Since I won't be able to attend, I recorded this message (in Persian) for the attendees.\n\n(3) The citation black market: There are growing concerns about a black market that allows scientists to purchase bogus citations to pad their Google Scholar profiles. NYU computer scientists conducted a sting operation by purchasing 50 citations for $300 and adding them to a fake Google Scholar profile they created. The researchers also proposed a citation-concentration index to identify scientists with a large number of citations from only a few sources.\n\n(4) One-liners: Brief news headlines, happenings, memes, and other items of general interest.\n\n- Russia targets Ukraine's energy infrastructure with hundreds of missiles, causing widespread blackouts.\n\n- Hezbollah and Israel have intensified their rocket fight near the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\n- Israel is intensely searching for the new Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.\n\n- Donald Trump chickens out of the September 10 ABC-sponsored debate with Kamala Harris.\n\n(5) Course review: Muesse, Prof. Mark W. (Rhodes College), Practicing Mindfulness: An Introduction to Meditation, 24 lectures in the \"Great Courses\" series, The Teaching Company, 2011.\n\n[My 2-star review of this course on GoodReads]\n\nI lost interest in this course early on, but didn't want to give up on it. So, I continued listening by sampling each of the remaining 23 lectures. So, my review isn't complete and may in fact be unfair.\n\nMy main beef is that the material is intertwined with religious notions, often in indirect or subtle ways. The main message is that mindfulness requires much resolve and effort, whereas, counterintuitively, mindlessness, our default setting, entails a great deal of thinking, judging, and worrying. Our inner voices continuously comment on and judge everything we encounter, preventing us from focusing on our experiences and other important matters.\n\nLeft alone, the human mind tends to go to one of two places: The past or the future. We seldom focus on or engage with the present. We are often not in control of our minds and can't turn off the annoying inner voices. Aspects of mindfulness include awareness, relinquishing preconceptions, morality, focusing on breathing, wisdom, compassion, embracing our flaws & physical discomforts, giving, minding our language, cooling our anger, learning to accept loss, and living in the face of death.\n\nTitles of the 24 lectures and a brief description of each lecture can be found on this page.\n\nI enjoyed and recommend a previous read on meditation: Sam Harris's second book on the subject, Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics: A 10% Happier How-To Book (my review).\n\n2024/08/25 (Sunday): Today, I present reviews of four books on voting and elections. These books are among the refernce sources for my UCSB graduate seminar ECE 594BB, which I will teach during fall 2024.\n\n(1) Book review: Brams, Steven J. and Peter C. Fishburn, Approval Voting, Birkhauser, 1983 (2nd ed. Springer 2007). [My 4-star review of this book on GoodReads]\n\nFor 5+ decades now, I have been studying voting schemes in connection with reliable computer systems using multiple independent computation channels. More recently, I have expanded my studies to voting in sociopolitical contexts, hoping that the expanded view might offer applications and benefits to reliable computing.\n\nVoting is quite simple when we have only two candidates, but having 3+ candidates can give rise to anomalies and improper results. Consequently, mathematicians and social scientists have been studying many different voting schemes in order to minimize such anomalies and improper results. Plurality voting, the one we use most widely, is particularly prone to undesirable effects such as vote-splitting and spoiler candidates. When combined with a second-round run-off election, problem cases subside, but they don't completely go away.\n\nIn approval voting, a voter isn't forced to just pick one candidate, his/her most-preferred, but can \"approve\" any number of candidates. Each approved candidate receives one vote, and the candidate with the most vote wins. Vote-splitting does not occur, because a voter may approve more than one candidate, so s/he won't be forced to choose between his/her first and second choices, say. Similarly, spoiler candidates, who have virtually no chance of being elected, won't take away votes from mainstream choices.\n\nThere is a theoretical \"impossibility\" result, known as Arrow's Theorem, that shows no voting scheme is perfect, in that, given any voting scheme, we can construct examples to violate one or more of the axioms of \"good\" voting schemes. Approval voting, the subject of this book, comes close to being an ideal voting scheme.\n\nChapter 1 of the book offers a wrap-up summary of the main ideas in simple, non-mathematical terms. The casual reader will be convinced by the arguments and discussions in Chapter 1 that approval voting is better than plurality voting, even when a run-off round is added to the latter. The remaining 9 chapters get quite mathematical, which may not be to some readers' liking.\n\nTo apply voting schemes in the sociopolitical context, we need practicality in addition to scientific merit. Approval voting isn't much more difficult to implement than plurality voting. Existing voting technology, perhaps with small modifications, would suffice. Plurality voting is also easily understood by voters, and is thus unlikely to cause confusion.\n\nWe have no choice but to update our laws and procedures, as we uncover their flaws and learn about doing things more logically. Approval voting appears to strike a reasonable balance between mathematical guarantees of appropriate behavior and practicality of implementation.\n\nI will end this review with a quote from an 1816 letter of Thomas Jefferson to Samuel Kerchaval: \"I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times.\"\n\n[P.S.: The authors state that they have changed very little in the book's second edition, aiming only to correct minor errors in the original text, in part because Brams discusses recent research on approval voting in Mathematics and Democracy: Designing Better Voting and Fair-Division Procedures, with key elements also appearing in the authors' joint journal articles.]\n\n(2) Book review: Borgers, Christoph, Mathematics of Social Choice: Voting, Compensation, and Division, SIAM, 2020. [My 4-star review of this book on GoodReads]\n\nI was drawn to this book because of its discussion of voting methods in Part I (Chapters 1-12, pp. 1-91). The book's Part II (Chapters 13-15, pp. 93-118) covers compensation schemes and its Part III (Chapters 16-26, pp. 119-192) deals with equitable division. There are four appendices on sets, logic, mathematical induction, and solutions to selected exercises (pp. 195-242).\n\nLet me provide a brief overview of Parts II and III, before turning to Part I. Fair division of resources is a branch of mathematical economics. When the resource isn't continuously divisible, such as a house or a car in a divorce case, the problem is to determine a fair compensation by one party to the other who gets to keep the resource. A continuously-divisible resource can be likened to a cake. If one person cuts the cake into two pieces and a second person picks his/her piece, then neither side can complain. Fair compensation or division when 3+ parties are involved is more challenging.\n\nMy interest in Part I arises from 5+ decades of studying voting schemes in connection with reliable computer systems using multiple independent computation channels. More recently, I have expanded my studies to voting in sociopolitical contexts, hoping that the expanded view might offer applications and benefits to reliable computing. Voting is quite simple when we have only two candidates, but having 3+ candidates can give rise to anomalies and improper results. Borgers succeeds in conveying the mathematical depth of voting systems and their potential anomalies.\n\nEven though Borgers' discussion of voting systems takes up only 91 pages, the presentation is rather dense and covers a lot of ground. The key notions of Condorcet winner, election spoilers, monotonicity, irrelevant comparisons, strategic voting, ranking of candidates, and Arrow's impossibility theorems are all there, but Borgers covers many other ideas and theorems that are new to me. The large number of exercises, and solutions to a selected subset, is a plus when using the book as part of course material.\n\n(3) Book review: Poundstone, William, Gaming the Vote: Why Elections Aren't Fair (and What We Can Do About It), Hill and Wang, 2008. [My 3-star review of this book on GoodReads]\n\nThis book is presented in 3 parts and 17 chapters. The prologue sets the stage by considering the problem of fringe and spoiler candidates who taint elections without having a real chance of winning. \"Since 2004, the gaming of the spoiler effect has burgeoned and become thoroughly bipartisan. In the 2006 elections, no fewer than five key races had Democratic money funding spoilers to hurt Republicans or vice versa. The funds not only aided ballot drives but also paid for TV, radio, and print ads the spoilers could not otherwise have afforded\" [p. 22].\n\nPart I, Chapters 1-6 (pp. 23-130), defines the problem. Chapter titles are \"Game Theory,\" \"The Big Bang,\" \"A Short History of Vote Splitting,\" \"The Most Evil Man in America,\" \"Run, Ralph, Run,\" and \"Year of the Spoiler.\" We learn, among other things, that in a couple of figure-skating contests, the order of the top three contenders changed once a fourth skater performed and was scored below the top three. The figure-skating world was shocked and vowed to fix the scoring system. Similar anomalies can arise in the world of elections under certain voting systems.\n\nPart II, Chapters 7-15 (pp. 131-258), discusses the solution. Chapter titles are \"Trouble in Kiribati,\" \"The New Belfry,\" \"Instant Runoff,\" \"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Cycle,\" \"Buckley and the Clones,\" \"Bad Santa,\" \"Last Man Standing,\" \"Hot or Not,\" and \"Present but Not Voting.\" Among other ideas, advantages of the instant-runoff system (which is quite close to another system known as single transferable vote) are described. We also learn about Donald Saari, voting research's Bad Santa, because he spoils other researchers' fun by finding flaws in their proposed voting systems. Saari was once an advocate of approval voting, but later turned against it.\n\nPart III, Chapters 16-17 (pp. 259-283), addresses the reality. Chapter titles are \"The Way Democracy Will Be\" and \"Blue Man Coup.\" Near the end of this part, the author advocates for a real-world trial of instant-runoff, range, or approval voting. We can always go back to approval voting if the experiment doesn't work, but we must give some of these methods a try. Reform requires experimentation and courage to try new things.\n\n(4) Book review: Herrnson, Paul S., Richard G. Niemi, Michael J. Hanmer, Benjamin B. Bederson, Frederick C. Conrad, and Michael W. Traugott, Voting Technology: The Not-So-Simple Act of Casting a Ballot, Brookings Institution, 2008. [My 4-star review of this book on GoodReads]\n\nFor decades, voting technology consisted of paper ballots that were hand-counted. Then, we started using special ballot formats to enable machine-counting. In principle, with the widespread availability of the Internet and advances in digital authentication, we should be able to vote on-line, bypassing the need for voting precincts, paper ballots (or voting machines), and vote-counting gadgets, but lack of trust in the reliability and security of digital systems and concerns about access and fairness have prevented this ideal from materializing.\n\nThis book covers variations in and issues surrounding voting technology in 7 chapters and 3 appendices, as follows:\n\nChapter 1. The Study of Electronic Voting\n\nChapter 2. A New Generation of Voting Systems\n\nChapter 3. Voter Reaction to Electronic Voting Systems\n\nChapter 4. The Accuracy of Electronic Voting Systems\n\nChapter 5. Inequality in the Voting Booth\n\nChapter 6. Vote Verification Systems\n\nChapter 7. Toward More User-Friendly Voting and Election Systems\n\nAppendix A. Voter Information Guides and Questionnaires\n\nAppendix B. Characteristics of Respondents in the Field Studies\n\nAppendix C. Regression Results for Chapters 5 and 6\n\nAs paper or on-screen ballots have grown in size and complexity, automating the process of casting ballots, tallying votes, and validating the results have become more urgent. None of these aspects is trivial in an election with millions of voters and dozens of candidates. Equally urgent is introduction of standards to engender familiarity and voter education to avoid errors and intimidation (which can hamper participation).\n\nThe voting system (plurality, run-off, rank-ordering, Borda, and so on) is a different story, but whichever system is chosen through societal consensus, adhering to the rules and executing it in a transparent and trustworthy manner is essential. Perhaps we will see reforms in voting technology within our lifetime, but widespread adoption of new technologies is always challenging.\n\n2024/08/24 (Saturday): Presenting selected news, useful info, and oddities from around the Internet.\n\n(1) Images of the day: [Left] The Venice Film Festival has become a major predictor of success during the awards season.

Norton & Company, 2011. [My 4-star review of this book on GoodReads]\n\nThis book begins with a preface that tells the story of a pair of identical twins who had a genetic disorder known as Kalman Syndrome, which affected only one of them seriously.\n\nThen, in Chapter 1, we learn about the Dutch Famine, a \"natural experiment\" which contributed to much of our current knowledge about epigenetics. In fact, there was nothing natural about the Dutch famine. In the final months of World War II, the retreating Germans imposed a food embargo, destroyed what remained of the transportation infrastructure, and flooded much of western Holland's agricultural lands. The ill effects of the resulting famine lasted for a long time, affecting multiple Dutch generations to this day. Aided by meticulous health records maintained by the Dutch, scientists were able to learn quite a bit about epigenetics, or the way genes are impacted by environmental factors.\n\nAfter a brief general review of genetics in Chapters 2-3, Francis devotes Chapters 4-6 to epigenetic gene regulation and how it is influenced by the environment, beginning in the womb. Chapter 7 covers the inheritance of epigenetic states, elaborating further on the long-term effects of the Dutch famine. The final four Chapters provide additional details on epigenetics, including its applications in stem-cell and cancer research. The book's extensive notes and bibliography span pp. 162-181 and 182-215, respectively.\n\n2024/08/23 (Friday): Presenting selected news, useful info, and oddities from around the Internet.\n\n(1) Images of the day: [Left] An old cartoon that aroused my attention because I'll be teaching an undergraduate circuits course (ECE 10A) during winter 2025.

However, a dirty-bomb capable of doing much damage can be built by terrorists from advanced-reactor fuel.

The storage part is critical and needs significantly more effort. Production levels of renewable energy, solar and wind in particular, tend to be variable. Such supply variations, combined with natural variations in demand, give rise to the need for storing energy, in much the same way that we store grains in silos to smooth out the variations in when & where they are produced and when & where they are needed. In the case of grains, even year-to-year variations due to weather, pests, and natural disasters can be tolerated with sufficient storage capacity.\n\nThere is no reason why similar smoothing methods cannot be used for energy. The fact that we have not been investing more in developing energy-storage technologies is a direct result of the \"low cost\" of energy derived from oil, gas, & coal and the exorbitantly-funded campaign by the fossil-fuel industry to brand renewable energy as \"expensive.\" However, most cost comparisons are unfair, because they ignore environmental and other indirect costs. Mitigating the effects of harmful emissions from burning fossil fuels is rather expensive, a figure we should include in their life-cycle cost. If we do so, the so-called âgreen premiumâ will vanish or even become negative.\n\nI briefly surveyed a number of existing and emerging energy storage technologies, from mechanical (flywheel, pumped hydro, gravity, compressed air, liquid piston), through chemical & electrochemical (hydrogen, biofuel, biodiesel, supercapacitors, batteries), to superconducting & cryogenic (magnetic, liquid air). Strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches were enumerated. Emphasis was placed on the solar-battery combo, which is finding its way into homes and businesses throughout the world. These small-scale solar-battery nodes can be likened to PC-disk nodes, which together with larger-scale server-storage nodes constitute the Internet. In a similar manner, an Intergrid of energy can be conceived which will fuel the Third Industrial Revolution.\n\n2024/08/20 (Tuesday): Presenting selected news, useful info, and oddities from around the Internet.\n\n(1) Images of the day: [Left] Respecting the fact that the tree was there first: If only the same respect was shown to US Native Americans.

These missing battery sizes were defined and existed at one point, but given the fairly small size & capacity spacings between C and AA, the B and A sizes do not provide sufficient advantages in compactness or storage capacity, so over time they fell out of favor.\n\n(5) On our fascination with sports: The 2024 Paris Olympics coming to an end is a bittersweet experience for me. I watched the games very selectively, owing to some events not being of much interest to me and because I had a limited amount of time to watch. Football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, and some gymnastics took up the bulk of my TV time. I will miss watching so much quality sports.\n\nAs I look back on the 17-day experience, I keep wondering about the reasons we enjoy watching sports. If we compare sports to music, say, we know that music is good for us, whether we participate as a player or just listen and move to it. The recent book Music and Mind, edited by Renee Fleming, leaves little doubt about how music improves our mental acuity and makes life more enjoyable overall.\n\nIn the case of sports, there are definite benefits to participation but, as far as I know, no evidence of significant health benefits in watching. Certain sports do have artistic elements and watching them can presumably bring us the same benefits as art. But there are also the less charitable reasons for watching athletes compete, much in the same way that Romans watched gladiators.\n\nRegardless of the tribalism implied in enjoying the sports that are most-popular in our country and cheering on our country's participants, the Olympics does bring us the joys of seeing athletes from the entire world come together despite their obvious differences. There is something noble in accepting defeat by a more-skilled opponent or team and going back to the drawing board to improve our deficiencies, whether it is for doing better in the next Olympics or for the satisfaction of excellence.\n\n2024/08/10 (Saturday): Presenting selected news, useful info, and oddities from around the Internet.\n\n(1) Images of the day: [Left] Iranian women earning Olympics medals: What a display of women's power to backward rulers who don't recognize women as full human beings (see the next item below).

Brazil became quite dominant in the final 10 minutes before halftime.\n\nTwelve minutes into the second half, Swanson's speed paid off, as she put a through pass past the Brazil goalie. The 1-0 score persisted through the end of the second half (which included 10 minutes of stoppage time). Brazil again dominated in the last 10 minutes, coming close to equalizing on multiple occasions.\n\nThis is the US women national soccer team's fifth Olympics gold medal.\n\nP.S.: I saw more shots of Tom Cruise in the stands than of the US coach on the sideline!\n\n(6) The colonial legacy of science: Science, in its modern form, emerged from the Enlightenment-era Europe. At the time, a handful of European countries exerted political and economic control over more than half the world. The colonialists enslaved people and extracted precious metals, spices, and other wealth from their lands. The term \"parachute science\" was coined for the situation when foreign scientists were dropped in and wrote about problems in distant lands, with minimal involvement from local scientists. That legacy is still with us. For example, a 2019 study found that fewer than half of papers on infectious diseases in Africa had an African first author. We have to recognize this colonial legacy and work to allow researchers in once-colonized nations to become full partners in science.\n\n2024/08/08 (Thursday): Presenting selected news, useful info, and oddities from around the Internet.\n\n(1) Images of the day: [Left] Political executions continue in the Islamic Republic of Iran, regardless of who is the president.

There were ~85 attendees.\n\nDr. Kolbehdari began by citing the prediction that by 2050, we need to produce 70% more food, given the estimated ~2 billion growth in world population and the expected rise in the standard of living for billions of people in the developing world. The question facing humanity is how we can grow so much more food, without further destroying the planet.\n\nAn obvious answer is the use of higher-yielding crops and more-efficient agricultural and pest-control methods. For example, in the case of corn, a staple of the American diet, the nearly-constant yield during 1860-1940 began to take off in the 1940s due to advances in genetics. Unfortunately, greedy agricultural companies do not allow the people to gain maximum benefits from the rising crop yields, because they restrict access or charge exorbitant fees for patent-protected seeds that they develop.\n\nDr. Kolbehdari cited many examples of advances in high-yielding crops and the legal battles over their use and abuse. Fortunately, the patents associated with the seeds for such crops have a 20-year protection, but so far, advances have been so quick that it isn't cost-effective to use 20-year-old seeds in lieu of the most recent offerings.\n\nA natural question, which I asked at the end of the talk, is why limit ourselves to pursuing improved crops and agricultural innovations. Like any other matter, various food products can be synthesized from their molecular components. In my humble opinion, synthetic food production method, which are now in their infancy, will be scaled up to make agriculture, as it is known today, obsolete. Here is an informative article on the benefits and challenges of synthetic food.\n\n2024/08/07 (Wednesday): Presenting selected news, useful info, and oddities from around the Internet.\n\n(1) Images of the day: [Left] Kamala Harris taps Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota as her running mate: Walz's fatherly looks and Midwest small-town credentials appear to complement Harris's big-city background.

Collins, who tells us about his surreal experience of singing with three Supreme Court Justices and soprano Renee Fleming at a gathering, an event that made him bent on having NIH support more research on the connection between arts (music in particular) and neuroscience.\n\nThen, following an \"Overture\" by Fleming herself, chapters written by a wide variety of scientists and artists unfold, beginning with a chapter entitled \"How and Why: Experts Explain the Basic Science Connecting Arts and Health, Including Origins in Evolution: Musicality, Evolution, and Animal Response to Music,\" which sets the stage for the rest of the material.\n\nContributors to this volume make a convincing case that the arts empower and heal, collectively presenting a manifesto for neuroarts, the transdisciplinary study of how the arts and aesthetic experiences measurably change the body, brain, and behavior and how this knowledge is translated into specific practices that advance health and wellbeing.\n\nWe learn, among other things, that all forms of music, not just classical music, have relaxing effects. Moving to musical rhythms is part of our nature, something that develops quite early. Even though music therapy has been practiced for a couple of centuries, only recently has it been taken seriously for the treatment of physical and mental ailments. Even now, insurance companies tend not to pay for the cost of music therapy.\n\nIt is unfortunate that as evidence on the empowering and healing power of music and other art forms piles up, schools in the United States continue to trim arts programs to save money. Lack of a place for arts in public education limits artistic activities to the well-to-do, further exacerbating the opportunity divide. It is my hope that Fleming's book brings our school officials and politicians to their senses, making them support (including by providing ample funding) arts education across the K-12 curriculum.\n\n2024/08/03 (Saturday): Today, I present reviews of three books on history, finance, and politics.\n\n(1) Course review: Lee, John W. I., The Persian Empire, 24 lectures in the \"Great Courses\" series, undated.\n\n[My 5-star review of this course on GoodReads]\n\nI discovered this course by accident and was delighted by its content and by the fact that it is taught by a distinguished UCSB colleague, John W. I. Lee. Professor Lee has many academic honors to his name, including an Academic Senate Distinguished Teaching Award and the Harold J. Plous Memorial Award.\n\nProfessor Lee aims to corrects the negative view of the Persian Empire, which emerged from accounts by the Greek, leading to Persians being depicted in histories and films as the bad guys, the villains who were ruled by despotic leaders and lost the Battle of Marathon. Examining the Persian Empire from the Persian perspective yields a vastly different picture. We see the Persian Empire as a major force with a lasting influence on the world in terms of administration, economics, religion, and architecture.\n\nProfessor Lee tells us that as part of his research for this course, he studied American textbooks from the 1800s and 1900s. In 19th-century textbooks, writers go from describing the Persians fairly positively to calling them despotic, decadent, barbaric Orientals. By 1900, a popular textbook summed up the new view: One Greek was better than 10 Asiatics! And Hollywood (e.g., in the film \"300\") helped perpetuate the negative view.\n\nThe sources used by Professor Lee include:\n\n- Greek historical writings, which are obviously biased, but because Persians did not write their own history, Greek writings remain important sources, when checked against other corroborating evidence.\n\n- Stories in the Hebrew Bible, which are likely overly idealized.\n\n- Travelers and their writings.\n\n- Archaeological discoveries, including accounts of the same events in three different languages, which facilitated decoding and allowed cross-checking.\n\n- Thousands of Persepolis tablets, found during a fortification project, which contained official royal or governmental records.\n\n- Documents in Aramaic, flowing from Egypt, where the dry weather provided the requisite conditions for preservation.\n\nThe Persian Empire [559-323 BCE] was arguably the world's first global power. A diverse, multicultural empire with flourishing businesses and people on the move; an empire of information, made possible by a highly advanced infrastructure that included roads, canals, bridges, and a courier system. And the kings of Persia's Achaemenid dynasty (notably Cyrus, Darius, Xerxes) presided over an empire that created a tremendous legacy for subsequent history.\n\nProfessor Lee discusses many of the aspects named above in nearly chronological order: From the founding of the Empire; through capitals, palaces, & roads, challenges & battles, expansion, cultures & religion, city & country life, and the role of women; to the Empire's dissolution and its legacies.\n\nAccording to Professor Lee, history of the Persian Empire isn't a static subject. Just as new discoveries in recent decades have created significant changes in our views, future archaeological discoveries will likely bring about additional changes.\n\nFor a list of the 24 lectures and a brief description of each, see this Web page.\n\n(2) Book review: Galloway, Scott, The Algebra of Wealth: A Simple Formula for Financial Security, unabridged 8-hour audiobook, read by the author, Penguin Audio, 2024.\n\n[My 5-star review of this book on GoodReads]\n\nThis book can be put in the category of financial self-improvement. It collects in one place everything a non-expert must know in order to achieve financial security in the shortest possible time. Financial security is defined as having enough assets to cover expenses from the proceeds. The model of a person working for 30+ years before retiring and drawing income from pensions or investments is obsolete. In the modern world, one can attain financial security at age 40, say, and then decide whether s/he wants to continue to work for professional improvement and/or satisfaction.\n\nGalloway presents in four fairly long chapters his personal formula for achieving financial freedom based on the four principles of Stoicism, focus, time, and diversification. He maintains that we can eliminate economic anxiety through a combination of well-paid work, diversified investments, and good financial habits. What he calls the algebra of wealth is represented by the following formula:\n\nWealth = Focus + (Stoicism * Time * Diversification)\n\nChapter 1. Stoicism: A fundamental tenet of stoicism is discerning what is under our control and what is not. Living below your means, practicing financial discipline, and controlling your spending are essential aspects of financial stoicism. Central to the tenets of stoicism is a strong character. Do toot your own horn in order to advance as quickly as possible, but also develop kindness, generosity, and willingness to help others.\n\nChapter 2. Focus: To get started, you must earn an income, the more, the better. You should follow your talent rather than your passion in order to maximize your earning potential. You should invest in improving your skills and building relationships, both personal and professional. It is unfortunate that people have to change jobs in order to earn a fair salary for their skills. If necessary, do play that game: Get a job offer and ask your employer to match it.\n\nChapter 3. Time: Your most-important asset is time. In fact, all wealth comes directly or indirectly from time. If necessary, delegate tasks to paid workers in order to free your own time for more important stuff. When you are young, you have plenty of time and you must use that time to earn income and start the ball rolling on compounding. A small monthly saving when you are 20 can create more wealth than a much larger amount that you set aside beginning at 50, owing to the effects of compounding.\n\nChapter 4. Diversification: This is the most-complicated chapter and covers more material than the previous chapters. In a nutshell, diversification is about risk mitigation and avoidance of over-commitment. It requires a good understanding of financial concepts and of the markets. Everyone should learn about investment, various financial instruments, risk & return, taxation, and post- & pre-tax retirement savings. Galloway goes out of his way to advise against day-trading. He prefers to focus instead on index funds that perform better than almost any other investment.\n\nIn short, you need discipline and humility. Don't credit your gains to your own brilliance and your losses to external factors. Chance plays a big part in both. Following a disciplined approach will allow you to build up on your gains and learn from your losses.\n\n(3) Book review: Tsang, Steve and Olivia Cheung, The Political Thought of Xi Jinping, unabridged 11-hour audiobook, read by Rebecca Lam, HighBridge Audio, 2024.\n\n[My 3-star review of this book on GoodReads]\n\nXi Jinping, China's President (in practice, its Supreme Leader), is the least-known of the leaders of the world's major powers. So, given that China has the world's second economy and, by some accounts, may overtake the US within a few years, this book is a timely addition to the genre of political biographies.\n\nXi Jinping has made significant changes to China's political system, its economy, and its relationships with the rest of the world. Xi's ruling philosophy and worldview is called \"Xi Thought\" in this book. Xi has cemented his Thought (what we in the West call doctrine) as the new state ideology. After having the party rescind the limit of two 5-year terms for the top leader, he began his third term in 2022, essentially making him leader for life.\n\nXi dreams of replacing the American-dominated world order with a Sino-centric order in which China has resumed its rightful place as the top country in terms of power, wealth, advancement, civilization, and benevolence. Any alternative vision or history is banned. Collective leadership at the top has been transformed into an echo chamber. Party members are required to study Xi Thought on a daily basis, using an app. Xi Thought is also fully integrated into China's education system.\n\nXi views his Thought, strongly influenced by Mao Zedong Thought, as \"China Dream of National Rejuvenation,\" a \"Make China Great Again\" vision, to be realized by 2050. He sees no reason for China not being the world's leading power, given its glorious history and record of successes. In Xi's telling, a point of pride for China is that it has never invaded another country, a demonstrably-false claim.\n\nFighting corruption is one of the main tenets of Xi Thought. When he took over in 2012, corruption was rampant. Party leaders had lost ideological conviction, had their individual fiefdoms, and were pursuing their private interests. For China's problems, Xi blames both the West and the prior leaders' opening up policies.\n\nThe authors have used Xi's speeches, writings, and issued policies to conceptualize Xi's vision independently of narratives provided by the Chinese Communist Party or other official sources in China. For example, Xi deems loyalty to China, to the Communist Party, and to him as being one and the same. He has upended the communism principle of rule by a committee of equals to place himself on top of a hierarchy that is not allowed by communism.\n\nBoth the writing of the book and narration of the audio version are dry and uninspiring. Perhaps this dryness is inevitable for a book derived from speeches, writings, and policies, rather than from insider accounts and personal interviews. But the latter style would be quite impractical in the case of the Chinese leader.\n\n2024/08/02 (Friday): Presenting selected news, useful info, and oddities from around the Internet.\n\n(1) Images of the day: [Left] Getting rid of prickles in plants (see the next item below).

You can get rid of the prickles (the correct word for thorns) altogether and have flowers only: Pure, beautiful flowers!

Kellogg in the August 2, 2024, issue of Science, \"Plant prickles are controlled by genes involved in the final step of cytokinin biosynthesis.\"\n\nFrom another article by Satterlee et al., we learn that \"homologous genes control prickle formation in all of these species [that have prickles],\" providing an answer to the question of how similar features are developed on unrelated organisms.\n\n(3) Time-wasting steps in stores and on-line: Lately, one has to answer a few questions on the grocery-store keypad, before being allowed to proceed with payment. Charity round-ups and other donations are the usual culprits. If I want to help a charity, I will do it at the time and in the amount of my choosing. A random few cents isn't my idea of helping.\n\nThe situation is worse on-line. You want to do on-line banking? First, you have to read ads about special offers, then scroll to the bottom of the ad, before you are allowed to do your business. On-line message in-boxes, which are intended for urgent messages/alerts to customers, are routinely filled with ads and offers.\n\nI often complain to merchants who waste my time in this way, but the complaint seldom results in changes. Taking your business elsewhere is the only way to get back at such merchants.\n\n(4) Book review: Harris, Annaka, Conscious: A Brief Guide to the Fundamental Mystery of the Mind, HarperCollins, 2019. [My 5-star review of this book on GoodReads]\n\nScience writer Annaka Harris, who happens to be the spouse of Sam Harris, focuses on neuroscience and physics. In this 130-page gem of a book, Harris does a phenomenal job of exposing the mysteries of the mind, consciousness, and free will. She doesn't waste any time before attempting to define consciousness, quoting Thomas Nagel's \"What Is It Like to Be a Bat?\":\n\n\"An organism is conscious if there is something that it is like to be that organism.\"\n\nNow considering the spectrum of organisms \"bacterium, oak tree, worm, ant, mouse, dog, human\" at some point along the sequence, the answer to the question \"Is there something that it is like to be that organism\" turns from \"no\" to \"yes.\" The question that has occupied us for centuries is why the light turns on for some collections of matter in the universe but not for others.\n\nHarris takes her working definition of consciousness and runs with it to discuss intuitions and illusions (Chapter 2), our brain being free when it decides to act in a certain way based on inputs received but the case for conscious free will being more shaky (Chapter 3), how the way certain parasites that affect the behavior of their hosts turn our intuition of free will upside-down (Chapter 4), who we are, or the notion of \"self\" (Chapter 5), whether consciousness is everywhere, referred to as panpsychism, and not a property of only certain collections of matter (Chapter 6), whether consciousness exists without thinking or even any inputs to our brain (Chapter 7), and the relationship between the mystery of consciousness and the mystery of time (Chapter 8).\n\nTime sits squarely at the center of most physical mysteries, including consciousness. The two views of time are known as presentism (only the present is real and the perceived one-way movement of time is an illusion) and eternalism (just because we are at a certain instant of time doesn't mean that other instants do not exist). \"As we continue to look out from our planet and contemplate the nature of reality, we should remember that there is a mystery right here where we stand.\" [the book's final sentence, p. 110]\n\n2024/08/01 (Thursday): Presenting selected news, useful info, and oddities from around the Internet.\n\n(1) Images of the day: [Left] Soccer star Nadia Nadim (see the next item below).

He has been the subject of controversies over his sociopolitical views, including musings about progressives who don't believe in progress and the claim that racist attitudes in the US declined during the Trump regime. However, none of these detracts from my respect for him as a scientist.\n\nHaving recently read linguist Amanda Montell's Wordslut (my review), a condemnation of language's role in oppressing women and treating them as social miscreants (e.g., via the usage of the words \"slut\" and \"bitch\"), I jumped at the chance of reading Pinker's broader study of language as a window into human nature. Pinker's eloquence is on full display in this wonderful book.\n\nPinker theorizes that language functions at two levels at all times. Using the example \"If you could pass the salt, that would be great,\" he points to a dilemma faced by the requester, who does not want to be seen as ordering people around while also wanting to have them pass the salt; hence, the polite non-request in lieu of a direct request. I would add to Pinker's two levels a third level known as \"doublespeak\": The use of language to deceive, control, and oppress.\n\nPinker's The Stuff of Thought overlaps with Montell's Wordslut when he discusses the syntax of swearing and swear words in the chapter \"The Seven Words You Can't Say on Television\" (Pinker later published a book by this title). Why we swear, how taboos change over time, and how we use obscenities in different ways, are among the fascinating questions addressed in this chapter. Why do so many swear words involve sex, bodily functions, and religion? Why would a democracy deter the use of words for two activities, sex and excretion, that harm no one?\n\nThere is a lot more in Pinker's tour de force. Our use of prepositions & tenses taps into the human concepts of space and time, and our nouns & verbs speak to our notions of matter. Even how we name our babies has important things to say about our relations to our children and to society.\n\nI highly recommend this brilliantly-crafted and highly readable book to anyone who is curious about the development of language and how it is driven by and mirrors human nature.\n\n2024/07/30 (Tuesday): Presenting selected news, useful info, and oddities from around the Internet.\n\n(1) Images of the day: [left] Cover feature of Sciecne magazine on air pollution (see the next item below).

When we notice it, it is usually because of suspended dust, smoke, ash, or haze. Such particulatesâalong with harmful gases, chemical vapors, and suspended biological agentsâconstitute air pollution. The health and environmental effects of exposure to air pollutants have long been apparent and are now increasingly well documented in terms of overall life expectancy as well as incidence of asthma, cancer, and cardiopulmonary disease.\" [Issue of July 26, 2024]\n\n(3) Book review: Nussbaum, Emily, Cue the Sun: The Invention of Reality TV, unabridged 15-hour audiobook, read by Gabra Zackman, Random House Audio, 2024. [My 4-star review of this book on GoodReads]\n\nDescribed derisively as \"dirty documentaries\" and flatteringly as \"unscripted series,\" reality TV shows are much older than most people think. Besides game shows, which go way back, an early program in the genre was \"Candid Camera,\" which recorded behaviors and reactions of unsuspecting observers of peculiar, artificially-created events for comic effect. The program had radio roots in \"The Candid Microphone,\" also created and hosted by Allen Funt.\n\nThe modern embodiments of the genre range from low-budget program fillers to megahits such as \"Survivor,\" \"Big Brother,\" and \"The Bachelor.\" The shows elicit reactions from contempt to fascination, sometimes both at the same time. Many audience members watch them while holding their noses. Some of the most-successful embodiments of the genre use conflict and embarrassment as tools to create situations that draw in audiences, who are sometimes conflicted and/or embarrassed to watch.\n\nWith the exception of \"Candid Camera\" and a few competition programs, such as \"American Idol,\" I had little interest in reality TV, so I was drawn to this book to learn what all the fuss was about. I was surprised to find out that early interest in reality TV was in part motivated by making the networks' programming strike-proof.\n\nNussbaum covers much ground in the first 12 chapters:\n\n- The Reveal: Queen for a Day and Candid Camera\n\n- The Gong: The Filthy, Farkakte Chuck Barris 1970s\n\n- The Betrayal: An American Family\n\n- The Clip: America's Funniest Home Videos and Cops\n\n- The House: The Real World\n\n- The Con: The Nihilistic Fox '90s\n\n- The Game: The Invention of Survivor (and Mark Burnett)\n\n- The Island: Survivor: Borneo\n\n- The Feed: Big Brother\n\n- The Explosion: Reality Blows Up and Becomes an Industry\n\n- The Rose: The Bachelor and Joe Millionaire\n\n- The Wink: Bravo and the Gentrification of Reality TV\n\nGiven Donald Trump's rise to the US presidency owing, in large part, to his reality NBC show \"The Apprentice,\" Nussbaum had really no choice but to include him in the narrative, which she does in the final Chapter 13. \"Taking a failed tycoon who was heavily in hock and too risky for almost any bank to lend to, a crude, impulsive, bigoted, multiply-bankrupt ignoramus, a sexual predator so reckless he openly harassed women on his show, then finding a way to make him look attractive enough to elect as president of the United States?

[My 4-star review of this book on GoodReads]\n\nHawking considers this book a sequel to A Brief History of Time, a hugely successful science book that sold a copy for every 750 Earth inhabitants and was translated into dozens of languages. The Universe in a Nutshell aims to update the public about developments since the 1988 book was published. Summaries of the book's 7 chapters follow.\n\nChapter 1 offers simplified explanations of Einstein's Special/General Theory of Relativity, which form the bases of almost all modern concepts of our universe.\n\nChapter 2 uses Einstein's theories and some of Hawking's own groundbreaking work to show how time can come to a stop when mass collapses to super-density.\n\nChapter 3 uses Einstein's theories and quantum mechanics to view the universe as a set of different \"histories,\" and discusses the ongoing work on a unified theory.\n\nChapter 4 considers time and the possibility of looking forward into the future, suggesting that black holes might destroy the info we try to glean about the future.\n\nChapter 5 notes that even though a sufficiently advanced civilization should be able to visit the past, tiny success probabilities make this feat practically impossible.\n\nChapter 6 theorizes that ever-increasing speed of technological and biological advancements will make future humans orders-of-magnitude more complex than us.\n\nChapter 7 updates the so-called \"string theory\" with \"p-brane\" theory, which includes the disturbing possibility that our entire universe is just a hologram.\n\n2024/07/27 (Saturday): Presenting selected news, useful info, and oddities from around the Internet.\n\n(1) Images of the day: [Top left] The 2024 Paris Olympics begins with a fanfare.

There were ~50 attendees.\n\nMs. Zaimi began by reviewing the four waves of feminism, emerging shortly after the French Revolution, in which women played a big part.\n\nFirst Wave: 1800s-1920s\n\nSecond Wave: 1960s-1970s\n\nThird Wave: 1990s-now\n\nFourth Wave: 2010s-now\n\nFor each of the four waves of feminism, Ms. Zaimi presented key sources/events (e.g., books/thinkers) that drove the movement.\n\nThe word \"feminism,\" which had been used pejoratively to refer to men who were not viewed as being sufficiently masculine, assumed its modern meaning in 1948.\n\nIn the second part of her talk, Ms. Zaimi focused on women's movements in Iran, discussing among other thigs, the role of women in ancient Persia, struggles over voting rights, religious fundamentalism that led to numerous misogynistic laws and many campaigns that oppose them.\n\n2024/07/26 (Friday): Today, I write about a 2-day educational/training retreat I attened in Malibu.\n\n(1) Reflections on a teacher-training retreat in Malibu, California: I have been involved with NAMI (National Alliance for Mental Illness) for several months now. NAMI strives to create a better tomorrow where all people affected by mental illness can experience hope, recovery, and wellness in a world free of stigma.\n\nFollowing my attendance at a NAMI Family-to-Family class, I volunteered and was chosen to attend a 2-day training program for individuals who want to help by leading Family-to-Family classes. The training program was held Wed.-Thu., July 24-25, 2024, at Serra Retreat, in the beautiful hills of Malibu, California. The Retreat is at the site of an old mansion which was purchased by a religious organization and dedicated to use as a retreat center for various groups.\n\nThe 2-day program was packed with advice on how to conduct a course, how to avoid giving misleading information by strictly following the content guidelines, how to monitor class participants for signs of distress, and how to deal with disruptions and emergencies.\n\n(2) On scaling up efforts to spread public awareness of mental illness: Much has been written about the sorry state of mental healthcare in the US. Despite some improvement due to efforts of National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI), of which I am a member and a volunteer, and similar organizations, lack of public awareness of various diagnoses and the associated social stigma persists. NAMI has educational programs that raise public awareness and provide tools for family members impacted by the illness of a loved one to help them in navigating mental-health services and understanding the range of diagnoses and treatment options.\n\nI recently read the book The Genius of Israel, by Dan Senor and Saul Singer, which is about the remarkable social resilience of the small nation, which remains happy and optimistic in the face of internal challenges a"
