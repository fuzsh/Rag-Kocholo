        "text": "Introduction\n\nWhat Does the Elephant Look Like?\n\nAn elephant was brought into a small town. The townspeople, who had never seen an elephant before, gathered outside the place where the animal was housed, curious as to what the beast was like. The night had fallen, and it was pitch dark, but they insisted on entering to find out as much as they could. The next day, when those who had been unable to go in asked the lucky observers, So, what is an elephant like? the answers were intriguing. Those who had touched the elephant’s foot said, O, the animal is like a big, thick column! while those who had felt the trunk insisted that it was more like a drain pipe. The few who had reached up and touched the ear objected to both descriptions. In fact, they said, an elephant is very much the shape of a large fan.\n\nRumi, the thirteenth-century Persian poet, related this tale in the Masnavi, his major book on mystical thought. He concluded it simply to drive his point home: If they each had a candle, they would all be looking at the same beast. The story itself is much older than Rumi. It has traveled through many cultures, each of which has created its own variation on the theme of the dangers of partial or distorted vision. It is time for us to retell the story in the twenty-first century in the United States of America to articulate one of the biggest challenges of our time. The challenge is to see each other’s humanity, and the question is: where are the candles?\n\nA cursory look around suggests ample opportunities to learn about each other. Our globe gets smaller by the day. We can now physically visit the most reticent of cultures. And new electronic means of contact develop daily: satellite images, Web logs, virtual chat rooms, text messaging, and more. E-mail is already looking outmoded and old-fashioned. And we have—proudly—chosen to name this the information age. Yet we know, deep down, that there are important gaps in what our information sources tell us about the world. This is particularly true of places such as the Muslim Middle East from which we perceive a sense of threat, though how much of a threat, and how to deal with it, we know not.\n\nIn short, since 9/11, knowing about the Muslim Middle East is not a luxury, it is a matter of life and death. We need to know if they and their many constellations of cultures out there are really the media-packaged, neat rows of prayer driven by faith, emotion, and instinct. We hear that some blow themselves up just so someone else might die in the process. It feels so unnatural, so wrong. Didn’t these same people write delightful poetry at one time? Didn’t they carve exquisite calligraphy on their window panes and even doorknobs? Didn’t they welcome an exiled Jewish community fleeing Spain in the late fifteenth century? What happened? Something says we must find a candle, for there has to be more to the elephant.\n\nWe reach out to anyone who might be able to tell us something: natives exiled in the United States, academics specializing on the subject, journalists who travel the world, people conducting business in the Middle East, tourists, anyone. These are our eyewitnesses, if they care to talk about what they have seen. And some do care to talk. Whether they lived over there for years or visited for a month, whether they speak the language well or know only a few standard phrases, they do their best to describe what they saw in the light of the candle they carried or what they managed to feel in the dark.\n\nSome of these writings are of excellent quality, academic in nature, and meant to address a very small specialized audience. Others, growing in number, are writings addressed to the educated but nonexpert reader. And the nonexpert reader is consuming these works in vast quantities, if the sales statistics are any indication. It is these nonspecialized, eyewitness accounts that I believe we need to examine carefully. They sparked the urgent need I felt to write Jasmine and Stars: Reading More than Lolita in Tehran.\n\nIn this volume, I have two specific goals. The first is to bring you an in-depth critical understanding of this eyewitness literature, which I dub the New Orientalist narrative. But the second and equally important goal is to provide an alternative approach for learning about an unfamiliar culture. Let me first tell you why I believe the proliferation of a New Orientalist narrative calls for serious scrutiny. Why do I consider this new narrative as silencing as its predecessor authored by the nineteenth-century European Orientalists?\n\nThe old Orientalist narrative, traceable mostly in the writings of European philologists, justified the colonial presence of Europe in the Eastern Hemisphere. It did not always do so by advocating a full military presence in the region (though sometimes that was stated too). Rather, it did so by narrating in clearly inferior terms everything from the language to the physiology of the natives. If something, the poetry written in the local language, for example, was too impressive to be considered inferior, it would be attributed to a glorious but discontinued past. Alternatively, a foreign source of influence would be discovered for that which appeared to be creative and complex.\n\nDespite narrating the East in this vein, many Orientalists were devoted to the study of their subject sincerely. They studied with great care every minute detail in the semantics of the local language or in documents recording the region’s historical events. But they believed—with the same sincerity—that the natives had little to contribute to a better understanding of these subjects. Indeed many felt that they knew the natives better than the natives knew themselves. Despite their scholarly devotion, through the finality of their silencing voice, they denied the locals their natural presence and psychologically dispossessed them of the intricacies of their culture.\n\nThe emerging Orientalist narrative has many similarities to and a few differences from this earlier incarnation. It equally simplifies its subject. For example, it explains almost all undesirable Middle Eastern incidents in terms of Muslim men’s submission to God and Muslim women’s submission to men. The old narrative was imbued with the authority of an all-knowing foreign expert. The emerging narrative varies somewhat in that it might have a native—or seminative—insider tone. Furthermore, as the product of a self-questioning era, it shows a relative awareness of its own possible shortcomings. Yet it replicates the earlier narrative’s strong undercurrent of superiority and of impatience with the locals, who are often portrayed as uncomplicated. The new narrative does not necessarily support overt colonial ambitions. But it does not hide its clear preference for a western political and cultural takeover. Most importantly, it replicates the totalizing—and silencing—tendencies of the old Orientalists by virtue of erasing, through unnuanced narration, the complexity and richness in the local culture.\n\nSome of the best-known recent examples of this narrative are in works such as Nine Parts of Desire: The Hidden World of Islamic Women, by Geraldine Brookes (Anchor Books, 1995); The Bookseller of Kabul, by Åsne Seierstad (Little, Brown, 2003); Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books, by Azar Nafisi (Random House, 2003); and The Kite Runner, by Khaled Husseini (Riverhead Books, 2003). I should hasten to add that these works vary in quality and deserve to be looked at individually. Indeed, if this emerging type of writing continues to grow in literary and social significance, a comparative study could be of interest. For our discussion, I will be focused mostly on what these works have in common.\n\nWhile the popularity of the works I have mentioned has a direct correlation to their promise to make sense of the baffling Middle East, there is more to their success. They often have an informal tone and a hybrid nature that make for an accessible read. Most of them blend travel writing, personal memoir, journalistic reporting, and social commentary. They show awareness of the power of personal voice, nostalgia in exilic literature, the assurance that comes with insider knowledge, and the certainty of eyewitness accounts. Yet they do not demand that readers have an in-depth knowledge of the culture on which the book is focused. Neither do they provide such readers, at the end of the eventful journey, with more than a chance for a feel of the elephant in the dark. Jasmine and Stars: Reading More than Lolita in Tehran provides a closer look at this emerging literature as it unfolds its own alternative cultural perspective.\n\nGeneral observations about the New Orientalist narrative will not get us too far. Even universal values find their true meaning in tangible local settings. I will now turn to specifics to flesh out generality and abstraction. For this purpose, I have selected a specific title from the above list as my case in point. I will return to this example to substantiate my critique of the New Orientalist perspective as I move forward with my own narrative and arguments. The example that I have chosen is one that I feel the strongest about and am most qualified to critique, namely Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books, by Azar Nafisi (henceforth called RLT for brevity). The book has focused attention on gender issues in contemporary Iran and moved many readers with its personalized critique of totalitarianism. In the process of presenting you with my own Jasmine and Stars, however, I will provide a candid reading of the serious flaws in this work. Please bear in mind that my goal is larger than to quarrel with RLT. For what ultimately matters is not the irrefutable proof of the shortcomings of the feel-in-the-dark method that the book uses but the promise of my own narrative to take the reader more fully into the rich and complex world of the Middle East, to begin to read more than Lolita in Tehran. Only if my voice fills something of the existing void can I hope to have provided a candle to remove—or at least reduce—the depth of the dark. But first, how do I propose to contribute to the debate?\n\nWe are entering an era of transnationalism. This is not because compartmentalizing devices that operate through loyalty to class, nation, religion, and the like have lost their grip on us. In fact, from time to time, there are alarming indications of sharpening polarizations. But there is an undercurrent of good news that is growing stronger. We take pride in resisting authority, in being self-critical and demanding. We consider all knowledge to be partial and understand all human perspectives, insider or otherwise, to be vulnerable to personal preference, class loyalty, and political affiliation. The multiplying Web logs and virtual chat rooms may not be reliable information sources. But they have made us aware of a very important fact: the presence of other voices.\n\nFor every newly erected wall, many barriers fall down. For every newly established border, many existing boundaries lose their meaning. Exilic voices are no longer sole windows into the culture they come from. Neither are journalistic ventures into the territory of the Other few and far between. We are blessed with access to multiple voices. Recognizing the value of this multiplicity and putting it to good use is our hope for breaking out of totalizing narratives. It may not be easy to see our full human potential for crossing borders, for living outside boxes, for embracing the freedom of dwelling on thresholds. But our survival instincts tell us that good things happen when we object to becoming cogs in the system.\n\nIn the faint voices that reach us from across the globe, there is the recognition of our shared humanity. In laughing at the same joke, feeling the same pain, or admiring each other’s work of art, there is an empowering flash of recognition. Through the brilliance of that flash, a voice says, I know you are more than a number in the global statistics, because your grandmother looks exactly like mine. It doesn’t matter if my Tuesday is Wednesday on your calendar. I have a little gray cat, and if you are brave enough to build a bridge, my cat and I might walk over. At times, it is hard to even contemplate the building of the bridge. But the excitement at the thought of a person and a gray cat from the other hemisphere walking in our direction is proof that we will never be totally self-absorbed or a nameless cog in the system. Not if we can help it.\n\nThis is what I am setting out to do. In Jasmine and Stars, I carefully and painstakingly weave a multihued tapestry of human voice and experience. I turn my narrating voice into a vehicle for the rainbow of the faces and words that filled my childhood and youth in Iran. I will not select any particular time period, target any specific political movement, privilege any class or gender, or handpick any specific social event. This is no ideological war for or against any. It is designed to be a meaningful excursion into modern-day Iran: a culture as charming, creative, humorous, and humane as any. A culture that has much to offer the world.\n\nYou will laugh and cry with me and all the ordinary Iranians you will meet, some from my own family and many I could not myself have met. The compelling voices you will hear will not be those of politicians and ideologues, but of writers and poets as well as family members and friends. Some have kindled the imagination of millions of Iranians from centuries past to this very day. The rest are known only to me and a few others, but their presence has equally brightened my life.\n\nAs my narrative, enlivened with these voices, reaches out to your imagination to uphold the possibility of the bridge, there is a way to test our success. If we have succeeded in transcending the I-know-the-elephant attitude, the recognition of the multiplicity of voices will empower us to resist all totalizing and silencing efforts. We will object to the imposing vision of a revolution that stifles the power to dream. We will also object to the totalizing tendencies of a narrative such as RLT, which reduces the genesis and flow of that revolution to the actions of a few villains. But most important, we will begin to forge our own way of reading more than Lolita in Tehran, or in any place else. The trick is to listen for the seemingly insignificant voices that carry the wisdom, tenderness, beauty, and humor in a culture, to open the door and let them into the safety of our recognition. If there are brighter candles, I have yet to find them.\n\nLet me now take a moment to explain why I have chosen Nafisi’s RLT as exemplifying the New Orientalist narrative that I critique. This was one of the twenty-first century’s best-selling titles. It was soon included in many book club reading lists and assigned in undergraduate classrooms across the nation. Most readers, however, do not know that the book has spurred a furious debate among American Muslims—Iranian Americans, in particular. Many, myself included, believe that its selective and exaggerated account of life in postrevolutionary Iran enforces a harmful, widespread stereotype of Iranians so distorted as to make them seem subhuman. To say that the book hinders intercultural exchange is putting it mildly. A critique of such damaging mispresentations of Iran is overdue.\n\nMy second reason for using this work is that, as a literary scholar who deals with texts on a daily basis, I am perplexed by the book’s specific use of literature. RLT benefits from reading a range of good Western literature to understand the cultural change taking place in the early decades of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. However, it shows no awareness whatsoever of the lively and controversial literature created in Iran itself in the years prior to, during, and after the revolution. In fact, it suggests a total absence of interest in literature by the local culture.\n\nDespite the intensely political arguments that RLT stirred, especially in the Iranian American community, I will not address the author’s personal politics and motivation. I am interested in the making and impact of the perspective that RLT, and works of its kind, represent. As a teacher and scholar of literature, I feel we should take very seriously the distorting and silencing power that such texts exercise on our culture and society.\n\nPersian/comparative literature and Islamic cultures are the subjects of my research and teaching at Washington University in St. Louis. Discussions and debates associated with these subjects go beyond my classroom, affecting my life and the life of the community in which I live. Like a cat carrying its newborns to safety, I hold my students close as we hunt for balanced and engaging literature that might save their critical faculty from the numbing assault of the media, particularly when it comes to discussions of Iran and Islam. The feel-in-the-dark method of describing life in Iran, evidenced in works such as RLT, further hampers the critical ability to question the narrow and slanted vision provided by the popular media.\n\nMy own contribution, Jasmine and Stars, is a literary and cultural analysis long in the making. I introduce you to many Iranian writers and thinkers little known in the United States, blending the presentation of their work with historical and social commentary. Yet I keep my personal voice in the foreground. Everything in the book is centered on my own personal stories, even when I reach out to classical Sufi masters to illustrate a point. Jasmine and Stars is a celebration of the common humanity shared among peoples of differing circumstances—religious, cultural, and geopolitical. I hope it will expose the irrelevance of prevalent stereotypes about Iranian Muslim culture.\n\nThe jasmine and stars in this book’s title are metaphors for what filled my childhood and youth—which were by no means trouble free—with culturally specific inspirations that have brought me to where I am. I hope my account of the people, events, and books that nurtured me is enjoyable for you to read. More important, I hope it plants the seeds of interest in learning about aspects of Persian and Muslim life not yet known to most American readers.\n\nI believe my readers deserve to partake of the peaceful and enriching gifts that Iran has to offer. I envision you seeking out the writings of Forough Farrokhzad, the vibrant Iranian woman poet of the twentieth century, or Shahrnush Parsipur, the Iranian author of the novella Women without Men, after you read about their works in this book. I hope you read these works and enjoy them; if you are a teacher, I hope you decide to share them with your students. I even envision some of you—college students, for example—deciding to pursue the Persian language, thinking, \"That way, I can read the Conference of the Birds for myself.\"\n\nAnd now, more about myself. Before everything else, I am an Iranian American woman. I grew up in the historic city of Shiraz in southwest Iran, where I went to school and university. Later, I received a doctorate in Near Eastern studies from London University. I am a Muslim, a feminist, a literary scholar, and a poet, though not always in that order. I have lived and worked in the United States since 1987. I visit Iran every year and stay for anywhere from weeks to months at a time. When I am there, I see relatives, catch up with high school and university friends, buy books, visit universities and other institutions of learning, and connect with Iranian poets and scholars. Iran and America are both my home. Both make me delighted and furious at short and frequent intervals.\n\nI have lived, studied, worked, and felt at home on three continents. If I had to define myself further, I would say I am an activist who believes we must speak and act for peace and for betterment in the world. Writing and teaching Persian and comparative literature are my academic profession, but they are also ways of attaining these ideals. I have not been employed officially in an Iranian university since the 1979 revolution and the ascendancy of the Islamic Republic. When I go to Iran for a visit, I wear the head scarf that is now mandated by the constitution. I do not wear the scarf while outside Iran, and in principle, I like people to be able to choose what they wear.\n\nNafisi, the author of RLT, taught literature in Iranian universities in the two decades following the 1979 revolution. For a period of time she stopped working as a sign of her opposition to wearing the head scarf. Then she returned to teaching, and her book on the Russian writer Nabokov was published by the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Guidance in 1994. Toward the end of her stay in Iran, she started a private class in her house for seven of her female students. In this class, they read and discussed world literature. RLT is centered on exchanges in this class. It is the author’s account of her life experience in the Islamic Republic of Iran during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nI share many of the ideals cherished in this book. Gender equality, freedom of the press, freedom of the academic world, and the right of religious minorities to unrestricted practice of their faiths are among the most important. Reforming election laws would be another crucial step toward a more inclusive political space. The many Iranians who share these ideals and work hard to make them a social reality should be particularly commended for working their way through the complicated process of social and political change."
