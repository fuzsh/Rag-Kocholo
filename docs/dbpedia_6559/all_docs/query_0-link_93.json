If you want to understand Chuck Eddy for real, you need to focus on the music he hates. And this is not because his taste is irrefutable or because there’s some sort of larger truth imbedded within his vitriol—it’s because the music Chuck Eddy hates shows how his mind works. Take a look at this list: 1. Björk; 2. dj Spooky; 3. Robyn Hitchcock; 4. Iron Maiden; 5. Jodeci; 6. Korn; 7. My Bloody Valentine; 8. Notorious B.I.G.; 9. Pantera; 10. Henry Rollins. These are the artists Eddy submitted (at some point in the mid-to-late 1990s) as “The Worst Music Ever,” a list published in Philadelphia’s City Paper. In many ways, the list encapsulates the mathematical superstructure of Eddy’s cerebellum: we have one band that every critic loves, two acts that every critic pretends to love, a dead man critics are obligated to appreciate, two metal acts that most people don’t take seriously (but that Chuck takes seriously enough to hate), one band that people might expect Chuck to support, a singer-songwriter nobody thinks about, the commonsense recognition of an obvious buffoon, and Jodeci. I do not doubt that if someone asked Eddy to make that list today, at least seven of the selections would be different. In fact, they all might be different. But I am certain the underlying Eddy ethos would remain: “All thoughts about music are valid, but most thoughts about music are backwards.” Not all thoughts about music, but most thoughts about music (and certainly those thoughts coming from all the people who are supposed to know better). And it’s not just that these thoughts are flawed—it’s that the people thinking them know that they’re flawed. They know they’re promoting (or attacking) artists for reasons that have almost nothing to do with the music itself. When Chuck hears a pop song, it’s like he is the first person who has ever heard it; he’s certainly aware of what the rest of the world already wants\n\nto believe, but those pre-existing perceptions are never convincing to him. If anything, they push him in the opposite direction. They galvanize his darkest suspicions. Chuck Eddy is his own man, and sometimes he’s the only man. I will never forget the day in 1992 my friend Rex purchased Stairway to Hell at a B. Dalton in Grand Forks, N.D. Rex walked into my dorm room and said, “You gotta read this fucking book, man. Some crazy guy has ranked the 500 greatest metal albums of all time, and four of them are by Kix. And you know how many are by Mötley Crüe? None!” This was a lot of information to absorb. First of all, I could not believe that there would ever be a book that would mention Kix, unless it was a book about cereal. I also could not believe that any book celebrating Kix would somehow not celebrate Mötley Crüe, a group that struck me as superior in every possible way. But more than anything, I simply could not believe that there was a book about heavy metal, and that this book cost money and existed in stores, and that the adult writing this book seemed to think about Faster Pussycat and Rush in the same way I thought about them in my parents’ basement. I disagreed with at least half of the author’s opinions and I hated the sans serif font, but the writing style obliterated my skull—it felt like some brilliant weirdo was talking directly at me, yet with no regard whatsoever for how much I enjoyed the conversation. To this day, I’ve never found a nonfiction book with more voice-per-square-inch than Stairway to Hell. It was so funny. It was so maddening. It made no sense. Jimi Hendrix was boring? White Lion was a blues band? Black Sabbath was a jazz band? Poison’s sec­ ond record was better than Houses Of The Holy? How could someone with a real job like Poison more than I did? How could someone overrate Poison? And why did this writer seem to mock all the bands he was classifying as important? Moreover, why did he keep mentioning artists who had absolutely no relationship to heavy metal, most notably disco diva Teena Marie (whose Emerald City was ranked in the Top 10)? The answer, as it turns out, was sleeping in the introduction: Teena Marie, Eddy argued, would be “accepted with open arms by all headbangers in the perfect universe of my imagination (which exists in metal’s life span because I do!)” It took me years to understand what that sentence truly meant, but it’s the premise behind everything meaningful Eddy creates (regardless of the genre or the performer). Very often, a person reading Chuck Eddy’s work will conclude, “Oh, come on. No person could ever\n\nxii foreword\n\nthink that.” But the fact that they’re actively reading those (seemingly unbelievable) thoughts proves that such thinking exists. More than any other critic, Chuck Eddy showed how the experience of listening to music was both intellectually limitless and acutely personal. There was no “correct” way to hear a song, and there were no fixed parameters on how that song could be described in print, and if that song made you reconsider abortion or the Oakland Raiders or your father’s suicide, then that intellectual relationship mattered (because your engagement was real). I didn’t want to write like Chuck Eddy, but I wanted to think like him. For most of the ’90s, I wondered who Chuck Eddy was. I knew he was from Detroit and that he’d served in the army, but that was the extent of my tangible knowledge. He was a literary monolith in the zine world, but I didn’t really read zines; he’d write reviews for Spin and insist that a certain guitar player sounded like what would have happened if Billy Duffy had liked Tony Iommi more than Jimmy Page, and I would spend two days trying to figure out if that was a compliment. I found an Entertainment Weekly review online where he gave the Pet Shop Boys’ Discography an A and Mötley Crüe’s Decade Of Decadence an A-minus, which partially contradicted his first book and somehow made me feel better. He wrote an essay about the sociopolitical brilliance of Michael Jackson’s Dangerous that seemed ridiculous for 18 years, until it suddenly became prescient. I read his second book, The Accidental Evolution of Rock’n’Roll, but I think it just confused me. I bought a Status Quo album. I saw his picture in a magazine’s contributors’ page and was surprised he wore a hat. To me, Chuck Eddy was way more famous than most of the bands he wrote about. I wondered if he was as sarcastic in person as he was in print. I wondered if he was happy with his life. I wondered if he named his kid Linus because he liked Peanuts. I wondered if he thought Oasis was cool. I wondered about a lot of things, which is what you do when something changes your life. Just before I published Fargo Rock City in 2001, I contacted Eddy by e-mail, theoretically to convince him to blurb the cover but really because I wanted him to know that I knew that I never would have written my book if I hadn’t come across Stairway to Hell first. Throughout the decade that’s followed, we’ve usually sent each other one or two e-mails a year, usually for some semi-work-related matter. And because we have the same first name, he always signs his emails “The Other Chuck.” That’s his signature, and I’m sure he types it casually and without thinking. To him, it has no\n\nforeword xiii\n\nmeaning. But it always makes me uncomfortable, because it’s so totally wrong. He is not the Other Chuck. I am the Other Chuck. Only Chuck Eddy can be Chuck. He was the first Chuck and the better Chuck. And that will never change, even after all the kids that Kix was made for are deader than the diplodocus.\n\nxiv foreword\n\nacknowledgments\n\nTop of the list, I have to thank Ken Wissoker, for backing this project and giving me the flexibility to pull it off; my wife, Lalena Fisher, for putting up with me while I did so; Robert Christgau, who was hugely instrumental in my making this questionable career choice to begin with; and Chuck Klosterman, for writing a foreword that made me blush. Phil Dellio, Frank Kogan, and Richard Riegel provided some invaluable advice on what pieces to include when I first started brainstorming—not to mention Xeroxes of old writing and correspondence I hadn’t seen for several years. Here are some, but by no means all, of the editors who first published these pieces, often polishing them in the process: Doug Simmons, Eric Weisbard, Rob Harvilla, and Christgau (again) at the Village Voice; Dave DiMartino, Bill Holdship, and John Kordosh at Creem; Milo Miles at the Boston Phoenix; John Payne at L.A. Weekly; Nathan Brackett at Rolling Stone; Greg Boyd and Bill Reynolds at Eye Weekly; Jack Thompson at Swellsville; Andrew Palmer at Where’s The Snake; Jeff Pike at Tapeworm; Kogan (again) at Why Music Sucks; Dellio (again) at Radio On; William Bloody Swygart at Singles Jukebox. Several pieces I’ve included were specifically reprinted with permission from the Village Voice and from creem Media, Inc. (And I should probably also mention here that a few of the pieces have been altered, very slightly, from their original published form for purposes of clarity and accuracy. Pretty sure you don’t have much use for old record label mailing addresses from 1984, for instance.) I’ve been stealing opinions outright from Metal Mike Saunders, Scott Seward, and George Smith for decades now. My kids—William, Cordelia, Sherman, and Annika—have taught me more since 1985, 1989, 1991, and 2008 than I’ll ever hope to teach them. And I’d be remiss if I didn’t thank these folks as well, just for jump-starting my thinking process and working as intellectual foils and/or plus-ones over the years: Charles Aaron, Don Allred, Kevin John Bozelka, Tom Breihan, Jon Caramanica, Nick Catucci,\n\nEd Christman, Hillary Chute, Joshua Clover, Jonathan Cohen, Chris Cook, Don Forst, Michael Freedberg, Christian Hoard, Edd Hurt, Steve Kiviat, Martina Kominiarek, Michaelangelo Matos, Rob Michaels, David Cooper Moore, Amy Phillips, Ann Powers, Mike Rubin, Rob Sheffield, Sara Sherr, Richard C. Walls, Chris Weingarten, Bill Werde, Mikael Wood, Scott Woods. If I left you out, it doesn’t mean I’m not thankful—it probably just means the Alzheimer’s is settling in.\n\nxvi acknowledgments\n\nintroduction\n\nHere’s the first thing: none of this happened on purpose. I never intended to be a music critic—much less somebody who’d make some semblance of a living at it for more than a quarter century. It just happened. I could just as well have been a paleontologist. But somewhere around 1972, when I was 11 or 12—not long before my dad died, which was a couple years after my mom died, so call it therapy if you’re so inclined—I started reading the sports pages. Or maybe it was a couple years before that; my childhood timeline is all screwed up in my head, and I do have fuzzy memories of reading headlines about “Reds” in the Cincinnati Enquirer, I guess it would’ve been, and thinking the article would concern Pete Rose but finding out it concerned Russians instead. (Is that even possible?) Anyway, my family left Ohio in 1970; if ’72 is right, I would’ve been reading the Detroit Free Press, same paper I wound up delivering to 50 or so subscribers in North Potomac Green subdivision every morning before sunrise for a couple years, often tromping through two feet of virgin Michigan snow. I also regularly devoured the Sporting News and Baseball Digest. And somewhere in there, I decided I wanted to be a sportswriter. Despite, or maybe because of, being really bad at sports. So I started keeping a little diary about baseball (other sports were just time-killers between the World Series and spring training), filing notes every night in a green hard-covered date book, which wound up in the garbage somewhere along the way. And when I started at West Bloomfield High School in the autumn of 1974, I signed up right away to work on the school newspaper, the Spectrum. My first article was about baseball cards, and I talked about how the Topps 1969 Aurelio Rodriguez card erroneously pictured the Angels’ batboy instead, which I called an honest mistake since they were both Mexicans—in retrospect, a somewhat racially insensitive assertion. Eventually, I wound up reporting lots of other sports stories, mostly on our school teams, the Lakers, who wore green and white. For\n\na couple years, I was even the “manager” for the junior varsity baseball team, basically a glorified way of saying “scorekeeper.” And “batboy.” I took part in other extracurricular activities as well, mostly as a way of escaping my increasingly traumatic homelife. In the 1978 edition of the school’s annual yearbook, Exodus, here’s what’s listed after my name: “Debate 1, 4; J.V. Soccer 2, 3; Gong Show 3; J.V. Baseball 1, 2 (Manager); Powderpuff Cheerleader 3; NHS 3, 4; Spectrum 2, 3, 4 (Editor-in-Chief) 3, (Feature Editor) 4; Talent Show 3 (Emcee) 3; Theatre Week 3.” At the Spectrum (inevitably derided as The Rectum, as best-selling author and my former three-years-older-than-me schoolmate John Grogan points out in The Longest Trip Home, his 2008 follow-up memoir to Marley & Me) I wound up covering all sorts of other school issues and more wideranging current events as well, writing features and editorials, plus satires for the April Fool’s edition; in one piece, I recommended that, since the school had a “smoking area” for students who smoked, and since smoking by minors was illegal in Michigan, there should logically be a drinking area for students who drank and a murdering area for students who murdered as well. In another editorial, part of a point/counterpoint page, I took the side in favor of clubbing baby harp seals. (Seminal influence: National Lampoon’s 1964 school yearbook parody.) Through high school, I wrote only one article about music. It talked about how teens who were improperly disruptive at a Nugent/Aerosmith/Foghat bill at the Pontiac Silverdome were unrepresentative of our generally well-behaved generation. Why I would have cared about that issue, I have no idea. I was probably just trying to piss other students off. Which is surprising, of course, because once I started writing about music for a living, I never tried to piss anybody off. Or maybe I did—that’s for you to decide. Anyway, speeding the story up (you’ll find more details later in the book): I graduated high school in 1978; got an Army rotc scholarship to attend college; went to University of Detroit for a year; worked a couple summers covering local sports, zoning commissions, school boards, sewer disputes, and police reports for Waterford-based suburban weekly paper, the Spinal Column; transferred as a sophomore to University of Missouri–Columbia where I wrote for the weekly Maneater and daily Missourian, won the school’s annual feature writing award, got my bachelor’s in journalism in 1982, and started writing lots of music reviews then voting in the Village Voice’s annual Pazz & Jop critics’ poll; got married; entered the army as a second lieutenant; was assigned to West Germany; worked as a platoon leader in the 8th Signal Battalion in Bad Kreuznach and then 2 introduction\n\nas a communications-electronics staff officer for the 1/59 Air Defense Artillery Battalion in Mainz where I also ran a security vault loaded with secret cold war codes and hardware; spent weeks at a time sleeping in a tent on hilltops in the woods not far from the East German border; had a son; started writing for the Village Voice; got promoted to first lieutenant then captain; was assigned to Fort Knox, Kentucky, where I worked as a communications officer for the Armor School; ended my term of service with an honorable discharge; assumed I’d go back to reporting about sewers and high school baseball but instead wound up writing freelance pieces for Rolling Stone and Entertainment Weekly and most everywhere else that covered music; moved back to Michigan and then to Philadelphia; wrote two books; had two more kids; got divorced; was told by the Village Voice that they didn’t want to print my writing anymore, making me persona non grata for a few years; moved to New York a few years later when the Village Voice hired me as music editor; did my dream job for seven years; got laid off along with just about every other editor at the paper when Village Voice Media merged with the Phoenix-based New Times chain; freelanced for a summer; was hired as a senior editor at Billboard, a job I kept for a year and a half and excelled at but which fried my brain to the point of insomnia and one middle-of-the-night collapse requiring hospitalization despite enjoying drinking beer with lots of my coworkers; got married again; returned to freelancing; had another baby; moved to Austin; put this book together. During all that time, as I expect this collection will make clear, my musical tastes never stayed in one place long. Frequently my ideas were years ahead of the apparent critical consensus; almost always, they ran against the grain, though probably not as much as I’ve been given credit and/or chastised for. As might be expected for somebody who started writing about music only a couple months after he’d started listening to it, my earliest tastes as a critic were easily swayed by reading other critics—especially Robert Christgau, who first brought me to the Voice and whom I eventually wound up editing there. But before long, out of compulsion or boredom or obstinacy or mischief or just plain being born a thinking human being, I was making a point of questioning both my own assumptions and those of my peers and mentors, of being invited to sit at the table for grown-up rock critics but then flipping the table over. Biting the hands that feed me and making them wish they’d never seen me, as my rarely acknowledged early inspiration Elvis Costello put it. So my tastes evolved—never in anything approaching a straight line, introduction 3\n\nnever anything like exclusively, but roughly—from mainstream alt through underground metal through underground alt through mainstream metal through mainstream pop through mainstream country, with periodic investigative stop-offs at avant jazz, Mexican rock, Latin freestyle, German industrial, Southern soul, and several subspecies of hip-hop and post-disco dance music, electronic and otherwise. Only once—for a couple years in the early ’90s, when I was in my early 30s, an age when rock critics in general often start dogpaddling until they sink or swim again—did I feel like I was treading water. And now, alive for a half century, somehow weathering increasingly bleak and unlikely to recover rock-writing doldrums wherein fewer and fewer paying publications have any interest in publishing criticism that isn’t phoned in, I can honestly say that I’m as excited about listening to music as I’ve ever been. Austin is an amazing mythical land of awesome $1 vinyl bins and garage sales and record conventions, and now that CDs are speedily approaching their historical end zone and college students who’ve only ever downloaded MP3s are suddenly all buying used turntables again, piling up on old vinyl somehow doesn’t feel so anachronistic anymore. So between falling for new music by Collin Raye, Už Jsme Doma, Traband, Scooter, Ke$ha, Jace Everett, Flynnville Train, Luther Lackey, Bigg Robb, and This Moment In Black History, I’m falling for old music by Benny, D.C. Larue, Good Rats, Christ Child, Charlie Rich, Hank Thompson, the Delmore Brothers, the Mystics, the Headboys, Head East, Millie Jackson, Pebbles, Joe Tex, Andrae Crouch and the Disciples, Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Fatback Band, Steve Gibbons Band, Willie Alexander and the Boom Boom Band, Kevin Coyne, Chris Rea, Tonio K, Yesterday & Today, Riot, Pat Travers, and Axe. Few of whom you’ll find mentioned anywhere else in this book. Though if any generous publisher out there needs a record guide to awesome dollar-bin LPs nobody’s ever heard of, please give me a call. All of which is to say the wheel keeps turning, and where it stops next nobody knows. But to return to a late-nineteenth-century figure of speech that Bill James and/or Ted Kennedy hadn’t yet redefined when the sport got me into this mess, this is all inside baseball. You want to hear about music, not just me, right? This book has plenty of both.\n\n4 introduction\n\n1\n\npredicting the future\n\nIf you’ve written as much as I have, for as long as I have, you’re bound to get some things right by chance alone. But rock criticism is not a particularly predictive genre, and trying to guess where music will go five or 10 or 20 years down the line is generally a fool’s game. Robert Christgau used to do pretty well now and then in his Village Voice Pazz & Jop poll essays— predicting “New Wave disco” at the end of the 1978 one and then watching M’s “Pop Muzik” and Ian Dury’s “Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick” battle it out for top single in the poll a year later, for instance—but just as often he seemed to be foretelling a devastating collapse of Western culture that never quite showed up, not entirely anyway. My own crystal-ball work has generally proven even less successful than his. But I’ve had my moments. In early 1986, in perhaps the shortest review ever to lead off the Voice music section up to that point, I reviewed Aerosmith’s Done With Mirrors—a very good album pretty much everybody else ignored, since at that point they’d been considered drugged-out toppling-off-the-stage has-beens plying an extinct musical style for years—and I talked about growing up surrounded by the band’s music in the ’70s, and about how songs like “Walk This Way” and “Lord Of The Thighs” were sort of rap music before rap music existed, and maybe an enterprising DJ should segue one of them into the (not yet famous) Beastie Boys’ “She’s On It” single sometime. Doug Simmons, a Boston boy like Steve Tyler and Joe Perry himself and the Voice’s music editor at the time, thought I was just being provocative and messing with readers’ heads, and told me so. Which maybe I was, but he was clearly short on copy to fill his pages that week, so the lines stayed in, and apparently future Beastie producer and Columbia Records exec Rick Rubin read them—or at least writers bound for greater news-magazine glory such as John Leland later reported that Rubin did. But either way, a couple weeks later, press releases were definitely issued\n\nsaying Rubin’s charges Run-D.M.C. would cover “Walk This Way” on their next album. The song became a Top 5 hit and a bigger video, with Tyler and Perry symbolically busting through a wall to lend the rappers a hand. Which both set in motion a couple decades’ worth of rap-metal (yep— all my fault!) and relaunched the now-sober Aerosmith’s career; starting with their next album, Permanent Vacation in 1987, they wound up biggerselling (albeit smaller-rocking) stars than they’d ever been in their initial ’70s heyday. They still owe me, and so do Liv Tyler and Alicia Silverstone. And here’s a story I didn’t piece together until 20 years after the fact, over beers in Austin with critic Kevin John Bozelka in early 2009. Writing about Sonic Youth’s album Sister in the Voice in 1987, I smart-assedly called it “Afterburner to Evol’s Eliminator”—which is to say, a half-hearted Xerox of their previous album. I’m pretty sure nobody had ever compared Sonic Youth to ZZ Top before that. Over the years, as it turned out, Sister wound up being by far my favorite Sonic Youth album—just a lot of concise catchy songs that didn’t drag, I guess. But what I somehow never noticed until Bozelka mentioned it to me decades later is that, in 1988, Sonic Youth wound up ending their next LP—Daydream Nation, Bozelka’s favorite album of all time and probably the critic-consensus SY choice but one that I never fully connected with and that precipitated me never caring about another note of their subsequent music—with a song called “Eliminator Jr.” Coincidence? Your call. (For what it’s worth, Thurston Moore also put out a fanzine called Killer in the ’80s in which he called me “Fuck Eddy.” And he and Kim named their 1994-born daughter Coco not long after I’d written about my own 1989-born daughter Coco in the Voice. Not that I’m actually taking credit for the latter.) Anyway, neither the Aerosmith nor Sonic Youth reviews show up in this book—while perhaps prescient, they just really don’t read all that good. But I am including my 1983 Top 10 album list printed with the Pazz & Jop poll, in which I was probably the first critic ever to vote for a Sonic Youth album (namely Confusion Is Sex), and unquestionably the first one whose ballot-containing-Sonic-Youth was ever actually published. Though I’d previously voted in the poll in 1981 (“That’s The Joint”!) and 1982 (um, Pere Ubu’s Song Of The Bailing Man I think—actually, I never kept copies of those ballots), I’m pretty sure Christgau had no idea who I was. But in 1983, I augmented my ballot with an 11-page manifesto complaining about the state of rock criticism, declaring that everything interesting in music was already over, and mourning my having missed the whole boat. He printed a big chunk of it (the “Over and Out” piece that follows this intro) 6 rock and roll always forgets\n\nand quoted me in the opening paragraph of his own essay (“Chuck Eddy, the West Bloomfield, Michigan freelancer”—actually I was a U.S. Army officer in West Germany by then, but I little-white-lied on my ballot to circumvent potential anti-military bigotry; technically, since I wasn’t actually reviewing records anymore like I had been in college, I wasn’t even eligible to vote). Christgau also mentioned that my ballot had inspired him to “share [his] essay with the voters”; though Pazz & Jop dated back to 1974 (or 1971—it’s complicated), he’d never done that before. But from then on, for the next 23 years until he and I were fired from the Voice, he included voter comments in the Pazz & Jop section. He also asked me to start writing for the paper; the first review I got paid for, of Bad Religion’s Into The Unknown, ran a month or so later and shows up in this book’s alternative rock section. The rest is history, or a sorry excuse for it. And the rest of this section should be self-explanatory. But in case you’re wondering: Rap music did turn into something more than a passing fad. Rock music from Seattle did indeed get really big on MTV and elsewhere for a few years there, after Skin Yard founding member Jack Endino produced early records by bands like Nirvana and Soundgarden and the Screaming Trees, though for some dumb reason people decided to call the sound he helped invent “grunge” (a genre name I and any number of other critics had been applying to loud dirty rock for years) rather than “bigfootrock.” The Flaming Lips, whom I’m pretty sure I was the first writer ever to profile for a national publication, got more and more famous as they got more and more boring. Radiohead became the universally acclaimed Most Important Rock Band On The Planet for reasons that never made much sense to me. Acid house and techno irrevocably changed music around the Western world, except in the United States, yet dropped off my radar after I chronicled them in January 1989. The interweb altered how artists promoted themselves and how kids learned about new bands and so on. New Kids On The Block broke up. And if you want to get technical, as of this writing, World War III still hasn’t happened yet.\n\npredicting the future 7\n\nover and out\n\nChuck Eddy: X More Fun In The New World (Elektra) 22; Blasters Non Fiction (Slash/Warner Bros.) 19; Was (Not Was) Born To Laugh At Tornadoes (Geffen) 11; Richard Thompson Hand Of Kindness (Hannibal) 9; Sonic Youth Confusion Is Sex (Neutral) 8; Al Green I’ll Rise Again (Myrrh) 8; Nile Rodgers Adventures In The Land Of The Good Groove (Mirage) 7; Rolling Stones Undercover (Rolling Stones) 6; Divinyls Desperate (Chrysalis) 5; ESG Come Away (99) 5. How the fuck can you revolutionize an industry which has accepted Pere Ubu and Essential Logic and the Angry Samoans and Teenage Jesus and the Birthday Party? You can’t. Nothing scares anybody anymore, nothing surprises anybody anymore, there’s no such thing as a real mindfuck because people’s minds have already been fucked with over and over and over again. I never realized it until now, but the Sex Pistols were the worst thing that ever happened to rock’n’roll—they demanded anarchy, and they got it. Anarchy means you can do whatever you want, and that’s what everybody since the Sex Pistols has done. This has given us a surplus of interesting music, but it’s also given us a situation in which you can’t tell the artists from the poseurs. Sly Stone and the Dolls were able to make revolutionary music because, back then, there were dictated limits on what you could or couldn’t do, and they did what they “couldn’t.” Now there are no such limits—what if Sly and the Dolls had waited until 1983, and everything else (the Ramones, the Pistols, PiL, Prince, and all) between 1970 and now had happened without them? Would Greil Marcus still be able to write that “there is no vocal music in rock to match” Riot, or that “nothing short of the Sex Pistols’ singles has touched it”? I doubt it. And yet, the rock critics of the world are going to spend their time voting on which 1983 videos were the most fun to watch. And we’re going to accept Prince, or Grandmaster Flash, or King Sunny Adé, or Flipper, or Big Country, or Bob Fucking Dylan, or (see my Top 10) X, and we’re gonna push whatever we like as the bearer of the future of rock’n’roll, as if there is such a thing. I think this is kind of what Lester Bangs meant by the “be the predicting the future 9\n\nfirst one on your block” attitude; unfortunately, he died before he could offer any kind of solution or alternative, except that we should listen to old John Lee Hooker records. I wish I had a solution, and God and Lester know I need one more than the Christgaus and Marcuses of this world do—I just turned 23 a month or so ago, and I only started to listen to music “seriously” in 1979, and I haven’t seen a real rock’n’roll revolution yet, and I want a There’s A Riot Goin’ On or a New York Dolls or a Johnny Rotten so bad I could shit. But I’m not going to get one. What I’ll probably get is World War III, and then we’ll start all over again, and if I’m lucky and if I cut down on my salt intake I might live to see Prehistoric Ring Shouts II when I’m an old old man. And ring shouts will lead to spirituals and field hollers, and the Delta Blues and Appalachian banjo music and Western Swing will happen in there somewhere, and then yet another Elvis, and maybe I’ll be able to see the next New York Dolls or Sly Stone when I’m in heaven. Great hope for the future of rock’n’roll, right? I mean, I might not even make it to heaven. Fuck you, Johnny Rotten. Village Voice, 28 February 1984\n\nrhymed funk hits area\n\nJerry Hand isn’t modest. Sometimes in midsentence, he’ll begin tinkling the piano keys in front of him and break into a song about himself. “I’m not Sugarman or Discotron, and this I’m sure you know . . .” chants the Columbia College music and business major who performs as rap disc jockey DJ Romancer. “But I’m DJ Romancer and I always steal the show/I’ve got the super action, dynamite attraction/Coming straight to you/Yes, I’m number one and I’m having fun/No, baby, not number two/ You just open up your mind, and you check me out, and I’m sure, you’ll all agree/That I’m the baddest dee-jay there ever was, and the baddest there’ll ever be.” Hand’s ego is a valuable commodity among rap disc jockeys. But there’s more than mere self-confidence behind his boasts. The transplanted Queens, N.Y., native is the most accomplished rap singer in Columbia—he, of course, claims there’s none better west of the Mississippi. He even fares well against the big competition in New York, the 10 rock and roll always forgets\n\nbirthplace of rap and still the genre’s hotbed. Hand may not have won the “Great M.C. Showdown” in Harlem this past August, but he says he got the most applause. That’s quite a claim, considering the contest featured such acts as Kurtis Blow, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Funky Four Plus One, and DJ Hollywood. They may not be household names in mid-Missouri music circles, but in the rap world they’re stars. Most radio listeners are familiar with rap music, though few could define it. The rock group Blondie scored a major hit early this year with a rap song—but Hand is quick to point out that rap is much more than “Rapture.” Walter Anderson, the kopn disc jockey who calls himself “the Sugarman” and hosts Columbia’s only radio show featuring current soul music, explains that rap is merely rhymed couplets set to a syncopated funk rhythm. “It works almost like a cadence,” he says. The form dates back 30 years to black New York radio DJs who boasted about their prowess against a backdrop of the day’s hits, Anderson says. At the same time, Jamaican disc jockeys developed a similar form called “toasting.” Their delivery was slow and the words didn’t always rhyme, but Hand says they set the pattern for today’s rap. Anderson and Hand agree that it wasn’t until late 1979 that the majority of Americans—black, as well as white—even heard of rapping. In September of that year, a Harlem trio called the Sugarhill Gang released its first single, “Rapper’s Delight.” “The Adventures Of Grandmaster Flash On The Wheels Of Steel,” which was given an almost unprecedented, five-star rating this fall in Rolling Stone, represents an apex of sorts in the rap technique known as “cut mixing,” Hand says. Cut mixing is a process in which bits and pieces of hits (“Good Times,” “Rapture,” Queen’s “Another One Bites The Dust”) are doctored, then spliced into one song. Hand says “mixing” also refers to various ways rap disc jockeys alter the records they play. For example, a song might be phased out halfway through and another phased in. Or instrumental and vocal versions of the same song might be played concurrently, as the DJ alternates between two turntables. Or a single line from one record might be “injected” into another song. When talking about his own mixes, Hand refers to qualities such as key and pitch and beats per minute. You can’t just mix anything with anything, he explains. predicting the future 11\n\nBut that doesn’t mean a disc jockey can’t experiment with sound, even going so far as to push a needle across a record. “Sometimes a disturbance to the ear is preferable,” Hand says. “If you mix it right, you can get people dancing to just about anything.” At a typical rap show, he says, the disc jockey stands on a platform above the crowd, while the rappers (called “emcees”) perform on a nightclub stage. When he works with his partner Bucky T., Hand is emcee. But he sometimes performs alone with a tape of his own mixes. Some famous rappers sing their hits, but the best think up rhymes on the spot, says Hand. Impromptu rapping isn’t as difficult as it sounds, he adds. “After a while, you can rhyme just about anything.” It can get a little monotonous after a while, Anderson admits. He says he has considered devoting an entire Saturday radio show to rap records. “But I couldn’t take three hours of thump-thump-thump,” he says. The rap audience consists mainly of 13- to 18-year-old black “teenyboppers,” Hand says. Many older people like the music as well, but they’d hesitate to attend a concert including only rap songs. But that doesn’t mean rap is a passing fad. “Everytime it looks like it’s going to die, somebody comes up with something new,” says Anderson. When Hand first rapped in Columbia, way back in 1978, “Rapper’s Delight” hadn’t even hit yet, he says, and the rap sound wasn’t familiar to most Missouri ears. He remembers that dancers came up to him and said, “I don’t know what this is, but I like it.” If Hand decides to perform in Columbia again, his audience will at least be familiar with the rap form. Though his own tastes run closer to classical music and jazz, he sees relevance in what he’s doing. “You can tell rap is an art just by listening to it,” he says. “It’s so creative it’s a shame.” Missourian, 1981\n\nskin yard: skin yard\n\nSometime in the not-so-distant future (after all the music in question has turned into manure, no doubt) you’re gonna switch on MTV and hear all this hype about how the not-so-distant future of hard rock lies in the Northwest. Last year, I purchased the debut album and follow-up single by the 12 rock and roll always forgets\n\nSeattle band Green River, along with this compilation called Deep Six that had Green River plus lots of fellow Seattlites (the Melvins, Malfunkshun, Skin Yard, Soundgarden, U-men), and what I found was a locale festering with an inexhaustible number of vulgar avant-garage guitar-groups. And the place had even developed an identifiable sound of sorts—an approximate description might be Sabbath/Stooges-style sludge sifted through the animalistic AOR of Aerosmith and Angel City. With significant others such as Metal Church and the Wipers and Rancid Vat calling this remote region home, what we’ve got here is the making of muck-megalopolis on the level of Michigan ’69. Not long ago, I figured Oregon and Washington housed only vegetarians and bearded women and Rajneesh-worshipers and neo-Nazi survivalist loonies, but it looks like bigfoot-rock has taken over. Old-timers have probably already noted what’s doubly cool about this phenomenon, namely that the Pacific Northwest is kinda sorta where hard rock was forged in the first place, initially with raw late ’50s instrumental ensembles like the Wailers (of “Tall Cool One” fame), and later with mid-’60s protopunk jumbos such as the Kingsmen and the Sonics and Paul Revere & The Raiders, the last of whom wore funny suits on stage. Don’t know if it’s a reference to the old days, but on the back cover of Skin Yard’s first album (the best record I’ve heard so far from the new Northwest explosion), the singer is on stage wearing what appears to be a funny mask! Skin Yard doesn’t sound anything like Paul Revere’s combo, though— they’re a bit more arty, to say the least. Which ain’t to say these four gents don’t flaunt their pretensions here and there. Ben McMillan (who also honks a mean skronk-jazz saxophone) is one of those unnatural ultra-proper vocalmen who phrase every single syllable just right (like maybe Peter Hammill or John Cale or Bono Vox, though I’m not sure those are the best examples). He’s got a phony aristoBrit accent, and his morose monologues are mannered enough to gag a maggot-farm: “Somewhere, a son is sitting in a room alone, and his father comes in and gives him a gun and a book of rules entitled This Is The Real World.” And Skin Yard’s fracas can get a little dirgey or a little shapeless or a little indirect sometimes, too. But mostly it jolts in a big way; I can put up with baloney about slaying dragons when the headbang is as severe and as heterogeneous as it is here. I can’t wait to hear Skin Yard’s version of “Louie Louie,” though. Creem Metal, 1986\n\npredicting the future 13\n\ndrug crazed teens: flaming lips\n\nThe Flaming Lips would probably not be the best spokesmen for our president’s War on Drugs. This trio of Okies plays the trippiest bron-y-aur stomp yet to emerge from the lava-lamp pits of post-p-rock muck: 99thfloor-thick fuzz riffs, dead-sea-scroll basslines, cans slapped like a bustle in your hedgerow, all truckin’ through static time ’n’ space amidst recited yin-yang, such as: “When I walk with you, I feel weird/When I talk with you, I feel weird . . . All I know/Is my mind is blown/When I’m with you.” “It wasn’t so much that we wanted to be psychedelic,” says singer/guitarist Wayne Coyne. “We just wanted to play Led Zep–type stuff and then play echo and play weird.” Countering the massive lysergic onslaught of last year’s self-released debut Flaming Lips EP, the threesome deliber­ ately downplays its six-oh reference points on its new Hear It Is album. Nowadays, Coyne denies the “psychedelic” tag entirely. “We’re more what you would call acid rock. It’s like biting your teeth together and going ‘Shit!’ That’s drug music. Plasticland is like clothes music.” Coyne can’t quantify to what extent hallucinogens actually shape the Flaming Lips sound. He’s more or less a teetotaller when it comes to that stuff, he says, and though drumboy Richard English and bassboy Mike Ivins have been known to indulge, they avoid heavy dope use during band work. Coyne does admit, though, that his tastes were largely molded by his “totally-wigged-out-on-drugs” older brothers’ record collections. The Flaming Lips do a 20-minute Tommy medley live. They also cover Zeppelin’s “Communication Breakdown” back-to-back with Sonic Youth’s “Death Valley ’69.” In fact, Hear It Is seems to bear a fairly striking Sonic Youth structurednihilist-clamor influence, especially in songs like: “She Is Death,” “Jesus Shooting Heroin,” and “Charlie Manson Blues.” But Wayne says any resemblance is merely coincidental; he discusses “Jesus Shooting Heroin” as a study in good and evil and says the Manson tune is about how “everybody could be capable of wanting to thrash somebody just to see what it was like, which seemed like a real cool thing to examine.” Besides, he says, Sonic Youth are “real wimps who can’t get away from doing things that they know people are gonna like.” He also says Henry Rollins “is getting fat,” Pussy Galore “is, like, the worst band,” and that the guy from Dr. Hook 14 rock and roll always forgets\n\nwho wears the patch over his eye (who the Lips saw shooting pool in Nashville) “was drunk off his ass, and he’s stupid.” Speaking of billiards, Coyne admits the light-socket-haired Flaming Lips aren’t the best pink-sinkers, “but we play so we can look tough, and we don’t let the balls go in the holes, and we scratch a lot, because that makes the game last longer. You get more for your quarter that way.” If you don’t yearn for mind-burnt meaning-of-life declamations from somebody with that kind of flawless logic, I’d venture you just ain’t an inquiring mind. Spin, December 1986\n\nmusic that passes the acid test\n\nIn England, the strident squall of acid house has united a bevy of fickle fandom factions, taken charts and tabloids by storm, and become a hallucinogenic experience identified by a what-me-worry smiley face. Yet this is no cabaret, old chum. These impatient pulsations and unnerving combustions are an antisocial irritant, a negation, a soundtrack for falling through Western society’s cracks at a time when the fall’s easier than ever. At its nastiest, acid house is Staggerlee 1989, and its apparent pop potential only makes the venom more intriguing. “Chicago/The streets are mean/This ain’t no joke/It’ll make you choke,” an enigmatic man named Mr. Lee shouts in “Pump Up Chicago,” reviving horn-section R&B as a grating computer groove space jam. He divides the urban desolation into sectors of fire, takes on London and NYC in alternate versions. You picture a six-foot ex-linebacker who claims he’s the parking-lot attendant, and you give him 10 bucks so he won’t heist your tapedeck. Recurrent stutter-syncopation peers back at Run-D.M.C.’s “It’s like That,” Public Image’s “Poptones,” and Sly Stone’s “Thank You for Talkin’ to Me Africa,” summoning a stark, deadening stasis where evil’s always waiting to strike, to catch you off-guard just as the digital distortion detours. No quarter’s given to retro-notions of sophistication or class, even to the respectable just-say-no and don’t-drop-out niceties that castrate so much recent rap. The audience isn’t comforted; often, it gets what it doesn’t want. predicting the future 15\n\n“Art Of Acid,” Mr. Lee’s cut on Acid Trax Volume 2, runs a heart murmur from Art Of Noise’s ’83 crossover “Beat Box” through the salad shooter, and stomps on it. Bargain basement down to its plain white sleeve, the compilation is raw, unyielding outta-my-way music. Hula’s “Hot Hands” devours you with electronic loops, then turns swirls into peachfuzz, returning to its original motif just as your speakers start spitting. His “70th And King Drive” does more of the same, sneakier and more hesitant, with timbales for counter-rhythm. In “Box Energy,” DJ Pierre squeezes out a fingers-onchalkboard boom-chucka at some tortuous frequency that keeps climbing in pitch, setting tooth enamel on edge. I’m reminded of those new Black & Decker commercials in which you win a prize if you guess which power tool is making a particular kerrang. In avant-garde rock, attempts at noise disruption are so old hat they no longer disrupt, but in dancing-in-the-streets genres, they’re a shock. R&B has relied on applied science, more on rhythm and less on blues, ever since soul became disco in early ’70s (if not since T-Bone Walker plugged in his six-string in the ’30s), but the barrage that emerged from Chicago in 1987 (initially with Phuture’s “Acid Tracks”) obliterated song and sense with machines: Lacking volcanic climaxes or overbearing divas, acid house was at first radically more knotted and desolate than house proper, but by now the forms have been blurred into a continuum. Brit DJs mixed in Mediterranean modulations for something they call “Balearic beat,” Prince and the Pet Shop Boys picked up the ball and ran the wrong way, art-schoolers reduced ingenuity into a self-important hoax. By the time the majors catch on, there might be nothing left. Which is not at all true today. Phuture’s latest experiment, “We Are the Phuture”/”Slam!”/”Spank-Spank,” is background music that refuses to stay in the background, arrogant laser-zooms thickening into a dark, viscous gel as skeletal kickdrums push through wormholes that grind their conflicting gears against each other. (Think of Sun Ra’s cosmos-explorations, and William Burroughs’s assertion that you could kick off a riot with a couple tape recorders.) On the A-side, this monotonal roar vows to “own your body and soul”; on the busier B-side, gymnastic oildrum-like beats alley-oop between Phuture’s legs, around his back two times, through the hoop, into a conga line. No notes or melody, really, but if you’re expecting this to be “cold,” you might get burned. Unless the singles are as proud as Phuture’s, which few are, it’s probably smartest to observe the evolving-idiom rule of thumb and investigate acid\n\n16 rock and roll always forgets\n\non anthologies. A pile of them have reached these shores (if only a few hundred at a time) through import channels. (Once again, limey ears-tothe-ground hear a new Yank sound and sell it back.) In good acid house, slices of echo interlock like an elastic puzzle, and no matter how relentlessly the bass-drum four beat clashes with the blue-light boogie-woogie additives, they don’t dissolve into mere hissing hypnotics. The voices can flow disengaged from the rhythm, lag way behind, ascend with Sylvester-style intensity or descend through vocoders and octave multiplers, but mainly we’ve got to know these are breathing, yearning, loathing, midnight-rambling human beings, not Gobots or Transformers. It’s a tough trick, but the six acts on In The Key Of E (Desire, import), a dense dance hall of a collection comparable to Jamaica’s dreadest dub, pull it off. Adonis’s three contributions are layered blocks of clutter that stay celestial, with ecstatic heaven-and-earth sighs rising above and eerie mullahs winding through, “hurting for the lack of love.” Fingers Inc. antagonizes green-world pastorality with an incessant bassline and a harsh but horny parson rasping Biblical quotes. Both Bam Bam and Count Bass-E conjure the surreal grits-and-grind feel of Westbound-era Funkadelic’s most indulgent throwdowns, sloppy suede singing opposing orchestral strings, disorienting stop-and-surge guitars, battalions of drum slaps, and sax work that harks back to the chitlin circuit. Bam Bam’s “Where’s Your Child” is scariest: Atop the slowest, sparest throb, gongs clank, babies scream, and this deep, electronically slowed vocal—half satyr, half Satan—groans “No one likes to be left alone/Especially when they don’t know right from wrong.” He starts laughing and cackling, but nothing’s funny. “Where’s Your Child” could be an anthem in Detroit, where the crack a trade guns down black teens as a matter of course. But the seemingly war-torn town’s warehouses have already spawned their own, even more transistorized, acid branch; it’s called. “Detroit techno” in the disco biz, “Robocop pop” by me. Some, like Blake Baxter’s full-throttle pillow fight “When We Used to Play,” point toward Ted Riley’s melodic stable of charttopping Nerf-funk new-jacks; such is the case with Inner City’s “Big Fun,” an upbeat-yet-disconcerting quasi-tribal shuffle with a flighty doo-wop whimper disappearing behind a curtain of steely bass and stately piano. “Big Fun” sold big in Britain and, thanks to its big-label support, could break out here. But the inner-city blues that most make me wanna holler come from\n\npredicting the future 17\n\nfellow Motowner Derrick May, a/k/a Rhythim is Rhythim, whose angrifying Spanglish-percussed turntable symphony “Strings Of Life” jumbles brittle keys of ivory with hair-trigger agility and a deceptive logic that suggest the daunting note patterns of Cecil Taylor.

Amid false rumors of black magic, shark-meat orgies, and a particularly vicious assertion that nkotb actually stands for New Kids on the Throne of Beelzebub, NODOZ (as the album is often referred to by the press) quickly becomes the best-selling lp in the history of the record industry. 1991. January: NODOZ places 41st in Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics’ poll. Several well-meaning voters boycott because nkotb once recorded “White Christmas.” July: Directed by Spike Lee and featuring an all-black cast except for the New Kids, the blaxploitation spoof Hard Day’s Nike opens to near-unanimous critical and popular acclaim. Though the movie receives no best picture nominations, Redd Foxx is awarded a best supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of Donnie’s adopted grandfather. 1992.

Request, September 1990\n\nradiohead: the bends\n\nThis is one of those follow-up albums (like the last Spin Doctors one and, I fear, the next Counting Crows, the Offspring, and Blur records) that I always hope will sound like ten imitations of the one or two great hits of the predicting the future 19\n\nband’s not-so-great previous commercial-breakthrough LP, but instead just proves the band is afraid to be pigeonholed into the only style it’s very good at. Radiohead’s breakthrough hit was “Creep,” which at first I dismissed as a wussy David Bowie cabaret ballad with corny Jesus and Mary Chain lawnmower guitar snags stuck in there. But eventually I fell in love because I’m a creep and a weirdo who wonders what the hell I’m doing here myself, plus the lawnmowers really did snag me, and the falsetto part was heaven. Radiohead singing “I want you to notice when I’m not around” was even better than creepy weirdo Michael Jackson singing “You won’t be laughing girl when I’m not around” in “Give In To Me” (my second-favorite song of 1993), and both lines felt like suicide. The Bends is never “Creep”-like enough, but “My Iron Lung” (a late Beat­ les pastiche with surprise noise) and “Just” (which seems to swipe powerchords from “Smells Like Nirvana” by Weird Al Yankovic) come close. There’s more nice guitar gush (e.g. the sub-Tom-Scholz anthemic stairclimb of “Black Star”), but the rest of the album mostly reminds me of Suede trying to rock like Sparks but coming out like u2, or (more often) that hissy little pissant in Smashing Pumpkins passive-aggressively inspiring me to clobber him with my copy of The Grand Illusion by Styx. Too much noddedout nonsense mumble, not enough concrete emotion. Spin, 1995\n\nwalking into spiderwebs: the ultimate band list\n\nBack in my word processor days, only a year ago, I assumed the whole computer thing was a pernicious divisive plot, significant mainly in how it separated folks who had modems from folks who didn’t. But now that I’m an e-mail and online junkie, I’m eating my prejudices. The Ultimate Band List at its best strikes me as a social tool, a cool new way to connect with other people. Locate the elaborate Web page dedicated to French disco chantoozy Mylene Farmer, and you get passionate stories of Internet pen pals from all over Europe convening to swap imports, attend a concert together, then catch a sad bus ride home: “The other passengers (normal tourists who don’t know nothing about Mylene) were talking about Versailles, Paris by night . . . and I increased the volume on my Walkman.” 20 rock and roll always forgets\n\nReduced to endlessly anal collector-geek cataloguing of B-side fetishes, such obsessiveness can feel neurotic. But it can also feel hilarious. A letter called, no kidding, “Camel Long May They Continue” has some nut detailing his Camel collection and how many times he’s seen said obscure ’70s prog group live, proving his loyal devotion to the ridiculous. If he were truly solipsistic, he wouldn’t be sharing his hobby with us. I get off on the surprise in fans’ voices upon learning that they’re not alone. “Wow, technology is great!” writes a Tiffany fan. But he’s still not quite satisfied: “Why doesn’t she email a little message to say ‘hello’? Maybe there are too many Tiffany stalkers out there (hint, hint . . . thanks a lot).” Okay, maybe that one’s a little creepy. But stars are, by definition, ob­jects of desire. “Feast your eyes on the glory that is Timothy B.!!! :-).” (Schmit, that is; three delectable head shots.) An article entitled “why girls love Girls Against Boys” conducts a survey: “Scott has one of the most notable necks in rock and roll. . . . He looks like a slick Italian hood-kid and a prince.” Gina G, not unlike Atari Teenage Riot, had a Web page even before having an album to sell. The Gina G Experience lets you choose between “Samples: Forgotten what she sounds like?” and “Images: After all, she is very pretty.” Click the latter, you get the Gina G Picture Postcard Gallery: “Gina looking sultry,” “Gina looking cheesy,” “Gina showing a bit of body.” (Oooh, ahh, just a little bit, sad to say.) The ultimate Ultimate Band List objective is to prove you’ve had actual contact with the band: “I met Local H TWICE!!!” Your handwritten note from Bananarama, even your dream where the Fall’s Mark E. Smith beats up his Tibetan drummer—anything’s fair game. Webpagers yearn to connect with their fantasy figures as real people, then impart inside info: “Ricky dresses the weirdest to me, and I’m weird so I love it . . . carries his arrows around in a fox pouch that hangs over his shoulder. How tits is that?” (From Black Oak Arkansas page, reprinted from Circus magazine in 1975—hey, I’m not saying the Internet invented this kind of fantalk. How tits would that be?) Almost everybody on Failure’s website brags about getting high with the band backstage: “Greg seemed very intelligent using words i had to look up when I got home.” (A shame Greg’s not in Bad Religion, whose site actually has its own dictionary: “Herein lies most of the big words found in the lyrics of every Bad Religion song.” Sounds like a parody, but it’s not: aberration, absolve, abstain, accolade . . . ) Slick press-releasey sites laid down by record companies are never as fun as fans’ own creations, which can be self-effacing about their amateurism (“I couldn’t figure out the lineup changes, and if I could, I probably predicting the future 21\n\ncouldn’t fit it in a decent sentence,” Martin Mathis confesses on his page on Australian hard rock gods Angel City) and shameless in their enthusiasm. Turn to the Pat Benatar Addict Support Page, and a box flashes before your screen: “WARNING: Dangerously low Benatar levels detected! Installing BenaWare for proper enjoyment. One moment.” Then you get to “name that Benatune”! I love all the blatant editorial hyperbole. “This page is dedicated to perhaps the most prescient band ever . . . Well, did video kill the radio star, or what?” (which introduces the confusingly titled “Not Complete Discography of the Buggles,” full of cryptic compliments like “It’s used strange rhythm skilfully”). The Jane Child page consists of reams of e-notes, all swearing the Canadian singer was ahead of her time. “Do you find it slightly amusing that everyone has a nose ring, now?” one asks. Another: “It is so obvious that the success of Alanis Morissette, Joan Osborne, PJ Harvey, and Ruby is relevant to Jane Child’s alternative style.” Most rock critics would be scared to suggest such comparisons, or to devise, as somebody somehow found time to, a meticulously calibrated 10-point rating system dissecting every last tune poodle-metallers Britny Fox ever recorded: “Let’s face it ‘Stevie’ is a boy’s name, not a girl’s name. Even though the song could be awesome, I just can’t get over that name thing.” (Good thing he’s not reviewing Fleetwood Mac.) Tiffany’s site has a file called “In the Trash” into which “people who really need to get a life” can submit “nasty, hostile or obscene comments.” The only comment posted so far on Nada Surf’s bulletin board snipes: “Is this the band with the idiotic cheerleaders and jocks in a video? Man, that was gay.” And now that their hit “Stuck On You” has been swallowed by the “braindead mainstream,” all the midnight tokers on Failure’s page are worried about “screeching girls” and “alternative sluts,” not to mention TV star Margaret Cho’s crush on the lead singer. If we’re lucky, it’ll explode into a full-blown culture war. There’s a sense of involvement here, an excitement, a commitment to how people really talk. In the fleeting space of cyber, nobody cares much for punctuation or spelling. Grammatical errors and run-on phrases make ubl writing gyrate like some hyperactive new dance step. The Web being worldwide, there’s no lack of English-as-foreign-language twistedness about Boney M, say, or Einstürzende Neubauten—“Very first website in French about this sound makers out of Germany.” Anybody can be a critic here, and there’s something equally democratic in how the list itself reduces every musical act from local bar bands hyping homemade hackery to 22 rock and roll always forgets\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach to the same level, one line item each. Cypress Hill, for some reason, are filed under “W.” Maybe they picked their ubl spot the same day they ordered that classical orchestra for Homerpalooza. Village Voice, 25 March 1997\n\ntalking world war iii blues\n\nAfter squinting from my Park Slope rooftop as the smoke blew into Brooklyn last Tuesday, sneezing through the ashes dusting cars even that far south, staring choked-up and bleary-eyed at the atrocity exhibition on cnn for most of the afternoon and night, wondering if my family and friends back in the heartland would connect to all this more if it hadn’t happened in a city they mainly know from disaster movies, I found myself relieved again that the army no longer lists my onetime Signal Corps Captainhood on their reserve rolls. In the 24 hours following the destruction, a line about mushroom clouds from the grief-ridden song “Shattered Within” by ambient Finnish metal band Amorphis kept repeating inside my head, and the only music that made any sense when I put it on was other desolate enveloping doomsday metal like Neurosis and My Dying Bride, funereally moaned and codeine-tempoed and devoid of shape or reason—just blank nuclear-winter mood, no personality to get in the way since there was too much to think about already. And I didn’t play it loud. Wednesday morning, the eerily paper-strewn and sparsely populated Armageddon blocks between the Prince Street subway stop and Astor Place reminded me for the first time ever of Detroit, in the wee hours after Devil’s Night maybe. In my e-mailbox: a long letter from Iranian-born former Voice intern Sanaz Mozafarian, about her hearing that Arab Americans were already being harassed in public, about cars near Wall Street with “Revenge Is the Only Answer” scrawled into the soot on their hoods, about how trying to reach the financial district’s ground zero from her midtown morning dance class after Tuesday’s explosions had reminded Sanaz of braving Seattle’s “no protest zone” in December of 1999. Spinning in the background was a newly arrived Best Of Randy Newman CD I put on just to drown out whatever, and the song that goes “They don’t respect us, so let’s surprise ’em, let’s drop the big one and pulverize ’em” gave me shivers. predicting the future 23\n\nBack in oddly sunny Brooklyn later that day, friends and I walked up to Methodist Hospital to offer blood donations, and on the way back stopped at a five-dollar rack, where we found a tank top with the twin towers on the front, surrounded by fireworks and the word “Celebrate!” (On Saturday, I walked by the same store, and “We Are The World” was blaring through its doors.) Wednesday night I had a beer with Blender fact checker Gabe Soria, who said he’d turned to Al Green’s I’m Still In Love With You the night before to reassure himself there was still something good and beautiful and unassailable in the world. I wished I had a taste for spiritual redemption myself. And though once in a while as the week wore on my internal soundtrack would reach for “Rivers Of Babylon”—damn right we remember Zion—more often, especially while devouring the Times, I was hearing the Clash’s “Washington Bullets” (the only song I know featuring Afghan rebels), Breaking Circus’s “Knife In The Marathon” (the only song I know featuring Middle Eastern terrorists brandishing sharp objects), Baader Meinhof’s “Meet Me At The Airport” (“waste them without mercy”), Emily XYZ’s “Who Shot Sadat” (thanks to Osama bin Laden’s ties to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad), Brooks & Dunn’s “Only In America” (both the hardestrocking and most blatantly flag-waving hit on any radio format this summer, now guaranteed to become a national anthem), the Butthole Surfers’ “Jet Fighter” (anti-war-against-Allah song of the year), and the Cure’s sadly inevitable “Killing An Arab” (which maybe Ted Nugent will finally cover). None of them explained a thing. But you never ask questions when God’s on your side. Village Voice, 18 September 2001\n\n24 rock and roll always forgets\n\n2\n\nalternative to what\n\nThough I owned a handful of lps and maybe another handful of 45s when I graduated high school in 1978—considerably fewer than the typical member of my graduating class, I’m guessing—I didn’t in any sense become a conscious music fan until the second semester of my freshman year at University of Detroit, living in Holden Hall and hanging out with a bunch of Sigma Pis apparently too budget-strapped to afford their own frat house. They asked me to pledge, but I turned them down, just as I’d later turn down the black fraternity bros at University of Missouri who got wind of my funky white boy Motor City square-biz music tastes—those black frats are hardcore, and an Alpha or Omega branded on my arm sounded scary. I wouldn’t have survived pledge week. But I’m getting ahead of myself. When I started paying attention to music, my preferred radio stations were Detroit aors wwww and wrif and wabx, and my music was New Fucking Wave. Not the androgynous mtv synthesizer-duo kind yet; the skinny-tie-and-powerpop guitar-band kind. As I recall, the first five albums I bought in 1979 were, in some order or other, the Fabulous Poodles’ Mirror Stars, Boomtown Rats’ A Tonic For The Troops, Elvis Costello’s Armed Forces, Elvis Costello’s This Year’s Model, and Elvis Costello’s My Aim Is True. (So, uh, guess who my favorite artist was? Strangely, by the time I started getting paid to review records, I’d pretty much given up on the erstwhile Declan Patrick McManus. Last album I bought by him was his crummy Goodbye Cruel World in 1984; the only time I ever wrote about him was an All This Useless Beauty brief hacked out for short-lived “CD-Rom magazine” Launch in 1996.) Anyway, New Wave was my music! I even regularly went out pogoing and rock-lobster-ing on Monday New Wave Nights at a bowling alley turned disco in West Bloomfield, once on an actual date in a rusted-out used car with a girl who, according to Google, is now some kind of events\n\ndirector at the highfalutin private school Cranbrook. (See Eminem piece later for more Cranbrook information.) First album I actually reviewed was Joe Jackson’s Look Sharp, for the student paper at Oakland Community College whilst taking a shorthand class to sharpen my journalism/ interview/note-taking skills that summer. Never used shorthand again in my life, but did review other albums—next one was the superior American version of The Clash for Mizzou’s Maneater that fall; in that one, I talked about how, though I loved New Wave, I thought most punk rock wasn’t musical enough. Problem was, seeing how (as David Lee Roth once pointed out) all rock critics look like Elvis Costello, New Wave was pretty much what everybody wrote about. And, at least in the early and mid-’80s, almost nobody wrote about metal—at least not for non-genre-specialist publications in the States. And even though in high school I was scared most Aerosmith and Kiss fans would beat me up, and though I distinctly remember being spooked the first time I heard Black Sabbath on my transistor late at night, in suburban Detroit in the late ’70s one did grow up surrounded with such stuff. So I felt it in my bones and knew its power, and loud rock quickly became my fallback niche as a critic. As the ’80s progressed, when I listened to and went out to see and wrote about the alternative rock that New Wave eventually evolved into, I was naturally drawn to the noisier, more testosterone-flaunting stuff, much of which was being released on small labels like SST in the west and Homestead in the east and Touch and Go in the middle and which would eventually in turn evolve into blockbuster Seattle multiplatinum. Flipper, Feedtime, Greenhouse Of Terror, Couch Flambeau, Squirrel Bait, Breaking Circus, Scratch Acid, the Janitors, Celibate Rifles—hardcore bands growing their hair out and rediscovering guitar solos, pretty much. Basically, I gravitated toward the same music Kurt Cobain did, but more of it, and I got to it first. I’d bet money he even read some of my reviews. But then I got cynical about its shtick and figured out Tiffany was more interesting than Mudhoney—seeing those guys live in Ann Arbor in 1989, I decided all that Seattle crap sounded the same and would never amount to anything. A couple years before, when I was contributing a pigfuck-heavy underground metal column called Selectric Funeral to Creem Metal, Subpop founder Bruce Pavitt would mail me Green River test pressings with a note attached saying the band was eager to hear what I thought of them, and I was getting self-released White Zombie 45s in my mail direct from Rob Straker, too. But come early 1991, by which time such earnest upstart true 26 rock and roll always forgets\n\nbelievers as Simon Reynolds and Joe Carducci had famously formulated treatises outlining an increasingly insular indie-rock aesthetic, I’d long given up on all that institutionalized fury, and I sold most of the vinyl in question for a pittance. Should’ve learned my lesson from baseball cards, but nope. If I’d held out a few months, maybe I’d be all set for retirement by now. Hey, never said I was a financial genius. Or any other kind of genius, for that matter. No, dipshit ’86 self, Urge Overkill weren’t really “white-supremacist homophobic” ( just Erica Kane fans, it turned out), and punk rock wasn’t really “invented in the Midwest” any more than anywhere else. But hey, we’re all allowed to be chauvinistic about something, right? And maybe my impending skepticism toward indie-label rock—especially after Nirvana and White Zombie et al. took the loud stuff mainstream and “indie” came to mean the piddly, emaciated, arhythmic, vocally blank, seemingly gonad-free quietude exemplified by Pavement and Sebadoh and their ilk, which I couldn’t hear hardly at all— was owed in part to the fact that New Wave’s descendants are really my type of people. I’m a white guy with a college degree, basically an intellectual with bohemian tendencies no matter how much I try to hide it; when I moved to New York at the end of the ’90s to edit the Voice after my divorce, I saw obscure bands in small clubs all the time—still vastly prefer those to arenas, especially if there’s a barstool open and Stella on tap. And when I got married again, it was to somebody who sang and played guitar for a (really good) band called the Color Guard that frequently played in those clubs—and who’d once been the studio assistant to avant visual artist and Björk babydaddy Matthew Barney—not to somebody in a country or hip-hop or metal group. We met each other in 2001, at a Lower East Side lesbian dive known as Meow Mix, when I was on stage attempting to help the mostly female local pop-rock band Lava Baby cover a Gary Glitter/ Joan Jett song. Eight years later, we’d moved to proudly “weird” Austin, live indie-rock capital of the world. Anyway, it’s often difficult to separate the social from the musical; probably one reason that, say, Liz Phair’s Exile In Guyville hit me as shallow and irritating in the early ’90s is that I wasn’t a single guy out on the town at the time. And now I’m not one again. I will say, though, that my timing was superb: by the late ’90s, garage-rock, New Wave (!), and even pigfuck revivals were helping things turn back around again. And in the ’00s, any number of indie-bred bands—the Hold Steady, White Stripes, Red Swan, Red Planet, FM Knives, Drive-By Truckers, Sirens, Donnas, Dropkick Murphys, Drunk Horse, Black Lips, New Bloods, Notwist, Oneida, Electric alternative to what 27\n\nSix, Kultur Shock, Gogol Bordello, Gore Gore Girls—continued to make pretty darn good rock’n’roll when inspired to do so. Still, compared to hip-hop, compared to r&b, compared to teen pop, compared to goofball Eurocheese hits, compared to country (though maybe not compared to the lunkheaded and constipated post-post-post-grunge and emo/screamo dreariness that started entrenching itself as the rock mainstream), indie seemed only easier to ignore as time passed, especially since the genre’s web-bound gatekeepers more often than not ignored or scoffed at bands that actually managed to show flashes of life. By decade’s end, as more and more of the music insipidly succumbed to introversion and infantilism, my selective blinders had removed me so fully from the milieu in question that I could scarcely imagine how anybody else might still consider it the cutting edge of anything—I mean, have you heard Grizzly Bear or Animal Collective? Gag me. Yet despite all that—and thanks mostly to a coincidence of history where the genre’s compliant target audience corresponded perfectly with the demographic most amenable to new technology—indie was dominating critics’ polls like never before as the ’00s wound down. So it’s not like the music, or its supporters, ever went away. One popular explanation was that the genre was “finally coming to terms with dance music”—as if people hadn’t been saying that about New Wave and its offspring for 30 years. Another, oddly, was that it was turning more prog—same thing I wrote about Bad Religion’s soon permanently disowned synthesizer sellout album in 1984. But maybe, to have known that, you had to be there.\n\n28 rock and roll always forgets\n\nbombast in the blood: bad religion\n\nSince my generation has always equated supersonic bombast with rock’n’roll, and since that equation has always been one of the things which has made me more than a little ashamed of my generation, it bewilders me no end that the album I’ve listened to more than any other in recent months is so supersonically bombastic. Maybe like Bad Religion, whose punk-to-pomp move on Into The Unknown is what has me so captivated, I’m just discovering my roots. Some roots, huh? But let’s face it—to us white males who came of age in the suburban Midwest in the mid-to-late ’70s, and to I bet a lot of females and urbaners and ruralers and Easterners and Southerners as well, “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Dust In The Wind” and that elp song the radio used to play a lot are truer folk music than Loretta Lynn or the Wild Tchoupitoulas will ever be. Inasmuch as the people I grew up with are of the same species and therefore as in need of musical ritual as your average Creole or Bantu, “Stairway To Heaven” was (for a while, anyway) our “Caimanera,” our “Iko Iko,” our “Cotton-Eyed Joe.” Which isn’t to say it didn’t suck. But to suggest that it had nothing go­ ing for it except aor brainwashing techniques is to deny the reasoning capabilities of my entire high school senior class, many of whom scored higher on their sats than I did. There had to be some intangible which attracted all of those unsuspecting hordes. Bad Religion—an L.A. punk band whose 1982 debut How Could Hell Be Any Worse was rightfully lumped with Christian Death, 45 Grave, et al. into the ephemeral “horror rock” sub-subgenre—has found that intangible. What they’ve discovered is simple, really; nothing that arena-watchers haven’t known for years: everybody loves an anthem. Just about all of the songs on Into The Unknown build to these incredible, mighty climaxes, fully awash with track upon track of piano and organ and synthesizer and acoustic and electric guitar. Sounds Wagnerian or phallic or corny to you, I know, and it is; it’s all those things. But it’s also inspirational as all get-out. And I bet if I were 16, and I heard this stuff on the radio, I’d be even more enraptured than I already am. alternative to what 29\n\nbad religion love anthems, just not enough to keep them in print. (photo: gary leonard)\n\nDrawing on the anthemic nature of ’70s aor is nothing new, I know; great songs from “Born To Run” to “Love Will Tear Us Apart” to Glenn Branca’s “The Ascension” do it, and so do supposed ’60s-revival groove bands like the Neats and the Dream Syndicate and the Smiths. But while I can’t imagine, say, “Do The Things” or “What Difference Does It Make” following “Roundabout” on Detroit’s wabx or wwww eight years ago, I think Bad Religion’s “It’s Only Over When . . .” would fit right in. Bad Religion’s been compared to the stubbornly “psychedelic” threechord organ-groove band Hawkwind, but frankly, I don’t think they’re that exotic. They’re more like Styx or Kansas; like the American art-schlock bands, they write teen-angst anthems for the post-Tang generation. What sets them apart from the pomp-rock mainstream is their tendency toward irony as well as their allegiance to the hook aesthetic; conceptually, at least, Into The Unknown’s real antecedents are records like Led Zep’s Houses Of The Holy, B.Ö.C.’s Agents Of Fortune, and Cheap Trick’s Heaven Tonight, albums which attempted to explode aor from within via self-parody and an awareness of pre-aor rock’n’roll. Bad Religion strips everything that made pomp-rock the excrement it was: its “Dust In The Wind” nihilism, its “Cold As Ice” misogyny, its Welcome Back My Friends To The Show That Never Ends pomposity. And what’s left over still sounds like pomp-rock.\n\n30 rock and roll always forgets\n\nBad Religion’s songs are mostly just little parables about bad things old people do and about how young people can and should keep from becoming bad like the old people. Typical is “Chasing The Wild Goose,” which sounds like Todd Rundgren. A man walks out on the good life after 20 years, and a woman kills herself when marriage proves not all it’s cracked up to be. Both “Wild Goose” and the next song, “Billy Gnosis,” are dedicated to Kurt Vonnegut; in the latter, a regular guy kills his wife, blows up his car, loses his mind to drugs and worms, and just generally goes bonkers to a tune lifted outright from Steve Miller’s “Take The Money And Run.” The idea, I guess, is that stuff is pretty absurd once you’ve stopped striving for it and just settled down and accepted it; that Wampeters, Foma, and Granfalloons who aren’t busy being born are busy dying; that, in the words of the guitarist Brett Gurewitz, life is pointless in the presence of prize. Seems like a pretty good teen-angst idea, as teen-angst ideas have been going lately, so it’s not surprising that the two completely acoustic songs Bad Religion contributed to Mystic Records’ Sound of Hollywood compilation also deal with the futility of modern existence. In the ethe real, keyboard-driven “Waiting For The Fire,” young people tend “to the rig­ ors of their daily chores” and “social mores” although immersed in what I guess is nuclear anxiety, while in the more upbeat, folk-rockish “Every Day” a guy tells us, “Don’t be deceived by my wife/I’m stuck here all the time, it’s a lonely life.” The characters haven’t yet broken free from their lives, which is perhaps why the influences are prebombast, Buffalo Springfield and early Jeff Airplane. Most of Into The Unknown’s songs are by singer/pianist/organist/synthesist Greg Graffin, whose tunes break down pretty easily into your life’sterrible-if-you’re-young-but-not-terrible-enough-to-do-that numbers and your grown-ups-really-fucked-up-the-ecology numbers. Songs of the former ilk open and close the record; “It’s Only Over When . . .” and “. . . You Give Up” are as inspirational in their own way as—no shit—great Al Green or Mighty Clouds or Swan Silvertones. When you haven’t a friend in the world, and you turn to light and all you get is darkness, and you’re lost in space, and your life’s in the garbage can, it’s only over when you give up. The Lord will make a way, somehow. No, Graffin doesn’t exactly say that, but the hope he displays in these songs (and in his ballad, “Million Days”) suggests that his sort of humanism isn’t that bad a religion after all. If I knew a kid who was considering suicide, I’d play him these songs, and he’d decide to start a band instead. That’s what rock’n’roll’s for, right?\n\nalternative to what 31\n\nAnd if it’s also for changing the world, Greg Graffin knows it as well as anybody. I don’t particularly care for harp seals myself, but I can’t remember the last time I heard a song about an endangered species. (Can’t figure out exactly which one—I’m hoping Tasmanian wolf and betting pronghorn antelope.) And “Time And Disregard,” which clocks in at 6:50 of Zep-to-Tull acoustic-to-electric grandiloquence, would be annoying if it wasn’t so damn catchy: when Graffin, after telling us how he used to wander around in the wilderness like some hippie gypsy, shouts “Tomorrow the trucks come,” I swear I get goose pimples. And I realize that that’s probably what happens to some people my age when they hear “Stairway To Heaven” or “Aqualung.” As much as I hate to admit it, bombast is apparently in my blood. Village Voice, 3 July 1984\n\nconscience of some conservatives: the ramones\n\nIf I’d cared about music back in ’76 instead of worrying about whether I’d get a varsity letter for my debate team experience, I probably wouldn’t be able to claim that Too Tough To Die is the first Ramones album that’s ever really mattered to me. Like, considering that the music which did turn my ears in my pre-music years (Chuck Berry, “Ballroom Blitz,” “Macho Man”) was a lot different from most of the junk I’d heard on the radio and my brother’s stereo, it’s likely that if someone had played Ramones for me I might have begun to give a shit about rock’n’roll before I hit college. And maybe if I’d been younger and less jaded when I first heard the band, I never would have decided that pretending you’re young and not jaded yet is a shtick that gets old too fast and is impossible to recover from. And I’m not even gonna get into the terrible things that could have happened if the kid who carried around a copy of Barry Goldwater’s Conscience of a Conservative to rebel against what he took for the mindless liberal complacency of his classmates had realized that the most hep rock’n’roll band in the universe was four nonhippies who wanted it to be the ’50s all over again and who employed the American eagle and even more fascist symbols—I mean, I ended up accepting the rotc scholarship as it was; if I’d listened to the Ramones, I probably would have liked it. And who knows where that would have left me now. 32 rock and roll always forgets\n\nAs it is, now I’m doing the tax-funded blitzkrieg bop just south of Frankfurt as a First Looey in the Army Signal Corps, supposedly protecting y’all from the red hordes, but really just hoping the luftballons don’t go up before that day in May of ’86 when my military career becomes history. And though I find some solace when I think of lkj making his own history or Hüsker Dü turning on the news or the Imposter petitioning for peace in our time, rarely does agit-pop hit me the way the Ramones do with the political stuff on their current album, mainly because rarely does political pop address such gut-level emotions—like, “I don’t understand what drives di Eagle and di Bear, and frankly I don’t really give a shit, just please let me live to see another summer, goddammit.” Which is about the only kind of politics you could expect from a down-to-earth-type crew like the Ramones. And on Too Tough To Die they dish it out with a vengeance, taking dead aim at the “Russian and American war machine” and saying the Soviets piss them off as much as their own government does (something some liberals may wish they hadn’t mentioned) and getting down on their knees to pray for peace in not one song but two. Add the stuff about bag ladies and racial discrimination and murder in the streets and the minimum wage and you’ve got yourself, in a sense, a whole new Ramones, and I believe every word they say. Not that you can’t talk out the side of your neck re bag ladies and war machines. But I don’t think the Ramones are bullshitting—they really sound like guys who’ve suddenly realized that the world ain’t such a cartoon after all. There’s a big difference between a song that chides the kkk for abducting your girlfriend and one that tells how seeing a poor old woman on the street can make you wonder how much your own pleasures are worth. Or between one that says you remember your East Berlin girlfriend every time you eat vegetables and one that describes how unemployment leads 16-year-olds into crime, drugs, and military service. The Ramones have written a lot of fairy tales in their time, but their new album is about real life. What I really think Too Tough To Die is about is how to maintain some sort of sense of humor or sanity or perspective or whatever you wanna call it after you grow up and start to learn that life isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. “It’s a sick world/Sick sick sick,” they scream in one song. Only they don’t take the usual rock’n’roll cop-out and tell us they wanna die before they get old, or it’s better to burn out than fade away, which sounds cool but does result in quite a few Jimis and Janises and Sids. My favorite song on the lp is “I’m Not Afraid Of Life,” a Stooges/Doors keyb-driven dirge in which the Ramones ask whether it’s really a crime to get old and state alternative to what 33\n\nflat out that they “don’t wanna die at an early age,” adding that though nuclear war could be just the thing to help us die young and stay pretty, that doesn’t mean we should sit around and pray for purple rain. And from there they go straight into the title track, where they use a macho weightlifter to mock the rock virility-worship; on the Day After, it’s not gonna matter how young and pretty you are, or how much you can bench-press; nobody’s too tough to die. The gist is that the hulk in that song, and the rich little Miss America in the soap-operatic “Daytime Dilemma,” like the bag ladies and dope dealers and basic trainees on the rest of the album, are gonna have to face some grim realities after Four More Years: the “death destruction bombs galore” in “Planet Earth 1988.” Heavy stuff. Way fucking heavier than anything the Ramones had given us in the previous eight years and eight albums. But it’s not just words that make this one special. Ever since 1977’s Leave Home, the Ramones had been struggling to build on their original minimalist values and still somehow stay true to those values; starting with 1980’s Phil Spector-produced End Of The Century, they succumbed to the straw-grasping of a group that realizes it’s shot its wad—though 1981’s Pleasant Dreams and 1983’s Subterranean Jungle were hailed as comebacks by some, they still sound to me like good product and not much more. Too Tough To Die is the first album produced by ex-drummer Tommy Ramone (a/k/a T. Erdelyi) since Spector got to the band. Ranting like there’s no tomorrow and drawing on everybody from Arthur Baker to Flipper, they seem to have finally found their new niche—as a mainstream rock group, of all things. I trace the LP’s sound back to the Iggy-groove of Road to Ruin’s “I Just Want To Have Something To Do.” That song’s maximum rock’n’roll crunch progressed through End of the Century’s “I’m Affected” and Pleasant Dreams’s “We Want The Airwaves” as a sort of Black Sabbath punk rock and started to become more dominant on last year’s Subterranean Jungle, making appearances in the crudely metallic “What’d Ya Do,” in the aormystic (as in Yes or Bad Religion) “Highest Trails Above,” and in the band’s garage-psychedelic version of the Chambers Brothers’ “Time Has Come Today,” already covered by those ultimate Ozzy Osbourne fans, the Angry Samoans. Inspired, apparently, by the metal textures of hardcore bands such as Suicidal Tendencies and the Samoans and Hüsker Dü, the Ramones have let the grunge take over on the new album, and I swear it sounds like the kind of rock’n’roll I’d make if I ever started a band, mutating into an Alice Cooper/Dolls vamp in “Mama’s Boy,” Hüsker Dü/early B.Ö.C. raveups in “Danger Zone” and “Humankind,” Descendents-to-Flipper-tempo 34 rock and roll always forgets\n\nschizophrenia in “Endless Vacation,” Ventures-meet–Van Halen doodling in “Durango 95,” and early-Minutemen speedrock in “Wart Hog.” In 1984, only Hüsker Dü’s Zen Arcade has made more noise with more purpose. Dee Dee seems to be the mastermind behind most of the metal stuff, and his stuttering borderline-fluent David-Johansen-doing-Lux-Interiordoing-Elmer-Fudd guest vocals give the whole album a certain posthardcore credence. By comparison, Joey sounds like he’s enunciating, and his material is used mainly for comic relief; he gets at least partial authorship credit for three of the four cuts I’d call toned-down. Each side ends with a Joey-penned “fun” number: side one’s Busta Jones–produced and Jerry Harrison–keyed “Chasing The Night” is a dor-thing somewhat reminis­ cent of the “Dancing In The Dark” 12-inch. Side two’s “No Go” is more Sat­ urday night escapism, a rockabilly tune with a hook that sounds swiped from Aerosmith’s version of “Train Kept A-Rollin’.” Dee Dee’s “Howling At The Moon (Sha-La-La),” produced by Eurythmic Dave Stewart, is banana-boat rock about trafficking dope; Joey’s aforementioned “Daytime Dilemma” is aor-pop with Beatlesque harmonies and lyrics about a good girl gone bad. Beyond that, though, it’s all grungy rammalamma, searchand-destroy-time at the zen arcade: the Ramones still want the airwaves, but at long last they’ve realized that they have a better shot at aor than chr. Stick ’em between Ratt and Joan Jett, Mr. Programmer—the kids won’t know what hit ’em. And maybe it’ll teach ’em somethin’ if they’re not careful. Village Voice, 20 November 1984\n\npunk’s first family grow old together: the ramones\n\nThe April 1977 issue of 16 magazine had teen icons the Bay City Rollers on the cover. But inside, in her “Music Makers” column—amid textual analysis of the Sylvers and David Soul—a writer named Mandy answered the question “What is Punk Rock?” This was no doubt the first time many young Americans had heard this curious phrase. “Punk Rock is a term being applied to lots of different groups!” wrote Mandy. “Most Punk Rock groups have one thing in common—a good, loud, exciting hard rock sound, and a tendency to keep alternative to what 35\n\nsongs fairly short.” Actually, that’s two things they have in common. Regardless, nobody has explained it better since. Two months earlier Mandy had gushed over “I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend,” the new Ramones single, calling it “super romantic and sexy.” “I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend,” like another Ramones song called “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue,” was in the grand tradition of “I wanna” records, dating back through the Stooges’ “I Wanna Be Your Dog” to the Beatles’ “I Want To Hold Your Hand.” Like other punk bands, the Ramones presented themselves as a return to what had once made rock’n’roll great, before it became soggy and serious and slick and stagnant. Punk set out to revive what it saw as simplicity, chaos, danger, irony, fun. So, throughout the mid-’70s, at such New York venues as the Mercer Arts Center and Max’s Kansas City and cbgb, bar bands and art bands full of dropouts and prepschool misfits and failed poets from Forest Hills and Rhode Island and Detroit ruled the roost, often glorifying being down and out, a condition that more than a few such scenesters consciously selected. They wore unusual haircuts and jumped up and down a lot. Most of these groups—the Mumps, Tuff Darts, Psychotic Frogs, Laughing Dogs—aren’t even footnotes anymore. In 1976 the Ramones, one of the best and most famous of these New York bands, toured England and instigated an explosion. The Sex Pistols— vermin that had found their artistic calling while killing time at a respected bondage-and-rubber outlet called Sex, owned by a Situationist huckster named Malcolm McLaren—had played their first show in November 1975; a year later, their singer snarling as though he were burning himself at the stake, they issued “Anarchy In The UK,” their first single. Within months it seemed every other disgruntled resident of the United Kingdom under the age of 20 had joined a band and released a punk single of his or her own. (The her was important—like no rock before, punk inspired women to develop their own voices.) The New York bands had sung with their tongues in their cheeks, but in the U.K., punk was played as if far more were at stake than the future of rock’n’roll—the future of their nation, perhaps, or the human race. En­ gland, then, was where most of the enduring punk recordings—the early Pistols singles, the first Clash album, the Vibrators’ Pure Mania, the Adverts’ Crossing The Red Sea, X-ray Spex’s “Oh Bondage Up Yours!”—came from. In 1977 people thought this stuff might take over the world, or at least the Top 40. In England, at least for a while, it did. Back in the United 36 rock and roll always forgets\n\nStates of America, it didn’t even come close. But in both countries bands playing original material appeared in every borough, suburb, and hamlet, having learned from the Ramones and Pistols that “anyone could do it” (which turned out to be a bald-faced lie, but what the heck). Every town had its own punk-rock club; in 1982, Volume: International Discography of the New Wave listed more than 16,000 records by more than 7,500 bands on 3,000 labels, as well as 1,300 fanzines. Eventually, the music split into scores of factions, encompassing everything from Marxist avant-funk to revivalist rockabilly to power pop and techno-disco. But one congregation of stubborn souls insisted on remaining true to punk as it was played in 1977, and in 1990 the Ramones are still among them. “There’s some of us here today that still fuckin’ remembuh rock’n’roll radio,” shouts Joey Ramone from the concrete stage, lamenting the passing of the Animals and Murray the K, beating a horse that’s been dead for decades. With the rest of his band, Joey is wrapping up the Cincinnati installment of Escape From New York, a summer package tour also starring Debbie Harry, Tom Tom Club, and Jerry Harrison (the last two units billing themselves collectively as Shrunken Heads), graduates all of the Bowery punk milieu of the mid-’70s. Joey, still a string bean, exudes a warped charisma none of the thousand punk frontmen he inspired can touch. But it’s 1990, and it’s really hard to care.
