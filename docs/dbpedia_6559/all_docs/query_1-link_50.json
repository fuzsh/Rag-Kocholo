        "text": "• | 12:04 PM ET |\n\nI’ve got a new Think Again column . It’s called \"The Second (Fourth, Fifth and Sixth) Time is Farce\" and it’s supposed to add a little historical context to the issue of buying journalists abroad in the hopes that media will address the problem a bit more aggressively. Even so, if you want to wait to read that until later and go directly down to Stupid’s letter and while you’re still in that wholesome American “Merry Christmas,” rather than that evil, foreigner, “Happy Holidays/Haannukah/Kwanza, etc.\" spirit, reach down deep for the official Altercation “dig deep like it’s a public UJA auction” gift-giving day. Seriously: how wonderful it was of Major Bob to undertake on his own, and how rewarding it is for us Altercators that Stupid has taken it upon himself to help the rest of us contribute to it. As Nick King and Cathy Young would say, a big “Maazel tov” to both of you the naches you give us. Now get out those wallets.\n\nSlacker Friday:\n\nName: Stupid\n\nHometown: Chicago\n\nHey Eric, it’s Stupid to learn from the mistakes of others. But first, in response to Kimberley Morgan’s request, I have set up a PayPal account if anyone wants to contribute to Major Bateman’s effort to supply Iraqi schools with basic materials. The address is IraqSchools@hotmail.com – be sure to send a message or an e-mail to give me a heads-up so I’m sure the funds were sent, where the soldiers can write you, etc. This isn’t to discourage anyone from buying and sending stuff themselves – as I wrote, you’ll enjoy the process – but if time is tight or all the places around you are pricey, here’s an alternative.\n\nTell me if this sounds familiar: the nation enjoys an economic boom, but the good times are extended via increases in debt and a real estate bubble. Special interest groups control the government’s economic policy, and a rapidly aging population begins to strain the economy. This is Japan as it headed into the 1990’s, just before its stock and real estate bubbles collapsed. The New York Times ran a story this week that today there is optimism about Japan’s economy, but it took over a decade of recession and agonizing austerity measures to get there. Can anyone say we’re not heading down the same road? Yet there is scant reporting about structural economic issues and little context given to happy stories like dropping gas prices or recent gains in the stock market. I honestly believe Arnold Schwarzenegger subconsciously intimidated some of these folks when he attacked pessimists on the economy as “economic girlie men.” Do a Google search on “budget deficit” and you won’t find an article on the federal budget until page 2, and it’s a blurb on Roy Blunt’s effort to get tax cuts passed before the end of the year! Just like Ross Perot made Bill Clinton’s 1992 economy-boosting/deficit-cutting effort politically possible, we need a media star to put these issues on the table. Presuming he's in-agreement, can I get Donald Trump's next TV appearance to be on Larry King rather than the Apprentice?\n\nName: Dan Friedman\n\nComments:\n\nEric,\n\nThe anniversary of John Lennon's death not only leads me to reminisce about his music and legacy, it also reminds me of the comments made by Paul Harvey reacting to calls for stricter gun control in the wake of John's murder. As quoted in Paul Slansky's \"The Clothes Have No Emperor\", Harvey harped on the point that many rock stars died young and cited the examples of Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, etc. to demonstrate that John, at the age of 40, had lived a lot longer than they had. To which Slansky commented, \"So really he (John) was kind of lucky.\" Thus was the beginning of my turn to the dark side.\n\nName: Joshua Dixon\n\nHometown: Redwood Falls, MN\n\nI admire John Lennon as a songwriter, but can't take the working class hero myth seriously. As Elvis Costello's song \"The Other Side of Summer\" notes, \"...was it a millionaire who said imagine no possessions...?\"\n\nName: Samuel Knight\n\nComments:\n\nTwo comments today, on wildly disparate subjects: 1) Although the media is not liberal, the Democrats do a lousy job of getting stories out there. Part of what got stories like the House \"banking\" scandal into the media, was Gingrinch's constant pounding on them. The GOP did it again with the Clinton stuff - they just kept at it. The Democrats just don't do it. If a few Democrats had said how horrified they were of that sick joke - it would have gotten talked about. And liberals can do it - look North - the Canadian Liberal party is happily pounding away on Stephen Harper (the conservative leader) right now. And they've done it for years.\n\n2) Pray God, not Rush in the Rock Hall of Fame. I went to High School in Toronto, Canada - more Rush would be cruel and inhumane.\n\nName: Stephen Hirsch\n\nHometown: Passaic, NJ\n\nAs someone who is now an Orthodox Jew but who lived through too many years of treating 12/25 as a special day, let me offer non-Jews everywhere a solution to the \"Christmas Wars\": take the Christ out of Xmas. If you believe that a Jewish man about 2000 years ago was Melekh haMoshiach and/or the Son of G_d, the Orthodox have been celebrating his birth in a quiet, dignified manner on 1/6 for hundreds of years. There is no mention of 12/25 in the Hebrew Bible, the Talmud, the Shulkhan Aruch or any of the Commentaries; as far as I know, there is no mention of 12/25 in the Greek Bible, either.\n\nName: Stephen Carver\n\nHometown: Los Angeles, CA\n\nI must strongly disagree with Dr. Breeland of Walla Walla regarding Intelligent Design. What Intelligent Design does, if taught as a legitimate subject in our public schools, is bring religion (or faith, if you prefer) into our schools. Because Intelligent Design is not scientific in nature (un-provable) it does not deserve to be taught alongside a Theory of Evolution that has, so far, mountains of evidence behind it. Yes, evolution is still a \"theory,\" but ID, in all its forms, is \"faith\" and should be taught in church. Most Americans believe in some sort of God. I do not go to church to find my science, and my children should not go to public schools to find their faith. It really is that simple. Now, if one wants to teach ID in a comparative religion class in college, then that would be fine. Personally, I don't think any kind of religion class should be taught in public schools, when our children are failing at math and science.\n\nName: Donald Dougherty\n\nHometown: Lynbrook, New York\n\nDear Eric: As a non rock and roll fan, my observation is that the career of many rock bands are relatively short in comparison, say to the Ellington, Basie, or Goodman careers and that makes it much more problematic to choose people for Hall of Fame designations. The other aspect is that part of rock's appeal in the beginning was caused by the fact that jazz became so complex and technical that the relatively simple harmonic structures of early rock and the fact that it was a dance music helped it grow. As rock itself became more musically adventurous and complicated, it also became less of a popular music and more of a niche brand, thus creating the 'need' for disco and later hip-hop. Many of the best rock performers have had little commercial success and the revolving doors of many rock groups make their contributions hard to judge. One can make arguments for and against so many that the danger has become that many marginal people will make it just to say that somebody does every year, sort of putting a mediocre major league baseball player in the Hall of Fame because he happened to be the only one eligible that year. It is a problem that every Hall of Fame faces but I think that it is especially difficult in a musical form that is as transitory as much of rock is.\n\nName: Bob Rothman\n\nHometown: Providence, RI\n\nEric,\n\nI interviewed Jonathan Kozol for a forthcoming issue of our magazine, Voices in Urban Education. I asked him whether his use of the term \"apartheid\" implied that the separation of races resulted from deliberate policy. He first said, no, it just meant apart-ness, but then considered that there is something deliberate. He cited the figure from the South Bronx (99.8 percent segregation), and said, \"So if you want to be technically accurate two-tenths of a percentage point marks the difference between the legally enforced apartheid of the South of fifty years ago or South Africa of an earlier generation and the socially and economically enforced apartheid in most of our major cities today.\" But what makes his argument, and his book, so damning is not just that these figures are so appalling, and that white people never encounter people of color. It is that, as Kozol put it, the Warren Court was right: separate is inherently unequal. The schools on the other side of the color line are not equal to white schools, in resources, teacher quality, or curriculum. And the consequence, as he said, is \"calamitous results for those we cordon off into schools our children--white children--do not attend.\" Remember Katrina? We cared about people on the other side of the color line, for about 15 minutes.\n\nName: Greg P\n\nHometown: Seattle, WA\n\nHardly ever have I seen a more pronounced contrast between reporting by American newspapers and German ones than that provided by the Washington Post (\" \") and the international edition of Germany's Der Spiegel (\" \"). The bylines diverge even more with Spiegel editorial \"Condi's Trail of Lies.\" Clearly, one can hardly rely on the American press (especially the Post) for presenting a less-than-rosy view of the Administration's efforts. Liberal media, indeed.\n\nName: Barry L. Ritholtz\n\nHometown: : Macro perspectives on the Capital Markets, Economy, and Geopolitics\n\nHey Doc,\n\nThe NYT reported Thursday that the White House publicity tour has succeeded in on economic matters.\n\nFunny, the day before I was noting that none of the good headline data withstood close scrutiny.\n\nHere's the details:\n\nHere's a question I have been pondering for quite some time now: How strong is the economy really?\n\non this subject continues to fascinate me. In one camp, the \"Realists,\" and on the other side, the folks who call the realists the \" .\" One has to wonder what leads people to take their intellectual cues from the philosophy of -- but we'll save that bit of psychoanalysis for another discussion entirely.\n\nInstead, let's delve into of between the Realists and the Agnew-ites: they stem from the economic data itself; more specifically, the schism is likely based on the \"pessimistic\" details deep within the data -- as opposed to the more \"optimistic\" headline.\n\nAs I've noted in the past, strategists and investors should be neither . Instead, they should interpret the data before them without bias. By digging deep down, analyzing what is there, and reaching a well-supported conclusion, we can determine what's really going on -- and have the most appropriate view of where this economy is, and where it might be heading.\n\nWhich brings us to an analysis of the economic numbers. Upon closer review, there are lots of signs of economic slowing present beneath the headline. Of course, no one expects any economy to be perfect - but I would have hoped to see broader signs of sustainable growth across many more sectors, if we are truly in a robust expansionary phase. Instead, the data under review shows developing weakness, a narrow expansion which is dependent upon the wrong sectors at this phase of the recovery.\n\nIn a typical healthy recovery, Government spending often leads the way as we come out of the bottom of a recession. Pent up consumer demand then takes over, as shoppers re-emerge from their self-imposed frugality and begin spending again. Businesses ramp up their CapEx Spending and Hiring to meet this new demand. This begets a virtuous cycle that runs on until it eventually shows signs of overheating, which begets Fed rate hikes, which (typically) go too far and cause the next recession. Then the cycle starts over again.\n\nThe present cycle has not followed the script. As outlined in the (November 2005, p. 12) the sectors growth are rather atypical at this stage of a recovery. Personal consumption continues to increase - despite a decrease in real income and a negative savings rate. Nominal personal saving was a negative $133B in Q3 (that's a -1.5% savings rate); the U.S. consumer's spending via debt and savings amounted to an additional 1.4% nominal GDP. Without , GDP would have been more like 2.9%. That a third of GDP is based upon consumer borrowing is hardly a sign of healthy, sustainable economic growth.\n\nDespite some rumors to the contrary, Business Fixed Investment also decreased last quarter. At the same time, government spending is still accelerating. And we all know how significant Residential investment has been to the economy - it's begun to cool in earnest in Q3. Surprisingly, 4 years into this recovery, GDP growth is not a function of increasing corporate CapEx. GDP strength is coming largely from real estate driven consumer borrowing and spending, and from Government deficit spending (more borrowing and spending).\n\nIs this analysis a sign of Pessimism? Or are the ugly details beneath the surface being conveniently ignored by optimists? How you answer that depends upon whether you are a \"rational realist\" than or an \"ostrich.\"\n\nThe public hasn't bought into the happy talk either. The so-called misery index of 9.8 in September. Michael Mussa, who served on Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers from 1986 to 1988, noted: \"If you ask the classic Ronald Reagan question 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago?,' a large number of Americans are in fact not better off.'\n\nThe American public is hardly a pessimistic lot; they are, however, deeply aware of their own financial situations.\n\nLastly, : all his complaints about the \"Nattering Nebobs of Negativity\" -- Agnew's phrase (via speechwriter Safire) for the critics of his time -- proved completely unfounded. The criticism of the Viet Nam War, President Nixon and Watergate turned out, ironically, to be well founded. Agnew resigned in a bribery scandal.\n\nI suspect the present economic critics will be similarly vindicated.\n\n• | 2:09 PM ET |\n\nA Working Class Hero is Something to Be\n\n(It was 25 Years Ago Today…)\n\nAs soon as your born they make you feel small, By giving you no time instead of it all, Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all, A working class hero is something to be, A working class hero is something to be.They hurt you at home and they hit you at school, They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool, Till you're so f**king crazy you can't follow their rules, A working class hero is something to be, A working class hero is something to be.When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years, Then they expect you to pick a career, When you can't really function you're so full of fear, A working class hero is something to be, A working class hero is something to be. Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV, And you think you're so clever and classless and free, But you're still f**king peasants as far as I can see, A working class hero is something to be, A working class hero is something to be. There's room at the top they are telling you still, But first you must learn how to smile as you kill, If you want to be like the folks on the hill, A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. If you want to be a hero well just follow me.\n\n(From John Lennon, Plastic Ono Band, 1970)\n\nDamn you, Mark David Chapman…\n\nQuote of the Day: \"If it wasn't for John Lennon, a lot of us would be somewhere else tonight. It's a hard world that asks you to live with things that are unlivable and it's hard to come out and play tonight but there's nothing else to do.\"\n\n—Bruce Springsteen, December 9, 1980\n\nAnd that reminds me… Rolling Stone gets more than a bit mawkish, , and Steve Wynn is good .\n\nDamn You, Too, Sirhan, Sirhan. I was seated next to Ted Sorensen at the Four Freedoms luncheon at the Roosevelt Institute and I ran by him my theory, which I picked up years ago from someone else, about the election of 1968. If Bobby Kennedy had not been killed, I still doubt that he would have amassed enough delegates to beat Humphrey. But Humphrey would have had little hope of winning with such a divided party and Bobby would have been blamed if he lost. So the two of them would have been forced to do a deal; Bobby would have agreed to accept the VP—which he had wanted four years earlier—in exchange for Humphrey agreeing to enter into negotiations to end the war. They would have won and the war would have ended and everything in history would have been better for everyone. Sorensen agreed. He added that he didn’t remember whether there were enough delegates for Kennedy to win the nomination, but if he had managed to do it, the election itself would have been a lot easier. I think that was true too. Bobby would have done much better with the Wallace vote than Humphrey did, as well as those foolish leftists who sat the election out. And nobody who voted for Humphrey would have refused to vote for Bobby. Again, damn you Sirhan, Sirhan. (And you too, Mark David Chapman.)\n\nAltercation Book Club\n\nJonathan Kozol received the $100,000 Puffin Prize at the Nation Institute’s 140th anniversary get together. I had talked to his publisher about getting an excerpt of his new book for the Altercation Book Club, but the talks got a little complicated for my taste, and so I decided to go with just these two statistics I learned from reading it, (and which Kozol mentioned in his moving acceptance speech): You can find out more about the book, “Shame of the Nation, The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America” .\n\np.8 In Chicago, by the academic year 2000-01, 87 percent of public school enrollment was black or Hispanic, less than 10 percent of children in the schools were white. In Washington D.C., 94 percent of children were black or Hispanic; less than 5 percent were white. In St. Luis, 82 percent of children were black or Hispanic; in Philadelphia and Cleveland, 78 percent, in L.A., 84 percent, in Detroit, 95 percent, in Baltimore, 88 percent, In NYC, nearly three-quarters of children were black or Hispanic in 2001.\n\np.9 A teacher at PS 65 in the Bronx says, “I’ve been at this school for 18 years. This is the first white student I have ever taught.” In that district there were 11,000 children of which only 26 where white meaning a rate of 99.8 percent non-white. Two-tenths of one percent. That’s it.\n\nA friend writes: OK, so I can only watch the old BBC Alastair Sim \"Christmas Carol\" twice in one day -- Bite me, John Gibson -- so I flipped over to the local PBS station in time to watch the entire video of Bruce Springsteen's 1975 Hammersmith Odeon show. Now, nobody seriously can argue with the direction that Springsteen's taken with his life -- all the good works, all the fundraising, charitably explaining rock 'n roll to Ted Koppel -- and there's very little argument to be had with the direction he's taken his music, either. However, this video brought into stark relief a problem I've had with his live sets ever since, oh, 1985 or so. Leaving aside the solo shows, which I've never seen, his performances with the E Streeters have become, quite honestly, ponderous and muscle bound. That HBO show last year was a case in point. There was a lot of barrelhousing around and a lot of Go-To-Church posturing, but the show cornered like a battleship. The music was fine, but, as theater, it bellowed and plodded. The Odeon show is strikingly different. It's supple and liquid. The magnificent performance of Jungleland -- with Bruce as pure frontman -- is so deeply elegiac that the operatic elements of the song, which always rendered the studio cut a bit stiff, seem to dissolve into a deep blue ache. He's done magnificent work, and I don't care if he ever plays \"Rosalita\" again, and he's earned every ounce of his independence. But, if I were buying a ticket, I'd pass on the icon, and pay top dollar for the skinny white boy in the goofy knit hat.\n\nCorrespondence Corner:\n\nName: Josh Silver\n\nHometown: Dear Eric,\n\nHere’s a short list of the latest media developments.\n\nIn the world of public broadcasting, we have enjoyed remarkable success. The political chicanery we suspected of the GOP leadership at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has finally been exposed. As you know, former CPB Chairman and GOP operative Ken Tomlinson -- the man who hired a GOP operative to monitor Bill Moyers and forced PBS to carry Paul Gigot’s show -- was forced to resign in shame. The political appointees left at CPB and PBS are under intense pressure and Congressional scrutiny. PBS stations are floating an encouraging draft proposal to overhaul CPB governance policy to stop this political interference. Gigot’s show has been dropped from the public network (and moved to Fox News). And finally, the GOP Congress that had sought to slash 50% from the budget of public broadcasting has relented and left full-funding intact.\n\nIn Washington, the Congress is preparing to close down for the season. However, a number of important developments are on the move. The long awaited legislation guiding the transition from analog to digital television (in 2009) has been wrapped up into the GOP’s Budget Reconciliation package. This issue is enormously important for two reasons. 1) TV continues to increase its dominance as the primary source of news for vast majorities of Americans, despite the increase in Internet usage; 2) These policies will determine whether or not TV viewers, after the digital transition will have a broad choice of independent programming and quality journalism, or continue to receive the abysmal offerings that have become the norm.\n\nThe entire bill is a disastrous mess, although the Digital TV piece is a mixed bag. Letting partisan budget priorities drive critical telecom policy is never a recipe for good public service. In this case, it means tens of billions of dollars worth of the public airwaves (broadcast spectrum) will be auctioned off to the highest bidder. There has been almost no media coverage on this fire sale, and little debate in the Congress about how the public airwaves might be repurposed to provide universally affordable broadband.\n\nOn the plus side, proposals we supported to reimburse low-income consumers for set-top converter boxes are in the bill-as is a small but important measure instructing the FCC to complete its work aimed at finding more spectrum for low-cost broadband. The Budget bill is currently in conference committee to reconcile considerable House-Senate differences, a process which may carry over into 2006. As always, these issues are complex and arcane, but they are absolutely central to all efforts to improve independent the quality of and access to independent media and critical voices.\n\nWhat is expected to be a 2+ year debate over reforming telecommunications regulation is starting to heat up. Two key issues are at the core of a flurry of legislative proposals. First, Congress must create a regulatory framework to handle voice (such as Vonage) and video over the Internet. Second, Congress must decide whether and how to implement “network neutrality” rules-protections for content and software companies who want assurances that network owners (cable and phone companies) won’t discriminate against them on the Internet. At stake in these issues is nothing short of the future of the Internet-and all the media that flows over it. I’ve attached a good article below about it. If our coalition of consumer groups and allies in content, software, and device companies (Google, Microsoft, Vonage, Intel, etc.) are unsuccessful in securing “network neutrality”, the cable and phone giants will have the power to turn the Internet into a giant pay-per-view service, undermining the fundamental nature of the Internet as we know it. This is a huge debate that requires a massive public education and lobbying campaign.\n\nIn the field, we are gearing up to organize another FCC hearing, this time probably in Arizona, and our long-awaited online \"Action Squad\" will launch this month. It is a robust online organizing tool that combines the functions of MeetUp with MoveOn with our existing organizing and informational resources at . Importantly, it provides a way for our 250,000 activists to engage beyond sending petitions and making phone calls and allows people to share best-practices with the national community. Finally, our campaign on Bush's war on the press is getting a lot of traction with new revelations nearly every week. That campaign is .\n\nP.S. You can find out about the latest media legislation in Washington anytime .\n\nName: Rena Stone\n\nHometown: Monrovia, California\n\nDear Eric,\n\nRegarding \"Bush's worst moment\", his mocking of Karla Faye Tucker while governor of Texas, I recall reading about it at the time. This is when I decided that Mr. Bush, amongst other things, is not a good person since it is inconceivable that someone who is would say such a thing under such circumstances. He has done nothing since then to make me believe I judged him too hastily.\n\nName: Sean Piccoli\n\nHometown: Fort Lauderdale, FL\n\nEric,\n\nSteve McGady's post on the melodic limits of songwriting is excellent, but it leaves out the variable of rhythm. Different time signatures, and even shadings on your basic 4/4, multiply the number of forms that a song can take, and rhythm shapes the structure, sound and feel of a song as surely as the choice of chords and keys. Where along the measure the note is placed, and how many times it's repeated, can also distinguish one song from another pretty clearly. Play an A-chord once and you've got The Who's 'Won't Get Fooled Again.' Play it three times and you've got AC/DC's 'Highway to Hell.' The secondary, smaller-bore elements such as attack, volume, band chemistry and production values also offer the songwriter a whole other set of doors to walk through. It's true that some templates have been picked clean. I cringe every time I hear a \"new\" song using a progression that somebody must have decided was money in the bank - major root/major fifth/minor sixth/major fourth - after Bob Marley had a hit using it for 'No Woman No Cry.' (See the Police's 'So Lonely,' Mellencamp's 'Hurts So Good,' Green Day's 'When I Come Around,' Better Than Ezra's 'Good', Bush's 'Glycerine', Marcy Playground's 'Sex and Candy' and I'll stop there, but trust me, the list runs depressingly long.) But I'm convinced the sound-a-like quality of so much popular music owes more to a lack of imagination, and a desire to replicate old successes, than to the mathematical limits of songwriting. Not that a little bit of copycatting hurts. 'Stacey's Mom' gets some of its mojo from the Cars' 'Just What I Needed.'\n\nName: Brian\n\nHometown: Rochester, NY\n\nDr. A:\n\nJoseph Cannon (never to be confused with Jeff Gannon) has done some research on the one-man payola corporation that is Brent Wilkes. His research seems to show that Wilkes opened up dozens of phony defense contractors who basically did nothing but funnel money to members of Congress. It looks as if Wilkes simply broke up huge amounts of payola by having each of these companies give a small amount to the congresspersons. The beauty of the scheme is that it's one step removed from a storefont operation--it's merely a webfront operation. These companies existed only in cyberspace. MSM doesn't seem to be interested. .\n\nName: William Berry\n\nHometown: Cape Girardeau, MO\n\nEric:\n\nIn his letter on the use of the term \"theocracy\", Richard Nimmons falls into one of the oldest traps in the (usage) book: deriving a word's definition from its etymology. While it is doubtful if there is anything like a \"literal\" meaning of a word as ideologically loaded as \"theocracy,\" there is certainly a standard definition (the generally accepted usage of educated speakers and writers). The M-W sense 1. (which does include Nimmons' narrow sense, but not exclusively) should serve: \"government of a state by immediate divine guidance or by officials who are regarded as divinely guided.\" (That they might be so regarded only by themselves is, I suppose, a minor quibble.)\n\nName: Michael Breland, MD, PhD\n\nHometown: Walla Walla, WA\n\nDear Eric:\n\nI read Keith Olbermann's column regularly and usually enjoy it thoroughly. However, I think this time he went a little overboard calling intelligent design promoters the \"Worst Person in the World.\" There are two reasons I think this. The first being the obvious, that there are certainly many worse people in the world. The second being that once again creationism and intelligent design appear to be interchanged incorrectly. While the intelligent design supporters are presently quite a heterogeneous group, I would think that a large proportion probably would support some form of evolution.\n\nA recent comment on your column by a high school biology teacher expressed what I think is a commonly held belief. As I recall, while he did not say he supported intelligent design, he did say that he believed in evolution but also felt that perhaps evolution was \"nudged\" along by some higher intelligence. However, it was also his opinion that the problem with intelligent design is that it can't be tested, and thus felt it was unsuitable for teaching in high school. I agree it shouldn't yet be taught in high school, except perhaps in sociology or philosophy classes. However, to ignore intelligent design and similar ideas is to ignore the 800-pound gorilla in the room. As Einstein said: \"It is theory that decides what we can believe.\" It is also theories that determine how and where we look for something, or if we look at all. Presently we're not even looking. However, it is my opinion that we are at the point in our scientific understanding that we are now able to develop a working theory about that 800-pound gorilla. As well as talk about evolution in religion classes. But it won't be easy. We are talking about gut level, emotional issues here. Things we base our lives on.\n\nLast Sunday I gave a talk at a local church about medical and spiritual issues. During my talk I brought up the importance of intelligent design, as well as evolution, in a respectful way. There weren't any objections to my presentation and in talking afterwards with the pastor, he was OK with the way I did it. Thus, I think there are many people open to this idea, but do admit that there are certain people on both sides to whom this is threatening. Presently the debate has no true discourse, but is mostly at the level of each group pointing at the other and trading clichés, as if each has the only answer. It is only through respectful, thoughtful interdisciplinary discourse that this can be addressed and hopefully, resolved in some way. There are people, groups, and organizations already working on this issue, but for some reason, they get little press attention. Perhaps they are just not controversial enough.\n\nName: Sandy Goodman\n\nHometown: Rockville, MD\n\nMr. Alterman,\n\nYou and Keith Olbermann are just plain naive for criticizing corporations for not sponsoring the Darwin exhibit at the Museum of Natural History. Why do either of you expect corporations to show other than corporate behavior? You expect too much of them. All they're interested in is the next quarterly bottom line, and not offending any potential customers, especially those belonging to the base of the political party in power. The real disgrace is a system which starves public institutions like our great museums so that they have to go hat in hand for corporate funding. When you have a system like that, all you can expect is the kind of nonsense at Natural History and the Smithsonian's recent travails with the likes of the Reynolds millions, some of which were withdrawn after the museum refused to develop an exhibit of important Americans like Oprah. With a president who doesn't read the newspapers and has to have his aides make him a tape of TV news coverage of the Katrina disaster, a war against science and knowledge generally, what do you expect corporations to do, lead the nation to a new enlightenment? No way.\n\nName: Clara Graham\n\nHometown: Seattle, WA\n\nSteve McGady's math isn't quite right. If we assume there are sixteen notes with eight (I'm limiting the choice of notes to only notes in a single key here) possible choices from note to note. 8^16 equals 2.81474977 × 10^14. And that's just melodies with sixteen-bar verses of quarter notes. If you just consider chord progressions and assume that you choose any of four chords (here, I'm assuming you're choosing from the typical I, IV, V, and vi chords in whatever key you've selected) for four bars of repeated verse, that's 4^4 = 256 possible verses; doing the same thing for the chorus gives us 256 possible choruses. Combining all the verses with the choruses gives us 65,536 possible chord progressions. Add a bridge with the same assumptions and you have 16,777,216 possible chord progressions. And that's without talking about how many times you repeat the four bars of verse, chorus and bridge, or chord progression variations. And then when we combine the number of possible melodies with the number of possible chord progressions, that's 4.72236648 × 10^21 possible songs. Assuming the songs average three minutes, that's 2.69541466 × 10^16 years worth of music: more music than you could listen to if you started playing it when the universe was created. Of course not all of the combinations will be pleasing to the ear, but even if only a microscopic subset is, that's a heck of a lot of songs.\n\nName: Jason Wheat\n\nHometown: University Heights, Ohio\n\nAs a Rush fan, but one that is honest, I'd like to say that they will never make it to the HOF however deserving they are. They have three big things going against them. Though they've never been commercial failures, they've never had massive mainstream success. Second, too many people are hung up on Geddy Lee's voice. I've become tolerant of it, but one can't deny that the joke, \"Rush is the band with the ugly chick for a singer, right,\" has become commonplace. Lastly, they are wildly inconsistent. I love their good stuff; when they are good, they are astounding. My ten or twenty favorite Rush songs hold up against my favorite ten or twenty of anyone. Few bands in history have their chops, and Peart is capable of amazing lyrics (I was taken aback at how relevant their song \"Territories\" has been during the current administration, look it up). However, when Rush is bad, they are BAD. I'm talking Spinal Tap bad. Peart has written lyrics that literally make my face contort as if I'd just taken a big swig of spoiled milk. When U2 goes bad, it results in something bland and boring. When Rush goes bad, you want throw your CD player across the room. They've been influential far beyond their sales and played fantastic concerts to huge crowds for decades, but to many they will always be the band with the ugly chick singing nine minute songs about trees (though they've done virtually nothing but straight four to five minute rock songs for more than two decades). They aren't getting in any time soon, if ever.\n\n• December 7, 2005 | 12:24 PM ET |\n\nMake that 51… The Worst President Ever?\n\nRichard Reeves writes: \"The History News Network at George Mason University has just polled historians informally on the Bush record. Four hundred and fifteen, about a third of those contacted, answered -- maybe they were all crazed liberals -- making the project as unofficial as it was interesting. These were the results: 338 said they believed Bush was failing, while 77 said he was succeeding. Fifty said they thought he was the worst president ever,\" .\n\nThis is what those historians said -- and it should be noted that some of the criticism about deficit spending and misuse of the military came from self-identified conservatives -- about the Bush record:He has taken the country into an unwinnable war and alienated friend and foe alike in the process;He is bankrupting the country with a combination of aggressive military spending and reduced taxation of the rich;He has deliberately and dangerously attacked separation of church and state;He has repeatedly \"misled,\" to use a kind word, the American people on affairs domestic and foreign;He has proved to be incompetent in affairs domestic (New Orleans) and foreign (Iraq and the battle against al-Qaida);He has sacrificed American employment (including the toleration of pension and benefit elimination) to increase overall productivity;He is ignorantly hostile to science and technological progress;He has tolerated or ignored one of the republic's oldest problems, corporate cheating in supplying the military in wartime.\n\nReeves adds:\n\n… Besides, many of the historians note that however bad Bush seems, they have indeed since (sic) worse men around the White House. Some say Buchanan. Many say Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nTim Noah thinks is Bush’s worst moment and wonders why the media are whitewashing his history. I think it’s bad, sure, and the media have been doing this forever, but it’s far from his worst moment (though it might be among his most revealing).\n\nMeanwhile, Only 6 of 40 big papers put 9/11 report card on Page One . I find this inexplicable.\n\nI read in the Weekly Standard but I’m still having trouble believing it:\n\nLike more than a few other readers, we were startled a couple of weeks ago when Nick Kristof, the New York Times columnist, interrupted his generally favorable review of a new Mao biography to pick a quarrel with the authors over how many millions of Chinese the old monster had starved to death. Wrote Kristof: \"The authors declare that 'close to 38 million people died' [in the Great Famine of 1958-61], and in a footnote they cite a Chinese population analysis of mortality figures in those years. Well, maybe. But there have been many expert estimates in scholarly books and journals of the death toll, ranging widely, and in reality no one really knows for sure--and certainly the mortality data are too crude to inspire confidence. The most meticulous estimates by demographers who have researched the famine toll are mostly lower than this book's: Judith Banister estimated 30 million; Basil Ashton also came up with 30 million; and Xizhe Peng suggested about 23 million. Simply plucking a high-end estimate out of an article and embracing it as the one true estimate worries me; if that is stretched, then what else is?\"This strikes us as something slightly indecent to quarrel over. So maybe we can all agree that it was at least 23 million too many. And perhaps we can agree, too, that killing on this scale is not something that should be easily forgotten.”\n\nSo let me get this straight. The Weekly Standard thinks discussions of historical accuracy—including those involving as many as 15 million deaths—are “indecent to quarrel over.” And Bill Kristol has a Ph.D. Seriously, I can’t believe the level of dumbed-down intellectual that defines even the loftiest levels of the conservative movement. I suppose it’s necessary, to support a politician like George W. Bush, but shocking, still. What If I said Bill Kristol had killed 15 million people? What if he said, “No, zero.” Would that be indecent to quarrel over, too?\n\nThe Sami Al-Arian acquittal was a colossal embarrassment for the Justice Dept.

This is lovely looking box set for Babsites as well as a decent gift for those people who were thinking of shelling out the $200 for the “Sex in the City” box, but would really prefer not to spend quite so much (and want to throw in a little education along with it). The Television Specials collects five one-hour programs she recorded between 1968 and 1973 before you, know, things got out of hand. It includes: My Name Is Barbra (1965), Color Me Barbra (1966), The Belle of 14th Street (1967), A Happening in Central Park (1967), Barbra Streisand... and Other Musical Instruments (1973). Some if it’s a little weird, I gotta tell you. Color Me Barbra followed on March 30, 1966 and is, naturally, filmed in color. The first sequence was shot at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, with Streisand wandering among the masterworks and antiquities, even singing \"Where or When\" dressed as Nefertiti. My favorite is A Happening in Central Park, which is just her (with orchestra) singing \"The Nearness of You,\" \"Cry Me a River,\" \"I Can See It,\" \"Second Hand Rose\" \"People,\" and \"Happy Days Are Here Again,\" etc. Ray Charles does four songs on Barbra Streisand... and Other Musical Instruments. Good liner notes, photos, and song lists, too. (P.S. High-flying Jewish liberal guy that I am, I had a seder with Babs once. It was her birthday, too. But guess what? We sang to her, not the other way around.

There is one prime difference that deserves note. When Nixon gave that speech, he had been in office less than a year. He had run on an anti-war platform. His approval ratings were around 50% (pretty high considering it was Nixon, whose numbers were never that great). The speech was made well before his Pentagon Papers and Watergate troubles. And so I wonder what speech John Kerry might have been forced to make had he won the election. Aside from John Murtha, who in my book is about as noble a patriot as you can get, I don't see many concrete ideas coming from the Democrats on how to get us out of this mess. If the party really wants to make inroads in 2006, it had better start doing some thinking (on all levels) about what kind of world it wants to create. Otherwise, the election is going to boil down to \"patriotism,\" which is about as red state an issue as you can get. Or maybe we offer them this:\n\nAnd if the war is not ended when the people choose in November, the choice will be clear. Here it is: For four years this administration has had at its disposal the greatest military and economic advantage that one nation has ever had over another in a war in history. For four years America's fighting men have set a record for courage and sacrifice unsurpassed in our history. For four years this Administration has had the support of the loyal opposition for the objective of seeking an honorable end to the struggle. Never has so much military and economic and diplomatic power been used so ineffectively. And if after all of this time, and all of this sacrifice, and all of this support, there is still no end in sight, then I say the time has come for the American people to turn to new leadership not tied to the mistakes and policies of the past.

My beef is this: no Progressive Rock band has ever even been mentioned for nomination. The Moody Blues, Jethro Tull, King Crimson, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Yes and Genesis deserve to be mentioned, at the least! The thinking is that prog is not rock, so therefore it doesn't qualify. I love Miles Davis and recognize his contribution to rock, but his post-1970's music is even less rock than prog, yet he is recognized. I know that you have mentioned that you find some value in this genre that has been insulted and ignored for 30 years. It's time that the HOF realize that prog is as worthy as sloppy rock 'n roll and certainly deserves to be at least nominated. I ask your readers that agree or disagree to post their opinions.\n\nName: Steve McGady\n\nHometown: Philadelphia, PA\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is a business running out of stuff to sell. After the first wave of inductees which were pretty obvious, we come the present state of \"Who's left?\" When we think of the HoF in terms we are used to, like a sports HoF, we recall athletes with long and exceptional careers. When it comes to music, whatever the genre, truly prolific artists are much harder to find. It winds up that their core material usually stands up to the competition of the top 40 through the decades. There is a lot of critically acclaimed work, and cult favorites that will never really be accused of being famous. I would argue that the R&RHoF should probably create an exhibit for the college circuit bands and even Disco. While few individuals ever became immortal outside their core audience, they had enough impact as a whole to have a place. To use a baseball analogy, few relief pitchers will ever get the numbers to become HoF'ers. But they hold a vital place in the game. The guy who came up with the split fingered fastball may not be in, but the guys who perfected it are. And finally, in my last sports analogy, you have the good old days problem. These kids today got no respect for the game. Putting aside the irony, I'll jump to young rockers. They are in a no win situation. While ballplayers are trying to do the exact same things their predecessors did (see the ball, hit the ball, catch the ball), young rockers are trying to pick out new chord progressions and melodies that have been picked clean over the last fifty years. Let's face it. There are not an infinite number of available tunes. And I bet that most of the good ones have already been taken. If you look at the sheet music for a lot of music, you notice a few trends. First, consecutive notes in the melody are usually close together, rarely more than half an octave apart. I think the average note in a melody is a quarter note. Eighths and sixteenths are balanced by halves and wholes. After about four measures, the melody is usually repeated on the next line of the verse. Average of sixteen notes, with roughly twelve possible variations from note to note. 16 x 12 equals 192. It's a big number, but not big enough. If you double my estimates about the note to note intervals and the number of notes in a phrase, you still have less than 800. The melody will change slightly on the chord changes, but not by much. Extrapolating these numbers yields on the order of a million possibilities. Again, huge, but not infinite. A lot of these possible melodies will be awful, a lot bland. Keeping in mind a lot of the rock melodies are based on are played from a chord shape on a guitar brings the number crashing down even farther from infinity. The staggering number of available melodies are restricted by the need to harmonize with the backing instruments. All this conspires to make the young songwriter's craft much more difficult than the good old days, without even considering the fact that the stories, the poems are also being consumed. That being said, I can't believe that Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger, John Lennon never thought of \"Stacey's Mom\"!\n\nEric replies: She does have it going on…\n\nName: Mike S.\n\nHometown: Dekalb, Illinois\n\nEric,\n\nI read your column everyday, and yet I've never chimed in on anything but this Rock and Roll hall of fame thing that you have going has inspired me to finally speak up. There is one band that has repeatedly been shunned by the Hall of Fame that deserves to be there just as much as the others: RUSH! These guys have been together 30 years rocking the world to a HUGE fanbase and they have never let us down. If one were to take a poll of influences of today's musicians, I KNOW that the names Neil Peart, Geddy Lee, and Alex Lifeson would be at the tops of there lists. I mean how many rock drummers were influenced by Neil Peart? The record sales that this band has made puts them in the stratosphere with the likes of the Stones, KISS, and Pink Floyd.

For instance, Rice's insistence that the U.S does not \"condone torture\" is played up high and likely only accurate if you accept the administration's narrow definition of torture. As the Post notes, \"CIA interrogators in the overseas sites have been permitted to use interrogation techniques prohibited by the U.N. convention or by U.S. military law.\"The oddest part of the NYT's Rice coverage:Administration officials, including Ms. Rice on Monday, have repeatedly maintained since the reports about the secret prisons began that the government is abiding by American law and international agreements. \"We are respecting U.S. law and U.S. treaty obligations,\" she said several times on Monday. \"And we are respecting other nations' sovereignty.\"That is a change in the position of the Bush administration, which has repeatedly maintained in recent years that American law does not apply to prisoners held abroad.In something of a feat, the Times here manages to be both credulous and ignorant of the intended subtleties. Rice doesn't appear to have changed any position. The administration still contends U.S. law doesn't apply to prisoners abroad. That is exactly why the U.S., in the administration's view, can send prisoners to whatever foreign dungeons while still \"respecting U.S. law.\" This TPer parsed some of Rice's language yesterday. And a Post editorial also carves it up, detailing Rice's \"legalistic jujitsu and morally obtuse double talk.\"\n\nNext time I run into Steven Spielberg at shul, I am going to tell him what a dumb idea this is:\n\nTime reports on Steven Spielberg's Munich, which chronicles the hunt for the terrorists responsible for assassinating 11 Israeli athletes during the 1972 Olympics.

People leave newspapers for any number of reasons, but it’s hard to believe that when I entered the field more than two decades ago, the Voice was actually a place to which ambitious people aspired to work. Its 1980 (I think) “Free Speech” issue—I still have mine--remains one of the glories of the entire history of leftist/literary/sectarian debate, as well as one of the great Stamaty cartoons of all time. Anyway, the man who presided over its slow and purposeful strangulation; who deliberately forced out many of its most distinguished contributors—the great Jules Feiffer and Gary Giddens come to mind—resigned yesterday. says he hoped his legacy would be that he \"came to The Village Voice, which is a very good paper, and I think I made it an even better one.\" Now that the Voice is about to sacrifice what little remains of its identity, well, why dance on a corpse? (And yes, Forst did order up a hatchet-job on me, once, long ago, from Alexander Cockburn’s then-gopher, Ken Silverstein. In typical fashion, it lacked even a single on the record quote.) The Voice still has quite a few worthy writers and critics and my sympathy goes out to them for the unsupportive (and unconscionably skinflint) environment in which they must labor. (“Not as awful as New York Press” is not an inspiring slogan, and not one that is likely to be useful much longer.) Anyway, as independent investigative journalism and meaningful criticism becomes an ever smaller portion of our public discourse, I mourn its slow, merciless death.

It’s his “Lost Weekend” record, made during the time he used to show up drunk with Harry Nilson in rock clubs with a tampax on his head; and Yoko was paying the nanny to have sex with him, which, by the way, I’m impressed he could even think about, given everything else he was doing. It’s certainly not as bad as the other re-release , which makes one yearn for the oeuvre of Linda McCartney. (Title track is a great song, though.) If you need a 25th anniversary of the death reminder of his solo career, or a gift, a good bet is the collection. Not too many people have everything on this already, though it’s not without its problems, which you can read about from the Amazon reviews.\n\nUniversal continues its \"Gold\" series, with two releases that fall into the \"good\" category. The \"Gold\" series has been disappointing in that it is usually something that has already been released under a different name with different artwork. Kind of lame, if you ask me.

The Cat Stevens thankfully includes some of his underrated Decca material, such as \"Matthew & Son\" and the definitive original version of the oft-covered \"The First Cut Is The Deepest.\" Plus, along side the obvious, we get the full-length \"Foreigner Suite,\" and a newly recorded song called \"Indian Ocean.\"\n\nThe Townshend features all of his MTV hits, the best tracks from the out of print \"Who Came First,\" and most importantly it gives us more than half of the brilliant Townshend/Ronnie Lane collaboration \"Rough Mix,\" remastered for the first time.

No group, the Beatles included, has made thoroughly excellent albums than the Spinners did in their run with Bell from 1973-78. No singer took out the end of a song better than Philippe Wynne. No group, Miracles and Temps included, topped the Spinners in vocal firepower. And Bell was a genius. My heart aches just to think of them, confined in rock purgatory for eternity because their most popular songs reached the status of soul elevator music. The classic albums are: \"Spinners,\" \"Mighty Love,\" \"New and Improved,\" and \"Pick of the Litter,\" \"Happiness is Being With the Spinners,\" and \"Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow.\" The first four are magnificent. The last two show the strained alliances with Bell and Wynne, and the pressure of the disco years, but they still have great songs on them. As Harold Melvin said in the same era, \"Wake up, everybody.\"\n\nName: Cole Odell\n\nHometown: Brattleboro, VT\n\nJeff Weed wants ideas for overlooked Rock and Roll Hall of Fame candidates? How about the Hall's most neglected act which isn't Patti Smith, namely the Stooges? Iggy Pop and his band made fierce, amazing records that set the stage for much of the 70s punk scene. They're nearly as worthy of induction as the Velvet Underground, and clearly more historically important than many of the fine, if modest acts (sorry, Chrissy Hynde and Bob Seger, but it's true) that have been inducted in recent years. The Hall should be embarrassed for overlooking Gram Parsons for so long; the guy only single-handedly popularized country rock, paving the way for the Don Henleys of the world to buy their mansions and pick up their awards. I also think that Zombiebox and Five Guys Walk Into a Bar... make very strong cases for taking another look at both The Zombies and The Faces, the latter being reconfirmed by its set as one of the best rock acts of all time. Captain Beefheart, one of rock's bravest experimenters, certainly deserves a place. Big Star, the Raspberries and Cheap Trick ought to be there representing power pop, and I'd also induct Lenny Kaye as a non-performer for compiling the original Nuggets garage rock compilation in 1972, which undoubtedly launched many more bands than it enshrined. That would keep the Hall going for a while. However, I take issue with Jeff's suggestion that the 1980s will present slim pickings for the Hall. This is only true if they stick to acts that were popular at commercial radio. If they do that, they're in trouble, as most of the best rock and pop on the radio in that decade was made by performers with only a handful of great singles in them. But if the Hall follows innovative rock and roll to where it actually went in the 80s, namely the relative margins of the college circuit, the options rapidly multiply. The Pixies, The Replacements, Dinosaur Jr. and Sonic Youth are among the most critically acclaimed rock acts ever, even if they never sold records like the Eagles. Just below that rung are bands like X, Husker Du, the Minutemen, Fugazi and Black Flag. That good new rock went underground in the 80s is undeniable. But is this fact unavoidable for the Hall? Will they ignore post-punk as they've mostly avoided punk? In favor of what? Culture Club, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and third-rung 70s acts? I guess we'll see.\n\nName: K. W. Hart\n\nComments:\n\nRe: Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Who exposed more people to more rock & roll than Ed Sullivan? The Stones, the Beatles, Elvis, Buddy Holly, Bo Diddley, the Doors, the Dave Clark Five, you name the group, they probably appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show. And this was at a time before rock & roll was mainstream. Ed saw the future, and its name was rock & roll, and he saw it almost 20 years before Jon Landau said the same of The Boss. (Disclosure: I used to work for A&M Records, and Herb and Jerry definitely belong in the HOF. But Ed should have his own wing, featuring all the performances of HOF members who made their American TV debuts on his show. It would be quite a lineup.\n\nName: Steve Elworth\n\nHometown: Brooklyn, NY\n\nI want to add to a potential thread about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Eric your writing the Patti Smith gig at BAM brings up two potential members at the HOF, the Patti Smith Group and Television. The recordings that they made in the 70's are astonishing, fresh and influential. They are the two remaining crucial acts of New York Punk New Wave. Jackson Brown made it, so what of the two more crucial LA singer songwriters, Warren Zevon and still with us still growing and becoming more and more influential, Tom Waits. From the UK, two great acts, one the great part was short but connected, prog with hard rock, Deep Purple of MarkII fame and combining prog with feminist ecriture and singer/songwriter, Kate Bush. Of 80's acts, I can think of one who is already elgible, the greatest of LA band and the greatest band ever associated with Ray Manzarek, X and the original band is coming this Friday to Roseland.\n\nP.S. When will Richard Thompson get in the HOF? Come on.\n\nName: Chris Dougherty\n\nHometown: Wanaque, NJ\n\nEric,\n\nLiked the articles about the R & R Hall of Fame process. I'd like to throw in two names: Gram Parsons - Yes, trippy roadhouse type but look at what he did. He basically took roadhouse music and got it into an entire generation of listeners. If the Eagles can make it in why can't Gram? He triggered Emmy Lou Harris's career, basically gave groups like Poco a reason to record, launched the Flying Burrito Brothers, had a cup of coffee with the Byrds, and cast a wide net over the Alt Country movement that continues to this day (Rodney Crowell, Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle etc.) Sometimes the hall has to not only recognize those that reach into the vault they have to recognize those that picked it up and moved it. Gram's work in the late 60's was crucial in separating the American listening audience from the British invasion.\n\nKraftwerk - same goes here. Where would dance, electronica, hip-hop, house and other types of music be without the influence of these guys? They really broke a lot of the mold in the 70's and what they laid out continues to this day.\n\nI'd like to see the Moody Blues get in along with Patti Smith.\n\n• December 5, 2005 | 11:30 AM ET |\n\nTorture and wrongful imprisonment are US\n\nIn case you missed the details of where Iraq has taken us as a nation, this is from Sunday’s Washington Post, :\n\nMembers of the Rendition Group follow a simple but standard procedure: Dressed head to toe in black, including masks, they blindfold and cut the clothes off their new captives, then administer an enema and sleeping drugs.

At the same time, it wasn't of the order that somebody was killed.— Albert Evans, President of Yale Inter-Fraternity Council in 1967, commenting on the branding of DKE pledges with red-hot coat hangers while George W.

(Of course, this may partly descend from my Agnes Gooch marginalization in the old bar scene, where I was -- as Nora Ephron would say -- a wallflower at the orgy.) Giorgio Moroder's albums, which I listened to obsessively on headphones, were an enormous inspiration to me … Disco at its best is a neurological event, a shamanistic vehicle of space-time travel. …” Guess who, .\n\nOh really, what’s the ?\n\nI watched Dershowitz debate Chomsky on C-Span over the weekend. I don’t really like either one—and neither one likes me-- but I must say, Chomsky is much more a gentleman than Dershowitz, who allowed himself to become a bit unhinged a bunch of times. They may each be wrong in their own way, but Chomsky certainly has better manners.\n\nAnyway, it proves my point. Such debates are worse than pointless. Nobody ever convinces anybody of anything when it comes to the Middle East; people just attack each other’s character, as happens every time I write anything about the issue on this blog, by people like Lubovitcher Rebbes Cathy Young and Nick King…\n\nI much preferred the interview of John Updike that followed it. Kudos again to C-Span, but I hope they try harder to even up the score ideologically. (See the FAIR study .) There is no place on television of which I am aware in which liberal commentators are treated as generously as right-wingers. I mean look at Matthews , \"Everybody sort of likes the president, except for the real whack-jobs, maybe on the left.\" Remember, according to the Wall Street Journal: “A majority of U.S. adults believe the Bush administration generally misleads the public on current issues, while fewer than a third of Americans believe the information provided by the administration is generally accurate, the latest Harris Interactive poll finds.” A recent Diageo/Hotline poll reported that 56 percent of Americans have an \"unfavorable\" opinion of Bush; an NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey reported that a large plurality have \"very negative\" feelings toward Bush. In recent weeks, Matthews has also said that Bush sometimes \"glimmers\" with \"sunny nobility\" and praised a recent Bush speech as a \"brilliant political move\" -- before the speech was even delivered. Now he is calling the majority of Americans \"whack-jobs\" and deriding critics of the Iraq war as \"carpers and complainers.\" Matthews thinks a majority of this nation are either “left, whack-jobs, maybe on the left,” and one frequently hears that he’s on the left, my goodness.

Together with the Kaiser Chiefs, they’re the only new band about which I can get even halfway excited. They’ve got a real Mamma/Papas vibe going, both by virtue of being made up of two pairs of siblings, the Stodarts (singer and songwriter Romeo who likes a bit like a big hairy troll, and his sister Michelle on bass, keyboards, vocals) and the Gannons (almost as gnomelike Sean on drums and his sister Angela on vocals, melodica and percussion. They were fun and you can read about their record, .\n\nThe following night, I saw an extremely moving and pretty powerful performance by Ray Davies, who had his own band for the first time I’ve ever heard of. (I saw him do that solo show about ten years ago, but this was a whole band…) The gig, at the Supper Club, was a kind of long-term promo for Ray’s forthcoming record, \"Other People's Lives,\" due out in February via V2 Records as well as a kind of celebration of his new EP, \"Thanksgiving Day,\" which is just out. Ray was in great spirits and the band was pretty tight. He played a bunch of new songs, including ones called \"After the Fall,\" \"Next Door Neighbor,\" \"The Tourist,\" \"Things Are Gonna Change (The Morning After)\" and \"Stand Up Comic,\" which Davies sang as his alter ego, \"Max.\" He reached back into the catalogue for acoustic versions of several tunes from the Kinks' classic \"Village Green Preservation Society,\" including \"Animal Farm,\" \"Johnny Thunder\" and \"Village Green,\" and full-band versions of \"All Day and All the Night,\" \"Waterloo Sunset, \"You Really Got Me,\" \"Lola\" and \"Low Budget.\" On the topic of a Kinks reunion, the closest we got was his discussion of Dave, who had a stroke last year, and, says Ray, “is giving me a hard time, so he must be better.” He’ll be back in the Spring.\n\nAlso last week, I saw forty of the greatest minutes of live performance of my life at the Brooklyn Academy of Music when Patti Smith came on stage dressed in her Sinatra get-up (plus army boots) and did the most energized, intense, youthful, thrilling even, version of “Horses”—the entire album—one could imagine. Actually, it was better than I could have imagined as the spirit of everything rock aspires to be coursed through her tiny body as well as that of her incredible band (Tom Verlaine, Lenny Kaye, Flea, etc…) Legacy has just released the thirtieth anniversary edition of this masterpiece and it comes with a live performance of it too. I’ve not heard it yet but I’d be amazed if it touched the performance those of us who were privileged to see her Thursday night will always remember. (P.S. Patti returned for a second set, and it was just fine—quite good, in fact, but what she achieved in the first set would have been unsustainable by any performer. Well, maybe one. (See below.)\n\n— By the way, how come nobody notices how terrific Showtime is; it’s almost as terrific as HBO, (about which everybody knows.) Anyway, Huff was great. Chris Isaak was great. Weeds was great. Fat Actress was the worst thing of all time, but hey, nobody’s making you watch. And now, Flesh-eating anti-Bush zombies. We’ll take anyone. (When I wrote that, I had not seen it yet. Now I have, and I have to say, “run, don’t walk… subscribe, right away. It’s worth it. My only criticism is that the Ann Coulter-character is never shown back when she was still a man.)\n\nBilly Joel, \"My Lives,\" track listing, . I know, it’s only Billy Joel, but I like it. This box is for the serious Billy Joel person, if such a thing can be said to exist or even said. It’s a weird amalgam; not exactly a box of outtakes and demos, though there are plenty of those. And certainly not a greatest hits box, which already exists, and is pretty great. It does not suit anyone’s purposes perfectly, since the “serious Billy Joel person” will have all the pre-released stuff and the rest of us want only the finished product. I’m happy to have it on. Billy Joel made some, actually, a really impressive number of, pretty great songs once you forgive him for acting like such a putz. The sequencing is also odd, and impossible to figure out thematically. There’s a few classical songs, too, but they’re at the end, so you can skip without any hassle.\n\nCorrespondence Corner:\n\nName: Tom\n\nHometown: Seattle\n\nHey Doc,\n\nI've been watching the media blitz surrounding the \"new Iraq plan for victory.\" Can anyone tell me why the headline isn't \"3 years after starting war, administration finally announces a plan to win - stay the course\"? Doesn't it strike anybody in MSM that this is patently absurd? Mission Accomplished? Yup.\n\nName: David Dennie\n\nHometown: Norfolk, Virginia\n\nEric,\n\nI'd like to jump into the \"Born to Run\" discussion by suggesting a contrarian, if not slightly controversial, position - namely that yes, BTR IS great, but not necessarily the absolute pinnacle of the Boss's achievement. I would contend that that crowning achievement came 3 years later, with \"Darkness on the Edge of Town.\" I hold that BTR, while certainly a commercial breakthrough, was not quite the artistic breakthrough that many claim. In fact, Springsteen had previously written similar \"street operas\" and word pictures of struggling-lower-middle-class/working-class life on his first 2 albums. On DOTEOT he continued writing about these subjects, but the writing, while still vivid and colorful, was much more realistic - more believable. The characters on DOTEOT, rather than living BTR's \"ballet being fought out in the alley\", had real lives, with real relationships and real jobs, along with all the struggle and heartache that such lives really experience. In addition, Bruce's music on DOTEOT had become tougher, more focused, more powerful - change-of-pace \"breathers\" like \"Racing in the Street\" excepted. (Even, or maybe especially, with the improved audio on the new BTR re-issue, it still sounds a little dissolute - almost, forgive me fellow Boss fans, sloppy - at times). And as far as some of the other major Boss albums, I would sum them up so: \"The River\" - excellent, but diluted by being a double-album with some weaker cuts; \"Nebraska\" - brilliant, but a little too stark; \"Born in the USA\" - also filled with great songs, but marred by overly slick, somewhat dated-sounding overproduction. So, again, I'd contend that DOTEOT is the REAL, mysteriously-somewhat-overlooked, Bruce Springsteen masterpiece. Anyone concur?\n\nName: John Moore\n\nHometown: San Francisco, CA\n\nDear Dr. A,\n\nThe latest post from Brad in Arlington shows how conservatives tend to ascribe everything good in American society to the free market while ignoring the very substantial role played by government. Brad alludes to \"the past century of unparalleled economic growth and skyrocketing standards of living in this country,\" and implicitly concludes that these were caused by \"decisions based on profit.\" What Brad fails to acknowledge is that our \"skyrocketing standards of living\" owe much to *government* action. Here are just a few examples:\n\nSocial Security and Medicare, which assure the elderly a minimal income and basic health care in their later years;\n\nthe GI bill, which made higher education a possibility for a huge number of vets and proved their stepping stone into the middle class;\n\nminimum wage and labor laws, which helped guarantee workers at least a minimal income and protection from inhumane working conditions;\n\nfederal banking regulation, which insures the savings of American businesses and individuals and helps guarantee a stable business and financial environment; and\n\nenvironmental laws, which have made the air we breathe and the water we drink cleaner.\n\nI could add other examples, but the obvious point is that all of these things have contributed mightily to America's standard of living and economic progress, but none of them would have been achieved solely through \"decisions based on profit.\" The (often unsung) genius of America's 20th century capitalist system was always its use of government to temper the harsh effects of unfettered capitalism. Sadly, the current regime is trying to repeal as much of this system as possible. Without it, I doubt that America's standard of living will continue to \"skyrocket\" or that we will see more of the \"unparalleled\" economic growth Brad trumpets.\n\nName: Kimberly Morgan\n\nHometown: Columbus, OH\n\nRe: school supplies for Iraq.

By this, I mean that very few newly eligible nominees will be of Hall of Fame caliber over the next several years. Since artists are eligible for the Hall 25 years after their debut and since the 1980's produced fewer performers of long-term historical importance than the preceding decades (a short list of qualified 80's candidates could include R.E.M., Run-D.M.C., Madonna, Metallica, Public Enemy, The Beastie Boys, Def Leppard and Sting) the Hall of Fame will be looking more to artists who were previously passed over or just overlooked. It will be interesting to see if 70's artists whose commercial (if not critical) success peaked in the 80's will gain stronger consideration. Will acts such as Hall & Oates, Genesis, Foreigner, Kool & the Gang or Peter Gabriel be inducted? There are a few older artists that I think should at least receive some consideration:\n\nThe Clovers. It's actually surprising that they're not in yet. One of the most important of the early R&B groups, The Clovers were the transition between groups like The Ink Spots or Mills Brothers and The Drifters/Coasters. \"One Mint Julep\" \"Love, Love, Love\" \"Love Potion #9\"\n\nThe Hollies. The Dave Clark Five were HOF finalists this past go-round, but missed the cut. I like the DC5 and wouldn't have a problem with them being in, but among British Invaders, The Hollies have better credentials-a longer-term chart life and, in my opinion, a stronger catalog of songs. \"Stop, Stop, Stop\" \"King Midas In Reverse\" \"Long Cool Woman\" plus a fine (though truncated) version of Bruce's \"4th of July Asbury Park (Sandy)\"\n\nPaul Revere & The Raiders. Among the most underrated of 60's bands, Portland, Oregon's finest succeeded in the midst of the British Invasion by playing excellent pop-rock that belied the over-the-top silliness of their Revolutionary War costumes. \"Kicks\" \"Just Like Me\" \"Hungry\" and the second-best \"Louie Louie\"\n\nThe Moody Blues. Went from R&B-based second-billed rockers to early progenitors of prog-rock, though without the flashier chops.

I guarantee that you’ll get a lot out of it (including a way-cool e-mail from Iraq). One surprise I got while gathering the school supplies was how much goodwill it generated on my end. The clerk at the teacher supply store I went to was a Muslim woman and she positively lit-up when she saw Major Bob’s instructions and the address where the stuff was going – thanks to her they got a great deal on construction paper. Who\n\nknows, maybe some word of the project spread through her circle of friends and family. It also sparked a conversation with the counter workers and a customer at Chicago’s 24-hour post office.\n\nThis project struck a chord with me for several reasons, apart, of course, from wanting to help out a fellow Altercator. First, my mother is a school nurse and substitute teacher, so I already knew some discount teacher supply stores in the area (by the way, if you think you had it bad in high school, imagine if at any moment your mom could walk into the classroom.) More importantly, I’m a big follower of social psychology research and have seen experiments where a small positive personal interaction with an individual can trigger a sea change in that person’s opinions. Iraqi teachers might not be the hand that rocks the cradle, but they’re the next closest thing – supporting them and giving Iraqi youths something tangible and positive will do more than a thousand news conferences, paid-for newspaper stories and press releases.\n\nP.S. You know, if someone wants to contribute but doesn’t know/have a supply store around them, I’m happy to do the legwork, so if you get any questions/inquiries feel free to put them in touch/offer that (or you can put that in the post/see if Major Bateman is comfortable with that/whatever).\n\nEric adds: The fullest explication of the Major’s plans can be found .\n\nName: John S. Ransom\n\nHometown: Carlisle, PA\n\nDear Eric,\n\nI want to compliment you for the insightful 'adaptation' of Nixon's speech on Vietnamization. But as I'm sure you also noticed, one of the interesting things about Nixon's remarks is that at the start of them, he is much more straightforward about the level of dissatisfaction with the war effort than Bush has ever been. Does that mean that political discourse has progressively degraded since Nixon's time? We should be careful to assert that strong trends exist over time on the basis of one comparison; that is, Bush's rhetoric on Iraq as compared to Nixon's on Vietnam. It might just be that Nixon was smarter than Bush, and knew more was needed than someone like Bush is able to give. The difference might simply be due to the personal strengths and weaknesses of Nixon and Bush, and have nothing to do with long-term trends. Still it's hard not to feel a perverse sense of nostalgia for what appears to be a Nixon who is more 'honest,' more 'in touch with reality' (a palm I never thought I'd give Nixon!) than our current president.\n\nName: Kevin in the middle\n\nHometown: Madison, NJ\n\nSpooky, isn't it?

Personally, I would submit that \"screwing your customers & your employees as long and as hard as possible\" is not \"smart business\" in any way, shape, or form. That said, we live in a capitalistic society and \"profit is king in America.\" For better or worse, this is why America is as powerful as it is. While there will always be corrupt, warped people who take advantage (child labor & sweatshops to union busters, love canal & asbestos), we do not have \"unbridled capitalism\" and there are repercussions to for illegal activities (criminally and financially). Further, in light of the past century of unparalleled economic growth and skyrocketing standards of living in this country, clearly not all decisions based on profit are \"evil,\" as Mr. Stafford would like to believe. Josh from Florida asks non-rhetorically whether \"it would be a-okay by [me] if corporations were to stop investing money in scientific research that may offend religious conservatives?\" While I believe corporations are free to do as they please in such regards, the overriding goal of profits makes this question hollow and simplistic. Corporations whose viability is based on research and development see science through the prism of profits, not ideology or theology. If someone can make money by developing a controversial product, they will. That is the beauty of capitalism. No American corporation will become beholden to a small but vocal group of religious extremists, unless that group is their primary market. For this reason, corporations will not make or break the Darwin exhibit, nor will they advocate that Darwin was a heathen fool. I suggest that Rob and Josh take a long, hard look at what corporations have done in (and for) this country since the start of the twentieth century. It is not all (or even mostly) bad.\n\nName: Thomas Heiden\n\nHometown: Stratford, CT\n\nEric,\n\nIt is all too easy to agree with Rob Stafford's depiction of certain corporate decisions as \"evil\" - this is emotionally satisfying, and certainly evil (pollution, known-to-be-dangerous products, et.al.) does result from many such decisions. However, let me suggest that it is both impolitic and incorrect to use that word. Impolitic, because it turns off many in the business community, and on the right in general, and because it encourages them to think of liberals/progressives as wackos; incorrect, because capitalism IS AN AMORAL SYSTEM - it does not claim to have a moral dimension. I believe this latter point to be vital in any critical examination of this nation's problems. As a nation, we have from the outset created a political entity with two fundamental tensions. The first is the rights of the group vs. the rights of the individual. We will never \"solve\" this, because there is no universal, timeless answer to this dilemma. Neither the Ayn Randists nor the Benthamites can be allowed to prevail. The other (equally important) tension is between our competitive economic system, capitalism, and our cooperative political system, republican government. There is little reason to think Americans will ever turn their collective back on capitalism, and even most of us on the left do not wish to \"kill the goose that laid the golden egg\". We wish for the Founders' expressed intent - that PEOPLE always be placed first - to be made consistently manifest when it comes to matters of policy, of law. As tempting as it is, the use of a term like \"evil\", in connection with something many Americans cherish (sadly) more than their bequeathed blessing of republican government, only adds heat to the debate; what we need is light! As in, \"Enlightenment.\"\n\nName: Ben Vernia\n\nHometown: Arlington, VA\n\nEric, here's Ben from Arlington, VA, to respond to Brad from Arlington, VA: corporate fear of Darwin may placate fundamentalist consumers, but Brad's limited definition of the goals of business ignore the long-term implications of caving in to this new medievalism. Businesses (especially those wanting to sell the inexpensive, quality products Brad craves) turn increasingly to a little reality-based field called science. (And, while I hate to disagree with you, Eric, I don't concur that the American Museum of Natural History deals in \"culture.\") The rise of creationism and \"intelligent design\" is an utter rejection of the importance of reality that can and will have profound implications for the scientific advancement of our own society. For those who think that the religious right's medievalizing ambitions are limited solely to natural history, the stem cell debate demonstrates that they're targeting our future, too. Whether our technological society can continue to develop after we ostracize science is a question that most rational people would prefer not to test empirically. So, even if you believe that corporations have no higher purpose than their economic viability, sitting on the bench in the war over evolution seems a bit shortsighted.\n\n• December 1, 2005 | 12:07 PM ET |\n\nThe president makes a speech for peace\n\nGood evening, my fellow Americans:\n\nTonight I want to talk to you on a subject of deep concern to all Americans and to many people in all parts of the world the war in Iraq.\n\nI believe that one of the reasons for the deep division about Iraq is that many Americans have lost confidence in what their Government has told them about our policy. The American people cannot and should not be asked to support a policy which involves the overriding issues of war and peace unless they know the truth about that policy.\n\n...\n\nThe war was causing deep division at home and criticism from many of our friends as well as our enemies abroad.\n\nIn view of these circumstances there were some who urged that I end the war at once by ordering the immediate withdrawal of all American forces.\n\nFrom a political standpoint this would have been a popular and easy course to follow.\n\n…\n\nFor the future of peace, precipitate withdrawal would thus be a disaster of immense magnitude.\n\nA nation cannot remain great if it betrays its allies and lets down its friends.\n\nOur defeat and humiliation in Iraq without question would promote recklessness in the councils of those great powers who have not yet abandoned their goals of world conquest.\n\nThis would spark violence wherever our commitments help maintain the peace in the Middle East, in Berlin, eventually even in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nUltimately, this would cost more lives.\n\nIt would not bring peace; it would bring more war.\n\nFor these reasons"
