Content Description Written on the British naval ship the Essex. Lieutenant General Bligh mentions issues with prisoners and says he was forced to land at Plymouth due to bad weather, but will soon continue to Portsmouth where he will await further orders. Written shortly after the British defeat during the expedition against St. Malo, France, 7-12 September 1758. Bligh, the commander in charge of the expedition, was attempting to follow up the successful August raid at Cherbourg, France. The expedition at St. Malo was mired by bad weather and logistics and the 7,000 soldiers that managed to land were forced to march nine miles to the Bay of St. Cas to escape. The retreat was slow and the numerically superior French army killed, wounded, or captured between 750 and 1000 British troops.
