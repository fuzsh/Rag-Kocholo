Illegal trade between the inhabitants of Nova Scotia and Cape Breton.\n\nd. Disturbing influence of Cape Breton French among Indians and inhabitants of Nova Scotia.\n\n3.

This collection consists of transcripts of extracts printed in \"Whitworth's Magazine\", Manchester, giving news and opinions sent by persons in Nova Scotia and elsewhere to correspondents in England.

The Vire Collection.\n\nb The Halifax Papers\n\nc. History of Cape Breton.\n\n2. The Vire Collection consists mainly of memoirs, notes and extracts from correspondence bearing upon Acadia. References to Louisbourg and Cape Breton are most frequent when the following topics were being discussed:\n\na. Pichon's services in North America.\n\nb. Comments on North American topography, etc.\n\nc. Pichon's \"Lettres et Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire du Cap Breton.\"\n\nd. The establishment, maintenance, and capitulation of Beauséjour.\n\ne. Friction between the English and the French in North America and its waters.\n\nf. Indian hostility to the English.\n\ng. Defence of Cape Breton.\n\nh. Problem of the Acadians.\n\ni. French Missionaries and Le Loutre\n\nJ. General observations on Anglo-French hostility North America.\n\nThere are very few concrete references to the town of Louisbourg or its fortifications. The one exception is the \"Note relative à la fortification d'une ville Louisbourg.\" which gives some details of the fortifications. Otherwise Louisbourg is referred to indirectly in documents whose main concern is with one of the above topics. An interesting description of the mission at Louisbourg is contained in \"Tableau de 1'état actuel des missions ... dans la partie meridionale de la Nouvelle France.\"\n\n3. The Halifax Papers: Photostat of correspondence between Pichon and British officers at Halifax, with memoranda and reports, 1754-1755. References to Louisbourg and Cape Breton are most frequent when the following topics were being discussed:\n\na. Pichon's service in North America\n\nb. French missionaries and Le Loutre.\n\nc. Beausejour.\n\nd. Acadians.\n\ne. Indian hostility to the English.\n\nThere are several references to the fortifications at Louisbourg, notably pp. 7-8, pp.9-19, pp. 108-109. Louisbourg is often mentioned as the channel through which orders flow to Beauséjour, as a base for Le Loutre's operations. Most of the references, however, are of little use in collecting details of the fortifications. The letters of Pichon often contain extracts of letters and orders from others, especially Le Loutre.\n\n4. History of Cape Breton: This collection consists of five letters written in both French and English. They were published anonymously by Pichon in 1760 under the title \"Lettres et Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire naturelle, civile, et politique du Cap Breton, etc.\" All the material in the first four letters concerns Cape Breton, while the fifth appears to deal only with Isle St. Jean. Details of Louisbourg and its fortifications are given in the first letter, and subsequent letters contain descriptions of the physical features of Cape Breton, its centres of Population, suggestions regarding its defence, and narratives of its political history.\n\nF 12 Pichon Papers\n\nSeries 1 Vire Collection: (transcript)\n\n33. pp. 1-13, Undated.

The section of this collection consulted consisted of photostats of the originals of photostats of the originals of 25 letters from Charles Lawrence, Lt. Governor of Nova Scotia, to Monckton, concerning the expedition against Beausejour, 1754-1755. These letters are selected from volumes 1 and 2 of the Vernon-Wager papers in the Library of Congress. 10 items were collected from this material.\n\n2. The 10 letters analyzed date from 1 February to 26 August 1755. The references to Louisbourg may be divided under the following heads:\n\na. Louisbourg as a source of intelligence of the arrival of the French ships in North America.\n\nb. Naval force at Louisbourg as a threat to the expedition against Beausejour.\n\nc. Suggestions which Lawrence offers to Monckton concerning the attack on Beausejour which are drawn from the experience of the Louisbourg expedition in 1745.\n\n3. In none of the letters are the fortifications or town described. In most of the letters the reference to Louisbourg does not form part of the main topic of the letter.\n\n4. The folio numbers given on the cards are those visible on small cards attached to the edges of the originals in the photostats.
