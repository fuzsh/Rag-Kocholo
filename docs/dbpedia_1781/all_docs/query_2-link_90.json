        "text": "Thanks Pieter. There was in fact a Dobson from the Corsham Court collection which was sold in 1840 and which I think is very likely to be the NMM picture.\n\nThere were three William Dobson portraits at Corsham in 1806 as per âAn Historical Account of Corsham Houseâ.\n\nThese were:\n\n1. Portrait of Sir Charles Lucas by William Dobson, unnumbered but after # 212 so technically #213 at page 60;\n\n2. Portrait of Thomas Killigrew by Dobson, 3 feet 2 inches x 2 feet 6 inches, #89 at p. 44;\n\n3. Head by Dobson 2 feet x 2 feet 6 inches, #170 at page 55.\n\nOn May 16, 1840, Christies held an auction (Lugt 15819) titled âRemoved from the Countryâ and which the auctioneerâs copy states âLord Methuen, Corsham Houseâ. There is one Dobson in it as Lot 26 as follows:\n\nâPortrait of Killigrew, in a pale red silk vest, his right hand resting on the hilt of his sword; very elegantâ\n\nThe buyer was Daubeny.\n\nMost interestingly, in a sale on May 20/21, 1842, (Lugt 16608) Christies sold as Lot 129 the following painting by William Dobson:\n\nâPortrait of a gentleman in a red dress, his hand resting upon the hilt of his sword; presumed to be Sir Charles Lucas; very elegant.â.\n\nThe seller was Daubeny. The purchaser was Morant.\n\nI believe that these transactions show the Methuen âKilligrewâ by Dobson, being sold in 1840 and then resold by Daubeny in 1842 but with the sitter changed from Killigrew to Sir Charles Lucas. The descriptions of the painting are almost the same. This explains the addition by Christies of the âpresumed to be Sir Charles Lucasâ (my high lighting) as a hint as its novelty. It was then purchased by Frederick Richard Say in 1842 and copied by Bone Jr. in 1843 and labelled with its new sitter identity of Sir Charles Lucas at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1843 noting that it was after a painting formerly in the Methuen collection.\n\nFurther confirmation is provided by the fact that the dimensions of the Killigrew painting in Methuenâs collection in 1806 had dimensions which nearly exactly match the NMM painting under discussion (38â x 30â versus 38â x 30.5â).\n\nThe Corsham Court âSir Charles Lucasâ never left the Corsham Collection. It was exhibited as Sir Charles Lucas by Dobson in 1937 in Bristol. I believe that it remains there today by now re-identified as Sir Richard Neville. It is referenced in Rogers 1993 at page 51 where this is said to be a copy of the original by Dobson of Sir Richard Neville in the Catalogue as Item 20 and now at the NPG. Rogers notes that these portraits were referred to as Sir Charles Lucas throughout the 19th and much of the 20th century. Accordingly it seems likely that this is the portrait of âSir Charles Lucasâ at page 60 of the 1806 History of Corsham. In any event it could not be the painting of Sir Charles Lucas sold out of the Methuen collection.\n\nAssuming that this analysis is correct, and the NMM painting is the former Methuen âKilligrewâ by Dobson, then a further link can be established as it is known that Methuen purchased the âKilligrewâ Dobson from the collection of the Duke of Chandos in 1747 (Lot 110, Cock, Sale May 7, 1747 â Lugt 665) where it is described as by Dobson and of âMr. Killigrew, half lengthâ and is shown as being purchased by Sr. P. Methuen.\n\nIt would be interesting to determine where Chandos bought it and which of the several Killigrews the sitter may have been. While the 1806 catalogue refers to it as of Thomas Killigrew several other entries, including that in the Chandos sale, are at pains to not specify.\n\nCould there be a Killigrew with a nautical connection? I note that apparently William Killigrew had Charles I appoint him ambassador to Constantinople which he attempted to have implemented in 1646. Could the NMM portrait be connected with this unusual but apparently important ambition for him? Though possible, when working from Wiliamâs appearance in the Van Dyck portrait (Tate T07896), this identification seems unlikely.\n\nOf course the Killigrew identification may also be wrong but it may allow further investigation into the acquisition by Chandos of the painting and from there other options for the sitter.\n\nThe Killigrew family genealogy for this era and the history of the family is wonderfully detailed the Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall, Volume 9, Part 1, that is available online.\n\nHopefully this link will work but see pp. 178-182 for genealogies\n\nhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3OAKAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA182&lpg=PA182&dq=Martin+Lister+Killigrew.&source=bl&ots=wGh3-ul4lm&sig=ACfU3U1rolS5aC99qfp4J8dxnVZBJ1Cdyw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj5pIeO2PfgAhWjQxUIHQciAr44ChDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=Martin Lister Killigrew.&f=false\n\nAs you will see, it shows the family split into three lines, according to the 3 sons of John Killigrew (d. 1567), and gives a comprehensive set of possibilities for the sitter from this family, at least.\n\nProbably the question of who this portrait depicts is going to need to be resolved by tracing the provenance. I would note that Susan Jenkins in her book âPortrait of a Patronâ that describes Duke of Chandosâ collection, describes the Dobson as of âMrs Killigrewâ, though I doubt this, given Douglasâs post above.\n\nAs Douglas notes, the portrait come from the Duke of Chandos from a sale in 1747. Note that the Chandos and the Killigrew families are connected: George Bridges, 6th Baron Chandos was the brother-in-law of the dissolute Henry Killigrew (son of the Thomas the dramatist mentioned in Pieterâs note who has traditionally been thought to be the sitter). This Henry was Groom of the Bedchamber to James Duke of York, and both he and the 6th Baron married daughters of John Savage, Second Earl Rivers. That this is indeed a portrait of Thomas Killigrew might have to be taken more seriously (and I think that having Urania in the background might not be out of keeping). Thomasâs brother, Henry, was certainly in Oxford in 1643. He was a military (naval?) chaplain, and preached before the King in 1643 (and published his sermon that is on EEBO).\n\nWe may be able to get further. First, most of the Killigrew family died out (as the history of the family in the link shows), but one became Admiral Henry Killigrew who died in 1712. He had a collection of pictures (including many by his sister, the artist and poet Anne Killigrew) and his collection was sold in a sale in 1727. I wonder if the sale records might also contain the Dobson? The sale famously had six of Henryâs sistersâ pictures.\n\nSecond, the Duchess of Chandos wife of the first Duke, also knew a âMrs. Killigrewâ, as she is mentioned in a letter to her from Letitia Cornwallis (spinster, sister of Cassandra, wife of Sir William More Molyneux). Importantly, this letter is from 1727 and states that âGood Mrs Killigrew is at her last gasp.â Sure enough, Anne Killigrew died in 1727 who was the youngest daughter and co-heiress of the âmain branchâ of the family; of Sir Peter Killigrew, 2nd Baronet (1634â1705), heritor of the Peter Killigrew who was in Oxford with the King at the time Dobson was painting, and a candidate for this painting. She probably had the family pictures. She became the wife of Martin Lister (1666â1745), but under the terms of her father's will he adopted the additional surname of Killigrew, so she was still called Killigrew when she died. Their marriage was childless, ending this Killigrew line somewhat, although he died later, in 1745 (and wrote the family history that is in the link). So there is a chance that this portrait was either sold or bequeathed to the Chandos family by him. His Will would be one avenue.\n\nThird, one of the sonâs of Sir Henry Killigrew (erstwhile Ambassador to France, died 1602) was another Sir Henry Killigrew, and he commanded the Castle at the 5 month siege of Pendennia in 1646, and after surrendering, somehow got to St. Malo where he died very shortly after, of his wounds, in 1646. Being nautical, he is surely a candidate for this portrait (or perhaps his son, also called Henry, about which I know nothing).\n\nFourth, Sir Peter Killigrew (âPeter the Postâ, who passed messages from Charles I and the exiled Queen and Prince) married Mary Lucas, so his sister in law was an attendant of Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of King Charles I, with whom she went into exile in France. In 1644 she departed from his home from Pendennis Castle. Surely he would have been part of this expedition. Is the ship in our portrait a messenger ship? A ship of flight?\n\nMore questions, but hopefully some leads.\n\nGeorge Vertue Notebooks II, Walpole Society Volume XX, p.58 - Vertue attended (at least the viewing) the Sale in December 1727 - he then lists a number of paintings in the catalog by Anne Killigrew which were sold at Admiral Killigrew's sale. This was part of his notes re Anne Killigrew and not a general description of the sale.\n\nMore generally, I have been giving this some further attention and excluding options.\n\nIn particular at this point I am assuming that it was not in the Chandos collection in 1725 as a result of its absence from the ST-83 Inventory which appears to have been very thorough. It is unlikely to have been misidentified as one of the other paintings shown as Dobsons. While it appears that the Sir Giles Brydges portrait is highly unlikely to have been a Dobson in the first place, a portrait of Sir Giles stayed with the family and was at Thornham Hall after the third Duke moved there (interestingly, but of no relevance to this discussion, Thornham had previously been owned by the descendants of Thomas Killigrew). What may well be the Dobson by Dobson, looks to have descended again through the family and ended up at Stowe where it was sold as Lot 13 on the 21st Day of the Sale in 1848.\n\nAs a result the âMr. Killigrewâ by Dobson would have entered the Chandos collection between 1725 and 1747.\n\nChandos was in significant retrenchment mode by that time and was thus making far fewer purchases.\n\nAs a result it may be instructive to check the possibility that it could entered the collection as a result of inheritance or marriage (or both if one of his wives inherited it). As well the first Duke had passed away in 1744 so it is possible that it could have been acquired by his son the second Duke and added to the 1747 sale although this seems less likely (possibly in exchange for family portraits which they wanted to keep in the family?).\n\nI have also been working on the Killigrew family angle. I have downloaded and reviewed a number of Killigrew Wills (Thomas d. 1683, William d. 1695, Henry d.1712, Lucy d. 1729) none of which are of assistance at this point. The early history of the Killigrew family portraits (including the Van Dycks) seems unclear. It has been suggested that Sir Thomas Killigrew d. 1683, was the source for many of them but there is no reference to them in his Will. His own single portrait by Van Dyck, now at Weston Park was already out of his possession at his death â having been owned for some time previously by Sir Peter Lely and out of whose collection it was sold in 1682. Interestingly so was the lovely portrait of Thomasâ sister Anne â Mrs. Kirke.\n\nI am currently pursuing some other Chandos angles.\n\nWhile continuing to investigate the source for the Chandos Killigrew by Dobson, I wanted to at least make another suggestion for the sitter. I recognise that these suggestions are speculative but at least serve to being together several otherwise disparate strands of information.\n\nThis relates to some extent to the iconography. It seems curious to me that at a time when the vast majority of the Dobson output had a specific military emphasis â armour, leather jackets, pistols and swords, the current sitter is in very fine civilian clothing with his right hand on an elegant sword and his left with a piece of paper. From a brief review of other portraits by Dobson I am not aware of the same combination in any other work. There are many accoutred for war â Colonel Richard Neville, Sir Charles Lucas, John, Baron Byron, and a few with a paper, Sir Richard Fanshawe and Sir Thomas Aylesbury.\n\nAs a possible solution I suggest that the meaning is the obvious one â a role which combines the sword and the pen. Working from the Fanshawe portrait the paper may mean that the sitter was a diplomat. However the sword and the ship and Urania elements might indicate a most unusual type of diplomat where it combines both a diplomatic and also a governance role with overseas trade. I believe that a good candidate for this might be the Ambassadorship to Constantinople (sometimes referred to as to Turkeyâ).\n\nThis was a particularly unusual posting and there was an active dispute between the King and the Levant Company as to who enjoyed the right to the appointment as well as the removal of the then current incumbent, Sir Sackville Crow. This dispute raged on through 1644-1646 and is discussed at length by Daniel Goffman in âBritons in the Ottoman Empire 1642-1660â.\n\nThe position was also a lucrative one. Charles was anxious to control the appointment both for reasons of sovereignty as well as possible revenue. The Levant Company wanted to maintain control themselves to protect their economic interests. Parliament was interested in over-riding Charlesâ power for the same reasons.\n\nIt is worthwhile exploring the material provide by James re the Killigrew family and particularly Sir Peter Killigrew.\n\nWhile it has always been stated that Charlesâ nominee to replace Crow was Sir William Killigrew, there are indications that it was not as simple as that.\n\nIt is important to understand that at the Stuart Court there were two branches of the Killigrew family present â who were second cousins once removed. Both branches were descended from Sir John III Killigrew of Arwenack.\n\nSir William Killigrew, (1605-1695), of whom we have heard the most and who is given as the sitter in the Van Dyck portrait at the Tate, was descended from John IIIâs third and by far the youngest son, Sir WiIliiam Killigrew (1555-1622). Most importantly, his father was Sir Robert Killigrew (1580 - 1633) who held numerous important and highly lucrative posts under King James I. He also managed to obtain the governorship of Pendennis Castle, a traditional Killigrew family post. The much coveted position had been taken from Sir John V Killigrew (1567-1605) of the senior branch of the family due a failure to properly maintain it â much less as a result of his free-booting ways â a continuation of the alleged piracy of his father Sir John IV and his wife the notorious female pirate Mary Wolverston Killigrew.\n\nSir Robert achieved a grant to himself and his son Sir William by survivorship.\n\nHowever Sir John VI Killigrew (1583-1633) subsequently attempted to revive their family fortunes â apparently through usefulness to the Duke of Buckingham. As Sir John was childless the beneficiaries were his brothers. Sir Peter Killigrew (1593?-1667) went to court and acted as a diplomatic courier to then Prince Charles during his famous trip to Madrid in 1623 to seek the hand of the Spanish Infanta. He obviously continued to enjoy the Kingâs favour as Charles intervened with Thomas Lucas in September 1625 to allow Peter Killigrew to marry his daughter Mary (the sister of Sir Charles Lucas and Margaret Lucas later the Marchioness and eventually Duchess of Newcastle). They married in October 1625. In fact Thomas Lucas died shortly before his daughterâs marriage. Shortly thereafter The King advised the Court of Wards to âshow all possible favourâ to the widow and mother of the underage heir âfor Mr. Killigrewâs sakeâ. On November 17 1625 Peter Killigrew received a pension from the King of 200 pounds. This was rounded off when Sir Peter was knighted at Charlesâ coronation in December 1625.\n\nSubsequently during the Civil War he acted as a confidential courier between Parliament and Charles in negotiations for a settlement.\n\nIn short, he appears to have been liked and trusted by both the King and Parliament.\n\nIt is, therefore, of interest that Charles appears to have proposed him as a replacement for Crow as ambassador to Constantinople.\n\nGoffman notes at p 84 that in May 1646 Crow had heard that Sir Peter Killigrew had been dispatched as âAmbassador-Designateâ to replace him. While I have not yet been able to find documentary proof Goffman at p. 239 footnote 45 states that the King did indeed propose Peter Killigrew for the position.\n\nHowever there appears evidence that Sir William Killigrew considered the post his and had appeared before the Directors of the Levant Company claiming that he had Charlesâ commission (Goffman p.90). There is certainly documentary proof that Sir William had been promised the appointment but by exactly who is more difficult to determine. In May 1645 Lord Jermyn writing to Lord Digby (CSP 1644-1645 p513) says that he â ie Jermyn is determined to support Sir William. However this is as against Sir Richard Browne who Jermyn says has Parliamentâs support. Jermyn was Sir Williamâs first cousin. In November the following year the Queen (quite possibly at Jermynâs urging) wrote to Charles that there is an engagement for Sir William to have the post with Sir Richard Browne thereafter if Killigrew cannot get the Levant Companyâs approval.\n\nWhile it is possible that Goffman has confused the two Killigrewâs it seems at least as likely, that Charles had in fact proposed Sir Peter Killigrew (which was passed on to Sir Sackville Crow) but that as Crowâs removal dragged on, the Queen gave Jermyn assurances that Sir William could have the post and so wrote to Charles. Sir William then tried to force the issue by appearing before the Levant Company realising that if he could get their approval he would stand the best chance of getting the King to confirm the Queenâs promise.\n\nIn the event the Company refused and proposed a merchant candidate Edward Barnard instead and ultimately agreed on a compromise candidate Sir Thomas Bendish (c.1607â1674).\n\nIt certainly has the hallmarks of Charlesâ usual disastrous policy of telling different people different things.\n\nCould the Dobson portrait be Sir Peter Killigrew who had it painted after the Kingâs decision to appoint him only to be disappointed after interventions by the Queen in favour of Sir William?\n\nIf one accepts the proposition that it is a portrait of an ambassador to Constantinople / Turkey, then it could be any of Sir William Killigrew, Sir Peter Killigrew or Sir Thomas Bendish.\n\nThe sitterâs apparent age would favour would favour Sir William or Sir Thomas as they were both in their late thirties / early forties in 1645/46. However Sir William appears ruled out by comparison of the sitterâs appearance to the Tate portrait long said to represent Sir William. Sir Thomas only appears to have entered the picture late in 1646 and Dobson died on October 28, 1646 so the timelines are tight and would have need to have occurred after Dobsonâs return to London in 1646.\n\nThe sitterâs apparent age works against Sir Peter who would have been in his early fifties if one accepts the usual birthdate. However he otherwise has much to recommend him.\n\nI am not aware of any portraits or representations of either Sir Peter or Sir Thomas.\n\nOn a finishing note, there is a further linkage to Chandos if one follows this analysis. The first Duke of Chandos was the grandson of Sir Henry Barnard, âTurkey Merchantâ who was very likely related to Edward Barnard. Sir Henryâs mercantile connections seem to have led to the appointment of his son-in-law James Brydges, 8th Lord Chandos, the first Dukeâs father, as Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire in 1680. Indeed his portrait as Ambassador hangs today in the British embassy in Ankara.\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:8thLordChandos.jpg"
