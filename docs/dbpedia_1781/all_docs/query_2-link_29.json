The researches of Mr. Blanchard, partly given in his \"History of the Northwest,\" and his \"Historical Map of the United States,\" led to this more detailed work on the State of Illinois, as the most permanent and desirable form of presenting the valuable data on the history of the State which has been gathered by him through years of labor.\n\nA trite saying, \"stick a pin there,\" as alluding to the establishment of a fact and its proper location, has been kept in mind in this work, and Mr. Blanchard has stuck pins and labeled them all over the State, simplifying and localizing its history, so plainly that \"he who runs may read.\"\n\nTHE PUBLISHERS.\n\n5\n\nIntroduction.\n\nTwo large valleys extend into the innermost centre of a continent, and a broad plateau of fertile soil intervenes between them. This is Illinois — a connecting link and portage ground from one of them to the other. Had it been an arid waste or an impregnable mountain uplift, it would have been a barrier — a separatrix between them; but, in the economy of Nature, the national interests of Illinois are inseparably connected with those of both.\n\nFrom its first discovery, the physical geography of this country attracted the attention of the French, and their early occupation of it shows the importance they attached to it. Three nations have contended for possession of it — Spain, France and England, but a new nation possesses it by right of \"manifest destiny.\"\n\nTo leave her history out of American records would leave an unbridged chasm — it would be like cutting off the tap root of a tree and leaving its trunk without support.\n\nWhen the Jamestown and Plymouth colonies were contending with a stubborn soil, their ambitions limited to their daily wants, France was laying the dimension stone in the Illinois country for the central base of her American empire, and to this end she built Ft. Chartres here, the most impregnable fortress then known in the Western World. These high hopes\n\n6\n\nthat she then cherished have been realized — not by her, but by a new nation, and it is not too much to say that the history of Illinois records a past and presages a future that finds a parallel only in the history of the United States, of which it forms so important a part, and anything that affects her affects the whole. If the centre is jarred, the circumference is shaken.\n\nYouth of Illinois: You who are to inherit such responsibilities may laudably feel a State pride which will heighten your ambition to do honor to her name.\n\nTHE AUTHOR\n\nWHEATON, JUNE, 1883.\n\n7\n\nAuthorities Consulted.\n\nState papers and public documents, the current historic literature of the Northwest, and many rare works now out of print have been at my command in the preparation of this work.\n\nBut besides all these, I owe lasting obligations to Mr. J. G. Shea, of New York, whose contribution cites authorities not to be questioned regarding the settlement of Kaskaskia. This will confer a favor on many writers who have heretofore been in doubt, both as to the date and circumstances attending this early settlement and mission; to Mr. H. W. Beckwith, of Danville, Ill., whose chapter on the Indian tribes of Illinois, with maps accompanying, is compiled from researches of many years in this department of the history of our State; to Mr. E. M. Haines, of Waukegan, Ill., whose chapter on the Indian names of Illinois will be gratefully received by all who wish to retain these examples of the beauty and euphony of the Algonquin language; to Mr. Joseph Gillespie, of Edwardsville, Ill., whose contribution on early settlements is made largely from his personal knowledge, he having come to the State in 1819; to Mr. Aaron W. Kellogg, of Springfield, for his article on the powers and responsibilities of the State offices, and the duties of each department in the present government of the state; to Mr. Milo Erwin, of Marion, for information regarding the route of General George Rogers Clarke to Kaskaskia\n\n8\n\nand Vincennes; and, finally, to the many early settlers throughout the State whom I have had the pleasure to meet and consult, and whose valued aid has enabled me to date and locate many events that enhance the value of the work, and in some cases establish historical data that might otherwise have been lost.\n\n9\n\nChapter I — Discovery.\n\nThe student of history delights in a good foundation on which to start to write history, without which, it is like beginning in the middle of a story.\n\nJamestown was the starting place for American National History. The men who in 1607 settled there were loyal to English institutions and to everything that was English whether it was law, religion or politics. Some of them were too lazy to work but not too lazy to fight, some of them could do both, all of them were pets of the English Government, and subsequently this colony was the first to repel French aggression when the territorial issue between France and England came up in 1753.\n\nThe settlement of 1620 at Plymouth was the next. The men who composed this were essentially different from the Jamestown colonists. The sublime principles of English liberty to them were no empty name. They meant every thing they said, and to them they meant religious as well as civil liberty. That they were pioneers in both, the sequel proved, for though they were at first a sort of elephant on the hands of the crown that it was glad to get rid of, they subsequently led the way to reforms and improvements in State affairs that the parent government was forced by the progress of civilization to adopt. They also laid the foundation of our American institutions as they are to day, and the laws of Illinois as well as those of all other States of the Union are the fruitage of the seed they planted on the coast of Massachusetts, but modified\n\n10\n\nto suit the demands of a more practical age, and an age of still broader religious freedom than they ever thought of or would have advocated. The seed they planted grew into a larger tree than the parent plant, and all because the soil of the west was richer and its fields larger. Hence the source of the political, social, religious and educational laws and customs of Illinois, for these grew from the church, the school-house and from fireside attractions that make the young and the old love their homes. The history of all this is made interesting by even the pictures on the walls of these homes. Our poetry, our romance and our drama are based on this history; and even our family pride would lose its point if not associated with its grandeur.\n\nThe discovery and exploration of the Illinois Country, as it was called at first, forms a chapter in history full of varied material for the historic pen. Spain took the lead in American discoveries during the reign of Charles V., who was then the most powerful monarch of Europe. The large amounts of gold brought by his fleets from the new world, stimulated the ambition of the French king to participate in western adventures, and to this end an expedition was planned to explore its northern coast sufficiently remote from the Spanish claims of Florida not to come in competition with with them. The command of the expedition was given to Jacques Cartier, it sailed from St. Malo in the spring of 1534, Charles V. protested against its sailing to make discoveries in the new world which he claimed as the heritage of Spain alone, to which Francis the French king replied \"I should like to see the clause in Father Adam's will and testament which bequeaths to Spain alone so vast an heritage.\"\n\nThe Gulf of St. Lawrence was entered directly after the arrival of Cartier's fleet and he named it after the Saint whose name it bears. The following spring he returned, pushed his way up the St. Lawrence river and wintered in the vicinity of Quebec among the Indians who entertained their new guests with the best they had. As soon as navigation opened the\n\n11\n\nnext spring Cartier returned to France and reported what he had seen.\n\nThe great highway to the interior had been opened to view, but it appeared like a barren discovery for it was not then known what laid beyond the rock-clad headlands of the St. Lawrence, and it was not till 1608 that the French colonized their possessions on its banks. This was done under King Henry IV. by Samuel de Champlain at Quebec. Here began on the waters of the St. Lawrence the work of exploration destined to bring to light the entire Valley of the Mississippi to which it was at that time the only avenue, for the Spanish guarded the Gulf of Mexico with a jealous eye, and to have approached the interior across the country would not have been allowed by the Five Nations or Iroquois, who then held the intervening country between it and the Hudson river as far south as the Allegheny mountains.\n\nChamplain established French authority at Quebec and as soon as the natural obstacles to further explorations would admit of it French missionaries and French fur traders pushed forward into the interior and established forts and mission houses. In 1615 Champlain himself on a tour of exploration discovered Lake Huron and named it after a tribe of Indians on its shores.\n\nIn 1641 French missionaries had reached the outlet of Lake Superior, and in 1658 traders had reached its western extremity and made the acquaintance of the Sioux — the same warlike nation whose descendants, under their chief Sitting Bull, overwhelmed the army of General Custer among the Black Hills in 1877, killing all but one of them. From them the first tidings of \"the great river that flowed southward to the sea,\" came to the French. This information stimulated their zeal to explore it. and to this end Father Marquette, a priest, and Joliet, a trader, under patronage of Talon, Intendent of Canada while Frontenac was Governor, started with two canoes and five service men from the mission of St. Ignace, opposite the island of Macinac. Holding their course along the\n\n12\n\nnorthern shore of Lake Michigan, they soon entered the waters of Green Bay, and arriving at its head they rested a short time at the mission of St. Francis Xavier, which had been established four years previously. From this outermost limit of French occupation they took their final departure from the abodes of civilization into the great unknown wilderness before them. By the advice of the Indians they were directed into the path which led to the elbow in the Wisconsin river at the present site of Portage. Here they launched their two bark canoes into the river and continued on their way till its mouth was reached in the rolling surges of the Mississippi, whose turbulent waters contrasted strangely with the Wisconsin, which held its quiet course sometimes under the brow of a precipice and sometimes in a deep channel through prairie sand-bars. Marquette was delighted with the discovery of \"the great river,\" then without a name, and he christened it the Conception River in honor of his patron saint, \"the Blessed Virgin.\" The discovery was made on the 17th of June, 1673. Down its current the travelers passed through the great amplitude of wild nature that spread out in limitless prairies on either side, and on which countless herds of buffalo found pasturage. No signs of human life had yet been seen in the immense country through which they had passed since they left the mission house at Green Bay, but on their arrival at the mouth of the Des Moines river human foot-prints were discovered on its banks.\n\nThis excited the explorers, especially Marquette, whose chief object was to bring the light of the gospel to new nations, while that of Joliet was to open a way for French alliances with the inhabitants of the country, with an ultimate view of occupying it jointly with the natives after they had been converted to Christianity under the teaching of the missionaries. The loving relations between the French and the Indians were always consistent with this theory, but fortune in the future had a different fate in store for both. The footprints seen by\n\n13\n\nthe explorers were followed, and after two leagues three Indian villages were seen on the banks of the Des Moines. They were of the Peoria tribe of the Illinois Indians, and now an interview between the French and these tribes is about to take place. Soon as the approach of the strangers had attracted the attention of the villagers, four chiefs advanced to meet them. \"Who are you?\" called out Marquette in Algonquin dialect. \"We are Illini,\" replied one of their chiefs. This word in their language meant men, and therefore the word Illini was not intended to be understood in a generic sense by them, but as significant of the humane intentions which they vouchsafed towards their distinguished guests, and which profession they never dishonored in their future intercourse with them. They also intended by this reply to distinguish themselves from the Iroquois, whom they stigmatized as beasts on account of their cruel modes of warfare, the force of which they had felt. A pleasant interview followed, in which the Indians entertained their visitors with the best varieties of food their hands could prepare, among which the \"delicious\" dog meat was not forgotten. The rest was made up of buffalo meat, fish and hominy.\n\nMarquette never lost an opportunity to advocate Christianity to his savage hearers, and on this occasion told them of the crucifixion of Christ and the plan of salvation, all of which was politely received by his untutored audience, whose desire to cultivate the good will of the French was stimulated by fear of the Iroquois, from whose invasions they looked to them for protection.\n\nWith friendship on both sides the explorers took their leave the next morning, which was the 25th of June, and continued their course down the river.\n\nOn arriving at the mouth of the Ohio, a roving band of Indians were met. They were armed with guns, probably obtained from the English colonists. A few pleasant courtesies were exchanged with them, and the travelers passed on\n\n14\n\nand were soon buried in the gloomy forests of cottonwood that shadow the banks of this river in its immensity below the mouth of the Ohio — majestic in its monotony and grand in its solitude.\n\nThrough these silent realms they made their way along with the current to the vicinity of the Arkansas river, where the scene changed. Here was life again, and a different people. The young men assailed them with their war clubs, but happily the old men came to the rescue in time to prevent any damage by ordering a suspension of hostilities. Pending this new danger, Marquette presented the calumet and called upon the Holy Virgin to protect them, and in his devotion gave to her all the glory for their deliverance.\n\nA friendly interview followed, and the explorers were conducted with much ceremony to the houses of the natives and feasted with fish and hominy, the dishes from which they ate being earthenware of native manufacture. The night was spent among them, though not without misgivings as to the abiding character of the hastily improvised friendship which these southern tribes had made up.\n\nThe ever-ready gospel was dispensed to them through an interpreter who understood the Illinois tongue in which Marquette addressed his passionless audience, and the next day, which was the 19th of July, the explorers started on their return.\n\nFrom what they had already seen, they were convinced that the \"great river\" emptied into the Gulf of Mexico, and to go farther would be exceedingly dangerous, not only from the Indians, but from Spanish explorers who might be encountered on the lower waters of the river.\n\nConstant toiling at the oar in a few weeks brought them to the mouth of the Illinois river, into which they entered and kept up the stream till the village of the Kaskaskias, near the present site of Utica, was reached. Here they were again received with true Illinois friendship of no doubtful character.\n\n15\n\nAfter the inevitable feast of sagamite (hominy), added to which w as the equally inevitable blessing of the pious missionary, the journey was again resumed under an escort of Indian guides who volunteered to accompany the Frenchmen to the Chicagou portage. 'Twas in the month of September when they arrived at the place, then a broad waste of grass and prairie flowers, channeled by two lazy streams that met from opposite directions and, united, flowed, or rather formed a connection, with the lake. This was Chicago as nature made it and as these men, who were unquestionably its first discoverers, saw it. The Indians and the Frenchmen here parted company, the former starting back to their home, and the latter coasting along the west bank of Lake Michigan toward Canada. On arriving at a point opposite the mission of St. Francis Xavier, Marquette, being sadly in need of rest, in consequence of sickness, took refuge at the mission-house, while Joliet continued on his route to Canada to report what the two had discovered to Frontenac, the governor. On the 25th of the following October, Father Marquette was partially recovered from his malady, and set out on a return trip to visit the Kaskaskia village on the Illinois river. Two young Frenchmen, Pierre and Jacques, and a delegation of Indians sufficiently numerous to fill ten canoes, accompanied him. Their route was across a narrow neck of land intervening between the head of Green Bay and Lake Michigan by a portage, thence along the shore of the lake to the Chicago river.\n\n'Twas the 4th of December when he arrived at this then desolate portage. The river was sheeted over with ice, which suspended canoe navigation, but what was far more unfortunate, the Father was again prostrated by a return of his malady. To proceed was impossible, and to remain at the comfortless place was a grievous, but the only alternative.\n\nA cabin was built, probably on the south ranch of the Chicago river towards its source, which at that time was what has since been called Mud Lake. This lake was a succession\n\n16\n\nof sloughs connecting with the Desplaines river, and forming good canoe navigation all the way in high water, but during the summer months was drained of its surplus waters and left a stagnant pool. The two faithful companions of the invalid did their best to keep him comfortable as far as the hasty cabin which they made for him could do it. The Father kept a journal, and from it we learn that roving bands of Indians sometimes visited him and brought game, and that not far distant a trader had recently established a post, and lie sometimes brought such succor to the missionary as the wilderness afforded.\n\nWinter did not break till late in March, on the 30th of which month, says the journal, the ground on which the cabin stood was overflowed by an excessive rain, and they were forced to leave the spot for a more elevated one. The last item on his journal bears date of April 6th, and two days later he was at the Kaskaskia village, near where Utica now stands, from which it would appear that the freshet had carried the canoe in which they traveled rapidly to the place.\n\nHere the devout missionary exerted himself to his utmost limit to establish a mission among the Illinois tribes, who appear to have won his solicitude from the firSt. He named the mission The Immaculate Conception, and spent his last vital energies in it to bring to the understanding of his willing but unteachable hearers the Christian plan of salvation.\n\nAfter remaining a few days with his savage flock, he felt that he could barely survive long enough to reach Canada, and he with his companions started on their return. They chose their route along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. On arriving at the place now known as Sleeping Bear Point, he died at their place of encampment on the shore, and was buried by his attendants. The next year his remains were disinterred by a band of Indians, carried to the Mission of Saint Ignace, just opposite Mackinaw, and buried beneath the chapel with impressive ceremony. In 1877 an attempt was made to\n\n17\n\ndiscover his bones, which resulted in finding two of them only.The record of his discovery of the Mississippi will be as enduring as our literature. It forms the opening chapter of our State history, and cannot fade into oblivion as long as our nation lasts.\n\n18\n\nChapter II — The French in Illinois.\n\nWhen Joliet parted from Marquette at Green Bay, as told in the foregoing chapter, he kept on his route towards Canada, stopping on the way at Fort Frontenac, at the outlet of Lake Ontario. Here he met Robert de La Salle, who held command of the place. Already he had distinguished himself by his discovery of the Ohio river five years previously, and it is hardly to be doubted that the two explorers conferred together as to the geography of the country, and especially as to the new discovery of the Mississippi, of which Joliet had ample notes and maps, just made by himself, while treading the first pathway made by white men through the interior.\n\nAfter leaving Fort Frontenac, Joliet had the misfortune to lose all the records of his discovery by the upsetting of his canoe in the St. Lawrence river, just above Montreal, and through the delay occasioned by this accident, or some other cause not now known, no official account of his discovery was published till 1681, at which date it appeared on Thevenot's map, issued at Paris, and reproduced by various others since. Marquette drew a map of the \"Conception river,\" together with the outlines of the lakes, which was a marvel of accuracy considering the material he had to work with. It has been republished by Shea, and copied from his reprint by many others. The original is now in St. Mary's College, Montreal.\n\nAfter the interview between Joliet and La Salle, the latter at once determined to utilize the work so auspiciously begun by extending the exploration of the Mississippi to its mouth,\n\n19\n\nand ultimately establishing a colony there. The St. Lawrence valley the lake country, and the entire valley of the Mississippi were but the limits of his ambition. On these France to be reproduced in the New World, and the Illinois country was to be the central base of operations wherewith to accomplish these designs. The first step to be taken in this direction was to secure a foothold at the eastern extremity of Lake Erie by building a fort at the place.\n\nThe Senecas, an Iroquois tribe, held this country at the time and it required no small amount of persuasion, accompanied with several \"fathoms of tobacco\" and other presents, to overcome the misgivings of these Indians as to the policy of allowing the fort to be built, but La Salle was equal to the emergency, obtained their consent, and built the fort in 1678, at the mouth of the Niagara river.\n\nThe next year he built a vessel above the falls and named it The Griffin. She was launched early in the spring, and in the following summer was loaded with her cargo, which consisted of a forge, ship carpenter's tools, and the iron work for a vessel to be built on the banks of the Illinois river. With this vessel La Salle intended to go down the Mississippi river to its mouth, and there establish a colony with which to hold the whole country drained by its waters.\n\nWith this design he set sail in the Griffin on the 7th of August, 1679. Thirty-four men joined him, most of whom were those enlisted in his service. Tonty, his faithful lieutenant, and four priests, prominent among whom was Hennepin, were included in the number. The vessel safely arrived at Green Bay, where her cargo was unloaded and transferred to small boats, thence to be transported to the Illinois river with the men, while the Griffin was loaded with a cargo of furs and sent back to the place from whence she came.\n\nAt that time there were two traveled routes from the Illinois river country to Lake Michigan, both of which were older history. One was by the way of the Desplaines and\n\n20\n\nChicago rivers, between which was a portage of about nine miles, except in very high water, at which time Mud Lake connected the two. The other was by the way of the St. Joseph river to the elbow where South Bend, Indiana, now is, thence by a portage to the source of the Kankakee river, and down it to the Illinois. La Salle chose the latter, and, after much detention by storm, he with his whole force arrived at the broadening of the Illinois river, where Peoria now is, about the first of January, 1680. Time was precious with him, and it was important that he should set about his work immediately. But before it could be begun, consent from the Indians to build a fort must be obtained, and consent to build a vessel was equally necessary before the work could safely be attempted. This was readily obtained from the pliant Illinois, and the work was begun. The fort, which was only a stockade of logs, was soon finished, and this was the first thing done on the soil of Illinois with a view to permanent occupation. It was situated on the eastern bank of the river, at the southern extremity of Peoria Lake, and named Fort Creve Coeur — Broken Heart. It was probably so named to memorize the hardships that had crossed the path of La Salle while concentrating his force and materials at this spot in the depths of a continent.\n\nThe keel was laid for the intended vessel near by the fort, but before work on it had advanced far, some of his men deserted, partly for want of pay, and, perhaps, partly through a disposition to cut loose from restraint in the broad creation of savage freedom then omnipresent in the Illinois country. This unlocked for hindrance made it necessary to suspend work on the vessel, but the end in view was not lost sight of, and La Salle determined to return to Canada to enlist a fresh force of men.\n\nOn the first of March he started with five companions, one of whom was an Indian. Winter still hung over the country, and the small streams were not yet released from its icy grasp,\n\n21\n\nand when the travelers had reached the upper tributaries of the Illinois river the canoes by which they came had to be abandoned, and all their supplies, including camp outfits, packed on their shoulders. When the western extremity of Lake Erie was reached, a canoe was made with which to perform the rest of their journey by water, and in it La Salle and one of the men embarked, after sending the other four up the Detroit to Michilimacinac to rest, for they were spent with fatigue and sickness. La Salle arrived at Fort Frontenac on the 6th of May. While he had been painfully toiling on foot through the oozy savannas of the forest to reach Canada for new recruits of men, disasters had been accumulating at the base of his operations in the front. Soon after his departure nearly the whole remaining force not only deserted but dismantled the fort and threw its contents into the river. This was done during the temporary absence of Tonty, whom he had left in command. Only six of the entire force had remained faithful, two of whom were priests. With these the heroic Tonty put forth his best efforts to inspire the respect of his savage companions till the return of La Salle to carry out his projects, for it was essential to his success to retain a foothold here. The deserters had done their worst, and the summer passed in the listless inaction of Indian communities when there is nothing to do but to cultivate a patch of corn, but on the 10th of September, sudden as a clap of thunder in a clear sky, came an Iroquois invasion. By a happy chance this advancing army had been espied in the distance at least a day's march away, and the news was carried in hot haste by fleet-footed runners to the Illinois village.\n\nThey were in no condition to defend themselves, but Tonty, who was their friend, just before the battle took it upon himself to act the part of a mediator, and even after the skirmishing had begun, interposed between the two armies and advanced into the Iroquois camp.\n\n22\n\nThe battle was suspended by this daring act, and the furious warriors gathered around him, some bent on killing him, while others, more considerate, lent an ear to his proposals. In vain he put forth his efforts to intimidate the haughty warriors by exaggerating the force of his allies, they were not to be balked of their prey, and Tonty was allowed to retire, but bleeding with a wound which a faithless warrior had given him in a fit of rage at his effrontery.\n\nIt was evident to Tonty that the Illinois would be worsted in the encounter, and inasmuch as his presence would not save them, he with his five companions started for the mission house at Green Bay. The Illinois fled down the river before their foes, leaving everything they possessed behind, the most valuable part of which was their corn. This was destroyed by the ruthless invaders, who then returned to their hunting grounds — the present State of New York — taking with them a large number of female prisoners who fell into their hands as the spoils of war. These were promptly adopted into their tribe as supernumerary wives for the warriors of the expedition.\n\nAt the first night's encampment of Tonty's party, Father Ribourde strolled away a short distance for prayer and meditation, when a renegade band of Kickapoos killed him, perhaps to win his scalp to dangle from one of their belts as an ornament, added to which might be the sacred cross of the Father desecrated into an Indian trinket.\n\nTonty's party reached their destination after the loss of Ribourde, but not without hardships and starvation, that taxed their endurance to its utmost limit, and here the discomfited fugitives rested for the winter.\n\nLa Salle had been successful in raising new recruits for his enterprise, and in his haste to reach the Illinois country had, with seven companions, pushed forward in advance, while the heavy material was being, transported by the main body.\n\n23\n\nOn arriving at the Illinois village, instead of an expected greeting from friends, the scene of the late destruction that had again thwarted his plans opened before him in dumb silence.\n\nThere were no signs of human life there, but when night came the yelps of wolves quarreling over the spoils of the battle field broke harshly upon its silence. Meantime the fate of Tonty hung in painful suspense, but as no trace of his body could be found among the ruins, hope partially relieved fear that he was among the slain.\n\nLa Salle with his party now retraced their steps to Fort Miamis, at the mouth of the St. Joseph river, where he met his advancing men, and here they all spent the winter.\n\nThe next spring La Salle set about the accomplishment of his plans. Instead of a vessel, canoes were to be used, maimed with Frenchmen and Indian allies. The preparations for even this simple mode of transportation required the whole summer and the following autumn.\n\nThe Indian tribes had to be conciliated, and an alliance formed between the Miamias and the Illinois for mutual protection against the Iroquois, which, strengthened by French alliance, satisfied the Western tribes, and they all acquiesced in La Salle's plans.\n\nThe mouth of the St. Joseph river was the place of rendezvous, and late in December had gathered there a convention of Indians, from whom La Salle selected 18, who, added to his 23 Frenchmen, made a force of 41 men; but among the Indians were 10 of their wives and three children, a requisition on the part of the red volunteers that La Salle did not see fit to disallow, though such an incumbrance must have been distasteful to him.\n\nTonty, who had been heard from and summoned to the spot, led the advance, starting on the 21st of December along the southern shore of lake Michigan. The \"Chicagou\" route had been determined on as the most direct, on arriving at which place the river was found to be frozen over. But little\n\n24\n\ndetention was caused by this, for Tonty set his men at work making sledges for transportation; and canoes, baggage, pappooses and camp equipage were loaded on them and hauled by the men rapidly over river and portage, till open water was reached on the Illinois. Here the sledges were abandoned and the canoe flotilla launched, which was to bear its diversified crew to distant and unknown lands, there to take possession of a destined French empire.\n\nIt arrived at the mouth of the Mississippi April 6, 1682 and here a large cross was erected and a plate of lead buried beside it, as monuments of French possession of the Mississippi valley. Prayers, chants and shouts followed, in which latter the guttural jargon of the Indians was mingled, probably with as little sense of the situation as the roaring of the sea that rolled its surges against this lonesome solitude. The country was named Louisiana, in honor of Louis XVI., and the explorers left the historic spot to tug their way up the current of the Mississippi.\n\nOn their arrival at the Illinois country, Tonty was constituted governor of it by La Salle, and now began the official line of organized government here, though there was nothing to govern at the time except a few zealous priests, who needed no restraint, and a large number of Indians whom no legal forms could restrain, added to whom were a score of fur-traders, untractable and lawless as birds of passage, and almost as transient in their erratic wanderings.\n\nThe first thing to do was to build a fort, without which no authority could exist even in form. The site for this was chosen on what is now the summit of Starved Rock, near Utica, on the Illinois river. This was done in December, 1682, and christened Fort St. Louis. It proved a refuge of safety, around which the Illinois tribes gathered with confidence, and again the rich valleys which its heights overlook swarmed with Indian life, bidding defiance to Iroquois invasion from under the guns of French allies.\n\n25\n\nThe cause of these invasions grew out of English rivalry in fur trade. Dongan, the colonial governor of New York, furnished the Iroquois with the material wherewith to make and these defiant warriors were ever ready to do his bidding, for they were dependent on the English for guns and ammunition as well as many rude implements of civilization, of which they had been taught the use.In like manner such Indians as were in alliance with the French espoused their cause against the English, and often made hostile incursions from Canada into the frontier English settlements adjacent. Governor Dongan's headquarters were at Albany, and from here he sent out men to intercept the trade of the French along the lakes, for even in this early day the Western trade was a coveted prize between the French of the St. Lawrence and the English of the Hudson river. This trade has now multiplied a thousand fold in value, and is chiefly secured to the Americans by the Erie canal and the various railroads that connect Illinois with the Atlantic seaboard.\n\nOn the return of La Salle to the Illinois country after his exploration of the Mississippi, he learned with painful regrets that Frontenac had been recalled from the governorship of Canada, and La Barre put in his place. He was no friend to La Salle, but, on the contrary, an enemy. He used his official authority against him by stopping all supplies from Canada intended for the Illinois country, which had now become the base of operations of the French in the interior, from which advances could be made to carry out any designs of French aggrandizement in the valley of the Mississippi, and if only a moderate effort could be made to keep a few men there supplied with ammunition, the trading interests would take care themselves and bring a revenue to the French crown.\n\nIn vain La Salle besought the new Governor to sustain him in carrymg out this policy. He was impervious to his entreaties sneered at his labors and his plans as worse than useless.\n\n26\n\nLa Salle now determined to go to France and make an appeal to the king, and with this resolution left the Illinois, country late in the autumn of 1683 for Canada. On his way he met a delegation from La Barre, under command of De Baugis, armed with authority to assume command of Fort St. Louis, and act as governor of the country. Tonty submitted to his authority, and there appears to have been a good understanding between him and the new governor. Tonty, with his characteristic force and courage, repelled an Iroquois invasion which soon followed although he was without official authority.\n\nLa Salle sailed for France, reached the ear of the king, and through the influence of his friends, together with his own force of purpose, secured the royal favor.\n\nNow the tables were turned. Tonty was restored to the governorship of the Illinois country, and La Salle himself was put in command of a fleet to sail for the mouth of the Mississippi and establish a French colony at the place. By mistake the fleet landed at Metagorda Bay, on the coast of Texas. Here the ill-fated colony languished for two years, at which time they were almost exhausted by disease and death, and La Salle formed the resolution of going back to the Illinois country to obtain succor. Selecting a few hardy companions he started, but was assassinated by one of his own men on the banks of the Trinity river. Seven of his party reached the Illinois in safety, but the hapless colony all perished in their forlorn hermitage. Tonty meantime held command at his post, protecting French interests there and establishing an authority which, but for the fortunes of the French and Indian war of the next century, would have made Illinois a French State, subject to a French king. The French settlements of Southern Illinois were permanent, and were the first substantial results of the foregoing discoveries and explorations. Much uncertainty has hitherto existed as to the date of the commencement of these settlements, but the following paragraph\n\n27\n\nwhich Mr. J. G. Shea has given to the writer will settle the question: \"THE MISSION OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION AMONG THE KASKASKIAS.\"\n\n\"This mission dates from September, 1673, when Father Marquette visited the Kaskaskias at their town on the upper Illinois river. It bore the name Kaskaskia, and consisted of sixty-nine cabins.\n\n\"It was on the Illinois river, about six miles below the mouth of the Fox river.Having promised to return and establish a mission among them, he set out in November, 1674, wintered at Chicago, and on Easter, 1675, reached Kaskaskia, beginning the mission under the name of the Immaculate Conception.Finding his malady increasing, he endeavored to reach Macinac, but died on the way. Father Claude Allouez renewed the mission April 27th, 1677, and continued it till La Salle's expedition reached Illinois. The Recollects began a mission at Fort Creve Coeur, but none at Kaskaskia, and the mission there soon closed. Allouez subsequently returned, and was succeeded in 1690 by Father James Gravier, who established the mission on a firm basis about 1693.\n\n\"When the French began a settlement at the mouth of the Mississippi in 1699, several northern tribes prepared to go down and settle there. The Kaskaskias went to the Mississippi in 1700, but were induced to wait and settle at the present Kaskaskia. The mission and town retained the old name.\n\n\"THE MISSION AT CAHOKIA AND TAMAROA.\"\n\n\"This mission was founded about 1700 by Father Francis Pinet, but the next year the mission was transferred from the\n\n28\n\nJesuits to priests sent from the seminary of Quebec. Rev. Mr. Burgur was the firSt. After a time they confined themselves to the care of the French settlers and left the Indians to the Jesuits.The Quebec priests remained at Tamaroa till the fall of French power.\"\n\nNot long after the settlements of Kaskaskia and Cahokia, the circumstances of which have just been told by Mr. Shea, other French towns were established near by them, altogether constituting a thriving settlement midway between Canada and the settlements at the mouth of the Mississippi river. To protect them Fort Chartres was built, being finished in 1720. It was at that time the strongest fort in North America. Some relics of it still remain as a monument of French power in Illinois, but part of it has been undermined by the wearing away of the river bank, while much of the stone of which it was originally built has been appropriated for private use. No hostile shot was ever fired against its walls, and if French power had been as invulnerable against attack at her outermost limits as at this place, she would have remained the great power in America till political revolution had wrought what foreign foes were unable to do.\n\n29\n\nChapter III — Illinois Under English Rule.\n\nFrom the previous chapter it is seen that French possessions in America extended from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico, including in its still but partially explored territory the whole country drained by the St. Lawrence and Mississippi rivers.\n\nThe English colonies were then confined to a narrow belt of land along the Atlantic coast, insignificant in size compared to the French possessions.\n\nAs each of these nationalities increased in numbers and extended their settlements, the boundary question between them came up, and increased in importance till the frontier occupation of the questionable territory by the two rival nations brought their interests in collision with each other.\n\nThis rivalry took place on the headwaters of the Ohio river, the first exciting cause of which was the formation of the Ohio Company, under a grant from the English crown. This grant was obtained by Mr. Hanbury, of London, for a tract of country within the present limits of the State of Ohio. The company was composed of eight associates, of whom Lawrence, Augustine and George Washington were three. Measures were taken by the Ohio Company to occupy these lands by commencing to build a fort where Pittsburg now stands, but the men thus employed were driven away by a large force of French and Indians, and this was the beginning of the French and Indian war.\n\n30\n\nThe contest lasted from 1754 to 1759. It involved nearly the whole of Europe in its straggle, for its issue was entangled with the old question as to the balance of power on the continent. The Indian tribes of Canada, and those along the lakes and the Ohio river, as well as the Iroquois of the New York colony and the Delawares of the Susquehanna, were all on the war-path to help settle this question, which was the most momentous one the world had yet seen, as the result has shown.\n\nWolfe's victory on the heights of Abraham, Sept. 13th, 1759, was the last and the decisive battle which settled it. By the fiat of war the boundary line between the French and English possessions in America was established on the Mississippi instead of the Ohio river, and all the territory east of this boundary, as far south as the Spanish possessions of Florida, and the French settlements on the east bank of the Mississippi south of the thirty-first parallel, fell into English hands, according to the definitive treaty of peace which terminated the war. The preliminary treaty, of which the definitive one was the substance, was executed between General Amherst, commander of the English forces, and M. de Vandreuil, French Governor of Canada, bearing date at Montreal, September 8th, 1760. As soon as it was signed the English proceeded to take possession of the immense country acquired by it as fast as it could be done. To do this was a work of no small magnitude, as the sequel proved.\n\nThe entire native population of the country had learned to love the French during generations of harmonious relations with them, and they had fought on their side during the late war. Not an Englishman had then settled northwest of the Ohio river; the Indians held the whole country with a tenacious grip, and had no, even distant fear, that the English would ever be able to dispossess them of it. They were willing to harbor them as traders, but that was all.\n\nOn the 29th of November, 1760, Detroit was taken possession of by the English under Major Robert Rogers. The next\n\n31\n\nsummer Michilimacinac, Ste. Maria, at the outlet of Lake Superior, Green Bay, St. Joseph and Sandusky, were also taken possession of by the English. These were all the places where the French held posts in the conquered country which had not fallen into the hands of the English during the war, except Vincennes and Fort Ouatanon, on the Wabash, and the cluster of French towns in Southern Illinois. Neither of these two latter places, in their distant remoteness from the scenes of the late war, had been even threatened with invasion. But before any steps had been taken to establish English rule over them, the western tribes, under Pontiac, determined to drive the English from the new posts they had already occupied. With this end in view a secret conspiracy was planned by Pontiac and a simultaneous attack made upon each, resulting in the capture of all of them except Detroit and Fort Pitt (Pittsburg). The Indians now reigned triumphant through out the entire northwest, and kept up the siege of Detroit under Pontiac, their great leader, till August 26th, 1763, when the arrival of General Bradstreet with a large force relieved the place and dispersed the red assailants who had closely pressed the garrison for over a year, and reduced them to the verge of starvation.\n\nFort Pitt was also besieged, but not so closely, till General Bouquet relieved the place during the same month. It now only remained to take possession of the French settlements of the Illinois country, and Vincennes on the Wabash, to fulfill the provisions of the treaty at the termination of the French and Indian war.\n\nFour years had elapsed since the date of this preliminary treaty, and the time seemed as distant as ever when the English could venture into the country with safety, especially as an immense domain of forest intervened between it and their settlements along the Atlantic coaSt. The first attempt to do this was to send a force up the Mississippi river, for the lesson taught by the bloody experience of the late war with\n\n32\n\nPontiac had taught General Gage, the British officer now in command of America, a due degree of caution, and he did not deem it practicable to send a force so far into wilds filled with Indians of still doubtful friendship. Accordingly a force of 300 men under Major Loftus was dispatched from Bayou Manchae, an English post on the Gulf of Mexico, to ascend the Mississippi in barges to the French settlements in the Illinois country. \"While laboring against the current on his way, he was suddenly attacked by the Tonica Indians, who poured a volley of shot among his men first from one side of the river and then from the other, and he beat a retreat down stream, abandoning farther attempts to reach the place in question.\n\nThe situation was now complicated in the extreme. Pontiac, though driven from the field, was still a power among the Indian tribes of the interior, with whom the French of Southern Illinois were on the best of terms, through motives of both policy and friendship.\n\nAfter being driven from Detroit, Pontiac had taken refuge at the French villages of the Illinois, over whom the discreet and benevolent St. Ange still exercised an authority both official and paternal. To him Pontiac applied for succor to prolong the fight. It would not do to offend the fallen chieftain, nor would it do to grant his request, and the governor was at his wit's end for a ruse to get out of the dilemma; still he managed, by dint of much circumspection, to preserve the friendship of the importunate representative of Indian interests without allying the French to his hopeless cause.\n\nPending these years of suspense French traders were driving a profitable business in buffalo hides and peltries, for which merchandise they found a ready market at St. Louis and New Orleans. This increased the difficulties of carrying out the provisions of the treaty, for when the English flag should float over the ramparts of Fort Chartres, English merchants would succeed French, and trade would seek an outlet by the way of the lakes instead of down the river. Of so\n\n33\n\nmuch importance was the question of commercial rivalry between the French of New Orleans and the English of Detroit, that Sir William Johnson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, was instructed by the London Board of Trade to take early and effectual measures to secure the trade of the Illinois. He had in his employ at this time an able officer named George Crogan, whose mission had been to act as his deputy at distant points in the wilderness, and to him Sir William assigned the task of going to the place in question to reconcile the inhabitants, both Indian and French, to the English, as a preparatory step towards official occupation. Fort Pitt was the place from which he was to embark on the important but dangerous mission. Here he was detained a month to receive the last installment of captives from the Shawanese, which they had the year before stipulated by treaty to give up, and under an impression that no time should be lost in sending an English deputy to the Illinois, he dispatched an intrepid scout named Frazier, with a few attendants, down the Ohio river, with instructions to proceed immediately to Kaskaskia and inform the authorities there that the agent of Sir William Johnson would soon follow, with power to act for him. Frazier reached the place in due season, and was well received by the inhabitants, but the traders soon got up a conspiracy to kill him, for they well knew that his mission was unfavorable to their interests. To save himself from their murderous hands he sought the protection of Pontiac, and although this chief hated the English with double intensity, nevertheless he was a tenacious stickler for conventional formalities, and would allow no violence done to the Englishman, whom he regarded in the light of an ambassador.\n\nIt was early in May, 1765, that Crogan started down the Ohio river from Fort Pitt. At various places on the way he was detained to execute official business with Indian tribes, and it was the 6th of June when he arrived at the mouth of\n\n34\n\nthe Wabash. No English delegation had ever before penetrated so far into the wilds except Frazier's party, and here he encamped to take time to consider the situation. On the 8th he was attacked by 80 Kickapoo warriors; five of his men were killed and he himself slightly wounded, when he gave up his command as prisoners. This skirmish took place on the soil of Illinois, just below the mouth of the Wabash. Crogan and his band were taken up the Wabash to Vincennes, which was then a French village of eighty houses, near which was a large Piankesha village.By this time the Kickapoos had discovered that their captive was a man not to be trifled with, and they regarded him more in the light of a superior than a prisoner.\n\nHaving been unable to reach his destination, he wished to send a letter to St. Ange, the lawgiver and priest of the Illinois country, and a messenger was promptly at his bidding to carry it. The French furnished him the paper on which to write it, but not till the Indians had given their consent. This done, he was conducted up the river to Ouatanon, at which place he arrived the 23d. Here he was set at liberty, and after holding councils with various tribes of the country, he started on the 18lh of July for the Illinois villages. On the way he met Pontiac at the head of a delegation of Indians. Hitherto this unrelenting warrior had refused all conciliatory meetings with the English, but now for the first time his stubborn resolution gave way, and he consented to confer with Crogan as to peaceful relations, and the whole party returned to Ouatanon for that purpose. After their arrival at the place Pontiac renounced his hostile policy, and promised to use his influence in favor of peace. This, together with the general acquiesence in the English occupation of the country already obtained, was all Crogan could ask, and made it unnecessary for him to visit the Illinois country according to his first intention.\n\n35\n\nHe now started for Detroit, where be again counseled with the Indians, and from thence started for the headquarters of Sir William Johnson on the Mohawk river, to whom he made his report.\n\nIn accordance with the original plan, the military commission which was to follow Crogan embarked from Fort Pitt in the autumn of the same year — 1765. It consisted of about 120 men from the 42d regiment of Highlanders, under Captain Sterling. They arrived at Fort Chartres by way of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers on the 10th of October, and for the first time within the limits of the present State of Illinois the Lilies of France fell from the flagstaff, and the Cross of St. George rose in its place.\n\nThis was the last official act that had despoiled France of her transcendent possessions on the American continent, for already she had, in 1762, ceded New Orleans and her territory west of the Mississippi to Spain.\n\nThe French population of the Illinois villages at this time, together with St. Louis, was about 2,000, added to whom were about 500 slaves.\n\nThe first thing to be done after possession had been taken was to issue the proclamation which General Gage had prepared for the occasion. It guaranteed freedom to the inhabitants in religious matters as well as in their civil rights. But the former was all the Frenchman of that day cared for. He had no ambition to take a hand in the mysteries of government or to make any nice distinction as to any other rights except the right to obey his priest and his magistrate. Such was the early Frenchman of Illinois — law-abiding, simple and happy.\n\nThree months after his arrival Captain Sterling died, and Major Frazier succeeded him as governor. Early in the spring the English troops left the country by the way of the Mississippi river for Pensacola, from whence they sailed for Philadelphia, arriving there the 15th of June.\n\n36\n\nColonel Reed succeeded Frazier as governor, but made himself odious to the inhabitants by an oppressive system of military ruling ill suited to the former subjects of the benevolent St. Ange.\n\nThe next in command was Colonel Wilkins, who arrived in Kaskaskia Sept. 5th, 1768. On the 21st of September following he received orders from General Cage to establish a court of justice. Seven judges were appointed, and the first English court ever convened in Illinois held its sessions at Fort Chartres Dec. 9th, 1768. It is not known how long Colonel Wilkins remained in office, or what English governor succeeded him, but it is known that St. Ange again returned to his loving charge, after having been ruler over St. Louis, which had become a Spanish town in 1762, as already stated.\n\nThe groundwork of the English policy on taking possession of the country was foreshadowed by a proclamation issued by George III., Oct. 24th, 1765, and again by a proclamation in 1772.These proclamations forbade private ownership to the soil, and the inference is plain that he intended to divide the whole country up into baronial estates. Had it been settled by Canadian Frenchmen, such an attempt might have been successful, but the growth of the country stimulated the ambition of its inhabitants into higher and broader channels, and a more general dispensation of nature's gifts in this wealth-producing country than a baronial policy would admit of.\n\nOn the 2d of June, 1774, the British Parliament passed an act entitled \"The Quebec BIll.\" This act extended the limits of Canada so as to include all the territory north of the Ohio river. This was the first official act of Parliament that gave offense to the colonists. It abridged the limits of the Virginia colony, which claimed the territory across the Ohio by virtue of her original charter, and besides this, it disappointed the ambitions of private companies who were at that time contemplating emigration to the valley of the Ohio. Certain acts of\n\n37\n\nLord Dunmore, the last colonial governor of Virginia, gave offense to the border men, who in turn avowed their principles and purposes in ominous language,which clearly foretold the Revolution, even before any action had been taken at Boston or Philadelphia. As before stated, the British soldiers were withdrawn from the Illinois country but few months after their arrival there, and there are no records that any more English soldiers were ever sent to the place, or that any English governor was ever sent to the country after Wilkins' term, and the conclusion seems final that the people here were left to execute their own laws, first under St. Ange, as already told, and next under Rocheblave, who was a Frenchman, though loyal to British interests, as he should be, the country having passed into British hands. The latter — Rocheblave — was in command of the Illinois country just previous to its conquest by Clark, the history of which will be told in the next chapter.\n\n38\n\nChapter IV — Illinois Under American Rule.\n\nThe Continental Congress of thirteen English colonies assembled at Philadelphia September 5th, 1774. It was represented by each colony, and soon afterwards took upon itself the functions of a government of its own creation as a substitute for English authority.\n\nOn the 13th of July, 1775, three Indian departments were instituted — a southern, northern and middle. To the latter the Illinois country was assigned. Benjamin Franklin and James Wilson, of Pennsylvania, and Patrick Henry, of Virginia, were appointed commissioners for the middle department. Its remoteness prevented any practical results from growing out of this organization. Nevertheless it is worthy of record as being the first official action taken by the new government to extend its authority over this distant settlement.\n\nThe next year, 1776, on the 10th of April, Colonel George Morgan, who had been a trader at Kaskaskia, was appointed agent to succeed the former ones of this department. His residence was at Port Pitt, from whence he was required to visit the western tribes for the purpose of cultivating their friendship. But the English agents had already been among them, and not much was accomplished by the Americans through Indian alliances.\n\nMeantime the American Revolution was soon in full tide of progress, and none took more interest in it than the frontier men of Virginia, and none were more willing to make\n\n39\n\nsacrifices to bring it to a successful termination. Prominent among these men was Colonel George Rogers Clark, a native of Albemarle Co., Va. The settlements of Kentucky were then begun, and Clark was among the settlers, but left for Virginia on the 1st of October, 1777, for the purpose of laying a plan before Patrick Henry, the governor, for the conquest of the Illinois country. After several interviews, Governor Henry gave his consent to his plans, and he immediately set about the execution of them.\n\nThe utmost secrecy was necessary, for had it been known in advance the English could have sent a force from Detroit to waylay him on his march to the place, and also to garrison Fort Gage at Kaskaskia with a strong force. As a blind to the real destination of the expedition, Governor Henry first gave Clark instructions to proceed to the Kentucky settlements for the purpose of defending them against Indian attack. These were published, and gave rise to murmurs among the revolutionary spirits of the border that soldiers should be sent on such an errand, when they were needed in front to fight the British.\n\nThe expedition embarked from Pittsburg, and, as Clark expressed it, \"shot the falls\" at Louisville on the 24th of June, kept on down the river to \"a little above Fort Massac,\" and from thence marched across the country to Kaskaskia. The place contained about 1,000 inhabitants, and was defended by a fort named Fort Gage, in honor of the British General Gage.\n\n'Twas on the evening of the 4th of July that Clark arrived at the place. There were no British soldiers there, but a small company of French did garrison at the fort. These, as well as the private citizens, were completely taken by surprise. The presence of Americans in the streets of Kaskaskia, and even in the fort, was the first signal of invasion, and victory was won before resistance was thought of. The governor and a few leading citizens were seized and put in irons, and every inhabitant was ordered to remain in his house on pain of being\n\n40\n\nshot if found in the street. Meanwhile the conquerors made night hideous by their tumult and outcries as they patrolled the streets to prevent the escape of the terrified citizens.\n\nThe Americans had been represented to them as monsters of cruelty, and their demeanor thus far seemed to verify the truth of such an assertion. Clark had already been informed of these slanders against him and his men, and, with a deep and far-seeing mental analysis of the harmless villagers who now lay prostrate at his feet, determined to turn the unjust falsehoods to his own advantage. His plan was first to bring them to the verge of despair, and then, by a sudden transition of clemency, overwhelm them with transports of joy.\n\nPending the painful suspense, M. Gibault, the priest, with a few of the aged citizens, came to the quarters of General Clark and begged that the inhabitants might be permitted to assemble in their church to take their last leave of each other before being separated. Their request was granted them on the ground that the Americans left every man free to settle his religious matters with his God; but no one must leave the town. The injunction was obeyed, and after their meeting was over Gibault and a few others again visited Clark, and, under the expectation that they were all to be driven from their homes, requested that they might be allowed to take a small amount of provisions with them, and a few articles of immediate necessity, and above all, that mothers and children should not be separated. Clark listened to these humble petitions with apparent astonishment, and in reply said, \"Do you take us for savages?\"\n\nHitherto with impenetrable immobility he had presented a harsh exterior towards them, but now the picture was changed, and never did the bright side of human nature through a rough exterior show to better advantage.\n\nThey were not to be driven from their homes or plundered of their property, nor were they to be denied the rites of their religion. He had come among them for a far different\n\n41\n\npurpose. His mission was to introduce the new government in their midst and offer to take them under its protection — a government that France had just allied itself to, which was news to them — it having been sent to Clark after he left Fort Pitt.\n\nThe effect of this unexpected magnanimity was like a sudden recoil from despair to the full fruition of the heart's desire, and the volatile French gave vent to their feelings in transports of joy. The stock of the new government rose above par. Cahokia and all the other adjacent towns promptly yielded to Clark's authority, and young America became firmly planted on the soil of Illinois.\n\nThis was but the initiatory step in the work before the bold adventurer. Five hundred miles of wilderness intervened between him and Fort Pitt, the nearest post from which succor could be obtained in case of a reverse. The English were in force at Detroit, and could easily send a garrison to Vincennes, on the Wabash, a point intervening between him and the frontier from whence he had marched. That ultimate failure in his plans could only be averted by the most heroic policy, coupled with extraordinary activity, was evident to the mind of Clark, and he set himself about the execution of the yet unfinished work before him without loss of time.\n\nHis masterly efforts to win the good will of the French had been successful, and the next work to be done was to win the favor of the Indians, whose power was then transcendent throughout the whole interior.\n\nPending his efforts in this direction Gibault, the priest, volunteered to go to Vincennes with others, among whom was Captain Helm, to advocate the American cause at that poSt. In this he was successful. Those who represented the British interest there gave way to the all-prevailing sentiment in favor of the Americans, and Captain Helm became commandant of the place.\n\n42\n\nSuch was the state of affairs in the autumn of 1778, but on the 15th of December Henry Hamilton, the British governor of Detroit, suddenly appeared before Vincennes with a force of 30 British regulars, 50 French volunteers from among the citizens of Detroit, and 400 Indians. Helm had no force in command to oppose them, and on came the invaders, with Colonel Hamilton at their head, and at his post stood Captain Helm, match in hand, ready to fire a loaded cannon at them. When they had arrived within hailing distance, the tenacious defender of the fort shouted \"Halt!\" This brought a reply from Hamilton demanding a surrender. Helm in turn demanded the honors of war, which terms were granted, and Hamilton took possession of the place, its garrison consisting of Captain Helm and one soldier, named Henry.\n\nThe situation of Clark was now perilous in the extreme, but he took prompt measures to meet the emergency. On the 29th of January succeeding, which was in 1779, there arrived at his quarters from Vincennes Francis Vigo, a Spanish merchant. He had important news for General Clark — Hamilton had weakened his force by sending his Indians to blockade the Ohio river, in order to cut off the retreat of the Americans. \"If I don't take Hamilton, Hamilton will take me\" exclaimed Clark. His resolution was immediately made, and he determined to march against Vincennes. A company of French volunteers was raised, which, added to a company of his own, constituted a force of 170 men. These were to march overland to the place, while a vessel commanded by John Rogers, with 46 men, was sent down the Mississippi and up the Ohio and Wabash, to transport the necessary stores and cooperate with the land forces. The vessel started on the 10th of February, and the land forces the next day, 216 men all told, to wrest from the British empire a country large enough for a kingdom.\n\n43\n\nWhen General Clark arrived at the Wabash, its waters were so swollen by late rains that the country for many miles around was inundated, and after crossing the turbulent river the invaders had to wade in water up to their arm-pits, in places, before camping ground could be reached. This they did under the inspiration of a war song, in which the whole line joined, as they struggled through the flooded valleys like amphibious beings. Having passed these watery wastes, the men encamped for the night on a rise of ground, half famished with hunger and chilled to their vitals with their cold water wadings. Fortunately a small supply of food was soon obtained from some Indian hunters, and the next day the whole force marched against Fort Sackville, which defended the town. The attack was made, and twenty-four hours' firing resulted in wounding many of Hamilton's soldiers, and he surrendered at discretion on the 24th of February.\n\nIn vain may the records of warfare be searched to find so important a conquest achieved by so small a force. The whole plan from the first looked like a desperate one, and had Hamilton not felt an assurance that he could circumvent it, he would not have weakened his own force by sending a detachment to the Ohio to cut off Clark on a retreat that he (Hamilton) felt certain would be attempted by the \"rash adventurer,\" as he regarded him.\n\nClark's success was the result of an accumulation of circumstances, some of which fortuitously grew out of its apparent impossibility in the estimation of his antagonist, as well as out of the hardihood of his men, but, more than either of these, out of his own versatility of talent to turn even obstacles in his path to ultimate advantage. But this conquest, marvelous as it appeared, was only one step towards the final destiny of Illinois, as well as the whole territory north of the Ohio river.\n\nAt the negotiations in Paris in 1783, which arranged the terms of peace after the American Revolution, the most important point to agree on was to establish a western boundary\n\n44\n\nfor the new nation. The provisions of the Quebec bill of 1774 had made the Ohio river the southern line of Canada, and the British tenaciously held to this claim. Meantime the Count de Aranda, the Spanish Commissioner, claimed all the territory west of the Alleghany mountains. At this juncture the American Ministers, Jay, Adams, Franklin and Laurens discovered that the French Commissioner, Count Vergennes, was secretly using his influence in favor of the Spanish claim. This served to complicate the issue still more, and helped to weaken the resolution of the British Commissioner to insist on the rights of England in an issue which might prolong a controversy with her European rivals; for had the signing of the treaty hung on the pleasure of Spain till her consent was obtained to making the Mississippi the western boundary of the United States, it would never have been signed, and it is highly probable that England would not have conceded this point if the Spanish claim had not presented obstacles in the way of her retaining the territory in dispute, even if the Americans should relinquish it. This consideration, in addition to the American rights by virtue of Clark's conquest, settled the destiny of Illinois by placing her under the flag of the United States at the treaty of Paris, signed September 3d, 1783, and ratified by Congress at Philadelphia, January 14th, 1784.\n\nFrom the first the Americans had shown a firm purpose to retain the Illinois country, and, in accordance with this resolution, the General Assembly of Virginia, in October, 1778, made provision for the forms of a temporary government there, and the following year, on the 15th of June, John Todd, a Colonel under Clark, by authority of these provisions, issued a proclamation at Kaskaskia, organizing the country into a county of Virginia, to be called Illinois County, and a fort was built the same year on the east bank of the Mississippi river, just below the mouth of the Ohio, to defend the country from the Spaniards. At that time Spain owned\n\n45\n\nhalf of South America, Central America, Mexico, the West Indies, Florida, and all the territory west of the Mississippi river to the Pacific ocean. She was the European power above all others that represented the intensified forms of feudalism and tyranny, bold, defiant and aggressive in her state councils, and intolerant in civil and religious rights. The fires of despotism were consuming her vitals, and soon burnt out the materials wherewith to sustain her dogged and uncompromising determination to crush the manhood out of her colonial subjects. The consequence was that her power went rapidly into decline when the portions of America over which her laws extended were brought into proximity and rivalry with the progressive spirit of young America, as the sequel proved. To record the history of her attempts to extend her dominion over the Mississippi valley would fill a volume. All of them were abortive, for the reason that her government was behind the age of the progressive civilization that had been growing into maturity under liberal English law in America. This law, when extended over the French settlements, was hailed with welcome, for the reason that it deprived them of no natural right, and most of the inhabitants took the oath of allegiance to the State of Virginia under Todd's administration. He was killed at the battle of Blue Licks, in Kentucky, August 18th, 1782, and was succeeded by Timothy Montbrun, a Frenchman.\n\nFrom this period till the occupation of the country by St. Clair, no official records are extant of its government, and the inference is that during this hiatus no difficulties arose that could not be settled by the prieSt. It was during this interim that the first American settlement in Illinois was made. It was located in the present county of Monroe, and significantly named \"New Design.\" The names of these settlers were James Moore, Shadrack Bond, James Garrison, Robert Kidd, and Larken Rutherford. The two latter were soldiers in General Clark's army. In the summer of 1781 all these,\n\n46\n\nwith their families, had crossed the Alleghany mountains and embarked from Pittsburg on board of what was then called an ark. When the mouth of the Ohio was reached, with many a heavy strain, they urged their ark up the current of the Mississippi to the shore opposite this settlement, debarked, and set the first permanent Anglo-American stakes into the soil of Illinois.\n\nThese men were composed of a more inflexible material than the French. There was no sympathy between them and the Indians, and the consequence was that a hostile feeling ultimately grew up between each which in time made it necessary to build a block-house as a refuge in the event of an outbreak.\n\nBy virtue of her royal charter, as already stated, the claim of Virginia to all the lands north of the Ohio river was acknowledged by common consent, and was valid, perhaps in default of its never having been disputed by a high legal court. But the magnanimity of this venerable old State made any such action unnecessary by ceding the territory in question to the United States, the deed of cession bearing date March 1st, 1784.\n\nThis broad creation of prairie and forest, seamed by a thousand rivers and enriched by countless autumnal leaf-falls and prairie growths, was then, comparatively speaking, an immaculate tablet, unscarred by the plow, and steps were promptly taken by Congress to facilitate its settlement and guarantee to each settler such lands as he selected and paid for. Accordingly on the 20th of May, 1785, an act was passed for the survey of such lands as had been purchased from the Indians. And now began that system of public surveys which may justly be called the best in the world It was begun under charge of Thomas Huchins, the same who mapped out the Ohio country by observation during a tour through it soon after Bouquet's expedition to the Muskingum. These surveys\n\n47\n\nnow form the basis for a description of every farm, and even every village lot, in the entire northweSt.\n\nOn the 5th of October, 1787, Arthur St. Clair, a venerable Revolutionary officer, was appointed governor of the entire country north of the Ohio river, which was designated as the Northwest Territory. On the 9th of July the next year he arrived at Marietta, a settlement recently made at the mouth of the Muskingum river, and set the new machinery of government in motion. The first county was laid out with dimensions large enough to include all the settlements on the river, and named Washington county. About the first of June, 1790, the governor, with the judges of the superior court, descended the Ohio river to Cincinnati, and laid out Hamilton county. A few weeks later he, with Winthrop Sargeant, secretary of the territory, proceeded to Kaskaskia and organized the settled portions of the Illinois country into one county, which, in honor of the governor, was named St. Clair county. All former official organizations here had been by authority of the State of Virginia, and had been transient in their character, but now the permanency of national authority had stamped its seal on Illinois soil. A court was established at Cahokia, and justices of the peace appointed for each of the adjacent villages.\n\nIn 1795 settlements had increased so as to make the organization of another county necessary, and Randolph county was laid out, occupying all the territory south of an east and west line drawn through the New Design settlement from the Mississippi to the Wabash river, St. Clair county occupying the territory north of this line, and Randolph that south of it.\n\nBy an act of Congress May 7th, 1800, the Northwest Territory was divided, the present limits of the State of Indiana, together with those of Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois being set off and named Indiana Territory. On the 13th of the same month William Henry Harrison was appointed governor, and John Gibson, the same to whom Logan made his\n\n48\n\ncelebrated speech, was appointed secretary. The seat of government was fixed at Vincennes, at which place Harrison arrived January 10th, 1801, and immediately organized the new government.\n\nOn the 3d of January, 1805, an election was held by order of Governor Harrison, to elect representatives for the assembly at Vincennes. The legislature met July 29th, 1805. Shadrack Bond and William Biggs, were chosen to represent St. Clair county, and George Fisher, Randolph county.\n\nBy an act of Congress approved January 11th, 1805, Indiana Territory was divided; all that portion of it lying north of a line due east from the southern extremity of Lake Michigan being set off and named Michigan Territory. This only took from the Indiana Territory the portion of Michigan between Lakes Huron and Michigan, that portion of the present State of Michigan bordering on Lake Superior having been annexed to the state since that period, to offset for the loss of territory claimed by Ohio on her southern border. On February 3d, 1809, Indiana Territory was again divided by setting off the territory of Illinois, embracing its present limits, together with the present limits of Wisconsin and the peninsular portion of Michigan. Ninian Edwards was appointed governor, his commission, bearing date April 24th, 1809. Nathaniel Pope was appointed secretary. The seat of government was fixed at Kaskaskia, at which place Governor Edwards assumed his official duties on the 11th of the following June.\n\nThe machinery of the first grade of government was now put in practice. By it the governor and judges constituted the legislature.\n\nBy an act of Congress May 21st, 1812, the territory of Illinois was promoted to the second grade of government. Up to this time every county and town officer had been appointed by the governor; now they were to be elected by the people, but the right of suffrage was extended to those only who had paid a territorial tax.\n\n49\n\nThree new counties, Madison, Gallatin and Johnson, were organized, making five in all, and an election was ordered in each to elect five members of the legislative council, seven representatives, and one delegate to Congress. Shadrack Bond was elected to the latter office, being the first one elected by the people for that position.\n\nThe great earthquake of 1811, the centre of which was at New Madrid, on the Mississippi below the mouth of the Ohio river, was severely felt in Southern Illinois. It began on the night of the 15th of December, and a succession of shocks were felt for several days succeeding. The ground opened at many places in the vicinity of New Madrid and emitted sulphurous steam, closing again with a loud noise, and throwing jets of mud and water high into the air. Near this place much ground was sunk, and became permanently covered with water. The shocks were felt along the entire valley of the Ohio river, and up the Mississippi river they were reported at St. Louis, which was as far as settlements then extended.\n\n50\n\nChapter V — Illinois in the War of 1812.\n\nTo write the history of all the scenes of violence that marked the contest between the Indians and the frontiersmen during the pioneer age of the northwest would fill many volumes, but, happily for Illinois, she has been comparatively exempt from Indian wars as they have raged in Ohio and Indiana, no great Indian battle having ever been fought within her limits, for the reason that the force and power of the Indians was greatly weakened before settlements had progressed to any great extent in this territory.\n\nThe battle of Tippecanoe, fought between the Shawanese and other tribes against the forces of General Harrison, November 7th, 1811, resulted disastrously to the Indians, and doubtless prevented a confederation of the tribes of Illinois from combining against the settlers of this state by any concerted movement. Owing to this cause Indian hostilities here were confined to small skirmishes, personal encounters, or to Indian scouts on pilfering expeditions. In almost all these the Indians got the worst of it, as the exploits of Illinois pioneers have abundantly shown.\n\nAnother reason why the Indians here were less powerful for mischief and less aggressive than those farther east was owing to their greater distance from Canada, at which place their \"British Fathers,\" as they called them, had subsidized all the tribes north of the Ohio into their friendship by an annual distribution of presents at Maiden.\n\n51\n\nThe effect on the minds of the Indians of this prodigal generosity was prodigious, for they in their simplicity believed that disinterested benevolence was the incentive on the part of the givers. In this they were mistaken, for there was a policy in it which in due time came to the surface.\n\nEven after the fires of the Revolution had died away the English left the region of the lakes with reluctance, retaining Detroit, Sandusky and other posts till 1796, contrary to treaty stipulations, giving as a reason that the posts were held to secure the collection of private debts due from citizens of the United States to British subjects. Meantime the persistence of the British of Canada to furnish the Indians with arms and to encourage them to resist the Americans gave great offense to the latter. This state of things lasted from 1789 to 1812, and embittered the minds of the border men against the British to such an extent that, had their counsels ruled in the nation, war would have been declared against England in 1793, when she built a fort at the Maumee rapids, more than twenty miles inside of the Canada line.\n\nPending these accumulating grievances the French Revolution convulsed Europe, and out of its dissolution Napoleon rose into power. Between him and England there was no peace. As years rolled on the war between France and England grew into immense proportions, and the latter did not hesitate to supply her navy with seamen from the decks of American vessels. This latter insult to the nation, added to many others that preceded it, was the cause of the declaration of the war of 1812. It was made the 18th of June. The news rang through the western forests, carried by fleet-footed messengers, and the Indians hovered around the standard of their \"British Father\" in Canada, thinking the time had come when the Americans should be driven from their soil by the aid of English bayonets.\n\nGeneral Hull was promptly sent to Detroit with a force to garrison the place and hold it against the British in Canada.\n\n52\n\nHe had only been there a short time when he found a powerful and wide-spread Indian confederacy arrayed against him, which was the result of the previous years of British patronage and generosity. Their savage retainers held possession of the forest path through which General Hull had marched to Detroit, and closed the door behind him. Meantime the British, by means of their fleet on Lake Erie, could concentrate their forces upon him with facility, and he soon found himself menaced in front by a powerful foe, while his rear bristled with Indian tomahawks and scalping-knives.\n\nFort Dearborn at Chicago, which had been built in 1803-4, was included in the military district under his charge, and during his waning fortunes he determined to send a messenger to the place to give Captain Heald, its commander, timely warning to save the garrison by retreating to Fort Wayne if the place could not hold out until relief could come.\n\nGeneral Hull had in his camp at that time a friendly Pottowatomie chief, named Winnemac, and to him was the mission confided. He was faithful to his trust, and on the 9th of August arrived at Fort Dearborn and handed his dispatch to Captain Heald.\n\nWar had been declared by the United States against England, Michilimacinac had been taken, and Detroit was hard pressed by the British and their red allies. This was the burden of news which the messenger brought to this far-off post in their isolated hermitage. Farther, Captain Heald was ordered to evacuate Fort Dearborn provided he had not means to defend it. Under an impression that he had not he ordered an evacuation, though against the advice of his subordinate officers.\n\nThe 15th of August was set for the day, and the garrison, mustering 66 men, started on their route for Fort Wayne. On arriving at the locality where Eighteenth street now terminates at the lake, they were attacked by five times their number of Pottowatomies. The soldiers in vain charged upon their\n\n53\n\nnumerous foes, with Captain Wells at their head, who had arrived the day before from Fort Wayne to help defend them. Wells was killed, and with him fell more than half of the heroic band of soldiers. The remainder, with Mrs. Helm,the Kinzie family,and some of the wives of the officers, became prisoners, and were subsequently ransomed by Mr. Forsythe, the Indian agent at Peoria, and others.\n\nThis massacre was in the interest of the British in their contest with the Americans, though not done under their orders, but under savage responsibility on British account. This opening of the war was all in favor of the British. The campaign had been short and decisive, but a new one was at hand, destined to offset fourfold for its disgrace.\n\nOn the 24th of September General Harrison received a dispatch from the president that he had been appointed to the command of the northweSt. The first thing for him to do was to take effective measures for the protection of the most remote frontier, after which the British were to be driven from Detroit.\n\nGeneral Shelby, of Kentucky, entered heartily into the work, and had raised an army of volunteers and placed them under command of General Hopkins, who was at Vincennes late in September awaiting orders, and while General Harrison was approaching Detroit, his forces were destined for the Illinois service, to destroy the Kickapoo villages along the Illinois river.\n\nOn the 11th of October two companies of United States Rangers, under command of Colonel Russell, were ordered to march immediately to Edwardsville, Illinois, where they were\n\n54\n\nto be placed under command of Governor Edwards to be added to his forces. Thus united, the army was to march against the Indian towns on the Illinois river, in which vicinity it was to form a junction with the army of General Hopkins. The latter started from Vincennes early in October, crossed the Wabash at Fort Harrison, and began its march into the broad prairies of the interior toward the objective point. They were composed mostly of raw recruits who had never seen service, and the country they had entered seemed strange and bewildering in its vastness. The prairie fires lit up the sky each night with lurid glares and wrought upon their fears, and at the end of the fourth day's march the whole army refused to obey orders. Accordingly the next morning the volunteers turned backward and retraced their steps by the way they had advanced, despite the orders of their General.\n\nWhile these unsoldier-like men were retreating before they had come in sight of the enemy, Governor Edwards' army were advancing according to the original plan, and arriving at an Indian town on the east bank of Peoria Lake, found it deserted except by a single Indian and a squaw. The luckless brave was shot at the first sight of him, and the squaw, after many shots having been fired at her under the impression that she was a brave, was taken captive. She was not wounded, but gave vent to her feelings in a flood of tears, and was soon set at liberty. The country had never before been penetrated by Americans, and the number of Indians it contained was not known. No tidings of General Hopkins were received, and it was deemed expedient to retreat, lest superior numbers might be brought against them. The governor therefore returned to Camp Russell and discharged the volunteers.\n\nPeoria at this time contained a mixed population of French and Indians, and the former were accused by the Americans of befriending the Indians and supplying them with ammunition. Under this apprehension a gunboat expedition under Captain Craig was to act in conjunction with the land forces of Governor\n\n55\n\nEdwards, and General Hopkins, to supply the two armies with provisions and the necessary stores for the campaign. This failed to make a connection with the army of the governor, but advanced to Peoria, burnt the town, and taking most of the French inhabitants prisoners, transported them down the Illinois river to the banks of the Mississippi, and turned them loose on its desolate banks without food. After much suffering the outcasts found their way back to their homes, which, though laid in ashes, were rebuilt, and Peoria continued to be a French trading post till American settlers came to the place. The writer has no data at hand to show the grounds of suspicion of French alliance with the Indians, or the kind of aid furnished them by which the Americans felt aggrieved, and by which they justified their attack upon the town and abduction of its French citizens. Whatever these grounds were, it is certain that no subsequent attack was made on the place, by which an inference may be made that the first one was unnecessary.\n\nThe next year, 1813, another expedition was set on foot from Camp Russell. It crossed the Illinois two miles above its mouth, thence went to the Mississippi, and marched up its east bank to the lower rapids, from whence it went across the country to the Illinois river, and arriving at Peoria, built a fort, which, in honor of General George Rogers Clark, was called Fort Clark. The expedition then advanced up the river to Gomas village, destroyed it, and returned to Camp Russell. This closed the campaign of 1813 in Illinois, and it must be confessed that it was by a very tenacious and farfetched resolution to defend the state that the war had been waged against the Indians, and especially against the French of Peoria.\n\nThe campaign of 1814 opened with increased activity along the frontiers of Illinois, for now an actual enemy was at their gates. Notwithstanding the British had been driven from Detroit and signally defeated both on sea and land by the\n\n56\n\nforces of General Harrison and Commodore Perry, Michilimacinac and Prairie du Chien were still in their possession, and against the latter an expedition was planned. It started from St. Louis about the 1st of May in four barges, on board of which were 200 men under charge of Governor Clark, of Missouri. They arrived at the place and took possession without resistance, almost the entire British force, under the celebrated Colonel Dickson, having left for Canada to recruit the British army there, who were being hard pressed by the Americans.\n\nThe following July a large force of British and Indians returned and laid siege to the place. It was taken after a stout resistance, and the garrison were sent to St. Louis as paroled prisoners.\n\nThe following August an expedition was fitted out at Cape au Gris, destined for the upper Mississippi, under command of General Z. Taylor, the same who afterwards became President of the United States.\n\nIt started on the 24th of August, in armed barges, with 334 men. A little above Rock Island they were attacked by a superior force of British and Indians under the command of the celebrated Black Hawk,and defeated after a desperate battle.\n\nThis terminated the war in Illinois and Wisconsin, as the negotiations of Ghent soon followed, articles of peace being signed December 24th, 1814, and the British forces withdrew from the beautiful lake country to its northern shore, and the Indians once more settled into peace.\n\n57\n\nChapter VI — Administrations of the Governors of Illinois.\n\nIn January, 1818, the territorial legislature sent a petition to Congress for admission into the Union as an independent state. Nathaniel Pope was then delegate, and through his instrumentality the petition was not only granted, but the bill was so amended as to extend the northern limits of the state from its proposed boundary to latitude 42° 30'. Its first limit was a line drawn due west from the southern extremity of Lake Michigan to the Mississippi river. The amended bill became a law April 18th, but the act for admission of the state into the Union was not passed till December 30th, 1818.\n\nIn July, 1818, a convention was called at Kaskaskia to draft a constitution, of which Jesse B. Thomas was president and William C. Greenup secretary. The following are the names of the counties then in existence, all of which were represented in the convention: Randolph, Madison, Gallatin, Johnson, Pope, Jackson, Crawford, Bond, Union, Washington and Franklin.\n\nThis constitution was not submitted to a vote of the people for ratification. By its provisions judges, prosecuting attorneys, county and circuit judges, recorders and justices of the peace, were all appointed by the governor or legislature, instead of being elected by the people. The first election under it for governor was held in September, 1818, which resulted in the election of Shadrack Bond, and Pierre Menard was\n\n58\n\nelected lieutenant governor. They were inaugurated October 6th.\n\nIn 1820 the seat of government was removed to Vandalia. Among its earliest labors was the creation of the Illinois state bank, with a capital of half a million dollars, based on the credit of the state.\n\nIn August, 1822, Edward Coles was elected governor by a small plurality over his principal opponent, Joseph Phillips, there being two other candidates in the field. Adolphus F. Hubbard was elected lieutenant governor. The inauguration took place December 5th. In this election the final contest was involved between those who wished to make Illinois a slave state and those who wished to make it a free state, and on this issue the people were not very unequally divided.\n\nSlavery had existed here ever since 1720, at which time Philip Francis Penault, as agent for the company of St. Phillips, introduced it. The company of which he was agent was an offshoot of that established by the celebrated John Law in 1717. By the distempered imaginations of those interested in the Law company, the whole country was looked upon as a mining field for precious metals, and to work the mines 500 slaves were purchased in St. Domingo and transported to the Illinois country. After this theory had been dispelled, a part of them were employed in working the lead mines of Missouri and Dubuque, while a portion of them were purchased by the French settlers, and the offspring of the latter became the slave population of Illinois down to the time of Governor Coles' election. By the ordinance of 1787 slavery had been prohibited in the entire territory of the northwest, of which Illinois was a part, and it existed here only by means of various legal subterfuges by which the provisions of the ordinance had been averted.\n\nGovernor Coles was an able and uncompromising advocate of Freedom, and it was evident to those representing the other side that unless a new constitution which fully recognized\n\n59\n\nslavery as the future policy of the state could be obtained, that this institution must ultimately die out. Accordingly measures were taken by the slavery party to obtain it. To this end it was necessary by law to get a two-thirds vote of the general assembly in favor of calling an election of the people to vote on the question of changing the constitution. This was obtained by dint of aggressive and defiant means best known to those who have been drilled in a school of partisan politics, and now the slavery party were confident of success. The election was proclaimed, but eighteen months intervened before it was to be held, and it is probable that no state election was ever held since the United States became a nation in which so much determination of purpose was thrown into the arena. The cause of Freedom triumphed, 6,640 votes being polled against a convention to change the constitution against 4,972 in favor of it.\n\nThis was the Waterloo of the slavery advocates in Illinois, and to Governor Coles more than to any other man is due the credit of the victory.\n\nIn the spring of 1825, by invitation of Governor Coles, General La Fayette, who was then in America, visited Illinois. The governor had previously made the acquaintance of La Fayette in Paris, and the meeting of these distinguished statesmen in this distant frontier, as Illinois then was, made the fires of freedom burn anew, and was a season of rejoicing to the French as well as the Americans.\n\nIn the autumn election of 1826 Ninian Edwards was elected governor and Wm. Kinney lieutenant governor of Illinois, and were inaugurated December 6th. No exciting questions came up under his administration, and the governor turned his attention to improving the finances of the state. In this he was successful, the annual expenses of the state being $20,000, and the revenue $35,000 — small sums compared to its present outgoes and incomes.\n\n60\n\nIn August, 1830, John Reynolds was elected governor and Zadoc Casey lieutenant governor, and were inaugurated December 9th. The great event of his administration was the Sauk war. The Sauks and Foxes then occupied the territory intervening between the Rock and Mississippi rivers. By a treaty held in St. Louis November 3d, 1804, this tribe had ceded nearly all the lands they held in Illinois and Wisconsin to the United States, General Harrison representing the United States, and five chiefs representing the Sauk and Fox and Winnebago nations in the treaty. By its provisions the Indians were to retain their lands till they were wanted for settlements. During the war of 1812 with England, through the influence of Colonel Dickson, a British officer at Prairie du Chien, a part of this tribe had allied themselves to the British, and these were called \"The British Band.\" Black Hawk was their acknowledged leader, while Keokuk, the principal chief of the tribe, was opposed to the policy of resistance to the United States. Black Hawk's village was on the tongue of land at the mouth of the Rock river, between it and the Mississippi.\n\nAfter the peace at the close of the war of 1812, amicable relations existed with the Indians till July 15th, 1830, at which time Keokuk made a final cession at Prairie du Chien to the United States of all the land his tribe held east of the Misssisippi river.\n\nThis was done without the knowledge of Black Hawk, and when this tenacious old veteran learned the news his indignation was aroused, for he had always been opposed to yielding territory to the whites. By its stipulations Black Hawk and his band were to leave their village the next year and occupy land west of the Mississippi. Keokuk used his influence to persuade the whole tribe to do it, while Black Hawk took the other side. Keokuk with his band crossed the river, but Black Hawk, instead of quietly submitting, scoured the country from Canada to the Mississippi to secure aid to his cause. He declar"
