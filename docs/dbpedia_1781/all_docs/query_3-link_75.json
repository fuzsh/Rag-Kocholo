        "text": "Governor of Plaisance, 1702-1706\n\nDaniel d'Auger de Subercase was born in the early 1660s in the commune of Orthez, in the province of Béarn, France and was baptised a Protestant. He served about 10 years in the land forces and acted as captain in the regiment of Brittany in 1684. He joined the navy and sailed for Québec in 1687. While there, he was named lieutenant-commander, garrison adjutant and adjutant general. This experience would help mark Subercase's regime at Plaisance (Placentia) as arguably the most dynamic and progressive the colony had ever seen, and this despite the short duration of his stay.\n\nSubercase succeeded Monic as governor of Plaisance on April 1, 1702, although he did not arrive until the summer of 1703. The fort had deteriorated during Monic's regime and the soldiers were in desperate need of arms and suitable housing. Exploitation of the resident fishermen was common as well.\n\nTo improve conditions, Subercase rigourously monitored the colony's social and religious life while developing its economy and agriculture. He also decided that the colony's defence problems needed to be addressed. He led a raid on Ferryland in 1703 and took prisoners from whom he learned of an imminent attack on Plaisance. Discovering from a St. Malo boat that Subercase was prepared for the assault, the English abandoned their plans. Spared the attack, Subercase and the settlers spent the winter fortifying the colony and building a dike.\n\nSubercase assembled a group of raiders composed of Mi'Kmaq and Canadians from Québec to help in the campaigns against British settlements. They captured Bay Bulls and Petty Harbour in January 1705 and then marched on St. John's. They captured and burned the town, but were unable to capture the fort. After attacking for over a month Subercase ran out of ammunition and was forced to return to Plaisance. Other parties sent out by Subercase succeeded in destroying settlements in Conception Bay and Trinity Bay and in capturing many English settlers.\n\nAs governor, Subercase was able to restore the morale of the garrison and inhabitants, and to diversify the economy by growing cereals and vegetables and raising livestock. Following the death of Brouillan, Subercase became the governor of Acadia in April 1706.\n\nSubercase surrendered Port-Royal to the British in 1710, and little is known about his subsequent life, other than that he returned to France and died in November 1732.\n\nVersion française"
