        "text": "Mr. Blaine to Messrs. Kasson, Phelps, and Bates.\n\nGentlemen: In giving you instructions as to your conduct in the conference at Berlin, for which you have been appointed commissioners, it will be impossible to anticipate all the questions which may arise in the course of its deliberations. My object now is to impress upon you the general principles which will govern the opinions and control the decisions of the Government of the United States, and which will enable you to judge how far any special conclusions will commend themselves to your Government, and within what limits it will be proper to confine yourselves.\n\nAs you will communicate promptly and specifically the protocols of the proceedings, fuller and more specific instructions will, from time to time, be sent you. You will carefully examine the protocols of the first conference and the report of the special commissioner to Samoa which are inclosed, and you will find in them a clear statement of the position occupied upon this whole subject by the administration to whose hands the former negotiations were intrusted.\n\nIn the discharge of your duties you will be governed by the most earnest assurance that the Government of the United States desires a speedy and amicable solution of all the questions involved, and that while it will steadily maintain its full equality of right and consideration in any disposition of those questions, it is as much influenced by an anxious desire to secure to the people of Samoa the conditions of a healthy, prosperous, and civilized life as it is bound by its duty to protect the rights and interests of its own citizens wherever their spirit of lawful enterprise may carry them. In the co-operation of the United States, of Germany, and of Great Britain in this attempt to establish a beneficial and stable government in these islands, the President hopes and believes that while a frank and friendly consultation will strengthen their respect for each other, the result will prove that it is not the wish of any of them to subordinate the rights of this amiable and dependent people to the exigencies of a grasping commerce, or to the political ambition of territorial extension on the part of any one of the treaty powers.\n\n[Page 196]\n\nIn consenting, at the request of His Imperial Majesty, to re-open the adjourned proceedings of the conference of 1887 at Berlin instead of Washington, the President is anxious to manifest his entire confidence in the motives and purposes of the German Government. But it must be borne in mind that it is an adjourned conference, in continuation of the conference at Washington of 1887, and not the initiation of a new-one on another basis; for at that time there were existing conditions directly influencing its deliberations which the Government of the United States can not admit to have been changed by any subsequent occurrences in the South Pacific.\n\nMr. Bayard, my predecessor, wrote thus to Count Arco on February 5, 1889:\n\nIn attempting to define the scope and purpose of the present conference it is fortunately unnecessary to enter minutely into the history of the Samoan difficulties in the past. It may be proper, however, to advert to the fact that peace and order were promoted in Samoa by the municipality convention of 1879, and by the treaty of peace of July, 1881, celebrated on board of the United States steamer Lackawanna between the warring Samoan chiefs in the presence of Commander Gillis and the consuls of the three treaty powers. By virtue of these conventions a neutral territory was established in and about Apia, and a government provided therefor. From the information before the Department, I have no reason to doubt the correctness of the statements made by Mr. Bates, the special agent of the United States, that—\n\nNor is it deemed necessary at present to enter upon detailed examinations of the transactions of 1885, for the obvious reason that so far as individual injury may have ensued it can be more profitably reserved for future discussion, while so far as questions of public right or interest may be involved both the Government of his Imperial Majesty and the Government of the United States have taken very positive and similar positions. Both governments have disavowed the irregular action of their consuls.\n\n[Page 197]\n\nOn January 16, 1886, Count Bismarck made the following statement to Mr. Pendleton, United States minister at Berlin:\n\nOn June 1, 1886, Mr. Bayard cabled Mr. Pendleton as follows:\n\nFollowing this exchange of opinion, the three treaty powers agreed to send special commissioners to Samoa to examine and to report upon the actual condition of affairs in the islands. These commissioners made full and elaborate reports to their respective Governments, and in June, 1887, by formal agreement, a conference of these powers was opened at Washington, represented respectively by the Secretary of State of the United States, the minister of Germany, and the minister of Great Britain.\n\nAfter a very full and able discussion of the business before it, in the course of which some points of agreement were reached and certain points of difference developed, the conference, on July 26, 1887, adjourned, in order, as stated in the proposition of adjournment, that further instructions should at once be obtained by the representatives of the treaty powers from their respective Governments, with a view to the re-assembling of the conference in the ensuing autumn.\n\nBy an agreement between the treaty powers, this conference is now to be resumed, the place of its meeting, however, having been, at the request of the German Government, transferred to Berlin.\n\nIt would be a source of great satisfaction to the President if the only duty incumbent on him now were to review the proceedings of the first conference, and, with proper regard to the views of Germany and Great Britain, reach such modified conclusions as would be entirely satisfactory to the honor and interests of all the treaty powers, and at the same time secure for the Samoan people a stable and orderly Government. He firmly believes that such a result is possible, but since the adjournment of the conference certain events have occurred which require explanation.\n\nWithin a very short period, less indeed than a month from the adjournment of the conference, without previous intimation of any such serious complication, the Government of his His Imperial Majesty notified the Government of the United States that Germany had declared “war” against “Malietoa, personally.” In the course of this hostile proceeding he was taken on board of a German man-of-war and deported to various places, and is now reported to be in the Marshall Islands, in the custody of German officials. While the President is unwilling to consider this action as intentionally derogatory either to the dignity or the interests of the other treaty powers, yet he can not but consider it, under all the circumstances, as an abrupt breach of the [Page 198] joint relations of the treaty powers to each other and to the Government of Samoa. He finds it impossible to reconcile such action with this frank and friendly language of the German Government preliminary to the meeting of the conference:\n\nThe President is painfully apprehensive that the forcible removal of Malietoa, who, so far as the information in his possession goes, is without doubt the preferred sovereign of the Samoan people, and the failure to restore that condition under which only, it seems to him, a free choice could be made by the Samoans, will not only seriously complicate, but may possibly endanger that prompt and friendly solution which all the treaty powers so earnestly desire, and which is vital to the safety and prosperity of Samoa itself.\n\nThe President hopes that these opinions will receive the consideration to which he thinks them entitled. You will submit them to the conference with temperate firmness, If it be urged, as it may be, that this forcible intervention has had consequences which practical good sense can not disregard, because they can not be undone, you will say that the restoration of the status quo is necessary to place the treaty powers upon their footing of equality, and does not prevent the treaty powers and Samoa from making any changes in the future which justice and an unselfish interest may suggest as necessary. The desire of the Government of the United States to see the status quo re-established as the basis for future deliberation and action in no way commits it to the partisan support of any plan or any person.\n\nYou will not submit this proposition as an ultimatum which would close the conference or prevent the President from considering any plan which may be suggested as a substitute. But should the proposition be rejected, you will not accept such conclusion except ad referendum. You will communicate such result as promptly as possible, and the President will then decide upon the course which he deems it his duty to adopt, and you will be instructed accordingly.\n\nShould the representatives of Germany and Great Britain deem it wiser to postpone the decision of this question until further conference shall have ascertained the probability of agreement upon a final solution of the Samoan question, you are authorized to proceed with such discussion, although the President would much prefer its preliminary settlement.\n\nUpon the acquiescence of the conference in the proposition of the President to restore the status quo, or upon its postponement to the determination of the discussion of the general question, it becomes necessary to instruct you as to the views and wishes of the President upon the conclusions reached and the differences developed in the deliberation of the first conference. The principles and the purposes of that conference have been stated with great clearness by the commissioners of the three treaty powers which composed it.\n\nMr. Bayard, on behalf of the United States, said:\n\nAssuming for the present that this co-operative action was in harmony with the interests and policy of the United States, and that the two principles—the independence of the native Samoan Government and a perfect equality of commercial rights and privileges between the three treaty powers—were sound and sufficient basis for such co-operative action, it is disappointing to find that all the plans and all the discussion by which it was sought to give practical effect to this co-operative action ended in what appears to the President to be an irreconcilable difference.\n\nAvoiding a too minute review of these discussions, which will be found fully set forth in the protocols and which I am glad to recognize were conducted with admirable temper and great force and frankness on all sides, their differences may be summarized in a brief statement of the two plans, one of which was submitted by the German Government, supported by the Government of Great Britain, and the other prepared by the Secretary of State of the United States.\n\nThe German proposition, after providing for a new election of king of Samoa, declares, Article III:\n\nAnd this article is to be interpreted in connection with the following declaration of the German minister:\n\n[Page 200]\n\nSupported by the declaration of the minister of Great Britain:\n\nIt is unnecessary here to repeat the objections to this plan which were made by the representative of the United States in the conference with great acuteness and force, and which have the entire approval of the President. It is sufficient in this instruction to say that the President can not accept this plan as satisfactory. In constituting a foreign “adviser” with unlimited or at least unrestrained power, both of legislation and administration, the President finds it difficult to see the friendly desire to maintain a native and independent Samoan Government which all the treaty powers have so earnestly expressed. Giving to Germany the right to nominate such “mandatary” for the first five years, especially when that priority is claimed in virtue of its supremacy in population, in property, and in commerce, would be simply encouraging that power to maintain and extend such supremacy, and to make it the basis for a perpetual re-appointment and ultimately of absolute possession.\n\nThe President is altogether unable to see how the appointment of this “mandatary” by one of the powers, upon the avowed ground of its supposed greater interests, can either preserve that absolute equality of consideration which would alone justify the co-operation of the treaty powers, or could protect with adequate security the commercial interests of the separate powers, which are, in tact, the motive and the purpose of any co-operation. In the exercise of such great power as is given to the “mandatary” the superiority of German power and interest would naturally direct his influence, first, to the preservation, and then to the extension of his supremacy. And in any dissent or remonstrance on the part of the other powers, they would be brought into direct controversy, not with the friendly native authority, but with what would really be the German Government, speaking in the name of the King of Samoa. It would be far simpler, and conduce more to final and well-understood relations, to recognize this assumed superiority as real, and to hold direct communication with Germany in our transactions with what would be practically her colonial possession.\n\nThe obligation of the Government of the United States in the South Pacific is to protect the rights and interests of our citizens who maybe residents there and engaged in any lawful pursuit. We have no desire to dominate, and every wish to develop a stable and just government. If there have been trouble and annoyances, they have not proceeded from any groundless hostility of the Samoan Government or the Samoan people. They have arisen and been fostered into mischievous activity by the avarice and eagerness of competing merchants and land speculators, and the irregular conduct of foreign officials who are, perhaps naturally and excusably but most injudiciously, sympathetic with the prejudices and interests of their immediate constituents, the resident foreigners. To convert the assumed supremacy of any one of these contesting interests into a legalized government of these islands does not, in the opinion of the President, promise any relief from the embarrassing dissensions which at present disturb the orderly condition of things.\n\n[Page 201]\n\nBut there are other reasons why the Government of the United States can not accept this scheme of subordination. The interests of the United States require the possession of a naval station in these remote parts of the Pacific, and by a treaty with the lawful authorities of Samoa they have been put in control of the harbor of Pago Pago for these purposes. We cannot consent to the institution of any form of government in Samoa subject directly or indirectly to influences which in the contingencies of the future might check or control the use or the development of this American right. Nor can the Government of the United States forget, what we are satisfied the other treaty powers will cordially recognize, that our interest on the Pacific is steadily increasing; that our commerce with the East is developing largely and rapidly 5 and that the certainty of an early opening of an Isthmian transit from the Atlantic to the Pacific (under American protection) must create changes in which no power can be more directly interested than the United States. And in any question involving present or future relations in the Pacific, this Government can not accept even temporary subordination, and must regard it as inconsistent with that international consideration and dignity to which the United States, by continental position and expanding interests, must always be entitled.\n\nIt only remains to consider the proposition as formulated by the representatives of the United States Government. Stated briefly, it is, as far as possible, the preservation of the native government which has hitherto existed with the addition to the king and vice-king of an executive council, consisting of three secretaries, who, with the king and vice-king will form the executive government; these three secretaries to be appointed by the king on the recommendation of each of the three treaty powers. Although foreigners, these secretaries are to be officers of the Samoan Government and paid by that Government. The consuls of the treaty powers are still to retain their ex-territorial jurisdiction as the citizens and subjects of their respective Governments.\n\nThis scheme itself goes beyond the principle upon which the President desires to see our relations with the Samoan Government based, and is not in harmony with the established policy of this Government. For if it is not a joint protectorate, to which there are such grave and obvious objections, it is hardly less than that and does not in any event promise efficient action.\n\nIt would seem that if the existing troubles were the result, not of any action of the Samoan Government, but of the rivalries and misunderstandings of foreign consuls and residents, the presence in the government of three officers representing the same differing nationalities and interests would only transfer the scene of dispute to the executive council, and that these three secretaries, being officers of the Samoan government, would not be less partisan, but would be only further removed from the control of the treaty powers than are the consuls whom it is now found so difficult to keep within their strict line of duty. It is evident, moreover, that the different views which the representatives of colonial powers like Great Britain and Germany and a representative of the United States would hold towards the natives and a native government, scarcely promises as a result the harmonious co-operation of the varied and variant interests.\n\nAt the same time, while holding different views, the President can not deny the serious impression which has been made upon him by the consenting opinions of the German and English ministers, and the strong support given to that opinion by the very able reports of all the special [Page 202] agents sent to Samoa to examine into its present condition. Mr. Bates, the special agent of the United States, says:\n\nUnder these circumstances, and in view of the opinions of those best qualified to judge, the Government of the United States can not refuse to give weighty consideration to whatever plan the conference may suggest. While, therefore, as already intimated, I can not undertake to instruct you on such details as may become the subject of discussion, you will bear in mind, throughout the whole deliberation:\n\n(1)\n\nThat, if it shall become absolutely necessary in the present complication that the three treaty powers should administer the government of Samoa, it is the earnest desire of the President that this intervention should be temporary: that it should be confined within those limits in which such action is necessary to conciliate and compose present difficulties, and that it shall be avowedly preparatory to the restoration of as complete independence and autonomy as is possible in the islands.\n\n(2)\n\nThat the intervention of the three treaty powers must be on terms of absolute equality, and the nearest approach to that normal condition of things in which the consular officers of the Government can be the most efficient intermediaries between the treaty powers and the native government, will be the most acceptable.\n\n(3)\n\nIn any arrangement for the establishment of order and civilization in Samoa, the President is of opinion that too much importance can not be given to the subject of the adjustment of claims and titles to land. The claims of foreigners to land titles in the islands amounted three years ago to more than the whole area of the group. Many of these claims are conflicting and, as the correspondence of the last three years discloses, they are continually giving rise to disputes. It is believed that upon investigation many of the alleged titles would prove to be groundless. It is unnecessary to emphasize the importance, both to foreigners and to natives, of a final settlement of these questions. To the former it would give security and confidence in their efforts to promote agriculture and to add to the wealth and commerce of the country. To the natives it would bring the twofold advantage of being rescued from that deplorable condition in which, being unjustly excluded from their lands, they must, to employ the significant phrase of the British Commissioner in 1886, either pilfer or die;” and of being protected from those acts of interference and oppression to which the cupidity of foreigners has heretofore exposed them. It is believed that the disturbance of the “Lackawanna Peace,” as well as many other unfortunate facts in the recent history of Samoa, may chiefly be attributed to the encouragement and fomentation, by interested foreigners, of dissentions and strife among the natives, with a view to take advantage of the disorder so created to obtain possession of their lands. It is desirable that the ownership of all the lands in the islands should be ascertained and registered; that rules for the transfer of title should be established, and safeguards devised against transfers for improper or insufficient considerations; and that, if necessary, a composition should be effected whereby a reasonable proportion of the territory may be [Page 203] saved to the natives. It is believed that the settlement of the land question on this equitable and comprehensive basis would give the best possible assurance for the stability and success of any government that may be established, simply by removing the principal incentive to its disturbance.\n\n(4)\n\nThe consideration of the subject of land claims naturally suggests that of the prohibition or regulation of the importation and sale of firearms and alcoholic liquors. Many of these claims have, without doubt, been obtained by ministering to the weaknesses and passions of the natives by furnishing them with the articles above mentioned. It is thought that this reproach to civilization should be removed by each of the treaty powers adopting stringent regulations on the subject.\n\nIt is not anticipated that any proposition will be submitted to the conference either by Germany or by Great Britain referring to any other subject than the one covered by this instruction. Should any attempt of the kind be made, you will courteously, but firmly decline all discussion.\n\nI do not desire to embarrass your discussion of the restoration of the status quo by reference to the incidents which accompanied the declaration of martial law by the German authorities. But these incidents can not be passed over in silence, if such silence is to be interpreted as acquiesence either in the rightfulness or the necessity of that measure. Such a declaration appears to the President to have been in direct violation of that equal and friendly co-operation which had been previously recognized as the principle of action for the treaty powers, and equally contradictory of the conditions upon which the conference was instituted. But, aside from these considerations, the manner and the method by which the German naval authorities proclaimed their intention of carrying this declaration into effect, could only tend to evoke irritation and bitterness over questions which might well be the subject of grave international discussion. So trenchant were the invasions of the rights of American citizens in Samoa, and so apparent was the purpose to disregard the dignity of the flag which protected them, that, if immediate resentment of such treatment had culminated in forcible resistance, this Government, while deeply regretting so unfortunate an occurrence, would have found it impossible not to sympathize with the natural indignation which prompted such a course.\n\nTo subject the citizens of the United States to the police inspection of the German navy; to require reports from each household as to arms kept for its necessary protection; to make permission from the German authorities a needed prerequisite to the natural right of American citizens to guard themselves from danger; to inquire into the character of even their rumored conversations, and hold them amenable therefor to the summary proceedings of a German court-martial—all these were trials and indignities to which they ought never to have been subjected, and to which, I trust, the results of this conference will make it certain they shall never be subjected again.\n\nHad not the Government of the United States believed that these objectionable proceedings were due to the hasty and too pronounced zeal of German naval officers, and not to the orders or the wishes of the authorities at Berlin, an earnest and vigorous protest would have been made against the assumption of such power. In this belief, the President is content to overlook the offense, and refers to it now lest silence on his part should be misconstrued by the German Government. You will, therefore, be careful, in any reference which you may make to the [Page 204] subject, to employ a friendly tone, and to assume that the proceedings referred to were at no time authorized by the Imperial Government.\n\nAny conclusion you may reach will be referred immediately to this Department, and you will be further instructed, from time to time, as your reports indicate more specifically the plan which meets the approbation of the conference.\n\nI am, etc.,\n\n[Inclosure 1.]\n\nProtocols of the Conference held at Washington in 1887.\n\nConfidential.]\n\nPROTOCOL OF FIRST SAMOAN CONFERENCE.\n\nThe conference was formally opened by Mr. Bayard inquiring whether the British and German ministers had received his note inclosing a draught of apian for the settlement of Samoan affairs, and whether they had prepared any comments upon it. Both had received it.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben then stated that he had made a memorandum, which he would read, but could not give out of his hand. His Government had sent him general instructions before knowing Mr. Bayard’s suggestions, and those instructions, therefore, did not cover all the different points suggested. He was, however, willing that the views of his Government should be put down in the protocol of the conference as he read them.\n\nMr. Bayard said the conference was suggested a year ago; that the three Governments had sent out commissioners to make investigation and report; that reports had been made and exchanged; that an expression of the views of the United States had been desired; that an informal conference had been held, which ended in the request by the ministers of Great Britain and Germany that those views should be reduced to writing; that this had been done, and the plan placed in their hands, and that it seemed proper that the views of the other two Governments should be handed to him in the same way.\n\nThis, however, Mr. von Alvensleben declined to do, and for this reason Sir Lionel West decided not to give a copy of the memorandum which he had prepared; but they agreed that their statements, as read by them, should be taken down by a stenographer and embodied in the protocol of the conference.\n\nThe plan previously submitted by Mr. Bayard on the part of the United States, and which is to be taken as if read at the conference, is as follows:\n\nplan for the establishment of peace and civilization in samoa under the co-operative support of the governments of the united states, germany, and great britain.\n\n“(1) The independence and autonomy of the kingdom composed of these islands are to be preserved free from the control or preponderating influence of any foreign Government, and it was in pursuance of this understanding that commissioners were recently sent by the three powers respectively to investigate and report upon the condition of the islands, and that the respective consuls of the three powers at the islands were changed.\n\n“(2) It is the desire of the United States, and equally of Germany and Great Britain, to assist the natives of Samoa to form and administer their Government.\n\n“(3) The due and orderly commencement of the new government will be the recognition of a native king; and a respect for native customs and traditions, which the three powers have recognized by their several existing treaties, would seem to require the continuance of Malietoa Laupepa as King, and of Tamasese as Vice-King. The kingship of the islands has for many years been filled by the election of the head of Malietoa family, of Malietoa Talavoa, until his death in 1880, and of Malietoa Laupepa in March 1881, in which same year Tamasese was elected Vice-King. These voluntary native elections and the governments so established were severally recognized by the United States, Germany, and Great Britain, and the treaties now existing between these powers and Samoa should have all the binding force attendant upon such formal obligations.\n\n“(4) A written constitution of government should be adopted and on the following lines: An election by the native inhabitants should be held at once for chiefs from several districts of Samoa, who are to be the council of the King. The number of these chiefs may be as follows: From Aana, 2; from Atua, 2; from Apolima and Manono, 1; from Savaii, 6; from Taumasaga, 2; from Tutuila, Mauna, Olosega, Ofa, and Aunuu, 2. By the King and these chiefs the constitution should be adopted and proclaimed. This constitution should provide for alegislature, which should, as heretofore, consist of a King’s Council or Timua, and a legislative assembly or Faipule. The former should consist of the King, the Vice-King, three ministers to be nominated by the three treaty powers, and chiefs from the several districts of Samoa, the latter-to be elected for life. The Faipule should be elected by the people in the ratio of one representative for every 2,000 of the population and for the term of three years. Those chosen at the first election should be divided into three classes, so that one-third thereafter be elected in each year.\n\n“(5) The chief secretary and ministry of foreign affairs, the treasurer, and the minister of the interior, should be appointed by the King upon the nomination of the three treaty powers, and should serve for a term of — years, unless removed by the King upon the application of the three treaty powers. These ministers should have seats on the floor of the Faipule and take part in the debates.\n\n“(6) A municipal government shall be formed for Apia without interference by the foreign consuls. The government of the municipality shall consist of a council with local legislative powers, and a mayor or chief executive officer, to be appointed by the King and council.\n\n“(7) Foreign consuls shall retain criminal jurisdiction over their own countrymen, respectively, as heretofore.\n\n“(8) A court for the administration of justice among the natives shall be constituted, the judges to be appointed by the King and council without regard to their nationality, and the police officers and minor officials of the court shall be selected from the natives.\n\n“(9) The constitution should prohibit the imposition of pecuniary fines upon natives, and sentences for criminal offenses should be terms of imprisonment with labor on the public roads, buildings, and grounds.\n\n“(10) The sale of deadly weapons, or ammunition therefor, should be prohibited, as well as the sale of intoxicating liquors.\n\n“(11) A land commission should forthwith be organized, before whom all claims of title to land by foreigners shall be submitted, and whose judgment shall be final.\n\n“This commission shall consist of five members appointed by the King, of whom three shall be nominated by the three treaty powers, i.e., one by each of the said powers, and the remaining two selected by the King. They shall obtain the services of a competent engineer and assistants, who shall make correct survey and plots of the land respectively claimed, the cost of which survey and plots shall be paid by the claimants respectively. The said land commission shall inquire into the nature and extent of each and every land claim by foreigners, and whether good or valuable consideration was paid therefor, and no land shall be awarded to any claimant unless it be proved that at least value to the extent of per acre had been paid therefor, and in all cases where an illegal or immoral consideration has been given, where liquor or tire-arms, or weapons of any description form the consideration such claims shall be declared invalid and the land shall forthwith be restored to the control of the Government of Samoa.\n\n“(12) The judges of the land commission shall receive a salary of —— per annum, to be paid out of the revenues of the Kingdom, and shall appoint a clerk who shall duly keep the records of their proceedings.\n\n“(13) It shall be the duty of the said land commission to survey and set apart of the unclaimed or unoccupied land one-tenth part thereof, to be rented for the use and support of the public schools.\n\n“(14) To assist in raising revenue for the support of the Government, customs and tonnage dues shall be levied at the several ports of entry, and to this end each of the treaty powers will, negotiate identic treaties with Samoa in which the rates of said duties shall be established.\n\n“(15) Each of the treaty powers will alternately keep four months in each year a man-of-war in Samoan waters to assist in maintaining the Government so to be established and to preserve peace and order.”\n\nMr. von Alvensleben then read his memorandum, which was as follows:\n\n“The unsettled condition of affairs on the Samoan Islands having gradually become more and more injurious to the foreign residents and the commercial interests of the three treaty powers, the latter had to take into serious consideration the means by which the lasting peace and order could be restored there. With this view and the understanding that the independence of Samoa under a native government was to be maintained, and that no monopolies should be created there by any foreign power, the three treaty powers have agreed to the proposition of the Government of the [Page 206] United States of America to hold a conference of plenipotentiaries. It was further agreed that, in order to get complete and reliable information on which the conference would have to base its deliberations, special commissioners should be sent and instructed by the respective Governments to report on the condition of those islands. These reports having shown that the weakness and incapacity of the actual government are the principal causes of the present untenable state of affairs in the Samoan Islands, the Imperial German Government is of the opinion that an agreement upon the following points would be apt to lead to the intended result:\n\n“(1) King Malietoa having notoriously violated his treaty obligations toward Germany, and having even among the natives comparatively but few partisans, while a completely organized counter-government has been formed under Tamasese, a new election of king will have to take place according to the customs of the country. This election is to be freely made by the chiefs and the people of Samoa. This would meet the suggestion made by the honorable Secretary of State to the two other powers when this conference was proposed. It was said in those instructions ‘the three powers to uphold a competent and acceptable chief, to be chosen by the natives.’ The same proceeding has been observed previously when several chiefs arose as pretenders, and the treaty powers then recognized as king the one who had been elected by a majority of the population. As to the actual number of Malietoa’s partisans, a statement drawn up by Mr. Travers shows that the party of Tamasese is four times as large as Malietoa’s. The whole population of the Samoan Islands, except Manua, numbers 33,450, of which 5,800 comprise the party of Malietoa, 7,400 are indifferent, and 20,250 stand by Tamasese.\n\n“(2) As far as merely Samoan affairs are concerned, the administration of the country to be carried on, as was hitherto the case, by the king assisted by the native council, composed of the most prominent chiefs. The competence of the king and the co operation of the native council will have to be defined by special agreement.\n\n“(3) Experience having shown the incapability of the Samoans to maintain order and peace in their country, a foreign representative to be appointed as adviser to the King in order to strengthen the latter’s authority.\n\n“This adviser, who is to act as the mandatary of the three treaty powers, will have to discharge, under the nominal responsibility of the King, the Government affairs. He will have to control all necessary measures with regard to the maintenance of public order in general, and especially to the security of any kind of property of foreign residents. This adviser, whose position would be virtually that of a prime minister, to be nominated by the treaty power having for the time being the preponderating interests in Samoa. The nomination needs the approval of the two other powers. The first appointment to be made for the term of five years in the first instance, and at the expiration of that period a fresh appointment to be made on the same terms and conditions. In the event of the appointment becoming vacant during the said term of five years, through the death, resignation, or removal of the adviser, another person shall be similarly appointed to hold the office for the remainder of the said term.\n\n“(4) In order to avoid every misapprehension of the situation by the placing of the representative of one of the treaty powers in the most prominent position of the Samoan administration, it will be expedient to formally acknowledge anew the principle, already contained in the existing treaties with Samoa, of absolute equality of treatment in respect of commerce, navigation, jurisdiction, and all other matters whatsoever to be secured to the three powers and to their subjects and citizens.\n\n“(5) The irregularities which are known to have occurred in regard to the acquisition of land, and the disputes to which they have led between foreigners and natives make it appear expedient to consider the establishment of a special international court for the decision of claims and disputes relating to land. For the composition of this court due consideration will have to be given to the nationality of the parties.\n\n“(6) It will have to be one of the principal tasks of the new administration to regulate the finances and to draw up a budget in accordance with the needs of foreigners and natives. For this purpose, and in order to raise the requisite funds for the proper administration of the islands, as well as for promoting foreign trade and commerce, the question of levying taxes on foreigners with the consent of the three treaty powers will have to be considered.\n\n“(7) As the German interests in Samoa outweigh actually those of the two other powers, Germany is entitled to nominate the first adviser in accordance with the provisions established above under No. 3.\n\n“(8) The existing treaties with Samoa to be maintained, and the declarations made previously by Germany, the United States, and Great Britain with regard to the independence of Samoa to be confirmed, in order to avoid the appearance as if the present interference in the Samoan administration implied an intention of the annexation of Samoa by a foreign power.”\n\nSir Lionel West then read his memorandum, which was as follows:\n\n“It is understood that the three powers have no desire to found colonies in Samoa or to obtain commercial monopolies. Their sole wish is to establish the right and equality [Page 207] of commerce and navigation for their respective subjects and citizens. Assuming, then, that the three powers have no desire to destroy the independence of Samoa, but only seek to establish the right and equality of their commerce and navigation, a declaration to this effect might be made by them as a preliminary step. It was, however, deemed expedient to ascertain the exact state of affairs in the islands by sending special commissioners who should report thereupon. The reports are now before the plenipotentiaries of the three powers assembled in conference, and their general tenor leads to the conclusion that the Samoan natives are incapable of forming independently a stable and efficient administration for preserving their own independence and for securing to each power fall freedom of commerce, navigation, and jurisdiction of all matters affecting their respective subjects and citizens. Under these circumstances Her Majesty’s Government are prepared to advocate an agreement between the three powers on the principle that one of them should, as the mandatary of the other two, exercise as adviser of the Samoan Government supervision and control over the native affairs for a limited time, and should be charged with the duty of controlling the measures necessary for the better maintenance of public order in general, and especially for the security of the property of foreign subjects and citizens. Such a course seems indicated in Mr. Bates’ report when he says: ‘The real function of the intervening powers in Samoa will of necessity be actual administration of government. Nothing short of this, at least for a time, will remedy the existing condition of things.’\n\n“Such seems to be also the opinion of Mr. Travers and Mr. Thurston.\n\n“All three commissioners seem to recognize also the difficulty of tripartite control, such as more or less has been hitherto exercised; while at the same time they deprecate the establishment of the exclusive control of either one of the three powers. Assuming that the establishment of a native government, to be carried on by the king, who may be elected, assisted by a native council, is necessary to preserve the autonomy and independence of the islands, and which can only be established under foreign control, and assuming that tripartite control is impracticable, the solution of the difficulty would seem to be an alternate control for a limited period of either one of the three powers. In the event of coming to this agreement the question naturally arises as to which power should be chosen the mandatary of the other two in the first instance, and Her Majesty’s Government consider that preponderating commercial interests should be taken into consideration in deciding it.\n\n“Since Mr. Thurston, Mr. Travers, and Mr. Bates all seem to concur that this preponderance is possessed by Germany to a greater or less extent, Her Majesty’s Government are therefore prepared to consent to the mandatary power being exercised by the German representative for the first term of five years, absolute equality of treatment in respect of commerce, navigation, and jurisdiction, and all other matters whatsoever to be secured to the three powers and to their subjects and citizens.\n\n“In view of conflicting statements and disputes relating to land and land claims, Her Majesty’s Government advocate the establishment of an international land court to take cognizance thereof, and they also propose that the question of levying taxes on foreigners for revenue purposes shall be taken into consideration. In order to facilitate the working of the international land court, they propose that the existing land claims of foreigners should be disposed of by a commission previous to its establishment. The reports of Mr. Travers and Mr. Bates point to some such arrangement as necessary for the adjustment of pending disputes. Mr. Bates recommends a specially constituted court to take cognizance of land claims.\n\n“As far as consular jurisdiction is concerned, it seems to be expedient that it should remain unaltered, and only, therefore, requires the reassertion in any final convention or agreement concluded.\n\n“The conflicting claims to the sovereignty of the islands seem to render it necessary that a fresh appeal should be made to the native population for the election of a king. Since 1879–’80 King Malietoa has been recognized by Germany, Great Britain, and the United States as King of Samoa. Tamasese was appointed vice-king, and is now in open rebellion against Malietoa. War has only been averted by urging upon King Malietoa to await the decision of the three treaty powers; and a proclamation was subsequently issued by the three consuls denying recognition to Tamasese as king; but as it appears that he is not disposed to submit to Malietoa, a new election seems therefore imperatively called for before the Government can be properly constituted, and Her Majesty’s Government express no opinion, favorably or adversely, to the election of Malietoa.\n\n“Under any circumstances, in the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government, existing treaties should be maintained. These treaties, it may be remarked, are not signed by Malietoa, but are in the name of the Government of Samoa.”\n\nSir Lionel West said he was ready to discuss the various points suggested in the memorandums.\n\n[Page 208]\n\nMr. Bayard said he would not be ready to discuss them until an opportunity had been given him of reading the British and German views as taken down by the stenographer.\n\nThe conference then adjourned to meet at a time subsequently to be agreed upon.\n\nT. F. Bayard.\n\nAlvensleben.\n\nL. S. Sackville West.\n\nProtocol of Second Samoan Conference.\n\nConfidential.]\n\nMr. Bayard said he understood that all agreed upon the following points: That there should be no annexation of the islands by any of the treaty powers; that the independence and autonomy of the islands were to be preserved with equality of rights of commerce and navigation for the citizens or subjects of the treaty powers; that a native government was to be established and assisted to maintain itself; that the present jurisdiction of consuls over their own countrymen should be preserved; that the present treaties be maintained, so far as the rights of the three powers under them are concerned; that means of raising revenue for the support of the government should be devised, and that the question of taxing foreigners should be considered; that impost and tonnage duties should be established by identic treaties between the three powers and the Samoan Government; that a land court should be formed to settle titles and holding of lands in the group.\n\nIt had been admitted that the claims of foreigners to lands exceeded the entire area of the islands, and this was the best proof that the claims required overhauling by a court whose decision should be final.\n\nMr. Bayard further said that while it had been agreed that a native government should be established and assisted to maintain itself, the powers were not agreed as to its details. Great Britain and Germany proposed that there should be only a king and a council of chiefs. The United States suggested a king, a council of chiefs, and a legislative assembly, composed of representatives elected by the people of the islands. He was, however, inclined to believe that the greater the simplicity of the frame-work of the government the better, and he was disposed to place among the points of agreement that the native government should consist of the king and his council of chiefs.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said if there was such a legislative assembly as Mr. Bayard had proposed it should have a consultative and not a deciding vote, and that with this understanding he was not opposed to such an assembly.\n\nMr. Bayard replied that Germany had proposed its omission, and that it was in order not to stand upon form, but to get a substantial agreement that he had deferred to that proposal. He desired to facilitate agreement, and at the same time thought it not unadvisable to simplify the government as much as possible.\n\nSir Lionel West said he did not think his memorandum referred to the subject of identic treaties respecting impost and tonnage duties. He saw, however, no objection to the idea of identic treaties. After some further discussion it was decided that this should be taken as agreed upon in conference.\n\nMr. Bayard said there were some other points on which the propositions of the powers did not run so closely together. The first was as to the kingship. The United States, in view of existing treaties and of the declarations continuously made until within a very few months by the consuls of three treaty powers, had proposed the continued recognition of Malietoa Laupepa as king and of Tamasese as vice-king. The British and German Governments proposed a new election. In this, for the sake of coming to an agreement, he was disposed to concur. The United States would not object to a new election, but it should be a native election, free and unawed. The customs of the Samoans should prevail in it, and the result of the election should be announced to and declared by the three consuls, who should not otherwise participate in the proceedings.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben inquired whether that could be prevented?\n\nMr. Bayard replied that that comment would apply to the whole of the transaction. The islands were very remote from the countries whose representatives were now considering their government, and unless the agents of the three governments were actuated by a sense of absolute fairness to each other, and a desire to carry it out, there would be little hope, and he proposed that the agent of the United States should do nothing inconsistent with its action in the matter.\n\nSir Lionel West said he could assent to that proposition. The natives must elect the king, and the election must be free.\n\n[Page 209]\n\nMr. von Alvensleben inquired whether they should take into consideration the probability of the natives not arriving at an election. Malietoa’s party might say they had elected their man; Tamasese’s party might say: “We have our man; we won’t proceed to an election.” It was not unlikely, according to report, that the natives would not proceed to an election. Should not a certain time be fixed within which the election should take place? If it should not take place within that time, then the three powers should agree on a king.\n\nMr. Bayard said he did not anticipate the failure of the election; but it was in order to avoid any difficulty that he had proposed to let Malietoa remain as king, to which Germany and Great Britain objected.\n\nSir Lionel West said his Government had expressed no opinion hostile or adverse to Malietoa.\n\nMr. Bayard said he had not the slightest objection to the election of Malietoa if the people of Samoa should choose him. At present, however, there seemed to be no chance for him, if the statement made by Mr. von Alvensleben, that he was in a small minority, was just. But there was a difference of opinion on that subject.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben asked whether the newly-elected king should not be approved by the powers?\n\nMr. Bayard answered, no; that, on the contrary, there was to be a free election.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben inquired whether he would not have to be recognized by the powers?\n\nMr. Bayard said, yes; but that the election should be free and not interfered with.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said the people might nominate the king and the powers confirm him.\n\nMr. Bayard said that would virtually give the powers the control of the choice of a king. It would not be a native selection if it had to be made subject to the approval of somebody else. The object of the present arrangement was not to obliterate the rights of the islanders, hut to assist them in forming a civilized government; that a virtual neutralization of this group of islands was desirable, and this was to be secured by the abstention of the three powers from seeking any special control. This principle should underlie all that they were proposing. There had been a proposition from Germany, which had met with a certain degree of recognition from Great Britain, that the power having a preponderance of present commercial interest should exercise a preponderating influence.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said, not commercial altogether, because the Germans had also the greatest land interest.\n\nMr. Bayard said that was the claim. It would be this: that because Germany has a preponderance of numbers, of land, and of commerce she should therefore have a preponderance of weight in the counsels. It seemed to him that that proposition was in conflict with the principle upon which they propose to proceed, and that it was one that would increase as they progress. That is to say, that the ultimate result of admitting such a principle as that, and proceeding upon such a basis, would be to reduce the islands into a Germanic possession. Now that is certainly in conflict with the idea of virtual neutralization of the islands with which they set out, and not in accordance with the agreed plan, even upon the agreed points of the plan, and he referred to it now because they were approaching the question of the appointment of the chief executive officers, who would have more actual or practical power in controlling affairs there than any others., He could illustrate it better by saying that Germany proposed to have one prime minister. The United States proposed three ministers—a minister of foreign affairs, a minister of finance and treasury, and a minister of the interior—who should manage questions of lands and the like, and that they should be associated with the king and one native, making a council in that way of odd numbers, in which the three powers should have a majority, but that those officers should be separate and be appointed by the king, the idea being native appointment on foreign nomination. The German idea was that they should have a prime minister who should be the great executive, and control all, a depository of executive power, and that because Germany had more land, people, and commerce than the other two.\n\nSir Lionel West said only for a time.\n\nMr. Bayard said for five years as a basis, and a renewal again on the same terms. The suggestion was inconsistent with the principle with which they propose to conduct this arrangement, because it was at once starting upon a road that can lead but into one direction, and that is the complete domination of one power.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said the Imperial Government wanted to nominate and have the appointment subject to the approval of the other two powers, and therefore they gave every guaranty that was possible.\n\nMr. Bayard said he wished to draw attention to the fact that the importance of these islands is mainly because of their geographical position. They lie in the pathway of a commerce that is just being developed. The opening of the west coast of North America to civilization and commerce by means of the transcontinental railways had [Page 210] given to this group of islands an interest which they never had before, and moreover, we all hope for the penetration of the isthmus in some way or other. If that occurs a new feature of interest will be added to them. Great Britain, and Germany, and Spain, and France, at this time hold the island groups in Polynesia, and something more than mere islands. Great Britain owns Fiji and New Zealand and other islands. He said nothing of the continent of Australia. Great Britain has her settlement on New Guinea. Germany has the Marshal group and the Solomon Islands. She also has a settlement, and a very important one, on New Guinea. Spain has the Carolines; France makes claims to the New Hebrides. With a great ocean front on the Pacific, the United States have not acquired a foot of land in that region, but they were the first as a power to make a treaty with the Samoans. Our treaty antedates the rest and there was in it no special privilege of any kind. There was a cession to the United States for their use for a naval and coaling station of the harbor of Pango-Pango, which remains now as it was at the time it was ceded. It seemed to him that it was equally important to Germany and to all the other commercial nations and to the United States, that there should be a general line of action tending to secure the neutralization of that group of islands. There is something beyond the mere material present value of the land or the products, and it was for that reason the United States desired to see that group of islands maintained for the common use of nations, and the United States should receive the ready support of Great Britain and Germany in endeavoring to impress upon Samoa its counsels in favor of the proposed government. He would not go into a comparison of the relative importance of the Pacific commerce to the United States or to others. The interest of the United States was very great and quite equal to any other, and perhaps in some aspects greater, because less remote from the United States than from Great Britain or Germany, and because anything that is needed there as outposts these two countries have already acquired. The political policies of the United States are not such as to give the slightest alarm to the commereial interest of any other country. The policy of this Government in respect to acquisition of remote points has been pretty well defined, and it was for that reason that the Government of the United States was more disinterested by reason of its policies and by reason of its position in this matter than perhaps any other government equal in importance and having the same prospective interests in the commerce of the Pacific. Germany had proposed to take the nomination because at the time they had a greater amount of land, people, and money. He did not know what would be the result of the land commission upon German claims to title.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said that if there was any change it would be a very slight change, because all the German land titles had been surveyed by surveyors sent out from Germany. The whole amount of German property in cultivated land exceeded six times the land owned by other nations.\n\nMr. Bayard said he had an impression from all accounts that the cultivation of the land had been done largely by the Germans. What their title was to it he did not mean to say, because he had no knowledge. He meant to say that the reason of the principle they started upon was logically in favor of the nation not disposed, and which could not be disposed by its politics, to gain a preponderating influence in the islands.\n\nReferring to the land question, Mr. Bayard further said that, out of respect for native customs, he had proposed that the land court should consist of three foreigners, one to be nominated by each of the powers, and two natives; but the plan submitted by Mr. von Alvensleben proposed only three foreigners.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said that was only a land commission to prepare for the court.\n\nMr. Bayard did not perceive the utility of this.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said the object of the commission would be to investigate.\n\nMr. Bayard said he did not see the necessity of that. The land court proposed by Mm could send for papers, examine witnesses, and give judgment.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said the commission was intended to examine all the deeds, and, so far as possible, settle questions of title, leaving only such titles as they were not satisfied with to the court.\n\nMr. Bayard thought both functions germane to the same object, and that a single body would be more simple, and could with equal certainty and justice deal with the business, as if there were a commission to examine and a court subsequently to decide.\n\nSir Lionel West said it was intended to facilitate the action of the court by the creation of the commission.\n\nMr. Bayard said it was not an intricate matter, and if there was the right kind of court, with fair-minded men, who would deal with each other with justness between themselves and the people, they would move with more celerity and with more stability than if there were two bodies. There would be two rules of decision by having two different bodies.\n\n[Page 211]\n\nMr. von Alvensleben thought that general principles should be established, and that there should be an appeal from the land commission to the land court, whose decision should be final. He also asked how investigations could be made.\n\nMr. Bayard said the area to be gone over was not extensive, and that there was no function a board of commissioners could perform that the court could not equally perform.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben inquired what Mr. Bayard proposed in place of the German proposition of an adviser to the king, and read, in support of the proposition of his Government, the following remarks:\n\n“The opinion of the Imperial German Government that a lasting improvement of the condition of the Samoan Islands can not be expected from the actual existing native government, but only by foreign intervention, has been strengthened by the reports of the special commissioners, which are now before the conference. Such intervention can not be carried out with prospect of success in the way that the consuls of the three treaty powers at Apia attempt to assert simultaneously their influence with the Samoan authorities. The history of the last ten years shows that this only leads to rivalry between the foreign representatives, and to increase the weakness of the power of the native government. For the same reason it would be without any chance of success to try to strengthen the existing condition of affairs by calling the three consuls simultaneously into the Samoan administration. There is only one course left for asserting foreign influence with the Samoan Government, which is so necessary for the general interest, and this is to place one foreign officer at the head of the administration and to invest him with sufficient rights and powers to take the measures required for the maintenance of peace and order, as well as for the prosperous development of commerce and intercourse. As the authority of this official is to be noticeable in an unequivocal way to the foreigners as well as to the natives, it is commendable that the appointment should not be left to the Samoan Government, but be made by agreement between the treaty powers. At the same time it would appear that the power having to protect the largest interests in Samoa should be given the right to nominate the official whose duty it shall be to control the native government. That Germany is the power having the largest interests is questioned by nobody. Taking into consideration the dimensions and the value of the German interests represented in Samoa, and the great credit which Germany essentially deserves for having brought the Samoan Islands to their actual importance, it can not be fairly contested that Germany must be recognized by the other powers as being entitled to receive this mandate. Germany, or better, her subjects, pay alone half of all the taxes. The value of the German commerce with Samoa, without including the South Pacific, doubles the English and American commerce together. German subjects own in Samoa nearly double as much uncultivated land and nearly six times as much cultivated land. It can not therefore be expected that she should consent to remain more or less excluded from the efficient control of the country and have it pass to one of the two powers who have less interests.”\n\nMr. Bayard thought there was a misapprehension on Mr. von Alvensleben’s part as to any design of exclusion. On the contrary, perfect equality as to all was proposed. That would not affect in the least the question of the rights of German subjects or their property. The idea of the United States was that there should be one law for all, and that no one power should be more than another in the control of those questions.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben thought it more natural that the power that had the largest interests should also, after giving all the guaranties to the other powers, be nearest to control and the most responsible for it.\n\nMr. Bayard said it seemed to him that that reasoning forgot entirely the principle upon which the whole movement proceeded: that is, the native Government to preserve its own existence, while the contrary is that contended for by Germany. The idea of the United States was that there should be an equality of rights between the powers.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said that was intended. The powers ought to have equality of rights.\n\nMr. Bayard said another feature in the proposition submitted by him was that there was no suggestion of continuance of interference by the consuls in the government of that country, except with regard to the persons or interests of their individual citizens.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said he introduced the three consuls for the purpose of showing that Mr. Bayard’s proposal of three ministers would be equivalent to the three-party government; that the three representatives would almost come to the same thing.\n\nMr. Bayard said that up to the present time the three consuls had been recognized as three equals co-operating for an end, and under that Germany certainly could not find fault with the result, because her preponderance had been continually increasing, and the interference of the German consul with the affairs in Samoa had keen very [Page 212] marked, if he could take the accounts of the dispatches of the American vice-consul. There had, however, been no suggestion in his plan that there should be anything more of a consular government. He desired something to do away with the injustice which, it is said, has been done these people. It is not becoming that the three powers should be in a group of islands where the land claims of their citizens exceed the whole territory of those islands. Mr. Thurston, the British commissioner, had put that with complete force when he said they were absolutely punishing these people for acts which were the necessary result and consequence of the kind of government they had endured.\n\nSir Lionel West said his Government seemed to incline to a foreign control because they thought Without it there could be no stable government. Mr. Bates distinctly states it in his report. Mr. Thurston states it that without this intervention it is impossible to establish a stable government, and his Government were willing that this control should be exercised by a person appointed by one of the powers as the mandatary of the other two.\n\nMr. Bayard inquired what were his views about the native courts and the abolition of pecuniary fines.\n\nSir Lionel West said he thought they should agree as to those points.\n\nMr. Bayard inquired the views of the representatives of Germany and Great Britain as to his proposition as to titles to lands founded on the sales of fire-arms, etc.\n\nSir Lionel West said his Government were inclined to support that proposition.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said he did not think the proposition should have been stated so widely. The words “immoral” and “illegal” consideration had been used. It was difficult to define what was immoral.\n\nMr. Bayard said he had no objection to defining it.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said if it meant the sale of fire-arms it did not touch the Germans altogether.\n\nIt might, however, have happened that those people really would not take any money if they couldget fire-arms. If it was shown that they really gave the land away, they ought to get an additional sum. He suggested that what had been paid should be taken into consideration, and if it was too small an additional sum could be fixed by the land commission or the land court.\n\nMr. Bayard inquired as to his proposition to intrust minor offices, those that touch the natives themselves, to natives instead of foreigners.\n\nSir Lionel West said it was a difficult matter, but the principle ought to be that they should be natives.\n\nMr. Bayard said it would be a great means of native education, and that the natives should be educated in self-government.\n\nSir Lionel West asked whether he did not think that a very good reason for establishing foreign control.\n\nMr. Bayard said foreign assistance and native government should be combined. Hence he had proposed that in the council of the king there should be three foreigners, a minister of foreign affairs, of the interior, and a treasurer. These ministers would doubtless have a paramount voice, but they would be associated with two natives. One might be a German, another an Englishman, and another an American. Their functions would, in a great measure, be independent, and ought to be.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben asked whether they would be chosen by the foreign powers?\n\nMr. Bayard said, yes.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said it would be difficult to find three such persons in Samoa not identified with what had been going on there, and that if they were so chosen he was afraid they would not be able to withdraw from the influence of their nationality.\n\nMr. Bayard said if there was only one man he would not be able to overcome the influence of his nationality, but if there were three men, with distinct, different functions, they would act as a check upon each other. But if the nominee of one of the powers acted merely as a partisan, his Government should remove him. There should be the readiest disposition in this regard, and the United States had already shown its disposition to act promptly.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said he had been instructed to lay before the conference, in order to facilitate its work, a draught of a convention between the three treaty powers, a memorandum on the land disputes, and a memorandum on the financial question. These were, respectively, as follows:\n\n[Translation.]\n\ndraught agreement between germany, england, and the united states of america concerning the samoan islands.\n\nThe Governments of His Majesty the Emperor of Germany, Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the United States of America, inspired by the desire of establishing a better settlement of affairs on the Samoan Islands, have agreed upon the following dispositions:\n\n[Page 213]\n\nArticle I.\n\nA new election of a king shall take place in Samoa, with which object a meeting of the chiefs of all the districts entitled thereto in the Samoan Islands shall be summoned within two months from the day of the conclusion of this agreement.\n\nThe king can be nominated either for life or for a certain number of years; his nomination must be confirmed by the three treaty powers.\n\nArticle II.\n\nThe administration of the common affairs of the Samoan Islands shall be conducted by the king assisted by a council composed of representatives of the different districts; the convocation and composition of the latter in detail shall be reserved for a subsequent arrangement.\n\nArticle III.\n\nThe treaty power which for the time being has the preponderating interests in Samoa shall, with the concurrence of the two other powers, appoint a representative, to be invested with the functions of adviser to the Government of Samoa.\n\nHe will be first appointed for a term of five years, and after the expiration of this period a new nomination shall take place for the same time and under the same conditions.\n\nIn the event of the appointment of the representative falling vacant during the five years period, by death, resignation, or any other cause, another official shall be similarly appointed, to hold office for the remainder of the said term.\n\nThe representative as the mandatary of the three treaty powers will be charged with the duty of controlling the measures necessary for the efficacious maintenance of peace and order in general, and especially for the security of the plantations, dwellings, and other property of foreign subjects in Samoa.\n\nArticle IV.\n\nThe agreement as to the establishment of a municipality in Apia concluded between Germany, England, and the United States, on the 2d September, 1879, and prolonged for an indefinite period on the 29th September, 1883, shall cease to be in force on and after the—\n\nArticle V.\n\nAbsolute equality of treatment in respect of commerce, navigation, jurisdiction and other matters shall be secured to the three treaty powers and their subjects and citizens in Samoa.\n\nArticle VI.\n\nWith the view to the examination and decision of disputes relative to land, a commission shall be established, before which all disputed land claims are to be lodged within a fixed period. There shall be an appeal from the decision of the commission to a special court of land disputes within a period not exceeding three months. The composition and jurisdiction of the commission and of the court are defined in Annex I.\n\nArticle VII.\n\nIn order to raise the necessary funds for the proper administration of the Samoan Islands and for the development of foreign trade, commerce, and navigation, the Government of Samoa shall have the right to levy the dues and taxes specified in Annex II.\n\nArticle VIII.\n\nThe existing treaties of friendship, commerce, and navigation between the three powers and Samoa shall be maintained, and no alteration with regard to them shall take place without the consent of the treaty power thereby affected.\n\nArticle IX.\n\nThe Governments of the three treaty powers renew and confirm on this occasion their former declarations in regard to the maintenance of the independence and neutrality of the Samoan Islands.\n\n[Page 214]\n\n[Translation.]\n\nland disputes.\n\nThe disputes relating to real estate and the acquisition of land in Samoa demand a special treatment.\n\nThis sort of dispute is to be withdrawn from the cognizance of the consuls and from the jurisdiction of the English high commissioner, respectively. It is consonant to the general principles of justice that disputes relating to real estate should be decided by the laws and courts of the country in which the object of the dispute is situated. In the present case, however, it must further be taken into consideration that in the absence of any sort of legal provision as to the conditions, requirements, and formalities necessary for the valid transfer of land, and in consequence of the utter complication existing in the ownership, irregularities, and, it may be, acts of injustice, have occurred which absolutely demand an impartial decision based upon a thorough examination and investigation of the matter. Such disputes are to be settled in a uniform procedure and according to uniform principles, to be previously laid down by the treaty powers with the agreement of the Samoan Government, by an authority to be specially instituted, and in the last instance by a land court to be specially created. For this purpose it would seem advisable, after establishing the general principles on which the decision as to the validity of land transfers are to be based, first, to appoint a commission composed of three members, each of the three treaty powers naming one. Before this commission all claims which are raised by foreigners with regard to land in the Samoan Islands must be filed within a certain period, the claims must be accompanied by the titles and other documents, or duly authenticated copies, relating thereto.\n\nThe members of the commission are appointed by the Samoan Government on the proposal of the treaty powers and receive their salaries, the amount of which is to be fixed beforehand, from the former. A part of the expenses caused thereby will be covered by fees to be levied by the commission for their work according to a fixed tariff; the remainder will be defrayed out of the general cost of the administration, since it would not be fair that real estate should have to bear alone the whole of the not inconsiderable cost, amounting probably at least to a sum of more than $30,000.\n\nThe presidency of the commission would, according to the state of affairs, be assigned to the representative of the power which has the most extensive interests in the country.\n\nAs far as the title deeds do not in themselves offer room for doubt as to the legality of the acquisition, all lands acquired before the conclusion of the German-Samoan and English-Samoan treaties, respectively, that is, before the 24th January and 28th August, 1879, respectively, and also under the same conditions, all lands which, within the last two or three years, have been put under cultivation by the new owner shall be registered as validly acquired without prejudice to the claims of third persons. On the other hand, the acquisition shall not be regarded as legal, and registration shall be provisionally refused in cases where the claimant is only in a position to produce as a proof of his legal acquisition of the land a so-called promise of sale, as well as in cases where the land has not been surveyed within two or three years following the conclusion of the sale, or where the deed of sale contains no precise description of the boundaries of the land sold, or where at the time of the conclusion of the contract the price of the land has not been paid in full to the seller, without prejudice, however, to the claimant’s right to demand a judicial decision. The commission shall be invested with the right of citing before them, through the local authorities, for examination, and of hearing, as witnesses, the sellers and any other persons whom they may think fit to supply information. A very important question, especially touching land disputes between foreigners, concerns the determination of the right of ownership and disposition of the land sold, on the part of native sellers. Numerous cases will present themselves in which one and the same piece of land has been sold by different persons styling themselves the owners to different parties, or in which pieces of land have been sold by persons whose right to the ownership and disposition of that land is disputed on the part of other Samoans. In this case the commission shall be empowered, through the local government of the district in which the disputed land lies, to institute a native commission to determine the seller’s right of ownership and to lay the result of such investigations, together with the underlying motives, before the foreign commission; this decision, however, shall not be binding on the latter. Such native commissions would have also to be charged with the examination, and, if required, with the decision of land disputes existing between the Samoans themselves. Pieces of land which for ten years or more have, without dispute, been cultivated, or at least made use of, by foreigners, shall, without further inquiry, be regarded as property legally owned or acquired by prescription.\n\nClaims of third parties to such pieces of land shall be brought to judicial decision only then and in so far as, in accordance to the dispositions with regard to the interruption of the prescription, the claim to the land has been presented to the actual [Page 215] holder in written form at least once within the period of ten years. The foreign commission must further be authorized to give a provisional decision as to disputes relating to possession and ownership of land or to effect an amicable arrangement. The litigant shall have the right of appeal from the decisions of the commission, or of demanding a judicial decision by the land court. Whenever Samoans are involved as “parties in such disputes, the foreign commission shall invoke the co-operation of a Samoan chief to be nominated by the government of the district where the land lies, or of the Samoan judge in Apia.\n\nThe final settlement of the land disputes takes place by the judicial decision of the land court. The latter is composed of a judge, to be nominated by the Samoan Government, and of the consul or of one of the prominent countrymen of the litigant.\n\nThere is no appeal from the decision of this court.\n\nfinance.—estimate of yearly budget.—revenue.\n\n1.

Postal receipts 1,000 Total 89,463\n\n[Page 216]\n\nfinance.\n\nIn drawing up the inclosed budget of receipts the principle has been followed of leaving Samoa the charter of a free-trade country. Quite apart from the fact that in Article III of the treaty of commerce between the United States of America and Samoa provision is made for the exemption of the cargoes of all American ships from duties of every sort, the introduction of merely financial duties (Finanzzölle) seemed undesirable in the interest of a free and unrestricted development of Samoan commerce. On the other hand, no objection could be raised to taking into consideration a small statistical duty at the rate of 1 per cent, ad valorem on merchandise imported into the islands, as well as a duty at about the same rate on products exported from Samoa. At present only copra cotton, and, to a small extent, coffee are in question. Only for spirituous liquors, arms, and ammunition real import duties have been introduced into the budget. The consumption of brandy, especially on the part of the natives, shall be checked thereby. For the sake of uniformity an import duty will also be imposed upon beer and wine, both articles of consumption which are used only by the better-situated classes, and which can easily bear a comparatively not very high tax. Also the import of arms shall be restricted by the duties imposed. It may well be taken for granted that the Government of the United States would also give their consent to the proposed taxes and statistical duties.\n\nMoreover, the budget of receipts has been drawn up on the model of the existing arrangements, and the greater number of the items have been based upon the taxes hitherto levied by the municipal administration of Apia. Great care has been taken with regard to the calculation of an increase to be expected to result from a more developed commerce, and it may be said in general that the items have been fixed at a very low rate. The taxation of the natives has similarly been based on the model of existing institutions. More than $20,000 has been raised by the Government of Samoa alone by a capitation tax paid by districts. The government of Malietoa has also attempted to exact a capitation tax, it is true, without success. The fault, however, lay neither with the system of taxation nor with the rate of the tax, but exclusively with the weakness and inactivity of the Government and the want of the necessary administrative apparatus. The taxation of the natives seemed the less objectionable, as the native element, it would appear, is called to be the first to participate in the advantages of the new government, and as, besides that, by the plan proposed a considerable part of the taxes raised shall be expended on the salaries and fixed remuneration of Samoan officials.\n\nWith regard to the several items of the receipts the following remarks may be made. Ad. 1.—Capitation on Samoans, $37,500. The population of the Samoan Islands, with the exception of the Manna group, may now be taken as between 33,000 and 35,000 souls. The sum total of the capitation tax represents, therefore, about $1.10 per head of the whole population, and about $3 per head of the adult male portion thereof. The Samoans are perfectly conscious of their obligation to contribute to the public revenue in the way of a capitation tax. It has practically been introduced for many years, even though, as already observed, it has not been regularly levied. In 1872 a capitation tax of $1 for adult males, 50 cents for young people, and 25 cents for male children, without distinction of age, was imposed in order to defray the expenses of buying arms. The fixing of the rate per head served only as a measure for the calculation of the tax. The Government in Leulumoega has twice daring the last year imposed a tax of $1 per head on the male population. The tax was levied by districts and handed over to the Government. The ambition of the several districts to contribute as large sums as possible led to the result that the total sum of the taxes actually paid was considerably in excess of the sum calculated for according to the rate fixed of $1 per head of the male population.\n\nIf the Government there has now actually raised in its districts alone already more than $20,000 a year by a capitation tax, the figure set down in the budget for the whole of Samoa of $37,500 can hardly be regarded as excessive, all the less so, as the islands, not counting the yield of the German plantations, produce now in copra alone 3,000 tons, and could yield, with a moderate increase of activity, to which the obligation to pay the taxes may well give the necessary impetus, a considerably larger quantity, on the proceeds of which the population does not rely for its sustenance.\n\nIn Tonga, for instance, with a population of 20,000 souls, a capitation of $60,000 a year is raised.\n\nIn practice it would be advisable to apportion the whole tax among the several districts according to the number of the male population and to charge the Government with the task of levying it.\n\nThe taxes are to be paid in cash. Payments in kind would necessitate a complicated organization, which would be better avoided at the first establishment of an administration. The system of money payments which exists in Tonga has, besides, worked satisfactorily, while in Fiji the system of payment in kind has afforded less good results. Moreover, the Samoans are accustomed to pay their taxes in money.\n\n[Page 217]\n\nFrom political reasons the payment of taxes by giving arms in lieu of money might perhaps be taken into consideration.\n\nAd. 2 and 3.—Boats and fire-arms are suitable objects for a tax on property. The rates provided for are fixed at an exceedingly low figure. It may well be assumed that there are over 2,000 guns in the country. At first, however, payment of the taxes will be frequently eluded.\n\nAd. 4.—\n\nland tax.\n\nThe land taxes on houses and other real estate, serving for commercial purposes, which are already in force in Apia, can be maintained at the same rate of 1 per cent, ad valorem; as yet they have given no cause of complaint. The revenues will be considerably increased by a valuation representing more accurately the real values, as well as by the increased activity in building on the part of foreigners who may be expected to flock in in consequence of the establishment of an orderly state of affairs. The value of the houses and other establishments outside Apia is put, after a careful examination, at $200,000. A direct taxation of the plantations is not intended, as they are already affected indirectly by other taxes, such as the dues for the control of laborers (Arbeitercontrollgebühren) or those levied on the importation of laborers, and the exportation of products, and as, besides, it would seem to be in the interest of the Government to encourage the cultivation of plantations.\n\nAd. 5 and 6.—Controlling dues (Kontrollsteuern) on all sorts of plantation laborers and import dues on laborers. It seems appropriate that a tax should be raised for the control exercised through the authorities over the laborers; in the same way a tax on each imported foreign laborer is justified.\n\nAd. 7 and 8.—A valuation of the revenue to be derived from the dues levied for the registration of contracts of sale, as well as from stamp-tax levied at the rate of 1 per cent, ad valorem on all documents relating to the transfer of property is almost impossible; but in any case the figures set down are estimated at a very low rate.\n\nAd. 9.—\n\ntaxes on trades (gewerbesteuer.)\n\nThe municipality of Apia levies a trade-tax on all commercial businesses, on ships engaged in trade there, on artisans, and commercial clerks. It is advisable to maintain these taxes. A more accurate valuation, the immigration of foreigners, and the taxation of all trades pursued outside Apia, will probably result in greater increase of revenue than that estimated in the budget. Special mention must be made of the ships calling at the harbor of Apia for commercial purposes (trading vessels). They have not approximately the same expenses of business that the resident merchants have; they turn over their capital more quickly, and have, by existing regulations, only to pay a single tax of $10. For the protection of native industry it is desirable that ships of this sort should be subjected to a due five times as great.\n\nUnder 9, III, provision is also made for a trade-tax on white laborers.\n\nAd. 10.—The license tax for taverns now yields to the municipality a return of $775. By raising the rate of this tax itself as well as by an increase in the number of taverns, which is to be expected in consequence of the greater influx of foreigners, an increase of revenue to the amount of $1,000 may be reckoned on, and all the more so as the taverns established outside Apia will now be subject to the tax.\n\nAd. 11 and 12.—The rates set down under the items “statistical commercial dues on imports and exports,” and “import duties,” have been arrived at after careful investigation of the statistics hitherto known, and by following the principle that as small a burden as possible shall be laid upon commerce. For imports a duty of 1 per cent, ad valorem seems appropriate; the tax on exported products will be about 1½ to 2 per cent. In the budget drawn up by an American, Mr. Moors, provision was made for a tax of 3 per cent. The smaller rate of 1 per cent, here set down relieves the Government of all the apparatus of customs officers. The collection of the tax can be left to the harbor-master. This is taking for granted that Apia should be declared the only port of entry, an arrangement which will not be found burdensome by anybody, and which will also prove useful for the control of navigation.\n\nAd. 13 to 17.—With respect to the pilot dues, it is believed that they will undergo a small increase. This has in fact been already effected by the new German steamer communication, and will be still more the case in consequence of the increase of shipping which is to be expected. The judicial fees and fines can not be approximately calculated. The figures set down appear very low. The revenue to be derived from the postal service has been calculated on the statistical returns of the municipal postmaster in Apia.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben inquired what length of time the King should be chosen for, and suggested that that might be left for the natives.\n\nMr. Bayard said he thought so; he preferred to follow the Samoan customs and traditions.\n\n[Page 218]\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said he thought his Government might not object to a vice-king, but he wished for the present to reserve his opinion on that subject.\n\nSir Lionel West said his Government might object.\n\nMr. Bayard said he had suggested it in his original proposition in order to enable the Samoans to gratify their recognition of their leading people, as well as to provide for a succession in case of the death of the King.\n\nThe conference then adjourned to meet again at such time as should be agreed upon.\n\nT. F. Bayard.\n\nAlvensleben.\n\nL. S. Sackville West.\n\nProtocol of Third Samoan Conference..\n\nConfidential.]\n\nMr. Bayard said that at the last meeting Mr. von Alvensleben seemed to withdraw or qualify his objection to the Faipule. With a view to simplicity in the Government, and with a disposition to concede everything that might be done for coming to an agreement, he had not stood upon that point, and he desired to know what ideas Mr. von Alvensleben would approve in relation to the Faipule.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said it had been agreed that there should be a king and a council of native chiefs. It might be well, instead of keeping the whole Taimua as a council, to take the principal chief, or such as may be appointed from the Taimua into the king’s council, and thus do away with the Taimua as such. The Taimuas really do the business, not, however, without conferring first with their Faipules. By taking some members into the king’s council from the Faipule these also might be done away with. But the Faipules might as well be kept, with only a consultative vote on Samoan matters.\n\nSir Lionel West said then it would not be a legislative body.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said they might be a legislative body, but would only have a consultative vote. Their powers should be limited. They ought to have the right of accepting or rejecting the propositions made to them by the King and the council. The more you limit this body the more easily it will be managed.\n\nSir Lionel West asked whether they might not do away with it altogether?\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said he had no objection, but he thought its preservation might bring the Samoans more readily to accept this arrangement. If it was thought better to do away with it, he had no objection. And perhaps the Taimuas might also be called together every year, only to select a certain number out of their body who should for a certain time—for a year, or two, or three—belong to the King’s council. This would still reduce the number.\n\nMr. Bayard said he understood that Mr. von Alvensleben’s suggestion was that their duties should simply be consultative, and that he did not propose to give legislative power.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said: To the King and council, yes; but not to the Faipule.\n\nMr. Bayard said that was the only one they had under consideration—the legislative branch which he proposed, but which was rejected by both the other members of the conference.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said that if Mr. Bayard thought it better to do away with the Faipule he had no objection.\n\nSir Lionel West said he also had none.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben said if it was thought to be in the interests of the whole settlement, and of disposing of the matter favorably, he had no objection to keeping the Faipule.\n\nMr. Bayard said his idea of the whole matter was that the simpler their scheme for the government of this people the better; but he would be strongly disposed to respect their traditions and customs as far as may be, and let them have those governmental bodies that they have been accustomed to, and if the Faipule was one, to maintain it.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben thought there was no difficulty. There would be no objection to keep them on. It would perhaps be well to reduce them in number and to limit their legislative powers. They should only be allowed to accept or to reject what was submitted by the king’s council. They could then do no harm.\n\nMr. Bayard inquired whether he meant that their consent should be essential to the enactment of measures.\n\nMr. von Alvensleben replied, yes, in native affairs. He should like to repeat that he was quite ready to do away with it if that was preferred.\n\nMr. Bayard then referred to the land question. His suggestion was that a land court should be formed, before whom all claims for lands in the islands should be [Page 219] brought and whose decision should be final; but it bad been suggested that a land commission should precede the land court, so that there should be an appeal. His comment upon that was that it was an unnecessary complication of duties and a reduplication of officials, costly, and tending to conflict, and opposed to that simplicity in the affairs of this very simple people that he thought one of the wisest features of his suggestion. There was no complex system of landlaws in Samoa.\n\nSir Lionel West said there was not even a basis of a land system.\n\nMr. Bayard said consequently no great learning in land laws was required by the adjudicators. What was needed was substantial justice, of which the first element was honest dealings between the persons who had acquired these lands and those who were the prior owners or controllers of them. He could not perceive any necessity whatever, but, on the contrary, a good deal that was useless and embarrassing, in having two sets of men to act upon these questions. International commissions had been frequent, before whom had been brought questions of boundary between adjacent countries and questions of losses growing out of claims mutually against the parties, but he had never heard in any case that it was necessary to precede the tribunal of arbitration and settlement by another commission to sift out in advance, and he thought it would be difficult to find a precedent for it.\n\nSir Lionel West then read to the conference the following observations:\n\nWith regard to the proposed land commission, Her Majesty’s Government are strongly of the opinion that it will be found necessary to facilitate the labors of the land court when established. Land claims in Samoa are of a very complicated nature, and it will be absolutely necessary to collect such preliminary evidence in order to facilitate the final decisions of the special court. The obtaining of such evidence and the adjustment of existing disputes by mutual concessions could not properly be confided to a final court of appeal, whose judicial competency might be thereby impaired. It appears to me that the labors of the commission which it is proposed to appoint should be directed to the collection and classification of all existing claims, which can not be adjusted by compromise, for submission to the land court, which, after pronouncing upon them, would, for the future, be free to deal with all land questions arising upon their own merits. It must be borne in mind that not even a basis of a land system prevails in Samoa at present, and it is this basis which it is sought to establish by the preliminary labors of the commission. If this principle is admitted, the composition of the commission and the nature of its labors will have to be defined.\n"
