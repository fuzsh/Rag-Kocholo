It was an age of foreign, no longer of civil, war; for over sixty years in the next century and a quarter France and England fought for ascendancy in Europe and for dominion beyond the sea. England generally had Continental allies, but at times she battled alone; of coalitions she was the surest member and the pivot. In the struggle she doubled the Empire begun by the Stuarts and Cromwell, lost most of her early gains, and on the ruins built a second empire wider than the first. The Industrial Revolution slowly gathered force after the foundation of a national bank to meet war-time needs, and by the year of Waterloo was changing the face and mind of the country far faster than its[Pg 8] political sense could realise or regulate. In thought the age between James's flight and the downfall of Napoleon was more a time of digestion than of new ideas. The conflicts whose roots lie in the Reformation found at last, so far as political expression was concerned, a national settlement, and the fury and brilliance that had made England the most unstable of European countries faded gradually into the cold light of accepted compromise. The Constitution, once the principles of the Revolution had been worked out, saw no cataclysms, but many adjustments. The ascendancy of Parliament became clearer as the financial and military necessities of the government grew; Scotland, and a century later, Ireland, were brought into this Parliament. There the most ambitious and eloquent members of a well-educated aristocracy fought for mastery: they shared the prejudices of their class, but their views differed widely in detail, and represented more closely than is often allowed the conscious political desires of the nation, even when they ignored its unspoken wants. Law and tradition grew in force, until unconstitutional methods lost nearly all their appeal. We begin the age with an England embarked on a limited revolution meant to conserve, not to destroy, but doubtful[Pg 9] of its own mind, feeling herself menaced by a centralised and far stronger neighbour in France, threatened at home by parties still without the restraint that was to make them a fairly efficient means of government. We end it with a United Kingdom that is the firmest state in Europe, burdened with taxes and mutinous, yet nearer to being the arbiter of Europe than ever before or since.\n\n1688 is small fry as revolutions go, but it marked a change in the political character of England. She had gained an unsavoury reputation for swinging between violent extremes, from Tudor despotism based on popular consent to the autocracy of Charles I., thence to presbyterian dominance of the House of Commons, from that to the rule of the sword, and back through a restoration of the monarchy made by Calvinistic parliamentarians to the twin supremacy in Church and State of parson and squire. Recently the pendulum had oscillated still more rapidly, from Whig to Tory reigns of terror. Every party aimed at the destruction of its enemies, or at least at their permanent exclusion from Office. There were few events of the last half-century in which all could take pride, for victories had been won either over part of the nation or while part was proscribed. Must the pendulum[Pg 10] swing again through a shortening arc? Temporary unity against the Catholic-absolutist policy of James had brought William to London, but alliances easy to weld in Opposition break down when something constructive must be done. Who was to rule and on what conditions? Even if England, a proud and quarrelsome nation, set the crown on William's head, could she keep it there, accept a king whom many must regard as a conqueror, who came from a nation that she had fought thrice in the last forty years?\n\nThe immediate need was for some government. James's second flight eased the problem: it deprived the Tories, who had mainly acquiesced in rather than favoured William's adventure, of the keystone of their creed and the natural head of their party. It made slightly plausible the idea that he had resigned his rights, not been deprived of them. The day after James landed in France, William, at the request of an impromptu assembly, assumed the government. A convention to settle Crown and Constitution was called for January; it was to be in every respect a parliament save that no king bade it meet.\n\nWhen the Convention gathered on January 22 it showed at once that the apparent unanimity of the autumn had gone. Few[Pg 11] wanted James back in power, but the Church party, led by Nottingham and the bishops, hoped to keep him as titular King, vesting the government in Mary or William as regent, and half the Lords upheld this view. Danby proclaimed Mary's right to be full queen; Halifax and the Whigs argued for William—Halifax because he thought this the most practical course, many Whigs hoping by omitting the children of James to slay hereditary right. The Commons swiftly agreed to a portmanteau resolution that James had violated the original contract between King and people (an inaccurate popular version of Whig political theory), had broken the nation's fundamental laws, and finally had abdicated, so that the throne was vacant: \"abdication\" conciliated some Tories who disputed the nation's right to depose its prince. The Lords debated this resolution, and the next, who should rule, for a week; barely rejected a regency, denied a vacancy in the Crown, and finally, when William let it be known that he would be neither regent nor prince consort, agreed with the Commons. William and Mary were nominated as joint rulers, but the government was given to William alone.\n\nMeanwhile the Commons had drawn up a declaration that condemned various acts of[Pg 12] James, and denied the Crown's power to suspend laws or to keep an army without Parliamentary consent. On February 13, 1689, William and Mary accepted this, and were proclaimed. The Convention declared itself a parliament, and turned to settle the nation's problems. But this attempt to legalise revolution did not make it secure. War with France was certain: Ireland was aflame for Catholicism and James: none could say how Scotland would go. In England the Anglican clergy, who since 1660 had preached the duty of non-resistance to Government in a crescendo, doubted that they could accept a monarchy based on rebellion. The Whigs hoped to revenge the last seven years on the Tories, and the Tories, normally the larger party, might abandon a settlement based on Whig principles.\n\nNor was William's character a source of political strength. It was easier to admire than to love him; he was in thought and tastes a foreigner, who found little in England to his liking. He treated the frequent disloyalty of English ministers with a cold magnanimity that sprang more from policy than from kindliness. He was often peevish if seldom cruel, and it was only to a few friends or in battle that his manners became frank. His dislike[Pg 13] of court gossip, joined to asthma unbearable in London smoke, made him shut himself off from society at Hampton Court or in Kensington fields, and alienated those who liked to flutter in Whitehall. He was the best diplomatist of his time, but never understood English political ideas. He wished to retain for the Crown all the powers of Charles II. save those forfeited in the Declaration of Right. But the Whigs, his natural allies, aimed at more than a change of king; they wanted to define unsettled constitutional points in a parliamentary sense and to make William a channel for their exercise of patronage. Tories, though better friends of monarchy, were reluctant to see him use powers they would have left unquestioned to a Stuart. The new King had been created in men's sight by man, not by God, and coronation without birthright could make him at best a candle that tried to replace a sun. Moreover, the Tories were very English, and everything Dutch about William jarred them into opposition; they were soon fighting harder than the Whigs for an English parliament's supremacy. William felt criticism as a slight, could not see that constitutional change was in the nature of things, and thought each new limit on his power another piece of ingratitude to the[Pg 14] nation's liberator. But he had a saving sense of reality that kept him from resisting to the end: he gave way where Charles I. would have tried evasion, James II. force.\n\nThe most critical time came swiftly. In March, 1689, James landed in Ireland; on the same day two Scottish regiments mutinied at Ipswich; five days later Dundee fled from the Presbyterian Convention at Edinburgh to raise the Highlands for James. In April James was before Londonderry, the only place in Ireland save Enniskillen that resisted his authority. A Grand Alliance of Austria, Spain, Holland, England and Savoy took arms against the threat of French ascendancy, and a struggle began that was to last, with a short interlude, for twenty-four years. Prospects were so uncertain that Danby, who had rallied the north and many Tories to William, and Halifax who had helped to crown him, thought the odds were against his triumph.\n\nProtestant dissent needed attention, for James had made the Church bid for its support, and the Clarendon code was no longer enforceable. The Lords agreed to widen the establishment and to comprehend in it moderate Nonconformists. The Commons feared the suggestion, and chloroformed it by leaving Convocation to take the first step. That[Pg 15] body met in November, and its lower house, more conservative than the bishops and less political, refused to consider the plan. It was too late or too early for such a measure: the extreme Dissenters must have been omitted, and feared that comprehension would strengthen a persecuting Church; the moderates clung to independence, the clergy to their monopoly of endowments and authority. But toleration could not be shelved, and a bill legalising Nonconformist worship under narrow limitations passed unopposed. It was the only part of James's policy that the Revolution adopted, though he had offered dissent a share in government, not bare tolerance only. Its importance lay in the future, for, narrow as it was, it reversed the policy of twenty-five years, recognised that uniformity was unattainable, and moved towards the separation of Church and State.\n\nWilliam was as well inclined to toleration as his father-in-law, and asked Parliament to modify the Test Act so as not to exclude any Protestant from the royal service. He found few supporters, and indeed such a change would have set half the nation's pulpits thundering denunciation, but the Whigs retaliated on the victorious Church by enacting that all beneficed clergy and officials must take[Pg 16] an oath of allegiance by August, 1689, on pain of suspension for six months and deprivation after if they were still recalcitrant. The great majority swore, though not all happily; but about four hundred, including Archbishop Sancroft and seven bishops, refused and were eventually ejected. Thus began the Non-juring schism, which lasted for over a hundred years. Most of those turned out would have done no mischief, and neither preached nor intrigued against William, but they would not vow obedience to an order based on a right of resistance that they denied.\n\nThe war, William's chief care, went badly at first. France devastated the Rhine palatinate; a French squadron repulsed an English in Bantry Bay and landed troops in Ireland, where a Parliament that contained only fifteen Protestants in both houses was busy undoing the Cromwellian land settlement, attainting some 2500 persons, and declaring full independence. Kirke failed in June to relieve Derry; Dundee had swept such clans as hated the Campbells into an army that could not last, but might overrun half Scotland. Prospects brightened in July. At Killiecrankie Dundee smashed Mackay's force but fell in victory, and four weeks later his army dispersed. Derry was relieved in the same[Pg 17] week, and an allied victory eased French pressure in Flanders.\n\nWilliam found Parliament increasingly troublesome as the year wore on. It voted him supplies, but not, as was the custom, for life; this was natural, since the Commons wished to ensure frequent sessions, but William thought it showed unjustified distrust. In fact, there was no danger of an attack on Parliament's life; two securities had unwittingly been created. The Mutiny Act, passed after the Ipswich mutiny had been crushed by Dutch troops, was one, for it legalised a standing army for seven months only, and if it expired military law must cease and soldiers become liable only to a civil court and for civil offences. The second was the war, certain to make annual votes necessary whatever permanent supplies were given to the king: the expense of government was steadily rising, and even peace would not make the monarchy independent.\n\nParliament turned the Declaration into the Bill of Rights, but most of its time went in disputes between the Houses and in party struggles of increasing bitterness. A Tory reaction had begun. This might seem a reason for Whig moderation, but the instinct then was to meet rising opposition by hastening[Pg 18] the pace. The nation wanted an indemnity for those who had connived at James's arbitrary acts; none wanted it more than William, who wished to be king over both parties, not to see one harrying the other into extremes. The Whigs admitted that indemnity there must be, but lingered over exceptions till the bill became a proscription as well as a pardon. At length to a measure restoring the corporations packed by James, they added, while Tory members kept Christmas holiday, a clause making all concerned in the late surrender of charters incapable of corporation office for seven years. This would drive all prominent Tories from local councils, making these, and the seats in Parliament they filled, Whig preserves. The Tories mustered and removed the clause; the Whigs delayed indemnity still longer. William dissolved Parliament, and increased the Tory element in his ministry.\n\nThe House of Commons elected in March, 1690, was less Whig than the Convention; it accepted from the Crown an Act of Grace pardoning all save a few supporters of James. This Parliament lasted till October, 1695, and during its life the Tory party accepted the Revolution, and came to represent closely the ideas, prejudices and fears of an insular[Pg 19] countryside. Dislike of moneyed and manufacturing interests and of dissent, suspicion of the Court's power to bribe members of Parliament with office, hatred of a standing army, the belief that all wealth came from the land, love for the Church, fondness for country sports and rustic paternalism—these were the chief articles in the Tory creed, at bottom more social than political. In many it was based mainly on fear and dislike, but in some it rose to genuine passion for England's past and a love of the ancient order; it was instinctive more than philosophical. Naturally such a party frequently disobeyed its leaders.\n\nAgainst it stood the Whigs, weaker numerically but better drilled. They saw the world changing, finance growing in importance, they believed in toleration for Nonconformists, since these were amongst their strongest supporters, and they were not so distrustful of a court that they hoped to control. They feared the army less than did the Tories and admitted its necessity. The Tories often forgot Europe, the Whigs England; they seldom allowed for the grievances of a landed interest on whom taxation bore heavily. They disliked democracy, but at rare intervals party war forced them towards it. When at the end of William's reign a Tory House of[Pg 20] Commons stood against King and electorate, the Whigs claimed that Parliament was but a trustee of the people's rights. With a Whig majority this idea vanished, but the constitutional programme of each party shows the Whigs nearer than their opponents to modern British ideas of government. The Tories wanted a Place Act, to prevent any member of the Commons holding office under the Crown. This would have diminished Government influence in the Lower House and made more irresponsible the most powerful body in the country; it would have left members of Parliament free to criticise the Ministry without the restraint imposed by the prospect of having to put their views to the test. The Whig demand was for a Triennial Act—no Parliament to last for more than three years. Toryism had more sense of the past than Whiggery, and probably the more genuine religion, but it was blinder to the future. Though one party shaded into its rival through a centre block of fluctuating opinion, each was intolerant of the other and aimed at its destruction, not at temporary victory only. The idea that a country's oscillation between parties would help to keep politics pure and ideals fresh had not arisen. Nearly all men thought their opponents a dangerous faction,[Pg 21] and such as belonged to no party held this true of both.\n\nProminent men were often vague or neutral in their party views. Clarendon and Rochester, Mary's uncles, were more Jacobite than Tory, dissatisfied with the Revolution and distrusted by the Court; Nottingham was industrious and honest, a consistent defender of the Church, loyal to William, whose rights he doubted, a Tory but a Churchman first. Danby, now Marquis of Caermarthen, and soon to be Duke of Leeds, was too deeply committed to the Revolution to draw back, too much hated by the Whigs to leave the Tory party that he had built; he worked himself to the bone when in power, sulked when other advice prevailed, was unscrupulous but true to William. Seymour, a violent Tory, carried great weight with the back-benchers: he was more dangerous in opposition than useful in office. On the Whig side, Somers had emerged, Montague was rising. Somers gave an impression of magnanimity and moderation not wholly deserved; he was a fine lawyer and had few enmities, but often put party above national interest. Montague was adroit in finance, overbearing with success, and bore ill the inevitable reversals of political fortune. These two, with Wharton and Russell, the[Pg 22] admiral, were the chiefs of the Whig Junto. Wharton was dissolute and unscrupulous, a political organiser of ability; Russell's personal ethics stood higher, his political consistency not so high, and though his services to the Revolution were great they were amply rewarded and often grudgingly given.\n\nHalifax, the acutest critic of politics in England, was of no party. His tendency to rally to the weaker side and his indecision in office robbed him of the importance that his ability promised. Separated from him and never wholly of any party stood a group of four men, Shrewsbury, Godolphin, Marlborough, Sunderland. Shrewsbury was the most partisan, an accepted Whig, but he hated office, was sensitive to responsibility, and left his party when it began to plunge. Godolphin and Marlborough were nominally Tories, but could work with either side. Godolphin, a skilled financier, proved indispensable to any Ministry. Marlborough, the ablest man in England, was rightly suspected of treachery and was known to be grasping; his serenity and cool judgment were unique, and when the nation's interests and his own coincided his services were invaluable. But for much of the reign he was in disgrace, for his patron Anne waged feud with Mary, and William[Pg 23] distrusted him, Sunderland returned from flight abroad in 1690 the best-hated man in England; for he had betrayed every cause in turn. His cynical insight steadily increased his influence with William, and though he held it safer to work behind the scenes, his hand is visible in many temperate readjustments of policy. These four were ever in close contact, almost a third party by themselves.\n\nMost of these men at one time or another assured James that they bewailed the Revolution and were secretly working in his interest. The fact that despite words they seldom or never did anything to restore the exiled king only palliates their treachery by making it double. In truth constant revolutions are fatal to political morality. When system after system falls in ruins every man of note finds almost overwhelming the temptation to insure life and estates by verbal treason. He must have a friend in each camp, else another reversal will mean certain loss of office, probable forfeiture of lands, perhaps the scaffold. Some stability is necessary for honesty in business or honour in politics. The men of this generation had not been bred to heroism; their political lessons had been learnt after the Restoration.\n\nDuring 1690 and 1691 England achieved[Pg 24] the reconquest of Ireland. William risked a French invasion by sweeping England of troops, and in June, 1690, led a powerful force to Ulster. He caught James's smaller army in retreat and broke it at the Boyne. Dublin fell, and he pressed westward, but was repulsed at Limerick and had to leave his victory half won. Marlborough captured Cork and Kinsale in the autumn, cutting from the Irish the best bases for French support. James hoped to return to London at the head of a French army, for the French won a naval victory off Beachy Head, and the Channel was at their mercy, but they wasted a chance that never recurred. Next year Ginkell stamped out Irish resistance; he swept into Connaught, took Athlone, crushed an Irish army at Aghrim, and at Limerick forced a final surrender. The terms were those of fair amnesty, and William strove to honour them, but the restored Irish Protestant Parliament threw moderation overboard. Catholic Ireland lay crushed and powerless but was not won to loyalty.\n\nFrom 1690 to the peace the war in Flanders moved in a slow rhythm. William went to Holland every spring, and spent the summer on campaign. When the forces had dispersed into winter quarters, he returned to England.[Pg 25] Parliamentary sessions were crowded into the winter months; he never suffered one when he was abroad. His military fortunes improved as the war dragged on and France felt the exhaustion of struggle on four fronts—Flanders, the Rhine, Savoy and Spain. In 1691 the French captured Mons, but failed at LiÃ¨ge. In 1692 they won their greatest success in the Netherlands by taking Namur, and followed this by defeating William at Steinkirk. Next year Luxembourg again beat William at Landen, and late in the year took Charleroi. Despite these defeats a balance had been reached; 1694 was a year of stalemate, but with the allies on the offensive. In 1695 William re-captured Namur and it was clear that the tide had turned; French finance was breaking under the strain. The allied advantage was not pressed in 1696 for two reasons: Montague's reform of the English coinage caused a shortage of cash that paralysed the army, and Savoy made a separate peace with Louis, which freed thirty thousand French for service elsewhere. Peace negotiations, desired by all parties save Spain, the most incapable of the allies, began in May, 1697; in July France and England agreed on terms and the others followed in a few weeks.\n\nThe ebb and flow of war was less clear outside[Pg 26] Flanders. A Jacobite plan for invasion in 1691 was conditional on Louis offering religious toleration in France and on James dismissing his Catholic advisers, and these terms would have wrecked it even had it not been discovered. In 1692 Louis made ready a full-dress expedition, and James launched a declaration that came as near to repentance for his acts as anything he ever penned, but the English and Dutch fleets ruined the French navy off La Hogue. In 1693 the French scattered a huge convoy destined for the Eastern Mediterranean and took part of it. England retaliated in 1694 by effective use of sea-power: she sent her main fleet to the Mediterranean for the first time, and preserved Barcelona from the French. But an attack on Brest was decisively beaten and coastal raids achieved little. The battle fleet remained abroad for nearly two years, maintaining Spanish resistance and holding Savoy to the Alliance. Its pressure stung France in 1696 to an attempted invasion of England, coincident with a Jacobite rising and a plot to murder William, the last so badly framed that men who condemned assassination were brought into the secret, and three of them gave information to the Government.\n\nBy the peace of Ryswick of 1697 Louis[Pg 27] recognised William as king. It was a temporary settlement only, for Louis had been held, not beaten, and he still hoped to dominate Europe. He had lost his English catspaw in 1688, but a prospect opened of a safer though less vigorous satellite in Spain. Her king, Charles II., was childless, feeble-minded, decrepit; when he died Louis could hope to get part of his empire, perhaps even to seat one of his own family on the empty throne. It had three claimants, Austrian, Bavarian, Bourbon. All Europe saw the danger, and William planned to meet it by agreement with France.\n\nThe Partition Treaty of September, 1698, promised Spain and the Indies to the Bavarian claimant, Naples and Guipuscoa to the French Dauphin, Milan to the Austrian candidate. Spain heard of it, and to keep her empire united made the Bavarian prince heir to the whole. But he died of smallpox in February 1699, and all was to do again with the claimants reduced to two. A second Partition Treaty in February, 1700, gave Spain, the Indies and the Netherlands to the Austrian Archduke; and to France, Lorraine, Naples, Sicily, Guipuscoa and some Tuscan ports. Austria rejected this, and asked for more. Parliament knew of neither treaty, and would have[Pg 28] denounced the second, which promised France a Mediterranean predominance thought perilous to English trade. A dangerous constitutional precedent had been given in the first pact, when Somers, the Lord Chancellor, sent sealed powers in blank to William: if ministerial responsibility meant anything, Somers was responsible for a deed of which he was ignorant. Both treaties were the work of William himself, not of his ministers.\n\nThey brought a storm in 1701, but were not its only cause. Relations between Government and Commons were growing more difficult. Parliament was jealous and irresponsible; no man could pledge its action with certainty. The best remedy for the tendency of any assembly to increase its powers is responsibility; the nation holds the Commons to account, and the Commons act through leaders they must follow or replace. But this can work only under certain conditions. It presupposes a confident national sense; rules of fair play binding on all so that a defeated party will not appeal to arms nor a victorious one make its triumph immortal by legislation; as much agreement on means as dispute about ends. The rules that keep party politics from becoming faction had not yet been framed, so when the Commons asserted themselves[Pg 29] it was less to control than to hamper the Government.\n\nCharles II. had weakened opposition by patronage. This was now being systematised but was still incomplete, uncodified, and provoked spasmodic assault. Attacks were made on placemen that if successful would have turned the British Constitution into something more like the American. One Place Bill was beaten in the Lords in 1692, a second vetoed by the Crown in 1694. William resisted other less dubious changes. An attempt to make judges independent of the Crown and dismissable only at Parliament's request failed to get his assent in 1691, for he saw in it an attack on his influence. He vetoed a Triennial Bill in March 1693, against the wishes of his ministers. But next year he accepted it, for he wanted Shrewsbury as Secretary of State, and Shrewsbury made this a condition. At the same time the censorship of the press, which hung by a temporary act, expired not so much from belief in free expression, as because no censor pleased both parties. The result was an increase in pamphlet war and the beginning of newspapers.\n\nAn election in the autumn of 1695, designed to use the popularity won by William's success at Namur, returned a Parliament less docile[Pg 30] than he had hoped. In 1696 lavish grants of Welsh lands to favourites raised a storm: for the first time a king's right to give away Crown property was successfully attacked. Mary had died of smallpox in December, 1694, and her loss was expected to increase friction between court and people. The needs of war and the murder plot of 1696 postponed trouble, but it came on the heels of peace. Parliament wished to cut down drastically forces which had reached nearly 90,000 soldiers and 40,000 seamen. In December, 1697, they fixed the army at about 10,000, with 10,000 sailors, and 3000 marines; this was an issue of country against court on which both parties were agreed. William evaded the full reduction, and kept some 15,000 soldiers in England, with rather more on the Irish establishment. A general election in the summer of 1698 strengthened the opposition. Parliament attacked vigorously, voted an army, besides the Irish establishment (then 12,000 strong), of only 7000 men, none of whom should be foreigners—a direct attack on William's Dutch guards. Partly because he thought peace unstable, partly because, king-like, he resented Parliamentary control of the army, William felt this bitterly, and talked of retiring to Holland. Twice before he had threatened[Pg 31] this, soon after the Revolution and when he was indispensable, but now the threat was vain. He asked for his Dutch guards, but his earlier refusal to suggest a moderate establishment had cost him his chance, and he had to yield.\n\nA second storm soon followed. In 1690 William had promised to consult Parliament before he granted away the lands to be forfeited in Ireland once the rebellion was crushed. The war was over, the debt great, and Parliament thought the sale of these lands would reduce taxation, but large tracts had been alienated by the king. By a clause in a money bill which it was impossible to reject the Commons appointed a commission of inquiry, and in 1700 it reported that William had divided a quarter of a million acres between Albemarle (Keppel) and Portland's son (Bentinck), besides making other large gifts. A Bill was drawn up to resume the lands, and the Commons forced it through the Lords by coupling it to the land tax. Another revolution seemed possible, so high did party feeling run; the Whig Junto was forced from office, and the Government became more Tory than it had been since 1688.\n\nThree deaths in a few months altered the situation. In July, 1700, the Duke of Gloucester, last of Anne's seventeen children, and[Pg 32] after her the only heir to the throne provided by the Bill of Rights, died of smallpox. In November with Charles II. the Spanish Hapsburgs expired. September, 1701, ended the life of James. Spain had to find an immediate, England an ultimate royal house. Parliament easily decided that future kings of England must be Protestant; this ruled out the Pretender and House of Savoy, and made Sophia of Hanover, granddaughter of James I., inevitable. She was seventy, wanted the Crown neither herself nor for her children, and only under pressure withdrew her suggestion that the Pretender would make a better ruler than a German prince. Charles II. of Spain was found to have bequeathed his realms to Philip of Anjou, grandson of Louis, as the one chance of holding them together. Louis accepted the bequest and tore up the Partition Treaty: this meant war with Austria but not necessarily with England, where public opinion preferred a French king for the whole Spanish Empire to such direct aggrandisement of France as the treaty had promised. At this point, with war certain in Europe, William humiliated in England, Parliament was dissolved, and three thousand candidates contested the bitterest election yet known. Victory went to the peace party, the Tories.\n\n[Pg 33]\n\nFrench aggressiveness swung the nation back to William. Louis recognised Philip's conditional claim to the French throne, in violation of earlier pledges. In February, 1701, French troops occupied seven of the fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands, which William hoped to see garrisoned by the Dutch. France claimed a monopoly of non-Spanish trade with the Spanish colonies, and this threatened English prosperity. War feeling grew through the spring of 1701. Parliament was prepared to stand by Holland, but its investigation of diplomatic events since the peace made it rage at the way England's action had been secretly pledged in the partition treaties, and at the Whigs who had then been in power. Somers, Orford (Russell), Halifax (Montague), and Portland, William's chief agent in foreign affairs, were impeached. At the same time the Act of Settlement, which gave the crown after Anne's death to Hanover, was passed by Tory votes. As far as an Act could it slew the former Tory theory of divine right, by ignoring the nearer Stuarts in favour of a remote Protestant. As a price for this the Act made any dismissal of judges depend on Parliament, banished placemen from the Commons, forbade the monarch to leave England without parliamentary approval,[Pg 34] and closed Privy Council and Parliament to all save Englishmen: councillors were individually to sign and be responsible for their decisions.\n\nThe Act touched William in several tender places, but he agreed to it since he lost none of his own powers: it was only to come into force on Anne's death. Had it done so unamended the constitution would be different to-day. The Tory theory, as expressed in it, was that ministerial responsibility was individual, not collective, enforceable by prosecution of the minister, not by defeat of his party. Coupled with a prohibition on royal officials being members of the Commons, this would make a Cabinet as we know it impossible. The years of Anne's reign gave time for second thoughts, and these clauses were repealed.\n\nThe Commons became bellicose slowly, the nation quicker. A petition from Kent, in May, 1701, criticising Parliament for spending its time on prosecuting ex-ministers instead of preparing for war, was treated as a libel, and its presenters jailed. The Lords stood by the impeached peers and acquitted them all. During the summer William made his last effort for peace, but France rejected his proposals. War began in Lombardy, and in August Marlborough negotiated the Grand Alliance with Austria and Holland: a few[Pg 35] days later James II. died, and Louis made one of his worst blunders. He recognised the Pretender, James Edward, as King of England, a flat insult to a country that only a few months before had regulated its succession otherwise, and so made the Tories as ready for war as the Whigs.\n\nWilliam broke off relations with France, dissolved Parliament and obtained a House more amenable than the last. In February, 1702, a fall from his horse broke his collarbone; it was too much for his worn-out body. He sank rapidly; a fortnight after his fall he assented to acts that raised the armed forces of the nation to 80,000 men and attainted the Pretender. Next day, March 8, he died, aged 51, and Marlborough stepped quietly into the direction of affairs. One of William's last wishes had been union with Scotland; that and the defeat of Louis XIV., which had been the chief aim of his life, were to be the greatest achievements of the next reign. France, the most powerful state in Europe, its accepted leader in fashion and thought, seemed likely to become supreme by land, where her chief rival was the disorganised Empire, now an appendage of Austria. But fruitless European struggle was to deflect French energies from sea and colonies, and to leave England dominant in these twin fields.\n\n[Pg 36]\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nVICTORY AND PARTIES\n\nAnne sat more firmly on the throne than William. She owed this not to her brain, but to her sex, family and tastes. She was a devout Anglican and the last Protestant Stuart; most Jacobites saw in her a plausible imitation of a legitimist monarch, and since the alternative was a boy whose claims could wait, they lay quiet. Unlike William, Anne had no international aims, to her England was an end, not a means, and it dimly felt the difference. In politics she was incapable of a judgment that did not turn on her liking or distaste for the sponsor of a cause, so she left foreign policy, which could not be determined in this way, to her ministers and kept Church patronage for her particular sphere. She was stupid, obstinate, lavish with confidence once given and reluctant to recall it, but never a complete tool of her favourites—the Duchess of Marlborough at the beginning, Mrs. Masham at the end of her reign. Her prejudices[Pg 37] frequently coincided with the nation's and increased her popularity. She had three chief aims, to be Queen, to favour the Church's right wing, to give her husband, Prince George of Denmark, offices he was incompetent to fill. More troublesome to her ministers than Anne's wifely devotion was her refusal, like Elizabeth's, to contemplate her successor; she would have no Hanoverian visit England nor any Jacobite mention her half-brother's claims.\n\nThe reign saw a succession of victories such as England had never known, the formation of Great Britain, and a rising party warfare that reached its climax just before Anne's death. The nation was Tory at heart, though for a time the Whigs prevailed through their discipline and whole-hearted support of the war. Behind the Tories stood the rank and file of the clergy, with enormous though often latent power, increasingly vocal, intolerant, and hating a Presbyterian even more than a Roman Catholic. The Whigs drew support from the power of money, for a time from moderate Tories, also from the slow and un-remarked tendency of the time, which gradually undermined the extreme Tory position. With free printing, men of letters became a power no Government could neglect; Addison and Steele wrote for the Whigs, Swift for[Pg 38] the Tories, Defoe on behalf of moderation. Party coloured everything, the coffee-houses, literary and dining clubs, commissions in the forces, theology. But despite its fury a softening of manners had begun, fallen ministers went less in fear of their lives than before, and the ablest controversialists found sarcasm a better weapon than mere abuse.\n\nOn William's death Marlborough became generalissimo and virtual Prime Minister. He and Godolphin, the Lord Treasurer, began one of the most effective partnerships of history. They put the war above party triumph, and drew support first from the Tories, their own party, who gained a majority in the election of 1702, then from the moderates of either side, finally from the Whigs alone. Marlborough saw to diplomacy and strategy, Godolphin to finance and control of Parliament. Their partnership lasted for eight years, in which Scotland was brought into Union and Bourbon ascendancy over Europe permanently destroyed.\n\nFrance seemed a more dangerous enemy than in the last war. Then her only foreign help came from Turkey, now she had the Spanish dominions and Bavaria in alliance, with Hungary ready to flare into revolt behind the Emperor. Flanders, where William and[Pg 39] Luxembourg had manœuvred indecisively, was in her hands. But her position was weaker than appeared. Spain was little more helpful as an ally than dangerous as an enemy, vulnerable and as much a drain as a support. England's military tradition, begun by the Ironsides, had revived under William, and her troops were no longer the undisciplined recruits of 1689. Marlborough and Eugene stood far above their opponents: Marlborough's chance had come late, for he was fifty-two—Napoleon's age at death—but he had a triumphant genius for war, where he was a Shakespeare opposed by mediocrity. Besides commanding the chief allied army he set the main lines of naval strategy.\n\nHis designs were to clear Flanders and make Holland secure, to use naval pressure on south France, and, with Austria and Savoy furnishing the army, to encompass and destroy Toulon. The first he achieved himself; Rooke's capture of Gibraltar in 1704 and Stanhope's of Minorca in 1708 made the second possible, but the third depended on allies who failed at the critical moments. Marlborough agreed with the Whigs, that England was in the war as a principal, and must seek a joint victory. When Holland and Austria began to weaken under the strain, England increased[Pg 40] her own effort, and was able to do this because after 1704 her fleets rode the sea unchallenged. But the heavier burden stimulated Tory opposition, present from the beginning, and was only made endurable by constant victory. The Tories held more and more forcibly that England should confine herself to naval and colonial war, leaving land campaigns to Continental states. They feared that growth of the army might menace the nation's freedom.\n\nIn 1702 Marlborough took LiÃ¨ge, and twice would have wrecked a French army but that the Dutch vetoed a battle. Next year, though Marlborough won the valley of the Meuse, things went badly. Austria had to evacuate Italy, Vienna was threatened by a Franco-Bavarian attack. English dissensions were growing, the extreme Tories, under Rochester, Nottingham and Seymour, wished to limit war liability, to expel all Whigs from county lieutenancies and commissions of the peace, and to drive Dissenters from public life. Many of these took the sacramental test but regularly attended their own chapels; high Churchmen thought impious this natural result of turning a sacrament into a civil qualification, and pressed a Bill to fine and eject any official who went to a Nonconformist[Pg 41] service. \"Occasional Conformity\" had been a cry in the election of 1702, and to destroy it remained a fixed point in Tory policy through the reign. But to pass the Bill would dry up dissenting subscriptions to Government loans and paralyse the army, so Marlborough connived at its defeat in the Lords, and turned for support to Harley and the moderate Tories. In the spring of 1704 they replaced the extremists in the Ministry.\n\nThat year was the most critical of the war, and the most successful. Marlborough's design was to lead his army to Bavaria and save Austria, while Rooke's fleet contained the French forces in Savoy, Catalonia and Sicily, and threatened Toulon. This proved impossible, but Rooke turned to a scheme first planned by Cromwell, and took the obsolete fortress of Gibraltar; to keep an easy conquest he fought an indecisive naval action off Malaga. Meanwhile Marlborough's own campaign, secretly prepared for months, moved perfectly. The Dutch agreed that he might go to the Moselle, from there he struck up the Rhine, marched two hundred and fifty miles to the Danube, and reached it with his army in perfect condition. He destroyed the Bavarian forces at DonauwÃ¶rth in June, in August, and with Eugene's help, the French[Pg 42] at Blenheim. By October he was back on the Rhine, Austria safe, Bavaria forced to make peace, the French plans of conquest shattered.\n\nBlenheim beat the Tories as well as Louis. It made the war popular, but they again obstinately attacked Occasional Conformity, and to force the measure through the Lords an extremist section tried to make it part of a money Bill. This split the party and failed. An election in 1705 returned a Whig majority, despite the cry, raised by the clergy, of \"the Church in danger.\" Anne thought this cry a reflection on her orthodoxy, and became less reluctant to see Whigs in power; during the next two years they were admitted to office piecemeal.\n\nA coalition Ministry of moderates had now to face a problem important as the war though less dramatic: the future of Scotland. The Revolution had given the Scottish Parliament powers it had never known, while by establishing Presbyterianism it had broken the close connection between religion and politics on which for over a century Scottish history had pivoted. The clans gradually ceased active resistance, the dominant Lowlands turned part of their attention from politico-theological dispute to material prosperity. Scotland was an independent nation, sharing a joint king[Pg 43] with England; but she had no colonies, no fleet, little commerce; where her interests clashed with England's they were ignored. William never visited her, and his neglect had allowed Stair in 1692 to plan and execute the massacre of Glencoe. Scotland tried oversea expansion, and in 1698 launched an expedition to colonise the isthmus of Panama. This meant war with Spain, England's ally: before Spanish arms and tropical fever the colony failed. England kept her colonial and Indian trade to herself, and Scotland, who had been ready to consider full union, lay almost bankrupt and impotent but for one weapon. The House of Hanover had been promised the English, but not the Scottish, throne. If her Parliament set up a different monarch after Anne's death, England would again have a northern enemy, border war would revive, France might rebuild her traditional alliance with Scotland, and English Jacobites find there a refuge and base for revolt.\n\nIn 1704 the Scottish Parliament forced royal assent to the Act of Security, which left the succession in its own hands. England retaliated with the Aliens Act, a suggestion of union and a threat of trade war if Scotland had not accepted the Hanover line by the end of 1705. Reasonable men in both countries[Pg 44] saw that the union of crowns was inadequate, there must be political amalgamation or a full breach. The problem was soluble because Whigs dominated either Parliament: commissioners were appointed who quickly drafted a treaty. By it Scotland gained her chief desire, access to English markets, also forty-five members in the united House of Commons, and guarantees that her laws and Kirk should continue. Jacobites and Covenanters opposed union, the first because it made a restoration improbable, the second because it tied Scotland to an episcopal nation. But they could not unite, and in 1706 the Bill passed the Scottish Parliament. The chief opposition in England came from Church hatred of Presbyterianism, which at the moment was out of favour. On May 1, 1707, the Union came into force.\n\nThis, the greatest piece of statesmanship of the reign, was popular in neither country. Scottish nationalism was waxing and resented the loss of its political shell. Much support given to the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745 sprang from the feeling that under a Stuart Scotland might regain her separate status. English dislike was more material in origin. There were fewer than a million Scots, poorer than as many Englishmen; they offered no[Pg 45] new market, but competed in trade hitherto jealously guarded. England furnished careers to many Scots, Scotland almost none to Englishmen, and dislike of the clannish northerners reached a high pitch in London during the next sixty years. The forty-five members from the first voted in a block for whatever Government held power: they gained rewards in office and preserved Scottish interests by doing so, but their action disturbed the party balance and made them unpopular with every Opposition. Gradually the Union gained moral strength. Scottish agriculture, shipping, manufacture, developed under the spur of new markets, and nationalism found for itself non-political channels. The proudest Englishmen came to see in the Union a triumph for their system of government, and long wars showed that the nation was stronger than before.\n\nWhile Union was making, war continued victorious. In 1705 Marlborough returned to the Meuse and was again robbed of success by the Dutch commissioners' veto. Next year he won Ramillies, and Flanders from Ostend to Antwerp fell into his hands. 1707 was a year of disappointment, for a plan of invading France simultaneously from north and south failed through Dutch opposition,[Pg 46] Austrian concentration on Naples, and French success near the Rhine. In Spain, where a joint force was operating, the tide turned against the allies and the Austrian claimant lost all but Catalonia, which had solidly declared for him and against French Philip. Incomplete victory helped to open a split in the Ministry that ended in Whig triumph and in one-party cabinets, though these ran counter to the preferences of Anne and of most moderates. Both parties were factious, neither could be trusted to put the country's obvious interests above its own immediate success. But party could not be ignored; coalition ministries replaced open struggle by closet intrigue, nor did they bring the full sense of responsibility needed for parliamentary government.\n\nThe Whigs thought their support of the war justified a larger share of office, while Harley with his personal following worked secretly against them and Godolphin. Early in 1708 the breach came to a head; Marlborough, still indispensable, stuck by Godolphin, and Harley with his followers, St. John and Harcourt, was forced to resign. Apparently it was a victory for \"the great twin brethren,\" actually for the Whigs, now their only support. The Queen accepted a Government that she[Pg 47] disliked, almost solidly Whig and buttressed by an election held in the reaction after a Jacobite attempt to invade Scotland.\n\nMarlborough was ill, but he was victorious at Oudenarde, marched into France and took Lille. No French army could stand against the wizard of victory, and Louis made ample peace offers. He would abandon his grandson in Spain, cede fortresses to Emperor and Dutch, expel the Pretender, renounce any claim to Newfoundland. The original demands of the allies were fully met, but Austria and the Whigs wanted more: France must disarm and with her own troops help to put Austrian Charles on the Spanish throne. Louis refused conditions that would leave him helpless and called on France for a last effort. In August, 1709, Marlborough won a murderous battle at Malplaquet and took Mons; he hoped that another campaign would lay France prostrate.\n\nHe was tired of politics, uneasy in his dependence on the Whigs, and Mrs. Masham had replaced his duchess in Anne's affections. He asked to be made Captain-General for life so as to be above fluctuations. This annoyed Anne and stirred Tory cries that here was a would-be Cromwell. The Ministry followed his blunder by one of its own. The clergy were in growing revolt against a Government[Pg 48] that had guaranteed Presbyterianism in Scotland, welcomed foreign Nonconformists to England, and prolonged a costly war. Non-resistance, which implicitly condemned the Revolution, was being cried higher each year. At the end of 1709 Sacheverell, a noisy parson with small grasp of Christianity and an itch for the public eye, preached and printed an offensive sermon. The Commons voted it a libel, the Cabinet decided to give its author the dignity of impeachment.\n\nOn a long view the decision may have been wise, for it gave the Whig party a chance to record its principles, to justify the Revolution, and to define the right of resistance to Government. But though Sacheverell was condemned to three years' silence, the storm his trial raised brought down the Ministry sooner than was inevitable. There broke out the first of those ebullitions of mob fervour that came at intervals through the century, when the populace went mad for an unworthy martyr or against a fancied oppression. One reason for these furies was that, feeling themselves vaguely aggrieved and powerless to control Parliament, even by the ultimate threat of adverse vote, the people at intervals seized the nearest catch-word and raged against the Government: now it was \"Church[Pg 49] and Dr. Sacheverell,\" later the name of Walpole's Excise or \"Wilkes and Liberty.\"\n\nShrewsbury reappeared in politics after years of retirement and joined Harley, Anne finally broke with the Duchess of Marlborough. Sunderland, Godolphin, Somers, were got rid of between April and September, 1710; Marlborough was still indispensable and there were hopes of winning him. An election, like the others of the reign in that it did not bring but confirmed ministerial changes, left the Whigs hopelessly inferior.\n\nThe Tory party was now firm in the saddle, to remain there for four stormy years. Its numerical strength came from Church prejudice, popular dislike of taxation, instinctive conservatism; its weakness from indiscipline and division. Extremists made a large part of it, but could produce no leadership nor read the political barometer; they were ready to follow any one who offered them strong courses. The leaders of the party, with one or two exceptions, were quondam Whigs or, moderates, men who used, but did not like a party system. Its platform had two main planks; Church and King, and the King should be legitimist. These cries held together under Anne, but when the choice had to be Hanoverian Anglican or Catholic Stuart,[Pg 50] they broke asunder, and the party was rent into Whimsicals and Jacobites.\n\nHarley was the admitted head of the Government. He was a moderate, adroit in managing Court or Parliament, where he had thrice been Speaker, a lover of books, tolerant and an ex-Whig. His weaknesses were drink, unnecessary secrecy, and indecision. Defoe's defence of him states his view of a Ministry's proper tactics, \"their business was to preserve themselves in the Administration where they were,\" not to follow a definite policy. St. John, first Harley's lieutenant, then his rival, had a far different temper. He was thirty-two and the best debater in Parliament, a dissipated free-thinker of great ability, the Alcibiades of English history. Bold measures attracted him, for he had none of that reasoned moderation that was to become during the next century the hall-mark of English statesmanship. He was, indeed, more Latin than British in his views, and certain to quarrel with his leader's inertia.\n\nThe first task and greatest achievement of the Ministry was peace. They invited France to make overtures, in violation of the alliance which forebade separate negotiations; a necessary step if the war were to end, for at no time would all the allies agree that their[Pg 51] aims had been won. In April, 1711, Archduke Charles became ruler of Austria; there was no reason for Britain to insist that he should have Spain also, and so replace a Bourbon by a Hapsburg danger. Despite peace negotiations war continued: an ill-found expedition tried to capture Canada and failed; Marlborough won his last success by penetrating the French lines, though outnumbered, and taking a fortress in sight of the enemy.\n\nPeace preliminaries were signed in September, 1711. When Parliament met in December the Whigs attacked heavily on the ground that no Bourbon must rule Spain. They gained a majority in the Lords by allying with Nottingham, and offering to carry, against their principles, his Bill against Occasional Conformity. The Ministry replied by dismissing Marlborough, accusing him of peculation, and by creating twelve Tory peers; a precedent for the threatened creations of 1832 and 1911.\n\nThe peace conference began at Utrecht in January, 1712, and continued with adjournments for over a year; military operations were not stopped by its meeting. Ormond, the British General, was ordered by St. John not to fight, nor to let his allies know that he would not fight, though the French had[Pg 52] already been informed. The British contingent therefore deserted the allies, who in consequence suffered a reverse. France spun out negotiations till the spring of 1713, when peace was made by all save the Empire. Britain received Acadia and Hudson Bay from the French, from Spain, through her abandonment of Austria's claim to the kingdom, Gibraltar, Minorca, the right to supply slaves and a limited commerce to Spanish America. A trade treaty with France, that would have given Britain a new market, was rejected in Parliament by an alliance of Whig and Tory protectionists. The Peace of Utrecht became at once a prime article of party faith, condemned by all Whigs, but it was a reasonable peace, long overdue, and marred by two points only. The first was the desertion of the allies in the field without notice, the second the abandonment of Catalonia to Philip's vengeance. But the Catalans were a minority for whose independence Britain could not fight indefinitely, and she secured them some paper guarantees. Their would-be king, Charles of Austria, deserted them as completely as did Britain.\n\nThe domestic measures of the Government were more partisan than its foreign policy. A high landed property qualification for English[Pg 53] members of Parliament was imposed in 1711; it lasted till 1858, but was soon found evadable. Occasional Conformity was forbidden, newspapers burdened with a stamp tax. In two particulars the terms of the Scottish Union were somewhat infringed: by restoring private patronage in the Kirk and by imposing a tax on malt. Scotland in consequence demanded separation, and the Whigs from party zeal supported the destruction of their own achievement. Finally, in 1714, the Schism Act gave promise that Nonconformists would soon again be persecuted. They had access neither to public schools nor to universities, so had built an educational system of their own which the Act tried to destroy: it forbade any one to teach without episcopal licence. From closing schools to closing chapels was a short step, but Anne died before it could be taken.\n\nA breach in the Government had opened soon after its formation. All looked to Harley—Earl of Oxford from May, 1711—Whigs and centre Tories for moderation, extremists for measures that would crush Whiggery and Nonconformity together. He satisfied neither and tried to wed irreconcilables. St. John might have been a moderate had he been supreme, but moderation would not help to oust[Pg 54] Oxford, the Lord Treasurer, so he turned to the Tory right wing, left leaderless by Rochester's death in 1711. He had none of their narrow religious faith, little of their affection for the Stuarts, but they were his handiest weapon. Vanity led him to blunder: he asked for an earldom so as to be Harley's equal, instead of relying on his power in the Commons, and he was aggrieved at becoming only Viscount Bolingbroke. He considered the peace to be his work, though in fact it was mainly Oxford's; he won Lady Masham to his side, and fought his leader in Council and Court. For long each was too strong to be driven out, too weak to expel the other.\n\nA Ministry paralysed by their dispute and opposed by a disciplined minority had to face what was then always critical, now trebly so, the impending death of the monarch. A Tory Parliament had in 1701 made Sophia the heiress of Anne, but since then legitimism had grown, and Jacobites had gained strength by abandoning rebellion for politics. Despite the Act of Settlement the question, Sophia or James Edward, seemed open, and in 1713 it replaced the peace as the chief issue, a change which hampered the Government and favoured the Whigs. They were united for Hanover, and had the law on their side. They hoped[Pg 55] for nothing from Anne save her death, so did not mind raising the subject to her most distasteful, her successor. The Ministry dared not take measures on either side, for that would annoy the Queen and break the party. Oxford was no Jacobite, but his hesitation and reluctance to make the extreme Tories still more hostile than they were, stopped his boldly outbidding the Whigs at Hanover, while Bolingbroke's associates and actions belied any overtures he could make there. Both he and Oxford were deep in intrigues with the Pretender's court, though they had emissaries at Hanover as well.\n\nHad the Pretender turned Protestant, most Tories might have declared for him, but he steadily refused to simulate conversion, and the Church party could not unite for a papist. So it drifted, paralysed by the hardening division between Jacobite and Whimsical (or Hanoverian) Tories, as well as by the disputes of its leaders. An election of 1713 strengthened the Whigs but left them still a minority. At the end of that year the crisis leapt suddenly nearer, for Anne fell ill, and though she recovered, her death seemed a question of months.\n\nBolingbroke redoubled his attacks on Oxford, and in May, 1714, launched the Schism[Pg 56] Bill to win all Tories from their notoriously tolerant leader, who had himself been bred at a Nonconformist academy. It passed, Parliament was prorogued, and the struggle shifted to the Council, where at last Anne turned against Oxford. He was dismissed on July 27. But Bolingbroke's victory was a Dead Sea apple, for the Queen sank into lethargy and died early on Sunday, August 1.\n\nLater he claimed that, given six weeks of unquestioned power instead of three days (for he lost control even before Anne's death), he would have altered history. His plan, it seems, was not unconditional restoration: he cared much less for James Edward than for the Tory party. He would have manned all posts with Tories on whose obedience he could rely, so that he could swing the nation by a word. A free-thinker himself, he never understood the Pretender's religious scruples, and might have baited conversion with a crown. If he chose Hanover, he would do so on his own terms, exacting a pledge from George, heir since Sophia's death in May, 1714, that he would keep the Tory party in office. He might know that a promise would not bind that prince for long, and yet count on his own charm to win the new King in a few months to a party he at first must regard as his enemy.[Pg 57] Even given weeks or months Bolingbroke would probably have failed, for the Tories were too undisciplined to hold the succession in abeyance till their terms were met. The army would have followed Marlborough, an unconditional Hanoverian, the Whigs would have risen in support of the law. Their plans were more complete than Bolingbroke's; on the day Anne died they proclaimed George, and not a sword was drawn against him. The struggle had raised fears high, turned many Tories Jacobite, branded the whole party as enemies of the new dynasty. Now it fell into permanent ruin, for when under George III. a new Tory party again became important, it had neither the creed nor the personnel of the old.\n\n[Pg 58]\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE CENTURY AND THE COMMONS\n\nTill recently it was difficult to appreciate the full sweep and life of the eighteenth century. Either men lamented a vanished world, or more commonly, for every age tends to dislike its predecessor, they revolted against its inequalities, its manners, its restraint of expression. This was not one of the great leaping times of history, when the world makes itself anew, when the ideas and aspirations of a people are crystallised by genius so that we still feel them as we read or look. No single author will show us the best of the century as Dante shows us MediÃ¦valism, Milton Puritanism, or Shakespeare Elizabethan England. We must turn to the writings of more ordinary men, see their pictures, buildings and handicrafts, watch their political ideas at work, before we can understand the time. Then we discover an age of contrasts, but with a central theme running through many of them.\n\n[Pg 59]\n\nOf abstract political speculation it produced little that was new. The seventeenth century had seen a surfeit of theory, and much variety of practice; the eighteenth settled down to the sober task of working a machine already there, and avoided radical changes. It produced in Burke a philosopher of historical continuity: one without desire for change except when convinced that the existing order brought grave injustice; the greatest political thinker of the age, who gave the maxim of its greatest political manager, Walpole, \"Let sleeping dogs lie,\" a solid and reasoned support. Yet if the century brought few new ideas into politics, it completed something like a revolution in the form of political thought. The old method of arguing from Scripture ceased to attract, the modern one of arguing from expediency swept the board. In Bentham it found its most complete disciple, and he, in a static and restrained time, prepared a great outburst of reforming legislation for the next century.\n\nSocial contrasts were violent. In the towns there moved, ready to foam to the top in crises, a drunken, brutal, illiterate mob. Gin was an increasing scourge during the first half of the century; it offered the cheapest[Pg 60] and quickest oblivion. The crowd, drunk or sober, was less good-tempered than most English crowds to-day; ready to burn a house, loot a chapel, or harry a Wesleyan preacher. The law, it felt, was an instrument of the rich for their protection, and riot and robbery roused little widespread condemnation. Highwaymen could ply their business even in London's outskirts, secure in bad roads, the absence of police, and friendly innkeepers. While the poor killed themselves with gin, the rich got fuddled on heady Portuguese wines, cheapened by the terms of alliance of 1703; many politicians died prematurely old, and their potations made gout the typical disease of statesmen.\n\nDespite these excesses, it was generally an age of increasing balance, restraint, criticism. Society could tolerate drunkenness, but it enforced a code of manners none the less. Religion, prose, conduct, were all being formalised. Tired of enthusiasm which had proved itself subversive, and now lingered chiefly among Jacobites, men came to prize restraint above sincerity, ethics above fervent belief. Deism grew stronger and flourished openly, while theology shed much of its dogma. The educated classes arrived at toleration largely by the road of indifference;[Pg 61] the uneducated cherished old animosities against Catholics and Jews, but more from prejudice than conviction. Until Wesley's revival stirred the nation once more, its religious sense cooled rapidly, turning to philosophy among those capable of it, to torpor in the rest.\n\nLetters flourished, but not in the form perfected earlier, the lyric; the century's best work was done in prose. The balance and neatness of the rhymed couplet appealed to the time, and this measure was made to carry thoughts that before or since would not have been forced into verse. It was an admirable instrument for satire and epigram, but less successful in conveying emotion, and the beat of a single metre conventionalised its epithets. The age left a more enduring mark in the novel and the essay. It has been held a prosaic time, but it produced in Robinson Crusoe a plain romance of detail piled on detail that still bewitches the schoolroom, in Gibbon England's greatest historian, in Burke perhaps her first writer of prose. Defoe, Fielding, Smollett, Richardson, started the English novel on its path. The essayists make less appeal to us now, for their balance and poise have neither the raciness of the seventeenth century nor the individuality[Pg 62] prized to-day, but they brought their form to perfection within the limits allowed by their taste.\n\nThe savage penal law, the loose morals at both ends of society, the self-satisfied lassitude of Universities that did little for learning or education, the increasingly systematic corruption of politics, once made the century's progress towards softer manners and greater honesty neglected, now in turn themselves tend to be overlooked. Savage sports like bull-baiting still drew an audience, but there were more innocent amusements. Thousands flocked to Handel's Oratorios, as was natural in a country that less than a century before had been the most musical in Europe. Gay's Beggar's Opera wedded satire to harmony, and was as popular when written as now. The public conscience was wakening, if slowly. Oglethorpe, a politician and soldier, spent the best years of his life founding a pauper colony in Georgia, and was only the most prominent of those who devoted themselves to intelligent philanthropy. A prosperous and restrained middle class grew up from the professions and trade, and gradually modified the balance of power in the State. Evidence of their rise is to be seen in the new rush for sun and health: Weymouth[Pg 63] and Scarborough became England's first sea-side resorts; Bath, Epsom, Tunbridge and Cheltenham rose to fame for their waters.\n\nThe contrasts of the time were more superficial than its unity. Never since the Reformation had the nation been so agreed on ideals and principles as now. The political tenets of 1688, codified by Locke, were accepted as the basis of free government by men of all parties, and there was little disagreement on fundamentals. In both art and politics the canons were thought to be universal and binding. This, it might be thought, makes the age a dull one, but it is not so. Those epochs when the world is breaking ground in new values, throwing out a hundred ideas, trying novel forms each of which is left for another before it has been developed, have their thrill, but so, too, has a time of digestion. When society, agreed on theories that satisfy its conscience and brain, devotes itself not to the discovery of new doctrines, but to applying its maxims to changing facts, there comes in history a rich pause, a time of leisure that is not vegetable. Men walk at home in a sane and orderly world; they are free because of their certainty, unhastening because their views must (they think) triumph since they are so reasonable.[Pg 64] The art of such a period will be poised and balanced, but not weak. Such a time was the eighteenth century; its thinking not always profound, but honest, its activity orderly but intense. The comfortable crafts of architecture, furniture, painting and china flourished on agreed conventions. In Wedgwood's pottery, Chippendale's furniture, Reynolds' portraits, there is the glow of harnessed fire.\n\nNone could claim that the age did not produce bad work, and much of it. Wild tales of horror flourished near its end, flamboyant decoration throughout. With this, as with other periods, only when its best themes are built into its arts do these still move us. Then we find here not the sweeping imagination of the Elizabethans, but restraint and serenity. If a century is to take pride of place by its best, this can hold its own in philosophy, painting, architecture, and is near supremacy in eloquence and the handicrafts. Its achievements are highest, in fact, as they approach the business of daily life.\n\nIt was a time of good talk, from Arbuthnot, the wittiest Tory of Anne's reign, to Johnson, the sanest subject of George III. He shares with Pepys the distinction of being the best-known Englishman of all time, and is[Pg 65] probably unrivalled as the best loved. His luminous honesty and encyclopÃ¦dic reading made him almost a literary dictator, but he lives less through his writings than by his actions and words. From him we derive an impression of the century in one way misleading; though he went nearly every year into the country, and often far afield, he had an urban soul and was at his best in or near London. This was not typical of the period, London was a great city, with near a million inhabitants when Johnson lived, but the heart of the nation was still rustic. Not only were the smaller towns—Norwich, Lichfield, Bristol—real centres of thought and society, but though politics and fashion drew rich men to the capital, most of them spent much of the year on their country estates, and many gave their best attention to sport and agriculture.\n\nTo the man of means and position, the century offered a fuller life than has any time since. He could be moderately secure of a seat in Parliament, did he desire it ardently, and politics might open any door. His estates repaid care; he could farm and breed scientifically, multiplying his own income and at the same time enriching the nation. If he wanted military glory, wars were[Pg 66] frequent enough; if he cared for art, the spoils of Italy were open to his purse, the first great English school ready for his commissions. He could game, hunt, read, talk and write, sure of companionship and audience. It was an intense life, and most men of note lived intensely. Burgoyne was a good soldier, a politician and a fashionable playwright; Chatham bred cattle and planned landscapes in the intervals of politics. Nearly every admiral save Nelson, and many generals, sat in Parliament, and when peace ended one activity they turned to another. Country-house libraries show that the intelligent squires of the day both bought books and read them.\n\nIt is true that only a few knew the best the age could offer. Those born in the circle, or who made their way into it by trade, political success, genius in some art—these could taste freedom, choose their activities, turn from house-building to picture-collecting, from war to letters; they could fight, enjoy, govern. Men without means or opportunity could but live, marry and die; march to their superiors' orders, find in gin or law-breaking a temporary freedom and rapid end. But this, in some measure, is true of most times and places: social contrasts were no[Pg 67] more pronounced under the Georges than under Victoria. Despite formal manners, and largely because of the recognised system of classes, there was much free intercourse between man and man, for the gulf was so clear that no one, encouraged by familiarity, would try to cross it. We find a country vicar who goes rabbiting with his servants and then dines with the squire, a village tradesman who is made drunk by the parson one day, preached at by him the next.\n\nIn politics a great part of the nation had no direct voice. But even the unenfranchised took part in elections by processions, cheers and occasional riots, and followed, more closely than we often think, the proceedings of Westminster. Their voices had no formal place in the Constitution, but they could weaken a Government and often stop a Bill. In all classes there beat a proud and conscious nationality, that exulted when France, the national enemy, was humbled. Men accepted the class into which they were born or had risen as a natural phenomenon, knew their place and were satisfied with it, though ready to resent any interference from above or below.\n\nIt is probably in its politics that the eighteenth century is most remote from us. Political writers to-day see the essential[Pg 68] feature of the British constitution in its flexibility. Time has shown it thriving on change, shifting the relative weights of crown, lords, commons, electorate, but persisting none the less, so that no complete breach with the past allows one year to be hailed as the start of a new epoch. It was not in this, but in the opposite constitutional quality that the men of the eighteenth century took pride. They toasted their system not because it was Protean, but because it was, or seemed to be, rigid. It was mixed, not flexible; settled by the wisdom of ages as it ought always to remain. The King had his sphere, to select ministers; within reason he must have wide latitude; he could not keep a Government in power indefinitely, but might give his preference a chance. The Lords were nearly as essential as the Commons and represented the same ideas. Blackstone defines them as an assembly of landowners, the Commons as those landowners who have not seats in the Lords: between such bodies there was small chance of conflict. Freedom was to be found not in democracy, then denounced as the tyranny of the mob, but in balance, and the nation cared more for individual liberty than for strong government. The face of the country altered as population[Pg 69] grew in the north, as manufacturing caught up with agriculture, but most people thought it unwise to recognise these changes in constitutional adjustment: the equipoise might be broken and the Constitution go with it.\n\nWe now consider legislation one chief task of a Government. Every party demands new laws, and appeals to the people on its past record of achievement and promises of new change. It was far different in Hanoverian England, when foreign policy furnished half the problems of a Ministry, and of home policy there was little. The Cabinet's duty was to control patronage, to distribute favours to its supporters, to arouse as little opposition as might be. It was not the State's business to provide schools, nor to control conditions of work. Its task was more limited: defence, diplomacy, order, the use of colonies for British interests, maintenance of such customs duties as seemed to favour the home merchant. Other matters were best left to private enterprise and charity. Parliament was not a machine for altering the nation's life, but for providing the country with government. It had none of the modern rush of work to cope with, and was a theatre for displays of debating skill rather than a house for the rapid transaction of business.\n\n[Pg 70]\n\nThat Parliament made no attempt to represent the people numerically was admitted, but an age that did not hold democratic dogmas thought none the worse of it. The House of Commons had 558 members, of whom 45 sat for Scotland and 24 for Welsh constituencies. Of the 489 English members, 82 represented 41 counties, 4 the two universities, the remaining 403 were sent by 203 boroughs. The Scottish members supported every Government; they represented a tiny electorate (in 1815 only 3,625 out of some two million inhabitants of the country), and were generally mere voting machines. Wales was rather more liberal, rather less important, its electorate was larger and fairly honest, but its members had smaller influence than the Scottish, because they were not a united cohort. It was to the English members that Government and Opposition appealed, for there only could a majority of the whole house be found.\n\nIn the English counties the franchise was uniform, fixed in 1430 at freehold land worth forty shillings a year, widened by custom so as to include schoolmasters, parsons, pew-holders, and owners of rent-charges or mortgages. This electorate was of fair size, and it might be thought that here the voice of[Pg 71] the people would prevail. But in most counties some family or alliance of families was too strong to be challenged, and these divided the representation between themselves. They could be fought only at ruinous cost, for the poll could be kept open for fifteen days if one voter an hour were produced, and the voters' expenses to the county town and back was often high. In 1803 a contest between three candidates for the two Yorkshire seats cost nearly half a million pounds, and it was natural that the powerful local families were seldom opposed.\n\nThe 203 boroughs provided more frequent contests, and were the heart of the system. In them the franchise varied from place to place, fixed by accident, precedent, or local struggle for supremacy, and in most of them crystallised by decision of the House of Commons, who from 1604 to 1770 decided disputed returns. Some forty boroughs had their members returned by their corporations, generally co-opting bodies; such towns frequently sold their seats to the Government or to some magnate, but were not always docile. In about eighty boroughs the freemen were the electorate, often honorary and non-resident freemen were included; frequently the corporation could make freemen[Pg 72] and so turn the poll. A freeman franchise varied in width: in 1832 Bristol had 6000 freemen, the City of London nearly 17,000, Rye but 6. Burgage boroughs, where the vote was attached to certain lands and buildings, numbered nearly forty. In a few of them residence was necessary, but not at Old Sarum, where no houses remained, and the tenants of a few ploughed fields returned two members. It was seldom that these places were the absolute property of one owner, for competition to possess such valuable holdings made family bid for them against family.\n\nThere remained over fifty places with a moderately wide franchise, most of them \"scot and lot\" boroughs, their voters the rate-payers. In a dozen any one, not receiving poor relief, who could prove himself possessed of a hearth by coaxing a kettle to boil—\"pot-walloping\"—had the vote. Before an election men could be seen repairing a doorway—for a door was evidence of householding—lighting a fire, spreading a table in public, to prove their electoral qualification. In Preston till 1786, any man who had slept there the night before was a voter, after 1786 any resident for six months. Some of these boroughs were entirely rotten: Gatton had[Pg 73] but six houses and at one time one elector. They could be corrupt: at Stockbridge the 57 electors were known to have asked Â£60 each for their suffrages. As voting was open, the result of bribery could be ascertained. Westminster, with an electorate that finally reached 17,000, was the most important of \"scot and lot\" boroughs, and became early in the nineteenth century the home of radicalism.\n\nThe cost of elections rose greatly during the eighteenth century and fell again before the Reform Bill as corruption declined. The large freeman boroughs were dearest, for voters were often scattered through England, and had to be gathered by the candidate. Thus to contest Barnstaple where the freemen were mostly non-resident, might cost Â£13,000. The big \"scot and lot\" boroughs were also expensive; in 1788 Townshend spent Â£50,000 in fighting Westminster, after that the parties agreed to divide its representation.\n\nMost members returned by wealthy patrons were allowed by them considerable independence. The absolute sale of seats, regardless of the constituency's preference, was always rare. Very few individuals had more than three or four in their gift—Lord Lonsdale with nine was unique—and they liked to[Pg 74] find men of note to represent them, when their own family could spare a place. An able man with money or influential friends made his way into Parliament more easily than he does now. The system secured a house of skilled debaters, representing the various shades of opinion of a governing class. It could not produce a chamber anxious to reform and reorganise the nation, but few men desired such a body. Apologists claimed that it was truly representative, though not numerically, taking each man as one, but so that no important section of the country was left dumb. Through Westminster and Preston democratic views could be heard, trading interests spoke through many towns, agriculture through others and through the counties. For a society that held itself complete, for a country whose constitution needed only minor adjustments, such a house was well enough.\n\nIt could not deal efficiently with a world of large-scale manufacture, of crowded, growing towns, with a press of change needing constant detailed regulation. Naturally it was conservative, for its members lost by change. But this age, though it wished to be static, produced so many changes that its balance and order began to vanish, its[Pg 75] comfortable paternalism to disappear. What is called the industrial revolution, a change in the methods of production that in some measure has gone on since the dawn of history, gathered increasing speed as the century wore to its end. Beside it moved an agricultural revolution, changes in the production of food; country and town altered at the same time. Farming, indeed, was being revolutionised before England had recognised a future in its factories.\n\nThe seventeenth century had brought England new grasses, new roots, and an interest in science. After Anne's death many landlords took their vocation seriously, some hoping for greater revenue from their estates, some seeing no chance of political success, some from innate energy. Most of England still lay unenclosed: the large fields round a village divided into quarter and half acre strips, and a number of these scattered far and wide making a farm. In one field wheat might grow, in another barley, the third might lie fallow: cattle grazed together on the common or in the meadow when the hay had been cut. Under such conditions no one could breed stock scientifically or cultivate land much better than a sluggish neighbour, whose weeds spread harm in all directions.[Pg 76] A man of enterprise must needs hope to enclose, to replace his scattered roods by a compact fenced farm, where he could grow his own choice of crops, rear his own beasts, and no longer march at the pace of the slowest.\n\nEnclosure, a re-shuffling of holdings to save time and labour, did not necessarily harm any one. But an Act of Parliament was necessary to give it full legal sanction, and Acts were costly. Inevitably a House of Commons composed of landed gentlemen looked first to the needs of the squire; naturally he gained most by enclosure. Account was taken only of those with legal right to land: any who had squatted without title could claim no compensation. The new farms had to be fenced: a small man could seldom afford this, and must sell his fields for what the squire would give. The lord of the manor often claimed and frequently secured the whole or most of the common for himself, and so a small holder lost his share of pasture. Finally, the new agriculture paid better when on a fairly large scale. Market-gardening, which now provides a career to the small-holder, had not yet developed. So in the process of a century most, though not all, of the small owners in England disappeared, tenant-farmers increased, for men would pay[Pg 77] a good rent for enclosed land, and the landless labourers became steadily more.\n\nThe change increased enormously England's production of foodstuffs. She was able to remain a wheat-exporting country till late in the century, and her breeds of cattle grew renowned through the world. Some such change there had to be if she was to carry the burden of her wars, and to maintain her increasing population. But the methods of change were often harsh and unjust, those who gained most were already well-to-do, the dignity and independence of the average land worker were reduced. It has been maintained that no man of enterprise suffered, for the new farming and the rising towns gave him better openings than he had before. \"Enterprise\" is an elastic word; to deny it to all hard-working labourers, who felt themselves lost as their world crumbled beneath their feet, is to narrow it unduly.\n\nThe revolution in manufacture started more doubtfully than that in farming but travelled faster at the end. England's chief industry had for long been wool. It could be spun and woven in the home, where a farmer's wife and children supplemented the earnings of his fields. Now inventions increased the rate of production and replaced hand by[Pg 78] water-power; factories set by rivers began to displace home production. Spinning changed first, then weaving; finally steam replaced water as the source of power. Gloucestershire and Norfolk, where wool manufacture had thriven, gave way to Yorkshire. Meanwhile cotton, for long thought a dangerous enemy to the nation's woollen riches, made its way through public favour, and passed wool in importance: it centred itself in Lancashire by Pennine streams. Coal-mining increased, first for smelting iron, and then to raise steam. Factories and mines needed labour, and took it where possible: workhouse children made one source of supply, Irish immigrants another.\n\nBy the time that England was equipping itself with modern roads—that is, by about 1780—unregulated child labour had become a regular part of the industrial machine. It was not thought a duty of the State to prevent children being misused, men underpaid, women worked for hours incredible to-day. There were many good employers, but the pace was perforce set largely by their bad competitors. Only after Waterloo, in the slump following the war, did the evils of the new order become fully apparent. The nation had won industrial supremacy, its exports went to all continents,[Pg 79] its collective wealth was greater than ever before. It had bred more mechanical genius than the world had yet seen, and was on the road to perhaps its greatest material achievement in the railway. All this had been won at a cost. Health, beauty, individual workmanship, had suffered, and the seeds of class hatred were in the ground.\n\nYet a word of caution is necessary. The idea, which lingers in many histories, that industrialism had replaced a golden time, is unsound. Conditions of life in London steadily improved after 1750: it was in the northern towns where a new population was hived that they lagged behind. By 1830 the public conscience had awakened sufficiently to examine and dislike the results of uncontrolled industrialism, though not enough to prevent them. From its inquiries we know the horrors of the early nineteenth century, and find it hard to believe the truth, that they were in many ways no worse, in some much better, than those which had gone before.\n\nThe eighteenth century is not a rigid unit. Many of its chief characteristics began before it, and lingered after its end. Politically and socially it can be held to run from 1714 to 1830, constitutionally from 1688 to 1832. The century was one of growth and change[Pg 80] for all its static ideas, and it was broken in its middle by a double revolution as decisive as those already described, though less obvious. Wesley in religion, the elder Pitt in politics, brought a renewal of enthusiasm and started forces that far outlived them. From Wesley's revival there sprang modern Nonconformity, an evangelical stirring inside the Church, and at last, partly in reaction from evangelicalism in the Church and liberalism in the State, the Oxford Movement. Pitt was the first politician since 1688 to look beyond Parliament for support, and to be strong in the Commons mainly because of his popularity outside. \"Walpole,\" said Dr. Johnson, \"was a minister given by the King to the people: Pitt was a minister given by the people to the King.\" His example and his appeal helped to break down political corruption and to destroy the ascendancy of a class. A man brought up in the early part of the century would, if moved to the later half, have felt himself at home in its buildings, its books, its art, but the spirit that was moving in public and private life might have seemed to him strange indeed.\n\n[Pg 81]\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE AGE OF WALPOLE\n\nHalf a century and two reigns had to pass before the Hanoverians won popularity in England. They were foreigners of bad manners and, for three generations, of loose morals, obstinate and plain-spoken, with none of the intermittent grace that gave the feckless Stuarts a devoted following. By a family tradition that lasted a hundred years each son of the new house quarrelled in turn with his father: George II. with George I.; Frederick, Prince of Wales, with George II.; finally George IV with George III. They retained the throne because Britain needed them, and because they had certain qualities of survival value. They shared the nation's religion, they could bow to the times; never having known the Crown at its height of power, they did not hanker after lost prerogatives. They had a blunt sort of honesty and the wit to trust themselves to expert advisers. The first two Georges were never[Pg 82] the puppet kings that legend sometimes makes them, for they had strong prejudices and no adviser could sway them at will. But their heart was in Hanover, and they did not seek to control all details of Britain's government. This was especially true of George I., fifty-four at his accession, and without personal friends in England. He never learnt English, and as German was a rare accomplishment of politicians, he had to carry on business in French or dog Latin: with such means autocracy is impossible. Like William III. he spent his summers abroad, which favoured the ascendancy of ministers. Another cause working the same way was that now, for the first time since 1688, the monarch did not aim at a balance of parties in the Cabinet. He relied only on the Whigs, so party ministries came into fashion, and proved stronger than the coalitions hitherto favoured.\n\nThe policy of the Whigs was simple: to label the Tories Jacobites, to develop their own electoral machinery so that a defeat at the polls was impossible, to avoid rousing the latent animosity of the Church, and abroad to maintain the peace they had condemned until quiet and prosperity should let the Hanoverian line take root. A new[Pg 83] dynasty can fortify itself by foreign conquest or by sitting still: Henry V. tried the first method, and it broke in his son's hands; Henry VII. and James I. took the less showy but safer course. The Whigs were of their mind, and he of them who saw clearest, Walpole, more strongly than any. Their power rested on three pillars: Crown, great lords, trading interests; against them were a majority of the English squires and the Church. Peace would strengthen trade and weaken the gentry's chief grievance by lowering the land tax.\n\nLeadership of the Whig party passed rapidly to a young group who had learnt politics under Anne. Wharton and Halifax died in 1715, Somers next year, and two paralytic strokes in 1716 left Marlborough only a name. The new men were Townshend, Sunderland, Walpole and Stanhope. Stanhope, a soldier, scholar, and diplomatist, was their chief, though Townshend had nominally the higher position. Walpole, Townshend's brother-in-law, was not at first in the Cabinet, but became Chancellor of the Exchequer and first Lord of the Treasury in October, 1715, and proved supreme in finance. Sunderland, the son of James II.'s minister, was older in political experience than his fellows, but less[Pg 84] full-blooded: a theoretical republican and an honest but bitter Whig.\n\nA party is crushed not by defeat but by division, and despite an election in 1715, when all the powers of Government were extended to secure Whig victory, Toryism might yet have rebuilt itself. The Whigs feared this, and planned to ruin its leaders. A party committee inquired into the negotiations for the Peace of Utrecht, and on its report, in June, 1715, Oxford, Bolingbroke and Ormond were impeached. Bolingbroke had already fled, and in July, when he joined the Pretender, Ormond followed him; they were condemned by Acts of Attainder. Oxford spent two years in the Tower, till his impeachment was dropped in 1717. By that time the Tory disruption had been completed by the Jacobite rising of 1715.\n\nThat rebellion might have had a chance of success had the Pretender's court not been riven by personal jealousies, but it was badly planned, badly led, and deprived of open French support by the death in September of Louis XIV. George, with his two German mistresses and a Hanoverian clique, had been in England long enough to win dislike, which was increased by the prosecution of the Tory leaders. Jacobite mobs and attacks on dissenting[Pg 85] chapels showed the current of opinion. But the Government intelligence was good and their action firm. Stanhope concentrated his forces in the Western counties, where a rising under Ormond was feared; Mar raised James's standard prematurely in Scotland, and by inertia threw away a slim chance of success. The Pretender joined him late in December when all hope was over, sailed again in February 1716, and once back in France dismissed Bolingbroke, his only capable adviser. There is small room for regret that James Edward did not oust the less romantic Georges. He was like enough to his father in character to disprove the legend of his birth, and he had a full measure of James II.'s inability either to learn or to forget.\n\nThe crushing of the rebellion cemented the Whigs in power, and their reprisals were not immoderate. A few half-pay officers were shot as deserters, two peers and twenty-six commoners executed, and a large number of prisoners so lightly guarded that they escaped. Nottingham and his relations, the only Tories in the Government, were dismissed, and the life of Parliament altered from three to seven years. This made for stability at home and in foreign policy, which for long remained a party issue; it also strengthened the House[Pg 86] of Commons against both the Crown and the peerage, but for Parliament to prolong its own life by four years savoured of sharp practice against the electorate.\n\nThe next three years brought schism in the Whig party, Swedish and Spanish attempts to put the Pretender on the throne, and a new system of alliances to keep peace in Europe. Hanover complicated Britain's position. Here were two states independent of each other, one parliamentary, the other autocratic; they were joined only by a single ruler in whose name the wars of either were fought. England and Scotland had been in this position, but their kings had perforce gone the English, not the Scottish road; George I. balanced the interests of Britain and Hanover with remarkable fairness. The Electorate had assisted in spoiling Sweden of her German lands; now Charles XII. was planning their recovery, and to support the Pretender against the British King was his readiest way to coerce the Elector.
