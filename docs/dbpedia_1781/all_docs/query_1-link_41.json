        "text": "Text\n\nThis evening after I receved your LetterFootnote 1 I had a letter brought me dyrected from Douer, by which I only am advertised from the MaiorFootnote 2 of his receipte of the letters which were sent yesterdaye both from my LLs [Lords]Footnote 3 and from my selfe,Footnote 4 and from the Ambassador.Footnote 5 and within a litle tyme afterwardes my l[ord] Cobham sent me certen l[ette]rs dyrected to him from his Livetenant of Douer.Footnote 6 To make a Comment of those letters for myne owne ease I leave it to yow and to gather what you thincke fitt thereof to advertise her ma[jes]tie for that they conteyn variety of intelligence, and in some part a lewde act of him that brought the Ladyes l[etter]rs that were dyrected to Diep out of their waye.Footnote 7 And yett it semeth that at the tyme of the writing of her letters to the Governor of Diep she was in some feare of the ennemye, And for that purpose dyrected hir messenger, both to the ffr[ench] King and to Monsieur Esparnon his brother.Footnote 8 But what was conteyned in these letters I cannot gather. By the letters of the Mayor of Dover you may parceave, that it is likely that the Quene's ma[jes]ties good will wilbe notified to the lady, and to the govarnor of the towne also. And it may be they both wilbe the bolder to Crave some provisions of munitions, and powder, whereof if the Armye be departed they shall have no nede.Footnote 9 And yett we shall have more nede to kepe the same. The greate hast that the LLS [Lords of the Privy Council] made yesterday in the morning shewed a greate difference betwixt their humors and myne\n\n[p. 2] ffor thowghe they were quicke as Marshall men are most commonly, and I slowe (as men in yeares are) yett I used no delaye for the purpose to understand the cause of the perrill. And so to provide remedy this I fynd by your letter, that hir ma[jes]tie misliked not my slownes whareby I am the better confirmed in my opynion.Footnote 10\n\nI wrote to daye to you, that the augmentation of the shipping might staye awhile untill we might see howe the wether would blowe over. ffor if the Officers of the Admiraltie have commandment to prepare the shipping, it will cost hir Majesty one monethes charge by presting rigging and victualling without a sennight service.Footnote 11 The matter yow write of concerning the answar to be made by Locke is very picquantFootnote 12 for difficulties on both sides. Wherein the Rule of Christian Philosophie consisteth in difference betwixt Utile, and Honestum. And yett utile incertum, and yett Honestum certum. But if Honestum were reciproche it were to be preferred to with more Constancye. In private mens causes Cretisare cum Cretensi is allowable.Footnote 13 Thus yow see how I beginne to wander before I dare affirme any thinge. If my hand were free from payne I would not commytt thus muche to any other man's hand.Footnote 14 And yett yow may impart my woordes to hir Majesty, without offence.\n\nI pray yow require Mr. Woolley to send me my l[ord] Scropes l[ette]rs, and knowe of him what answer I may make to Sir Thomas Wilsone who doth only attend here to knowe hir ma[jes]ties pleasure, being verie unwilling to enter into the charge, except there were a Governour in the towne to beare the Brunte of the charge which the late Marshall did and with which charge, Sir Robert Constable was beggard.Footnote 15 ffor the sute of Mr. Nowell in my next I will gett meanes to advartise yow.Footnote 16\n\n[In Burghley's hand]\n\nI have sondry offers to ease me of my torment in my head, which the offerors conceave to come of the quicksilver, and therfor to gyve me the tyncture of Gold, my nightly paynes ar so grevous as I am redy to receave any offer, and yet with feare for offendynge of hir Ma[jes]tie, if I shold therby empayre [page torn*] helth, contrary to hir carefull advise, and yet [page torn**] will not be hasty therein, but will preserve, [page torn***] the advise of hir ma[jes]tie may have sone secret [page torn] from God hir head, and my director to ser[page torn****] for hym. Yow se that my hand now parrets my hart withowt excuse.\n\nFrom my house in Westminster the 21 of May 1593 though I want fete to go to the hall, yet I forbeare not to be occupyed ther, with payne to ease others.\n\nYour lov[ing] father,\n\nW. Burghley\n\n*Possibly ‘my’.\n\n** Possibly ‘I’.\n\n***Possibly blank.\n\n****Possibly completes the word ‘serve’.\n\nText\n\nI have receved your letter written this daye late at nyght and because with it and other writinges which yow sent me, there are many poyntes to be answared. ffor ease of my hand I doe use my Secretarie. And do answere the partes of your letter as they lye inorder. I like well of the Conference yow had with SwynnertonFootnote 52 and CarmarthenFootnote 53 and have perused the articles of agrement, which seeing they both do Allowe, I am gladd therof and in that yow have acquainted hir ma[jes]tie therewith yow have donne well. But yett as you may fynd by my note in the margent to the 2 article. I dowbt of BillingsliesFootnote 54 [Alderman] consent therto or that otherwise hir ma[jes]tie may be a loser. for the explanation of one poynt in Swynnerton's patent I like well yow send for Mr. SollicitorFootnote 55 and informe him of the Clause to be changed by the Quene's warrant, but for the perfetting thereof I thinke it mete that he speake both with Carmarthen and Swynnerton. The 2 poynt of your letter concerneth my former allegorical letter written to yow in which I perceive her ma[jes]tie discouered the literall sence thereof befoer the mydst of it seene. I must confesse that my Cunninge therein was not sufficient to the hide sence from her ma[jes]tie, although I thinke never a ladye besides her nor Decipherer in the Courte would ha[v]e dissolved the figure to have found the sence as hir ma[jes]tie hath done. And where hir ma[jes]tie alloweth of me, that I made my self merrye in verie truth I did it rather to make hir some sport (my self therein not altered no otherwise then hir ma[jes]tie's lute is in hir own hand, that maketh others merry, and contynueth it self as was.) ffor the matters of Ireland I parceave hir ma[jes]tie yesternight ment to heare them this day. And for the questions what somme of money might be reasonablie required I think 5 or 6000 l varie nedefull so as Sir Henry Wallopp be moved to procure payment of the overplus of the Quene's ordinarie Revennue due there above al ordinarye ffees for officers of the Realm payd.Footnote 56\n\n[Margin, in Cecil's hand]\n\nBrittany\n\n[Text continued]\n\nNow to the greatest matter of all theise, concerning the letters from Sir John Norreis written the last of OctoberFootnote 57 which I retorne unto yow dated at Pontrieux and so do I also\n\n[p. 2] now send yow another of his dated the next daye ffollowing at PempoleFootnote 58 [Burghley] which cam to me wih yours, And for the matter conteyned in his former letter and the disposition in hir ma[jes]tie for the safetie of hir Troupes uppon hir opynion of the reach of the Truce.Footnote 59 I am in doubt what to advise to give unto hir Majesty by reason of the diversitie of the dyrections which have bene sent to John Norreis. The last whereof as yow may remember was wherewith hir ma[jes]tie was acquainted.Footnote 60 That considering hir ma[jes]tie was advertised both from the king and from the States of Brittanie,Footnote 61 the Duke's Deputie should come from the States to treate with hir ma[jes]tie for the Contynuacion of hir fforces and Satisfaction for hir charges paste and to come. and that Sir John Norreis desyred privately to come over he was lycenced by hir ma[jes]tie to informe him selfe well of the legations of the deputies and so to come over to give hir ma[jes]tie better information [Burghley] and to leave the troops in Juersy And this was the last dyrection made unto hym to my knowledge. Which might be allowed to contynewe, if there were not nowe matter advertised by Sir John Norreis by this his last letter, wherein he declareth his opynion that notwithstanding the Truce accepted by the Duke Mercury by letters written from the MareschallFootnote 62 unto him he is advised to stand uppon his gard, arguing thereby a doubt whither the Truce would be performed or not. he also writing some reasons which move him to doubt of the performance of the truce for that the Spaniardes have lately dislodged from place to place to come to St. Bryene [‘ryene’ is added above the line in Burghley's hand] and there to Joyn with both the Lorraynners and the FfrenchFootnote 63 which place is but a good dayes march from Pempole. Besides this, he writeth that the Ffrench, which he had procured to lye nere unto him, for his assistance, ar by the Mareschall revoked and disparsed to their garrisons so as it semeth playnlie that whither the truce hold or breake he shalbe in danger by the enemye, in so muche also as I note that he doubteth that when shipping shall come to revoke him and his Troupes whither he shalbe albe to embarke the enemye commingeso [in Burghley's hand] nere unto him\n\n[p. 3] and yet if shipping shall come he offreth to adventure though it cost him deare. and therefore requireth to be no longer delayed with irresolutions, wherewith I am sure he will come with a mynd to charge me with the lack of resolutions and varietie of dyrections, whereof I am sure hir ma[jes]tie will discourage me, and the various accidentes that have happened by the ffr[ench] Kinge's breach of his promises, and reiterations of better observations though not hitherto performed, will iustifye hir ma[jes]ties actions to satisfye Sir John Norries or any other reasonable man. Theise doubtful poyntes hav I gathered out of the letter which yow sent me which make me doubtfull what advise to give, for bringing awaye the Troupes as yow do write to me of hir ma[jes]tie's disposition. And to encrease theies doubtes of myne moving me to enclyne to hir majestie's disposition by his latter letter, which hir Majesty hath not yett seene, I see the intention of the sending of the deputies hither from the States, is as I at the first did coniecture to borrowe money of hir ma[jes]tie which in a paraphrasis, is to Carrye aware money and to leave writinges under seales whereof hir Majesty hath greate plentye, so as the comminge of theise Deputies may be better looked for then wellcome.Footnote 64 And therefore fynding the care which hir Majesty hath for hir people (which is varie princely) and knowing as I thinke my L[ord] Admyrall will confesse how desparate a matter it is to provide a number of hoyes in this wynter tyme, and how longe it wilbe, being too be provided in the Threasurie and how unable they shalbe this wynter tyme to brooke the seas in so long a voiage and yett to shew my disposition how to have the people saved I thinke wilth my Lord Admyrall'sFootnote 65 advise to allowe the same, if 3 or 4 Barkes might be had from South[hamp]ton and Poole for the Coast and be sent to the Yles of Jersey and Gurnsey, which with the help of some smale vesselles belonging to those Ylandes, might safely bring and spede conveniently\n\n[p. 4] all the Quene's people from Pempole to the Ylandes or to some of them the way being short, and so the people might be there in safetie, and at no greater charge to hir ma[jes]tie then they be in Brittanie. And this for the tyme which [Burghley] may serve to two endes. The one to have the people brought away with more safetie [Burghley] hereafter as shipping may be provided hearafter, and so also Sir John Norreis maye with more safetie repaire to hir ma[jes]tie. [In Burghley's hand in the margin] ther ar ii or iii at Southampton that lately and fortunately took the kinge of Spayne's ship of warre. The other may well serve hir ma[jes]tie in honor in not revoking her fforces into England, untill the Deputies might com hither and to be hard what they can saye for the contynuing of hir ma[jes]ties fforces thereof. And for the Contentations of them of Brittanie, Sir John Norries may be dyrected and that at the time when he shalbe ready to come awaye to the Ilandes [Burghley] he may have advertise both the Mareschall and others of the States there, that the cause why he removeth his Troupes from thence to the Ylandes is for that the place where his Troupes are, is not fortified, and that he understandeth [Burghley] yt [clerk] both the Spaniard, Lorayne and French are approaching to St. Briece and that the Mareschall hath Revoked the ffrench, which laye nere unto hym to their garrisons, so that he fyndeth him selfe in smale danger, for him self and the Quene's peoples [Burghley] for which purpose he hath thought [Burghley] now to retyre him self, in some of hir ma[jes]tie's Yles, lying nere to the coast of Brittanie, there to be in some more suertie, untill hir ma[jes]tie may have hard what the deputies of the States have to treat with hir for mayntenance of hir charges, if she shall agree to Contynew hir former promise of greater forces there. By this hir ma[jes]tie may maintayne honour in hir late offer [Burghley] to to suffer [Burghley] revok them untill the coming of the deputies, ffor hereby hir generall doth but retyre them for their suretie where they may be readye hereafter to serve without Cashing of them by sending then home into England. Thus you see I am somewhat long in delivering of my doubtfull opynions, wherein none of the Counsel\n\n[p. 5] can better iudge for their bringing away then my L[ord] Admyrall. And if his L[ordshi]p will make choice of some discrete man by the help of his vice Admyrall in Hampshire and to gett such 3 or 4 nymble Barkes there and [Burghley] that may be the Samsone I am sure if they may be sufred by hir ma[jes]tie's assent to carye each of them but xxtie tonne of beare to be solde at Pempole or in the Ylandes to which places they do use many tymes to steale some smale quantitie without lycence.\n\nIn the 2 letter which I send to yow from Sir John Norreis there is a clause in Ciphre, which I cannot deciphire here readely for lack of my Alphabete which is with my bookes at the Courte which I ghesse be to [Burghley] no other purpose, but to have the Duke Mounpensier the Governor there in favour of the Protestantes of that countrie.Footnote 66 But if my stuff be come from Windsore, yow shall fynd a bigg paper Booke in folio entituled Mattars of France, in which by looking into the table yow shall fynd the Alphabet of Sir John Norreis.Footnote 67 Thus have I at lenght [sic] enough as I thinke answered your whole letter, and the rest of the thinges sent with it.\n\n[Burghley]\n\nI perceave hir Ma[jes]ty looketh for me by the end of the next weke whereuppon yow may saye merely to hir Ma[jes]ty, that am so disposed if God permit me whyther I spede in my vowyng or no for if I do spede, then I may not fayle, but if I spede not by all that wekes pursute, I will trooble my self no more at follwyng here in the conntrey, but will lyve in hope to fynd hir at the Court where I know she will come[,] to serve hir Majesty all the Christmas hollydayes.\n\nGod gyve yow grace. From my howss at Theobalds the 7 of Decembre 1593.\n\nYour loving father,\n\nW. Burghley\n\n[Postscript]\n\nIf hir Majesty mislyk my opinion for the ease of hir Ma[jes]ty, I am no opinionaster but an opyner.\n\nText\n\nI doe send yowe Mr. Guilpin'sFootnote 68 letter and thearewith certaine letters that he maketh mention of to be intercepted: whereof one is written by Holt the JesuitFootnote 69 to Cardinall Allen,Footnote 70 which doth spetially conveie summ his privatt busines, and in sum part his Advertisements of the execucion of Richard Hesketh.Footnote 71 An other longe letter is written from Rich[ard] Hopkins to the Cardinall, conteininge a longe colloquie betwene him and Moodye,Footnote 72 concerninge the letters that weare writtenn hither into Ingland by the said Hopkins to move a tolleracion in Religion by the meanes of the Cardinall: And for that it appeareth their former letter tooke noe effect, which weare sent to Mr. Heneage and so browght to mee. Modye predenteth that he hath an other corse in hand, and looketh to heare owt of Ingland, howe to renewe the former treatie: but what meanes Moody meaneth, or shall use I knowe not, nor by whome, but it semeth he busieth himself muche, and heareby the States have entred into suspicion, that his treatie showld be done with her ma[jes]ties provitie heare, which Guilpin hath vearie honestlie disavowed.Footnote 73 The third l[ette]re is to one BainesFootnote 74 that serveth the Cardinall, conteining noe matter of weight otherwise than commonn Advertisements.\n\nHir ma[jes]tie willed I showld consider whoe weare fitt deputies under the erle of Derbie in Lancashire, and wheare Sir Rich[ard] Sherbourne and Mr. Holland weare his deputies before, I thinke goode to forbeare Sir Rich[ard] Sherbourne, and in his place to appoint Mr. Richard Ashton of Midleton that was sherif the last yeare, a vearye sufficient gentleman and well disposed in Religion and soe is Mr. Holland.Footnote 75 In Cheshire I think theie that before weare named to be the fittest, being Sir John Savadge, and Sir Hugh Cholmeleie:Footnote 76 If her ma[jes]tie like heareof, yowe maie doe well to write to my L[ord] Keper to cawse the commision to be made accordinglye.\n\n[Cecil notes beside the final sentence of the last paragraph in the right margin, but concerning the following paragraph]\n\nFor my l[ord] ChamberlaynFootnote 77 to reade.\n\nWheareas my L[ord] Chamberlaine hath of late written unto mee to further Mr. CraneFootnote 78 to the office of the Comptroller and MusterM[aste]r at Barwick I have thowght good to require yow to knowe my llords opinionn whither he cowld not allowe that Crane might have the office of the clerke of the checke and musters, with the usuall fee which [is] by the yeare and a clarke at 13 7s 8d,1 and 2 servantes at 43s 3d. which in the whole cometh to lxiiiil and yet one Bowier,Footnote 79 whoe is a skilful man in worke ther as his L[ord] knoweth, might be the Comptroller of the Workes, to the which theare belongeth no profitt, but accordinge to the quantitie and charge of the workes, and so to have allowance as the charges of the workes doth amownt: If his L[ordship] showlde allowe of this then theare might be a cople preferred that is Crane, whoe doth well deserve, and so might Bowier also have somme intertainment, whoe is more skilfull in workes that Crane is thowght to be:\n\nBut if his l[ord] shall not like of this devision, than yowe maie tell my L[ord] that I would have yowe to move the Q[ueen] to make the grawnt to Crane of the whole office. And so I praie yowe lett hir ma[jes]tie understand howe necessarie it is to have the office supplied forthwith by reason of the monethlie paiments, and howe fitt the man is havinge alwaies been browght up in the office under Mr. Errington,Footnote 80 & others that have gonn before him. I doe send yowe a paper conteininge the allowance to both thes offices, the better to informe yowe howe to speake thereof with my L[ord] Chamberlaine.\n\n[Burghley's holograph paragraph]\n\nI am not in Tune to wryt my self beyng forced with very Iaynturs to kepe my couch, 23 Jan[uary] 1593.\n\nIn ***** folly I se no poynt of treson intede to the Q[ueen] but a redynes to mak some gayn to the hurt of\n\n[two words carefully scratched out, but two words, probably a proper name, and starting with an “R”. As for whose folly: the name ***** begins with “l” and has a p halfway through—possibly “lopez”?]\n\nW. Burghley\n\nText\n\nI am not in so good healthe as to write with mine owne hande, yet I cannot forbeare to impart unto divers thinges as follweth. Ffirst I praie yowe move hir Majestie from mee to grawnt hir warraunt for sum portion of monie to be sent into Ireland, wheare theare was want at Christmas last, as Sir Henry Wallop can well report, and doth nowe presse mee ernestlie to remember hir ma[jes]tie to send somm treasure thither wehare hir Armie hath had noe monie of longe time, for that the last portion of monie that was sent was at mich[ael]mas, which was £7000 wherof a great part had been borrowed there at Dublin, before it came thither and yowe maie informe hir ma[jes]tie that wheare hir yearelie charges by hir Armie cometh neare hand to £28 or £29,000 sent, so as theare is continuallie a past £20,000 sent, so as theare is continuallie a debt remaining in that land. the sooner hir ma[jes]tie shall grawnt this warrant whiche cannot be lesse than sevenn of eight thowsand pound the better it shall be for hir service there.Footnote 84\n\nI would have yowe informe my l[ord] Admirall that Mr. QuarlesFootnote 85 did demaund a prest of monie for victuells to serve upponn the seas for 8000 men, which came to £16,800 wheare as at the first an Estimat was made for 12000 men, which his L[ord] knoweth was with his likinge reduced to 8000 and after this, yt was thowght good by advise of the officers to make a preparacion to serve for a lesse nomber, which being rated by the officers onelie in fowre thinges, in wheate, malt, oxenn and caske theie thowght it meete to have imprested to him, £4666, which yf his L[ord] shall finde neadefull to be taken in hand I desire his L[ord] would move hir ma[jes]tie to grawnte warrant for that, or somuch as shall please hir.Footnote 86 I doe find that the grawnt of this small quantitie for the Venetians being nozed in the Contries hath raised the price of wheate greatlie.Footnote 87 I doe hearewith send to his L[ord] a letter from Sir Thomas LeightonFootnote 88 , which I thinke concerneth the same matter that yowe tolde me TrowghtonFootnote 89 had written unto him, of which cawse I knowe not. What maie prove to be the event, but for the monie and the Apparell, both which Sir John Norris did expect before he would cumm from Pempole. I am certainlie advartized that the Apparell is alreadie come to him to Pempolle. and for the monie it was readie in the Charles the 18 of Januarye and whether by contrary winde or by negligence of him that had the charge, it came to Portesmouthe of late time, from wheare as I understand by Sir Thomas Sherley,Footnote 90 the Capteine named FranklinFootnote 91 refused to depart, thowgh\n\n[p. 2] he had goode winde untill as he said he would have further awnsweare from my L[ord] Admirall, as I thinke Sir Thomas Sherley made it knowen to his L[ord] and I was bold in his L[ord's] absence to command the captaine by my letters to depart withowt anie further delaie.\n\nBesides this, becawse I understand that Trowghton's victuells would shortlie be spent, I gave order to Sir John Hawkins to send him one monethes victuells more, which I knowe Sir John Hawkins hath alreadye directed to be done, and yet it maie be dowbted that Trowghton finding Sir John Norris to use delaie for his comming awaie, will be also himself come to the coast of England befor the victuells cann cumm unto him which I knowe not howe to remedie.\n\nTheare is also a further proporcion of victuells sent to the Islandes for maintenance of the soldieurs when theie shall come thither, but when all is done that can be, I dowbt it will be founde that Sir John Norris hath noe disposition to cumm owt of Bretaigne. Of all these thinges I praie yowe make my L[ord] Admirall acquainted, and returne me awnsweare from him\n\n[Burghley's hand]\n\nEven now I receaved your l[ette]re wherin yow report hir Ma[jes]ties care for my helth for the which I most humbly thank hir, hopyng that her good wishyngs shall help to retorn me to strength for hir service which I esteme the service of God, whose place she holdeth in erth. that was spoken of my answer that befor dynnar I was no man, and after dynnar half a man was thus far misreported for I sayd befor dynnar I was but on quarter of a man and after dynar half a man and now for some incress to better, by drynkyng of a draught of redd wyne and sugar sence your goyng from me, I make accompt to be iii quarters of a man hole and one quarter syck. thus I am pleased in a phansy to express me estat, wherewith yow may acquaint hir Ma[jes]ty, whan she hath no other matter to hasten to.\n\nI thank hir Ma[jes]ty for hir offer to me of my L[ord] Admyrall's lodgyng but I never had audacite to require other lodgyng than was allowed me. and yet I presume my L[ord] Admyrall, will withowt offence yeld therto.\n\nGod send her Ma[jes]ty a well disposed carnyvall,Footnote 92 or a Carerate to be rid of all cares.\n\nYour loving father,\n\nW. Burghley\n\nText\n\nAt your departure yesterdaie I had noe leisure to deliver sondrie thinges unto yowe, which nowe with thes my letters in a heape I send unto yowe.\n\nFfirst yowe shall receive Mr. Bodelies letter dated the 27th of the last moneth, the contentes wheareof yowe maie at convenient time, or the letter itself showe to hir Majestie, wherein I see he moveth som scruples and dowbtes howe hir ma[jes]tye maie be satisfied.Footnote 206\n\nI send to yowe also a Copie of a letter written owt of Russia by John Merick Agent for the Englishe Companie there,Footnote 207 wheareby he doth advertise a matter of summ weight delivered to him by Boros Federick principall Connsellor to the Emperor of Muscovia, by which it appeareth howe readie the Popes legatFootnote 208 hath been to slawnder hir ma[jes]tie after the accustomed manner of his master the ffather of Lies. And consideringe the discreate descoverye hereof by the Muscovite, and his not accrediting of the untrwethe, It weare well done that the Agent had hir ma[jes]ties letters both to the Emperor, and to Boros FrederickFootnote 209 declarring to themm the untrewthe of this report, and hir ma[jes]ties disposition to have peace for the Emperor of Almaigne. hir ma[jes]tie dare in honor referre hirself to the Emperor of Almaigne to whome hir ma[jes]tie did send an Ambassador expreslie a yere past,Footnote 210 offeringe all the meanes in hir power to reduce the Turk to peace. And of this matter none can better make declaracion, than D[octor] Parkyns whoe in mine opinion weare veary fitt to conceive the two letters to the Emperor of Russia and to Boris Frederick.Footnote 211\n\nI doe also send unto yowe a letter of Archibald dowglas,Footnote 212 whoe also came himself after his letter written in person. by his letter and speeche I finde by him a disposition to doe sum good service for quietnes in Scotland, and perticularlie for the Q[ueen's] ma[jes]tie's satisfaccion. his Negotiation consisteth upponn two partes: The one for the Erle of Angus: the other for the Erle Bothwell.Footnote 213 The grownd of his dealinge proceadeth of a letter from his Nephewe Richard dowglas, which he did shewe mee, and whearof I send yowe a Copie.Footnote 214 The purpose is, wheare the Erle reconciled to the Kinge, and to learne of his confederacie with Huntley, Arroll and others, and if hir ma[jes]tie would intercede for him to the kinge he would discover unto hir\n\n[p. 2] ma[jes]tie sondrie thinges preiuciciall to her State. But yt semeth except he maie have the k[ing's] favor wrowght by hir Majestie, he will not discover his knowledge. The second matter concerninge Bothewell is an offer that one James Dowglas called the L[aird] of Spott, an offender which Bothwell offreth to comm into Ingland, and so to passe into France wheare the Erle Bothwell is, and not onelie to disswade Bothwell from conspiringe with the Spaniard, but to discover all his knolledg of anie attempt against the Q[ueen's] ma[jes]ty, or hir Realme.Footnote 215 And this he offreth to performe, so as his charges be provided for, for his comming and retorninge. Of thes two matters I would yow would informe hir ma[jes]tie and receive hir pleasure.\n\nI send also unto yowe A request of the Merchantes Adventurers to be recommended to Mr. Bodelie and Gilpin, or to one of them, which request consisteth uppon two partes, both vearye necessarie for to be reformed by the States, as by the readinge thereof yowe will perceive.\n\nAnd therefor I praie yowe move it to my Lordes theare that theare letters might be written to Mr. Bodeleie and Mr. Gilpin, accordinge to the request of the Marchauntes.\n\nI have since yor departure fownd A plat of Milford haven,Footnote 216 and also the opinion of my l[ord] of Pembroke,Footnote 217 which was delivered to hir ma[jes]tie uppon hir Messuage sent by yowe unto him, whearein it doth appeare directlye that he misliketh of the fortificacion. whereof I will nowe make no report unto yowe bicawse I perceived yowe had received A copie thereof from his L[ord's] Secretary Mr. Messinger: and yet uppon a second consideracion not knowinge howe the Copie maie agree with the originall I doe send that which I thinke to be the same which was sent by the Erle, for so yowe shall find yt subscribed with his name.\n\n[Burghley adds]\n\nIf I shall not recover my helth, at this tyme, wherein the son is departyng, I shall dispayre to contynew this next wyntar a lyve, or owt of misery, for within 40 howres I shall mak my period of lxxiiii y[ear]s, and what so ever shall be more, shall be by the Judgement of King David labor and toyle.\n\nxiii Sept[ember] 1595\n\nYour loving father,\n\nW. Burghley"
