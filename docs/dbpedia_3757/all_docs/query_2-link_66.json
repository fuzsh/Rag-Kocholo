About PUCL\n\n1. The People’s Union for Civil Liberties (henceforth referred to as PUCL) is one of India’s largest human rights organizations. It was formed in the year 1975 by eminent leaders of India’s freedom struggle like Jayaprakash Narayan, Acharya Kripalani and others. PUCL is not affiliated to any political party. It is an independent, non partisan, non governmental organization. The PUCL as a policy does not accept any funding from any institutions or governments. All the members of PUCL work for the organization on a completely voluntary basis and the PUCL has no paid functionaries. The organization has members from all walks of life including former judges of the high courts in India, senior lawyers, doctors, professors, teachers, engineers, scientists, writers and others. Former national Presidents of PUCL have included distinguished jurists Justice V.M. Tarkunde, former Judge of Bombay High Court, Prof. Rajni Kothari, Emeritus Professor and Mr. Rajinder Sachar, former Chief Justice of Delhi High Court. The present National President and the Complainant in this Petition is a senior Advocate of Andhra Pradesh High Court with over 50 years in the legal profession. Over the last 3 decades the PUCL has led many campaigns against human rights violations and seeking justice for victims of humanitarian crimes.\n\nII. Context in Sri Lanka\n\n2. The resumption of military hostilities between the Sri Lankan army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) from mid-2006 has resulted in grave and serious humanitarian crisis in the northern part of Sri Lanka. The issue of humanitarian crisis that has engulfed Sri Lankan Tamils is not just an issue of ethnic strife and an internal matter of another sovereign country but a matter of concern in all of South Asia in general and in India in particular given the vast number of refugees of Sri Lankan origin who stay in India and the implications of the war on security in the sub-continent and in view of the `responsibility to protect’ doctrine which casts a responsibility on world citizens to intervene in situations of grave humanitarian crisis and widespread human rights violations.\n\nWe are conscious of the fact that several Reports of UN Special Rapporteurs have pointed out to the intransigent stand of the LTTE to comply with humanitarian principles. We believe that all parties to the conflict, including the LTTE, are accountable for human rights violations. However, we equally believe that the responsibility of the Sri Lankan state to respect and act in accordance with internationally recognized human rights norms stands on a higher moral ground with a sense of greater responsibility towards its own citizens as a legitimate government. Hence state action cannot be equated to the actions of non-state players. It is with this basic premise that we address this representation to you.\n\nIII. Artillery and aerial bombing of Civilian Safety Zones\n\n3. On 22nd January, 2009, the Government of Sri Lanka unilaterally declared and demarcated “safe zone” areas and made announcements informing all the civilians caught in the war zone to take refuge in those safe zones, commonly called the `no fire zones’. More than 100,000 to 150,000 Tamil civilians have reportedly taken shelter in these areas on the basis of the assurances given by the Sri Lankan army that the area would be safe for civilians and would not come under artillery attacks. There have been persistent reports that there have been thousands of civilian casualties in the safe zones due to heavy bombing by the army. The Sri Lankan army has continuously denied these reports. However a recent report by the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) which came to light on April 27th confirmed the heavy use of artillery and aerial bombing of civilian safety zone (CSZ) by the Sri Lankan armed forces. This act of aggression against unarmed civilians undoubtedly constitutes `war crimes’ and has to be viewed seriously.\n\nIV. Large Scale Civilian Deaths of Tamils\n\n4. The Statement dated 13th March, 2009 of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms. Navaneetham Pillai ( http://www2.ohchr.org/english/press/newsFrameset-2.htm) points out that between Jan 20th to 7th March, 2009 alone, more than 2800 civilians were killed and more than 7000 persons injured by the Sri Lankan army. Most of these deaths occurred in the no-fire zones where the Sri Lankan government had demarcated safety zones for Tamil civilians to take shelter in.\n\nV. Lack of Food Supplies to the Vanni region\n\n5. The Food Delivery Report for March, 2009 of the United Nations Office of the Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator, Sri Lanka dated 13th March, 2009 disclosed that an estimated population of about 15,000 to 190,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the No-Fire Zone (NFZ) required about 3,000 Metric Tonnes of food stuffs monthly. Against this estimate, the amount of food stuff that was actually made available by the Sri Lankan state amounted to only 150 MTs and 224 MTs in February and March, 2009. The huge shortfall meant that vast population of Tamil civilians has been forced to starve and survive with whatever paltry rations they could access. Though thousands have fled the war zones and have been relocated in camps run by the Sri Lankan army, the shortage of food and other essential commodities continue. According to our information the Sri Lankan government is following a deliberate policy of restricting food supplies thereby leaving thousands of Tamils to suffer hunger and die of starvation and neglect.\n\nVI. Indiscriminate Shelling of Hospitals and Denial of Medical Aid\n\n6. Hospitals have not been spared from bombings by Lankan Security forces. The hospital in Udaiyaarkaddu within the so-called safe zone again came under heavy shelling by the Sri Lanka Army on February 5, 2009. At least 7 civilians were killed and 27 wounded in the close vicinity of the makeshift hospital functioning in a school. 2 ambulances and the medical store of the hospital were completely destroyed. A nurse was killed. On 6th February, 2009 Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) bombers bombed and fully destroyed Ponnampalam Memorial hospital in Puthukkudiyiruppu (PTK), killing scores and wounding many. 61 patients were killed in the air attack. ICRC and Sri Lanka Red Cross Staff were also injured in PTK town. The SLA and SLAF attacks have included 4 attacks on hospitals (3 on PTK and 1 on Udaiyaarkaddu) and 2 attacks on churches Suthanthirapuram & PTK. Both Kilinochchi District and Mullaitivu District General Hospitals have been Displaced\n\n7. The conditions of the injured, sick and infirm are particularly precarious. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) between 19th February and 29th April more than 12,400 injured persons and their relatives were evacuated from the combat zone by ship (http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/sri-lanka-update-300409?opendocument) . However the non-availability of medicines, especially life saving drugs had severely affected hospital services in the no-fire zones. “Given the catastrophic situation of thousands of displaced, sick and wounded people still in the conflict area, the parties must do more to protect them and must allow more food and medicine into the area,” said Monica Zanarelli (http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/sri-lanka-update-300409?opendocument), the ICRC’s deputy head of operations for South Asia. It should be mentioned that the ICRC is amongst the only international relief organisations permitted to work in the war zones and their officials have to use diplomatic language to express their views lest they offend Sri Lankan authorities thereby risking the meager health services they offer to injured, sick and suffering civilians. However her statement describes graphically the grim picture prevailing in the war affected areas.\n\n8. An illustrative list of hospitals which suffered shelling and bombing by the Sri Lankan security forces during the period December 2008 – January 2009 is given in Annexure 1 being submitted with this Representation.\n\nVII. Camps for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) – Virtual Detention Camps\n\n9. There are alarming reports that the camps set up by the Sri Lankan government to house the Tamil civilians constituting Internally Displaced People (IDPs) fleeing the war area are unsafe. It is reported that even before the IDPs are brought to these camps youth are separated from the families and taken away to undisclosed destinations. No records are maintained of the names and numbers of such youth separated from their families and their fate is unknown. A matter of serious concern are allegations of rape and sexual violence inflicted on young girls and women by security and paramilitary forces and the existence of forced prostitution rings in these camps.\n\n10. The camps are over crowded, with thousands forced to live in the open with little or no water and sanitation facilities or privacy areas in the case of women. Food supply and medicines continue to be in short supply.\n\n11. There are growing reports that the safety of the IDPs are compromised by the movement of members of the para military forces and informers made up of former Tamil groups acting as para military outfits working in close connection with the Sri Lankan military. Enforced disappearances, abductions and killings are continuously reported from the IDP camps.\n\nVIII. Prohibition of media reporting\n\n12. The Sri Lankan government has ensured that no independent media persons are allowed access to the war zones or to the camps. Even UN agencies and other aid workers have been barred from visiting or working in the area. As a result there is no independent verification of events occurring in the war zones. Whenever media people are allowed access it is by way of a guided tour of specified areas under the watch of security forces without free access to meet with people and collect information. Thus all information emanating from the war zones are only the official statements of the Sri Lankan government. The outside world has no means to verify the same. Anyone violating the government’s ban is visited with serious life threatening consequences. Ms. Anna Neistat, Senior Emergencies Researcher at Human Rights Watch experienced the harsh response of the government when she was visited the IDP centres without permission and was thereafter blacklisted from entering Sri Lanka.\n\nIX. State of Impunity\n\n13. Apart from the humanitarian crisis prevailing in the war zones in the Vanni region following the outbreak of intensified fighting since January, 2009 marked by large scale death of civilians and allegations of enforced disappearances, `white van’ abductions, killings and sexual abuses in the safety / IDP camps, a general state of impunity and human rights abuse characterises state functioning in Sri Lanka. For the last 2 ½ years the Sri Lankan government has used the pretext of waging a `war against terror’ to set up a vast network of police, para-military and military forces across the entire Island state which today have become institutionalized forces of terror. The Report of the UN Human Rights Council highlights the Statement of the UN Commissioner for Human Rights who pointed out that “while Sri Lanka has many of the elements needed for a strong national protection system, in the context of the armed conflict and of emergency measures taken against terrorism, the weakness of the rule of law and prevalence of impunity is alarming” (Para 20, page 7, “Compilation Prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in accordance with Paragraph 15(B) of the Annex to Human Rights Council Resolution 5/1”, 8th April, 2008.). A much more serious indictment has been made by the UN Special Rapporteur on extra judicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Philip Alston, who has pointed out that extra-judicial executions have increased dramatically which have been accompanied by “efforts to dismantle existing mechanisms to ensure the accountability of security forces for human rights violations. It is tempting to ascribe these trends to the failure of ceasefire and the outbreak of hostilities. But this is at best, only a partial explanation” (Para 9, page 6. Report of the Special Rapporteur on Extra judicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Philip Alston, Addendum, Follow-up to Country Recommendations, 14th May, 2008).\n\n14. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions felt concerned enough to report that the police were engaged in summary executions and that torture was the main cause of deaths in police custody. More importantly he pointed out that the vast number of custodial deaths was caused not by rogue police but by ordinary police officers taking part in established routine.( Para 10, page 6, “Compilation Prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in accordance with Paragraph 15(B) of the Annex to Human Rights Council Resolution 5/1”, 8th April, 2008.) The working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances noted at the end of 2007 that there were 5516 outstanding cases. The working group also pointed out that the increase in reported cases of recent enforced disappearances seem to indicate a “wide spread pattern of disappearances”(Working group, A/HRC/7/2, para.344 referred in para.12, “Compilation Prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in accordance with Paragraph 15(B) of the Annex to Human Rights Council Resolution 5/1”, 8th April, 2008.)\n\n15. We would like to stress here that the state supported architecture of terror is terrorizing not just Sri Lankan Tamils of northern Sri Lanka but also all other Sri Lankans who may be seen as dissenters against the ruling regime or are seeking accountability from it. It may not be out of place here to refer to a letter dated Apr. 28, 2008 signed by 13 civil society organizations (CSOs) of Sri Lanka to the Heads of Nations across the world seeking their support to vote out Sri Lanka from the UN Human Rights Council (Bi-annual elections of Human Rights Council held in May, 2008). The CSOs strikingly pointed out, “the government has permitted National Security concerns to outweigh the protection of fundamental rights, particularly of minorities of Sri Lanka. Emergency regulations currently in force enable arbitrary arrest and long term detention with out indictment, as well as torture. The fact that illegal detentions and torture also take place in cases not related to the conflict, only highlight the deep roots of the current Human Rights crisis” (http://www.cpalanka.org/research_papers civil_society_letter_on_re%20election_of_SL_to_HRC_April%2028.pdf)\n\nX. Killing of Journalists and Media Professionals\n\n16. The present government headed by Mahinda Rajapaksa has systematically targeted the media community to ruthlessly suppress all freedom of expression in the country. The violence unleashed against the media can be gauged by the fact that in the last two and a half years about 20 journalists have been killed and over 35 journalists driven by fear and threat had to flee the country and live in exile. A matter to be noted is that in the killings of journalists, a distinctive feature is the targeting of Tamil journalists, especially those who exposed the human rights abuses of the government. The best known example of the state of terror and impunity is the killing of well known editor of the Sunday Leader, Lasantha Wickramathunge on January 7th, 2009 by a gang in broad daylight as he was traveling in his car from his residence to his office. The killers have still not been apprehended.\n\n17. We attach a list of media workers killed, abducted and arrested between 24th January, 2006 and February, 2009 as an illustration of the state of terror prevailing in Sri Lanka.\n\nXI. List of UN Reports\n\n18. The continuous reign of state terror, state of impunity and massive human rights violations committed by state agencies in Sri Lanka, the systematic dismantling of existing democratic institutions by the Sri Lankan government leading to the ineffectiveness of existing judicial institutions to ensure justice to the victims have been systematically documented by expert bodies of the United Nations itself. The following is a list of some of the reports of UN Rapporteurs.\n\nReport of the UN Special Rapporteur on Extra Judicial Summary or Arbitrary Executions, Philip Alston on his mission to Sri Lanka from 28th November to 6th December, 2005, March 27, 2006 (UN Document: E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.5).\n\nConclusions and Recommendations of the Committee against Torture, Dec 15, 2005 (UN Document: CAT/C/LKA/CO/2).\n\nReport of the UN Special Rapporteur on Extra Judicial Summary or Arbitrary Executions, Philip Alston to the UN Human Rights Council, Sep 19, 2006.\n\nStatement on Sri Lanka from the UN Special Adviser on Children and Armed Conflict in Sri Lanka, Alan Rock, Nov 13, 2006.\n\nConclusions of the Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict in Sri Lanka, June 13, 2007 (UN Document: S/AC.51/2007/9).\n\nReport of the Secretary General on Children in Armed Conflict in Sri Lanka, Dec 21, 2007 (UN Document: S/2007/758).\n\nReport of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, January 10th, 2008 (UN Document: A/HRC/7/2).\n\nReport of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Manfred Nowak, 26th February, 2008 (UN Document: A/ HRC/7/3/Add. 6).\n\nAnnual Reports of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review\n\n(UPR) of the UN Human Rights Council 2007, 2008 and 2009.\n\n19. Apart from the above mentioned UN Reports there are also well documented and detailed reports by respected international human rights organisations like Human Rights Watch, Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development, International Crisis Group and Amnesty International, and Sri Lanka based groups like the University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna), Centre for Policy Alternatives, Colombo and other organisations which provide detailed information about the wide spread prevalence of human rights violations in Sri Lanka.\n\nXII. Response of the Sri Lankan Government – Denial and Abuse\n\n20. The Sri Lankan Government has been exhibiting a remarkably hostile and aggressive response to any complaint of human rights violations committed by any of its forces. Often times the response is not merely one of denial of any wrong doing but characterized by a virulent counter attack on the person or organisation forwarding the complaint as being `terrorists’ themselves or representing the LTTE.\n\nThe Sri Lankan Government has not stopped at launching a vilification campaign against anyone challenging their actions including in inciting violent attacks on the persons concerned. This much is reflected in an open letter written to President Rajapaksa by an International Coalition of International Press Freedom and Human Rights Organisations on 11th April, 2008 which pointed out that “Senior members of the Sri Lankan government and security personnel have made inflammatory comments condemning journalists as traitors, implicitly allowing for the incitement of violence against journalists and media institutions” (http://www.freemediasrilanka.org/English/news.php?id=904&section=news)\n\n21. The Sri Lankan government officials and ministers have never hesitated at calling UN senior Officials themselves as terrorists and terrorist supporters. Foreign diplomats were not spared the personalized verbal assaults on their bona fides and integrity. This type of personalized attack was pointed out by British MPs in a debate on Sri Lanka in the House of Commons on 18th December, 2008.\n\n22. The standard ploy of the Sri Lankan Government denying any questioning of its policies stands exposed in the context of the claim of the number of civilians caught in a shrinking land mass in the Vanni areas since the outbreak of the final assault launched in January, 2009. While the UN agencies consistently pointed out that close to 180000 to 250,000 civilians were trapped in a shrinking land mass, the Sri Lankan government deliberated understated the population as numbering only 70,000 subsequently reduced to 30,000 civilians. This was done to deliberately mislead the world community.\n\nXIII. Responsibility to Protect: Military intervention for human protection\n\n23.It is pertinent to point out that vide para 138 and 139 of the World Summit Outcome Document, 2005 the General Assembly of the United Nations unanimously adopted the `Responsibility to Protect’ Doctrine which recognizes that every individual state has the responsibility to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity which responsibility includes prevention of such crimes, including their incitement, through appropriate and necessary means. Where national authorities have manifestly failed to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity the responsibility to protect the victims of grave humanitarian crimes devolves on the international community through the United Nations, and more particularly through the Security Council and where peaceful means have been inadequate the Security Council is mandated to initiate collective action in a timely and decisive manner in accordance with the UN Charter, including Chapter VII and international law.\n\n24. The conditions warranting military intervention to protect human rights was elaborated in the 2001 Report of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty(http://www.iciss.ca/report2-en.asp) which formed the basis for the adoption by the UN General Assembly of the `Responsibility to Protect’ Doctrine. As the Commission explained, military intervention for human protection purposes is justified in two broad sets of circumstances, namely in order to halt or avert:\n\n large scale loss of life, actual or apprehended, with genocidal intent or not, which is the product either of deliberate state action, or state neglect or inability to act, or a failed state situation; or\n\n large scale “ethnic cleansing,” actual or apprehended, whether carried out by killing, forced expulsion, acts of terror or rape.\n\n25. If either or both of these conditions are satisfied, the “just cause” component of the decision to intervene is amply satisfied. (para 4.19). The Commission also pointed out that the decision to militarily intervene was to be taken only in exceptional circumstances when the violence was of such a scale as to “shock the conscience of mankind” or which present such a clear and present danger to international security, that they require coercive military intervention. (para 4.13).\n\n26. The ethnic war in Sri Lanka has witnessed the deaths of thousands of civilians including women, children and elderly. Grievous injuries have been caused to many thousands more. Bombings of civilians by Sri Lankan Security still continue. There is imminent danger of death to thousands of civilians in the coming days. The survivors face precarious and insecure lives encountering lack of basic amenities as well as constant fear of abductions, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings on grounds of being LTTE suspects. The brutal human rights atrocities such as torture and killing with impunity has shocked the `conscience of the world community’. There is absolutely no sense of security or personal safety of survivors at the hands of the Sri Lankan authorities who are manning the safety camps.\n\n27. The impact of the war in Sri Lanka is not limited to the Island nation alone. The war has caused unrest in South Asian region and poses a serious danger to international security. It can no longer be viewed as an internal problem of the Sri Lankan state. Hence the situation warrants immediate military intervention for human protection.\n\nXIV. Reference to the International Criminal Court for the Prosecution of Sri\n\nLankan authorities for Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes.\n\n28. The PUCL requests the United Nations Security Council to make a reference as per Art. 13(b) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, to investigate and prosecute under the Rome Statute, Chapter VII of the UN Charter and other relevant statutes the following persons:\n\n(i) Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka,\n\n(ii) Gothabaya Rajapaksa, Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order, Government of Sri Lanka, and\n\n(iii) Sarath Fonseka, Army Commander.\n\nfor the commission of crimes against humanity and war crimes as elaborated in Articles 7 and 8 of the Rome Statute of the ICC.\n\n29. It will be pertinent to note that the preamble to the Statute elaborates that the purpose of the Rome Statute is to ensure that the most serious crimes concerned to the international community as a whole must not go unpunished and that there effective prosecution must be ensured by taking measures at the national level and by enhancing international co-operation. The preamble also reaffirms to resolves to guarantee lasting respect for the enforcement of international justice. It is towards these ends and for the sake of the future and present generation an independent permanent international criminal court in relation with the United Nation system has been established with jurisdiction of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole.\n\n30. The PUCL would like to bring to the notice of Security Council that the above mentioned persons are responsible for the commission of crimes against humanity as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against civilian population. The accused are guilty of the following crimes against humanity.\n\ni). Murder; (Art. 7 (1) (a))\n\nii). Extermination; ‘Extermination’ includes the intentional infliction of conditions of life, inter alia the deprivation of access to food and medicine, calculated to bring about the destruction of part of a population; (Art. 7(1) (b)\n\nread with 7 (2) (b))\n\niii).Deportation or forcible transfer of population; ‘Deportation or forcible transfer of population’ means forced displacement of the persons concerned by expulsion or other coercive acts from the area in which they are lawfully present, without grounds permitted under international law; (Art. 7 (1) (d)\n\nread with 7 (2) (d))\n\niv). Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law; (Art. 7 (1) (e))\n\nv). Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender as defined in paragraph 3, or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court; ‘Persecution’ means the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the identity of the group or collectivity; (Art.\n\n7(1) (h) read with 7 (2) (g))\n\nvi). Enforced disappearance of persons; ‘Enforced disappearance of persons’ means the arrest, detention or abduction of persons by, or with the authorization, support or acquiescence of, a State or a political organization, followed by a refusal to acknowledge that deprivation of freedom or to give information on the fate or whereabouts of those persons, with the intention of removing them from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of time.\n\n(Art. 7 (1) (i) read with 7 (2) (i))\n\nvii). Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.\n\n31. The PUCL is conscious of the fact that the State to which the accused belong to, namely, Sri Lanka is not a signatory to the Rome Statute. We are also aware that the State of Sri Lanka has not given a declaration accepting the jurisdiction of the court under Article 12(3) of the Rome Statute. Under these circumstances the only way in which the Sri Lankan state can be made accountable is by a reference by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of United Nations to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. As per Article 13(b) of the Rome Statute such a reference would confer jurisdiction to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to exercise powers conferred by Article 15 and to investigate and prosecute for the crimes referred to in Article 5 of the Rome statute committed by the Sri Lankan state.\n\n32. It is submitted that Article 5 of the Rome Statute provides for the crimes within the jurisdiction of the court. As per this Article the International Criminal Court has jurisdiction with respect to the following crimes:\n\n(a) Crime of genocide (Article 6)\n\n(b) Crimes against humanity (Article 7)\n\n(c) War Crimes (Article 8)\n\n(d) Crimes of Aggression\n\nWe are enclosing along with this representation the following annexures:\n\n(1) The List of Hospitals bombed by the Sri Lankan Army.\n\n(2) List of Media workers killed, abducted and arrested by the Sri Lankan security forces.\n\n(3) List of Persons murdered, abducted or disappeared in the Jaffna region in respect of whom official complaints were lodged with the appropriate authorities and regarding whose cases no action has been taken by the Sri Lankan government till date.\n\nThe information in the annexures coupled with the reports of the various United Nations authorities and other international human rights groups makes out more than a prima facie case of the complicity of the Sri Lankan state in the commission of these crimes.\n\n33. A brief summary of the provisions of Article 8 detailing the elements of `war crimes’ will be useful to establish yet another grave humanitarian crime committed by the Sri Lankan high officials. Article 8.2(c) and (e) covers cases of war crimes in conflicts not of an international character. The following are some of the main elements of war crimes established by the accounts of UN agencies and others:\n\nIntentionally directing attacks against civilian populations as such; Intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion etc. including hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected. (8.2(e)(iv).\n\nXV. An Appeal to the Security Council\n\n34. In view of the grave humanitarian threat to thousands of Tamilian civilians in the northern Vanni area of Sri Lanka, the PUCL urges members of the Security Council to rise above partisan considerations and politics of expediency for geopolitical considerations and give a voice to the suffering victims of the war and a brutal state in Sri Lanka. We remain confident that the vast documentation attesting to the grave humanitarian crisis will persuade all members of the Security Council to unanimously agree to immediate military intervention for human protection thereby saving the lives of thousands of civilians.\n\n35. The PUCL points out that if states are allowed to get away with commission of mass murders of its own people and those guilty of mass humanitarian crimes go unpunished, world citizens will lose all faith in the United Nations and in the rule of law. If brute states are permitted to cover their acts under the cloak of sovereignty and internal affairs, then there is little relevance to international doctrines providing for peace and safety of citizens. As far as victims of state brutality are concerned the United Nations and Security Council should be their protector and not the protector of brute regimes who use the context of their holding power to block any demand for accountability for their crimes.\n\n36. The situation in Sri Lanka is very grave. Thousands live under the constant danger of being bombed to death or dying due to starvation and deprivation of basic medical care. Those who survive have to contend with the spectre of insecure life in government run IDP camps where danger stalks in the form of abductions, disappearances, murders, and sexual assaults.\n\nThe PUCL demands the following:\n\n(i) That the Security Council immediately decide to launch military\n\nintervention for human protection in Sri Lanka under the\n\n`Responsibility to Protect’ Doctrine.\n\n(ii) That the administration of Camps for IDPs should be taken over\n\nand be under the control of UN agencies;\n\n(iii) The Security Council makes a Reference to the Prosecutor of the\n\nInternational Criminal Court for prosecuting Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gothabaya Rajapaksa and Sanath Fonseka of the Government of Sri Lanka for committing crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nIndia: 8th May, 2009 (K.G.
