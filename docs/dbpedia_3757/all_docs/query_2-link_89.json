        "text": "Legend\n\nAn Indian princess from Tamil Nadu Maaruthap Piravaakavalli or Maruthapura Veeravalli got cured of her disease at Keerimalai springs Naguleswaram temple and settle down at Tellippalai for some time. Because of this the place was named as thallipalli. Thalli means young and palli means small village. Over the time the name became Thellipalli. During the time of King Thondaiman in Tamil Nadu, three families with following family names apparently settled down at Tellippalai: Sampaka mappanan, Santhirasekara maappanan and Kanakarayan\n\nHistory since 1658 (Dutch rule)\n\nThe province of Belligamme [Valligamam] has 14 Churches, the chief where-of is Telipole a large structure, with a double row of Pillars; the House thereunto belonging is the work of the Jesuits, beautifyeo with a pleasant Garden, handsome Court and most delicious Vineyards affording most sorts of Indian Fruits, and water’d with several springs . . . Old hand drawn picture given below shows two small hills in the background. The two hills are between Keerimalai and Maviddapuram which are about two kilometers from Tellippalai. The hills may had been visible from Tellippalai during those times.\n\nHistory since 1812\n\nIt was a mission location when the American Ceylon Mission (ACM) came to Sri Lanka in the 19th century. It was known as Tillipally in ACM documents. American Ceylon Mission established number of churches and Christian schools in Jaffna District which provided western education.\n\nThe First English School of Jaffna, which led to Union College, Tellippalai was founded in Dutch Hall in 1816 by the Rev. Daniel Poor and Edward Warren, American citizens. At that time, the bitter consequences of the War of 1812 had soured the feelings of the governor of the British colony of Ceylon, Robert Brownrigg, against all Americans. In 1813 he refused permission for the first batch of American-Ceylon Missionaries of New England to settle in Colombo.\n\nThey were sent to the arid Jaffna peninsula, permitted to occupy only Dutch buildings, and refused permission to proselytize in Jaffna or Point Pedro. Brownrigg also refused them a charter to provide higher education. The Rev. Samuel Newell arrived on 7 September 1813 on the Jaffna peninsula and occupied the Tellippilai Union premises, which at that time consisted of dilapidated and snake-infested structures dating back to the Portuguese of the 16th century.\n\nEdward Warren having a completed two-year course in Medicine and Surgery at Dartmouth Medical School (Geisel School of Medicine), erected a small hospital in Tellippalai.\n\nFirst printing press was established at Tellippallai in 1820 by American Ceylon Mission. Later the press was moved to Manipay, and moved back to Tellippalai again in 1901.\n\nIn 1910 Mahajana College, Tellippalai was founded at Ampanai, Tellippalai by T. A. Thuraiyappapillai.\n\nThe Tellippalai Hospital or Tellippalai base hospital was built in the late 1960s as a replacement for the old hospital in Kankesanthurai\n\nThere are number of old Hindu temples located in the Tellippalai area.\n\nSri Durgadevi Temple of Tellippalai has become one of the most popular places of worship in the last few decades.\n\nSchools\n\nUnion College, Tellippalai\n\nMahajana College, Tellippalai\n\nNotable personalities from Tellippalai\n\nS.

During my visit to the South, I should love to respond to your invitation. But there are many difficulties in the way. If I go to Jaffna, I must go to other places in Ceylon which means quite a few days there. This year I want to devote purely to Khadi work and Khadi collection. If therefore I went to Ceylon, I would want to make Khadi collections. The best thing I can therefore do is to forward your letter to Sjt. C. Rajagopalachariar who is organising the tour in the South and let him decide. Please correspond with him. His address is Gandhi Ashram, Tiruchengodu (South India).\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nM. K.
