The book is perched atop a set of hymn sheets, from a service for Sandya's husband, Prageeth. The juxtaposition is tragic - you can picture Sandya's…",

        "text": "Although absent, Prageeth’s face is everywhere. The living room brims with pictures of him. In pride of place on a low shelf are photos of a younger, smiling Prageeth holding his son. Posters bearing the slogan “Where is Prageeth?” cover the walls, while propped up behind the sofa is a poster- board full of messages to him.\n\nPrageeth’s face has become a familiar sight on the news, as has Sandya’s, as she tirelessly hunts for answers. Yet it is one thing to see Sandya’s face at the head of a protest, and another to see her in her home, which almost physically portrays her pain. She hasn’t heard from her husband since that fateful night on January 24, 2010, when he called to say he was on his way home from work. He never returned.\n\nA political analyst and cartoonist, Prageeth used his pen to, quite literally, draw attention to corruption and human rights abuses; and it is certain that his incisive commentary led to his disappearance.\n\nYet it’s important to remember that Prageeth isn’t the only one.\n\nToday (November 2) marks the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists. In an emotional interview, Sandya called for justice for all those who have been murdered or gone missing in pursuit of their trade.\n\nIn particular, Sandya called for attention to those journalists working in the North and East. Justice had not been served in the case of Dharmeratnam (Taraki) Sivaram, for instance, as well as many other Tamil journalists who were either missing or killed in the course of carrying out their duties. This situation extends even to Sinhalese journalists such as Lasantha Wickrematunge, she added.\n\n“These journalists have no weapons but the pen,” Sandya said urging for the Government to expedite these cases and bring a measure of peace to the journalist’s families.\n\nPrageeth’s case has seen some progress in the recent past, with the Court of Appeal recently ordering that the Army Commander and the Director of Intelligence – Sri Lankan Army be named as parties in the habeas corpus petition pertaining to Prageeth’s disappearance. Prior to this, the CID probe uncovered that Prageeth may have been murdered, with his body dumped in the seas off Trincomalee.\n\nSandya blames the previous Government, headed by former President Mahinda Rajapakse, for most of the crimes against journalists. She also says that the Army gave her no help in locating her husband. However since the January 8 Presidential election, she feels a glimmer of hope.\n\n“I have faith in the CID,” Sandya said, adding “This new Government has promised justice for journalists, and they have delivered a little so far.”\n\nYet, this optimism is tempered with the realization that all is not perfect. At the back of their home, Sandya shows us a large mural painted by her sons.\n\nA copse of trees stands on the right; one of the trees has been cut and is being bundled into a white van. “The absence of war does not equal the presence of peace” the slogan reads, and “We demand justice.”\n\nMany of the cases against journalists continue to languish unresolved. Following the UN Human Rights Council sessions in Geneva, there is a need for a new definitive mechanism to regulate human rights abuses and attacks on journalists in particular, Sandya said.\n\nSandya’s not a lone voice. Bharathi Rajanayagam, Editor of the Sunday Thinakkural too feels that much needs to be done to prevent crimes of impunity against journalists. The centerpiece of the Sunday Thinakkural office is a large noticeboard on which are pinned names and pictures of slain journalists. Prominently featured here are Prageeth Eknaligoda and Lasantha Wickrematunge – but there are also names here that are not seen so often in mainstream press. Names such as Sugeedarajan followed by the words “6 years, and the killers are out free”.\n\nBharathi Rajanayagam\n\nSpeaking about attacks against prominent Sinhalese journalists, Bharathi says there has been progress in the recent past, particularly in the cases of Prageeth Eknaligoda and Lasantha Wickrematunge, with some suspects finally detained and the CID making breakthroughs in both cases.\n\nHowever, the cases of many journalists killed or assaulted under regimes prior to Mahinda Rajapakse’s are yet to be resolved, which is an on-going problem, he added.\n\nIn particular the cases of Tamil journalists, such as Sivaram, Sugeedarajan, Nadesan and Nimalarajan were all unresolved. This may be because Tamil journalists were often branded as extremists and used for political mileage, Bharathi said. “They should bring the culprits of these cases to justice as these journalists are living in fear,” Bharathi said.\n\nHowever, Bharathi too said there had been a positive change in terms of freedom of expression with the changeover in Government, particularly in the Southern province. In the North, militarisation and the set up on High Security Zones still hampered journalists’ work, he said."
