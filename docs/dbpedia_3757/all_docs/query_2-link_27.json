For Whom There Are No Spoils of War\n\nPart II. The Politics Behind Dismantling Humanitarian Capability in the Vanni\n\nPart III. The Drive for Hegemony and Debilitation of the North-East: Cases and Reports\n\nSummary\n\nThe human rights situation in Sri Lanka is deteriorating with signs of it getting worse. At the same time the Presidents pledge of a political solution once the war is won is disingenuous if one looks at the East where he claims he has restored democracy by instituting a toothless provincial council.\n\nToday we are again witness to militaristic euphoria being sustained by an increasingly authoritarian regime terrorizing the people, the press and silencing voices of caution and humanity. The Governments war on terrorism quickly took on the character of an ideological crusade against the minorities in general, focused on the Defence Ministry. Fighting the LTTE has become almost secondary to the prerequisite of the extremists close to the corridors of power to establish a Sinhalese-Buddhist state and erase all semblance of pluralism. It is this obscurantism that in the first place kindled the present ethnic conflict. An important category that became targets of the States killer groups are those who are not LTTE sympathizers, but were active in defending and speaking up for legitimate Tamil interests. The result is the further isolation of the State from the Tamils.\n\nA responsible government must think and do the political work it is there to do, in winning over the Tamils and to persuade the world that it has a viable plan to minimize the damage and loss of life, before sending in the armed forces. To conduct a war with the present chauvinistic outlook is utterly irresponsible by the Sinhalese youth being sacrificed, even if the State has no empathy for the Tamil victims. But what is to be gained by giving the Tamils the message that they would lose everything and have no place in this country if the LTTE is defeated?\n\nOn the other side the people are in this terrible plight because the LTTE for its totalitarian ends repeatedly spurned opportunities to reach a political settlement. The peoples relationship with the LTTE is complex. The general mood among the people of the Vanni was strongly anti-LTTE four months ago, and resistance continues. Resistance however to the LTTE is either passive of tragically fatalistic. With increased aerial bombing and shelling and stories of increasingly repressive treatment of minorities coming from other parts of the country, the mood is changing. Despite this the LTTE, by October 2008, had once again become very aggressive in conscription.\n\nThere was fear under the LTTE, but now there is terror, violence and extreme uncertainty under the much travestied label of democracy. The natures of internal terror and external terror and their dynamism have been regularly discussed in our reports. The first destroys the soul of the community and the latter creates continuous uncertainty and fear; both take away hope and dignity from the people. That is why for us the choice is not between an LTTE victory and a Government victory. Both are obnoxious in their aims and inimical for the people. Any evil ultimately burns itself out. We could only hope and pray that the suffering of the people would be brief, followed by a dawn of fresh hope.\n\nThe current political and human rights situation in East Lanka portends a dismal future for democracy and security in Lanka as a whole. The LTTE has regrouped and is carrying out regular attacks and there is a reported upsurge in incidents of abduction, searches and abuse of women by government security forces and allied paramilitaries. In the East where the Governments public relations men boast of development and the restoration of democracy, there is greater fear, uncertainty and a deliberate cultivation of communal tensions.\n\nIn the North as the Army advancing along the western half of the Vanni edges closer to Killinochchi an estimated 200 000 displaced civilians are getting hemmed into the north-eastern corner of the Vanni, attempting to escape the ravages of the fighting. Facing abysmal conditions with continual bombing and shelling and forced to move at short notice, they had even stopped putting up temporary shelters. The choices for them were never human. Initially they moved north to escape shelling from the advancing army. Then the LTTE prevented those who tried to move into government-controlled areas. The Government in turn confines those escaping LTTE-controlled areas in mass detention centres from which they are not allowed to leave. Those in Vavuniya find themselves in a place of crime and lawlessness, where torture, murder, extortion, abduction and rape are routine and women are powerless. The blame lies mainly with the security forces and Tamil paramilitary elements working alongside them.\n\nThe South too will not escape unscathed. A very disproportionate burden in fighting the war is placed on the backs of rural Sinhalese youth sowing the seeds for future discord. For the poor everywhere it is their families that are their main source of joy. Instead of protecting and fostering that source of strength, the Government abuses their children as cheap cannon fodder for their perverted ideology.\n\nThe plight of the people of the Vanni, whose children are forced into military service by the LTTE and have suffered continuous death, deprivation and displacement because of the Governments heavy weaponry, has long been headline news. The UN and international agencies were the only ones present to provide reliable humanitarian capability as well as to witness. That the whole structure was dismantled literally overnight on an order from a government too well known for its disregard of the rule of law and humanitarian norms, should make us wonder at the fragility of international machinery we expect so much from. It raises questions about what the international order and agencies should realistically aim for. Have humanitarian norms fallen victim to the war on terror, whose rhetoric so many nation-states across the globe find useful? Are influential governments being soft on the Lankan government, because they were earlier soft on the LTTE?\n\nSince 1986 many people have posed the exasperating question, How on earth does one deal with a phenomenon like the LTTE? It has over the years shown a capacity to descend to the lowest depths without any qualms in the treatment of its own people, do the unthinkable such as conscripting children as young as ten, exploit and betray the most intimate forms of trust and one could go on. To those who understand that this phenomenon grew out of a persistent denial of political rights to the Tamils, accompanied by humiliation and violence, it is in addressing these that the cure should begin.\n\nIn our past reports we have given more detail to exemplify the trends. We give a few cases here to show that if anything the human rights situation is deteriorating with signs of it getting worse. We do not minimise the importance of complete documentation. But the task is so demanding that it needs to be undertaken by organisations with the dedicated resources. It may not even be possible in the current climate of terror. Inquiring into an individual case is much more demanding and frustrating than it was two years ago and one is left with the uncomfortable feeling of being a source of danger to someone. One feels truly humble before those who are willing to expose violators under these perilous conditions.\n\nPart I. For Whom There Are No Spoils of War\n\nCONTENTS\n\n1.1. How Many Corpses to a Political Settlement?\n\n1.2. Heroes under Duress\n\n1.3. In the North\n\n1.4. The Civilian Dilemma\n\n1.5. What of the People?\n\n1.6. Mass Detention Centres for Civilians who happen to be Tamil?\n\n1.7. Mistaken Priorities leading to a Fusion of Evils\n\n1.8. Prospect of Prolonged Instability\n\n1.1. How Many Corpses to a Political Settlement?\n\nUnder a government-imposed straitjacket, the media in Colombo presents the current military campaign in the Vanni as moving towards a total rout of the LTTE. This perception, which some experienced journalists have cautioned against, fails to take into account the deep-set insecurity felt by victims on both sides. Their sense of alienation should not be treated with complacency. How easily the decision-makers forget our recent past! In 1987, the social rot in the South caused by militarisation and chauvinistic hypocrisy was so deep that the horrors of the JVP insurgency followed on the heels of euphoria over the Armys major victory against the LTTE in Vadamaratchy. Once more the social rot and discontent are very deep.\n\nToday we are again witness to militaristic euphoria being sustained by an increasingly authoritarian regime terrorising the Press, silencing voices of caution and humanity from civil society and managing the news about the war. Accordingly casualty figures that were in the past around 1:1 are now touted as overwhelmingly, 1:4 and 1:20, in the Governments favour. The Defence Secretary vaunts that the continuous and historic victories of the Security Forces would soon lead to a landmark victory  the long heralded capture of Killinochchi. But then the town has changed hands twice in two and a half decades of war.\n\nHaving ordered the INGOs to quit Vanni, the only independent institutions present to monitor humanitarian aid, the Government has practically decapitated humanitarian capability in the Vanni. It has rendered the sufferings of the people an open area for propaganda games, with the Government and the LTTE throwing unverifiable charges at each other.\n\nAt the root of the present crisis lies the Sinhalese politys inability to offer a political settlement acceptable to the minorities; and in this regard, President Rajapakses record has been one of patent duplicity. Having launched an All Party Representatives Committee to find a political settlement, he reduced it to a sycophantic parody. The Commission of Inquiry into selected serious violations has been sabotaged by subterfuge from the Presidents office.\n\nThe Presidents pledge of a political solution, once the war is won is disingenuous if one looks at the East where he claims he has restored democracy by instituting a toothless provincial council. The putative Tamil leaders his intelligence services patronised, divided and nominally empowered  the TMVP  are at each at each others throats. The spate of violations, in which States role is dominant, frame its patently sectarian agenda  one that prompted the Tamil youth rebellion in the first place. The independent voices in the East that survived the LTTE and its progeny are now being methodically targeted or intimidated by the Governments killers.\n\nThe latest community representative to fall victim was Siva Shree Siva Kadacha Sivakugarajah, priest of Koneswaram Temple, Trincomalee, who had recently been confronting the authorities on the extra-judicial killing of civilians. The Government was quick to blame his murder of 21st September 2008 on the LTTE before any investigation. But our own inquiries place the culpability decisively at the door of the military authorities in Trincomalee. State terror in the East is deeply pervasive and sinister and more so because all news is controlled and distorted by the Defence Ministry and goes into the wire services unchallenged. (See Part III.)\n\nOn the other side, the people are in this terrible plight because the LTTE for its totalitarian ends repeatedly spurned opportunities to reach a political settlement. Its supporters will not face up to the reality of those forced to fight and die for a cause they do not believe in and the agony of families providing abducted sons and daughters for its cannon fodder. On the ground a hapless people are confronted with things others do not want to face.\n\nChief among them is the issue of protection of civilians in general, who are increasingly coming under the government security regime that acts with complete impunity. Despite the assurances the Government regularly gives, its own record of routine abductions and killings is atrocious, and is perhaps worst in Vavuniya where the government plans to house the Vanni displaced in what are prisons all but in name. Once again both the warring parties have sought to control the movement of Tamil civilians for propaganda and military purposes.\n\nAt the start of the government offensive from the Mannar-Vavuniya Road in 2007, the people moved a little north on their own when shells started to fall. Neither did they have the option of staying in their homes nor did the LTTE force them to move. The LTTE used force only when the civilians wanted to cross over to stay with relatives in the government-controlled area. The Army too wanted total displacement. Had the Government announced safe places for civilians beforehand in every village; the LTTE would have found matters difficult. Presently, in view of humanitarian pressure from India, reports coming out are of an intensification of fighting and the Army being pushed to finish the job sooner. The danger to civilians too becomes greater.\n\n1.2. Heroes under Duress\n\nEarly September 2008 saw some heavy fighting with heavy casualties on both sides. According to reports from the ground, the injured were first taken to Anuradhapura Hospital. But when the Sinhalese public got upset and emotional, many of the casualties were directed to Vavuniya and Mannar Hospitals that lie in largely Tamil areas. A soldier with an amputated leg told a Tamil civilian that they were sent to the front through deception. He was in a group that was told that their duties would be to provide security for a road bridge blown up by the LTTE in 1990 that was to be reconstructed with Japanese aid. Another soldier said that they were brought there with an assurance that they would be used only for logistics work and then sent to the front.\n\nAnother soldier who had just been trucked to Murunkan south of the northern front asked a Tamil civilian where he was. When the civilian explained to him, the soldier slapped his forehead and exclaimed, We were told we are being sent to Badulla!\n\nAt a village near Madhu, which the Army captured recently, an army officer and his men stopped a group of civilians. The officer poured out his heart and told them, When we see people here with their families, we are reminded of our own homes and families. We hoped that this problem would be solved peacefully, but that was not to be. We will soon be sent to the front. We are anxious and afraid. Please pray for us.\n\nThe young soldiers who spoke to Tamil civilians were very young and barely adults. They were given a different picture of military life than the butchery involved in the context of this war, and were conned into going to the front  into a fate that is glorious and exhilarating only for politicians and generals who ride on their backs to transient fame.\n\nAccording to sources close to a Buddhist womens group in Anuradhapura, there are hundreds of ex-soldiers who lost limbs during the last two years languishing in the border districts of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. They are the flotsam and jetsam of war that must be hidden from serving soldiers and prospective recruits.\n\nLankadissent.com (2 Aug.02) quoted the Sinhalese weekly Ravaya, which placed the number of desertions from the Army at 9500 since hostilities commenced in the North-East in 2006. The report clarified, Since the resumption of hostilities, an estimated 25,000 soldiers had deserted their ranks, all of whom had later been allowed to resign officially. The latest desertions are by those who had joined the army recently, [Ravaya] added. The Ravaya quoted the Military Spokesman as having placed the number of desertions at 15 000 in January 2008 of whom he said 4000 rejoined after a government amnesty. Deserters thus make up a significant fraction of the Army.\n\nIn the border areas of the North, civilians are generally aware that the young soldiers have been sent there without being warned of the grave threat to life and limb, but were rather told that their work is to provide security in captured areas. Once they are taken there they are closely monitored and desertion becomes difficult. Also when buses stop at checkpoints, those with a military look are separated from the other passengers and are told that the Army would see them to their destination. They are then checked to find out if they are deserters. We reliably learn that the number of desertions by soldiers in the Vanni was about 700 during August and September.\n\n1.3. In the North\n\nAs the Army advancing along the western half of the Vanni edges closer to Killinochchi an estimated 200 000 displaced civilians are getting hemmed into the north-eastern corner of the Vanni. Facing abysmal conditions, they have even stopped putting up temporary shelters. They move north and as shells begin to fall they know they must move again. For the night they spread a mat under a tree. When they roll the mat in the morning, it is not unusual to find snakes and scorpions sheltering under the warmth of the mat. Several of them see it as a miracle that no one has so far died from these poisonous reptiles, although several persons bitten have been hospitalised. Recent rains have increased the number.\n\nThe LTTE is presently not talking far ahead. It claims that the Army advanced only in areas they allowed them to (i.e. the western sector of the Vanni). Until recently it did not officially say that every family would have to contribute a second fighter, but the message was that they must all fight to the finish, and if it comes to the worst, each person must kill as many soldiers as possible before being killed.\n\nThe peoples relationship with the LTTE is complex. The general mood among the people was strongly anti-LTTE four months ago, and resistance continues. But with increased aerial bombing and shelling and stories of increasingly repressive treatment of minorities coming from other parts of the country, the mood is changing. We have seen this happen repeatedly from 1987. But the fact that a large number of unwilling persons have been conscripted to fight must have an adverse internal impact within the LTTE. Resistance to the LTTE is either passive or tragically fatalistic. Our sources affirmed that a few girl conscripts used their weapons to kill themselves, but were unable to give more details. The girls found the militaristic environment and the injunction to kill utterly unbearable. On further inquiry, we were assured that such things do happen, as people hear when they move around areas where battles are fought and meet LTTE cadres who talk. What is more significant they said was inexperienced new conscripts faced with the terrible sensation of battle and deafening explosions around them, taking refuge in their cyanide capsule or their own bullet.\n\nA number of Christian churches in the Vanni are stridently pacifist. But as a group, they found themselves unable to resist conscription of their young. When one of their young dies in battle, the ministers of the churches and the Pentecostal Sisters have preached at funerals that God in his mercy took away these young persons to spare them the pain of killing others.\n\nYoung conscripts, who resist the LTTE as conscientious objectors, are liable for heavy punishment. For this reason several of them have taken personal vows and informed their parents and guides not to worry on their account as in whatever situation they find themselves, they have sworn not to kill, but are ready to be killed instead.\n\nThe LTTE had a large camp at Moonru-Murippu, now overrun by government forces. It had scores of metal cages, with pointed wires extending inside. Conscripted persons who refused to fight were shut inside. The pointed wires ensured that they had to stand in a bent position and get pricked if they tried to move. They were let out only when they agreed to the LTTEs demands. These cages had during the ceasefire been used to coerce particularly businessmen abducted for extortion.\n\nBy October 2008, the LTTE had once again become very aggressive in conscription. They visited families with lists provided by Village Headmen (GS officers). For a family with 3 or 4 children, they demanded two fighters; one for a family with two; and none for a family with one. The general attitude of the populace now is not to quarrel with the LTTE. They figure that many of those who objected to conscription had been placed on the frontline and are dead. But many of those who joined without resistance have been placed in safer areas and have survived. Since early September, sources from the Vanni say that the LTTE has conscripted 9000 very young persons who are now under training.\n\nA large number of desertions have also been reported in the LTTE. Recently, we learn, about 250 cadres ran away and are hiding in the jungle. These sources said that about three of them are very senior. Other sources said that many of the LTTEs conscripts are desperately trying to identify escape routes to the government-controlled area.\n\nAfter the Army announced safe areas for civilians in East Vanni in Viswamadu (Vattakachchi and Dharmapuram) and Oddusuddan, by 9th October, the civilians were moving towards these areas. Yet their utility remains questionable without agreement from the LTTE and the absence of a sufficient number of neutral monitors. A section of the civilians, both natives of Kilinochchi District and those who came from further south had plans of moving to Jaffna in fishing boats that came from Jaffna. Around September end, nearly 2500 of them had gathered in Ruthirapuram, three miles northwest of Killinochchi, with plans of crossing the lagoon to Jaffna. At this time there was a wave of bombing and shelling around Killinochchi, in which the LTTE political office was hit. A shell fell in Ruthirapuram, injuring a girl in her 30s.\n\nThe LTTE came there and wanted to shift the people to the East Vanni. Some people objected saying that they want to go to the government-controlled area. The LTTE named a large sum of money adding that if anyone would pay that sum, they could pay and go. The people were then shifted to the east.\n\nApart from the LTTE stopping them, there are other pressing reasons why families are reluctant to flee from the Vanni. Many of their children have been conscripted and are either dead or serving on the battle lines. As far as the Government is concerned they are marked, irrespective of the fact that their children were forcibly removed. Once in the government-controlled area, they would be photographed, confined to camps and paraded before masked informants, often persons from their area who know their family history.\n\n1.4. The Civilian Dilemma\n\nAs to the fate of the conscripts who might survive the current round of war, Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapakses interview in Lakbima News of 21st September 2008 reaffirms the grim prospect that is public knowledge: Yes. You have to remove everybody (i.e. all LTTE cadres). At the same time, you could rehabilitate them. In the East, we have identified about 1,300 cadres who were active before and who now live with their families. Its not that we kill everybody. But as long as they carry the weapon and are waiting to fight, you have to remove them.\n\nThe Defence Secretary is here making a fairly frank statement on what several rights groups have charged was government policy from 2006. Under this policy, government assassins killed fishermen with families the LTTE forcibly took from Jaffna to the Vanni during the ceasefire and trained for a few weeks (Special Report No.28). It is the Defence Ministrys agents who decide when a person is waiting to fight. It is like an open licence to kill Tamils. How capricious these judgments can be, is illustrated by the case of the conscientious foreign humanitarian worker, Giovanni Porta, whom in September, based on intelligence from these agents, the Defence Secretary wrongly accused of joining the LTTE (see Part II).\n\nAs another indication, the Governments nominated Tamil leadership, the former LTTE Pillayan group, was meeting the public in Trincomalee. The question was asked why they were killing former LTTE cadres who are no longer combatants. A Pillayan man replied, If they had left the LTTE, they should have joined us. If they have not done so, we are bound to treat them as LTTE sympathisers. In fact, Karuna and Pillayan had conscripted many of them for the LTTE as children, when they were Prabhakarans Eastern henchmen.\n\nIn the face of this, what would be the fate of the people in a liberated Vanni? For a cadre who manages to escape from the LTTE, family is the first and last line of defence. The foreign humanitarian staff quit well in advance of the deadline set by the Government without forcefully arguing the case of the people they are meant to protect. This places the families of LTTE conscripts in a difficult position. How can they run away without knowing the fate of their sons and daughters conscripted by the LTTE, leaving them at the mercy of two sets of predators? That they are running into the dubious protection of what are virtually government prisons, makes the decision that much more heartbreaking.\n\n1.5. What of the People?\n\nHaving taken out expatriate aid staff, the Government suggested that the local staff of these organisations could work as government volunteers paid by their nominal employers. This has created a painful dilemma for agencies who instilled into them certain ethics appropriate to their calling. As government volunteers, they would report to the government machinery in their area, which has no choice but to take orders from the LTTE and perhaps later, the Government  something they have been trained to resist.\n\nBy pulling the expatriates out, the Government has created a situation that has strengthened the LTTEs control over people and resources. A number of articles in the press have raised questions about what this could mean in a conflict where military and political stakes are high, given the LTTEs record of unscrupulous use of the civilian population and the Governments proverbial callousness. A particular fear is the control of food rations to locate the people. The other is the distribution of food.\n\nPresently over 80% of the population is displaced and their own resources of food are negligible. Of the three other sources of food, the first is the food rations distributed by the Commissioner General of Essential Services (CGES) to displaced families not resettled during the ceasefire amounting to Rs. 1000 a month. This is all the food supplied by the Government and it covers a very tiny fraction. It is also very slow and also inadequate. The second source is the World Food Programme in an agreement with the CGES, which covers most people, including now most of Mannar District. This aims at providing each person with 2100 calories per day. At the last reckoning the food going into the Vanni to feed an estimated 430 000 people was 750  800 tonnes, while the actual requirement was 1500 tonnes. If the Government believes that the estimated population is excessive, it must tell us with evidence what the real figure is. If not the Government and the agencies open themselves to the charge of starving the people.\n\nThe third source and the only one meaningful in an emergency are the INGOs, who immediately provide two weeks of rations to the newly displaced. This source is now in disarray. Although the Government claims to be able to look after the people, its machinery at best is very inadequate for that purpose as seen in the bureaucratic delays and lack of capacity  many government officers are absconding. With a view to blunt criticism, the Government hit upon the idea of allowing UN food monitors to go with WFP food convoys and hand over the food to the government administration. This accomplishes little in overseeing the distribution of food.\n\nIt is remarkable that while the Government carries on shelling and displacing people, nearly all the money to feed the displaced comes from foreign donors, who are in turn abused and flayed on the charge of supporting the LTTE, and finally the government gets is own way with them. What it wants them to do next is even more grotesque.\n\n1.6. Mass Detention Centres for Civilians who happen to be Tamil?\n\nNo less a person than the Army Commander anticipates that recapturing land earlier controlled by the LTTE would not end the war but transform it into a long running guerrilla war. In the East in 2006, the civilians were deliberately displaced and a great deal of land was taken over under the pretext of security. In the Vanni too the Government does not seem to intend speedy resettlement of the displaced, and to this end what are in fact detention centres were set up for the civilians who fled the LTTE area.\n\nThe Government set up camps in Kallimoddai and Sirukandal near Murunkan in the Mannar District for persons who escaped from the LTTE-controlled area. Some paid boatmen several lakhs of rupees for a ride into the government-controlled area. Initially the youth were allowed to go to Mannar town with an army escort, who took them in a bus and brought them back. That has been stopped after one youth taken to town escaped. Due to a water shortage in the area, the inmates of the camp need to go outside to bathe. Anyone going to bathe must find someone to stand surety. The inadequacy of government-funds for the centre has meant that many of the inmates, who belong to about 243 families, live in tents. With the onset of rains their situation becomes horrible.\n\nOne aspect confirming the prison status of these camps is that families are not allowed to seek shelter with host families  hitherto a common arrangement for the displaced in this country. We also learnt that displaced persons who had made arrangements to go abroad before they were displaced  such as young women whose fiancés are waiting to receive them into marriage  are not allowed to pursue such legitimate ends. University students have after some delay been allowed out.\n\nThe Government as usual expects foreign governments and INGOs to pick up the bill for the misery it causes. So far INGOs have avoided getting involved in what is in effect illegal confinement of citizens of the same country not charged with any offence. It is something they would find hard to justify. The Government is evidently satisfied with this pilot project and is planning to have one in Vavuniya on a huge scale for civilians presently living under LTTE-control it expects to free. What is worse, Vavuniya has become a place of crime and lawlessness, where torture, murder, extortion, abduction and rape are routine. Women are powerless. The blame for their plight largely owes to the security forces and Tamil paramilitary groups working with them (see Part III).\n\nOnce confronted with the misery of these inadequately financed detention centres with children, mothers and infants whose basic needs are not met, the INGOs would face a severe dilemma whether to go in and, in effect, sanction this arrangement, or to turn a blind eye to gigantic misery. Unfortunately the UN and most INGOs have too readily compromised with the LTTE and the State, and it becomes difficult to start putting up a fight.\n\nWe recently learnt that some of the virtual detainees at Kallimoddai and Sirukandal have become mentally ill, one of them badly. But the doctors who visit these centers have not been competent to treat such illness. Lately, we learn that permission may be given to take the patients to government hospitals. Many of the issues have been dealt with in the timely report of the Civil Society Field Mission to Vavuniya (http://transcurrents.com/tc/2008/09/post_36.html)\n\n1.7. Mistaken Priorities leading to a Fusion of Evils\n\nSince 1986 many people have posed the exasperating question, How on earth does one deal with a phenomenon like the LTTE? It has over the years shown a capacity to descend to the lowest depths without any qualms in the treatment of its own people, do the unthinkable such as conscripting children as young as ten, exploit and betray the most intimate forms of trust and one could go on. To those who understand that this phenomenon grew out of a persistent denial of political rights to the Tamils, accompanied by humiliation and violence, it is in addressing these that the cure should begin.\n\nSinhalese supremacists who believe that there is no ethnic problem, no question of political rights and only a question of terrorism that must be crushed ruthlessly, dominate the present government. It gave its signature at the outset, at the turn of 2005, by the assassination of a Tamil politician at Christmas Mass followed by the staged incident where the STF executed five innocent Tamil students on the Trincomalee sea front.\n\nEverything else followed logically. Killer squads under the Defence Ministry were let loose to remove potential LTTE supporters, displacement of Tamils, placing them in refugee camps where they could be checked and if needed removed, and assassinating a second Tamil parliamentarian at the end of 2006 became all part of policy. As representatives or spokesmen for the Tamil people, the Government would only tolerate groups who would provide killers and flatter them in positions of nominal power.\n\nThe Governments war on terrorism quickly took on the character of an ideological crusade against the minorities in general, centred on the Defence Ministry. Fighting the LTTE became almost secondary to the prerequisites of the extremists in power to establish a totalitarian Sinhalese-Buddhist state and erase all semblance of pluralism. An important category that became targets of the States killer groups were those who were not LTTE sympathisers, but were active in defending and speaking up for legitimate Tamil interests (see Part III).\n\nThe result was the complete isolation of the State from the Tamils, no Tamil with whom the Government could discuss pressing security problems like bomb blasts in Colombo. The progress of the Governments policy logically resulted in restrictions on the movement of Tamils from one place to another, Tamils having to register and get passes to move and be treated as terrorists by the security forces. Detention centres for Tamils from the Vanni grew out of these measures.\n\nThe Government cornered itself into a position where it could not tolerate any independent Tamil voice even on the most mundane of issues. Mr. Sinnathamby Shanmugam was Government Agent (GA), Vavuniya, with a few months to retirement. At a meeting presided over by the Presidents brother Basil Rajapakse, Shanmugam expressed reservations in very mild and diplomatic terms about why the people would not readily come to the virtual detention centres the Government was establishing for the people fleeing the Vanni. Basil Rajapakse reportedly lost his cool and blasted Shanmugam for speaking as though for the LTTE. Shanmugam was promptly removed from his post (about 22nd August 2008) and transferred to the administrative service pool.\n\nThe actions of the Government from late 2005 have strengthened the admittedly negative political appeal of the LTTE. Apart from the LTTEs own killings, the Governments actions have done immeasurable harm in suppressing any Tamil political alternative to the LTTE. It has left the Tamils feeling bitter and angry against the Government. Consequently the upsurge of independent Tamil activism both locally and in the Diaspora, that contributed to the LTTE being banned in several countries, might die a natural death.\n\nTamils who firmly believed that the LTTEs politics must be destroyed to give their people a decent chance in life, are likely to see themselves as having no role, if what they do would only be used by the Government to deny the Tamils their basic rights. It would seem justifiable to subsume the LTTEs dominance under the fatalistic question, Who are we to kick against the karma of the Sinhalese polity?\n\nIn this reality, despite the military setbacks, the demise of the LTTE should not be taken for granted. Besides the heavy economic cost, the Government is sustaining this war by using deception to send young recruits to the battlefront. The casualties and desertions are far higher than officially admitted. The Government has been constantly recruiting soldiers. According to the Defence Secretary (Lakbima News 21 Sep.08), the Government increased its troop strength by 50 000 two years ago. The Army has launched its fourth recruitment drive for the year on 1st October, which is expected to bring in 14 000 new soldiers, or nearly 50 000 for the year 2008. This does not match the Governments claim that the LTTE is on its last legs.\n\nSources with a good knowledge of what is happening in the Defence Ministry, disclosed that the Government is anxious to complete the capture of the Vanni by the end of 2008, because of the largely suppressed effects of casualties and the pressure of desertions. To those familiar with the ups and downs of the fortunes of the antagonists over the decades, the Armys position in the Vanni today is not a happy one. What this indecisive scenario means for the displaced and the people of the Vanni is unthinkable.\n\n1.8. Prospect of Prolonged Instability\n\nThe LTTE has vacated Killinochchi, the Governments much-hyped goal. Looking at matters realistically, the LTTE seems set to offer resistance to maximise army losses and withdraw to more defensible positions. A tired Army might then stagger into Killinochchi, which would then be used for political mileage. Then a great many uncertainties would confront both sides. The LTTEs claim that it has allowed the Army to advance only where it allowed them to is not entirely without substance. There has been no significant army advance in the more crucial East Vanni. The LTTE has been telling the people that they are awaiting the northeast monsoon rains to counter-attack. Without indulging in undue speculation, one could say that it is going to be a long haul for the civilians.\n\nIt means that many innocent Tamil civilians would remain vagrants in a war zone or languish in virtual prisons under government control. Others would face regular harassment, ad hoc pass systems, humiliation and restrictions on their movement. What is even worse, the Government would continue with its programme of removal of persons indefinitely. And its chauvinistic constraints do not seem to offer any other alternative. This could be seen in the East. The fanfare of liberating the East and offering democracy is over. The LTTE has regrouped and is carrying out regular attacks. And thus it crossed the Defence Secretarys mind that some of the 1300 former LTTE cadres identified by them might become candidates for removal and there is an upsurge in incidents of abduction, searches and reported abuse of women (see Part III). The South too will not escape unscathed.\n\nA very disproportionate burden in fighting the war has been placed on the backs of rural Sinhalese youths. Notable among them are those who come from colony areas of the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Districts. Promises of making them prosperous through repairing abandoned medieval reservoirs and giving them land to cultivate have turned sour. It was among the poor youth of these areas that the JVP recruited large numbers for both its rebellions. Life in the Army too led to loss and disillusionment, sowing the seeds of future discord. For the poor everywhere it is their families that are their main source of joy. Instead of protecting and fostering that source of strength, the Government abuses their children as cheap cannon fodder for their perverted ideology.\n\nThose in power thus, assail anything said that gives them discomfort as treachery. Wise rulers use institutional force sparingly and as the last resort. In Lanka the rulers have forgotten democratic norms and rely on the Defence Ministrys use of latent and actual force, as the first resort to deal with criticism. This is premised on the supposition that legitimate criticism of the State and the inner workings of the military apparatus helps the LTTE and is therefore treachery.\n\nThus film directors who explore the militarisation of society, editors who publish reports on the plight of the displaced, journalists who expose irregularities in defence purchases, favouritism that is detrimental to the Armys efficacy and lawyers who campaign for human rights or expose corruption in the State have had unpleasant, life-threatening brushes with agents either from the Defence Ministry itself or acting with its complicity. What we see is the picture of a government, both terribly nervous and whose arrogance far overreaches its wisdom. An example of arrogance is the Army Commanders repeated affirmation on behalf of the ruling clique that the country belongs to the Sinhalese.\n\nThe cockiness is also reflected in the Defence Ministry and the Press giving new Sinhalised or allegedly original Sinhalese names to areas captured by the Army. Reminders of the countrys pluralist legacy are being erased by what has become virtually a Sinhala Only State. The Army as developments go is becoming a narrowly political affair rather than a professional institution upholding the law.\n\nAt the same time these efforts are breeding hardship and explosive discontent among the Sinhalese themselves. The bombing of the residence of Mr. Welimuna, human rights lawyer and head of the Sri Lankan chapter of Transparency International is the latest in the catalogue of growing repression. The trends strengthen rather than weaken long term prospects for the Tigers. That they think for the long term is again evident in the 6th October 2008 suicide bomb assassination of Major General Janaka Perera, Rtd. at a UNP party office in Anuradhapura, killing over two dozen persons. The fact that the General was killed in part due to the pettiness of those in power who in spite of a court order failed to afford him the requisite security, indicates where fighting the LTTE stands in their scale of things.\n\nThat again illustrates the futility of the current round of war in which both sides are sacrificing the young and unwilling, bringing misery to hundreds of families. Besides, neither side is going to be victorious.\n\nA responsible government must think and do the political work it is there to do, in winning over the Tamils and persuading the world that it has a viable plan to minimise the damage and loss of life, before sending in the armed forces. To conduct a war with the present chauvinistic outlook is utterly irresponsible by the Sinhalese youth being sacrificed, even if the State has no empathy for Tamil victims.\n\nWhat is gained by giving the Tamils the message that they would lose everything and have no place in this country if the LTTE is defeated? What would be the long-term effect of the Governments anti-minority stance and its penchant for removals? Perhaps around 5000 experienced ex-LTTE men and women living in the Vanni have refused to rejoin the LTTE. What is their choice if a Government victory means a fair prospect of their removal? It is all ludicrous as strategy and morally obnoxious.\n\nThere should be no return to the kind of appeasement that sweeps the crimes of both sides under the carpet for an unstable, oppressive peace. But there is open the prospect of minimizing the suffering by taking cognizance of available international mechanisms that could help us. That challenge falls to those willing to see that the country is poised on a precipice.\n\nPart II: The Politics Behind Dismantling Humanitarian Capability in the Vanni\n\nCONTENTS\n\n2.1. INGOs to Quit Vanni  Getting More Bizarre as the Drama Unfolds\n\n2.2. In the Light of the Mutur Experience\n\n2.3. The Saga of Giovanni Porta\n\n2.4. What should the Legacy of Humanitarian Agencies be?\n\n2.5. The Art of Controlling the UN\n\nThe plight of the people of Vanni, whose children are forced into military service by the LTTE and have suffered continuous death, deprivation and displacement because of the Governments heavy weaponry, has long been headline news. The UN and international agencies were the only ones present to provide reliable humanitarian capability as well as to witness. That this whole structure was dismantled literally overnight on an order from a government too well known for its disregard of the rule of law and humanitarian norms, should make us wonder at the fragility of international machinery we expect so much from. This is after all a world where we have for 60 years been talking of solidarity and universal norms.\n\nIt raises questions about what the international order and agencies should realistically aim for. Have humanitarian norms fallen victim to the war on terror, whose rhetoric so many nation-states across the globe find useful? Are influential governments being soft on the Lankan government, because they were earlier soft on the LTTE?\n\nThen what were the objectives of humanitarian work in the Vanni? Was it aimed at long term social well being or just basic needs in war? Was not the LTTEs conscription of the young a humanitarian issue? That delimiting their mandate puts humanitarians in difficult positions appears from the fact that the Government is now trying to obtain their complicity for detaining residents of the Vanni in camps in Vavuniya, under conditions notorious for crime and abuse.\n\n2.1. INGOs to Quit Vanni  Getting More Bizarre as the Drama Unfolds\n\nOn 8th September the Defence Secretary instructed all humanitarian agencies to quit the Vanni and set up base in Vavuniya. It was an order although the UN in its statement of 9th September, with little hint of protest or alarm, used the term request: The UN in Sri Lanka acknowledges the announcement by the Government of Sri Lanka that they can no longer ensure the safety of aid workers in the Vanni, and their request that UN and NGO staff should relocate to government-controlled territory. At a press conference on 16th September Human Rights Minister Samarasinghe emphasised that the decision to move foreign humanitarian staff to Vavuniya was not negotiable (Island 17 Sept.08).\n\nSome humanitarian professionals felt that it was wrong of them to leave the people and local staff behind and quit just when they were needed most in the context of a government military offensive towards Killinochchi. Some humanitarian staff felt disturbed that the UN fell into line without a fight, following their very conservative security guidelines, quitting in eight days with most expatriate staff when they had asked and been given three weeks. They felt that the UN should have dragged on negotiations with the Government rather than scamper. The ICRC was staying as they had a different agreement.\n\nThe UNs approach was reflected in a statement by Gordon Weiss, its spokesman in Colombo (Daily Mirror 10 Sept.08): It is the prime responsibility of the government to provide security to humanitarian workers and if they cannot give it to us then we will leave The UN cannot do any thing about the safety of the civilians as this is once again the responsibility of the government.\n\nThis gives a different impression from the statement Gordon Weiss made as UNICEF spokesman to the Sunday Observer last November (25 Nov.2007) when the UNICEF came under attack from the JVP:  we would not be able to carry out humanitarian work for children in Vanni if we do not have an office in Vanni. We usually work in conflict areas in 160 countries but [have] never withdrawn our offices due to dangerous situations in these countries. Under humanitarian principles the UNICEF is there to provide humanitarian assistance when they need. On the cardinal importance of the UNICEFs presence, he said that the Killinochchi office is the only link to provide humanitarian assistance for children trapped in uncleared areas. This situation reveals a mismatch between what UN agencies could provide within their security constraints and the humanitarian needs on the ground.\n\nThe main criticism of the aid staff who have set up base in Vavuniya, is that they are in a militarised town generating traffic, while doing nothing to protect civilians in the Vanni. Rather, they are duplicating their infrastucture in Colombo, generating emails and guidelines. It helps the Government to keep up a pretence of dealing with the humanitarian problem.\n\nIn the wake of protests against the Governments quit order to expatriate humanitarian staff, the Governments Peace Secretariat claimed in a statement (early October) that the Government wanted the UNHCR and the World Food Programme (WFP) to continue in the Vanni and added, When they were guaranteed safe passage to Wanni in mid-September, all of them refused the offer on security grounds. Sri Lankan NGOs were the only ones to travel. This, with other reports, indicates that the Government was having second thoughts once the dismantling of humanitarian capability in the Vanni was underway.\n\nWhile the UN acted according to the premise that it was there at the invitation or sufferance of the Government, most other INGOs have people with an activist background that is distrustful of governments and considers their main obligation and loyalty to the people, especially when they are endangered. From their own backgrounds, many individuals in UN agencies are sensitive to the latter standpoint. Using its tremendous influence, the UN could play the essential role of in addition giving cover for others with an unorthodox people-centred approach to work more effectively.\n\nBut given the record of a State that has been bombing and shelling its civilians for over 20 years and freely uses killer squads, the UN knew what the people would confront once they left. By the UN saying they would leave if the Government cannot ensure the safety of humanitarian workers, what ensued was that the expatriates left leaving their local humanitarian staff and the people in greater danger. What was really needed, as far as the Government was concerned, was an assurance that they would not bomb or shell in a manner that would place humanitarian staff in danger. Practically that was all the Government could guarantee and has hitherto guaranteed. Was that too much to ask this time? The rest of the assurance has to come from the LTTE and they would not have stayed unless they had something in place with the LTTE.\n\nIf the Government could not give this minimal assurance to the UN, how seriously could one take its pledges to protect the civilians, or to ensure zero civilian casualties as the Human Rights Minister put it (Daily Mirror 17 Sep.08)? If the Government was serious about protecting the civilians, it should have been the most keen to ensure that the international agencies remained.\n\nIn Special Report No. 26 we pointed out that the Governments military operations in the East in 2006 and 2007 involved driving civilians out by shelling, killing over 250 of them, and appropriating their lands without due process as high security zones or for economic projects aimed at changing the demographic balance. Such are a travesty of humanitarian law. We cited among a number of international laws and advisories, Article 7 of the Rome Statute of The International Criminal Court. Among crimes against humanity, it lists (d) Deportation or forcible transfer of population and (i) enforced disappearance of persons. Further, international humanitarian law regards a war crime or crime against humanity, indiscriminate attacks on areas populated by civilians (e.g. Article 51 (4) of Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions).\n\n2.2. In the Light of the Mutur Experience\n\nBoth the Defence Secretary and Minister for Human Rights have defended the order for the evacuation of expatriate humanitarian staff from the Vanni by claiming that their safety is the Governments responsibility, which cannot be ensured during continuing military operations. As for the safety of the civilians, one could judge from what the Defence Secretary told Lakbima News (21 Sept.08): Theres a breaking point. At that time, nobody can stop them. Till such time, [the civilians] will wait there but when they realise that troops are moving in and they can no longer stay, they will come out.\n\nAs for the real reasons for not wanting expatriate staff in the Vanni, we might judge from the Mutur experience. From May 2006, the Government through paramilitary agents mounted pressure on international agencies in Mutur to quit. On a Sunday afternoon grenades were thrown at the offices of three INGOs and an employee of the Non-Violent Peace Force was injured. Three weeks later the office of the Emergency Architects was robbed and two foreigners there were threatened. Threatening letters were sent to others including ACF. Circumstantial factors point to the involvement of Military Intelligence with the complicity of the Police hierarchy (see Appendix I to Special Report No.30). ACF too pulled out, but later sent local staff back to Mutur a short while before the tragedy.\n\nIn early August 2006 when the LTTE took over Mutur after the start of hostilities, there were no expatriates. The Army retook the town after indiscriminate shelling in which about 50 civilians were killed. Shells struck the Hospital and places of refuge such as Arabic College. When there was a lull on 4th August the civilians vacated en masse. We could thus judge what is in store for the civilians in the Vanni from experience and the Human Rights Ministers inapt remark that they could pressure civilians to quit the LTTE-held area. From 2006, there have been no guarantees for civilians. Schools, hospitals and paces of worship have been hit.\n\nIt becomes much harder to give meaningful assurances to civilians in Vanni after removing international staff. Their presence would be the strongest deterrence against the LTTE provoking the Army from near places of refuge.\n\nThe BBC feature Pain of Sri Lanka aid pull out (23 Sept.08) written by an aid worker who left the Vanni on 16th Sept.08 confirmed the greatest fear people had of the departure of international staff: It was the prospect of our physical departure that terrified them. With no international presence and no witness to the conflict, they believed that many atrocities would occur and no one would see this.\n\nKnowing all this, many people wish that the UN, before leaving, had negotiated a compromise for willing aid staff to remain. They were instead party to a conscientious humanitarian worker who took his obligation to the people seriously becoming isolated and impugned as a terrorist.\n\n2.3. The Saga of Giovanni Porta\n\nGiovanni was known among his colleagues and the people around for his principled humanitarian commitment and his abhorrence of violence. It was this that gave him the flair for confronting the LTTE and securing space for the people. He was able to protect his local staff from forced conscription by the LTTE. There is an irrefutable record testifying to the determination with which he upheld humanitarian principles and forced the LTTE to recognise that he could not be pushed around.\n\nWhen the quit order came, to ones who had developed a relationship with the people to whom ones presence gave courage and confidence, besides a feeling of reciprocal trust and obligation, quitting seemed an act of desertion. That was the plight in which Giovanni found himself when marching orders came.\n\nThe manner in which the local press dealt with him places Lanka in a very poor light. It also reveals the extent to which Sinhalese chauvinist sentiment has clouded caution. What the country owed to the man was gratitude and not abuse. The Island of 27th September carried the sensational lead, INGO kingpin with Italian passport joins LTTE as fighter, Zoa informs MoD of its project Manager's decision. The writers Shamindra Ferdinando and Norman Palihawadena sourced the claim of Giovannis joining the LTTE to Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapakse. It is also a telling comment on how the latter picks terrorists destined for removal.\n\nAs reported in the Islands sister paper Divaina, the Sri Lankan embassy in Italy wasted no time in petitioning the Italian government based on the Defence Secretarys allegation! Having charged recklessly to earn brownie points, they were stuck when the Italian government reportedly pointed out that the matter was very serious because the LTTE is banned in Italy, and called for the evidence that they might act. The Nation of 28th September 2008 carried the story announcing Giovannis deportation, Errant INGO manager ordered out. But the story below gave the facts correctly. It quoted ZOA Country Director Bernard Jaspers-Faijer declaring that claims of the individual having joined the LTTE were complete fabrications and that the staffer in question abhors violence of all kinds. His primary concern was leaving the civilians of the Wanni behind, in what he believed was their greatest time of need.\n\nJaspers-Faijer added that in the interest of transparency they told the Ministry of Defence that this gentleman was reluctant to leave, but that ZOA was doing everything possible to get him out of Kilinochchi ahead of the Ministrys September 29th deadline and even communicated to them that the aid worker was threatening to resign from ZOA, hoping that would enable him to remain in Kilinochchi.\n\nZOA had in fact persuaded Giovanni to leave the Vanni on 26th September, well before the Governments deadline. That would not have become an issue but for the rush of other expatriates to quit the Vanni and the Presidents brothers licence for rashness that costs him nothing.\n\nThe saddest part of the affair was that none of the INGOs or the UN, individually or otherwise, had a good word for Giovanni. That one or more individuals were attempting to cover themselves by giving Giovanni a bad name is evident in what the Nation (5 Oct.08) carried: NGO sources told The Nation that Puerto [sic] had been recognised as a deviant by more reputable organisations including the UN working in the Kilinochchi area \n\nIn the same issue, the writer cited a series of allegations thrown supposedly by a UN employee. Giovanni was described as a troublemaker given to overzealous remarks and behaviour who was kicked out of security meetings conducted by the UN and other INGOs in Killinochchi, and whose dealings were of a dubious nature. The reader was given no idea of the issues involved. The reports lack of substance was made up by gossip of a vile, personal nature, which we checked and found to be absolute slander.\n\nThe Nation report further said: According to senior government sources, the twin sagas of NPA and Puerto have given credence to what has thus far been dismissed as conspiracy theory. In fact, these sources reveal Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa [has warned] INGOs working in the Wanni that the government is fully aware of how NGOs operating in rebel held areas are aiding and abetting the LTTE.\n\nNo sane person would believe that the Norwegian Peoples Aid (NPA) that was demining in the Vanni would have gifted trucks and earth moving equipment to the LTTE. NPA told the IANS that it discovered the theft of its vehicles in Killinochchi on 24th July 2008 and did report the matter to the Nation Building and Infrastructure Development Ministry and both the Norwegian government and the NPA demanded that the LTTE return them. There is a dispute about whether the vehicles should have been moved out of the Vanni earlier, but that is a different matter.\n\nThis however has nothing to do with Giovanni. There has been as far as we know, no specific allegation against his organization, ZOA. Even in the Giovanni affair, no one in the Government has faulted the organisation on a lack of transparency. It takes a fevered imagination to blow this up into a conspiracy.\n\nThe difference is perhaps that most of the reputable organisations went along without reserve during the 20022005 peace process when the international community went all out to appease the LTTE ignoring the people and human rights in general. Today many of them are similarly complying with the Government, without putting up a fight on behalf of the people who are the victims of both the LTTE and the Government. Several influential governments evidently believe that the priority is to crush the LTTE or are prepared to stand aside and allow the Sri Lankan government to have a go at it regardless of the people.\n\nA word must be said here about the Nation and what its staff has been through. It used to be a good paper with some admirable investigative reporting. Once the Government became embroiled in the war and began issuing a succession of deadlines, it became very nervous of the Press and began threatening the media  a prerogative of the Defence Ministry.\n\nThe beginning of 2008 was ominous. Speaking to Irida Lankadeepa in January, the Defence Secretary called for full censorship of military matters, declaring there is no need to report anything on the military. On 2nd January 2008, Army Commander Fonseka told Dinamina that media refusing to toe the governments line were unpatriotic and the biggest obstacle to the Militarys war efforts.\n\nThe Nations defence correspondent and deputy editor Keith Noyahr in the issue of 11th May 2008 accused General Fonseka of favoritism in promotions and medals to senior officers and blamed one instance for a recent disaster in Jaffna. On 21st May, Noyahr was abducted and tortured before being dumped near his home, badly bruised. The regularity of such incidents despite the high security in Colombo left people in no doubt who was behind them. Despite initial defiance, the coverage of the Giovanni affair points to the paper having been brought round to the conformity demanded by its assailants.\n\nThese are conditions where individuals with a conscience who try to stand up for human rights and humanitarian principles, to which all governments pay lip service, become hopelessly isolated. And there is scant gratitude from the country for Giovanni Porta, who tried to ease the pain of civilians, inflicted in good measure by their own government.\n\n2.4. What should the Legacy of Humanitarian Agencies be?\n\nThe accusations against Giovanni in the local media also reflect the anger harboured against him by some humanitarian colleagues. Based on this the writer in the Nation delivered a stinging rebuke: Giovanni Puerto [sic] has left behind a lasting and dubious legacy for his colleagues still engaging in humanitarian work in Sri Lanka.\n\nPersons close to government and NGO circles in the Vanni told us that accusations against Giovanni stem from his setting new horizons for humanitarian work which several others disagreed with. He was strong on matters like catering to the displaced in places that they found safe rather than insist on the places being more accessible to relief staff. He was never thrown out of any security meeting. He was in fact the security coordinator  the focal figure for all relief staff on security matters.\n\nWhen humanitarian agencies were asked to leave the Vanni, Giovanni understandably argued against haste. Being in the Vanni was not something humanly easy to cope with. The BBC feature article Pain of Sri Lanka aid pull out (23 Sept.08) says:\n\nI remember one morning when an air attack happened very close to me. I managed to get into the bunker quickly and narrowly escaped being hurt. I will never forget the noise of that fighter jet, the unbelievable sound of the engine as it swooped from the sky and the explosions of the bombs dropped close by.\n\nBut the lasting image I have is of the sheer panic and traumatised people when I emerged. As aid agencies we have concrete fortified bunkers, but the population of Kilinochchi has muddy holes in the ground. I saw children shaking with fear and mothers trying to calm them while they themselves were shaking with fear.\n\nFor the final two days in Kilinochchi we spent much time in our bunkers as the artillery and air attacks intensified in and around the town. The sound through these days was tremendous, everything would shake and the air implode as the shells landed I remember feeling deep shame as I drove past civilians who were watching me from the side of the road, in my ballistic vest, heading for safety, as they stood there in their trousers and shirts and saris There is the pain and guilt of saying goodbye and good luck to our staff who had worked so hard and with such passion for the victims of war in the Vanni - and leaving them behind.\n\nGiovanni had the courage to follow the calling of a non-violent soldier to want to stay through this, until 10 days later when he was persuaded that there was no possibility of his staying on. Not all of us have the courage to follow such a course and cannot be expected to. But the least we could do is not to calumniate those who take their calling to empathise with and serve victims of man-made disasters, as binding them to the victims, with a tie that goes beyond the vagaries of bureaucratic decisions.\n\nIt does not look good on the humanitarian community when it is silent while a few have used the press to harm Giovanni. When there is an attempt to isolate those like him who try to set high standards and hold them out to derision, it condemns humanitarian action to lower standards and leave behind too poor a legacy to build on. It would not be one that would challenge, uplift and give dignity to those who are down. It would leave the victims at the mercy of armed parties whose goals have nothing to do with their welfare.\n\nBoth parties to the conflict have studied the politics of humanitarian agencies and have learnt to bully and tame them although the parties spend hardly a cent on the welfare of the victims. Many see the Giovanni affair as one where the Government delivers a few exemplary knocks to expatriates to cater to its xenophobic political following and tames leading agencies to toe the line, without upsetting the flow of aid. The ACF massacre of 17 local aid workers was a point where several of the leading aid agencies lost their way.\n\nWhen the 17 locals were killed, many NGO members wanted either a strong protest or a temporary work stoppage to renegotiate humanitarian terms with the Government in the interests of their work. This was stopped by a number of key people from a few INGOs contending that the humanitarian imperative comes first, even though nothing would have been lost if rehabilitation work was stopped for a few days. A concerned foreigner who followed the discussion remarked indignantly, Would they have been so passive had one foreigner been killed instead of 17 locals? Strangely today, many INGOs and UN staff are criticising Giovanni for actually standing up for the humanitarian imperative. Now as, many feel, humanitarian principles dont seem to matter anymore.\n\nThe first anniversary of the ACF massacre observed by humanitarian staff on 6th August 2007 was again one where Human Rights Minister Samarasinghe was allowed to take the stage and deliver an offensively political speech after the solemn tone set by UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. John Holmes. Samarasinghe praised the Australian expert Dr. Dodd in trying to exonerate the Government from the crime. Dodd had very questionably retracted his earlier identification of a bullet type (see Special Reports Nos.27&30). The Minister tried to detract from the cold-blooded massacre of aid workers and the question of the States accountability by referring to others who died  in fact they died mainly from government shelling.\n\nThe Minister was given the stage after it was generally known that the Government was responsible for the massacre and the Minister was part of the cover-up. Many of those in the audience were seething with anger at the Ministers misappropriation of the occasion and badly wanted to hoot him down. But they held their peace out of fear because the television cameras were turned on. Unbelievably though, the Minister had, we understand, been invited to speak by the representative of the UN OCHA (Office of the Commissioner for Humanitarian Affairs).\n\nMost INGOs blamed the ACF for having left its local workers in Mutur at that time of conflict. Yet practically all local staff of the UN and INGOs remain in the Vanni. The Defence Secretary has said that he was trying to avoid a repeat of the killing of the 17 local aid workers in Mutur from Action Contre la Faim in August 2006. The Daily Mirror (8 Sept.08) quoted the Defence Secretary saying, We don't want to get into a situation like that, so we are giving (the aid groups) adequate notice. It is in fact the local staff of the ACF who were killed. What is then the point of the Defence Ministry, the UN and INGOs agreeing to pull out the expatriate staff from the Vanni, leaving the local staff in the same position as their ACF counterparts in Mutur?\n\nIn an earlier report (Special Report No.30) we have demonstrated that the killing of the 17 aid workers was carried out by two police constables and a Muslim home guard in the presence of commandos from the Special Forces, and circumstantial factors point to the orders having come from DIG Rohan Abeywardene and SSP Kapila Jayasekere based in Trincolmalee. Thus if the objective of the Defence Secretary is to avoid targeted killings by the State of aid workers, a more effective method of ensuring the safety of aid workers would be to assist in the investigation and prosecution of the those responsible for the killing of the ACF aid workers and simultaneously to order all members of the security forces to not kill aid workers.\n\n2.5. The Art of Controlling the UN\n\nWe pointed out above how the local office of the UN OCHA invited Minister Samarasinghe to take the stage on the occasion of the first anniversary of the ACF massacre, and the audience of humanitarian staff though angry was in no position to protest. The OCHA set up office in Lanka after the December 2004 tsunami, when its role was uncontroversial. That changed after the war commenced in April 2006 resulting in a rising incidence of displacement, where the State was the party most culpable. It became a humanitarian problem from which human rights could not be isolated  such as in shelling, abduction, killings of displaced persons, night harassment in refugee camps etc. Once the OCHA started doing its job, the Government started accusing it of human rights monitoring, while accusing all relief agencies of aiding the LTTE.\n\nUN agencies in general started being overcautious to the point of compromising their mandate. Many Tamil refugees from Mutur were by late 2006 in refugee camps in Trincomalee. The Government while giving assurances to the contrary began forcibly deporting them not to their homes, but to camps in Killiveddy where they were kept out of sight. UN agencies objected. On 2nd December 2006, the security forces commenced the forcible deportation of 66 families at Cultural Hall, Trincomalee. We learn that the UNHCR restricted the movements of its staff in Trincomalee for the apparent reason of the attempt on the Defence Secretarys life in Colombo the previous day. Some staff were allowed to travel between the office and their residences, but were told not to stop at the Cultural Hall, which was on the way, where forcible deportations were in progress.\n\nNext the OCHA worked with other agencies and NGOs to compile an inter-agency report on displacement. The Government watched with alarm. Thalif Deen from the UN wrote in the Sunday Times of 22nd April 2007 under the item  OCHA to be booted out: A letter, to be sent to the UN office in Colombo, says that OCHA is overstaying its mandate. The UN's Office of Humanitarian Affairs came to Sri Lanka primarily for post-tsunami rehabilitation but has continued to stay under various new guises way outside their mandate. The government, which is also livid that OCHA wants to play the role of a human rights monitor, has told the UN humanitarian body that this is not acceptable as there are other more appropriate agencies to do this. But none was permitted in Lanka.\n\nIn the resulting exchange, the OCHA buckled down. This is seen in the fate of the Inter Agency Standing Committee (IASC) report Conflict Related Internal Displacement in Sri Lanka: A study on forced displacement, freedom of movement, return and relocation covering 6th April 2006 to 6th April 2007. We learn the OCHA, which was tasked with releasing the report, delayed by at least a month to 15th July 2007.\n\nMany organisations and individuals who worked hard in compiling the report hoped that it would lead to an international debate on the issues of displacement and protection. The delay meant that immediacy was lost, and some window dressing had been done in the sequel. When the report said that there have been some improvements in the protection of IDPs it only meant that the worst was over. The fact is that many of them had become permanent refugees with the Government having no intention of giving back their land. The grave and protracted abuse of their rights was lost sight of. The effect of the report, which documented their shocking experiences, was largely muffled.\n\nIt was three weeks after the release of the report that the OCHA invited the Human Rights Minister to address the ACF anniversary observance. One of the OCHAs immediate problems was that it needed to fill some positions, and needed the Ministers goodwill to facilitate their visas.\n\nThe manner in which the Government cowed other UN agencies is similar. On 3rd June 2007 two members of the Red Cross in Batticaloa were abducted from Fort Railway Station, taken in a white van and their bodies were dumped near Ratnapura. On 3rd July 2007, the humanitarian community organised a vigil at the Railway Station. That the UN was, rightly, party to the vigil is seen from the full coverage given to the event in the UN OCHAs Integrated Regional Information Network (IRIN) under the title SRI LANKA: No tangible progress in investigations into murdered aid workers.\n\nSome members of the UNICEF attended the vigil. That quickly became a screaming issue for Sinhalese extremist groups close to the President. In November 2007, in the wake of allegations by Weerawansa, who was then in the JVP, that UNICEF had aided the LTTE with funds and precooked combat meals, the state-controlled Sunday Observer (25 Nov.07) carried the following:\n\nAt a meeting, UNICEF country representative Phillipe Duamelle was requested by acting Foreign Secretary T. B. Maduwegedara to take appropriate action against some staff members who participated in a public protest here, organised by a local human rights group to condemn the killing of two Red Cross workers by unidentified gunmen. Duamelle assured the Sri Lankan official of appropriate and stern action against the staff members, including the withdrawal of the concerned international staff and the termination of the local staff, the Foreign Ministry said.\n\nWe have here a further indication of a UN agency lacking the will to stand up for its staff members doing what the management encouraged them to do. We learn that a notice of the vigil for the slain Red Cross workers was sent to all staff by the senior management of UNICEF in Lanka. Another manager, not the Chief, followed this up with an email encouraging the staff to participate. This was in agreement with the OCHAs support for the vigil. This second manager himself attended the vigil, but his name did not appear in the media. Only they whose names appeared in the Press or the government media and were still in Lanka at the time the Government brought up the issue in November 2007, were penalised.\n\nUNICEF could instead have argued that its employees, or foreigners in general, attending human rights events as a mark of universal solidarity had hitherto not been an issue in Lanka. Here is a government harping on sovereignty to penalise foreigners, without any commitment to investigate what is a crime in international law. Few seem to be able to point out that such use of sovereignty makes it too tattered to deserve respect. The LTTE has in instances abused the Red Cross. But such arbitrary justice should not be tolerated.\n\nThe use of continuous wild allegations which keep the UN and other aid agencies on pins, worrying about their security and right to serve, are part of the means of controlling them and it appears to have largely worked. The Defence Ministry web site (defence.lk) carried on 19th April 2008 an item reflective of the Defence Secretarys mind and the chaotic state of governance, speculating that OCHA had acceded to an LTTE request to do propaganda work for it:\n\n the LTTE has been able to fund its bloodshed in Sri Lanka mostly through effective false propaganda campaigns conducted with the help of unscrupulous INGOs. At present, the dollar vultures of such vicious INGOs are equally anxious as the LTTE that their War of Fortune will be ended. defence.lk does not wish to comment whether the UNOCHA officials or the above-mentioned INGO representatives had agreed to carryout the orders of LTTE's megalomaniac leadership or not. Only their future actions would prove their integrity.\n\nThe message is, toe the line. The problems of many of these organisations began when, during the ceasefire, they were encouraged by donor countries to undertake projects jointly with the LTTE and to turn a blind eye to its abuses. The Government is now using methods of control not dissimilar to the LTTEs.\n\nOne begins to understand why the high hopes pinned on the UN Human Rights Council to take a stand and the prospect of UN human rights monitoring to curb abuses in Lanka came to nothing. One is also amazed by the lack of a single policy with common ethically based positions by the UN as a whole in Lanka. In this ambience the Government was able to isolate and virtually punish organisations like the International Commission of Jurists that took an independent interest in the ACF case. The Government literally gets away with murder.\n\nPart III: The Drive for Hegemony and Debilitation of the North-East: Cases and Reports\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n3.1. Introduction. 1\n\n3.2.

Introduction\n\nIn retrospect early signs of the deluge of impunity were evident by January 2006, but we had been complacent. The execution of the five Tamil students on the Trincomalee sea front in January 2006, the undermining of the Commission of Inquiry into the ACF and other cases through the combined efforts of the Ministry of Defence, AGs office and lawyers of like ideological frame, is perceived by the Tamils as a signal that they must be resigned to living in a Sinhalese hegemonic order. The cooperation of most arms of the security forces in Trincomalee in the sea front atrocity was a cue for killings to proceed on lines aimed at instilling a new source of fear into the minorities and rendering them docile. This was also the aim of killing 10 Muslim labourers in Pottuvil in September 2006. The statements the Army Commander repeatedly made to the media speaks for the present regimes mindset. He told the Canada National Post (23 Sept. 08):\n\nI strongly believe that this country belongs to the Sinhalese but there are minorities and we treat them like our people. We being the majority of the country, 75%, we will never give in and we have the right to protect this country We are also a strong nation They can live in this country with us. But they must not try to, under the pretext of being a minority, demand undue things.\n\nWhen people of such mind believe, like LTTE leader Prabhakaran, that they have a god-given right to murder and do what it takes to ensure that their putative country remains the property of their tribe, the unthinkable is to be expected. Previous governments have killed and indulged in ethnic violence. But they have refrained from touching elected members of Parliament. We have said that the State was responsible for the killing of two Tamil MPs and ex-MP Sivamaharajah. We have since learnt from well-placed sources that the Army Commander and the Defence Secretary were present at the Security Council meeting in late 2005 where it was decided to kill Batticaloa MP Joseph Pararajasingham. A second MP, Raviraj, was killed in November 2006.\n\nThe MPs killed were not less or more opportunistic than the run of MPs anywhere. But they had considerable acceptance among the people. For the Government to target them is like foreclosing any prospect of talking to representatives of the Tamil people. The public killing of the five students nine days later had the same kind of tribal inspiration coming from the top.\n\nThe trend was towards terrorising the minorities; eliminating prospective voices in their defence and to render them as people insensible of their rights and dignity. The menacing trend could also be discerned in the killing in Trincomalee District of Sivapragasam Mariyathas of the Socialist Equality Party (7 Aug.06) and Balachandran, an auto rickshaw driver and former member PLOTE (24 Aug.08). These persons were seen as contributing to the morale of Tamils in the District, just when there was an ideological thrust to crush them by fear and murder. They had no links to the LTTE. The recent killing of Sivakugarajah, the priest of Koneswaram temple in Trincomalee, falls into this category.\n\nThe Government had hit upon a novel idea; it would first sweep away all natural representatives of the Tamils capable of a measure of independence. It would then choose as Tamil leaders, persons who had enough skeletons in their cupboard to guarantee obeisance, and take them on trips to any country that would have them, as a show of Tamil support. For its dubious goals, the Government kept these selected leaders in a continual game of snakes and ladders.\n\nA very telling sign of repression in the East is in the way the Eastern and South Eastern Universities are run. Armed security has been placed inside ostensibly to protect newly inducted Sinhalese students, and the university authorities and staff are themselves under constant surveillance. Students no longer feel that these are places where minds are free and one could talk freely at least to some. Attendance has dropped. The Tigers had their surveillance, but it was not so intrusive as policemen all over. Why should the Government do this in the East after supposedly liberating it? There is a much bigger game being played there, which is inimical to the minorities and the Government is trying to ensure that these universities do not become active in mobilising protest.\n\nIn the East where the Governments public relations men boast of development and the restoration of democracy, there is greater fear, uncertainty and a deliberate cultivation of communal tensions. The people had learnt to cope with the LTTEs terror and conscription of their children. At least one knew what to expect and the disruption of economic life was limited.\n\nThe scale of repression may be discerned from the killings and disappearances. Of late the LTTE has boosted infiltration into all areas of the North-East. The overall killing rate is above one a day. The ratio of killings by the Government and allies to killings by the LTTE is going by news reports roughly 15: 5. What it offhand suggests is that the Government whose link to the Tamil people is through some dubious actors is killing many innocent Tamils in the guise of fighting the LTTE.\n\nBut the fact is that a great deal doesnt get reported. In Vavuniya alone, the rate of disappearance based on officially recorded complaints is about one a day. It is a place saturated with state forces and paramilitaries. The total killing and disappearance is a couple a day. This is hardly surprising given Vavuniyas large displaced population and the fear to report. An activist told us that if a displaced woman goes to a shop and an armed element sees her on the road and orders her to get on to the pillion of his motor cycle, she has no choice. She is abused and dropped back sometime later. That is the only way she could protect her family. Protecting honour ensures the men do not talk about it.\n\nHerding in queues, held for a day without food or water, being registered, photographed and held up long at checkpoints, are means to breaking a people down. And then their houses are intruded into; people are removed and often killed. In one case in the East that received some publicity, the photographs and details obtained for security purposes were used to target women for brutal sexual orgies.\n\nThe conditions in Vavuniya, where the Government hopes to house the people in the Vanni in virtual prisons gives some idea of what they are in for. Added to what the LTTE has done in conscripting their sons and daughters, the combined effect, without exaggeration, would be tantamount to the end of a proud people.\n\nThere was fear under the LTTE, but now there is terror, violence and extreme uncertainty under the much travestied label of democracy. The natures of internal terror and external terror and their dynamism have been regularly discussed in our reports. The first destroys the soul of the community and the latter creates continuous uncertainty and fear; both take away hope and dignity from the people. That is why for us the choice is not between an LTTE victory and a Government victory. Both are obnoxious in their aims and inimical for the people. Any evil ultimately burns itself out. We could only hope and pray that the suffering of the people would be brief, followed by a dawn of fresh hope.\n\nIn our past reports we have given more detail to exemplify the trends. We give a few cases here to show that if anything the human rights situation is deteriorating with signs of it getting worse. We do not minimise the importance of complete documentation. But the task is so demanding that it needs to be undertaken by organisations with the dedicated resources. It may not even be possible in the current climate of terror. Inquiring into an individual case is much more demanding and frustrating than it was two years ago and one is left with the uncomfortable feeling of being a source of danger to someone. One feels truly humble before those who are willing to expose violators under these perilous conditions.\n\nThe present Government has been given plenty of rope by the international community and India  a fact reflected in the weakness of the UN as regards its missions in Lanka. But sooner rather than later they will make up their mind on what really is going on in this country. The killings of civilians by the State and its associates as we have indicated are far out of proportion to pass off as collateral damage, if the aim is to combat the LTTE. Most of the victims are innocent. One then begins to suspect that killing is a means to terrorise and decimate the minorities, adding to the enormous damage LTTE has done, so that they do not as the Army Commander put it demand undue things.\n\nTo describe the position of minorities in Lanka as that of second-class citizens is a gross overstatement. Second class citizens may be discriminated against, but they enjoy the protection of the rule of law to some extent. Where Tamils stand with regard to the rule of law at present is exemplified in the fate that overtook two Tamils in Batticaloa detained during a security operation to prepare for the Chief Justices visit.\n\nWe also record here the fate of another group of Tamils not protected by the rule of law in Ceylon - Lanka although their rights were clearly defined in international law:\n\nI have been witness to one of the cruellest chapters in this saga which saw the marginalising, pauperisation and death of the almost 750,000 repatriates (people of Indian origin) from Sri Lanka during the '70s and the '80s. In two phases, under the Shastri-Sirimavo Pact of 1964 and the Indira-Sirimavo Pact of 1974, three-quarter of a million 'stateless people' of Sri Lanka  the descendents of the 19th and early 20th century indentured labourers to the tea plantations  were lock-stock-and barrel repatriated to Tamil Nadu in one of the most infamous instances of human engineering in recent times. The reception they had from fellow-Tamils was less than human. It has been documented that they were rapidly dispossessed of their meagre belongings. A few found 'jobs' in the exploitative special 'rehabilitation' schemes created by the state government. A conservative estimate by a fact-finding team surmised that at least 25% died within the first three years of landing in India, of starvation. It is a memory that cannot be erased. (Sadanand Menon, Business Standard, 20 Oct.2008)\n\nFor this, the Ceylon Tamils, their leaders and the British must also share in the shame. The country has been cursed ever since.\n\n3.2. Vavuniya\n\nThe Misery that is Vavuniya: Vavuniya has long been the border town at the entry to the North. In the old days, those travelling to Jaffna used to be psychologically relieved when the train from Colombo steamed into Vavuniya. They had passed the region that saw communal violence and humiliation of their compatriots. It was the town where its one time MP, Prof. C. Suntheralingam, organised Tamils with hunting rifles to hold the frontier against mobs during the communal violence of 1958. Today it holds no comfort for Tamils. It is a militarised town bristling with government and paramilitary troops, and having ready LTTE infiltration, where life could be short and women live in fear. It is where the Government hopes to house the Vanni population in virtual prisons. The violence there is so routine and we would only illustrate its flavour, which is marked by killing and abuse of women.\n\nThe Murder of two women, Vairava Puliyankulam, Vavuniya, 22nd September 2008: The two women Sivasankari and Devika were neighbours. Gunmen, whom locals believe came for Sivasankari, left after killing both women  Devika apparently because she looked out of her house. There was no doubt that the killers were from the security forces or their paramilitary allies. Initial speculation was that Sivasankari had been suspected of sheltering LTTE suicide commandos who attacked the Vavuniya base in the early hours of 8th September 2008. Further inquiries into the background of the two women showed that this was out of the question.\n\nSivasankari was originally from Karainagar, Jaffna, which her family left for Kandy in 1985 after some militant group demanded a large sum of money from them. She was educated in Kandy and then lived in Colombo. She had no contact with the North-East. She was employed by a state bank and went to Vavuniya only because she had been posted there. Those in Vavuniya rule out her having had any link with the LTTE.\n\nDevika was from Nedunkerni. She had come to Vavuniya, according to locals, with the intention of going to Canada where she was to be married to her fiancé. She was regarded an innocent woman.\n\nFurther inquiry yielded a story in the grapevine with a variation. According to this, Sivasankari and Devika were friends, and a youth from a party in the democratic stream for some years wanted to marry Devika, and her refusal led to her being killed. Sivasankari according to this version was killed because she had come to her friends assistance and had seen the killer.\n\nThe truth behind the killing is hard to judge at short notice and such are often passed off as killings of LTTE sympathisers. There is so much impunity and so many questions jostling about and anyone connected with the security forces has the licence to kill. A young man who was picked up on suspicion and served time in prison met many dregs of war. He learnt that Military Intelligence has distributed pistols to all kinds of subterranean elements in Vavuniya. They include ex-militants and deserters from the LTTE for whom there is no honest way to survive. Most of the killings they do are on instructions from their handlers, but a small fraction for their own ends.\n\nArutchothy (44), 27th September 2008: Arutchothy was shot dead at Paataali Puliyankulam, Vavuniya around 11.00 PM. One version we were able to gather is that she was killed when she screamed at intruders with guns who came home in the night.\n\nSexual Violence Against Women: A source we have absolutely no reason to doubt, said that several instances of rape have taken place in Tamil villages north of Vavuniya. The source did not want to disclose more specific details, but said that security men enter houses in the nights. They come in large groups or groups of two or three and force the women to go with them and drop them back in the morning. Some groups of security men are Sinhalese speaking while Tamil speakers have also been observed in groups that came to abduct the women. The number of women victims he had knowledge of was about 20, some of whom were pregnant after the ordeal. We checked this with another Tamil person in Vavuniya, whom we think honestly, denied that there was anything happening on such a scale. When we received such a report more than a year ago, we checked with a leading citizen in Vavuniya, who felt that it was an exaggeration. We believe in the integrity of our first source as also substantiated below. It is also in the nature of affected parties to seek help discreetly and would fear going to the Police. No family or village would like to admit such trauma within. A quiet marriage to an understanding man would be the preferred solution for an unmarried woman.\n\nThe Civil Society Field Mission in September 2008 gives an idea of the gravity of the problem when it quotes an NGO in Vavuniya, which has documented 14 cases of sexual violence in August 2008, on women between the ages of 12 and 35. It mentions as perpetrators, members of para-militant groups working with the Security Forces. The report also cites other aspects of the vulnerability of women in the militarised environment, such as women going missing when looking for missing kin. Our next report further highlights this problem.\n\nA Detainees Ordeal: A young man was detained by the security forces in Vavuniya and taken to what was evidently a large camp. In the night he was walked from one building to another. The night air was rent by screams of persons being tortured. What gripped him most were the screams of defenceless women. He too was tortured and later made his escape when being transferred to another place, and lived to tell the tale.\n\n3.3. The Murder of Journalist Thevakumar, Jaffna, 28th May 2008\n\nParanirupasingham Thevakumar (34) was the Jaffna reporter for Sakthi TV based in Colombo. While returning home to Vaddukottai from Jaffna about 4.00 PM, he was accosted in Kakkaitivu, a lonely stretch between Jaffna and Araly and hacked to death His pillion rider, Mahenthiran Varathan died later in Jaffna Hospital. The instinctive reaction of the Jaffna public was to blame the LTTE for the killing. The reason being that just a short time before his death, Sakthi TV had relayed a mass function organised in the Jaffna esplanade by EPDP leader and minister Douglas Devananda, a bitter opponent of the LTTE, with Jaffnas military top brass in attendance. The festival was aired widely abroad. Thevakumar had played a prominent role as announcer.\n\nThis instinctive decision that the LTTE was responsible has not changed over the succeeding months. The Jaffna public was hardly ever wrong. Asked recently, observers pointed out it is so obvious that neither Sakthi TV nor the community of journalists in Jaffna, paid more than token heed to Thevakumars murder. This they said was minuscular in comparison to the publicity Sakthi gave the antics of Minister Mervyn Silva. A fact not given much publicity is that the pillion rider who also died was the son of Valluvan, a senior member of the EPDP.\n\nOne keen observer cautioned us against the conclusion that the LTTE were the killers, even if that is what the journalists, the public and his employer believe. He had known Thevakumar. Once the Army had suspected him and had taken custody of his identity card to restrict his movements. Later they gave it back, but obviously had their eye on him. This observer said that he later received confirmed information that the LTTE communicated with Thevakumar, and he was probably used in their communication network. Upon this knowledge, he distanced himself from Thevakumar. He had his doubts about the LTTE being the killers. Months later, he confessed that he had not been able to resolve his doubts.\n\nAs with most journalists in his situation, Thevakumars work was delicate, with several parties trying to use him and to control what he said. And there was the ambient terror from several quarters. One could not directly say No to anyone. That was how one had to negotiate ones existence.\n\n3.4. The Murder of Sivakururaja Kurukkal of Koneswaram, Trincomalee, 21st Sept. 2008\n\nSivakururaja, a Brahmin from Thickham, between Pt. Pedro and Valvettithurai in the North of Sri Lanka, was a dedicated Tamil nationalist and had joined the TELO in the mid-1980s, the group founded by Kuttimani and Thangathurai in which Prabhakaran was for sometime a member. After July 1983, many young boys spontaneously joined one militant group or another. After the LTTE decimated the TELO in 1986, Sivakururaja began practicing his hereditary vocation and in 1994 became the priest of the countrys most prestigious Hindu Temple  Koneswaram. As it was situated in Fort Frederick, which functioned as the regional Military HQ, the people had been reluctant to go there for regular poojas in the early 1990s. Sivakururaja by his energy revived regular worship at the temple. Since most Buddhists readily worshipped Hindu gods, the temple maintained in general the goodwill of soldiers and officers.\n\nAfter the tsunami and the erection of the illegal Buddha statue in front of the fish market with the connivance of the navy chief in Trincomalee, the old agenda of stamping a Sinhalese Buddhist character on Trincomalee received a major boost from the election of Mahinda Rajapakse as president in November 2005. The appointment of an ideological compatriot, General T.T.R. de Silva Rtd., as Government Agent (Trincomalee), the displacement of the Tamil population of Mutur East, the creation of a Special Economic Zone preventing the return of the displaced Tamils to their homes and the administrative launching of Eastern Revival, with a patently Sinhalisation agenda, placed the minorities at the receiving end. It gave a new impetus for the appropriation of temple properties and over time giving these areas a Sinhalese-Buddhist character.\n\nIllankaithurai on the coast of Mutur East for example, had two temples on either side  Palamukan Alayam and Kall"
