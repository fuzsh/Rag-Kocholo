Therefore his/ her statement of joining the mainstream politics and giving up terrorism and condemning terrorism and terrorist organizations are nothing but eyewash.\n\n* It is, in fact, a ploy to enter the country and to again regroup the terrorist organizations. These people cannot be trusted.\n\nGiven below the full text of the Final Submission:\n\nSubmission before Presidential Commission to Investigate into Complaints Regarding Missing Persons\n\nDate: 05 August 2014 at 3 Pm.\n\nVenue: at the Commission's office located at No: 9/8, Suranimala Place, Colombo- 6.\n\nBefore:\n\nChairman - Maxwell Parakrama Paranagama,\n\nCommissioner - Madam Manohari Ramanathan &\n\nCommissioner - Madam Dimingu Badathuruge Priyanthi Su-ranjana Vidyaratna\n\nThe Sri Lankan military encamped in Batticaloa and in other parts of Jaffna, and they resented being confined to the base. Tension between the LTTE and the army began to increase in the latter part of May 1990 and culminated in the early part of June. During this period, the army found to their utter dismay that the LTTE was constructing bunkers and implementing other defense measures close to their camps. When this matter was brought to the notice of the Defense Ministry, instructions were given for them to carry on as before - to eat and sleep inside the camps without interfering with the LTTE.\n\nOne noteworthy incident took place close to an army camp in Batticaloa in the first week of June. The army arrested two LTTE cadres and they were ordered to kneel on the road opposite their camp in the scorching sun for over six hours, amid bantering and other sorts of humiliation from the watching army personnel. One LTTE cadre bit his cyanide vial and died. Subsequently, the other was beaten and sent away.\n\nIncidents of this nature were reported to the LTTE leaders in Jaffna and they served to inflame the LTTE.\n\nMeanwhile, Sinhala and English newspapers in Colombo began to unleash a venomous campaign against the LTTE and against the Government for being soft with them.\n\nThe army, having quelled the JVP (Janata Vimukthi Perumuna) uprising in the South, was proud of its achievements. Similarly, the LTTE, which took on the mighty Indian army and which had been engaged in the duel for 20- long torturous months, was celebrating the final departure of the Indian army; so they were equally proud of their achievements. Gradually, tension began to mount between the LTTE and the Army.\n\nOn June 7, a group of army personnel proceeding by vehicle from Vavuniya to Mullaithievu were fired at by the LTTE at Thandikulam. One soldier was killed and nine were injured.\n\nAccording to reports, the soldiers from the Gajabahu regiment did not retaliate; instead they complained of the incident to the authorities. They received instructions that the troops must be patient and must not retaliate against the LTTE.\n\nWhile these incidents were taking place, Minister Shahul Hemeed, the Government's chief negotiator, was in Jaffna. Hameed flew to Jaffna with his delegation on June 7 and had discussions with the LTTE in a house just behind the Nallur Kandaswamy temple, Jaffna.\n\nOn June 10, 1990, in one fateful incident, a Muslim youth was found in a compromising position with a Sinhala woman, in a refugee camp in Batticaloa town. The enraged husband assaulted the youth before taking him to the police, who locked him up and tortured him.\n\nThe police were not aware that the arrested Muslim was a tailor, and that he stitched the uniforms of the LTTE. At about 9.30 in the evening armed LTTE cadres arrived at the police station, alleging that the police had assaulted the Muslim youth. The cadres demanded his release.\n\nThe LTTE were told that the youth had been sent to hospital, but the LTTE did not believe this and they abducted two Tamil policemen who were on sentry duty outside. They also threatened that all the policemen in the station would be chased out if the tailor was not released immediately.\n\nOn the following day, at 6 am, LTTE cadres surrounded the Batticaloa police station and abducted three armed policemen. An hour later, nearly 250 armed LTTE cadres surrounded the station and occupied it. On the orders of the LTTE, the Sinhala policemen and their families were sent to the airport, where they were accommodated at the air force base. The Tamil policemen and their families left for St Mary's Church in Batticaloa town. The acting Officer-in-Charge and four other policemen were detained. The LTTE also removed Rs 45,000,000 in cash, gold jewelry and a cache of firearms: 109 T 56 rifles; 77 T 84 S rifles; 28 light machine guns; 29 self-loading rifles; 65 sub machine guns; 78 .303 rifles and 78 SAR 80 guns.\n\nOn June 11, the Tigers ordered police personnel in the Eastern province to vacate all police stations with their families by 2.30 PM or face the consequences. The information available was that police headquarters in Colombo instructed the policemen to surrender to the LTTE. But by noon hundreds of policemen and their families had streamed into security force camps and air force camps. In Batticaloa, the Tigers arranged refugee accommodation for Tamil policemen in a nearby school. Sinhalese refugees were taken to air force bases.\n\nMeanwhile, a total of 899 police personnel were abducted by the LTTE. About 125 of them escaped from the LTTE. Subsequently it became clear that almost all the policemen had been killed by the Tigers in cold blood. They were lined up and shot with their hands tied behind. Assistant Superintendent of Police Ivan Boteju refused to surrender and kept on fighting the LTTE, until he was ordered to surrender. Police officers laid down their arms after being promised safe conduct and release.\n\nAt Kalmunai, the Tigers engaged an army convoy, killing 10 soldiers. At Kalmunai and Kalawnachikudi police stations, fierce fighting raged before the policemen surrendered. At Kalmunai, eight policemen were reported killed. The LTTE also suffered casualties - two killed and 17 injured, according to reports.\n\nMost police stations appeared to have surrendered without a fight. By the end of the day, the Tigers were in control of a number of stations, including Batticaloa, Vellaveli, Kalmunai, Valachenai, Kalawnchikudi, Samanthurai, Eravur and Akkarapattu.\n\nAccording to reports, 324 of the police officers who surrendered were Sinhalese and Muslims and they were taken to the jungle in Tirukovil, blindfolded, their hands tied behind, made to lie down on the ground and shot.\n\nIt became known that the LTTE abducted and killed about 600 Sinhalese and Muslim police officers from Batticaloa and Amparai districts. A further 78 were abducted from Trincomalee district and murdered.\n\nThe LTTE cadres also stormed police stations in the Jaffna district and ordered the policemen to leave at Kankesanthurai,\n\nValvetiturai, Point Pedro, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya and Murunkan. On the same evening, the LTTE launched an attack on an army detachment at Vallavadi in Amparai. The army retaliated. Due to heavy LTTE fire, the Navy evacuated the troops and Sinhala fishermen to Trincomalee. Also, a detachment at Kalwanchikudi was attacked. The Sri Lankan Air Force was summoned and planes fired at the attacking LTTE cadres. Three soldiers were killed due to LTTE fire. Similarly, a detachment at Kalmunai came under fire. Air and artillery fire support was made available. Two soldiers were killed in the attack.\n\nOn June 14, the army detachment at Kilinochchi came under heavy attack. Troops fought effectively with artillery and air support. On the same day, around midnight, the LTTE attacked an army detachment at Thalaimannar old pier. Seven soldiers were killed and 11 reported missing. Also, the LTTE attacked a mobile army patrol sent out from Vavuniya, at Marathanamadu, on June 15. In the battle, five soldiers were killed and the driver of the vehicle reported missing.\n\nOn June 14, the LTTE captured the police stations at Mankulam and Odduchuddan. The LTTE continued to attack Jaffna Fort and encircled the Northern Security Forces Headquarters.\n\nOn June 15, the LTTE attacked the police stations at Elephant Pass in the Jaffna district and Mud Cove in the Trincomalee district. Also, the LTTE attacked army camps at Elephant Pass, Muttur, Kinniya, Kiran, Kaluwanchikudy, and the central camps at Amparai and Talaimannr in Mannar district.\n\nIn the meantime, Hameed flew again to Jaffna for further negotiations. He met Anton Balasingham in Nallur. That evening, Hameed flew back to Colombo and met President Premadasa and took up several issues raised by the LTTE during the Nallur talks.\n\nAgain, on June 16, Hameed flew back to Jaffna to continue negotiations with the Tigers, but was unable to meet them on that day or thereafter as LTTE fire was directed towards Palaly and Jaffna Fort.\n\nWhen, on June 11, 1990, the LTTE broke the ceasefire it had entered into with the Government in June 1989, the army camps on the Northern Province including Kokavil, Mankulam in the Mullaithievu district and Killinochchi and camps west of Mankulam, which included Kondachchi and Silavathurai, were abandoned, leaving the army with detachments at Mullaithievu, Mannar, Elephant Pass, Pooneryn, Vettilaikerni, Idaikadu, Jaffna Fort and Palaly, and also those of Weli-Oya and later Kankesanthurai, and the islands located off the Jaffna Peninsula.\n\nThe LTTE gained control of a vast track of the Northern Province. Also, the LTTE thus managed to cut off the land route to Jaffna Peninsula; this resulted in supplies and men having to be transported to army bases either by sea or air.\n\nThe LTTE has not come forward to explain why it had launched a full scale military campaign from June 11.\n\nThe exact reasons for the resumption of hostilities, the launching of Eelam War-2 had not been fully and officially explained by the LTTE.\n\nSimilarly, the Government has failed to come up with an official explanation as to why Earnest Perera, the Inspector General of Police, instructed police in the Eastern Province to surrender to the LTTE. The country had only heard rumors that Perera had acted on the orders and instructions of Hameed. According to police records, nearly 1,000 policemen surrendered to the LTTE and 630 were still missing.\n\nAttack by the LTTE on June 11, 1990, marked the renewal of the armed conflict in the country. The LTTE continued to unleash its superior firepower against numerous police stations and army detachments in the North and Eastern provinces. On June 18, 1990, the Minister of State for Defense, Ranjan Wijeratne, announced on the floor of Parliament, \"From now on, it is all out war and no half ways.\"\n\nThe Government quickly moved military reinforcements into the areas that came under LTTE attack. Gradually hostilities escalated.\n\nIt was said that Pottu Amman, the fearsome LTTE intelligence leader, worked out a plot in Jaffna in February 1990 to get rid of the EPRLF leadership. Therefore, on his instructions, one Chinna Santhan traveled to Madras and joined an engineering technology institute near the flat where the EPRLF leaders lived. It was further alleged that a group of men arrived in Tamil Nadu on June 10, 1990 and were directed by Santhan to the flat, where they used AK-47 assault rifles and hand grenades to attack the EPRLF leaders.\n\nPathmanabah was among those killed, as was Yogasankari, the Member of Parliament. A total of 13 EPRLF members and two local Indians died in the attack. Santhan left the scene with the assailants, who fled by car to Pillayar Thidal village in Thanjavur district, and the next day they escaped by boat to Jaffna.\n\nThe LTTE was angry at the EPRLF because it had backed the India-Sri Lanka accord. Furthermore, the EPRLF ignored the LTTE's call to boycott the North-Eastern Provincial Council elections held in 1988.\n\nEPRLF had won the elections and formed the North-East Provincial Government, along with the Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front (ENDLF) led by Paranthan Rajan, alias Gnanasekaran. After the Indian forces pulled out of Sri Lanka on March 24, 1990, the North-Eastern Provincial Council collapsed and the EPRLF leaders fled to India.\n\nThe surviving EPRLF leaders nominated Suresh Premachandran, Member of Parliament for the Jaffna district, as their new Secretary General. It was alleged that the Tamil Nadu state government under the DMK leader M Karunanidhi hampered the investigations and prevented the arrest of the killers. No arrests were made during the tenure of Karunanidhi as the Chief Minister.\n\nThe army camp at Jaffna Fort came under LTTE attack on June 19. It had been built by the Dutch and stood as a monument to alien domination. It was situated on the northern coast of Jaffna near the Panay causeway that linked the Jaffna peninsula with the islands of Mandathievu and Kayts (Oorkavalthurai). The troops manning it regularly launched mortar and artillery attacks on civilian targets; very often the general hospital of Jaffna, just a short distance from the fort, also came under army fire.\n\nThe attack on Jaffna Fort continued for several weeks. LTTE fighters used earth-moving vehicles and heavy fire to break through the main entrance and armour-plated bucket scrapers and ladders to climb the ramparts. Troops and policemen repulsed the attacks and the air force caused causalities among the Tigers as well as civilians. Machetti bombers, civilian aircraft and helicopter gunships were utilized to pound the areas around the Fort to break the siege.\n\nOn July 12, the Sri Lankan armed forces in the North, which were under the command of Denzil Kobbekaduwa, launched \"Operation Thrivida Balaya\". This had succeeded in strengthening the Karainagar naval base by capturing the islands of Kayts (Oorkavalthurai) and Mandathievu. The troops trapped inside Jaffna Fort suffered without adequate food, replenishment of ammunition and proper medical treatment.\n\nAfter great efforts, Squadron Leader Lasantha Waidyaratne managed to evacuate the causalities in a daring operation code-named \"Operation Eagle\".\n\nSubsequently, two more battalions and a Special Forces regiment joined in to evacuate the trapped forces. They rescued 210 service personnel, including over 100 policemen. Besides the men, it was reported that the troops managed to save valuable military equipment and about 1,000 enemy weapons and 600,000 rounds of ammunition, cash and gold belonging to the state banks.\n\nWhen the war began on June 11, the Tamil MPs were in a state of disarray. Those who had strong reasons for disliking the Tigers blamed them for the war.\n\nOn October 11, General Ranatunge, the Secretary of the Ministry of Defence, stated that in the three months after the hostilities between the LTTE and the government began, due to the LTTE's campaign, 667 policemen had been killed, 352 were missing and 1,283 injured. He added that 352 soldiers had been killed and 1,154 injured. Also, four navy men and six air force cadres had died, while 32 and 24 injured, respectively.\n\nAbout LTTE causalities, the General said that, 1,459 were killed and 382 injured. According to intelligence sources, nearly 300 LTTE cadres were killed.\n\nThe LTTE offered a unilateral ceasefire on January 1, 1991. But the Sri Lankan government laid down the precondition that the LTTE should surrender arms. The LTTE rejected the condition and war resumed.\n\nBy mid November 1990, the Sri Lankan Army had managed to clear Mannar Island. Civil administration was restored in Mannar town. The main bridge linking the island was repaired to facilitate the movement of vehicles. The army flushed out the LTTE from Mannar.\n\nOn February 17, 1991, a group of 400 LTTE cadres ambushed the Sri Lankan army in Mannar and killed 44 soldiers, including two officers.\n\nOn March 2, 1991, Sri Lanka's most powerful and most heavily guarded Minister of State for Defence and the Minister of Plantation Industry, Ranjan Wijeratne, was killed when a massive car bomb blew apart his armor-plated Mercedes Benz, in Colombo.\n\nIn the explosion more than 30 others were killed, including security men, police commandos and innocent passers-by. Over 100 persons were wounded. Two escort jeeps, one back-up vehicle and two buses were also wrecked. The bomb explosion was heard more than 10 km away.\n\nThe killing of the parliamentarians started for the first time on 27 July 1975, when Amirthalingham's son, Kandeepan, and a few Tamil youth killed Alfred Duraiappah.\n\nAfter the assassination of Alfred Duraiyappa, I reliably learnt that with the view to safeguard Kandeepan's involvement, a LTTE leader had claimed responsibility for the killing.\n\nAlfred Duriappah, a very popular Tamil leader in the sixties and seventies, was twice elected Member of Parliament from the Jaffna electorate - March 1960 and again in July 1960 - 1965. He was killed by the LTTE gunmen when he went to worship at the Hindu temple - Ponnalai Varatharajaha Perumal Temple in the Jaffna district. He was also the Mayor of Jaffna. This killing was publicly claimed by the LTTE.\n\nFollowing the Alfred killing, a former Vaddukoddai Member Parliament A. Thiaagarajah was shot and killed on 25 May 1981.\n\nSubsequently, V.Dharmalingham and K.Alalalasundaram, former parliamentarians of the Tamil United Liberation Front were abducted from their homes on 03 September 1985 and killed by the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), led by Selvam Adaikalanathan, an MP of the Tamil National Alliance now.\n\nOn 12 February 1988, S. Nadarajah (Poddar), former Member of the Senate from 1967 till 02 Oct 1971, was killed because he participated in the India's Republic Day celebrations held on 26 January 1988 in Jaffna, by the Indian Peace Keeping Forces.\n\nOn 20 October 2004, Kingsley Rasnayakam, the MP elect from Batticaloa, was abducted and killed by the LTTE gunmen.\n\nChandra Nehru, the Parliamentarian from the Amparai district was killed on 7th Feb 2005 and it still remains unclear as to who were his killers.\n\nOn 13 August 2005 Lakshman Kadirgamar, MP and Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister was shot and killed by the LTTE gunmen.\n\nIt is alleged that Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has so far killed with impunity, 37 Sri Lankan Parliamentarians and two heads of states). These assassinations are highly condemnable acts; these killings are acts against humanity undoubtedly.\n\nParliamentarians belonging to Tamil, Muslim and Sinhala ethnic groups had been killed by LTTE.\n\nFurthermore, Rajiv Gandhi, a former Prime Minister of India too had been killed by the Tamil terrorist organization on 21 May 1991. This killing was followed by the killing of Ranatunga Premadasa, second President of Sri Lanka on 1 May 1003.\n\nIt is still not clear about the group behind the killings of Joseph Pararajasingham, Chandra Nehru, the Parliamentarian from the Amparai district, and Siva Maharajah, one time TULF Member of Parliament.\n\nCivil leaders aver that it is high time the government took action to stop further killings and appoint a Presidential Commission to go into these killings and report without any further delay.\n\n*The lists of the Parliamentarians so far killed are given below:\n\n1.

Some eyewitness had seen this women moving towards Rajiv Gandhi and bending down, genuflecting to pay respects, by touching his feet.\n\nAt that very moment, at 10.18 pm, a shuddering loud explosion was heard. Though there was a heavy concentration of policemen and Congress workers around Rajiv Gandhi at that time. According to some eyewitness reports, the explosion produced a flash of light about 3 meters high, which lasted for a few seconds, followed by a thick pall of smoke. The blast created a forceful impact; Rajiv Gandhi was thrown about 1.75 meters to the left, inside the barricade.\n\nIn all, along with Rajiv Gandhi, 18 persons were killed, including nine policemen; 33 persons, including 12, policemen were injured.\n\nRanasinghe Premadasa, the 3rd President of Sri Lanka from 2 January 1989 to 1 May 1993 was killed on 1 May 1993 during a May Day rally, by an LTTE suicide bomber.\n\nKilling of Local Government Leaders by the LTTE\n\n1.

Starting on the 17th October 1995, the primary objective of the operation was the capture of the city of Jaffna and rest of the Jaffna peninsula from the LTTE . It is believed that Operation Riviresa was the largest and most successful military operation in Sri Lankan Armed Forces history in recent times.\n\nOn 29 November 1995, 53 Division, commanded By Brigadier Janaka Perera, launched an assault on the LTTE positions guarding Jaffna town.\n\nBrigadier Perera decided to commence the operation on a narrow front to minimize civilian casualties. He launched the 532 Infantry Brigade, (commanded by Colonel Lucky Rajasinghe), from the east to penetrate and probe the defenses held by the LTTE.\n\nAs the brigade ran into a tight LTTE defense on Navalar Road, Colonel Lucky Rajasinghe ordered a 'turning movement' from the north, moving around the LTTE defenses and capturing the Nullur Area.\n\nBrigadier Janaka Perera, seizing the gap created by the infantry brigade, launched the air-mobile 531 Brigade (commanded by Colonel Hiran Halangoda), to capture Jaffna Fort.\n\nAt the same time the independent 534 Brigade (commanded by Colonel Percy Fernando) set-out along the east coast to capture the Jaffna Jetty.\n\nWith three brigades attacking simultaneously from three different sides, the LTTE was unable to coordinate their defenses effectively.\n\nBy the evening of Dec 1st, 1995, three brigades had breached the LTTE defenses, causing confusion. That night, LTTE cadres abandoned the city's defenses, and escaped in the darkness of the night by boats across Kilali Lagoon.\n\nOn the morning of Dec 2, 1995, troops of 53 Division entered Jaffna ending their intense 50 -day battle.\n\nWhen on the run LTTE managed to coax and take away with them more than Fifty thousand Tamil civilians in the North to Vanni.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, according to my estimate, based on news reports, information I personally received, and reports I had collected between 1990 June and May 2009 -\n\nLTTE was responsible for the killing of 82,350 Tamil, Sinhalese and Muslim civilians.\n\nI wish to place on record my appeal to the Sri Lankan Government and President of Sri Lanka to file cases against the LTTE persons who were responsible for the killings of the Sri Lankan civilians.\n\nVelupillai Prabhakaran was wanted by Interpol and many other organizations since 1991 for terrorism, murder, organized crime and terrorism conspiracy.\n\nMadras High Court in India had issued an arrest warrant against him for plotting the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in May, 1991 and in 2002.\n\nJudge Ambepitiya issued an open warrant to arrest Prabhakaran in connection with the 1996 Central Bank bombing. On 31 October 2010, the judge found him guilty on 51 counts and sentenced him to 200 year jail term in absentia n for the bomb blast which killed more than 100 civilians.\n\nThough according to Government reports Velupillai Prabhakaran, the erstwhile leader of the LTTE is dead, I urge that he must be tried posthumously in the appropriate Sri Lankan Court as a terrorist.\n\nPrabhakaran should be tried as he was responsible for human tragedy, destruction, killings and mayhem.\n\nI also strongly urge that\n\n* A case must be filed in the appropriate Sri Lankan Courts against Tamil National Alliance (TNA).\n\n* The court must be urged to ban TNA and its Members in Sri Lanka as it was organized by the LTTE in 2004 as a Tigers' proxy and to contest Parliamentary elections held in that year.\n\n* EPRLF leader Suresh Premachandran and TELO leader Selvam Adaikalanthan have to be brought to book and tried in the appropriate courts in Sri Lanka for the crimes they had committed against humanity.\n\n* The Government must openly declare that all the victims of the LTTE be declared as missing persons and dead certificates be issued.\n\n* It is high time international community, which banned LTTE as a terrorist organization, should come forward to ban Tamil National Alliance - the proxy of the LTTE as terrorist outfit, which promoted and glorified LTTE terrorism internationally.\n\n* Also leaders of TELO, EPRLF and PLOTE, who personally involved in killings, destructions and mayhem, should be considered persona non grata in their respective countries.\n\nI am against inviting former hardcore LTTE activists to Sri Lanka, giving them prominence, or providing opportunities to them to become prominent.\n\n* Any person, who joined the terrorist outfit, has to swear alle-giance to its leader and outfit. Therefore his/ her statement of joining the mainstream politics and giving up terrorism and condemning terrorism and terrorist organizations are nothing but eyewash.\n\n* It is, in fact, a ploy to enter the country and to again regroup the terrorist organizations. These people cannot be trusted.\n\n* I know people like Nadarajah Sethurupan are vipers in the grass from Norway and should never be trusted. Once a person like him steps in Sri Lanka they have to be arrested, tried and sentenced.\n\n* I think the Army intelligence as well as other intelligence agencies would be having dossiers about these vipers and I urge the authorities to order action against them on the basis of those records.\n\nFurthermore, I urge the Government to consider providing adequate compensations to next of kin of the families of all the civilians who had been killed by the LTTE and by the other Tamil terrorist organizations.\n\nConcluded\n\nPublished by HT Syndication with permission from Asian Tribune.\n\nCopyright HT Media Ltd.
