A spokesperson of the SLMM told The Hindu that Henricsson is of the view that the SLMM has become some kind of a \"political cover\" for Colombo and the LTTE to keep alive the cease-fire agreement (CFA) without honouring it. The move follows his charges in the media that the Government is obstructing an impartial probe into the execution of 17 workers of a French NGO in Muttur last week. Meanwhile, the Secretary General of Sri Lanka Government's Secretariat for Coordinating the Peace Process (SCOPP), Palitha T.B. Kohona, told reporters that he was surprised at the charges and asserted that an independent inquiry, assisted by foreign forensic experts, was currently on into the aid workers killing in Muttur.
