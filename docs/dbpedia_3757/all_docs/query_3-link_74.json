Jayaratne told Parliament that though the LTTE was militarily defeated, there were attempts to revamp the organisation in different parts of the world. The Prime Minister said the provisions of the PTA were required to deal with the discovery of weapon hauls hidden by the LTTE. He said the PTA was needed to take action with regard to LTTE suspects who did not surrender after the war ended in 2009.\n\n“The plan by two LTTE members to kill the supporter of a Tamil political party on March 17 and the arrest of four suspects in South India on December 20 last year can be seen as attempts to revive the organisation. It is ridiculous for the opposition to ask for the repealof the PTA,” the Prime Minister said.\n\nHowever, Mr. Wickremesinghe asked whether former Colombo Deputy Mayor Azath Salley had been arrested under the PTA over an alleged link with a terrorist movement.\n\nThe Premier said Mr. Salley had told an Indian magazine that Sri Lankan Muslims had nothing else to do but up arms to defend themselves against the backdrop of rising violence against them.\n\nHe said upon close examination of his statement it can be pointed out that Mr. Salley had committed an offence under Section 120 of the Penal Code. Fomenting tension between communities was a key allegation made against him.\n\n“Before the arrest, Mr. Salley was asked to appear at the CID office but he did not do it. It is the bounden duty of the government to use the provisions of the PTA to deal with cases which pose a threat to national security and inflame racist passions,” the Premier said.\n\nMeanwhile Opposition UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe accused the government of using the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to suppress the rights of political opponents.\n\nHe said Parliament passed the Proscribing of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam and Other Similar Organisations Act in 1978 but since it was observed that this Act contained a number of shortcomings, the Prevention of Terrorism Act was passed in 1979 to replace it.\n\n“Here, we took the Prevention of Terrorism Act passed by the British Parliament on terrorism in Northern Ireland as our basis. Under this Act, action was taken against terrorists in the South and the North, and arrests were made. Now, the war in the North is over and terrorism has been defeated. In such a situation, there arises no need for executing the Prevention of Terrorism Act. As such, this Act should have been abrogated. At the inquiries made on this matter, the government stated on several occasions in this House itself that it is not going to execute the Prevention of Terrorism Act,” he said. “After the September 11 incident, the whole world is vigilant about international terrorist acts. The British parliament passed another Act in place of the former Prevention of Terrorism Act to prevent such terrorist activities. That Act has banned applying its articles for suppressing political activities. Nevertheless, now this Act is being used for suppressing opposition political groups in Sri Lanka. Mr. Azath Sally was arrested under this Act. He is a politician who has been party to political activities both in the Opposition and the Government. At the Presidential Election 2010, he distanced himself from the UNP and supported President Mahinda Rajapaksa. At no occasion during his life time has Mr. Sally been allied to a terrorist organization.\n\nMr. Wickremesinghe said he appeared to have been arrested on the basis of a statement allegedly made by him. Politicians may make different statements. We have witnessed instances in which they make irresponsible statements. Mr. Sally made this statement at a time in which the government is taking no action whatsoever regarding harassmens made against Muslims; at a time when Muslim Leaders in the government are keeping quiet.\n\nHe said against such a backdrop, if there are charges that the frantic statement made by Mr. Sally contains some elements of wrongdoing and irresponsibility, what should first of all have been done was to inquire whether he in fact had made such a statement and to take action under ordinary law if it was confirmed after such investigations that he had committed an offence and Mr. Sally’s arrest under the Prevention of Terrorism Act could by no means be condoned.

He was gunned down, while waiting in front of his residence in Trincomalee for a bus to go to work on 24 January 2006. A father of two, he was an employee of the Ports Authority.\n\nBut, three weeks before his death, he photographed the most conclusive evidence revealed that the five students of Trincomalee who were massacred on 2 January 2006 were, in fact, shot in close range, in the execution style. The shocking pictures were published in the Jaffna-based Uthayan paper, and challenged the government’s version of the incident that the students were killed after an exchange of fire.\n\nThree weeks after the pictures appeared, Sugirtharajan was dead. His killers were never caught, though many alleged the military had a hand in the killing. His name was tucked away in a long list of unresolved killings, abductions, disappearance of media personnel, who made the supreme sacrifice for performing their duty.\n\nThe discourse of the attacks on the media is habitually focused on the high profile murder of Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge, the abduction of Cartoonist, Prageeth Ekneligoda, the periodic attacks on the Uthayan paper and the abduction and torture of journalist and media activist, Poddala Jayantha,and so forth.\n\nPaid a heavy price\n\nIn this long list, Sugirtharajan is a footnote. However, it was provincial journalists like him and media workers, who ensured the besieged Northern media industry would continue to function, who took the brunt of the violence.\n\nThey paid a heavy price for their commitment, idealism or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nThe preponderance of those victims is Tamil. And a sizable number of them are media workers, who contributed to the profession through means other than editorial work. During the war in Jaffna, newspaper delivery men, who transported the bundle of the morning newspapers in the back of their motorcycles, had often been treading with death.\n\nDelivery men such as Mariyadas Manojanraj, Sathasivam Baskaran were killed while distributing newspapers in the Jaffna Peninsula and their ilk continue to be at the receiving end of regular violence.\n\nBoth in the North and to a certain degree in the South, journalists were placed at the mercy of the belligerents of all sides.\n\nOn 28 May 2008, Paranirupasingham Devakumar, Jaffna correspondent for the News First and Shakthi TV, was hacked to death, allegedly by a group of LTTE supporters, who were enraged the journalist covered a rally of the Eelam’s People’s Democratic Party (EPDP), a constituent party of the ruling United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) . Devakumar acted against the wishes of the Tamil Tigers and paid the supreme sacrifice. His killers are still at large and police suspended investigations, citing lack of evidence. No arrests were made.\n\nEarlier, during the heydays of the peace process in 2004, the LTTE, which had been exploiting the restraint exercised by the military at the time embarked on a mission to eliminate the dissenting voices among Tamils. The EPDP took the brunt of the killings; its senior members and local operatives were killed at an alarming rate.\n\nOn 16 August, 2004 The LTTE gunned down Kandasamy Aiyar, media secretary and senior member of the EPDP in Colombo.\n\nAfter the split of the mainstream Tamil Tigers, the break-away Karuna faction led by Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna, a minister of the present government joined the fray.\n\nOn 31 May, 2004 Aiyathurai Nadesan, a Tamil journalist attached to the Daily Virakesari, was shot by assailants believed to be of the Karuna faction in Batticaloa.\n\nDharmaratnam Sivaram, the editor of the Tamilnet website was gunned down on 28 May, 2005, allegedly by the para-military operatives at the behest of the military intelligence.\n\nTwo PLOTE cadres were initially arrested by the police for the murder. One suspect known as Arumugam Sri Skandharajah alias Peter was indicted and the trial was re-initiated before a Sinhala speaking Jury in 2011, after a lapse of five years. The trial later grinded to a halt due to the absence of evidence. The suspect was released on bail.\n\nIn most cases, where the culpability of the government and state military apparatus are suspected, the investigations tend to come to an abrupt halt.\n\nPolitical directive\n\nPrageeth Ekneligoda, the cartoonist disappeared after he left the office, informing his colleagues he was going to meet a ‘contact’. He left the office on that fateful day, after receiving a telephone call from the ‘purported contact’ The Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which investigated the disappearance traced the last caller to his mobile phone in Batticaloa. After the initial breakthrough, before the suspect was arrested, the CID investigations came to a grinding halt, which the inside sources confided was due to a political directive.\n\nOn occasions, even the courts become hollow in the search of justice when the state is alleged to be involved in the killings.\n\nOn 2 June, 2006, Sampath Lakmal, the freelance journalist, who was believed to have maintained a close relationship with the Army intelligence and had allegedly served as a military informant was killed after he left the house at night, after receiving a call from one Lieutenant ‘Kumar Sir’. Mother of the slain journalist, Rupa de Silva overheard him greeting the person at the other end as ‘Kumar Sir’ and it was later revealed he had met one Lieutenant Kumara. Later his bullet ridden body was found in Dehiwela. Despite the incriminating evidence, which was presented to the court by the mother of the slain journalist, no arrests were made.\n\nThe investigations into the most high profile murder of the recent times, that of Lasantha Wickrematunge, initially caused ripples within the military intelligence circles. A group of military intelligence officials were held under close observation and confined to their barrack. The former Director of Military Intelligence Corp, Major General Amal Karunasena was recalled from Eritrea where he was sent to open a Sri Lankan mission in Asmara. Two suspects, Kandegedara Piyawansha, a former military intelligence officer and Pichchai Jesudasan, an estate Tamil youth, were taken into custody after the initial investigations. Later, Piyawansa was released on bail after he made a statement in the Magistrate’s chamber. Requests made by the counsels appearing for late Wickrematunge to obtain a copy of the statement made by Piyawansa was denied due to the objections raised by the CID.\n\nLater to make matters worse, Jesudasan died under suspicious circumstances while he was in jail on 15 October, 2011.\n\nEven four years after his death, justice is yet to be delivered to the former newspaper editor.\n\nAnd the victims of, violence unleashed against media, were made victims for a second time, of the entrenched culture of impunity, which has, in part, been fostered by the government.\n\nPoddala Jayantha, who was abducted and tortured by his captors was targeted by a sinister campaign of personal vilification carried out by the spin doctors of the government and some of the least salubrious government ministers, such as Mervyn Silva, who boasted in a public rally that he ‘broke’ the legs of Poddala Jayantha and threatened to do so again, should he ever return.\n\nJournalists and media workers killed since 2006\n\n24 January 2006: Subramaniyam Sukirtharajan, freelance journalist, Sudar Oli, shot dead in Trincomalee in front of his residence.\n\n3 May 2006: On the International Press Freedom Day, gunmen raided the Uthayan newspaper in Jaffna, killing staff members, Suresh Kumar and Ranjith Kumar. The EPDP was blamed for the attack. No arrests were made.\n\n2 June 2006: Sampath Lakmal Silva, a freelance journalist of the Sathdina newspaper was shot dead in the early hours of 2 July, 2006, and his body was found in Jayawardena Place, Dehiwela.

He was shot dead inside his house, which was 300 metres inside the High Security Zone (HSZ) of the Sri Lanka Army (SLA) in Tellippalai in Jaffna on 20 August, 2006. The newspaper was forced to shut down due to his demise.\n\n15 February 2007: Subramaniyam Ramachandran, a reporter of Thinakural and Valampuri, was abducted by an unidentified group in Vadamarachchi in the Jaffna Peninsula and feared to be dead.\n\n16 April 2007: Subash Chandraboas, 32, editor of a small Tamil-language monthly magazine, Nilam (The Ground), was shot dead in the evening near his home in Thoanikkal, near Vavuniya.

The Secretariat for Muslims (SFM) documented 21 incidents occurring from January to March, and 54 incidents in March alone.\n\nThe SFM has now documented all the incidents that occurred in April, that range from low-level harassment of Muslims, venomous media statements, direct threats to violence, attacks on mosques, death threats, business boycotts, and property seizure, in what appears to be part of a growing campaign to destroy Muslim communities or drive them into exile.\n\nIntimidation aimed at other aspects of daily Islamic life is also now disturbingly commonplace in Sri Lanka. Men’s beards, traditional hijab/veils by women have been condemned by extremists seeking to fuel sectarian hatred.\n\nMuch of this persecution is carried out with apparent impunity. An example of this (and also the most notable incident) was the attack on the showroom cum warehouse complex in late March of the reputed, Muslim owned apparel firm “Fashion Bug” in the suburbs of Colombo, while police stood and watched. Also of note is the arrest of Azath Salley on May 2nd. Salley has been an outspoken critic of the BBS. His arrest was based on ‘several complaints’ but no clear charges, and clearly flouts international conventions on minority rights and religious freedoms. According to Amnesty International, his campaigning to end oppressive practices against minorities in Sri Lanka, in particular Muslims and Tamils, has brought on the ire of the Sri Lankan government.\n\nThis document also includes incidents such as mosques in Colombo being threatened to close. Meanwhile, in Galle, Sinhalese landlords have forced their Muslim shop owner tenants to vacate their shops by the end of the year. April also saw the launch in Batticaloa of a public campaign calling for a protest against Muslims. Similar campaigns have since been held in other parts of the country.\n\nClick here to read the full document covering the incidents of April 2013.\n\nPosted by Thavam\n\n↧\n\nEconomic growth stalling\n\nEconomic growth stalling\n\n* Electricity price hike, though necessary, will have negative impact on growth in a number of ways\n\nMay 7, 2013, 12:00 pm\n\n“There seems to be clear evidence that growth is stalling,” warns economic think tank the Pathfinder Foundation, highlighting several macroeconomic issues plaguing the country and echoing concerns continuously raised by several economists in the recent past.\n\n“The scope for expansionary macroeconomic policies is limited. The space for lower interest rates brought about by the electricity price increase is unlikely to offset the negative impact on growth generated by the combined effects of the increased cost of power, the over-valued real effective exchange rate and low-productivity/competitiveness. Repeated boom and bust cycles (including the possibility of a major crisis in the future) cannot be avoided without a package of reforms that strengthen the growth framework of the economy through improved productivity/competitiveness to boost exports,” the think tank warned.\n\n“The growth momentum in the Sri Lankan economy has slowed down significantly. It is important to examine its performance subsequent to the necessary stabilization measures introduced in Feb/March 2012 to address the overheating of the economy. This was reflected in the severe balance of payments/reserves and inflationary pressures at that time. Trends in indicators that are often used as proxies for growth, such as electricity consumption, shipments (total cargo handled minus transhipment) and cement consumption (domestic production plus imports) seem to point to growth of less than 5% in 2H 2012 i.e. the period when the stabilization measures would have taken effect.”\n\nThe government has set an economic growth target of 7.5% for 2013, but the Pathfinder Foundation pointed out several factors that would make this challenging.\n\n= The electricity price hike, though necessary, will have a negative impact on growth in a number of ways. Exporters will not be able to pass on the increase in their electricity costs and the resulting loss in competitiveness could well lead to some loss in market share. Producers for the domestic market can pass on the cost rise to their customers. However, this is likely to dampen demand thereby constraining growth.\n\n= Overall consumption, particularly of fast-moving consumer goods, is likely to decline, with negative implications for growth.\n\n= Investment is likely to be deterred by the higher cost structures associated with the increased prices of electricity and fuel.\n\n= The combination of the increase in electricity prices and an over-valued real effective exchange rate will erode the competitiveness of the economy. This will dampen growth prospects for both exports and import competing sectors. The current poor export performance, where exports have halved from 33% of GDP to 16% over the last decade, will be exacerbated.\n\n“On the positive side, the improvement in the state bank balance sheets brought about by the recent electricity and fuel price adjustments will create space for some easing of interest rates. In addition, the prospects of lower interest rates are likely to boost the stock exchange. The wealth effects of this are likely to provide some support to both domestic consumption and investment. This will serve to boost growth prospects in the economy,” the think tank said.\n\nLimited Scope for Expansionary Macroeconomic Policy\n\n“It is unlikely that the positive phenomena mentioned above will be sufficient to offset the combined effects of an overvalued real effective exchange rate and higher energy and fuel prices. In the present context, it is also important to recognize that too aggressive an easing of macroeconomic policies, particularly interest rates, will result in a repeat of the balance of payments/reserves and inflation problems experienced in late 2011/early 2012. There is also limited scope to loosen fiscal policy at this time given the constraints being faced on the revenue front and the worrying trends in debt servicing. Total debt repayments were greater than total revenue in 2012. The increasing exposure to external debt and within that short-term commercial debt further circumscribes the room to maneuver in terms of loosening fiscal policy.\n\n“The positive impact on domestic consumption of the wealth effects associated with gains on the stock market are unlikely to offset the reduction in consumption triggered by the electricity price increase, particularly as the marginal propensity to consume is relatively low among the wealthy who invest in the stock market.”\n\nImproved productivity/\n\ncompetitiveness\n\nThe Pathfinder Foundation argues that Sri Lanka is overly dependent on remittances and borrowed foreign capital inflows (see The Island Financial Review of May 06, 2013).\n\n“The headroom for such borrowing could run out relatively quickly, particularly if the creditworthiness of the country is not enhanced through a boost in export performance. At present, remittances are the only bright spot in the country’s external account. This is a very precarious situation. Furthermore, the growth record, since April 2012, demonstrates that even with buoyant remittances the economy does not have the import capacity to grow faster than 5-6% without overheating. It would be disappointing if post-conflict Sri Lanka had to settle for a growth rate which is not very different from that achieved during the 25 years of conflict. The root cause of the problem is low productivity and a lack of competitiveness that has undermined export performance.\n\n“Sustained growth of 7.5% – 8% (without repeated boom/bust cycles eventually leading to a major crisis) can only be achieved through a package of measures to strengthen the growth framework of the economy based on increased productivity/competitiveness. Given the size of the domestic market, the Sri Lankan economy cannot achieve a higher growth path on a sustained basis without a significant turnaround in export performance. This requires an elimination of the anti-export bias in the macroeconomic policy framework. Addressing the over-valued real effective exchange rate (which reflects the movement in the cost structures between Sri Lanka and her major competitors/trading partners) and trade policy (tariff structure) should be a central part of any reform package.\n\n“This needs to be supplemented by structural reforms that increase the competitiveness of the economy, including measures to restructure the electricity and fuel sectors to contain costs. Another major challenge is to address the low productivity in the agricultural sector and the public service which absorb large amounts of financial and human resources and yield a very low return to the economy.\n\n“The highest priority should be attached to improving the investment climate as a higher growth path is not attainable without increased domestic and foreign investment. Attracting non-debt creating flows, particularly long-term investment in the form of FDI, is central for sustained growth and development of the country. Furthermore, the momentum of the government’s infrastructure development program cannot be maintained without increased private sector involvement,” the think tank said.\n\nPosted by Thavam\n\n↧\n\nRelease Azath Salley – CRM Calls For Even-Handed Action Under The Normal Law\n\nRelease Azath Salley – CRM Calls For Even-Handed Action Under The Normal Law\n\nMay 8, 2013\n\nAzath Salley‘s detention under the Prevention of Terrorism Act should be revoked and he should be released immediately. If there are indeed serious allegations of his inciting religious hostility that merit investigation, such investigation, and any consequent action, should take place under the normal law. It should also be part of a wider law-enforcement exercise against all such offenders, irrespective of ethnic, religious or political affiliation.\n\nEven during the existence of the armed conflict the position of the Civil Rights Movement has been that the PTA, if not repealed, should at least be drastically amended. Among the totally unacceptable features we have repeatedly conde\n\nmned are its “no bail” provisions, and the provision for long term detention at the will of the executive with no legal rules as to place or conditions of detention. It is intolerable that resort to this discredited Act should be made today.\n\nOf extreme concern in the instant case is the context in which this arrest of a prominent member of a minority community has been made. We refer to the alarming hate campaign against this same minority currently conducted by elements claiming to represent the majority Buddhists, which campaign has reportedly at times been accompanied by highly inflammatory actions and speeches which in some instances have resulted in violence. The law enforcement agencies have been conspicuously absent or ineffective. On some occasions they have simply remained bystanders. A vigorous and principled counter-campaign by the government emphasising values of tolerance and inter-religious harmony has been called for by many but remains no more than a fervent hope.\n\nTo now use the inhuman provisions of the PTA against Mr Salley is not merely an act of injustice perpetrated on one individual. It sends a most dangerous message to a community already feeling unfairly under attack, and may act as encouragement to the extremist forces mobilised against minority groups, raising a spectre some of us fondly dreamed had been laid to rest.\n\nSuriya Wickremasinghe\n\nSecretary CRM\n\nPosted by Thavam\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nDalai Lama lashes Myanmar, Lanka Buddhist violence\n\nDalai Lama lashes Myanmar, Lanka Buddhist violence\n\nAssociated Press |-Wednesday, May 8, 2013\n\nThe Dalai Lama has implored Buddhist monks in Myanmar and Sri -Lanka to put an end to a series of recent attacks on Muslims in their countries.\n\nThe Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader spoke Tuesday night about religious violence when asked questions following a speech he delivered to 15,000 people at the University of Maryland in the United States.\n\nMyanmar, which was earlier known as Burma, has been wracked by sectarian violence that has killed hundreds and displaced more than 135,000 over the past year, while Sri Lankan Buddhist groups have recently attacked Muslim businesses.\n\n“Killing people in the name of religion is really very sad, unthinkable, very sad,” the Nobel Peace laureate said. “Nowadays even Buddhists now involved, in Burma and Sri Lanka also. Buddhist monks … destroy Muslim mosques or Muslim families. Really very sad.”\n\nHe said that he sometimes counsels his fellow Buddhists: “When they develop some sort of negative emotions toward the Muslim community, then please think (of) the face of Buddha.”\n\nIf the Buddha is there, he will protect the Muslims, he said in a video of the speech posted on the university’s website.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is the head of the Tibetan school of Buddhism, while Buddhism in Myanmar and Sri Lanka is dominated by the separate Theravada branch, which does not answer to his authority.\n\nThe sectarian violence in Myanmar first flared in western Rakhine state nearly a year ago, when mobs of Buddhists armed with machetes razed thousands of Muslim homes, leaving hundreds dead and forcing 125,000 people to flee, mostly Muslims.\n\nThat violence has since spread into a campaign against the country’s Muslim community in other regions.\n\nIn March, at least 43 people were killed and 12,000 displaced in the central city of Meikhtila when Buddhist mobs rampaged through the town and police stood idly by. Most of the victims were Muslim.\n\nLast week, one person was killed and nine others injured when Buddhists stormed a township about 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the main city Yangon, ransacking mosques and burning several villages to the ground.\n\nNew York-based Human Rights Watch has accused authorities _ including Buddhist monks, local politicians, government officials, and state security forces _ of fomenting an organized campaign of “ethnic cleansing” against the Muslims in Rakhine state. The government has denied the charges.\n\nSri Lanka, which is dominated by a Buddhist majority, has also been hit by rising instances of hate speech against Muslims and attacks on Muslim-owned businesses.\n\nGroups led by Buddhist monks have spread allegations that the small Muslim minority was dominating business there and trying to take over the country by increasing its birthrate and secretly sterilizing Buddhists.\n\nPosted by Thavam\n\n↧\n\nIs “Bodu Bala Sena” A Racist Organization?\n\nIs “Bodu Bala Sena” A Racist Organization?\n\nBy Hema Senanayake -May 8, 2013\n\nHema Senanayake\n\nA couple of months ago BBS became a household name in Sri Lanka. We may agree or may not agree with the views of BBS but we all agree that it created a heavy impact in the social fabric of Sri Lanka. Some people think that BBS is a patriot movement and some people think that it is a cheap racist organization.\n\nTherefore when somebody told me that the General Secretary of BBS (Bodu Bala Sena) was supposed to come to the New York Buddhist Vihara on May 05th to submit his case to Sinhalese community in New York I thought I should come and meet him to ask a question. So, I asked one of the resident monks in the temple that whether the session was open for a discussion. The reverend monk told me that the planned session had been cancelled. I missed the opportunity of asking an important question directly from the General Secretary of BBS. So, I thought I would raise that question through the media.\n\nThe question is about as to how we recognize a Sinhala racist.\n\nThere is a small background story to this question. Let me explain it first. One of my Sinhala friends’ son was studying in Queens, New York. At about grade 10 he left this school to a new school in Howard Beach area close to the JFK airport. In that school most of the students were white. Majority of them were from Italian descent and some of them were from Irish decent. In fact in this boy’s very first class in that school there were no students from African descent. For dark skin students there were only two, one was my friend’s son and the other was an Indian girl.\n\nIn the evening of the very first day in that school I telephoned the boy as to find out how he was doing in the new school because I knew that old students sometimes play mischiefs on newcomers. In responding to my call he replied that the school was good and he said “but one racist white student yelled at me.”\n\n“What did he say” I asked him. The white student had told our boy “go back to your country, go back to your jungle.” Perhaps some of those students might have thought that Sri Lanka was a jungle. I asked him whether he was scared. He said “No, I did not but I gave him a good reply.”\n\nThis child had told the white guy that he would go back to Sri Lanka but on a certain basis. The white student had asked what the basis was. He had told him that the basis was “first-in-first-out”; “so, you came first and must go out first then I would go back next.” Our child was studying American history in that grade and knew that white people came to America a few centuries ago from Europe. That was the reason he intelligently played a trick on the white student without going into a verbal or physical fight. I asked him as to what happened after that. He said that the white student had just gone away.\n\nFrom this story we get a practical definition as to who a racist is. Our child defined the white student who yelled at him as a racist because that student had asked him to go back to his country thinking that the America is belonged to them only. In the same way if a white skin person come and say to any member of Sinhala community who domiciled in the United States that he or she has to go back to Sri Lanka they would definitely identify that person as a racist. So, this establishes a universal practical definition for a racist. That is, a racist is a person who thinks that a country belongs only to its old inhabitants who contributed much to the country’s culture. Racists think that other citizens must go back to countries where they came from.\n\nLet us equally apply this definition to Sri Lanka. If a Sinhala-Buddhist person thinks that Tamil or Muslim citizens must go back to their former countries, that person is a racist. Also if that person verbally abuses citizens of minorities and destroys their properties, that person is a full blown racist. From this definition even a child like my friend’s son could recognize who a racist is. I like this practical definition of racism than the scholarly definition of the word which says that racism means “prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one’s own race is superior” (Oxford Dictionary).\n\nRacist is not a patriot; racists are disgrace to a country. So, I wanted to ask from BBS Secretary General whether BBS is a racist movement in terms of my friend’s son definition of the word. Since I have missed that opportunity as the General Secretary had cancelled his planned meeting in New York, I now pose this question to the members of Sri Lankan community that live in the United States and elsewhere around the world. What is BBS in view of their recent acts, speeches and declarations?\n\nIn view of the same definition, LTTE was a racist organization because they evicted around 100,000 Muslims from North thinking that north was part of Tamil homeland. Therefore I think this is a fair and practical definition of a racist so that even a child could recognize who a racist is. Hence this definition must be duly embedded into the core of the social fabric in Sri Lanka.\n\nPosted by Thavam\n\n↧\n\nSri Lanka: The Northern Provincial Council Election – Analysis\n\nSri Lanka: The Northern Provincial Council Election – Analysis\n\nBy Eurasia Review\n\nBy S. I. Keethaponcalan-May 7, 2013\n\nThe provincial council system in Sri Lanka was established in 1987 consequent to the Indo-Lanka Accord concluded between Sri Lanka and India in the same year. One provincial council was setup for the Northern and Eastern Provinces, according to the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan constitution of 1978. The amendment had its genesis in the Accord. Both the 13th Amendment and the provincial council system were conceived as a mechanism to resolve the ethnic conflict.\n\nElections were conducted to the first provincial council of the merged North-East provinces in 1988 and an administration was formed under the stewardship Varadaraja Perumal of the Eelam People’s Liberation Front (EPRLF), which collaborated closely with the Indian government and had the patronage of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF). This administration however did not last long as it was dissolved in 1990. Since Perumal’s administration depended on the Indian government and the IPKF for its survival, when the decision was made to withdraw the IPKF from Sri Lanka, Perumal had no option but to abandon the provincial council and move with the IPKF to India. Before deserting the council however, Perumal, without any reasonable basis, made a Unilateral Declaration of Independence. Angered by the UDI, President Ranasinghe Premadasa dissolved the North-East Provincial Council in 1990, never to be reconstituted again.\n\nMeanwhile, the Janatha Vimukthi Peamuna (JVP), a nationalist Sinhala political party, which fought for a socialist state in Sri Lanka, from the inception, opposed the provincial council system and the 13th Amendment. Taking advantage of its alliance with the government in power, the JVP filed a case against the merger of the Northern and Eastern provinces in 2006 and gained a ruling in favor from the Supreme Court. Thus the temporarily merged North-East provinces were demerged in 2007.\n\nAlthough the war between the state armed forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was ended in May 2009, the Eastern Province, a substantial portion of which was controlled by the LTTE, was brought under the sway of the government in 2008. The government wasted no time as it conducted the provincial council elections for the Eastern Province and formed the provincial administration in 2008. Emboldened by the military success in the Eastern Province the government pursued the same military strategy in the North as well. Crushing the LTTE leadership and the military machine, the government ended the war conclusively in May 2009.\n\nThe termination of the war and the LTTE led to the belief and the hope that the government, sooner than later, will conduct the provincial council elections in the North as well. The anticipated northern provincial council election was linked to ethnic reconciliation as especially the international community believed that the ballot and an opportunity for the Tamil people to govern their own affairs in the Northern Province will accelerate the reconciliation process. To date however, the Northern Province has been administered by Major General G.A.Chandrasiri, who was appointed by the central government. No election was conducted and about four years after the end of the war the Northern Provincial Council remains without a democratically elected government.\n\nThere were two fundamental reasons why the central government has shown no urgency in conducting the provincial council election to the Northern Province, (1) security, and (2) politics. Both these factors are linked closely to the history of elections conducted in the North in the post-war period. In all the elections conducted in the North during the past four year period including the local government election, presidential election and the parliamentary election, the Tamil voters in the North have overwhelmingly voted with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) or the parties endorsed by the TNA. Therefore, it is clear that if provincial council election is held under the prevailing political condition the TNA most probably will win the vote.\n\nThe government and section of the majority Sinhala community believe that this could pose serious challenges to the security of the province. The TNA was supportive of the LTTE policies, politics and strategies and operated as a surrogate of the LTTE. The TNA was also committed to the separate state for the Tamils in the North-East provinces. This makes the Sinhalese extremely suspicious of the TNA’s intensions. Although the TNA dropped its demand for a separate state and endorsed a federalist solution to the ethnic conflict in its 2010 parliamentary election manifesto, the Sinhalese refused to trust the TNA. Therefore, the government believes that, if given an opportunity, the TNA will use the provincial powers to promote separatism. This is one reason why the Northern provincial council elections were not conducted thus far. A powerful section within the of the government believes that it is important to keep the North under military control as long as possible to preempt another Tamil campaign for a separate state for the Tamils in the North.\n\nPolitically, the government in the past has demonstrated total commitment to preserving all provincial councils under the control of the ruling political coalition, the United People’s Freedom Alliance. The present government carried out a determined campaign during all previous provincial government elections conducted during its tenure in office and made sure the opposition parties have absolutely no chance of forming a government in these councils. Currently, all provincial councils are controlled by the People’s Alliance government. This will however, not be easy in the North, where the TNA will have a fair chance of winning and forming the government.\n\nThe government did not hesitate to hold the provincial council election in the East immediately because the political environment that prevailed in the province following the ousting of the LTTE was different. Former LTTE leaders Vinayagamurthi Muralitharan and Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan hailed from the Eastern Province. They defected from the LTTE in 2004 and collaborated with the armed forces contributing to the eventual military debacle of the LTTE. Politically, they aligned with the ruling party and continue to work with the government. Also, the rift between the Muralitharan faction of the LTTE and the mainstream group caused tension between the Northern and Eastern Tamils. Taking advantage of the political milieu the government conducted the Eastern Provincial Council election in 2008 and formed the administration. Chandrakanthan became the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province Provincial council.\n\nNevertheless, under pressure from the international community, caused mainly by the resolution adopted in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in March 2012 on Sri Lanka, President Mahinda Rajapaksa announced that the provincial council election in the North will be conducted in September 2013. Sponsors of the resolution especially the United States were advocating an international investigation on the human rights violations allegedly committed during the last phase of the war. Surprisingly, India, which was a staunch ally of the Rajapaksa government, voted for the resolution. The announcement of the election was made to address the international concerns expressed through the resolution. President Rajapaksa in an interview granted to The Hindu newspaper of India declared “We want to hold elections in September 2013.”\n\nThis was obviously one of the major demands of the international community. Without wasting too much time the international community welcomed the announcement. In an effort also to trap the Sri Lankan government in its own pronouncement the 2013 UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka, which was also sponsored by the US, welcomed “the announcement by the Government of Sri Lanka to hold elections to the Provincial Council in the Northern Province in September 2013.” It seems that the aim has been achieved as the Sri Lankan government seemed to have no option but to hold the election this year. Last week President Rajapaksa announced that he is in the process of consulting his advisors on the date to have the election.\n\nHowever, holding the election as promised is not easy. First, it seems that in a free and fair contest the TNA will win the election, which still has the potential to discourage the government. Second, there may be resistance from the security apparatus to handing over administration to a Tamil led government, which will be seen as detrimental to the long term security schemes in the North. Third, nationalist Sinhala groups are already up in arms against the proposed vote in the North.\n\nThe Bodu Bala Sena and Ravana Blaya two of the emerging vocal Sinhala-Buddhist nationalist entities have already declared their reservation of holding election in the North coupled with threats of public agitation if and when the election becomes a reality. On May 1st in one of the May Day rallies, Wimal Weerawansa, the Minister for Housing and Common Amenities in the present government declared that he will resign his position in the cabinet if the government decided to go ahead with the Northern polls. In a recent newspaper interview, Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Technology, Research and Atomic Energy, reiterated that his party was opposed to the proposed election. What is interesting is that all these anti-election groups are in one way or the other close to the government, which ignited the belief among some commentators that the government was behind the emerging movement and may use it as an excuse not to hold the promised election.\n\nThis perception has created doubts in the minds of the people of the North that it is unlikely that the government will in the near future hold the proposed election. Others argue that the government may, in order to defeat the challenges created by the promised election, try to scrap the 13th Amendment altogether. Scrapping of the 13th Amendemnt may also reinforce the popularity of the government, especially the President among the Sinhala people in the South. Therefore, the people in the North and the international community, albeit with some doubts, are waiting eagerly to the official announcement of the election, which may or may not come.\n\n(The author is Chair of the Conflict Resolution Department, Salisbury University, Maryland.

They said that the failure on the part of the government to ensure a continuous electricity supply would be a major setback in attracting foreign investment. Now, instead of bringing in new investment, the government would have to reassure those who had already invested here not to panic, sources said.\n\nResponding to a query, sources said that the country’s premier investment agency, Board of Investment (BoI), had assured investors of uninterrupted power supply when they were allocated lands within the EPZs. Sources emphasized that the urgent need was to call for a comprehensive discussion involving all stakeholders.\n\nThey said that Power and Energy Secretary M. M. C. Ferdinando has written to General Manager G. M. Wickremasuriya as well as CEB Chairman W. P. Ganegala and Dr. Lakshman Jayaweera emphasising the need to exempt EPZs from power cuts.\n\nFerdinando stressed that EPZs should be let off power cuts even in the future due to the importance of their operation to the national economy.\n\nSources said that it was unfortunate the government wanted to include EPZs in the power shedding programme immediately after imposing a hefty electricity tariff which would escalate production costs by about 22 per cent. The bottom line was Sri Lankan products wouldn’t be competitive due to escalating production costs hence the government couldn’t be ignorant of the danger, they said.\n\nPB objects to the President’s move to reduce the electricity bill\n\nWednesday, 08 May 2013\n\nFinance Minister Dr. P.B. Jayasundera has vehemently objected to the reduction of the electricity bill announced by the President as part of a media circus without his knowledge, sources said.\n\n“We cannot come out of this crisis even after increasing the electricity bill. This move was aimed at just staying afloat. Politicians cannot understand this. They are engage din various gimmicks to score points. It is the public officials who finally have to pay for these mistakes. They are trying to sacrifice everything in order to save one thing,” Dr. Jayasundera has told several members of his staff. Dr. Jayasundera had then left his ministry and not returned for about two days.\n\nWhile the President announced a reduction in the electricity bill at the government’s May Day rally, Minister Wimal Weerawansa who held his own May Day rally read the sms announcing the President’s statement to his supporters and asked them to be grateful to the President.\n\nPosted by Thavam\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nCVK Sivagnanam’s house attacked\n\nCVK Sivagnanam’s house attacked\n\n[TamilNet, Wednesday, 08 May 2013, 08:09 GMT]\n\nThe residence of Mr CVK Sivagnanam, a veteran civil activist and joint-secretary of the Ilangkai Thamizh Arasuk Kadchi (ITAK), has been attacked Tuesday night around 11:45 p.m. by alleged operatives of the SL military in Jaffna. Mr Sivagnanam narrowly escaped from the squad that stoned his residence. The attackers, who smashed the windows of the house, left the scene after the neighbours confronted them. The incident comes following reports that Mr Sivagnanam had shown interest in fielding himself as the chief candidate in the Provincial Council elections on behalf of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), news sources in Jaffna said.\n\nMr Sivagnanam’s residence is located close to Chaddanaathar temple in Nalloor on Jaffna – Point Pedro Road, an area heavily monitored by the SL military and Police during the night time.\n\nThe ITAK joint-secretary, who sustained minor scars in the attack, said the SL Police was not prepared to come to his residence when he phoned the Jaffna Police Station. In turn, he was told to come to the Police station in person and file a complaint.\n\nThe SL police didn’t show up at the site even as 8 hours have passed since the attack reported to them, Mr Sivagnanam told media Wednesday morning.\n\nCVK Sivagnanam\n\nMr Sivagnanam heads the Council of NGOs in the Jaffna district.

Members of the panel included No Fire Zone director Callum Macrae, Shivani Jegarajah of the Renaissance Chambers, Janani Jananayagam, founding director of Tamils against Genocide and Dr Devika Hovell a lecturer in law at the LSE.\n\nAddressing the audience, Barrister of the Renaissance Chambers, Shivani Jegarajah outlined her findings of the situation in Sri Lanka after working on the country guidance case, stating\n\n“No-where in the world has there been such a thorough investigation as we have carried out in Sri Lanka”\n\n“When I finished the country case, I realised that you cannot analyse a Tamil asylum case without considering at the forefront of your analysis that there was genocide.”\n\nThe director of the Non Governmental Organisation Tamils Against Genocide (TAG), Janani Jananayagam, outlined that the problem in Sri Lanka was more than an unruly regime, drawing upon several historic presidential statements that highlighted the inconsiderate nature of the Sri Lankan government towards the Tamils in the North-East.\n\n“When you watch, think about why this is happening,” she told the audience.\n\nNo Fire Zone director, Callum Macrae, introduced the film noting that the film was a piece of evidence as well as being a documentary, and purported the international communities duty to act on the issue. He stated,\n\n“The Sri Lankan government will tell you that everything you see in this documentary is a lie. This film is not a lie, everything in this film has been independently verified. “\n\n“What has happened is that the government makes promises to do something and does absolutely nothing. They have ignored their own recommendations. The recent UN resolution called on Sri Lanka to investigate itself. Sri Lanka has demonstrated quite clearly that it cannot investigate itself. It is absurd to let Sri Lanka to hide behind false pretences of conducting its own inquiry, The international community under the responsibility to protect resolution has a duty to now call for an international independent investigation.”\n\nThe film was received well by the crowd and ended in a question and answer session that discussed the lack of action by the international community.\n\nCallum Macrae slammed the recent failure of the Commonwealth in holding a stance on the issue,\n\n“Commonwealth General Secretary Sharma is responsible for the most appalling breech of the commonwealth values.”\n\nHe went on to note,\n\n“There is a tendency to see this as a static situation. The fact is that it is much more volatile. The regime is dangerous and unstable. It is actively trying to deny autonomy in the North-East. It is simply repressing the Tamils.”\n\nThe question and answer session ended with Jan Jananayagam, reiterating the importance of No Fire Zone as a tool to pressure the international community to take a stronger stance against Sri Lanka.\n\nCallum Macrae echoed Jan Jananayagam’s calls urging supporters of the documentary tofund the project using the website kickstarters.\n\nSee our twitter account for proceedings from the event.\n\nPosted by Thavam\n\n↧\n\nArticle 0\n\nSunday, May 05, 2013\n\nMore than 1000 Jaffna landowners are to file petitions in courts against an alleged land grab by the military in Valligamam north that local MPs claim is causing severe concern among civilians.\n\nLandowners hold a demonstration in front of the Pradeshiya Sabha Tellipalai. Pic by T. Premananth\n\nLandowners held a public demonstration last Sunday in front of the Pradeshiya Sabha Tellipalai demanding the return of their lands.\n\nNearly 10,000 acres was acquired by the military in the early 1990s and declared a high-security zone. This resulted in the displacement of 90,000 people from the Valigamam north and south-west divisional secretariats. TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran said that in 2006 the Court ordered the Ministry of Defence to explore the possibility of releasing the lands in Valigamam north to the owners given the current situation, and a committee was appointed to look into this without causing any hindrance to national security.\n\nThe committee included the Jaffna High Court Judge, District Secretary and Jaffna Security Forces Commander.\n\nUp until November 2011, nearly 50,000 persons were able to return to their lands following recommendations by the committee.\n\nAfter the establishment of a Lands Secretariat in Jaffna Kachcheri in 2012, the military acquired 6000 acres to expand the Palaly garrison and push forward the defence line.\n\nMr Sumanthiran said that under the Land Acquisition Act no private property could be acquired for any reason other than the benefit of the local people.\n\n“We are going to challenge this as 35,000 people are still displaced,” he said.�Mr Sumanthiran said more than 5000 cases would be filed in courts. �“We do not (seek) to find justice to Tamils by going to the courts – yet the cases will have an impact and give a message to the government as well as the international community,” he said.\n\n“Contradictory to expectations, all of a sudden land acquisition notices have been expedited not only in Jaffna but also in Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Mannar,” Mr Sumanthiran said.�Landowners say that Minister Douglas Devananda had previously given assurances that once the war ended, people would be given back their land.\n\nThe Minister of Lands, Janaka Bandara Tennekoon, said the Lands Office had been opened in Jaffna according to the recommendations of the LLRC in order to solve land issues. �“We have acquired land according to the law of this country,” he said.\n\n07 May 2013\n\nThe Jaffna Press Club expressed concern on Tuesday, regarding copycat social media accounts after it emerged a copycat Twitter account had been created asserting itself as the Jaffna Press Club.\n\nIn a statement the consortium of journalists said:\n\n“We believe these to be yet again another pattern of distraction, intimidation and hindrance of press freedom in Jaffna.”\n\nJPC has confirmed @JaffnaPressClub as its official Twitter account.\n\n‘YELLOW CARD’ FROM EU TO BE WITHDRAWN IN JUNE – RAJITHA\n\nMay 8, 2013\n\nSri Lanka’s government is confident that a European Union warning on illegal fishing in the island will be retracted soon paving the way for German and Chinese investors to double fish export income to around half a billion U. S. dollars, an official said today.\n\nExtensive lobbying has been done since the warning was issued in November 2012 with the EU officials indicating that it will withdraw its “yellow card” in June, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Rajitha Senaratne told media.\n\nThe warning was issued to Sri Lanka and seven other countries over illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. The minister said the EU had complained about 11 cases during the past year where Sri Lankan fishermen had intruded into territorial waters of other countries.\n\nHowever, Senaratne was upbeat of the progress insisting that he had worked hard to ban illegal fishing methods including bottom trawling nets that deplete fish habitats and had imposed stronger penalties for fishermen that illegally fish in seas belonging to other countries.\n\nLegal amendments that impose heavy fines of around 200,000 U.S. dollars and prison sentences are to be presented before parliament to be passed into law shortly, he added.\n\n“I have had extensive discussions with European Commissioner Maria Damanaki, who is in charge of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries and she has indicated that the EU is satisfied with our progress,” he said.\n\nCurrently Sri Lanka earns around 250 million U.S. dollars annually from fish exports, out of which 48 percent are earnings from tuna.\n\nEurope usually purchases around 38 percent of Sri Lanka’s fish exports but this amount has fallen to 33 percent last year with Japan and the U.S. increasing its stake to 47 percent and 17 percent respectively.\n\nSenaratne remarked that agreements have been finalised with two companies from China and Japan to increase deep sea fishing, which has seen slow growth due to lack of equipment.\n\n“Two deep sea fishing boats from Sri Lanka are expected in Sri Lanka within the next two weeks. Eventually we hope the number will increase to around 20 and we are having discussions with other Chinese companies to enter the market as well.”\n\nJapan’s leading fish producer, known as “Tuna King”, Kiyomura Corporation Chairman Kiyoshi Kimura, will also start a company in Sri Lanka soon, the Minister assured.\n\nBoth companies will be registered in Sri Lanka and will operate under the Sri Lankan flag. Once they are in operation, the Sri Lankan government expects fishing revenue to double hitting 500 million U.S. dollars, Xinhua reports.\n\nPosted by Thavam\n\n↧\n\nMarkham kids show off robotics skills in South Korea\n\nMarkham kids show off robotics skills in South Korea\n\nRobot warriors\n\nJonathan Ara Yapeter and Maaran Murugathas took home a medal from the recent International Robot Olympiad in South Korea.

A spokesperson for the Queen, who is the head of the Commonwealth, has confirmed that it would be the first time since 1973 the head of the Commonwealth would not be present at an important summit for the group.\n\nDavid Cameron and Rajapaksa\n\nSri Lanka has failed on the fundamental values of the Commonwealth, such as Democracy, Human rights, Tolerance, Respect and understanding, Separation of powers, Rule of law, Freedom of expression and Good governance.\n\nThe PM’s decision has angered the British Tamils and the rational to his decision is baseless. Sri Lanka has failed to implement any of the positive recommendations of its own Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), which a United Nations (UN) resolution (19.L.2) adopted in the Human Rights Council (HRC) in March 2012 called for. Furthermore Sri Lanka has categorically rejected the HRC resolution (22/L.1) which was adopted in March 20013.\n\nIn November 2012, the Foreign Affairs Committee in its report urged the PM to announce his unwillingness to attend the CHOGM in Sri Lanka. His actions will also put Her Majesty the Queen in a difficult position in sending a representation on her behalf when Human Rights Organisations are calling for a Boycott or a venue change.\n\nThe PM to announce his intention to attend six months in advance is ill-timed and will be seen as a clear message to encourage the other heads of States to attend the summit since there are many supports for the boycott call.

Anonymous thus decided to use its current popularity within the public to give voice to the voiceless.”\n\nThe “Anons” (as members of the collective are known) behind OpRohingya plan to target those they deem to be guilty of, or apathetic about, what they consider to be ethnic cleansing of Myanmar’s Muslim minority.\n\nThose targets may include Myanmar’s most prominent and widely beloved political figure, Aung San Suu Skyi.\n\n“[Targeting Suu Kyi] is debatable. I (@CIApressoffice) cannot speak for my fellow Anons on the matter. Let’s just say … it’s very possible,” said the @CIApressoffice account contributor.\n\nSuu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Laureate, was long lauded for her democratic struggle against the oppressive military junta that ruled Myanmar for over five decades. However, she is now facing criticism for her failure to help resolve the conflict between the country’s Buddhist majority and Muslim minority.\n\n“She believes, in Burma, there is no Rohingya ethnic group. It is a made-up name of the Bengali. So she can’t say anything about Rohingya. But there is international pressure for her to speak about Rohingya. It’s a problem,” Suu Kyi’s spokesman Nyan Win told Patrick Winn, GlobalPost’s senior correspondent in Southeast Asia.\n\nSome Anons who spoke to GlobalPost pointed out that the Rohingya are threatened on two fronts: by anti-Muslim mobs and by a government complicit in the violence against Muslims.\n\n“The Rohingya people are under [the] oppression of their government and local people,” said one Anon, affiliated with the Anonymous-linked account @Crypt0nymous. “It was clear that this is a humanitarian crisis like the one facing the people of Gaza, the West Bank/Israel, Kashmir and Gabon.”\n\nPosted by Thavam\n\n↧\n\nAssaulting The Rugby Referee: ‘It Was A Misunderstanding’ – Namal Rajapaksa\n\nAssaulting The Rugby Referee: ‘It Was A Misunderstanding’ – Namal Rajapaksa\n\nMay 9, 2013 |\n\nNamal Rajapaksa MP today said his younger brother’s attack to a Rugby referee ‘was a misunderstanding’.

Zaman asked “@RajapaksaNamal, did your younger brother Rohitha Rajapaksa attack the refree at 7 a side game… is it true?”\n\nPresidential offspring Rohitha Rajapaksa assaulted Rugby referee Dimitri Gunasekera on May 05th at the Havelocks Grounds in Colombo after the Navy lost a qualifying match.\n\nThe incident took place when the Police A team defeated Navy knocking the latter out of the Inter-club Rugby sevens tournament organised by the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union.\n\nRohitha Rajapaksa, the youngest son of President Mahinda Rajapaksa was captaining the Navy A team at today’s game. His brother Yoshitha usually captains the team.\n\nFollowing the Navy defeat, Rohitha Rajapaksa picked up referee Gunesekera by the collar and assaulted him in full public view, eyewitnesses say. The attack on the referee only ceased when Yoshitha Rajapaksaintervened, even slapping his younger sibling when the latter refused to break up the altercation.\n\nWith referees refusing to stand to protest against the assault, the tournament was suspended for over 45 minutes. Finally, following a meeting of high level officials with the referees the tournament resumed. Both Rohitha and Yoshitha Rajapaksa were seen regularly in discussions with the referees during the rest of the evening.\n\nThe game of Rugby in the country has been severely politicised by the Rajapaksa family in recent years.\n\nPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa’s second son Yoshitha is the captain of the Sri Lanka Rugby team and the Navy Sports club.\n\nRelated posts;\n\nPartisan Amnesty International Targets Sri Lanka\n\nBy Lakshman I.Keerthisinghe -May 9, 2013\n\nLakshman Keerthisinghe\n\nThe cold neutrality of an impartial judge -Edmund Burke-Preface to the Address of M.Brissot\n\nReuters reported recently that Amnesty says Sri Lanka represses dissent to consolidate power.The report stated that Amnesty International said that the Sri Lankan government is intensifying a crackdown on critics in order to tighten its grip on power, and urged the Commonwealth countries not to hold a summit there in November. But the Media Minister of the Sri Lankan government Keheliya Rambukwella accused Amnesty International of being in the pay of supporters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), once known as the most brutal terrorist organization in the world defeated in a nearly 30-year war that ended in May 2009. The Minister further stated that Amnesty is always against Sri Lanka and they never see anything positive. We accept still there are some problems, but they need to see what we have done good also.”\n\nThe London-based rights group, citing specific rights abuses in a 78-page report entitled ‘Sri Lanka’s Assault on Dissent’ said a crackdown on critics had intensified through threats, harassment, imprisonment and violent attacks.”Violent repression of dissent and the consolidation of political power go hand in hand in Sri Lanka,” said Polly Truscott, Amnesty International’s Deputy Asia Pacific Director.”Over the past few years we have seen space for criticism decrease. There is a real climate of fear in Sri Lanka, with those brave enough to speak out against the government often having to suffer badly for it.”The rights group further said the report was based on interviews with witnesses, lawyers and activists, legal affidavits, court records, reports by Sri Lankan, United Nations and international human rights organizations, as well as local and international media reports. The report also said journalists, the judiciary, human rights activists and opposition politicians were among those who have been targeted in a pattern of government-sanctioned abuse, often involving the security forces or their proxies.\n\nAmnesty International was founded in London in July 1961 by English labour lawyer Peter Benenson According to his own account, he was traveling in the London Underground on 19 November 1960, when he read of two Portuguese students from Coimbra who had been sentenced to seven years of imprisonment in Portugal for allegedly “having drunk a toast to liberty” Researchers have never traced the alleged newspaper article in question. In 1960, Portugal was ruled by the Estado Novo government of Antonio de Oliveira Salazar The government was authoritarian in nature and strongly anti-communist, suppressing enemies of the state as anti-Portuguese. In his significant newspaper article “The Forgotten Prisoners”, Benenson later described his reaction as follows: “Open your newspaper any day of the week and you will find a story from somewhere of someone being imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government The newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence. Yet if these feelings of disgust could be united into common action, something effective could be done.” The article described these violations occurring, on a global scale, in the context of restrictions to press freedom, to political oppositions, to timely public trial before impartial courts, and to asylum. It marked the launch of “Appeal for Amnesty, 1961″, the aim of which was to mobilise public opinion, quickly and widely, in defence of these individuals, whom Benenson named “Prisoners of Conscience”. The “Appeal for Amnesty” was reprinted by a large number of international newspapers. In the same year Benenson had a book published, Persecution 1961, which detailed the cases of nine prisoners of conscience were investigated and compiled by Benenson and Baker In July 1961 the leadership had decided that the appeal would form the basis of a permanent organisation, Amnesty, with the first meeting taking place in London. Benenson ensured that all three major political parties were represented, enlisting Members of Parliament from the Labour Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party On 30 September 1962, it was officially named ‘Amnesty International’. Between the ‘Appeal for Amnesty, 1961′ and September 1962 the organisation had been known simply as ‘Amnesty’.\n\nAmnesty International is financed largely by fees and donations from its worldwide membership. It says that it does not accept donations from governments or governmental organisations. According to the AI website, “these personal and unaffiliated donations allow AI to maintain full independence from any and all governments, political ideologies, economic interests or religions. We neither seek nor accept any funds for human rights research from governments or political parties and we accept support only from businesses that have been carefully vetted. By way of ethical fundraising leading to donations from individuals, we are able to stand firm and unwavering in our defence of universal and indivisible human rights.” However, AI did receive grants from the UK Department of International Development the European Commission the US State Department and other governments contrary to its aforesaid policies. In November 2012, the Amnesty staff in London went on strike to protest work conditions and financial issues with the organisation. Gerald Steinberg, of NGO Monitor said, “They really are in trouble. They’ve been in crisis for a number of years.”\n\nCriticism of Amnesty International includes claims of excessive pay for management, under-protection of overseas staff, associating with organisations with a dubious record on human rights protection, selection bias, ideological /foreign policy bias against either non-Western countries or Western-supported countries, criticism of Amnesty’s policies relating to abortion, and assertion that “defensive jihad” is not antithetical to human rights. Governments who have criticised Amnesty include those of Canada Israel, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo the People’s Republic of China, Vietnam, Russia and the United States,[ for what they assert is one-sided reporting or a failure to treat threats to security as a mitigating factor. The actions of these governments—and of other governments critical of Amnesty International—have been the subject of human rights concerns voiced by Amnesty. As of February 2011, Amnesty is engaged in a dispute with the British union ‘Unite over Amnesty’ allegedly attempting to de-recognize some of its foreign-based workers’ rights.(Wikepedia)\n\nIn the above scenario it is an open secret that cash strapped Amnesty may receive funds from the diaspora and the TGTE who are hell bent on destabilizing the legitimately elected Sri Lankan government and replacing it with a puppet regime amenable to the US and its Western allies in order to gain support for their separatist agenda to establish a State of Eelam in the North and East of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe reporting by the Amnesty is therefore biased and one sided as Minister Rambukwella very correctly stated thereby ignoring all the welfare activities undertaken by the Sri Lankan government for the rehabilitation of the former LTTE cadres, providing them with funding,employment and housing and the replacement of the displaced persons during the conflict by returning them to live happily in their former areas where they lived prior to the unfortunate civil war.\n\nIn conclusion it is noteworthy to consider whether the Amnesty International could maintain impartiality in its reports emulating the cold neutrality of an impartial judge as quoted at the outset of this piece as it is obvious that cash strapped AI has to do the bidding of its paymasters.\n\nPosted by Thavam\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSigns of Coming Genocide in Burma?\n\nSigns of Coming Genocide in Burma?\n\nArmy trucks line up along a road in downtown Meikhtila on March 23. (Photo: Teza Hlaing / The Irrawaddy )\n\nBy SAI LATT / THE IRRAWADDY| Wednesday, May 8, 2013 |\n\nThe Burmese majority are in a state of denial that Burma now displays the early warning signs of genocide, “ethnic cleansing” or “crimes against humanity.” Rights activists are among them. Aung Myo Min, the director of Human Rights Education Institute of Burma (HREIB), has called the findings of last month’s Human Rights Watch report into violence in Arakan State “unacceptable.”\n\nBy rejecting the use of the term “ethnic cleansing” to describe the attacks on Rohingya Muslims there, these people have become both active and passive accomplices to the crimes. The criminals enjoy safe haven, continuing to pursue a situation where full-scale mass killings are possible. They run the risk of staying silent while all the warning signs are there.\n\nBurmese tend to conflate “ethnic cleansing” and genocide based on two assumptions: that the outbreak of violence is sudden and that many thousands are killed. This is a misconception, leading many Burmese to assume genocide has not taken place in their country. The longer-term campaigns that lay the groundwork for the mass slaughter do not seem to matter. For them, speaking out about what might be coming is unacceptable incitement.\n\nBut internationally-recognized definitions are broader. The 1948 Genocide Convention defines genocide as constituted by acts committed with intent to destroy an ethnic, racial or religious group. Physical as well as mental injury is included in the definition, as is preventing births and transferring children to destroy a group’s existence.\n\nEven the April 29 government-sponsored Arakan Conflict Inquiry Commission’s report, according to this definition, can be considered as part of a form of genocide. One of many potentially destructive recommendations in the report is promoting birth control among Rohingya women. Whether intended to be so or not, this policy is genocidal.\n\nIn the cities and towns, far removed from the violence, the killings are out of sight, out of mind. This is what happened in Rwanda in 1994, when in the space of about 100 days at least 800,000 Rwandans were killed, mostly from the Tutsi minority. Rwanda’s genocide was not a sudden “outbreak.” The conditions for full-scale killing were developed over many years, particularly the 40 months prior to April 1994.\n\nPeter Uvin, a former UN officer and the author of Aiding Violence, explains these events. Shocking are not just the events, but the neglect over the signs of genocide. The signs were clear, but people simply ignored them. These signs are now visible in Burma. This does not mean that Burma will inevitably become the next Rwanda; but the point is that the signs of pre-April 1994 Rwanda can be detected in Burma today.\n\nPrior to April 1994, the international community was congratulating the ethnic Hutu-dominated government for improved state capacity, and awarding it with aid money. What was the award for? Economic reform. Millions upon millions of dollars of developmental aid were channeled to the country. The government had complete control over foreign aid money in Rwanda. More than 80 percent went to the governmental sector and the rest needed government approval. Despite on-going gross abuses the US, for example, did not even bother reducing military aid.\n\nRecent international engagement with Burma, the inflow of aid money, International Crisis Group’s award to President Thein Sein, and the US’s plan for military engagement, are the Burmese equivalent of Rwanda.\n\nIn Rwanda, the US, EU, the World Bank, bilateral donors, and international organizations all moved away from working with the community towards directly engaging with the government. Programs were designed to build up human capacity for the government. The government openly discussed genocide in cabinet meetings. But international donor governments ended up helping and strengthening it by pouring in money.\n\nThe government bought arms from abroad; 581,000 machetes were imported from China. According to British journalist Linda Melvern, an arms deal worth $26 million was signed with Egypt in 1990.\n\nHate messages against Tutsis were openly broadcasted on radio stations. Thousands of Tutsis were already being massacred. The international community not only failed to react, but continued to present a positive image of the government’s reform initiatives.\n\nAlthough it was not sure how much power-holders within the international community knew what was happening in Rwanda, there were two reports published in 1993, one by four NGOs and another by the UN special rapporteur. They detailed massive arms distribution, extreme anti-Tutsi rhetoric, and government-backed killings mainly targeting Tutsis. No one reacted.\n\nFor Burma, the recent report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and statements by UN envoys to Burma, Mr. Tomas Quintana and Mr. Vijay Nambiar, detail mass killing, systematic and widespread violence against ethnic Rohingya. Mr. Quintana stated in the case of anti-Muslim violence in central Burma that he received evidence of state involvement, while Mr. Nambiar stated the violence was done with “brutal efficiency”.\n\nEven more disturbing in the case of Rwanda is that the UN secretariat was well informed about potential genocide by General Romeo Dallaire, head of UN peace keeping in Rwanda. But information was ignored.\n\nA Human Rights Watch report pointed out that a CIA analyst predicted in January 1994 that half a million people would die. In February, Belgium predicted mass killing. France also knew enough. But they did not react until late April.\n\nInternational development aid workers in Rwanda were aware of killings and abuses. They did not speak out for various personal and organizational reasons. They kept silent as they did not expect the scale of violence to be so massive. They were in a state of denial, just like the Burmese today.\n\nGenocide could not happen without turning a large portion of the population into thugs and killers. As Alison Desforges detailed in a Human Rights Report on Rwanda, genocide is a campaign to which potential killers are recruited over time.\n\nBut people did not simply become killers. They were turned into mass murderers by propaganda that drugged their mind with misinformation and lies. Some key points from the report detailed by Alison Desforges are worth paying attention to, as similar signs can be seen in Burma.\n\nIn Rwanda, the newspaper Kangura (meaning: “wake others up”) was the most vocal “voice of hate”. It was soon joined by other journals and newspapers that have ties to politicians and businesses linked to the regime. Radio stations were established. They performed their function by stroking racism and providing misinformation so that the people became delusional and bloodthirsty.\n\nIn Burma, local media is stirring up resentment of Rohingya and Burmese Muslims.\n\nSince hate messages require validation, propagandists refer to the work of “intellectuals” or “professors”. In Rwanda, two professors, Nahimana and Leon Mugesera, played a key role. They both studied in the West. They taught at universities in Rwanda before becoming propagandists. The equivalents of these “intellectuals” in Burma are not hard to find.\n\nIn Rwanda, Tutsi were described as foreigners who stole the land from the rightful owners, the Hutu. Hutu propagandists accused “Tutsi Unity” to be the idea that facilitated Tutsi’s past conquest and helped in their quest for domination.\n\nIn Burma, ethnic Rohingyas, and now Burmese Muslims, are widely portrayed as foreigners. They are said to be taking over the land, race and Buddhist religion. Equivalent to “Tutsi Unity” was the number “786” used by Muslims. According to anti-Muslim preachers, 786 stands for Muslims take over of Burma and the world in the 21st century. According to Muslims, it represents a Quranic phrase: “In the name of God, most Gracious, most Compassionate”.\n\nTutsis in Rwanda were labeled “cockroaches”. In Burma, followers of these propagandists have called the Rohingyas “viruses” and “dogs”.\n\nAs the case of Rwanda shows, the Hutu-led government was cunning and ruthless. Propagandists were drugging people with misinformation only to turn them into mindless murderers. Many people were being killed every day but the international community ended up supporting the regime in the name of economic reform. Even though the governments of the West appeared to know that genocide was coming, they could not take action until too late. Westerners staying in Rwanda did not expect a full scale slaughter. But it happened.\n\nIn Burma, most people reject the term genocide to protect the innocence of the nation they are so dear to. It is hard to imagine that their denial supports mass slaughter. But denying the warning signs is not really serving their purpose; it only blocks attempts to take preventive measures so that unimaginable cruelty is not unleashed.\n\nUnlike Rwanda, Burma has been forewarned. Taking advantage of this, serious preventive actions must be taken. If such cruel human slaughter ever happens in Burma, all those who have blocked investigation and preventive measures are share responsibility. After all, it is the majority Burmese who have the power to shape the the country’s fate.\n\nSai Latt is a Burmese and a PhD candidate at Simon Fraser University in Canada.

Credit: Amantha Perera/IPS\n\nPUTTALAM, Sri Lanka, May 8 2013 (IPS) - The camp should not have been difficult to find. We were told to drive straight on the road that leads north away from the town of Puttalam, 140 kilometres from Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo, and we would come upon the settlement of internally displaced people.\n\nWhat IPS found were not the typical temporary shelters of the war displaced – no tarpaulins stamped with the telltale insignia of donor agencies, no busy aid workers; only a cluster of small villages comprised of white-painted houses on the outskirts of Puttalam’s narrow traffic-clogged, sewer-lined streets.\n\nBut on close inspection it became clear that these were, indeed, the homes of the roughly 75,000 Muslims and their descendants who were forced to flee the northern provinces at the height of this country’s civil war in 1990.\n\nIPS spoke with Ahamed Lebbe, a casual labourer in his fifties originally from the village of Pallai in the northern Jaffna Peninsula, who said his life changed forever on Oct. 29, 1990, when the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) – the rebel group that was then fighting the Sri Lankan government for a separate state for the island’s minority Tamil population – ordered all Muslims to evacuate the province within 24 hours.\n\nThe message that he would have to leave with nothing more than 300 rupees (about two dollars) in cash came to Lebbe by word of mouth, though there is some evidence the Tigers made a public announcement in Jaffna Town earlier that day.\n\nThe public rationale behind the order was that Muslims, along with their fledgling national political party, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, represented a threat to the Tigers’ ideal of ethnic hegemony in the North, which formed the basis of their demand for an independent Tamil state.\n\nThe command was taken dead seriously and on the night of Oct. 29 the exodus began, with one Muslim family after another leaving behind homes, valuables and businesses, carrying with them only the meagre monies allowed by the LTTE, fear, and memories.\n\n“There were only four Muslim families in the village where we lived,” Lebbe told IPS. “But it was our home – I still speak in the Tamil dialect used in Jaffna.”\n\nTwenty-three years later, Lebbe has still not regained a sense of belonging, even though he has lived half of his life in an exclusively Muslim village in Puttalam.\n\n“There is always this sense that we don’t belong here, that we are not at home,” he said.\n\nThe number of IDPs living in these semi-permanent “camps” has now swelled to nearly 250,000, according to some researchers. The majority never left the northwestern coastal belt, where they arrived over two decades ago.\n\nLocals’ initial welcome of the refugees quickly turned to resentment when it became clear that these visitors would not be leaving anytime soon, and would ultimately start clamouring for scarce government resources like jobs, schools and healthcare.\n\nEmployers here wasted no time identifying the displaced as a source of cheap labour, quickly hiring them to work in sectors like construction, fishing, and agriculture, and as causal labourers.\n\nToday, the demand for government services in Puttalam is under enourmous stress. With a total population of 700,000 the province is one of the poorest in Sri Lanka. Ten to 11 percent of its residents live below the poverty line, compared to a national poverty rate of about eight percent.\n\nLocal authorities are also seriously concerned about the lack of safe water here, exacerbated of late by a long drought.\n\nMirak Raheem, former researcher with the Centre for Policy Alternatives, a national advocacy body, told IPS the infrastructure in Puttalam is in urgent need of an upgrade. He also stressed the importance of implementing development projects like road construction, which can create jobs for the displaced.\n\nFew incentives to return home\n\nEver since the government wiped out the LTTE in May 2009, over 400,000 Tamils who were displaced during the 30 years of fighting have been resettled, but no"
