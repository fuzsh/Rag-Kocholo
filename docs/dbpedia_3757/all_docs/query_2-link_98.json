        "text": "Freedom of the press in Sri Lanka is guaranteed by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka which gives every citizen \"the freedom of speech and expression including publication\".[1] But under some government's there was widespread suppression of the media, particularly those critical of those governments. Sri Lanka is ranked 146 out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders's Press Freedom Index for 2022\n\nFreedom House has judged the Sri Lankan press to be Partly free.[2]\n\nIntroduction\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough the constitution guarantees free speech it places significant limits on the exercise of this right.[3] Various laws and regulations, such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1979 brought in to deal with Tamil militants, have been used by successive governments to suppress freedom of expression.[3] During the JVP insurgency of 1989 and the Sri Lankan civil war, many journalists were killed, assaulted or went missing. 25 journalists were killed between 1999 and 2011.[4] Dozens fled abroad.\n\nMuch of the media in Sri Lanka is privately owned.[citation needed] Impunity for threats and violence against journalists and official censorship contributed to self-censorship by almost all media outlets.[5]\n\nThe civil war ended in May 2009 and there was an origin of a safe place for journalists, but attacks on the media have reduced but journalists continue to be harassed and intimidated.[3][6] In 2015, the new Government headed by UNP said that they will assure the Protection of freedom of Press, which had been reduced during the previous Rajapaksa government.\n\nReporters Without Borders reported in 2010 that, \"of the world's democratically-elected governments, Sri Lanka's is the one that respects press freedom least.\"[7]\n\nAssassinations of journalists\n\n[edit]\n\nThevis Guruge, chairman of the state-owned Independent Television Network, was killed on 23 July 1989.
