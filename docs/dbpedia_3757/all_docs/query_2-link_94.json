Between 1983 and 2009 there was an intermittent civil war, predominantly between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist militant organisation who fight for the creation of an independent state named Tamil Eelam in the North and East of the island. The UN has estimated that up to 1000,000 people (combatants and civilians) may have been killed during the 26 years of fighting.[2] The civil war has caused significant harm to the population and economy of the country, as well as leading to the ban of the LTTE as a terrorist organisation in 32 countries including the United States, Australia, the countries of the European Union and Canada. The war ended in May 2009 when the Sri Lankan military defeated the LTTE. Numerous human rights violations have been committed by both the Sri Lankan military and the LTTE, including the assassination of individuals by both sides.\n\nAssassinations\n\nHeads of state and government\n\nVictim Position Date Location Method Perpetrator(s) Rajiv Gandhi Former Prime Minister of India 21 May 1991 Sriperumbudur, TN, India Suicide bombing LTTE is blamed, but they denied it until 2006.
