        "text": "I think it’s kinda cute…\n\nGet this episode on nyaa: softsub, hardsub.\n\nA little behind schedule compared to last release, but it’s fine. Not much to talk about for this episode, either. Once you get into a repetitive anime like this one you kinda run out of topics of interest at times, huh. Thankfully, though, things are going to be getting much more exciting soon - not including this one, there are only two more eps left to go before the Dream Watch saga! And only five more episodes until we get to something else I’ve been looking forward to subbing for a loooooong time…but you’ll just have to wait and see what that’s about :P\n\nToday’s Yo-kai was Aitatatimes (commonly misspelled as “Aitttimes.” Yeah that’s not the most appealing romanization). His name is based on the expression aitatata (あいたたた), which…well, Whisper explains it in the context of the episode, but it’s also just the default expression for pain, like our “owowow.” It’s also based on the Japanese spelling of “times”, taimuzu (タイムズ), since the first character is “ta” in katakana. “Times” as in common newspaper names, in this case.\n\nJust as a heads up, I might be taking an extra week off until the next episode since I have to finish up the semester and don’t wanna get too distracted from that. I haven’t decided for sure yet whether or not I’ll take it, but if the next episode’s a week late you’ll know why.\n\nCredits:\n\nMyself: Translation, timing, and typesetting\n\n@noroinohanak0: QC/final editing, encoding, and distribution\n\nThe OP and ED were taken directly from the episodes we did at NyoroZokuSubs, with permission from my partner. You can check out our website for more information about episodes 113-116 if you haven’t in the past!\n\nTalk about a bad hair day.\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! Softsub, hardsub.\n\nI don’t have much to say besides Tenparumba’s face accurately describes mine while typesetting this episode. Also, in real time, the anime officially ended this Friday. It was pretty anticlimactic. Well, that sure was a four-year long anime.\n\nNew Yo-kai #1 for today was Kanpe-chan…and it is directly explained in the episode so no need for me to go into detail here (assuming you know what the -chan honorific means since it’s become a bit infamous among western nerds - by the way, I usually omit honorifics unless it’s part of the Yo-kai’s name, I never keep them for humans though). #2 was Tenparumba, from tenparu (テンパる), “to blow one’s fuse” (that’s the dictionary definition but I translated it a couple of different ways) and the Japanese spelling of rumba (ルンバ), as in Rumba dance. It also comes from tenpa (天パ), “curly hair.” By the way, the letter M followed by a consonant is represented by the character for N in Japanese. This pretty much only applies to loan words though since authentic Japanese words never have two consonants after another unless it’s a double consonant (which is indicated by another character entirely). The more you know.\n\nToday’s cryptid corner (the last one for a couple of episodes) involves the Jersey Devil, an American myth (as USApyon mentions in the episode). It’s…from New Jersey. And it screams a lot. I usually don’t resort to Wikipedia pages but that’s the easiest option for me right now so here you go.\n\nAs a heads up, I am absolutely dreading next week’s episode. If you watched the raws way back when they were current, you might be able to guess why.\n\nRemember to keep yourself as nourished as you can during this crisis! Also this screenshot isn’t what it looks like I promise\n\nTorrent this episode! (Nyaa softsubs) (Nyaa hardsubs) (Nyaa pantsu) (Anidex) Watch this episode on Dailymotion or Vimeo!\n\nWe’re back again, baby! This release follows a number of episodes done by my fellow SpecterSubbers upwards of a year ago, so you’ll notice quite a few quality-of-life improvements in this one if you’re watching in order, namely:\n\nFINALLY fixed up some mistranslations in this OP/ED set (done by me like three years ago…yeesh now I have to wonder how many other things I got wrong in my earlier releases o_o)\n\nI decided to make the default font a little bigger. In hindsight, it’s been too tiny all this time.\n\nA few retranslations/term changes here and there for the Busters Treasure segment and Treasure Yo-kai stuff, since this is my first time translating an episode that has those things.\n\nI know the constant bouncing around in quality can get a little jarring…such is the strange history of Yo-kai Watch fansubs :V\n\nThis episode’s new Yo-kai were Yamatobokeru and Darumacho. Yamatobokeru is a terracotta figure who is apparently a reference to the legend of this guy, a Yamato dynasty-era prince named Yamato Takeru (how many Yamatos were in that sentence?). Tobokeru (惚ける/ とぼける ) can mean “to have a blank expression,” referring to…well, his expression, and boke (ボケ) refers to the funny man of a manzai comedy duo, which is basically what role Yamatobokeru here plays all the time. You’ll also notice a few other legendary figures/beings referenced in YW in the Wikipedia article I linked, though that’s neither here nor there. In English, Yamatobokeru’s name is “Fitwit,” which…I guess is “fit” and “twit” or “nitwit?” Yeah I kinda don’t get this one much. Darumacho’s name is much less complicated, being a simple combination of “daruma,” as in a daruma doll, and “macho.” He’s a Yo-kai Watch 1 Yo-kai, so his localized name has been known for a while…it’s the same! Always nice when a Yo-kai’s name works out perfectly as-is when bringing it over (because the name contained an English loan word to begin with :P).\n\n193 is a…Halloween episode? Never too early for Halloween, I guess (no I will not take until October to release it). In the meantime, I hope everyone stays well during what is surely a difficult time for many let’s overthrow capitalism when this pandemic is over.\n\nPresented to you without context.\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! Softsub, hardsub.\n\nAn episode with virtually no typesetting (except for one VERY annoying part…) means a slightly early release! And I’ve been able to trim down total episode work time to ~5-6 hours, not counting QC. It’s the little things. Anyway, I hope you liked all the octopus ball orgasming last time, because there’s even more food porn in here. Do not ever watch this show on an empty stomach, friends.\n\nThis week’s new Yo-kai was Kameppa. It took me a little while to figure out what the pun is here, but I think it’s the verb kamu (嚙む), a multi-definition word used in this context as “to rebuke/scold”, conjugated in the -pa form (usually written out fully as -panashi/ぱなし), an ending that indicates that the action is done repeatedly. The second part of the pun is the Japanese loan-word from English, surippa (スリッパ), obviously meaning “slipper.” Basically, angry slipper.\n\nNot much else here to say. We’re halfway through Komarly Hills, by the way. It’s going by so fast :(\n\nCredits (which I forgot to put in the last post wow way to go me):\n\nMyself: Translation, timing, and typesetting\n\n@noroinohanak0: QC/final editing, encoding, and distribution\n\nI’ll just let you try and figure out what’s going on here.\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! Softsub, hardsub.\n\nEarly release this time around! Figured I owed it to you all since I took an extended break last time. Plus, I really just wanted to get this one over with since next episode is such a big deal. Unfortunately it’s time to say goodbye to Investigation Files, but there’s tons of fun stuff coming up (including my favorite side segment of all time in a few episodes!), so don’t worry.\n\nThis episode technically introduced two Yo-kai, although only one was recorded in the recap. The first of these is Iekabe, a fusion of Ieay and Murikabe who isn’t actually in the games…obviously, his name is just supposed to be a portmanteau of the Yo-kai that combined to form him, but if taken literally, I guess it could mean house (ie, 家) + wall (kabe, 壁). The main Yo-kai of the episode was Demonade. demo ne (でもね) is a phrase that can be translated a few different ways, as I demonstrate in the episode, but most commonly as “then again…” or “but you know…”. The other part of the pun is the kana spelling of the borrowed English word “lemonade” (レモネード).\n\nNext time, the Dream Watch is finally here! I’m just as excited as I’m sure you all are, so I’ll try to get on it as soon as possible, though obviously a new OP/ED set means a little extra work for me. Bear with me!\n\nCredits:\n\nMyself: Translation, timing, and typesetting\n\n@noroinohanak0: QC/final editing, encoding, and distribution\n\nThe OP and ED were taken directly from the episodes we did at NyoroZokuSubs, with permission from my partner. You can check out our website for more information about episodes 113-116 if you haven’t in the past!\n\nOh boy he’s back\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! (Softsub, hardsub)\n\nWatch this episode on vimeo or dailymotion!\n\nSo here we are jumping a whole ten episodes away from my last release. I would have preferred to have this out sooner but alas it was “one of those” episodes with regards to the typesetting. Special thanks to Lumpstud and Noroinohanako for help with some particularly difficult spots (I could’ve sworn I put Lumpstud in the episode credits but I didn’t realize until after the final encode was being submitted that she wasn’t there, so please be aware that she did contribute). This was a very good episode if I do say so myself (at least the last two segments). It’s nice to see a Yo-kai of the Day segment end on a sweet note with no last-minute shock jokes, and I’m sure you all know how I feel about the “Komarly Hills” gang…\n\nThis episode’s Yo-kai of the Day is Nopperabo, a Yo-kai from YW2 to break the recent trend of all the new Yo-kai being from 3. Being a classic Yo-kai, Nopperabo’s name is taken from the mythological “faceless ghost” (or faceless monk), or nopperabou (のっぺらぼう). Here’s some background, if you’re interested. “Faysoff” was the name they went with in the English dub, as the classic Yo-kai’s names are usually changed from the originals (though interestingly, the 7 Lucky Gods’ names in YW3 were kept).\n\nThere was also a multitude of puns in this episode that I localized, but here’s the literal translations for the curious:\n\nAbout the 4 minute mark - Nyanpachi makes a pun on the word robo (self-explanatory) and boro (meaning “shabby” or “junky”), since robo is comprised of the katakana characters for ro and bo, and when read backwards, you get boro.\n\nAround 14:24 - So “There’s Something About Koma” is a direct reference to the film “There’s Something About Mary,” which in Japanese is merii ni kubitakke (hence koma ni kubitakke). Whisper’s proposal is wisupaa wa kubi dake, which sounds similar to the Japanese name of the movie, and literally means “Whisper is All Head.” Obviously the phonetic stuff doesn’t work in English, so I just looked for a title of another family comedy that I could feasibly pun :L\n\n15:28 to 15:38 - The Japanese word for “base” (as in the base of a triangle) is teihen. The teacher made a pun on teihen with teehen, a colloquial version of taihen, meaning “terrible,” “awful,” “great,“ etc. Do kids actually say “based” or is that not a thing outside of the Internet?\n\nHang on a second, folks. We’re not done here for today just yet…\n\nSomething something fellow kids\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! Softsub, hardsub.\n\nHey guys, are you ready for Story Time With Kirb™? Here goes!\n\nKomarly Hills 90210 (title in reference to Beverly Hills 90210, a show that is completely inappropriate for this anime’s target demographic) is our new running segment for the next 8 episodes, and it’s my absolute favorite side segment out of the whole bunch. It’s awfully cheesy in the best way possible, the KK Bros are way too adorable, and my favorite Yo-kai gets owned 8 times in a row! Can’t get any better than that. I loved this segment so much, in fact, that a long, long time ago (and by a long, long time ago I mean like a little over a year ago) I actually decided to translate the entire thing mostly just for personal reference, and that turned into “hey why don’t I splice all the eps together and figure out how to sub them?”, and then that eventually turned into me making “Komarly Hills the Movie” and releasing it to a few friends. Except my skills back then were subpar and the translation was horrible so that little project is going in the Disney Vault for the rest of my life. But that did indeed get me to learn Aegisub and buckle down hard on the Japanese studying, and a month or so after it was all said and done a friend who’d known about the Komarly Hills thing directed me towards who would become my partner from the old NyoroZoku group…and the rest is history! So tl;dr, this segment’s the only reason I’m here subbing in the first place, so you ought to thank Jinmen Dog for everything. And boy, is it going to be cathartic revisiting Komarly Hills now that I actually know what the hell I’m doing.\n\nThis has been Story Time With Kirb™…wait, you mean other things besides Komarly Hills happened in this episode?! Oh…\n\nTwo (three?) new Yo-kai this episode once again. The first are the KK Brothers (known separately as K-Koma and K-Jiro), whose names are…uh…the Komabros’…but cooler…? Yeah there’s not any actual wordplay going on here so moving right along. The other new Yo-kai is Kangaeroo, a pun on kangaeru (考える), a verb that has so many meanings that I’m just gonna link you to its dictionary definition because I’m too lazy to list them out. In the context of this episode, though, it’s used as “to ponder,” “to anticipate,” or just plain old “to think about”.\n\nI’ve been pretty good at keeping a schedule, huh? This marks the 4th weekly release in a row! Watch that change now that I’ve said that…\n\nCredits:\n\nMyself: Translation, timing, and typesetting\n\n@noroinohanak0: QC/final editing, encoding, and distribution\n\nAs part of Yo-kai Watch’s attempt to attract an older audience, they gave Jibanyan a gun.\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! Softsub, hardsub.\n\nBlech. I hate the latter half of this episode so much. Just a warning: if you don’t wanna see weird borderline fetishy stuff with Keita just skip the Souname segment entirely. You won’t be missing anything significant plot-wise. This show might be known for its raunchiness, but there’s a difference between poop jokes and being extremely creepy with child characters. So yeah that part’s gross and I don’t like it. At least we finally see some Dream Link stuff this episode (AKA “please buy more of our toys kids”). That Blaster is quite the dangerous tool to give to an 11-year-old.\n\nAnyway, as previously mentioned, the new Yo-kai this episode was Souname, from souname (総なめ), for “sweeping victory,” and nameru ( 舐める), “to lick.” He is the evolved form of Akaname, a Classic Yo-kai that appeared way back in the first season (or second season if you follow the English dub’s divisions). We have no cryptid corner this episode, but it’ll be back next week (I thought we had another episode without that segment but I was wrong :L).\n\nTop 10 Photos Taken Just Before Disaster\n\nTorrent this episode!

What, would you rather wait until October for a new episode? :P\n\nAnyways, I should probably clarify a couple things about this blog. I keep getting asks in my inbox that I don’t always have an answer to individually so please please please direct all questions to @spectersubs​ instead of this account unless they are about some post on this blog specifically being broken. This blog is still used to put my original series releases on since I did so many before the group was created but virtually all of my sub work on the series is a joint effort with them now so questions about release schedules and the other seasons of the show are best fielded over there. I’ve noticed people having problems with torrents and things; unfortunately there isn’t anything I/we can do about old torrents dying and mirrors being taken down so until we can find a permanent solution to that (we’re a little tied up with new releases for the time being), so for now use a streaming service of your choice if there are no other options available (but keep your antivirus and popup blockers on). But we have discussed this issue in our discord server that you can find a link to over on the SpecterSubs blog, so you can ask us stuff there too!\n\nThere’s no new Yo-kai or anything to exposit about this time, so just sit back and enjoy the ride! Episode 195 is probably going to be a while since the group is currently focused on Yo-kai Academy Y, so once again keep your eyes peeled on the SpecterSubs tumblr, twitter and discord for updates."
