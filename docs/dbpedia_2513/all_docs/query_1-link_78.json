        "text": "Teletoon’s online schedule has confirmed that the second season of the Yo-Kai Watch anime will premiere on the channel on Saturday, October 1st at 2PM. Season 2, which consists of episodes 27-56, has been airing in the US on Disney XD since August 1st.\n\nThis season, join Nate, Whisper and Jibanyan as they get the new Yokai Watch Model Zero. But just because he has a new watch, that doesn’t mean Nate’s life will get any easier. Season 2 has more Yo-kai, more miniseries, more episodes and, most importantly, more laughs! Tune in to see how a new cast of Yo-kai interrupts Nate’s normal life in unexpected and hilarious ways.\n\nNaturally, a new season of the show means new toys, games, trading cards and manga. Nintendo of Canada just held a Yo-Kai Watch 2 video game launch event in Toronto yesterday afternoon. They’ll be holding similar preview sessions across the country next weekend.\n\nWe’re also supposed to be getting Yo-Kai Watch: The Movie Event in theatres, but right now Canadian details are nonexistent. I’ll let you know when things start to materialize.\n\nIn other news:\n\nBeyblade Burst reruns are set to air on Disney XD Canada starting Sunday, October 2nd at 9AM & 6:30PM, with an additional 2AM slot on Mondays. This marks the first anime series to air on the channel. The perks of having a Canadian dub and dealing with a company that will struggle to find (at least tonally) on-brand Canadian content?\n\nBlazing Team, the Chinese-American yo-yo action cartoon from Hasbro and Audley (these guys), looks to be going into repeats on Cartoon Network Canada this weekend. No season 2 global premiere here.\n\nAll times listed in Eastern.\n\nThanks Greg!"
