It consists of The Wandering Orochi: Act 3: Hell's Army, Yo-kai Drizzelda and Ray O'Light and Yo-kai Jumbelina stories.\n\nPart 1: The Wandering Orochi: Act 3: Hell's Army\n\nThis time, Venoct is at Nate’s school, and surprisingly Jibanyan actually notices him first this time. As before, Venoct wants to share information about his quest for Red J. Venoct has found out that Red J apparently also has an evil army. Said evil army is apparently roused when a particular bell is rung—which Nate immediately figures out is the school bell, and Red J’s “evil army” is actually just the elementary school students.\n\nVenoct continues his report, detailing the brutal training regimen of the “evil army.” The evil army craves meat so much that they will kill each other just to have it—a rather fanciful description of lunchtime at school. Furthermore, they also train by catching “burning balls”, which is actually just the kids playing dodgeball during gym class.\n\nVenoct concludes that Red J is not present at the school (despite that fact that he’s obviously describing the school) and bids Jibanyan farewell, swearing vengeance upon Red J as he soars off into the sky once more.\n\nPart 2: Yo-kai Drizzelda and Ray O’Light\n\nNate and his classmates are out enjoying a school trip on a beautiful sunny day, when suddenly it starts pouring rain with no warning whatsoever. Nate is drying himself off when Katie walks up to him and starts claiming it’s her fault that it’s raining. On a hunch, Nate checks her with the Yo-kai Watch which reveals Drizzelda inspiriting her. Drizzelda causes it to rain, regardless of what the weather report might have said would happen that day.\n\nNate’s not going to tolerate rain ruining the class picnic, so he summons Jibanyan to get rid of Drizzelda. This was clearly a bad idea, because Jibanyan hates the rain and refuses to fight. However, at that moment the suave Yo-kai Ray O’Light suddenly shows up to save the day. Ray’s effect is the exact opposite of Drizzelda’s, causing it to be sunny whenever it’s supposed to rain that day.\n\nDrizzelda is flustered by Ray’s sudden appearance and dashes off. Nate wonders why she would run off in such a hurry, so Ray explains how he’s been basically stalking Drizzelda, trying to get her to smile. Jibanyan points out that he’s just being a creep and he needs a different approach. Nate suggests summoning a Yo-kai to make Ray more likeable, but Whisper decides that romance tips from the Internet are the right solution.\n\nWhisper first advises Ray to compliment Drizzelda, but Ray goes way overboard and Drizzelda just gets upset, and the shock from this causes part of Ray’s head to pop off. Next, Ray gives her a sunflower—but Drizzelda’s rain powers cause the flower to wilt immediately, causing even more parts of Ray’s head to pop off.\n\nWhisper’s last romantic advice is for Ray to share an umbrella in the rain with Drizzelda, but when Ray does this, Drizzelda accidentally shoots a concentrated blast of rainwater at him. As a result of his consecutive failures, all of Ray’s “sunrays” pop off his head, leaving him totally bald. Drizzelda feels bad so she decides to pick up Ray’s sunrays, but the very last one is on a branch over a steep drop into a river.\n\nWhen she grabs the ray overhanging the chasm, the ground crumbles and she falls, only just barely grabbing onto the branch to save herself from falling in the rushing river. Ray rushes to help her up, grabbing Drizzelda’s hand to pull her back up. With a mighty cry, Ray pulls her back up, sprouting new rays that glow brightly.\n\nNot long after, the sun comes out and a beautiful rainbow forms. Drizzelda finally smiles, and the pair’s Yo-kai Medals drop out of the rainbow into Nate’s hands. It seems the day is saved, but then Ray asks Drizzelda for her hand in marriage—but she refuses him, and it starts to rain again.\n\nPart 3: Yo-kai Jumbelina\n\nNate’s just waking up and is heading down into the kitchen for breakfast, but when he gets there he finds that something bizarre has happened to his mom’s face. His mom tells him it’s just some new makeup, and his dad comments that women can totally change how they look just with a little makeup. Whisper echoes this sentiment as they head back up to Nate’s room—but when Nate turns around, something weird has happened to Whisper’s face!\n\nNate and Whisper make a ruckus which wakes up Jibanyan—and it becomes obvious that Jibanyan and Whisper have had their faces swapped. Nate knows that this is absolutely a Yo-kai playing a trick, so he uses the Watch to reveal Jumbelina! She’s a Yo-kai who loves swapping people’s faces. Whisper and Jibanyan plead to have their faces fixed, and Jumbelina happily complies.\n\nHowever, just moments later, Jumbelina has swapped Nate’s face with his mom’s! But now there’s a big problem: when Nate asks Jumbelina to switch it back, she can’t. It turns out that somehow Nate’s face has now been swapped with Bear. Jumbelina explains that Nate’s own face is actually rebelling against him, and has “run off.”\n\nNate wonders why his own face would get upset at him and run away. Whisper points out that earlier in the morning, Nate deliberately chose not to wash his face, saying that it was “annoying.” Nate now remembers that he didn’t wash his face in the morning for 3 days in a row, which is surely why his face ran away.\n\nJumbelina’s got the solution to this problem, as she whips out a seemingly-ordinary net used to catch runaway faces. But now there’s a new problem: Nate’s dad is getting home, and it’s not going to be pretty if Nate’s mom greets him with Bear’s face. Jumbelina quickly swaps Nate’s mom’s face back to her body, and now Nate has Bear’s face.\n\nNate heads to Bear’s house, where they find that Bear now has Nate’s face. Nate throws the net down over Bear’s head, but Nate’s face escapes, hopping away from him. They chase Nate’s disembodied face down the street rapidly, while the face currently attached to Nate’s body rapidly changes. Eventually they lose sight of Nate’s face around a corner. Right around the time that Nate switches face with Dandoodle. Jumbelina says they have to “call out” to Nate’s face, using his favorite food. So they set up a plate of fried chicken, and before long Dandoodle shows up… and as expected, he’s got Nate’s face. Some pretty girls walk by, and Dandoodle tries to flirt with them. He’s got Nate’s face though, so this fails spectacularly. However, the girls notice Nate’s now-handsome face and are immediately smitten with him. Dandoodle notices that Nate has his face, and demands that Nate give it back. Nate’s face finally decides to go back to its owner, but Nate stops Jumbelina before she can make the swap—Nate is actually enjoying all the attention he’s getting from girls now, so he decides to keep his handsome new visage.\n\nBack at home, Nate’s enjoying gazing at his good-looking new face, and as the episode ends we find out that Nate’s old face is now stuck to poor Whisper’s back.\n\nCharacters\n\nHumans\n\nNate\n\nBear\n\nKatie\n\nYokai"
