        "text": "Yo-kai Watch Episode 13 Information Season 1 Number 13 English titles Komasan in the City: Low Budget Vittles, Yo-kai Chatalie, Yo-kai Dancers, Manjimutt: The Great Dog Escape: Episode 2 Japanese titles Komasan ~Hajimete no Fasuto Fūdo-hen~ (コマさん ～はじめてのファストフード編～), Yōkai Kuchidake-onna (妖怪口だけおんな), Yōkai Dansāzu (妖怪ダンサーズ), Jinmenken Shīzun 2 Inu Dassō Episode2 (じんめん犬シーズン2 犬脱走 Episode2) Original air date April 11, 2014 English air date December 28, 2015 Channel Disney XD Previous Yo-kai Watch Episode 12 Next Yo-kai Watch Episode 14 Discussion Episode 13 Forum Post\n\nYo-kai Watch Episode 13 is an episode of Yo-kai Watch Anime. It consists of Komasan in the City: Low Budget Vittles, Yo-kai Chatalie, Yo-kai Dancers stories, and Manjimutt: The Great Dog Escape: Episode 2.\n\nKomasan in the City: Low Budget Vittles\n\nKomasan decides to introduce his little brother, Komajiro, to the world of fast food. The elder Koma takes the younger to mogmog Burgers, but admits that he hasn’t had a successful visit to the restaurant yet. Komasan gives Komajiro a dramatic warning about what to expect at the counter: unnaturally enthusiastic customer service and arcane upselling practices. Komasan says that they have to be careful about withstanding all these helpful questions and suggestions or “your brain ends up emptier than a wicker rain barrel” and they could humiliate themselves. Together, the brothers resolve to buy only a single drink.\n\nWhen they enter the restaurant, the brothers wear yo-kai leaves on their heads to present as human to human observers. They’re called up the counter by a joyful young woman with a perpetual smile, but Komasan warns again that she and her co-workers are “more crooked than a barrel of fish hooks.” Komasan and Komajiro order at one register each. As soon as Komajiro breaks off, Komasan is hit with a limited-time Big Burger deal and freezes up. The cashier’s smile broke him down without resistance, and he accepts the offer. He weakly declines dessert, but the smell of an apple pie seduces him even further. The cashier asks if he wants ice cream topping for his pie which includes a free-with-purchase keychain shaped like a little ice cream cone. In the end, Komasan walks out with 12 burgers, three boxes of nuggets, two apple pies each with the ice cream topping, three orders of fries, one salad, one drink, and one ice cream keychain. Plus some other things. Komajiro meets his older brother at a table with his agreed-upon one drink, and asks what went wrong. Komasan claims “she done played me like a banjo.” Everything Komasan said would happen happened to him, and he’s crestfallen, but Komajiro, as always, finds a silver-lining and celebrates Komasan’s “brave and adventurous” nature with sparkly eyes.\n\nYo-Kai: Chatalie\n\nNate’s class had a big test. Nate’s confident he aced it, but Whisper wonders if his confidence isn’t misplaced because the last time Nate was so sure, he got a D. While they’re having their little argument, Bear walks up and proclaims in front of Nate and the whole class that he’s going to get a perfect grade on the test and earn the number one rank in the whole school. Though Bear did once get a perfect grade on a test, the class thinks he has even less of a chance than Nate. But he shoots back, “I am the smartest kid in the whole world!” Nate and Katie talk for a second about how unreasonable Bear’s claims are when he interrupts them again to declare that he is going to break the 100-meter dash world record. Some students demand that Bear stop bragging and “put his money where his mouth is.” So Bear puts on his gym clothes and the kids meet on the track outside.\n\nBear gets into position to take off but suddenly “sprained [his] kneebone” and says he can’t break the world record with the injury. To make up for missing this record, he promises to drink a quart of milk in two seconds at lunch. Nate catches on that a yo-kai is the cause of Bear’s crazy bravado. Whisper scolds Nate for trying to link every problem to a yo-kai, but then Nate uses his watch to reveal a giant-mouthed spirit attached to Bear. Whisper is so spooked so suddenly, he forgets to grab his tablet at first. When he does, he informs Nate this yo-kai is Chatalie, a spirit who makes people brag shamelessly without any regard for consequences.\n\nBecause Chatalie is all talk and no action, Whisper suggests the best yo-kai to counteract her is the wordless dynamo, Blazion. The little lion man gives an inspirational speech to Chatalie through Whisper’s translation. The speech convinces Chatalie to stop bringing Bear down, and she floats away somewhere.\n\nLater, in the gym, students are campaigning for student body president. Eddie is due to deliver the last campaign speech, and, when he steps up to the podium, Chatalie drops down and inspirits him. Eddie tells his fellow students that he is going to “eliminate homework forever, and guarantee A+ grades for everyone, and… make [their] spring break three months long.” Nate and Whisper worry because they don’t want Eddie to lose the election because he was forced to tell a bunch of outrageous lies. But they had too much faith in Nate’s fellow students. Eddie wins, and Blazion congratulates Chatalie for using her effects to get Eddie to accomplish something. But she goes too far and inspirits Eddie one last time, getting him to brag that he’s going to run for President of the United States of America and must decline the student council seat. Whisper realizes that summoning Blazion to push Chatalie to new heights of bragging was actually a mistake.\n\nYo-Kai Dancers\n\nNate’s class is in the gym for a dance class, and he’s not happy about it. He can’t dance and he’s been partnered up with Eric who has amazing moves that impress everyone: all the girls in class, Whisper and even a group of leafy, dance-obsessed yo-kai watching from outside. Inside the gym, it’s Nate’s group’s turn to dance. When the teacher turns on the music, Nate moves his limbs weakly and anxiously until he is suddenly filled with Michael Jackson-inspired fervor. Nate’s entire class is surprised by his sudden outburst, but everybody loves it. Outside, Whisper has to relate what happened to his human friend since Nate lost time from being inspirited. Obviously, there’s yo-kai involved so Nate scans around and finds Wiglin, Steppa and Rhyth. They’re a dancing trio of seaweed yo-kai. They give people the power to dance comfortably. Whisper feels like they’re skipping steps in the usual process when Nate just thanks them and walks away, but Nate’s just grateful and thinks they don’t need to be stopped. But he changes his mind after they make him dance as he’s being called on during a math lesson.\n\nNate tried to reason with the seaweeds in the hallway after class, but Katie interrupts their conversation to ask some questions for the school newspaper. Nate agrees to answer the questions, but is overcome with the urge to dance again, ending his routine by jamming his fingers up his nose. Katie gets annoyed with him, shouts him into mild shock, and stomps away. Nate is furious, but he can’t chase them down because he keeps stopping to dance mid-stride. Whisper figures Nate just “found the rhythm in his soul.”\n\nManjimutt: The Great Dog Escape: Episode 2\n\nManjimutt is still trying to break out of Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. Manjimutt and a mysterious someone are creeping through the guts on the prison beneath the gears and shafts that power the island on their way to freedom. But first, Manjimutt pauses to explain how he met Sam. They met at the annual “Christmas party.” Prisoners line up and get to choose one Christmas present. The choices were between a book, a ball or a stuffed toy, and the lonely and friendless Manjimutt chose the teddy bear. Manjimutt took to speaking to his teddy bear. He knows teddy bears can’t speak, but he just accepted when Sam started to do that anyway.\n\nManjimutt even told a guard about Sam’s power of speech. Manjimutt spent every moment of every day talking to his stuffed best friend. One day, Sam even began to walk on his own. Manjimutt brought Sam along when it came time to escape, and he points out a narrow escape route to his teddy bear, The spinning gears in the bowels of the prison spin at a steady rate, and they sometimes line up just right as to leave a gap large enough to climb through for an instant. Manjimutt put the plan together but can’t move his feet when the time comes. Sam volunteers to go first. Manjimutt is inspired by his best friend’s courage and promises to buy his bear a bow tie when they get out. He shouts out to his brave bear “may the odds be in your favor!” But Sam’s timing wasn’t right, and he got trapped between the teeth of two gears, tearing him apart. Manjimutt gave his escape up. And he thinks back to all the times he spoke for Sam’s voice and the cart he made out of tin cans and scrap wood so Sam could “walk by himself.” Manjimutt begins to resign himself to solitude forever until “true companions” appear before him.\n\nCharacters\n\nHumans\n\nNate\n\nBear\n\nEddie\n\nKatie\n\nEric\n\nSam\n\nYokai"
