With another new season on Disney XD, universal availability via Netflix, and additional access via the official YO-KAI WATCH YouTube Channel and Disney XD app, fans can now access this delightful program on any device, anywhere, at any time!\"\n\nIn related news, Hayakawa also announced the launch this week of an innovative new approach to the two existing YO-KAI WATCH mobile apps –YO-KAI WATCH Wibble Wobble, with its highly entertaining mix of puzzles and RPG mechanics, and the virtual theme park YO-KAI WATCH LAND, which features games and a high degree of integration with the collectible Yo-kai Medals from Hasbro. Now, in an innovative twist, the two apps will be connected – fans can scan in their Medals, then have them appear inside both apps, where they can – varying by app -- learn more about the characters, earn points for fun in-app bonuses, expand the character wiki, and more. Both apps are available on the iOS and Android platforms in North America, Australia and New Zealand. For iOS, scan Medals here, and on Android, Medals are scannable within Yo-kai Watch Wibble Wobble.\n\nHayakawa said, \"Our vision for all our properties is to create a robust ecosystem of physical goods integrated with all forms of entertainment, from programs to games to apps, accessible across multiple platforms. YO-KAI WATCH is a multi-verse, and our fans appreciate this aspect of Nate and Jibanyan's world as much as they do the content itself.\"\n\nYO-KAI WATCH is a phenomenon in its native Japan.
