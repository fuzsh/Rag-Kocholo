        "text": "Yo-kai Watch Episode 5 Information Season 1 Number 5 English titles Manjimutt: Part 4, Yo-kai Illoo, Let's Exorcise! Japanese titles Jinmenken Part4 (じんめん犬 Part4), Yōkai Maborōshi (妖怪まぼ老師), Oharai Shiyō! (おはらいしよう!) Original air date February 5, 2014 English air date October 9, 2015 Channel Disney XD Previous Yo-kai Watch Episode 4 Next Yo-kai Watch Episode 6 Discussion Episode 5 Forum Post\n\nYo-kai Watch Episode 5 is an episode of Yo-kai Watch Anime. It consists of Manjimutt: Part 4, Yo-kai Illoos and Let's Exorcise! stories.\n\nManjimutt: Part 4\n\nManjimutt wants to be a photographer, so he dons a huge red afro wig and pretends to be a photographer at a model’s photoshoot. When the real photographer shows up, Manjimutt is arrested again.\n\nYo-Kai Illoo\n\nIt’s Valentine’s Day and Katie is telling some other girls she has her eye on a special someone, but Nate, Eddie and Bear aren’t as hopeful. Just when the boys are about to resign themselves to singleness, a girl delivers a message to Eddie that their classmate wants to meet him after school where she tells him how smart and tech-savvy and cool she thinks he is. Soon after that, another girl confesses to Bear that she admires his strength and sensitivity.\n\nInstead of being excited about his friends’ valentines like Whisper suggests, Nate falls unconscious from jealousy. In a cutaway sequence, Dr. Whisper attempts to revive “the only boy who didn’t get asked out on Valentine’s Day,” and, after failing to bring him back with the defibrillator, Whisper’s last resort is to threaten mouth-to-mouth, which wakes Nate right up.\n\nWhen he’s back on his feet, he decides that there’s no way Eddie and Bear have real dates and uses the Yo-Kai Watch to reveal that he’s right. Both girls are projections created by Illoo, a priestly yo-kai with a cloudy beard and eyebrows who casts illusions over people. When Illoo shows himself, Nate shouts that he doesn’t appreciate being left out of this trickery even though he know knows his friends’ Valentine’s Day dates are lies. Whisper objects to Nate falling under Illoo’s spell, but his protests are drowned out by Nate’s jealousy, and Illoo releases a stream of sparkling smoke over Nate’s head to absolutely no effect. Nate takes even further exception to that and summons Jibanyan to force the illusionist to play along. But Jibanyan can’t handle the task because 1. “It’s not nice to show disrespect for your elders” and 2. Illoo casts a spell on Jibanyan to make his believe a jungle gym in a giant mound of delicious “chocobars.” Even though cats can’t eat chocolate, Jibanyan is useless under the illusion. Nate thinks Manjimutt can take care of business, but he is immediately distracted by the army of young girls who lined up to compete for his attention on Valentine’s Day. This illusion brings him to tears, and he’s out too.\n\nNate handles Illoo himself by leaping into the air and performing a flaming bicycle kick with a soccer ball and uniform that appeared out of nowhere, scoring the winning goal against Illoo and reverting him to medal form. Nate uses Illoo’s power to create the illusion that Katie is giving him a Valentine’s Day present, but this is an illusion within an illusion.\n\nWhisper looks on while Nate celebrates his imagined victory, Jibanyan eats his imagined chocobars and Manjimutt kneels humbly before his adoring public, but he let’s Illoo win because “sometimes, ignorance is bliss.”\n\nLet's Exorcise!\n\nNate’s house is haunted. His mother asks him if he ate their “artisanal Swiss chocolate bars,” and he says he didn’t because he actually didn’t. His mother believes him and decides it must have been her husband, but Nate has learned to suspect spirit activity. He tells Whisper he thinks there’s a chocolate-eating yo-kai secretly inhabiting the house. The ghostly butler assures Nate that a yo-kai could never escape notice as long as he’s around, but Jibanyan was the one eating the chocolate bars right under Whisper’s nose.\n\nWhisper can’t stand Jibanyan’s rude chocolate-stealing habit and hyper-relaxed attitude, and demands Jibanyan go back where they found him, eventually strangling the cat with his own collar before Nate convinces him to calm down. Jibanyan explains he had to move in because so many cats in the city got into traffic accidents, the bridge he was living under by his intersection was completely overrun by other cat spirits. His spot, in particular, was taken over by a truck-sized cat who wasn’t very friendly.\n\nEven though Whisper objects fiercely to another yo-kai moving in, Nate invites Jibanyan to stay as long as he wants to “as long as [he doesn’t] bother anyone and follow the rules.” Jibanyan promises but can’t abide by Nate’s rules. He continues to steal chocolate, and, when Nate and Whisper confront him, he obnoxiously pretends like he doesn’t know what he did wrong while flaunting Nate’s mother’s chocobars. Nate smacks his rude feline roommate with a fan to set him straight.\n\nJibanyan breaks his promise over and over, locking himself in the bathroom so long Nate has to climb in the window and pop the yo-kai with the fan again and changing the channel to a cat-costumes girl band when Nate’s father is trying to watch TV. Jibanyan is so inconsiderate that he becomes a poltergeist even Nate’s parents are aware of. His behavior is so disruptive, Nate’s family hires a “paranormal investigator” to exorcise the house of evil, or at least rude, spirits. The exorcist waves his staff around and recites gibberish and nursery rhymes that actually work, and begin to call Jibanyan and Whisper toward what appears to be heaven. Nate distracts the robed weirdo with “scones” and several massages, but he’s chants persistently until Nate declares, “You did it! The energy in here feels so clean, so pure,” saving his friends from exorcism at the very last second.\n\nThe next day, every possible chore in Nate’s house has been finished: dishes washed, floors scrubbed, even golf clubs polished. Almost being removed completely from Earth, more than any of Nate’s fan beatings, finally convinced Jibanyan to give to rather than take from his housemates.\n\nCharacters\n\nHumans\n\nNate\n\nEddie\n\nBear\n\nKatie\n\nYo-kai"
