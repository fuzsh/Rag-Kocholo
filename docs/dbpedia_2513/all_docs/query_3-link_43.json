        "text": "Yo-Kai Watch, the incredibly popular anime and video game series geared toward Japanese youngsters, will be making its television debut in the United States on Disney XD later this year. Dentsu Entertainment USA, Inc. and Level-5 announced the news today, confirming the show will get a 26-episode run. The show's localization will be a collaborative effort between the aforementioned companies, as well as TV Tokyo Corporation.\n\nCheck out the show's charming announcement trailer below. For those who don't know, Yo-Kai Watch is centered around a young boy who has the ability to see ghost-like creature called Yo-Kai. Not only that, but he has the ability to befriend them and summon them with a special watch, from which the series derives its name.\n\nYo-Kai Watch has seen several games for 3DS released in Japan and, last week at E3, Nintendo confirmed a holiday 2015 release window for a localized entry in the popular series for those in the West.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nAlex Osborn is a freelance writer for IGN.
