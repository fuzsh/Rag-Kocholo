        "text": "If there's one thing that could best summarize Daemon's (Matt Smith) time in House of the Dragon season 2, it's visions and freaky AF dreams. And while most of them have been downright trippy and full of incest, thankfully, his final vision in the series is actually helpful. In case ya missed it, he comes to his senses and realizes that Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy) should be the one to lead the Seven Kingdoms. Yep, we really had to wait the entire series for that moment. ðŸ˜¬\n\nBut what does he actually see in the final vision at Harrenhal? Why does it matter? And who has been responsible for all these visions in the end? Here's what you need to know about them.\n\nWhat does Daemon see in his final vision?\n\nThroughout much of his time in Harrenhal (which is said to be cursed, FYI) Daemon is plagued by unsettling visions, which he finds difficult to distinguish from reality, but are all clearly just dreams of things that haven't happened/could never happen. While most of them occur while he's sleeping, in episode eight, Alys Rivers (Gayle Rankin) leads Daemon to the God's Wood, where he places his hand on a Weirwood tree.\n\nIn the vision, he sees a series of flashing scenesâ€”including the man who becomes the Three-Eyed Raven, the White Walkers leading the Army of the Dead, Caraxes dead *and* Daemon himself dead in a body of water, a red comet and Daenerys Targaryen holding her three dragon eggs, Rhaenyra sitting on the iron throne, and Helaena (Phia Saban) telling him it's all a story.\n\nWhat does Daemon's vision mean?\n\nOkay, there's a lot to unpack from that incredibly short but poignant vision. In the most immediate future, it allows Daemon to finally understand it should be Rhaenyra who sits upon the iron throne in order to unite the Seven Kingdoms against their common enemy.\n\nIf you recall from both House of the Dragon and Game of Thrones, there's a common prophecy that runs throughout both shows. It's Aegon the Conqueror's dream...aka the Song of Ice and Fire...aka the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy.\n\nThe prophecy foretells it must be a Targaryen who sits upon the Iron Throne if the Seven Kingdoms are to win over against the Long Night (when the White Walkers will take over) and this person will be known as the prince who was promised.\n\nIt's long been debated if Daenerys or secret Targaryen, Jon Snow, was actually the prince who was promised. However, this new vision seems to suggest it's actually Daenerys who fulfills the prophecy. Therefore, Daemon must support Rhaenyra so that their descendants can get to this future savior.\n\nWho is the man at the beginning of Daemon's vision?\n\nBefore he sees the White Walkers and Daenerys, a Targaryen man is seen in Daemon's vision. The man is believed to be Brynden Rivers, aka Bloodraven, the bastard son of King Aegon IV who was the grandson of Rhaenyra and Daemon through their son Viserys.\n\nBrynden was legitimized by Aegon just before his death and was loyal to the crownâ€”until he was sent to the wall and became Commander of the Night's Watch. However, at one point, he went missing beyond the wall and became the Three-Eyed Raven.\n\nHe can be identified as the Bloodraven because of the raven-shaped birthmark on his face.\n\nWhat's Helaena's connection to the vision?\n\nAt the end of Daemon's vision, Helaena comes out of the shadows, telling him \"It's all a story.\" Helaena's appearance is a bit confusing as she doesn't seem to relate to the rest of the vision.\n\nAs we know throughout both seasons, Helaena has had prophecies that have come true and generally just acted a bit *strange*. While in the book Fire & Blood by George R.R. Martin, which the series is based on, Helaena has no special abilities, the show's creators appear to have added another element to her character for the TV iteration.\n\nSo why was Helaena there? Well, some fans have theorized that she was having a twin vision and foreseeing Aemond's death in the lake. As we saw later in the episode, Helaena reveals Aemond's death to him and tells him she knows he hurt Aegon as she had seen it.\n\nWe know Helaena wasn't physically at the battle in which Aegon nearly died. Therefore, this suggests she could have some sort of stronger powers at play.\n\n'House of the Dragon' seasons 1 and 2 are available to stream on Max."
