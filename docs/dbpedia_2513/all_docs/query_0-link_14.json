        "text": "Update: For any Yo-kai Watch fans, you can join in this hangout forum to join in discussions with other YW fans:\n\nhttp://watchofyokai.com/hangout/\n\nGeneral Yo-Kai Watch Discussion\n\nYo-Kai Watch is a popular series of role playing games in Japan created by Level-5.\n\nYo-kai are supernatural spirits who roam around the town haunting and causing mischief to people, ranging from Yo-kai that can make a person suddenly want to pee to one that can force you buy unnecessary things when you're out shopping. The premise itself is different from Pokemon as the player's goal revolves around searching the town of Springdale with the use\n\nof a special device called the Yo-kai Watch to search, battle, and befriend Yo-kai to stop their bad deeds.\n\nThe gameplay of Yo-kai Watch is vastly different from Pokemon too. The only elements they share is that they involve a large amount of creatures to collect. After that, that is where the similarities between the two end. Unlike the usual RPG turn-based battle system, Yo-Kai Watch's battles takes place in real-time. Your party auto-fights opponents, and as they do, you use their special abilities to aid you in battle.\n\nSince the first game's debut, Yo-kai Watch has become a massive phenomenon in Japan with exploding with manga, anime, spinoffs, mobile games, and merchandise across every street of Japan, selling in at over 7 million copies of the franchise's games total.\n\n(Combining Yo-kai Watch Busters' sales, it goes up to over 8 billion)\n\n(Another fact: The second YW game outsold Pokemon Omega Ruby/Sapphire in sales).\n\nRight now, Level-5 and Nintendo are going to release this game overseas to America, where NoA confirmed that the first game will release in November 6th. You can try out the demo for Yo-Kai Watch on the 3DS eShop, let me know your thoughts about it. The demo itself isn't the best representation for the full game, read this reddit post for more information.\n\nAccording to the English Writer for the Yo-kai Watch anime, promotion for the game will hit like a tidal wave:\n\nWhy is Yo-Kai Watch so popular? What has this franchise accomplished?:\n\nI'll be listing EVERYTHING that made Yokai Watch extremely popular in Japan:\n\nJapanese promotional poster for the anime. Currently claimed as one of the top 10 children anime of Japan.\n\nThe Yokai Watch movie promotional poster. The movie made $55 million (￥6.5 billion in yen) since its hit debut, also making the biggest grossing opening of any Japanese movie since 2000.\n\nMerchandise of this franchise in Japan has been selling like hotcakes, as The toys Namco Bandai has been making for Yokai Watch have been selling over 10 billion yen ($93 billion in U.S.) to show its staggering success. Many Japanese stores has Yo-kai Watch merchandise ready to buy! The medals are also compatible with the arcade machines YW has, which is also extremely popular with kids.\n\nIt doesn't end there... there's still more Yo-kai Watch to come, this spawned more than just the ones I listed!\n\nAn upcoming attraction for Universal Studios Japan, YW has gotten so popular to warrant its own attraction.\n\nIt's already has its name ingrained in restaurants, stores, trains, and even a Japanese singing group.\n\nmogmog burgers, YW's parody of Mcdonalds, this Mcdonalds recently just transformed into its parody counterpart.\n\nNyaKB, YW's parody of the popular AKB48 band, whom AKB48 actually partnered with Level-5 with to do concerts for them.\n\nOne of the many trains you can find in Japan now.\n\nCars for the iconic Komasan and Komajiro characters of YW. Expanding from merchandise to cars is crazy!?!?!?!?!\n\nYo-kai Watch advertisement in a Japanese theme park.\n\nThe first official YW store called \"Yorozumart\" coming in Tokyo this October. Shows how much the franchise has gained.\n\nI also have to mention the music especially!\n\nThis very music video spawned a large collection of catchy songs that reigned over Japan as one of the top songs in Japan, with over 100,000,000+ views total. Various parodies were made for the song as well.\n\nRanging from the very catchy Gera Gera Po (Yo-kai Watch's anime opening song):\n\nto the Dan Dan Zombie Zubah:\n\nto the \"Idol wa Ooh-Nya-Nya no Ken\"\n\nto the catchy Uchu Dance:\n\nThese music reigned so high, that a Just Dance version was created to show its high popularity:\n\nThe songs expanded into concerts and live shows in most of the Asian countries like Taiwan and Singapore:\n\nWatched by thousands of people when a concert comes.\n\nPeople worldwide and in Japan as a whole already know the songs and dances:\n\nThis as a whole represents Youkai Watch's popularity as a franchise.\n\nAll American trailers for the Yo-Kai Watch game:\n\nList of resources you can use to find about Yo-Kai Watch:\n\nYokai Watch General Website:\n\nhttp://www.yo-kai-world.com\n\nYokai Watch 3DS Website:\n\n(The official website for the 3DS game)\n\nhttp://yo-kai.nintendo.com\n\nYokai Watch forum:\n\n(A place where you can discuss YW with fans)\n\nhttp://watchofyokai.com/forums/\n\nmongeesubs:\n\n(A site where Japanese YW episodes are subbed)\n\nhttps://mongeesubs.wordpress.com\n\nJibanyan Smash Bros. support thread:\n\nhttp://smashboards.com/threads/jibanyan-the-charm-yo-kai-for-dlc.421550/\n\nIf you need help or tips with Yo-kai Watch, check out these boards for details and ask!:\n\nGamefaqs\n\nReddit\n\nCheck out this reddit post if you're lost with the map of YW:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/yokaiwatch/comments/3s753c/yokai_watch_maps/\n\nExtremely useful to guide you through Springdale!\n\nTo learn more about attitudes, use these links for reference, extremely useful information if you want to maximize stats for your Yo-kai:\n\nAttitude Guide:\n\n(note that Calm is actually DEF+, not DEF, he hasn't fixed that yet)\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/yokaiwatch/comments/3s23mi/attitude_guide/cwtfip6\n\nAttitude Testing through Leveling Up:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/yokaiwatch/comments/3spphn/attitude_testing_and_results/\n\nAttitude Test relating to Evolution:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/yokaiwatch/comments/3sxbex/psa_attitude_and_ivs_in_relation_to/\n\nIf you guys want to see how the \"EV\",\"IV\", and stats work, check here:\n\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/687859-yo-kai-watch/72902616\n\nStat Calculator:\n\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/293859/Yokai/yw1/calc_en.html\n\nFor a list of resources on befriending Yo-kai, use these:\n\nhttp://yokaiwatch.gamepedia.com/Food\n\nFor a list of QR Codes you can use to get Crankakai coins:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/yokaiwatch/comments/3ryzna/updating_list_of_qr_codes/\n\nFor a list of Yo-kai and their favorite foods check here:\n\nhttp://yokaipedia.net/list-of-yokai/\n\nFor information about the merchandise and medals, click here:\n\nhttp://www.hasbro.com/common/assets...8F78AE85/433EB5A050569047F55F24002FC41BC6.pdf\n\nhttp://www.hasbro.com/common/assets...2c4289f1/433D837750569047F5D1722C29C8B99F.pdf\n\nAfter I get the Lucas amiibo, my collecting will go towards the medals!\n\nCan't wait to join the fun!\n\nConnecting with Yo-Kai Watch on social networks:\n\nYouTube\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nInstagram\n\nTumblr\n\nThe localization team for Yo-Kai Watch anime is on Twitter, so you can interact and ask questions regarding Yo-Kai Watch!\n\nAsk David Steinberg (English writer, you can listen to an interview here), Brent Pentegress (one the Yo-Kai Watch VAs), and Mark Risley (executive producer of the YW anime) questions if you have any.
