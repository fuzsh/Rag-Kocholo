        "text": "One night, Nate is disturbed by the mosquito Yo-kai Scritchy, and Robonyan then appears to reveal Scritchy's role in the future of mosquito-kind, a la The Terminator. While at a public pool, Nate discovers an entire army of Fidgephant disrupting the day off. After he trains on trucks, a more heartfelt side of Jibanyan is revealed as he helps a lost cat find its owner.\n\nNate receives the new Yo-kai Watch Model U prototype, but the Yo-kai Cornfused makes him unimpressed with the new features. Meanwhile, Hailey Anne and Usapyon start on a weekly-magazine rocket project to help the latter's old master rediscover his dreams.\n\nAfter hearing how making pottery is a popular hobby, Komasan decides to try it out for himself. With Nate, Whisper, and the former's parents out shopping, Jibanyan finally has the entire house to himself, but in the style of The Twilight Zone, he is always freaking out over the slightest sound.\n\nCadin woke up from his year-long slumber to go see a Next HarMEOWny concert, only to find out it doesn't start for another week. Nate has to settle a dispute between the two bug-like Yo-kai Rhinoggin and Beetler over what kind of bug is more popular among children. At home, the Yo-kai Swelterrier makes the house too hot for the AC to keep up.\n\nWhile grocery shopping with his mother, Nate asks Robonyan to make sure he isn't seen by his friends while still helping her out. A first look is taken at Komasan Taxi, where Komasan and Komajiro discuss characters' controversial actions, aided by fan letters, with that character; they start off with Manjimutt.\n\nKomasan hears about a masseur with the \"hands of a god\" and decides to go see him. But the masseur is surprised that he can't find Komasan's tense spot. Meanwhile, Nate and his friends try to have fun at the beach, but the day is plagued by the Yo-kai Roughraff, Swosh, and others."
