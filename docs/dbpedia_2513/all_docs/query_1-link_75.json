        "text": "I bought the second game after I skipped the first game since I had Yo-kai Watch Wibble Wobble (removed in the Western markets after the end of May 2018 due to license expiration). I used YouTube to learn what to go next as I did with Pokémon Y. Sun and Moon started as a sneak peek — which later became a premiere on Disney XD — but I refused to purchase Sun and Moon for the 3DS because of an art style change and the main protagonist (Satoshi/Ash) attending school with his classmates — none of which traveled with Ash, like in both real life and in fiction. And, so far, Suiren/Lana is the only female companion ever to wear pants, as opposed to the other female companions wearing either shorts or skirts who previously traveled with Ash (Iris wears calf-high leggings as pants under a pink skirt).\n\nThe second main game in the series was released in Japan on July 10, 2014, in two versions, Bony Spirits, and Fleshy Souls. Yo-kai Watch 2 expands the areas to be explored, with nearly 100 new Yo-kai in the present day of the Kemamoto region (called Harrisville outside of Japan) and the past, where the player time travels to meet traditional Yo-kai and sees their grandfather, who made the predecessor to the Yo-kai Watch. A third version, Psychic Specters, was released on December 12, 2014, to coincide with the first Yo-kai Watch film Yo-kai Watch: Tanjō no Himitsu da Nyan!. Psychic Specters featured characters and scenarios not initially included in Bony Spirits and Fleshy Souls.\n\nBony Spirits and Fleshy Souls were localized in English and released in the United States on September 30, 2016 (April 7, 2017 in Europe). The localized Bony Spirits and Fleshy Souls received the Oni Evolution update on September 14, 2017, making those games compatible with save data from the Western release of Psychic Specters on September 29, 2017.\n\nDentsu Entertainment USA announced in April 2014 that they were seeking broadcast and merchandising partners in North America for the anime. The anime began to broadcast as a 26-episode season on Disney XD on October 5, 2015, with the official Yo-kai Watch YouTube channel posting episodes a month later. Since the show had performed well, a second season (no relation to the Japanese second season) with an additional 50 episodes was broadcast on August 1, 2016. The third season premiered on July 2, 2018 on Disney XD US, and ended on December 29, 2018. The first season’s first volume was released on DVD by NCircle Entertainment on February 26, 2019, and one version of that set comes with a free comic book. The first season’s second volume was released on September 3, 2019.\n\nI did cosplay Nate on Halloween 2018 and then again in May 2019 while I got an iMac from PC Richard (NY metro area only!) because my Windows laptop is not 2020 compliant (which Microsoft has ended support for Windows 7).\n\nThe first movie was also brought over, as a special one-day screening, on October 15, 2016. This was only in the US, via Fathom Events. Those who attended got a Hovernyan medal. Outside of the US, the first season and the movie are currently streaming on Netflix.\n\nUpdate 2021/05/17: Yo-kai Watch: The Movie was removed from Netflix US on March 3, 2021, and the first season of the anime was removed from Netflix US on April 13, 2021.\n\nThe English version of the anime dub used a cast from Sprite Animation Studios for the first two seasons and the first two games, but they were replaced in the third season with actors from SDI Media (later Iyuno) due to budgeting issues. The third season’s cast was the following:\n\nGriffin Burns (+ role reprisal in Yo-kai Watch 3; as of September 2020, he now voices Touya/Hilbert in Pokémon Masters EX for iOS and Android devices)\n\nMichael Sorich (+ Tessai Tsukabishi in Bleach)\n\nKira Buckland (+ Rulue in Puyo Puyo Tetris; reprised her role in the sequel. Later came out as non-binary in mid-2021 as Buckland uses both she/her and they/them pronouns)\n\nKatie Leigh as Usapyon (+ role reprisal in Yo-kai Watch 3 before leaving the franchise forever)\n\nReba Buhr (as of 2021, she now takes the role of Kanako Yukie in Godzilla Singular Point)\n\nTony Azzolino\n\nBryce Papenbrook (+ Cat Noir/Adrien Agreste in Miraculous Ladybug, Rin Okumura in Blue Exorcist…)\n\nErika Harlacher-Stone as Inaho Misora/Hailey Anne Thomas (+ role reprisal in Yo-kai Watch 3; she now voices Kamino Mei in Godzilla Singular Point as of 2021)\n\nChristine Marie Cabanos as Komajiro (+ Amitie in Puyo Puyo Tetris and its sequel and Filia in Skullgirls 2nd Encore)\n\nBobby Galebi (Fate is currently unknown since he left the franchise)\n\nPeter Michail (Fate is currently unknown since he left the franchise)\n\nBrian Beacock (previously voiced Hideyoshi Toyotomi (uncredited) in Samurai Warriors 3)\n\nChristopher Corey Smith (previously voiced Nobunaga Oda (uncredited) in Samurai Warriors 3)\n\nCristina Vee (+ Cerebella in Skullgirls 2nd Encore and Morgiana in Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic)\n\nThe new cast was met with both anger and indifference from fans following said budgeting issues and the decline in viewership of the anime series, which came to an end between New Year’s Eve 2018 and New Year’s Day 2019.\n\nYo-kai Watch: Shadowside replaces Nate and Katie (both of which are married as adults and are Yo-kai Watch veterans, as they retain their trademark hairstyles) with Keisuke and Natsume Amano (younger brother and older sister, respectively) for protagonists.\n\nUpdate 2022/02/21: Keisuke and Natsume now have English names as “Tate Adams” and “Summer Adams” respectively, but only in the manga.\n\nTaking place after the events of the fourth film, the series centers on Keisuke Amano, Natsume’s brother who doesn’t believe in supernatural phenomena. But as he notices his sister frequently coming home late, he decides to stalk her, only to find out she is exorcising evil Yo-kai and running a Yo-kai detective agency. With their secret revealed to him, Natsume decided to let him tag along in her activities as they investigated Yo-kai crimes and took on evil Yo-kai to maintain peace all over the city.\n\nMeanwhile, Shutendoji (the one who had planned all the evil, as seen in an epilogue at the end of the fourth movie), accompanied by his Yo-kai bodyguard Doketsu, is in search of the “princess” that he has hoped to unite with, over the events of the anime. They both search for the “princess” while in their human disguises, and observing the actions of the Yo-kai detective agency.\n\nEven the president of Level-5 (and the franchise’s creator), Akihiro Hino (pictured below), was surprised by Yo-kai Watch’s popularity. “While I did believe that it would get its break, honestly, to have it come this far, where the children of Japan would get so hopped-up on Yo-kai, to the point where all the goods would sell out, is something I didn’t expect.” They were the second most popular characters in Japan, in a survey by Video Research Ltd. Explanations for its popularity ranged from catchy songs and dances to being something parents and kids could enjoy together, to “weird adults” not being interested in it. Hino himself said that it was the characters and situations relatable to modern kids that made it popular.\n\nThe third game bought back the original cast (minus Bosch) from the first two seasons and the first two games, while Griffin Burns would reprise his role as Nate one final time.\n\nNathan Adams (Keita Amano in the Japanese release) has moved from the upstate American city of Springdale to the southern town of ‘BBQ’ after his father was transferred (in the original Japanese release, the move is overseas from Japan to America). The Yo-kai around BBQ has corresponding “American” looks and abilities. Unlike the first two games, the player is not given the choice to select between Adams and an equivalent female protagonist, Katie Forester.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Springdale, the setting for the first two games, Hailey Anne Thomas (Inaho Misora in the Japanese release) is now a playable character who has formed a yōkai detective team. The third game only sold around 4,000 copies in the West, due to its rarity and many stores in North America (and Amazon.com) received two or three copies.\n\nWhen I first reviewed the game I later found out that the original cast (Johnny Yong Bosch initially landed the role of Keita/Nate for the first two seasons and the first two games before being replaced due to said budgeting issues) from the first two games and the first two seasons reprised their roles one final time instead of the whole season 3 cast.\n\nAnd the reason why the Yo-kai Watch franchise failed in North America? Here’s why:\n\nUnlike its native Japan where it experienced a short period of great popularity, the Yo-kai Watch franchise underperformed in North America. Although it got off to a promising start in that region in late 2015, with the first game selling at least 400,000 units, the sequel sold less than 200,000 units in comparison as it lost out to the then-newly-released Pokémon Sun and Moon, and Hasbro’s Yo-kai Watch toy line was discontinued in the United States in 2017 and in Europe and Latin America in 2018.\n\nThe anime series faced a decline in viewership of the show, with the increase of recurring scrappy characters, toilet humor, the derailment of several popular Yo-kai from the games, the Flanderization of several characters, and, in the case of the English dub, replacing the entire voice cast due to said budgeting issues.\n\nNintendo opted to largely not promote the spinoff Yo-kai Watch Blasters (Yo-kai Watch Busters in Japan but was changed in the localized version to avoid copyright issues with Colombia Pictures, the owner of the Ghostbusters IP and trademarks) and Yo-kai Watch 3 outside of web advertising. The said third game sold 4,000 units due to its limited print run and being late to the 3DS’ lifespan, as it was released in Europe first (which only sold 30,000 units)."
