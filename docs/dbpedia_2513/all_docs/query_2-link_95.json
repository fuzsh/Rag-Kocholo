        "text": "Nintendo released a new six-minute trailer for the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. The “Traversing Hyrule” trailer shows the ways the Princess Zelda will be able to get around the kingdom and the varied people and regions within it.\n\nZelda will be able to fast-travel between waypoints scattered across the land, and can also ride on horseback to get around quicker. In addition, Zelda can create smoothies and equip outfits and accessories to enhance her abilities. Another new ability in the game is called Bind, which causes items — including giant boulders, inaccessible treasure, or enemies — to follow Zelda’s movement, while Reverse Bind acts in the opposite way, letting Zelda copy the movement of things like moving platforms to her advantage.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom puts Princess Zelda in the protagonist role as the people of Hyrule are stolen away by strange rifts, including Link. The game sees Zelda gaining a tool called the Tri Rod, which is bestowed on her when she partners with the fairy Tri. The Tri Rod allows Zelda to create echoes of things found in the environments she explores, which can be used to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is set to release for Nintendo Switch on September 26, 2024."
