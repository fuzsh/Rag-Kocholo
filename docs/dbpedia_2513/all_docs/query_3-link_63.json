        "text": "Attack on Titan (finally) wrapped up last year after a protracted final season and there's never been a better time to watch the popular anime from start to finish.\n\nUnlike our guides to watching Demon Slayer in order and Neon Genesis Evangelion in order, watching Attack on Titan in order is little more simple than its peers. Despite that, there are Final Chapters and multiple segmented seasons to consider. Throw in 'OADs' (essentially side stories that fill out the backgrounds and histories of certain characters) that are just as good as the main series, and there's a lot to take in.\n\nTo help, we've put together a complete guide on how to watch Attack on Titan in order. That includes a basic release date order for those who want to keep it simple, the full picture for completionists, and a more confusing chronological order for those who have already rumbled their way through the series .\n\nYou ready? Grab your ODM gear and zip on down below for the complete Attack on Titan watch order. For more from the best anime around, we've got larger looks at the Demon Slayer Infinity Castle trilogy and Jujutsu Kaisen season 3. Then see what else is on the horizon with our complete guide to new anime in 2024.\n\nHow to watch Attack on Titan in order\n\nOK, first up: let’s keep things incredibly straightforward. There are four seasons of Attack on Titan. The first two seasons aired as full seasons; seasons 3 and 4 aired in multiple parts – with the fourth season dubbed ‘The Final Season.’ Two 'Final Chapters' aired in March 2023 and November 2023 respectively.\n\nHere’s the extremely basic watch order for Attack on Titan, complete with which episodes go where and how many parts each season is split into. We’re getting on to the more complicated stuff in a minute, don’t worry.\n\nAttack on Titan season 1 (episodes 1-25)\n\nAttack on Titan season 2 (episodes 26-37)\n\nAttack on Titan season 3, part 1 (episodes 38-49)\n\nAttack on Titan season 3, part 2: (episodes 50-59)\n\nAttack on Titan season 4 (Final Season), part 1: (episodes 60-75)\n\nAttack on Titan season 4 (Final Season), part 2: (episodes 76-87)\n\nAttack on Titan Final Chapter Special 1: (episode 88)\n\nAttack on Titan Final Chapter Special 2 (episode 89)\n\nHow to watch Attack on Titan in order – including OADs\n\nEasy peasy, right? Now it’s time to introduce the OADs – side adventures involving much of the key cast. Are they skippable? Sure. But we’d really recommend watching them in the order below. Not only do you get more depth in the Survey Corps’ dynamics, these all – barring one – involve events referenced in the main series.\n\nThe first, Ilse’s Notebook, revolves around Hange and Levi encountering a Titan; the second is a fun cook-off-themed story involving Jean and Sasha; the third sees Jean and Eren team up to stop a hostage situation. That trio of OADs take place between episodes 3 and 4 of the main series – we’ll get to the chronological order later – but should be watched after the first season if it’s your first time through.\n\nNo Regrets is a Levi prequel set before the events of Attack on Titan. Again, watch that after the first season. The only other OADs are the Annie-centric Wall Sina two-parter and a surreal Mikasa chapter, Lost in the Cruel World, which is the most skippable of these extra episodes because it deals with events that aren’t strictly canon. They are all available to watch on Crunchyroll.\n\nAttack on Titan season 1 (episodes 1-25)\n\nAttack on Titan Ilse’s Notebook (OAD)\n\nAttack on Titan: The Sudden Visitor (OAD)\n\nAttack on Titan: Distress (OAD)\n\nAttack on Titan: No Regrets Parts 1-2 (OAD)\n\nAttack on Titan season 2 (episode 26-37)\n\nAttack on Titan: Lost Girls: Wall Sina, Goodbye Parts 1-2 (OAD)\n\nAttack on Titan season 3, part 1 (episode 38-49)\n\nAttack on Titan: Lost Girls: Lost in the Cruel World (OAD)\n\nAttack on Titan season 3, part 2: (episode 50-59)\n\nAttack on Titan season 4 (Final Season), part 1: (episode 60-75)\n\nAttack on Titan season 4 (Final Season), part 2: (episode 76-87)\n\nAttack on Titan Final Chapter Special 1: (episode 88)\n\nAttack on Titan Final Chapter Special 2 (episode 89)\n\nHow to watch Attack on Titan in chronological order – including OADs\n\nWe'll say it up front with the Attack on Titan chronological order: We don’t recommend this to newcomers for heavy spoiler reasons. Even then, it’s a muddled list that isn’t always as cohesive as you might expect. The release order above is the best way to watch the series. Having said that, be our guest – it’s still a fun (and unique) way to watch one of the world’s most popular anime.\n\nBefore we dive into the list, a few pointers: Levi’s No Regrets OAD is set before the events of Attack on Titan. Distress, Sudden Visitor, and Ilse’s Notebook take place (in that order) between episodes 3 and 4. Likewise, Wall Sina is definitively set between episodes 16 and 17. The final OVA, Lost in the Cruel World, takes place partly during the events of episode 49.\n\nThe rest is all in basic chronological order, barring some flashbacks and episodes that specifically dive into the past for an extended period of time. We’re keeping things fairly contained, however, without jumping about from scene to scene and season to season in awkward fashion too much. It's why you can watch episode 57 before anything else, for example, but it isn't necessary. Simply put, it’s not an ideal way to watch – though be sure to keep track of the exact chronological order with our additional notes below.\n\nAttack on Titan: No Regrets Parts 1-2 (OAD)\n\nAttack on Titan season 1: episodes 1-3\n\nAttack on Titan: Distress (OAD)\n\nAttack on Titan: The Sudden Visitor (OAD)\n\nAttack on Titan Ilse’s Notebook (OAD)\n\nAttack on Titan season 1, episodes 4-16\n\nAttack on Titan: Lost Girls: Wall Sina, Goodbye Parts 1-2 (OAD)\n\nAttack on Titan season 1, episodes 17-25\n\nAttack on Titan season 2 episodes 26-37\n\nAttack on Titan season 3, part 1: episodes 38-49\n\nAttack on Titan: Lost Girls: Lost in the Cruel World (OAD – also alternate reality flashback)\n\nAttack on Titan season 3, part 2: episodes 50-59 [episodes 56-57 partially set decades before episode 1]\n\nAttack on Titan season 4 (Final Season), part 1: episodes 60-75\n\nAttack on Titan season 4 (Final Season), part 2: episodes 76-87\n\nAttack on Titan Final Chapter Special 1: (episode 88)\n\nAttack on Titan Final Chapter Special 2 (episode 89)"
