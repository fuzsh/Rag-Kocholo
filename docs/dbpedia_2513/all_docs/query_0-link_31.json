The first episode of Kai aired on 05 April 2009 (Toriyama’s birthday) as part of Fuji TV’s new hour-long Sunday morning anime block, “Dream 9”. The block began with Kai at 9:00AM (hence the “9” in the block’s name), and was followed by Toei Animation’s other mega-hit anime series, One Piece, at 9:30AM.\n\nThe series featured re-recorded dialogue, new music, updated sound effects, and new digital effects, but the majority of the footage was recycled from Dragon Ball Z. Toei Animation’s announcement stressed that the series would have a higher “sense of excitement”, indicating that the majority, if not all, of the “filler” material would be cut. This indeed turned out to be the case, as a pre-title card shown before the first 13 episodes stated that Kai was the “Akira Toriyama Original Cut Version”. This meant the series would follow the manga much more closely than Dragon Ball Z had originally, and would consequently shorten the series from its original episode count.\n\nSoon after the initial airing, it was announced that Dragon Ball Kai would have both standard-definition DVD and high-definition Blu-ray releases. This was the first time that any Dragon Ball property would be released in a high-definition format, truly bringing Dragon Ball into the digital age. Although the series was being broadcast in widescreen, due to Japan’s new broadcasting standards in an effort to transition from analogue to digital broadcasting, it had been digitally remastered in its original fullscreen aspect ratio. All of the high-definition Blu-ray releases featured to this original fullscreen format, as opposed to the DVD releases which featured the widescreen format used for the series broadcast.\n\nAlthough the series was consistently seeing high rating shares, it was ultimately canceled in March 2011 following the conclusion of the Cell arc presumably due to financial reasons. Shortly before the series ended, Toei Animation acknowledged issues of musical infringement in the series’ background music and promptly removed Kenji Yamamoto’s score, replacing it with Shunsuke Kikuchi’s original score from Dragon Ball Z. The last two aired episodes (96 & 97) of the series were broadcast exclusively with Shunsuke’s score, as well as all subsequent re-airings of the series. Due to the horrific earthquake that struck Japan on 11 March 2011, the series broadcast was delayed one week and consequently the final episode of the series was not aired as originally scheduled.\n\nIn November 2012, it was let slip that the Majin Boo arc of the series was in production, although with one slight difference — it was being produced for international distribution only. However, with the waning performance of Toriko becoming quite pronounced, speculation began that Kai would be revived to replace its replacement. In February 2014, V-Jump announced that indeed “a new era of Kai” would be returning to Fuji TV in Japan and reclaiming its original time slot from Toriko. The series picked back up on Fuji TV where it had left off three years prior, with the Majin Boo arc, on 06 April 2014 as part of the newly formed “Strong 9” hour-long Sunday morning anime block. Shortly thereafter foreign licensees began announcing acquisition of the final arc of the series, which would be known internationally as “The Final Chapters”. However, it soon came to light that the international version would not be identical to what was being broadcast in Japan and that two separate versions had been created, unlike with the previous iteration. Additional information about the international version of the Majin Boo arc can be read below.\n\nJapanese Series Story Arcs\n\nSelect a story arc to view an episode-by-episode break-down of that specific arc, with additional information pertaining to the original broadcast run, filler content, and rating shares. We’ve also included detailed pages for each individual episode, which includes screen shots from the original episodes, episode summaries, next episode information, complete opening and ending credits, and much more.\n\nInternational Story Arcs\n\nWhile known in Japan as simply Dragon Ball Kai, Toei elected to re-brand the series as Dragon Ball Z Kai for its international distribution, to help distinguish it as a new series based on the globally famous Dragon Ball Z series. Aside from any international censoring or editing, the series was distributed internationally just as it had originally aired in Japan. Following the series’ premature end in 2011 with the conclusion of the Cell arc, international distributors requested Toei continue the series on into the Majin Boo arc, as there was still a demand for it amongst international fans. Toei began production of a 69 episode final arc of the series, giving it the sub-title “The Final Chapters”, with the intention that it would only be distributed internationally. Although it would be bypassing the Japanese market, the series was fully produced with an original musical score and recorded Japanese dialogue.\n\nAt some point during or after the series’ production, Fuji TV approached Toei requesting a replacement series for the waning Toriko anime. With Toei having a newly produced series already in hand, it was decided that Dragon Ball Kai would return to retake its old time slot on Fuji TV after all. However, due to constraints allotted by Fuji TV, the already produced 69 episode Majin Boo arc would need to be cut down to fit within a year’s broadcast time. Toei obliged and went back to the cutting room floor, creating two distinctly separate versions of the Majin Boo arc with differing episode counts. The international version of the series remained as it was originally produced, with 69 episodes, and began being distributed in international markets in June 2014 shortly after the shortened Japanese series began its broadcast in Japan.\n\nWith two versions of the Majin Boo arc, the international version will be documented separately within this section. Here you will find an episode-by-episode break-down of the arc, as produced in Japanese, with additional information covering the series’ international distribution, differences from the Japanese broadcast version, and much more."
