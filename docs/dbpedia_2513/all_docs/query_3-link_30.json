There are also QR codes on the back of them that allow them to be scanned in order to give bonuses in the video games. On average, a new Series of Yo-kai Medals is released every two months. The page for each Series lists all available Medals and their rarities. The means of obtaining Promotional Medals are listed instead of rarity.\n\nBase Set\n\nYo-Motion\n\nYo-Motion Yo-kai Medals are compatible with the Yo-kai Watch Model Zero. They have a unique feature that projects a three frame animation of the Yo-kai's Soultimate.\n\nPromotional\n\nPromotional Yo-kai Medals can only be obtained through special means, such as purchasing other products or attending an event."
