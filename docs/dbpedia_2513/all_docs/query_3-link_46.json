        "text": "Aside from the series, there are also a number of movies and television specials that confuse matters further, and then there's the complication that not all the series are necessarily considered \"canon\".\n\nMuch like trying to watch Naruto in order, all of this makes it quite difficult to know how to watch the Dragon Ball series.\n\nSo where to begin? We have you covered.\n\nMore like this\n\nHow to watch Dragon Ball in chronological order\n\nWhile this method might be frowned upon by hardcore fans, one way to watch Dragon Ball in order is to go in chronological order in terms of the time scale of the story.\n\nThis order does not take into account whether each series or film is considered canon or not – hence why some fans would say it isn't the best way to watch – and as such, it includes a lot of content.\n\nMeanwhile, a note that we have included Dragon Ball Z but not Dragon Ball Z Kai, given that the two series are essentially the same thing. (For reference, Dragon Ball Z Kai is a remake of the earlier series, telling the same story but with less filler and some new dialogue as well as updated animation.)\n\nHere is how to watch the Dragon Ball series in chronological order:\n\nDragon Ball\n\nDragon Ball Z: Dead Zone (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Z: episodes 1-86\n\nDragon Ball Z: Bardock – The Father of Goku (TV Special)\n\nDragon Ball Z: episodes 87-107\n\nDragon Ball: Episode of Bardock (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Z: The World's Strongest (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Z: Lord Slug (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Z: episodes 108-123\n\nDragon Ball Z: The History of Trunks (TV Special)\n\nDragon Ball Z: episodes 124 and 125\n\nDragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Z: episodes 126-146\n\nDragon Ball Z: Super Android 13 (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Z episodes 147-173\n\nDragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Z: Broly – The Legendary Super Saiyan (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Z: episodes 174-194\n\nDragon Ball Z: Bojack Unbound (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Z: episodes 195-207\n\nDragon Ball Z: Broly’s Second Coming (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Z: episodes 208-250\n\nDragon Ball Z: Bio-Broly (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Z: episodes 251-253\n\nDragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Z: episodes 254-288\n\nDragon Ball Z: Wrath of the Dragon (movie)\n\nDragon Ball GT: episodes 1-64\n\nDragon Ball Super: episodes 1-3\n\nDragon Ball Z: Battle of the Gods (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Super: episodes 4-18\n\nDragon Ball Z: Resurrection F (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Super: episodes 19-131\n\nDragon Ball Super: Broly (movie)\n\nDragon Ball Super: Super Hero\n\nDragon Ball DAIMA\n\nDragon Ball Z: episodes 289-291\n\nFinally, you can watch Super Dragon Ball Heroes, which is a promotional anime for the video game and card series containing some fun moments for fans!\n\nHow to watch Dragon Ball in order by canon\n\nIf you want to skip all the Dragon Ball that isn't considered canon, i.e the series and films which don't follow the events of the manga and were made without any input from creator Akira Toriyama, then there is an alternative watch order below.\n\nThe entries considered non-canon include the series Dragon Ball GT in addition to the majority of the films. Then you also have to make the choice of whether to watch Dragon Ball Z for the more extensive experience or Dragon Ball Kai for the more refined approach.\n\nHere is the list for fans who wish to watch Dragon Ball canonically:\n\nDragon Ball: all episodes\n\nDragon Ball Z or Kai: until the end of the Frieza Saga\n\nDragon Ball Z: Bardock – The Father of Goku (TV Special)\n\nDragon Ball Z or Kai: until the end of the Cell saga\n\nDragon Ball Z or Kai: The History of Trunks (TV Special)\n\nDragon Ball Z or Kai: until just before the Peaceful World saga\n\nDragon Ball DAIMA\n\nDragon Ball Super\n\nDragon Ball Z or Kai: all remaining episodes\n\nWhen is Dragon Ball DAIMA set?\n\nThe most recent series was announced by the late Akira Toriyama at New York Comic Con 2023, but it hasn't been officially confirmed when Dragon Ball DAIMA is set yet.\n\nHowever, some comments from Toriyama and eagle-eyed fans have been able to figure out that it appears to be set sometime prior to The End of Dragon Ball Z, but before the events of Super.\n\nTake a look at the trailer for Dragon Ball DAIMA below!\n\nLooking for something else to watch?
