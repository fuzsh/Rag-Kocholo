In the localization he’s known as N'more, a simple contraction of “No more.”\n\nYou guys know Gachinkozo by now, as he first showed up way back in Episode 138. Meaning Manji’s explained his name already, but I’ll go over it again for One Chance sake. Basically: ガチンコ (gachinko, competing seriously/earnestly) and 小僧 (kozou, boy/youngster). When he becomes One Chance Side, his name becomes ガチンコ増 - pronounced exactly the same, but instead meaning that there’s an increase (増 zou) in his earnest competing (ガチンコ gachinko). It’s a lame pun so I localized it as a lame pun. lol\n\nOur next release in the works is EP194 of the original series, but as you may have heard, the current series (Yo-kai Academy Y) recently went on hiatus from airing new episodes in Japan, presumably due to production delays on account of the coronavirus. As a result, we’re considering adjusting our plans after 194 for any releases while the series is on hiatus.

Lumpstud here.\n\nLike with the last YW! bunch, this was another split. Noroino Hanako took on translation & timing for 35 (and typesetting for both eps!) and your’s truly, Lumpstud, did such for 36. My first time working with Shadowside and it was fun, and I’m glad to help push these episodes out while they’re still in-season. Merry Christmas and happy holidays, everyone!\n\nWakame-kun, Konbu-san, and Mekabu-chan, are all simply different names of seaweed with honorifics at the end. If you’ve seen the original series, you might recognize them - or, in the dub as Wiglin, Steppa, and Rhyth, the dancing trio.\n\nThe new guy in 36′s Lightside name, “Momy,” is pretty straightforward since it’s explained in the episode - he’s a momi fir tree.\n\nEpisode 35 Credits:\n\nTranslation/Timing/Typesetting: Noroino Hanako\n\nQC/Review: Lumpstud, Manjiknights, NeSubs\n\nRaw Source: Leopard Raws, TV Tokyo(TX)\n\nEpisode 36 Credits:\n\nTranslation/Timing: Lumpstud\n\nTypesetting: Noroino Hanako\n\nQC/Review: Manjiknights, NeSubs, Noroino Hanako\n\nRaw Source: Leopard Raws, TV Tokyo(TX)\n\nIt’s been a long time coming!\n\nSoftsubs: https://nyaa.si/view/1298085\n\nHardsubs: https://nyaa.si/view/1298086\n\nVimeo Part 1: https://vimeo.com/474883618\n\nVimeo Part 2: https://vimeo.com/474902458\n\nAnidex: https://anidex.info/torrent/364141\n\nnyaa.net: https://nyaa.net/view/1036256\n\nWe are very proud to finally present the sixth feature film in the Yo-kai series with English subs. Having been in the works since July, we’ve done our best to push the capabilities of typesetting to their limits - though as a result we have to warn you, if you are downloading the softsubs, we recommend using the latest build of mpv on a higher-end computer to (hopefully) prevent too much typeset lagging or flickering.\n\nThank you to every fansubber who’s supported to this movie’s efforts, an extra special thank you to Lyss who went out of their way to scout members for our group, and thanks to everyone who’s kept up with our releases and shared them and those who cheered us on and sent us encouraging messages. This wouldn’t have been possible without any of you!\n\nPlease continue, as always, to look forward to future Yo-kai fansub releases for time to come. And we will do our very best to continue producing the best subs we can. Thank you.\n\nCredits:\n\nRaw Source: Blu-ray Retail\n\nTranslation: Edo, Lumpstud, Manjiknights, NeSubs, Noroino Hanako\n\nCredits Translation: Lumpstud, NeSubs, Sei\n\nSong Translation: Manjiknights (OP/Insert Theme), NeSubs (ED Theme)\n\nVisual Typesetting: Lumpstud, NeSubs, Noroino Hanako\n\nOP/ED Credit Typesetting: NeSubs\n\nTitle Logo Animation/Karaoke Effect/Distro: Noroino Hanako\n\nQuality Control: Lumpstud, Manjiknights, NeSubs, Noroino Hanako, Voay\n\nSpecial Thanks: Lyss\n\nGet ready to spend the summer with Jinpei Jiba and the YSP Club!\n\nStarting this May, we will be focusing on English sub releases of the Yo-kai Academy Y anime! Most of you who voted in our poll that we conducted on Twitter seemed to be in favor of this idea, so we hope you look forward to the next few months, as they’ll be filled with releases of Yo-kai Academy Y!\n\nWe will share exact release dates, as well as information regarding the status of our other series through our Twitter and Tumblr accounts at a later date, so please stay tuned for more information.\n\nAs always, we could use some extra help in accomplishing this task, and ask that those interested in joining Specter Subs as a JP to EN translator, dialogue editor, timer, etc. use our Google Form application here: https://forms.gle/dJYbXJ6CscSbXkgZ7"
