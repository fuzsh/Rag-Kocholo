        "text": "Before Jujutsu Kaisen season 3 rolls around, you might want to watch Jujutsu Kaisen in order - including the '0' movie.\n\nWhile it's not quite as confusing as some series (Neon Genesis Evangelion's watch order still gives us a headache), it's not something you can always recount off the top of your head.\n\nIn short, there are prequel arcs and a feature to consider, which is especially important for those who want to relive the Curse-laden story in chronological order. The Jujutsu Kaisen release date order is also available below, which is the one we would definitely recommend.\n\nFor more watch orders, check out how to watch Demon Slayer in order and how to watch the Marvel movies in order. Then jump into everything you need to know about this year's new anime, including One-Punch Man season 3.\n\nThe Jujutsu Kaisen watch order is nice and simple if you’re going by release date. In our opinion, this is the best and most straightforward way to watch the show.\n\nThe first season of Jujutsu Kaisen, consisting of 24 episodes, aired from October 2021 to March 2022.\n\nA prequel movie, titled Jujutsu Kaisen 0, was released in March 2022 in the US and in other territories – grossing almost $200m at the box office.\n\nA second season wrapped in December 2023. It began with the prequel five-episode Hidden Inventory/Premature Death arc in July 2023 and returned in August with the Shibuya Incident arc. A third season is planned.\n\nSo, our recommended Jujutsu Kaisen watch order looks like this.\n\nJujutsu Kaisen season 1 (episodes 1-24)\n\nJujutsu Kaisen 0 (movie)\n\nJujutsu Kaisen season 2 (episodes 25-47)\n\nHow to watch Jujutsu Kaisen in chronological order\n\nNow, this is a little more confusing. Chronologically, the first episodes are Jujutsu Kaisen season 2’s opening five. They cover Gojo and Geto’s past relationship, as well as several climactic (and traumatic) events experienced between the pair.\n\nThe prequel story continues in Jujutsu Kaisen 0, which takes place sometime after Jujutsu Kaisen season 2’s Hidden Inventory arc, but before Jujutsu Kaisen’s first season.\n\nJujutsu Kaisen season 2, episode 6 then picks up after the events of Jujutsu Kaisen season 1. Confused? Here’s how to watch Jujutsu Kaisen in chronological order:\n\nJujutsu Kaisen season 2 (episodes 1-5) [Hidden Inventory/Premature Death arc]\n\nJujutsu Kaisen 0 (movie)\n\nJujutsu Kaisen season 1 (episodes 1-24)\n\nJujutsu Kaisen season 2 (episodes 6-23) [Shibuya Incident arc]\n\nShould I watch the Jujutsu Kaisen 0 movie?\n\nYou absolutely should. Not only does it fill in the gaps for some key Jujutsu Kaisen characters, it’s also a key text for much of what happens early on in Jujutsu Kaisen season 2.\n\nSome story reveals may lose their impact if you watch Jujutsu Kaisen 0 before Jujutsu Kaisen season 2, but that’s our preferred order. There’s a reason why they adapted it from the manga and released it after the first season, after all.\n\nCan I skip any Jujutsu Kaisen episodes?\n\nWe don’t recommend skipping any Jujutsu Kaisen episodes. Not only is it a stellar anime – for our money, one of the best in the past five years – but nearly every episode offers something new to say about the characters and the weird and wonderful world around them.\n\nUnlike long-running anime such as One Piece and Bleach (which often had to spin its wheels to wait for more source material), there should be no filler episodes in Jujutsu Kaisen for the foreseeable future.\n\nHow many Jujutsu Kaisen episodes are there?\n\nThere are currently 47 episodes of Jujutsu Kaisen and one movie. A third season – set to adapt the Culling Games arc – should add another 20 episodes or so in the next year or two."
