        "text": "The Umbrella Academy season 4 is now streaming on Netflix, bringing the beloved comic book adaptation to an end. Viktor, Five, Klaus, Allison, Diego, Luther, and Ben find themselves reluctantly teaming up for one last, seemingly straightforward mission, but not everything is as it seems – especially when a few new faces enter the fray in the form of timeline conspiracy theorists, the Keepers.\n\nSeason 4 may be the final installment of the Hargreeves superpowered (or not…) exploits – but is the final scene actually the end of the show? Or is there a post-credits treat to reward patient viewers? We've got everything you need to know about The Umbrella Academy season 4 post-credits scene (or lack thereof) right here, so you can decide whether to switch off or keep watching at the end of episode 6.\n\nDoes The Umbrella Academy season 4 have a post-credits scene?\n\nYes, The Umbrella Academy season 4 does have a very short post-credits scene. You'll need to wait until the very end of the credits to see it, though, unlike season 3's cheeky mid-credits stinger featuring Justin H. Min's Ben.\n\nWhile you wait, though, you can sit back and enjoy a touching montage of behind-the-scenes clips from the production of seasons 1-4 set to a soundtrack of Talking Heads' This Must Be the Place while the credits roll.\n\nAs for the actual post-credits scene, we dive into that before, but this is your obligatory major spoiler warning – turn back now if you're not up to date with the new season yet and don't want to know what happens!\n\nThe Umbrella Academy season 4 post-credits scene explained\n\nStill here? Let's get into. After the Hargreeves and Lila sacrifice themselves at the end of the season finale, we see that they succeeded in saving the timeline and their families are enjoying a picturesque day at the park.\n\nAfter the credits have finished rolling, however, we return to the same park and see eight marigolds blooming. So, what's the significance of that? Well, seven Hargreeves siblings plus Lila equals eight, and marigold flowers share their name with the particle that gave them their superpowers – and threatened to destroy the world as long as they stayed alive. Does this keep the door open for future Umbrella adventures? Well, season 4 is the final season, but never say never.\n\nAll episodes of The Umbrella Academy season 4 are available to watch now on Netflix. For more, check out our The Umbrella Academy season 4 review and our guide to The Umbrella Academy season 4 ending explained."
