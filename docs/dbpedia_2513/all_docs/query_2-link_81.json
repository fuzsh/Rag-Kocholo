        "text": "When Does the 2024 Call the Midwife Holiday Special air?\n\nThe 2024 Call the Midwife Holiday Special will premiere on Christmas Day, December 25, 2024, on PBS at 8pm ET. It will be available to stream for free at the same time of broadcast - 8pm on December 25 at the Call the Midwife Official Site or with the PBS App on these devices: Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Android phones, iPhones, iPads, Samsung Smart TV, Chromecast, and Android TV.\n\nWhile you await the premiere, catch up on older Holiday Specials! The last four will be available with PBS Passport leading up to a Holiday Special Marathon on your PBS station across Dec. 24 and Dec. 25. Starting Dec. 25, all five of the most recent Holiday Specials will be streaming for free on the Call the Midwife Official Site or with the PBS App until January 24, 2024.\n\nIs Call the Midwife in PBS Passport?\n\nPBS Passport members can watch Call the Midwife episodes before they broadcast on TV* on the Call the Midwife Official Site or with the PBS app. Once an episode airs on TV, it shifts to streaming for everyone - you do not need a PBS station Passport membership to stream the episode. PBS is not able to have episodes of Call the Midwife available to Passport members after the episode broadcasts on TV. For more information on why this is the case, please visit our help page on streaming Call the Midwife.\n\nThe next Seasons to be available with PBS Passport are:\n\nSeason 10 from August 2, 2024, to September 30, 2024. All episodes will be available at the same time.\n\nSeason 11 from August 4, 2024, to October 2, 2024. All episodes will be available at the same time.\n\nSeason 12 from August 6, 2024, to October 4, 2024. All episodes will be available at the same time.\n\nSeason 13 from August 8, 2024, to October 6, 2024. All episodes will be available at the same time.\n\nAdditionally, the last four Holiday Specials will be available to watch with PBS Passport starting November 25, 2024, to January 24, 2025.\n\n*With the exception of new Holiday Specials."
