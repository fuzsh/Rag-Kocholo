So he looks for them and he finds an old hotel with a huge tree in it. The hotel worker said it was over 500 years old and then when the worker went out of the room he scans the tree with his yokai watch and finds Lady Longneck, Boyclops, and Pallysol. Whisper acts in amazement when he see them. Then Nate asks them to help him to scare his friends and they accept. So then during the \"scare dare\" Bear and Eddie sees them and acts like they are cheap props. So after the \"scare dare\" Nate showed the classic yokai what is scary now and they were scared. Then when it was over Whisper trained them to be scary with lunges and baseballs. So Bear and Eddie apparently agreed to another \"scare dare\" and then Bear and Eddie got scared of them.

Then at Nate's house Lady Longneck, Boyclops, and Pallysol give Nate their medals.\n\nSeason 2\n\nIn episode 78, he, Whisper, and Jibanyan get the Yo-kai watch U prototype.

However when Tomnyan notices the rocket set of 1, 2, 3, and 5, just like Whisper, USApyon enters Vader Mode and Nate, Whisper, Jibanyan, and Tomnyan get attacked. The victims flee outside but Nate sees Inaho walking by. Nate summons Tattletell and Sandmeh and they possess Inaho. In the end of the segment, Inaho gives USApyon a 75 rocket. Since he did not get a 4 rocket replacement, USApyon enters Vader Mode again, blasting Inaho, Nate, Whisper, Jibanyan, and Tomnyan once again.\n\nIn episode 136, Tomnyan brags about American food, so Nate cooks Japanese food for Tomnyan and Jerry. Tomnyan loves the food, but Jerry adds maple syrup before eating Nate's meals.\n\nIn episode 140-142, 144-145, he and Whisper comment about a weird Yo-kai monster made by Inaho.\n\nIn episode 149, he and Inaho participate in an Space Wars X Sailor Piers lottery.

They wait for other customers to take their chance, including Jerry. When it seems as if the last person wins the box, Inaho beats Nate, but she plays herself and picks the wrong one. Nate rubs her loss in her face, but the last customer wins the Space Wars X Sailor Piers Box. Nate and Inaho get irate and assault Robonyan F. Whisper, Jibanyan, USApyon, and Tomnyan loaf around eating and playing guitar neglecting the kids' loss.\n\nIn episode 150,\n\nSeason 3\n\nIn episodes 119, 134, 149-150, 154, 159, 164, and the second movie, he, Whisper, and Jibanyan interact with Inaho and USApyon.\n\nAppearance\n\nNate is a young boy with a fair-skin, big black eyes and brown hair worn with three large spikes that resemblance cowlicks. A small amount of hair sticks down at his neck. He wears his Yo-kai Watch on his left wrist.\n\nIn episodes 1-4, 12-40, 42, 66-88, Nate wears his clothing based on Yo-kai Watch 1 and Yo-kai Watch 2.

He currently wears the Yo-kai Watch Dream.\n\nPersonality\n\nNate is a fun kid but tends to come off as comedic. He enjoys being with his friends and the Yo-kai he befriended, even when they can be troublesome. His personality is very infectious and gains him many friends - however, one noticeable trait is how extremely average he is. This spreads even to his school marks and greatly annoys him, in fact he really is not average. Like most kids, Nate does basic things- like watching television, messing up his room, staying up late at night to watch television or play games. But, however, he is very righteous and has a strong sense of justice when a real crisis pops up.\n\nRelationships\n\nHumans\n\nBear and Eddie\n\nNate's most notable friends are Bear and Eddie. He gets along very well with them and they often spend time together. Sometimes they can be mean to Nate when it comes to hunting bugs or haunted dares. They appear in the anime more than Katie.\n\nKatie\n\nNate is very close to Katie and has a crush on her. Nathan frequently tries to impress her, albeit to no avail. Although Katie, does compliment Nate in certain episodes.\n\nDuring an incident where Nate is inspiritied by Suspicioni, Nate asks Katie what she thinks of him. Katie says that she feels comfortable around Nate because of his averageness and he's special because of how average he is.\n\nAfter Gachin-kozo's inspirit leaves Katie in an upset state, Nate demands the Yo-kai undo what it did, but it refuses. Nate, in turn, summons in Kyubi, Venoct, Robonyan F, Snartle, Lie-in Heart, and Shogunyan to make the Yo-kai undo what it did. After he still refuses, Nate proceeds to summon in Lord Enma to stop the Gachin-kozo, which shows that Nate cares very deeply for Katie and will fight for her if he feels like he needs to.\n\nInaho\n\nShe knows about Yo-kai like he does, and they have interacted several times. Their most notable ones were in the second Yo-kai Watch movie, episode 119, and episode 134.\n\nWhen they first meet during the second movie, Inaho teases and upsets Nate twice in his face, though she either didn't notice or didn't care. However after the final battle, they became a bit closer. There has been times where Inaho gets upset at Nate, happening in episodes 133 and 134. Despite all their negative interactions, Nate and Inaho are good friends.\n\nLily Adams and Aaron Adams\n\nJerry\n\nNate feels uncomfortable around Jerry, however, he tries his best to teach him how to use the Yo-kai Watch and tries to protect him from Yo-kai he encounters, such as Venoct.\n\nOverall, Nate and Jerry are friends.\n\nNathaniel\n\nWhen Nate arrives in the past, Nathaniel doesn't really like that fact, but eventually goes along with it and gives his grandson the Yo-kai Watch Model Zero as a parting gift.\n\nLucy\n\nNate has nothing but respect for his grandmother and is happy to be around her. After the incident during the first movie, she gifts to him his grandfather's 'most important Medal', which is Hovernyan's Yo-kai Medal.\n\nYo-kai\n\nWhisper\n\nWhisper pledges loyalty to Nate by becoming his butler after being freed from the Crank-a-kai by him. Though he tries to be useful to Nate, he in fact annoys Nate by dismissing his suspicions about Yo-kai, claiming he hadn't heard of a Yo-kai behind a supernatural event. Although Nate can be easily annoyed by Whisper's lack of useful knowledge about Yo-kai, he still holds a strong bond with him, as seen after being cut by Shogunyan, he cried his \"death\", only to reasurre himself and share a warm moment. Their bond is stronger in the English dub than in the original Japanese.\n\nJibanyan\n\nNate befriends Jibanyan after finding him in a crosswalk. The cat Yo-kai quickly bonds with him and gives him his Yo-Kai Medal. After moving to Nathan's house, he initially annoys Nathan by causing mischief, earning a smack with a fan until he decides to turn over a new leaf. Nate usually has Jibanyan as his first choice when summoning Yo-Kai.\n\nKomasan and Komajiro\n\nNate befriends Komasan in episode 7. Although Komajiro did interact with Nate several times, it is unknown when they actually first met.\n\nHidabat\n\nNate befriends Hidabat in episode 8 and becomes Nate's 3rd Yo-kai roommate. He gives Nate useful items whenever he needs them. Despite his liking of being in Nate's closet, he actually wanted Nate to summon him for the first time in episode 102.\n\nHovernyan\n\nNate befriends him the the first Yo-kai Watch movie. Hovernyan only appears in the movies so far, but he continues to help Nate defeat their enemies.\n\nTomnyan\n\nHe first meets Nate, Whisper, and Jibanyan in episode 130 and tells them about the new Yo-kai Watch Dream.\n\nUSApyon\n\nSee Inaho.\n\nNate, Whisper, Jibanyan, and Tomnyan, like Inaho, were attacked by Vader Mode.\n\nLord Enma\n\nNate saves Enma, while he was in a human disguise, from being hurt by pipes falling onto him. After Nate returns from being Fu2, Enma gifts him with his Yo-kai Medal.\n\nIn the second Yo-kai Watch movie, Nate attempts to summon Lord Enma with his U-1 watch, but he fails. However, his watch carried some power to Inaho's U-2 watch and both watches temporarily assume the Yo-kai Watch U - Version E model to be strong enough to summon Lord Enma. Inaho received a copy of Enma's medal and she and Nate used both of their watches at the same time to summon Enma. Enma reveals to the heroes he made the challenges for them because he wanted to see if humans and Yo-kai can truly live in peace. Nate summons Enma solo style to battle Gachin-kozo in episode 138.\n\nOverall, Nate and Enma are friends.\n\nAppearances\n\nAlmost every episode\n\nRunning Gags\n\nGetting called average.\n\nGallery\n\nMain article: Nate/Gallery\n\nTrivia\n\nNate dislikes to be just average and being called average, especially by his own friends Inaho, Bear, Eddie, and Katie. However, his Yo-kai form Fuu2 makes people average.\n\nTo dicipline Whisper and Jibanyan, he beats them with a paper fan. However, several times they are beating Nate with a paper fan.\n\nNate's fears are going to the dentist, seeing his mom getting angry whether he does not obey her or he says cruel things about her, and USApyon's Vader Mode. However, his fear for his mom getting angry may come from the fact that she simply has a very bad temper.\n\nNate and Inaho sometimes coincide with each other:\n\nThe two first meet each other in M02.\n\nThe two race against each other in EP119.\n\nNate helps Inaho solve her conflict with USApyon in EP134.\n\nThe two try to win the Space Wars X Sailor Piers Box, but they both fail in EP149.\n\nEP154\n\nEP159\n\nThe two go behind the scenes in EP150 and EP164.\n\nIn Other Launguages"
