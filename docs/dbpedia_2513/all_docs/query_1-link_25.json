        "text": "I think it’s kinda cute…\n\nGet this episode on nyaa: softsub, hardsub.\n\nA little behind schedule compared to last release, but it’s fine. Not much to talk about for this episode, either. Once you get into a repetitive anime like this one you kinda run out of topics of interest at times, huh. Thankfully, though, things are going to be getting much more exciting soon - not including this one, there are only two more eps left to go before the Dream Watch saga! And only five more episodes until we get to something else I’ve been looking forward to subbing for a loooooong time…but you’ll just have to wait and see what that’s about :P\n\nToday’s Yo-kai was Aitatatimes (commonly misspelled as “Aitttimes.” Yeah that’s not the most appealing romanization). His name is based on the expression aitatata (あいたたた), which…well, Whisper explains it in the context of the episode, but it’s also just the default expression for pain, like our “owowow.” It’s also based on the Japanese spelling of “times”, taimuzu (タイムズ), since the first character is “ta” in katakana. “Times” as in common newspaper names, in this case.\n\nJust as a heads up, I might be taking an extra week off until the next episode since I have to finish up the semester and don’t wanna get too distracted from that. I haven’t decided for sure yet whether or not I’ll take it, but if the next episode’s a week late you’ll know why.\n\nCredits:\n\nMyself: Translation, timing, and typesetting\n\n@noroinohanak0: QC/final editing, encoding, and distribution\n\nThe OP and ED were taken directly from the episodes we did at NyoroZokuSubs, with permission from my partner. You can check out our website for more information about episodes 113-116 if you haven’t in the past!\n\nOne look at this screenshot and you know this episode’s never getting dubbed\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! (Softsub, hardsub)\n\nWatch this episode on vimeo or dailymotion!\n\nWait a minute, 164?! Yeah, this is basically just to coincide with the western release of Busters Blasters and yadda yadda. I’ll be going back to the regular order after this. Just ignore all the parts in this episode that mention “spring break” and this release is actually seasonally relevant! And no I do not have the game and getting it is currently not in the plan (though if I do, #TeamWhiteDog all day). Could change, could not. I don’t have time for video games now anyway. Except Smash\n\nThe only new Yo-kai to show up in this episode is Whismallowman, a walking (er, floating) Ghostbusters reference. That’s all there is to it. Gotta admit I’ve never seen any Ghostbusters movies actually.\n\nIn more unfortunate news, school did in fact double-triple-ultra whammy me, so expect things to be…erratic at best around here for a while. C’mon profs I explicitly asked you not to do that :(\n\nPresented to you without context.\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! Softsub, hardsub.\n\nAn episode with virtually no typesetting (except for one VERY annoying part…) means a slightly early release! And I’ve been able to trim down total episode work time to ~5-6 hours, not counting QC. It’s the little things. Anyway, I hope you liked all the octopus ball orgasming last time, because there’s even more food porn in here. Do not ever watch this show on an empty stomach, friends.\n\nThis week’s new Yo-kai was Kameppa. It took me a little while to figure out what the pun is here, but I think it’s the verb kamu (嚙む), a multi-definition word used in this context as “to rebuke/scold”, conjugated in the -pa form (usually written out fully as -panashi/ぱなし), an ending that indicates that the action is done repeatedly. The second part of the pun is the Japanese loan-word from English, surippa (スリッパ), obviously meaning “slipper.” Basically, angry slipper.\n\nNot much else here to say. We’re halfway through Komarly Hills, by the way. It’s going by so fast :(\n\nCredits (which I forgot to put in the last post wow way to go me):\n\nMyself: Translation, timing, and typesetting\n\n@noroinohanak0: QC/final editing, encoding, and distribution\n\nThis is a pretty accurate representation of what happens when you let a kid set up a toy themselves.\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! Softsub, hardsub,\n\nWatch this episode on vimeo or dailymotion!\n\nBit of a late release this time as I stated last week, but I still managed to fit an episode into my schedule. This episode is a very eventful one, with the beginning of two brand new segments and the introduction of the Yo-kai Bazooka (which is my personal favorite of the Dream Link items). The new Komabros segment is a super long runner - 10-11 episodes if I remember correctly. It’s also chock full of puns and somewhat obscure cultural references, so later episodes are going to be so much fun for me to translate (I’m already crying). As for the new Inaho segment, Rounder and Squarely are incredibly funny. Their names in Japanese (maruda and kakuri) are a reference to not only the X-Files characters of Mulder and Scully, but also a pun “round” (丸/maru) and “square” (四角い/shikakui), hence the translation I went with. Now watch these become the dub names (assuming we get to see those anytime soon…the social media accounts have been teasing some kind of announcement).\n\nThe Komabros segment, as I mentioned, does have cultural references, so I’ll briefly discuss some of the major ones the episode’s content revolved around for the rest of the segment. In this episode, the Komabros visited Osaka, a popular port city and commercial center. Its main landmark is Osaka Castle, which is shown briefly in the episode (along with the Dotonbori area, famous for its nightlife and entertainment, and the Tsutenkaku Tower, which actually was modeled after the Eiffel Tower). Osaka is the place of origin of takoyaki/octopus balls (which you may recall being the focus of a segment back in ep 135). And - here’s the central joke of the episode - middle-aged women from Osaka are stereotypically viewed as overbearing, but funny and friendly, and they are known for wearing animal-print shirts and giving out candy to strangers. The Osaka ladies take pride in their depiction and use it to make people laugh - a group of Osaka ladies even formed an idol group based on it. Also, I ran into a little problem with translating the kansai-ben dialect spoken in Osaka - it is in many translations changed to an American southern accent, but a very specific joke involving our plucky white komainu friend kinda forced me to use a bad NYC accent instead (I am a New Yorker myself, but my attempt probably wasn’t great :P). You’ll see what I mean when you get to that part.\n\nWhew! What a long post. Good thing there’s no new Yo-kai to talk about too or this post would slow up your screen. Expect releases to be a bit erratic from now on, since I’ve got a busy week or two ahead of me and will be working during summer break. I’ll do the best I can to keep up with the almost-weekly releases…excluding some time I’ll be setting aside to do some work on the movie, anyway. (More on that coming soon, probably.)\n\n“aye can I get uh…….ingredients with my meat”\n\n“beetroot? you want beetroot? you want fucking beet root? Too bad only grass”\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! Softsub, hardsub.\n\nFrom now on, the hardsubs will also be directly uploaded to Dailymotion for mobile users/those who can’t download for whatever reason! Here’s this episode. Dailymotion link has since been taken down.\n\nCelebrate Earth Day by having an episode about some greens. Mmm. Nature. We’re in a bit of a repetitive time in the anime here, but don’t worry, things’ll feel new again soon.\n\nThis episode’s new Yo-kai are quite heavy in the pun department. Our first Yo-kai, Michikusame, comes from michikusa (道草), which means both “loitering on the way/wasting time” and “wayside grass,” and same (鮫), “shark.” In the localized version, he’s known as Chummer. Then we have Wakarunner, from wakaranai (分からない) the negative version of the verb wakaru (分かる), “to understand,” and…well, runner.\n\nHere’s cryptid corner, and one of our last. Mothman is a very famous cryptid allegedly first sighted in West Virginia, and a film called The Mothman Prophecies based on that first sighting was released in 2002. You can check out Mothman’s Cryptid Wiki page here.\n\nI’ll just let you try and figure out what’s going on here.\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! Softsub, hardsub.\n\nEarly release this time around! Figured I owed it to you all since I took an extended break last time. Plus, I really just wanted to get this one over with since next episode is such a big deal. Unfortunately it’s time to say goodbye to Investigation Files, but there’s tons of fun stuff coming up (including my favorite side segment of all time in a few episodes!), so don’t worry.\n\nThis episode technically introduced two Yo-kai, although only one was recorded in the recap. The first of these is Iekabe, a fusion of Ieay and Murikabe who isn’t actually in the games…obviously, his name is just supposed to be a portmanteau of the Yo-kai that combined to form him, but if taken literally, I guess it could mean house (ie, 家) + wall (kabe, 壁). The main Yo-kai of the episode was Demonade. demo ne (でもね) is a phrase that can be translated a few different ways, as I demonstrate in the episode, but most commonly as “then again…” or “but you know…”. The other part of the pun is the kana spelling of the borrowed English word “lemonade” (レモネード).\n\nNext time, the Dream Watch is finally here! I’m just as excited as I’m sure you all are, so I’ll try to get on it as soon as possible, though obviously a new OP/ED set means a little extra work for me. Bear with me!\n\nCredits:\n\nMyself: Translation, timing, and typesetting\n\n@noroinohanak0: QC/final editing, encoding, and distribution\n\nThe OP and ED were taken directly from the episodes we did at NyoroZokuSubs, with permission from my partner. You can check out our website for more information about episodes 113-116 if you haven’t in the past!\n\nRemember to keep yourself as nourished as you can during this crisis! Also this screenshot isn’t what it looks like I promise\n\nTorrent this episode! (Nyaa softsubs) (Nyaa hardsubs) (Nyaa pantsu) (Anidex) Watch this episode on Dailymotion or Vimeo!\n\nWe’re back again, baby! This release follows a number of episodes done by my fellow SpecterSubbers upwards of a year ago, so you’ll notice quite a few quality-of-life improvements in this one if you’re watching in order, namely:\n\nFINALLY fixed up some mistranslations in this OP/ED set (done by me like three years ago…yeesh now I have to wonder how many other things I got wrong in my earlier releases o_o)\n\nI decided to make the default font a little bigger. In hindsight, it’s been too tiny all this time.\n\nA few retranslations/term changes here and there for the Busters Treasure segment and Treasure Yo-kai stuff, since this is my first time translating an episode that has those things.\n\nI know the constant bouncing around in quality can get a little jarring…such is the strange history of Yo-kai Watch fansubs :V\n\nThis episode’s new Yo-kai were Yamatobokeru and Darumacho. Yamatobokeru is a terracotta figure who is apparently a reference to the legend of this guy, a Yamato dynasty-era prince named Yamato Takeru (how many Yamatos were in that sentence?). Tobokeru (惚ける/ とぼける ) can mean “to have a blank expression,” referring to…well, his expression, and boke (ボケ) refers to the funny man of a manzai comedy duo, which is basically what role Yamatobokeru here plays all the time. You’ll also notice a few other legendary figures/beings referenced in YW in the Wikipedia article I linked, though that’s neither here nor there. In English, Yamatobokeru’s name is “Fitwit,” which…I guess is “fit” and “twit” or “nitwit?” Yeah I kinda don’t get this one much. Darumacho’s name is much less complicated, being a simple combination of “daruma,” as in a daruma doll, and “macho.” He’s a Yo-kai Watch 1 Yo-kai, so his localized name has been known for a while…it’s the same! Always nice when a Yo-kai’s name works out perfectly as-is when bringing it over (because the name contained an English loan word to begin with :P).\n\n193 is a…Halloween episode? Never too early for Halloween, I guess (no I will not take until October to release it). In the meantime, I hope everyone stays well during what is surely a difficult time for many let’s overthrow capitalism when this pandemic is over.\n\nSomething something fellow kids\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! Softsub, hardsub.\n\nHey guys, are you ready for Story Time With Kirb™? Here goes!\n\nKomarly Hills 90210 (title in reference to Beverly Hills 90210, a show that is completely inappropriate for this anime’s target demographic) is our new running segment for the next 8 episodes, and it’s my absolute favorite side segment out of the whole bunch. It’s awfully cheesy in the best way possible, the KK Bros are way too adorable, and my favorite Yo-kai gets owned 8 times in a row! Can’t get any better than that. I loved this segment so much, in fact, that a long, long time ago (and by a long, long time ago I mean like a little over a year ago) I actually decided to translate the entire thing mostly just for personal reference, and that turned into “hey why don’t I splice all the eps together and figure out how to sub them?”, and then that eventually turned into me making “Komarly Hills the Movie” and releasing it to a few friends. Except my skills back then were subpar and the translation was horrible so that little project is going in the Disney Vault for the rest of my life. But that did indeed get me to learn Aegisub and buckle down hard on the Japanese studying, and a month or so after it was all said and done a friend who’d known about the Komarly Hills thing directed me towards who would become my partner from the old NyoroZoku group…and the rest is history! So tl;dr, this segment’s the only reason I’m here subbing in the first place, so you ought to thank Jinmen Dog for everything. And boy, is it going to be cathartic revisiting Komarly Hills now that I actually know what the hell I’m doing.\n\nThis has been Story Time With Kirb™…wait, you mean other things besides Komarly Hills happened in this episode?! Oh…\n\nTwo (three?) new Yo-kai this episode once again. The first are the KK Brothers (known separately as K-Koma and K-Jiro), whose names are…uh…the Komabros’…but cooler…? Yeah there’s not any actual wordplay going on here so moving right along. The other new Yo-kai is Kangaeroo, a pun on kangaeru (考える), a verb that has so many meanings that I’m just gonna link you to its dictionary definition because I’m too lazy to list them out. In the context of this episode, though, it’s used as “to ponder,” “to anticipate,” or just plain old “to think about”.\n\nI’ve been pretty good at keeping a schedule, huh? This marks the 4th weekly release in a row! Watch that change now that I’ve said that…\n\nCredits:\n\nMyself: Translation, timing, and typesetting\n\n@noroinohanak0: QC/final editing, encoding, and distribution\n\nTop 10 Photos Taken Just Before Disaster\n\nTorrent this episode! (Softsubs, hardsubs, nyaa.net mirror, Anidex mirror)\n\nWatch this episode on Dailymotion or Vimeo!\n\nHaha look at this guys Halloween special part 2 even though it’s—oh screw it you know the joke by now. What, would you rather wait until October for a new episode? :P\n\nAnyways, I should probably clarify a couple things about this blog. I keep getting asks in my inbox that I don’t always have an answer to individually so please please please direct all questions to @spectersubs​ instead of this account unless they are about some post on this blog specifically being broken. This blog is still used to put my original series releases on since I did so many before the group was created but virtually all of my sub work on the series is a joint effort with them now so questions about release schedules and the other seasons of the show are best fielded over there. I’ve noticed people having problems with torrents and things; unfortunately there isn’t anything I/we can do about old torrents dying and mirrors being taken down so until we can find a permanent solution to that (we’re a little tied up with new releases for the time being), so for now use a streaming service of your choice if there are no other options available (but keep your antivirus and popup blockers on). But we have discussed this issue in our discord server that you can find a link to over on the SpecterSubs blog, so you can ask us stuff there too!\n\nThere’s no new Yo-kai or anything to exposit about this time, so just sit back and enjoy the ride! Episode 195 is probably going to be a while since the group is currently focused on Yo-kai Academy Y, so once again keep your eyes peeled on the SpecterSubs tumblr, twitter and discord for updates."
