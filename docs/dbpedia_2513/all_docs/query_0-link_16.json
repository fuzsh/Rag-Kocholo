        "text": "A tradition as hallowed as the beach episode, and nearly as common, the Christmas anime episode is an opportunity to put anime boys and girls into festive (and often romantic) holiday situations. It works well for a variety of anime, particularly since Christmas mostly lacks the religious element that it has in the west, being more about love and family (and KFC) than faith. And it’s become increasingly common for anime series, especially those that have some slice of life or high school element to them, to have such themed episodes, where feasts, celebrations, and romantic “almosts” are commonplace. But there are some anime, also, in which Christmas is worked into the plot in a more critical way, either as a significant plot element in an episode, the setting for an arc, or in some cases, the background for an entire season or series.\n\nAs we move into the Christmas season and soon begin our annual 12 Days of Christmas Anime posts, I want to request your help. We’ve built a list of Christmas anime episodes, most taken from a forum post now long lost, and added to it over the years. But we know that it’s incomplete. In some cases, we’re missing episodes numbers or titles. And then there are simply entire anime we’ve forgotten or don’t know about.\n\nWould you help us make this list of Christmas anime episodes more complete?\n\nPlease comment below with any that we’re missing, and we’ll update this list as a living document (and credit you as well)!\n\nNote: Linked reference notes below lead to articles we’ve written about those specific Christmas episodes.\n\n.hack//Quantum (three OVAs)\n\n009-1 (OVA) (Ep. 2) – “Holy Night”\n\n7SEEDS (Ep. 7) – “Winter Solstice”\n\nAccel World (Bonus) (Ep. 7) – “Achel World Seven”\n\nAcchi Kocchi (Ep. 10) – “Bear Encounter ⇔ Lovelymas”\n\nAce Attorney (Ep. 8) – “Turnabout Goodbyes – 1st Trial”\n\nAdachi to Shimamura (Ep. 6) – “White Album”\n\nAfter School Dice Club (Ep. 10) – “Happy Holy Night” [1]\n\nAggretsuko (Ep. 11) – “We Wish You a Metal Christmas”\n\nAi Yori Aoshi ~ Enishi (Special) – “Beautiful Snow” [1]\n\nAikatsu!
