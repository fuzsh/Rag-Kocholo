The first game in the series was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013. 3 main sequels and several spinoffs, on both Nintendo and mobile platforms, have been released. In December 2019, they expanded to PlayStation with the release of Yo-kai Watch 4++.\n\nSix manga adaptations have also been produced; one, a series that began serialization in Shogakukan's CoroCoro Comic from December 2012, became an award winner. An anime television series produced by OLM, Inc. began airing in Japan from January 2014 and was a ratings success, boosting the franchise in popularity, and began airing in North America from October 2015. An animated film was released in December 2014; with three more films being produced. As of 2020, the game series had shipped over 16 million copies worldwide.\n\nDespite not meeting Level-5's expectations in the United States, the franchise still enjoyed a successful U.S. launch, with the original 3DS game selling 400,000 units, as well as toys and an airing of the TV series on Disney XD in the United States on October 5, 2015. However, interest in the Yo-kai Watch franchise steadily declined, and Hasbro's Yo-kai Watch toy line was discontinued in the United States in 2017 and in Europe and Latin America in 2018.\n\nConcept\n\nSee also: List of Yo-kai Watch characters\n\nThe franchise was first thought up as a Doraemon IP, something that could be long lasting over a long period of time. Akihiro Hino, CEO of Level-5, researched extensively what makes a franchise long-lasting, and came up with Yo-kai Watch.\n\nYo-kai Watch revolves around befriending Yo-kai that are haunting the city. They are based on traditional Japanese yōkai, but often with clever twists. If one befriends a Yo-kai, they get their friendship medal, an object that allows one to summon Yo-kai. With these, they can summon Yo-kai to either fight other Yo-kai, befriend others, or solve everyday tasks.\n\nThe basic plot for most of the media is that the main character (either Nate or Katie) obtains a Yo-kai Watch through Whisper, a butler Yo-kai. They then befriend Jibanyan, a cat Yo-kai who haunts an intersection because he thinks his owner from when he was alive named Amy called him lame for getting hit by a truck. During the anime's run, other Yo-kai were introduced.\n\nMedia\n\nMain series\n\nThe main video game series is a role-playing video game where the player befriends Yo-kai, and fights the bad ones that seek to rule over the world. The main emphasis in the games is placed on fighting the Yo-kai. All of the main series' games up to Yo-kai Watch 2 have the same battle style; using the 3DS's touchscreen during battles to rotate amongst the player's Yo-kai at will. All of the Yo-kai have powerful moves called Soultimates; some being healing moves, but most of them being offensive. In Yo-kai Watch 3, the battle system was changed into more of a grid-based movement system, and the added use of the Dream Link to use the Yo-kai Blaster against foes during battle.\n\nYo-kai Watch\n\nMain article: Yo-kai Watch (video game)\n\nThe first game in the main series, Yo-kai Watch, was announced at the 2011 Tokyo Game Show and first released in Japan on July 11, 2013. It sets the foundation for the rest of the video game franchise, introducing all of the main mechanics. The game came out in NA on November 6, 2015 and EU on April 29, 2016.\n\nYo-kai Watch 2\n\nMain article: Yo-kai Watch 2\n\nThe second main game in the series, was released in Japan on July 10, 2014 as two versions, Bony Spirits and Fleshy Souls. Yo-kai Watch 2 expands the areas to be explored, with nearly 100 new Yo-kai in the present day of the Kemamoto region (called Harrisville outside of Japan) and the past, where the player time travels to meets traditional Yo-kai and sees their grandfather, who made the predecessor to the Yo-kai Watch. A third version, Psychic Specters, was released on December 12, 2014 to coincide with the first Yo-kai Watch film Yo-kai Watch: Tanjō no Himitsu da Nyan!. Psychic Specters featured characters and scenarios not initially included in Bony Spirits and Fleshy Souls.\n\nBony Spirits and Fleshy Souls were localized in English and released in the United States on September 30, 2016 (April 7, 2017 in Europe). The localized Bony Spirits and Fleshy Souls received the Oni Evolution update on September 14, 2017, making those games compatible with save data from the western release of Psychic Specters on September 29, 2017.\n\nYo-kai Watch 3\n\nMain article: Yo-kai Watch 3\n\nIn Japan, Yo-kai Watch 3 was announced alongside Yo-kai Watch Busters in April 2015 and released in July 2016 in two versions, Sushi and Tempura. The game features a new story mechanic, where two main characters are playable at the same time: Nate and Hailey. The first half of the game has Nate and his family moving from Japan (Springdale in the localization), to the United States (which is called BBQ in the localization), in the fictional town of St. Peanutsburg, where new American-themed \"Merican\" (メリケン) Yo-kai can be found. The other half of the game focuses on a new character, Hailey Anne Thomas, and her partner Yo-kai Usapyon, who run a detective agency together. A third version, Sukiyaki, was eventually released in Japan on December 16, 2016. Sukiyaki combines Sushi and Tempura into one game, as well as additional exclusives.\n\nOn September 27, 2018, Nintendo of America announced that Yo-kai Watch 3 was getting a localization release outside of Japan, which released December 7, 2018 in Europe and February 8, 2019 in North America.\n\nYo-kai Watch 4\n\nMain article: Yo-kai Watch 4\n\nYo-kai Watch 4 was released for the Nintendo Switch in Japan on June 20, 2019. It features character designs from Yo-kai Watch Shadowside, as well as the original designs. The game also includes characters from previous games, as well as the main characters from Yo-kai Watch: Forever Friends.\n\nAn enhanced version, Yo-kai Watch 4++, was later released both as paid DLC as well as at retail for both the Switch and PlayStation 4 on December 5, 2019.\n\nAn English Localization is currently in development as confirmed by LEVEL-5 Inc. during Anime Expo 2019, but an official release date is up in the air as of 2021.\n\nOther video games\n\nBlasters\n\nMain article: Yo-kai Watch Blasters\n\nA spin-off game, Yo-kai Watch Blasters (妖怪ウォッチバスターズ, Yōkai Wotchi Basutāzu) was first announced in the April 2015 issue of CoroCoro Comic alongside Yo-kai Watch 3. Busters allowed up to four players to cooperate in battling boss Yo-kai. The first two versions of the game, Aka Neko-dan (赤猫団, \"Red Cat Troupe\") and Shiro Inu-tai (白犬隊, \"White Dog Corps\"), were released on July 11, 2015. A free expansion for the two Yo-kai Watch Blasters games called Getto-gumi (月兎組, \"Moon Rabbit Crew\") was released on December 12, 2015, adding characters and settings featured in second anime feature film Yo-kai Watch: Enma Daiō to Itsutsu no Monogatari da Nyan!.\n\nA sequel, Yo-kai Watch Busters 2: Secret of the Legendary Treasure Bambalaya (妖怪ウォッチバスターズ2秘宝伝説バンバラヤー, Yōkai Wotchi Basutāzu 2 Hihō Densetsu Banbarayā), was also released in two versions, (ソード, \"Sword\") and (マグナム, \"Magnum\"), on December 16, 2017. The sequel games are compatible with save data from the first games as well as the three versions of Yo-kai Watch 3.\n\nThe first game was localized in English regions as Yo-kai Watch Blasters, where it released on September 7, 2018. The game would be released outside Japan under the same two version branding, as Red Cat Corps and White Dog Squad. A free update for both games, Moon Rabbit Crew, was released on September 27, 2018.\n\nBusters 2 has not been localized into English and likely never will be due to low sales, mostly negative reception, and the fact that the Nintendo 3DS was discontinued.\n\nOther associated games\n\nThe Data Carddass game Yo-kai Watch: Tomodachi UkiUkipedia (妖怪ウォッチ ともだちウキウキペディア) was first location tested in late December 2013, and debuted at the Next Generation World Hobby Fair Winter 2014 before being released in early 2014. The game is played much like Bandai's other Data Carddass games, in which the player uses an interface resembling a slot machine to determine the events of a battle between 3 of the player's Yo-kai against 3 enemy Yo-kai, after the player sought them out on the game interface. Winning the game awards the player a card that can be used for future Tomodachi UkiUkipedia play.\n\nYo-kai Sangokushi (妖怪三国志, lit. \"Yo-kai Three Kingdoms\") was announced alongside Busters and Yo-kai Watch 3 in April 2015. Sangokushi was made in collaboration with Koei Tecmo's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series as well as several mobile games.\n\nIn August 2015, a collaboration with Ubisoft to release a special version of the Just Dance series was announced, set to feature songs from the anime's soundtrack, and the result was Yo-kai Watch Dance: Just Dance Special Version (妖怪ウォッチダンス：ジャストダンスジャストダンススペシャルバージョン, Yōkai Uotchi Dansu: Jasuto Dansu Supesharu Bājon), which was released on the Wii U on December 5, 2015, exclusively in Japan.\n\nOn June 27, 2018, Level-5 and GungHo Online Entertainment announced the release of Yo-kai Watch World, in a special live stream on that day. (Before the same-day release of the game, it was teased online as a \"game that will shock the world\", as stated from Level-5.) Said to compete with Pokémon Go, it featured many new gameplay mechanics, as well as the battle sequences being similar to the original 3DS games. Currently, it's only able to work within Japan, as other locations do not mostly work outside of Japan.\n\nConsole-based spin-offs\n\nYo-kai Watch Blasters (Nintendo 3DS, 2015) – released worldwide (outside Korea) on September 7, 2018, with Moon Rabbit Crew update released on September 27, 2018\n\nYo-kai Watch Dance: Just Dance Special Version (Wii U, 2015) – Exclusive to Japan, Co-developed and published by Ubisoft as part of the Just Dance series\n\nYo-kai Sangokushi (Nintendo 3DS, 2016) – Japan only, Collaboration with Koei Techmo's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series\n\nYo-kai Watch Busters 2: Secret of the Legendary Treasure Bambalaya (Nintendo 3DS, 2017) — Japan only\n\nYo-kai Watch Jam: Yo-kai Academy Y – Waiwai Gakuen Seikatsu (Nintendo Switch, 2020) — Japan only\n\nSmartphone apps\n\nYo-kai Land (iOS, Android, 2015) – Produced by Hasbro\n\nYo-kai Taiso Dai-Ichi Puzzle da Nyan (ようかい体操第一 パズルだニャン, Yōkai Taisō Dai-Ichi Pazuru da Nyan, lit. \"Yo-kai Exercise No. 1: Puzzle Meow\") (iOS, Android, 2013)\n\nYo-kai Watch: Puni Puni (妖怪ウォッチ ぷにぷに, Yōkai Wotchi Puni-puni) (iOS, Android, 2015)\n\nYo-kai Watch: Wibble Wobble (iOS, Android, 2016)\n\nYo-kai Watch: Gerapo Rhythm (妖怪ウォッチ ゲラポリズム, Yōkai Wotchi Gerapo Rizumu) (iOS, Android, 2018)\n\nYo-kai Daijiten (妖怪大辞典, lit. \"Great Yo-kai Dictionary\") (iOS, Android, 2018)\n\nYo-kai Sangokushi: Kunitori Wars (妖怪三国志 国盗りウォーズ, Yōkai Wocchi Kunitori Wōzu) (iOS, Android, 2018) – Co-produced with Koei Tecmo\n\nYo-kai Watch World (妖怪ウォッチワールド, Yōkai Wocchi Wārudo) (iOS, Android, June 27, 2018) – Co-produced by GungHo Online Entertainment inc., with a Google Maps-based engine\n\nYo-kai Watch: Medal Wars (妖怪ウォッチ メダルウォーズ, Yōkai Wocchi Medaru Wōzu) (iOS, Android, 2019) – Co-produced with Netmarble\n\nManga and comics\n\nSix manga adaptations based on the series have been published by Shogakukan.

In the series, the art style was different from the current designs, like the early design of the Yo-kai Watch, and also has different character personalities. As the games and anime were released, the manga kept the art style, but the characters also slowly developed over time.\n\nVolume 16 transitioned the manga into the current \"Yo-kai Watch!\" anime timeline, while still keeping the art style of the previous edition.\n\nNo. Japanese release date Japanese ISBN English release date English ISBN 1 June 28, 2013 ISBN: 978-4-09141-655-1 November 3, 2015 ISBN: 978-1-42158-251-1 2 December 27, 2013 ISBN: 978-4-09140-018-5 November 3, 2015 ISBN: 978-1-42158-252-8 3 March 25, 2014 ISBN: 978-4-09141-709-1 January 5, 2016 ISBN: 978-1-42158-273-3 4 July 25, 2014 ISBN: 978-4-09141-793-0 March 1, 2016 ISBN: 978-1-42158-274-0 5 October 28, 2014 ISBN: 978-4-09141-817-3 May 3, 2016 ISBN: 978-1-42158-275-7 6 February 27, 2015 ISBN: 978-4-09141-876-0 December 6, 2016 ISBN: 978-1-42159-217-6 7 June 26, 2015 ISBN: 978-4-09142-006-0 March 7, 2017 ISBN: 978-1-42159-218-3 8 September 28, 2015 ISBN: 978-4-09142-102-9 January 2, 2018 ISBN: 978-1-42159-691-4 9 February 26, 2016 ISBN: 978-4-09142-119-7 July 3, 2018 ISBN: 978-1-42159-753-9 10 June 24, 2016 ISBN: 978-4-09142-175-3 January 8, 2019 ISBN: 978-1-42159-754-6 11 August 5, 2016 ISBN: 978-4-09159-232-3 May 14, 2019 ISBN: 978-1-42159-755-3 12 April 28, 2017 ISBN: 978-4-09142-389-4 September 12, 2019 ISBN: 978-1-97470-310-4 13 September 28, 2017 ISBN: 978-4-09-142530-0 January 14, 2020 ISBN: 978-1-97470-311-1 14 November 28, 2017 ISBN: 978-4-09-142637-6 May 12, 2020 ISBN: 978-1-97470-312-8 15 May 28, 2018 ISBN: 978-4-09-142710-6 September 8, 2020 ISBN: 978-1-97470-608-2 16 July 26, 2019 ISBN: 978-4-09-143046-5 January 12, 2021 — 17 October 28, 2019 ISBN: 978-4-09143-109-7 May 11, 2021 — 18 July 27, 2020 — --- —\n\nYo-kai Watch: Exciting Nyanderful Days\n\nNo. Release date ISBN 1 December 25, 2014 ISBN: 978-4-09136-714-3 2 October 30, 2015 ISBN: 978-4-09137-888-0 3 July 22, 2016 —\n\nYo-kai Watch: 4-Panel Pun-Club\n\nNo. Release date ISBN 1 June 18, 2015 ISBN: 978-4-09281-232-1 2 January 28, 2016 ISBN: 978-4-09281-233-8\n\nYo-kai Watch Busters\n\nNo. Release date ISBN 1 September 28, 2015 ISBN: 978-4-09142-100-5\n\n4-Panel Yo-kai Watch: Geragera Manga Theater\n\nNo. Release date ISBN 1 October 28, 2015 ISBN: 978-4-09142-105-0\n\nKomasan: A Time for Fireworks and Miracles\n\nNo. Release date ISBN 1 December 11, 2015 ISBN: 978-4-09187-427-6\n\nAnime\n\nMain articles: List of Yo-kai Watch episodes, Yo-kai Watch: The Movie, Yo-kai Watch: Enma Daiō to Itsutsu no Monogatari da Nyan!, Yo-kai Watch: Soratobu Kujira to Double no Sekai no Daibōken da Nyan!, Yo-kai Watch Shadowside: Oni-ō no Fukkatsu, Yo-kai Watch Shadowside, Yo-kai Watch: Forever Friends, and Yo-kai Watch!
