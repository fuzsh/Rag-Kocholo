Dai-Ichi-Wa \"Hitojichi\"\" (太陽にほえるズラ！ 第一話「人質」), \"Yōkai Asekkaki\" (妖怪あせっか鬼), \"Yōkai Brokenbrella\" (妖怪さかさっ傘) Original air date August 1, 2014 English air date August 3, 2016 Channel Disney XD Previous Yo-kai Watch Episode 28 Next Yo-kai Watch Episode 30 Discussion Episode 29 Forum Post\n\nYo-kai Watch Episode 29 is an episode of Yo-kai Watch Anime. It consists of Part 1: Springdale Five-Yo: Episode 1 - The Unwilling Occupant, Part 2: Yo-kai Swelton and Part 3: Yo-kai Brokenbella stories.\n\nPart 1: Springdale Five-Yo: Episode 1 - The Unwilling Occupant\n\nThis episode begins a new comedic miniseries starring Komasan and Whisper as police detectives. After Komasan and Whisper are introduced to each other, they set off on their first case. The police have managed to corner a known burglar, but he took a hostage, and it’s Whisper & Komasan’s job to defuse the situation.\n\nThe burglar’s demanding a high sum of money, but obviously the police aren’t going to pay it, so he asks for a helicopter to escape—and Komasan brings him a toy helicopter. This enrages the burglar, so Whisper decides it’s a good idea to call the burglar’s mom and have her persuade him. Komasan calls the burglar’s mom, but rather than persuading the burglar, Komasan talks to her about what she’s preparing for dinner.\n\nThis irritates Whisper and initially seems to be a waste of time. However, Komasan talks to the burglar’s mom for so long about dinner that the burglar releases the hostage and runs over to yell at Komasan, leading to a successful arrest! Back at the station, Komasan and Whisper are talking about the day’s events. Despite Komasan’s unorthodox way of handling the hostage situation, Whisper commends him, and the two pledge to protect the city’s peace.\n\nPart 2: Yo-kai Swelton\n\nIt’s a hot summer day. Nate, Whisper, and Jibanyan are staying inside to stay cool, but even inside they’re feeling the heat. Jibanyan tries to eat one of his favorite chocolate bars, but he pitches a huge fit when it melts in his paws. Whisper and Nate are tired of Jibanyan’s complaining, so they decide to go to the pool to cool off.\n\nOf course, it’s even hotter outside—but something’s weird, Jibanyan is sweating a little too much. Soon, Nate and Whisper realize they’re sweating buckets too. Nate senses a Yo-kai at work, and when he uses his Yo-kai Watch he discovers Swelton, a rather large oni Yo-kai who causes everyone near him to sweat profusely.\n\nSwelton can’t turn off his sweat-inducing powers, but he can switch from “dripping sweat” mode to “youthful sweat” mode, a mode that causes people to look handsome with youthful sweat—but it also causes them to make weird poses in slow motion. Neither mode is preferable, so Whisper suggests getting the Yo-kai Slicenrice to get rid of Swelton. Slicenrice is a Yo-kai that is able to defeat oni such as Swelton, which will stop Nate and co. from sweating.\n\nAs if on cue, Slicenrice shows up, and offers the group some rice balls. After Slicenrice introduces himself, Jibanyan notices that Slicenrice doesn’t sweat—that’s because he’s made of rice, thus he can’t sweat. Swelton actually thinks this is amazing, since this is the first person he’s ever met that doesn’t sweat. The two Yo-kai become fast friends, and as a result of the newly-forged Yo-kai friendship, Nate receives both of their Yo-kai Medals… covered in rice and sweat. Yuck.\n\nLater, Slicenrice and Swelton pay a visit to Nate’s house. They brought him some rice balls… made with Swelton’s sweat. It turns out the salt in Swelton’s sweat is perfect for seasoning rice balls. Naturally, Nate is completely grossed out by this and refuses them!\n\nPart 3: Yo-kai Brokenbella\n\nThe heat has gone and now it’s a rainy day. Nate and his buddies are trying to get home after school, but powerful wind keeps flipping their umbrellas inside-out, causing them to get soaked with rain. The wind gets so bad that Bear and Eddie decide to dash home to get out of the rain, leaving Nate by himself.\n\nLater, Nate is passing through the playground when suddenly his umbrella starts flipping inside- out, even though there’s no wind! Whisper tries to tell him that it’s really just the wind, but Nate doesn’t believe that and whips out the Yo-kai Watch to reveal Brokenbrella! Brokenbrella causes people’s umbrellas to flip inside-out on windy days, inconveniencing them. He’s also a very rude Yo-kai, insulting Nate almost immediately.\n\nBrokenbrella explains his backstory—he was a regular umbrella with dreams of going on a journey. One-by- one, all of the umbrellas were taken except for him, until one day a human finally picked him up and bought him. But, it was not fated to be, for the day he was bought was a brutally rainy and windy day, and the umbrella couldn’t withstand the wind. When he flipped inside-out, his human owner discarded him immediately. With his dreams crushed, the umbrella’s anger at being thrown away transformed him into the Yo-kai Brokenbrella.\n\nWhisper understands Brokenbrella’s feelings and is very moved by his sad story—but Nate points out that it’s still annoying that he’s causing trouble for other people by flipping their umbrellas inside out. Nate needs a Yo-kai for this situation, so he thrusts his arm into Whisper’s mouth to retrieve the Yo-kai Watch Type Zero in order to summon Jibanyan.\n\nThis doesn’t work out very well because obviously Jibanyan hates the rain because he’s a cat, and he refuses to fight. Whisper then suggests that Nate summon Pallysol to deal with the situation, since he’s a powerful umbrella Yo-kai that can’t be turned inside out and could train Brokenbrella.\n\nAfter a bit of a spat with Brokenbrella, Pallysol agrees to train him. This “legendary training” involves weight-lifting and wind resistance training, among other exercises. After the training, Brokenbrella is very grateful for Pallysol’s assistance in helping him join the ranks of the “adult umbrellas.” As an expression of his gratitude, Brokenbrella grants Nate his Yo-kai Medal.\n\nBefore they can celebrate, an extremely powerful wind starts to pass through the area—Pallysol implores Brokenbrella to demonstrate the fruits of his training… but it’s no good. Pallysol ends up completely shredded (on account of being a paper umbrella) and Brokenbrella is turned inside out again.\n\nCharacters\n\nHumans\n\nNate\n\nEddie\n\nBear\n\nYokai"
