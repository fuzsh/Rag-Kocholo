His reputation as an honest and reliable interpreter was now established, and for more than twenty years thereafter he was in almost incessant employ of the different colonial governments. Thus, while William Penn made one treaty, or contract, with the Indians, it is safe to say that Conrad Weiser was instrumental in between\n\nit\n\nlease of the territory lying\n\neffecting dozens of them.\n\nThe\n\ncolonial records of Pennsylvania,\n\nNew York\n\nand Virginia are full of the reports concerning his hazardous and lonely journeys, covering hundreds of miles over trackless wildernesses, with no resting places except Indian villages.

Dr. \\. C.\n\nTUE PENN8 YL YANIA-GERMA N.\n\n20\n\nShacffer,\n\nState Superintendent of Public Instruction\n\nsyvania, in a recent address:\n\n\"I tried several years\n\nin\n\nPenn-\n\nago\n\nto get\n\nname of Conrad YVeiser. In the same sentence occurred the name of Lindley Murray. The name of the grammarian was allowed to stand, that of the Indian interpreter was cut out, as if the prevention of grammatical mistakes were of more consequence than the prevention of war and bloodshed; as if parsing were of more consequence than peace-making. I resolved that at the first suitable opportunity I would draw into one of our school-books the\n\npublic attention to the services of the\n\nman who\n\nhelped to negotiate, every important treaty\n\ntime with the Indians of Pennsylvania,\n\nnegotiated, or\n\nmade during\n\nNew\n\nhis lite-\n\nYork, Virginia and\n\nthe Carolinas.\n\n\"At the time when the French occupied the Mississippi Valley and the Lake Regions, whilst the English occupied a narrow strip along the Atlantic Coast, it was a question whether the Xew World should be dominated by the civil and political ideas of the Anglo-Saxon race, or by the ecclesiasticism, despotism and pernicious influences of the French people. The destinies of England, with a population of twenty millions, and Prussia with five millions, were to be decided in an apparently unequal struggle with the combined strength of Austria, Russia. France and other States, having an aggregate population of over one hundred millions. In view of Braddock's defeat, when the English were pitted against the French and the Indians, it looks as if the red man held the balance of power in the Xew World. \"Bancroft tells us that Six Nations remained neutral, but he does not tell how this neutrality came about. Apparently he did not know that the great Indian interpreter. Conrad Weiser, made a trip of two hundred miles to the Six Nations for the purpose of advising them not to side with the French. It was a trip as heroic as that of marching through Georgia, or ^i penetrating into the wilderness of Africa. When Conrad Weiser reached the Six Nations two French emissaries had been at work for two days trying to persuade the Indians that the time was ripe for them to sweep the English settlements from the Atlantic coast. Conrad Weiser succeeded in convincing them that the quarrel oi the French with the English was not one in which the Indians should take part, and thus he made possible the triumph oi the English race at Quebec. Conrad Weiser looms up one of the\n\nCOSRAD WEISER.\n\n11\n\nmoulding factors in that epoch-making period of the world's history, which gave a continent to the English nation, and by his influence over the red man he helped William Pitt and Frederick the Great to give history a new trend and to save the northern half of the New World from those Latin influences which have cursed Cuba, Mexico, Central and South America/\"' Although for the latter half of his life Weiser was much of a public servant he did not neglect his own community, but gave it all the time and attention he could command. We have already seen what he did for schools and churches. He likewise sought to promote local government and general advancement. He was early appointed by the authorities as a justice of the peace, and as an officer of the law he was conscientious, vigilant and unflinching in his convictions of right.\n\n1734 in establishing a\n\nHe\n\nalso succeeded as early as\n\nnew township out\n\nof the extensive territory\n\nof Tulpehocken, and in 1738 began to agitate the erection of a\n\nnew county out Philadelphia.\n\nIt\n\nof the extreme northern parts of Lancaster and\n\nwas only\n\nafter repeated efforts, however, that in\n\n1752 the General Assembly finally granted this prayer of the petitioners, of whom Weiser was chief agitator.

The red men had generally been friendly to Penn and his colonists, and were for years on peaceable terms with the German settlers in the Tulpehocken and Swatara valleys, very largely due to the influence oi W'eiser.

But in Weiser the white settlers had a loyal and persistent leader. Among the most stirring letters that can be written are his appeals to Governor Morris, in their behalf. But it was not until a visit had been made and the case was laid in person before the peace-loving authorities that Weiser and his countrymen succeeded in arousing the Quaker Government of that day to proper Finally, however, troops were sent and the proper miliaction. tary measures put into operation. And soon the white people had shelter and protection against their cruel and hostile foes. Conrad Weiser and his sons were themselves volunteers and leaders in the effort of their expulsion. The former, having been commissioned colonel of an improvised regiment of farmers, conducted a bold march up the entire valley to the Susquehanna and superintended the erection and garrisoning of a number of Indian forts along the base of the Blue Mountains. Weiser raised a large and honorable family of children, seven of whom survived him.* His journal makes touching allusion to the death of several children, who preceded him in their journey to the spirit land.

We have chosen Harrisburg as our first excursion center. What that German annals of the State did not begin here, or that this city's ancient history is written in Scotch-Irish? We will get to Germantown that first American camping-ground of our ancestral stock by and by. ?\\or will it harm us to get an early look at this old neighbor of ours who shared our pioneer hardships and helped to fell Penn's vast Forest and tight our early battles, even though his name begins with \"Mae.\" and his blood had a strain of the Gaelic or Celtic in it. It was staunch, nevertheless, and in many cases has mixed well with that of the Saxon. Even if he sometimes sneered at the \"dumb Dutch.\" the latter has long since taken his land— by honest purchase and occupied his old town by the historic Susquehanna. It is most convenient for our purpose to begin our pilgrimage at Har : risburg. and that should be sufficient. The guide should have something to say in this matter. Besides, Harrisburg is the capital oi the State, and a convenient railroad center. What schemes have not been railroaded to, through,, or at this State's capital! So. then, without another \\\\.>rd. as tally-ho is rigged up and steeds are prancing, we'll be u for our will thus visit all\n\n:\n\n—\n\n.\n\n—\n\nfi\n\nlvstoric jaunt.\n\nHarrisburg has a number meeting and starting point. of\n\nhistoric\n\nThe The\n\nland-marks, suggesting\n\na suit\n\nold John Harris' l< u and son's mansion, erected in 1700. the old\n\nsite of\n\nmarked today.

But our trip is not westward. and hence we must part company with Washington and his compatriots at this old hostelrie. and turn our eyei to the east to the Horse Shoe pike, over ten mile- of which the illustrious Chief Executive and his eastern army had traveled in this historic trip to position in ply of\n\n•\n\n;\n\n—\n\nthe west.\n\nThe Horse Shoe Pike! life\n\nlies\n\nalong\n\nthe story of\n\nits\n\nthis ancient\n\nown\n\nWhat\n\na flood of history, of traffic\n\nhighway!\n\nIt\n\nwould be\n\nand checkered\n\nof interest to\n\nrecount\n\nconstruction a century ago, to watch the tide of emi-\n\ngration that settled along\n\nits\n\nline or\n\nflowed on to the west beyond, and\n\nto note the healthy life-blood of old-time\n\ncommerce\n\nthat freely circulated\n\nup and down this early artery of the State. But this would only delay us and make us mi>s the exhilaration of our trip. We shall see gliosis enough flit by as we pass along the route. Every old tavern and tollhouse, every mill and mile-post, every hut and homestead, every church and church-yard, hold goblins and ghosts for such as have a swift-winged fancy. There are spectres enough for such as wear glasses fitted with antiquarian lenses. Immense droves of cattle and Long processions of Conestoga teams will again people the roadway, and the shout of the dp and teamsters is heard in the stable-yard of every old inn. until yarns of \"ye olden time\" are spun into your brain that will be apt to make you dream of Thomas Buchanan Read's wild wagoners of the Alleghenies. But now all aboard and we'll be off! We'll take the Market street route, cross the Pennsylvania and Reading dangerous railroad crossings, climb Allison's Hill and take our way out by Derry street, which is the old pike. The growth of East Harrisburg gives us nearly two miles oi city to traverse, before we cross Paxton creek at the old Rudy farm, now also cut up into building lots of the choicest quality. Here .we come into the open and before us lie the broad acres of the Elders, whose land and ancient homestead i< still in the same hands, much improved and enhanced in value, as the f.. name has gained honor ami distinction. About this region prevailed during the period of Indian depredations ami wars in Colonial days greatest possible excitement. Xo name figured more prominently in the itielling oi the tr< uhlcs and the expulsion of the hostile savages than thai •\n\nElder.

Joshua Elder likewise has rendered his county and State conspicuous service, and his name stands high in the annals of the Commonwealth. So do other scions of this family. The ancestral homestead, somewhat modernized, stands a little off the roadside to the north. All of the older members of this family lie buried at the Paxtang churchyard, which is off about half a mile to the north of the road at what is now Paxtang station on the P. & R.

Ireland, and had emigrated in 1728 and 1729, respectively, and were married in 17.30, residing twenty-five years in Donegal township, Lancaster County, before purchasing\" the large tract at this place, which is still in the family ii;.me. Three of their five sons were soldiers in the Revolutionary war. while representatives of the family fought in every succeeding war r>\\ our nation since. In this their ancestors had set them a good example in the fatherland, where they maintained the cause of religious liberty on the bloody fields of Drumclog, Louden, Pentland Hills, Boyne Water and Bannock Burn. At the unveiling of a beautiful monument erected two years ago more than one hundred of the surviving members of the family, filling all the honorable walks in life, were in attendance. The monument is imposing and costly, and stands on the Paxton church-yard, the Westminster Abbey, where rest the ancestral bones of many a staunch defender and builder of our nation.\n\nIt\n\nstands near where our pike\n\nerford Station, and\n\nOn rolls our tally-ho.

Beyond the occasional side-tracking to discover fine historical facts, we must keep OUT straight ahead. Yet we must make a brief halt at lumnielstown. for here we come upon German soil indeed. FTummelstown was founded by Frederick Hummel, a native oi VYurtemberg, Germany, during the first half of last century. It was first named a:ter the founder's Christian name. Frederickstown. but later changed to fummelstown. The founders of the town were also the founders of a cross our path, or else\n\nroads, railroads,\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\nfamily tree, whose noteworthy branches have stretched forth and wide, and which have borne, and is still bearing, good Fruit.

Near this place was born the Hon. Alexander Ramsey, a son of Thomas and Elizabeth (Kelker) Ramsey. His mother was a daughter of Henry and Elizabeth (Greenawalt) Kelker, through whom a strain of the best German blood was mixed with that of the Scotch-Irish on the paternal Mr. Ramsey always claimed to be a Pennsylvania \"Dutchman.\" and line. and was proud of his kin, who have had occasion to be proud of him. who filled the honored stations of Congressman from Pennsvlvania. tectorial and State Governor of Minnesota, and, by treaty with the Indians, opened the western part of that State to colonization. He was also mayor of St. Paul, and United States Senator from Minnesota for twelve years, Secretary of War, under President Hayes; served on the Utah Commission, by appointment of President Arthur: and in 1887 was a delegate to the Centennial Celebration, at Philadelphia, of the adoption of the Constitution of the\n\nUnited States.\n\nAt Hummelstown, also, was born, about forty years ago, another brilliant son of Saxon blood in the eminent eye-specialist of the Philadelphia Medico-Chirurgical Hospital, whose star of fame is visible in two continents, Dr. Webster Fox. son of an old-time practitioner of this town.\n\nwould be interesting to stop to read what history and biography is Lutheran (the oldest) church-yard records and building, where for 150 years worship has been maintained (second edifice erected 1815) and the Gospel been preached (until recently wholly or partly in German) by a long list of able pastors, the most eminent of whom, perhaps, was the late Dr. C.

Here may yet be seen a pewter communion tankard and goblets that came as a gift to the conf gation at its foundation, from England.

The new settlement, in 1732, was founded in the wilderness on the bank* of the Cocalico. Ephrata was founded, and after zealous missionary or proselyting efforts the community became established.

John Peter Miller, the wife of Christopher Saur, (the illustrious printer of Germantown), the Eckerlins, and converts from the surrounding counties, from New Jersey. Maryland and even Germany, were either temporarily or permanently attracted to it. A wealthy Swiss, Benedict Yuchly by name, was attracted to the community and left his wealth for building purposes.

Rev. J. Philip Boehm, who was the founder of this latter7 congregation of the Reformed, and who had been temporarily supplanted by Weiss and Miller, writes thus suspiciously of Miller in his report to the sonally acquainted with Beissel,\n\nSynod in Holland, Oct. 18, 1734: \"At present there is only one other (Reformed) minister in this province, Peter Miller.

His renunciation of the Reformed faith and pastorate occurred the following spring when he was baptized by Beissel. Boehm again in his report of 1739. alludes to him as having publicly gone over \"to the dissolute Seventh Day Dunkers and was baptized in Dunker fashion at Conestoga in the month of April, 1735. He took ten families, Reformed and Lutheran, from the congregation of Tulpehocken with him, who followed his example. This created a great commotion among the\n\nlead the people can clearly be seen things, that about\n\ncongregations.\"\n\nThe Chronicon\n\nEpJiratcusc after recording Pastor\n\nMillers settlement at Tulpehocken gives the following account of his conversion to this sect:\n\n\"The superintendent\n\n(Beissel), after\n\nhe had heard that two young preachers had come into the country,\n\nwho\n\nstood in good repute as to their character, and also thought\n\nwell of his work,\n\naware of\n\nhis\n\nown\n\ninability, in\n\nview of the import-\n\nwork before him, thought in his foolishness that this work would be better carried out if God would provide one of the>e young preachers for him, for which also, he often bowed his knees ant\n\nbefore God.\n\nThis led to important matters.\n\ndent soon after found occasion to\n\nmake\n\nFor the superintenTulpehocken\n\na visit to\n\nwith several of his disciples, where he was received by the teacher\n\nTHi:\n\nS\n\nPENNSytVAXrAGERUAy.\n\nand elders with the consideration due to him as an ambassador of God, while on his return the teacher, and C. \\V. (Conrad Wciser), an elder, accompanied him over the mountains for six miles. The result of their visit to Tulpehocken was'that the teacher, the elders and several others withdrew from the Church Whereupon a venerable Pietist, by the name of Casper Leibbecker, took the teacher's place in the Church Accordingly they were baptized together under the water, after the teaching of Christ, which was clone on a Sabbath in May of the year 1735. Thus the teacher, schoolmaster, three elders, besides various other households, went :\n\nover from the Protestant to\n\nthis\n\nnew awakening, while\n\nfor\n\nsome\n\ntime after the door was kept open for the Babylonian refugees. Soon after the Brethren erected a solitary residence for the teacher at the foot of a high hill in Tulpehocken, where, however, he .\n\nlived no longer than\n\ngreat conversion\n\ntill\n\nfilled\n\nthe next\n\nNovember\n\nThe\n\nreport of this\n\nnot only this and neighboring countries, but\n\npenetrated even into Germany.\"\n\nThus\n\ncame to take up his abode and work with Beissel. While Contrad Weiser, after a few years of loyal adherence, returned to his first love, drawn back by his domestic ties. the political demands and his religious convictions, * Miller remained faithful to his new espousal during all of his extended litetime. He was soon selected as one of the four leaders of the community, chosen because of their superior excellence. Miller was named Brother Jabez, and after the removal of Onesimus (Mr. Miller\n\nat Ephrata.\n\n.\n\nEckerlin) as Prior of the Convent, in 1745. he permanently sucin this office, having previously been temporary or as-\n\nceeded him *The\n\nChronicon\n\nEphratenae (pp. 82-85), written by Miller, attributes to wicked aud worldly motives, asserting that Gov.
