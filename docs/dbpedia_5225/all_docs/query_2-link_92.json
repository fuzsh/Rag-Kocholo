A fine brick hotel and store were erected' last year by Henry Gast. John Link has also a fine business house. George Ferner, druggist ; Charles Stelzer, hotel.

Wc quote his own language in regard to the settlement of these people:—\n\nMy early education would naturally lead me to look upon learning and good morals as of infinite importance in a land of liberty. In the winter of 1833-4 I providentially became acquainted with the colored population of Cincinnati, Ohio, and found about 4000, totally igno-\n\nHISTORY OF VAN WERT AND MERCER COUNTIES, OHIO - 479\n\nrant of everything calculated to make good citizens. Most of them bad been slaves, shut out from every avenue of moral and mental improvement. I started a school for them, and kept it up for them for two years, with two hundred pupils. I then proposed to the colored people to move into the country and purchase land, and remove from those contaminating influences which had so long crushed them in our cities and villages. They promised to do so, provided I would accompany them and teach school. I travelled through Canada, Michigan, and Indiana looking for a suitable location, and finally settled here, thinking this place contained more natural advantages than any other unoccupied country within my knowledge.\n\nIn 1835 I made the first purchase for the colored people in Mercer County. In about three years they owned not far from 30,000 acres of land. I had travelled into almost every neighborhood of colored people in the State, and laid before them the benefits of a permanent home for themselves and of the education of their children.\n\nIn my first journey through the State I established, by the assistance and co-operation of Abolitionists, twenty-five schools for colored children. I collected from the colored people such money as they had to spare, and entered land for them. Many who had no money, afterwards succeeded in raising some, and brought it to me, and with this I bought land for them.\n\nI purchased for myself 190 acres of land to establish a Manual Labor School for colored boys. 1 had sustained a school on it at my own expense until November 11, 1842. Being in Philadelphia the winter before, I became acquainted with the trustees of the late Samuel Emlen, of New Jersey, of the denomination called \" Friends.\" He left by his will 20,000 for the support and education iii school learning and the mechanical arts and agriculture, for such boys of African and Indian descent whose parents would give them up to the Institute. We united our means, and they purchased my farm and appointed me the superintendent of the establishment, which they called the-\n\nEmlen Institute.\n\nIn 1845, Judge Leigh, of Virginia, purchased 3200 acres of land in this settlement for the freed slaves of John Randolph, of Roanoke. These arrived in the summer of 1846, to the number of about 400, but were forcibly prevented from making a settlement by a portion of the inhabitants of the county. Since then acts of hostility have been commenced against the people of this settlement, and threats of greater held out, if they do not abandon their lands and their homes.\n\nIn Brown County there are two large settlements of colored persons, amounting to five hundred each. One is three miles north of Georgetown, and the other is in the northeast part of the county, sixteen miles distant. They emigrated from Virginia, and were the slaves of Samuel Gest, who manumitted and settled them upon two large surveys of land. Their situation is not prosperous.\n\nIn the southern part of Mercer County is a colony of colored persons, amounting to several hundreds. They live principally by agriculture, and own extensive lands in the townships of Granville, Franklin, and Marion, founded by Augustus Willetts.\n\nIn Van Buren Township, Shelby. County, about four hundred colored Persons settled. An attempt was made in July, 1846, to colonize with them three hundred and eighty-five of the emancipated slaves of John Randolph, of Virginia, after they were driven from Mercer County, and scattered in Miami and Shelby counties.\n\nIn the office of the clerk of Common Pleas of Mercer County, Ohio, is a manuscript docket entitled \"Record of Free Blacks,\" in which are the following entries :-\n\nState of Kentucky, Mason County, June 21, 1842, John James Key, clerk of said Court, certifies that at the April Court, 1832, Thomas Bowles produced his certificate of his being a free man from the corporation of Lynchburg., Virginia, which was ordered to be recorded, he being thirty-five years of age, of black complexion, five feet nine and a half inches high, which certificate bears date March 29, 1826.\n\nOn December 21, 1842, Thomas Bowles registered his son, aged twenty years, five feet six and a half inches high, bushy head, and heavy make, mulatto color, with a scar in the upper edge of the right eyebrow.—\n\nFRANKLIN LINZEE, Clerk.\n\nNorth Carolina, Northampton County, March 4, 1834.
