The Champai gn County information was researched by myself.\n\nEliphas is a farmer by occupation, and emigrated to Ohio in 1818, locati ng in what was then Madison Co., but what has since been organized into Un ion Co. After a short residence here, he returned to his native State, mar ried Lydia Mecham, came back and established a permanent home in Union County. He still survives at the advanced age of 81 years, one of the highly re spected and valuable citizens of the county, and one of her pioneers. H is wife, Lydia, deceased in 1867, aged 71. He had five sons and three daug hters, one son(Jared) dying in his youth; one(Lucas at Vicksburg) in the s ervice of his country, and one daughter(Dorcas S.) in early life ; the oth ers live in the vicinity of the homestead. He has been prominently identif ied with the offices of the township in which he resides, being Assessor f or over thirty years, and Justice of the Peace, and has done a great de al of administrator's work. For several winters after locating here, he oc cupied the role of a teacher, on pay at the rate of $8 per month, boardi ng himself. Andrew is the third of the family, and has made \"tilling of t he soil\" his life occupation. He was educated in the district school, a nd remained at home till he grew to manhood, making his first permanent lo cation at his present place, in the spring of 1856, where he ha since resi ded. He has been married twice-first, in 1855, to Virginia E. Crawford bo rn in Mechanicsburg, of Virginia ancestors; they had three sons ; in 186 6, he married Nancy M. Amy, a native of Union Co.; one daughter has been t he issue of this union. Prudence Amy, mother of Mrs. Burnham, became a res ident of Union Co. fifty one, and of this county forty-five, years ago, a nd still survives at the advanced age of 84, with her mental and physic al powers well preserved.

He marri ed Ann Journee on March 7, 1821 in Monmnouth County NJ by James G. Herbe rt (civil marriage?). They lived in Nottingham, now known as Hamilton Sq uare NJ, but appeared to move to Champaign Ohio by the 1850 Census. I bel ieve he had connections with Joshua Evernham who married Ann Taylor and mo ved to Ill. by the 1860 Census.\n\nHis wife appears to come from a family that had roots in present day Ea st Windsor NJ and Freehold NJ. I feel rather stronbgly that this might be one of the missing childr en of a Henry Everingham who was born around 1764 and farmed in the East W indsor NJ area. He was reputed to have had total of 16 children, but on ly the last 4 children with his 4th wife Rebecca James, have ever been doc umented and recorded. (They were, starting in 1815; Henry, Ellison, Mart ha & Aaron Radford). I strongly believe that your Ezekial could have be en a son from his first or second marriage. The choice of Henry as the fi rst name of his first born may be indicative of this.

During the summer of 1855, S.G. B recount and brother cleared away the unbroken forest, where the villa ge of Conover is now located, and erected a warehouse on the Columbus, Piq ua & Indiana Railroad, which is now known as the Cincinnati, Columbus & In diana Central Railroad, a through line from east to west. The structure a nd capacity of the building was based upon expected patronage of the energ etic farmers of the surrounding vicinity. On Oct. 11, of the same fall, th ey purchased their first load of grain from John Wolcott, Jr. S.G. Brecou nt & Bro. carried on their business with some inconvenience and pecunia ry disadvantages for a few years, but with a liberal patronage. Their part nership continued until 1858, when S.G. Brecount retired from its duties a nd turned it to his son, A.L. Brecount (the firm now being J.D. & A.L. Bre count). During this partnership, gradual improvements were made in the man ner of handling grain. In 1859 or 1860, the third member, J.C.White, engag ed in the business, forming the firm of Brecount & White. They also open ed the first store in Conover, stocking it with general merchandise, whe re they soon built up a healthy trade in connection with the grain busines s. This firm transacted business until 1861, or 1862, when a third chan ge took place, and the business was managed by J.D. Brecount alone until 1 864, when E.R. Doup with the above, formed the firm of Brecount & Doup, wh ich lasted one year only, after which J.D. Brecount transacted the busine ss alone until 1871. During this time the grain had been weighed on sma ll scales in the house. At the last date, G.W. Brecount formed the fi rm of Brecount & Son, and large Fairbank scales were added to their facili ties of weighing grain. In June, 1877, the last change took place by E. A. Brecount forming the firm of Brecount & Sons. During the past all the g rain was handled in the original building. In the fall of 1877, their corn -house was erected, with a capacity sufficient to store 8,000 bushels of c orn. Their dump for unloading corn is one of the best in the county. The ir advantages for loading on the sidetrack are such that a car has been lo aded in the small space of ten minutes. In the summer of 1879, they remode led their first structure, erected in 1855. To this extra facilities we re added to those previously connected with the building, and the followi ng winter an office and scale-house were fitted up. They are now well situ ated and are doing a business second to none in the township. The first ye arly shipments of the firm were small compared to those of 1879, which we re 525,000 bushels of wheat; corn, 33,500; oats, 27,000 and flax, 2,500. J .D. Brecount has, during the past transactions, held the leading positi on of the firm. He now entrusts the business, principally, to the junior m embers of the firm, who are intelligent, bright and thorough going young m en. They are making an excellent reputation as good businessmen. J.D. Brec ount was born in Hamilton Co., Ohio, April 16, 1827, and is a son of Jo hn and Sarah (Williams) Brecount. In childhood, with their parents, they e migrated from New Jersey to Ohio on Flat-boats, locating where now the lim its of Cincinnati extend. Here John Brecount, when a lad of 14 years of ag e, engaged in blacksmithing, serving as apprentice until he was 21, when h is trade was completed. He did but little at this business during lif e; he was otherwise variously engaged, passing through the pioneer da ys of Hamilton Co., sharing many of the difficulties connected with the w as of 1812, of which he was a participant; in 1837, he and family became r esidents of Champagne Co., where John and Sarah remained until in feeble s tate of health, they came to Miami Co., to receive the care of their child ren, where they both passed away. Their children were twelve in numbe r, of whom three are now living; J.D., the only son, was brought up to agr iculture pursuits, and, in his early life, had limited school privilege s; he came to Miami Co. in the same year the grain business was opened; lo cating, with his brother, where the village is now built; at that ti me it was all in the woods; there he has since made and seen many change s, and his finances have much improved. Outside of his grain busines s, he owns 170 acres in Sec. 12, Brown Township, Miami Co., which is und er good cultivation and is well improved. March 27, 1849, he married Esth er A. White, who was born in Pennsylvania March 26, 1828; three sons are t he fruits of their union, viz., George W., Asa S. and Edgar A.

We will st ate in this connection that he was a great hunter, and paid for his land w ith the proceeds of furs taken from the game he killed. On his land were l ocated sulphur springs, which were noted by the Indians as containing medi cinal properties. The citizens of the forest often congregated here to he al their sick. They also indulged in shooting matches, generally selecti ng a spot in the vicinity of the spring. Upon Wilkinson's arrival, his ca sh possessions amounted to just $200 in silver. The money he secret ed in a stump near the springs. This stump was selected for a target by t he redskins during one of their expeditions. Mr Wilkinson was absent fr om home and Mrs W entertained fears that the money would be discovered a nd carried off by the \"sharp-shooters\", but fortunately her worst fears we re not realized. Six Indian families camped at this place on one occasio n, including a \"Big Medicine Man\" whose wonderful cures attracted the sett lers for miles around. On this farm was erected a block-house during the I ndian troubles. Wilkinson was on friendly relations with a number of the s avages, but was insecure from those unacquainted with him. The latter arra nged to attack the settlers in this neighborhood on a certain night. Wilk inson was apprised of this intended massacre by some of his dusky friend s, and with his neighbors and their families retreated to the fort. They r emained there for several days, but their cabins remained unmolested; t he intended attack had been abandoned by its projectors.\n\npg 458 Biographies of Early and Prominent Settlers. Asahel Wilkinson was born in Harrison Co, VA on September 16, 1776. Natu re had destined him for a hunter, as was seen by his constant trips to t he woods in search of game. When quite young he was married to Charity Rag en. Up the year 1811, their union had been blessed with four children- Wi lliam, Mary, Thomas and Joseph. Making a living in Virginia was at that ti me a difficult task, and the outlook for the future was dark and gloomy. \" Go to Ohio\", was the favorite cry of the Virginians, and a number did g o. Our friend Wilkinson had discussed the advisability of leaving his nat ive soil for a new home in the Northwest, with his better-half. Visio ns of a home and luxury in the beautiful Ohio forests flitted before hi m, while the barren hills of Virginia promised only poverty and desolati on for the future. In 1811, he came to a decision, and, accompanied by h is family and several neighboring families, started on his journey. A f ew days before they commenced their journey, one of their neighbors, wh o, with his family, intended to accompany them, became deranged with the t hought that they would come to want in their new home. His insanity beca me violent, and, in the dead of night, he murdered his wife and nine child ren. This did not deter the others, and , on the appointed day, they start ed, riding on pack-horses. Several of the saddles used on this occasion a re still in the possession of Wilkinson's descendants. When they came to O hio the families separated, Wilkinson coming to this county. He entered 2 60 acres of Section 14, in what is now called Adams Township, paying for t he land with proceeds obtained through the sale of furs. Of the four child ren who came with him, three have gone on that long journey from when ce no traveler returns. Joseph, the only surviving one, lives at Mechanics burg, in this county. Henry H, born April 2, 1813, was the first white ch id born in the township. Mrs Wilkinson died in 1819, and, in 1821, Wilkins on married Nancy James. Of the first marriage, but two children, Joseph a nd Betsy (now Mrs Cicso), are living, the later just north of Careysvill e. From the second union, Asahel and James remain, both owning extensive f arms in the township. During the first years of the township organizatio n, Wilkinson was elected Constable. This position he held for fourteen yea rs. By his death. which occurred February 23, 1861, Adams Township was ber eft of her first settler and one of her most influential citizens.\n\nPg 465 ....Mr Gershom Calland well remembers the shooting of a deer by Asahel Wil kinson, near his present residence, and the presentation of a portion of t he flesh to Calland's father, although it occurred fifty years ago.\n\nVeteran's of the War of 1812 and there was Asahel Wilkinson listed in Cap t.

Add itional details about the Conference will appear in the December Iss ue of the OGS Newsletter. If you are unable to attend, your certificate a nd medal will be mailed to you after the Conference.\n\nJohn G. Wilkinson may be eligible, but there appears to be a discrepancy in his date of birth. His death record places it at 1806, but he is not listed as one of the four children that accompanied Asahel to Ohio in 1811. His placement last in the list of heirs in the partition suit, which appears to be in birth order, would also contradict a birth in 1806. Charity Ragan would be eligible if she is proven to be John;s mother; however, this cannot be determined until John;s date of birth is established.\n\nThere is also confusion in the Arbogast biography. The biography names Susannah as the daughter of Peter, who is named as the son of Michael. But the letter from the \"grandson: names his grandfather as Peter, when the years would indicate he;s talking about Michael. Further documentati on must be submitted before this line can accepted.\n\nYou have until the end of the year for any further documentation to be considered for this year's group of inductees.

Wilkinson's age as 64. Which makes his birthdate 1806.\n\nOn a petition in Champaign County Ohio Common Pleas Ct. Chancery bk 30-3 77 Case 6292 lists the children - but I have to go back and check - but I do not think they are not listed in chronilogical age.\n\n[HI31066] (Research):The only thing lacking for the DAR is a legal documentation that ties Susa nnah to Peter (her father) and mother Sarah \"Henderson\" Arbogast. Beer 's History of Ohio has her listed as Peter's daughter, but the DAR will n ot accept county histories any more. Peter had no will and the distributi on of his goods did not list Susannah or John G. Wilkinson buying anythin g. I have searched for a solid year for some legal connection and many re searchers in Ohio did the same. Not one thing showed up. We spent da ys in Virginia looking for a birth record - church record etc., for Susann ah but came away with nothing. No question that she is not the daught er of Peter and Sarah Arbogast.
