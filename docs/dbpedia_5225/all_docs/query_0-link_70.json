But that Governor did not take into account the\n\nGermans and their influence in his State.

The first of these assumptions was that \"pure German'' is a language native to the soil of Germany and the natural product of the German people; the other, that the Pennsylvania-German dialect is a corruption of this pure language of the fatherland. Rev. Stibitz's remarks confirm the assertion made editorially in our November issue, that the Pennsylvania-German originally was as good and pure a dialect as any spoken in\n\nGermany. Ed.] Pure German is nowhere naturally spoken in Germany. It is always a language that has been directly or indirectly learned in the schools or from literature. There are as many dialects as there are petty kingdoms in Germany. These differ in some cases so much from each other as to be unintelligible to all who are not to the manner born. I have often found words and phrases in the speech of old Bavarians, Hessians and northern Germans in general, which I could not underAccording stand, though a German by birth. to a statement recently made to me by the pastor of one of the large German congregations\n\nin\n\nchurch\n\nPhiladelphia, find\n\nit\n\nthe\n\nnecessary\n\nto\n\nGermans use\n\nthe\n\nof\n\nhis literary be able\n\nlanguage of the homeland so as to Each has a to converse with each other.' language of his own wherein he was born, but this (the High German) they all had to learn as a part of their education.

It was the sentiment of grandmother's day that the boys must have several pieced quilts when they leave home, and the girls must see that they have their own pieced. This old-time handicraft, which had almost become a lost art, is becoming very popular again, and the handsome coverlets stored in the chest on the attic for years, as loving remembrances of by-gone days, can now again be brought forth to be of useful service and to replace the more modern successor, the machine-made spread which has held sway for many years. When we see the artistic designs and harmonious color blending that some of these spreads contain we look with admiration and often a little envy thereon, and realize that in spite oi the advanced ideas of the present generation, the old folks did know a thing or two in their day, and we must confess that grandmother's patchwork quilt is as- pretty and acceptable to us today as it was to her several decades ago. While it was one of her occupations thro' the long winter evenings, it was also a pastime for any idle hours of the day, and if there was a neighbor's call to be made she was likely to have a dozen or more of carefully cut .patches tucked under her arm which she took along to sew on while indulging in a little Xot always was she alone engaged social chat. in piecing, but very often the little seven-yearold tot, at her grandmother's knee, would take .\n\nAt a meeting of the executive committee oi Board of Foreign Missions, held in Lan-\n\nthe\n\ncaster, Pa.,\n\non January\n\nof Philadelphia, Pa., sionary nurse for the\n\nShe is a China. church, and has been in\n\nfor a number of years. rinding so capable\n\nin\n\n8.\n\nMiss Alice E.

The knowledge that a battle was fought is of less value than a knowledge of the causes that led to it and the issues resulting from it. can one understand the causes except he enter into sympathy with the masses involved? Or, how can he sympathize with their individual sufferings and with their manner of life and mode of thinking? know that a battle was fought the number and disposition oi the contending forces at what time and by whom the charges were made; the repulses, and all the details of the action are matters of record.

Northampton's Response. The Committee of Safety for the County of Northampton now passes its famous resolution which debars from participation in these armed forces now gathering, all persons possessing a knowledge of the manufacture of firearms. Among the Swiss and Palatine population of the vast territory then known as Northampton county were a great many who were gunsmiths and armorers, some of whom were descendants of the ancient armorers of the feudal period of Central Europe. These people brought with them to Pennsylvania the rifle, forty years or more before the Revolution and improved upon this German model with such ingenuity that up to within a few years oi this important event, they had produced a newtype of firearm, superior to any other in the\n\nworld\n\n— the\n\nAmerican\n\nbackwoods\n\nof the backthe anticipated pleasure of entering into the conflict, now\n\nriile.\n\nIt\n\nis\n\nthese artisans\n\nwoods who, being denied\n\nreturn to their workshop, to their homes.\n\nknowing\n\nLull\n\nwell that their efforts at their\n\nvocation will be of more importance than would be their services in the ranks.

Stephen Horn lived at Easton, put in several years at gun work and then took up that of powder making. Isaac Berlin and John Young, both from the upper end of the county, took up their residence in Easton about the time of agitation. Perlin's specialty was sword making. John Young was an armorer and an engraver or decorator. The decorations on Berlin's swords and on his own rifles were very artistic. He also decorated the guns for his brother Henry.

A coin, a penknife, a jewel, or a pebble, which has long been carried in the pocket or worn by any one. seems to become imbued with his or her personality, and is really one kind oi fairy-lore or superstitions. Then there is a symbolism oi a higher, more patriotic or sacred impulse, and perhaps the full value of which we do not understand.
