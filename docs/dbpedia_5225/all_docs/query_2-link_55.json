        "text": "Joseph C. Maddox\n\nJOSEPH C. MADDOX is a native of Chester Township, Wells County, Indiana,. born on the old Maddox homestead February 25, 1855, a son of Wesley Harvey and Eliza Ann (Grove) Maddox. He was reared on the home farm, receiving his education in the common schools of his township and at Bluffton. After leaving school he adopted the teacher's profession, which he followed principally for fifteen years, part of this time following the avocation of a farmer. He was united in marriage June 11, 1879, to Miss Elizabeth O. Dawson, who was also a native of Wells County, Indiana, a daughter of George Dawson, who is now living in Union City, Ohio. Mrs. Maddox lost her mother by death when she was but three years of age. Mr. and Mrs. Maddox are the parents of one child, a son named Hugh. Mr. Maddox discontinued teaching in 1884, and since that time has devoted his entire attention to farming, and has a well-cultivated farm in Chester Township. In his political views Mr. Maddox affiliates with the Republican party. He is an active and public-spirited citizen, and always takes an interest in every enterprise which has for its object the advancement of his township or county.\n\nBiographical and historical record of Adams and Wells counties, Indiana. Chicago: Lewis Publishing Co., 1887, pp. 805-806.\n\nJoseph C. G. Maddox\n\nFully three-quarters of a century have passed since the Maddox family invaded the wilderness of Chester Township in Wells County, and through the collective energies and resources of this one family many acres of wild land have been cleared, the fruits of the field have been gathered season after season, good homes have been established, families reared, and the name is identified with everything good and useful in the county. The life of Joseph C. G. Maddox has been in keeping with the record set by the family as a whole, and for a number of years he gave his services as an educator and for over thirty years has lived on the farm where he was born in Chester township. His home is on Rural Route No. 2 out of Keystone.\n\nMr. Maddox was born on his present farm February 25, 1855, a son of Wesley H. and Eliza A. (Groves) Maddox. His grandparents were Michael and Frances (Williams) Maddox, natives of Virginia and of about the time of the Revolution. Michael Maddox married for his first wife in Virginia Miss Fraley, by whom he was the father of ten children, and altogether he had eighteen children by two wives. In 1795, he removed to Adams County, Ohio, and still later to Highland County, where he married Frances Williams. In the fall of 1839 he removed with his family to Blackford County, Indiana, settling two miles east of Montpelier. He entered a hundred sixty acres in Section 11 of Harrison township of that county, cleared away a spot in the woods, built a log cabin, and remained a faithful worker and a public spirited resident of that community until his death on September 10, 1845.\n\nHe was a regular worshipper in the Methodist Episcopal faith. His widow moved out to Nebraska in 1866 and died in Richardson County of that state December 10, 1874. She was a very noble woman, deeply inclined to religious work, possessed a great deal of business-like and practical energy, and did well by all her children. These children, all of whom reached maturity, were Polly, Joseph C., Wesley H., William M., Wilson M., James J., Eliza A. and Sarah, all of whom are now deceased.\n\nWesley Harvey Maddox, father of Joseph C., was the founder of the family in Wells County and for many years one of its most highly esteemed citizens. He was born in Highland County, Ohio, September 2, 1821, and in 1837 at the age of sixteen came to Indiana and joined a brother in Randolph County. A little later he moved to Blackford County, where his parents subsequently joined him, and he was with them until after his father's death. In 1842 he and a half brother bought a hundred sixty acres of land in Section 36 of Chester Township, Wells County. It is said that his half brother gave a horse in payment of his share. Wesley H. Maddox did not have a dollar of capital, and he paid for the land by the proceeds of his hunting ability. He caught many coons and killed numerous deer, and in the course of two years had his eighty acres paid for. In 1845 he bought the eighty acres of his half brother. To pay for this he worked at wages of $10 a month or thereabouts for four years in Wayne, Fayette and Union counties. The first home on this farm was a log building 18 by 24 feet, erected by the first occupant, who had settled there in 1841.\n\nAfter coming to Wells County, Wesley H. Maddox became acquainted with the Groves family, and on November 8, 1849, married Eliza Ann Groves, oldest child of Thomas and Ann (Wilson) Groves. She was a native of Licking County, Ohio. Her parents came to Wells County, Indiana, in 1839, and it is said that they made their home under the wide spreading branches of an oak tree until their log cabin was completed. Thomas Groves, a son of Robert and Susanna Groves, was one of four brothers, Thomas, George, Joseph and Lewis, all of whom came to Wells county and settled near Poneto. Joseph Groves set aside a portion of his farm for a cemetery, and Susanna Groves, who died in 1840, was the first person buried there. Eliza A. Groves was teacher of the first school in Chester Township, and was a woman of much culture and thorough education. She died May 9, 1874. Wesley H. Maddox and wife settled on their farm two weeks after their marriage. Their land was in the midst of the heavy timber, only one acre had been cleared, and their joint possessions consisted of a bedstead, a few dishes, two cows and two colts. Mr. Maddox soon made a table out of black walnut, and that was one of his prized possessions for many years, and is now owned by Joseph C. G. Maddox. Wesley Maddox made a living from his farm and from his prowess as a hunter, and his property and prosperity increased until at one time he owned over 300 acres, with more than 200 acres in cultivation. He became a republican upon the organization of the party, and filled various places of trust, including that of township trustee. He and his wife had eight children, seven of whom grew to maturity: Leander E., who became a physician and married Mary E. Newman; Frances A., who married George W. Leach, and she lost her life in the terrible Iroquois Theater fire in Chicago in 1903, her daughter, Estella, who was with her at the time, being one of the few who escaped; Joseph C. G., next in age; William M., who married Alice Tribell; Sara E., wife of Amaziah Shields; Wesley H., Jr., who married Lulu Shields; and Laura Belle, wife of John E. Markley.\n\nJoseph C. G. Maddox grew up on the old homestead, acquired his early education in the district schools and at Bluffton, and qualifying as a teacher he spent the greater part of his time for fifteen years in that work. On June 11, 1879, he married Miss Elizabeth O. Dawson, who was born in Nottingham Township of Wells County, and was educated in the common schools. She was only three years of age when her mother died, and her father was George Dawson. After their marriage Mr. and Mrs. Maddox began keeping house a half mile east of Keystone, but in 1884 he gave up teaching and has since devoted his entire attention to looking after his well cultivated farm in Chester Township. He owns 240 acres, and in addition to building up this fine estate has ample provision for his children in the way of making a good home and giving them a liberal education. Mr. Maddox is a republican in politics and is always ready with his support for any movement that would benefit the community.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Maddox have three children, Hugh G., Chella D., and J. Glenn. The oldest, Hugh G., was educated in the common schools at Keystone, in the Montpelier High School, and took the law course at the State University, graduating LL. B. in 1908. He is now on the farm with his father. He married Carrie B. Steele of Bloomington, Indiana, and has one child, Geraldine, born May 3, 1908. Mrs. Hugh G. Maddox died February 25, 1918. Chella D., the second child of Mr. and Mrs. Maddox, is a graduate of the Keystone and Montpelier schools and was awarded the degree Master of Arts by the Indiana State University. She is now the wife of Howard W. Strait, and they live in Chester Township and have two bright young children, J. Lowell and Elizabeth. J. Glenn, the youngest child, is a graduate of the Keystone High school, and married Shirley A. Gaiser. Their two children are Gaiser and Eulonda.\n\nStandard History of Adams and Wells Counties Indiana. John W Tyndall for Adams Co and O. E. Lesh for Wells County.

MADDOX, M. D., of Keystone, was born in Chester Township this county, May 11, 1851, son of Wesley H. and Eliza Ann (Grove) Maddox. His father was born in Highland County, Ohio, of English descent, and his mother was born in Fairfield County, same State, her parents being early settlers in that county. Both came to Indiana with their parents when young, the parents of the father settling in Harrison Township, Blackford County, and those of the mother, in Harrison Township, Wells County. Both families found their land covered with a heavy growth of timber, and both started to make clearings and erect necessary buildings. Wesley H. bought land in Chester Township, section 36, about 1845 or 1846, and in 1849 he was married. He is still a resident of the township, but his wife died May 9, 1874. Leander E. was reared in Chester Township, and has always made that township his home with the exception of six years' residence in Newville. He commenced his education in the common school at the Maddux schoolhouse, section 36, Chester Township, and at the age of fifteen years commenced attending the school of Professor J. S. McCleary, where he studied three or four terms, He then went to Liber College, Jay County, and attended there two years. In 1871 he commenced the study of medicine with Dr. Doster, of Poneto, and attended the medical department of the Michigan State University, at Ann Arbor, 1873-'74-'75, graduating the last Wednesday of March, 1875. He then went to Vera Cruz and commenced the practice of his profession. In 1881 he settled in Keystone, where he has since practiced, and he is the only physician in Chester Township. He was married August 20, 1871, to Miss Mary E. Newman, a native of Huntington County, this State, and daughter of John and Lydia Newman. They have two children-Myrtie and Katie. Politically the doctor is a Republican. He is a member of Bluffton Lodge, No. 142, A. F. & A. M. H is mother was the first school-teacher in Chester Township, and the first lady teacher in Wells County.\n\nBiographical and historical record of Adams and Wells counties, Indiana. Chicago: Lewis Publishing Co., 1887, p. 738.\n\nWesley Harvey Maddox\n\nWesley Harvey Maddox, retired farmer, residing in Chester Township, was born in Highland County, Ohio, September 2, 1821, a son of Michael and Frances (Williams) Maddox, natives of Virginia, and of English and Scotch descent respectively. His paternal ancestors came to America about the time of the Revolutionary war. Michael Maddox was twice married. He was first married in Virginia to a lady by the name of Fraley, by whom he had ten children. After his marriage he came, in 1795, to Adams County, Ohio, and later removed to Highland County, where his wife died. He was then married in Highland County, to Frances Williams, and in the fall of 1839 he removed with his family to Blackford County, Indiana, where he lived until his death September 10, 1845. In 1866 his widow went to Nebraska and died in Richardson County, that State, December 10, 1874.\n\nWesley H. Maddox, the subject of this sketch, was reared till his sixteenth year in Highland County, when, in 1837, he came to Indiana, having a brother in Winchester, Randolph County, with whom he remained from February till the following April, when he came to Blackford County, and after his parents came to that county, he made his home with them until after his father's death. In 1842 he and a half brother bought 160 acres of land on section 36, Chester Township, his half-brother giving a horse in payment for his share. At that time he had not a dollar, but at once set to work hunting coon and deer, and at the close of the year 1844 had his eighty acres paid for, and in 1845 he purchased the eighty acres belonging to his half-brother, when he went to Wayne County and began working for $10 per month. After working four years in Wayne, Fayette and Union counties he had paid for his land, besides making a trip home every year, and going to Bluffton to pay his taxes. A log house, 18 x 24 feet, had been built on his land by the former owner, who had settled here in 1841.\n\nMr. Maddox was married November 8, 1849, and on the 22d of November he and his wife settled into place. It was then wild timber with only an acre cleared, and their joint possessions consisted of a bedstead, a few dishes, two cows and two colts, but Mr. Maddox soon made a table out of black walnut, which he still has in his possession. He had been quite a hunter from the time he came to Indiana until he settled on his land, and from that time devoted his time to clearing and improving his place, remaining there until he moved to his present farm on section 24 of the same township, and from his small beginning he has accumulated 328 acres of land, of which about 218 acres have been cleared. Mrs. Maddox was formerly Miss Eliza Ann Grove. She was born in the state of Ohio, a daughter of Thomas and Ann Grove, who came to Wells County, Indiana, in 1839, living in this county until their death. Eight children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Maddox, of whom seven are living--Leander E. (a physician), Mrs. Francis M. Leech, Joseph Collins, William McKendree, Sara Ellen (wife of Amaziah Shields), Wesley Harvey, and Laura Belle. Thomas is deceased. Mrs. Maddox died May 9, 1874. In politics Mr. Maddox has been a Republican since the organization of that party. He has held among other local offices that of township trustee. He takes an active interest in the affairs of his township, and in the advancement of the cause of education, and has given his children good educational advantages. His wife taught the first school in Chester Township, on the land now owned by John Graves. Mr. Maddox has experienced the privations as well as the pleasures of pioneer life, and has witnessed the surrounding county change from a state of nature into well cultivated fields and thriving towns and villages.\n\nBiographical and historical record of Adams and Wells counties, Indiana.

Mann\n\nHenry A. Mann was born in Monroe county, West Virginia, July 8, 1828. His father, Michael Mann, was born in Virginia, August 12, 1795, his father being Jacob Mann, a native of Germany. The maternal parent of the subject, Cynthia (Walker) Mann, was also a native of Virginia, born January 5, 1797. The parents of the subject were married March 14, 1816, and settled on a farm in Virginia, where the father engaged in farming, also conducting the business of blacksmithing. In 1833 they came to Henry county, Indiana, entering land in the new country where the wife died September 30, 1871. Michael afterward married a second wife, who died prior to his own death, which occurred at Rensselaer, Indiana, December 21, 1889. Michael Mann was the father of the following children: Jacob C., born July 20, 1821, a resident of Howard county, Indiana; Christopher D., born December 11, 1830, now a resident of Marion, Indiana; Henry A.; Clayton W., born June 29, 1819; Marinda, born July 5, 1823; Leroy, born March 7, 1826; Lucinda C., born October 6, 1833.\n\nHenry A. Mann attended the district schools of Henry county until he was about eighteen years of age, but at that period of time the terms of school were very brief and the most of his time until that age was spent in assisting his father until January 3, 1856, at which time he married Martha Allen, a daughter of William and Sarah (Prathee) Allen, the father a native of North Carolina, born September 7, 1798, and the mother a native of Virginia, born October 8, 1806. William Allen was a son of Reuben Allen, also a native of North Carolina. William and Sarah Allen were married October 19, 1826, in Wayne county, Indiana, where they settled, remaining there for a time. They then removed to Madison county, Indiana, where they lived the remainder of their lives. William was the father of eight children, four of whom are yet living: James, born July 30, 1827, died February 15, 1893; Thomas C., born September 10, 1829, died November 11, 1854; Martha, born October 16, 1831, the wife of the subject; W. A., born in March, 1834, a physician now practicing in Rochester, Minnesota; Jonathan P., born August 12, 1837, died January 5, 1862, of disease contracted in the army; Benjamin F., born February 6, 1840, now a dentist in Glencoe, Minnesota; Mary E., born November 16, 1842, died September 19, 1845, and Rachel, born December 15, 1846, now the wife of C. W. Wymant, of Danville, Indiana. The subject, after his marriage, settled in Henry county, Indiana, renting a farm for a period of three years. He then removed to Wells county, settling in Nottingham township, purchasing one hundred acres of land, which he cleared and brought under cultivation. After remaining on this farm seventeen years, he purchased eighty acres, where he now lives, also clearing the greater part of this place. The subject now owns one hundred and eighty acres of fine farming land and, besides being a general stock farmer, is one of the four stockholders interested in the grain elevator at Poneto, Wells county.\n\nMr. Mann is the father of two children, one of whom is yet living; Emma, born August 16, 1857, died September 2, 1850; James M., born April 15, 1860, married Sarah Stahl, and is now a resident of Nottingham township, and is the father of one child, Lillie. The subject and family are connected with the Baptist church, of which he has been a clerk for thirty-one years and a deacon for about thirteen years. He answered his country's call during the great Rebellion, enlisting in the army on October 16, 1864, in Company K, Fifty-third Regiment Indiana Volunteers, and served until the close of the war. While the husband was absent in the army serving his country, his wife was left alone on the farm with her little son, then five years old. Owing to the absence of nearly all the men in the army she did her own plowing, but she says that her old horse knew more about the business than she did herself.\n\nIn politics the subject of this sketch has been a Republican all his life, and, as in all the relations of life, he has performed his civic duties from conscientious mtovies of duty, and when he is convinced that he is right is hard to swerve from his course. He is a type of the solid, resonsible yeomanry of our state, possessing all the traits of economic thright and industry possessed by the German people.\n\nBiographical Memoirs of Wells County, Indiana.

During that year he was married to Miss Hannah, daughter of Solomon Tuttle, who was born in Athens County, Ohio, March 30, 1818. One year after marriage Mr. and Mrs. Markley immigrated to Wells County, this State, which was then a dense wilderness. Here he entered seventy-two acres of land from the Government on section 18, Harrison Township, on the Wabash River. There were then only four white families in that part of the county. He erected a cabin and began to clear and improve a farm. By industry and good management, he added to his original purchase from time to time, until he owned a landed estate of eleven hundred acres, most of which was in a state of cultivation. Mr. and Mrs. Markley passed through all the usual hardships of pioneer life. When he first arrived here his property consisted of a horse and a cow; the latter died soon after reaching here.

MARKLEY, of the firm of Markley and Son at Bluffton, is one of a number of successful men of the Markley name who from pioneer times to the present have been identified with Wells County. The history of his branch of the Markley family in Wells County goes back to his grandfather, Gabriel Markley, who was born in Maryland January 11, 1814, a son of Jonathon Markley, a native of the same state. When he was three years of age his parents moved to Pennsylvania, and later to Madison County, Ohio. In 1836 Gabriel Markley married Hannah TUTTLE, who was born in Athens County, Ohio, March 30, 1818, a daughter of Soloman Tuttle. In 1837, Gabriel Markley and wife came to Wells County, Indiana, which was then completely covered with woods and all the wilderness nature. He had a farm in section 18 of Harrison Township, along the Wabash River. Only four white families were to be found in that part of the county. He and his wife endured many privations, but their outlook was promising, and in the course of time Gabriel Markley was the owner of some 1,100 acres of land. It is said that his property when he first arrived in Wells County consisted only of a horse and a cow, and the latter died soon after they came to the county. Gabriel Markley and wife had 12 children. They were active members of the Christian Church. Gabriel Markley died June 12, 1873, and his wife on March 30, 1883.\n\nJonathan Markley, father of the Bluffton Merchant, was born in Wells County June 4, 1838, soon after his parents arrived in this wilderness. For many years he enjoyed the distinction of being the oldest living white person in Wells County. He had to be satisfied with such education as was obtainable in the old subscription schools taught in a log cabin. On December 21, 1858, he married Miss Catherine STURGIS, daughter of Thomas and Elizabeth (BRASIER) Sturgis. Following his marriage he worked a farm near the old homestead for several years, continued farming at Newville until the spring of 1882, when he returned to Harrison Township and acquired 160 acres of land which he brought under a high state of cultivation. The years brought him prosperity and the honor paid to a useful citizen, and death came to him in his seventy-ninth year on April 28, 1917. He and his wife were active members of the Six Mile Christian Church and in politics he was a prohibitionist. He and his wife had thirteen children, and eight of the sons and two of the daughters are still living.\n\nOne of them was George F. Markley, who was born in Harrison Township of Wells County February 5, 1861. The farm, rural environment and country schools offered the chief experiences of George F. Markley during his boyhood. After work in the County Normal he was qualified as a teacher and he continued teaching in the winter and farming in the summer until he came to Bluffton and engaged in the grocery business in 1893. His store was on Market Street for two years, until it was burned out, and he then moved to Main Street and in 1899 came to his present location at 222 West Market. In 1902 the firm became Markley & Son, and they have long been among the leading purveyors of high class provisions in Bluffton.\n\nMr. Markley married for his wife Ellen ARNOLD, who died in 1888. Their three children were Jessie, Vernon C. and Augusta. They were all educated in the Bluffton public schools. In 1893 Mr. Markley married Lillian GETTLE, who was born in Bluffton, daughter of Sarah Gettle. Mr. & Mrs. Markley have four children: Harold, who is a graduate of Bluffton High School, is married and is now connected with the Leader Company Store at Bluffton; Paul, a graduate of the high school, who has enlisted in the army and is now serving in the United States at Fort Dupont, Delaware; Edna is the wife of Claude FARLING; Herman completed the course of the Bluffton High School in 1917. The family are active members of the Methodist Episcopal Church and Mr. Markley is a member of its official board. Fraternally he is identified with Bluffton Lodge No. 114 of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, is a past noble grand of the lodge, and belongs to both the Encampment and Canton of Odd Fellowship. Mr. Markley is an active democrat, but his chief public service has been rendered to the public schools of Bluffton. For twelve years he was a member of the board, three years its secretary, was treasurer six years and president three years.\n\nStandard History of Adams and Wells Counties Indiana.

His wife, who in her maidenhood bore the name of Melinda WILSON, was born in Madison county, Ohio, January 12, 1816, and died April 20, 1888. John Markley remained upon the home farm during his boyhood, assisting his father in the clearing and development of the land, receiving in the meantime but little education. On the 2d of March, 1834, he was married to Melinda Wilson, the daughter of Valentine Wilson, reputed to be the wealthiest man in Madison county, Ohio. In 1835, accompanied by his young wife and his brother Gabriel and wife, he emigrated to Wells county, Indiana, and located on the north bank of the Wabash river, five miles above where the city of Bluffton now stands. He entered there two hundred acres of land and proceeded at once to the task of clearing and developing it. He at first erected a rude log cabin, in which they made their home for a number of years and in which the subject was born. Subsequently Mr. Markley was enabled to purchase five hundred acres of additional land, which he cultivated with marked success for a number of years. Healways followed the pursuit of farming, in which he was prosperous, was honorable and straightforward in his intercourse with his fellow men and enjoyed the respect and esteem of a large circle of friends and acquaintances. When he first went to that locality there were not enough settlers there to fill a jury and officer a court. In politics he was a Republican and took a keen and active interest in all things affecting the interests of his county.

He participated in many hard fought battles. Among the most prominent were the battles of Chickamauga, Atlanta, and with Sherman to the sea. During the fight at Chickamauga he received a wound from a ball passing across his breast, which disabled him from active duty for about two months. While following Morgan's troops he met with a narrow escape from the rebel prisons; he was captured, and released the same night. After serving three years he was honorably discharged June 19, 1865, at Louisville, Kentucky. He was married October 24, 1867, to Miss Araminta, daughter of David and Catherine (Gates) Powell, the former a native of Hancock County, Maryland, and the latter of Belmont County, Ohio.

MARKLEY is a native of Wells County, Indiana, born in Harrison Township, March 7, 1839. His parents, John and Melinda (Wilson) Markley, were natives of Maryland and Ohio respectively, the father born near Baltimore March 10, 1809, and reared in Pennsylvania, and the mother born January 12, 1816. They were married in Madison County, Ohio, and to them were born eleven children, eight of whom grew to maturity, their names in order of their birth being as follows: Mrs. Rachel Adsit, living in Iroquois County, Illinois; Jonathan J., the subject of this sketch; William D., residing in Wells County; Mrs. Ellen J. Studabaker, of Wells County; Mrs. Tillie J. Sturgis, of Bluffton; Lewis P., of Greene County, Ohio; Samuel T., of Clinton County, Indiana, and Wilson A., living on the old homestead in Harrison Township. The parents were pioneer settlers of Wells County, settling in the wilderness of Harrison Township in February, 1837, about two years after their marriage. The father died on his pioneer homestead in 1869. He came to the county a poor man, but by industry and frugality he accumulated a large property, leaving at his death about 700 acres of land besides considerable personal property. He was a man of sterling character, and one whose word was considered as good as his bond, and was held in high esteem by all who knew him. In politics he was formerly a Whig, and later a Republican. For about twenty years previous to his death he was a consistent member of the Christian church. The widowed mother still resides on the old homestead in Harrison Township with her son Wilson.\n\nRev. Jonathan J. Markley, the subject of this sketch, has spent most of his life in Wells county, receiving his early education in the common schools of the county. He was a student at Liber College in Jay County, and later attended the Union Christian College in Sullivan County, Indiana, finishing his studies when twenty-eight years of age. In 1865 he united with the Christian church, and from that time has devoted himself to the cause of the Master. He commenced his ministerial work in 1869, and was ordained in 1872. Since 1869 he has had charge of the Christian church at Murray. Mr. Markley was united in marriage, January 18, 1871, to Miss Mary Hoffman, who was born in Montgomery County, Ohio, August 18, 1840, a daughter of Philip Hoffman, of Wells County. Immediately after his marriage Mr. Markley made his home on section 19, Lancaster Township, near his present residence, and is still living in that section. He owns a fine farm property containing 210 acres, which is under a good state of cultivation. In politics Mr. Markley is a Republican. He is an active temperance worker, and in sympathy with prohibition.\n\nBiographical and historical record of Adams and Wells counties, Indiana. Chicago: Lewis Publishing Co., 1887, pp. 674-675.\n\nJonathan J. Markley - 1903\n\nEach business or calling if honorable, has its place in human existence, constituting a part of the plan whereby lifeâs methods are pursued and man reaches his ultimate destiny. Emerson said that \"All are needed by each one.\" And that is as true in one avenue of lifeâs activities as in another. However, the importance of a business or profession is in a very large measure determined by its beneficence or usefulness. So dependent is man upon his fellow men that the worth of each individual is largely reckoned by what he has done for humanity. There is no class to whom greater gratitude is due than to those self-sacrificing, sympathetic, noble-minded men whose life work has been the elevation of their fellow men to a higher conception of God, their duty to him and their duty to their fellow men. There is no known standard by which their beneficent influence can be measured, but it is certainly safe to say that to no class of men in the country today indebted for the present high moral and spiritual standard of the community in as large a degree as to the early ministers of the gospel, those earnest and consecrated men who, disregarding personal comfort, spread abroad a knowledge of the Christ and taught the great truths of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. The subject of this sketch for many years labored faithfully in the cause of the Master and by a long life of earnest and self-denying toil accomplished great good in this community and now possesses the confidence and respect of all who know him. Because of the prominent part he took in the development of this region he is justly entitled to representation in a volume of this character.\n\nThe first ancestor of the subject of whom anything definite is now known was his great-grandfather, probably Gabriel Markley by name, who was driven by religious persecution from Holland in the year 1720. With a number of his fellow countrymen, he emigrated to America and settled first in Maryland. His son, Jonathan Markley, grandfather of the subject was born in Maryland in 1760. In 1815 he emigrated to Pennsylvania and after residing there a few years went to Madison county, Ohio, where he remained until his death. The subjectâs father, John Markley, was born near the city of Baltimore, Maryland, March 10, 1809, and died December 19, 1870. His wife, who in her maidenhood bore the name of Melinda WILSON, was born in Madison county, Ohio, January 12, 1816, and died April 20, 1888. John Markley remained upon the home farm during his boyhood, assisting his father in the clearing and development of the land, receiving in the meantime but little education. On the 2d of March, 1834, he was married to Melinda Wilson, the daughter of Valentine Wilson, reputed to be the wealthiest man in Madison county, Ohio. In 1835, accompanied by his young wife and his brother Gabriel and wife, he emigrated to Wells county, Indiana, and located on the north bank of the Wabash river, five miles above where the city of Bluffton now stands. He entered there two hundred acres of land and proceeded at once to the task of clearing and developing it. He at first erected a rude log cabin, in which they made their home for a number of years and in which the subject was born. Subsequently Mr. Markley was enabled to purchase five hundred acres of additional land, which he cultivated with marked success for a number of years. He always followed the pursuit of farming, in which he was prosperous, was honorable and straightforward in his intercourse with his fellow men and enjoyed the respect and esteem of a large circle of friends and acquaintances. When he first went to that locality there were not enough settlers there to fill a jury and officer a court. In politics he was a Republican and took a keen and active interest in all things affecting the interests of his county. He and his wife were members of the Christian church and were consistent and faithful in the performance of their religious duties, bringing up their children in the light of the gospel and of their own examples. They were the parents of eleven children, briefly mentioned as follows: Valentine is deceased; Rachael Ann is the wife of Stephen ADSIT, of Hoopeston, Illinois; Jonathan J. is the subject; William D. live at Vera Cruz, Harrison township, this county; Hester is deceased; Matilda J. is the wife of CAPT. E. Y. STURGIS, of Bluffton; Amanda, deceased; Ellen is deceased; Louis P. lives at Vera Cruz, this county; Samuel T. resides at Elwood, Indiana, and Wilson A., of Harrison township, this county.\n\nJonathan J. Markley, the immediate subject of this biographical sketch, was born in Harrison township, Wells county, Indiana, on the 7th of March, 1839, his birth taking place in the little log cabin which his father first erected on the clearing he had made there. The subject remained at home until he attained his majority, faithfully assisting his father in the arduous task of clearing the land and cultivating the soil, and developing at the same time that strength of body and those sturdy qualities of character which served him so well in the after years of his life. During his teens he received the advantages of such mental training as was to be obtained in the common schools of the neighborhood. Not being satisfied with such education as he had received, after attaining his majority he secured a position as teacher in the schools of Vera Cruz, holding this position for three years and also teaching one year in another school. In this way he earned enough money to enable him to enter Liber College in Jay county, this state, where he spent three years in earnest study. During his attendance at college he found it necessary to work out on Saturdays and in evenings in order to defray his expenses. He selected his studies with a view of entering the ministry and all his ambitions and efforts were centered upon that purpose. Upon leaving college he returned home, but after remaining there about two years he, in 1871, came to Lancaster township and occupied forty acres of land which he had previously purchased. He was a member of the Christian church and in 1869 he began preaching, his first charge being the Christian Church at Murray, Lancaster township. That his services in the capacity of a pastor and minister of the gospel were satisfactory is evidenced by the fact that he was retained in this one charge for the remarkably long period of thirty-one years, a period in which his influence in the community was constantly manifest and acknowledged by all who were conversant with his labors. In 1900 Mr. Markley resigned his ministerial work and retired from active pastorate, much to the regret of many who had sat under his preaching and been the recipients of his ministrations. During this long pastorate he labored earnestly and indefatigably for the uplifting of those with whom he came in contact and by an exemplary life influenced many to turn from sin and follow the teachings of the Nazarene.\n\nIn 1898 Mr. Markley erected a handsome large brick house and in 1900 he erected a fine new barn, being now the owner of one of the finest pieces of farm property in Wells county. From the original tract of forty acres he has, by thrift, economy and enterprise, been enabled to increase his holdings to two hundred and forty acres of as good land as can be found in Wells county. Mr. Markley enjoys the distinction of being one of the oldest ministers in the county and also of having married more couples and preached more sermons than any other preacher in the county. In politics he has been a lifelong Republican and has always taken a keen interest in the trend of public events, though at no time an aspirant for public office. A bit of early history is connected with Mr. Markleyâs home in the fact that where his house now stands occurred the first marriage ceremony performed in the county, a minister from Ft. Wayne officiating. The couple then married are yet living at Buena Vista, the wife having celebrated her eighty-fourth birthday during the first week in July, 1902. Another noteworthy fact is that Mr. Markley officiated at the funerals of eight of his neighbors within two years, all residing within sight of his home and their aggregate ages being six hundred and forty-three years.\n\nOn the 18th of January, 1871, Mr. Markley was united in the holy bonds of matrimony with Miss Mary M. HUFFMAN, who was born August 18, 1840, the daughter of Philip and Margarite Huffman, of Bluffton. This union has been a most happy and congenial one and in many ways Mrs. Markley has proven her devotion and faithfulness to her husbandâs best interests. A devout and consecrated Christian, she has always so lived as to cast no discredit upon the religion which she professes and by her many acts of charity and kindliness has endeared herself to a host of warm and loyal friends.\n\nBiographical Memoirs of Wells County, Indiana. B.F. Bowen, Logansport, Indiana, 1903, pp. 447-448.\n\nTranscribed by Colleen Rutledge\n\nMartha (Wallace) Markley\n\nWholly devoted to home and domestic duties, doing through all the best years of her life the sacred work that comes within her sphere, there is not much to record concerning the life of the average woman. And yet what station so dignified, what relation so loving and endearing, what office so holy, tender and ennobling as those of the home-making wife and mother? A celebrated writer has said that the future destiny of a nation depended upon its wives and mothers. In a biographical compendium such as this, woman should have no insignificant representation. As manâs equal in many respects, and even his superior in the gentle, tender and loving amenities of life, she fully merits a much larger notice than she ordinarily receives. The foregoing was suggested after a perusal of the leading facts in the career of the worthy and respected lady whose name forms the caption to this article, a lady who has done well her part and whose career has been a simple, but beautiful poem of rugged, toilsome duty faithfully and uncomplainingly performed as maiden, wife and mother.\n\nMrs. Martha Markley, widow of the late Jacob B. Markley, is a daughter of Samuel and Susan (Jackson) Wallace, and was born in Rock Creek township this county, on the 12th of April, 1852. Samuel Wallace was a native of Ireland and in that country was reared and educated. He remained there until he was twenty-eight years old, when, in 1833, he came to America, where he believed better opportunities existed. He landed in Philadelphia, where he worked as a laborer for a short time, and about 1837 came to Wells county and entered a tract of land in Rock Creek township. The land was wild and unimproved, but he was strong, energetic and ambitious and in course of time succeeded in creating for himself a comfortable home and a valuable farm. He was united in marriage, in 1840, with Miss Susan Jackson, a native of North Carolina, but whose parents were among the first settlers in Liberty township, this county. To them were born thirteen children as follows: Fannie, Rachael, Anna, James, David, Elizabeth, Catherine, Martha, Mary, Thomas, Matthew, Finley, and one that died in infancy unnamed. Samuel Wallace was a firm and uncompromising Republican in politics and in religious belief was a Presbyterian.\n\nMartha Wallace was early taught the lessons of successful housekeeping, growing into a well developed and graceful womanhood, and was given the advantages of as good an education as the schools of that day afforded. On the 24th of April, 1872, she was united in marriage with Jacob B. Markley, who was a resident of Harrison township, though born in Ohio and coming to Wells county in 1864. To this union were born the following children: Arthur Wallace married Anna Markley and resides in Lancaster township; Bessie Florence, who was educated in the Northern Indiana Normal School and subsequently taught four terms. She became the wife of Archie Norton and resides in Winters, Michigan; Lora Jane attended the normal schools at Danville and Valparaiso and then taught three terms of school at Newville, Indiana; she was married April 1, 1902, to Arlie Thompson and now resides in Ft. Wayne, Indiana; Carl Boyd; Ruth Agnes. Mr. Markley was a stanch Republican and took a keen interest in the trend of passing events. He was a man of more than ordinary energy, sound judgment and superior business abilities, and as a farmer took high rank, being regarded as an up-to-date agriculturist, a man of broad intelligence and a leader in enterprises for the general prosperity of the community.\n\nSince her husbandâs death Mrs. Markley has manifested business abilities of a high order in the management of the estate. She is of a sincerely religious nature, belonging, with her children, to the Presbyterian church, and her life has abounded in good works in the church and among the deserving poor in the world outside. She is held in the highest esteem and numbers warm-hearted friends by the score in the community where she has spent so many years. She has experienced many of lifeâs vicissitudes, and sorrows, but she has also enjoyed many of its triumphs and is now surrounded by those who have long known and respected her.\n\nBiographical Memoirs of Wells County, Indiana. B.F. Bowen, Logansport, Indiana, 1903, pp. 517.\n\nTranscribed by Colleen Rutledge\n\nWilliam D. Markley\n\nAmong the prosperous native-born farmers of Harrison township, Wells county, Indiana, William D. Markley stands most prominent. He is a son of John and Malinda (Wilson) Markley, was born April 25, 1841, and Harrison township has always been his place of residence.\n\nJohn Markley, the father of William D., came from Madison county, Ohio, to Wells county, Indiana, in 1836, and entered one hundred and eighty-five acres of forest land in section 18, Harrison township, where there had about half a dozen settlers preceded him, including Dan and Adam Miller, Thomas Van Horn and Higgins Gentry. Mr. Markley put up the inevitable log cabin for temporary shelter and set resolutely to work to clear up a farm, or rather to clear off the heavy timber surrounding his cabin. He added gradually to his possessions until he owned about six hundred acres, but continued to make a dwelling of his original cabin the remainder of his life. He was a fiery public-spirited gentleman and did all his means would allow in assisting financially the making of public improvements. He was well known throughout the county of Wells, although a quiet, unassuming man, and was recognized as a useful citizen and a good neighbor, being deeply mourned at his death, which took place in the faith of the Christian church, and his name is still kept green in the memory of his surviving relatives and friends. In politics he was a Republican, but never was officious or intermeddling in forcing his views upon others, and as a farmer was one of the most successful stock raisers in his township. To John and Malinda (Wilson) Markley were born eleven children, of whom eight grew to maturity, namely: Rachel, now the wife of Stephen Adsit; Rev. J. J., of Lancaster township; William D., with whose name this biographical record opens; Ellen, widow of Ben Studabaker; Matilda, married to Capt. E. Y. Sturgis; Lewis P., of this township; Samuel, of Elwood, Indiana; Wilson, still in this township.\n\nWilliam D. Markley was reared to farming on the old homestead, but was given an opportunity to attend school three months each year until he was eighteen years old. He was quite apt at his studies and on relinquishing these engaged in teaching school in Wells county until he was twenty-three years of age, when, in 1864, he married Miss Mary E. Dougherty, a native of Darke county, Ohio, and a daughter of William and Margaret (Studabaker) Dougherty, as well as a sister of the Hon. Hugh Dougherty. To the marriage of W. D. and Mary E. Markley were born five children, viz: Cora, who was a teacher in Wells county for several terms and was then married to Jules Meredith; Franklin, deceased; Carrie, wife of Earnest Morrow; Anna, married to Arthur Markley, and Jane, wife of Gus Baker. Mrs. Mary E. (Dougherty) Markley was called from earth in 1884, and Mr. Markley chose for a second helpmate Margaret Dellinger, whom he married in November, 1891, and this union has been brightened by the birth of one child, Marie, born June 27, 1895.\n\nMr. Markley is a member of the Christian church at Six Mile and is also one of the trustees. He is very active in his church work, contributes liberally toward its support and maintenance and lives strictly up to its teachings. In politics Mr. Markley is a stanch Republican in principle, but seldom takes an active part in advancing the interests of the party, excepting in the way of regularly casting his vote in its favor, as he has never felt any desire for holding a public office, although he is very popular in his township and he and family are among the most prominent and respected residents of Wells county and Harrison township.\n\nBiographical Memoirs of Wells County, Indiana.

MARSH, farmer, Washington Town ship, was born in Muskingum County, Ohio, February 28, 1837, son of Alexander and Margaret (Stanley) Marsh, the former a native of Coshocton County, Ohio, and the latter of Virginia. In 1852 the family removed to Indiana and located in Nottingham Township, this county, where the father died the same year. The mother now resides in Bluffton. Our subject was reared to the age of fifteen years in his native county, and has followed farming ever since coming to Wells County. He has owned his present farm, consisting of eighty acres of land, since 1879. He was married in this county, April 8, 1859, to Miss Nancy Heller, born in Wells County, whose parents came from Franklin County, Pennsylvania, and both parents died in this county in 1884. To this union were born fourteen children, of whom two, Oliver and Noah, are deceased. Those living areâJohn Wesley, justice of the peace of Nottingham Township; George Washington, William Alexander; Eliza Ann, wife of Dan Bashaw, residing in Allen County; Amanda, wife of William R. Schooley; Jacob, of Salina, Ohio; Emma E., wife of Jacob Reinhardt, residing in Blackford County; Mary C., Lewis Edwin, Fred Lee, Elmer and Norah Alice. Politically Mr. Marsh is a Democrat, and has held the office of constable. He is a member of the Lutheran church, as is also his wife, and he served as elder in that church for several years.\n\nBiographical and historical record of Adams and Wells counties, Indiana.

MARTIN, attorney at law was born at Whitestown, Butler County, Pennsylvania, on March 23, 1847, on his father's farm, his parents being John and Eveline W. Martin, both of whom were natives of Pennsylvania, of Scotch-Irish descent. At the age of twelve years, within a common-school education, Mr. Martin began and took a course of several terms in the Witherspoon Institute, at Butler, Pennsylvania. On July 3, 1863, he enlisted in Company I, Fifty-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteer Militia, assisting in the capture of General John Morgan and his command, near Salineville, Ohio. On February 22, 1865, he enlisted in Company E, Seventy-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers, serving until August 30, 1865, when he was discharged at Nashville, Tennessee. In February, 1867, he graduated in a business course at Eastman's College, Poughkeepsie, New York. He has taught three terms of school. On the day he arrived at the age of twenty-one years, he left his father's house for the West, settling in Wells County, Indiana, near Ossian, in June, 1869, where he was a day laborer on farm and railroad, until he began the study of law November 3, 1869, in the law office of Todd & Shinn, of Bluffton, Indiana, pursuing his studies day and night with such assiduity that he was admitted to the bar in September, 1870, at Bluffton, entering the practice first as junior member of the law firm of Todd & Martin, and then of Burwell & Martin. He engaged in the practice alone in April, 1874. During that year line was elected a Democratic member of the Legislature from the counties of Adams and Wells, serving as chairman of the committee on corporations and second on the committees on judiciary and the organization of courts. On April 19, 1876, he was nominated for Reporter of the Supreme Court of Indiana, on the Democratic State ticket led by \"Blue Jeans\" Williams for Governor, which ticket was elected in October, 1876. In 1880 Mr. Martin was renominated by acclamation, and, although the whole Democratic State ticket was defeated, he was beaten by less majority than any other nominee on that ticket. During his four years' term he edited and published volumes LIV. to LXX., seventeen in all, of Indiana Reports. In May, 1881, he removed to Austin, Texas, where he engaged in the practice of the law with his brother, Homer L. Martin, continuing at Austin until July 19, 1883, when the brothers began practice together again at Bluffton, Indiana. On September 21, 1881, Mr. Martin was married, at her parents' home, to Ida L., eldest daughter of Owen T. and Lizzie Curd, of Charleston, Coles County, Illinois. Mabel Martin is his only child, who was born at Austin, Texas, on June 30, 1882. Mr. Martin, with his wife and daughter, resides at Bluffton, where he is engaged in practicing his profession, with success. He was leading counsel for the State in the celebrated prosecution of William Walker for the murder of George Shaw, the trial occupying the whole of the April term, 1884, of the Wells Circuit Court, resulting in a judgment sentencing Walker to twenty-one years in the State prison. He was also engaged in the trial of the celebrated case of William A. Davis vs. Dr. John C. Fulton, for malpractice, which occupied the attention of a jury for two weeks, in March, 1887, resulting in a verdict for Dr. Fulton, Mr. Martin's client. He is a Democrat, is a member of the Presbyterian church, is over six feet in height, and has hair as black as night itself.\n\nBiographical and historical record of Adams and Wells counties, Indiana.

Our subject was reared on a farm in his native county, remaining at home until twenty-two years of age, when he went to work by the month for David Albert, and three years later, in 1836, accompanied Mr. Albert to Montgomery County, Ohio, remaining there a year and a half, when he returned to Pennsylvania to visit his friends. He spent the winter at home, and in the spring of 1840 went again to Ohio, when he found that his friend and employer had died the 24th of October, 1839. He then went to work by the day, making his home with Mrs. Albert, and the following fall took charge of her farm, which he worked on shares three years. December 25, 1942, he was married to Elizabeth Albert, a native of Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, daughter of David and Elizabeth (Houtz) Albert, and granddaughter of Nicholas Albert. In 1853 Mrs. Albert sold her farm, and with Mr. Mast moved to Wells County, Indiana, and bought 240 acres of land in Rock Creek Township, twenty acres of which was partially improved. Mr. Mast bought eighty acres of land in Lancaster Township, although he located on his mother-in-law's farm and carried it on for her, subsequently buying 160 acres of her. She made her home with him as long as she lived. In February, 1883, Mr. Mast retired from the active and arduous labors of farm life, and removed to Bluffton, where he is now living in the enjoyment of a competency gained by years of toil. Mr. and Mrs. Mast have had eight children - David, Uriah, Amanda A. (died, aged one year and eight months), Eliza, Laura, Lucinda, Jennie, and Ida. In politics Mr. Mast is a Democrat. He and his wife are members of the Reformed Church.\n\nBiographical and historical record of Adams and Wells counties, Indiana. Chicago: Lewis Publishing Co., 1887, pp. 904-907.\n\nContributed by Tammy Rable\n\nUriah Mast\n\nOne of the leading farmers and an ex-business man of Rock Creek township, Wells County, Indiana, is Uriah Mast, who was born in Montgomery county, Ohio, February 26, 1847, and is a son of Abraham and Elizabeth (Albert) Mast, the former of whom was a native of Pennsylvania, born in Lebanon county, and who, when about twenty-three years old, migrated to Ohio and located in Montgomery county, where he renewed his friendship for the Albert family, with whom he had been acquainted before leaving Pennsylvania, and, although a poor young man at that time, was united in marriage with Miss Elizabeth. About 1853 Abraham Mast brought his family to Wells County, Indiana. He had previously been to Wells county and purchased a tract of land in Rock Creek township, in section 22, but did not then settle on this land. He first moved in with his mother-in-law, Mrs. Albert, who resided in Rock Creek township, on section 14, and at first rented her farm, which he afterwards purchased and on which he resided until moving to Bluffton, where his death took place in June, 1891, his wife having passed to the other world three weeks previous. The family of Mr. and Mrs. Mast comprised eight children, named as follows: David, who is now a resident of Iowa; Uriah, whose name opens this biographical record; Amanda, deceased; Eliza, widow of John Eichhorn; Laura, unmarried; Lucinda, wife of Edward Souers, of Bluffton; Jennie, wife of Abe Simmons, of Bluffton, and Ida, wife of Benjamin Ashbaucher.\n\nUriah Mast was a child of about six years of age when he came with his parents to Wells county, Indiana, and here, at the proper age, he was placed in the district school, which he attended during the winter seasons until twenty-one years old, but in the summer seasons dutifully assisted in caring for the home farm, and for a year after attaining his majority he worked for his father on the same conditions as would a hired hand, after which he went to Illinois and remained some time. On his return to Wells County, Indiana, he rented the home farm, which he conducted for a couple of years.\n\nIn 1874 Uriah Mast was united in marriage with Miss Maggie Eichhorn, a daughter of Philip and Margaret (Hostler) Eichhorn. She was born in Ohio and when about eleven years old was brought to Wells County, Indiana. She did not, however, long survive the ceremony which made her a wife and within one year thereafter was called to rest. The second marriage of Mr. Mast took place November 4, 1878, to Mrs. Lucetta Brehm, widow of John Brehm, but who had borne the maiden name of Cassel. No children, however were born to either of these two marriages. Mr. and Mrs. Mast are devout members of the Reform church at St. Paul, in which Mr. Mast had officiated as elder and deacon for many years. In politics Mr. Mast is a Democrat in principle but has never been particularly active in the affairs of his party. Fraternally he a member of the Improved Order of Red Men at Bluffton.\n\nThe doctrine or theory that agriculture is the veritable source of wealth been exemplified in the experience of Mast. About the year 1887, he left farm and went to Bluffton, and for eighteen months was identified with Studabaker, Sale & Company warehouse, then also for eighteen months was with Jacob Brown. Next, he rented the H. Frieze feed barn for five years; but although he did a fairly paying business, he was not as well satisfied as when farming, and so returned to his home place in Rock Creek township, where he is now one of the leading farmers and most respected citizens.\n\nBiographical Memoirs of Wells County, Indiana. B.F. Bowen, Logansport, Indiana, 1903, pp. 497-499.\n\nTranscribed by Paul Bender\n\nJacob McAfee\n\nOne of the most extensive stock raisers and farmers of Rock Creek township, Wells county, Indiana, is Jacob McAfee, a native of this township, born February 26, 1851, and a son of Samuel and Elizabeth (Lesh) McAfee. The McAfee family is of Irish origin and the American branch from which Jacob McAfee descended were early settlers in Virginia, where Samuel McAfee, father of Jacob, was born and reared, though he subsequently settled in Pennsylvania. Subsequently both the McAfee and Lesh families came to Indiana and located in Rock Creek township, Wells county, where Samuel McAfee spent the greater part of his life after moving to the county, though in later years he lived in Liberty township. The family of Samuel and Elizabeth McAfee comprised five sons and three daughters, of whom six still survive, viz: Jacob, John, Peter, Catherine, wife of Chester Scotton, Prescilla, wife of James Gordon, and Hattie, married to William D. Gordon.\n\nJacob McAfee was reared to agricultural pursuits on the farm on which he had his nativity, and received a very good common school education. At the age of twenty-two he was first married, selecting for his helpmate Miss Jane Logan, daughter of the late John Logan, and to this union was born one child, Mollie, a resident of Toledo, Ohio. Mrs. Jane (Logan) McAfee was called away soon after the birth of her child, and Jacob McAfee in due course of time married Miss Amanda A. Lamm, daughter of Waverly Lamm, of Lancaster township, and this marriage has been crowned by the birth of five boys and three girls, of whom five are still living, and all single.\n\nAt the age of twenty-one years Jacob McAfee was a poor young man as far as this world's substantialities were concerned. But he was possessed of robust health, a clear and comprehensive intellect and an indomitable spirit of enterprise, united with indefatigable industry. He first found a means of earning money by working out by the job at ditching, chopping and clearing, from which labor he realized about three hundred dollars, of which amount he was the possessor at the time of his first venture on the sea of matrimony. For two years after marriage Mr. McAfee engaged in farming, a pursuit to which he had been well trained, and next went into the saw-mill business, having by this time acquired a capital of seven hundred dollars. This mill, known as the McAfee Brothers' mill, was located near Rock Creek Center, in Wells county, and here Mr. McAfee did custom work, and also bought, cut and sold lumber for thirteen years, at the close of which period he was worth six thousand dollars and the owner of one hundred and forty acres of good land, to which he has since added one hundred and eighty acres, and is now worth twenty-four thousand dollars. Mr. McAfee has also been largely engaged in stock raising, in which he has been very successful, as he has been, indeed, in all his undertakings, being what is usually known as a \"hustler\" and naturally a shrewd business man.\n\nIn politics Mr. McAfee is one of the reliable Democrats of Rock Creek township and is active in his support of his party, but has never sought to advance his personal interests by aspiring to public office. Mrs. McAfee is a member of the German Reformed church, to the support of which both she and her husband are liberal contributors. As the reader will naturally infer from the fact that Mr. and Mrs. McAfee are both natives of Wells county, they are widely and favorably known, and their upright walk through life has augmented the great respect in which they are held throughout the community in which they have their residence.\n\nBiographical Memoirs of Wells County, Indiana. B.F. Bowen, Logansport, Indiana, 1903, pp. 444-445.\n\nJohn McAfee\n\nThis native-born and respected farmer of Rock Creek township, Wells county, Indiana, was born January 6, 1854, and is a son of Samuel and Elizabeth (Lesh) McAfee, of whom mention of greater length will be found on other pages of this volume. He was educated in the district school of his neighborhood, which he attended until about seventeen years of age, and then began working on a farm by the month, the father absorbing whatever compensation was granted to the son. At the age of twenty-one years, John McAfee was presented with a horse, as a capital with which to begin his business career in life, and, as the sequel will show, he did not misapply this small means toward advancing his future progress. In 1875 he took a third interest in a saw-mill with his father and George Riley, but after a few months the father and son bought out the interest of Mr. Riley in this mill and for some time ran it on their mutual account. John, Jacob and Peter McAfee then bought the mill and conducted it for thirteen years, buying and cutting their timber, taking such contracts for custom sawing as they could secure, and disposing of their own outfit at a very fair profit. The father and son John each owned a one-hundred-and-sixty-acre tract of wooded land, valued at five thousand dollars per tract; but John was rather improvident at that time and gave his obligations for his investment, all of which he promptly met as they fell due.\n\nJohn McAfee next moved upon his present farm in section 17, Rock Creek township, on rural route No. 3 from Bluffton, the greater part being then in the forest, but this portion he has since cleared up and improved and added to it until he owned four hundred and twenty acres. He later disposed of eighty acres, so that he now owns a trifle less than three hundred and forty acres, which is valued at twenty-seven thousand dollars. He deals largely in hogs, but is also a farmer who looks well to what pays him best, and figures on about two thousand dollars net profit per annum from his farm produce, most of which he invests in additional land. He is a scientific agriculturist and keeps himself well posted by reading the best farming journals. He also is quite regular in his attendance at farmers' institutes and is a good listener, but not an orator. He has never wandered far from the spot where he was born and now lives within a mile of his birth place, of which he in fact owns a part.\n\nMarch 31, 1877, John McAfee was united in marriage with Miss Isabella Light, who was born in Jackson township, Wells county, November 12, 1856, and is a daughter of Isaac W. and Phebe (Pouless) Light. The father was called away, however, and the mother became the wife of George Spraks [sic]. The marriage of John McAfee to Isabella Light has been crowned with four children, viz: Lillie, born August 25, 1878, who is now the wife of Charles W. Decker, a farmer in Rock Creek township; Earnest, born March 28, 1882, still unmarried; Winnie, born August 21, 1885, is assisting in caring for the household; John, born June 12, 1887, is attending the district school.\n\nMr. and Mrs. McAfee are members of St. Paul Lutheran church of Rock Creek township, of which Mr. McAfee is a deacon. He has always been a liberal supporter of this church financially, and on its being rebuilt contributed very freely to the building fund. In his political views he is in sympathy with the Democratic party, but has never felt any ambition as to filling public office. Mr. and Mrs. McAfee are both very pleasant and affable, and their advice upon farming and many other subjects is freely sought by their neighbors, far and near, as it can be implicitly relied upon as being honest and sincere.\n\nSamuel McAfee, the father of the gentleman whose name opens this record, and who now has his residence in Liberty township, Wells county, was one of the patriots who gallantly went to the front during the dire need of the nation for defenders at the time of the Civil war. August 20, 1862, he enlisted in Company G. One Hundred and First Indiana Volunteer Infantry, under Captain Wilson, and took part, among others, in the following named serious engagements: Perrysville, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge and Chattanooga; he was also all through the Atlanta campaign and at the siege and fall of that fated city; was at the battle of Peach Tree Creek, Georgia; Bentonville, North Carolina; was present at the surrender of the rebel general, Johnston, and was honorably discharged at the close of the war at Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nElizabeth (Lesh) McAfee was a native of Berks county, Pennsylvania, was married to Samuel McAfee in 1851, and died at her home in Rock Creek township in September, 1894, truly honored by all who knew her.\n\nBiographical Memoirs of Wells County, Indiana. B.F. Bowen, Logansport, Indiana, 1903, pp. 437-438.\n\nSamuel J. McAfee\n\nSAMUEL J. McAFEE resides on section 4, Lancaster Township, where he has one of the best improved farms in his part of the county. His fine residence was erected in 1886, and his farm buildings are correspondingly good, the entire surroundings of the place proving the owner to be a thorough, practical farmer. The homestead was first opened by his father, James McAfee, who was the first man to introduce underdrainage in Wells County, which he did in 1855. The farm, consisting of eighty-four acres, contains 1,200 rods of tile drainage. The parents of our subject, James and Rachel (Dinsmore) McAfee, were born in County Antrim, Ireland, and were descendants of the Scotch Covenanters. Immediately after their marriage they came to America, and for a short time made their home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Samuel J. was born December 29, 1829. Soon after his birth they removed to Wayne County, Ohio, where the mother died in 1844, and in 1853 the father came to Wells County, Indiana, with his family. He was married again, taking for his second wife Miss Eliza Cherry. He died on the old homestead in Lancaster Township, July 9, 1861, in his fifty-eighth year. William J. McAfee, a brother of our subject, lives at Bluffton. He has two step-sisters, Mrs. Matilda J. Earl, living in Lancaster, and Hannah M.\n\nSamuel J. McAfee was reared on the home farm in Lancaster Township, remaining there until his marriage September 28, 1865, to Miss Rachel Nelson, who was born in Wells County, a daughter of James and Elizabeth Nelson, of Lancaster Township, her parents being pioneers of the county. She died November 9, 1871, leaving two daughters, Etta A. and Florence E. Mr. McAfee was married a second time, September 29, 1873, to Miss Catherine Maddux, born in Lancaster Township, December 28, 1848, a daughter of Jacob and Anna Maddux, and to this union were born two sons - Ernest W. and Jacob M. Mr. Maddax came from Miami County, Ohio, to Wells County in the pioneer days, and settled on section 9, Lancaster Township, in 1838, where he entered 160 acres of Government land. He was a native of Pennsylvania. After clearing a little of his land and erecting a cabin in Lancaster Township, he married Anna Evans, whom he brought to his pioneer home. To them were born five children- John N. died after reaching manhood; Martha J., wife of W. J. Parkinson, of Lancaster Township; Catherine, wife of our subject; Sarah, wife of Elijah Miller, of Lancaster Township, where he lives on part of the old homestead, and Alice, wife of Isaiah Bush, who also lives on the old homestead. The parents lived to an advanced age, the father dying February 9, 1884, at the age of sixty-six years, and the mother dying two months later at the age of sixty-five years. For two years after their marriage Mr. and Mrs. McAfee lived on rented land on section 8, Lancaster Township, when they went to Allen County. One year later they returned to Wells County, to the old homestead of his parents, of which he is now the owner, and here they have since made their home. Both are members of the Presbyterian church. In politics Mr. McAfee has always been a Republican.\n\nBiographical and historical record of Adams and Wells counties, Indiana. Chicago: Lewis Publishing Co., 1887, pp. 847-848.\n\nWilliam J.

McAFEE, of Bluffton, was born in Wayne County, Ohio, October 3, 1841, a son of James and Rachel (Dinsmore) McAfee, natives of County Antrim, Ireland, where they were reared and married, and in 1836 came to the United States and settled in Wayne County, Ohio, where they engaged in farming. The parents of James McAfee accompanied him to the United States, and both died in Ohio. To James and Rachel McAfee were born two sons-Samuel J. and William J. Mrs. McAfee died in 1842, and the father afterward married Eliza Cherry, and to them were born two daughters-Matilda J., wife of James Earl, and Maria. October 3, 1853, the father came to Wells County, Indiana, and bought eighty-three and a half acres of land in Lancaster Township, where he passed the rest of his life, his death occurring in 1862, at the age of fifty-two years.\n\nSamuel J.

One year later they returned to Wells County, to the old homestead of his parents, of which he is now the owner, and here they have since made their home. Both are members of the Presbyterian church.\n\nThe subject of our sketch, William McAfee, was twelve years of age when his father moved to Wells County, and here he was reared and educated. He remained on the farm with his father until after the breaking out of the war of the Rebellion, and July 12, 1861, enlisted in the defense of his country, being the first man to enlist in the three years' service from Wells County. He was assigned to Company I, Twenty-second Indiana Infantry, and saw active service the greater part of the time of his enlistment, participating in many of the most noted battles of the war. He was with Fremont on the frontier, and at the battles of Glasgow and Warrensburg, Missouri, was at Pea Ridge, Corinth, Bay Springs, Perryville, Stone River, Hoover's Gap, Liberty Gap, Chickamauga, Mission Ridge, Buzzard's Roost, Resaca, Rome, Rocky Face Ridge, Big Shanty, New Hope Church, Burnt Hickory, Kenesaw Mountain, Dallas, Chattahoochie River, Peach Tree Creek, Atlanta, Jonesboro, with Sherman to the sea, and at Averasboro and Bentonville. He participated in the grand review at Washington, and was honorably discharged August 5, 1865. He was wounded twice, in the head at Mission Ridge, and in the foot at Kenesaw Mountain. At the close of the war he returned to his home in Wells County, and engaged in farming on the old homestead, his father having died while he was in the army. In 1867 he bought eighty acres of land in Jefferson Township, and built a house, and cleared twenty-five acres. In 1870 he sold his farm and went to Osage, Kansas, where he lived three years; then returned to Wells County, and bought eighty acres of improved land in Lancaster Town-ship. In 1882 he bought 160 acres on section 17, Harrison Township, which is one of the best farms in the county. He lived on this farm three years, and in March, 1885, rented it and moved to Bluffton. For a year and a half he was engaged in the farm-implement business, and in the fall of 1886 became associated with George H. Maddox in the livery business.\n\nMr. McAfee was married September 27, 1867, to Mary E. Taylor, a daughter of Levi and Keziah (Calahan) Taylor, who came from Trumbull County, Ohio, to Wells County, in 1861. Mr. and Mrs. McAfee have five children-Orpha, Harry L., James T., Ellsworth and Ella. In politics Mr. McAfee is a Republican, and is chairman of the Wells County Republican Central Committee.

He was reared in his native country until attaining his eighteenth year, when he immigrated with his father's family to America. The father had come to America seven years before, and worked on his farm of 120 acres which he had entered in Chester Township, Wells County, Indiana, until he returned for his family. After coming to this country they located in Dayton, Ohio, and after remaining there about three weeks Patrick and his father came to Fort Wayne, leaving the rest of the family in Dayton. They came on foot from Fort Wayne to Wells County to inspect their future home in Chester Township, which the father had improved from a state of nature, and later brought his family here. Thinking his farm too small for his family he located on a larger one belonging to his brother John, who lived in Piqua, Ohio. James McCaffrey died March 17, 1882. His widow still survives, and is now a resident of Morris County, Kansas.\n\nPatrick McCaffrey, our subject, was united in marriage November 6, 1868, to Miss Catherine Meehan, a native of Ireland, born in County Donegal, a daughter of Patrick and Winnifred (McGroaty) Meehan, of whom her mother died in Ireland. Her father afterward came to America and died in Springfield, Ohio. Six children were born to Mr. and Mrs. McCaffrey, named as follows - Lizzie, James, Charles, Mary, Annie, and William. Mr. McCaffrey resided in Wells County from the time he first located here until his death, which occurred January 28, 1884. In 1871 he purchased eighty acres of land in Chester Township, which is still occupied by his widow. He was a kind and affectionate husband and father, and a good neighbor, and was held in high esteem by all who knew him.\n\nBiographical and historical record of Adams and Wells counties, Indiana.

He studied medicine under the celebrated Dr. Brusler, at Lancaster, and completed his medical education at the University of Pennsylvania in the winter of 1848-'49. He was married to Miss M. Gutelius, October 23, 1849, at Carroll, Fairfield County, Ohio, where he practiced his profession up to the time of his emigration to Bluffton, Wells County, Indiana, August 30, 1851. Shortly after his arrival he entered into co-partnership with Dr. Henry Courtney under the firm of Courtney & McCleery, which contained harmoniously for several years, when the senior partner emigrated to Iowa. In the spring of 1853 he united with the fraternity of Masons at Fort Wayne, Indiana, and continued as a worthy member of that order up to the time of his death, which took place on his farm, a few miles southeast of Bluffton, on April 21, 1874, in his fifty-second year. In the spring of 1861 he entered into co-partnership with Dr. Melsheimer in the drug business, under the firm of McCleery Melsheimer. A fine three-story brick building was erected, which is now occupied as a hardware store by Mr. Brickley. The firm continued their business for several years, when it was amicably dissolved by a withdrawal of the doctor to assume the duties of clerk of Wells County, to which office he had been elected in the fall of 1867, and also re-elected in 1871. Dr. McCleery was a man of fine social qualities, by which he became endeared to all his acquaintances. He was a prudent and cautious practitioner of marked ability. He had a very extensive knowledge of the theory of medicine, and possessed that very rare faculty of reducing it to successful practice.\n\nBiographical and historical record of Adams and Wells counties, Indiana. Chicago: Lewis Publishing Co., 1887, pp. 669-670.\n\nSamuel McCleery\n\nFor over sixty-five years the name McCleery has been identified with Wells County, where its associations are most honorable and where it is spoken with the respect due to success in business, public service and duty well performed.\n\nThe present Mr. Samuel McCleery is now a retired merchant and carpenter, and is a native of Bluffton, having been born on Wabash Street May 8, 1852. Many of his most active years were spent away from Bluffton, but he has always regarded it as his permanent home. His parents were Samuel and Mary (Forbes) McCleery. His father was born in County Antrim, Ireland, and his birthplace was a stone house known as Iva House. At the age of nineteen he came to the United States, first locating in Philadelphia, where he married a Miss Daugherty, who died in that city. Not long afterwards he came to Wooster in Wayne County, Ohio, and there married Mary Forbes. They were the parents of five children. The daughter Elizabeth was born in Wooster, Ohio, and is the widow of Lafayette Shinn, living at Montpelier, Indiana. The second child, William A. McCleery, was born at Edinburg, Ohio, and is now deceased. In 1849 the McCleery family came to Bluffton, and the first child born here was Charles McCleery in 1850, whose death occurred in 1916. Samuel McCleery, Sr., died at Bluffton in 1893. His second wife passed away in August, 1863.\n\nSamuel McCleery, Sr., on coming to Bluffton was employed by the firm of Studabaker & Winters, and then started a shop of his own as a boot and shoe maker. He built up quite a business and had several men working under him. In 1856 he moved to the old town of Murray in Wells County, and lived in a log house there. He also conducted a tavern at Murray and built a shoe store there in 1859. In 1860, returning to Bluffton, he resumed his trade as shoemaker and in 1861 he erected the store room now occupied by W. H. Merriman on North Main Street, at the corner of Wabash Street. At one time he served as town marshal of Bluffton.\n\nSamuel McCleery, Jr., grew up at Bluffton and remained at home until he was twenty-two years of age. In the meantime he had benefited by the instruction of the public schools. Concerning his early education it is interesting to recall the fact that he attended a school in the house where he now lives and which then stood at the northwest corner of West Market and Johnson streets. He was also a student in the first high school established at Bluffton.\n\nMr. McCleery learned the shoemakers' trade and followed it for eight years, but then took up work as a carpenter. He was employed in the bridge department of The Clover Leaf Railway in 1879, 1880 and 1881 and was then engaged in building bridges with the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railway for a year. In 1882 he went with the Wabash Railroad, and on May 26, 1886, he joined the Santa Fe Railway Company at Wichita, Kansas, and was in the bridge building department of that western railroad until 1900. From 1900 to 1903 he was connected with the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway Company and was superintendent of bridges and building over the entire road, a distance of over 500 miles. In October, 1903, Mr. McCleery returned to Bluffton and for several years concerned himself chiefly with looking after and repairing his property. In January, 1910, he engaged in the grocery business, but soon sold out and is now retired. Mr. McCleery has never married. He owns sixty acres of land at the old town of Murray, and has several properties in Bluffton, including a business room at the corner of Main and Wabash streets.\n\nHe is an active member of the Presbyterian Church, is affiliated with Bluffton Lodge No. 145, Free and Accepted Masons, and also with the Royal Arch Chapter and Council and is a past sachem of the Improved Order of Red Men. Politically he has always cast his vote as a stanch democrat.\n\nStandard History of Adams and Wells Counties Indiana. John W Tyndall for Adams Co and O. E. Lesh for Wells County.

McCollister\n\nThe career of the subject of this sketch forcibly illustrates the old axiom, \"Where there is a will, there is a way.\" Becoming an independent factor in life at the early age of fourteen, with an empty pocket and no one to give him friendly counsel or advice, he resolutely faced the world and after a long and hard struggle, before which most young men would have retired in defeat, he finally succeeded in gaining a sure foothold and in time rose to the respectable position he now occupies. The name by which he is now known is not the one given him by his parents, but was assumed for a special reason. The family patronymic was Beabout and by such he went until a youth in his teens. His father, Moses Beabout, was a native of Pennsylvania and his mother, whose maiden name was Elizabeth Smallie, was born and reared in Mercer county, that state. The subject was born in the county of Mercer on the 28th of February, 1832, and remained under the parental roof until reaching the age of fourteen. Like many other youths, he became impatient of home restraint and for reasons which he cares not to explain decided to sever these ties and make his own way in the world. He carried this resolution into effect between two days and for fear his parents might apprehend him, changed his name to McCollister and by this he has since been known. Making his way to Pittsburg, he there took a boat for Cincinnati and after working at various vocations in the latter place made his way to Clinton County, Ohio, where he worked for several years as a farm hand. He also found employment for a while in a saw-mill and later entered the service of a railroad as brakeman. He continued railroading for quite a while in various capactities and in this and other kinds of work finally earned sufficient money to enable him, as he supposed, to support a wife. Accordingly, on the 23d of December, 1855, he was married in Clinton county, Ohio, to Elizabeth Smith, daughter of James T. and Lydia M. (Wait) Smith, the father a native of Delaware and the mother of the Buckeye state.\n\nAfter his marriage Mr. McCollister settled down in Clinton county for a couple of years, but being quite poor in this world's goods he experienced considerable difficulty in making a livelihood, to say nothing of laying aside the little surplus for the proverbial rainy day. His principal work during his residence in Ohio was sawing lumber, but this kind of employment not proving remunerative, he finally moved with his father-in-law to Jay county, Indiana. There he rented land and followed agricultural pursuits until 1866, at which time his wife's father purchased forty acres of land in Wells county and to this place the subject moved in Feburary of the same year. The only improvement on the place at that time was a small log abin and into this Mr. McCollister moved his little family, after which he addressed himself to the work of clearing the land. One year later he returned to Jay county, but continued to devote his spare time working on his own palce until he had all but ten acres in cultivation. At the end of three years he again took up his residence on his own soil and bent every effort to make a comfortable home for those dependent upon him. He worked in a saw-mill to pay for the lumber for a new house, alter built a fine barn and, being blessed with health and strength, his progress from that time on was altogether satisfactory. In the course of ten years he not only brought his own little farm to a fine state of cultivation, but purchased eithy acres of good land in the county of Jay, which in due time became quite valuable in that it lies within one of the richest of the Indiana oil fields. Subsequently he transferred the latter farm to his son, but he still owns forty acres in Jay which, with his home in Wells, leaves him an estate of eighty ares, more than sufficient for his needs seeing that he received every year a handsome income from the five producing oils wells on his land.\n\nMr. McCollister has always been an industrious, hard working man and many times the world looked dark and the future held out nothing in the way of promise.
