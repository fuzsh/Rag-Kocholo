Religion has long since been taken out of our public schools, and all our tax-supported institutions of popular training are supposed to be absolutely ^‘neutrah* on the subject. This came about through two factors chiefly. One was the enormous material prosperity of the country, which led to a philosophy of secularism and an ethical code that is not positively Christian, or really will\n\nand the educator,\n\nreligious.\n\nThe other factor was the\n\nism among Jews and\n\nRoman\n\nspirit of sectarian-\n\nCatholics that led\n\nthem to any\n\nexercise their rights as tax-paying citizens to oppose\n\nteaching in the public schools that was Christian or Protestant.\n\nRecently\n\nit\n\nhas become clear to\n\nall\n\nthoughtful citizens\n\ninsecure without some kind of religious training on the part of our coming generations of citizens. To restore the adequate teaching of the Christian religion and morality to the public schools,\n\nthat our national life\n\nis\n\nwould contravene a fundamental American principle involving the freedom of conscience. The public safety and the permanence of American institutions, therefore, require of our Churches that they arrange to supplement public school education with religious education. This is one of the chief problems confronting our educators and\n\nIntroduction\n\nvi\n\nour churchmen today. busied on its solution.\n\nAt\n\nAnd thousands\n\nthis juncture, therefore,\n\nit is\n\nof\n\nhands are\n\nhighly interesting and\n\nprofitable to contemplate the situation that prevailed in\n\nthe\n\nearly history of\n\nwhen there was no common agencies of\n\nour country,\n\n“neutrality” as to religion in the\n\npopular instruction, when there were no public schools in the sense of tax-supported institutions, but when the whole nation expected the Christian Churches not only to promulgate religion among the people, but also to provide general education for all citizens by founding and supporting “common schools.” This challenge the Churches accepted, and their responsibility they discharged in no mean way. The Lutheran Church has always been a teaching Church, and despite the depressing circumstances of poverty and persecution under which\n\nmuch\n\nof its membership came to this country, the Lutheran pastors and school-teachers in the eighteenth century, did more than their share in helping to mould an inteligent citizenship and keeping alive the fires of religion and morality. To have the details of this picture drawn fof us at this time, lays us under a debt of gratitude to Doctor Maurer.\n\nThe work has been done thoroughly. Dr. Maurer approached his subject with enthusiasm because he is himself descended from Lutherans who came to this country As a graduate student of in the eighteenth century. Temple University and the University of Pennsylvania, and for years a teacher of general history, he possesses the technical training for such a piece of research and writing.\n\nFrom his book and his bibliography, it is clear that he has had recourse in almost every case to primary sources and has patiently gathered his great body of deHis presentatails from all manner of obscure places. tion covers a wide scope, and brings to the reader a vivid picture of those early Lutheran schools and their\n\nIntroduction\n\nVll\n\nand their books, their curricula and their administrative methods.

As a part of colonial education under religious auspices, it had features in common with the education provided by other denominations and religious groups in Pennsylvania, and is essential to a complete history of education in the state. To understand fully any historical movement requires a knowledge of conditions and events preceding the period under discussion. To treat adequately any phase of colonial education in Pennsylvania requires a threefold historical background. First, we need a history of the people, whence they came and why, their numbers, their traits of character, and the regions settled. Secondly, such a treatment calls for a survey of the Church, for by her colonial education in Pennsylvania was conducted. Here a knowledge of the European Church background is helpful, as well as the organization of the Church and her doctrines. A third division\n\nin the eighteenth century\n\nof this historical background\n\nis\n\nis\n\ncolonial legislation relat-\n\ning to education, an essential to a full understanding of the origin of church schools and the control exercised by the Church and state over them.\n\nBecause the history of the Lutheran Church\n\nis\n\ninextri-\n\nEarly Lutheran Education in Pennsylvania\n\n2\n\ncably involved in the general history of the German people and their emigration to Pennsylvania, and because little or no general historical material exists which deals with the Lutherans from a distinctly Lutheran point of\n\nview, the treatment of the historical phases of emigration must be presented in the light of the entire movement of German emigration to Pennsylvania.\n\nSince the great body of German colonists who emigrated to Pennsylvania came from the Rhine country or the Palatinate, the term, Palatinate, was indiscriminately applied to all German emigrants by the English.^ The people of the Rhine country were descendents of the German tribes called Rhein-Franken, with an admixture of the Allemanni.3 The borders of the Palatinate at that time extended from the Neckar valley, downstream on both sides of the Rhine to Oppenheim, Alzei, and BachaMannheim, Heidelberg and Worms were within rach. its borders. The area was about the same as the area of the state of New Jersey. ^ During the middle ages the Palatinate had been among the most powerful and influential states of Germany. Many of the rulers of the Palatinate had been numbered among the enlightened monarchs of Europe.^ Following the Palatinate in the number of emigrants sent to America were Wurtemburg, Baden and Switzerland in the order named. While the Germans were suffering religious persecution, the Thirty Years’ War fell upon the people with unimaginable and indescribable horrors. Many sections became a desolate wilderness. About seventy-five per cent, of the people in Henneberg County, eighty-five per cent, of the horses, and eighty-two per cent, of the cattle\n\nwere\n\nkilled.^\n\nDubbs, Reformed Church in Pennsylvania, p. 26.

Years' War, which began in 1618 as a struggle between the Catholic and Protestant Princes of Germany, graduPalatinate,\n\nally involved all the states of the continent.®\n\nThe\n\nfertile\n\nland of the Palatinate attracted the full fury of the war which raged back and forth over this state. The Elector, Frederick V, precipitated the war. In 1622 General Tilly destroyed the land, being followed ten years later by Gustavus Adolphus and his troops. In 1635 came the Spaniards under Gallos, who exceeded even the efforts of the imperialists and the Swedes in their destructive powers. During the years 1635 and 1636, the people were subjected to the most terrible misery. Famine and pestilence came from 1636 to 1638 to add to their suffering. The people tried to satisfy hunger with roots, grass and leaves. The gallows and graveyards had to be guarded the bodies of children were not safe from their mothers. Wolves now roamed unmolested over what were once flourishing farms.’ Under the administration of Prince Karl Ludwig the land began to recover slowly from its desolated condition. The banks of the Neckar and the Rhine had become a desert. The vineyards were gone, the fields covered with thorns; instead of the former flourishing villages, a few wretched huts were found here and there. The French, in 1639, followed by the old foes again in 1644, ravaged the Palatinate. During the last years of this war the country was free from its foes, probably due to the fact that nothing remained worth stealing.® 6\n\nHayes, Political and Social History of Modern Europe, p. 221.\n\n7 Hayes, op. 8\n\ncit.,\n\np. 229.\n\nWentz, Beginnings of the German Element in York County, Pennsylvania\n\nGerman\n\nSociety,\n\nXXIV,\n\np.\n\n98.\n\nEarly Lutheran Education in Pennsylvania\n\n4\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia ended the long series of wars which followed the Reformation.

The government usually cared little for the people, and almost everywhere the party in power oppressed the dissenters. Each of the four electors of the Palatinate who served within a period of sixty years changed the religion.^^\n\nWhile the region along the Rhine recovered more rapidly from the ravages of the Thirty Years' War, misgovernment and religious intolerance were more severely felt there than in other sections. The rulers were interested in themselves and not in the welfare of their subjects.\n\nKarl Ludwig was one of the first of the German Princes to discard the idea that in order to govern his subjects well they must all be of the same confession as himself. He even invited the Huguenots and Waldenses to take asylum in the Palatinate. The Anabaptists, who had often been oppressed, now received freedom of worship.

He was even forced by the poverty of the land to dismiss many of the Protestant pastors, teachers and officials, and to combine or to dissolve a number of\n\nChurches and schools. The Treaty of Ryswick in 1697 ended the war between Germany and France.^'* Persecution of the Protestants, both Lutheran and Reformed, was carried on systematically, while other groups, such as the Mennonites, the Bunkers, the Quakers, and the Huguenots, were driven from the land.

Protestant pastors were thrown into prison. By a single decree seventy-five schoolmasters were rendered penniless. Scarcely had the Wars of the Palatinate closed in 1697 when the War of the Spanish Succession began in 1701, ending with the peace of Utrecht in 1713. In 1707 the Palatinate was ravaged by the troops under Marshal Villars. Then came the Wars of the Polish Succession extending from 1742 to 1747. After a brief interval came the Seven Years’ War, extending from 1756 to 1763.\n\nThrough\n\nall\n\nthese tribulations the various congrega-\n\nand would not change in spite of violence. The pastors were able and brave leaders. There is not an example of one who was a coward or proved untrue tions held firm\n\nto his office.\n\nTo the political and religious conditions we must add the corruption, the tyranny, the extravagance and heartlessness of the rulers of the Palatinate,\n\nwhich had much\n\nway\n\nfor emigration to America. The rulers slavishly imitated the French court.

There were two important causes for so large an emi-\n\nThe first was religious. This is seen fro/m the character of the people. The Rhine country from which most of the emigrants came was the home of both Mysticism and Pietism. Mysticism fiowered during the 14th century. On the practical side it produced the\n\ngration.\n\n17 Hayes, op.\n\ncit.,\n\np.\n\n317.\n\n— Historical\n\n\"‘Brethren of the their schools.\n\nCommon\n\nOn\n\nBackground Life’’ to instruct the\n\nyouth in\n\ncontributed to While the people were\n\nthe theoretical side\n\nand merged\n\n7\n\nit\n\nin the Reformation. deeply affected by Pietism, a post-Reformation movement in Germany, they remained true to their Church.\n\nThe Reformation did not go far enough to satisfy of the pious souls looking for more or different light than Luther and Zwingli found to break forth upon God’s word. Pietism, which arose in the 18th century, numbered among its followers men like Gottfried, Arnold, Professor Thomasius, Pastor Francke, and his son, the benefactor and guide of the neglected Lutherans\n\nmany\n\nof Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Pietistic movement aimed to better the spiritual and material welfare of mankind. The common people, as well as the rich and nobles, were followers of this movement. It stood for freedom of thought in religious matters and opposed the mental oppression which existed everywhere.^*\n\nThe second cause of the colonial German emigration was the social and political conditions of Germany. The ruthless ravages of war year after year caused many to long for another place for themselves and their children. So many had fled from the Palatinate that when Karl Ludwig returned to his desolated dominions, he found but a fiftieth part of the inhabitants remaining.\n\nFaust sums up the principal causes for emigration tyranny of the aristocrats, destructive wars, failure of crops and famine, and economic bankruptcy.19 William Penn visited Germany to extend the principles of the Society of Friends, but his visit had a far wider effect. His offer of asylum was gratefully religious persecution,\n\n18 Bittinger, 19\n\nThe German\n\nin Colonial Times, pp.\n\n12-13.\n\nRupp, History of Northampton, Lehigh, Monroe, and Schuylkill Counties,\n\nEarly Lutheran Education in Pennsylvania\n\n8\n\nreceived by those whose homes had been ravaged by the wars.so This offer was welcomed especially by the sect\n\nand the Reformed were the only recognized denominations along the Rhine, other forms of religious worship having been outlawed. According to Rupp, the first Germans, namely people, since the Catholics, the Lutherans,\n\nthe\n\nsects,\n\nemigrated to Pennsylvania for conscience’s\n\nwho came at a later date, the Church improve their temporal as well as their\n\nsake, while those\n\npeople,\n\ncame\n\nto\n\nspiritual conditions.\n\nThe favorable reports from the\n\nearlier settlers in Pennsylvania,\n\nand the innate desire for\n\nadventure infiuenced many later emigrants. In addition, the laws of Pennsylvania were more tolerant than those of the other colonies. Loher placed the cold winter of 1709 among the causes of emigration.^! The pamphlets published by Penn, Pastorius, and Falckner were another vital contributing factor. Land companies circulated some of these pamphlets. Among the most famous of the latter group was the ‘‘Golden Book,” which brought that flood of Palatines to London, in 1709, out of which were to come the settlements on the Schoharie and the Mohawk, and later those on the Tulpehocken, in Berks County.^^ So many came to London that the government found it necessary to circulate pamphlets designed to counteract the pamphlets of the land companies and of private individuals who painted such a brilliant picture of the New World. When the crowds of Palatines came to London in 1709, a commission of Parliament inquired into the cause of their coming. The conclusion of the investigation was that some persons in England encouraged the Palatines to come.23 20 Seidensticker, William Penn’s Travels in Holland and Germany, Pennsylvania Magazine, II, pp. 239-82. 21 Loehr, op. cit., p. 42. 22 Kuhns, op. cit., p. 26. 23 Faust, op. cit., p. 63.\n\nHistorical\n\nBackground\n\n9\n\nThe emigration of the Germans, falls into five periods. The first period, 1683 to 1708, began with the settlement of Germantown. There were thirteen families of emigrants, but the number of people is uncertain. On the 12th of October, a warrant was issued to Pastorius for six thousand acres of land “on behalf of the German and Dutch purchases.\"’ The first settlers coming in October built small huts, dug cellars, and passed the winter in much discomfort.24 During the second period, 1727 to 1775, German emigrants came in large numbers.^^ The great exodus, from the Palatinate to England, occurred in the first period, 1680 to 1708. The first period is relatively unimportant to this study but few Lutheran people came to Pennsylvania. The period was a preparation in Germany for the later periods. At this time the Dunkers, Mennonites, and other dissenting sects came to America.\n\nof immigration since\n\nDuring the second period, 1708 to 1720, the exodus England continued.

When negotiations, which permitted the Palatines to purchase land in 1732, were concluded, many more colonists came from New York. Since New York had an unfortunate method of dealing with the Germans, the immigrants avoided this colony and came to Pennsylvania. They also advised their friends to avoid New York.®® Whether the Germans were right in their claim is hard to determine, but nevertheless such feeling resulted in the advantage to Pennsylvania.\n\nThe fourth period\n\nof\n\nGerman\n\nemigration, from 1730\n\nto 1742, like that of the preceding period, consisted for\n\nthe most part of the ^‘church people,’^\n\nmany\n\nof\n\nwhom\n\nThe Reverend Jebediah Andrews, of a letter to the Reverend Thomas Prince\n\nwere Lutherans.

Governor Thomas wrote to the Bishop of Exeter in England in 1747, reporting that the Germans of Pennsylvania comprised three-fifths of the entire population of one hundred and twenty-five thousand. Benjamin Franklin testified before the House of Commons in 1766 that he supposed there were about one hundred and sixty thousand white inhabitants in Pennsylvania, of whom one-third were Quakers and onethird were Germans.^^ A colonial historian. Proud, also estimated the Germans as comprising one-third of the inhabitants during the decade 1760 to 1770.^3 Kuhns estimated the number of immigrants from 1727 to 1775 to be sixty-eight thousand, eight hundred, seventy-two. If we add to this the number of Germans in Pennsylvania before that time, and allow for natural increase, it would bring the total German population to about one hundred ten thousand. The German population, in 1790, was estimated to have reached one hundred sixty thousand, or about one-third of the total population of the state.\n\nTwo hundred\n\nyears ago traveling, whether on land or to be lightly undertaken. The emigrants transported themselves, their families, and their goods by wagons to the nearest river, which in most cases was the Rhine. Travel on the river at best was slow. Most of the vessels that came to Pennsylvania started from Rotterdam, where the emigrants were embarked together with their goods and provisions.^^ A journey across the ocean meant far more then than now. The whole journey was one continual series of discomforts, suffering, disease, and death.

The petitions of those who applied for naturalization in 1721, were not considered until 1724, and then unjust provisions regarding property and religious faith were included. Later when the petitioners agreed to the provisions of naturalization, the governor found reason to justify the unjust conditions imposed. The aim of the government was to postpone as long as possible any at-\n\ntempt\n\nto naturalize.46\n\nShip owners were required to record the names of German passengers, as a measure of safety. This was unique in colonial legislation, as was also the law which required each male emigrant over sixteen years of age to subscribe to the oath of allegiance to King 46 George.^^ There is no such record in the public Archives of any other groups of immigrants.

The first immigrants to Pennsylvania came in the ship Concord in 1683 and settled in Germantown under the leadership of Francis Daniel Pastorius, who was heartily welcomed by Penn. Coming late in the year, October 6, 1683, they had only time to build cellars and huts in which they passed the year with much hardship. Pastorius was advance courier of the prospective settlers of Germantown. He was an active and able man. Under his supervision the land was soon cleared, houses built, and a prosperous community founded. From here the settlements spread through Montgomery county. Northern Chester, Eastern Berks, and the broad plains of Lancaster and York counties. Later the settlements included the counties of Lehigh, Lebanon, Northampton, Bucks, Adams, and Dauphin. The area settled included the counties east of the Susquehanna River and south of the Blue Mountains, with some of the counties west of the Susquehanna River. Since many of the early German settlers came from the war-torn sections of Germany, they were not financially able to buy the best lands of the colony, but were forced to take the less expensive land on the frontier, each group going further west. As a result these German settlers bore the brunt of the raids during the French and Indian Wars. Others occupied the limestone regions adjacent to Philadelphia, and then moved northward and westward, filling up the rich limestone regions These until they possessed the best land of the colony. middle counties later became the granary of the colonies during the Revolutionary War, and are today among the richest farming counties of the nation.

Whatever property they gather together was used up in the expenses of descending the Rhine and crossing the ocean, or was stolen by the unprincipled ship-owners. In America, however, they soon transformed their poverty into prosperity and plenty. This was due largely to their indomitable industry, earnestness, frugality, and their consummate agricultural skill. While in the Palatinate they lost their houses, barns, cattle, and crops, they still kept their skill, which soon turned the unbroken forests into a rich farming community. ‘Tt is doubtful’^ says Kuhns, ‘‘if ever any colony was so perfectly adapted to the German of one hundred and fifty years the ravishes of the\n\nhad been able\n\nto\n\nago. 5 6\n\nOf Lancaster county.

The coming of the Lutherans to Pennsylvania, howwas preceded by the Swedes of this faith, who arrived in 1638, landing at Cape Henlopen. It may be well to remember that Sweden was not greatly interested in colonization but that peculiar circumstances led them ever,\n\nto settle\n\non the Delaware.\n\nGustavus Adolphus, an ardent\n\nProtestant, one of the greatest rulers\n\nthe nation ever the Thirty Years’ War against the forces of Catholicism and brought Sweden His genius, vision, and victorious out of the struggle.\n\nGermany\n\nhad, sided with\n\nin\n\nenthusiasm were cut short by an early death on the fatal of Zutphen.

It must be said to the credit of Minuit and his company that they bought the land they occupied from the five chiefs of the Minquas, a tribe of the Iroquois.\n\nHis successor bought more lands. In 1643, Gov. John Printz with the Reverend Mr. Companius, as chaplain of the company, arrived from Stockholm in the “Fame” accompanied by two warships, “The Swan” and “The Charitas.” The new governor received before leaving\n\nSweden\n\nspecific instructions in re-\n\ngard to worship, education, and evangelization of both his own people and the Indian neighbors. A part of the instructions reads as follows:\n\n“The wild nations bordering upon all sides, the governor shall understand how to treat with all humanity and respect, that no violence or wrong be done to them by Her Royal Majesty of her subjects aforesaid; but he shall rather at every opportunity exert himself that the same wild people may gradually be instructed in the truths and worship of the Christian religion and in other ways brought to civilization and good government and in this manner properly guided. Especially shall he seek to gain their confidence and impress upon their minds that neither he, the governor, nor his people and subordinates are come into these parts to do them any wrong or injury, but much more for the purpose of furnishing them such things as they may need for the ordinary wants of life, and so also for such things as are found among them which they cannot themselves make for their use or buy or exchange. “Before all, the governor must labor and watch that he renders in all things to Almighty God the true worship which is due the glory, the praise, and the homage which belong to Him, and take good measure that the divine service is performed according to the true confession of Augsburg, the council of Upsala, and the ceremonies of the Swedish Church, having care that all men, and es2 Acrelius,\n\nThe History\n\nof\n\nNew\n\nSweden.\n\n— 24\n\nEarly Lutheran Education in Pennsylvania\n\npecially the youths, be well instructed in all the parts of Christianity,\n\nand that a good\n\necclesiastical discipline be\n\nmaintained and\n\nobserved.”\n\nIt is interesting to note the spirit of toleration for other faiths in this sentence also contained in his instructions from the Swedish Queen,\n\n“With respect\n\nDutch colony which resides and is estabHer Majesty and of the crown, the governor must not disturb what has been ordained in the aforesaid grant of Her Majesty with regard of the exercise of reformed reto the\n\nlished in the country of\n\nligion.”\n\nGovernor Printz was a German nobleman whose Gertitle was Elder Von Buchen.

German Lutherans were here as evidenced by a record of a wedding in Germantown, April 2, 1672. In his reports to Sweden, Pastor Companius gives us a very vivid picture of his efforts.

Campanius is mentioned as the “teacher of the youths.” speaks in his own reports of his “daily instruction” and his efforts in teaching the Indians. Domine Lars, Hans Stahl, and Swen Colsbert are mentioned as teachers. Arvid Herboom, a young man from the Gymnasium at Skara, came to this country at his own prompting in 1713, being provided with good testimonials as to his learning and ability. He was employed as schoolmaster John in the congregation (Wiccacoe) for some years. Coding is mentioned as a schoolmaster at Tranhook. Swedish Lutheran Charles Christopher Springer, schoolmaster at Wiccacoe and lay reader at Tranhook, was a man of thorough education, and, while an attache of the Swedish minister in England, was abducted and carried to Virginia and sold into bondage for five years. After his time as a slave had expired, he escaped and found a man of his own kin on the Delaware. Being a scrivener and of scholarly attainments, and because of a desire to indicate the piety and simple manners of the early Swedish settlers as well as the loyalty they felt for the fatherland, he became the correspondent of the colonists to Sweden. One of his letters is here given in full. Moreover, the letter sheds an interesting light upon the educational efforts made by the colonists and it shows how the confidence of the colonists was repaid in that the mother country sent to them, ministers, teachers, and books, even after its jurisdiction over the colony had\n\nceased. “Honored, loving, and much respected friend, John Theling (or Thelin), His Majesty’s loyal subject, and post-master at Gottenberg:\n\nEarly Lutheran Education in Pennsylvania\n\n26\n\n“Your unexpected and welcome letter, dated Gottenberg, 16th Nov., 1692, came to hand the 24th of May, 1693, and made us heartily rejoice that it hath pleased Almighty God, through that young man, Andrew Printz, to make known our condition to our friends in Sweden.

Prominent among this type of members were Daniel and Justis Falckner, the former being instrumental in the establishment of the Lutheran School at Manatawny in 1705.

Roister, an erratic preacher, came in 1694 and held in this same year the first German Lutheran service in\n\nthere\n\nAmerica.^ This did not, however, result in establishing a congregation.\n\nAnthony Jacob Henkel, another pioneer preacher, came as an exile to America in 1717. He first went to New Hanover and visited all the German settlements within reach. He preached in Philadelphia and Germantown, and perhaps was the founder of these two congregations. He replaced the old church at New Hanover, and encouraged the building of a Church in Germantown.s At the time of the death of Henkel, in 1728, John Caspar Stoever, and his son bearing the same name, arrived in Philadelphia. The father soon went to Virginia, while the son remained in Pennsylvania, first making his home at the Trappe and then later at New Holland, and finally in Lebanon County.® Next in order of time was John Christian Schulz. He remained in this country only one year, 1732-1733. During this year he ordained the Stoevers and united the three congregations of Philadelphia, the Trappe, and New Hanover, into one parish and persuaded them to send him and two laymen on a collecting tour to Germany to secure more ministers and teachers and to solicit funds for Churches and schoolhouses.

In northern Europe the Reformation laid stress on the fact that liberty and reason lay at the basis of individual achievement. Since these people had produced\n\nno masterpieces of art or literature before the Christian\n\nand patriotic writings.\n\nIn-\n\ndividuals began to think for themselves, and they\n\nnow\n\nera, they turned to the Bible\n\ndemanded an “enlightened people and\n\nan\n\neducated\n\nclergy.’’\n\nThe Lutherans believed that the Bible should be placed hands of the people, to be for each individual a guide. There was, therefore, an unbounded faith in education, in order that the individual might be brought to in the\n\nan understanding of the principles of the church. Schools, in which the young might be taught sufficient to read and understand the Bible, were regarded almost as important as the church.\n\nGermany were largely influenced by the The man who did more than anyone else to influence the nature of the schools was Martin Luther. He saw clearly the absolute necessity of making the new education effective as the old had been, and accordingly, The\n\nschools of\n\nReformation.\n\nhe resolved to supplant the formal teachings of\n\nRome\n\nEarly Lutheran Education in Pennsylvania\n\n34\n\nwith a rational training of the head and heart.i The building and maintenance of a school was regarded by the Lutherans as a Christian duty. They still retain the German theory of education that the child belongs first to God, then to the parents, then to the State, the chief responsibility of their education resting on Church and parents. Their educational system was pre-eminently a religious one, which looked not only at the intellect, but the soul, and had in mind not only the preparations for life that now is, but for the life to come.^ There were three agencies which Luther could summon to aid in the general educational reform the family, the Church, and the State. “From the Fourth Commandment,” says Luther, “it is obvious :\n\nGod attaches great importance\n\nto obedience to parents, and where not found, there can be neither good morals nor good government, for, where obedience is lacking in the family, no city or principality or Kingdom can be well governed. Family government is the basis of all other government; and where the root is bad, the trunk and branch cannot be good.”3 it is\n\nLuther had a very definite conception of home trainWhile he believed that education should first of all be religious, he did not neglect the value of instruction by the State. When the German immigrants came to America, they brought with them Luther's conception of The practices of the Mother Country were education. brought to this country. While William Penn had a desire to provide a haven for the oppressed people of Europe, he also realized the importance of education in order to make his colony sucing.\n\ncessful.\n\nHe made\n\nprovision for education before the\n\nLutheran people came in any great numbers. The preface to the form of government, in 1682, stated: 1\n\nCubberley, op.\n\ncit.,\n\np. 212.\n\n2 Russell,\n\nGerman Higher\n\n3 Painter,\n\nLuther on Eudcation,\n\nSchools. p. 114.\n\n1425168 Educational Background\n\n35\n\n“That, therefore, which makes a good constitution must keep it, men of wisdom and virtue, qualities that because they descend not with worldly inheritances, must be carefully propagated by a virtuous education of youth for which after ages will owe more to the care and precedence of founders and the successive magistry than to their parents for their private patrimonies.”-! viz:\n\nSection thirteen provided for a committee on education:\n\n“A committee of manners, education, and acts, that all wicked and scandalous living may be prevented, and that youth may be successively trained up in virtue and useful knowledge and acts. ”5 Section twenty-eight provided for a system of vocational education:\n\n“That\n\nall\n\nchildren within this province of the age of twelve\n\nyears, shall be taught some useful trade or\n\nnone may be idle, but the poor may work to they become poor, may not want.”©\n\nThe frame\n\nof\n\nthe end that and the rich, if\n\nskill, to\n\nlive,\n\ngovernment drawn up February 2nd,\n\n1683, provided: “That the Governor and Provincial Council shall erect and order the public schools, and encourage and reward the authors of useful sciences and laudable inventions in the said provinces and territories thereof.”'?\n\nBut Penn granted freedom of\n\nreligion\n\nand permitted\n\nmanner they thought best. Because of this fact education was vested in the hands of the Church and the religious motive predominated. In order to carry out the provisions for education as outlined by Penn in his frame of government, the assembly at Philadelphia, March 10, 1683, passed an important law relating to education: “And to the end that poor as well as rich may be instructed in the people to teach their children in the\n\n4 Colonial Records,\n\nI,\n\np. 31.\n\n5 Colonial Records,\n\nI,\n\np. 34.\n\n6 Colonial Records,\n\nI,\n\n7 Colonial Records,\n\nI,\n\np.\n\np.\n\n40. 44,\n\nEarly Lutheran Education in Pennsylvania\n\n36\n\ngood and commendable learning, which\n\nis to be preferred before persons in this Province and Territories thereof, having children, and all the guardians and trustees of orphans, shall cause such to be instructed in reading and writing, so that they may be able to read the Scriptures and to write by the time they attain twelve years of age, and that then they be taught some useful trade or skill, that the poor may work to live, and rich if they become poor may not want, of which every County Court shall take care.

Even though the Constitution made provision for education, the state seems to have failed to provide the proper schools, for in his speech to the Assembly in 1794, Governor Mifflin emphasized the need for schools, particularly for the poor. He said in part:\n\ntion\n\n“Allow me, therefore, Gentlemen,\n\nupon your consideraby law, as soon as con-\n\nto press\n\ntion the constitutional injunction to provide\n\nmay be, for the establishment of schools throughout the such manner that the poor may be taught gratis.

It discharged this duty until the advent of the public school system. In the period before the middle of the century, the German immigrants settled on the frontier, and were so widely scattered that they could not provide for schools. As a rule the settlers on the frontier were not able to do much more than provide for the necessities, such as food, clothing and shelter. While they recognized the need for schools, education was neglected in this period, except in the few towns and more thickly settled communities. Frequently congregations having itinerant pastors es16 Pennsylvania Archives, Fourth Series, III, p. 646. 16 Pennsylvania Archives, Fourth Series, IV, p. 127. 17 Pennsylvania Archives, Fourth Series, IV, p. 322.\n\nInterior of a Colonial Schoolhouse\n\nEducational Background\n\n39\n\ntablished schools, but were obliged to discontinue because of the poverty of the people.\n\nthem\n\nIn an essay written in 1789 by Benjamin Rush, he said in part: “All the different sects among them (Germans in Pennsylvania) are particularly attentive to the religious education of their children, and to the establishment and support of the Christian religion.

Since the princes were now free from the Church, they were free to develop schools as they saw fit.

Ten years later Brunswick established a similar system. Saxony followed in 1580, Weimar in 1619, and Gotha in 1642. Compulsory education up to the age of twelve was the policy adopted by both Weimar and Gotha as early as 1619. Most of the German states had adopted a state church plan of education by the middle of the seventeenth century. 18 Pennsylvania\n\nGerman\n\nSociety XIX,\n\n19 Cubberly, History of Education,\n\np.\n\np.\n\n398.\n\n78.\n\n20 Cubberly, op.\n\ncit.,\n\np.\n\n562.\n\n2\n\n40\n\nEarly Lutheran Education in Pennsylvania\n\nThe Lutheran Churches in Germany had been accustomed to engage a minister and teacher. Both the teacher and minister received a stated salary and were provided with a home. When these Germans came to America, they tried to carry out the same plan so far as their means permitted. Wherever there was a Church, there usually was a school, which was under the supervision of the Church and proved a valuable aid to the Church. This system established a close relationship between the Church and school. It was, therefore, comparatively easy and natural for the Church to assume the responsibility of conducting schools in America. Lutherans and Reformed frequently united in the building of their Churches, and as soon as they were able, assisted each other in the erecting of separate Churches. Besides the Lutheran and Reformed, or ‘‘Church\n\nwho established most of the schools, the work of education was also carried on particularly by the Moravians, and the Quakers. The belief of the “Church people” in an educated ministry gave them a considerable advantage over the sect people because they had trained leaders. Many of the ministers sent by the Church were trained at Hale, and it was therefore natural for them to advocate religious education. We have seen that the states in Germany from which the immigrants came, had a well developed system of elementary education. The literacy of the German immigrants was relatively high. One study showed that seventy-five per cent, of the males above the age of sixteen could write 2 Another study showed that seventyfour per cent, of the male immigrants in the first half of the eighteenth century were able to sign the Ship Registers, while for the period from 1751 to 1774, eighty-five people,”\n\n.\n\n21 Weber, The Charity School Movement, p. 16. 22 Pennsylvania German Magazine, VIII, p. 306.\n\n*\n\nEducational Background\n\n41\n\nAs German immigrants was\n\nper cent, of the male immigrants were able to write. stated above, the literacy of the relatively\n\nhigh,\n\nilliteracy of\n\nwhen one\n\nEurope during\n\nconsiders\n\nthe\n\nprevailing\n\nand the fact that Germany for more\n\nthis time,\n\nthere were almost incessant wars in than a century. The problem of maintaining the standard of literacy among the Germans as high as that of the\n\nimmigrants challenged the Churches, particularly since the state failed to provide the necessary schools.\n\nAt first the minds of the settlers on the frontier were occupied with matters of more immediate importance than that of providing schools. Life on the frontier presented many difficulties. Houses had to be built, forests cleared, roads built, and fields cultivated. Necessity made education essentially a home education, hence but few schoolmasters were to be found on the frontier. The children learned how to feed and care for the cattle, use the ax, the sickles, and fiail with dexterity. These things were considered of more importance than book knowledge. Gradually the Indians were driven away, and then Churches and schools were established, and the schoolmaster became a member of the community. Because of the poverty of the people, they had diffiand frequently there were not enough teachers.^^ As has been noted there were many different religious sects in Pennsylvania who would not co-operate with the ‘‘Church people,^’ nor would the “Church people’’ co-operate with the sects in matters of education. As a result both the “Church people” and the sects frequently found difficulty in maintaining schools since none of the groups was large enough to support a culty in financing the schools\n\nschool alone.\n\nIn\n\nGermany\n\nchildren were compelled to go to school.\n\n23 Jones, “Old Time Teachers,” 24 Mittelberger, op. cit., p. 62.\n\nI,\n\np. 1.\n\nEarly Lutheran Education in Pennsylvania\n\n42\n\nbut in the absence of such a law the attendance here was consequently irregular. Among the reasons given for not sending the children to school, the factor of distance was one of the greatest difficulties encountered in the\n\nmaintenance of schools.^^ “As to the appointment of general schoolmasters,” says Mr. Boehm, “in this widely extended country, we do not know of a single locality where within a radius of three English miles twenty children of our faith (Reformed) could be gathered together, excepting in Philadelphia and Germantown.se No school in the country can bring enough children together for one to make a living by it. Moreover, the congregations have not the means and are not able at the time being to raise money enough to support anybody ”2 7 In winter, particularly in inclement weather, the dis.\n\ntance to school over poor roads was too far for the younger children, while in the summer the children were kept at home to help with the planting and harvesting of the crops. Those parents who were not concerned about the education of their children found many excuses for not sending their children. They argued that the 26 children were needed at home, they did not want to pay the tuition, the children were too young, or that they could teach them better than what they were taught in school. In spite of the fact that there were many, almost insurmountable difficulties, these early parochial schools played an important role in the educational history of the state.\n\nThe neighborhood newer\n\nlished in the\n\nwere estabwhere there was a\n\nschools or ‘'pay schools’’ settled regions\n\nwide diversity of language and religious belief among the settlers, and where no denomination was strong enough to maintain a school of its own.^s There was a Mittelberger, op. cit., p. 611. 26 Hinke, Life and Letter of J.
