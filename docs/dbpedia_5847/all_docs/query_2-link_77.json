        "text": "Remember when wine was fun?\n\nI was attempting to explain the existential struggles the wine industry is going through in terms of long-term sales and engagement with a diverse demographic and how they could possibly be resolved with my 11-year-old son the other day and he posed an innocent query.\n\nRelated stories: Wineries Overthinking their Marketing Plans How Identity Politics Could Save Wine Matching Wine with Social Media\n\nThe query that prompted first a dismissive guffaw, and then a quasi-intellectual crisis was \"Why don't you guys talk about how much fun you have when you drink wine with your friends at dinner?\"\n\nMiles has indeed witnessed many a merry dinner with friends and family where wine was consumed with gusto, without being discussed or explicated. Wine played a central role in the evening, but everyone was too busy laughing and carrying on to drone on about what climat it was sourced from, or whether it was aged in 100-percent neutral French oak, or if there was a pinch of new in there for spice.\n\nThe wine lit a spark in everyone's eyes, it eased conversation, it allowed even the sturdiest walls to soften, at least for a few hours.\n\nBefore Robert Parker launched a revolution in the way consumers and the trade alike think about and drink or market and sell wine – aside from a very small and specialized slice of the wine-drinking and producing world – that's largely how wine was presented. You know, as an attainable but vaguely glamorous, ethereal thing that made life more fun.\n\nParker's rating system changed the game, and arguably launched multiple movements in the way wine is made and marketed, but also understood.\n\nThere has been a backlash in recent years against Parker and what many see as the overly technical approach to viticulture that he may or may not have intentionally encouraged, but less has been said about the corresponding movement toward education.\n\nTake the WSET, the global leader in drinks education. Its most recent graduation ceremony celebrated a record 695 new graduates, the highest number on record since WSET’s first cohort of diploma graduates in 1969. The previous year, 665 graduates also set a record. No doubt, the number of graduates next year will also set a record. You see where this is going.\n\nWhile few would argue that education and knowledge is a negative thing, there is a growing sense in the industry that we have overintellectualized wine to the point that it is in danger of appearing remote, unattainable and dull as dishwater – the very opposite of the party-starting fun that in its essence, wine should always be.\n\nMake it fun\n\nYou know what isn't fun, sexy or makes people want to buy your products and/or hang out with you? Lectures. Or at least that is how some of the fastest growing wine brands see it.\n\n\"I get it,\" says Jesse Bongiovi, who founded the brand Hampton Water with his rockstar father Jon Bon Jovi and the Languedoc viticultural legend Gérard Bertrand. \"You've farmed your plot of land with its incredible terroir perfectly, you've picked, fermented and aged it perfection, and you want to share every aspect of that story. But a 23-year-old is not going to relate to that. In fact, it may scare or intimidate them.\"\n\nWhen Hampton Water was founded, the Bongiovis knew they wanted to have fun with it, but even they saw the danger early on of getting too invested in the pomp and circumstance inherent in wine culture.\n\n\"It is so easy to get lost in the weeds, especially when you have high ratings rolling in,\" Bongiovi says, acknowledging Hampton Water's many 90-plus ratings from Wine Spectator, et al. \"But we decided early on that we didn't want to tell people to not put ice in their rosé if they wanted to, or drink it in cocktails. Who are we to look down our noses and tell people how they should enjoy something?\"\n\nWhile other brands learned about terroir in college, Hampton Water was busy playing beer pong, Bongiovi explains.\n\n\"It's rosé,\" he says. \"Let's take it to the pool party and not talk about acidity levels. Let's hop on a pool float and have fun, and not drill down into details about the Languedoc.\"\n\nSales numbers seem to support Bongiovi’s approach. As other brands falter and top brands slip, Hampton Water surges, with a growth of 28 percent year-over-year, according to Impact Databank. This year, it is expected to sell 100,000 cases in the US, up from 80,000 last year.\n\nThe emphasis on fun has helped grow Napa's Tank Garage Winery, which was founded in 2014 by wine industry veterans James Harder and Jim Rugusci, with the notion that the rules were made to be, well you know.\n\n\"We're not in the business to just replicate what everyone else is doing,\" says general manager Ed Feuchuk.\n\nInitially, that meant throwing off the constraints that accepted industry wisdom and terroir seemed to impose. The California wine is focused on Napa, which is synonymous of course with Cabernet Sauvignon, but Tank quickly became beloved for bottling California's many other varieties and regions, using a variety of production techniques. But the rebelliousness couldn't be contained in the bottle.\n\n\"It has never been just about the wine,\" Feuchuk says. \"We're into a bunch of cool shit. We don't want people to hear us recite a book report about all the technical aspects of each bottle. Wine is a communal lubricant. It opens a gateway for us to share stories, talk about music and art, wax poetic about life, love and loss.\"\n\nThe education, Feuchuk says, comes almost as an afterthought. Once guests finish laughing about the XXX-rated label for a wine called Skin Flick, they realize they just learned what skin-contact orange wine means. Tank follows the same approach with events.\n\n\"Our community doesn't come to a Tank party to learn about malolactic fermentation, they come to play 90s arcade games, eat fried chicken and listen to a live vinyl DJ,\" he explains, adding that they often leave with a wine club membership and a newly minted taste for Gamay.\n\nAt Valpolicella's Pasqua Wines, the whole point is aggressive conviviality and a sense of world-weariness with the status quo. Finding traction with a younger audience in the US is foundational to brand's consistent growth, says Alessandro Pasqua, president of Pasqua USA.\n\n\"We researched young consumers, and found that Gen Z is very keen on the intersection between art, digital art and products,\" Pasqua says. \"Young generations want wine to be relevant to their interests and the place they live.\"\n\nEverything about their approach comes down to tone, he says.\n\n\"Our style ignites curiosity, which allows us to get their attention and click with them,\" Pasqua explains.\n\nOne of Pasqua's most successful labels, Hey French You Could Have Made This But Didn't, flips the bird at conventional wine culture, blending four vintages in one, and is presented with a label created by CEO Riccardo Pasqua and emerging artist CB Hoyo, who has risen to fame on his own talent, while also questioning the authenticity of canonical artworks. The most successful lines, like 11 Minutes Rosé use rare-to-find-in-the-U.S. grape varieties Corvina and Trebbiano, blended with internationals like Syrah and Carmenere.\n\nThe growth has been prolific, from zero to 400,000 cases in 15 years. Launched in 2009, the US portfolio now brings in three lines totaling 400,000 cases: Pasqua, Famiglia Pasque and Mai Dire Mai.\n\nCollaborate, connect, eco cred\n\nNot every brand will want to bribe old porno producers into letting them use a film strip as a label, as Tank did back in the day. But that doesn't mean they need to put on their Eeyore hats and start sharing alarming stats on pesticide use among conventional grape-farmers, or revealing the levels of residual sugar in their cuvée without being prompted.\n\nIt would be difficult to imagine a more eco-centric winery than the organic and biodynamic Benziger Family Winery in Sonoma, with its herds of sheep and cattle, its insects and birds, all of which are brought in to create a holistic, chemical-free farm. And while brand ambassador Chris Benziger says the team focuses on highlighting the eco-creds on the 85-acre home ranch, he approaches the subject with a show-don't-tell mentality.\n\n\"If done right, education and fun can be one and the same,\" he says. \"Our family mantra is 'education and good times'.\"\n\nBenziger offers a range of tours that showcase their mountain estate and animals, paired with a selection of library wines and locally sourced food pairings. They can get geeky – or not. For Benziger, watching people and their reactions has helped shape the hospitality program.\n\n\"You see a light bulb go off on tour sometimes when they make the connection between seeing regenerative farming and how it increases the quality of our wines,\" he says. \"If you can enlighten someone in a dynamic and fun way, we find they become true and dedicated supporters.\"\n\nMarianne Fabre-Lanvin, who co-founded Souleil Wines with childhood friend Thomas Delaude, says that they decided to create the brand from whole cloth in the image of what brings them joy.\n\n\"Everything from the organic farming, to the lightweight bottles and beautiful labels are reflections of what we value,\" Fabre-Lanvin says. \"It's a very al fresco at the beach, 1970s aesthetic and vibe, with warm colors and affordable, well-made wine that pairs with food. We like to have parties on the beach and drink wine, so we essentially created the perfect wine for that.\"\n\nThey also underlined their commitment to the environment by throwing said beach parties – with a purpose.\n\n\"We didn’t want to lecture people about the importance of ocean preservation,\" Fabre-Lanvin says. \"So we decided to highlight the reality in a fun way with beach clean-up parties.\"\n\nSouleil partners with various nonprofits in and around the beaches they target, announce the cleanup on IG, and welcome people with clean-up tools, and gratis wine and snacks as a thank you. They've held up cleanups in the US, France, Mauritius and Costa Rica, often with dozens of attendees. Next up: Palavas-les-Flots in southern France next month, with proceeds going to Project Ocean Rescue.\n\nOther brands, like Bodega Amalaya in Argentina's Calchaqui Valley, have found that embracing their place, from the terroir to the culture, resonates.\n\nHonoring the land, environment and people has always been part of Amalaya's DNA, co-founder Larissa Ehrbar explains. Recently, they decided to demonstrate that through a wine bar inspired by seasonal ingredients and Argentina's party-style servings of tapas and picadas.\n\n\"It is meant to be a place of conviviality, enjoyed among several people together,\" Ehrbar says. \"We offer lounge areas with sofas, shared tables with long planks for groups.\"\n\nSince opening the wine bar a little over a year ago, the number of visitors has increased by more than 30 percent, and has enabled them to increase brand awareness and reach a wider audience regionally and internationally.\n\nSales are up for a few wineries and down many others, but one recent report from BMO Wine Market provides both room for optimism (71 percent of the 630 wineries surveyed forecast revenue growth for the next year), and caution (52 percent of US consumers 18-34 see moderate drinking is detrimental to health, compared to 39 percent of US consumers overall).\n\nClearly, there will be many wineries that continue or begin to struggle amid changing and challenging conditions. Sure, throwing (genuinely) fun parties and pointing out cute sheep in the vineyard won't automatically translate to sales, but playing flamenco music and babbling about the number of months this SKU stayed in French oak compared to that SKU is clearly not bringing the youngsters the cellar.\n\n\"We wanted to find a way to resonate with younger wine consumers,\" Feuchuk says of Tank's approach. \"Sometimes it takes impromptu punk concerts in our parking lot and a noise ordinance complaint to do that.\""
