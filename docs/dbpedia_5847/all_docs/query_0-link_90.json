        "text": "Nov. 20, 1947: After relinquishing his Greek and Danish titles, the newly renamed Lt. Philip Mountbatten (Matt Smith), 26, marries 21-year-old Princess Elizabeth (Claire Foy) at Westminster Abbey in front of their nearest and dearest — plus 2,000 guests and 200 million BBC Radio listeners. Ever the attention seeker, former (but soon to return) prime minister Winston Churchill (John Lithgow) threatens to steal Elizabeth’s thunder by parading down the aisle just before she processes in with her father, King George VI (Jared Harris). A year later, Princess Elizabeth gives birth to Prince Charles, and nearly two years after that, her first and only daughter, Princess Anne, is born.\n\nOn Set: During Season 1 production, teams of six people worked for six weeks at a time embroidering Elizabeth’s wedding train and dress.\n\nFeb. 6, 1952: Having undergone lung surgery a year earlier, King George continues to decline in health. (Things aren’t looking great for Churchill — who was re-elected as prime minister in 1951 — either as his cabinet members begin to question how much longer the nearly 80-year-old leader should serve.) Princess Elizabeth and Philip are touring the Commonwealth and are in Kenya when King George dies in his sleep at the Sandringham Estate on Feb. 6, 1952. The news reaches Elizabeth and Philip later that day, and they’re forced to fly home, where Princess Elizabeth assumes the title of Queen Elizabeth II much sooner than she imagined, at just 25.\n\n1953: After years of press speculation, the romance between 23-year-old Princess Margaret (Vanessa Kirby) and Peter Townsend, 38, (Ben Miles) — an equerry (a fancy word for assistant) to King George VI and later Queen Elizabeth’s deputy master of the household — is made public. The couple intends to marry, but Margaret needs her sister’s permission to marry the former RAF officer since she’s under 25. Elizabeth asks her sister to wait a year to get engaged, expressing concern that a marriage to the divorced father of two couldn’t be recognized by the Church of England or accepted by the Commonwealth. In the end, due to the establishment’s disapproval, Townsend is appointed air attaché at the British Embassy in Brussels. After all, long-distance relationships aren’t easy at the time.\n\nNovember 1953–May 1954: Ten months after her coronation, Elizabeth and Philip set out on a seven-month round-the-world tour, covering more than 40,000 miles and 13 countries.\n\nOn Set: With its multiple locations and huge scale, Season 1 of The Crown employed 7,000 extras, all of whom had between two and five costumes (and that’s in addition to the 300-350 principal costumes).\n\nNovember–December 1956: Nine years into his marriage, Prince Philip enjoys a five-month Commonwealth tour. Meanwhile, Elizabeth is at home weathering the humiliating fallout of the Suez Crisis and equally embarrassing reports in the press that her husband's bestie and private secretary has been unfaithful to his wife. Philip is tarnished by association and many begin to wonder if he, too, has strayed.\n\nMay 6, 1960: After years of falling for a variety of “wrong” men, Princess Margaret meets the rakish Antony Armstrong-Jones (Matthew Goode), a one-time portrait photographer of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, at a dinner party in 1957. The two begin dating in secret almost immediately and upon unexpectedly receiving Elizabeth’s approval, they marry on May 6, 1960, in the first televised royal wedding at Westminster Abbey. Hurray for Margot!\n\nOn Set: When it came to styling Tony, costume designer Jane Petrie wanted him to be “a really cool, ’60s guy that Margaret would obviously be drawn to — a little bit dangerous, a little bit edgy, anti-establishment.”\n\nJune 5, 1961: It’s a meeting of two global female icons when Jackie Kennedy (Jodi Balfour) accompanies her husband (President John F. Kennedy — you might have heard of him — played by Michael C. Hall) to visit Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace. Upon meeting, the First Lady gives the queen an American-style handshake, rather than the traditional curtsy. While Kennedy is not a British subject and therefore doesn’t have to curtsy to the queen, the formal greeting is considered good manners — and one does greatly appreciate good manners.\n\nOn Set: Since Jackie Kennedy’s style is so well-known, the costume department went to great lengths to re-create her iconic looks. “You need to be [as] authentic and accurate as you can be in the cutting and the making and have that high level of couture that she had,” says Petrie.\n\nJan. 24, 1965: Heading into the mid-’60s, there’s a changing of the guard as Olivia Colman dons Elizabeth II’s crown and Tobias Menzies takes over the role of Prince Philip. In early 1965, Churchill suffers his eighth and final stroke and dies at home nine days later. At what would be the last (and most attended) state funeral until her own in 2022, Queen Elizabeth breaks royal protocol by attending the service, arriving before the former prime minister’s coffin.\n\nOn Set: Series creator Peter Morgan found similarities in Colman’s and Queen Elizabeth’s approaches to their work. “There’s a relatability and a humility,” he says of the Season 3 lead. “And a bit like the queen, she doesn’t overthink it, she just turns up and does it.”\n\nNov. 17, 1965: Princess Margaret (now played by Helena Bonham Carter) takes the US by storm when she and Antony Armstrong-Jones (now going by Lord Snowdon and played by Ben Daniels) take a 14-day trip to the American West. But it’s during a stop in Washington, DC, at the end of their tour that she really gets a chance to shine. Margaret charms President Lyndon Johnson during the black-tie dinner he and Lady Bird Johnson throw for the couple, dancing into the wee hours.\n\nOct. 21, 1966: No chapter in Queen Elizabeth’s life (except perhaps her official response to Princess Diana’s death) more publicly called into question how the royal family should show emotion in the wake of a tragedy. When a mining disaster in a Welsh village leaves 116 children and 28 adults dead, the monarch hesitates to travel to the town, aware her presence might disrupt the rescue operation. Though she shows up in Wales eight days later to offer her sympathies, her failure to act quickly is a decision she regrets for the rest of her life.\n\nApril 1967: After a military coup places a right-wing dictatorship in power in Athens, Prince Philip’s mother — the tortured Princess Alice of Greece (Jane Lapotaire), who spent much of Philip’s youth moving in and out of sanitoriums, and her adult life living in relative poverty — is forced to flee to England, where she takes up residence in a single room in Buckingham Palace for the final two years of her life.\n\nNovember 1967: After devaluing the pound by 14% following years of ignoring the need to adjust the currency’s value, Prime Minister Harold Wilson (Jason Watkins) attempts to reassure the world that the UK is doing just fine by declaring, “This does not mean the pound in your pocket or purse or in your bank has been devalued.” (Isn’t that… exactly what it means?) The obvious and inaccurate spin causes most citizens to question their leader’s understanding of the situation and doubt the UK’s overall strength as a world power.\n\nJuly 4, 1973: Despite Charles’ love for Camilla Shand (Emerald Fennell), his family doesn’t fully approve of the match. While the Prince of Wales is sent off on an eight-month post overseas, arrangements are made for Camilla to marry her on-again, off-again (and one time on with Princess Anne) boyfriend, Andrew Parker Bowles. The news crushes Charles, but this isn’t the end of the Charles-Camilla love story.\n\nMarch 2, 1974: Princess Margaret’s marriage to Lord Snowdon was no stranger to infidelities and fighting, but when photos of the 46-year-old princess cavorting on the beach in Mustique with 28-year-old gardener Roddy Llewellyn (Harry Treadaway) hit the cover of News of the World in 1976, it’s enough to cause husband and wife to separate and eventually divorce in 1978, marking the first senior royal divorce in modern British history. (Spoiler alert: It isn’t the last.)\n\nJuly 29, 1981: After Prince Charles announces his engagement to Lady Diana, showing off her sapphire-and-diamond ring in the garden of Buckingham Palace, a journalist remarks that the 32-year-old Prince of Wales and his betrothed look to be “very much in love.” Charles’ glib response of, “whatever ‘in love’ means” far from reassures his 19-year-old fiancée. But nonetheless, five months later, the couple marries in Westminster Abbey as 750 million people in 74 countries watch around the world. Just another low-key royal wedding.\n\nThe 25-foot-long train of Diana's wedding dress is the most extensive in royal history. “No one had ever seen me in the dress before,” says Corrin of the replica created for the show that took the costume department 14 weeks to design. “And I remember these doors then opened, and… this hush descending over everyone.”\n\nJuly 9, 1982: After successfully breaking into Buckingham Palace earlier that month by shimmying up a drainpipe and helping himself to half a bottle of white wine before having to abruptly leave after he spooks a chambermaid, unemployed laborer Michael Fagan (Tom Brooke) — who’s disillusioned with the government’s lack of assistance and the state of the nation — returns on the morning of July 9, 1982. Fagan slips past security once again and this time enters the queen’s bedroom, waking her only when he disturbs the curtains. After his arrest, Fagan spends the next three months undergoing psychiatric evaluation.\n\nMarch–April 1983: Like so many ill-fated world tours this family has embarked upon over the years, Prince Charles and Princess Diana (and an infant Prince William) set out on a 40-day diplomatic visit to Australia and New Zealand. Diana showcases an array of incredible outfits along the way, but behind the scenes, things take a tense turn as she becomes an enormous hit and Charles feels overlooked.\n\nDecember 1985: As Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage deteriorates after the birth of Prince Harry, Diana plans a surprise present for Charles — a ballet performance to Billy Joel’s “Uptown Girl” during a charity gala at the Royal Opera House. After weeks of rehearsing in secret, the patron of the English National Ballet wows the audience of 2,500 who give her eight curtain calls and a standing ovation — while her husband remains seated in the Royal Box.\n\nAugust 1991: A 30-year-old Diana (now played by Elizabeth Debicki) and 42-year-old Charles (Dominic West) set off on what they’ve told the press to call their “second honeymoon.” Other newspaper headlines reveal that attitudes toward the royal family are changing, with much of the public now believing Elizabeth should abdicate in favor of her son in the near future.\n\nOn Set: To help him connect with the character, West rented a cottage on the now-king’s estate in Cornwall and listened to Charles’ eleven-hour narration of his 2010 book, Harmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World.\n\nJune 1992: Over several months in 1991 and 1992, Princess Diana provides royal reporter and biographer Andrew Morton (Andrew Steele) with hours of secret tape-recorded answers to his questions about her life. Diana’s friend Dr. James Colthurst (Oliver Chris) helps facilitate this by acting as a go-between, bringing Morton’s questions to Diana and her recorded answers to Morton. In June 1992, Morton publishes Diana: Her True Story, and it’s an immediate international bestseller, thanks to details about her marriage, her bulimia, her suicide attempts — and Camilla Parker Bowles. After the book’s release, Morton denies Diana’s participation. Many see through this denial, and the queen and Prince Philip’s sympathies begin to lean toward Charles.\n\nFLASHBACK: Mohamed Fayed (later al-Fayed, played by Salim Daw) is born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1929, and through determination, business acumen and a marriage to sister of Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, he builds a business empire that eventually includes Paris’ Ritz Hotel and the London department store Harrods. He also gets into the film business when his son Dodi (Khalid Abdalla) suggests they produce Chariots of Fire, which goes on to win the Oscar for best picture of 1981. An avid Anglophile, al-Fayed leases the late Duke of Windsor’s Paris home in 1986, overseeing extensive renovations to the villa.\n\n1992: It’s not the best look for the Defender of the Faith when Princess Anne (Claudia Harrison) and Prince Andrew (James Murray) both seek divorces while the dissolution of Charles’ marriage to Diana still dominates the tabloids. Just a few months after her divorce is finalized, Anne announces her engagement to her mother’s former equerry, Cmdr. Timothy Laurence (Theo Fraser Steele); Andrew officially leaves Sarah, Duchess of York (Emma Laird Craig). Photographs of the duchess getting her toes sucked by her financial advisor while on vacation round off an embarrassing period nicely.\n\nNov. 20, 1992: A fire rips through Windsor Castle and destroys 100 rooms and exacts damages at a cost of more than £36.5 million to restore and repair. (The queen has to come up with the cash for 70% of those costs.) During an end-of-year speech commemorating the 40th anniversary of her succession, the queen declares her family’s scandal-ridden year to be her annus horribilis by saying, “1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure.”\n\nJune 29, 1994: To mark the 25th anniversary of Charles’ investiture as the Prince of Wales, Britain’s ITV broadcasts Charles: The Private Man, the Public Role, a two-and-a-half hour interview special during which the prince reveals he was unfaithful to Diana throughout their marriage. Though the program is intended to humanize Charles, public opinion of him plummets. Meanwhile, the same night the special airs, Diana is photographed looking stunning in a low-cut minidress — which will become known as “the revenge dress.”\n\nOn Set: The Crown's costume department recreated many of Diana’s memorable looks, the revenge dress among them. But it wasn’t just the glam stuff — the team enlisted Harvard University to make the ’90s sweatshirt she famously paired with bike shorts and sunglasses.\n\nOctober 1994: In what marks the first and only time an English monarch has set foot on Russian soil, Elizabeth and Philip attend a four-day state visit hosted by Boris Yeltsin (Anatoliy Kotenyov). Prior to the historic trip, the family had declined invitations to the country when it was under Soviet control and also because Prince Philip’s great-aunt Tsarina Alexandra, her husband, Tsar Nicholas, and their five children were assassinated in 1918. Indeed, the duke felt such a connection to the Romanovs that, in 1991, he provides a blood sample to help identify their remains.\n\nNov. 20, 1995: A year after Prince Charles’ ITV interview, Princess Diana sits for a 54-minute chat with Panorama’s Martin Bashir (Prasanna Puwanarajah) in front of 23 million BBC viewers. It later comes to light that Bashir lured Diana into giving the interview by using falsified documents and dozens of false allegations to play on her fears that her life was in danger and that she was being spied on by MI6. Diana’s only stipulation in agreeing to Panorama is to be able to tell the Palace before the episode is announced. During the interview, the princess states that “there were three people in this marriage,” referring to Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, and questions whether her estranged husband is fit to be king. Obviously, Charles is not happy.\n\nAug. 29, 1996: Four years after they separate, and nine months after Queen Elizabeth urges the couple to divorce, Charles and Diana make it official. Diana reaches an agreement with The Firm that includes a lump sum and annual payments to run her household. She retains her apartments at Kensington Palace and her title of Princess of Wales and relinquishing the title of Her Royal Highness and any future claims to the British throne.\n\n1997: As Major’s popularity tanks, that of his Labour-party rival, Tony Blair (Bertie Carvel), skyrockets. He and his party ride the wave of youth culture popularity and win in a landslide, with even Conservative-backed newspapers switching their support to Labour for the first time. Sadly for the queen, the election of a Labour Party PM means her beloved Royal Yacht Britannia is officially decommissioned. Though Blair then proposes a privately financed replacement, the queen does not take to the idea.\n\nJuly 11, 1997: Eager to show William (Rufus Kampa) and Harry (Fflyn Edwards) some summer fun, Diana jets off on holiday to France with the boys — a bonus is she’ll be out of town for Camilla’s upcoming 50th birthday bash too. Luckily, Mohamed al-Fayed has invited them to spend some time at his 10-acre estate above the sea at Saint-Tropez. A few days later, Dodi arrives, and life on the Fayeds’ recently purchased £15 million, 140-foot yacht, The Jonikal, begins. [Dodi’s fiancée, Kelly Fisher (Erin Richards) follows him to France, but is forced to stay on a different yacht.]\n\nAug. 12, 1997: Nothing beats the Scottish countryside as a photo shoot backdrop. While Charles and the boys are holidaying in Balmoral, Charles’ press team comes up with the idea that he and his sons should pose for press photos, securing a narrative about stability to counter Diana’s perceived frivolous jet-setting. Charles dons a kilt for the photo op on the banks of the River Dee. William does not, and is rather reluctant to take part. Down in Derbyshire, Diana arrives in a Harrods helicopter for a visit with her psychic Rita Rogers (Sandra Hale).\n\nAug. 24, 1997: Clad in a turquoise bathing suit, Diana lounges on the end of The Jonikal’s diving board, her legs dangling over the Mediterranean as a lone seagull swoops overhead. What should have been a peaceful moment becomes an iconic shot when a paparazzi captures it on camera: Just a day later, on Aug. 25, photos are published everywhere around the world. If “going viral” had been a thing in the ’90s, this moment would’ve been the epitome of the term.\n\nOn Set: The yacht used on set was a real contemporary yacht, so to make it look like it was from the ’90s, the set decorators had to bring in fabric, pictures, and paintings from that decade. “We had to make it a little less on point in terms of proper superyacht decor today,” head set decorator Alison Harvey tells Tudum. “So we kitsched it up a little bit by taking it back in time and just tried to add nods to Mohamed’s world a bit more.”\n\nAug. 30, 1997: Diana and Dodi make plans to return to the UK, but ultimately change their minds and decide to make a quick stop in Paris on the way. They trade in the ocean blues for the city lights, looking in at Villa Windsor before they head to the Ritz hotel. In Paris, Dodi makes a visit to luxury jewelers Repossi to check out rings for Diana, as she’d previously pointed out one by the brand that she liked. Later that evening, the couple meets to eat dinner at the Ritz. They soon retire to the Imperial Suite, planning to leave soon after to return to Dodi’s flat for the night. Given the press scrutiny, Dodi informs his security team of a plan to leave the hotel unseen.\n\nMeanwhile — believing he’s off duty — Henri Paul (Yoann Blanc), the Ritz’s acting head of security who had been driving Diana and Dodi around that day, enjoys some drinks at the hotel bar. On hearing the couple wants to leave, he tries to lose the paps by announcing at the main entrance to the hotel that Dodi and Diana will be out in 10 minutes. He then sneaks them out a back exit. The veteran paparazzi, however, aren’t fooled.\n\nAug. 31, 1997: In the early minutes of the morning, Dodi and Diana leave through a back exit of the Ritz, hoping to evade the paparazzi. They’re unsuccessful, and soon photographers on motorcycles and in cars are racing after them through the Parisian streets. The chase intensifies as the couple approaches the Pont de l’Alma tunnel. Around 12:23 a.m. CET, a passerby hears a crash from within the tunnel and calls for medical attention.\n\nAug. 31, 1997: Back at Balmoral, the castle wakes to the sound of the phone. Elizabeth, Philip, and Charles receive the news that Dodi and driver Henri Paul (Yoann Blanc) have died instantly in a car crash in Paris, while Diana is still alive but in critical condition. By 3:15 a.m. BST, Elizabeth, Philip, and Charles are informed that Diana has also been pronounced dead. Charles decides to let his sons sleep, waiting to tell them the news later in the morning. He goes for a walk alone around Balmoral.\n\nAug. 31, 1997: Charles arrives in Paris to reclaim the body around 4 p.m. After spending time with Diana at the hospital, the prince accompanies the hearse through the streets of Paris, where mourners crowd the streets to pay their respects. At Balmoral, the queen does her best to shelter the boys from the world’s reaction to their mother’s death, removing all newspapers from their sight and keeping them away from the television. One day later, Dodi’s funeral takes place at Regent’s Park Mosque.\n\nSept. 6, 1997: Preceding Diana’s funeral at Westminster Abbey, Philip, Charles, William, Harry, and Charles Spencer (Philip Cumbus) join in a one-hour, 47-minute procession from Kensington Palace to the abbey, passing Buckingham Palace on the way. More than 1 million people line the streets of London, crying over the loss of the “people’s princess.” William and Harry walk in the procession, during which Philip talks to his oldest grandson under his breath in an effort to keep him calm. On top of the coffin, alongside three wreaths of white flowers, sits a letter addressed to “Mummy.”\n\nNov. 20, 1997: Soon after the death of his mother, Princess Diana, William returns to boarding school, keen to get back to some form of normalcy. But there’s not much chance of a quiet life with girls around the country and beyond becoming increasingly infatuated with the teenage prince. A frenzied era dubbed “Willsmania” kicks off. Back at the palace, the queen and Philip are celebrating 50 years of marriage with a commemorative event that includes an official photo at Buckingham Palace, a thanksgiving service at Westminster Abbey, and lunch at the Royal Naval College in Greenwich. On arrival at the Royal Naval College, William is treated like a pop star as the crowds go crazy.\n\nMarch 24, 1999: In response to human rights abuses that are being perpetrated against the ethnic Albanian population in Kosovo, NATO forces initiate an air war against Serbia. Tony Blair — whose popularity has been on the rise since Diana’s death — is one of the strongest proponents of the offensive, emphasizing the humanitarian necessity of intervention. The bombing lasts 78 days, ending on 10 June after the Yugoslav government agrees to withdraw. Blair’s actions give Britain increased authority on the world stage, and his popularity levels at home soar. At the 2001 general election, Labour is reelected in a landslide victory.\n\nJune 21, 2000: Soon after his birthday, William sits his A-level exams at Eton, earning an A in geography, a B in history of art, and a C in biology. He applies to the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and is accepted to study history of art but decides to take a gap year before continuing his studies. He spends most of August 2000 to June 2001 abroad, volunteering with a Raleigh International expedition in Chile and traveling around Africa, among other places.\n\nSeptember 2001: Starting at uni is a crazy time for anyone, but even more so if you’re a royal. William receives a lot of attention as he arrives on campus, but he meets a fellow student by the name of Kate Middleton who’s also studying art history. They share lecture notes and get to know one another, but both date other people initially. It’s still an overwhelming time for William, and by Christmas he’s contemplating whether he should continue at St. Andrews. Ultimately, he decides to persevere with his classes but switches to studying geography.\n\nFeb. 9, 2002: Between February 1998 and March 2001, Margaret suffers multiple strokes. The first is reasonably mild and occurs when she’s on vacation in Mustique in 1998. After a short stay in a hospital in Barbados, she flies home two days later for further tests, rest, and rehab. Margaret makes some lifestyle changes and a slow recovery. A year later, the princess is back in Mustique and having a bath when she scalds her feet in hot water. Unable to walk due to her burnt soles, she returns to the UK in a wheelchair. Despite enjoying a glitzy 70th birthday party at the Ritz in October 2000, her recovery is short-lived. The princess endures a second confirmed stroke in January 2001 and then a third in March 2001. Margaret’s fourth and final stroke takes place two days before her death on Feb. 9, 2002. She’s the first senior royal to be cremated since the Middle Ages, making that choice because there wasn’t enough space for a coffin, and this meant she could be buried alongside her father (and her mother and sister in the future).\n\nMarch 27, 2002: During a nonprofit event at St. Andrew’s University, Kate dons a sheer slip dress designed by a fellow student and struts her stuff on the catwalk, making quite the impression on a smitten William. Romance begins to blossom between the pair, and five months later the prince moves into a house on Hope Street with three other roommates — one of whom is Kate.\n\nJune 1–4, 2002: Elizabeth enjoys a weekend of jubilee celebrations, marking 50 years on the throne. On the final day of festivities, the queen travels in the ornate Gold State Coach from Buckingham Palace to St. Paul’s for a jubilee service, followed by a Guildhall luncheon, during which Blair tells her, “Deference may be inherited but affection is earned, and the affection this country feels for you is real.” After lunch, the royal family wave to the crowds from the palace balcony, with William joining the family for the photo op — much to the adoring crowd’s pleasure.\n\nJan. 6, 2004: A police inquiry is launched into the cause of Princess Diana and Dodi’s deaths. As part of the investigation, Charles is questioned at Clarence House for several hours about events leading up to his ex-wife’s death. The results are published in 2006 and include the findings that Diana was not pregnant at the time of her death and that the driver, Henri Paul, was more than twice over the legal drink-drive limit. The inquiry finds that the British establishment is not responsible for the deaths of Diana and Dodi. Mohamed al-Fayed calls the royals a “dracula family” in the press.\n\nJan. 7, 2005: Prince Harry and Prince William attend a “native and colonial” themed costume party to which Harry decides to dress in an Afrika Korps costume with a swastika armband. Of course, a partygoer snaps a pic of the prince on his phone, and soon images of Prince Harry wearing a swastika on his arm are slapped across the front pages of the papers, causing major embarrassment for the royals two weeks before Holocaust Memorial Day. Clarence House issues an apology on behalf of the 20-year-old prince, saying: “I am very sorry if I have caused any offense or embarrassment to anyone. It was a poor choice of costume.” As punishment, Harry is sent to Home Farm to muck out pigs for the rest of the month.\n\nAfter Charles asks for the queen’s blessing to marry Camilla, Elizabeth meets with the Lord Bishops, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Bishop of Salisbury to seek advice. She grants Charles his wish to wed, and, decades later than he would’ve hoped, it’s royal wedding bells once more for Charles! The longtime lovers marry in a civil ceremony at Windsor Guildhall. Though the queen doesn’t attend the ceremony, she does go to the church blessing that follows at St. George’s Chapel and hosts the buffet reception at Windsor Castle’s State Apartments. Elizabeth even makes a toast to the newlyweds, joking that announcing the winner of the Grand National is actually the important news of the day. Winners all round.\n\nOn Set: Filming Charles and Camilla’s wedding required the most cast present on set of any day of the entire production. Twenty cast members were there for one scene, alongside 450 supporting artists."
