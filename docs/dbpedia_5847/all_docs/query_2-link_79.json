        "text": "arming is more than just an occupation, its a way of life. Long hours and hard work are not just in the job description, they are the job.\n\nThose who enter the industry  either by choice or tradition  do so with the understanding that farming can be a thankless profession, often the only reward being the sweat of their brow and the dirt on their hands.\n\nThe Putnam County agricultural community came together Saturday morning to honor the 2021 inductees for Farmer of the Year, Rick Oliver, and Friend of the Farmer, Larry Parker, during the annual Ag Day Breakfast.\n\nThe morning began as anyone who has been to one of these functions might expect, with food and coffee and catching-up, followed by recognitions, announcements, and a special program by South Putnam FFA members Catherine Hodge and Jacob Beadles.\n\nThere were no Ag Day festivities the last two years, and the inductees were honored privately, but on this cold Saturday morning, the air was electric with the understanding that tradition carries on.\n\nAg Day Committee members Jenna Nees and Steve Cash concluded the breakfast by presenting the Hall of Fame awards to Parker and Oliver.\n\nBeginning in 1990, the Friend of the Farmer award has been given to those who have made outstanding contributions to the agricultural community in Putnam County. Whether its financial, technical or educational expertise, the culminating result is the same: dedication. Ultimately, this is the criteria by which the nominating body honors the recipient, and Parker fits squarely into that mold.\n\nBorn in 1943, Parker was raised on a farm just north of Fillmore. He spent eight years working for IBM in Greencastle while simultaneously renting and eventually purchasing 700 acres in the early 1970s.\n\nParker and his family raised corn, soybeans, cattle and hogs before expanding into aggregate mining in the mid-1980s with his business, Parker Stone & Gravel Inc., which he operated until 2004.\n\nOver the years, Parker has dabbled in various fields from farming to truck driving, glazier work and carpentry, having built four houses from the ground up. He was on the board of directors of both the Little Walnut Conservancy as well as Midland Co-Op.\n\nHe currently serves on the Putnam County Council with involvement in numerous committees and is a member of the Antique Tractor and Machinery Association.\n\nToday the Larry and wife Marilyn live on their daughter and son-in-laws 55-acre farm, helping with their cattle operation and restoring antique tractors.\n\nThe Farmer of the Year Award has been given to families and individuals since 1983 for their relentless devotion to not only the agricultural community, but the greater Putnam County community as well. Dedicating their lives to raising crops and livestock, as well as contributing to youth programs like 4-H, these people are the backbone of our society.\n\nOperating one of the last dairy farms in Putnam County, Oliver has been a mainstay of the industry for his entire life. Growing up working on his familys farm, Oliver eventually took over, expanding operations in the 80s to keep pace with industry, and again in 2004. At its height, Olivers farm was milking 240 cows.\n\nHe has also been an active member of FFA and 4-H programs, participating in contests and eventually judging dairy cattle years later.\n\nHis community involvement is second to none, especially when you consider the time commitment required to operate a dairy farm. This demand, however, did not stop the Olivers from engaging with members of their community, from touring elementary school classes around their farm, to lending numerous animals for FFA, 4-H and Ag Day events.\n\nA soft-spoken man, Rick isnt much for accolades, saying, If I had known I was getting an award, I wouldnt have shown up. This whole thing has been very humbling.\n\nFrom the struggles and triumphs that come with being a farmer; to meeting his wife Lana and their 42 years of marriage, Oliver recounted memories from years gone by, at times holding back tears.\n\nDairy has been a good business he said.\n\nRick and Lana are currently milking 60 cows on their farm.\n\nThe Farmer/Farm Family of the Year has been awarded since 1983. The past winners include: 1983-Ezra and Worth Arnold, 1984-Franklin and Eva Torr, 1985-Doris and Clova Salsman, 1986-Leonard and Gertrude Mann, 1987-Jack and Ella Marie Torr, 1988-Ed and Barbara Brookshire, 1989-Bill and Helen Hurst, 1990-Noble and Edith Fry, 1991-Bill and Ruth Wright, 1992-Paul and Ruth Carrington, 1993-Bob and Joan Rissler, 1994-Max Nichols, 1995-John and Marjorie Cash, 1996-Bill and Jean Rowings,1997-James and Lillian Price, 1998-Morris and Jacque McGaughey, 1999-Kenneth and Marlene Ames, 2000-John and Grace Torr, 2001-Morris and Wanda Hurst, 2002-Alice Cantonwine, 2003-Byron and Caroline Gough, 2004-Fred and Linda Mann, 2005-Larry and Elizabeth Jones, 2006-Virgil and Loretta Arnold, 2007-Mark and Phyllis Legan, 2008-Keith Berry, 2009-Mike and Sandy Rissler, 2010-Ron and Jane Alcorn, 2011-Jack Berry, 2012-Gene and Alice Beck, 2013-Dale McGaughey, 2014-Larry Gottschalk, 2015-Harl Peters, 2016-Phil and Janice Fry, 2017-Ron and Sherry Cash, 2018-Rodger and Paula Sutherlin, 2019-Eugene Summers, 2020-Abe Hodgen, 2021-no award; 2022-Rick Oliver.\n\nThe Friend of the Farmer was first awarded in 1990.
