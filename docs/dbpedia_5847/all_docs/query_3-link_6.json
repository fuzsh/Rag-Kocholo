Eunice Farnsworth circa 1759; d. 1818 at Brooksville, Mass (Now Maine).\n\nIn the \"History of Castine, Penobscot, and Brooksville, Maine:...\"[2](Page 216 in particular), Oliver figures prominently. That gives his birthdate and place as Worcester 1738, which must be in error. There are too many overlaps with this Oliver for it not to be him. The marriage of his daughters to Wasson's, the number of children, that these children - identified as born in Groton - are all marrying in the area, and so forth all serve to link this Oliver to the one born in Groton in 1733.\n\nThat states that he was a loyalist, appointed as a Justice of the Peace for Worcester County by King George, who moved to St. John, New Brunswick for about 10 years, during the revolution, where he was engaged in mercantile business. He moved to Castine (Maine - at the time still Massachusetts) in 1784. At the first town meeting in 1787 and for several subsequent years, he was chosen selectman. He was elected Deacon in 1798, but declined the job the following year. In 1801 he was charged with misappropriation of funds in his own courthouse, although that does not seem to have gone anywhere.\n\n\"Judge Parker was twice married, and brought up a family of three sons and four daughters. Two of the latter married John and Samuel Wasson, of Brooksvile\".[2]\n\nHe died in Brooksville in 1818.[2]\n\nA Book search for Oliver Parker in Maine yields a number of other Oliver Parkers post 1818, primarily in Frankfort Maine, not far away. These would appear to be in reference to his son \"v.\" below.\n\nA preview of \"The Essex Genealogist\" Volumes 14-15 - Page 167 reads: \"Oliver Parker was cashiered for defrauding his men of their wages by false returns, imposing on the commissary and drawing supplies for more men than were in ... Oliver and which was the loyalist who moved to NH, New Brunswick and Maine.\" It is unclear whether this is a treatise comparing the two Olivers or a reference to this one. A lookup of this reference would be helpful.\n\nHe is confused at present with Oliver Parker. It should be noted that that Oliver had 11 children with Jane Nutting.\n\nKnown children of Oliver Parker and Eunice Farnsworth all b. at Groton, Middlesex, Massachusetts, were as follows:\n\ni.

He was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Worcester County, by King George, shortly after he had attained his majority. During the war of the Revolution, he was an active loyalist. 'He became very offensive to his neighbors, in consequence of his adherence to the Crown of England, and was, on this account, obliged to leave his native country, when peace was declared. He went to St. John, New Brunswick, where he resided some ten years. While there, he was engaged in mercantile business, and accumulated considerable property, which he is said to have lost through the dishonesty of his partner in business. Mr. Parker moved to Castine in 1794, and bought the farm now owned by Mr. Alexander G. Perkins. About the year 1800, he was appointed by Governor Strong, Judge of the Court of Common Pleas. This office he held nearly fifteen years. Judge Parker was much interested in religious matters, and was instrumental in having the meeting-house built at North Castine—then Penobscot. He was a member of Reverend Mr. Mason's church, and, for a short time, was one of the deacons. From 1787 to 1790, and again in 1792, he was chosen one of the Board of Selectmen of Penobscot. It is related of him, that, being inveigled by others into some iniquitous transaction, he was brought as a prisoner before the bar of the very Court over which he had once presided. The finding of the Court in his case we do not know ; but it is claimed that whatever this may have been, he was free from intentional wrong-doing. Judge Parker was twice married, and brought up a family of three sons and four daughters. Two of the latter married John and Samuel Wasson, of Brooksville. Judge Parker died in Brooksville, in the year 1818, aged about eighty years.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Birth: \"Massachusetts, Town Clerk, Vital and Town Records, 1626-2001\"\n\nciting Birth, , Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth, Boston; FHL microfilm 007011182.\n\nFamilySearch Record: QG1K-V7YJ (accessed 21 March 2023)\n\nFamilySearch Image: 3QS7-L979-4GSK Image number 00515\n\nOliver Parker born on 15 Oct 1733 in Groton, Middlesex, Massachusetts, United States.\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 Wheeler George Augustus. 1875.
