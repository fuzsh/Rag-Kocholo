        "text": "Left Legacy Of Grace, Resilience And Compassion\n\nThursday, August 8, 2024\n\nHelen Marie Brodersen (Marie) passed away at her residence on August 2, 2024.\n\nShe was born on May 24, 1936, in Endicott, New York, to Albert Glenn Brenchley and Martha Grace King. The family soon moved to Meshoppen, Pennsylvania, when her father bought a working dairy farm.\n\nShe was the oldest daughter, and with three older brothers and four younger siblings, they learned a lot about working together from a very young age.\n\nMarie researched and found Philadelphia Boarding Academy, where she could participate in their work-study program and support herself through school. After graduation, she enrolled in another work-study program at Madison College, where she was accepted into the nursing program, a dream she had embraced since the age of five. During her time there, she met Clyde P. Holland, and together they raised five children. She became a first-generation college graduate, an accomplishment she was deeply proud of.\n\nMarie is survived by her children, Clyde Parker Holland Jr. (Rena), Dean Mitchell Holland (Becky), Deryl Lee Holland (Noelle), Carolyn Holland Botkin (Jerry) and Christina Grace Kunkle (Garth); her grandchildren, Clyde Parker Holland III, Timothy Tyler Holland, Breanna Holland Bernarducci, Harrison Mitchell Holland, Hamilton Dean Holland, Cecily LaDelle Holland, Caleb Andrew Holland, Joshua Lee Holland, Micah Allen Holland, Kristin Marie Ailer, Mary Kaitlyn Hutchinson, Joseph Hunter Shomo II, Benjamin Matthew Kunkle and Danika Grace Kunkle; great-grandchildren, Felix Raphael Bernarducci, Max Iver Scrimshire, Dakota Rey Scrimshire, Lennox Marie Ailer, Sutton Grace Hutchinson, Blayke Makenna Hutchinson, Abel Wayne Ailer, Jack William Ailer, Libbie Ellen Ailer, Logan Claire Hutchinson and the highly anticipated newest addition, AKA “Rutherford Thunder Cruze Holland,” due in September.\n\nShe is also survived by siblings, Donna Moyer (John), June Spencer (Joe), Glenda Spencer (Steve), Wallace Brenchley, Fae Byers, Jack Vaow and Dora Oliver (Ray).\n\nShe was predeceased by husbands, Clyde P. Holland Sr. and Raymond H. Brodersen (Ray); stepfather, Frances Vaow; brothers, Glenn Brenchley, James Brenchley, William Brenchley, John Brenchley, Kenneth Vaow and Robert Vaow.\n\nLater in life, Marie married Ray Brodersen and enjoyed many great years in the Brodersen family, which includes Raymond Brodersen Jr. (Ray), Judith Winters (Judy) and James Brodersen (Jim).\n\nWith a servant’s heart, Marie loved volunteering at the Samaritan Center and Prison Ministries. She was a Daughter of the American Revolution, Philadelphia Academy alumna, Madison alumna, an active member in her church Sabbath School, the Bereavement Committee, the Adventist Retired Workers Club and the African Violet Society. Marie found great joy in tending her garden, feeding her backyard birds, attending group exercise classes and socializing with cherished friends.\n\nHer happy place was the ocean—looking for pretty shells at sunrise, the sound of seagulls, watching the rolling waves and sunset walks. Each year, she eagerly anticipated her birthday tradition of “having all her babies back in the nest” for a long and luxurious weekend of birthday festivities at the beach, making new memories with her adult children.\n\nA memorial service will be held at the Collegedale Seventh-Day Adventist Church on Saturday, Aug. 10, at 4 p.m. All are welcome.\n\nShe can best be remembered by her infectious smile, her willingness to help in any situation, and the kindness she showed to all in the community. She is greatly loved by her family, her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, who will miss GG spending time with them.\n\nMarie leaves a legacy of grace, resilience and compassion for us to follow.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to the Samaritan Center or Prison Ministries in her memory.\n\nVisit www.chattanoogavalleyviewchapel.com to share condolences and memories.\n\nArrangements and care entrusted to the Valley View Chapel of Chattanooga Funeral Home."
