        "text": "Shelby County Texas\n\nTranscribed by Ray Jackson & John Warner January 30, 2000\n\nTake Highway 96 North to County Road 2026, turn left and the cemetery is on private property about 4 miles on the left side of the road. The first to be buried in this cemetery was Nancy Richardson Parker. It is believed the Parker Family owned this land and later married into the Oliver Family. The Windham Family purchased the property sometime after 1906 and left the cemetery as it was found, and upon the death of William Clayton Windham an area was marked for burial of the Windham Family."
