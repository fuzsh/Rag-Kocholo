        "text": "About me\n\nHello there! I'm Oli - a freelance performer, composer and producer. I have just completed my fourth/final year studying BMus music technology at Royal Birmingham Conservatoire. I like working in multiple styles and areas of music: I studied classical trumpet & trombone and perform in three bands. I have also mixed and mastered professional studio albums ranging from classical to folk and enjoy collaborating with other musicians around the world creating original compositions. Examples of my performance, composition and production work are available on my Instagram: @oliparker_music. Don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or would like me to be a part of your next project, cheers!"
