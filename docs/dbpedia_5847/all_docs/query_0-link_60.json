The reason they used lead, to be totally honest, is because nothing happens to it,” App said during Monday’s City Council meeting. “Unfortunately, reality has come back to get us a little bit. We’re all trying to get rid of it, and when we talk about lead we talk about Flint. Flint was the genesis of the entire thing.”\n\nThat genesis has since led to the Environmental Protection Agency creating a deadline and requiring that all 50,000 community water systems complete and submit inventory of their lead service lines by midnight Oct. 16, according to Electroscan’s website. The company takes it so seriously, that it has a clock ticking off a countdown by seconds of how much time remains.\n\nThere are some half a million lead pipes within the 60 counties in New York State, App said, and the Department of Health has issued grants to help municipalities, including Batavia, complete this task during the next two and a half months.\n\nElectroscan will mail out a letter to Batavia residents informing them that the company will be making a visit, City Manager Rachael Tabelski said.\n\n“It wasn't random samples. It was actually particular homes where we believe lead could be. So if you do get a letter asking you to participate, we strongly advise it right now. There more than likely isn't going to be high levels of lead coming out of your water system. However, the change over to Monroe County Water, that is the issue,” she said of the city’s future plan to make a switch to the new water source. “Not only is it good to get the lead out in general, but right now, you kind of have enough scale built up where you're not having pieces of lead not coming into your water.\n\n\"However, when we do the water and the source change, that's a whole different story, and we will need to have either chemical mitigation of the water coming in or elimination of all wet pipes in the city to make sure all our residents are safe,\" she said. \"So it's a process.”\n\nFor anyone not familiar with the water crisis in Flint a decade ago, the city changed its municipal water supply source from the Detroit-supplied Lake Huron water to the Flint River, and that switch caused water distribution pipes to corrode and leach lead and other contaminants into municipal drinking water.\n\nAlthough there hadn’t been issues with the city’s current water source, that introduction of new water created a crisis that reportedly exposed tens of thousands of Flint residents to dangerous levels of lead and outbreaks of Legionnaire disease that killed at least 12 people.\n\nBatavia management doesn’t want to disturb the apple cart in any such way while planning on a switch to Monroe County Water Authority. They are looking for citizens to help out by responding to the letter if they receive one and making an appointment.\n\nTo view a video about how Swordfish works to detect lead pipes on a property, go HERE.\n\nThere are three ways to schedule an inspection with the company, and these options will be provided in letters being sent out to city property owners.\n\nThey are:\n\n1. Scan the QR code.\n\n2. Visit Electroscan’s website.\n\n3. Call the Electroscan Swordfish Help Line at 315-856-3156 and speak to a customer service representative to book an appointment.\n\nAfter seven months of converting a gym into a colorful multi-generational nightclub vibe—tanning rooms are now selfie rooms, lockers have been replaced with a fun space to splatter, plus laser tag and glow ball areas—House of Bounce owners Pasquale and Justina Rapone debuted their new location during a grand unveiling Wednesday in downtown Batavia.\n\nLabeling it a \"Family Fun Center,\" Justina shared her excitement with family, friends and community members during a ribbon-cutting in front of the new site at the corner of Main and Jackson streets.\n\n“We wanted this location to be somewhere where you can come on a Friday or a Saturday with your kids, and if you have kids that are real little, and you have some older kids, you guys can all come and have fun,” she said. “Maybe you’ve got a family that you guys always hang out with, and you want to meet up, and the adults can hang out, and the kids can play. We wanted to make it a space where everyone can kind of join together in the community. And also, we wanted it to be a place for the kids to come and have fun, and stay out of trouble.\n\n“So we started at the Harvester, and … we’re in the downtown area, which is huge. We're super excited. We brought a lot of new things in at our new location,” she said. “You don't have to drive to Buffalo or Rochester, you can come here for an hour before you go grab lunch. We added laser tag, a glow golf. We added Laser Maze. We still have our splatter room. We also have all of our open play stuff, like we always have bumper cars and the selfie room, so we really have everything for everybody.\"\n\nHouse of Bounce opened at Harvester Center more than two years ago before the couple decided to rent the downtown space in December, toiling away in preparation for a soft opening about two weeks ago and a bigger grand opening celebration this week.\n\nAnd by bigger, it’s 12,000 square feet, so the footprint has grown quite a bit, Rapone said.\n\nThat’s an impressive piece of business news, Genesee County Chamber of Commerce President Brian Cousins said, especially when it fits so well into the downtown scene.\n\n“To see a business expand and grow in their pursuit of prosperity is very exciting. House of Bounce, I believe, fits one of those niche needs for families in creating a memorable outing that is highly creative in product offerings,” Cousins said. “In touring their facility, they have put together a slate of activities that is attractive for a wide array of ages in a location that can also positively impact other adjacent businesses. It was inspiring to see the creativity and thought that they put into each of the areas.”\n\nThere are two levels of entertainment for all ages, Rapone said, with an upper level for the little ones and downstairs for older kids.\n\n“It’s needed so much. There's so many kids around here that, you know, for years, didn't really have anywhere in the Batavia area to go, especially Genesee County itself,” she said. “So we really are excited to bring something in for all these kids to do. Come in, have fun, have a family outing right here in town without having to go to Buffalo and Rochester.”\n\nSo why the move after being so successful on the city’s east end? Due to the success, “we ran out of space for growth,” she said, “and we felt like moving into the downtown area was kind of the place to be.”\n\nNow that they are part of the Business Improvement District, the business owners plan to participate in BID events, such as Christmas in the City, the Halloween trick-or-treats at each business, and annual cider and wine walks, she said. Other perks are “all the things that downtown has to offer, plus the traffic through here, and it’s just a great place to be seen.”\n\nWithin the set hours of the facility, people can just walk in and use it, there’s no need to make a reservation, unless it’s to book the party room, which accommodates up to 70 guests. That’s a change from the Harvester location, Rapone said.\n\n“We were doing full facility shutdowns at the last place, and now we've just kind of outgrown that. We have too many people we're turning away on the weekend. So now it's just, if we're open, come in, no need for a reservation,” she said. “You can book right on our website.

I’ve had discussions with Jason previously about the app; I have not been satisfied with the outcome of those conversations. I think overall Jason is an approachable person, who generally does take action when he feels it’s required, I’m just not sure what they will decide with this,” Trombley said Tuesday to The Batavian. “I currently have two students in the district, and all throughout last year I was unable to get any communications from the app. I have called the schools individually and asked to speak with teachers and have absolutely been denied that ability and told all communication is through the app. I have requested paper copies of forms and so on, and have also been denied those from time to time with the statement ‘it’s on the app, you have to do it on the app.’”\n\nThe Batavian also reached out to Smith with followup questions about the matter.\n\nYou said that teachers should be responding to parents wanting to talk to them, so why was (Trombley) complaining, and why do you think the breakdown is that he and apparently others may believe it's only to be done via the parent app?\n\n“Our admin and teachers are always available to speak to our families and community members individually — ParentSquare has not changed that. ParentSquare does provide a single communication tool for our families, schools, and district, but that is not the only means,” Smith said. “All staff members still utilize email, while ParentSquare is another option for direct communication via its messaging tool based on a parent’s preference. ParentSquare is used to post messages, urgent alerts, and general updates, and has been well-received by our families and staff.\n\n“No system is perfect and we are continually looking for ways to refine our use of this tool. We just completed our first year as a district using ParentSquare, and while I'm thrilled with the progress, of course there are always ways we can improve, and we intend to do so,” Smith said. “Our newly hired Director of Educational Technology Wendy Villone has prior experience with ParentSquare, and we look forward to her expertise as well. I want to point out a few other positive elements about ParentSquare that we’ve experienced during our first year of use.”\n\nThose elements include:\n\nUnified Communication Platform: ParentSquare has streamlined our communication process by consolidating various channels into one platform. This integration has reduced confusion and improved efficiency for both staff and families.\n\nIncreased Reach: We're able to connect with 97% of our parents and guardians district-wide through ParentSquare. This level of reach was previously unattainable with traditional communication methods. For the remaining 3%, we've identified alternative ways to ensure they receive important information.\n\nEnhanced Equity: The platform's automatic translation feature, supporting more than 100 languages, has significantly improved our ability to communicate with non-English speaking families. This feature ensures that all parents, regardless of their primary language, can access and understand important school information.\n\nReal-Time Updates: The platform's immediate notification system ensures that parents receive timely information about school events, sports practices, emergencies, and other critical matters.\n\nCustomization: Parents appreciate the flexibility to customize how they receive notifications, allowing them to stay informed in a way that suits their preferences and schedules.\n\nEnhanced Engagement Tools: Features like appointment scheduling, event sign-ups, and surveys have increased parent participation and engagement.\n\nImproved Staff Experience: This past school year, we did a survey of our staff to find out how their experience with ParentSquare was going. We received a lot of helpful ( anonymous) feedback, but here are some quotes that stood out to me: \"Parents who do not answer the phone for calls will message through ParentSquare all the time. I am able to send quick responses and communicate with parents so much easier than trying to contact them by phone.\n\n“I appreciated Mr. Trombley’s public feedback and intend to continue our discussion on this topic,” Smith said. “I appreciate these comments as we seek to enhance and improve how we interact with families across BCSD.”\n\nTrombley emphasized that he knows “without a shadow of a doubt” that he’s not the only one who has struggled to successfully use ParentSquare, and there are even parents who are “way more comfortable and well versed in technology who are having the same difficulties as I am,” he said.\n\nHe reiterated his Monday talking points (a video recorded by Trombley) about the district trampling his and others’ First Amendment rights of free speech and believes this setup is \"the most restrictive form of communication with our school, not the least restrictive.”\n\n“I do not intend to drop this at all. I am hoping for a hasty response from the district, and a hasty change to this policy,” he said. “I don’t think getting rid of the forced nature of this app is unreasonable. I do plan on pursuing this issue in a peaceful legal way to see it through. Ligation is not out of the question, however, I would hope we don’t get to that point.”\n\nThe Batavian asked Smith if this was the first complaint of this type made in the district.\n\nGiven Trombley’s complaints, and apparent experience with his child's teachers, do you plan to respond with your teaching faculty with any communication about using the app? Can or will you clarify how the app is to be used and how faculty can also communicate with parents that wish to communicate another way, especially for those that want to opt out of the app and who may have a learning disability, as he suggested?\n\n“This is the first formal complaint we have received, however, we appreciate the feedback. We have surveyed our staff on their use of ParentSquare and will launch a similar survey to our families.,” Smith said. “With a new school year approaching, we always look to review, reassess, and refresh our communication expectations and guidelines across the district and school levels, and intend to do so again this year.\n\n“ParentSquare is fully compliant with all educational laws and regulations, and is widely used throughout our region and the state. You can find ParentSquare’s Privacy Policy here. To address Mr. Trombley’s comment about how ParentSquare uses our District’s data, please see the following.”\n\nSharing and Disclosure of Information\n\nParentSquare uses the data received from the School for the sole purpose of delivering products and services to the School. We do not rent, trade, or sell or otherwise distribute your information to any third parties and will only disclose information when allowed by FERPA and required a) by applicable laws or government orders or b) to maintain and operate our service or c) when authorized by the School.\n\nNo Advertising\n\nParentSquare does not use student or user records or data collected for targeted advertising, and no student profile is built by ParentSquare for reasons other than furthering School purposes.\n\nO’Darius A.

She will fill the vacancy left by Sutton, who was formerly a principal at John Kennedy Intermediate since 2020 before taking on the technology role and charging ahead to deal with a state Comptroller’s audit in July of 2023.\n\nRight off the bat, Sutton was faced with key findings from the audit that he needed to address while aligning with the district’s Strategic Plan. He gave his first report of findings and suggested solutions to the board in October 2023.\n\nThe Batavian asked Superintendent Jason Smith about the circumstances of Sutton’s departure, and if Villone would continue with the work already completed to address the Comptroller’s audit.\n\nSutton left his position for a technology director position at Rush Henrietta School District, Smith said.\n\n“During his tenure with us, he successfully achieved several initiatives, including addressing both the Comptroller’s audit and the technology functional review,” Smith said Tuesday.\n\nSutton's first task was to review the existing structure and services offered through BOCES, including database management, the physical inventory process, technology leadership and how assets are identified and tagged.\n\nThen he had to reestablish a formal leadership in the technology department and implement a formal Technology Committee, with a data protection privacy officer and reviews of data privacy law to ensure that all requirements are being met, he had said during the presentation.\n\nHe had been working with Edutech to ensure that tags were provided on all “products” that come from them, which is a restructuring of Batavia’s inventory system and prices to ensure accountability for all hardware, he said, including district-owned devices, per board policy.\n\nHe was implementing a software program to track software inventory product purchases and related expiration dates. He had also been rearranging and organizing the physical workspace of the technology department and at the storage room at Robert Morris.\n\nAll of these tasks have been items to enforce the existing board policies on inventory control based on the Comptroller’s audit. Not only were hundreds of devices discovered missing from inventory, but the district had been paying their annual fees.\n\nStepping into his own role to provide technology leadership, Sutton is using the functional review audit as a roadmap to prioritize and address issues that were uncovered, he said.\n\nAs a result, he was having weekly technology department meetings with tech aides at the middle and high schools, providing guidance and support to the creation of the digital fluency class at the middle school, and re-establishing the district technology committee with a focus on staff development and learning, he said.\n\nSmith and the board feel confident that Villone will be up to the task at hand. At Caledonia-Mumford Central School District, she managed technology infrastructure, implemented instructional software, and oversaw data security compliance, and prior to that as coordinator of Data Governance she provided training and guidance on cybersecurity and data protection to 47 school districts, the release states.\n\nThe Batavian also asked Smith if he was concerned about a recent rash of departures of administrators, including several assistant principals, the athletic director and Sutton, at the district.\n\n“It's common and expected for assistant principals to transition to principal positions after a few years. For example, I served as an assistant principal for three years before becoming principal at Elba in 2004. Mr. Hussain, Mrs. Torrey, and Dr. McCarthy were all assistant principals at Batavia for approximately three years each, and they have successfully moved on to principal roles, and we are proud of their accomplishments,” Smith said. “As the largest district in the region with a substantial staff, Batavia typically experiences personnel changes during the summer months leading up to a new school year.\n\n\"I'm pleased to report that we've attracted a diverse and experienced pool of applicants, including current administrators from other districts, to fill our open positions,\" he said. \"We're excited to welcome our newest hires to BCSD. I'm confident they'll be a great fit within our community, and I'm encouraged by their enthusiasm, wealth of educational experience, and desire to make a positive impact here in Batavia.”"
