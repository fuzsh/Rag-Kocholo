        "text": "Jacquelyn Lee Wyman was a caring mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend. She passed away in Milford, Iowa on May 31, 2024, at the age of 81. Jackie, the daughter of Walter and Madge Schroeder, was born on September 25, 1942, in Everly, Iowa. She graduated from Everly High School in 1960 after a devoted high school basketball career and continued to be a Cattlefeeder supporter throughout her life. Along with her father, Walter, they were relentless girls basketball fans and made many trips to the Iowa Girls State Basketball Tournament.\n\nJackie's two joys were her children, Leah, born in 1963, and Brent, born in 1965. Jackie enjoyed being the manager of the Rexall Drug Store luncheonette for many years, of which started her passion for the food industry. In 1966, she, along with her father and her husband, began Spudnuts at the Clay County Fair, her daughter now carries on the tradition. Around this same time, she bought her first restaurant, J&M Cafe, and co-owned it with Mike Ferindeli. Her last job before she retired was at Polaris Industries, where she met her best friend, Mona King.\n\nAfter retiring, Jackie enjoyed spending time with her twin grandchildren after they were born in Arizona in 2006, where she remained for six months to take care of them. She spent her free time sharing her love for cooking and baking with her grandchildren after Leah and the twins returned home in 2007. Jackie loved visiting her son at his Spudnut Shop at the lakes and having her maple glazed spudnut! She also loved when the fair came around to be a fixture at her daughter's stand. She enjoyed reading the latest John Grisham book and hanging out with her many friends and neighbors. Jackie also loved her dogs, Maggie and Gobby who she is enjoying being with today and Petunia Lee, who is left to cherish her memory. Jackie was a simple person, never raised her voice, always there for her friends, still wrote thank you cards and notes to friends and family and always had a smile on her face, always! Jackie is having coffee with her sisters and parents and enjoying being at peace!\n\nJackie was preceded in death by her grandparents, parents, and her two sisters, Memphis Kibbie and Donna Rae Philiph.\n\nLeft to cherish her memory are her brother, Terry Schroeder of Tempe, AZ., her niece, Michelle Schroeder of Chandler, AZ., her nephew, Travis Schroeder of Chandler AZ.; her son, Brent Wyman of Spirit Lake, IA, her granddaughters, Brittany (Nik) DelMonego of Tallahaassee, FL., Malerie (Peter) Miller of Alpine, CA., her daughter, Leah Wyman of Spencer, IA., her grandson, Kahne Walter Wyman, her granddaughter, Addison Lee Wyman; her nephews, Kelly Philiph, Joe Kibbie, Cameron Philiph, Scott (Kim) Kibbie, her nieces, Keri (Dave) Lee, Shelley Mitchell.; her great grandchildren, Parker DelMonego-Wyman, Theo Miller, Deno DelMonego, and Oliver Miller; and many other amazing relatives and friends.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, a Memorial Fund has been established in memory of Jackie."
