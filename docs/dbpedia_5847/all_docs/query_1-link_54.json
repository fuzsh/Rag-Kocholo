        "text": "ASLA’s Women in Landscape Architecture Professional Practice Network (WILA PPN) is sharing the next set of profiles of women in the profession (see the previous installment right here). If you’d like to be featured, the PPN’s call for submissions will remain open, with profiles being shared on an ongoing basis.\n\nSubmit a WILA profile!\n\nThese profiles will appear on the PPN’s LinkedIn group, Facebook group, and here on The Field. This post includes Whitner Kane, ASLA, Carley Rickles, ASLA, and Rebecca Bradley, ASLA.\n\nWhitner Kane, ASLA\n\nWhat inspired you to pursue a career in landscape architecture?\n\nI have always loved all different kinds of design (architectural, interiors, fashion, graphic, etc.). Starting as an architecture major in college exposed me to a range of different designers, styles, functions/forms, and allowed me an opportunity to dive into the purpose of design and how it can directly impact how people live. There was a natural progression from building architecture into outdoor space design and urban planning that I particularly enjoyed. Combine that with a desire to be outside more than in, and landscape architecture was a natural fit.\n\nWho are the female role models who have influenced your career?\n\nAn early design role model was Cheryl Morgan, my Urban Studio professor at Auburn University. She challenged me in a unique way and really pushed me to explore design and my potential as a designer. That studio was my first opportunity to work with a real client (a small town in Alabama) and understand how what we do on paper can have a big impact on real lives. Her studio went beyond textbooks and lectures and really brought home the ‘why’ and ‘who’ of our profession.\n\nWhat advice do you have for other women pursuing a career in landscape architecture?\n\nThere are many different avenues within landscape architecture that you can focus on—and all of them are important and valid. Lean into what lights you up: you may not find it in every project you work on, and that is okay. All projects can present opportunities to learn and grow if you let them. Be curious and ask questions (and don’t be afraid to follow up with another question!). Use what you learn and be confident in your delivery—a confident woman is a powerful thing.\n\nCan you share with us a project you are particularly proud of and why?\n\nTwo come to mind immediately: the renovation of the Credit One Stadium in Charleston, SC, is first. This was a high-profile project with a very tight design and construction timeline. Charleston has strict stormwater guidelines and the open space had to be both beautiful and extremely functional. Working closely with a fantastic design, engineering, and construction team allowed us to realize this goal and bring an amazing space to life. As someone who really enjoys construction drawings and detailing in particular, it was a master class in the creative use of materials.\n\nThe second is significantly smaller: a garden and columbarium design for the small church I grew up in, in Clinton, NC. It was a very personal project and one that makes me smile every time I think of it.\n\nWhat advice would you give your younger self?\n\nEmbrace the unexpected and the unknown. My path through this profession (and life in general) has not been linear. What felt like periods of professional upheaval and uncertainty became amazing opportunities for personal growth. And don’t be afraid to really be yourself. I care deeply about my profession and the people we design for—and just as much for the people I share an office with every day.\n\nCarley Rickles, ASLA\n\nWhat inspired you to pursue a career in landscape architecture?\n\nIt was not really like that for me. I stumbled into landscape architecture school rather randomly. I took a career test on the internet. I found school to be creatively fulfilling, but felt a lot of imposter syndrome. While I knew I loved the field, I was not sure how to “pursue a career in landscape architecture” that felt authentic to myself. I had a lot of doubts about built environment change and wasn’t comfortable sharing them. I didn’t think there was a place for me in landscape architecture. I had not been exposed to ways of practicing I identified with. I did not find my footing for a long time. What eventually inspired me was conducting an independent study in graduate school on “alternative public space.” I was able to conduct field studies in Europe which exposed me to more radical ideas about public space, urban design, and community engagement. Since that time I’ve understood the potential of my place in this field.\n\nWho are the female role models who have influenced your career?\n\nAmy Francescini, Julie Bargmann, Suzanne Lacy, Martha Schwartz, FASLA, Cecile Martin, Margaret Crawford, Ellen Dunham-Jones, Ruth Dusseault\n\nWhat advice do you have for other women pursuing a career in landscape architecture?\n\nFollow your gut. If not for you, then for the next generation. If you’re not seeing yourself in the room or if you’re not feeling supported, go to the library. Search for those you can look up to and/or identify with. I promise you they’re there. Your life experience and voice are valid and valuable. Sometimes you can only rely on yourself to put the pieces together. Once you’ve found your footing, pass it on to the next generation. They need you. You’ve got it.\n\nCan you share with us a project you are particularly proud of and why?\n\nThe Historic Bruce Street School. This project utilized a community-centered design approach. My firm, Martin Rickles Studio, worked closely with community members and organizations over two years to craft a conceptual design for an important cultural project. We had incredible participation and outcomes that were continuously supported by folks within the community. We were able to shepherd the design process in a way that folks identified with. The project has been continuously supported from the ground-up.\n\nWhat advice would you give your younger self?\n\nYou deserve to be in the room upon which you’ve arrived.\n\nRebecca Bradley, ASLA\n\nWhat inspired you to pursue a career in landscape architecture?\n\nI knew I wanted to do something in a creative realm. My mom actually knew Louisiana State University had a good program, as she had a friend that had graduated in the program—my mom gets the credit, as she encouraged me to check it out at the freshman orientation we did.\n\nWho are the female role models who have influenced your career?\n\nMy mother, and several women who mentored me early on at the first firm I worked for: Akiko Iwata, ASLA, Fernanda Ferrari, Sarah DelNegri, Mihaela Zaharescu, ASLA, and Penny Billingham. These women did not have “leadership” titles, but they were leaders, they organized the teams and projects, they taught younger staff, and they were incredibly thoughtful designers. Lisa Switkin, ASLA, has been a great role model to me in our industry and outside the landscape architecture industry entrepreneurs I have followed and been inspired by the careers of Liz Lambert, Sylvana Ward Durrett, and Sheila Bridges.\n\nWhat advice do you have for other women pursuing a career in landscape architecture?\n\nBe patient and learn from even the places or projects that challenge you most. Make it your own space—there is so much potential with this career choice: alternate ways of practicing, different industries we could impact. We need more women-owned and led landscape architecture practices and studios so the traditional firm structure can be rethought.\n\nCan you share with us a project you are particularly proud of and why?\n\nCadence—keeping a small business thriving for 15 years and having some team members who have joined in this journey beyond the 10 year mark is something I am extremely proud of.\n\nWhat advice would you give your younger self?\n\nJust keep going. You will write and re-write your life multiples time—and that is a gift.\n\nSubmit a WILA profile!\n\n2024 WILA Profiles:\n\nVoices of Women in Landscape Architecture, Part 1\n\nCarolina Jaimes, ASLA\n\nConnie Scothorn, ASLA\n\nEmily Greenwood, ASLA\n\nVoices of Women in Landscapes Architecture, Part 2\n\nKathryn Talty, ASLA\n\nAida Curtis, FASLA\n\nCeCe Haydock, ASLA\n\nVoices of Women in Landscapes Architecture, Part 3\n\nQing Lana Luo, ASLA\n\nCaeli Tolar, ASLA\n\nJan Satterthwaite, ASLA\n\nKristina Snyder, ASLA\n\nVoices of Women in Landscapes Architecture, Part 4\n\nJennifer Cooper, ASLA\n\nAnne Chen, ASLA\n\nMeghan Mick, ASLA\n\nVoices of Women in Landscape Architecture, Part 5\n\nDana Hernalsteen, ASLA\n\nLucila Silva-Santisteban, ASLA\n\nMartha Fajardo\n\nVoices of Women in Landscape Architecture, Part 6\n\nRituparna Simlai, ASLA\n\nLaurie Hall, ASLA\n\nKristen Sweatland\n\nDonna Rodman\n\nVoices of Women in Landscape Architecture, Part 7\n\nBecky Rupel, ASLA\n\nMaria Debye Saxinger, ASLA\n\nLiwei Shen, Associate ASLA\n\nVoices of Women in Landscape Architecture, Part 8\n\nElizabeth “Violet” Mak, ASLA\n\nNicole Cleary, ASLA\n\nFatema Ali Tushi, ASLA\n\n2023 WILA Profiles:\n\nWomen in Landscape Architecture Profiles, Part 1\n\nAlexandra Mei, ASLA\n\nAngelica Rockquemore, ASLA\n\nSandy Meulners, ASLA\n\nSuLin Kotowicz, FASLA\n\nWomen in Landscape Architecture Profiles, Part 2"
