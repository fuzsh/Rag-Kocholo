        "text": "STILLWATER, Okla. — Back in the fall of 2021, there was a room of freshmen defenders living together in Stillwater.\n\nFour members of Oklahoma State's 2021 signing class were roommates for the 2021-22 school year: Nick Martin, Collin Oliver, Lyrik Rawls and Ty Williams. The group quickly became friends, being from East Texas and Oklahoma, and started to push each other to be great for the Cowboys.\n\nOver the last three seasons, the four freshman year roommates have had varied levels of success and heading into what could be their final year in Stillwater, Rawls has a great sense of pride for his friends and wants to contribute this season after suffering an injury that sidelined him for much of 2023."
