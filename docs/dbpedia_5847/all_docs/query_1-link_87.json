Mr. David Henriques died yesterday at his residence at St Mark's place after an illness of some weeks, and at the age of 76 years. Mr. Henriques was born in the city of Kingston, in the island of Jamaica, in the year 1783 - where he lived until the year 1823 - when, having amassed a competence, and, foreseeing the unhappy social changes which British legislation would effect in the colony, he came to New York, intending to make this City his permanent home. Some few years after he had settled here, he was induced to enter the firm of the Josephs, then doing a very large Banking and Stock business in Wall-street. After remaining in that house but a brief space, he withdrew his capital and retired some years before the concern failed. Since that period he has lived in retirement from active life, devoting himself to his family, to whom, as to all who knew him, he was a bright example of rectitude, kindness, charity, sincerity, and unbounded hospitality.\n\nThe funeral will take place on Friday morning, from the house in St. Mark's place, in which the family have resided for the past twenty-eight years\n\nHENRIQUES, David Philipe Cohen, son of the late Philip and Rebecca Cohen Henriques of Kingston, Jamaica, where he was born 28th Jan. 1851.
