Marcel van Eeden was born 1965 in The Hague. The initial intention of this Dutch draftsman and conceptual artist was to become a writer. After his decision to follow the path of an artist, he decided, in 1985, to only use images in his works derived from the time before his birth. Thus, van Eeden began to turn found images into paintings. During his art studies at the Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunsten in The Hague from 1989 to 1993, Marcel van Eeden turned to drawing as his preferred medium. From 1993 till today, the artist creates at least one drawing per day. In the early nineties, van Eeden began exhibiting in Dutch galleries and museums. Solo-exhibitions followed in Munich, Vienna, Zurich, Rome, and Toronto. Narrative structures emerged in his works no later than 2004, when the artist began grouping disparate singular motifs and captions into mysterious series. In 2006, van Eeden moved to Berlin. In this very same year, he showed his series of drawings titled K. M. Wiegand. Life and Work at the 4th Berlin Biennial, which garnered him widespread attention and critical acclaim. Since 2008, Marcel van Eeden lives and works in Zurich.
