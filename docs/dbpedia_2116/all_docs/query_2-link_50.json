        "text": "David Allen Hudson, 58, of Lancaster, Ohio passed into the eternal arms of Jesus on February 15, 2024 at Fairhope Hospice Pickering House surrounded by his loving family. David was born November 22, 1965, to the late Franklin and Eva (Napper) Hudson in Zanesville, Ohio. He was a graduate of Teays Valley High School in Ashville, Ohio, and Roadmaster Commerical Driver School of Columbus.\n\nDavid was an avid fisherman and outdoorsman. He had patience and a special instinct for the best fishing spots. He also enjoyed coin collecting and was always looking to find that rare coin. David enjoyed sports and was a huge Ohio State Buckeye fan. Most of all, he enjoyed spending time with his family and friends. We will always cherish the memories spent together like his storytelling and contagious laugh that could be heard from miles away. While deeply saddened by his passing, his love and spirit will forever remain within our hearts. A good Christian man that we will one day reunite with in heaven.\n\nDavid is survived by his loving wife, Tammy Hudson; stepdaughter, Ashley Scott; brother, Frank (Tracey) Hudson; sisters, Brook (Roy Jones) Nelson and Pam (Hudson) Moore; nieces, Kelly Jo Hudson, Angie (Eric Sr) Burke and Shelby Moore; nephews, Carl (Nicole) Jarrell, Braiden Sturgill and Garrett Moore; great nieces and nephews, Analyse Mitchell, Madison Jarrell, Christian Hill, Eric Burke Jr, Paxton Jarrell, and Preston Jarrell and grandchildren, Isaiah Merisier, Faith Merisier, Jeremy Hudson, and Theo Mitchell.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Frank and Eva Hudson.\n\nThe family wishes to extend their heartfelt thanks and appreciation to all the Doctors and Nurses at Mount Carmel East, OSU Wexner Medical Center, and Fairhope Hospice Pickering House for all the skilled and passionate care they provided to David during his extended illness. A special heartfelt thanks to niece Angie and sister Brook for their selfless efforts to provide a living donor Liver Transplant for David.\n\nA funeral service will take place Wednesday, February 21, 2023, at 12:00 PM at the Frank E. Smith Funeral Home, 405 N Columbus Street, Lancaster, OH. Friends and family may call from 10:00 am to the time of the service. Burial will follow at Amanda Twp Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions can be made to Fairhope Hospice and Palliative Care and OSU Wexner Medical Center Organ Donation Program.\n\nTo sign the guestbook, please visit funeralhome.com"
