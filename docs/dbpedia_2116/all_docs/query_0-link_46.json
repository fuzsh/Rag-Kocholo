        "text": "Alvin Lucier (born 1931) is an American composer who is best known for exploring the nature of sound and sonic environments, devising open-ended performance processes, and employing varying combinations of performers, tape, electronics, traditional musical instruments, installations, and architecture to realize his compositions. His later work more often uses traditional instruments, often in unusual orchestrations, combined with elements of sound processing or extended instrumental techniques. Among the composers Lucier has collaborated with are John Cage, Frederic Rzewski, James Tenney, Robert Ashley, and Gordon Mumma. He also worked with the theater director Robert Wilson, filmmaker Takahiko Iimura, and the choreographers Viola Farber and Douglas Dunn.\n\nLucier received his B.A. at Yale University (1954) and his M.F.A. at Brandeis (1960). His teachers included Howard Boatwright, Arthur Berger, Irving Fine, and Harold Shapero, and he also studied with Aaron Copland and Lukas Foss at the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood (1958-1959).\n\nAfter two years in Rome on a Fulbright fellowship, Lucier joined the Brandeis University faculty in 1963 as director of the choral union; later, he was head of the electronic music studio. In 1966, Lucier collaborated with Ashley, Mumma, and David Behrman to create the Sonic Arts Union, a collective that promoted and performed their music.\n\nIn 1968, Lucier was named John Spencer Camp Professor of Music at Wesleyan University. His students included Nicholas Collins, Douglas Kahn, Daniel James Wolf, and Judy Dunaway. For his retirement, in 2011, the school produced a three-day festival of his work. The course Lucier taught at Wesleyan on experimental music, Music 109, became the basis of a book, Music 109: Notes on Experimental Music (2012). Lucier also wrote Chambers: Scores by Alvin Lucier (1980), for which he was interviewed by Douglas Simon.\n\nLucier was the music director of the Viola Farber Dance Company (1972–1977) and a fellow of the DAAD Kunstlerprogramm in Berlin (1990). Among his many influential works are Music for Solo Performer (1965), Vespers (1968), I am Sitting in a Room (1970), Music on a Long Thin Wire (1977), Music for Pure Waves, Bass Drums, and Acoustic Pendulums (1980) and Sferics (1981).\n\nThe Alvin Lucier papers, dating from 1939 to 2015, strongly represent all aspects of Lucier's career as a composer, conceptualist, and pedagogue over five decades. Most of the collection consists of scores, sound recordings, moving images, subject files, photographs, correspondence, and programs. Also present are datebooks, diaries, posters, notebooks, and clippings. See the container list for a description of the sound recordings and moving images.\n\nThe scores, dating from 1952 to 2015, document most of Lucier's work, including compositions, installations, and music created for theater and dance. The earliest and most recent scores are in traditional notated format, but most of the others are \"prose scores,\" consisting of directions on how to realize the piece in question. Notated scores can include sketches, full scores, and parts. Many of the scores include contextual material such as notes, stage diagrams, correspondence, programs, technical information, or brief AIFF sound files. Some compositions contain further documentation in the subject files.\n\nMany of the prose scores are duplicated in digital form (but may differ from the print versions if they were revised at a later date). Lucier's own list of his works, which includes instrumentation for each, is viewable as an additional resource through the archival portal. That list does not include all the compositions documented in the collection. Notes in the container list supply instrumentation for compositions not on Lucier's list.\n\nThe subject files document topics or events such as compositions; installations; collaborative projects; people; recordings; and tours. The files contain correspondence; technical notes; program notes; contracts; writings and lectures; an engagement file holding programs, clippings, and other information; databases of concerts and reviews; Lucier's CVs; and personal records such as diplomas, yearbooks, and wedding papers. Some subject files also have photographs.\n\nTwo of the largest components of the subject files document the books Chambers: Scores by Alvin Lucier and Music 109: Notes on Experimental Music, both of which contain multiple drafts, interview transcripts, or class transcripts. The files for Chambers consist primarily of raw and edited transcripts of Lucier's conversations with Douglas Simon that formed the bulk of the book. Also present in the subject files are transcripts of interviews and conversations between Lucier and John Cage, William Duckworth, and James Tenney; correspondence and other notes regarding the Sonic Arts Union; special projects such as Solar Sounder I; and files regarding Lucier's career at Brandeis and Wesleyan Universities. These document courses he taught there, the 1994 Collaborations festival of his work, and his retirement celebration.\n\nThe folders on the Sonic Arts Union primarily contain correspondence regarding performances and tours, as well as letters from the composers Gordon Mumma and Robert Ashley. The files on John Cage, Pauline Oliveros, Morton Feldman, La Monte Young, and Robert Wilson hold correspondence, notes, programs, and, in some cases, Lucier's essays on them.\n\nMost of the subject files are in paper form. Some portions are duplicated in digital (as Microsoft Word files for Windows or Mac), while others, such as the Filemaker databases of concerts and reviews; grant and career narratives; some correspondence; and a few lectures, are in digital form only.\n\nThe correspondence is mostly organized chronologically, with a small amount filed by name. These include letters from David Behrman, Gordon Mumma, and Frederic Rzewski. A separate file titled \"Composer Letters\" includes letters from Morton Feldman, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luigi Dallapiccola, John Cage, John Adams, Anthony Braxton, James Tenney, Roger Reynolds, John Tilbury, Christian Wolff, Quincy Porter, Pierre Boulez, and Niccolò Castiglioni. Some letters from these individuals can also be found in the chronological correspondence, as well as in the subject files. The chronologically-arranged correspondence is with presenters, funders, musicians, and friends, and relates to particular works, installations, concerts, exhibitions, or other events. Some contracts can also be found in the correspondence, though most are in the subject files. Researchers should consult both the correspondence and the subject files for information on particular topics or people.\n\nThe photographs are arranged by topic, event, or composition, and consist of prints, negatives, contact sheets, and digital images. They show rehearsals; performances; recording sessions; installations; lectures; seminars; formal and informal portraits of Lucier; Lucier with his teachers Aaron Copland, Lukas Foss, and Milton Babbitt; collaborators and colleagues such as John Cage, Christian Wolff, Robert Ashley, Robert Wilson, and Steve Reich; and Lucier with family and friends. Digital photographs are mostly in JPG, but also include TIFF and Photoshop files. Some of the digital photographs are scans of analog originals, some of which may not be present in the collection. The print photograph files may also hold letters, programs, notes, or clippings.\n\nSome compositions or events have photographs from multiple performances and locations. These include Bird and Person Dyning, Chambers (the composition), Music for Pure Waves, Bass Drums, and Acoustic Pendulums, Music for Solo Performer, Music on a Long Thin Wire, Queen of the South, and meetings and tours of the Sonic Arts Union.\n\nThe datebooks, calendars, and diaries cover the 1960s to the late 1990s, and consist primarily of datebooks. The diaries mainly document travel. Clippings date from the 1960s to the 2000s and include profiles of Lucier, performance and recording reviews, and articles by Lucier. The notebooks include initial sketches and ideas for compositions and notes on acoustic phenomena. The concert programs are comprehensive, covering nearly Lucier's entire career. The posters, dating from the 1960s to the 1990s, advertise performances and other events in the United States and Europe."
