        "text": "Full Description\n\nThe artist book Marcel van Eeden – 1898 is being published to coincide with the Hans Thoma Prize 2023. The prizewinner, Marcel van Eeden (b. 1965), explores Thoma’s little-known travels to the Netherlands in 1898. He reflects on Thoma’s analysis of Rembrandt van Rijn or Paulus Potter, under the problematic influence of the cultural theorist Julius Langbehn. Present-day gum bichromate images of the places Thoma visited alongside historical quotes by Thoma and Langbehn result in a multifaceted, critical consideration of nationalistic views on culture.\n\nText in English and German.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMarcel van Eeden (born 22 November 1965, in The Hague, Netherlands) is a Dutch draftsman and painter. From 1989 to 1993 van Eeden studied painting at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague. Van Eeden lives and works in Zurich and The Hague."
