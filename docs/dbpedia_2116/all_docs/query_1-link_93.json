        "text": "We asked artists around the world, who are close to Haus am Waldsee through exhibitions, what their situation is like at the moment.\n\nMarcel van Eeden is a well-known Dutch draughtsman and artist, who had a solo exhibition at Haus am Waldsee in 2011: Schritte ins Reich der Kunst. In his series, van Eeden deals with the past, the time before his birth in 1965. The artist deals with this time, which is supposedly so certain because, unlike the future, it has already taken place, in a literary-creative way by using criminal humour to bring real life stories of deceased people into ever new entanglements. He takes scenes and texts from the Internet and transfers them to uniquely striking, speaking drawings.\n\nIn Angkor Wat, wonderful black and white photographs have now been created that perfectly match the atmosphere of his art. Marcel van Eeden studied at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague. After many years in Berlin he lives in Zurich and teaches at the Academy of Art in Karlsruhe.\n\nHere is his update from 16 April 2020\n\nBack in Zurich it is actually not much different than usual, I thought. In my studio I was always alone. But now our son can’t go to school. And the mood in the supermarket could be described as tense at the very least. Somehow it affected my concentration in the beginning. All day long news about illness and death. This causes restless dreams. Actually you shouldn’t read a lot of newspapers, it’s not healthy. But you want to know. The condition is so unusual.\n\nMeanwhile I continue working relatively calmly. My world has become as small as my desk. Sometimes I take a little walk outside. Soon the academy in Karlsruhe will start again, where I teach. In the beginning everything will be digital. Everything inside the room at the small table in front of me."
