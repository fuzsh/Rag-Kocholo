        "text": "P2P\n\nJacob Dwyer, Daniel Karrer\n\nMarcel van Eeden, Tenki Hiramatsu\n\nBob Eikelboom, Sara Masüger, …\n\nmodulated by Herrmann Germann Conspirators\n\n@ Barbara Seiler & Annex14\n\nLöwenbräukunst, Limmatstrasse 270, 8005 Zurich\n\nOpening, Friday 23 November 2018, 18 h\n\nExhibition, 24.11.2018 — 09. 02. 2019, Tue–Fri 12–18 h, Sat 11–17 h\n\nPhysio Trimming Yoga with Rajesh Ramachandran,\n\nWednesdays 18 h at High Ceiling (in English)\n\nArtist’s Talk with Warren Neidich, Tuesday 4.12.2018, 18 h\n\nP2P on view:\n\n23.11.–6.12.2018: Jacob Dwyer, DAT LIKWID LAND, 2017\n\nWarren Neidich, Pizzagate, 2018;\n\n7.12.–22.12.2018: Graeme Arnfield, Sitting in the Darkness\n\nRiley Harmon, The Firewall Grove, 2017/18\n\n8.1.–17.1.2019 Short Film Program: Dina Danish, Jérôme Leuba, Sebastian Stumpf, more details will follow\n\n18.1.–9.2.2019: Catherine Biocca, Meeting 1, Solitaire, Kitchen Hunt, Supermarket & Jonas Baumann, Towel\n\n23.11.2018–9.2.2019: Dina Danish, Practicing Foreign Languages, 2007; Jérôme Leuba, battlefield #58/open, 2010; battlefield #98/the program, 2013; battlefield #125, 2017; Sebastian Stumpf, Pfützen, 2013\n\nPeer-to-peer – or P2P for short – platforms are internet platforms that enable communication and exchange on an equal basis. Only those that provide data can take data. With the opening of High Ceiling a new era of gallery reality starts at the Löwenbräu. The platform founded by Barbara Seiler with the collaboration of annex14 becomes a gallery hub which, as a multiplier, contributes to democratisation and offers young galleries, collectives and initiators the possibility of bringing together artists from diverse areas and presenting them to the art market.\n\nThe exhibition is founded on exchange, synergy and inspiration. P2P shows artists represented by both galleries as well as Herrmann Germann Conspirators. Exchange, encounters and interaction between art, gallerists and visitors are the goal. P2P is the desire to promote dialogue and encounters with the public, to stimulate discussion and break down barriers in order to meet others eye to eye.\n\nP2P Hall\n\nPauline Bastard (*1982 in Paris, lives and works in Paris FR) creates complex narratives developed through installations, films and sculptures containing and relating to her experiments. Through collaborations she questions the construction of the self and its place in the contemporary world. Pauline Bastard creates stories, making them happen, using situations as matter and taking seemingly unrealizable experiences as material for production. Alex is a fictional character created by the artiste Pauline Bastard. With the help of an anthropologist, a lawyer, psychoanalyst, stylist, decorator and writer, Alex was imagined and followed for more than a year in the process of integration into real life, faced with the construction of the character’s social, administrative and emotional existence. This project has been awarded by Audi Talent Award and received the support of CNAP (Centre National des Arts Plastiques).\n\nJonas Baumann (*1983 in Basel CH, lives and works in Basel CH) has a practice that shifts between classical painting and digitally generated images and CGI films. In his work he sounds out the divide between tactile, analogue painting and the disembodied images on screen. After his studies he undertook a studio residency in Montreal, CA. His works have been shown at locations including the following: Haus der Elektronischen Künste HeK, Basel; Kunsthalle Basel; Kunstmuseum Olten, Kunstmuseum Solothurn, Sonnenstube, Lugano, lokal-int Biel, Kunsthalle Palazzo Liestal, akku Emmen, Kunsthalle Luzern, Espace Fibre, Montréal, Usine 106u, Montréal, Gallery RedTown570, Shanghai, and the Shanghai Biennale.\n\nMichał Budny (b. 1976 in Leszno PL, lives and works in Prague, CZ, and Warsaw, PL) reflects on his generation’s experiences of collapse and uncertainty in Poland and expresses his sensitivities and his inner landscapes in ‘poor’ materials like cardboard, sticky tape and paper. In the process aesthetic echoes of Minimalism and Constructivism flow into his poetic works.\n\nPavel Büchler (b. 1952 in Prague CZ, lives and works in Manchester, UK) Biographical east-west coordinates lead Pavel Büchler continually back to questions of communication, to linguistic abbreviations of daily absurdities or to the non-verbal reversals of pictorial impressions in his ‘Modern Paintings,’ in which paint removed from found oil paintings is mounted back to front.\n\nSimon Callery (b. 1960 in London UK, lives and works in London UK) His ‘paintings’ are sewn together from canvases which have been rubbed through with pigment, with openings allowed into the interior of the work and loose elements. The haptic physicality which this produces and the spatial depth are equally important elements, combined with further characteristics of English landscape painting such as drawing, light and darkness and depth of field.\n\nJacob Dwyer (*1988 in London UK, lives and works in Amsterdam NL) studied Fine Art at Newcastle University UK, before completing a Masters in Experimental Film at Kingston University UK, and residencies at De Ateliers in Amsterdam (2012–2014) and Deltaworkers New Orleans. His work has been shown in art spaces and film festivals including IFFR Rotterdam, IDFA Amsterdam, BFI London, BALTIC 39 Newcastle, Galerie Juliette Jongma Amsterdam, Rupert, Vilnius and Herrmann Germann Contemporary, Zurich. In 2015 he received the Kino der Kunst Project Award in Munich.\n\nMarcel van Eeden (*1965 in Den Haag, lives and works in Den Haag, Karlsruhe and Zurich) Working within a set of self-imposed parameters, Marcel van Eeden has created drawings that question the way history is codified and recorded. According to his many rules, van Eeden must make a new drawing every day, and all the drawings must be based on found images and text originating on a specific date before he was born. To achieve the graphic novel quality of his illustrations, van Eeden uses pencil or ink on paper, each work a part of a non-linear narrative in which fictional characters randomly reappear in a way that evokes the unreliability of memory. His work has been shown in major museums, including MoMA New York, the Centre Pompidou Paris and the Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag.\n\nBob Eikelboom (*1991 in Leeuwarden NL) His practice is often characterised by striking imagery but it is primarily about interstitial space: an interlude in which meaning is given to a range of possibilities and combinations, the point that is susceptible to multiple interpretations. This language speaks of the gap between culture and its codes, from high to low. Through his imagery and the use of specific materials Eikelboom creates a link between techniques of derogation and honesty. There is always something behind the work that is not revealed on the surface. We are never sure if the image gives us satisfaction or makes us critical. Bob Eikelboom graduated from the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague (KABK) in 2012, the youngest artist ever to graduate from the school. His work has been shown at the GEM in The Hague (group), Le Plafond Project Space (duo with Martin Kippenberger), at Biennale de Jeune Creation (group) and the Bonnefantenmuseum in Maastricht (group).\n\nTenki Hiramatsu (*1986 in Wakayama JP, lives and works in Karlsruhe) He studies at the Art Academy Karlsruhe as a Master Student with Marcel van Eeden. In order to function, paintings depend on the observer’s imagination. After all, a painting is in some way entirely a lie and viewed with this implicit understanding. Sometimes the lie protects the viewer. No matter how grotesque or cruel the image you are looking at may be, you are generally able to look at it, comforted by the fact that what is in front of you ‘is just a picture’. However, sometimes this general rule is broken. We are aware that in some cases, the lie will actually hold more power – that in the short term, the semblance of truth may be more powerful than truth itself."
