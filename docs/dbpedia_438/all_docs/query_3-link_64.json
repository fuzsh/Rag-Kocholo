        "text": "Getting from Assisi to the Republic of San Marino\n\nI again opted to drive on country roads passing by Gubbio and Urbino. Both places are worth a visit on their own albeit they were not on my planned itinerary.\n\nThe drive took me some four hours partially due to some road construction work. But mainly because the stretch after Urbino was all about climbing and descending the various hill/mountain tops. Not to speak of the hairpin curves. So, not a good option for persons suffering from car sickness. Having said that, I enjoyed it as I passed through some great places.\n\nMicro state nested within Italy\n\nThere is a reason I decided to visit the Republic of San Marino. I was intrigued but the fact that there is a tiny micro state of only 61 km2 nested within Italian territory. With some 33,000 people living there, it has the smallest number of inhabitants of all the countries of the Council of Europe. In contrast, it has the highest number of vehicles/capita.\n\nOne of the world’s wealthiest countries\n\nIt is one of the wealthiest countries of the world with a per capita GDP of US$55,449. It has the lowest unemployment rate in Europe, no national debt, and a surplus budget.\n\nOldest constitutional republic\n\nSan Marino claims to be the oldest constitutional Republic. It is governed by a 60-member Grand and General Council elected every five years. Every six months, two Captains Regents of opposing parties are elected to rule the Republic.\n\nCollectors of Euro coins\n\nSan Marino is part of the Euro zone and has its “own Euros” which are rare to find outside of San Marino and actually a collector’s item.\n\nMain agricultural products are wine and cheese while all other goods are imported from Italy.\n\nGetting rid of the car\n\nAnd here I was again with a problem that I have (nearly) gotten accustomed to in this road trip. How to get near the hotel in the historical center and what to do with the car. But it was less painful than expected. I was lucky to find an empty spot in the parking P6 which is only some 100 meters from the hotel. The hotel gave me a card which cost me 4 Euros for a 24-hour parking of the car.\n\nPalazzo Publico\n\nIn the picture you see the official government seat of the Republic of San Marino.\n\nPiazza de la Liberta\n\nThe government seat is located on the main square of the City.\n\nNice place to have dinner\n\nI had dinner in this square. It offers an amazing view onto the valley and the sea. And the sunset viewed from here is amazing. I ordered grilled Orata fillet (fish of the Mediterranean). It was really fresh and tasted excellent. Surprisingly, the bill was very moderate.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOverall, I would say that San Marino is really quite and very relaxing and worth a visit if you happen to be in the area.\n\nThe few tourists that I saw in June (might change in high season) were mainly visiting for the day.\n\nInitially, I thought I would have to abundantly fill my wallet in order to stay there for a night but the contrary was the case.\n\nWalking around the historic part, I found a number of shops selling perfumes and all sorts of sunglasses for up to 40% cheaper compared to the rest of Europe."
