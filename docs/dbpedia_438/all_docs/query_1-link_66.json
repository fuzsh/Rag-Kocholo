All must be US citizens who have reached the age of 18 and registered voters of the City of Grand Blanc. Members are elected at large by the citizens of the City in November of odd-numbered years to staggered 4-year terms.

During the summer months of June, July and August, only the 2nd Wednesday Council meetings are held.\n\nEveryone is welcome to attend.\n\n2024 SCHEDULE\n\nJAN 10 City Council Meeting JAN 24 City Council Meeting-if needed FEB 14 City Council Meeting FEB 28 City Council Meeting-if needed MAR 13 City Council Meeting MAR 27 City Council Meeting-if needed APR 10 City Council Meeting APR 24 City Council Meeting-if needed MAY 8 City Council Meeting MAY 22 City Council Meeting-if needed JUNE 12 City Council Meeting JULY 10 City Council Meeting AUG 14 City Council Meeting SEPT 11 City Council Meeting SEPT 25 City Council Meeting-if needed OCT 9 City Council Meeting OCT 23 City Council Meeting-if needed NOV 13 City Council Meeting DEC 11 City Council Meeting"
