        "text": "Executive branch\n\nchief of state: co-chiefs of state Captain Regent Maria Luisa BERTI and Captain Manuel CIAVATTA (for the period 1 October 2022 - 1 April 2023)\n\nhead of government: Secretary of State for Foreign and Political Affairs Luca BECCARI (since 8 January 2020)\n\ncabinet: Congress of State elected by the Grand and General Council\n\nelections/appointments: co-chiefs of state (captains regent) indirectly elected by the Grand and General Council for a single 6-month term; election last held in September 2022 (next to be held in March 2023); secretary of state for foreign and political affairs indirectly elected by the Grand and General Council for a single 5-year term; election last held on 28 December 2019 (next to be held by November 2024)\n\nelection results: Maria Luisa BERTI and Manuel CIAVATTA elected captains regent; percent of Grand and General Council vote - NA; Luca BECCARI (PDCS) elected secretary of state for foreign and political affairs; percent of Grand and General Council vote - NA\n\nnote: the captains regent preside over meetings of the Grand and General Council and its cabinet (Congress of State), which hasÂ 7 other members who are selected by the Grand and General Council; assisting the captains regent areÂ 7 secretaries of state; the secretary of state for Foreign Affairs has some prime ministerial roles\n\nEconomic overview\n\nSan Marino's economy relies heavily on tourism, banking, and the manufacture and export of ceramics, clothing, fabrics, furniture, paints, spirits, tiles, and wine. The manufacturing and financial sectors account for more than half of San Marino's GDP. The per capita level of output and standard of living are comparable to those of the most prosperous regions of Italy.\n\nSan Marino's economy contracted considerably in the years since 2008, largely due to weakened demand from Italy - which accounts for nearly 90% of its export market - and financial sector consolidation. Difficulties in the banking sector, the global economic downturn, and the sizable decline in tax revenues all contributed to negative real GDP growth. The government adopted measures to counter the downturn, including subsidized credit to businesses and is seeking to shift its growth model away from a reliance on bank and tax secrecy. San Marino does not issue public debt securities; when necessary, it finances deficits by drawing down central bank deposits.\n\nThe economy benefits from foreign investment due to its relatively low corporate taxes and low taxes on interest earnings. The income tax rate is also very low, about one-third the average EU level. San Marino continues to work towards harmonizing its fiscal laws with EU and international standards. In September 2009, the OECD removed San Marino from its list of tax havens that have yet to fully adopt global tax standards, and in 2010 San Marino signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements with most major countries. In 2013, the San Marino Government signed a Double Taxation Agreement with Italy, but a referendum on EU membership failed to reach the quorum needed to bring it to a vote."
