        "text": "When is the Investiture of the New Captains Regent?\n\nThe Investiture of the New Captains Regent is a public holiday in San Marino that takes place twice a year; on April 1st and October 1st.\n\nHistory of the Investiture of the New Captains Regent\n\nThere is an old saying that 'two heads are better than one'. In San Marino that saying is literally taken as a form of government.\n\nIn a tradition that dates back to 1243 and based on a custom of the Roman Republic, this tiny republic has not one, but two heads of state.\n\nKnown as the Captains Regent, two people are elected every six months by the Grand and General Council, the country's legislative body.\n\nThe two Captain Regent are usually selected from different political parties to give a unique balanced government. Once they have served the six months, they cannot become regents again for another three years.\n\nThis may sound a bit bonkers to those of us from countries whose leaders are elected for periods of four or five years, but the roles are mainly symbolic and more like that of a king or queen rather than a president.\n\nWomen were prevented from taking public positions in San Marino until 1972. The first female Captains Regent was elected in April 1981.\n\nIf you are visiting San Marino on April 1st or October 1st, you can watch the investiture of the new Captains Regent which takes place at the Piazza della Liberta, outside the Government Palace."
