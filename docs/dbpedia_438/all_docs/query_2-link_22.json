In January of 1967, local elected officials in El Paso County joined together to form the El Paso Council of Governments. This organization was initiated to further intergovernmental cooperation and coordination in the planning, development and delivery of governmental services within El Paso County, Texas.\n\nIn 1971, the counties of Hudspeth, Culberson, Jeff Davis, Presidio and Brewster were included in the organization to form a truly “Regional” body, and the organization was renamed West Texas Council of Governments. In 1987, by vote of the membership, Doña Ana County, New Mexico and the local governments within were included as full members and the name of the organization was changed to the Rio Grande Council of Governments.\n\nNotice of Non-discrimination and Accessibility Requirements Discrimination is Against the Law\n\nThe Rio Grande Council of Governments serves to advance intergovernmental cooperation and collaboration in the planning, development and, delivery of specific governmental services to its region.\n\nBy providing these services with compassion and professionalism, we enhance the quality of life for our constituents, therefore creating stronger communities for individuals and families to flourish."
