The Governance Committee is mostly internally focused, helping ensure that the YAC operates smoothly and effectively.\n\nAnnually established SNAP Committees: The work of the YAC is project, topic, or issue based and evolves regularly based on the needs of the university, Alumni Relations office, and alumni community. Each year, the YAC established two to four SNAP (small, nimble, actionable, purposeful) Committees that are focused around projects, topics, goals, or areas of priority for the YAC. Each committee has a specific purpose, a clear outcome, and a finite timeline for completing the work.\n\nAdditionally there is an Executive Committee made up of the President, President-Elect, and Committee Chairs."
