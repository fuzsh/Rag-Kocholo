        "text": "History of Investiture Ceremony of the Captains Regent\n\nHearing the words ‘investiture’ and ‘regent’ may spark some thoughts of nobility, especially concerning European cultures and traditions. However, if you look past the terms, you will discover a sacred ceremony that plays out twice a year in the Republic of San Marino. The first in April and the second in October, both on the first of their respective months.\n\nLet’s go back in time. The Captain’s Regent, also known as ‘Capitani reggenti’ in Italian, refers to the two heads of state in San Marino and was established in the first half of the 13th century. These officials are elected every six months by the Grand and General Council, which is the country’s legislative body. Since inception, they were tasked with managing justice, similar to that of magistrates. It all goes back to December of 1243 when the Grand and General Council elected the first two ‘consuls,’ a term derived from ancient Rome.\n\nMany centuries later, women were finally allowed to participate and be in the running for this incredible honor. In fact, as of April 2020, San Marino now has the most female heads of state in the world after electing its 18th female Captain Regent. Today, as an event that is solidified in the culture and history of this country, the rules around eligibility are clear. They are as follows; you need to hold San Marino citizenship from birth, be 25 or older, Be a Grand and General Council member, and not have been Captain Regent in the past three years. With such a rich history and iconic tradition, San Marino has managed to conserve a particularly unique celebration in the form of an event that takes place in the streets of the Historical Center."
