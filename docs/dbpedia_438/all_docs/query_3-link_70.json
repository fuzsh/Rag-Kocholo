        "text": "The Small Council[1] is a governing body which advises the king of the Seven Kingdoms, later the Six Kingdoms and institutes policy at his command. It is the inner (thus \"small\") council of the king, essentially forming the \"government cabinet\" of the Seven Kingdoms. Members are appointed to their position by the King; theoretically they can be dismissed at will by the king, however in practice this might lead to undesirable political fallout.\n\nThe king serves as the head of the council and takes note of its recommendations, but only the king can make the council's decisions into law. The Hand of the King is the leading advisor on the council and serves as the king's proxy when he is not present, in which case the Hand chairs the meeting. If the king is a minor, then by default the appointed regent will act in place of the king on the council.[2]\n\nThe Small Council meets at the capital city of King's Landing in the Red Keep, in the same building as the throne room.\n\nComposition[]\n\nMembers of the Small Council are appointed and dismissed by the reigning King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, in theory as the king wills. In practice, of course, appointments or dismissals may have undesired political consequences which the king must consider.\n\nThe Small Council usually consists of seven non-hereditary positions (possibly to reflect the traditions of the Faith of the Seven), although its modern form has now eight positions. Long vacancies sometimes occur for one of these positions, i.e. during times of war, though this is considered undesirable.\n\nHand of the King: Serves as the king's chief advisor and chairs the Small Council. In the event of the king's absence, the Hand serves as his proxy on the council.\n\nMaster of War: Serves as the realm's chief military commander, particularly in land-base warfare. The title was created by Queen Regent Cersei Lannister during the reign of her son, King Tommen I Baratheon, amidst the ongoing War of the Five Kings.\n\nMaster of Coin: Serves as the realm's chief treasurer and bookkeeper.\n\nMaster of Whisperers: Serves as the realm's chief intelligence advisor and spymaster, supervising covert activities and information gathering, both at home and abroad.\n\nMaster of Laws: Serves as the realm's chief legal advisor, who also manages the Red Keep's dungeons and supervises law enforcement.\n\nMaster of Ships: Serves as the realm's chief naval officer, supervising and in command of the royal fleet and coordinating the realm's maritime defenses.\n\nLord Commander of the Kingsguard: Formerly served as the realm's chief military advisor, particularly in regard to land-based warfare, as well as being the commander of the Kingsguard, the Kingâ€™s personal guard. While the king personally appoints knights to the Kingsguard at his whim, once chosen they are lifetime appointments, which cannot legally be removed. In theory, however, a king may demote the Lord Commander back to being a regular member and elevate one of the other six Kingsguard to Lord Commander (though it is unknown if this has ever happened). Following Robert's Rebellion and the ascension of King Robert I Baratheon in 281 AC, the Lord Commander's seat on the Small Council was removed. It would be restored to the Small Council 24 years later with the election of King Bran I Stark in 305 AC, although with its original duties having been assumed by the Master of War, its current role on the Small Council is unknown.\n\nGrand Maester: Serves as the maester assigned to the Red Keep, and thus to the realm. Like all maester assignments, the Grand Maester is appointed by the Conclave of Archmaesters at the Citadel, not the king. While controversial, the King and the Hand of the King have the authority to exclude the Grand Maester from the Small Council, and even imprison him, but cannot replace him as Grand Maester. This makes the Grand Maester unique as the only member of the council not specifically chosen by the king. The Grand Maester's role on the Small Council is to provide intellectual advice to the king based on his studies at the Citadel. The Grand Maester also provides medical treatment to the king and the royal family in the event of injury or illness.\n\nAn emissary position was created by Tywin Lannister for Oberyn Martell and Dorne in general. Intended to be taken up by Oberyn's nephew Trystane Martell, the heir of the Prince of Dorne, Doran Martell, following his death, but Trystane ends up dying before he could.\n\nIf the regent of an underage King does not already possess one of these positions, then they are included in the Small Council as the King's proxy.\n\nThe Commander of the City Watch is not, strictly speaking, a position in the Small Council, however the Commander frequently attends Small Council meetings to report on conditions in the capital city. Janos Slynt is given an official seat on the council as one of his rewards for the role he played in the betrayal and arrest of Eddard Stark, though he was subsequently removed by acting Hand Tyrion Lannister.\n\nThe council may on occasion extend invitations to other lords or members of the royal family to occupy a seat on the council, despite there being no actual \"office\" for them to fill (serving as advisors who function as ministers without portfolio). Such was the case during the reign of King Viserys I Targaryen, where his wife, Queen Alicent Hightower, and his daughter and heir, Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, served on his council. They same held true for King Aegon II Targaryen, where his mother, Alicent, continued to serve on his Small Council, while Aegon granted his brother, Prince Aemond Targaryen, a seat as well.\n\nMembers[]\n\nUnder Aegon I Targaryen[]\n\nThe positions and members of the king's Small Council under Aegon I Targaryen, the Conqueror, included:\n\nThe Hand of the King\n\nLord Orys Baratheon\n\nLord Edmyn Tully\n\nUnder Aenys I Targaryen[]\n\nThe positions and members of the king's Small Council under Aenys I Targaryen included:\n\nThe Hand of the King\n\nPrince Maegor Targaryen\n\nSepton Murmison\n\nGrand Maester: Gawen\n\nUnder Maegor I Targaryen[]\n\nThe positions and members of the king's Small Council under Maegor I Targaryen included:\n\nThe Hand of the King\n\nLord Lucas Harroway\n\nLord Edwell Celtigar\n\nThe Grand Maester\n\nGawen\n\nMyros\n\nDesmond\n\nBenifer\n\nLord admiral: Lord Daemon Velaryon\n\nUnder Jaehaerys I Targaryen[]\n\nThe positions and members of the king's Small Council under Jaehaerys I Targaryen included:\n\nThe Hand of the King:\n\nSepton Barth\n\nPrince Baelon Targaryen\n\nSer Otto Hightower\n\nGrand Maester: Benifer\n\nMaster of Coin: Lord Lyman Beesbury\n\nLord admiral: Lord Daemon Velaryon\n\nLord Commander of the Kingsguard: Ser Ryam Redwyne\n\nUnder Viserys I Targaryen[]\n\nThe positions and members of the king's Small Council under Viserys I Targaryen included:\n\nHand of the King:\n\nSer Otto Hightower\n\nLord Lyonel Strong\n\nGrand Maester:\n\nMellos\n\nOrwyle\n\nMaster of Coin:\n\nPrince Daemon Targaryen\n\nLord Lyman Beesbury\n\nMaster of Laws:\n\nPrince Daemon Targaryen\n\nLord Lyonel Strong\n\nLord Jasper Wylde\n\nMaster of Ships:\n\nLord Corlys Velaryon\n\nSer Tyland Lannister\n\nLord Commander of the Kingsguard:\n\nSer Ryam Redwyne\n\nSer Harrold Westerling\n\nWithout portfolio:\n\nQueen Alicent Hightower\n\nPrincess Rhaenyra Targaryen\n\nUnder Aegon II Targaryen[]\n\nThe positions and members of the king's Small Council under Aegon II Targaryen at the onset of the Dance of the Dragons included:\n\nHand of the King: Ser Otto Hightower\n\nGrand Maester: Orwyle\n\nMaster of Coin: Ser Tyland Lannister\n\nMaster of Laws: Lord Jasper Wylde\n\nMaster of Ships: (vacant)\n\nMaster of Whisperers: Lord Larys Strong\n\nLord Commander of the Kingsguard: Ser Criston Cole\n\nWithout portfolio:\n\nQueen Dowager Alicent Hightower\n\nPrince Aemond Targaryen\n\nFollowing Otto's dismissal as Hand, he was replaced by Criston Cole. After Aegon II was rendered incapacitated during the Battle at Rook's Rest, the Small Council elected Prince Aemond Targaryen as regent. Thus, the Small Council included:\n\nPrince Regent Aemond Targaryen\n\nHand of the King: Ser Criston Cole\n\nGrand Maester: Orwyle\n\nMaster of Coin: Ser Tyland Lannister\n\nMaster of Laws: Lord Jasper Wylde\n\nMaster of Ships: (vacant)\n\nMaster of Whisperers: Lord Larys Strong\n\nLord Commander of the Kingsguard: Ser Criston Cole\n\nWithout portfolio:\n\nQueen Dowager Alicent Hightower\n\nUnder Aerys II Targaryen[]\n\nThe positions and members of the king's Small Council under Aerys II Targaryen, the Mad King, included:\n\nThe Hand of the King\n\nLord Tywin Lannister. (Tywin personally served as Aerys's Hand for twenty years, during which he held the realm together during Aerys's spiral into insanity. Tywin resigned in protest some years before the end of Aerys's reign.)\n\nLord Owen Merryweather\n\nLord Jon Connington\n\nLord Qarlton Chelsted\n\nWisdom Rossart\n\nGrand Maester: Pycelle\n\nMaster of Coin: (unknown)\n\nMaster of Laws: (unknown)\n\nMaster of Ships: (unknown)\n\nMaster of Whisperers: Varys\n\nLord Commander of the Kingsguard: Ser Gerold Hightower, known as \"the White Bull\"\n\nUnder Robert Baratheon[]\n\nThe positions and members of the king's Small Council under Robert I are:\n\nThe Hand of the King:\n\nLord Jon Arryn, Defender of the Vale and Warden of the East. (Appointed to the position when Robert ascended to the throne and retained it for most of Robert's subsequent seventeen-year reign.)\n\nLord Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. (Chosen to replace Jon Arryn after the former's sudden death, serving during the last few months of King Robert's reign.)\n\nGrand Maester: Pycelle\n\nMaster of Coin: Lord Petyr Baelish, known as \"Littlefinger\"\n\nMaster of Whisperers: Varys, known as \"the Spider\"\n\nMaster of Laws: Lord Renly Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands\n\nMaster of Ships: Lord Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone (Absent from recent meetings at King's Landing)\n\nLord Commander of the Kingsguard: Barristan Selmy (Left unoccupied seat on the council, subsequently dismissed from the position on Cersei's authority after Robert's demise)\n\nTraditionally, as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, Ser Barristan Selmy would have had a seat on the Small Council. However, because Barristan had been a Kingsguard for Aerys Targaryen, Robert did not like to include him in discussions of strategy, so he usually held Small Council meetings without him. Barristan did not mind being left out, because he did not enjoy politics.[3]\n\nKing Robert was notoriously uninterested in matters of governance, letting his Small Council run the realm while he ate, drank, hunted, and whored. Robert's own two brothers served on his Small Council, but they were also annoyed at how little he paid attention to the council. His youngest brother Renly, as well as Pycelle, lamented that he ignored all of Jon Arryn's sound financial advice, ultimately plunging the realm an astonishing 6 million Gold Dragons in great debt.[4] According to Tywin Lannister, Robert appeared at only three Small Council meetings in his entire seventeen year reign (though he might not have been aware of Robert's appearance at some of the more recent council meetings with Eddard Stark).[5]\n\nUnder Joffrey Baratheon[]\n\nThe positions and members of the king's Small Council under Joffrey I are:\n\nQueen Regent Cersei Lannister, King Joffrey's mother\n\nThe Hand of the King: Lord Tyrion Lannister, serving as acting Hand instead of his father Tywin Lannister.\n\nGrand Maester: Pycelle. (Removed by Tyrion and imprisoned in the dungeons of the Red Keep. However, Tyrion did not have the authority to replace him as Grand Maester. The position was functionally vacant for several months.)\n\nMaster of Coin: Lord Petyr Baelish\n\nMaster of Whisperers: Varys\n\nMaster of Laws: (vacant)\n\nMaster of Ships: (vacant)\n\nLord Commander of the City Watch: Janos Slynt. (Rewarded an official seat on the Small Council for his service to the Iron Throne for his role in the Massacre in the Red Keep. Subsequently removed by Tyrion and exiled to the Night's Watch for orchestrating and participating in the Massacre in King's Landing, under the orders of King Joffrey Baratheon.)\n\nJoffrey himself barely came to meetings of his own Small Council, unless it was insisted upon. His mother Cersei, as queen regent, typically took his place.\n\nWith the departure of Renly and Stannis Baratheon, who declared themselves rival claimants to the Iron Throne, the offices of Master of Laws and Master of Ships were left vacant. Cersei and Joffrey either could not find suitable candidates or simply didn't bother to appoint replacements.\n\nCersei and Joffrey's first edicts were to name Tywin Lannister as Hand of the King, to unlawfully dismiss Ser Barristan Selmy from the Kingsguard, and to name Cersei's brother Jaime his replacement as Lord Commander. Tywin, however, did not assume the office for a full year because he was busy personally directing the war in the Riverlands. Because he could not go to the capital in person, Tywin sent Tyrion in his stead as acting Hand to try to rein in the royal court. Jaime did not arrive in the capital either but was instead captured during the Battle of Whispering Wood, after which he spent over a year as a prisoner of the Starks, and another year slowly making his way back to King's Landing through the devastated Riverlands. Jaime was technically Lord Commander during this time period, but the position was functionally vacant. Moreover, Tyrion removed Pycelle from the council and imprisoned him in the dungeons of the Red Keep, after discovering that he was spying on him (albeit for Queen Regent Cersei, his own sister). Tyrion did not have the authority to appoint a new Grand Maester, so the position was also vacant for several months. Also, while the Commander of the City Guard is not a full member, he usually sits at council meetings, but in disgust, Tyrion exiled Janos Slynt to the Wall. As Varys pointed out, for a time the \"Small Council\" was growing smaller by the day: four out of the seven main offices were vacant, the regent but not the king sat at most meetings, and the Hand was technically only an acting Hand.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Blackwater, Tywin Lannister re-assumed his duties as the Hand of the King and sought to restore order to the council. Petyr Baelish was rewarded by being named Lord of Harrenhal and departed for the Vale of Arryn to woo Lady Lysa Arryn into a marriage-alliance and secure the Vale's loyalty to the Iron Throne. Tyrion Lannister, who had been relieved of his position as acting Hand, was then promoted back to Master of Coin to fill Baelish's absence. Cersei secured Pycelle's release from the dungeons before the battle, and afterwards Tywin reinstated him to the council. As a display of his dominance, Tywin decided to start holding council meetings in the Tower of the Hand, adjacent to his own chambers. The composition of Joffrey's Small Council after the Battle of the Blackwater is:\n\nThe Hand of the King: Lord Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, King Joffrey's grandfather.\n\nQueen Regent Cersei Lannister, King Joffrey's mother\n\nGrand Maester: Pycelle. (Reinstated by Tywin Lannister after the Battle of the Blackwater.)\n\nMaster of Coin: Lord Tyrion Lannister\n\nMaster of Whisperers: Varys\n\nMaster of Laws: (vacant)\n\nMaster of Ships: (vacant)\n\nLord Commander of the Kingsguard: Jaime Lannister. (Re-assumed the position's activities after a years-long absence in captivity and subsequent escape from their grasp.)\n\nUnder Tommen Baratheon[]\n\nFollowing Joffrey's death, the composition of the Small Council remains mostly unchanged, except for Tyrion Lannister, who is imprisoned under charges of regicide. Tywin also offers a seat to Prince Oberyn Martell, the younger brother of Doran Martell, the Prince of Dorne, and Dorne in general. Oberyn was not given a specific office and was not interested in asking for one. Tommen's council members are:\n\nThe Hand of the King: Lord Tywin Lannister.\n\nQueen Regent Cersei Lannister\n\nGrand Maester: Pycelle\n\nMaster of Coin: (vacant)\n\nMaster of Whisperers: Varys\n\nMaster of Laws: (vacant)\n\nMaster of Ships: Lord Mace Tyrell\n\nLord Commander of the Kingsguard: Jaime Lannister\n\nRepresentative of Dorne: Prince Oberyn Martell (new position)\n\nKing Tommen's Small Council changes dramatically after the trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister, in which Oberyn Martell fights as his champion and dies, and the assassination of Tywin Lannister, which also results in Tyrion Lannister and Varys fleeing the city.\n\nWith most positions vacant, Queen Regent Cersei seizes control over the council, and stacks it with sycophants. She pointedly leaves the position of Hand of the King vacant until Tommen is older and selects his own Hand, while sitting in the Hand's chair at meetings. The office of Master of Laws, empty since Renly left the capital, is still left vacant. Cersei makes Mace Tyrell the new Master of Coin, in addition to his current post as Master of Ships. Controversially, Cersei makes the disgraced former maester Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers, over Pycelle's objections, a blunt and disproportionate reward for displaying loyalty to her. Cersei also makes up the new title \"Master of War\" - basically at whim, and despite the fact that it contradicts the title Protector of the Realm - and offers it to her uncle Kevan Lannister. Kevan, however, refuses to become her patsy and goes back to Casterly Rock. As Kevan points out, Cersei is only the queen mother now, and technically doesn't have the right to do any of this: she is no longer even the queen regent, because Tommen has come of legal age and married Margaery Tyrell. Jaime Lannister remains as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, but he volunteered for a secret mission outside the capital to Dorne, which for the moment reduces the Small Council to only four people including Cersei herself. After all of this, Tommen's council members are:\n\nThe Hand of the King: (vacant)\n\nQueen Mother: Cersei Lannister\n\nGrand Maester: Pycelle\n\nMaster of Ships & Master of Coin: Lord Mace Tyrell\n\nMaster of Whisperers: Qyburn\n\nMaster of Laws: (vacant)\n\nLord Commander of the Kingsguard: Jaime Lannister. (Subsequently dismissed as the Lord Commander after the failure of his confrontation with the High Sparrow at the Great Sept of Baelor.)\n\nAfter Cersei's imprisonment by the Faith, Grand Maester Pycelle sends a raven to Casterly Rock asking for Kevan to take the role of Hand of the King, to which Kevan agrees, reorganizing the Small Council as such:\n\nThe Hand of the King: Ser Kevan Lannister, Protector of the Realm and Commander of the Lannister Armies\n\nGrand Maester: Pycelle\n\nMaster of Ships & Master of Coin: Lord Mace Tyrell\n\nMaster of Whisperers: Qyburn\n\nMaster of Laws: (vacant)\n\nIn order to seal the alliance with Dorne, Jaime Lannister promises to have Trystane Martell, Prince Doran's heir, appointed to his uncle's seat on the Council. However, since Trystane's murder, his seat is vacant once more. Moreover, Kevan Lannister removes Qyburn from Council, and he offers a seat to Lady Olenna Tyrell, to which she agrees. After all of this, Tommen's council members are:\n\nThe Hand of the King: Ser Kevan Lannister, Protector of the Realm and Commander of the Lannister Armies\n\nGrand Maester: Pycelle\n\nMaster of Ships & Master of Coin: Lord Mace Tyrell\n\nMaster of Whisperers: (vacant)\n\nMaster of Laws: (vacant)\n\nAdvisor: Lady Olenna Tyrell\n\nSince the failed action against the Faith Militant, Lady Olenna Tyrell abandons King's Landing, at the instigation of her granddaughter. After this, Tommen's council members are:\n\nThe Hand of the King: Ser Kevan Lannister, Protector of the Realm and Commander of the Lannister Armies\n\nGrand Maester: Pycelle\n\nMaster of Ships & Master of Coin: Lord Mace Tyrell\n\nMaster of Whisperers: (vacant)\n\nMaster of Laws: (vacant)\n\nUnder Cersei Lannister[]\n\nAfter the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor and extinction of House Baratheon of King's Landing, Cersei Lannister crowns herself queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Kevan Lannister and Mace Tyrell are killed in the explosion at the Sept along with many others, and Pycelle is assassinated by Qyburn and his little birds. Cersei's council members are:\n\nThe Hand of the Queen & Master of Whisperers: Qyburn\n\nGrand Maester: (unknown)\n\nMaster of Coin: (unknown)\n\nMaster of Laws: (unknown)\n\nLord Commander of the Queensguard: (unknown)\n\nUnder Daenerys Targaryen[]\n\nOnce Daenerys Targaryen decides to rule over Meereen as its queen and enforce her abolition of slavery on Slaver's Bay, she assembles her own ad hoc Small Council, composed of advisors and representatives of the various factions under her rule:\n\nAdvisor and General: Ser Jorah Mormont\n\nCommander of the Second Sons: Daario Naharis\n\nCommander of the Unsullied: Grey Worm\n\nAdvisor and Lord Commander of the Queensguard: Ser Barristan Selmy\n\nAdvisor, translator, and personal handmaiden: Missandei\n\nAfter being exposed as a spy, Jorah Mormont is exiled. Then, Daenerys decides to include a representative for each of the major factions in the population: the former slave masters and the former slaves. Hizdahr zo Loraq, a nobleman at her service, represents the former, while the latter are briefly represented by Mossador, one of the first Meereenese slaves to rise up for her:\n\nRepresentative of the former Great Masters: Hizdahr zo Loraq\n\nRepresentative of Meereen's freedmen: Mossador\n\nCommander of the Unsullied: Grey Worm\n\nCommander of the Second Sons: Daario Naharis\n\nAdvisor and Lord Commander of the Queensguard: Ser Barristan Selmy\n\nAdvisor, translator, and personal handmaiden: Missandei\n\nDuring the struggle against the Sons of the Harpy, Mossador is executed for killing a captive foe without a trial, and Barristan Selmy dies defending the Unsullied from an attack, in which Grey Worm sustains heavy injuries. In order to restore peace, Daenerys decides to reopen the fighting pits and marry Hizdahr zo Loraq. Eventually, Tyrion Lannister arrives from Westeros as Jorah's captive and convinces the Queen to take him into her service. During the reopening of the Great Games at the Great Pit of Daznak, the Sons of the Harpy lead a massacre that results in the death of many, including Hizdahr, and Daenerys herself escapes from Meereen on Drogon's back. In her absence, her followers decide that, while Jorah and Daario track her down, Tyrion will lead the council, as he is the only one with experience governing a city. As Commander of the Unsullied, Grey Worm will enforce the legitimacy of the council, and Missandei, who is Dany's closest confidant, will serve as the queen's voice. In addition, the former Master of Whisperers for the Iron Throne, Varys, joins the Council, bringing his spy network with him. Shortly before Daenerys' return, he temporarily leaves to gain alliances in Westeros. During this time, her council members are:\n\nLeader of the Council: Tyrion Lannister\n\nMaster of Whisperers: Varys\n\nCommander of the Unsullied: Grey Worm\n\nCommander of the Second Sons: Daario Naharis\n\nAdvisor, translator, and personal handmaiden: Missandei\n\nAfter the second siege of Meereen, Daenerys's forces are joined by a fraction of the Iron Fleet led by Yara and Theon Greyjoy. Before she leaves Meereen with her army setting sail for Westeros, she asks Daario Naharis to stay in Meereen and she names Tyrion Lannister as Hand of the Queen. Varys returns to Meereen with allies from Dorne and House Tyrell. After all of this, Daenerys' council members are:\n\nThe Hand of the Queen: Tyrion Lannister\n\nMaster of Whisperers: Varys\n\nCommander of the Unsullied: Grey Worm\n\nCommander of the Iron Fleet: Queen Yara Greyjoy\n\nRepresentative of Dorne: Ellaria Sand\n\nRepresentative of the Reach: Lady Olenna Tyrell\n\nAdvisor, translator, and personal handmaiden: Missandei\n\nDuring the Last War, Olenna, Ellaria and Yara are all captured or killed by the Lannister/Greyjoy alliance and Grey Worm and the Unsullied are stranded at Casterly Rock. However, Daenerys gains an alliance with the King in the North Jon Snow by permitting and aiding him in mining dragonglass to be turned into weapons against the White Walkers. After her enormous victory at the Battle of the Goldroad and the return of Jorah Mormont, Daenerys' council members are:\n\nThe Hand of the Queen: Tyrion Lannister\n\nMaster of Whisperers: Varys\n\nCommander of the Unsullied: Grey Worm\n\nRepresentative of the North and the Vale: King Jon Snow\n\nAdditional Representative and Advisor: Ser Davos Seaworth\n\nAdvisor, translator, and personal handmaiden: Missandei\n\nAdvisor and General: Ser Jorah Mormont\n\nJon eventually bent the knee to Daenerys after she saved him and his band beyond the Wall, renouncing his title as king and accepting her offer of becoming Warden of the North. He and Davos still remain on her Small Council and travel north to fight in the Great War.\n\nAfter the Battle of Winterfell and the Battle of King's Landing, the executions of Missandei on the orders of Cersei and Varys by Daenerys for Treason and the end of the Great War and the Last War, Queen Daenerys's remaining council members are:\n\nThe Hand of the Queen: Tyrion Lannister (resigned)\n\nCommander of the Unsullied and Master of War: Grey Worm\n\nRepresentative and Warden of the North: Jon Snow\n\nUnder Brandon Stark[]\n\nFollowing the election of Bran Stark as king of the Six Kingdoms in a Great Council in the Dragonpit, Daenerys' Small Council consists of:\n\nHand of the King: Lord Tyrion Lannister\n\nGrand Maester: Samwell\n\nMaster of Coin: Lord Bronn\n\nMaster of Laws: (unknown after Bran's audiences)\n\nMaster of Whisperers: (unknown after Bran's audiences)\n\nMaster of War: (unknown after Bran's audiences)\n\nMaster of Ships: Lord Davos Seaworth\n\nLord Commander of the Kingsguard: Ser Brienne of Tarth\n\nIn the books[]\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Small Council was the creation of King Aegon I, assembled to advise him and carry out policy. The Small Council is similar to a privy council in real-life medieval monarchies.\n\nIn the novels the council has an additional member: the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, who advises the king on various matters, particularly military ones. In the TV series, Barristan Selmy is never shown to be a member, the reason is explained in the Season 3 episode \"Kissed by Fire\". The reason for this was apparently due to the decision to have Barristan openly reveal his identity to Daenerys Targaryen as soon as he meets her. In the books, he initially hid his true identity, and told her his name was \"Arstan Whitebeard\". Because Barristan did attend Small Council meetings in the first novel, he knew that Jorah Mormont had been spying on Daenerys for Varys and King Robert. Because he was hiding his identity, however, he did not reveal this information as soon as he met Daenerys. In the TV version, Barristan does reveal his identity to Daenerys as soon as he meets her, probably because it is easy to make such a narrative deception in a book but this doesn't translate well into the visual medium of television. This of course means that if Barristan knew of Jorah's spying from attending Small Council meetings (in Season 1), there would be no reason for him not to reveal Jorah's spying to Daenerys when he first meets her at the beginning of Season 3. The simple answer the writers apparently settled on is to say that in the TV continuity, Barristan rarely attended Small Council meetings, because King Robert didn't like having a Targaryen loyalist around when he was discussing the realm's strategies (specifically, to send assassins to kill the Targaryen exiles - in the books, Barristan objected to this along with Ned Stark).\n\nIn the books, Jaime rarely attends the council by choice, since he is not interested in politics. The only time he attended the council (in the third novel), he soon got bored and his mind went elsewhere; before the meeting was over, he excused himself and walked away, leaving to his uncle to take care of whatever was discussed.\n\nThe Commander of the City Guard is not technically a member of the council but often sits in on its meetings to report on conditions in the capital city. Janos Slynt was rewarded with an official seat on the council for his betrayal of Ned Stark. However, Tywin Lannister considers this preposterous when he hears of it due to Janos' common-born status, indicating that the Commander of the City Guard is still not quite considered to be a full council member. Indeed, one of Tywin's specific instructions to Tyrion when he sent him to King's Landing as acting Hand was to remove Janos from the council. In the TV series, it is implied that Tyrion's disgust at Janos' involvement in the purge of Robert's bastard children was the sole reason that he removed Janos, and no specific mention is made of Tywin's instructions. In the books, Tyrion was also disgusted at Janos' actions, but this just gave him greater impetus to carry out his father's instructions (either way, Tyrion removes Janos in the TV series soon after he arrives in King's Landing; in the books as well, he didn't kick him out immediately simply because he had other matters to attend to first).\n\nApart from Tywin, Varys was appointed Master of Whisperers during Aerys Targaryen's reign. Grand Maester Pycelle held his position even before Aerys ascended to the throne. Wisdom Rossart, a pyromancer, was made Hand of the King, during the final weeks of Robert's Rebellion. Varys and Pycelle would retain their positions after Robert Baratheon ascended to the Iron Throne. The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook (2014) finally revealed who the other three members of the Mad King's Small Council were: Master of Coin Qarlton Chelsted, Master of Ships Lucerys Velaryon, and Master of Laws Symond Staunton. After Tywin resigned, Owen Merryweather served as Hand of the King for a few years - an amiable sycophant who failed to quickly respond to Robert's Rebellion when it started, for which he was stripped of his lands and titles and replaced by Jon Connington, until Aerys exiled him as well after his defeat at the Battle of the Bells. Aerys replaced him as Hand by promoting Chelsted to the office, but he later had Chelsted burned alive for refusing to go along with his Wildfire plot. Wisdom Rossart was then made hand for the better part of two weeks, before Jaime Lannister killed him and the Mad King during the Sack of King's Landing. It isn't known what happened to Lucerys Velaryon and Symond Staunton.\n\nAfter Robert became king, he pardoned Varys and allowed him to keep his position, as did Pycelle (who as a politically neutral maester was sworn to serve his castle's ruler, and was only doing his job when he stood by the Mad King - though he did later convince him to open the gates to Tywin's army). Barristan Selmy became the new Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, and Jon Arryn became the new Hand of the King. Robert's brother Stannis was immediately named the new Master of Ships, but two other men initially served as Robert's Master of Coin and Master of Laws, whose identities have not yet been revealed. Renly was a child during the war, and he was only appointed Master of Laws some years later. Littlefinger also only became Master of Coin some years later, after his work as a customs officers at Gulltown increased port revenues tenfold and impressed Jon Arryn enough to take him to the royal court.\n\nAfter Tywin Lannister resumes his post as Hand of the King after the Battle of the Blackwater, his dismisses his daughter Cersei from the Small Council. Technically as Queen Regent she still has some right to be there, and in practice Tywin does have her physically sit at several important council meetings when he is explaining his plans. However, Tywin makes it clear that he will not let Cersei wield power under him, and when she is present at the council it is just so she can hear Tywin's plans so she can quietly obey them: he doesn't let her take a leading role in the council's discussions. Similarly, in the TV series, Cersei is still shown physically sitting at Small Council meetings, but for the most part she sits silently as her father leads the discussion.\n\nWhen Tywin resumes his position as Hand of the King, he also sets about reordering the rest of the Small Council, in particular, that Cersei and Joffrey embarrassingly left the positions of Master of Laws and Master of Ships vacant for over a year. He appoints his brother Kevan Lannister as the new Master of Laws, and Mace Tyrell as the new Master of Ships (as a reward for allying with House Lannister. In Season 5, Kevan reappears and states that he only just returned to the capital for Tywin's funeral, indicating that he was commanding Lannister armies in the field up until this point, and was never made Master of Laws in the TV version. Even after Cersei reorganizes the council upon her father's death, the office of Master of Laws remains vacant.\n\nCersei's Small Council[]\n\nThe Small Council was gutted after the loss in rapid succession of Littlefinger, and then Tyrion, Tywin, and Varys. Littlefinger returned to the Vale, while Tyrion was falsely arrested for allegedly poisoning Joffrey; Tyrion later escaped and fled Westeros, but not before murdering his own father Tywin; for his role in helping Tyrion escape, Varys also fled into hiding. Of the original Small Council when Joffrey seized power, only Pycelle still remained.\n\nIn Season 5's \"The House of Black and White\", Cersei restaffs the Small Council by stacking it with sycophants, to make its offices just puppets while she functionally rules as the actual monarch in all but name. In the fourth novel, Cersei's corresponding takeover of the Small Council and stacking it with incompetent cronies was a major running plotline affecting politics in the capital city. The TV version significantly condenses this, though keeping the general thematic points the same:\n\nIn the novels, Cersei appointed Harys Swyft (Kevan's own father-in-law) as the new Hand of the King, Orton Merryweather as Master of Laws, Gyles Rosby as Master of Coin, and Aurane Waters as Master of Ships. She appointed Qyburn as the new Master of Whisperers (spymaster) in both the books and TV series. Mace Tyrell was the Master of Ships under Tywin (because after the royal fleet got destroyed at the Battle of the Blackwater they need the Tyrell's large fleet), but Cersei grew so distrustful of the Tyrells that she removed him from the office and sent him to besiege Stannis's remaining garrison at Storm's End. Since the council practically consisted of Cersei and her henchmen, it was publicly ridiculed as \"the smallest council\". Littlefinger scornfully refers to the three new members in the council as \"the deaf, the dim, and the blind\".\n\nGiven that these characters were not introduced in the TV series before and the audience wouldn't be familiar with them, Cersei's reshuffling of the Small Council in the TV version is condensed: Cersei isn't bothering to name a new Hand of the King at all, shockingly leaving the office vacant while functioning ruling over the council. In the novels, Cersei is technically still Tommen's regent - but in the TV version, Cersei has lost the regency: Kevan specifically says that she is only the queen mother, and makes no mention of being a regent. The queen mother has no right to sit on the council if not a regent (though a king can in theory invite any advisors he wants onto his council - but Tommen isn't even present). Mace Tyrell is retained, and simply made both Master of Ships and Master of Coin. Qyburn is the new Master of Whisperers, and Pycelle remains Grand Maester. As Kevan was apparently going to point out, as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, her brother Jaime is also supposed to be a member of the Small Council, but he has left the capital, though as it turns out, he volunteered to leave, to deal with events outside the city, rather than be at the company of \"the lickspittles and fools who surrounded Cersei\", as he disdainfully regarded the council.\n\nIn the TV version, Cersei offers to make her uncle Kevan Lannister his Master of War - even though there is no such thing as a \"Master of War\". The crown's armies are commanded by the \"Protector of the Realm\" (usually the king, unless he is underaged, incapacitated or chooses to bestow the title to a more competent figure), who in turn commands the four Wardens. This reflects a more complex development in the novels, in which Cersei basically starts making up titles on the Small Council, at her whim (which she technically doesn't have the right to do either). In an act of petty resentment, she comes to loathe the idea of anyone else calling himself \"master\" in his title on the Small Council, feeling this means a loss of control. Therefore, she picks new names based on a few titles from the Free Cities: the Master of Coin is renamed the \"Lord Treasurer\", the Master of Ships is renamed the \"Grand Admiral\", and the Master of Laws is renamed the \"Justiciar\". She offers Kevan to become the new Hand of the King, but he bluntly refuses her after she refuses to give up the regency, openly telling her that she failed as a mother to raise Joffrey, and demands that she yield over custody of Tommen. She refuses, and he returns to Casterly Rock. Essentially the same plot development happens in the TV version, though significantly condensing these characters and plotlines.\n\nKevan's Small Council[]\n\nFollowing Cersei's arrest, she is stripped of all power, and all her henchmen either flee, removed from their offices or arrested. Kevan takes upon himself to amend the damages his niece caused during her reign, and forms a council of capable people, with consideration of the political aspects:\n\nLord Regent - Kevan Lannister, Protector of the Realm\n\nHand of the King - Mace Tyrell\n\nGrand Maester - Pycelle\n\nMaster of Laws/justiciar - Randyll Tarly\n\nMaster of Coin/Lord Treasurer - Harys Swyft\n\nMaster of Ships/grand admiral - Paxter Redwyne\n\nLord Commander of the Kingsguard - Jaime Lannister\n\nAdvisor - Nymeria Sand (representing Doran Martell)\n\nThe fact that three seats are taken by House Tyrell and its bannermen worries Kevan, but he knows it is necessary to appease the Lannisters' main allies, something Cersei failed to understand. In spite of this potential problem, Kevan and his Small Council are so effective that Varys feels the need to personally assassinate both Kevan and Pycelle, since they have already started to make headway in reversing the damage Cersei had done to the realm.\n\nReferences[]\n\nNotes[]\n\n[]"
