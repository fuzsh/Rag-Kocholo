        "text": "Guidelines For Local Elections from Supreme Advocate\n\nThese guidelines in this entry only apply to local council elections and in general apply to chapters.\n\nSection 126 of the Laws of the Knights of Columbus establishes the offices for local councils.\n\nSection 128 of the Laws requires local councils to hold annual elections for council officers.\n\nElections are to be conducted in accordance with Robert’s Rules of Order.\n\nSection 162 of the Laws of the Knights of Columbus establishes certain categories of misconduct that may expose a member to disciplinary action.

While he may promote his candidacy by highlighting his own qualifications, he may not comment negatively about any opponent. A candidate is responsible for any third parties acting on his behalf. All elections must be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the principles of charity, unity, and fraternity.\n\nA candidate for local council office may:\n\nReceive a nominating speech from another member of the council in which the nominating member sets forth the character and qualifications of the candidate; and (hold to three minutes)\n\nMake a brief statement accepting the nomination, in which he states his own qualifications. (hold to 3 minutes)\n\nA candidate for local council office may not:\n\nUse, accept, or receive council funds to support his candidacy in any manner whatsoever;\n\nDistribute campaign buttons, t-shirts, pins, hats, bumper stickers, or any other souvenirs or promotional items;\n\nSend mailings or e-mails, or use social media to support his candidacy;\n\nArrange or participate in debates with other candidates or their supporters;\n\nCampaign or have promotional items in the chambers of any business meeting, or within close proximity to the entrance of any business meeting;\n\nCampaign or have promotional items at or outside any religious ceremony;\n\nDisseminate any type of derogatory information concerning another candidate; or\n\nHold a fund-raising event to finance his candidacy.\n\nIf a candidate or member knowingly and willfully violates these guidelines, he may be subject to disciplinary action.\n\nRev.
