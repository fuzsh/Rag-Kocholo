Accept the ones that cannot and have the wisdom to know the difference.\n\nWhat’s your guilty pleasure?\n\nChocolate\n\nWhat is the most adventurous thing you’ve ever done?\n\nClimbing to the summit of Mt. Fuji in Japan and hiking to Everest Base Camp with my son.\n\nGlobal Head, Tailored Urethanes\n\nChristine Bryant is the global head of Tailored Urethanes at Covestro.

What’s your favorite movie?\n\nI have multiple favorite movies depending on the genre and my mood. The film I quote the most is “The American President” and a line by Michael J. Fox about communication and leadership, but I wouldn’t say that it’s my favorite film. Nobody should or will credit me as a movie aficionado with this list, but some of the ones I would watch anytime they come on are: “Jaws,” “Sliding Doors,” “Shawshank Redemption,” “Four Weddings and a Funeral,” “Pretty Woman,” “Bridget Jones’ Diary,” “The Strangers” and “Silence of the Lambs.” I also insist on “Love Actually” every Christmas.\n\n2. Do you have a favorite quote or philosophy that you live by?\n\nThere are two adages that I like, but they are a mixture of the same philosophy. The first is “always assume positive intent,” and the second is “assume you are 60% of the problem.” It’s easy to get caught up in frustrations, but I really aim to go into situations or issues with a positive outlook and with a solutions orientation. I find that it leads to a quicker and more successful outcome and paves the path for better future interactions.\n\n3. What’s your perfect vacation?\n\nOur family likes to alternate our vacations between ones that are very active, where we travel and see new places and try new things, and ones that are more low key, where we stay in one place by the beach and/or pool and relax, read books, play games, and bike or walk everywhere rather than using the car.\n\n4. Where can you be found on a Saturday night?\n\nOur kids are still young, so it’s usually an activity for them. Depending on the season, it could be hockey, soccer, baseball, karate or swimming and sometimes a combination of running between multiple of those! If we do have a “night off,” then we enjoy playing games or cards (so you would think that my skill at the latter would improve…but it doesn’t!).\n\n5. With what person, living or dead, would you most like to have dinner?\n\nOther than my family and friends, with whom I very much enjoy having dinner, I think I would pick the Queen of England….as long as she would talk candidly. I am amazed by the amount of change she has seen in her lifetime and in her role and by the number of world leaders with whom she has interacted. She has had to respond and adapt a lot during her reign (albeit often not reacted/adapted quickly enough).\n\nVice President, General Counsel, Secretary and Compliance Officer\n\nCovestro LLC\n\nDave Rzepecki is head of Law, Intellectual Property & Compliance for the Americas region and a member of the U.S. Country Council. His department provides corporate, litigation, compliance and intellectual property counsel to all Covestro business and service units.\n\nDave joined Bayer MaterialScience LLC (predecessor to Covestro) in 2007. During his tenure with Covestro, he has provided comprehensive legal support to various departments within the company. In 2010, Dave assumed the role of counsel to the Polyurethanes business unit. He also managed a team providing legal services to the procurement, government affairs, finance, accounting, controlling and tax functions.\n\nPrior to joining the company, Dave served as assistant general counsel at Rent-Way, Inc and worked in private practice.

What did you want to be when you grew up?\n\nI wanted to be something different depending on which day you asked, but F.B.I. agent and animated film singer were on the list for quite some time. I can still recite the Miranda warning and the lyrics to almost any Disney song from the 90s.\n\n2. What was your first job?\n\nI was the neighborhood babysitter from about the age of 12 onward. At 15, I started my first steady job working the coat check at a local restaurant.\n\n3. What’s your favorite movie?\n\n“Wizard of Oz” was my favorite movie as a child. I have to say, it still holds up.\n\n4. What’s your guilty pleasure?\n\nI have a real weakness for French fries. If they’re on the menu, I will order them. If they’re on my plate, they are the first to go.\n\n5. What is the most adventurous thing you’ve ever done?\n\nI once went skydiving in Hawaii, which was an AMAZING experience, but one that I’m not sure I would have the courage to repeat.\n\nHead, Group Innovation and Sustainability – North America\n\nCovestro LLC\n\nAs head of Group Innovation and Sustainability for North America, Dr. Jim Charron leads a team of researchers, scientists and technicians to execute Covestro’s global innovation strategy for the region while leveraging global competencies.

He is the author of numerous publications and patents.\n\nTake Five\n\n1. What drew you to Covestro?\n\nDivestiture from Bayer MaterialScience (kidding). Seriously, I joined the chemical industry with a curiosity for the unknown – that next cool polymer or application. I’ve stayed because of the people, the diverse knowledge and abilities of our employees, and the many industry relationships I’ve developed over the years.\n\n2. What’s the oddest thing on your desk?\n\nWhen working from home, the oddest thing IS my desk. It’s an old air hockey table covered in a large sheet of cardboard so I don’t plug the holes with dirt. Pretty spacious and ergonomic, too!\n\n3. Where can you be found on a Saturday night?\n\nTypically having dinner with my wife (empty nesters) at a place that we can walk to following her day job.\n\n4. Where in the world would you like to visit that you haven’t been to yet and why?\n\nThe African Continent. It must be a whole different world from what I’m used to. I would love to see the culture and people\n\n5. What was the most fun thing that you’ve ever done?\n\nMaybe not the MOST fun thing, but a very fun time combining a guilty pleasure movie (“Talladega Nights”) with a few laps around Lernerville Speedway near Pittsburgh. “What were those things? Were those the other cars?!”\n\nHead, Supply Chain and Logistics, Covestro LLC\n\nAppointed head of Supply Chain and Logistics (SC&L) in 2024, Bruce Sullivan leads the entire end-to-end SC&L function in the North America region.

In addition to playing basketball himself, he enjoys world history and travel.\n\nTake Five:\n\nWhat was your first job?\n\nMy first summer job was as a Spanish language assistant teacher in Malmö, Sweden, where I basically had to go to a high school and talk to local students about teenager topics in Spanish. Being a teenager myself, it was not a hard job at all! Later as a chemical engineering student, I worked a few months at a sherry winery in Xerez, Spain, to remove KHT crystals from white wine through cooling.\n\nDo you have a favorite quote or philosophy that you live by?\n\n“Every step we take on earth brings us to a new world.” Federico Garcia Lorca\n\nBut I also very much like Mike Tysons’ “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face” – figurative speaking, of course.\n\nWith what person, living or dead, would you most like to have dinner?\n\nDifficult question, since I’m fascinated with history. Let me say Roman emperor Trajan since we were both born in the same region. I’m curious how the Romans managed to master their engineering knowledge, government and social structure for so long. The conversation (most likely an interview with him) would be interesting.\n\nWhat was the most fun thing that you’ve ever done?\n\nThe high school parents team played basketball against the junior varsity team my oldest son was on. I laugh whenever I remember the ref calling a technical foul on me after my son scored in my face. I told him he was grounded without dinner! I didn’t mean it, of course. 😊\n\nWho has influenced you the most in your life and why?\n\nMy father was always a source of inspiration. He had to go through a lot in his life. He lived during one of the darkest times in the history of Spain, but he and his generation managed to give the next one better opportunities. I learned from him that there’s no problem – even big ones – that you can’t address with a smile."
