        "text": "Elissa Slotkin, Mike Rogers advance to general election in closely watched race for Michigan’s open U.S. Senate seat\n\nRepublican state Reps. Neil Friske and Bob Bezotte won’t return to Lansing after losing Tuesday primaries\n\nU.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar survives a spirited Democratic primary. Four other congressional races expected to be among most competitive\n\nLANSING — Michigan Republicans and Democrats alike are touting momentum as they head into the fall general election despite some bruises and a few unexpected losses in the Tuesday primary.\n\nFirst-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar of Detroit survived a spirited primary challenge, but two Republican state legislators did not: Reps. Neil Friske of Charlevoix and Bob Bezotte of Howell each lost.\n\nThe results set the stage for what is expected to be a competitive November general election that could be defined by the top of the ticket, where Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are locked in a tight race for the chance to lead the country for the next four years.\n\nRelated:\n\nTurnout dips throughout Michigan amid heavy rains, early voting, apathy\n\nAlpena voters approve library tax, despite fuss over sex-themed books\n\nDemocrats are seeking to retain a narrow two-seat majority in the Michigan House, which Republicans hope to flip to deny Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a governing “trifecta” during her final two years in office.\n\nAt the federal level, Michigan will be home to a high-profile U.S. Senate race and what experts say could be four of the most competitive U.S. House races in the country.\n\nHere’s what you need to know following Tuesday’s primary:\n\nIt’s Slokin, Rogers in a marquee U.S. Senate race\n\nIn the night’s biggest contest, Democrat Elissa Slotkin and Republican Mike Rogers won their respective primaries and will square off in the general election for the chance to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow.\n\nU.S. Senate seats rarely come open – Stabenow held this once since 2001 – and the Michigan race is expected to be among the most competitive in the country as Democrats seek to defend their narrow voting majority in the upper chamber.\n\nSlotkin currently serves in the U.S. House, and Rogers did previously. They both have national security backgrounds, and have both won close elections before.\n\nHigh-stakes U.S. House matchups set\n\nThe Tuesday primary narrowed the field in U.S. House races, including four that experts predict will be among the nation’s most competitive, which could bring a flood of outside spending and ads to the state:\n\nIn west Michigan’s 3rd District, attorney Paul Hudson won a contentious Republican primary and will now face first-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten of Grand Rapids.\n\nIn the mid-Michigan’s 7th District, Democrat Curtis Hertel and Republican Tom Barrett each ran unopposed and will now compete in the general election to succeed Slotkin, who gave up the seat to run for U.S. Senate.\n\nIn the Flint-based 8th District, Republican Paul Junge and Democrat Kristen McDonald Rivet won their respective primaries on Tuesday and will compete to replace outgoing U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee.\n\nIn Macomb County’s 10th District, former Judge Carl Marlinga won a contested Democratic primary to set up a rematch with first-term U.S. Rep. John James, R-Shelby Township.\n\nAll other incumbents won primaries: U.S. Reps. Jack Bergman of Watersmeet, John Moolenaar of Midland, Bill Huizenga of Zealand, Tim Walberg of Tipton, Debbie Dingell of Ann Arbor, Lisa McClain of Bruce Township, Haley Stevens of Birmingham and Rashida Tlaib of Detroit.\n\nFriske, Bezotte lose state House seats\n\nRepublicans attempting to flip the Michigan House this fall will have two fewer incumbents on the ballot after Friske and Bezotte lost their respective primaries. Both were mired in controversy in the run-up to the election.\n\nFriske, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was arrested by Lansing police in June — but not charged — following an incident involving a firearm. He was defeated by Parker Fairbairn,\n\nBezotte, a Livingston County Republican, lost the primary to Jason Woolford. After his wife accused him of abuse in divorce filings, Bezotte initially opted against running for reelection and later had to fight a ballot disqualification.\n\nOttawa Impact is out\n\nIn west Michigan, the ultra-conservative Ottawa Impact faction will lose its governing majority on the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners next year after a majority of its endorsed candidates lost Tuesday night.\n\nThat will end a two-year run for Ottawa Impact, which sparked controversy for changing a county motto that members claimed promoted a “Marxist ideology” and attempting to fire a health officer and replace her with a former employee of an HVAC company, among other things.\n\nThanedar survives primary challenge\n\nIn Detroit’s 13th District, Thanedar fended off a Democratic primary challenge from City Council member Mary Waters, who had the backing of some big local names, including Mayor Mike Duggan.\n\nHe appeared to do so in convincing fashion despite results that were posted earlier in the evening that had pointed to a potentially close race. He’s now all but assured a second term in the heavily Democratic district, continuing to leave Detroit without Black representation in Congress.\n\nLosses for men acquitted in Whitmer kidnapping\n\nThe primary proved a tough election for two men who decided to run for office after they were acquitted of charges stemming from the failed 2020 plot to kidnap and murder Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer."
