        "text": "Widely known as “The Most Serene Republic of San Marino or Serenissima Repubblica di San Marino”, the country is also famous for providing shelter to Giuseppe Garibaldi during his attempts to bring Italy under a single head in the 1860s. The reason behind San Marino’s existence as an autonomous state is the promise made by Garibaldi.\n\nLocated at the Southern part of Europe, todays San Marino, apart from being one of the smallest nations in the world, is also a European microstate ranking after Vatican and Monaco; San Marino is dominated by the Apennines mountain range and is situated in the continent’s southern part, near the borders of Italy.\n\nGeography\n\nPlaced between the regions of Emilia-Romagna and Marche on the border of Italy, San Marino’s topography reveals the Apennines mountain range as its prime feature. The tract of San Marino is rugged by nature, with its highest point being the Monte Titano. The peak stands at a height of 749 m above the sea level; however, no prominent or significant water bodies are present within San Marino. Area wise, San Marino ranks as the third-smallest within Europe; the Vatican City and Monaco being the others to follow.\n\nClimate\n\nBeing near and a part of Italy, San Marino has the typical Mediterranean climate - the warm summers and the mild winters being the most prominent features.\n\nHistory\n\nSan Marino, the autonomous nation, though depends largely on Italy, is the oldest republic of the world that still happens to exist. Credits for laying its foundation stones go to St. Marinus, a skilled craftsman who initiated the whole process in the year 301 CE. A part of the then existing Roman Empire, the written constitution for San Marino was adopted on October 8, 1600. The country came into limelight for the first time in 1797; the responsibility for which goes to France under the rule of Napoleon and then by the other European nations in the 1815 Congress of Vienna. It’s since then that San Marino is considered a territory of Italy.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe tourism industry of San Marino occupies more than 50% of the economic sector (GDP); the government, apart from earning through taxes and customs, also promotes the sale of coins and postage stamps. The Italian Government pays San Marino an annual budget subsidy provided under the terms of the Basic Treaty with Italy. Although not an official European Union member, the use of the euro is allowed by virtue of arrangements with the council of the European Union.\n\nCable car in San Marino"
