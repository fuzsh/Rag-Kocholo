Her pioneering work included dramatically increasing federal, state and local law enforcement's ability to track crime guns and overseeing the launch of the Commonwealth Investigator Training Program, a new, state-of-the-art training curriculum, developed with other state agencies and run by the Office of Attorney General for all civil and criminal investigators in Pennsylvania.\n\nPrior to her appointment at the Office of Attorney General, Ms. Selber served as the Chief of the Homicide Unit in the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office.
