He served as superintendent from November 2014 to January 2020 when Lawrenceburg City Council voted to relieve him of his duties amid allegations of unapproved spending.\n\nCourt documents show that the City, SBOA and the State have recovered a total of $83,320.38 from applicable insurance and/or bond coverage relating to the audit report in 2022.\n\nAttorney General Rokita is requesting that the court enter judgement for the State and against Clawson in the amount of $152,197.38, minus the amount of $83,320.38, for a total amount of $68,877.00. The State is also requesting additional damages in the amount of $166,640.76.\n\nThe last action in the case occurred on June 20 when Answer and Affirmation Defenses were filed by Clawson. That document, along with the Complaint filed by Rokita can be viewed below.\n\nComplaint Filed by Rokita\n\nAnswer Filed by Clawson\n\nAs far as the criminal case, a jury trial has been rescheduled several times and is currently slated for November 18.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\nFormer LMU Superintendent Facing Multiple Felony Charges\n\nLawrenceburg City Council Votes Out LMU Director Olin Clawson\n\nUPDATE: Lawrenceburg City Council Settles $1 Million LMU Payment\n\n$1.3M Utility Pole Project Explained; City, LMU Appear Ready To Settle It At $1M\n\nElection Opponent, LMU Director & Former Councilman Question L'burg Mayor's Sewer Pump Purchase"
