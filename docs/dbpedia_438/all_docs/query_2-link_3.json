        "text": "Voting system Proportional: Party-list system with proportional representation of seats using the d'Hondt method.\n\n- Voters may either vote for an election coalition or one of the parties in the coalition. A voter may cast a preferential vote for one candidate on the list for which he/she voted.\n\n- Electoral coalitions must present the composition of their prospective government and programmes before polling day.\n\n- The threshold to win parliamentary representation is determined by multiplying the number of lists participating in the elections by 0.4 (for instance, if there are six lists, the threshold would be 2.4 per cent). The maximum threshold is fixed at 3.5 per cent of the valid votes, regardless of the number of lists.\n\n-To be allowed to form a new Government, a list must obtain more than one half of the valid votes cast or a minimum of 30 seats. If no list meets this requirement, a second round will be held two weeks after the first round between the two lists that obtained the highest number of votes. With a view to ensuring a stable government, the winning list will be given \"bonus seats\" to secure a minimum of 35 seats.\n\n- Seats within the list will firstly be attributed to candidates who received the highest number of preference votes. In case of a tie, preference will be given to women candidates, followed by duration of service as an MP and then in descending order of age.\n\n- The \"next-in-line\" candidate of the same party list fills seats that become vacant between general elections.\n\n- The Great and General Council is wholly renewed if it loses one half plus one of its members.\n\nVoting is not compulsory."
