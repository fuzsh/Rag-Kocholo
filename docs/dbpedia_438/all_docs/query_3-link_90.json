        "text": "Beaumont City Councilman Audwin Samuel failed to get a second to his motion to direct the Beaumont City Attorney to ask for a Texas Attorney General's opinion on the initial council vote July 12 to reject the City Manager's appointment of Troy Price as chief, to determine if council interfered with the City Manager's duties in the hiring of a new police chief.\n\nOn July 30, council affirmed the appointment of Tim Ocnaschek as BPD Chief.\n\nSamuel voted to confirm Troy Price, and he voted to confirm Tim Ocnaschek, who is now the BPD Chief, but he believes the city charter says council can't interfere with the city manager's duties in appointing a police or fire chief.\n\nThe City Attorney says the Texas Government Code allows councils to confirm or reject the appointment of a police chief, or ask for more consideration of the process, and it does not constitute interference."
