Problem solver\n\nWhat is one accomplishment/contribution from your time at the Council that you’re especially proud of? Creation of the Leadership Academy for Excellence in Disability Services (Council note: This program is the only one of its kind in the nation!

Being a systems improvement advocate from within the system.\n\nWhen should people contact you directly for help?

Catching up on sleep while cuddling with one of my pets.\n\nWhat pets do you have/what is your favorite animal and why? I have three cats.

In a world where people notice gaps or obstacles in the services system, the Council suits up to get to work building bridges and connecting dots to close the gaps and eliminate obstacles.

We’re going into meetings with the faces and names of Tennesseans these programs impact regularly. Sometimes it takes time, but our track record is pretty great!\n\nWhen should people contact you directly for help?
