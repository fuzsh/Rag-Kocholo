The manufacturing and financial sectors account for more than half of San Marino's GDP. The per capita level of output and standard of living are comparable to those of the most prosperous regions of Italy.San Marino's economy contracted considerably in the years since 2008, largely due to weakened demand from Italy - which accounts for nearly 90% of its export market - and financial sector consolidation. Difficulties in the banking sector, the global economic downturn, and the sizable decline in tax revenues all contributed to negative real GDP growth. The government adopted measures to counter the downturn, including subsidized credit to businesses and is seeking to shift its growth model away from a reliance on bank and tax secrecy. San Marino does not issue public debt securities; when necessary, it finances deficits by drawing down central bank deposits.The economy benefits from foreign investment due to its relatively low corporate taxes and low taxes on interest earnings. The income tax rate is also very low, about one-third the average EU level. San Marino continues to work towards harmonizing its fiscal laws with EU and international standards. In September 2009, the OECD removed San Marino from its list of tax havens that have yet to fully adopt global tax standards, and in 2010 San Marino signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements with most major countries. In 2013, the San Marino Government signed a Double Taxation Agreement with Italy, but a referendum on EU membership failed to reach the quorum needed to bring it to a vote.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$2.064 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$2.026 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$1.983 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 195\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$1.643 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n1.9% (2017 est.)\n\n2.2% (2016 est.)\n\n0.6% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 157\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$59,000 (2017 est.)\n\n$59,600 (2016 est.)\n\n$58,300 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 20\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: NA (2011 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: NA (2011 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: NA (2011 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: NA (2011 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 176.6% (2011)\n\nimports of goods and services: -153.3% (2011)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 0.1% (2009)\n\nindustry: 39.2% (2009)\n\nservices: 60.7% (2009)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\nwheat, grapes, corn, olives; cattle, pigs, horses, beef, cheese, hides\n\nIndustries\n\ntourism, banking, textiles, electronics, ceramics, cement, wine\n\nIndustrial production growth rate\n\n-1.1% (2012 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 178\n\nLabor force\n\n21,960 (September 2013 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 211\n\nLabor force - by occupation\n\nagriculture: 0.2%\n\nindustry: 33.5%\n\nservices: 66.3% (September 2013 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate\n\n8.1% (2017 est.)\n\n8.6% (2016 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 118\n\nPopulation below poverty line\n\nNA\n\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share\n\nlowest 10%: NA\n\nhighest 10%: NA\n\nBudget\n\nrevenues: 667.7 million (2011 est.)\n\nexpenditures: 715.3 million (2011 est.)\n\nTaxes and other revenues\n\n40.6% (of GDP) (2011 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 36\n\nBudget surplus (+) or deficit (-)\n\n-2.9% (of GDP) (2011 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 129\n\nPublic debt\n\n24.1% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n22.5% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 180\n\nFiscal year\n\ncalendar year\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices)\n\n1% (2017 est.)\n\n0.6% (2016 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 53\n\nCommercial bank prime lending rate\n\n5.92% (31 December 2011 est.)\n\n5.38% (31 December 2010 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 127\n\nStock of narrow money\n\n$1.326 billion (31 December 2007)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 147\n\nStock of broad money\n\n$4.584 billion (31 December 2007)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 113\n\nStock of domestic credit\n\n$8.822 billion (30 September 2010)\n\n$8.008 billion (31 December 2009)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 112\n\nMarket value of publicly traded shares\n\nNA\n\nCurrent account balance\n\n$0 (2017 est.)\n\n$0 (2016 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 67\n\nExports\n\n$3.827 billion (2011 est.)\n\n$2.576 billion (2010 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 119\n\nExports - commodities\n\nbuilding stone, lime, wood, chestnuts, wheat, wine, baked goods, hides, ceramics\n\nImports\n\n$2.551 billion (2011 est.)\n\n$2.132 billion (2010 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 157\n\nImports - commodities\n\nwide variety of consumer manufactures, food, energy\n\nReserves of foreign exchange and gold\n\n$392 million (2014 est.)\n\n$539.3 million (2013 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 161\n\nDebt - external\n\nNA\n\nExchange rates\n\neuros (EUR) per US dollar -\n\n0.885 (2017 est.)\n\n0.903 (2016 est.)\n\n0.9214 (2015 est.)\n\n0.885 (2014 est.)\n\n0.7634 (2013 est.)"
