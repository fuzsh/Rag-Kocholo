Meetings begin with Closed Session at 5:30 p.m. followed by the Regular Meeting at 6:30 p.m.\n\nDistricts\n\nThe City of Lake Forest began the transition to district-based elections in 2018. Districts 1 and 5 will have seats open in the November 5, 2024 General Election. Candidates must be 18 years of age, registered to vote in Lake Forest, and have their primary residence located within district boundaries.\n\nDistrict 1 Map District 5 Map\n\nClick here for an interactive map to determine your Council District.\n\nPolitical Reform Act and the Fair Political Practices Commission\n\nThe Political Reform Act was approved by the State of California voters in 1974 to establish rules and regulations for candidates and elected officials. The Political Reform Act has been amended several times since 1974 and is administered by the Fair Political Practices Commission. The Act requires a variety of forms to be filed before, during, and after a campaign.\n\nThe Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) was created out of the Political Reform Act. The FPPC educates the public and public officials on the requirements of the Act. It provides written and oral advice to public agencies and officials; conducts seminars and training sessions; develops forms, manuals, and instructions; and receives and files statements of economic interests from many state and local officials. The FPPC investigates alleged violations of the Political Reform Act, imposes penalties when appropriate, and assists state and local agencies in developing and enforcing conflict-of-interest codes.\n\nLearn More About the City\n\nLeadership Academy\n\nInterested resident candidates are encouraged to enroll in the City of Lake Forest Leadership Academy. This free, eight-week course held each fall is designed to enhance an understanding of the duties and responsibilities of local government. This is a beneficial and worthwhile opportunity for potential candidates who want to learn more about the daily operation of Lake Forest.\n\nCommunity Emergency Preparedness Academy\n\nCandidates may also be interested in enrolling in the Lake Forest Community Emergency Preparedness Academy (CEPA). CEPA is a free, eight-week course sponsored annually by the City of Lake Forest and the Orange County Sheriffâ€™s Department. The Academy has been designed to teach participants the basics of disaster preparedness. Classes typically start in January or February, but residents are added to the interest list throughout the year.\n\nCommissions\n\nVolunteering to serve on a City Commission or at City-sponsored events is another great way to get involved.
