        "text": "In 2021, the Court adopted an updated resolution on judicial ethics. This text, which applies to serving members of the Court as well as, where relevant, former and ad hoc judges, sets down a series of principles that judges should observe. It also deals with specific situations, such as additional activities and the acceptance of decorations and honours.\n\nBy articulating the principles that underlie the criteria for judicial office set forth in Article 21 of the European Convention on Human Rights and in the relevant provisions of the Rules of Court, the intention is to bring more transparency to the obligations inherent in judicial office, thereby enhancing public confidence in the Court.\n\nResolution on judicial ethics\n\nIn January 2024 the Court has published a new version of the Rules of Court, which incorporates some changes to Rule 28 on the recusal of judges. The latter were adopted by the plenary Court on 15 December 2023 and entered into force on 22 January 2024.\n\nRule 28 ensures the rigorous implementation of the principle of judicial impartiality, which is crucial for upholding the rule of law, protecting human rights, and ensuring the good administration of justice. The updated Rule reiterates the reasons for which a judge cannot sit in a particular case and strengthens the core procedural framework for the recusal of judges by expressly codifying the existing practice according to which the parties to the proceedings may request recusal of a judge.\n\nThe updated rule is accompanied by a Practice Direction issued by the President of the Court on 22 January 2024.\n\nRules of Court\n\nPractice direction on the recusal of judges\n\nPress release regarding the update of Rules on recusal of judges (22/01/2024)"
