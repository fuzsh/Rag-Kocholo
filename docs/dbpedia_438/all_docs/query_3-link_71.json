        "text": "The conversation, held as part of a WCC pastoral solidarity visit to the Holy Land, took place online and placed on the table not only the personal trauma of one family, but also a case emblematic of a broader issue, where individuals are held in detention without formal charges, often for extended periods, without due process – amounting to a direct violation of their human rights.\n\nThe WCC moderator and the general secretary both expressed commitment to advocate in calling for the immediate release of Layan Nasir as well as all other unjustly detained Palestinians.\n\nWCC moderator Bishop Dr Heinrich Bedford-Strohm said, “it was very touching to hear the story of Layan’s arrest and to feel the despair of her parents not even being told what the charges are. The situation of war can never be an excuse for arbitrarily detaining people without even revealing the charges. Layan Nasir needs to be released immediately.”\n\nWCC general secretary Rev. Prof. Dr Jerry Pillay added, “It is very alarming and concerning that the Israeli government could impose administrative detention on people and keep them in prison for extended periods without any charges or information to the families about the arrests of their loved ones. We spoke to the parents of Layan Nassir, and we heard their stories and saw their pain and suffering as they worry about their daughter who was detained since April 2024.”\n\n“The WCC will intervene in this situation on behalf of Layan and all other detainees under similar circumstances and rules. Human rights and human dignity must be preserved and taken seriously, and International human rights law must be respected, even by governments in whatever country. We continue to hope, pray and work for justice and peace,” Pillay said.\n\nAn in-depth interview with the family of Layan Nasir is planned for release in WCC News shortly.\n\nThe pastoral solidarity visit to the Holy Land takes place online on 7-8 August 2024. The delegation includes Bishop Dr Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, moderator of the World Council of Churches; Rev. Prof. Dr Jerry Pillay, general secretary of the WCC; Dr Audeh Quawas, member of the WCC central committee and executive committee; Dr Michel Abs, general secretary of the Middle East Council of Churches; Erik Lysén, moderator of ACT Alliance; Rudelmar Bueno de Faria, general secretary of ACT Alliance.\n\nFrom a Palestinian mother to the world: “Bring my daughter home”"
