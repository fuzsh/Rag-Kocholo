The euro is divided into 100 cents. There are coins in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 cents and 1 euro and 2 euros. There are notes of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 euros. €1 = $1.25475 (or $1 = €0.79697) as of 2005. The country issues its own coins in limited numbers as well.

Movable religious holidays include Easter Monday and Ascension.\n\nTIME: 1 pm = noon GMT.\n\nLOCATION, SIZE, AND EXTENT\n\nSan Marino is the third-smallest country in Europe. With an area of 60 sq km (23 sq mi), it extends 13.1 km (8.1 mi) ne–sw and 9.1 km (5.7 mi) se–nw. Comparatively, the area occupied by San Marino is about 0.3 times the size of Washington, DC. It is a landlocked state completely surrounded by Italy, with a total boundary length of 39 km (24 mi).\n\nTOPOGRAPHY\n\nThe town of San Marino is on the slopes and at the summit of Mt. Titano (755 m/2,477 ft), and much of the republic is coextensive with the mountain, which has major limestone pinnacles. Each of the peaks is crowned by old fortifications; on the north by a castle and the other two by towers. Level areas around the base of Mt. Titano provide land for agricultural use. The San Marino River begins in Italy and flows northward through the western portion of the country, forming part of the nation's western border. The Ausa River in the northwest and the Marano River of the east central region both drain into the Adriatic Sea.\n\nCLIMATE\n\nThe climate is that of northeastern Italy: rather mild in winter, but with temperatures frequently below freezing, and warm and pleasant in the summer, reaching a maximum of 26°c (79°f). Winter temperatures rarely fall below 7°c (19°f). Annual rainfall averages between 56 and 80 cm (22 to 32 in).\n\nFLORA AND FAUNA\n\nThe republic has generally the same flora and fauna as northeastern Italy. The hare, squirrel, badger, fox, and porcupine are among the more common animals seen. Most of the landscape has been cultivated with orchards, vineyards, and olive groves.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nUrbanization is the primary concern for the environment; however, the country has shown great care for environmental protection and preservation both within its own borders and in the global arena. Environmental protection is controlled by the Ministry of State for Territory, Environment, and Agriculture. San Marino has no endangered species; however, the lesser horseshoe bat and the common otter are listed as near threatened.\n\nPOPULATION\n\nThe population of San Marino in 2005 was estimated by the United Nations (UN) at 30,000, which placed it at number 189 in population among the 193 nations of the world. In 2005, approximately 16% of the population was over 65 years of age, with another 15% of the population under 15 years of age. According to the UN, the annual population rate of change for 2005–10 was expected to be 0.3%, a rate the government viewed as satisfactory. The projected population for the year 2025 was 30,000. The population density was 500 per sq km (1,295 per sq mi). San Marino is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.\n\nThe UN estimated that 84% of the population lived in urban areas in 2005, and that urban areas were growing at an annual rate of 0.89%. The capital city, San Marino, had a population of 5,000 in that year.\n\nMIGRATION\n\nImmigrants come chiefly from Italy; emigration is mainly to Italy, the United States, France, and Belgium. Foreigners who have been resident in San Marino for 30 years can become naturalized citizens.\n\nIn 1999, the net migration rate was 4.23 migrants per 1,000 population. In 2005, there was an increase to an estimated 10.84 migrants per 1,000 population. In 2000 the number of migrants living in San Marino was 9,000, approximately one-third of the total population. The government views the migration levels as satisfactory.\n\nETHNIC GROUPS\n\nThe native population is predominantly of Italian origin.\n\nLANGUAGES\n\nItalian is the official language.\n\nRELIGIONS\n\nIt has been estimated that over 95% of the population is Roman Catholic; however, while Roman Catholicism is dominant, it is not the state religion. The Catholic Church does receive direct benefits from the State, but so do other charities, including two religions—the Waldensian Church and Jehovah's Witnesses. There are small groups of Baha'is and Muslims. Certain Catholic holidays are recognized as national holidays.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nStreets and roads within the republic totaled about 220 km (140 mi) in 2002, and there is regular bus service between San Marino and Rimini. Motor vehicle registrations in 1995 included 22,945 passenger cars and 3,546 commercial vehicles. An electric railroad, 32 km (20 mi) long, between Rimini and San Marino was inaugurated in 1932. Damaged as a result of a British air raid on 26 June 1944, it has been out of service since that time. A 1.5-km (0.9-mi) cable-car service from the city of San Marino to Borgo Maggiore is operated by the government. There is helicopter service between San Marino and Rimini in summer.\n\nHISTORY\n\nSan Marino, the oldest republic in the world, is the sole survivor of the independent states that existed in Italy at various times from the downfall of the Western Roman Empire to the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. (The Vatican City State, which is also an independent enclave in Italy, was not constituted in its present form until the 20th century.)\n\nAccording to tradition, the republic was founded in ad 301 by Marinus, a Christian stonecutter who fled from Dalmatia to avoid religious persecution; later canonized, St. Marinus is known in Italian as San Marino. If founded at the time asserted by tradition, San Marino is the oldest existing national state in Europe. There was a monastery in San Marino in existence at least as early as 885.\n\nBecause of the poverty of the region and the difficult terrain, San Marino was rarely disturbed by outside powers, and it generally avoided the factional fights of the Middle Ages. For a time, it joined the Ghibellines and was therefore interdicted by Pope Innocent IV in 1247–49. It was protected by the Montefeltro family, later dukes of Urbino, and in 1441, with Urbino, it defeated Sigismondo Malatesta and extended the size of its territory. It was briefly held by Cesare Borgia in 1503, but in 1549 its sovereignty was confirmed by Pope Paul III. In 1739, however, a military force under a papal legate, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, occupied San Marino and unsuccessfully attempted to get the Sanmarinese to acknowledge his sovereignty over them. In the following year, Pope Clement II terminated the occupation and signed a treaty of friendship with the tiny republic. Napoleon allowed San Marino to retain its liberty; the Sanmarinese are said to have declined his offer to increase their territory on the grounds that smallness and poverty alone had kept them from falling prey to larger states.\n\nIn 1849, Giuseppe Garibaldi, the liberator of Italy, took refuge from the Austrians in San Marino; he departed voluntarily shortly before the Austrians were to invade the republic to capture him. San Marino and Italy entered into a treaty of friendship and customs union in 1862. This treaty was renewed in March 1939 and amended in September 1971.\n\nDuring the period of Mussolini's rule in Italy, San Marino adopted a Fascist type of government. Despite its claim to neutrality in World War II, Allied planes bombed it on 26 June 1944. The raid caused heavy damage, especially to the railway line, and killed a number of persons. San Marino's resources were sorely taxed to provide food and shelter for the over 100,000 refugees who obtained sanctuary during the war.\n\nThe elections of 1945 put a coalition of Communists and left-wing Socialists in control of the country. In 1957, some defections from the ruling coalition were followed by a bloodless revolution, aided by Italy, against the government. The leftists surrendered, and some were imprisoned. The rightists, chiefly Christian Democrats, won the election of 1959 and remained in power until 1973, chiefly in coalition with the Social Democrats. In March 1973, after splitting with the Social Democrats, the Christian Democrats formed an unstable coalition with the Socialists. After new elections in May 1978, the Communists, the Socialists, and the Socialist Unity Party, who together commanded a one-seat majority in the legislature, formed a governing coalition; San Marino thus became the only West European country with a Communist-led government. This coalition governed until 1986, when a Communist–Christian Democratic coalition replaced it; this was the first coalition government formed by these two parties in San Marino's history.\n\nAs of 2005, the ruling coalition was composed of the Sanmarinese Christian-Democratic Party and the Sanmarinese Socialist Party. In December 2003, Fabio Berardi was named secretary of state for foreign and political affairs, the equivalent of the office of a prime minister.\n\nSan Marino's high standard of living makes Sanmarinese citizenship a valuable commodity. With the only ways for foreigners to obtain citizenship being to reside in San Marino for 30 years or marry a male citizen, the government passed a law in August 1999 prohibiting female household servants under 50 because of the potential for elderly men to fall for their young female help who may have suspicious motives.\n\nAlso in 1999, San Marino joined the European Monetary Union and adopted the euro as its currency. The Europe-wide single currency was forecast to boost tourism but simultaneously hurt Sanmarinese bank revenues as the banks would no longer be able to charge fees for currency exchange. In June 2000, the OECD accused Sanmarinese banks of making the country a \"harmful\" tax haven; San Marino promised to reform its banking practices.\n\nBecause San Marino has a customs union with Italy, it enjoys all of the benefits that flow from European Union membership. However, San Marino's goal ultimately is to become a full-fledged member of the EU.\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nLegislative power is exercised by the Grand and General Council (Consiglio Grande e Generale) of 60 members, regularly elected every five years by universal suffrage at age 18. The Council elects from among its members a State Congress (Congresso di Stato) of 10 members (3 secretaries of state and 7 ministers of state), which makes most administrative decisions and carries them out. In 1960, universal male suffrage was established in place of the previous system, whereby only heads of families voted. Women also received the franchise effective in 1960 and were first permitted to run for office in 1974 (they voted in national elections for the first time in 1964). Nearly 100% of eligible voters participate in elections.\n\nTwo members of the Council are named every six months to head the executive branch of the government; one represents the town of San Marino and the other the countryside. The terms of these officials, called captains-regent (capitani reggenti ), begin on 1 April and 1 October. The captains-regent, who must be nativeborn citizens, are eligible for reelection after three years. As of September 2005, the captains-regent were Cesare Gasperoni (PDCS) and Fausta Simona Morganti (Party of Democrats—PD). The secretary of state for foreign and political affairs serves the function of a prime minister. Fabio Berardi was chosen to fill this office in December 2003. The next election for captains-regent was scheduled for March 2006 and for secretary of state for foreign and political affairs in June 2006.\n\nPOLITICAL PARTIES\n\nThe political parties in San Marino have close ties with the corresponding parties in Italy. Parties represented in the Grand and General Council following the 2001 elections were as follows: Christian Democratic Party (PDCS), 25; San Marino Socialist Party (PSS), 15; the Party of Democrats (PD), 12; Popular Alliance of Sanmarinese Democrats for the Republic (APDS), 5; Communist Refounding (RCS), 2; and the Sanmarinese National Alliance (ANS), 1. The next election was scheduled to be held by June 2006.\n\nLOCAL GOVERNMENT\n\nSan Marino consists of nine administrative divisions or castles (castelli ): Acquaviva, Borgo Maggiore, Chiesanuova, Domagnano, Faetano, Fiorentino, Monte Giardino, San Marino, and Serravalle. Each castle has an auxiliary council, elected for a four-year term. It is headed by an offcial called the captain of the castle, who is elected every two years.\n\nJUDICIAL SYSTEM\n\nThere is a civil court, a criminal court, and a superior court, but most criminal cases are tried before Italian magistrates because, with the exception of minor civil suits, the judges in Sanmarinese cases are not allowed to be citizens of San Marino. Appeals go, in the first instance, to an Italian judge residing in Italy. The highest appellate court is the Council of Twelve, chosen for six-year terms from members of the Grand and General Council. The rights of the accused, including the rights to a public trial, legal counsel and other procedural safeguards, are guaranteed by law and observed in practice.\n\nARMED FORCES\n\nThe San Marino militia nominally consists of all able-bodied citizens between the ages of 16 and 55, but the armed forces actually maintained are principally for purposes of ceremonial display; these include the noble guard used in various functions.\n\nINTERNATIONAL COOPERATION\n\nSan Marino became a member of the United Nations on 2 March 1992; it belongs to several nonregional specialized agencies, such as the FAO, the World Bank, ILO, UNCTAD, UNESCO, and the WHO.\n\nSan Marino is also a member of the OSCE and the Council of Europe. In environmental cooperation, the nation is part of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and the UN Conventions on Climate Change and Desertification.\n\nECONOMY\n\nFarming was formerly the principal occupation, but it has been replaced in importance by light manufacturing. However, the main sources of income are tourism, which accounted for more than 50% in 2001, and remittances from Sanmarinese living abroad. Some government revenue comes from the sale of postage stamps and coins and from Italy's subsidy to San Marino in exchange for which San Marino does not impose customs duties. The GDP growth has been impressive and consistent, averaging 7.68% from 1997 to 2001. Inflation, at 2% in 1997, increased to 3.3% in 2001, averaging 2.8% across the five-year period. Unemployment dropped steadily from 4.9% in 1997 to 2.6% in 2001. In purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, per capita income was at $34,600 in 2001.\n\nThe fact that San Marino is an enclave of Italy means that, apart from political links, it shares strong economic ties to the latter. The two countries form a customs union and share the same currency, although San Marino mints its own coins. Migrant workers from surrounding Italian regions boost the country's small labor force. The economic data available for San Marino is scattered and highly estimative.\n\nThus, in 2002 the GDP was $1.1 billion, and per capita income, in real terms, reached $29,000. The economy seems to be fairly dynamic as in 2004 the GDP growth rate was 2%. Natural resources include building stone and agricultural products (wheat, grapes, maize, olives, cattle, pigs, horses, meat, cheese, and hides).\n\nINCOME\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) reports that in 2005 San Marino's gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated at $940.0 million. The CIA defines GDP as the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year and computed on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP) rather than value as measured on the basis of the rate of exchange based on current dollars. The per capita GDP was estimated at $34,600. The annual growth rate of GDP was estimated at 7.5%. The average inflation rate in 2001 was 3.3%.\n\nLABOR\n\nIn the latest years for which data was available, the labor force in 1999 totaled about 18,500. In 2000, it was estimated that the services sector provided employment for 57% of the workforce, with industry accounting for 42% and agriculture 1%. The unemployment rate in 2001 stood at 2.6%.\n\nLabor federations include the Democratic Federation of Sanmarinese Workers, affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the General Federation of Labor. About 50% of the workforce is unionized. The minimum working age is 16 without any exceptions. In 2001, the minimum wage was $1,200 per month although most wages are higher than the minimum.\n\nAGRICULTURE\n\nAbout 17% of the land is arable. Annual crop production includes wheat and grapes, as well as other grains, vegetables, fruits, and fodder.\n\nANIMAL HUSBANDRY\n\nLivestock raising uses some 1,400 hectares (3,500 acres), or about 23% of the total area. Cattle, hogs, sheep, and horses are raised.\n\nFISHING\n\nThere is no fishing.\n\nFORESTRY\n\nSmall quantities of wood are cut for local use.\n\nMINING\n\nSan Marino had no commercial mineral resources.\n\nENERGY AND POWER\n\nElectric power is imported from Italy.\n\nINDUSTRY\n\nManufacturing is limited to light industries such as textiles, bricks and tiles, leather goods, clothing, and metalwork. Cotton textiles are woven at Serravalle; bricks and tiles are made in La Dogana, which also has a dyeing plant; and cement factories and a tannery are located in Acquaviva, as well as a paper-making plant. Synthetic rubber is also produced. The pottery of Borgo Maggiore is well known. Gold and silver souvenirs are made for the tourist trade. Other products are Moscato wine, olive oil, and baked goods. A significant source of revenue is the selling of stamps to foreign collectors.\n\nSCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\n\nSanmarinese students generally pursue their scientific and technical training abroad, since science and technology resources are domestically limited. The Universita Degli Studi, founded in 1987, has a department of technology. The Institute of Cybernetics, founded in 1965, offers courses in computer science.\n\nDOMESTIC TRADE\n\nThere are small general stores in the capital and the smaller towns. Billboards and newspapers are the main advertising medium. A weekly market is held at Borgo Maggiore, which also sponsors an annual fair for the sale of cattle and sheep. Most retail trade within the country is focused on goods and services that support the tourism industry.\n\nFOREIGN TRADE\n\nRecords of foreign trade are not published, but it is known that imports exceed exports. Principal exports are wine, textiles, furniture, quarried stone, ceramics, and handicrafts. The chief imports are raw materials and a wide variety of consumer goods. San Marino has a customs union with Italy. In 1999, San Marino joined the European Monetary Union (EMU), further strengthening its ties to the EU.\n\nEstimates of the US State Department show that in 2001, exports totaled around $2.0 billion, while imports amounted to $2.1 billion. More than 85% of the exports went to Italy, and included mainly manufactured goods, lime, wood, and food. Most of the imports came also from Italy and included consumer manufactures, food, and raw materials (including energy). San Marino also does trade with countries in Western and Eastern Europe, with South America, China, and Taiwan.\n\nBALANCE OF PAYMENTS\n\nSince imports and exports are not subject to customs duties, no record is kept of foreign payments transactions. Receipts from tourism, remittances from Sanmarinese working abroad, and sales of postage stamps to foreign collectors are principal sources of foreign exchange.\n\nBANKING AND SECURITIES\n\nThe principal bank, the Cassa di Risparmio, was founded in 1882. Other banks include the Banca Agricola and the Cassa Rurale. There are no securities transactions in San Marino. In 1999 San Marino joined the European Monetary Union (EMU) and adopted the euro.\n\nINSURANCE\n\nSeveral major Italian insurance companies have agencies in San Marino.\n\nPUBLIC FINANCE\n\nThe government derives its revenues mainly from the worldwide sale of postage stamps, direct and indirect taxes, and yearly subsidies\n\nRevenue and Grants438,922100.0% Tax revenue219,89450.1% Social contributions94,35821.5% Grants4,6481.1% Other revenue120,02127.3%Expenditures426,864100.0% General public services61,97514.5% Defense…… Public order and safety12,5692.9% Economic affairs61,11814.3% Environmental protection13,8093.2% Housing and community amenities10,0082.3% Health77,42418.1% Recreational, culture, and religion9,8162.3% Education40,1439.4% Social protection140,00332.8%(…) data not available or not significant.\n\nby the Italian government. State budgets have increased sharply in recent years.\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) estimated that in 2000 San Marino's central government took in revenues of approximately $400 million and had expenditures of $400 million.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that in 2002, the most recent year for which it had data, central government revenues were €438,922 and expenditures were €426,864. The value of revenues was us$413,064 and expenditures us$388,722, based on a market exchange rate for 2002 of us$1 = €1.0626 as reported by the IMF. Government outlays by function were as follows: general public services, 14.5%; public order and safety, 2.9%; economic affairs, 14.3%; environmental protection, 3.2%; housing and community amenities, 2.3%; health, 18.1%; recreation, culture, and religion, 2.3%; education, 9.4%; and social protection, 32.8%.\n\nTAXATION\n\nLegislation introducing San Marino's first income tax was passed by the Grand and General Council in October 1984. A general income tax is applied progressively to individuals (12–50% in 1992) and a flat rate of 24% to corporations. Also levied are a stamp duty, registration tax, mortgage tax, and succession duty.\n\nCUSTOMS AND DUTIES\n\nSan Marino's trade policy is governed by its customs union with Italy. There is a one-phase duty system on imported goods, which closely follows the rates of the Italian value-added tax (VAT) system. In 1992, there was a 14% tax on imports. In 1999 San Marino joined the European Monetary Union.\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT\n\nInformation on foreign investment is not available.\n\nECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\n\nIn addition to promoting tourism in San Marino, the government has encouraged the establishment of small-scale industries and service-oriented enterprises (40–60 employees) by offering tax exemptions for 5–10 years.\n\nThe tourist industry is the main source of revenue for the country (about 50% of total revenues), so economic development strategies are coiled around this sector. More than 3 million tourists visit the small republic every year, and they constitute the primary market for all of San Marino's other industries. Stamps are one of the country's main export goods.\n\nSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nA social insurance system provides pensions for old age and disability. Employers, employees, and the government all contribute to the system. Self-employed contributions vary. There is universal medical coverage and maternity benefits of 100% of earnings for five months. All employees and self-employed persons have work injury insurance. Unemployment is only available to salaried employees and excludes civil servants.\n\nThe law mandates that women have equal access to employment opportunities, and in practice women face little or no discrimination in employment and in pay. Women actively participate in all careers including high public office. Laws protect women from violence, and instances of spousal abuse are infrequent.\n\nThe government is committed to protecting human rights. Prisons meet international standards and are open for inspection by human rights monitors.\n\nHEALTH\n\nPublic health institutions include the State Hospital (opened in 1975), a dispensary for the poor, and a laboratory of hygiene and prophylaxis. All citizens receive free, comprehensive medical care. As of 2004, there were an estimated 251 physicians, 506 nurses, 26 midwives, 41 dentists, and 52 pharmacists per 100,000 people.\n\nAs of 2002, the crude birth rate and overall mortality rate were estimated at, respectively, 10.6 and 7.8 per 1,000 people. In 2005, the estimated average life expectancy was 81.62 years and infant mortality was estimated at 5.73 per 1,000 live births. The estimated maternal mortality was 5 per 100,000 live births.\n\nThe immunization rates for children under one year old in San Marino were as follows: diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, 93%; polio, 100%; measles, 96%; and hepatitis B, 98%.\n\nHOUSING\n\nSan Marino has over 7,000 dwellings, virtually all with electricity and piped-in water. Most new construction is financed privately. The housing stock for the nation is generally adequate to supply the population. Government concerns are primarily focused on preventing over-construction of rural areas.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nPrimary education is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 16; the adult literacy rate is about 98%. The program of instruction is patterned after the Italian curriculum, and San Marinese school certificates are recognized by Italy. Children go through five years of primary education followed by three years of secondary education at the first stage and a further three years of senior secondary school. At the secondary level, students may choose to attend technical or vocational programs instead of general (classical) studies. The academic year runs from October to July.\n\nIn 2000, there were about 1,000 students enrolled in primary school and 1,000 enrolled in secondary school. Nearly all students complete their primary education.\n\nThe University of San Marino is the primary institution of higher education. The adult literacy rate has been estimated at about 96%.\n\nLIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS\n\nIn the capital city is the Biblioteca di Stato, containing a library of some 110,000 books, documents, and pamphlets. The Palazzo del Valloni also houses the state archives, as well as a collection of rare coins and medals. The State University has a small collection of 23,000 volumes.\n\nThe Palazzo del Governo (built in 1894) and most other large buildings in the capital are of comparatively recent date, but many monuments have been rebuilt in an earlier style. In 2001, there were 10 museums in the country. One of them is devoted to the postage stamps of San Marino and other countries. The National Gallery of Modern Art is also in San Marino. The 14th-century church of San Francesco has paintings by several minor masters. The three old fortresses of Guaita, Fratta, and Montale are situated on the three pinnacles of Mt. Titano. There is also a museum in Borgia Maggiore devoted to objects connected with Garibaldi's stay in the republic.\n\nMEDIA\n\nAn automatic telephone system, integrated into Italy's system, served 20,600 mainline telephones in 2002. The same year, there were an additional 16,800 mobile cellular phones in use throughout the country. In 1998, there were 3 FM radio stations and one television station receiving mostly foreign broadcasts. San Marino RTV was the state-owned national TV and radio broadcaster. There were 595 radios and 357 television sets per 1,000 population in 1997. In 2002, there were 14,300 Internet users in the country. In 2004, there were 1,763 Internet hosts.\n\nIn 2002, there were five major daily newspapers: Il Nuovo Titano (circulation 1,300), Riscossa Socialista, Notiziario, San Marino, and La Scintilia. There are also a number of government bulletins. The law provides for freedom of speech and of the press and the government generally respects these rights in practice.\n\nORGANIZATIONS\n\nBusiness and labor organizations include the National Association for Industry of San Marino, National Small Enterprise Association of San Marino, Autonomous Workers Association of San Marino, Labour Confederation of San Marino, and the Democratic Workers Confederation of San Marino.\n\nNational youth organizations include the Young Christian Democrats and The Catholic Guide and Scout Association of San Marino. There are sports associations representing athletes in a variety of pastimes, such as weightlifting, tennis, football (soccer), and track and field. Many sports clubs are affiliated with the national Olympic Committee and other international organizations.\n\nVolunteer service organizations, such as the Lions Clubs and Kiwanis International, are also present. The Red Cross and UNICEF have national chapters.\n\nTOURISM, TRAVEL, AND RECREATION\n\nThe government has promoted tourism so successfully that in the summer during the 1980s the number of San Marino residents was often exceeded by the number of visitors (20,000–30,000 daily). Growth in the tourist industry has increased the demand for San Marino's stamps and coins, gold and silver souvenirs, handicrafts, and pottery.\n\nPrincipal attractions are the three medieval fortresses at the summit of Mt. Titano and the magnificent view from there of Rimini and the Adriatic Sea. The State Tourism, Sports, and Entertainment Board maintains various recreational facilities.\n\nThere were 683 hotel rooms in 2003, with 1,549 beds. The average length of stay was 1.5 nights that year.\n\nIn 2005, the US Department of State estimated the daily cost of travel in San Marino at $227.\n\nFAMOUS SANMARINESE\n\nGiambattista Belluzzi, a 16th-century military engineer in the service of Florence, was born in San Marino. Well-known Italians who were associated with San Marino include Cardinal Giulio Alberoni (1664–1752), who attempted to subject the republic to papal domination in 1739–40; Count Alessandro Cagliostro (Giuseppe Balsamo, 1743–95), a Sicilian adventurer, imposter, and alchemist; Bartolommeo Borghesi (1781–1860), an antiquarian, epigrapher, and numismatist, who resided in San Marino from 1821 to 1860; and Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807–82), the great Italian patriot, who obtained refuge from the Austrians in San Marino in 1849.\n\nDEPENDENCIES\n\nSan Marino has no territories or colonies.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nCatling, Christopher.

Crop farming, sheep farming, and the working of stone from the quarries formed the early backbone of San Marino's economy. It has no mineral resources, and today most of the land is cultivated or covered by woods.\n\nAccording to tradition, San Marino was founded in AD 301 when a Christian stonemason named Marinus the Dalmatian fled to the island of Arbe to escape the anti-Christian Roman Emperor Diocletian. Marinus hid on the peak of Mount Titano and founded a small community of people following their Christian beliefs. It is certain that the area had been inhabited since prehistoric times, although evidence of existence on Mount Titano only dates back to the Middle Ages. In memory of the stonecutter, the land was renamed “Land of San Marino” and was finally changed to its present-day name, “Republic of San Marino.”\n\nThe original government structure was composed of a self-governed assembly known as the Arengo, which consisted of the heads of each family. In 1243, the positions of Captains Regent (Capitani Reggenti) were established to be the joint heads of state.\n\nThe land area of San Marino consisted only of Mount Titano until 1463, at which time the republic entered into an alliance against Sigis-mondo Pandolfo Malatesta, Lord of Rimini, who was later defeated. As a result, Pope Pius II Piccolomini gave San Marino the towns of Fiorentino, Montegiardino, and Serravalle. Later that year, the town of Faetano joined the republic on its own accord. Since then, the size of San Marino has remained unchanged.\n\nSan Marino has been occupied by foreign militaries twice in its history, both for only short periods of time. In 1503, Cesare Borgia, known as Valentino, occupied the republic until his death several months later. In 1739, Cardinal Alberoni used military force to occupy the country. Civil disobedience was used to protest his occupation, and clandestine notes sent to the Pope to obtain justice were answered by the Pope's recognition of San Marino's rights and restoration of San Marino's independence.\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nThe Arengo, initially formed with the heads of each family, relinquished its power to the Great and General Council. In 1243, the first two Captains Regent were nominated by the Council, and this method of nomination is still in use today. The Council is composed of 60 members who are elected every 5 years under a proportional representation system in all nine administrative districts. These districts (Townships) correspond to the old parishes of the Republic, and each one is ruled by a Council, which is chaired by a Captain elected every 5 years. The Great and General Council approves the budget, as well as the nominations of Captains Regent and heads of the Executive.\n\nEvery 6 months, the Council elects two Captains Regent to be the heads of state. The Regents are chosen from opposing parties so they can keep an eye on each other. They serve a 6-month term. The investiture of the Captains Regent takes place on April 1 and October 1 in every year. Once this term is over citizens have 3 days in which to file complaints about the previous Regents' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the former head(s) of state can be initiated.\n\nThe State Congress, composed of 10 Secretaries, wields executive power. The 10 Secretaries are (1) Secretary of State for Foreign and Political Affairs, and Economic Planning; (2) Secretary of State for Internal Affairs and Civil Defense; (3) Secretary of State for Finance, Budget, and Relations with the State Philatelic and Numismatic Office; (4) Secretary of State for Education, Culture, University and Social Affairs; (5) Secretary of State for Territory, Environment and Agriculture; (6) Secretary of State for Health and Social Security; (7) Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Relations with the Azienda Autonoma di Stato for Services; (8) Secretary of State for Communication, Transport, Tourism, and Sport; (9) Secretary of State for Justice, Information, and Peace; and (10) Secretary of State for Labor and Cooperation.\n\nThe Great and General Council elects the Council of Twelve for the duration of the Legislature and serves a jurisdictional body that also acts as a third instance Court of Appeals. Two government inspectors represent the State in financial and patrimonial questions.\n\nThe Legislative body consists of the Great and General Council, the parliament, and a unicameral Chamber. The members of parliament are usually elected every five years and are in charge of legislation, justice, and the administration of jurisdiction. In addition, they are tasked with electing the Captains Regent, the State Congress, the Council of Twelve, the Advising Commission, and the Government Unions once the Council nominates them. Parliament also has the power to ratify contracts with other countries. The parliament is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of 15 councils which examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on being submitted to the Great and General Council.\n\nThe judiciary is composed of the commissioner of the law, the judging magistrate, the appellate judge, the juvenile court, and the judge of last appeal. The commissioner tries civil and penal cases with penalties not exceeding a three-year sentence. The judging magistrates, who are appointed by parliament for a three-year term and can be indefinitely reappointed, preside over all other cases.\n\nReform legislation, enacted in 2004, no longer requires that the country's lower court judges be noncitizens; however, most lower court judges remained Italian citizens. A local conciliation judge handles cases of minor importance. Under the same reform, the final court of review is the judge of the last appeal. In civil matters, this judge confirms or overrules either the lower court judgment or an appellate decision; in criminal matters, he judges on the legitimacy of detention measures and on the enforcement of a judgment.\n\nOn April 28, 2005 a new act established the country's constitutional court with the following functions: 1) to verify that laws, acts, and traditions that are given the force of law conform to constitutional precepts; 2) to verify the admissibility of a referendum; 3) to decide on conflicts between constitutional institutions; 4) to control the activity of the Captains Regent. The court is composed of three standing judges and three alternate judges. They are selected by the Great and General Council with a two-thirds majority to a four-year term. After the first selection one-third of the members of the court are reselected every two years.\n\nPrincipal Government Officials\n\nLast Updated: 2/1/2008\n\nCaptain Regent (Co-Head of State): Alessandro MANCINI\n\nCaptain Regent (Co-Head of State): Alessandro ROSS\n\nSec. of Budget & Finance: Stefano MACINA\n\nSec. of Health & Social Security: Fabio BERARDI\n\nSec. of Industry, Trade, & Research: Tito MASI\n\nSec. of Interior & Civil Protection: Valeria CIAVATTA\n\nSec. of Justice, Information, & Peace: Ivan FOSCHI\n\nSec. of Labor: Antonello BACCIOCCHI\n\nSec. of Public Education, Culture, & Social Affairs: Francesca MICHELOTTI\n\nSec. of State for Foreign & Political Affairs & for Economic Planning: Fiorenzo STOLFI\n\nSec. of Territory, Environment, & Agriculture: Marino RICCARDI\n\nSec. of Tourism, Telecommunications, Transportation, Economic Cooperation, & Sports: Paride ANDREOLI\n\nPermanent Representative to the UN, New York: Daniele BODINI\n\nSan Marino has honorary Consulates General in Washington, DC and New York and honorary Consulates in Detroit and Honolulu. The honorary Consulate General in Washington, DC is located at 1899 L Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20036.\n\nThe Republic of San Marino's Web Site provides information on politics, trade, and events in San Marino.\n\nPOLITICAL CONDITIONS\n\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. The two main parties are the Democratic Christian Party of San Marino (PDCS), and the Party of Socialists and Democrats (PSD), in addition to several other smaller parties. Due to the small size and low population of San Marino, it is difficult for any party to gain a pure majority, and most of the time the government is run by a coalition. Following the June 2006 election results, the PSD formed a center-left coalition government with the Popular Alliance and the United Left parties.\n\nBecause tourism accounts for more than 50% of the economic sector, the government relies not only on taxes and customs for revenue but also the sale of coins and postage stamps to collectors throughout the world. In addition, the Italian Government pays San Marino an annual budget subsidy provided under the terms of the Basic Treaty with Italy. In recent years banking has also become an important economic activity. Harmonization of statutes and policies with the EU is a major domestic and foreign policy priority of the republic. Another priority issue is the signing of a cooperation agreement with Italy, San Marino's most important economic partner.\n\nECONOMY\n\nSan Marino's per capita income in 2005 stood at 28,570 Euros (approx. $41,400) with more than 50% coming from the tourism industry, which draws about 2 million people annually. Traditional economic activities in San Marino were food crops, sheep farming, and stone quarrying. Today farming activities focus on grain, vines, and orchards, as well as animal husbandry (cattle and swine). Besides the tourism industry, San Marino makes most of its income from the banking industry and from the manufacture and export of ceramics, tiles, furniture, clothing, paints, fabrics, and spirits/wines. The percapita level of output and standard of living in San Marino are comparable to those of Italy. In addition, San Marino maintains the lowest unemployment rate in Europe and no national debt.\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\n\nSan Marino is an active player in the international community. Currently, the Republic has diplomatic relations with over 70 countries. Italy is the only country represented by an ambassador resident in San Marino. The Papal Nuncio, based in Rome, is the dean of San Marino's diplomatic corps.\n\nSan Marino is a full member of the United Nations (UN), International Court of Justice (ICJ), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Health Organization (WHO), World Tourism Organization (WTO), Council of Europe, International Red Cross Organization, the International Institution for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIIT), and Interpol, among others. It also cooperates with UNICEF and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and has official relations with the European Union (EU). From May-November 1990 and from November 2006-May 2007, San Marino held the semi-annual presidency of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, headquartered in Strasbourg, France.\n\nU.S.-SAN MARINO RELATIONS\n\nThe United States and San Marino enjoy friendly diplomatic relations. San Marino consistently supports U.S. foreign policy positions, as well as U.S. candidates to international organizations. The two countries are on excellent terms. In September 2006 President George W. Bush appointed Ambassador to Italy Ronald P. Spogli to serve concurrently as Ambassador to San Marino. Ambassador Spogli is the first U.S. Ambassador to San Marino in the country' history. In July 2007, Ambassador Paolo Rondelli became San Marino's first ambassador to the U.S. For consular purposes, the republic is within the jurisdiction of the Florence consular district. Consulate officials regularly visit San Marino to carry out diplomatic demarches, represent U.S. interests, and administer consular services.\n\nPrincipal U.S. Embassy Officials\n\nLast Updated: 2/19/2008\n\nFLORENCE (CG) Lungarno A.

Ma\n\nTRAVEL\n\nConsular Information Sheet—Italy\n\nOctober 11, 2007\n\nCountry Description: Italy is a developed democracy with a modern economy. The Holy See is a sovereign entity that serves as the ecclesiastical, governmental and administrative capital of the Roman Catholic Church, physically located within the State of the Vatican City inside Rome, with a unique, non-traditional economy. San Marino is a developed, constitutional democratic republic, also independent of Italy, with a modern economy. Tourist facilities are widely available.\n\nEntry Requirements: A valid passport is required. Italian authorities may deny entry to travelers who attempt to enter without a valid passport. A visa is not required for tourist stays up to three months. However, for all other purposes, such as work, study, etc., a visa is required and must be obtained from the Italian Embassy or Consulates before entering Italy. For further information concerning visas and entry requirements for Italy, travelers may contact the Embassy of Italy at 3000 Whitehaven St NW, Washington, DC 20008, via telephone at (202) 612-4400 or via the Internet: http://www.ambwashingtondc.esteri.it/ambasciata_washington, or Italian Consulates General in Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Newark, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, or San Francisco, accessible through the above Internet site\n\nAmericans staying or traveling within Italy for less than three (3) months are considered non-residents. This includes persons on vacation, those taking professional trips, students registered at an authorized school, or persons performing research or independent study.\n\nAs of May 28, 2007, under Italian law (http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/070681.htm), all non-residents are required to complete a dichiarazione di presenza (declaration of presence). Tourists arriving from a non-Schengen-country (e.g. the United States) should obtain a stamp in their passport at the airport on the day of arrival. This stamp is considered the equivalent of the declaration of presence. Tourists arriving from a Schengen-country (e.g. France) must request the declaration of presence form from a local police office (commissariato di zona), police headquarters (questura) or their place of stay (e.g hotel, hostel, campgrounds) and submit the form to the police or to their place of stay within eight business days of arrival. It is important that applicants keep a copy of the receipt issued by the Italian authorities. Failure to complete a declaration of presence is punishable by expulsion from Italy. Additional information may be obtained (in Italian only) via Internet from the following websites: www.portaleimmigrazione.it and http://www.poliziadistato.it/pds/imigrazione/soggiorno.htm. Americans staying in Italy for more than three (3) months are considered residents and must obtain a 14,000 national post offices (Poste Italiane). The kit must then be returned to one of 5,332 designated Post Office acceptance locations. It is important that applicants keep a copy of the receipt issued by the Post Office. Additional information may be obtained from an Italian immigration website via Internet at: http://www.portaleimmigrazione.it. Within 20 days of receiving the permit to stay in Italy, Americans must go to the local Vital Statistics Bureau (Anagrafe of the Comune) to apply for residency. It generally takes one to two months to receive the certificate of residence (Certificato di Residenza).\n\nSafety and Security: There have been occasional episodes of politically motivated violence in Italy, most often connected to Italian internal developments or social issues. At various times, Italian authorities have found bombs outside public buildings, have received bomb threats and were subjects of letter bombs. Firebombs or Molotov cocktails have been thrown at buildings or offices in the middle of the night. These incidents have all been attributed to organized crime or anarchist movements. Americans were not targeted or injured in these instances.\n\nDemonstrations may have an anti-American character. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful have the potential to turn into confrontational situations and possibly escalate into violence. U.S. citizens traveling or residing in Italy should take common sense precautions and follow news reports carefully in order to avoid demonstrations and to be aware of heightened security and potential delays when they occur.\n\nItaly remains largely free of terrorist incidents. However, like other countries in the Schengen area, Italy's open borders with its Western European neighbors allow the possibility of terrorist groups entering/exiting the country with anonymity.\n\nFor the latest security information, Americans traveling abroad should regularly monitor the Department of State Burea of Consular Affair's Internet site at http://travel.state.gov, where the current Worldwide Caution Travel Alert, Travel Warnings and Travel Alerts can be found. Up-to-date information on safety and security can also be obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll free in the U.S., or for callers outside the U.S. and Canada, a regular toll-line at 1- 202-501-4444.\n\nCrime: Italy has a moderate rate of violent crime, some of which is directed towards tourists, principally for motives of theft. Some travelers have been victims of rape and beatings. There have also been incidents of drinks laced with drugs being used by criminals to rob, and in some cases, assault tourists. Many of these incidents have occurred in the vicinity of Rome's Termini train station and at major tourist centers such as Campo de Fiori and Piazza Navona, as well as in Florence and Naples. Criminals using this tactic “befriend” a traveler at a train station, bus stop, restaurant, café or bar in tourist areas, then eventually offer a drink laced with a sleeping drug. When the tourist falls asleep, criminals steal the traveler's valuables. There have also been instances where the victim was assaulted, either physically or sexually.\n\nAmericans are urged to exercise caution at train stations and airports, and when frequenting nightclubs, bars and outdoor cafes, particularly at night, because criminals may make initial contact with potential victims in such settings. Individuals under the effect of alcohol may become victims of crime, including robbery, physical and sexual assault, due to their impaired ability to judge situations and make decisions. This is particularly a problem for younger Americans visiting Italy, where the age limit on the sale of alcoholic beverages is lower than in most U.S. states. If you are a victim of such a crime, please file a police report and contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest Consulate. There are also in-country organizations, which provide counseling, medical, and legal assistance to certain crime victims.\n\nPetty crimes such as pick pocketing, theft from parked cars, and purse snatching are serious problems, especially in large cities. Pickpockets sometimes dress like businessmen so tourists should not be lulled into a false sense of security by believing that well-dressed individuals are not potential pickpockets or thieves. Most reported thefts occur at crowded tourist sites, on public buses or trains, or at the major railway stations: Rome's Termini; Milan's Centrale; Florence's Santa Maria Novella; and Naples' Centrale and Piazza Garibaldi. Travelers should also be alert to theft in Milan's Malpensa Airport, particularly at car rental agencies. Clients of Internet cafes in major cities have been targeted. Tourists who have tried to resist petty thieves on motor scooters have suffered broken arms and collarbones.\n\nThieves in Italy often work in groups or pairs. Pairs of accomplices or groups of street urchins are known to divert tourists' attention so that another can pickpocket them. In one particular routine, one thief throws trash, waste or ketchup at the victim; a second thief assists the victim in cleaning up the mess; and the third discreetly takes the victim's belongings. Criminals on crowded public transportation slit the bottoms of purses or bags with a razor blade or sharp knife, then remove the contents. Theft of small items such as radios, luggage, cameras, briefcases, and even cigarettes from parked cars is a major problem.\n\nCarjackings and thefts have also been reported from occupied vehicles waiting in traffic or stopped at traffic lights. Vehicles parked near beaches during the summer have been broken into and items stolen. Robbers take items from cars at gas stations often by smashing car windows.\n\nIn a scam practiced on the highways, one thief signals a flat tire to the driver of another car and encourages the driver to pull over. Often, the tire has been punctured by an accomplice, while in other instances, there may, in fact, be nothing wrong with the vehicle. When the driver stops, one thief helps change the tire, while the other takes the driver's belongings. Use particular caution driving at night on highways, when there may be a greater incidence of robbery attempts. There have been occasional reports of break-ins of rental cars driven by Americans when the precautions mentioned above were not followed during stops at highway service areas.\n\nOn trains, a commonly reported trick involves one or more persons who pretend to befriend a traveler and offer drugged food or drink. Also, thieves have been known to impersonate police officers to gain the confidence of tourists. The thief shows the prospective victim a circular plastic sign with the words “police” or “international police.” If this happens, the tourist should insist on seeing the officer's identification card (documento), as impersonators tend not to carry forged documents. Tourists should immediately report thefts or other crimes to the local police.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service in Rome has been advised of, and is assisting Italian Law Enforcement authorities in investigating, an increase in the appearance of ATM skimming devices. These devices are attached to legitimate bank ATMs, usually located in tourist areas, and capture the account information stored electronically on the card's magnetic strip. The devices consist of a card reader installed over the legitimate reader and a pin-hole video camera mounted above the keypad that records the customer's PIN. ATMs with skimming devices installed may also allow normal transactions to occur. The victim's information is sold, traded on-line or encoded on another card such as a hotel key card to access the compromised account. Here are some helpful hints to protect yourself and to identify skimming devices:\n\nUse ATMs located in well-lit public areas, or secured inside the bank/business\n\nCover the keypad with one hand as you enter your PIN\n\nLook for gaps, tampered appearance, or other irregularities between the metal faceplate of the ATM and the card reader\n\nAvoid card readers that are not flush with the face of the ATM\n\nMonitor your account statements for unauthorized transactions\n\nOrganized criminal groups operate throughout Italy, but are more prevalent in the south. They have occasionally resorted to violence to intimidate or to settle disputes. Though the activities of such groups are not generally targeted at tourists, visitors should be aware that innocent bystanders could be injured.\n\nIn many countries around the world, counterfeit and pirated goods are widely available. Transactions involving such products may be illegal under local law. In addition, bringing them back to the United States may result in forfeitures and/ or fines. More information on this serious problem is available at http://www.cybercrime.gov/18usc2320.htm.\n\nAccording to Italian Law (Law 80 of May 14, 2005), anyone caught buying counterfeit goods (for example, DVDs, CDs, watches, purses, bags, belts, sunglasses, etc.) is subject to a fine of no less than EUR 1,000. Police in major Italian cities enforce this law to varying degrees. Travelers are advised to purchase products only from stores and other licensed retailers to avoid unknowingly buying counterfeit and illegal merchandise.\n\nInformation for Victims of Crime: The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported immediately to the local police and the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. If you are the victim of a crime while overseas, in addition to reporting to local police, please contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate for assistance. The Embassy/Consulate staff can, for example, assist you to find appropriate medical care, contact family members or friends and explain how funds could be transferred. Lost or stolen credit cards present risk of identity theft and should be cancelled immediately. Although the investigation and prosecution of the crime is solely the responsibility of local authorities, consular officers can help you to understand the local criminal justice process and to find an attorney if needed.\n\nMedical Facilities and Health Information: Medical facilities are available, but may be limited outside urban areas. Public hospitals, though generally free of charge for emergency services, sometimes do not maintain the same standards as hospitals in the United States, so travelers are encouraged to obtain insurance that would cover a stay in a private Italian hospital or clinic. It is almost impossible to obtain an itemized hospital bill from public hospitals, as required by many U.S. insurance companies, because the Italian National Health Service charges one inclusive rate (care services, bed and board).\n\nInformation on vaccinations and other health precautions, such as safe food and water precautions and insect bite protection, may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's hotline for international travelers at 1-877-FYI-TRIP (1-877-394-8747) or via the CDC's web site at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel. For information about outbreaks of infectious diseases abroad, consult the World Health Organization's web site at http://www.who.int/en. Further health information for travelers is available at http://www.who.int/ith\n\nMedical Insurance: The Department of State strongly urges Americans to consult with their medical insurance company prior to traveling abroad to confirm whether their policy applies overseas and whether it will cover emergency expenses such as a medical evacuation.\n\nTraffic Safety and Road Conditions: While in a foreign country, U.S. citizens may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. The information below concerning Italy is provided for general reference only, and may not be totally accurate in a particular location or circumstance.\n\nStreets in historic city centers are often narrow, winding and congested. Motor scooters are very popular and drivers often see themselves as exempt from conventions that apply to automobiles. Travelers who rent scooters should be particularly cautious. Pedestrians and drivers should be constantly alert to the possibility of scooters' sudden presence. Throughout Italy, pedestrian deaths are increasing, with a total of 1,188 deaths in 2002, the last year for which statistics are currently available. There were also more than 17,000 pedestrian injuries in 2002. Most of these deaths and injuries involve pedestrians or cyclists who are involved in collisions with scooters or other vehicles. U.S. citizens should remain vigilant and alert while walking or cycling near traffic. Pedestrians should be careful, as sidewalks, especially in major cities, can be extremely congested and uneven, and drivers of bicycles, motorcycles and other vehicles routinely ignore traffic signals and traffic flows, routinely park and even drive on sidewalks. For safety, pedestrians should look carefully in both directions before crossing streets, even when using a marked crosswalk with a green “avanti” (“walk”) light illuminated.\n\nTraffic lights are limited, often disobeyed, and a different convention of right-of-way is observed. Italy has over 5,600 kilometers (3,480 mi.) of “Autostrada,” or superhighways. Commercial and individual vehicles travel and pass on these well-maintained roads at very high speeds. Accidents occur in which contributing factors include excessive speed, alcohol/drug use and/or sleepiness of long-distance drivers. Italy has one of the highest rates of car accident deaths in the European Union.\n\nIn rural areas, a wide range of speed on highways makes for hazardous driving. Roads are generally narrow and often have no guardrails. Travelers in northern Italy, especially in winter, should be aware of fog and poor visibility, responsible for multiple-car accidents each year. Most Italian automobiles are equipped with special fog lights. Roadside assistance in Italy is excellent on the well-maintained toll roads, but limited on secondary roads. Use of safety belts and child restraining devices is mandatory and headlights should be on at all times outside of urban areas.\n\nFor specific information concerning Italian driving permits, vehicle inspection, road tax and mandatory insurance, contact the Italian Government Tourist Board (ENIT) offices via the Internet at http://www.enit.it, tel: 212-245-4822 or the A.C.I. (Automobile Club Italiano) at Via Magenta 5, 00185 Rome, tel: 39-06-4477. For information on obtaining international drivers licenses, contact AAA or the American Automobile Touring Alliance.\n\nVisit the website of the country's national tourist office online at www.italiantourism.com and national authority responsible for road safety at www.infrastrutture-trasporti.it.\n\nAviation Safety Oversight: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Italy's Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Italy's air carrier operations. For more information, travelers may visit the FAA's web site at http://www.faa.gov.\n\nSpecial Circumstances: Strikes and other work stoppages occur frequently in the transportation sector (national airlines, airports, trains, and bus lines). Most are announced in advance and are of short duration. Information on strikes may be found at www.infrastrutturetrasporti.it. Reconfirmation of domestic and international flight reservations is highly recommended.\n\nIn Naples and the region of Campania, a perennial problem exists due to periodic garbage collection strikes and inadequate dump facilities. Residents often resort to burning the garbage which can give off toxic substances that can aggravate respiratory problems. Summer temperatures aggravate this problem.\n\nDisaster Preparedness: Several major earthquake fault lines cross Italy. Principal Italian cities, with the exception of Naples, do not lie near these faults, but smaller tourist towns, like Assisi, do and have suffered earthquakes. General information about disaster preparedness is available via the Internet from the U.S. Federal Management Agency (FEMA) at http://www.fema.gov. Detailed information on Italy's earthquake fault lines is available from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) at http://www.usgs.gov.\n\nItaly also has several active volcanoes generating geothermal events. Mt. Etna, on the eastern tip of the island of Sicily, has been erupting intermittently since 2000. Mt. Vesuvius, located near Naples, is currently capped and not active. Activity at Mt. Vesuvius is monitored by an active seismic network and sensor system, and no recent seismic activity has been recorded. Two of Italy's smaller islands, Stromboli and Vulcano in the Aeolian Island chain north of Sicily, also have active volcanoes with lava flows. Detailed information on volcano activity in Italy is available from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) at http://www.usgs.gov.\n\nCriminal Penalties: While in a foreign country, a U.S. citizen is subject to that country's laws and regulations. They may differ significantly from those of the United States and may not afford the protections available to the individual under U.S. law. Penalties for breaking the law can be more severe than in the United States for similar offenses. Persons violating Italian law, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested or imprisoned. Penalties for possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs in Italy are severe and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Engaging in illicit sexual conduct with children or using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country is a crime, prosecutable in the United States.\n\nChildren's Issues: For information on international adoption of children and international parental child abduction, see the Office of Children's Issues website at http://travel.state.gov/family.\n\nRegistration and Embassy and Consulate Locations: Americans living or traveling in Italy are encouraged to register with the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate through the State Department's travel registration website, https://travelregistra-tion.state.gov, and to obtain updated information on travel and security within Italy. Americans without Internet access may register directly with the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. By registering, American citizens make it easier for the Embassy or Consulate to contact them in case of emergency. The U.S. Embassy is located at Via V.

Crop farming, sheep farming, and the working of stone from the quarries formed the early backbone of San Marino’s economy. It has no mineral resources, and today most of the land is cultivated or covered by woods.\n\nAccording to tradition, San Marino was founded in AD 301 when a Christian stonemason named Marinus the Dalmatian fled to the island of Arbe to escape the anti-Christian Roman Emperor Diocletian. Marinus hid on the peak of Mount Titano and founded a small community of people following their Christian beliefs. It is certain that the area had been inhabited since prehistoric times, although evidence of existence on Mount Titano only dates back to the Middle Ages. In memory of the stonecutter, the land was renamed “Land of San Marino” and was finally changed to its present-day name, “Republic of San Marino.”\n\nThe original government structure was composed of a self-governed assembly known as the Arengo, which consisted of the heads of each family. In 1243, the positions of Captains Regent (Capitani Reggenti)\n\nwere established to be the joint heads of state. The land area of San Marino consisted only of Mount Titano until 1463, at which time the republic entered into an alliance against Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, Lord of Rimini, who was later defeated. As a result, Pope Pius II Piccolomini gave San Marino the towns of Fiorentino, Montegiardino, and Serravalle. Later that year, the town of Faetano joined the republic on its own accord. Since then, the size of San Marino has remained unchanged.\n\nSan Marino has been occupied by foreign militaries twice in its history, both for only short periods of time. In 1503, Cesare Borgia, known as Valentino, occupied the republic until his death several months later. In 1739, Cardinal Alberoni used military force to occupy the country. Civil disobedience was used to protest his occupation, and clandestine notes sent to the Pope to obtain justice were answered by the Pope’s recognition of San Marino’s rights and restoration of San Marino’s independence.\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nThe Arengo, initially formed with the heads of each family, relinquished its power to the Great and General Council. In 1243, the first two Captains Regent were nominated by the Council, and this method of nomination is still in use today. The Council is composed of 60 members who are elected every 5 years under a proportional representation system in all nine administrative districts. These districts (Townships) correspond to the old parishes of the Republic, and each one is ruled by a Council, which is chaired by a Captain elected every 5 years. The Great and General Council approves the budget, as well as the nominations of Captains Regent and heads of the Executive.\n\nEvery 6 months, the Council elects two Captains Regent to be the heads of state. The Regents are chosen from opposing parties so they can keep an eye on each other. They serve a 6-month term. The investiture of the Captains Regent takes place on April 1 and October 1 in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have 3 days in which to file complaints about the previous Regents’ activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the former head(s) of state can be initiated.\n\nThe State Congress, composed of 10 Secretaries, wields executive power. The 10 Secretaries are (1) Secretary of State for Foreign and Political Affairs, and Economic Planning; (2) Secretary of State for Internal Affairs and Civil Defense; (3) Secretary of State for Finance, Budget, and Relations with the State Philatelic and Numismatic Office; (4) Secretary of State for Education, Culture, University and Social Affairs; (5) Secretary of State for Territory, Environment and Agriculture; (6) Secretary of State for Health and Social Security; (7) Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Relations with the Azienda Autonoma di Stato for Services; (8) Secretary of State for Communication, Transport, Tourism, and Sport; (9) Secretary of State for Justice, Information, and Peace; and (10) Secretary of State for Labor and Cooperation.\n\nThe Great and General Council elects the Council of Twelve for the duration of the Legislature and serves a jurisdictional body that also acts as a third instance Court of Appeals. Two government inspectors represent the State in financial and patrimonial questions.\n\nThe Legislative body consists of the Great and General Council, the parliament, and a unicameral Chamber. The members of parliament are usually elected every five years and are in charge of legislation, justice, and the administration of jurisdiction. In addition, they are tasked with electing the Captains Regent, the State Congress, the Council of Twelve, the Advising Commission, and the Government Unions once the Council nominates them. Parliament also has the power to ratify contracts with other countries. The parliament is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of 15 councils which examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on being submitted to the Great and General Council. The judiciary is composed of the commissioner of the law, the judging magistrate, the appellate judge, the juvenile court, and the judge of last appeal. The commissioner tries civil and penal cases with penalties not exceeding a three-year sentence. The judging magistrates, who are appointed by parliament for a three-year term and can be indefinitely reappointed, preside over all other cases.\n\nReform legislation, enacted in 2004, no longer requires that the country’s lower court judges be noncitizens; however, most lower court judges remained Italian citizens. A local conciliation judge handles cases of minor importance. Under the same reform, the final court of review is the judge of the last appeal. In civil matters, this judge confirms or overrules either the lower court judgment or an appellate decision; in criminal matters, he judges on the legitimacy of detention measures and on the enforcement of a judgment.\n\nOn April 28, 2005 a new act established the country’s constitutional court with the following functions: 1) to verify that laws, acts, and traditions that are given the force of law conform to constitutional precepts; 2) to verify the admissibility of a referendum; 3) to decide on conflicts between constitutional institutions; 4) to control the activity of the Captains Regent. The court is composed of three standing judges and three alternate judges. They are selected by the Great and General Council with a two-thirds majority to a four-year term. After the first selection one-third of the members of the court are reselected every two years.\n\nPrincipal Government Officials\n\nLast Updated: 12/18/2006\n\nCaptain Regent (Co-Head of State): Antonio CARATTONI\n\nCaptain Regent (Co-Head of State):Roberto GIORGETTI\n\nSec. of Budget & Finance: Stefano MACINA\n\nSec. of Health & Social Security: Fabio BERARDI\n\nSec. of Industry, Trade, & Research: Tito MASI\n\nSec. of Interior & Civil Protection: Valeria CIAVATTA\n\nSec. of Justice, Information, & Peace: Ivan FOSCHI\n\nSec. of Labor: Antonello BACCIOCCHI\n\nSec. of Public Education, Culture, & Social Affairs: Francesca MICHELOTTI\n\nSec. of State for Foreign & Political Affairs & for Economic Planning: Fiorenzo STOLFI\n\nSec. of Territory, Environment, & Agriculture: Marino RICCARDI\n\nSec. of Tourism, Telecommunications, Transportation, Economic Cooperation, & Sports: Paride ANDREOLI\n\nPermanent Representative to the UN, New York: Daniele BODINI\n\nSan Marino has honorary Consulates General in Washington, DC and New York and honorary Consulates in Detroit and Honolulu. The honorary Consulate General in Washington, DC is located at 1899 L Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20036. The Republic of San Marino’s Web Site provides information on politics, trade, and events in San Marino.\n\nPOLITICAL CONDITIONS\n\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. The two main parties are the Democratic Christian Party of San Marino (PDCS), and the Party of Socialists and Democrats (PSD), in addition to several other smaller parties.\n\nDue to the small size and low population of San Marino, it is difficult for any party to gain a pure majority, and most of the time the government is run by a coalition. Following the June 2006 election results, the PSD formed a center-left coalition government with the Popular Alliance and the United Left parties.\n\nBecause tourism accounts for more than 50% of the economic sector, the government relies not only on taxes and customs for revenue but also the sale of coins and postage stamps to collectors throughout the world. In addition, the Italian Government pays San Marino an annual budget subsidy provided under the terms of the Basic Treaty with Italy. In recent years banking has also become an important economic activity.\n\nHarmonization of statutes and policies with the EU is a major domestic and foreign policy priority of the republic. Another priority issue is the signing of a cooperation agreement with Italy, San Marino’s most important economic partner.\n\nECONOMY\n\nSan Marino’s per capita GNP in 2003 stood at 26,654 Euros with more than 50% coming from the tourism industry, which draws about 3 million people annually. Traditional economic activities in San Marino were food crops, sheep farming, and stone quarrying. Today farming activities focus on grain, vines, and orchards, as well as animal husbandry (cattle and swine). Besides the tourism industry, San Marino makes most of its income from the banking industry and from the manufacture and export of ceramics, tiles, furniture, clothing, paints, fabrics, and spirits/wines. The per capita level of output and standard of living in San Marino are comparable to those of Italy. In addition, San Marino maintains the lowest unemployment rate in Europe and no national debt.\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\n\nSan Marino is an active player in the international community. Currently, the Republic has diplomatic relations with over 70 countries. Italy is the only country represented by an ambassador resident in San Marino. The Papal Nuncio, based in Rome, is the dean of San Marino’s diplomatic corps.\n\nSan Marino is a full member of the United Nations (UN), International Court of Justice (ICJ), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Health Organization (WHO), World Tourism Organization (WTO), Council of Europe, International Red Cross Organization, the International Institution for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIIT), and Interpol, among others. It also cooperates with UNICEF and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and has official relations with the European Union (EU). From May 10 until November 6, 1990, San Marino held the semiannual presidency of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, headquartered in Strasbourg, France, and it is preparing to do the same for the period November 2006-May 2007.\n\nU.S.-SAN MARINO RELATIONS\n\nThe United States and San Marino enjoy friendly diplomatic relations. San Marino consistently supports U.S. foreign policy positions, as well as U.S. candidates to international organizations. The two countries are on excellent terms. The United States Consul General in Florence also serves as the U.S. diplomatic representative to San Marino. However, in September 2006 President George W. Bush appointed Ambassador to Italy Ronald P. Spogli as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to San Marino. When the accreditation process is completed, Ambassador Spogli will be the first U.S. Ambassador to San Marino in the country’s history. For consular purposes, the republic is within the jurisdiction of the Florence consular district. Consulate officials regularly visit San Marino to carry out diplomatic demarches, represent U.S. interests, and administer consular services.\n\nPrincipal U.S. Embassy Officials\n\nFLORENCE (CG) Address: Lungarno A.

Ma\n\nLast Updated: 5/3/2006\n\nTRAVEL\n\nConsular Information Sheet : January 22, 2007\n\nCountry Description: Italy is a developed democracy with a modern economy. The Holy See is a sovereign entity that serves as the ecclesiastical, governmental and administrative capital of the Roman Catholic Church, physically located within the State of the Vatican City inside Rome, with a unique, non-traditional economy. San Marino is a developed, constitutional democratic republic, also independent of Italy, with a modern economy. Tourist facilities are widely available.\n\nEntry Requirements: A valid passport is required. Italian authorities may deny entry to travelers who attempt to enter without a valid passport. A visa is not required for tourist stays up to three months. However, for all other purposes, such as work, study, etc., a visa is required and must be obtained from the Italian Embassy or Consulates before entering Italy. For further information concerning visas and entry requirements for Italy, travelers may contact the Embassy of Italy at 3000 Whitehaven St NW, Washington, DC 20008, via telephone at (202) 612-4400 or via the internet: http://www.ambwashingtondc.esteri.it/ambasciata_washington, or Italian Consulates General in Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Newark, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, or San Francisco, accessible through the above Internet site.\n\nUnder Italian law, tourists who plan to stay more than eight business days are required to obtain a permesso di soggiorno (permit of stay) within eight business days of their arrival. As of December 11, 2006, tourists may request an application “kit” for the permesso di soggiorno from one of 14,000 national post offices (Poste Italiane). The kit must then be returned to one of 5,332 designated Post Office acceptance locations. Tourists will have to complete a form, provide a complete photocopy of their passport, present sufficient proof of their means of financial support, submit photographs, a photocopy of their insurance policy, photocopy proof of their return to the United States, and pay a fee. It is important that applicants keep a copy of the receipt issued by the Post Office. Failure to obtain the permit of stay within eight days is punishable by fine. Additional information may be obtained from an Italian immigration website via Internet at http://www.portaleimmigrazione.it/.\n\nSafety and Security: There have been occasional episodes of politically motivated violence in Italy, most often connected to Italian internal developments or social issues. At various times, Italian authorities have found bombs outside public buildings, have received bomb threats and were subjects of letter bombs. Firebombs or Molotov cocktails have been thrown at buildings or offices in the middle of the night. These incidents have all been attributed to organized crime or anarchist movements. Americans were not targeted or injured in these instances. Demonstrations may have an anti-American character. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful have the potential to turn into confrontational situations and possibly escalate into violence. U.S. citizens traveling or residing in Italy should take common sense precautions and follow news reports carefully in order to avoid demonstrations and to be aware of heightened security and potential delays when they occur.\n\nItaly remains largely free of terrorist incidents. However, like other countries in the Schengen area, Italy’s open borders with its Western European neighbors allow the possibility of terrorist groups entering/exiting the country with anonymity.\n\nFor the latest security information, Americans traveling abroad should regularly monitor the Department’s Internet web site where the current Travel Warnings and Public Announcements, including the Worldwide Caution Public Announcement, can be found. Up-to-date information on safety and security can also be obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll free in the U.S., or for callers outside the U.S. and Canada, a regular toll-line at 1-202-501-4444. These numbers are available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).\n\nCrime: Italy has a moderate rate of violent crime, some of which is directed towards tourists, principally for motives of theft. Some travelers have been victims of rape and beating. There have also been incidents of drinks laced with drugs being used by criminals to rob, and in some cases, assault tourists. Many of these incidents have occurred in the vicinity of Rome’s Termini train station and at major tourist centers such as Campo de Fiori and Piazza Navona, as well as in Florence and Naples. Criminals using this tactic “befriend” a traveler at a train station, bus stop, restaurant, café or bar in tourist areas, then eventually offer a drink laced with a sleeping drug. When the tourist falls asleep, criminals steal the traveler’s valuables. There have also been instances where the victim was assaulted, either physically or sexually.\n\nAmericans are urged to exercise caution at train stations and airports, and when frequenting nightclubs, bars and outdoor cafes, particularly at night, because criminals may make initial contact with potential victims in such settings. Individuals under the effect of alcohol may become victims of crime, including robbery, physical and sexual assault, due to their impaired ability to judge situations and make decisions. This is particularly a problem for younger Americans visiting Italy, where the age limit on the sale of alcoholic beverages is lower than in most U.S. states. If you are a victim of such a crime, please file a police report and contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest Consulate. There are also in-country organizations, which provide counseling, medical, and legal assistance to certain crime victims.\n\nPetty crimes such as pick pocketing, theft from parked cars, and purse snatching are serious problems, especially in large cities. Pickpockets sometimes dress like businessmen so tourists should not be lulled into a false sense of security by believing that well-dressed individuals are not potential pickpockets or thieves. Most reported thefts occur at crowded tourist sites, on public buses or trains, or at the major railway stations: Rome’s Termini; Milan’s Centrale; Florence’s Santa Maria Novella; and Naples’ Centrale and Piazza Garibaldi. Travelers should also be alert to theft in Milan’s Malpensa Airport, particularly at car rental agencies. Clients of Internet cafes in major cities have been targeted. Tourists who have tried to resist petty thieves on motor scooters have suffered broken arms and collarbones.\n\nThieves in Italy often work in groups or pairs. Pairs of accomplices or groups of street urchins are known to divert tourists’ attention so that another can pickpocket them. In one particular routine, one thief throws trash, waste or ketchup at the victim; a second thief assists the victim in cleaning up the mess; and the third discreetly takes the victim’s belongings. Criminals on crowded public transportation slit the bottoms of purses or bags with a razor blade or sharp knife, and then remove the contents. Theft of small items such as radios, luggage, cameras, briefcases, and even cigarettes from parked cars is a major problem.\n\nCarjacking and theft has also been reported from occupied vehicles waiting in traffic or stopped at traffic lights. Vehicles parked near beaches during the summer have been broken into and items stolen. Robbers take items from cars at gas stations often by smashing car windows.\n\nIn a scam practiced on the highways, one thief signals a flat tire to the driver of another car and encourages the driver to pull over. Often, the tire has been punctured by an accomplice, while in other instances, there may, in fact, be nothing wrong with the vehicle. When the driver stops, one thief helps change the tire, while the other takes the driver’s belongings. Use particular caution driving at night on highways, when there may be a greater incidence of robbery attempts. There have been occasional reports of break-ins of rental cars driven by Americans when the precautions mentioned above were not followed during stops at highway service areas.\n\nOn trains, a commonly reported trick involves one or more persons who pretend to befriend a traveler and offer drugged food or drink. Also, thieves have been known to impersonate police officers to gain the confidence of tourists. The thief shows the prospective victim a circular plastic sign with the words “police” or “international police.” If this happens, the tourist should insist on seeing the officer’s identification card (documento), as impersonators tend not to carry forged documents. Tourists should immediately report thefts or other crimes to the local police.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service in Rome has been advised of, and is assisting Italian Law Enforcement authorities in investigating, an increase in the appearance of ATM skimming devices. These devices are attached to legitimate bank ATMs, usually located in tourist areas, and capture the account information stored electronically on the card’s magnetic strip. The devices consist of a card reader installed over the legitimate reader and a pin-hole video camera mounted above the keypad that records the customer’s PIN. ATMs with skimming devices installed may also allow normal transactions to occur. The victim’s information is sold, traded on-line or encoded on another card such as a hotel key card to access the compromised account. Here are some helpful hints to protect yourself and to identify skimming devices:\n\nUse ATMs located in well-lit public areas, or secured inside the bank/business\n\nCover the keypad with one hand as you enter your PIN\n\nLook for gaps, tampered appearance, or other irregularities between the metal faceplate of the ATM and the card reader\n\nAvoid card readers that are not flush with the face of the ATM\n\nMonitor your account statements for unauthorized transactions\n\nOrganized criminal groups operate throughout Italy, but are more prevalent in the south. They have occasionally resorted to violence to intimidate or to settle disputes. Though the activities of such groups are not generally targeted at tourists, visitors should be aware that innocent bystanders could be injured.\n\nInformation for Victims of Crime: The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported immediately to the local police and the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. If you are the victim of a crime while overseas, in addition to reporting to local police, please contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate for assistance. The Embassy/Consulate staff can, for example, assist you to find appropriate medical care, contact family members or friends and explain how funds could be transferred. Lost or stolen credit cards present risk of identity theft and should be cancelled immediately. Although the investigation and prosecution of the crime is solely the responsibility of local authorities, consular officers can help you to understand the local criminal justice process and to find an attorney if needed.\n\nMedical Facilities and Health Information: Medical facilities are available, but may be limited outside urban areas. Public hospitals, though generally free of charge for emergency services, sometimes do not maintain the same standards as hospitals in the United States, so travelers are encouraged to obtain insurance that would cover a stay in a private Italian hospital or clinic. It is almost impossible to obtain an itemized hospital bill from public hospitals, as required by many U.S. insurance companies, because the Italian National Health Service charges one inclusive rate (care services, bed and board).\n\nInformation on vaccinations and other health precautions, such as safe food and water precautions and insect bite protection, may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s hotline for international travelers at 1-877-FYI-TRIP (1-877-394-8747) or via the CDC’s internet site at http://www.cdc.gov/travel. For information about outbreaks of infectious diseases abroad consult the World Health Organization’s (WHO) website at http://www.who.int/en. Further health information for travelers is available at http://www.who.int/ith.\n\nMedical Insurance: The Department of State strongly urges Americans to consult with their medical insurance company prior to traveling abroad to confirm whether their policy applies overseas and whether it will cover emergency expenses such as a medical evacuation.\n\nTraffic Safety and Road Conditions: While in a foreign country, U.S. citizens may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. The information below concerning Italy is provided for general reference only, and may not be totally accurate in a particular location or circumstance.\n\nStreets in historic city centers are often narrow, winding and congested. Motor scooters are very popular and drivers often see themselves as exempt from conventions that apply to automobiles. Travelers who rent scooters should be particularly cautious. Pedestrians and drivers should be constantly alert to the possibility of scooters’sudden presence. Traffic lights are limited, often disobeyed, and a different convention of right-ofway is observed. Italy has over 5,600 kilometers (3,480 mi.) of “Autostrada,” or superhighways. Commercial and individual vehicles travel and pass on these well-maintained roads at very high speeds. Accidents occur in which contributing factors include excessive speed, alcohol/drug use and/or sleepiness of long-distance drivers. Italy has one of the highest rates of car accident deaths in the European Union.\n\nIn rural areas, a wide range of speed on highways makes for hazardous driving. Roads are generally narrow and often have no guardrails. Travelers in northern Italy, especially in winter, should be aware of fog and poor visibility, responsible for multiple-car accidents each year. Most Italian automobiles are equipped with special fog lights. Roadside assistance in Italy is excellent on the well-maintained toll roads, but limited on secondary roads. Use of safety belts and child restraining devices is mandatory and headlights should be on at all times outside of urban areas.\n\nFor specific information concerning Italian driving permits, vehicle inspection, road tax and mandatory insurance, contact the Italian Government Tourist Board (ENIT) offices via the Internet at: http://www.enit.it, tel: 212-245-4822 or the A.C.I.

For more information, travelers may visit the FAA’s website at http://www.faa.gov.\n\nSpecial Circumstances: Strikes and other work stoppages occur frequently in the transportation sector (national airlines, airports, trains, and bus lines). Most are announced in advance and are of short duration. Information on strikes may be found at http://www.infrastrutturetrasporti.it. Reconfirmation of domestic and international flight reservations is highly recommended.\n\nDisaster Preparedness: Several major earthquake fault lines cross Italy. Principal Italian cities, with the exception of Naples, do not lie near these faults, but smaller tourist towns, like Assisi, do and have suffered earthquakes. General information about disaster preparedness is available via the Internet from the U.S. Federal Management Agency (FEMA) at http://www.fema.gov. Detailed information on Italy’s earthquake "
