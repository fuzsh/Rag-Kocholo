        "text": "How do I get to General Council?\n\nThis year’s event will be held at the Portland Hilton Downtown (921 SW Sixth Ave, Portland, OR 97204).\n\nFrom the South:\n\nTake I-5 North\n\nTake the ramp on the left for I-405 North/US-26 West and Head toward Beaverton\n\nAt Exit 2A, Head right on the ramp for Salmon St. Toward Providence Park\n\nTurn Left on 6th Ave\n\nTurn Left on Taylor St\n\nTurn Left on Broadway St and park in the Loading Zone Area\n\nFrom the East:\n\nTake I-84 West\n\nTake the ramp on the left for I-5 South and head towards Salem\n\nKeep straight to get onto SW Washington St.\n\nTurn Left onto SW Broadway and park in the Loading Zone Area\n\nFrom the West:\n\nTake US-26 East\n\nAt Exit 74, head right on the ramp toward Market Street\n\nKeep Straight to get onto SW Market St\n\nTurn Left onto SW 10th Ave\n\nTurn Right onto SW Yamhill St\n\nTurn Right onto SW Broadway St and park in the Loading Zone Area\n\nLuggage and Parking:\n\nUpon arriving at the Portland Hilton Downtown, attendees should temporarily park by the Hotel along Broadway Street (Red box on map below). We will have SEIU volunteers ready to help unload luggage into the back lobby area. Volunteers will stay with attendees’ luggage while they go to park their vehicle.\n\nParking for General Council will be in the Garage at 5th & Taylor next to the Duniway Hotel (Blue Box on map below). Follow the pink dotted line on the map to get to the parking garage. Do not leave any valuables, luggage or anything visible in your vehicle.\n\nDrive down Broadway and turn Left on Salmon Street.\n\nContinue two blocks and turn left on 5th Street.\n\nContinue one block and turn left on Taylor Street. The Parking Garage Entrance will be on the Right side of the street halfway down the block. If you pass the Duniway Hotel you have gone too far.\n\nCharges for Parking in the Garage will be charged to your hotel room at the Hilton Downtown. Members who live locally and are not staying at the hotel will also be able to get their parking validated by picking up a parking pass at the Event Check-In/Help Desk. After parking your car in the designated lot, follow the green line to reach the entrance of the hotel on foot.\n\nHotel Check-In Details:\n\nLodging Confirmations will be sent out from the union no later than July 29. When you arrive, please use your first and last name to check into the hotel room. You should not be asked for a credit card at check-in. You should not be asked to provide the hotel with your credit card. If there is a discrepancy with the hotel and what you believe is your lodging status, please visit us at our SEIU lodging check in table so we can address the discrepancy.\n\nThose that are lodging on site should not bill any items to their room other than parking charges. Should any other items be charged to your room (ie. Meals, snacks, drinks, movies) you will be billed back for the charges. If you are in a shared room with another member and notice your roommate is billing items to your room, please visit the SEIU event check-in desk to help us identify the appropriate person to bill for these charges. You can also notify us to issues by emailing us at orders@seiu503.org if that is more convenient.\n\nAfter checking into the hotel, please go to the Plaza Level Floor to find our Event Check-In Area. There will be multiple tables to visit as part of the check-in process to ensure everyone has all of the materials and other support information for the weekend. After Checking-In, please visit the partner tables on the Plaza Level. These tables will change throughout the event with different partners, so check back each day to see what groups are new!\n\nTechnology & Interpretation for General Council:\n\nThis year we will again be hosting a General Council App! This tool will help both in-person and virtual attendees navigate the event and connect with each other. You will receive a separate email in the days prior to General Council with instructions on how to download the app and use it. If you have any trouble with the app we will have staff available onsite to assist you.\n\nThis year we will be working with a new company to provide universal interpretation for attendees. All attendees will be issued a transmitter to listen to all program in your chosen language. These devices will need to be returned on Sunday at the end of programming.\n\nThe conference platform we will be using for interpretation will have an online platform for slides and other presentations. We encourage members to bring their own smart tablet/device/computer to view these materials up close. Members will be able to log into the platform on their own devices to see the presentation in their own language. Members who primarily speak a language other than English, who do not have an iPad or other smart device can borrow one for the duration of the conference. These iPads will need to be returned at the end of the event.\n\nWorkshops at General Council:\n\nWorkshop will start at 1 PM on Thursday and take place on the Grand Ballroom Level. Please arrive early enough to check in on Thursday before going to a workshop.\n\nYou can view the workshop descriptions here: https://seiu503.org/who-we-are/member-leadership/general-council/general-council-2024/general-council-2024-workshops/\n\nPlease select the workshops you are planning to attend via this form so we have enough materials prepared.\n\nMeals & Dietary Support:\n\nMeals will start with our Welcome Reception on Thursday evening at 5:30 PM. Thursday Lunch will be provided for Board Members during the board meeting and for staff and volunteers who are helping with final set up of the venue.\n\nMeals will be buffet for most functions. Menu items will be labeled and list dietary concerns. We will have alternate options when necessary for those who have indicated dietary restrictions. If you have any concerns regarding your specific dietary needs, please see our staff at the help desk for additional support.\n\nHealth & Safety at General Council:\n\nWhile we are excited to see all of you in person, we do want to recognize that COVID and other summer colds are not something that we want to share amongst our attendees. If you feel ill in the days leading up to General Council we encourage you to stay home. We can change your registration to be that of a virtual attendee so you can still take part in the program and governance sessions of General Council. If you start to feel ill, please email us at orders@seiu503.org to request that your registration be changed to a virtual attendee. Thank you for helping us keep everyone as safe and healthy as possible.\n\nResolutions & Early Voting:\n\nVoting on the Early Resolutions is currently underway. You should have received a separate email with your voting information. If you have not received this information yet and would like the information re-sent, please call the Member Assistance Center at 844-503-SEIU (7348) for assistance.\n\nLinks to all resolutions under consideration this year can be found on our General Council website: https://seiu503.org/who-we-are/member-leadership/general-council/general-council-2024/\n\nIf you requested a paper copy of resolutions, those will be available for pick up at General Council as part of the check-in process.\n\nThank you again for your commitment to the governance of our union and we look forward to seeing you in just a couple weeks!"
