        "text": "On this page\n\nThe Royal Family\n\nGovernment of Canada dignitaries\n\nIndigenous dignitaries\n\nProvincial and territorial dignitaries\n\nForeign dignitaries\n\nReligious dignitaries\n\nOthers\n\nThe table below indicates the appropriate way to use formal and honorific titles to address individuals in a respectful way, both in writing and in conversation.\n\nFormal titles are granted according to the position or office a person occupies. In Canada, two types of formal titles are used: “Right Honourable” and “Honourable.” In some cases, they are used only while serving and in others, they are kept for life. This information can be found in the table of titles.\n\nComplimentary to the formal titles are honorific titles. In Canada, examples would include the use of “Your Excellency” when addressing the Governor General.\n\nAlso, it should be noted that before addressing a person, in writing or verbally, one should verify their preferences. Some people might prefer to omit titles such as “Sir” or “Madam” or replace them by an alternate title such as “MxFootnote 1”. People who define their gender identity as neither male nor female but as being outside of the gender binary may prefer to use gender-neutral pronouns. Termium offers a list of commonly used gender-neutral pronouns but preferred gender pronouns should be confirmed with the person concerned.\n\nRather than risking offending the recipient by using the wrong gender, you may omit the courtesy title, such as “Dear P. T. Smith” rather than “Dear Mr. Smith”Footnote 2.\n\nThe Royal Family\n\nGovernment of Canada dignitaries\n\nN.B. Each individual incumbent of the positions listed below may have additional honours and distinctions, whose post-nominal letters will follow the Order of Precedence of the Canadian Honours System.\n\nIndigenous dignitaries\n\nAs there are over 650 Indigenous communities and over 50 Indigenous nations in Canada, each with its own heritage, culture, and social system, it cannot be assumed that standard titles or styles of address can relate to all Indigenous Peoples. It is strongly recommended to confirm with the person you are meeting or the community you are visiting how they wish to be addressed.\n\nN.B. The titles indicated above are intended as examples. There are many other community-based, provincial or national Indigenous organizations across Canada that use their own governing structure and titles. Many of these organizations have adopted a corporate structure for their Board, including generic titles such as Vice-President, Director, Treasurer and Secretary, which are not listed above.\n\nProvincial and territorial dignitaries\n\nForeign dignitaries\n\nReligious dignitaries\n\nOthers"
