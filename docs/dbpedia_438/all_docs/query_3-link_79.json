        "text": "The Portland City Council voted on Wednesday to pass two ordinances to keep the Blazers at the Moda Center through the 2030 season.\n\nAccording to officials, the agreement with Rip City Management also has a five-year extension option.\n\nThe current lease ends in October of next year. The city says the two ordinances are critical to give both sides more time to come up with a long-term partnership for a major renovation of the arena.\n\nOfficials say the Moda Center was built in 1995, making it almost 30 years old.\n\nThe retention of the Blazers is very much a cornerstone of our city's future economically and more fundamentally in restoring and protecting social fabric and national reputation, we need to put on the table the possibility of replacing the stadium or at minimum a material remodel to position our city for the future,\" Rene Gonzalez said.\n\nThe Moda Center brings in about 1.5 million visitors a year, generating $600 million in economic activity."
