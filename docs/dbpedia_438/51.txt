San Marino is a unitary multi-party parliamentary directorial republic. The two Captains Regent are the heads of state for a term of six months. The State Congress, which consists of a maximum of 10 Secretaries, forms the government and exercises executive power. Although all the Secretaries of the Congress are officially equal, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Political Affairs is regarded as the acting Prime Minister. The unicameral parliament, or the Grand and General Council, exercises legislative power and elects the heads of state and Secretaries. General elections take place once every four years. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.

Coalitions featuring a cross-section of political parties are typically required to form the government. Government collapses are rare. State institutions are competent and effective and provide reliable services across the country.
