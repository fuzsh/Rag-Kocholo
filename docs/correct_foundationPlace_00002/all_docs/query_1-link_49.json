        "text": "P1 - You are to establish project aims and objectives for the above scenario.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe aim is your overall intention for the project. It is the reason why you are doing the research and signals where you hope to be by the end.\n\nThe aim is to research IBM are technology companies responsible for protecting the health, safety, and wellbeing of users of their products and services.\n\nThe International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is an American multinational information technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York, with operations in over 170 countries. The company began in 1911, founded in Endicott, New York, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was renamed 'International Business Machines in 1924. IBM is incorporated in New York.\n\nIBM produces and sells computer hardware, middleware, and software, and provides hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology.\n\nThe objectives are the specific steps you will take to get there. The objectives are the specific steps you will take to achieve your aim. These are usually formatted as a numbered list to make it easy to see the main steps of the project.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of users of IBM company.\n\nTo build a health, safety, and well-being of product to user.\n\nTo improving the health, safety, and wellbeing of users of IBM services.\n\nP2 - Produce a project management plan that covers aspects of cost, scope, time, quality, communication, risk, and resources.\n\nScope:\n\nProject scope is the part of project planning that involves determining and documenting a list of specific project goals, deliverables, features, functions, tasks, deadlines, and ultimately costs. In other words, it is what needs to be achieved and the work that must be done to deliver a project.\n\nProject scope is part of the project plan and involves identifying and documenting a list of specific project objectives, deliverables, tasks, costs, and deadlines. Project scope documentation (called the scope statement, terms of reference or job description) describes the scope of the project, identifies the responsibilities of each team member, and sets out procedures for how to verify and approve completed work.\n\nIt defines its boundaries and called as requirements. It can refer product scope or project scope:\n\nProduct scope as the functions and features that characterize a product or a service.\n\nProject scope is the work that must be done in order to deliver a product according to the product’s scope.\n\nCost:\n\nProject costs are the total funds required to complete a project or work, including direct and indirect costs. Project costs are any expenses listed or estimated to be incurred to complete the project or monetary obligations that have been incurred or estimated to be incurred, as listed in the project baseline.\n\nQuality:\n\nProject quality management is an area of ​​knowledge related to project quality in project management. It involves project management of the final product of the project and the project itself. The goal of project quality management is to use specific processes and activities to identify, evaluate, control, and achieve product quality.\n\nManufacturers in many industries are under pressure due to poor production quality. As manufacturers struggle with costly scrap and rework, the costs associated with poor quality are rising. In addition, reputational impact is more disruptive than ever, and the cost of recalling failed products is increasing.\n\nUnfortunately, traditional quality control and inspection techniques are expensive, time-consuming, error-prone, and sometimes even dangerous. However, this may change as Industry 4.0 establishes its own new specifications. McKinsey believes that with Industry 4.0, manufacturers can see a 10-20% increase in quality costs.\n\nIBM is committed to achieving the highest quality standards. Quality is the foundation of our value proposition, brand image, and the cornerstone of IBM's long-lasting relationship, which is vital to the success of our customers.\n\nCustomers' perspectives on IBM and its products and services are a lens for assessing market quality. Our goal is to bring value to customers every time they interact with IBM, either directly or through our business partners in all the geographic markets we serve. IBM listens to customer feedback and uses these insights to improve the customer experience and quality. Customers choose IBM and recommend it to their business partners, and colleagues and friends' decisions will be part of IBM's measurement of success.\n\nThe head of IBM is responsible for understanding how customers interact with IBM, defining metrics and improvement goals, and actions that drive quality goals. Hopefully, all IBM employees can model nine IBM practices to define everything we do on behalf of the company.\n\nCommunication:\n\nCommunication is the key to project management. To successfully execute the project, effective communication with all stakeholders is essential. Many projects fail due to lack of communication or inefficiency. Communication is best defined as the exchange of information and the expression of ideas, thoughts, and feelings through words and other methods. In project management, this means the exchange of knowledge, skills, and experience.\n\nIBM® Personal Communications is host communication and terminal emulation package for Microsoft® Windows ™. Now with a complete 64-bit architecture, it has virtual terminal (VT) emulation and system network architecture (SNA) application support and provides a platform to access data and applications on different host systems. It is a component of the IBM Host Access Client Package (HACP) and the IBM Host Integration Solution.\n\nFull 64-bit architecture eases management tasks\n\nThe 64-bit enhancements make it easier to manage environment from the Host Access Client Package server to save configurations and rapidly download updates. And the Managed HOD environment replaces the browser on the local machine and removes the need to download the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).\n\nPlatform-independent solution\n\nIncludes Standalone Host On-Demand (HOD) client application, a Java® based standalone version of IBM Host on-Demand emulator—making it a platform-independent application solution for host access. It handles a wide variety of protocols, including ISDN, High-Performance Routing (HPR), SNA, TN3270(e), TN5250, and IP. Provides SNA interfaces for logical unit applications (LUA), advanced program-to-program communications (APPC), and common programming interface for communications (CPI-C) on Windows.\n\nTime-saving utilities\n\nBoosts troubleshooting efficiency with debug tools such as Trace utility. Provides multilingual support, including double-byte character set (DBCS) languages, euro sign support, and extensive keyboard and code-page support. The product includes the option to print from display or printer sessions and provides a print preview option of collected screens should you wish to proceed with printing or abort and collect different screens.\n\nEnhanced security\n\nConnects to security-enabled servers with support for load-balancing Service Location Protocol (SLP). Includes Bypass Sign-on Using Password Substitution, Kerberos Services Ticket Auto-Sign on, and Certificate Express Logon. Allows the Client-Server negotiation over GSKIT secure channel using certificates. Offers a secure FTP client.\n\nP3: You are to produce a work breakdown structure, a Gantt chart to provide timeframes and stages for completion.\n\nA work breakdown structure (WBS) is a delivery-oriented, hierarchical decomposition that is performed by a project team to accomplish project goals and create the work required for delivery. WBS is the basis for effective project planning, execution, control, monitoring, and reporting. All work included in the WBS will be identified, estimated, scheduled, and budgeted.\n\nThe work breakdown structure (WBS) was developed to build consensus on the scope of the project. It is a hierarchical description of the work that must be done to complete a project deliverable. Each descending layer in the work breakdown structure represents an increasingly detailed description of the project deliverables.\n\nA Gantt chart is a bar chart used to illustrate the progress of a project, named after its inventor, Henry Gantt, who designed it from 1910 to 1915. The modern Gantt chart also shows the dependencies between the activity and the current progress status.\n\nA Gantt chart is a horizontal bar chart that visually represents a project plan over a period of time. Modern Gantt charts usually show you the status of each task in the project and who is responsible.\n\nTask\n\nWeek 1\n\nWeek 2\n\nWeek 3\n\nWeek 4\n\nWeek 5\n\nWeek 6\n\nWeek 7\n\nP1 Devise project aims and objectives for a chosen scenario.\n\nP2 Produce a project management plan that covers aspects of cost, scope, time, quality, communication, risk and resources.\n\nP3 Produce a work breakdown structure and a Gantt Chart to provide timeframes and stages for completion.\n\nP4 Carry out small-scale research by applying qualitative and quantitative research methods appropriate for meeting project aims and objectives.\n\nP5 Analyze research and data using appropriate tools and techniques.\n\nP6 Communicate appropriate recommendations as a result of research and data analysis to draw valid and meaningful conclusions.\n\nP7 Reflect on the value of undertaking the research to meet stated objectives and own learning and performance.\n\nFinal submission of the project\n\nP4 - Carry out small-scale research by applying qualitative and quantitative research methods appropriate for meeting project aims and objectives.\n\nA survey is defined as a research methodology used to collect data from a predefined set of respondents to obtain information and insights on a variety of topics of interest. Surveys have multiple purposes and can be conducted in a variety of ways depending on the method chosen and the goals to be achieved.\n\nData is usually obtained through the use of standardized procedures, the purpose of which is to ensure that each respondent is able to answer questions in a level playing field to avoid prejudice that may affect research or research results. A survey involves asking people for information through a questionnaire that can be distributed in paper form, although with the advent of new technologies, the use of social media, email, QR codes or URLs to distribute information is more common.\n\nAs a field of applied statistics for human research surveys, survey methods have studied the techniques of collecting a single unit sample from the population and the collection of survey data, such as the construction of questionnaires and methods to improve the number and accuracy of survey responses.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is your name\n\nDo u know IBM\n\nHow do u know IBM\n\nHave u used IBM before or currently using? (SQL, hard disk, IBM software)\n\nDo u think IBM still famous in Malaysia?\n\nHow satisfied were u with IBM service experience?\n\nHow could IBM improve the services\n\nDo u think IBM is easy to use?\n\nDo u think IBM responsible in users’ health, safety and well-being?\n\nBased to previous question, state your reason if you choose NO.\n\nWill you support IBM if they offers services that responsible for users’ health, safety and wellbeing (eg: data security, time limitation or virus scanner)?\n\nDo you agree that IBM offers better services than other companies?\n\nDo you think IBM really provide a convenience service for the users?\n\nBased on the previous question, provide your reason for choosing NO.\n\nWill you recommend IBM services to your family or friends?\n\nPlease give the reason for choosing NO in previous question.\n\nP5 - Analyze research and data using appropriate tools and techniques.\n\nQuestion 1 ask the user name.\n\nQuestion 2 ask the user about the IBM.\n\nQuestion 3 ask the user how do know IBM.\n\nQuestion 4 ask the user have used IBM before or currently using.\n\nQuestion 5 ask about the IBM still famous in Malaysia.\n\nQuestion 6 ask about the user satisfaction level to the IBM service experience.\n\nQuestion 7 ask about how could IBM improve the services.\n\nQuestion 8 ask about IBM is easy to use.\n\nQuestion 9 ask about the IBM responsible in users’ health, safety and well-being.\n\nQuestion 10 ask about the reason for question 9.\n\nQuestion 11 ask about the user will support the IBM if they offers services that responsible for users’ health, safety and wellbeing.\n\nQuestion 12 ask about the user agree that IBM offer better services than other companies.\n\nQuestion 13 ask the IBM really provide a convenience service for the users.\n\nQuestion 14 ask the reason for choosing NO on question 13.\n\nQuestion 15 ask about the user will recommend IBM services to family or friends.\n\nQuestion 16 ask the reason for question 15.\n\nP6 - Communicate appropriate recommendations as a result of research and data analysis to draw valid and meaningful conclusions.\n\nBased on scenario, I create a survey about the managing a successful computing project. I used the product is IBM company. The first question I require user insert their name. The second question was I ask user “Do u know IBM”. The result is 80% answer yes, 10% No, 10% answer maybe. The third question was “how do u know IBM”, the result is 70% that knew from social media, 20 % is advertisement, 10% is knew from family and relative. The question 4 is “have u used IBM before or currently using? (SQL, hard disk, IBM software), the result is 70% have using and 30% are not using. The question 5 is “do u think IBM still famous in Malaysia”, the result is 66.7% users think still famous in Malaysia, 11.1 % users are think not famous in Malaysia and 22.2 % not sure.\n\nQuestion 6 “how satisfied were u with IBM service experience?” the result is 10% user give the 5 satisfied level, 50% give 4 satisfied level and 40% give 3 satisfied level. The question 7 I was required the user give the comment for the IBM services, the result is users hope they can offers more services, to have more innovative products, to improve at the security of the user’s data, more service centers, more option, give more details to the public, can improve the life of human and upgrade info. The question 8 I was ask “do u think IBM is easy to use?” the result is 55.6% answer yes, 11.1% answer no, 33.3% answer maybe. The question 9 I ask about “do u think IBM responsible in users’ health, safety and well-being”, the result is 70% answer maybe, 30% answer yes. The question 9 “will you support IBM if they offers services that responsible for users’ health, safety and wellbeing (eg: data security, time limitation or virus scanner), the result is 70% answer yes, 10% answer no and 20% answer maybe.\n\nThe question 11 “do you agree that IBM offers better services than other companies”, the result is only one user gives 5 star, 3 users give 4 star, and 6 users give 3 star. The question 13 “do you think IBM really provide a convenience service for the users”, the result is 50% users think maybe, the 50% think yes. The question 15 “will you recommend IBM services to your family or friends”, the result is 60% answer maybe, the 40% user answer 40%.\n\nP7- Reflect on the value of undertaking the research to meet stated objectives and own learning and performance.\n\nTo conclude that, I research the aim and objective of the IBM company. It help us can know about the aim and objective of the IBM company. After that, I research the scope, cost, quality and communication of the IBM. I know that the scope of this company is create a product scope as the functions and features that characterize a product or a service.\n\nThe Gantt chart is recorded the routine during research the data of this project. The Gantt chart is simply record to let other people can read and understand. After that, I use the Google forms to do the survey about the IBM to my friends and family. I create some question to ask them to get the responses of the IBM. I refer the objectives to create the question to collect the data.\n\nNext, I collected the results from my family and friends and analysis the results. From the result I know that IBM still have people use it and they also give some comments hope can to improve the services. From this survey, it can helps us to know it better the service of IBM.\n\nI follow the tasks given to complete, I learn about how to complete and manage a project. We can through Internet, books, reference, social media and so on to collect the data. We also can collect the data from our friends and family or carry out survey. From this project I can learn more about the product and service of IBM.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom this project, I learned how to write a report that is target a company which is IBM to collect the aim, objective, create a survey to collect the data. After conducting the survey, we get to understand more about the IBM Company such as scope, cost, aim, objectives, and so on.\n\nThrough this project, I gained a lot of experience and prepared myself for possible challenges in the future.\n\nReference:"
