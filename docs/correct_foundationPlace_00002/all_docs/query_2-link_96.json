In this special rebroadcast episode of Smart Talks with IBM, Malcolm Gladwell and Jacob Goldstein explore the conceptual underpinnings of modern AI with Dr. David Cox, VP of AI Models at IBM Research. They talk foundation models, self-supervised machine learning, and the practical applications of AI and data platforms like watsonx in business and technology.\n\nWhen we first aired this episode last year, the concept of foundation models was just beginning to capture our attention. Since then, this technology has evolved and redefined the boundaries of what's possible. Businesses are becoming more savvy about selecting the right models and understanding how they can drive revenue and efficiency.\n\nThis is a paid advertisement from IBM.
