        "text": "Black joined Brookhaven Lab in 2006 as a scientist and became leader of the Electronic Nanomaterials Group the following year. Using his expertise in block copolymers, or linked polymer chains, he has developed nanostructures for a broad range of applications, including photovoltaic devices, superhydrophobic surfaces, and chemical sensors.\n\nPrior to coming to the CFN, Black spent 10 years as a research staff member at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, where he began his career after obtaining a PhD in physics from Harvard University in 1996. While working at IBM, he pioneered the use of polymer self-assembly for the fabrication of high-performance semiconductor devices for microelectronics.\n\nBlack is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, a member of the Board of Directors of the Materials Research Society, and a Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.\n\nHis inventions, more than 40 of which have been patented during his careers at Brookhaven and IBM, include novel electronic devices and electrical contact designs, photovoltaic materials and structures, water-repellent and broadband antireflective nanostructured surfaces, and tools for the quantitative analysis of nanostructures.\n\nHis research contributions have been recognized through numerous awards, including Battelle's 2014 \"Inventor of the Year\" award for his CFN work on nanoscale self-assembly approaches. Last year, Innovate Long Island recognized Black's work on antireflective coatings with an Innovator of the Year Award in Science and Technology. Previously, he has received an IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Award, an IndustryWeek Technology of the Year Award, and a World Technology Award for Information Technology Hardware.\n\nDr. Stefano Cabrini is the Director of the Nanofabrication Facility at the Molecular Foundry (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) since 2006; leader of the interfacility Single Digit Nano Fabrication and Assembling program. Molecular Foundry is one of the five DOE NanoScale Research Center, a user oriented facility. Stefano Cabrini got his Laurea degree at “Universita’ degli studi di Roma La Sapienza”; his postdoctoral experience was at the IOTA Inst. Theor. & Appl. Optics (France). He worked as researcher at CNR Istituto di Elettronica dello Stato Solido (IESS) of Rome Italy and as senior scientist at Sincrotrone Triese ScpA and INFM ELETTRA Synchrotron Light Source of Trieste Italy. He has over 170 publications in the field of nanofabrication and 25 years of experience in experimental physics, 18 years of experience in micro-nano-fabrication, electron-beam lithography, focused ion beam lithography, thin-film deposition and plasma etch processing. Also Dr. Cabrini has experience in nanophotonic and metamaterials (metallic and dielectric resonators), semiconductor device fabrication, optical device fabrication, N-MEMS fabrication, and the development of new lithographic tools. Recently he focuses on the so called Single Digit Nano Fabrication, or exact fabrication and organization of nanostructures with dimensions below 10 nm. He is the co-editor with Prof Satoshi Kawata of the book: “Nanofabrication Handbook” CRC Press 2012.\n\nDr. Gerecht is a Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Duke University since 2022. Before moving to Duke, she was a Professor and the Director of the Institute for Nanobiotechnology at the Whiting Scholl of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Gerecht is a global expert in vascular and stem cell biology and engineering, including pioneering engineering principles to understand and harness cell fate decisions for therapeutic developments. She and her lab team study how the microenvironment modulates stem cell fate, differentiation, and tissue assembly. These include understanding how various properties of the extracellular matrix modulate cellular responses and how oxygen gradients regulate tissue performance. They develop biomaterials to guide morphogenesis through sequential activation of signaling pathways to form functional tissues and use a range of disease and injury models to delineate thesemechanisms in vivo.\n\nDr. Gerecht is the recipient of the Allan C. Davis Medal from the Maryland Academy of Sciences (2008), the North America Vascular Biology Organization Junior Investigator Award (2009), the Basil O’Connor Starter Scholar Research Award from the March of Dimes Foundation (2009-2011), the National Scientist Development Award (2008-2012) and Established Investigator Award (2014-2019) both from the American Heart Association, the National Science Foundation CAREER award (2011-2016), the W.W. Smith Charitable Trust Heart award (2014-2017), and the JHU Inaugural President’s Frontier Award (2015). Dr. Gerecht is an elected Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (2016), an elected Member of the National Academy of Medicine (2019), and an elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences (2020) and the National Academy of Inventors (2020). She is the author of more than 150 papers, book chapters, and patents in her field.\n\nDr. Beth Keser is a recognized global leader in the semiconductor packaging industry with over 26 years of experience. Beth earned her B.S. degree in Materials Science and Engineering at Cornell University and her Ph.D. in the same at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Beth’s excellence in developing revolutionary electronic packages for semiconductor devices has resulted in 43 US patents and patents pending and over 50 publications in the semiconductor industry. She has worked at global semiconductor companies such as Motorola, Freescale Semiconductor, Qualcomm, and Intel. Beth led the Fan-Out Wafer Level Packaging (FO-WLP) Technology Development and Product Group at Motorola, Freescale, and then Qualcomm. At Qualcomm, she and her team qualified over 50 FO-WLP and WLP products resulting in over 10 billion units shipped--technology consumers around the world enjoy in mobile phones today. Following that, Beth led Intel's worldwide Packaging & Systems Technology department. Beth is also an IEEE Fellow and IEEE Electronic Packaging Society (EPS) Distinguished Lecturer who chaired the world’s largest electronic packaging conference IEEE EPS’s ECTC in 2015. Beth was the President of the International Microelectronics Assembly and Packaging Society (IMAPS) from 2021-2023. Beth has published two edited volumes: \"Embedded and Fan-Out Wafer and Panel Level Packaging Technologies for Advanced Applications Spaces\" (Wiley, 2021) and \"Advances in Embedded and Fan-Out Wafer Level Packaging Technologies\" (Wiley, 2019).
