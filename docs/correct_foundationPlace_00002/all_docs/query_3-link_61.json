        "text": "IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation (formerly known as Worklight Foundation) is a platform for building mobile applications for the enterprise. It is a suite of tools and services available either on-premise or in the cloud, which enable you to rapidly build, administer, and monitor secure applications.\n\nIBM Mobile Foundation: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNJXP/welcome.html\n\nThe IBM MobileFirst Platform Application Center is a repository of mobile applications similar to public app stores but focused on the needs of an organization or a team (private app store). It works with IBM MobileFirst and non IBM MobileFirst apps, and supports any iOS, Android, BlackBerry 6 or 7, and Windows Phone 8 applications.\n\nIt can be used in different contexts:\n\nAs an enterprise app store across an organization.\n\nDuring development to distribute applications within a team.\n\nDistributing mobile applications with Application Center: https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/6.3/moving-production/distributing-mobile-applications-application-center/\n\nMobileFirst Platform Application Center allows you to host your mobile applications and acts as app repository like any other public app store from Google or Apple. Application center doesn't allow application backend or management capabilities like deploying Adapter etc, for which you would need to use MobileFirst Foundation.\n\nYou can find more details about Application center here"
