        "text": "Pieter Kruithof, Terry Bleizeffer, Tomer Maimoni andYanbin Hao\n\nOur team had a persona problem. Our gallery of personas was widely used by product managers, researchers, and designers, which should have been an indication of success. However, teams were borrowing personas from other areas as-is, rather than creating their own or enhancing the existing personas. The impact was that teams were making assumptions about their customers. The IBM Cloud, Data, and AI Persona Toolkit addresses these challenges by providing three standardized libraries of roles, context, and actions for the team to assemble their own personas. Libraries provide consistency without the all-or-nothing approach of borrowing an entire persona, and allows us to compare personas across the portfolio. The talk includes an overview of how we drove adoption and ongoing efforts."
