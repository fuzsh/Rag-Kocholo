We have a number of initiatives to support the next generation of open source developers and to encourage developers to use open source technology to enact positive change.\n\nCall for Code\n\nOngoing\n\nCall for Code is an initiative that invites developers to help solve the most pressing issues of our time using their code. This year’s Call for Code challenge takes on both climate change and COVID-19, two urgent crises that compromise our health, planet, and survival. Form a team to create open source technology solutions that reduce the impact this pandemic and global warming has on our daily lives and the world.\n\nGet involved Arrow right\n\nOpen Source Community Grant\n\nAwarded quarterly\n\nThe IBM Open Source Community Grant recognizes a nonprofit organization dedicated to education and skill building for women, under-represented minorities, and underserved communities, while also promoting open source. The grant includes a cash award ($25K) and a technology award (valued at $25K) to directly support education and career development activities. Our internal open source community votes on the winners, with Girls Who Code and Outreachy winning the first two awards.\n\nLearn more… Arrow right"
