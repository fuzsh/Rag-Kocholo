        "text": "IBM, the multinational technology giant headquartered in Armonk, New York, is renowned for many of its innovative technology solutions, including AI. One of IBM’s key offerings is Industry Accelerators, a comprehensive set of tools that enable users to analyse data, build models, and display results to tackle common business issues.\n\nIBM is dedicated to developing and promoting trustworthy AI – AI that is transparent, explainable, fair, and secure. The company believes that ethical AI practices are essential for building public trust in AI systems. IBM also advocates for the adoption of industry-wide standards and best practices for AI development and deployment. As part of its ongoing commitment to ethical AI, joining AI Verify international pilot was a natural step for IBM.\n\nBased on IBM’s experience, some areas of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) could benefit from crowd-sourcing international efforts as the sciences for such testing are nascent. In particular, for technical testing of robustness, explainability, and fairness:\n\nAs there is limited support for model types and algorithms, this could be an area of potential contributions from the broader community\n\nHaving more detailed information on the model type, features used, and the algorithm used in AI Verify report for the benefit of a technical audience.\n\nRobustness: While the explanation of robustness was good, the metric was calculated using accuracy. Adding plugins such as CLEVER (Cross-Lipschitz Extreme Value for nEtwork Robustness) to AI Verify could provide additional metrics to measure robustness\n\nExplainability was well implemented with SHAP’s dot plot, force plot, and bar plot for both local and global explanations. However, users looking to investigate the outcome of a particular datapoint would not be able to select specific data points to run the local explanation\n\nIBM’s commitment to trustworthy AI reflects its belief that AI has the potential to transform society in positive ways, but only if it is developed and deployed in a responsible and ethical manner."
