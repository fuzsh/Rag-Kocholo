        "text": "Hereâs what youâll learn from IBMâs strategy study:\n\nHow an accurate diagnosis of your organizationâs most pressing challenge can help you form a coherent strategy to overcome it.\n\nHow developing your strategic instinct to recognize change early and decisively transforming your business rely on unifying your organization towards a single direction.\n\nHow focusing on short-term financial gains is putting your long-term survival and profitability in jeopardy.\n\nIBM stands for International Business Machines Corporation and is a multinational technology corporation with over 100 years of history and multiple inventions that are prevalent today. Its headquarters are in Armonk, New York, but it operates in over 170 countries.\n\nInstitutional investors own over 55% of IBM, while around 30% belongs to mutual funds, and individual investors own less than 1%. Since 2020, IBMâs current Chairman and CEO is Arvind Krishna.\n\nIBMâs market share and key statistics:\n\nTotal assets of $28.999B as of September 30, 2022\n\nRevenue of $57.35B billion in 2021\n\nTotal number of employees in 2022: 345,000\n\nBrand value of $ 96,992B in 2021\n\nMarket Capitalization of over $130B as of December 2022\n\nHumble beginnings: How did IBM start?\n\nIBM was founded in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) in Endicott, New York, United States.\n\nCTR was the product of three and a half amalgamated companies:\n\nThe Tabulating Machine Company\n\nThe International Time Recording Company\n\nThe Computing Scale Company\n\nThe Bundy Manufacturing Company\n\nThe companyâs founding was very well-timed. It coincides with the profound shift of the United Statesâ agricultural economy to an industrial one. At that time, inventions and innovations were introduced at an unprecedented rate, evolving peopleâs way of life and defining our modern lifestyle.\n\nThe companyâs success at these times was due to the wide range of products it offered that were in high demand in industrializing economies from time recording clocks and commercial scales to various mechanical data handling systems, tabulating machines.\n\nBut it was CTRâs corporate culture and managerial practices that enabled it to pioneer and serve that demand.\n\nIBMâs scammy and problematic birth\n\nThe birth of IBM was the result of the vision and leadership of CTR's first president, Charles Ranlett Flint.\n\nFlint was notorious for combining companies, creating monopolies, and having other people manage them while he simply owned stocks. Thatâs what he intended to do with the creation of CTR as well.\n\nHere are the companies that formed what later became IBM:\n\nIn 1900, Flint boughtÂ The Bundy Manufacturing Company, the inventor of the âpunch cardâ that allowed factories to convert working hours into salaries. The company was quite successful due to increased demand from emerging factories and the founderâs acute business skills. Flint merged the company with the International Time Recorder (ITR).\n\nITRÂ was the core of CTR. By the time Flint created CTR, ITR was already a business group and an established player in selling and maintaining time recorders with an international presence. Flint had bought out almost all of his competitors, effectively creating a mini-monopoly.\n\nThe next company that formed CTR was theÂ Computing Scale Company. A marginally profitable company that had created a commercial scale for small merchants like butchers and cheesemakers. It was part of Flintâs vision of mechanical data handling.\n\nThe fourth and last company that formed CTR wasÂ The Tabulating Machine Company. The main product of the company was the punch card tabulating equipment that automated parts of a manual and very labor-intensive process. It sped up âdata entry,â increased accuracy, and reduced costs dramatically. It was Herman Hollerithâs invention, the second founder of CTR.\n\nThe merging of these three and a half companies didnât make âbusiness senseâ at the time, nor was it the result of a careful business strategy.\n\nAt least not in the way we mean it today. It was a technical scheme that would allow Flint to protect his investment even if one of the companies wasnât profitable and he had to sell it. Because, as it turns out, ITR was prosperous, and the tabulating business was slowly growing even though it required huge capital reinvestments. But the computing part of CTR was dying.\n\nAs a result, the child of this amalgamation was overvalued by twice its actual value.\n\nThis inflated value was supported by a loose argument of âeconomies of scaleâ since all these businesses were âmeasuring stuff.â From its very first days:\n\nThe stock was overvalued\n\nThe company was heavily in debt\n\nThere were a lot of internal clashes\n\nThe three businesses had no synergy\n\nThere was little attention to innovation\n\nThe board of directors only cared about profits\n\nThe customer and employee treatment was poor\n\nIn short, IBM was born with some of the worst conditions for any company.\n\nIBMâs coherent business strategy that got it out of the pit\n\nJust three years after its creation, in 1914, the company changed its culture, executive team, and product line.\n\nIn ten years, it went through an astounding business transformation.\n\nThe move that initiated this transformation was the hiring of Thomas J. Watson Sr. as general manager for the company. The previous leader of the company was simply a credibility mark that Flint had implanted to draw investors. Watsonâs influence on the company, however, is so monumental that he is considered the third founder of CTR, who shaped it into IBM.\n\nWatson carried out a series of initiatives that laid the foundation for what would later become Americaâs largest technology company of the previous century:\n\nHe built a mighty salesforce and a training program called âSales Schoolâ that every salesperson had to graduate from.\n\nHe brought clarity of purpose with frequent communication of goals and performance measures.\n\nHe aligned daily actions with measurable targets that were part of the companyâs strategy. He effectively created a culture of execution.\n\nHe created a new line of products in the data-processing industry.\n\nHe implemented initiatives to bring people from the three different divisions close together.\n\nHe improved efficiencies by bringing product developers and manufacturing staff into the same building enabling cross-functional support and information exchange.\n\nHe cultivated a system of shared beliefs and practices that empowered employees to make decisions that were consistent with the companyâs priorities.\n\nHe trained customers on how to use their products, gaining valuable feedback and ideas.\n\nWatson spent half of his career as a valued employee of the National Cash Register Company (NCR), where he learned everything he knew about running a business. When he came to CTR, he brought all of his knowledge with him. It included: the development of the salesforce, budget and personnel practices, and even some executives that worked for his previous employer.\n\nWatson was a highly motivated, optimistic, and conservative man of principle. During his tenure, CTR grew and consistently developed its product lines to cover a wide range of business machinery.\n\nHe took CTR from a scammy amalgamation to a respectable and healthy organization giving it a new name: International Business Machines (IBM).\n\nKey Takeaway #1: Diagnose the challenge and tackle it with a coordinated strategyÂ\n\nWhen Watson became general manager, the company was rotten. However, he was ambitious and driven. His approach transformed the firm and affected the companyâs journey for many generations. It can be summarized into two distinct steps.\n\nWhen faced with a crumbling organization:\n\nDiagnose the most important challenge.\n\nMake an honestÂ swot analysis. Watson found that CTR had a dying division (weakness), a profitable one (strength), and a promising one (opportunity). He based his approach on these findings.\n\nDevise a coherent and executable strategy.\n\nCreate a strategic plan that addresses this challenge and coordinates resources. Watson applied all his expertise to developing a salesforce to seize the opportunity he found while internally reforming the company.\n\nWatson practically transformed IBMâs culture into an improved copy of NCRâs culture. His experience fitted like a glove in IBMâs challenges. Some could argue that he happened to be a hammer who found its nail. Others that he found a nail and shaped himself into a hammer.\n\nWhatever is true, his results were undeniable.\n\nIBMâs Golden Period: the strategy and tactics IBM used to penetrate the computer industry\n\nIBM went through the Great Depression and came out of it stronger, wealthier, and healthier.\n\nIt also went through World War II, which gave the company an explosive push that was hard to maintain once the war ended. IBMâs activities during WWII were plentiful andâ¦ complicated. One thing is certain, among the most important initiatives of Watson was the financial support of every IBMerâs family who went to join the fight and the promise that once the war was over, they would regain their job in the company.\n\nAs a result, once WWII ended, the company had more than 25% increased workforce at its disposal while a huge part of its revenue-generating business vanished nearly overnight: the military contracts.\n\nHereâs how IBM faced these new challenges.\n\nIBMâs corporate strategy against an increased workforce and a vanished revenue stream\n\nWatson recognized the problem from the beginning. His strategy may have been simple, but the flawless execution made all the difference since it wasnât without obstacles.\n\nThe strategy had two key pillars, both focusing on technological advancement:\n\nImprove, marginally, current products whose demand was still high. The strategic objective was to expand sales on those product lines to generate immediate cash and keep the business floating.\n\nInvest in R&D of advanced electronics, a new technology that wasnât fully understood nor ready to be commercialized. This was a necessary bet for the future of IBM.\n\nIt was obvious to Watson that the company should, one way or another, lead or at least ride a new wave of innovation and technological advancement. And that wasnât possible with the companyâs current product lines, internal structure, and culture.\n\nThe technological and business transformation that IBM went through was an undertaking that few high-tech companies have managed to pull off. Especially when so many stakeholdersâ survival is dependent on the companyâs well-being. Shareholders, banks that had provided loans, and employees were all highly incentivized to keep the status quo as is and fight against the transformation. âSince weâre selling, why change?â they thought.\n\nThis kind of resistance is typical when industry-reshaping technology emerges. Kodak went through the same but, unlike IBM, succumbed to stakeholder resistance, retained its status quo, and eventually died.\n\nIBMâs strategic pivot faced a list of major challenges:\n\nThe best minds in advanced electronics were not working at IBM.\n\nAdvanced electronics was a relatively new industry that nobody could really understand or predict what problems it would solve and what use businesses would find in it.\n\nNew and strong players emerged while old rivals were still actively competing. Remington Rand was an old and active foe while researchers were leaving universities to start new companies and develop systems for the U.S. Army like ENIAC. The reason was that the US government was issuing funding programs investing millions in this new technology. Whoever demonstrated enough expertise and promise was winning the funding, conducting research, innovating, and reaping the benefits.\n\nSales resisted the new technology, clinging to its old and tested practices and propositions. In other words, sales and engineering weren't aligned.Â\n\nThe tactics IBM implemented to overcome these challenges and not only survive but also transform as a business in a record time are numerous. Since we canât really know every single one of them, weâll go through some of the most important events and principles that enabled the company to devise the solutions it needed.\n\nHow IBM overcame the challenges of its strategic pivot\n\nThe event that marked IBMâs transformation and sealed its strategic pivot was Watsonâs son, Tom, entering the business.\n\nTom was a bright and ambitious young man who, with the help of his fatherâs influence and a series of chance events, became IBMâs Executive Vice President at the age of 33.\n\nTom understood the emerging new technology, and so he led that part of the business. On the other hand, Watson didnât understand how it worked, so he focused on the more familiar, traditional and still revenue-producing product lines. The two clashed regularly and intensely on many issues. But itâs important to mention that their arguments were never focused on whether IBM needed to transform and adopt advanced electronics. They agreed on that part. They clashed only on the cadence of the transformation and the policies they put in place.\n\nThis distinction is crucial because it reveals that the company wasn't divided at its core, the direction everybody moved was the same. The clash between the old and the new was extremely productive because:\n\nThe company started building critical mass in electronics by reinvesting earnings and rental cash flow. It didnât rely on government funding, but rather it developed its capacity slowly and safely.\n\nIn order to catch up with the industryâs velocity with its bootstrapped approach, IBMâs advanced electronics department had to do things differently. So it cultivated aÂ culture of transparencyÂ andÂ accountabilityÂ where information flowed freely.\n\nTheÂ 604 Electronic Calculating Punch, the world's first mass-produced electronic calculator, was IBMâs first highly profitable product that came out of this approach.\n\nThe firm used its active customer network to understand customer needs and prioritize improvements on the data processing machines. Thus it created machines with validated demand.\n\nThe whole process enabled IBM to create âan infrastructure of knowledgeable customers, salesmen, and servicemen for electronic computers.â\n\nAs soon as the 1950s came, IBM entered the electronic computing market and became a highly competitive player. After that, it changed its strategy, took on larger computer projects, and became more dependent on federal funding to offset the associated risk.\n\nIt continued to accumulate knowledge and expertise, improving its processes and products.\n\nKey Takeaway #2: Develop your strategic instinct and adapt fast\n\nDevelop your ability to recognize change and quickly transform your business to respond to it. To perform a successful business transformation, unite the organization towards a single direction.\n\nIf the need for change is clear at the top, itâs a matter of implementation and policies. Itâs not easy, but itâs far more successful to lead a united organization than a two-headed one. So when you perform a business transformation:\n\nDefine the direction or destination as clearly as possible.\n\nAlign senior leadership with the desired direction.\n\nBuild guiding policies that take you from the old to the new. Donât simply kill the old, transform it.\n\nTreat the transformation as an idea worth spreading. Take advantage of your strengths and apply theÂ Law of Diffusion of Innovations.\n\nThe decline during the last decade and IBMâs enterprise strategy to return to the top\n\nIBM slowly but surely started shifting its business model again in the late half of the past century and the following decades.\n\nThis time, the strategic pivot was more fundamental. The company shifted from âcomponents to infrastructure to business value.â In other words, it shifted from manufacturing computers and new technologies to offering IT consulting and integration services.\n\nThis is reflected in its revenue percentages by segment. In 1980, 90% of IBMâs revenue was generated from hardware sales. By 2015, the company was generating over 60% of its revenue from services and less than 10% from hardware sales.\n\nHowever, the journey wasnât as smooth as in past transformations.\n\nThe challenges of the consulting industry that has left IBM behind in the last decade\n\nThe shift, this time, was taking place less effectively.\n\nThe company was selling fewer and fewer pieces of hardware each year while its revenues from consulting services werenât increasing as fast. The company wasnât investing as much in R&D, and it entered the new era of computing with an extreme focus on financials.\n\nIn 2006 and in 2010, the company's leadership announced âRoadmap 2010â and âRoadmap 2015,â respectively. These were financial goals that were mistakenly used as strategic guiding policies. And to the companyâs detriment, they dictated decision-making on every level.\n\nHere are key facts that indicate this extreme financial focus was a terrible strategy at the worst timing:\n\nIBMâs new CEO, Virginia Marie âGinniâ Rometty, didnât enjoy employee support. Due to her merciless tactics and her relentless focus to please the stakeholders, employee morale, and thus productivity, was at an all-time low.\n\nRevenue was decreasing year over year.\n\nâRebalancing the workforce,â AKA layoffs, became a regular quarterly tactic to make the numbers.\n\nCurrent and ex-IBMers were losing faith and becoming less and less content with leadership.\n\nDespite the lack of growth, stocks continued rising, paying dividends and high Earnings Per Share (EPS). That was the result of âfinancial gimmicksâ like massive stock buybacks or stashing assets and profits outside of the US to avoid taxes.\n\nExtreme focus on cutting back costs. Using overseas âglobal delivery skills,â AKA cheaper workers and even docking 10% of salaries to offer training to employees while charging high-end prices for IBMâs services.\n\nBut you can only cut costs for so much and save that much. There is a limit to how much cost-cutting you can do until you hurt operations and production. And IBM reached that limit well before 2015, the year âRoadmap 2015â was promising $20 EPS.\n\nBy the end of 2014, the company had amassed a huge debt, its hardware profitability had taken a nosedive, its margins had declined, the executive leadership forwent their personal annual incentive payments for 2013, and it abandoned the Roadmap.\n\nTo save the company, leadership had to come up with a radically different strategy. And it did. The 5 âimperativesâ strategy was much more attractive to all the stakeholders and would prove to be much more effective.\n\nIBMâs 5 imperatives and its strategy to recovering its past glory\n\nIBMâs biggest weaknesses in the first one-and-a-half decade of the current century have been financial performance and strategic blunders.\n\nBut if it had no strengths to leverage, then it wouldnât be alive today. And its size is one of them. IBM is huge. For example, as of 2018, the company employed around 378.000 people and commanded one of the largest collections of PhDs in computer science and technology. IBM generates over $50 billion in revenue annually with consistently large profits. In 2017, the company had over $8 billion in cash.\n\nThe âfive imperatives'' were a strategy that focuses on actual performance and not financial engineering to be successful.\n\nThe five imperatives were:\n\nAnalytics\n\nCybersecurity\n\nCloud computing\n\nSocial networking\n\nMobile technologies\n\nThe company made several acquisitions to close the competitive gap in all of those focuses while it shifted resources to support those initiatives. As a result, it surpassed its competition withÂ analytics softwareÂ and its capabilities to manage and analyze massive bodies of data. With a $2 billion acquisition of SoftLayer, it caught up withÂ cloud computingÂ and extended its services to includeÂ cybersecurity.Â A partnership with Apple Computer offered the promise ofÂ portable computing and app developmentÂ platforms lodged in cloud servers. Finally, IBM offered management consulting as much as software services through itsÂ social networkingÂ focus.\n\nIBM's Strategy has focused even more in recent years, integrating the imperatives into two major pillars: hybrid computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nIt puts everything under the umbrella term: Digital Transformation.\n\nIBMâs focus on digital transformation propels it into the future\n\nIBMâs future looks promising, and its strategy is putting it back at the center of computers and technology. In January 2018, the company announced its first quarter of YoY revenue increase since 2012.\n\nIt focuses once again on delivering value to its customers by addressing the crucial challenges that accompany every digital transformation:\n\nManaging the increased complexity of heterogeneous enterprise IT environments.\n\nExtracting valuable insights from available data.\n\nSustaining operational competitiveness against disruptive market changes.\n\nIncreased cyber threats and increasing cost of cybersecurity.\n\nA cohesive end-to-end execution of solutions that address all of these matters.\n\nThe way IBM addresses these challenges and chooses to differentiate itself is by adopting a platform-centric hybrid cloud approach paired with advanced AI capabilities. The infrastructure relies on Linux, containers, and Kubernetes as the architectural foundation.\n\nIn laymanâs terms, the value proposition of the company is the sustainable and accelerating transformation of their clientâs businesses and processes through:\n\nHybrid cloud that develops ability and speed.\n\nTailored and trustworthy data governance respecting privacy and generating data-driven business insights.\n\nAI-driven decision-making that automates enterprise processes.\n\nConsistency, security, and compliance.\n\nThe company is rapidly growing its ecosystem, enhancing client experience while driving value and innovation with its open-source technologies.\n\nKey Takeaway #3: To succeed long term, focus on developing business capabilities instead of financial returns\n\nAmbitious goals and financial promises are not strategies. They might provide some returns in the short term but ultimately set the company up for future failure. Cutting costs is not an infinite-returns-yielding tactic.\n\nWhen the industry changes, new trends and technologies emerge, and your competitive advantage wonât be serving you for much longer:\n\nMake a thorough analysis of the environment. Spot the most promising emerging trends in technology, customer expectations, and markets.\n\nPerform anÂ internal analysisÂ to define your strengths, weaknesses, and current capabilities that power your competitive advantage.\n\nDevelop a strategyÂ that takes advantage of your current capabilities, develops adjacent ones, and mitigates weaknesses to seize the opportunities you spot.\n\nUntil your new strategy is performing and your competitiveness relies on it,Â ensure cash flow and sustainabilityÂ through your current healthy lines of products.\n\nWhy is IBM so successful?\n\nIBMâs success over its long history canât be attributed to a single cause.\n\nIn each distinctive phase, IBM demonstrated the qualities that enabled it to thrive and pioneer in technological advancements. One consistent quality that allowed IBM to stand the test of time has been its decisive adaptability, the ability to spot new trends and transform its business in time to lead change.\n\nIts corporate culture of respect and hard work has been the cornerstone of every single one of its achievements.\n\nGrowth by numbers\n\nYear\n\nÂ {{cta('eed3a6a3-0c12-4c96-9964-ac5329a94a27')}}"
