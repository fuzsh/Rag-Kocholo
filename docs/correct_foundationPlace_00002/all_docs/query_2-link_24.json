        "text": "Thomas J. Watson\n\nRaised in rural upstate New York, Thomas J. Watson Sr. was best known for building IBM from its formation in 1914 until his passing in 1956. Now over a century old, IBM's teams built the American social security system, guided the first human flight to the moon, and re-invented cancer treatment. The Thomas J. Watson Research Center includes twelve labs on six continents and has produced six nobel laureates.\n\nBeyond Technology\n\nTom's work extended beyond technology to education, world affairs and the arts. He was a trustee of Columbia University from 1933 until 1956 and President of the International Chamber of Commerce from 1937-39. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Watson Library is one of the world's most comprehensive art history resources.\n\nUpon Tom's passing, Jeannette, his wife of 43 years, was appointed to IBM's board of directors. She was one of the first women to assume this role in a public company.\n\nThe Foundation\n\nIn 1961, in Tom's honor, Jeannette created the Thomas J. Watson Foundation as a charitable trust. In 1968, their children, Helen (Buckner), Jane (Irwin), and Arthur and Thomas J. Watson, Jr., created the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship to focus the foundation's work. The program's goal was to provide graduating college students with a year to \"explore with thoroughness a particular interest, test their aspirations and abilities, view their lives and American society in greater perspective and, concomitantly, develop a more informed sense of international concern\". Those goals have stayed unchanged for over half a century.\n\nIn 1999, the Jeannette K. Watson Fellowship was created to engage undergraduate students earlier in their college career and for a longer duration, exposing them to the world of work through challenging, cross sector internships and mentorship.\n\nThe two programs resided in different cities -- Providence and New York -- until 2006 when the board united them in New York."
