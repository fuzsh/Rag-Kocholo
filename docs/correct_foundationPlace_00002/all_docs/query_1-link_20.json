        "text": "This essay provides a guide to the voluminous writings on IBM by historians and by others whose work is useful to historians, including IBM employees and management and technology experts. This is a global history and looks at sources in English and in other languages. To do so, it also traces briefly the continuities and discontinuities in IBM's strategy and culture over time, and highlights key events in its history.Footnote 1\n\nTo provide an overview of IBM's experience and its historiography, I discuss the company's history in roughly chronological order–and much of the value of the essay resides in the footnotes. These chronological divisions are essentially those adopted by historians and others writing about IBM, but remain rough at best as no one period ended and a new one emerged in a particular year. This essay divides the company's history into five parts: the early history into the 1930s; the tabulating era; the company's move to becoming a computer company; the era of global dominance, 1960s–1980s; and finally the company's embrace of a new culture in response to crisis. This approach, inevitably, causes continuities from one era to another to be overlooked or be too minimized, while transformations might be overstated. To create some continuities, two overarching themes weave through the entire discussion: one, transformations, consistencies, and countervailing tensions in IBM's behavior over time; and, two, the nature of its legendary “strong” culture, what IBM's CEO in the 1990s, Louis Gerstner, critically called “deeply inbred and ingrown.”Footnote 2\n\nThis essay hopes, also, to bring together the vast literature on IBM that has been created by different disciplines. Historians have been particularly interested in IBM's responses to its relations with governments (especially with that of the United States), with its markets, and with the role of the father-son Watson family that managed IBM from 1914 to 1971.Footnote 3 Economists commented on its dominance in both the tabulating and mainframe markets and the implications for antitrust activities.Footnote 4 There is a large literature on IBM's research and development, and about its technologies, written by both IBM employees and others outside the firm.Footnote 5 Journalists contributed well over half the books published on IBM, often, too, focusing on the role of the two Watsons, or on Herman Hollerith, inventor of punch-card tabulating equipment.Footnote 6 Every time IBM ran into financial difficulties, reporters published books forecasting the demise of the firm.Footnote 7 Professors of managerial practices studying IBM came closest to exploring its culture.Footnote 8 Many employees wrote memoirs, or studies of specific IBM activities and, with no exceptions, placed more emphasis on the role of the firm's culture than historians, economists, or journalists.Footnote 9"
