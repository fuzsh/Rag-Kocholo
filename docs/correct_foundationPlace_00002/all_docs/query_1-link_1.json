        "text": "Mandy Webb\n\nCo-owner\n\nKW Fitness Personal Training\n\nmandy@kwfitnessny.com\n\nMandy Webb has had a career in sales since she was 19. She was the top sales rep for a Multi-Million Dollar Marketing Corporation and is still one of their all time career sales reps, even after leaving the company over 5 years ago. She was promoted to Executive District Manager, where she was responsible for training hundreds of college students and young adults to be successful in sales, with the philosophy that “you don’t have to be a salesperson to make a sale”. She almost didn’t get a job in sales for another company when she left her previous career because 2 mutual acquaintances with the sales manager said Mandy was “too nice” and “not aggressive enough to cold call”, yet when she was hired, she became their top new business rep for the year. This inspired Mandy to begin writing an e-book about being successful at sales without being “salesy”.\n\nMandy is now the co-owner of KW Fitness Personal Training, which has been in business for 5 years and has locations in both Vestal and Fayetteville NY.

Brianna is also a local dance teacher in the Southern Tier, and holds herself to very high standards when it comes to being a role model to our community’s youth. Working as a professional cheerleader/model in NYC from 2012-2017, she experienced a fast-paced, “only look out for yourself” type of lifestyle. Though traveling the world and performing on numerous television shows was what she had always thought was her dream, actually living it out is what drew her back to Binghamton. She felt as though there was a pressure put on performers that allows them to believe that they can only be great if they leave Binghamton. Through her experiences, she made the decision that that is simply untrue. She decided that she was going to begin taking steps to help the community she grew up in thrive, and become a place where people don’t feel they need to leave to be great. She wants to bring the greatness here. Though to some picking up trash around town may seem like it won’t make a big impact, Brianna believes that it’s a way to teach our youth the importance of caring for humanity through kindness, community empowerment, and environmental awareness.\n\nJesan Sorrells\n\nCEO and Founder\n\nHuman Services Consulting and Training (HSCT)\n\n607-239-5571\n\njsorrells@hsconsultingandtraining.com\n\nJesan Sorrells is the CEO and Founder of Human Services Consulting and Training (HSCT) based in Endicott, NY.

I worked at Sears installing appliances in the day, played in a traveling band at night, then worked on Merch Buttons sales from 12am – 4am most nights. I made bulk order custom 1″ pin back buttons for Bands and Companies. After a while of being in business and hiring employees I decided to start offering Tshirts and Stickers to my customers. I outsourced to a company in Atlanta, GA for Tshirts. After a while I began to outsell the sales team in GA. They offered to buy Merch Buttons and move me to Atlanta to become head of sales at Terminus Tees. My first year there I doubled their yearly sales. After trying out Atlanta for a year and a half I decided the south was not for me and I would move back to upstate NY and start Upstate Merch in the fall of 2009. Since then Upstate Merch has had rapid growth each year. We are currently one of the larger apparel printing shops in New York.

She is originally from Brooklyn NY. She graduated the Valedictorian from George Westinghouse High School (Brooklyn, NY) in 1993 and went on to attend SUNY College at Brockport where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Political Science. Upon graduation, she came to Binghamton University to pursue a Masters of Public Administration degree which she completed in 1999. While in the doctoral program, Nicole began to teach several of her own courses in feminism, American government and public administration. In 2005, Nicole accepted an administrative position with the Undergraduate Admissions office at Binghamton University. As an Assistant Director, she soon became the territory manager for the five boroughs of New York City. While Nicole retains a passion for the admissions process, she welcomed the opportunity to serve as Director of the Multicultural Resource Center in 2008, where her charge was to build an inclusive programming agenda for students and a diversity training program for university professionals and staff. While continuing her administrative career, Nicole earned a PhD in Political Science in May of 2011. 2014 was a great year, in that Nicole accepted the position of Associate Chief Diversity Officer with the Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, a promotion at the university. In 2014, Nicole and her husband Jamar Johnson, also an alum of Binghamton, opened a food stand during the summer of 2015. The goal was to see if their product, American southern and soulfood would work in Binghamton, without having the overhead costs of occupying a building. The food stand was a trial run at operating a restaurant. The effort was met with great local response. In June 2015, the couple opened Jrama’s Soulfood Grille & Barbecue Pit on Upper Front in Binghamton. Since then, the couple opened Jrama’s Catering Hall & Event Center in September 2016. Currently, Nicole looks to expand the responsibilities of her division at Binghamton University while supporting the expansion of the Jrama’s brand locally.\n\nJamar Johnson has always had a passion for serving others. While in high school, Jamar’s first job was serving as an usher for the historic Apollo Theatre in Harlem NY. Jamar believes that experience of working with famous people at a young age afforded him great insight into how to not only serve people, but also taught him what great entertainment was all about. He graduated from Rice Academy, an all-male catholic school in NYC. He came to Binghamton to major in Sociology. Jamar began working for the Children’s Home of Wyoming Conference, in 2001. Upon graduation, he would later complete training to become a peace officer in Broome County, NY. Throughout college and after graduation, Jamar was a busy promoter and event planner, working with many local night clubs to plan events. He knew, while a student that he always wanted to go into business for himself. He did this while still working full time at the Children’s Home.\n\nAfter 14 years of service to the Children’s Home, Jamar stepped out on faith and opened a food stand in 2014 in the parking lot of the American Legion, Post #80 in Binghamton. During the summer months, Jamar and his wife would run a street-side restaurant to assess whether southern soulfood would work in a northern NY community. The response was so well received that by the close of the summer season, Jamar and his wife began looking for a permanent home for a full service restaurant.\n\nIn June 2015, Jamar and his wife opened Jrama’s Soulfood Grille & Barbecue Pit on Upper Front St in Binghamton. Since then, the business has won Best Barbecue by the Press & Sun’s Reader’s Choice Awards for 2016 and 2017. Jrama’s has also been named one of the top 13 barbecue restaurants in upstate NY State open all year by UpstateNY.com\n\nIn September 2016, Jamar and his wife opened Jrama’s Catering Hall & Event Center on State Street in Binghamton. The venue caters weddings, funerals and everything in between from comedy shows to engagement parties and corporate events. This allows Jamar to not just provide a great food product but also to host great events.\n\nJamar’s immediate goals for the businesses are to continue to build and expand the brand in providing excellence in food and great events locally. He believes Jrama’s is unique and stands out among other local restaurants and wants the product to become a household name."
