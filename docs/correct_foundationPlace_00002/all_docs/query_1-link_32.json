        "text": "Summary\n\nThe International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), nicknamed Big Blue, is an American multinational technology corporation headquartered in Armonk, New York and is present in over 175 countries. It specializes in computer hardware, middleware, and software, and provides hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. IBM is the largest industrial research organization in the world, with 19 research facilities across a dozen countries, and has held the record for most annual U.S. patents generated by a business for 29 consecutive years from 1993 to 2021.\n\nIBM offers a wide range of technology and consulting services; a broad portfolio of middleware for collaboration, predictive analytics, software development and systems management; and the world’s most advanced servers and supercomputers. Utilizing its business consulting, technology and R&D expertise, IBM helps clients become “smarter” as the planet becomes more digitally interconnected.\n\nAs one of the world's oldest and largest technology companies, IBM has been responsible for several technological innovations, including the automated teller machine (ATM), dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the SQL programming language, and the UPC barcode. The company has made inroads in advanced computer chips, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and data infrastructure. IBM employees and alumni have won various recognitions for their scientific research and inventions, including six Nobel Prizes and six Turing Awards.\n\nWith Watson, the AI platform for business, powered by data, they are building industry-based solutions to real-world problems. For more than seven decades, IBM Research has defined the future of information technology with more than 3,000 researchers in 12 labs located across six continents. The company currently employs over 350,000 people, and its products are used by millions of customers around the world.\n\nIBM is also well known for its corporate culture and its long history of innovation, having invented some of the first computers and produced groundbreaking technology such as the first quantum computer.\n\nIBM is a publicly traded company and one of 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It is among the world's largest employers, with over 297,900 employees worldwide in 2022. Despite its relative decline within the technology sector, IBM remains the seventh largest technology company by revenue, and 49th largest overall, according to the 2022 Fortune 500. It is also consistently ranked among the world's most recognizable, valuable, and admired brands.\n\nHistory\n\nIBM's story begins in the late 19th century when pivotal technologies like the computing scale and the dial recorder emerged. In 1911, four companies united under CTR's banner, creating the foundation for IBM. Thomas J. Watson, Sr., who later became the company's iconic leader, joined in 1914. Under Watson's guidance, IBM adopted pioneering business practices, expanded its reach across continents, and, in 1924, rebranded as \"International Business Machines\" (IBM). By 1933, most subsidiaries had merged into a single entity, setting the stage for IBM's global presence.\n\nIBM's innovation journey continued with the development of the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator during World War II. In 1952, it introduced the IBM 701, its first commercial stored-program computer. The game-changing IBM 305 RAMAC, introduced in 1956, marked the birth of hard disk drives. The late 1950s saw IBM shift to transistorized designs with the 7000 and 1400 series, setting the stage for the digital era.\n\nIn 1956, IBM demonstrated one of the first examples of artificial intelligence when it programmed an IBM 704 to \"learn\" from its own experience. The birth of the FORTRAN scientific programming language in 1957 and the successful Selectric typewriter in 1961 further cemented IBM's reputation as an industry leader.\n\nIBM's golden era commenced with the launch of the IBM System/360 in 1964, a pioneering computer system family that offered scalability and compatibility. The subsequent IBM System/370 in 1970 solidified IBM's dominance in the mainframe computing arena. The company's market share and influence were unparalleled, driven by its hardware and software solutions, including OS/VS1, MVS, and the CICS transaction processing monitor.\n\nIBM's innovation extended to everyday life as well, with the invention of the magnetic stripe card in 1969 and the Universal Product Code (UPC) in 1974, both of which revolutionized industries.\n\nThe 1990s saw IBM venture into acquisitions, including the purchase of PwC Consulting in 2002 and the sale of its personal computer business to Lenovo in 2005. In 2009, IBM acquired SPSS Inc. and gained recognition for its AI program, Watson, which triumphed on Jeopardy!\n\nIBM celebrated its centenary in 2011, and in the same year, it acquired Kenexa, Texas Memory Systems, and SoftLayer Technologies. The company also designed a video surveillance system for Davao City.\n\nIBM continued its transformation with the sale of its x86 server division to Lenovo in 2014. The company then entered into significant partnerships with tech giants like Apple, Twitter, Facebook, and Tencent. In 2015, IBM acquired Merge Healthcare, Cleversafe, and digital assets from The Weather Company.\n\nThe company's employees even made history by creating the first molecule movie, \"A Boy and His Atom.\" In 2016, IBM acquired Ustream and formed a cloud video unit.\n\nIBM's resilience and adaptability remained evident when it announced the divestment of its Managed Infrastructure Services unit in 2020. The move demonstrated IBM's commitment to evolving with the industry's changing landscape.\n\nIn March 2022, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna took a stance by suspending all business in Russia, emphasizing the company's values and global impact.\n\nMission\n\nIBM's mission is to lead in the creation, development, and manufacture of the industry's most advanced information technologies, including computer systems, software, networking systems, storage devices, and microelectronics. The company strives to translate its advanced technologies into value for its customers through professional solutions, services, and consulting businesses worldwide. IBM is dedicated to helping clients innovate and succeed by delivering sustainable, trusted, and secure solutions that address their most critical challenges and opportunities in today's rapidly evolving digital world.\n\nAt the core of IBM's mission is a commitment to harnessing the power of technology and innovation to improve businesses, industries, and society as a whole. IBM aims to push the boundaries of what's possible by advancing cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and cloud computing, all while maintaining a strong focus on ethical and responsible business practices.
