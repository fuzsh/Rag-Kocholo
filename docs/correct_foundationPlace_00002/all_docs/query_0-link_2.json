        "text": "The possibility of developing apartments in buildings that were once part of IBM's sprawling complex in Endicott has been discussed by the current owners of the property.\n\nVillage Mayor Nick Burlingame said the idea of a residential component to what is now the Huron Campus has \"been talked about\" as a potential future use for a section of the site.\n\nThe IBM \"Clock Tower\" building and the company's former cafeteria on North Street have been considered for such a project.\n\nBurlingame told WNBF News on Thursday that he's had \"broad conversations\" with officials of Phoenix Investors, a group that acquired the Huron site in 2021.\n\nThe mayor said \"these sites are not zoned\" for residential projects now. He said they likely would need to be rezoned to a \"planned unit development\" designation for such a use in the future.\n\nCoincidentally, Burlingame was in the Clock Tower building as he spoke during the live radio interview. He described it as \"a gorgeous building\" that's \"underutilized.\"\n\nWhile the outside of the structure looks nice, the mayor said \"it's equally as beautiful on the inside\" with design elements \"that are absolutely incredible.\"\n\nBurlingame said \"I think a housing project here would make sense\" although he would want the historic elements retained \"for generations to come.\"\n\nChris Pelto - who oversees the Huron Campus for Phoenix Investors - acknowledged there have been some general conversations about the possibility of a residential project for the two buildings on the south side of North Street. But he added nothing is currently in the works.\n\nPelto said the former cafeteria building has been considered for light manufacturing or other potential uses.\n\nThe buildings are located across the street from the \"Old Building Group\" - five unused IBM structures slated for demolition to create a shovel-ready site for future development."
