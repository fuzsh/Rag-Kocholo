        "text": "Faith No More are to reissue their 1985 debut album ‘We Care A Lot’ on August 19, 20 years after it was deleted.\n\nThe album has been expanded with a series of demos and live recordings. The original 10-song album has been remastered by Maor Applebaum.\n\nThe demos of ‘Greed’, ‘Mark Bowen’, ‘Intro’ and ‘Arabian Disco’ are taken from the band’s original eight-track demos, while live versions of ‘New Beginnings’ and ‘The Jungle’ are taken from a 1986 show in San Francisco. There are also new 2016 remixes of ‘We Care A Lot’, ‘Pills For Breakfast’ and ‘As The Worm Turns’ by Matt Wallace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reissue will be released on Faith No More bassist Bill Gould’s record label, Koolarrow. It’s rounded out by sleevenotes from keyboardist Roddy Bottum and will be available on CD, vinyl and download.\n\nGould said: “This was an album that started as a demo, before any label had any interest in us. There were a couple of reasons we decided to release this now: first of all, it’s been 20 years since it has been commercially available. Secondly, when cleaning out my basement, I discovered the original master reels, and we all thought that resurrecting this from the original tapes would be a great way to reintroduce ‘We Care A Lot’ into the world. Lastly, this has been a band effort; we are releasing this in the same way as we recorded it, deciding everything amongst ourselves and getting our hands deep into the nuts and bolts… just like we used to.”\n\nSince reforming in 2009, Faith No More have released one album, ‘Sol Invictus’, in 2015."
