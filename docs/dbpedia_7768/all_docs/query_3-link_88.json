        "text": "We hope you saved up your sick days. Why? Because we wouldn't want an early bedtime to prevent you from hanging with Professor Murder, seeing the Meat Puppets rock, or asking Sex With An Angel exactly where their name came from. On that last one, we're going to guess it came from the same muse that delivered the unprintable band name Holy (Bleep). But you'll have to ask them yourselves.\n\nStarting Tuesday, the annual College Music Journal Marathon launches into its booming, bragging, bawling four days of college rock and industry incest. The publication, which covers the spectrum of college music and radio each week, plays host to panel discussions, record label showcases and, most importantly, late-running parties and rock shows throughout the city's clubs every fall. But remember, you don't have to be struggling through Philosophy 203 to enjoy this music binge; as always, there's something for everyone.Take Imperial Teen, for instance. Led by ex-Faith No More keyboardist Roddy Bottum, this Mere Records band, who with about three shows a day may be playing more at CMJ than anyone, might impress parents as much as kids. The band's August release, \"The Hair the TV the Baby and the Band,\" boasts some excellent guitar-driven power pop that bridges the gap between the sound of Phil Spector and The New Pornographers, and keeps consistent Imperial Teen's catchy sound, even though they've been on a five-year hiatus.\n\nWe've given you our own top picks for next week's shows and posted the whole schedule online for your pleasure, whether you want to buy a pricey all-access pass for several Benjamins, just pay your way to a couple of shows, or sneak in. But we also just spoke with Bottum, and the veteran San Francisco musician had plenty to say.\n\nQ. Band members have had babies, and you've been writing scores for everything from movies (2005's \"Adam and Steve\") to television, and I know the title of the album is an explanation of why it's been so long since the last record, but was it weird getting back together, or different in any way?\n\nA. Not so much. The only thing that's prevented us from getting together was geographical or scheduling stuff. When we can get in a room together and just write songs, it's fine -- we just do like we always do. We just go to this place and it happens. It was all casual and free flowing and easy going.\n\nQ. Very nice. That kind of fits your sound: \"Casual, free flowing, easy going.\"\n\nA. I guess it's a West Coast vibe. That to me sounds really West Coast, you know, like The Beach Boys (adopts a surfer's drawl), free flowin', easy goin'.\n\nQ. Just lettin' it wash over, man.\n\nA. Yeah, waves are lappin' over the sand.\n\nQ. I'm sure people are looking forward to you guys bringing that free flowin' feeling to New York for CMJ.\n\nA. Yeah, but the schedule for CMJ is crazy. I think we're playing 10 shows in four days or something. You've got to get as much bang for your buck as you can. With our schedules and stuff, like Lynn (Imperial Teen's drummer Lynn Truell) just had a baby two months ago, we can only go away for a few days at a time. She's bringing the family to New York, so we're doing as much as we can.\n\nQ. Sort of the opposite of throwing the baby out with the bath water.\n\nA. Yeah. She's keeping the baby.\n\nQ. When you were in Faith No More, you came out as gay. At the time, it was perceived as a kind of brave thing to do, since you were playing hard rock -- a kind of music that wasn't necessarily associated with people who were gay. I was wondering who or what inspired you to come out?\n\nA. I think it was just sort of that declaration, and coming out in that time, specifically in the '90s, when there was that borderline misogynistic weird boy rock band thing, I think it was a really nice time to make that statement. It is definitely a stereotype that \"Oh yeah, straight guys like hard rock,\" so it was refreshing to throw it into the mix. Especially since everybody in Faith No More was so different from each other, and me coming out and saying I was gay just accentuated that. Mostly it was just a cultural thing. In that era, it was still a weird thing for people or public figures to say, so it was a nice thing to do.\n\nQ. What is a must-bring item you're taking with you on these short touring jaunts.\n\nA. Lynn brings a breast pump at this point. Kind of a big deal is what we wear on stage, so we try and get our ducks in a row on that, we pretty much coordinate together.\n\nQ. Any hints on your planned outfits for coming to the city?\n\nA. Good 'n' Plenty's been real popular this time around, and we just played Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco, this huge leather fair, and Good 'n' Plenty was the theme, so I think we'll work that into New York.\n\nContact AWE music writer Ben Johnson at bjohnson@siadvance.com.\n\nCMJ MARATHON\n\nOur daily CMJ picks, from no-names to big fame\n\nTUESDAY\n\nTall Firs, with Effi Briest, Dragons of Zynth and Celebration, Union Pool, 484 Union Ave., Brooklyn. 7 p.m., $10, 718-609-0484, mccarrenpark.com.
