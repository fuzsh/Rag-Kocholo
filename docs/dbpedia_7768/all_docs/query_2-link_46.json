        "text": "[Cover photo of Man on Man]\n\nDen of Wax, the newly launched online record store and boutique record label, which is also a soon-to-open brick-and-mortar retail storefront in Ossining, NY, has announced Den of Wax’s First Fest, a day-long benefit music event taking place on the grounds of the Bethany Arts Community in Ossining on Saturday, August 19th, 2023.\n\nThe event, which is free to attend, with a suggested donation of $20.00 to The Loft LGBTQ+ Center, features a lineup of queer-affirming musicians, an assortment of food trucks, drinks, raffles and more.\n\nMatt Friedman, co-owner, Den of Wax says:\n\nI’ve had a lifelong passion for connecting people via music, so this event came about naturally as a way to help cultivate the Westchester music scene and gather the community.\n\nI’m excited to introduce Den of Wax as the new family on the block by bringing together all of these great musicians – including long-time favorites, idols and personal friends – while raising awareness and funds for such an important cause. I want this annual event to celebrate music, embrace culture, and create a welcoming environment for every person to enjoy an incredible musical experience. This is at the core of what we want to achieve with Den of Wax.\n\nDen of Wax has engaged a range of local businesses and organizations that are providing everything from promotion to sound equipment. Partners include The Capitol Theatre (the largest performance venue in Westchester County), Captain Lawrence Brewing Co., the county’s biggest brewery, The Koop Studio, School of Rock Briarcliff Manor, River Towns Music Group, and others.\n\nThe Lineup:\n\nThe Iron Roses (Joyful punk for inclusive revolutionaries)\n\nMAN ON MAN (Unabashed queer rock band comprised of Roddy Bottum (Faith No More, Imperial Teen, Crickets) and Joey Holman (Holman))\n\nRid of Me (Melodic noise punk from Philly)\n\nJose Prieto of MakeWar (Solo acoustic set from frontman of NYC punk outfit signed to Fat Wreck Chords)\n\nChris Conde (Subversive queer rapper out of Brooklyn, NY)\n\nAll My Friends (Ossining, NY punks combining elements of throwback NYC punk with a touch of ‘90s alterna rock)\n\nFor Lack Of A Term (Alt-Punks from Yonkers, NY)\n\nThe Bump (Horrorfolk/Metalcoustic)"
