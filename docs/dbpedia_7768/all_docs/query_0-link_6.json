        "text": "Imperial Teen’s new album “Feel the Sound” is like that friend you have that gets along with everyone.\n\nIt’s an utterly likeable album of simple but well-crafted pop songs with great melodies. I listened to it twice within 24 hours and my favorites are “Don’t Know How You Do It” and “Out from Inside”. Undeniable catchiness.\n\nStream “Out from Inside”:\n\nPerformed by a (insert any name) mainstream rock band and stripped of some of it’s quirk, I think “Out from Inside” could be a monster pop radio hit. But that will never happen and it’s ok, cause I like it just the way it is.\n\nImperial Teen has been making music since the mid-90’s but this is their first release in 5 years. The San Francisco-based band, now signed to Merge Records, is made up of Roddy Bottum (Faith No More), Will Schwartz, Lynn Truell, and Jone Stebbins.\n\nRevisit their most well-known song from the 90’s below and celebrate their return with “Feel the Sound”, out today.\n\nRR"
