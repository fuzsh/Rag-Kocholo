        "text": "Gracie Abrams – Good Riddance 2xLP (Interscope)\n\nGracie Abrams's debut album Good Riddance, produced and co-written by her frequent collaborator Aaron Dessner of The National, finds Abrams documenting her emotional experience with more precision and impact than ever before. As she narrates the end of a fractured relationship and all the confusion, frustration, and longing that come with it, the 23-year-old artist achieves a new level of lyrical honesty and self-possession - an element fully reflected in her quietly captivating vocal work. [Indie store exclusive clear vinyl.]\n\nGacha Bakradze - Pancakes LP (Lapsus Records)\n\nThe Georgian producer's third album for Lapsus represents a contextual reworking of his music while maintaining the essence of his previous work. Pancakes provides the typically melancholic yet vibrant genetics already recognizable in his music, but also embraces new genres, including his unique and personal take on hyper-pop and trance. It is an album of contrasting elements, where bucolic interludes make way for heavier tracks that are more suited to a club environment, an aural universe that hybridizes IDM, electro, bass music and cutting-edge techno, and once again demonstrates that trying to pigeonhole Gacha Bakradze's sound is a somewhat fruitless task.\n\nBonny Doon – Let There Be Music CD/LP+MP3 (ANTI-)\n\nIn a world of urgency, there's little regard for the spiritual, emotional, or physical well-being of musicians. The creative process, often hidden from the listeners, remains a mystery, though we may pick up clues in the songs themselves. Throughout the ten tracks in their new album Let There Be Music, you can hear the spaciousness Bonny Doon allowed themselves since their 2018 sleeper cult-classic Longwave. Their latest musical journey is one that has big payoffs for devoted followers and undeniable rewards for anyone just stumbling across the band for the first time. The album serves as less of one conceptual story, and each song as their own individual offerings of putting words to the ordinary experience of being alive. The band is at their most dynamic and the songwriting deftly explores new terrain. Let There Be Music is brimming with small truths - both profound and mundane, comforting, and difficult - and we are invited to revel in them all.\n\nBoris & Uniform – Bright New Disease LP+MP3 (Sacred Bones)\n\nRed color vinyl pressing. Boris and Uniform might have seemed like a strange pairing when they teamed up for a US tour back in 2019. Sure, both bands harness the power of big, blown-out riffs, but Boris's rock heroics, lysergic sprawl, and monolithic sludge summon a different energy than Uniform's mechanized bombardments and frenzied assaults. However, when Boris invited Uniform to team up on a reimagined version of their classic \"Akuma No Uta\" as a part of their encore, there was an obvious chemistry between the artists. The idea of a collaborative album came up, and the bands spent the next year swapping song ideas and recordings from their homebase studios until Boris and Uniform had an album that captured the fearless exploration and unbridled power of their live performances.\n\nCreeping Death – Boundless Domain CD/LP (MNRK Music)\n\nTexas death metal crew Creeping Death repeatedly deliver a relentless bludgeoning summoned from the furthest reaches of the genre's past, present, and future. A triumphant celebration of the style itself, the Lone Star State five-piece whips up gruesome riffage and Southern grooves with an improbable cathartic glee.\n\nDeer Tick – Emotional Contracts CD/LP (ATO)\n\nEmotional Contracts, Deer Tick's latest full-length album, explores the existential challenges that arise with the passage of time, infusing each song with the band's trademark untamed spirit, honed over nearly two decades. Prior to collaborating with producer Dave Fridmann (The Flaming Lips, Spoon, Sleater-Kinney), the Providence-based quartet spent months crafting demos in a persistently flooded warehouse in their hometown, braving a broken heating system and gaping roof holes to shape the album's 10 passionately eloquent tracks. Emotional Contracts embodies the spirited energy of its creation, offering a poignant yet invigorating portrayal of aging gracefully without losing one's essence. With guest appearances by Steve Berlin (Los Lobos), Courtney Marie Andrews, Vanessa Carlton, Kam Franklin, Angela Miller and Sheree Smith, the album adds an even greater vitality to their feverish collection of timeless rock 'n' roll. [Indie store exclusive red w/ black vinyl.]\n\nMac DeMarco – Five Easy Hot Dogs LP (Mac’s Record Label)\n\nReleased early this year on CD – now available on vinyl. Mac DeMarco's new instrumental collection Five Easy Hot Dogs was created while traveling across North America, with each song named after the city in which it was recorded. The track list is sequenced in the chronological order in which the songs were produced. DeMarco set out on his journey to make Five Easy Hot Dogs in January 2022 with the plan to stay and record in motels, hotels, or people's houses. \"The nature of ripping around and recording and traveling in this manner doesn't lend well to sitting around and planning or thinking about what it was that I was setting out to do,\" DeMarco said. \"I didn't ever have a sound in mind, or a theme or anything, I would just start recording. Luckily the collection of recordings from this period all shake hands, they have a present musical identity as a whole. I was in it while I was in it, and this is what came out of it, just the way it was.\" Five Easy Hot Dogs follows-up 2019's Here Comes The Cowboy.\n\nDirty Heads – Midnight Control LP (Better Noise Music)\n\nColor vinyl pressing. After digital release in August of 2022, fans will finally be able to get their hands on Midnight Control on vinyl. This single disc includes the 10 tracks from the digital album plus the new single \"Rescue Me\" (released 2/24/23), not included on the digital album.\n\nDjango Django – Off Planet CD/2xLP (Because Music)\n\nEntitled Off Planet, the fifth studio release from Django Django is a 21-track album split into four parts. Originally destined to be four experimental EPs but immediately transformed into a proper album when they started the recording session, Off Planet features some of the most exciting and dynamic music Django Django has ever produced. Harking back to their more experimental and electronic roots, the album also features guests such as Self Esteem, Jack Penate and others. [Indie store exclusive white vinyl.]\n\nFred Again/Brian Eno – Secret Life CD/LP (Text)\n\nSurprise release from Fred Again and Eno. Produced by Brian Eno and Fred Gibson 4th April 2020 - 23rd December 2022, mastered by Kieran Hebden, lacquer cut by Bernie Grundman.\n\nGov’t Mule – Peace…Like A River CD/CD+CDEP/2xLP (Fantasy)\n\nPeace...Like A River is renowned Grammy-nominated band Gov't Mule's twelfth studio album and follow-up to their chart-topping, Grammy-nominated blues release, Heavy Load Blues. The 12-song rock collection also features guest appearances from Billy Bob Thornton, Celisse, and Billy F Gibbons. The tracks on Peace...Like A River explore the many sides of Gov't Mule and bring together all the qualities that have earned the four-piece the beloved stature they enjoy today. Concise songcraft coexists seamlessly with the band's trademark instrumental journeys. Songs longer than pop convention are somehow still compact: they're explorative but never meandering; the tunes are at once both wide-ranging and tightly focused. [A limited-edition indie store exclusive orange w/ red pressing and a deluxe double-CD version adds the bonus Time Of The Signs EP.]\n\nHand Habits – Sugar The Bruise CD/LP (Fat Possum)\n\nIn Sugar The Bruise, grief folds in on itself and becomes laughter; language fades away into sonic expanses of the inexpressible; melodies melt into cacophonies; love songs surrender to loss; historic violence is supplanted by the disks of sunlight. [Limited edition milky white vinyl.]\n\nChris Janson – The Outlaw Side Of Me CD (BMLG)\n\nMultiplatinum-selling artist Chris Janson is known for his unabashed and raucous style both as a songwriter and performer. His free-spirited approach has captivated country music's newest generation and his latest album, The Outlaw Side Of Me, is turning up the heat. Each track on the album was carefully selected to showcase who Janson is as a man and performer - from the reflective sentimental like \"All I Need Is You\" to the barn burner \"Tap That\", this album is a tapestry of Chris Janson. [Neon orange color vinyl due Aug. 11]\n\nBettye Lavette – Lavette! CD (MRI Entertainment)\n\nLaVette! hits all the marks. Together with Jay-Vee Records, Bettye has the freedom to explore new territory. Produced by Steve Jordan, LaVette! features 11 songs written by Georgia-born musician Randall Bramblett, who has been releasing solo albums since 1975. “Randall is the best writer that I have heard in the last 30 years,” says Bettye. “He writes songs that are little soliloquies, they’re like little stories about a moment, or a thing.” Bettye is backed by Jordan on drums, Pino Palladino on bass, Larry Campbell on guitar, Leon Pendarvis on keyboards, and Chris Bruce on guitar. Guest artists include John Mayer, Jon Batiste, Anthony Hamilton, Steve Winwood, Ray Parker Jr., Rev. Charles Hodges, James Carter and Pedrito Martinez, to name a few. Even if you didn’t know the sharp twists and turns of Bettye LaVette’s story, or for that matter, her wide-ranging influences—you can hear the traces of all of it in her voice.\n\nLess Bells – The Drowned Ground LP (Meadows Heavy)\n\nThe Drowned Ground is the third release from Mojave duo Less Bells. Following their beautiful and haunting LP Mourning Jewelry on Kranky Records, they invite the listener on a tour of deep time, windy mountain villages, secret caverns, and Victorian parlors. The viola takes a prominent spot in the album as a melody instrument, in addition to the usual violin and cello arrangements from Carpenter and the synth work by Luscombe on Buchla, Moog modular, and Prophet 5.\n\nJenny Lewis - Joy'All *signed* green vinyl LP/CD/Yellow Cassette (Blue Note/Capitol Records)\n\nNow signed copies are available for mail order! Jenny Lewis' graciously signed some copies of her fab new album Joy'all for Grimey's and we're now making a limited number available for purchase for mail order. Limited to two per format, per person, autographed copies of the indie exclusive limited edition neon green color vinyl, CD, and yellow cassette are now available in our webstore.\n\nMan On Man – Provincetown CD/LP+MP3 (Polyvinyl)\n\nMan On Man (M.O.M.), the musical project started by boyfriends Joey Holman (Holman) and Roddy Bottum (Faith No More, Imperial Teen, Crickets, Nastie Band), is infused with indie-rock distortion and soaked in gay pop confidence while still maintaining an acerbic and pure sense of humor. Man On Man's music has a timeless appeal, transcending genre, and decade. The duo's music celebrates the love they have for each other while championing the queer scenes they surround themselves with. [Limited-edition baby blue vinyl.]\n\nAndrew McMahon In The Wilderness – Tilt At The Wind No More LP (Nettwerk)\n\n180gm neon yellow color vinyl pressing. Accomplished singer-songwriter Andrew McMahon continues his solo work for his project Andrew McMahon In The Wilderness with the introspective album Tilt At The Wind No More, teaming up with trusted collaborators and producers Tommy English (K. Flay, X Ambassadors) & Jeremy Hatcher (Harry Styles, Shawn Mendes) on the album. The 11-song record represents a reflection of everything Andrew has learned during his music career and throughout his life so far. Though it is steeped in nostalgia and optimism for the future, above all else, Andrew wanted to make Tilt At The Wind No More sound \"transportive.\"\n\nJohn Mellencamp – Orpheus Descending CD (Republic)\n\nWith a career spanning over 40 years, musician, artist and activist John Mellencamp releases his 25th full-length studio album Orpheus Descending. It was recorded at his own Belmont Mall Studio and produced by Mellencamp. The album is one of the most personal to date for the outspoken artist as he continues to show that he's one of the best songwriters of his generation, focusing on social issues with standout songs \"Hey God\" and \"The Eyes of Portland\". [Vinyl version due July 21.]\n\nMethods Body - Plural Not Possessive LP (Beacon Sound)\n\nMethods Body's groundbreaking second record, Plural Not Possessive, is an opus against the algorithm -- ranging from 22 seconds to 15 minutes in duration, these five tracks reveal lush ecosystems woven out of the duo's spontaneous compositions. John Niekrasz (drums, voice) and Luke Wyland (keys, electronics, voice) create musical and technological strategies that force them to break old habits and patterns. Extrinsic song forms and standardized meters fall away. Time becomes a physical substance sculpted to alter the listener's emotional experience. Plural Not Possessive stands as a bracing evolution of the ensemble's previous work, but fans will still recognize Methods Body's hallmark microtonality, uncanny rhythms, world-building intricacy, and unmistakable collaborative chemistry. RIYL: Terry Riley, Autechre, Aphex Twin, Wendy Carlos, Pauline Oliveros.\n\nAnthony Naples - orbs LP (ANS Recordings)\n\nAnthony Naples's fifth full-length LP, orbs, is a moody portal of shoegazed and slo-mo songs suspended in thin air. The album doesn't reassemble the AN sound from the ground up, so much as enhance and expand its scope in all directions. Breaking away from the 'outsider house' associations of his earlier work, samples and instruments meld together into new languorous and liquid forms that, with or without the beat of drums, shift with the gentle movements of time.\n\nMeshell Ndegeocello – The Omnichord Real Book CD/2xLP (Blue Note)\n\nAcclaimed Grammy-winning multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter Meshell Ndegeocello makes her Blue Note Records debut with The Omnichord Real Book, a visionary, expansive, and deeply jazz-influenced album that marks the start of a new chapter in her career. Following her 2018 album Ventriloquism, Meshell returns with an album of new original material that taps into a broad spectrum of her musical roots. The Omnichord Real Book was produced by Josh Johnson and features a wide range of guest artists including Jason Moran, Ambrose Akinmusire, Joel Ross, Jeff Parker, Brandee Younger, Julius Rodriguez, Mark Guiliana, Cory Henry, Joan As Police Woman, Thandiswa, and others.\n\nMaisie Peters – The Good Witch LP (300 Entertainment)\n\nThe Good Witch is the official follow-up to Masie Peters’ No. 2 BRIT Breakthrough certified debut, You Signed Up For This, and in many ways the older, wiser and scorned counterpart. Written during her whirlwind 2022 touring schedule, The Good Witch serves as a time capsule for Maisie, enabling her to chronicle a period in which she was searching for balance between career highs and personal lows. Where You Signed Up For This was an observational, coming-of-age record, The Good Witch finds Maisie at her most introspective and self-reflective, drawing inspiration from the works of Joan Didion, J. M. Barrie, Greek mythology and Western movies; the record explores the complexities of romantic breakups, the preciousness of friendship and true value of self-worth. [Indie store exclusive white vinyl.]\n\nPickle Darling – Laundromat LP (Father/Daughter)\n\nBlue color vinyl pressing. In her 2009 short story collection, writer Lydia Davis creates worlds in tiny spaces, some totaling only two sentences. Steering away from the rigidity of what a piece of art is meant to look like, Christchurch, New Zealand-based artist Lukas Mayo (they/them) took inspiration from Davis, and others, to find the magic in the mundane. Art is everywhere: in the shape we make out of a napkin while waiting for our coffee to arrive, in the text we send to a friend in need, in the beat we make on the steering wheel while stuck at a red light. As Pickle Darling, Mayo points past perfectionism, and leans into the art of the everyday, where these ever-evolving forms of creativity find their home in new album Laundromat.\n\nQueens Of The Stone Age – In Times New Roman… CD/2xLP+MP3 (Matador)\n\nIn Times New Roman..., the eighth studio album from Queens Of The Stone Age is raw, brutal and rough around the edges but with a refinement that reveals itself further with each successive listen – and QOTSA founder Joshua Homme's lyrics are as witty and withering as ever. The results are instantly identifiable; QOTSA's sonic signature, expanded and embellished with new and unprecedented twists in virtually every song, a live in-a-room recording that showcases a band at the height of their creative powers. In Times New Roman... is a party for the obscene and the clean, the outcasts and the weirdos, and anyone and everyone in between. One of the most important bands in recent rock history is back but it's no exaggeration to call this album a devastating rebirth. [Four different vinyl colorways are available: red, green, blue, and silver.]\n\nRoyal Thunder – Rebuilding The Mountain LP (Spinefarm)\n\nThe Atlanta-based rock trio of Mlny Parsonz (vocals, guitar), Josh Weaver (bass), and Evan Diprima (drums) delivers a powerful build of darting, bluesy riffs and booming, soulful fifth album that encapsulates their visceral and spirited sound. [Limited edition gold vinyl.]\n\nYeat – AftërLyfe 2xLP (Geffen)\n\nRap phenomenon Yeat returns with AftërLyfe, the explosive follow-up to 2022's acclaimed project Lyfë. Spearheaded by \"Shmunk\", an undeniable collaboration with YoungBoy Never Broke Again, the 22-track project picks up where Yeat's previous project Lyfë left off, expanding on his talent, and reaching towards an even more experimental sound. Available on translucent black ice color vinyl.\n\nYours Are The Only Ears – We Know The Sky LP (Lame-O)\n\nColor vinyl pressing. As Yours Are The Only Ears, Susannah Cutler is reaching for a fresh start. For years, the singer-songwriter sauntered through her every day, stretching to please the people in her life and disconnecting as a means of survival. It wasn't until early 2020 after taking on the tasks set out in The Artist's Way, that Cutler experienced a reckoning. When was the last time she was truly honest with herself? And what is she so afraid of? Piercing through the gauze of an almost simulated existence, Cutler pieced together a face she could finally recognize in the mirror and began crafting what would become her second album, We Know The Sky. Here, her shadow no longer lags, but instead immerses itself to flourish into a beautifully complicated, truthful reality.\n\nYusuf/Cat Stevens – King Of A Land CD/LP (BMG)\n\nKing Of A Land is an epic body of work. More than a decade in the making, its 12 new songs are full of extraordinary surprises. Unique and transportive, Yusuf's music, words and melodies paint a vivid picture of a world which embraces the lost lands of truisms and stainless youth, and brings it into touching distance. His poetical storytelling invites the listener on a journey towards the gates of an alternative universe to that which we presently inhabit - where happy endings can possibly happen. [This title shipped late and will arrive next week. Limited-edition translucent green color vinyl.]\n\nAselefech Ashine – Beauties LP (Mississippi)\n\nDizzying close harmonies and indestructible grooves on this lost classic from Ethiopia's Golden Age. Aselefech Ashine and Getenesh Kebret, two young women raised in the bustling cosmopolitan milieu of late-empire Addis Ababa, released one single and a full-length LP in 1976 before disappearing from the music business entirely. Originally released on Kaifa, the label responsible for some of the heaviest and funkiest Ethiopian records of all time, Beauties was a hit, selling out in a few days. But it came out at the beginning of two decades of darkness and oppression in Ethiopia, and this is the first full reissue of this overlooked classic.\n\nBailey’s Nervous Kats – The Nervous Kats [Reissue/1965] LP (Numero)\n\nIsolated at the rural fringe of Northern California, Bailey's Nervous Kats took Shasta County by storm in the early '60s. Combining surf, rock 'n' roll, exotica, and R&B, the Kats were a teenage dream draped in Magnatone amplifiers and crisp white polo tees. Their self-titled - and only - LP came at the dead end of the band's run, issued on Orville Simmons' one-shot Emma imprint in 1965. The mid-century modern LP of your dreams. [Limited-edition ‘northwind splatter’ vinyl.]\n\nBright Eyes – Noise Floor (Rarities: 1998-2005) [Reissue/2006] CD/2xLP (Dead Oceans)\n\nBright Eyes – Noise Floor: A Companion 12” (Dead Oceans)\n\nBright Eyes – Cassadaga [Reissue/2007] CD/2xLP (Dead Oceans)\n\nBright Eyes – Cassadaga: A Companion 12” (Dead Oceans)\n\nBright Eyes – The People’s Key [Reissue/2011] CD/LP (Dead Oceans)\n\nBright Eyes – The People’s Key: A Companion 12” (Dead Oceans)\n\nOne of the things that struck Oberst as he and the band went through 20-plus years of music is that he may in fact have been writing the same song this whole time. Not sonically, of course, but conceptually. This last wave contains, in Noise Floor, early Bright Eyes songs so raw Oberst never even released them back in the day, as well as, in Cassadaga and The People's Key, the band's most polished and sophisticated albums. When Bright Eyes toured Cassadaga they performed an epic seven sold-out nights at NYC's Town Hall. What's more grown-up rock star than that? And yet...\"Thematically those early songs are not that different than the songs I make now,\" Oberst says, shaking his head. \"There's something affirming and disheartening about it. It’s like, have I really changed or grown? But maybe it's just that I knew what I wanted to write about from the beginning.\" [Noise Floor (Rarities: 1998-2005) is pressed on champagne color vinyl. Cassadaga is pressed on yellow color vinyl. The People’s Key is pressed on orange color vinyl. The Companion 12” EPs for each release add bonus “Companion Version” tracks and are each pressed on gold color vinyl.]\n\nSheila Chandra – Weaving My Ancestors’ Voices [Reissue/1992] LP (Real World)\n\nSheila Chandra – The Zen Kiss [Reissue/1994] LP (Real World)\n\nSheila Chandra – ABoneCroneDrone [Reissue/1996] LP (Real World)\n\nSheila Chandra's 1992 debut album for Real World, Weaving My Ancestors' Voices began a trilogy that cemented her as one of the most accomplished musicians of her generation. An intensely beautiful album celebrating the first and ultimate instrument - the voice. Her flawless intertwining of vocal traditions from around the world has the capacity to move listeners just as radically now as it did upon its first release. [Limited-edition color vinyl reissues are available for all 3 titles.]\n\nJudy Collins – Wildflowers [Reissue/1967] LP (Elektra)\n\nJudy Collins' voice is remarkably beautiful and her phrasing and range place her in a category all by herself. The award-winning singer-songwriter is esteemed for her imaginative interpretations of traditional and contemporary folk standards and her own poetically poignant original compositions. The Mark Abramson-produced Wildflowers stands as her highest charting album to date and showcases both skills admirably with the Grammy-winning version of Joni Mitchell's \"Both Sides, Now\" and deeply meditative originals \"Since You Asked,\" \"Sky Fell\" and \"Albatross\".\n\nJackson Dean – Live At The Ryman LP (Big Machine)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl. Fast-rising country singer/songwriter Jackson Dean is quickly earning a reputation for his gritty, lyric-driven, outlaw country style and electric live shows. In October 2022, the \"artist to watch\" made his Ryman Auditorium debut, wowing the crowd with a spellbinding eight-song set captured on Live At The Ryman.\n\nWilly DeVille – Crow Jane Alley [Reissue/2004] LP+CD (earMUSIC)\n\nCrow Jane Alley is an album by Willy DeVille. It was recorded in 2004 in Los Angeles. For this album, DeVille was joined by members of the Chicano rock band Quetzal, David Hidalgo of Los Lobos, and Peruvian Afro-Cuban jazz drummer Alex Acuña, among other prominent musicians.\n\nDrive-By Truckers – The Complete Dirty South CD/2xLP (New West)\n\nIn 2004 the Drive-By Truckers released what would become the bestselling album in their illustrious catalog. The Dirty South is a concept album that examines the state of the South, and unveils the hypocrisy, irony, and tragedy that continues to exist. The album features live show staples like, \"Tornadoes\", \"Where The Devil Don't Stay\", and \"Puttin' People On The Moon\", as well as rarities like \"Goode's Field Road\" and \"Daddy's Cup\". The Complete Dirty South is a band-led rework of the original album. Principal member, Patterson Hood, took the reins and reimagined this record as it was originally intended. The complete version features resequenced audio, three additional tracks, and four remixes along with updated vocals. [A limited-edition reposado color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nThe Flaming Lips – Hypnotist LP (WB)\n\nThe centerpiece of the Hypnotist is the 24-minute epic \"Psychedelic Hypnotist Daydream (Demo)\". Three other tracks from the CD box set are included, also receiving their first release on LP - notably the instrumental version of \"Do You Realize?\". Over 32 minutes of music, pressed on limited-edition pink color vinyl.\n\nGentle Giant – Interview [Steven Wilson Remix] CD/CD+Blu-ray Audio (Alucard)\n\nInterview is the eighth studio album of Gentle Giant and was released April 23rd, 1976. Stylistically it continued in the vein of their preceding album, Free Hand released the year before. Interview further displayed the eclectic and versatile nature of the band, from reggae influenced grooves to ethereal a cappella vocal passages and furiously complex rockers. Award winning producer and musician Steven Wilson has remixed Interview in Dolby Atmos and 5. 1 surround sound. Wilson’s attention to detail and deep respect for the source material makes the album sound as fresh today as it did upon its initial release. In addition, the original flat mix, original 1976 quad mix and an instrumental mix will all be included on CD+Blu-ray Audio. [Vinyl editions due September 1.]\n\nRobert Glasper – In My Element [Reissue/2007] LP (Blue Note)\n\nRobert Glasper's 2005 Blue Note debut, Canvas, signaled the arrival of a singular new voice in jazz. His 2007 follow-up, In My Element, solidified his status as a rising star who was taking the music to some place new. Featuring Vicente Archer (bass) and Damion Reid (drums), it expanded the possibilities of where modern jazz might go by delving further into his hip-hop and gospel roots.\n\nGuilherme Coutinho E O Grupo Stalo – Guilherme Coutinho E O Grupo Stalo [Reissue/1978] LP/CD (Mr Bongo/ Belém)\n\nAn obscure record label from Belém in Brazil, that only released 7\" singles, with this album being one of two exceptions. During the 1970s, Belém had a thriving nightclub scene, but it is thousands of miles away from the music industry hubs of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, making this record insanely difficult to find, even in Brazil. Guilherme Coutinho E O Grupo Stalo is rich in charm, quirky and playful. It feels cinematic, soothing and benefits from being heard in its entirety.\n\nNatalie Imbruglia – Left Of The Middle [Reissue/1997] LP (Sony Legacy)\n\nNatalie took the music world by storm with the release of her debut single “Torn” which topped the charts in countries across the world (reaching number one in Australia and top 10 in the UK and the US) and went on to sell over 7 million copies worldwide. This was followed by huge hits, “Big Mistake”, which reached number two in the UK charts, “Wishing I Was There” and “Smoke”. The album was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the Grammys, and Natalie went on to win two Brit Awards for Best International Newcomer and Best International Female.\n\nWanda Jackson – The Dynamic Wanda Jackson: Rockabilly Queen 1964-1962 LP (Acrobat)\n\nWanda Jackson started her career in country music before embracing rock 'n' roll. While remaining true to her roots, the transition proved so successful she was affectionately crowned The Queen of Rockabilly.
