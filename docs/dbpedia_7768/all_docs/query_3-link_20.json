        "text": "French experimental rock trio Hifiklub and Faith No More keyboardist Roddy Bottum have collaborated on a dreamy, trance-like, unanticipated spoken words-filled album titled Things That Were Lost in the Fire. After sharing a video for a trance cover version of Survivor’s “Eye of the Tiger” in recent weeks, the band has now unleashed the full album exclusively via MetalSucks a few days ahead of its official release.\n\nBassist and vocalist Régis Laugier comments on the happenstance nature of the collaboration:\n\n“Who would have believed it? Only enthusiastic excited by the unknown. An exhibition in New-York where Hifiklub meets by chance Roddy Bottum. By chance, you said? A few months later, a French adventure for Roddy and a lot of fun for us all. That’s what we learned with Hifiklub, after 150 collaborations and 15 albums, everything’s possible, even a full record of spoken words created by musicians who originally hardly know each other! We love insanity.”"
