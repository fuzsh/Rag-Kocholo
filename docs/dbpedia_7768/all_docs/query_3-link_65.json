        "text": "Ahead of a 2015 full album, Faith No More has released “Motherfucker,” its first publicly available studio effort in 17 years. Produced by bassist Billy Gould, the new album will be released on Faith No More’s own Reclamation Records label.\n\nAccording to keyboardist Roddy Bottum, “Motherfucker” underscores a new autonomy Faith No More has over its music. Specifically, Bottum says, “It’s a huge deal for us to only have ourselves to answer to at this point in our career and the song is about that, where the buck stops.” That said, listeners are free to apply the lyrics to any motherfuckers they may encounter in their own lives.\n\nAvailable for pre-order via iTunes on December 9, “Motherfucker” will also get a vinyl release limited to 5,000 copies. The 7-inch single will be available November 28, and also features a B-side remix produced by J.G. Thirlwell. In the meantime, people can head over to Rolling Stone and listen to “Motherfucker” for themselves."
