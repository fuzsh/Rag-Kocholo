        "text": "Imperial Teen share new song “Don’t Wanna Let You Go” off forthcoming Now We Are Timeless\n\nToday, Imperial Teen share “Don’t Wanna Let You Go,” a sexy jam for these hot summer days! The new single kicks off with the signature Imperial Teen breathiness and vocal play and joins previously released songs “Walkaway” and “We Do What We Do Best” in the run-up to the band’s triumphant return with Now We Are Timeless on July 12.\n\nIn strict keeping with Imperial Teen’s roots of creating seemingly clean, pop presentations as a springboard for dramatic themes of loneliness, triumph, success, and failure, Now We Are Timeless moves us into a realm of inevitability for the band. While their first album Seasick thematically touched on the queasiness of pop and beach and sun and glare and the optimism that lies beneath, the new release serves as a bookend of sorts in its portrayal of a world in crisis, with its artwork showcasing a frostbitten but melting iceberg, monolithic and stationary yet impermanent and resonant.\n\nWhat has remained constant over the years is Imperial Teen’s indisputable knack for writing profound hooks as a framework for their musical memories. Their songs exhibit the realness, joy, and energy that only good friends can conjure.\n\nNow We Are Timeless is available for pre-order on CD, LP, and limited-edition “blue ice” Peak Vinyl in the Merge store, or wherever records are sold, including Imperial Teen’s shows next month!\n\nImperial Teen on tour:\n\nJul 16 Denver, CO – Twist & Shout (free in-store performance)\n\nJul 25 Brooklyn, NY – Baby’s All Right\n\nJul 26 Carrboro, NC – Cat’s Cradle (MRG30) [SOLD OUT] Aug 02 San Francisco, CA – Rickshaw Stop\n\nAug 03 Los Angeles, CA – The Echo\n\nAug 04 Palm Springs, CA – The Alibi\n\nFLOOD MAGAZINE: PREMIERE: Imperial Teen Feel Connected on “Walkaway”\n\nIt’s the second single from the Bay Area power-pop band’s first album in seven years.\n\nFor the first time in nearly a decade, Imperial Teen are doing what they do best: impossibly catchy pop songs rooted in the mid-’00s indie scene. With the recent announcement of Now We Are Timeless, the four-piece’s sixth album since forming in 1995, the band picked up right where they left off with 2012’s Feel the Sound.\n\nToday they’re sharing the new album’s second single, a more solemn affair than the first, recalling the packed stages of Broken Social Scene or The New Pornographers. According to the band, “Walkaway” was written to grapple with the fact that the four members live in different cities, and explain how they still manage to feel connected to one another:\n\n“‘Walkaway’ is a song about a feeling we’ve all known,” the group notes. “Watching others, near and far, and feeling distance and separation from what they’re experiencing—feeling connected and independent at the same time. Closing the gap of physical distance and making our lives a more connected place.”\n\nNow We Are Timeless is out July 12 on Merge. You can pre-order it from the label’s store here, or via your DSP of choice here. The band will be playing a pair of East Coast dates in July and a pair of West Coast dates in August—you can find those listed below the video.\n\nImperial Teen announce first album in seven years, share first single “We Do What We Do Best”\n\nImperial Teen are back in a big way with Now We Are Timeless, their first album in seven years! Listen to “We Do What We Do Best” now, and pre-order Now We Are Timeless starting today on CD, LP, and limited-edition “blue ice” Peak Vinyl in the Merge store, or wherever records are sold.\n\nListen to & share “We Do What We Do Best” by Imperial Teen now\n\nThe four-headed hydra that is Imperial Teen provided this statement in unison:\n\nUsing our voice is all we can do. We step up, collective and proud, this family of ours that’s sustained and explored creatively for over twenty years. We’re not saying we do what we do better than anyone, but the individuality of our collective voice is all that we have and it’s what we do. We Do What We Do Best.\n\nImperial Teen’s releases over the past 20+ years have been pointed and specific diaries of musical celebration, windows into the hypersensitive personal drama of relationships within the band, individual conquests and failures, and collective, aspirational hopes, dreams, and perspectives. Roddy Bottum, Will Schwartz, Jone Stebbins, and Lynn Perko Truell—who they’ve become, how they are dealing, and what their lives are in 2019—all of this is on Now We Are Timeless.\n\nThe band wrote and recorded the new album in the cities the individual members have geographically gravitated to: New York City, the Bay Area, Denver, and Los Angeles. Themes of time and movement, averting and succumbing to crisis, dealing with loss and pain are all represented on the record, but what rings triumphant is the undeniable joy and catharsis that come from the band’s spontaneous and improvisational approach to making music together.\n\nImperial Teen have announced a handful of performances this year, including MRG30 in North Carolina, so do your eyes and ears justice by picking up tickets to the show nearest you, and pre-order Now We Are Timeless today!\n\n&lt;a href=”http://imperialteen.bandcamp.com/album/now-we-are-timeless”&gt;Now We Are Timeless by Imperial Teen&lt;/a&gt;\n\nImperial Teen on tour:\n\nJul 25 Brooklyn, NY – Baby’s All Right\n\nJul 26 Carrboro, NC – Cat’s Cradle (MRG30) [SOLD OUT]\n\nAug 02 San Francisco, CA – Rickshaw Stop\n\nAug 03 Los Angeles, CA – The Echo\n\nBrooklyn Vegan: Listen to Imperial Teen’s “We Do What We Do Best” from first album in 7 years\n\n“Using our voice is all we can do,” say Imperial Teen about the first single from Now We Are Timeless, their first album in seven years. “We step up, collective and proud, this family of ours that’s sustained and explored creatively for over twenty years. We’re not saying we do what we do better than anyone, but the individuality of our collective voice is all that we have and it’s what we do. We Do What We Do Best.” That declaration, “We Do What We Do Best,” is also the title of the single, which is indeed what you expect from Roddy Bottum and the rest of Imperial Teen — crunchy, synthy, super-catchy indie rock. The song premieres in this post and you can listen below.\n\nNow We Are Timeless is out July 12 via Merge and you can preorder it now. Imperial Teen will be playing a few shows this summer surrounding their appearance at Merge Records 30th anniversary fest, MRG30, beginning with a show at Brooklyn’s Baby’s All Right on July 25 (tickets). Then after MRG30, they’ll play San Francisco’s Rickshaw Stop on August 2 and Los Angeles’ The Echo on August 3.
