Its members, the guitarist Dino Cazares, Jello Biafra, drummer Pat Hoed, bass guitarist Billy Gould and vocalist Juan Brujo, used pseudonyms as most were in other known bands.\n\nTheir first single, \"¡Demoniaco!\", was released in 1990. In 1992 \"Machetazos\" was released and with it came the band's first line-up change. Jello Biafra departed the group, Pinche Peach was introduced as an additional vocalist and Raymond Herrera took on the drums; Pat Hoed, the band's former drummer became a second vocalist. \"Machetazos\" and \"El Patrón (song)\" (1994) were produced and distributed through Jello Biafra's record label Alternative Tentacles.\n\nMatando Güeros\n\nThe band was criticized from its inception for its lyrics about drugs, sex and Satanism. These topics, while the subjects of many other death metal acts, were inspired by the actions of Adolfo Constanzo, Cuban-American born Mexican drug smuggler, practitioner of Palo (religion) Mayombe, and serial killer.\n\n¡Demoniaco!

Patton originally formed Mr. Bungle (named after an old educational film) with Trey Spruance (guitar/keyboards), Trevor Dunn (bass), Jed Watts (drums) and Scott Fritz (trumpet), recording a number of demo tapes in the late 80s. By the time of their major label debut the line-up featured Patton, Dunn, Spruance, Daniel Heifetz (drums, the grandson of noted violinist Jascha Heifetz), Clinton ‘Bär’ McKinnon (tenor saxophone/clarinet) and Theo Lengyel (alto saxophone). The sextet adopted an oddly costumed image to match their eclectic musical style, with Patton and Spruance adopting the respective pseudonyms Vlad Dracula and Scummy. They also enlisted jazz-noise experimentalist John Zorn to produce their self-titled 1991 debut.\n\nThe album received surprisingly positive reviews considering its extreme, genre-hopping, improvisational format and strange lyrical themes, although Zorn’s sympathetic production helped to focus the eccentricity. Mr. Bungle sold respectably on the strength of Patton’s name, but his Faith No More commitments kept live shows to a minimum.\n\nMr. Bungle\n\nBungle Fever\n\nMr. Bungle (1991)\n\n01. Travolta\n\n02.

Patton still whines and taunts like some snotty, obnoxious sixth-grader, only now to the accompaniment of Mr. Bungle’s heavy-handed, bungled attempt at blending metal with reggae, carnival music, and white-boy funk. The band’s idea of cutting-edge satire is writing witless lyrics like ”I wanna lock Betty Crocker in the kitchen/And knock her upper during supper” or-yuck yuck-mocking John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever 14 years after the movie’s release. By comparison, the bathroom humor of Frank Zappa (an obvious influence here) would be on par with Jonathan Swift. Mr. Bungle is meant to be clever musical satire, but the joke is entirely on Patton.

It was recorded in 1991 at Different Fur Studios in San Francisco and mixed at East Side Sound in New York City. It was released on Eva Records. It is 29 minutes and 22 seconds long and features four tracks, each named after a colour: Blue, Yellow, Pink, and Black.\n\nZorn dedicated the album to the French writer and activist Jean Genet: the album is also known as ‘Elegy for Jean Genet’. Genet wrote erotic works that dealt with taboo subjects such as sadomasochism and crime; he also explored philosophical topics such as existentialism. Zorn was particularly inspired by Genet’s only film, the short Un chant d’amour—though directed in 1950, the short was banned for many years due to its explicit portrayal of homosexuality. In the booklet accompanying the CD, Zorn describes how the picture changed his life forever. The film’s structure and themes, as well as its accompanying soundtrack all evidently inspired the music of Elegy.\n\nElegy is a studio album by John Zorn first released in 1992 in Japan.

Instead, he devised the four pieces using his ‘file card’ method of composition-improvisation—meaning that Zorn writes down his concepts and feelings, in this case, inspired by the writings of Jean Genet, onto file cards and then records the musicians interpreting these ideas in sound. Zorn also produced the album. Barbara Chaffe plays alto flute and bass flute. David Abel plays viola. Scummy, also known as Trey Spruance, provides guitar. David Shea is on the turntables. They are joined by Mike Patton on vocals and William Winant does percussion. It was digitally edited by Scott Hull. Sound effects were provided by David Slusser. Matt Murman worked as an assistant engineer and Joe Ferla mixed the album. Howard Johnston was recording engineer.

Phoenix Festival 1993 http://www.faithnomorefollowers.com\n\nOn July 17th 1993 Faith No More headlined the first ever Phoenix Festival in Stratford, UK. It would be their last show on the Angel Dust tour and their final live performance with Jim Martin.\n\nThe tensions between Jim and the other four members had escalated, since the writing and recording of Angel Dust in late 1991, to the point where animosity was obvious onstage. This perhaps also made playing live an unpleasant chore for the Bill, Roddy Bottum, Mike Bordin and particularly Mike Patton.\n\nIt is no doubt why reviews for the Phoenix festival set were poor. It has to be said that fans who attended the festival do not agree with journalists and report that it was a fantastic show.\n\nKerrang!, Issue 454\n\nPaul Rees\n\nFAITH NO MORE have always inhabited a strange world.\n\nTonight, it became a nightmare. Everyone is tired of hearing their back-biting, self-loathing, antihero tales of personal conflict and post-fame sickness. It could have been a big, bad joke, except Jim Martin is standing miles away from the others, playing his ugly Heavy Metal guitar to himself. Mike Patton takes the piss out of Jim whenever there's a lull. Then again, Mike Patton takes the piss out of everyone who's paid to see his don't-give-a-**** performance. Yeah, it's too big, too sick and too ugly.\n\nSure, the aerobics stunt at the start still raises a smile, Roddy Bottum's baroque keyboards are still wonderful, and so many of their songs still stand out like beacons,but the urgency, energy and desire has gone.\n\nBlame Patton. At Phoenix, the brat-turned-frontman is an arsehole.\n\n\"Oh, you silly people,\" he gasps as people pick up the refrain to 'Mid-Life Crisis' and sing. Oh, you silly, stupid, arrogant little oik - they've forked out fifty quid, stood for eight hours, ate crap food and used toilets like sewers just to see you give 'em a little bit of entertainment, a little bit of attention. And you don't wanna sing 'Falling To Pieces', you ain't got the time to put anything into \"Zombie Eaters', you only bark and groan and whine and act out some white trash fantasy. F**k you, and f**k your played-out games.\n\nPatton and the miserable, isolated Martin aside, Faith No More occasionally blow a storm in a teacup. 'R.V.' is wickedly accurate, 'Small Victory' pulls glistening melodies out of the hat, 'Be Aggressive' is hilariously off-centre, 'We Care A Lot' pumps and bruises. Only some of them don't care a lot. Some of them don't care at all.\n\nSplit up, get a new guitarist or a new singer, cut the ****. Now, it's insincere, worn out, stupid, fake, dull, worthless. Now, it's not funny.\n\nAnother Body Murdered\n\nMusic from the Motion Picture Judgement Night September 14, 1993\n\nSingle October 25, 1993\n\nAnother Body Murdered - Holland - 12\" - 659 794-6 - Faith No More Discography .com\n\nThe JUDGMENT NIGHT SOUNDTRACK was released 25 years ago!\n\nThe song Another Body Murdered was written by Boo Yaa T.R.I.B.E. and FNM with Bill playing guitar, it was produced by both bands and Ghetto Guerillas.

Their family is from American Samoa. They became popular after touring in Japan in the mid 1980s, where they were initially known as the \"Blue City Crew.\" The \"Boo-Yaa\" in their name signifies the sound of a shotgun being discharged, while the \"T.R.I.B.E.\" stands for \"Too Rough International Boo-Yaa Empire.\" According to hip-hop documentarians, Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. is \"synonymous with hip hop in Los Angeles.\n\nBoo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E.\n\nBoo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E.\n\nBoo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. - Listen on Deezer | Music Streaming\n\nBoo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E.

It is true that the genre busting sounds of certain bands made it difficult to categorise, however these tags were more relevant for particular songs rather than bands. In 1986 Aerosmith joined up with Run DMC to record a rap-rock version of the classic song Walk This Way and in 1987 Anthrax and Public Enemy released Bring The Noise.\n\nIn 1993 this fusion of the rock / rap genres was taken to the next level with the soundtrack to the film Judgment Night. The movie is an 'urban suspense drama' starring Emilio Estevez, Denis Leary, Cuba Goading Jr., and House Of Pain's Everlast.\n\nJudgment Night OST was the brainchild of Happy Walters, the then president of Immortal Records and manager of hip-hop bands such as House Of Pain and Cypress Hill.\n\n\"Since I manage Everlast, it sort of came ta pass that [my record label] would handle the Soundtrack.\" The idea for a set cross-pollinating alternative noise with rap expression grew out of Walters’ realization that \"a lot of alternative artists dig hip-hop and a lot of hip-hop artists like alternative. It kind of made sense to do something that brings the [two teen genres] together.\"\n\nThe process of translating his vision into reality took six months to complete. It Involved hard planning and heavy negotiations.\n\n\"First I had to get a hold of the managers and get them excited about the project. Once that was achieved the artists also had to be stirred. Next the labels had to give their permission to be on the album. Then the artist’s publishers had to grant sync fees and licenses for the off.\"\n\nWalters says he succeeded with help from other artist managers linked to the project. To assist the creativity of the performers, who recorded from locales all over the world. Walters says he provided them scenes from the movie complete with notes explaining the shots. The task of 'spotting'(selecting where songs would be used) was carried out by Karen Rachnian, music supervisor for the film's producer, Largo Entertainment.\n\n\"Sonic Youth, Helmet, their managers were super supportive. Helmet was super into it. Faith No More was really into it. Those three, I think, were the first ones to come on board, which were all credible and cool at the time, which helped with others.\"\n\nFaith No More were paired up with Samoan gangster outfit Boo Yaa T.R.I.B.E. In late July of 93 FNM had finished a two year long tour supporting their album Angel Dust, this time had allowed the band to push the boundaries of their music further than ever before. However there were casualties as long-time guitarist Jim Martin became alienated by the band's new direction.\n\nTherefore only four members of the FNM (Patton, Gould, Bottum and Bordin) flew out to L.A to attend a recording session with Boo Yaa T.R.I.B.E.\n\n\"We didn’t know the Boo-Yaa guys before we did the collaboration…in fact, we met at the studio. They were all great musicians in their own right, and what was surprising is that we clicked immediately on a musical level. Once the instruments were set up, we proceed to do a probably 30 minute jam, which I have to say was excellent. Sadly, the engineers thought we were just soundchecking. So we did another, for probably another 30 minutes straight. It was also really good, maybe not quite the same as the first attempt, but great nonetheless. However, as luck would have it, the producer had forgotten to hit “record”. The music on this soundtrack came from our 3rd attempt, which turned out ok, but sadly probably the least interesting of the three takes.\" - Bill Gould 2018\n\nMarcus Raboy directed video\n\nFaith No More & Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. - Another Body Murdered [Official Video]\n\nFaith No More / Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E.

Always have.\n\nBut bringing this up leads me to wonder something - how exactly did I acquire this track? I distinctly remember the MTV News segment regarding the soundtrack. Ice-T talking about working with Slayer, etc. But I have no memory of the FMN/Boo Yaa Tribe video, which I was surprised to see even existed. Did I simply forget about it? Did it's absence from the video collection DVD cause this? Did MTV air the thing? I don't know. And I'm certain I never owned the soundtrack. I didn't even know Pearl Jam cut a track with Cypress Hill until just now!\n\nBut I do know I was familiar with the song at the time. I've listened to this song for years and year. But I never owned the soundtrack album. I'm sure of that. Was there a cassette single? Did I own it? If so, again, no memory, and where is it now?\n\nCould I have taped it off the radio or something? Not sure. But I'm sure I had it on some of my mix tapes back in the day. And I definitely have it on several of my ancient mix CDs for the car currently. The source of this track is some mp3 I got from Audio Galaxy about 20 years ago when I first ventured on to the world-wide internet and started scooping up some of those elusive b-sides I refused to pay $25 for an import CD single to attain.\n\nSo all these years later you mean I'm still listening to this song via a prehistoric digital file?\n\nThis made me feel wrong and dirty. As this thread has done several times so far, it has alerted me to flaws in my FNM collection and sent me on a mission to rectify it. So I hustled over to discogs and purchased both the promo CD single and the 12 inch vinyl single of \"Another Body Murdered\" (both are the Helmet-less versions - no cross contamination, please). I have finally righted a very old wrong.\n\nLike I said, not a rap fan, but this track is excellent. The track really rocks. Great drum sound from Puffy. Roddy plays his notes and makes it Faith No More. Patton chooses his spots and does his thing. We'd be getting a lot more of his crazed screaming on the upcoming album. I guess I was disappointed to find out that Jim wasn't playing the guitar but I probably could have figured that out sooner if I pulled my head out of my ass.\n\nI don't know anything about Boo-Yaa Tribe but I like their style. The lead rapper has a powerful, Chuck D/Martin Luther King sermon-on-the-mount kind of sound, which I dig.\n\nI listen to this track often, mainly because it sprouts up on several of my mix cds in the car. I always crank it up and rock out.\n\nNow that I have the legit CD single I can rip that sumbitch in WAV and hear the track in it's full glory and toss aside the crappy (probably) 128k mp3. Listen to all those bass frequencies I never noticed before. Damn."
