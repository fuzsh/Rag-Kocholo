        "text": "Well, I think today is the first day in about a week and a half that I DIDN’T buy any used records for the shop. Probably for the best though, we’ve got a major backlog going on here now. I’ve made a small list below of just SOME of the stuff we’ve put out recently to whet your appetite. Come down this weekend and have a dig.\n\n…..pick of the week…..\n\nBig Black: Atomizer\n\n(Touch & Go) LP\n\nSo, there’s so much to love about this album. So frantic, so angsty, so abrassive. It’s the auditory equivalent of crashing through the windshield of your car and then skidding on your face for a block and living to tell the tale. “Originally released in 1985, and now remastered by Steve Albini and Bob Weston at Chicago Mastering, Big Black’s first full-length album Atomizer will be re-released in September 2015. To save you having to do the math in your head, yes, that makes this a 30th anniversary reissue. This remastered version of Atomizer also includes the song “Strange Things” which appeared on the first pressing, but was not present on subsequent vinyl pressings nor on The Rich Man’s Eight Track CD. It also comes with a double sided insert and a digital download coupon. To put this release into context for the uninformed: Big Black began in 1982. Steve Albini, then a sophomore at Northwestern University, fanzine writer and loudmouth, released the Lungs EP on the Chicago co-operative label Ruthless (whose other artists at the time included Naked Raygun and the Effigies). Lungs was recorded in his apartment on a borrowed 4-track for the price of one case of beer. After that record’s release, Jeff Pezzati (singer for Naked Raygun) and Santiago Durango (Naked Raygun, Arsenal), both linchpins of the burgeoning Chicago music scene, joined Big Black. During this period, the band established itself as a live act, recorded two more records, the Bulldozer EP and the Racer X EP, toured the U.S., and had -in general – a pretty good time. Pezzati’s other obligations precipitated his departure from the band in 1984, when he was replaced by Dave Riley, bass player for Chicago swing-punk band Savage Beliefs. This lineup persisted until the band’s self-destruction in August of 1987. Big Black toured the U.S., England, Europe, and Austrailia. They recorded a shitload of records: Il Duce 45, Atomizer LP, Headache EP (which bore the heartbreakingly-honest disclaimer “Warning! Not as good as Atomizer. Don’t get your hopes up, Cheese.”), Heartbeat 45, He’s A Whore 45, Songs About Fucking LP, and the Pig Pile LP.” HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!\n\nFile Under: Punk, Albini, Drum Machines\n\nListen Here\n\n…..new arrivals…..\n\nBorn Ruffians: Ruff (Paper Bag) DLX LP\n\nThe deluxe edition is loaded with unique surprises! We could tell you what makes it so special, but in the internet age there’s little mystery left in music and Born Ruffians love surprises. Order the deluxe edition and discover all the hidden treasures when you receive the vinyl on release date! The deluxe edition will be signed by the band, but that’s about the only surprise that we can share. *Deluxe Edition comes with limited edition Born Ruffians slip mat! The record is RUFF – simultaneously a return to form and a departure from expectations. Songs of refutation, lamentations of forgotten past lives and ecstatic self-erasures that say “eat shit, we did it!”. RUFF, as an idea, is everything – sound, message, band. If Birthmarks was polished and presentable, RUFF is the ugly innards that hide beneath.\n\nFile Under: Indie Rock, CanCon\n\nListen Here\n\nChvrches: Every Open Eye (Glassnote) LP\n\nIn tomorrow…. A lot has changed for CHVRCHES in the past few years. When the Glaswegian trio wrote and recorded their debut, The Bones Of What You Believe (2013), no one had heard of them. The three members (Iain Cook, Martin Doherty and Lauren Mayberry) came together with the idea of working on a writing project together, unsure of what path that would take other than one which belied their previous musical projects and foregrounded melody and classic songwriting styles before everything else. There were no pre-existing ideas of what the record would or should be like, no pre-conceptions and nothing to live up to – just three people in a basement studio in Glasgow making music they believed in. The album went on to sell over 500,000 copies and earned rave reviews far and wide. Approaching the new album, Every Open Eye, one could argue that everything is different for the band but they tried not to treat it that way. CHVRCHES returned to the same hometown studio that had housed them during the recording of their first LP, their basic goal to shut off the outside world and get back to what they know best: writing. Made in CHVRCHES’ Alucard Studios – a converted three-bedroom flat on the southside of Glasgow – Every Open Eye offers an alternative approach in a climate of music written by committee or the same handful of well-known songwriters, going back to the idea that a band can write, record and produce their work entirely by themselves. Using some ideas the band had recorded in venues during their time on the road as a starting point, the band found riffs, loops and melodies they wanted to develop or started from scratch on the synths, pads and machines they had been gathering in their basement to create the instrumentals of the songs. Vocal melodies were developed as the songs took shape with the lyrics added last, developed from words and sentences from notebooks Lauren Mayberry had kept on tour. Musically, Every Open Eye seeks to do more with less. To make big sounds without racking up endless tracks within Cubase sessions. To make something intense and urgent and visceral, using the basic tools of melody, rhythm and arrangement rather than the mentality that ‘more is more’. Sonically, Every Open Eye develops CHVRCHES’ signature style, juxtaposing the light and the dark, creating their own brand of twisted pop music that uniquely merges the organic with the electronic, molding sounds and ideas forged over two years on the road into an electronic-pop record with a heart. Lyrically, Every Open Eye is not a break up album. It is a record about past heartbreaks and getting over them (“Leave A Trace”). About perspective and the benefit of hindsight. About being unapologetic and not being told what to do or who to be (“Bury It,” “Never Ending Circles,” “Playing Dead”). About moving on to better things, holding on to the good and letting go of the bad (“Down Side Of Me,” “Clearest Blue,” “Afterglow”). Mixed by Spike Stent and mastered by Bob Ludwig.\n\nFile Under: Electronic, Synth-Pop\n\nListen Here\n\nDaft Punk: Tron Legacy (Disney) LP\n\nIn tomorrow… A few years ago this came out, and everyone was like “It’s too expensive…” then it sold out and started selling for 4-5 times as much online. Well, now you can buy it for slightly less than it originally cost, so, maybe waiting paid off… “Continuing to exploit their creative urges to their ends, multi-platinum electronic duo Daft Punk (Guy-Manuel de Homen-Christo and Thomas Bangalter) took on one of their most ambitious projects to date in 2008, when they agreed to score the modern remake of the hugely influential 1982 film, Tron. Daft Punk’s reverence of the original film and the themes that define it (the evolving relationship between humans and technology, specifically) rendered them discontented working within the means of their own studio. “We knew from the start that there was no way we were going to do this film score with two synthesizers and a drum machine,” stated Guy-Manuel. Enlisting a 100-piece orchestra, they emerged from the studio after two years with a work whose importance superseded the editing process of the actual film – the movie was cut to the score, atypically. Tron: Legacy peaked at #4 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and was awarded with a gold certification for 500,000 units sold shortly thereafter.”\n\nFile Under: Electronic, OST\n\nListen Here\n\nDischarge: Toronto 83 (Ugly Pop) LP\n\nIn tomorrow… Discharge are one of the greatest punk bands of all time, and this 1983 set captures them in ferocious form. Rescued from an old tape, the sound is violent, dirty and powerful, a raw document of a raw band blazing through 14 tracks of relentlessly furious hardcore. Fully legit and authorised, not a bootleg. WARNING: do not expect NOFX CD sound– this is noise not music!\n\nFile Under: Punk, Hardcore\n\nListen Here\n\nGirl Band: Holding Hands With Jamie (Rough Trade) LP\n\nHolding Hands with Jamie, Girl Band’s debut album, comes a few years into their tenure; a few years after their first tour, nine days crammed into a Fiat Panda; a few years of stamping 7″ sleeves to sell at merch tables and mail-order; a few years of writing songs and touring and developing a live ferocity unmatched by nearly anyone. Recorded in April 2015 in their home town of Dublin at Bow Lane Studios over two days after returning home from their first-ever US tour, the nine tracks making up Holding Hands with Jamie capture, more than any previous recordings, the tension and abrasive energy of a Girl Band performance. Recalling any number of things but for only milliseconds at a time, Girl Band make a mockery of comparisons, because you can only get as far as “oh this bit sounds like” before a guitar scuff-screams, the bass crunches like a car in a bailing press, or something else visceral and glorious comes from the speakers, and the thought’s erased. But ultimately, anyone who’s paying attention can only conclude, like Noisey did: “The one blindingly obvious thing about Girl Band is that this is fucking great.” “Paint-peelingly vicious” – Toronto Star. “One of the most confident, shit-kicking bands around.” – NME. “You don’t so much listen to a Girl Band song as get strapped into it” – Pitchfork.\n\nFile Under: Punk, Noise Rock\n\nListen Here\n\nHelen: The Original Faces (Kranky) LP\n\n“When I was a child, I spoke to Helen. “Helen is a pop group from Oregon. Liz Harris (vocals/lead guitar), Jed Bindeman (drums/tambourine), Scott Simmons (bass/guitar), and Helen (backup vocals). Originally started with the intention of being a thrash band, it turned into something else entirely. The Original Faces was recorded over a period of several years in Portland by the band members and their friends Nick, Chris, and, largely, Justin Higgins. Written together, some songs based on Liz and Scott’s demos.”\n\nFile Under: LoFi, Shoegaze, Grouper\n\nListen Here\n\nMark Lanegan: 2002 Houston Publishing Demos 2002 (Ipecac) LP\n\nIn tomorrow… Mark Lanegan first rose to fame with his band the Screaming Trees in the ’90s. Like other noted artists Lanegan has carved out a strong identity of his own as a vocalist and songwriter informed by the blues but willing to take his darkly poetic sensibility wherever his muse was pointing him, from hard rock to electronics. Cut to 2002, The Screaming Trees had just recently disbanded and Lanegan was in the early years of his solo offerings (at this point he had released a mere five solo albums). The songs on Houston Publishing Demos 2002, were written, recorded, then shelved until now, with the release of this 12-song collection of previously unreleased demos on Ipecac Recordings. In addition to familiar tunes like “Has God Seen My Shadow?,” “Halycon Daze” and “Gray Goes Black,” most of the material here is being unveiled for the first time. Houston Publishing Demos 2002 was produced by Justice Records’ Randall Jamail while the artwork for the album was done by The Mekon’s John Langford.\n\nFile Under: Indie Rock\n\nListen Here\n\nNathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats: s/t (Fantasy) LP\n\nIn tomorrow… BACK IN STOCK! Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats practically explodes with deep, primal and ecstatic soulfulness. This stunning work isn’t just soul stirring, it’s also soul baring, and the combination is absolutely devastating to behold. You don’t just listen to this record – you experience it. So it’s entirely fitting that the self-titled album will bear the iconic logo of Stax Records, because at certain moments Rateliff seems to be channeling soul greats like Otis Redding and Sam & Dave. But as this gifted multi-instrumentalist honors the legacy of the legendary Memphis label, he’s also setting out into audacious new territory. Those who were beguiled by In Memory of Loss, Rateliff’s folky, bittersweet 2010 Rounder album, will be in for an initial shock when they spin Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats. But when you delve beneath the rawboned surface of the new album’s wall-rattling presentation, with its deep-gut grooves, snaky guitars, churning Hammond and irresistible horns, you’ll find that same sensitive, introspective dude, who bravely tells it like it is, breaking through his reticence to expose often harsh truths about the life he’s lived, the people he’s hurt and the despair he’s struggled with. The difference between the two albums is that the Nights Sweats’ funkiness insulates the starkly confessional nature of Rateliff’s songs while at the same time underscoring their emotional extremes. As the band blazes away on the soul-rock rave-up “I Need Never Get Old,” the visceral “Howling at Nothing” and the supercharged “Trying So Hard Not to Know,” which open the album with a sustained outpouring of torrid intensity, Rateliff is opening himself up emotionally as well as physically, the raw grit in his voice conveying anguish and hope in equal measure. The buoyant immediacy of the music makes the hard truths embedded in the songs easier to swallow than it would be in Rateliff’s other primary mode – a solitary guy with a guitar, the brim of his baseball cap pulled down, putting his heart and guts on the line without the protection of his simpatico cohorts. Make no mistake, these songs would stop you in their tracks presented in that naked way as well, but the additional layers of soulfulness provided by the Night Sweats – its core comprising guitarist Joseph Pope III, drummer Patrick Meese and keyboardist Mark Shusterman – bring a convergence of intensities, musical and psychological, to the performances. “S.O.B.” sits at the dead center of the album, between the brutally honest confessionals “I’ve Been Failing” and “Wasted Time.” Thematically, the song is the album’s linchpin – partly a rebuke, partly a cry of defiance, “S.O.B” is the “fuck it all” anthem of a blue-collar kid from the Heartland whose conditioned idea of therapy is a shot and a beer chaser, and then another round, on the way to sweet oblivion. From there Rateliff contemplates some of the sustaining aspects of existence, from redemption by way of the forgiving love of another in “Thank You,” “Look It Here” and “I’d Be Waiting” to sexual heat in the N’awlins-style strutter “Shake.” The album ends on a hopeful note with the relatively laidback “Mellow Out.” When it came time to pick a producer, Rateliff went with Richard Swift, a polymath who has made records under his own name, helmed projects for Damien Jurado, the Mynabirds and others, and has played with The Black Keys and the Shins. Swift’s specialty is summoning (and capturing) inspired performances in the moment, and the synergy in the studio, first with Rateliff and then with his band, was instant and palpable. Rateliff and the Sweats already had the arrangements of the new songs down cold, having shaped them on the road. Swift, knowing a good thing when he heard it, set the mics, honed the sound, giving it plenty of space so that the studio itself served as an integral sonic component. Then he pressed “record” and coaxed it into happening organically.\n\nFile Under: Funk, Soul, Blues\n\nListen Here\n\nMax Richter: From Sleep (Deutsche Grammophon) LP\n\nOne of Britain’s leading contemporary composers has written what is thought to be the longest single piece of classical music ever to be recorded. Sleep is eight hours long – and is actually and genuinely intended to send the listener to sleep. “It’s an eight-hour lullaby,” says its composer, Max Richter. The landmark work is scored for piano, strings, electronics and vocals – but no words. “It’s my personal lullaby for a frenetic world,” he says. “A manifesto for a slower pace of existence.” Sleep will receive its world premiere this September in Berlin, in a concert performance lasting from 12 midnight to 8am at which the audience will be given beds instead of seats and programmes. The eight-hour version will be available as a digital album while a one-hour adaptation of the work entitled From Sleep will be released on double vinyl, both from Deutsche Grammophon. “You could say that the short one is meant to be listened to and the long one is meant to be heard while sleeping,” says Richter, who describes the one-hour version as “a series of windows opening into the big piece.” Richter does not expect anyone to sit down and listen to Sleep in its entirety, although some surely will. “It’s really an experiment to try and understand how we experience music in different states of consciousness.” He says he came up with the idea because of a long-standing fascination: “Sleeping is one of the most important things we all do,” he says. “We spend a third of our lives asleep and it’s always been one of my favourite things, ever since I was a child.” Coinciding as it does with the renewed interest in durational works within the fine art community, Richter says: “This isn’t something new in music, it goes back to Cage, Terry Riley, and LaMonte Young, and it’s coming around again partly as a reaction to our speeded-up lives – we are all in need of a pause button.” Richter adds, “I’m perpetually curious about performance conventions in classical music, our rigid rules that dictate how and what music we can appreciate. Somehow in Europe over the last century, as complexity and inaccessibility in music became equated with intelligence and the avant-garde, we lost something along the way. Modernism gave us so many stunning works but we also lost our lullabies. We lost a shared communion in sound. Audiences have dwindled. All my pieces over the last few years have been exploring this, as does Sleep. It’s a very deliberate political statement for me.”\n\nFile Under: Classical, Ambient\n\nListen Here\n\nTelekenesis: Ad Infinitum (Merge) LP\n\nWhen it came time to make Ad Infinitum, the fourth Telekinesis album, drummer/songwriter/principal architect Michael Lerner found himself in a predicament. In just under five years, he had released three fantastic records—Telekinesis! (2009), 12 Desperate Straight Lines (2011), and Dormarion (2013)—each more ambitious than the last. He had toured all over the world, shared stages with great bands, and enthralled fans of his infectious, ebullient power pop. Newly married and happily ensconced in the home studio he’d assembled in his West Seattle basement, Lerner found himself asking the question that has haunted modestly successful bands down the ages: What do you do after the rock and roll dreams you had when you were 19 have come true? “I went down to the basement,” Lerner recalls, “and started playing the same chords I always play… I just felt like I’d exhausted everything I knew. I was not excited at all. I just could not make another power-pop album.” While many artists have made fruitful use of vintage sounds and production techniques in recent years, Ad Infinitum is a different animal. It feels less like a time capsule and more like a time machine. In the movie version of the story, Lerner would stumble on his way down the stairs, hit his head, and wake up in 1983, and the only way he could get back to the present day would be to make a record using available instruments. Then he’d wake in 2015 to discover he’d been in his basement studio all along. And the record he’d made in that strange dream state would turn out to be Ad Infinitum, the most ambitious and assured Telekinesis release to date.\n\nFile Under: Indie Rock\n\nListen Here\n\nWand: 1000 Days (Drag City) LP\n\nRecorded in Los Angeles and San Francisco in between tour days, 1000 Days finds Wand searching in corners. Where have all the people gone? Where have they put them? Panoramas of the body history are viewed through Wand’s spy-glass as it sweeps the horizon. Major mutations blooming and ballooning in the cities. The vault where plans for an invasion gather dust. The latest fables buzzing down the civil wire. All these and more are folded and packed neatly into a traveler’s trunk stuffed with tonal frequencies – sounds that tickle a Pavlovian response, the heartache and the sadness and the anger that we feel, the tug of our highest ideals. All by punching a key or playing a chord – an illusion made of parts representing a sequence or set of steps that, taken together, add up to an exploded diagram of a subject and its perception, meant to be swallowed as a whole. Whether it addresses a way of life, a homebrewed philosophy, a dark part of history or a cacophony of personal desires, the song remains truly a thing, regardless of the angle of affection.\n\nFile Under: Psych Rock\n\nListen Here\n\nElyse Weinberg: Greasepaint Smile (Numerophone) LP\n\nThe unreleased second album by an original lady from the canyon. Recorded and recanted in 1969, Greasepaint Smile is more assured than its self-titled, Tetragrammaton-issued predecessor. Weinberg’s finger-picked acoustic is layered over distant drumming, while her gravel-pit voice evokes life, love, and mortality. Fellow Torontonian Neil Young sears “Houses” with his signature fuzz-tone, casting chaos over the beautiful ballad, while J.D. Souther, Kenny Edwards, and Nils Lofgren, pick up the slack. Masterfully produced by David Briggs, Greasepaint Smile has climbed out of the canyon and is bound for every turntable east of the 405.\n\nFile Under: Folk\n\nListen Here\n\nNeil Young: Monsanto Years (Reprise) LP\n\nIn tomorrow… Neil Young + Promise of the Real have joined forces for the new ecologically/environmentally-focused studio album, The Monsanto Years, inspired by the food industry conglomerate Monsanto. For this guitar-centric, full steam-ahead and highly-charged rock album, Young is joined by Promise of the Real, an LA-based rock band fronted by Lukas Nelson (vocals/guitar), along with Micah Nelson (guitar, vocals), Anthony Logerfo (drums), Corey McCormick (bass) and Tato Melgar (percussion). The album’s artwork is a send up of the famous American Gothic painting featuring Young and his girlfriend Daryl Hannah.\n\nFile Under: Rock\n\nListen Here\n\nYouth Lagoon: Savage Hills Ballroom (Fat Possum) LP\n\nIn tomorrow… Trevor Powers, the Idaho musician known as Youth Lagoon, has found what used to be destructive is now what gives him life. “I’ve never felt truly comfortable. It’s this feeling of uneasiness that follows me everywhere I go because my thoughts never shut up,” says Powers. “It used to exhaust me, but I’ve learned discomfort is invaluable. Safety makes us numb. It’s when we find ourselves in territories we’re unfamiliar with that we can really grow.” While on tour throughout Europe, Powers received a phone call from home informing him that one of his closest friends had drowned in the local river. After canceling the tour and flying home for the funeral, the following months marked a defining shift in Powers’ approach to songwriting. “Just how entwined we are never truly hit me before that,” claims Powers. “We are all connected. Even strangers. Our existence is one dazzling pattern that repeats itself endlessly. What makes us distinct is our flaws. In our defects lies something great.” Youth Lagoon’s third album Savage Hills Ballroom is rooted in discomfort, rather than avoiding it. Influenced by society’s desire to exude a flawless existence, the album’s musical direction and visual aspects were conceived on Powers’ late-night walks through Idaho’s suburbs. “When I see rows and rows of seemingly ideal houses, I can’t help but think that humanity has an innate craving to look perfect. And usually the better someone’s life seems from the outside, the more they’re hiding,” states Powers. “I’ve had a lot of barriers for a long time that I haven’t let people past, and I’ve gotten really sick of playing pretend.” Shortly after meeting co-producer Ali Chant through a series of webcam chats, Powers relocated to Bristol, UK for two months to record Savage Hills Ballroom at Toybox Studios — an underground recording space in a vaulted Georgian basement.\n\nFile Under: Indie Rock\n\nListen Here\n\nVarious: Daptone Gold 2 (Daptone) LP\n\nIn tomorrow…The Daptone Gold II double LP is packaged in a silver foil gatefold sleeve and comes with a poster, liner notes and iron-on.

Kurt Vile does his own myth making; a boy/man with an old soul voice in the age of digital everything becoming something else, which is why his sixth full-length record and first in two years – the focused, brilliantly clear and seemingly candid B’lieve I’m Goin Down… is a breath of fresh air. Recorded and mixed in a number of locations, including Los Angeles and Joshua Tree, the album is a handshake across the country, East to West coast, through the dustbowl history of Woody honest straight forward talk Guthrie, and a Cali canyon dead still night floating in a nearly waterless landscape. The record is all air, weightless, bodyless, but grounded in convincing authenticity, in the best version of singer songwriter upcycling. Capturing Vile both deeply introspective and briskly self-assured, he explains: “I wanted to get back into the habit of writing a sad song on my couch, with nobody waiting on me. I really wanted it to sound like it’s on my couch – not in a lo-fi way, just more unguarded and vulnerable.” The Deluxe Version of Kurt Vile’s newest Matador Records endeavor is entitled B’lieve I’m Goin (Deep) Down… and comes pressed on limited edition triple gatefold vinyl with 6 bonus tracks for a total of 18 in all plus an extra printed innersleeve. “It’s a weird, accepting, mature record, acknowledging the inherent immaturity of being a person whether father, husband, partner, adult, musician, not perfect, but compelling for its understanding…that’s life though so sad to say…” – Kim Gordon\n\nFile Under: Indie Rock, Stoner Folk\n\nListen Here\n\nNeurosis: Times of Grace (Relapse) LP\n\nBack in with enough stock to last more than an hour… Times Of Grace is yet another ferocious war cry from Oakland, CA seminal hardcore auteurs Neurosis. Their sixth full-length offering overall is brutally honest, original, and categorically defiant, a bold work which lures with its vivid rhythms, strikes with a siege of emotion, and consumes with abysmal force! Relapse Records is pleased to offer super deluxe vinyl reissues of Neurosis’ Through Silver In Blood (originally released in 1996, first time on vinyl in 10 years), Times Of Grace (originally released in 1999, first time on vinyl in 15+ years) and the Times Of Grace companion piece, Tribes of Neurot’s Grace (originally released in 1999, never before on vinyl).

James aka Aphex Twin revises his legendary AFX guise with an 8-track collection of tracks for the alien dancefloor. Orphaned Deejay Selek 2006-2008 appears on an initial run of special spot-glossed and die-cut packaged 12″ vinyl LPs made in the Designers Republic. Previous AFX releases include Analogue Bubblebath (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Smojphace and Hangable Auto Bulb.

Exclusive to the box sets will be Re:Call 1, a new 2-disc compilation of non-album singles, single versions and b-sides. It features a previously unreleased single edit of “All The Madmen,” which was originally set for a U.S. release but was never actually released. Also included is the original version of “Holy Holy,” which was only ever released on the original 1971 Mercury single and hasn’t been available on any release since. Also exclusive to all versions of Five Years 1969–1973 will be a 2003 stereo remix of The Rise and Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars by the album’s original co-producer Ken Scott, previously only available on DVD with the LP/DVD format of the 40th anniversary edition of the album. The box set’s accompanying 84 page book will feature rarely seen photos as well as technical notes about each album from producers Tony Visconti and Ken Scott, an original press review for each album and a short foreword by legendary Kinks front man Ray Davies. An alternate cover has been created for the 2003 mix of Ziggy Stardust by Ken Scott, which features an outtake from the original Heddon Street photo session. There is also newly originated artwork for Re:Call 1 featuring a 1973 in-studio image from renowned photographer Mick Rock.\n\nFile Under: Rock\n\nListen Here\n\nDead Weather: Dodge & Burn (Third Man) LP\n\nWay back in October 2013, The Dead Weather and Third Man Records announced an incredibly special 7″ featuring “Open Up (That’s Enough)” b/w “Rough Detective” as part of Vault Package #18. These two tracks were a fierce battle cry heralding the announcement of a brand new Dead Weather album that was to be released in a revolutionary fashion. Teased out over the past year and a half via a series of 7″ singles, the physical versions of which were ONLY available via The Vault (Third Man’s one-of-a-kind subscription mail-order service), the band promised this would culminate in a brand new album in 2015. The third Dead Weather LP would be a full length album comprised not only of the previously released 7″ singles, but newly recorded, previously-unheard material. Now The Dead Weather officially present their new album Dodge & Burn. The 12-track set will be released worldwide in September 2015 on Third Man Records and will feature eight brand new songs, along with the four previously released tracks remixed and remastered. Alison Mosshart, Jack White, Dean Fertita and Jack Lawrence spent their rare and sporadic free moments over the past year recording together in Nashville. With the members of the band heavily involved in other projects, The Dead Weather will not be touring in support of the new album. Thankfully the thick and heavy Dodge & Burn will satisfy your urges for the dark magic that is The Dead Weather for a very long time.\n\nFile Under: Rock\n\nListen Here\n\nLana Del Rey: Honeymoon (Interscope) LP\n\nThrowback singer/songwriter Lana Del Rey’s new Interscope/Polydor album Honeymoon follows up 2014’s million-seller Ultraviolence and features more signature dreamy pop collaborations with producers like Mark Ronson, Daniel Heath, Rick Nowels, Emile Haynie and Justin Parker. The highly anticipated 14-track set from pop’s newest femme fatale is preceded by the cinematic singles “High by the Beach” and “Terrance Loves You” and is presented here on limited edition colored double 180g vinyl in gatefold packaging complete with a 16 page booklet. Del Rey tells Billboard: “It’s very different from the last one and similar to the first two…I’m kind of enjoying sinking into this more noirish feel for this one…I’m doing a cover of ‘Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood.’ After doing a cover of ‘The Other Woman’ [the song by R&B writer Jessie Mae Robinson that Del Rey recorded on ‘Ultraviolence’], I like summarizing the record with a jazz song…”\n\nFile Under: Pop, Electronic\n\nListen Here\n\nEmpress Of: Me (Terrible) LP\n\n“Can I make it clear?” Lorely Rodriguez asks within the opening moments of her debut album, Me. If clarity is what she seeks, Lorely has found it: her voice upfront, every word audible and strong. Her singular voice is the centerpiece of Me, her first full-formed vision of an album, following her previously shorter and more abstract releases as Empress Of. “Don’t tell me who I am,” she sings seconds later. Where her previous recordings worked in moody abstractions, layered soundscapes hinting at a voice deep under the surface, Me plays out like diary entries from one female voice musing on the personal, the political, and all the middle ground between. Bringing to life her unique blend of deeply personal yet incredibly celebratory dance music. However, “this record…it’s about me,” Lorely adds. “It’s very much about my experiences. I learned how to let my voice out through this record. I learned how to record, how to produce. I learned how to write way better songs. I didn’t realize this until I was almost done with it, but it was all about growth, and all about kind of being selfish and taking time for myself to really understand what events in my life have shaped me as a person.”\n\nFile Under: Synth Pop\n\nListen Here\n\nFaith No More: The Real Thing (Rhino) LP\n\nIn celebration of the release of Sol Invictus, Faith No More’s first new album in nearly 20 years, Rhino Records is reissuing the back-to-back classic albums that helped establish the band’s vital and visceral musical legacy with Deluxe Editions of The Real Thing and Angel Dust. Each album will be offered as a 2LP-set with the original release accompanied by a second disc filled with rarities related to the album. Like all bands who transcended their time to become cornerstones of an era, Faith No More sounded like nobody else. The group’s commercial breakthrough came in 1989 with the release of The Real Thing. It was the band’s third album, but the first to feature the line-up of Mike Bordin (drums), Roddy Bottum (keyboards), Bill Gould (bass), Jim Martin (guitars), and Mike Patton (vocals). The album was incredibly diverse, yet every song was linked by the band’s own developing style. It peaked at #11 on the charts and was certified platinum, spawning the singles, “From Out Of Nowhere” and “Falling To Pieces,” as well as “Epic,” which was ubiquitous on radio and MTV. The bonus disc puts a different spin on many of the album tracks with a remixed version of “Falling To Pieces,” by Matt Wallace as well as live performances of “Surprise! You’re Dead!,” “Underwater Love,” and the Black Sabbath classic “War Pigs.” The cut “Sweet Emotion” from Kerrang! Flexible Fiend is also included.\n\nFile Under: Rock\n\nListen Here\n\nFaith No More: Angel Dust (Rhino) LP\n\nIn celebration of the release of Sol Invictus, Faith No More’s first new album in nearly 20 years, Rhino Records is reissuing the back-to-back classic albums that helped establish the band’s vital and visceral musical legacy with Deluxe Editions of The Real Thing and Angel Dust.

After extensive touring, the band returned in 1992 with Angel Dust. It climbed to #10 on the U.S. album charts and would later be recognized as one of the most influential releases of the era. The album swings between extremes-aggressive and disturbing, but also beautiful and soothing-showing off every facet of the band’s quirky eloquence on such diverse tracks as “Midlife Crisis,” “Jizzlobber,” “R.V.” and “Small Victory.” Among the eight tracks featured on the bonus disc is a mix of “Midlife Crisis” by the band’s longtime producer Matt Wallace, a trio of live recordings from a concert in Munich, Germany, as well as a covers of the Dead Kennedys’ “Let’s Lynch The Landlord.”\n\nFile Under: Rock\n\nListen Here\n\nFidlar: Too (Mom & Pop) LP\n\nToo is the second full length from Fidlar. Produced by Jay Joyce, Too was recorded in Nashville over the span of just two weeks. The 12-song collection of pop-infused garage rock expands on the band’s 2013 self-titled album that put them at the forefront of modern punk music. The new album showcases a band that continues to fine-tune its sonic approach while also highlighting a more introspective and revelatory approach to songwriting. It also marks the first time the band has worked with a producer. “We could have made record number one again…but instead we decided to challenge ourselves and admit that we don’t know everything,” said guitarist and lead vocalist Zac Carper. “Up until this point we had recorded everything ourselves, so working with a producer taught us so much. I didn’t want to make a standard rock record. The goal for this album was to think outside the box and I think Jay really helped us do that.” The band unveiled the first taste of new music from Too via a music video for the album’s leading track and first single “40oz. On Repeat/” Directed by Ryan Baxley, the must-watch video is a hilarious “Be Kind Rewind” tribute to past music video masterpieces, sure to conjure loving nostalgia for anyone who came of age during the glory years of MTV’s afternoon video countdown show Total Request Live. “In the late 90s and early 2000s, music videos were such a huge deal,” adds Carper. “We decided that instead of making one overly slick music video, we would nod to 15 of our favorite music videos that we grew up with. Everyone in the band threw in their ideas.”\n\nFile Under: Indie Rock\n\nListen Here\n\nJulia Holter: Have You In My Wilderness (Domino) LP\n\nHave You In My Wilderness is Julia Holter’s most intimate album yet, a collection of radiant ballads. Her follow-up to 2013’s widely celebrated Loud City Song explores love, trust, and power in human relationships. While love songs are familiar fodder in pop music, Holter manages to stay fascinatingly oblique and enigmatic on her new album. Have You in My Wilderness is also Holter’s most sonically intimate album. Here, she and producer Cole Marsden Greif-Neill lift her voice out of the layers of smeared, hazy effects, putting her vocals front and center in the mix. The result is striking—it sounds as if Holter is singing right in your ear. It sounds clear and vivid, but also disarmingly personal. The focused warm sound and instrumentation — dense strings, subtle synth pads — adds to the effect. Like Holter’s previous albums, Have You in My Wilderness is multi-layered and texturally rich, featuring an array of electronic and acoustic instruments played by an ensemble of gifted Los Angeles musicians. Have You In My Wilderness deals with dark themes, but it also features some of the most sublime and transcendent music Holter has ever written. The ten songs on the album are shimmering and dreamlike, wandering the liminal space between the conscious and the subconscious.\n\nFile Under: Electronic, Pop\n\nListen Here\n\nKhemmis: Absolution (20 Buck Spin) LP\n\nOver the course of the last ten years 20 Buck Spin has worked with the best of the best in the crowded doom genre—bands as diverse as Samothrace, Graves At Sea, Pallbearer, YOB, Mournful Congregation, Lycus, Atlantean Kodex, etc. In that tradition, the label is proud to present Khemmis from Denver, Colorado, who brings together components of many of the aforementioned label alumni to forge a venerable testament to what heavy doom rock is in 2015. The six meticulously crafted songs on Absolution reveal a level of musicianship and writing skill seldom heard on debut albums. Often within the scope of a single song Khemmis veers effortlessly between the crushing heaviness of Southern sludge and the somber melodicism of traditional doom, cohesively weaving the disparate styles into their own immediately recognizable form. The band incorporates dual vocals, sometimes harsh, but mostly via a stunningly smooth classic doom / heavy rock style that even adamant fans of Pete Stahl and Wino will applaud. The powerfully adept rhythm section perfectly anchors the towering riff mastery and colorful dual guitar harmonies, all brought together by Dave Otero’s (Cobalt, Nightbringer) pitch-perfect production work. Khemmis is most certainly a live act and will tour at intervals throughout the remainder of 2015 including a planned West Coast run in Summer 2015.\n\nFile Under: Metal\n\nListen Here\n\nMetric: Pagans in Vegas (Metric) LP\n\nPagans in Vegas is the sixth full-length album from Canadian rock band Metric. In an effort to translate the gratifying experience of discovering an artist you love, Metric has packed their new album with reverent references to artists who’ve inspired them, from Depeche Mode to Joy Division and Underworld. Frontwoman Emily Haines explains that it was about finding “the romance of another time without falling into nostalgia.” The concept is also perfectly captured on the album’s cover, which features a shot of Memphis’ Hotel Chisca, the spot where Elvis Presley did his first broadcast interview. But despite a few glances in the rearview, Pagans in Vegas stitches together its acoustic and synthetic foundations with a crisp, unique now-ness that captures the quandaries of life in an age where bad news is unavoidable and great art is a life-saver. “With this record we were making music for the joy of it,” says guitarist and producer James Shaw. “We’re still in the game as musicians and people, although the game has gotten increasingly unrecognizable to us.” Pagans in Vegas will be the first of two new albums from Metric, with the second expected in 2016. Their time spent writing in 2014 – Shaw at his studio in Toronto, delving into the CS80 synth and Haines with acoustic instruments in Nicaragua and Spain – yielded an unprecedented amount of material that revealed itself across at least two major musical veins. Realizing they had composed enough music for two very different albums, they decided to let each collection of songs stand on their own.\n\nFile Under: Indie Rock, CanCon\n\nListen Here\n\nMicachu & The Shapes: Good Sad Happy Bad (Rough Trade) LP\n\nThree years after the release of their last record, Micachu & The Shapes’ return is almost an accident: the trio of friends decided to rehearse in an East London studio and found themselves immersed into an hours-long jam. Drummer Marc Pell had an Edirol field recorder in hand, and unbeknownst to his bandmates, recorded the whole session; Bell, Mica Levi, and Raisa Khan were so enamored of those off-the-cuff audio experiments that they became the underpinnings of a new record. “For me it’s the most free we have been,” Levi explains. Rather than showing up to the studio with songs written out, the trio started with a collaborative improvisation, from which Levi chose sections to develop into songs, writing lyrics to the entire record “non-stop, in one avalanche.” With one listen, it’s easy to hear why they loved the tracks. Good Sad Happy Bad maintains the experimental-pop sensibility the band has brought to previous efforts, combining the lightness and bounce of their best singles with the sonic textures of field recordings, industrial effects alongside straightforward instrumentation. Levi’s affected vocals eschew easily readable emotional tone, instead relying on quixotic lyricism, repetition, and immersion into the song’s landscape, to evoke warmly – rather than show – the sentiments underpinning the songs. Conversely, because the band worked out the final mixes together over a number of months – rather than in a traditional, multi-track studio over a shorter period – Pell found a new degree of creativity. “I think the best drum part I have ever written is the stick-clicking at the beginning of “Peach” – a moment, he explains, that he wouldn’t have been able to notice without the luxury of seeing the recorded tracks as more than simply songs, but as collections of sonic ideas. In the years since the band’s last work together, Levi’s star in the world of modern composition has risen, due in large part to her work on Jonathan Glazer’s standout 2014 film, Under the Skin, whose eerie depth is due in large part to Levi’s precise, otherworldly score, for which she won a European Film Award and was nominated for a BAFTA.\n\nFile Under: Rock\n\nListen Here\n\nMiguel: Wildheart (RCA) LP\n\nGrammy Award winning recording artist Miguel first hit the mainstream in 2010 with the infectious first single “All I Want Is You,” from his major label debut album of the same name, a song which blended a stark hip-hop beat with the singer’s creamy vocals to form a sound that was absent from the radio and established Miguel as one of the most unique and soulful voices in modern R&B. The album also featured “Sure Thing,” which hit #1 on Billboard’s Hip-Hop/R&B chart and second US #1 “Quickie.” Miguel’s follow up was his critically-acclaimed, four-time Grammy Award nominated, sophomore album Kaleidoscope Dream, which featured his third US #1 hit single “Adorn,” the intoxicating “How Many Drinks?,” “Do You…” and “The Thrill.” In 2013 Miguel was nominated for a total of 5 Grammy Awards. Lead single “Adorn,” written and produced by Miguel, garnered his first Grammy Award for Best R&B Song and resided at #1 on the R&B/Hip-Hip Airplay chart for more than 23 weeks becoming the longest running #1 in the chart’s history. Miguel makes his welcome return in 2015 with his highly anticipated third studio effort, Wildheart, due out on ByStorm Entertainment/RCA Records and preceded by the lead single “Coffee.” The album also boasts guest appearances by Kurupt and Lenny Kravitz. This 180g 2LP Deluxe Edition includes a handful of bonus tracks including “Gfg,” “Damned” and new mix of the song “Simple Things.”\n\nFile Under: Hip Hop, Soul\n\nListen Here\n\nNew Order: Music Complete (Mute) LP\n\nMusic Complete finds the group revitalized, and where the group has previously pushed toward electronics or guitars, here the two are in balance. Music Complete also marks a return to the studio for Gillian Gilbert; this is her first album with New Order since 2001’s Get Ready. Music Complete is produced by New Order, except ‘Singularity’ and ‘Unlearn This Hatred’, both produced by Tom Rowlands (Chemical Brothers), while ‘Superheated’ features additional production by Stuart Price (Madonna, The Killers, New Order). Long-term collaborator Peter Saville (Factory Records) provides art direction.\n\nFile Under: Electronic, Rock\n\nListen Here\n\nOught: Sun Coming Down (Constellation) LP\n\nOught returns with their second full-length album Sun Coming Down, following a break-out year for the Montréal-based rock quartet that saw its 2014 debut More Than Any Other Day make well-deserved waves for its blend of authentic, anxious, controlled and restive energy, with a Best New Music nod from Pitchfork and appearances on a wide range of year-end lists. Having spent most of 2014 on the road vitalizing audiences with no-nonsense post-punk and the feverishly observational testifying of singer/guitarist Tim Darcy (who officially changed his name from Tim Beeler this year), Ought settled into a long harsh Montreal winter hibernation, spending the first few months of 2015 writing, playing the occasional local gig, and eventually heading back to the Hotel2Tango recording studio in the spring to lay down a batch of fresh tunes. Sun Coming Down maintains the band’s tight, twitchy and economical sound, with the unfussy, understated rhythm section of drummer Tim Keen and bassist Ben Stidworthy anchoring Tim Darcy’s electric guitar and Matt May’s fuzzed-out keys (sounding, as often as not, like a second guitar). Ought pursue an artistically apposite austerity in committing these new songs to tape, referencing the arid and unvarnished production of no-wave and early indie rock while balancing carved-out angularity against an evolving comfort with textural coalescences and measured pacing. It makes for an album that’s consistently, insistently propulsive but also feels unhurried and pleasantly unhyped. Songs like “Beautiful Blue Sky” (already a fan favorite from live shows) and “Never Better” unfold with gradual and deliberate ebb and flow, where scratchy guitars play like dappled shards of light on gently roiling waves of bass and organ; “The Combo” and “Celebration” keep things crisp and concise. Darcy’s voice and lyrics continue to distinguish and define the personality of the band: his blend of ironic detachment, declarative insistence, fragmentary stammering poetics, and the occasional direct aside to the listener, finds various ways to weave within or drive through the mixes. Sun Coming Down confirms the distinctive vitality and purposive naturalism of this band; Ought resists facile primitivism and overhyped dynamics in equal measure, keeping things hermetic but never airless, ascetic but never dispassionate, literate but never prolix. The band’s steady and subtle charms don’t make them the cool kids or the iconoclastic freaks – just a satisfyingly unrefined and substantive rock band that eschews indulgence or aesthetic bandwagoneering to seek a humble, thoughtful corner from which to articulate a position within and contribute meaningfully to a 40-year continuum of indie, punk and DIY tradition.\n\nFile Under: Punk, Indie, CanCon\n\nListen Here\n\nKurt Vile: B’Lieve I’m Goin’ Down (Matador) 2LP\n\nIn tomorrow? Kurt Vile does his own myth making; a boy/man with an old soul voice in the age of digital everything becoming something else, which is why his sixth full-length record and first in two years – the focused, brilliantly clear and seemingly candid B’lieve I’m Goin Down… is a breath of fresh air. Recorded and mixed in a number of locations, including Los Angeles and Joshua Tree, the album is a handshake across the country, East to West coast, through the dustbowl history of Woody honest straight forward talk Guthrie, and a Cali canyon dead still night floating in a nearly waterless landscape. The record is all air, weightless, bodyless, but grounded in convincing authenticity, in the best version of singer songwriter upcycling. Capturing Vile both deeply introspective and briskly self-assured, he explains: “I wanted to get back into the habit of writing a sad song on my couch, with nobody waiting on me. I really wanted it to sound like it’s on my couch – not in a lo-fi way, just more unguarded and vulnerable.” “It’s a weird, accepting, mature record, acknowledging the inherent immaturity of being a person whether father, husband, partner, adult, musician, not perfect, but compelling for its understanding…that’s life though so sad to say…” – Kim Gordon\n\nFile Under: Indie Rock, Stoner Folk\n\nListen Here\n\n…..restocks…..\n\nAction Bronson: Mr. Wonderful (Atlantic) LP\n\nA$AP Rocky: Long.
