        "text": "A Sneak Peek...\n\nDespite being the band's second album, it is actually considered as the first album, since the first album\n\n\"We Care A Lot\" came out in a very limited number of copies by a small independent record company\n\nnamed Mordam Records, which also did not promote or advertise the album commercially.\n\nAfter the first album, the band moved to a larger record company and signed a contract with the record label \"Slash Records\" (it has nothing to do with a guitar player), which ensured it greater exposure and greater support for success.\n\nThe album which was out on April 23rd, 1987 features 10 songs all written by drummer Mike Bordin, keyboardist Roddy Bottum, bassist Billy Gould guitarist Jim Martin and singer Chuck Mosley.\n\nSpeaking of Chuck, this is his last album with the band. After the release of the album, the band went on a tour to promote the album as an opening act for the band \"Red Hot Chili Peppers\" (yes, before the fight between Mike Patton and Anthony Kiedis). During the tour Chuck's drug addiction got worse which made his behavior unstable, he would lose consciousness or fight with the other band members during the show.\n\n(Photo: Tony Mottram)\n\nThe highlight came at the launch party organized by the record company on the album's release. During the party, Chuck's condition began to deteriorate until he reached a state where he lost consciousness and fell asleep on stage during the show.\n\nAnother story that ended the band's affair with Chuck is related to the fact that after the show Chuck decided that the band should release an acoustic album. At that point, the other members had enough so they fired him from the band.\n\nThe first single from the album \"We Care A Lot\" was still written and released on the first album, but was reworked and recorded again with different lyrics for this album. It became a big hit that formed the starting point of the band's breakthrough. By the way, the single was released again in 1991, after Mike Patton joined, and it came out in a live performance version.\n\nListen to the album on Spotify, Apple Music\n\nFollow us on Facebookor Subscribe to our website"
