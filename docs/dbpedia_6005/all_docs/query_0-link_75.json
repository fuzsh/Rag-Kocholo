        "text": "We are very pleased announce that Jürgen Overhoff will serve as the 2022 Max Kade Visiting Professor. Professor Overhoff teaches the history of education and specializes in German-American relations at the University of Muenster. He has written books on Benjamin Franklin, as well as a comparison between Frederick the Great and George Washington. His other books include a collection of essays on the Catholic Enlightenment in Germany and North America, as well as many essays on eighteenth-century German-American topics.\n\nProfessor Overhoff will hold the following talks:\n\n“German and American Ecological Awareness: Understanding Sustainability and Climate Change from Benjamin Franklin to today”\n\nTuesday, March 22, 2022 5:30-6:30 PM, in 157 Burrowes Building\n\nCo-sponsored by the Schreyer’s Honors College\n\nhttps://www.shc.psu.edu/events/item.cfm?id=10172\n\nProfessor Jürgen Overhoff will compare German and American environmental policy today while showing that worry about the impact humans have on nature has long been part of Pennsylvania history. Benjamin Franklin, the founding father, was very concerned about the dangers of man-made climate change and was focused on sustainability. As a scientist, he cultivated a deep understanding of natural processes and warned that it humans interfered with the natural world, we had to be “very circumspect lest we do more harm than Good.” His concerns can form the basis for American and German environmental policy as we face the risks of modern science in the Anthropocene.\n\nPrussia’s Hidden Slaves: The Lives of Africans in Berlin and\n\nKönigsberg in the Eighteenth Century\n\nFriday, March 25, 2022, 10:00 AM\n\nThe Grucci Room, Burrowes Building,\n\nCo-sponsored by the College of the Liberal Arts Dean’s Office\n\nhttps://sites.psu.edu/racetheoryconference/\n\n“Frederick the Great, George Washington and Prussian-American\n\nRelations in the Eighteenth Century: Two Concepts of Enlightenment”\n\nMonday, March 28, 2022, 4:00-5:30 PM in 102 Weaver Building\n\nDr. Johannes Schülein (Spring 2018) serves as a research associate in philosophy at the University of Bochum and the book review editor for the journal, Hegel-Studien. His first book on the critique of metaphysics in Hegel and Derrida appeared in 2016 with Meiners Verlag. In addition to his research on Hegel, Dr. Schülein has written on metaphysics in German Romanticism, Schelling and Spinoza. As the Max Kade Visiting Professor, Dr. Schülein, lectured on “The Logic of Difference: Reconsidering Derrida’s Critique of Hegel” while contributing also to a Philosophy Department workshop on Schelling’s later philosophy (after the so-called Freedom Essay of 1809.\n\nDr. Walter Demel (Spring 2015) served as Professor for Early Modern History at the Bundeswehr University in Munich, where he has also served as Dean and University Ombudsman.

His research examines European perceptions of East Asia during the early modern period, the emergence of race theories, and the history of the German aristocracy. His important essay on “How the Chinese became yellow” tracing the development of European reports about East Asia established a new field of study. Over the last twenty-five years, Professor Demel has continued to write extensively on the history of German-, Chinese-, and Japanese relations. In February 2015, he came to Penn State as the Max Kade Visiting Professor to hold a workshop on China and Japan in Early Western Racial Theories.\n\nDr. Gita Dharampal-Frick (Fall 2013): Gita Dharampal-Frick acquired an interdisciplinary academic training in German literature, philosophy (Manchester, England and Leipzig, East Germany), social anthropology (Cambridge, England) and Indian cultural history (SOAS, London and Paris, Sorbonne, PhD 1980), and completed her Habilitation (= German professorial dissertation) in early modern history (Freiburg, Germany in 1992). Her published research into pre- and early colonial European documentation on India underscores the continuities and discontinuities between early proto-ethnography and later scientific Indology. She has also researched (as a Heisenberg Fellow) into modernizing processes and resistance movements in post-independence India. Her current interests, as Head of the Department of History at the South Asia Institute, University of Heidelberg, deal with topics ranging from maritime cultural history of the Indian Ocean region (1400-1800), medical history, gender studies, religio-ritual transformations (1500-2000) and the socio-cultural and political history of the colonial period, in general, with a special emphasis on Gandhi’s movement of political and cultural resurgence.
