        "text": "The elegant state Baden-Württemberg, composed after the war in 1952, is considered a constituent Land of the Federal Republic.\n\nBaden-Württemberg Map\n\nStuttgart, its capital, is by far the largest city of this ethnically flourishing state that borders on France along the Rhine in the west and on Switzerland in the south, with Lake Constance (Bodensee) right “on” that border.\n\nBaden-Württemberg has one of the main and most speckled tourist areas of Germany, the outstanding Neckar valley with its stunning Odenwald, the calm Black Forest and lakes in the south, and the famous spas of Baden-Baden and Bad Wildbad.\n\nFreiburg and Heidelberg have well-noted universities. The all year climatic condition helps you to enjoy the spots all around. In Baden-Württemberg, the local brews are sweeter and softer, in order to appeal to palates familiar to wine.\n\nStuttgart and Mannheim are the main manufacture centers, while Karlsruhe serves as being Home of German Justice.\n\nBut the environment that invites people to Baden-Württemberg the most is still the Black Forest, which is well-known for its romantic valley meadows, mills, farms, and ravines. It is also known for its cuckoo clocks and skiing.\n\nWinter sports are customary around the Feldberg (height 1,493m or 4,898ft), where you can have skiing and snowboarding in addition. It is the uppermost mountain in the Black Forest.\n\nBaden-Württemberg is also called the “Nine Stars of the Southwest of Germany.” No matter if you have come for business or pleasure, you will find innumerable things to see and do around. Its cities offer a wide range of cultural actions, art, shopping and beer and wine fair.\n\nAnd it is Germany’s main location for spa festivals. You can take pleasure in whole relaxation in this place. After getting calm, you can go to one of the region’s first-rate cultural attraction. Right from the jazz festivals to classical concerts of ballet, open-air museums, exhibitions and theatre performances. You can also find art and culture of the maximum calibre all through this region.\n\nAlso remember to visit many of the fortress and palaces makes you go back in the past and find out about the lives of the nobility in former times.\n\nIn the east of this amazing state, you can find the rugged Swabian Alb. It is ever lasting scenery full of small towns, beech forests and juniper groves, conquered by numerous caves, ruins and fortress.\n\nIn 1949, the basic law in German Federation had the power to decide the fortune of the lands. To avoid this, all the three lands agreed to a trial vote, held on September 24, 1950. Finally the result went in favor of the pre-war borders.\n\nThe varied and amusing nature spots of Baden-Württemberg retain you to bounce back towards her again. :-)"
