        "text": "Before moving to Germany, you need to know what you can expect. Who are you, and what type of accommodation are you looking for during your stay? In larger cities, where you’ll find many of the international internships and expat jobs, flats and apartment buildings quite common. On the local market you’ll often find that a landlord will rent out a place in an unfurnished state, as this is common among the Germans themselves. If you’re an international who’s not bringing their family along for the ride, you might as well look for housing providers and landlords who offer furnished housing.\n\nRooms\n\nA mainstay among students and interns, you’ll find plenty of opportunity to rent a room in Germany. Rooms can be anywhere, from inside a privately owned house, in a (shared) flat or apartment to dedicated student housing buildings. Subletting is also quite common in Germany, which might be an easy and affordable option for you if your stay is relatively short. Apartment sharing is very popular among younger Germans and internationals and is known as Wohngemeinschaft (or WG for short). So if you’re looking for a room, while also building up your social network in Germany, this could be your way to go!\n\nStudios\n\nIf you’re moving to Germany on a slightly larger budget or for a longer period of time, a studio might be your housing of choice. As you have your own kitchen and bathroom, this is a great option for people who appreciate their privacy. Additionally, studios tend to be quite a bit larger than rooms, so you also have more opportunities to make the space your own. Make sure you talk to the landlord before you paint all the walls your favourite shade of purple, though. When you leave, landlords often require you to return your place to the state you found it in.\n\nApartments\n\nIf you’re making serious moves in your career and you’re moving to Germany for the long term, you might consider renting an entire apartment for yourself. Apartments and flats in Germany can be quite spacious, offering you enough room to bring your significant other or family. Additionally, you could turn to subletting rooms in your apartment yourself, if you‘d otherwise be staying alone. This can help you make a little money on the side, while building up a bit of a social circle at the same time.\n\nRental prices in Germany\n\nTo give you an idea of what kind of rental payments you can expect during your stay, here’s a brief overview of the annual average rental prices for rooms, studios and 1-bedroom apartments across Germany, as well as a look at the prices in the German capital, Berlin. In general, capitals like Berlin are on the more expensive side, but keep in mind that Berlin has some rental legislation in place that is not present in other large German cities.\n\nThe following data is based on homes that were actually rented out and includes monthly bills.\n\nAverage rental price 2019-2020Rooms(bills included)Studio(bills included)Apartments (bills included)Germany€ 499 (100%)€ 760 (100%)€ 893 (100%)Berlin€ 574€ 873€ 1086 (121%)Munich€ 686€ 1031€ 1523 (170%)\n\nHow much does student accommodation cost in Germany?\n\nAccording to the data from HousingAnywhere, students should, on average, expect to pay between €499-599 for a room, up to €873 for a more private studio. Do keep in mind that some housing providers might be more expensive than regular landlords, but offer additional services, such as regular cleaning, Wifi, Netflix subscriptions and other extras facilities that are included in that higher price. So, depending on whether you want to save yourself time and effort, you could choose to rent a place on the lower or higher side of the average price spectrum. For most students, an apartment is outside of the budget. However, you could consider looking for a room for rent inside a shared apartment. In Germany, this is referred to as Wohngemeinschaft (WG) and it’s a very popular option among German students.\n\nThe convenient and dense public transport network in Germany takes you quickly and reliably to every corner of the country. In fact, the efficient train system is one of the best ones in Europe! As an integrated transport association (Verkehrsbund), your ticket is valid across any mode of transport. Take the bus and jump on the next underground, no need to draw a new ticket!\n\nBus services\n\nAny city’s reliable companion. The typically extensive network gets you to any corner of a city.\n\nUnderground (U-Bahn) services\n\nLiving in the center? The underground will be your new companion. In the most convenient and efficient manner, it’ll get you anywhere at regular intervals.\n\nSuburban train (S-Bahn) services\n\nThe train with the green and white symbol covers the vastest network within a region. Just wait for the S-Bahn and it’ll pick you up from the city center and bring you to your suburb!\n\n(Inter)regional train services\n\nAlongside the public transportation within a city, you can cross the country with the regional train (RE/RB/IRE) and the high-speed train (ICE/IC) in the blink of an eye. From Frankfurt to Berlin in 3 hours? Easy with DB. What’s a car again?"
