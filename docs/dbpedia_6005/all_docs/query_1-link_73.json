        "text": "German License Plates have the following basic format:\n\nGerman License Plate\n\nFLAG: In this case, we are displaying the European Union Flag. Of course, we have many different flags to choose from. Check out our selection of flags on the European License Plates page, as well as the US Euro-Style Flags and the larger US European License Plates.\n\nCOUNTRY: The \"D\" is for \"Deutschland\" or Germany. Of course, as mentioned above, we have several countries to choose from on the European License Plates page, US Euro-Style License Plates and the larger US European License Plates.\n\nCITY/REGION: The first 1-3 letters in the city/region prefix code generally reflect the size of the district (there are exceptions). The basic idea was to even out the number of digits on all license plates, because the largest districts would have more digits after the prefix for more cars. The largest German cities generally only have one letter codes (B=Berlin, M=Munich, K=Cologne (Köln), F=Frankfurt, L=Leipzig, S=Stuttgart), most other districts in Germany have two or three letter codes. Therefore, cities or districts with fewer letters are generally assumed to be bigger and more important.\n\nSEALS: There are two seals. The lower sticker is the official seal of registration of the respective German State. The upper, green sticker is the vehicle safety inspection sticker, where the black indicates the month that the inspection expires. Both types of stickers (they come as a set) can be found on the Registration Seals page.\n\nRANDOM LETTERS & NUMBERS: This is pretty self explanatory. There must be some characters that allow for different vehicles to have a unique license number in each of the city/regions. There are usually 1-2 random letters followed by 1-4 random numbers. The total number of letters and numbers on the plate is never higher than eight.\n\nWhile there is a comprehensive list of cities/region codes below, we will first list a few of our favorites:\n\nRegistration Seals\n\nFor each of the following, we carry a copy of the actual Registration Seal for that particular city, region or code.\n\nB - Berlin Buy the Berlin Registration Seal Set BD - Federal German government vehicles (Bundestag / Bundesrat / Bundesrepublik Deutschland) Buy the German Government Registration Seal Set HH - Hamburg Buy the Hamburg Registration Seal M - Munich (München), Bavaria Home of BMW Buy the Bayern Registration Seal Set RPL - Rhineland Palatinate State (Rheinland-Pfalz Land) official vehicles Buy the Rheinland-Pfalz Registration Seal Set S - Stuttgart Home of Mercedes and Porsche Buy the Stuttgart Registration Seal Set WOB - Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony Home of Volkswagens Buy the Wolfsburg Registration Seal Set AD - US Military in Germany Buy the US Military Registration Seal Set\n\nOfficial Vehicles\n\nHere are some codes for official vehicles in Germany:\n\n0 Diplomatic vehicles AD US Military Vehicles in Germany BD Federal German government vehicles (Bundestag / Bundesrat / Bundesrepublik Deutschland) BG Border police vehicles (Bundesgrenzschutz) BP Postal authority vehicles (Bundespost) BW Maritime authority vehicles (Bundes-Wasser- und Schiffahrtsverwaltung) DB Rail authority vehicles (Deutsche Bundesbahn) THW German Federal Agency for Technical Relief (Technisches Hilfswerk) vehicles X NATO Forces vehicles Y Armed Forces vehicles (Bundeswehr)\n\nState Vehicles\n\nHere are some codes for various State vehicles in Germany:\n\nBBL Brandenburg Land official vehicles BWL Badem-Württemberg Land official vehicles BYL Bavaria State (Bayern Land) official vehicles HEL Hesse State (Hesse Land) official vehicles LSA Saxony Anhalt State (Sachsen-Anhalt Land) official vehicles LSN Saxony State (Sachsen Land) official vehicles MVL Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Land official vehicles NL Lower Saxony State (Niedersachsen Land) official vehicles NRW North-Rhine-Westphalia State (Nordrhein-Westfalen Land) official vehicles RPL Rhineland Palatinate State (Rheinland-Pfalz Land) official vehicles RWL North-Rhine-Westphalia State (Nordrhein-Westfalen Land) official vehicles SAL Saarland official vehicles SH Schleswig-Holstein Land official vehicles THL Thuringia State (Thüringen Land) official vehicles\n\nMajor Cities\n\nHere are some codes for various cities in Germany:\n\nB Berlin D Düsseldorf F Frankfurt H Hannover HH Hamburg IN Ingolstadt, Home of Audi K Köln / Cologne M Munich (München), Home of BMW S Stuttgart, Home of Mercedes & Porsche WOB Wolfsburg, Home of VW\n\nAlphabetical List of German City Codes\n\nAnd now for the monster list..."
