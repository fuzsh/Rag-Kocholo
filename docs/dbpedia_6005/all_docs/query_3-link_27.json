        "text": "Things to do in Munich\n\nAbout Munich\n\nWhile traveling throughout Germany, the Bavarian city of Munich is a must see. The vibe and look of the city is so different from Berlin, Hamburg or Frankfurt. To gain the authentic German experience, hop over to Munich. The city is well-known for being the home to the ever-famous Oktoberfest. If you are not traveling during the festival, don’t fear because there are so many different things to do within and around the city that will keep you busy.\n\nPlaces of Interest in Munich\n\nThe city’s most well-known building is the New Town Hall located in Marienplatz which is the central square in Munich. The Glockenspiel (or a real-life cuckoo-clock) sounds at 11 am, noon and at sometimes of the year 5 pm. The not as impressive Old Town Hall also lies off Marienplatz. Stop by both to compare the differences in architecture and decide which one you prefer.\n\nThe Cathedral Church of Our Dear Lady is located near the Marienplatz. In late Gothic style, experience a church that withstood both World Wars and has been lovingly renovated in years since. If you want to see something otherworldly, look for the Devil’s Footprint on the floor of the church. Assam Church is most likely different than any other church you have ever come across. Originally meant to be a private church, the Assam brothers built a unique and enthralling Baroque-styled church. This church almost seems like a secret hidden in plain sight the way it blends in with the surrounding buildings.\n\nMunich Residenz began as a castle and eventually became a place of government. Now it is open to the public as a museum displaying royal apartments, grand rooms as well as rotating exhibits. If the weather is pleasant, enjoy a picnic or stroll around the Court Garden. The admission prices vary for the Munich Residenz depending on which rooms you’d like to explore. Look at your schedule and budget beforehand so you can make the best choice for you.\n\nIn the West of Munich, you will find the Schloss Nymphenburg, which was once the summer home for Bavarian royalty but is now open for all visitors no matter their royal status.\n\nCulture and History of Munich\n\nProbably the reason you were drawn to Munich as a travel destination was its reputation as a beer haven with many sprawling beer gardens or Biergärten in German. If you’re nodding your head, “yes – take me to the beer” then Hofbräuhaus should be your starting point. Hofbräuhaus is one of the most famous breweries in the world. Here you will see people of all ages (honestly mostly tourists) enjoying a good brew and snack. Be aware that when visiting Hofbräuhaus you are also paying for the experience, so you expect to pay more than normal for a beer or meal.\n\nViktualienmarkt (or victuals market in English) is a wonderful food market located near Marienplatz. There everyone will be able to find something to snack on or bring home. Unlike some other food markets, Viktualienmarkt is more like a farmer’s market where you will find fresh produce and meats rather than meals.\n\nSurrounding Areas of Munich\n\nIt’s unlikely that you’ll run out of things to do while in Munich, but if you have some extra time think about heading outside of the city for the afternoon or day.\n\nIf you and your travel crew are more of the adventurous type, head two hours into the Alps to Kehlsteinhaus, meaning Eagle's Nest, in English. This building was a birthday present for Adolf Hitler meant to be a quiet mountain retreat and diplomatic meeting point. However, it was only used on a few occasions due to Hitler's fear of heights and fear that lightning would strike the lift leading up to the Eagle's Nest. Today the building holds a restaurant to lift the spirits of hungry hikers, and the proceeds are given to charity.\n\nFinally, the second reason you probably are planning a trip through Bavaria -Schloss Neuschwanstein. You can even take FlixBus between Munich and Schwangau, which only takes 2 hours! This is the castle that inspired Cinderella’s castle at Walt Disney World. The craziest thing about this castle is that it was meant to house only one person, King Ludwig II who was thought to be a mad king stuck in a fairy-tale world. When you visit the castle, you will experience the amazing magic that the king wove into the many rooms of the castle.\n\nBuses to Munich\n\nFind the most affordable buses to Munich\n\nWith FlixBus, it’s easy to travel to Munich, as 402 rides are available starting from only $5.49 depending on the departure city, date and time.
