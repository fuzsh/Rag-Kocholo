        "text": "Hello Everyone, I was wondering if anyone had some advice for me on an upcoming trip I am taking to southern Germany in December. I have booked a flight into Stuttgart Germany arriving at 10:30am on a Friday morning, and a flight out of Munich at 10am on Monday morning. This leaves me we close to 3 full days in the Blackforest/Bavaria area and I could really use some guidance to know if I am making the right choices here :) To make things even more difficult, I am hoping to complete this journey without spending more than $700 USD after flights... From my research a rental car with insurance will cost me somewhere around $300USD for the 3 full days that I have it... so that leaves $400 for food/gas/hotels/and touring... can it be done? lol If this information helps: I would love this trip to have a romantic flair, I am going with my girlfriend and we are both in our 20's. Heres my initial thoughts on the trip: Friday- 10:30-3pm arrive in Stuttgart and explore the city... Then head to Tubingen or a similar smaller city for the \"Christmas Markets\" We want to have a full experience with the christmas markets.. (any advice here).... Find a hotel in this area to stay for the night.. hopefully around $60USD.. Saturday: Tour part of the black forest and small towns within in the morning/early afternoon... then head to Neuschwanstein area for the evening... Find a hotel in this area (any suggestions for authentic fun experiences) Sunday: Tour Neuschwanstein castle in the morning... then head to Munich to spend the rest of sunday in the city, again hopefully experiencing a fun christmas market. Find a cheaper hotel that is still clean/has a good location in Munich. Monday morning: 10am Fly home Thank you in advance for all of your help!!! Sincerely,\n\nWilliam"
