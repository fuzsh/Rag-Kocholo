        "text": "RouteXpert Review\n\nThis is the first route of a multi-day trip through the Alps, called Alpentoertje. I rode the route in six days with quite long stages. It is easy to share the day routes so that you also have / take time to do more along the route, have a longer lunch or just drive relaxed. For reference I would like to mention that we were with two motorcycles and both have extensive experience with motorcycling also in the mountains.\n\nThis route takes you from the north of the Black Forest to the heart of the Black Forest and avoids many boring highway kilometers towards the Freiburg area. Think of this as an alternative that will require you to schedule some extra time but is well worth leaving home an hour or two early.\n\nJust below Karlsruhe you go off the highway and you arrive at the starting point. You can stop here but also pick up the route at the same time. You drive through the beautiful forests and are immediately treated to lovely rolling bends that are great for the average motorcyclist to loosen up after the (possible) highway kilometers to get to the starting point. You get into your rhythm, feel the stress slide off you and surrender to the joy of motorcycling.\n\nWe ignore the well-known SchwarzwaldhochstraBe and look for the more unknown roads. From Ettlingen we head for the river Alb, which we follow for a while until Bad Herrenalb. In the direction of Loffenau we get the first tighter bends, just short of hairpin bends, after which we leave the main roads for a while and can enjoy peace and quiet via small roads. We head further south to Freudenstadt.\n\nFreudenstadt is located at an altitude of approximately 730 metres. It is the Kreisstadt of the Landkreis Freudenstadt. The city has 23,442 inhabitants. Freudenstadt's main church is the only structure that survived a bombing raid by the Americans followed by artillery shelling by French troops during World War II in April 1945. The rest of the city was reduced to ashes.\n\nAfter Freudenstadt you notice that more altitude meters have to be conquered. And altimeters also means there are waterfalls. In Triberg in Schwarzwald can take a walk to the waterfalls of Triberg. These waterfalls are one of the largest in Germany. The River Gutach meanders through the Black Forest. At the falls, the water of the river falls from a height of 872 meters to a height of 711 meters above NAP. The Gutach runs over a sloping plateau to finally plunge 163 meters in 7 large steps into the V-shaped valley of Triberg.\n\nJust past Schonach im Schwarzwald you will rise above 1,000 meters for the first time. At Waldkirch you start at the first pass of this route, the Kandel-Pass, with a height of 1,241 meters, a length of 24 km and a maximum gradient of 15%. This pass is a nice warm-up for the coming days and a nice end to the first day so we head towards the end point in Oberried at Hotel Goldener Adler for a good meal and a nice drink. Tomorrow fresh up for the second day along the German Alpenstrasse.\n\nTop 5 Car and Motorcycle Routes in the Black Forest\n\nThe Black Forest, who hasn't heard of it? The Black Forest is a densely forested area and low mountain range in southwestern Germany, located in the state of Baden-Württemberg, on the Rhine and the French border. It is the largest low mountain range in Germany. Geologically, it is related to the Vosges Mountains, which lie on the French side of the Rhine. The highest peak of the Black Forest is the Feldberg with a height of 1493 meters above sea level. The Black Forest is the largest forest area in Germany and consists mainly of pine and spruce trees. The Black Forest is known as one of the most popular tourist destinations in Germany. A small part in the north is protected as the Schwarzwald National Park. The Romans called the densely forested mountain range with its distinctive dark conifers Silva Nigra - \"the Black or Dark Forest or impenetrable forest\", which to them was ominous and almost impenetrable. The German word Schwarzwald was used for the first time in a document from the Swiss monastery of St. Gallen from the year 868. A well-known car route is the Schwarzwald-Hochstraße, B 500 and the Uhrenstraße. The Black Forest is known worldwide for the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm.\n\nThere are also several lakes in the Black Forest, namely: Titisee, Glaswaldsee, Mummelsee, Kirnbergsee, Feldsee, Schluchsee and the Hotzenwald.\n\nThe highest peaks in the Black Forest are: Feldberg (1493 m), Seebuck (1448 m), Herzogenhorn (1415 m), Belchen (1414 m), Schauinsland (1284 m), Kandel (1243 m) and the Hornisgrinde (1164 m ).\n\nReason enough for the MyRoute app RouteXpert to compile a Top 5 of Car and Motorcycle Routes for you.\n\nAll routes in this collection have been checked and made equal for TomTom, Garmin and MyRoute-app Navigation by a MyRoute-app RouteXpert.\n\nIf you think, I have a very nice route that should certainly not be missing from this collection, send it to:\n\nemail: routeexpert@myrouteapp.com\n\nSubject: New Route for the Top 5 collection Black Forest composed by Hans van de Ven.\n\nThe route will then be reviewed and then added to the Top 5. To make the Top 5 also the Top 5, 1 route will have to disappear from the Top 5, you can indicate this when submitting the new route.\n\nHave fun with this collection and while driving one of these routes. Enjoy all the beauty that the Black Forest has to offer. Click on “View route” to read the review of the chosen route.\n\nI would like to hear your findings about the route(s).\n\nView Route Collection\n\n5 Routes\n\n1234.21 km\n\n34h 7m"
