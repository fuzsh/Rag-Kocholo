        "text": "It's time for me to look back at the first semester of my master's programme \"Environmental Governance\" at Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg (Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg). üîé I am grateful that I was selected to be part of this year's cohort and to study alongside 33 students from over 20 nations and all continents. The diverse backgrounds and experiences of these talented young people make the program unique - as does their unstoppable will to make the world a better place!üåç The past 20 weeks of classes and exams were dense, from time to time slightly too dense, but they provided me with many new insights and learnings. Over the course of the semester, I worked on various case studies: From the climatic situation and deforestation in Madagascar, over Bangladesh's garment sector, to two German regions (Freiburg-Dietenbach and Lower Spree) where environmental and anthropogenic needs clash. These group projects strengthened my ability to work in teams and taught me how to create scientific posters. In addition, I was challenged to complete further research projects, presentations, essays, academic papers and exams; several excursions and a teambuilding weekend rounded off the semester. This combination of various forms of learning contributed significantly to my study progress.‚ÜóÔ∏èüéì Therefore, I am already looking forward to the second semester with further exciting courses and projects!üåª\n\nToday marks the end of my internship in the sustainability team of Ebner Stolz. During the past three months, I supported the consultation of medium-sized companies with regard to the current and upcoming sustainability regulations as well as the auditing of sustainability KPIs. Thus, I gained a profound understanding of the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, and the German Supply Chain Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz). A personal highlight was that I was allowed to represent Ebner Stolz at the International Business Fair of ESB Business School and participate in a career event for students organized by the Reutlingen office of Ebner Stolz. I enjoyed the diversity of my tasks and will miss the whole team and its positive and fun atmosphere that existed despite our virtual collaboration across four different locations. Thank you, Verena Balke, for being such a supportive manager over the past months! And now let's see what PwC Public Sector holds up for me next!üòä\n\nHow time flies! Last Friday, I already finished my Carlo Schmid fellowship at OECD-OCDE in Paris. In the past six months, I was able to gain many new insights in the Advisory team of the Office of the Secretary-General. I prepared briefings and speeches for the Secretary-General's meetings and missions and supported the coordination of the EU-OECD cooperation on political reform projects. This allowed me to understand OECD's strategic priorities and contribute to their implementation. What stood out to me was the solidarity among all the advisors. Thank you to each of you for your support, especially to Alexander Hartmut Himbert and Naoko Kawaguchi for your great mentorship and guidance! As a voluntary add-on, I became part of OECD's Intern Circle Board as its Head of Advocacy. I organized the interns' participation at an organzation-wide protest, conducted a survey to understand how the internship experience at OECD can be improved, and organized a Brown Bag Lunch session with the Temporary Staff Network. The most rewarding experience, however, was being responsible for the organization of the Intern Welcome Event for which we were able to secure the Secretary-General, the Chief of Staff, the Director of OECD's WISE Directorate, and the Chairman of the Staff Association as high-level speakers. I had the pleasure to co-moderate the event which was attended by approximately 100 interns. Given the highly positive feedback from all sides, I am proud of what we accomplished!üòä My last weeks were full of goodbyes - goodbyes to my favourite places across Paris, to great colleagues, and most importantly to friends that I made in the past six months. I am grateful for all the experiences and learnings and will certainly miss the OECD and Paris! --------- Disclaimer: The photos of the intern event were taken by Victor Tonelli, ¬©OECD.\n\nHalf of my studies in Canada are already over! Last week, I finished my sixth semester which was my second semester at Goodman School of Business at Brock University in Canada. The past eight months have been different than expected: Both semesters took place completely online and because of Canada‚Äôs entry restrictions, I spent almost all of the first semester in Germany which resulted in inconvenient lecture times. This start surely was not easy, especially as I was part of the first ESB generation ever to attend Brock University. Therefore, I am proud to say that Carina H., Julia Gralka, and I made the best out of our situation: We moved to Canada as soon as the entry restrictions were lifted, explored Ontario as much as possible during and between lockdowns, and can be satisfied with our academic achievements! While the past eight months might have been different than expected, they have been a shaping experience nonetheless. Thank you, Carina and Julia, for joining me on this adventurous journey. I am looking forward to our final year and hope for some ‚Äúnormality‚Äù that enables us to experience Brock University's campus life! Until then, I am excited about my internship at KfW that is going to start soon! #doubledegree #studyincanada #internationalbusiness\n\nNot only the students I supervised, but also I myself participated in the virtual National Model United Nations NY conference last week. Having started the second half of my studies at Brock University, Canada, in September 2020, I decided to join Brock National Model United Nations. I would like to thank the whole team and especially the executives for welcoming me so kindly and for upholding the club‚Äôs weekly preparatory meetings during the pandemic. Our delegation was chosen to represent China this year and I am excited to announce that we won a Distinguished Delegation Award for our performance. I represented China in the simulation of the Economic and Social Council Plenary ‚Äì and I did not expect an online conference to be so much fun! Like in New York two years ago, I met many like-minded students and found a working group that I perfectly fitted in. A huge thank you to my team members for making this conference an unforgettable experience! I hope we can stay in touch! Preparing for and participating in the NMUN conference has strengthened my research, policy-writing, public speaking, and negotiation skills. I hope to stay part of Brock NMUN in the upcoming year to further improve these skills and to finally meet all the members in person!"
