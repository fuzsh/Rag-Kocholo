        "text": "Delayed almost 2 hours sitting on plane. No updates at all from flight deck and virtually no updates from cabin crew\n\nBe sure to check bags for 23 kg,.(50 lbs) Coming from US I chose the wrong size luggage weight when I checked in on my phone, and had to pay more when I dropped it off\n\nThe on board air steward really made the journey. He was very entertaining\n\nI was disappointed there was a 40 minute delay to flight\n\nWorst airline in the world, will never travel in it again.\n\nThe trip itself was good. I have given only good as rating, because my first flight has been cancelled by a different airline and that caused disruption in my trip. I spent over ten hours in Luton airport and that caused me high tiredness, sickness, because of the very early initial trip. easyJet staff has been professional and friendly.\n\nVery pleasant crew, working hard on a full plane. Delay by a broken seat. However crew made back 60% of the delay.\n\nDelayed and then further delayed with no announcement made so that all the passengers (who were standing in the jetty) could hear. We stood there for well over 20 minutes. We were further delayed through weather but no one explained that to us until the pilot made an announcement when finally on board\n\neasyJet need to ensure that whether pre-booking seats or not children aren’t split from their parents the crew spent the majority of boarding asking passengers to move to accommodate two families. Surely the system identifies minors on a booking !!!!! It was all very frustrating to watch and caused delays which I’m sure cost easyJet more in the long run rather that automatically allocating families with minors seats together automatically.\n\nNot great! Rude staff in London and the worse baggage reclaim I’ve ever seen. Great staff in flight but doubt I’ll fly with them again\n\nLess room on an international flight than domestic, which makes no sense as they are 8-9 hour flights. Completely uncomfortable and the food was terrible. Flying through Germany and having to stand in line for a passport check when you have a connection also makes no sense when you already did that prior to boarding. They had given some of our seats away because we were so late arriving to the connecting gate\n\nStill haven’t finished the flight. Day 2. Missed flight connection for reasons not explained and had to spend night at hotel. Booked on early flight next morning and had to deplane for technical issue. So tired. Not happy. Seat changed to ver back of plane like they did on the outgoing flight. This airline is second rate at best. Bad form. Never again. Not duly compensated\n\nMy luggage is lost! I waited in Denver co and seen nothing almost lost my flight due to waiting for my bags and still nothing I hope to contact customer service today hope they find it\n\nSmooth flight. Safe airline. Professional crew. Glitchy entertainment touch screen. So-so food. So-so seat padding.\n\nNo one came to pick my mom up with the wheelchair\n\nMy flight was delayed by 10h the crew was useless didn’t care a bit once we landed they couldn’t get the luggage out of the airplane for another 2h old plain old crew poor service I’ll never fly Lufthansa again\n\nWhen they gave me the ticket in Turkey, they did something wrong, and my ticket did not match with my passport in Munich I got into the line, but because of the problem, I was the last one got into the airplane. They had to solve the problem. Couple people asked to turn the air condition down, but they said that it was broken, we were freezing inside the plain. Food and snack was really poor. I bought this ticket by thinking that I was going to fly with Lufthansa, but it turned out United airlines. I will be more careful from now on, I will try not to use KAYAK. I had bad experience while I am going and coming back. United Airlines did not make it easy.\n\nBiggest gripes were that the seats were extra narrow as the 4-in-the-middle taper down. As with most flight, too little leg room hurts my aging hips. Also changing the flight time to 3 hours earlier meant that we had a terribly long lay-over in one of the world's most boring airports\n\nThey lost my luggage for five days and did not keep me notified of the progress at all.\n\nOne shocking event is worth noting. I told a crew member that someone in the row ahead of us is listening to their iPad without earbuds. She looked and me and said \"yes, so?\" I asked if that's now allowed in Lufthansa flights and she said that it is. If this is true, I don't know how Lufthansa plans to control the coming cacophony of people listening to different things at the same time and driving the volume ever higher to drown our their neighbor's personal device.\n\nThe worst low cost airline in the world! It’s absolutely the poorest costumer service and my worst experience!\n\nRyanair is always shite. Slowest boarding possible in the most uncomfortable way. It’s like they are are tad sadistic.\n\nFlight was delayed which happens but walking 15 mins to one gate to be then told it’s now changed to one 15 mins back then other way was frustrating\n\nEast check in and security. They are always delayed though. ALWAYS!\n\nPoor, how can you order something from the menu em you can’t see a menu? How can you get the online menu when you have no internet? Why let us board when you know full well we won’t be taking off for another 45 minutes, no ice for drink in sweltering heat, seats hard and and uncomfortable when you’re sitting for over 5 hours.\n\nAmazed at huge number of people who hadn’t booked cabin bags with big troller cases and rucksacks, not being stopped, what’s the point in following rules or paying more if you don't have to bother?\n\nWorse situation ever. Arriving at 4 am with 7 Hours of delay\n\nBooked extra legroom seats but as plane had changed we ended up with normal seats. Very little attempt from staff to sort it out\n\nIt was delayed and there was no apology or any updates as to why. It was genuinely awful\n\nIt got us their! Delays Delays delayed, flight got in well after specified time, rental car firms shut at 11pm!!!! So from £300 for car to £689.. thank you Ryanair....\n\nDelay after delay: no information besides what my Kayak app provided was provided about the delays. The plane was at the gate. Also, the gate, 100A, was incredibly warm, and the sun was beaming in. Boarding was disorganized with no groups announced.\n\nKayak - EDreams - Eurowings need to define clearer the hand luggage terms. I asked for add. hang luggage got charged by Eurowings for having add. hand luggage that was not included in my booking. I travel alot! I know the size dimensions never paid twice for hand luggage and cannot chase Edreams or put Eurowings in the wrong. Also there was severe delays on this flight. Issue getting bus on arrival and missed connections. Unfortunate will not use Eurowings\n\nWe checked in 4 luggage and only got 3 back & lost our 4th luggage. Our flight was from berlin sept 22. We arrived Copenhagen but only received 3 luggage. Missing 1 still 24 hrs after our arrival and our Cruise will be leaving tomorrow 9/24/2023. This is the second time that our luggage gets lost/delayed in Copenhagen\n\nNo food on plane.. flights scheduled 55 min..everything is very expensive on aeroport\n\nFilthy plane, obviously not cleaned properly between flights, food crumbles in seat and carpet\n\nSmallest seat I have ever seen. And they had a label with more Legroom but in fact where really tiny.\n\nNo cancellations but one flight delayed due to arrival airport industrial action. Comfortable\n\nI was held-up at boarding by rude employee who insisted that I had to wait until all other passengers had boarded the lane before issuing me a boarding pass so I can board the plane. I could not check-in earlier and get a boarding pass since I had flown directly from Dusseldorf.\n\nPros: \"The flight was fine.\"\n\nCons: \"Super delayed. I arrived in Vienna at night with no further outbound flights because of the delay. Also, the airline will not accept responsibility for the missed connection so Im done with Eurowings.\"\n\nPros: \"It flights themselves were fine. A 45 minute delay sucked though.\"\n\nCons: \"Service & Notification. The airline switched my itenerary without alerting me which made me miss a connection. The resulting troubleshooting with the airline has been non-existent. I will not fly Eurowings again.\"\n\nI had paid for my family to sit together on the plane. When we got to the plane this wasn't the case and we were separated. meanwhile the lady sitting next to me told me how she didn't pay and were all sitting together\n\nMy baggage never arrived .. its day 4 and still waiting.. on top of that the idiots gave my luggage to fedex who dont deliver on sat/sun and i am waiting on my medicines .. hopeless ground staff using mediocre logic to show urgency of luggage delivery\n\nIt didn't happen at all. They sold out my seat taking their own decision that I'll not get to boarding on time, but I was!\n\nTerrible, broken window and the blinded didn’t shut during the entire flight. Nobody could sleep\n\nThe experience was terrible. 1) We boarded late, 2a) BA lost my bag, 2b) The bag was delivered an entire day later than they said, and 2c) When it was delivered they brought the wrong / someone else's bag, and then the drivers had to come back with the right one. My medicine was in that bag so I needed it ASAP and there was no number to call that would let me speak to an actual person (vs. a automated voice that hangs up on you). This is in addition to my departing flight where an 11 hour travel day turned into a 20 hour travel day, given that: 1) the flight departed late AND it took an hour to deplane when we landed, causing us to miss our connection to Florence. This meant we had to take two connectors to arrive the same day (through Madrid and then Florence). 2) For the 2nd connector, the printer broke so we had to exit Madrid airport to print our boarding passes, and that delay almost caused us to miss our connector for a 2nd time in the same day, for reasons that BA should have easily been able to address.\n\nStaff were uniformly excellent. Padding for premium economy seats was a bit thin. Drinks service was very very good. Food was meh.\n\nThe boarding took about an hour the Flight was delayed about 40 minutes the seat, which I'd paid extra for was extremely cramped I will probably not fly with this airline again\n\nNot being able to check my luggage ruined my flight experience with British Airways. I have to spend hundreds of dollars to get my luggage to me.\n\nA pretty decent flight. Pretty cramped in economy, but not as bad as some."
