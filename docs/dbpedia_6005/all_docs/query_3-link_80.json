        "text": "Street View Car\n\nWeâve come a long way since our initial US launch in 2007; today weâve expanded our 360 photos to include locations on all seven continents.\n\nStreet View Trekker\n\nThe Trekker enables Street View to feature more places around the world â places no car, trike, trolley or snowmobile can access. This wearable backpack is fitted with a camera system on top, and its portability enables us to gather images whilst manoeuvring through tight, narrow spaces or in locations only accessible on foot. Our first collection using this camera technology was taken along the rough, rocky terrain of Arizonaâs Grand Canyon.\n\nStreet View Trolley\n\nWhen a group of art-loving Googlers wanted to take Street View technology to museums around the world, we needed to develop a system that could easily fit through museum doorways and navigate around sculptures. This first foray indoors fit all the necessary equipment onto a smaller frame: a push-trolley mounted with a camera system dubbed the Trolley. It has not only collected views from inside museums, but also other indoor locations like the White House and sports stadiums.\n\nStreet View Snowmobile\n\nAnother place we thought itâd be fun to take the Street View cameras are on the slopes. Over a few weekends using some 2x4s, duct tape and extra hard drives wrapped in ski jackets to endure the freezing conditions, the team was able to successfully mount the Street View equipment onto a snowmobile. Skiers, snowboarders and snowshoers can now explore Whistler Blackcomb Mountain and the hilly, snow-capped terrain shared by surrounding resorts.\n\nStreet View Three-Wheeler\n\nFor cities with small streets we had to think of a vehicle strong enough to hold the Street View trekker. In order to reach some of the narrow alleyways, our team found out that motorcycle Selis Robin in Indonesia is a great solution. Meet the Street View three-wheeler. Additional mast has been built specifically for this vehicle to provide additional stability for the Street View trekker."
