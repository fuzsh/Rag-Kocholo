This significant event built upon our first DAAD-IIE roundtable in Brussels last October, ahead of the EU-U.S. Summit. 🎯 The goals of the Transatlantic High-Level Roundtable were to: ◾ Map current opportunities to boost research, student mobility, and people-to-people exchanges. ◾ Discuss the importance of supporting and expanding programs. ◾ Explore the feasibility of a common framework for collaborative activities and share successful models of cross-institutional and multilateral partnerships. ◾ Identify the next steps to advance transatlantic partnerships in HE. 📌 Based on the discussion outcomes, IIE and DAAD decided to: ◾ Overcome the information gap in transatlantic partnerships by regularly providing focused and comprehensive state-of-play reports. ◾ Establish a digital platform to share existing opportunities in the field of transatlantic HE collaboration. ◾ Disseminate information about transatlantic exchange and cooperation to the wider public. ◾ Continue transatlantic roundtables to foster cross-sectoral and cross-country knowledge exchange and goodwill (next edition taking place in spring 2025 in Europe). 👉 The event report is now available on our website: https://lnkd.in/eGx-QaBT 🚀 DAAD Brussels looks forward to continuing the IIE-DAAD collaboration to jointly leverage the potential of transatlantic cooperation in HE, addressing shared priorities, and building a stronger, more connected future. #DAAD #IIE #HigherEducation #TransatlanticPartnership #AcademicExchanges\n\nNew collaboration alert: Our feathered friend GAPPY 🐦 has been busy creating new synergies to benefit our 2024 student exchanges.

This initiative aims to bring together all current and future European Universities alliances into a cohesive structure, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment where best practices and experiences can be shared. Together, these alliances will drive lasting transformation in higher education by pioneering deep transnational cooperation. They will contribute significantly to the European Education & Research Area by offering joint degree programs, promoting mobility across borders, and enhancing the international attractiveness and competitiveness of Europe's higher education. In another highlight, we celebrated the formation of new European university partnerships under the Erasmus+ 2024 call for proposals. With 14 new alliances joining the 50 previously selected, this brings the total to 64 alliances, encompassing more than 560 higher education institutions across Europe. This remarkable achievement meets the European university strategy target of at least 60 European university partnerships involving more than 500 universities by mid-2024. Let us celebrate this significant milestone and look forward to the innovative collaborations and advancements in higher education that these alliances will bring!
