This significant event built upon our first DAAD-IIE roundtable in Brussels last October, ahead of the EU-U.S. Summit. 🎯 The goals of the Transatlantic High-Level Roundtable were to: ◾ Map current opportunities to boost research, student mobility, and people-to-people exchanges. ◾ Discuss the importance of supporting and expanding programs. ◾ Explore the feasibility of a common framework for collaborative activities and share successful models of cross-institutional and multilateral partnerships. ◾ Identify the next steps to advance transatlantic partnerships in HE. 📌 Based on the discussion outcomes, IIE and DAAD decided to: ◾ Overcome the information gap in transatlantic partnerships by regularly providing focused and comprehensive state-of-play reports. ◾ Establish a digital platform to share existing opportunities in the field of transatlantic HE collaboration. ◾ Disseminate information about transatlantic exchange and cooperation to the wider public. ◾ Continue transatlantic roundtables to foster cross-sectoral and cross-country knowledge exchange and goodwill (next edition taking place in spring 2025 in Europe). 👉 The event report is now available on our website: https://lnkd.in/eGx-QaBT 🚀 DAAD Brussels looks forward to continuing the IIE-DAAD collaboration to jointly leverage the potential of transatlantic cooperation in HE, addressing shared priorities, and building a stronger, more connected future. #DAAD #IIE #HigherEducation #TransatlanticPartnership #AcademicExchanges\n\n🗣️\"International, European joint degrees and the #EuropeanDegree are important developments for us in Switzerland, as they relate not only to EU member states, but to the entire European Higher Education Area.\" 🎓🌍Una Europa has shaped the European Commission's proposal for a #EuropeanDegree by coordinating the ED-AFFICHE project, which brought together 51 #highereducation institutions across 22 countries to identify existing hurdles to creating #jointdegrees in Europe and recommend ways to overcome them. Our contribution to ED-AFFICHE drew on our own experience of building joint degrees such as the Una Europa Joint Bachelor's in #EuropeanStudies and upcoming Joint Bachelor's in #Sustainability. 🇨🇭Our partner University of Zurich played a proactive role in ED-AFFICHE, working alongside Université de Genève of 4EU+ Alliance to bring the Swiss perspective on the European Degree and ensure that future plans can be implemented across the European Higher Education Area as a whole. 🤔Curious to learn more about Switzerland's involvement in shaping the European Degree? Annika Martin from University of Zurich's Teaching Development Office shared insights into the ED-AFFICHE project and Una Europa's experience building joint degrees in a recent interview with the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation SERI. 💬Hear from Annika: https://lnkd.in/gmE6yadv #WeAreUnaEuropa #UniversityOfTheFuture #EuropeanUniversities #ErasmusPlus\n\nWant to #Study in Germany in 2024-2025?
