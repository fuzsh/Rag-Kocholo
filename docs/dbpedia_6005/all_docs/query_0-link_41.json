        "text": "Rottweil, Germany\n\nWhere is Rottweil?\n\nRottweil is a medium-sized town located just outside the Black Forest region to the south of Stuttgart which proudly holds the title as the oldest city in Baden-Württemberg.\n\nIt is popular with visitors for its medieval centre, its towers (not all historic) and its fountains.\n\nAnd, of course, it is the location that gives its name to the renowned breed of Rottweiler dogs, possibly dating back to the days of Roman settlement and their use for herding and guard duties.\n\nHow to get to Rottweil\n\nNearest airport to Rottweil\n\nThe closest and most convenient airport for Rottweil is that at the state capital Stuttgart, followed by the major airport at Zurich.\n\nDistance to Stuttgart Airport: 89km\n\nDistance to Zurich Airport: 111km\n\nDistance to Friedrichshafen (Bodensee) Airport: 116km\n\nDistance to Baden Airport: 127km\n\nDistance to EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg: 152km\n\nThose arriving by air might also want to see what options the smaller operations at Friedrichshafen and Baden-Baden might offer, although the choice of airlines and destinations at the two closer airports is likely to be much greater.\n\nRottweil train station\n\nRottweil is on an InterCity rail link between Stuttgart and Zurich so has good high-speed connections. It also links into the Black Forest rail network via Villingen. The train station is about a kilometre away from the historic centre up (or down) a steep hill.\n\nDriving to Rottweil\n\nRottweil lies just to the east of the A81 motorway between Stuttgart and Lake Constance. It also has connections into the Black Forest centres of Triberg, Donaueschingen and Titisee by way of Villingen.\n\nWhere to stay in Rottweil\n\nRottweil is a sprawling town, although the historic centre is compactly located on a hill which rises steeply above the Neckar river.\n\nRottweil accommodation map\n\nIf you know when you are planning to go but haven't decided on accommodation, then use the map below to get an idea of which properties are available and to compare prices during the period you wish to travel.\n\nEnter your proposed dates and use the '+' to zoom in on a location and reveal more properties.

Under the Hohenstaufen rule it reached the heights of an administrative centre and court for the surrounding area and became a Free Imperial City in the 15th century.\n\nIn the 16th century it joined the Swiss Confederation, although it remained staunchly Catholic in contrast to its allies during the period of the Reformation. It was occupied a number of times during the various wars which plagued central Europe in the Middle Ages.\n\nRottweil became part of the state of Württemberg as part of the legal dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire at the start of the 19th century during the period of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nThe town was connected to the rail system in Württemberg in 1868 and is nowadays an important junction with connections to Stuttgart, Zurich and the Black Forest.\n\nThese days, Rottweil is an administrative centre with an attractive old town of towers, churches and fountains.\n\nAnother of the sights is more modern, with the construction of the ThyssenKrupp Test Tower in the nearby industrial area in 2017. The 246-metre tower was built for research into lifts (elevators) and has the highest viewing platform in Germany at 232 metres. It is open to the public from Friday to Sunday and occasionally on other dates during the summer high season.\n\nOther towns along the Neckar river\n\nRottweil Tourist Office"
