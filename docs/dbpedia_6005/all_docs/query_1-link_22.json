        "text": "The teaching, research and innovation centre for specialised technologies in the textile industry, known as Texoversum, is part of the campus extension of the Reutlingen University of Applied Sciences.\n\nThe textile construction is the theme of the design in both function and form, with the representative outer fabric distinguishing the building. The self-supporting woven parts of glass and carbon fibre were developed in a multi-layered robotic winding process from five templates. Their staggered arrangement allows the views of the surroundings to be enjoyed, as well as providing protection from direct solar radiation. The result is an expressive and attractive fa√ßade, both aesthetically and symbolically.\n\nThe central elements of transparency and interconnectedness visible in the architectural design are continued in the structural design. The floors are staggered at intervals and visually interwoven in the atrium, which connects the different sections together and forms a spatial continuum, culminating in a spacious roof terrace."
