        "text": "Describing the Reutlingen program is easier than describing the “Reutlingen experience.” Innumerable, incidental, and unclassifiable experiences add up to a total experience which is more than the sum of the structured parts.\n\nThis article attempts to describe the objectives and structures of the Reutlingen Study Center. As such the description is no more a reflection of the significance of the program for the lives of the participants than a description of a skeleton is a reflection of the challenge, exhilaration, frustration, and pulsation of life itself.\n\nThe general objective of the program, at least to this writer’s understanding, is to provide a structure for learning in which formal academic study is combined with personal observation and experience of European culture, so that their mutual stimulation results in an enrichment greater than if both were done separately.\n\nThe Reutlingen Study Center may be described literally as a “center of learning.” This means simply that the Study Center is a center or base for a semester of continuous learning, which occurs throughout Europe, but more in Reutlingen than anywhere else.\n\nThe Reutlingen Study Center is located on the campus of the Pädagogische Hochschule, for obvious reasons known even to local residents as the “PH” (pronounced pay-ha). The PH is a school with university status in the German educational system and specializes in the training of teachers. Founded about ten years ago, the school now has approximately 3000 students. The Valparaiso Study Center is given the use of a PH classroom and the director is provided with an office.\n\nThe Study Center is an center of academic learning. Currently students may choose from six courses offered under the auspices of Valparaiso University. By special arrangement students may also attend and receive credit for courses offered by the PH itself or by its sister institution, the University of Tübingen, which is fewer than ten miles away.\n\nThe curriculum of the Center is designed with two basic objectives. The first is to provide courses which are general enough in nature so that as many students as possible may participate in the program. Secondly the courses are chosen for their appropriateness in helping students to know and appreciate historical and contemporary European culture.\n\nSpecifically, the curriculum is currently composed of two German language course, two German history courses, a humanities course, and a theology course. The two German courses are offered at two different levels to accommodate students with different levels of proficiency. A minimal proficiency in German is necessary to enable the student to benefit from the opportunities which a semester in German offers. German, incidentally, is spoken extensively in several countries other than Germany, for example, Switzerland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. These courses are taught more intensively during the first part of the semester, so that maximum proficiency can be achieved as quickly as possible. One German history course covers the sixteenth century, while a second course covers the period from 1800 to the present.\n\nA humanities course focuses on the history of European art, architecture, and music. This course enables students who have had little exposure to the arts to begin to appreciate what Europe has to offer, which is, of course, a great deal. The course is structured so that those who have had previous experience in these areas also benefit. The humanities course is taught by a team of three instructors. A theology course includes units describing the church in Germany and the church’s encounter with Marxism. The courses in theology and sixteenth century German history are taught by the current director. The other courses are taught by German professors.\n\nResearch papers are usually not assigned in any of the courses, although occasional book reports are required. Tests are required in all courses, including final examinations. The exception to this rule is the humanities course, in which students are required to keep a notebook of lectures, textbook reading, and personal observations and reflections. The notebooks are examined and graded. The notebook is returned to the student, thereby providing the student with a permanent record of many European experiences.\n\nSpecific programmatic correlation between academic learning and experiential learning is made through several group study trips. Each trip has specific objectives related to the content of one or more of the courses. A three day trip is made to Strasbourg, Colmar, Freiburg, and the Lake Constance area for the purpose of studying Romanesque, Gothic, and Baroque art and architecture. An art instructor usually accompanies the group on this trip.\n\nA second trip is made to Italy, primarily to explore the art and architecture of ancient Italy. Included in this trip are visits to Florence, Venice, Pisa, and Milan. Rome, Ravenna, and other cities are included on different itineraries as time and interest permit. Eight days is the usual duration.\n\nA third trip, lasting twelve days, is made through East Germany, Berlin, and Czechoslovakia. In East Germany visits are made to several sites of importance for the history of sixteenth century Germany, particularly the Reformation. For example, the Luther House in Eisenach, the Wartburg Castle, and the Luther buildings in Wittenberg, are toured. Also included are stops in Weimar, Buchenwald, Leipzig, Dresden, Potsdam, and, of course, East Berlin. These places are of special significance for modern Germany history. During the five days in West Berlin, local leaders provide lectures on the recent history and current situation of Berlin. These lectures are also directly related to the course in modern German history.\n\nThe tour of East Germany and Czechoslovakia provides an opportunity to view the nature of living conditions in two socialist countries. The opinions of citizens of these countries are most interesting. The total impact of this trip virtually demands that every student reexamine the strengths and weaknesses of both socialist and capitalist societies. To do so requires an honest confrontation and examination of one’s own values and commitments. The confrontation is not quickly resolved, and often provides grist for future academic work and reflection.\n\nStudents are encouraged to travel on their own. Reutlingen’s location in central Europe, approximately thirty miles south of Stuttgart, affords easy accessibility to most of Europe. Within fewer than four hours students can be in France, Switzerland, or Austria, and almost any place in southern Germany. Personal travel is facilitated by the structuring of a three and a half day academic week. This shortened week is made possible because students usually register for twelve credit hours, three less than the normal academic schedule on the home campus. The alternation of several days of travel with several days of formal study provides students with frequent opportunities to reflect on their travel experiences, a luxury which few tourists can afford. For various reasons, including academic ones, students do not usually travel every weekend of the semester; nor are they always away for the entire weekend.\n\nEach semester usually includes a two week period during which students may travel extensively. Greece, Africa, Scandinavia, and even Russia are frequent destinations. This period is usually placed in the last half of the semester, by which time students have become inveterate travelers.\n\nTraveling in Europe can be relatively simple and inexpensive for students. Sleeping in youth hostels costs about one dollar per night. A student rail pass is valid for almost all of the frequent and efficient European railway systems. Students are almost invariably also given reduced admissions at places of cultural interest.\n\nPlanning is essential. Students are encouraged at the beginning of the semester to formulate tentative travel objectives and itineraries. Guides and other materials are made available so that potential destinations may be researched. Advance study affords the opportunity to make maximum use of travelling time. Students are encouraged to formulate itineraries which complement the group study trips.\n\nLearning is confined neither to the classroom nor to travelling. Unlike American universities, German universities do not provide students with housing. In the case of the PH, a partial substitution is provided. Two student apartment buildings owned by a semi-private housing organization in Reutlingen and one by the Church of Württemberg, accommodate approximately one hundred students each. The study Center is fortunate to have twenty permanent spaces in these buildings. Most Study Center students have German roommates who usually provide excellent guides to German culture.\n\nSince the PH operates a cafeteria only for the noon meal, students must prepare their own breakfasts and suppers in one of the kitchens. These are located on each floor and shared by all residents of the floor. The kitchen with its adjacent dining area is frequently the place where students of the Center can meet German students. It is also a good place to obtain vital information regarding the purchase and preparation of German food, or even a lesson in basic cooking. Occasionally German students invite the American students to their homes, an opportunity which almost no one passes up.\n\nA comment concerning the spiritual dimensions of the program is also appropriate. Although Students are encouraged to participate in worship services in the community and on the campus of the PH, weekend travel does not always make such participation possible. The directors of the Reutlingen Study Center have so far all been clergymen in the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod, and have provided pastoral services for students. An important feature is the regular celebration of the Eucharist.\n\nThe director of the Study Center is a resource person who stands ready to assist and advise in any way possible.\n\nThat is the skeleton. To put flesh on it would have required hundreds of vignettes. Each, though only a small glimpse into the Reutlingen experience, would have illustrated an experience which contributed in some way to the process of maturation. The incident may have revealed increased self-reliance, a broader vision of the world, a deeper insight into the nature of people, or a more sensitive appreciation of the world in which we all live.\n\nThe significance of the “Reutlingen experience” naturally varies according to the uniqueness of each participant. Yet this writer has yet to meet one participant who has not felt that the Reutlingen experience was eminently instructive and worthwhile.\n\nReutlingen is a center of learning; perhaps this is why students are so enthusiastic about the program.\n\nGrűß Gott, besonders an R-10, R-11, R-12, R-13!\n\nWho had the greater adventure? — students or the Albers family? No Albers had flown before boarding a 747 Lufthansa in Chicago bound for Frankfurt. Except for Canada, none of them had traveled outside the US. Six years as residence director in Brandt Hall had truly been an adventure, but the prospect of living in Germany for two years with a family of five–the youngest were 9, 6, and 4 —war ein sehr grosses Abenteuer. It was the time before the PC, let alone e-mail or skype. Trans-Atlantic telephone was for extreme emergencies. Many students also had limited experience, and often had misgivings which usually intensified upon arrival. Most had little confidence in their German and were reluctant to venture into the halls and kitchens of Litt, Wurm, or Reichwein and risk their shaky German, but hunger always conquered angst!\n\nWhile misgivings were common and understandable, most students adjusted with one or two “nights” sleep, orientation, a walking tour of Reutlingen, followed by the one-day Albrundfahrt to the monastery at Bebenhausen, Rathaus in Tübingen, Hohenzollern and Lichtenstein castles, and a few other places, eventually ending up zum Hirsch in Würtingen, for Teller Salat, Pommes frites, Schnitzel und Getränke. Homesickness and self-doubt ebbed, especially with a week-end trip guided by a humanities instructor through the Black Forest to Freiburg, then across the Rhine to Colmar (Grünewald altar triptych), then to the Bodensee, the island of Mainau, across to the north shore and Reichenau with its Carolingian Romanesque church, followed by a few Barockstrasse churches. Staying in youth hostels on this trip engendered enough experience and confidence to venture out independently and use a fast developing Wortschatz—zum Beispiel, Schlafsack, Grenze, Ausweis, Geldwechseln, Speisekarte, Preisinclusiv, Montags geschlossen, und Mittagspause.\n\nThese trips and those to Berlin/East Germany and Italy were via chartered bus and provided wonderful opportunities for group bonding, short pre-site lectures, a good venue for local guides to share information and Q & A. Unlike the German trains, our bus actually waited for those who were late. Busfahrer Herr Werner Ganter guided his bus through impossibly tight spots and turns, coached us on in-bus behavior for borders crossings, and was an informal cultural commentator.\n\nTrips created memorable and practical lessons in comparative political systems. Students talked with East German students in Leipzig and Weimar youth hostels. They experienced East German border guards pass through the bus and confiscate dangerous literature such as Time or the International Herald Tribune. One group heard a distraught elderly guide at the Lutherhaus in Eisenach lament revocation of his travel permission to visit relatives in West Germany. Three students had grown respectable beards only to have their identities challenged by a Czech border guard. The bus wasn’t going anywhere until their “true identity” could be verified.! No electric razor on board, so a half canister of shaving cream, safety razors, cold running water, and a half hour later, our trio reappeared. The guard never re-checked their passports. Dobry den! Welcome to the CSSR!\n\nHitch-hiking was still relatively safe, especially in pairs or trios. Many purchased rail passes and used them well. A long overnight could spare a Jugendherberge! Some co-eds, however, noted that riding the trains in Italy was problematic and bought inexpensive rings to appear engaged or married. The oil embargo of 1973 created inflation and pressured travel budgets. Especially affected was R-13, whose Italy trip was canceled although many traveled there on their own.\n\nMonday night gatherings in the director’s apartment began with a folk service, with student guitar accompaniment and was followed by telling of tellable travel tales [we never heard everything!]–how strangers had gone out of their way to drop them off, had bought them meals, and even invited them into their homes. Some described their “travels on assignment,” that is, to view firsthand the object of their humanities paper—a painting, a sculpture, or a church. Monday gatherings also meant distributing copies of the Torch faithfully sent by Prof. Martin Schaefer, sharing other news, celebrating birthdays, and enjoying Frau Albers’ homemade desserts.\n\nClassroom instruction gave eyes to see and ears to hear. The following were on staff during these two years: Fr. Weingärtner (German), Professors Wolf Brixner (German), Meinert Meyer (German), Hans-Christoph Rublack (German History), Zagermann, Jürgen Paul, Lohrmann, and Jürgen Zänker (Humanities). The very gracious Frau Prof. Dr. Annemarie Christiansen was our very attentive and helpful behind the scenes support and liaison with the PH.\n\nWhether for a semester, as in the case of most students, or four semesters for Familie Albers, none of us left unchanged. We came to appreciate much about German and European culture, we learned much about the US by viewing it from the outside and having to explain it (e.g., Vietnam, Nixon, Watergate) to non-Americans. Perhaps, most important, we all learned much about ourselves, including that some risk-taking was essential; inadvertently saying something funny was not the end of the world; and that we often had no choice but to trust strangers which in turn taught us to befriend others.\n\nThen . . . we all left . . . changed . . . for the better! We were now free to move around the world . . . and most of us did!\n\n(SUBMITTED 09/06/2018)\n\nWe were the only faculty/family to have been directors at both Overseas Centers, as far as I know. I believe we introduced several innovations that were followed year after year at both Centers. My husband came directly after Don Mundinger at Cambridge and he was the one to suggest that directors serve for two years instead of just one. A single year did not seem to be enough to make and then keep, most importantly, connections and friendships with British staff and faculty. I believe my husband hired some English faculty for various courses.\n\nHe introduced to organized trips throughout England during breaks and he took the students to the Continent for the first time. These trips were not merely touristic outings but also vivid lessons about history, geography, architecture and various forms of art. They were also eye openers for students who have never been outside the United States.\n\nIn those first years our own and well as the students’ accommodations were very basic, one might say primitive, especially in regard to bathrooms and kitchens. Our house was poorly furnished, the walls did not necessarily meet in the corners and so newspaper had to be stuffed in, and my kitchen was tiny and totally impractical. Nonetheless, we invited students for home cooked meals, we loved to go to market and buy fresh produce especially mushrooms, and we enjoyed the company of our young people.\n\nBy the time we reached Reutlingen several years later, the program was well established and the students lived in a dormitory near our apartment. We continued to conduct bus tours and we especially stressed that our free American students have a look at what it is like to live in East Germany. For many it was a shock as it should have been. I remember that my husband stressed before departure that everyone must be especially careful of their behavior and their conversation as we were entering a repressive and potentially dangerous country. And naturally, they did not enjoy the thorough and rude scrutiny we underwent at the border crossing. Nevertheless, on one occasion, (one only!), one of our students thought it wise to bring along a copy of Mein Kampf for the trip….\n\nThey were impressed by the difference between life in the East and the West, could not fathom anything like that previously, and were mighty happy when we crossed back to West Berlin.\n\nWe were fortunate to have a wonderful German staff who were kind and interested in our American students. I understand that the program underwent some changes after our time but we enjoyed our chance to be abroad with our kids from Valpo.\n\nThe Overseas Program was innovative and interesting when it was established and many, many young people got an opportunity to see finally the world at large and not be limited to what they experienced up to that point in America.\n\n(SUBMITTED 08/01/2018)"
