The data may be of interest for shim coil designers as well as fro susceptibility mapping research.\n\n4220.\n\nB0 shimming of the liver using a local shim coil array at ultra-high-field MRI\n\nLieke van den Wildenberg1, Quincy van Houtum1, Wybe van der Kemp1, Catalina Arteaga de Castro1, Alex Bhogal1, Paul Chang2, Sahar Nassirpour2, and Dennis Klomp1\n\n1Radiology Department, UMC Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands, 2MR Shim GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany\n\nView the Poster\n\nUltra-high-field MRI is more sensitive to variations in the B0 field specially for larger organs such as the liver. Dynamic shimming using a local array of shim coils can potentially improve the field homogeneity by 18-46% when compared to the standard hardware correction methods at 7T. The use of local shim coil arrays embedded in RF receiver coils may become a good strategy when maximizing shim performance considering the limited available number of shim channels, particularly for larger organs such as the liver at ultra- higher field strengths.\n\n4221.\n\nFinite Element Vibration Analysis of Multi-Coil B0 Hardware for Human Brain MRI\n\nSebastian Theilenberg1, Jalal Ghazouani1,2, and Christoph Juchem1,3\n\n1Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University in the City of New York, New York, NY, United States, 2Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany, 3Department of Radiology, Columbia University in the City of New York, New York, NY, United States\n\nView the Poster\n\nAs part of the design of a novel head-only scanner for improved accessibility of MRI and advanced motor coordination studies, we developed a finite element model of the expected vibration modes of a multi-coil array capable of generating linear and non-linear MRI encoding fields. We found significant resonances in the frequency range of interest whose shape and position can be altered by mechanical uncoupling of the array through mounting via rubber elements.\n\n4222.\n\nHuman brain shimming performance comparison between matrix-like and stream-function SVD-based multi-coil arrays\n\nBruno Pinho Meneses1,2 and Alexis Amadon1\n\n1Neurospin/CEA-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, 2Université Paris-Saclay, Saclay, France\n\nWatch the Video\n\nLast year we presented a novel whole-brain B0-shimming Multi-Coil Array design based on Stream Function Singular Value Decomposition on a cylindrical surface. Here this design is compared to more conventional single-layer matrix arrays in simulations based on a 100-subject B0-map database. While whole-brain shimming performance is naturally improved by our method, the effects of such optimization on slice-by-slice and region-specific shimming are not evident and are therefore explored in this work.\n\n4223.\n\nAnalysis of B0 Field Shimming Limitations in the Human Brain at Ultra-High-Field\n\nBruno Pinho Meneses1,2 and Alexis Amadon1\n\n1Neurospin/CEA-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, 2Université Paris-Saclay, Saclay, France\n\nWatch the Video\n\nDesign of optimized shimming equipment is under way for UHF MRI of the human brain. Here shimming theoretical limits are explored. With a simple model, proof is given that, depending on field source distribution around a zone of interest, no shimming hardware external to such a zone can fully mitigate the inhomogeneous field. A simulation is performed on a 100-subject database to establish hard shim limits on the whole brain. On the other hand, 3D region-specific shimming is shown to be a very effective way to improve homogeneity in critical zones such as the pre-frontal cortex and around ear canals.\n\n4224.\n\nComputational Shim Coil Design Applied to Augmenting a Shim Array with a Non-Eye-Occluding Face Plate\n\nNicolas Arango1, Jason Stockmann2,3, Elfar Adalsteinsson1,4, and Jacob White1\n\n1Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States, 2A.

However, the relation between a current density and a stream function is a simple differentiation. Here we present an intuitive open source code collection to derive gradient coil designs from current densities. Stream functions are derived directly and indirectly from the current distribution. The aim of this work is to provide a simple tool for educational purposes.

Here, this design is improved by using only one 6-channel MEMS switch package per RF coil element and a SPI-interface to control all of them, which requires minimal space and a few command lines. In vivo experiments with an adaptive iPRES(2) body coil array demonstrated that it can reduce B0 inhomogeneities and EPI distortions more effectively than an iPRES(1) coil array, without requiring additional power supplies.\n\n4227.\n\nMachine designing: a multi-coil local shim design using Bayesian optimization\n\nChungseok Oh1, Eunjung Choi1, Woojin Jung1, Heong-geol Shin1, and Jongho Lee1\n\n1Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea\n\nView the Poster\n\nA multi-coil local shim has shown good performance on reducing B0 field inhomogeneity. However, the multi-coil local shim can be expensive due to a large number of channels.

Use of higher order shims and dynamic updating on a slice by slice basis can dramatically reduce the extent of these distortions. This work describes: 1) the theoretical basis for the extension of slice by slice dynamic shim updating for multi-band acquisitions; 2) demonstrates that higher order spherical harmonic shim systems can intrinsically achieve MB=2 imaging with no loss in in-plane homogeneity in comparison to slice by slice shimming (MB=1), and 3) these improvements are easily visualizable in EPI.\n\n4229.\n\nOptimization of Multi-Coil Array Design for Efficient Human Brain Shimming at 3T\n\nYubin Cai1, Hsin-Jung Yang1, Xinqi Li2, Tianshi Hu2, Yuheng Huang2, Yujie Shan2, Meng Lu1, Wai Shing Liu2, Debiao Li1, and Hui Han1\n\n1Biomedical Imaging Research Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States, 2Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States\n\nWatch the Video\n\nAn algorithm is proposed to optimize a multi-coil array for efficient human brain shimming at 3T. Numerically, the algorithm relies on singular value decomposition (SVD) and iterative principle component analysis (PCA) to truncate spurious or redundant coils.

Here, we further develop the integrated parallel reception, excitation, and shimming (iPRES) coil technology, which enables imaging and localized B0 shimming with a single RF/shim coil array, for small animal imaging. We start by numerically optimizing the design of a 4-channel iPRES rat coil array to achieve both a high B0 shimming performance (54.2% reduction in B0 root-mean-square error) and a high and uniform SNR over the brain.\n\n4231.\n\nMRI Room Placement: The effect of an elevator operation on local magnetic environment\n\nDiego F.

Chronik1,2\n\n1The xMR Labs, Physics and Astronomy, Western University, London, ON, Canada, 2Medical Biophysics, Western University, London, ON, Canada\n\nView the Poster\n\nDevelopments in MR systems are allowing for siting which does not follow the typical “4 zone” architecture, removing barriers for MR implementation. A consequence of this is that these systems are nearer to elements of a building or hospital that may cause field distortions and cannot be resolved by shimming. This work quantifies the field distortions due to two typical elevators along a hallway and compares the distortion to a fit using a magnetic dipole approximation, verifying a 1/r3 field behaviour. This demonstrates the need for MR system placement guidelines which mitigate potential field stability concerns due to building elements.\n\n4232.\n\nAn Integrated RF-receive/B0-shim Array Coil Improves whole-brain MR Spectroscopic Imaging at 7T\n\nMorteza Esmaeili1,2, Jason Stockmann1, Bernhard Strasser1, Zhe Wang3, Lawrence Wald1, and Ovidiu C.

We evaluated the performance on an ultra-high field 7T MRI system of a custom-designed 32-channel head coil that with both RF-receive and DC-shim capability. Each coil loop simultaneously and independently runs AC and DC currents for RF-receive and B0-shimming. We examined the multi-coil shimming performance on five healthy volunteers using MRSI. The combined setup of DC-enabled local shimming and highly-efficient spectroscopic acquisition resulted in a noticeable improvement in the quality of spatial metabolic maps.\n\n4233.\n\nUnderstanding the axial crushing effects of numerous current paths at 7 Tesla\n\nErik Rutger Huijing1, Alexander Raaijmakers1,2, Dennis Klomp1, Jannie Wijnen1, and Alex Bhogal1\n\n1Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands, 2Department of Biomedical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands\n\nWatch the Video\n\nMR spectroscopic images are often distorted by lipid signals in the skull. A crusher coil that generates a local magnetic field can suppress these signals, but a homogeneous crushing field is required. This work focusses on a solution for a homogeneous crushing field in the axial direction. It is shown through numerous tests with current patterns that wires circling the coil without any directioal component in the z-direction cause the most homogeneous crushing pattern. Currents in the z-direction should be compensated by a return current that cancels the magnetic field of the current.\n\n4234.\n\nAn automatic design method for arbitrary shaped shielded gradients using a singular value decomposition and meta-heuristic method\n\nKazuya Sakaguchi1 and Yasuhiko Terada1\n\n1Institute of Applied Physics, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan\n\nWatch the Video\n\nMost of gradients coils are cylindrical or planar, but deformed gradients that fit an object shape should have superior performance. A truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) is a design method for arbitrary shaped gradients, but the design process is time-consuming, especially for shielded gradients. Moreover, coil performance, such as coil inductance and power dissipation cannot be optimized. In this study, we proposed a new strategy that combines the SVD method with a meta-heuristic method for automatically optimizing desired performance for shielded gradients.\n\n4235.\n\nDigital Feedback Design for Mutual Coupling Compensation in Gradient Array System\n\nReza Babaloo1,2, Soheil Taraghinia1, Volkan Acikel3, Manoochehr Takrimi1, and Ergin Atalar1,2\n\n1National Magnetic Resonance Resarch Center (UMRAM), Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, 2Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, 3Aselsan, REHIS Power Amplifier Technologies, Ankara, Turkey\n\nWatch the Video\n\nGradient array systems can produce highly flexible spatial encoding magnetic fields. In the array structure, time fidelity of gradient current waveforms decreases due to high mutual coupling between gradient coils. Here we propose a closed-loop feedback in combination with feedforward to compensate for errors in the gradient current waveforms. A real-time digital PID controller is designed by considering the transfer function of the array system. The controller updates the applied voltage on the gradient coil by changing the duty cycle of pulse-width modulated (PWM) signals to decrease the error between desired and measured currents.\n\n4236.\n\nAnalysis of Peripheral Nerve Stimulation in Asymmetric Non-folded and Folded Head Gradient Coil Design\n\nYihe Hua1, Desmond T.B.

However, further studies are needed to identify the sources of error and improve the precision of the field estimations towards a practical encoding system.\n\n4239.\n\nAdaptive Deadtime Compensation Control for MRI Gradient Amplifier\n\nHuan Hu1, Juan A Sabate1, and Ruxi Wang2\n\n1GE Global Research, Niskayuna, NY, United States, 2GE Aviation, Dayton, OH, United States\n\nView the Poster\n\nMRI gradient amplifier needs to provide current with extremely high fidelity to the commanded values of any arbitrary shape. Therefore, the control requires very accurate compensations of nonlinearities. One of the major sources is the deadtime among the power semiconductor devices. The existing deadtime compensation was to pre-test the specific system with different current commands and summarize a look-up table for use, which required lots of time and effort and cannot be used for different systems. This abstract demonstrates an adaptive deadtime compensation method which works well under different current commands and different systems without additional hardware cost.\n\n4240.\n\nGradient induced heating of components used in RF coil design\n\nManuela B.

The amplifier has less losses and is more compact, however switching has higher high frequency contents. The new amplifier was tested in an EMI shielded room. The results show the effectiveness of the double shielding method at reducing the radiated noise generated by a gradient driver system. The tests confirmed the correlation between the conducted and radiated noise. The double shielding method proposed reduced the radiated noise caused by the CM circulating current between cables.

In this work, we investigated the receive performance of different kinds of arrays with self-decoupled loops (SDLs) or/and self-decoupled folded dipoles (SDFDs). These coils have dipole-like as well as loop-like patterns and are highly isolated. We found that the combination of SDL and SDFD exhibits considerable improvement for both peripheral/central SNR and parallel imaging, even compared to mixed loop+dipole arrays.\n\n4251.\n\nPositional Sensitivity of Specific Absorption Rate in Head at 7T\n\nAmer Ajanovic1, Joseph V Hajnal1,2, and Shaihan Malik1,2\n\n1Biomedical Engineering Department, School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom, 2Centre for the Developing Brain, School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom\n\nView the Poster\n\nOne of the main problems at UHF resonance frequencies is the significant spatial variation in radiofrequency electromagnetic fields.

The most common EM simulation software requires spatial discretization which can, for narrow objects like elongated conductors, become computationally heavy and time consuming. To avoid that, such objects are typically discretized suboptimally.

By placing the dipole coil along the central axis of the loop coil, they are naturally decoupled due to the orthogonality of their polarised fields. Compared with a traditional 8-element static dipole coil array, the RRFCA is designed to provide better B1 shimming and SAR control performance benefited from the physical rotation. In addition, with eight coil elements, SNR will be improved compared to the previously developed 4-element RRFCA.\n\n4260.\n\nTheoretical Design and Image Reconstruction of an 8-element Receive-only Surface Coil Array for the 1.0 T Australian MRI-Linac System\n\nMingyan Li1, Ewald Weber1, Aurelien Destruel1, Feng Liu1, and Stuart Crozier1\n\n1School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia\n\nView the Poster\n\nThe whole-body coil of the Australian MRI-Linac system can produce images without interfering with the Linac beam during radiotherapy. However, the whole-body coil is distant from the patient, causing lower SNR and is not parallel imaging capable. According to the radiotherapy treatment requirement, an 8-element surface coil array was designed to be radio-transparent and the corresponding imaging algorithms were developed for this coil array. The simulation results showed that the proposed coil array has improved SNR compared to the whole-body coil, and a reduction rate of three can be achieved in parallel imaging without prominent aliasing artefacts.\n\n4261.\n\nDesign optimization of unshielded 8Tx transmit arrays for the head consisting of loops or dipoles at 7 Tesla\n\nCarel Costijn van Leeuwen1, Cornelis A.T. van den Berg1, Dennis Klomp1, and Alexander J.E.

However, for certain applications an unshielded head coil array is required. This study explores different designs for unshielded head coil arrays using simulations. Using L-curves, the tradeoff which exists between power efficiency, homogeneity and SAR is evaluated for arrays consisting of loops and dipoles of various dimensions. Loops are found to be superior to dipoles. Small loops yield the highest power efficiency, while larger loops improve homogeneity and SAR efficiency.\n\n4262.\n\nRapid parametric optimization of transmit coil arrays: a proof-of-concept\n\nJose EC Serralles1, Elfar Adalsteinsson1, Lawrence L Wald2, and Luca Daniel1\n\n1Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States, 2A.

Arcan Erturk1, Russell L Lagore1, Gregor Adriany1, and Gregory J Metzger1\n\n1Center for Magnetic Resonance Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States\n\nView the Poster\n\nA novel combined shielded-loop-resonator (SLR) and dipole antenna 16-channel transceiver body imaging array (16-SLR-D) is designed by combining eight pairs of dipole antennae and 10x20cm2 SLRs. Performance of the 16-SLR-D is compared against a 16-channel loop-dipole (16-L-D) array through finite-difference-time-domain simulations. Despite the larger loops size and closer placement of the elements, 16-SLR-D design has significantly improved coupling performance with less than 6% power coupled to other channels on average, compared to ~16% of average power coupling of 16-L-D. The combined SLR-dipole array(16-SLR-D) demonstrated ~+15% in transmit efficiency(mT/W0.5), ~+9% in transmit SAR efficiency (mT/SAR0.5) and ~+6% SNR inside the prostate.\n\n4264.\n\nCAST: A multi-scale Convolutional neural network based Automated hippocampal subfield Segmentation Toolbox\n\nZhengshi Yang1, Xiaowei Zhuang1, Karthik Sreenivasan1, Virendra Mishra1, and Dietmar Cordes1,2\n\n1Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Las Vegas, NV, United States, 2Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, United States\n\nWatch the Video\n\nThe segmentation of human hippocampal subfields on in vivo MRI has gained great interest in the last decade, because these anatomic subregions were found to be highly specialized in recent studies and are potentially affected differentially by normal aging, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, major depressive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. However, manually segmenting hippocampal subfields is labor-intensive and time-consuming, which limits the study to a small sample size. We developed a multi-scale Convolutional neural network based Automated hippocampal subfield Segmentation Toolbox (CAST) for automated segmentation, which can be easily trained and output segmented images in one minute.\n\n4265.\n\nElectromagnetic simulation analysis of an RF burn injury due to an ECG lead\n\nKiyoi Okamoto1, Minghui Tang2, and Toru Yamamoto2\n\n1Graduate School of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan, 2Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan\n\nView the Poster\n\nIt is commonly believed that forming of a conductive loop in an MRI scanner is dangerous because a loop induces a large electric current by the RF excitation and causes RF burn injuries. To verify this belief, we modeled an RF burn injury case, which was caused by an ECG lead, on an electromagnetic analysis software, and simulated SAR and electric field. A large SAR that causes RF burns was confirmed with and without looping that induced small electric field not to cause RF burns. It was suggested that loop formation is not a major cause of RF heating.\n\n4266.\n\nB1+ dependency on frequency in four human organs in three body models for 23Na, 13C and 31P whole-body birdcages at 7T.\n\nRia Forner1, Janot P.

Three models and four imaging targets have been investigated. Although B1+ efficiency generally decreases with frequency, we show that the SAR efficiency, ( B1+/√SAR ) stays more or less constant over the investigated frequencies. Furthermore, it is shown that although every model and every imaging target has one optimal relative phase setting between the birdcage ports, for each frequency there exists one generic phase setting that provides only a minimal drop in performance over all imaging targets and models.\n\n4267.\n\nQuantification of microscopic spatial resolution on MR-scanners using micro-phantoms manufactured with Deep-Xray Lithography\n\nAndreas Georg Berg1 and Martin Börner2\n\n1Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, 2Karlsruhe Nano Micro Facility (KNMF), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany\n\nPoster Permission Withheld\n\nQuality control for systematic improvements in spatial resolution up to the microscopy range becomes increasingly relevant not only for preclinical imaging but also for High Field MR human scanners. The design, manufacturing technology, a prototype phantom and an exemplary evaluation for qualitative and quantitative measurement of the spatial resolution of MR-scanners claimed to offer spatial resolutions better than 100µm is presented.

Phantoms are required in order to test quantitative pulse sequences, and it becomes increasingly important that artifacts in phantoms be as similar as possible to those observed in vivo. In this study, a 3D printed three-compartment spherical phantom was designed to evaluate chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), magnetization transfer (MT), and T1 mapping sequences on UHF MRI systems.\n\n4273.\n\nFlexible transmit/receive multi-gap coaxial coils for 7 T MRI\n\nLena Nohava1,2, Raphaela Czerny2, Michael Obermann1,2, Jacques Felblinger3, Roberta Frass-Kriegl2, Jean-Christophe Ginefri1, and Elmar Laistler2\n\n1IR4M (Imagerie par Résonance Magnétique et Multi-Modalités), UMR8081, Université Paris-Sud/CNRS, Université Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France, 2Division MR Physics, Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, 3Université de Lorraine, Inserm, IADI, Nancy, France\n\nView the Poster\n\nWe propose flexible multi-gap transmit/receive coaxial coils for 7 T MRI with 4, 7, 10 and 15 cm loop diameters, targeting different anatomies with large inter-subject variability and the need for close-fitting coil design.

Cable traps are necessary to suppress these common-mode currents in Magnetic Resonance environments. Floating cable traps, which allow for repositioning and reuse and eliminate the need to solder directly to cabling, have previously been reported as custom-manufactured apparatuses1. To streamline the manufacturing of floating cable traps and reduce manufacturing cost, we have designed 3D-printable versions that only require the addition of copper circuitry (e.g., tape/PCB) and lumped elements.\n\n4275.\n\nTwo-Channel, Stretchable, and Flexible Breast Coil Array\n\nJana Vincent1,2 and Joseph Rispoli1,3\n\n1Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States, 2Basic Medical Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States, 3School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States\n\nWatch the Video\n\nGiven the decrease in mammography sensitivity for those with denser breast tissue, MRI is often utilized for supplemental screening. Here we present a stretchable, flexible, two-channel breast RF coil array that allows for a customized fit to the breast and closest possible positioning to the skin. This coil array was created by utilizing conductive thread, stitched onto polyester/spandex blend fabric. Clear images of both the phantom and in-vivo were obtained. Omnidirectional stretching provided increased patient comfort and customized fit. With this close proximity, greater sensitivity can be achieved when compared to traditional breast coils.\n\n4276.\n\nInvestigation of pTx pulses for magnetisation inversion on 7T Terra\n\nBelinda Ding1, Christopher Wickens1, Iulius Dragonu2, Catarina Rua1, Saba Shirvani1, Patrick Liebig3, Robin Heidemann3, Guy B Williams1, and Christopher T Rodgers1\n\n1Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 2Siemens Healthcare Limited, Firmley, United Kingdom, 3Siemens Healthcare Limited, Erlangen, Germany\n\nView the Poster\n\nWe compare performance of two approaches for magnetisation inversion on a Siemens 7T Terra scanner, with 8Tx32Rx Nova head coil. We compared 3D non-selective pTx pulses designed in the scanner’s online pulse design tool, against traditional adiabatic pulses in both phantoms and the brain of a volunteer. We observe that spiral pTx pulses have substantially lower SAR burden than adiabatic hyperbolic secant pulses, but using the default parameter sets, the spiral inversion is less homogeneous. Thus, spiral pTx pulses are advantageous in SAR limited sequences, and further optimisation is likely to improve the inversion efficiency of these pulses.\n\n4277.\n\nHigh resolved 13C MRS of myo-Inositol C1-C6 in the human brain in vivo at 7T\n\nEulalia Serés Roig1 and Rolf Gruetter1,2,3\n\n1Laboratory of Functional and Metabolic Imaging (LIFMET) - Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland, 2Centre d'Imagerie BioMédicale - Animal and Imaging Technology (CIBM-AIT) - Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland, 3Department of Radiology, Universities of Lausanne (UNIL) and Geneva (UNIGE), Lausanne, Switzerland\n\nPoster Permission Withheld\n\nThe quantification of metabolite signals in the 1H-spectrum of the human brain in vivo is complicated by an extensive spectral overlap of resonances, due to the restricted chemical shift dispersion of the 1H-nucleus. For instance, the myo-Inositol peaks observable in the 1H-spectrum at 7T are close the water resonance and overlap with that of glycine. In contrast, the high resolution of the 13C-MR spectrum aids in the interpretation of the highly sensitive but poorly resolved 1H-MR spectrum. In this study, we demonstrate the advantage of 13C-MRS at 7T by measuring high resolved myo-Inositol C1-C6 resonances in the human brain.\n\n4278.\n\nA Quantitative Analysis on Patient-induced B0 Field Inhomogeneity at 1.5T MRI System\n\nLiyuan Jin1, Yaan Ge1, Qilin Lu1, Qingyu Dai1, and Kun Wang1\n\n1GE Healthcare, Beijing, China\n\nWatch the Video\n\nThis abstract investigated the method for quantitatively predicting B0 variation induced by human body. Magnetic field simulation was performed, with human phantom positioned in different strength’s B0 fields, and revealed the linear relationship between patient-induced B0 inhomogeneity and the background B0 field. The linear relationship was proved in clinical experiment, which used the relationship to predict B0 field map and compared the predicted B0 field map with the real B0 field map. The clinical experiment shows that 95% voxels has a prediction accuracy within 50Hz. The finding could further benefit image quality and improve scan workflow.\n\n4279.\n\nAnalysis of the effects of Absorptive Switch v/s Reflective Switch on the performance of Hybrid Coupler designed for Birdcage coil at 1.5T MR System\n\nNiraj Shalikram Yadav1, Miheer Pradeep Mayekar1, Rajesh Harsh1, and Vishal Dinesh Boricha1\n\n1TID, Society For Applied Microwave Electronics Engineering & Research, Mumbai, India\n\nWatch the Video\n\nVolume coils such as the Birdcage Coil possess homogeneous magnetic fields due to circularly polarized fields assisted by the Hybrid Coupler. To perform the complete operation of the birdcage coil for imaging, the Transmit power must be well isolated from the receive front end which is done by introducing RF switches in the receive path. However, Reflective switches cause impedance mismatch at the ports of the coupler. This work demonstrates an absorptive switch due to which the impedance mismatch problem is solved. Also, comparative analysis were done for both the type of RF switches.\n\n4280.\n\nMiniaturized Quadrature Hybrid Coupler Using Coaxial Cable with Inductive Loading for 1.5T MRI System\n\nRohit Apurva1, Niraj Yadav1, Miheer Mayekar1, Bhaskara Naik1, Tapas Bhuiya1, and Rajesh Harsh1\n\n1Technology Innovation Department, Society for Applied Microwave Electronics Engineering and Research, Mumbai, India\n\nWatch the Video\n\nTo improve the homogeneity of magnetic field and SNR of the Image by a factor of , quadrature feeding is required.

In this work we describe two methods to get rid of applied off-resonance signal from the receive signal. Both Tx cancelling and RF filter methods can be integrated into the RF chain to reduce the power of the off-resonance signal. It was found that using an RF filter was more effective for both blocking off-resonance signal and keeping receive signal. It was also demonstrated that the combination of two methods is promising in terms of reducing the off-resonance signal.\n\n4283.\n\nBody imaging at 7T: Comparison of the transmit/receive performance of microstrip antennas and fractionated dipoles\n\nJonathan K.

A PET detector with front-end electronics was implemented 40 mm far from the RF shields. Phantom studies revealed no RF pickup noise in any of these cases. A maximum 16% reduction in SNR was seen for the microstrip coil between PET detector powered OFF and ON conditions.

We propose to use the noise navigator, a passive self-navigation method based on the physiological motion-induced modulation of the thermal noise variance measured by an RF receive coil, which does not require additional hardware and is inherently synchronized with MR acquisition.\n\n4293.\n\nDesign considerations for short-wave motion tracking\n\nChristoph Michael Schildknecht1, David Otto Brunner1, Thomas Schmid1, and Klaas Paul Pruessmann1\n\n1Institute for Biomedical Engineering, ETH Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland\n\nWatch the Video\n\nRF short-wave based motion tracking offers interesting prospects by allowing to localize markers without line of site, minimal interaction with the MRI scanner, very short latency and high precision. The design of the employed antenna arrays is however determinant for the performance of the entire system and subject to various requirements. The design criteria and parameters have hence been analyzed and used for optimization of the receiver array geometry. The resulting arrays have then been evaluated using signal simulations as well implemented and verified by bench measurements using a robotic positioning system as reference.\n\n4294.\n\nA Context-Aware Deep Attention Network for Thalamus Segmentation using 7T Multi-Modal MRI\n\nJinyoung Kim1, Rémi Patriat1, Oren Rosenberg1, and Noam Harel1\n\n1Center for Magnetic Resonance Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States\n\nView the Poster\n\nIn this study, we leverage 7T MR multi-modality and deep neural networks for accurate and efficient segmentation of the thalamus. Our contributions are 1) to build a dual-pathway and feature pyramid scheme to simultaneously encode global contextual information and local details within an encoder-decoder network; 2) to learn the optimal combination of global and local attentions to increase the feature representation power by adaptively recalibrating feature maps in an end-to-end manner. The proposed framework shows state-of-the-art performance on segmentation of the thalamus with 7T multi-modal MRI in an automatic and efficient way.\n\n4295.\n\nOn the way to routine cardiac MRI at 7Tesla- using what we have\n\nTheresa Reiter1,2, David Lohr2, Michael Hock2, Markus Johannes Ankenbrand2, Maria Roxana Stefanescu2, Maxim Terekhov2, and Laura Maria Schreiber2\n\n1Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany, 2Chair of Cellular and Molecular Imaging, Comprehensive Heart Failure Centre (CHCF), University Hospital Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany\n\nView the Poster\n\nThe establishment of human cardiac MRI in the setting of ultra highfield MRI puts high demands on hardware, sequences and handling of the examinees. Practical and safety relevant limitations are set for extensive modifications regarding hardware and sequence. As a consequence, human based factors play a paramount role in the success of a routinely used cardiac imaging study at 7T. We report our experiences from 71 volunteers with cardiac MRI scans with the aim to increase the understanding of the practical implementation of cardiac MRI and factors that influence and do not influence image quality in this specific setting.\n\n4296.\n\nOptimizing Efficiency of Coupled Class-E RF Amplifiers for a Transmit Array System in 1.5 T\n\nSaid Aldemir1, Fatima tu Zahra2, Redi Poni3, and Ergin Atalar4\n\n1Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, 2-, Ankara, Turkey, 3ETH Zurich, Zurich, Sweden, 4Electrical Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey\n\nWatch the Video\n\nIn this work, performance of coupled Class-E amplifiers in a transmit array system is investigated. Conditions for these nonlinear amplifiers to work efficiently with desired output power are determined. Also a tuning procedure mitigating undesired effects of coupling on the performance of these nonlinear amplifiers is explained. Simulations are performed in ADS 2016 with 2 Class-E amplifiers and different coupling levels are tested. MRI experiment is performed in order to observe the effects of coupling on amplifier performance. With contour plots, how overall performance of the system is affected by phase and amplitude of an amplifier channel is investigated."
