        "text": "The green environmental zone can be recognized by the traffic signs 270.1 and 270.2.\n\nIn front of each zone there is the sign 270.1 with an additional sign for the permitted sticker.\n\nThe end of the low emission zone is shown by the sign 270.2.\n\nIn our Green Zones App we have a detailed map of each low emission zone. So you can easily see the boundaries and avoid penalties.\n\nYes, a lot of them. With over 80 different environmental zones, Germany has one of the most in Europe.\n\nIn our Green Zones App we have gathered together all the low emission zones in Europe and presented them clearly.\n\nYes! However, the sticker for electric vehicles is not intended for everyone. If the vehicle is registered in Germany, the last character on the license plate can be an \"E\". However, if the vehicle is registered abroad, an electric sticker (E-sticker) is required.\n\nThe E-sticker gives you various advantages. Depending on the municipality, there are various advantages, such as the use of bus lanes, free parking on the road and at electricity charging points, as well as the possible use of otherwise closed roads.\n\nYes, every car, no matter whether it is being driven on with petrol, diesel or electricity, requires a green environmental sticker according to the law. The E-sticker also entitles you to additional advantages over non-electric vehicles. The 35th BImSchV does not provide a separate paragraph for electric vehicles, which regulates them as an exception. Therefore: If an electric vehicle drives into a green environmental zone without a green sticker, a fine of 80 € + approx. 25 € handling fee must be expected."
