        "text": "(Updated in 2023) I know what you’re thinking: “Tulip fields in Germany? Wait. Don’t you mean, ‘Drive to the Netherlands and see the tulips there?'”\n\nNope! You can see rows and rows of gorgeous flowers during springtime right in Deutschland.\n\nAre these tulip fields in Germany as grand as those in its neighboring country?\n\nNo.\n\nBut they are just as pretty and fill that desire to see gorgeous blooming tulips right in Germany if you can’t make it over to Holland…or just want to see some closer to home.\n\nI hope everyone gets to see tulip fields at least once in their lifetime; it’s one thing to see them in photos, but to see just how vibrant they are in real life is such a site to see.\n\nAt one point, after we had been in the field for a little while, my middle child got so excited.\n\nClutching her hand over her mouth, she started jumping up and down, overjoyed with the scene before her.\n\nShe said it looked like the flowers morphed into a rainbow carpet and was spread out before our eyes.\n\nI love that she let the joy literally exude out of her and got to experience seeing something so beautiful.\n\nPro tip: If you visit this particular field*, walk along the path away from the tulip stoll. Turn back once you’ve reached the end and then look at the site before your eyes for the best view of that “rainbow carpet” she saw.\n\n*they change fields seasonally. See the “Location” section below.\n\nEverything you need to know about seeing tulip fields in Germany.\n\nIf you’re looking for the best places to see tulips in the Netherlands, this is the post for you.\n\nLocations for Tulip Fields in Germany\n\nTulip Fields in Germany: Grevenbroich\n\nThe town of Grevenbroich, just southwest of Düsseldorf has around 100 hectares (250 acres) of tulip fields, but the actual location fluctuates from season to season.\n\nTo find the exact location of the tulip fields in Germany in 2023*, type “Tulpenfelder Paulushof” into Google Maps and it will take you right to it.\n\n*Note: This should be updated by Google sometime in April\n\nYou can follow the tulip field’s Instagram and Tulpenhof Francken on Facebook for some updates, and the exact location each year (the fields change seasonally).⁠⁠\n\nTulip Fields in Germany: Neuss\n\nNot far from the tulip field in Grevenbroich is another spot near the town of Neuss.\n\nFull disclosure: I haven’t been to this particular tulip field in Germany, but I plan to this year. Degenhardt Flora has fields and often has tulip stands where you can buy fresh tulips. Keep an eye on their Facebook page for more info.\n\nYou can also type “Degenhardt Flora GmbH” into Google to see where their fields might be this year; I’ll update this once I have more info.\n\nThere is also a “Tulip Field Cafe” near this particular area, too. I’m just not sure if the two are related quite yet.\n\nWhen to Visit the Tulip Fields in Germany\n\nKnowing when to visit a tulip field in Germany is key. Show up too early and you just see a sea of green. Get there too late and the vibrant colors are chopped off and on their way out.\n\nWhat Season to Visit\n\nMid to late April seems to be the sweet spot for seeing the tulips at their best. They usually stick around until the first week of May; that’s when you’ll start to see them chop them down.\n\nIf you can plan it right, you could see the cherry blossom street in Bonn, Germany, and then drive an hour north to see the tulip fields!\n\nImportant Info for the Tulip Fields in Germany\n\nCost\n\nIt is free to visit, but be an awesome person and support the field.\n\nBring some euros with you and plan on buying some flowers to take home. =\n\nParking\n\nParking is free, and there is a small lot near the tulip stall. There was nobody monitoring this lot while we were there. Depending on where the fields are, you may end up parking on the street.\n\nBathrooms\n\nThere were NO public bathrooms at this tulip field. However, there is the Nikolauskloster (a monastery) around the corner, and it’s rumored that there are restrooms you can use. I cannot officially confirm this since we didn’t use their facilities, so if you go there, please let me know and I can update this post!\n\nSchloss Dyck is also nearby and I highly recommend exploring the castle and castle grounds before/after you see the tulip fields. There is a cost, but it’s well worth it.\n\nWhat To Wear for Tulip Fields in Germany\n\nThree things to keep in mind when you’re picking out what to wear:\n\nPick shoes wisely. You’re going to be traipsing through a field, so if it recently rained the night before, there will be mud! Choose accordingly when picking your shoes.\n\nIt gets windy. Again, you’re out in a field and it can get windy while you’re out there. Keep that in mind if you decide to wear a dress…especially a short dress, wink wink.\n\nTry not to clash. If you’re planning on taking photos, keep in mind that the tulips are quite colorful, so stick to light-colored outfits. Admittedly, my oldest picked her own dress and I didn’t stop her but possibly should have. Her green dress was almost the same color as some of the leaves. We saw different shades of red, orange, purple, pink, white, and yellow tulips.\n\nHave you been to a tulip field in Germany?\n\nIf you’ve seen tulips in Germany I’d love to hear about it and include it in this post.\n\nWhere to See Even More Tulips"
