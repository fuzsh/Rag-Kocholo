        "text": "Reutlingen\n\nGermany\n\nReutlingen, city, Baden-Württemberg Land (state), southwestern Germany. It lies on the Echaz River below the Achalm mountain in the Swabian Alps (Schwäbische Alb), south of Stuttgart. Founded by Frederick II, it was chartered in the early 13th century and later became a free imperial city (until 1802). Reutlingen was the scene of the Swabian League’s decisive victory over Count Ulrich of Württemberg in 1377. Electronics and machinery production dominate manufacturing, though there is some textile and clothing production, the former once an important sector in the city’s economy. The Tübinger (13th century) and Garden (14th century) gates remain of the old fortifications. There are numerous high-gabled, half-timbered houses and several Gothic churches—including the Marienkirche (begun 1247), which has 14th-century frescoes, an octagonal font (1499), and a replica of the Holy Sepulchre (1500). There are also municipal and natural-history museums. The economist Friedrich List was born in Reutlingen in 1789. Pop. (2003 est.) 112,346.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Amy Tikkanen."
