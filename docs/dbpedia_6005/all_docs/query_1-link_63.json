The response rates ranged from 15.3% to 43.9%. For the analysis presented here, we evaluated the data of 25 712 participants who had attended for the first time and had not yet been vaccinated ( ). Proportions of self-reported chronic conditions varied across regions and sampling periods. For example, the prevalence of diabetes ranged from 4% in Freiburg (July 2020) to 10.1% in Magdeburg (November 2020) ( , eSupplement-Table 1). The proportion of daily smokers was 9.9% in Freiburg (November 2020) and 23.8% in Greifswald. Seventy-seven percent of the participants shared a household with other persons, including children in 23.5%, and 17.6% lived alone. The proportion of individuals with higher education ranged from 38% (Chemnitz) to 70.2% (Freiburg). The proportion of participants who experienced no changes in their working life varied between 61.9% in Magdeburg (November 2020) and 21% in Aachen (February 2021) and Freiburg (November 2020) (eSupplement-Table 1).\n\nTable 1\n\nCategory Total N % Total population 25 712100.0 Age group (years) 18–2521638.4 26–45773830.1 46–6510 41140.5 66–79441917.2 >799813.8 Sex Female14 18955.2 Male11 51744.8Predisposing diseases Diabetes14295.6 Hypertension624924.3 Cardiovascular diseases23049.0 Chronic lung disease19287.5 Cancer6192.4 Immunosuppressed8573.3 Smoking Yes, daily347213.5 Never 12 67649.3 Household size (residents) Lives alone452117.6 Lives with more than three ‧persons13695.3 Lives with one to three persons18 41271.6 Education Certificate after 9 years315412.3 Certificate after 10 years755729.4 Higher education certificate13 45352.3 No certificate1430.6 Occupation Employed13 66653.2 Self-employed14755.7 Unemployed3861.5 School student/retired6 99627.2 Changes due to COVID No changes999438.9 Working from home512719.9\n\nSymptoms, exposure, quarantine, and testing\n\nFifty percent of all participants reported no symptoms after February 2020.

Household members of 25.1% of the participants and in total 28.2% of the participants themselves (n = 7256; eSupplement-Table 2) had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 (self-reported PCR or rapid antigen tests). Three hundred thirteen participants (eSupplement-Table 3) had tested positive (Euroimmun). The proportion of household members ever tested for SARS-CoV-2 varied across regions and sampling times from 7.7% in Reutlingen (July 2020) to 60.0% in Greifswald (May 2021).\n\nSeroprevalence estimates\n\nIn eSupplement-Table 4 we report unweighted seroprevalences. Weighted according to age- and sex-specific distribution in the general population, seroprevalences were 2.6% in Reutlingen (July 2020), 1.5% in Freiburg (August 2020), 2.3% in Aachen (September 2020), 1.3% in Osnabrück and 2.8% in Reutlingen (October 2020), and 2.4% in both Freiburg and Magdeburg (November 2020). After the vaccination campaign had started, weighted seroprevalence estimates in those not vaccinated were 5.4% in Aachen (February 2021), 13.1% in Chemnitz and 4.1% in Osnabrück (March 2021), 6.0% in Magdeburg (April 2021), and 11.6% in Greifswald (May 2021). The last district sampled was Chemnitz (second sample, July 2021); the weighted seroprevalence among the unvaccinated was 32.4% ( , eSupplement-Table 4).\n\nWeighted seroprevalence estimates adjusted for test performance (eSupplement-Table 5) were 2.0% in Reutlingen (July 2020), 1.2% in Freiburg (August 2020), 2.0% in Aachen (September 2020), 1.1% in Osnabrück and 2.1% in Reutlingen (October 2020), 2.0% in both Freiburg and Magdeburg (November 2020), 5.2% in Aachen (February 2021), 14.3% in Chemnitz and 3.7% in Osnabrück (March 2021), 9.2% in Magdeburg (April 2021), 13.6% in Greifswald (May 2021), and 37.4% in Chemnitz (July 2021).\n\nSeroprevalence was age dependent and was highest in the age group > 79 or > 59 years (eSupplement-Table 4).\n\nSurveillance sensitivity\n\nWe express surveillance sensitivity as the ratio of the infected cases detected by serological analysis to the reported cases. The ratios (calculated on the basis of weighted seroprevalences) were 4.1 (Reutlingen, July 2020), 3.0 (Freiburg, August 2020), 4.9 (Aachen, September 2020), 2.6 (Osnabrück) and 3.5 (Reutlingen; both October 2020), 5.1 (Magdeburg) and 2.2 (Freiburg; both November 2020), 1.8 (Aachen, February 2021), 2.9 (Chemnitz) and 1.3 (Osnabrück; both March 2021), 2.8 (Magdeburg, April 2021), and 2.9 (Greifswald, May 2021) ( , eSupplement-Table 4). In Chemnitz the SDR was 4.5 in the unvaccinated, with a high proportion of self-reported known SARS-CoV-2 infections (17.3%) (July 2021) ( , eSupplement-Tables 2 and 4).\n\nInfection fatality estimates\n\nThe IFR over all age groups were 1.3% [95% confidence interval] [1.0; 1.7] (Reutlingen, July 2020), 2.4% [1.8; 3.3] (Freiburg, August 2020), 1.0% [0.7; 1.3] (Aachen, September 2020), 1.6% [1.2; 2.1] (Osnabrück) and 1.2% [0.9; 1.6] (Reutlingen; both October 2020), 0.3% [0.2; 0.4] (Magdeburg) and 1.7% [1.1; 2.0] (Freiburg; both November 2020), 1.5 [1.3; 1.8] (Aachen, February 2021), 1.4% [1.3; 1.6] (Chemnitz) and 1.9% [1.5; 2.5] (Osnabrück; both March 2021), 1.2% [0.8; 2.0] (Magdeburg, April 2021), 1.2% [1.0; 1.4] (Greifswald, May 2021), and 0.8% [0.7; 1.0] (Chemnitz, July 2021). The IFR were highest in the oldest age group (>79) (eSupplement-Table 4).\n\nExposure to SARS-CoV-2 and risk of seropositivity\n\nAmong the 608 persons who reported having had a previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, between 81% (Freiburg/Greifswald) and 86% (Chemnitz) were seropositive in our analysis.\n\nFourteen percent of those ever quarantined were seropositive, in contrast to 2.1% of those who had not been quarantined. This yields an nnq of 8.5 [8.1; 8.8] persons who have to be quarantined in order to include one infected person.\n\nIn a logistic regression, participants who reported two typical COVID-19 symptoms during recent months were more likely to be seropositive (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.7 [3.2; 4.3]) (eSupplement-Table 6).\n\nMultivariable analysis\n\nA weighted logistic regression accounting for clustering by study region revealed evidence of a higher risk of seropositivity in participants with a general secondary school certificate than in those with a university entrance level certificate (aOR 1.7 [1.2; 2.4]. The risk of a seropositive result was lower in daily smokers (aOR 0.4 [0.3; 0.7]) ( ).\n\nTable 3\n\nProportion (%) of all participants included (N = 16 476) Proportion (%) seropositive (N = 255; 1.5%) aOR *2 95% CI Age group (years) 18–258.42.31.3[0.8; 2.0] 26–4529.71.91.1[0.8; 1.5] 46–6540.01.91– 66–7916.81.80.9[0.6; 1.4] > 795.12.51.0[0.2; 5.5] Gender Male44.82.11.0[0.8; 1.4] Female55.21.91– Predisposing diseases No cardiovascular disease89.62.01– Cardiovascular disease10.41.90.9[0.3; 3.0] No diabetes mellitus93.91.91– Diabetes mellitus6.12.81.7[0.8; 3.3] No hypertension74.02.01– Hypertension26.02.01.0[0.7; 1.3] No chronic lung disease91.62.01– Chronic lung disease8.41.90.9[0.5; 1.5] No cancer97.52.01– Cancer2.51.91.2[0.4; 3.3] Tobacco consumption Never smoker49.62.11– Previous smoker30.92.11.0[0.6; 1.5] Occasional smoker5.32.21.1[0.3; 4.0] Daily smoker14.11.10.4[0.3; 0.7] District Rural32.11.91– Urban67.92.01.1[0.8; 1.7] Living situation Living alone18.31.61– Living with other adults56.21.91.2[0.8; 1.9] Youngest child < 1015.02.41.4[0.8; 3.5] Youngest child > 109.22.31.2[0.6; 4.4] No information on living situation1.31.7–– Education Higher education56.22.01– Certificate after 10 years28.01.30.7[0.5; 1.0] Certificate after 9 years14.22.91.7[1.2; 2.4] No certificate0.652.4[0.8; 7.3] No data1.02.32.6[0.5; 13.5] Employment status Unemployed35.32.01– Full/part time46.72.01.2[0.9; 1.5] Change in work situation No relevant changes59.11.91– Reduced working hours31.52.01.0[0.5; 2.1] Increased working hours9.42.00.9[0.7; 1.2]\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe findings of this study regarding seroprevalence and IFR during the course of the pandemic are in line with other available population-based reports from Germany (16). Comparable studies in Germany indicate low seroprevalences of between 0.4 and 1.4% with an under-reporting factor of 2–8 and IFR of 0.5–1.5% in studies up to November 2020 (4, 17, 18). Estimates in our study were similar among the study regions at similar times, especially up to November 2020. This is in contrast to earlier hotspot studies conducted in smaller communities (17).\n\nAmong participants sampled in Freiburg, Reutlingen, Aachen and Osnabrück up to October 2020, the majority of reported cases resulted from infections during the first wave, indicating seroprevalences below 3% and under-reporting (SDR 3–5) during this period. In study locations sampled either for the first or the second time during and after the second and third wave up to May 2021 (Reutlingen, Freiburg, Aachen, Chemnitz, Osnabrück, Vorpommern-Greifswald) an additional 2–10% of the population were infected. The comparably high seroprevalence (>30%) among the unvaccinated in Chemnitz in July 2021, with vaccination coverage > 65% in those recruited, is partly due to self-selection of participants with known infection but may also be an indicator of higher frequency of acquired infection in the unvaccinated.\n\nUnder-reporting of cases during the early months of the pandemic was higher in young adults and in 60- to 79-year-olds and decreased substantially, with SDRs between 1.3 and 2.9, after December 2020. The SDR in Chemnitz in July was probably overestimated due to the high number of unvaccinated persons with known confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The tendency towards lower under-reporting during the latter phase of the pandemic might be attributable to the fact that the eligibility criteria, strategy, and capacity for PCR testing in Germany changed over time, with increases in capacity particularly after April 2020 and after December 2020 (19, 20).\n\nIn most regions the IFR at our study sites ranged from 1% to 2.4%, the difference being attributable mainly to the age structure of the infected in these locations. This is also reflected in the age-specific IFR of the study locations, which is in line with previous estimates (16). The low estimate for the overall IFR in Magdeburg (November 2020) is largely explained by the seroprevalence, which reflects the early increase in cases during the second wave, and by our cut-off point for reported deaths, which was too early to show the actual IFR. If we had instead chosen a cut-off for reported deaths at the end of December, the IFR would have been in line with the other results and above 1% (18).\n\nOur findings suggest that a low level of education is one of the few factors that increase the risk of seropositivity. Lower educational level has been shown to raise barriers to isolation at home (21), probably because it is associated with lower socioeconomic status and certain kinds of work cannot be done at home (22).\n\nAs shown by previous studies (23), seroprevalence was lower in smokers than in non-smokers. For those infected, however, smoking is a risk factor for more severe disease (24). It is possible that this result is due to selection bias, as the proportion of smokers in our study is lower than in the German population as a whole. This means that among the smokers we recruited there may be more health-conscious individuals with a lower risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe nnq of 8.5 shows high contact tracing efficiency. This is in line with estimates of secondary infection rates of 7.2% in those who do not live in the same household vs. 13.0% in those who do (16). Our nnq is low compared with the figure found in population-wide contact tracing. There is little evidence on how this compares with other countries, underlining the importance of efficient contact tracing during the pandemic (25– 27).\n\nThe strengths of our study include its large sample size, the multilocal approach, and the sampling strategy. Its limitations include the sequential sampling; we did not measure the seroprevalence at all locations simultaneously. Measurement of under-reporting after 12/2020 may be overestimated, as we did not account for self-selection of participants with knowledge or suspicion of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The proportion of seropositive participants who also reported a positive PCR test indicates a higher waning of antibodies in regions where the second sampling was performed after a larger interval. Another limitation is that our results can only be generalized to adults who read German, as all study materials were provided solely in German and we only recruited adults.\n\nWe have presented results from a large SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study in Germany which indicates low seroprevalence from July to December 2020 and substantial additional infections from October 2020 to August 2021. Under-reporting of infections decreased after December 2020. The IFR was > 1% in most regions and was especially high in the elderly. Given the heterogeneity in age- and region-specific under-reporting estimates, we recommend that infrastructures be created to enable real-time estimation of population-based infection activity and that models incorporate regional age-specific under-reporting estimates to predict infection dynamics."
