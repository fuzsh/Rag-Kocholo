        "text": "From Freiburg to Frankfurt and from Ramstein to Reutlingen – on May 02, 2015, the best speakers of Toastmasters Division F meet in Mannheim. Winners of the previous Area contests compete against each other in the categories “International Speech” and “Evaluation speech”. The champions can proceed to Borås / West Sweden and present their speeches from 22.05–24.05 at the District Conference (D95, Europe North / East).\n\nAll those who are already member of a Toastmasters club or perhaps would like to be, are cordially invited to the event. It is an excellent way to get to know what Toastmasters provides: brilliant rhetoric, a warm and friendly atmosphere, inspiring exchange with others and know-how in leadership and organization. A buffet and drinks will be served. The event takes place at venue:\n\nBuergerhaus Neckarstadt-West,\n\nLutherstr. 15-17, 68169 Mannheim."
