Soviet writer Vasily Grossman was the first to link Himmler’s visit to the death camp to the Soviet victory at Stalingrad. Grossman was with the Red Army when it entered Treblinka in August 1944. Based on interviews with eyewitnesses and former camp workers he produced a harrowing account of the Nazi death camp.

Werth, Year of Stalingrad, pp. 443–446. In spite of these constraints, Alexander Werth was able to conduct and reproduce verbatim in-depth conversations with Generals Vasily Chuikov and Alexander Rodimtsev, two famous figures at Stalingrad whose much more detailed testimony figures in the present book. Werth, The Year of Stalingrad, pp. 456–460, 468–470.\n\n12. Nauchnyi arkhiv Instituta Rossiiskoi istorii Rossiiskoi Akademii nauk (NA IRI RAN).\n\n13. To illustrate the breadth of the interview corpus, Chapter 1 features many excerpts of voices from soldiers whose full transcripts did not enter the volume. A comprehensive online publication of the Stalingrad transcripts is planned.\n\n14. The best military histories of the battle are, from the Axis side, Manfred Kehrig, Stalingrad: Analyse und Dokumentation einer Schlacht (Stuttgart, 1979); from the Soviet side, A. M.

Grossman, Gody voiny [The War Years] (Moscow, 1989), p. 5. A Soviet writer and journalist, Grossman (1905–1964) reported to the front voluntarily in summer 1941. As a war correspondent he reported for the newspaper Red Star (Krasnaya zvezda), including the battle of Stalingrad and the battle of Berlin.\n\n17.

Colonel general Andrei Ivanovich Yeryomenko (1892–1970) was appointed commander of the Southeastern Front and the Stalingrad Front on August 12, 1942. On September 28, 1942, the Southeastern Front became part of the Stalingrad Front.\n\n23. Lieutenant General Konstantin Konstantinovich Rokossovsky (1896–1968) commanded the Don Front between September 1942 and January 1943.\n\n24.

General field marshal Erich von Manstein (1887–1973) was commander in chief of the Army Group Don between November 1942 and February 1943. The 6th Army formed part of this army group.\n\n29. The Turkic term “Kurgan” means burial mound. Mamayev Kurgan is named after the Tatar military commander Mamai, who is buried there. On military maps the elevation was labeled “Hill 102.0.”\n\n30. Werth, The Year of Stalingrad, p. 465.\n\n31. Between August 21 and October 17, 1942, the 6th Army recorded 40,000 deaths, as well as an estimated 100,000 deaths up until November 19. In addition, there were an estimated 30,000 deaths in the 4th Panzer Army. Glantz, Armaggedon in Stalingrad, p. 716; Rüdiger Overmans, “Das andere Gesicht des Krieges: Leben und Sterben der 6. Armee,” in Förster, ed., Stalingrad: Ereignis—Wirkung—Symbol, p. 446. 113,000 survivors: Manfred Kehrig, “Die 6. Armee im Kessel von Stalingrad, in Stalingrad,” in Förster, ed., Stalingrad, p. 109. Overmans estimated the number of Romanian allies in the Kessel as only 5,000 (Overmans, “Das andere Gesicht,” pp. 441–442). Soviet loss figures in G. F. Krivosheev, Soviet Casualties and Combat Losses in the Twentieth Century (London, 1997), pp. 125, 127; S. N. Michalev, Liudskie poteri v Velikoi Otechestvennoi voine 1941–1945 gg. Statisticheskoe issledovanie (Krasnoiarsk, 2000), p. 17–41; for higher estimates, see B. V. Sokolov, “The Cost of War: Human Losses for the USSR and Germany, 1939–1945,” Journal of Slavic Military Studies 9 (March 1996): 152–193. Sokolov contends that the precise numbers given in divisional and army staff reports, which Krivosheev uses for his analysis, embellish the horrendous actual casualty rates in the Red Army. These, he writes, can be established only indirectly.\n\n32.

Recent publications accentuate the ideological conditioning of everyday life at the front: Mark Edele and Michael Geyer, “States of Exception: The Nazi-Soviet War as a System of Violence, 1939–1945,” in Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared, ed.

Ian Kershaw asserts that the Führer cult in the German population had faded before Stalingrad, and for this reason he believes that the defeat in Stalingrad accelerated the loss of popular support for the regime. Ian Kershaw, The “Hitler Myth”: Image and Reality in the Third Reich (New York, 1987), pp. 188–190. Michael Geyer und Peter Fritzsche, however, reference other connections between the Nazi regime and the population, which were created during Stalingrad and intensified in the further course of the war: Germans increasingly began to see themselves as victims of a massive disaster. This national and European victim perspective was orchestrated by the Nazi leadership. See Michael Geyer, “Endkampf 1918 and 1945: German Nationalism, Annihilation, and Self-Destruction,” in No Man’s Land of Violence: Extreme Wars in the 20th Century, Alf Lüdtke and Bernd Weisbrod, eds.

See especially the multivolume series Russkii arkhiv: Velikaia Otechestvennaia, ed. V. A. Zolotarev (Moscow, 1993–2002), with numerous documents from the Central Archives of the Russian Ministry of Defense. A planned volume on the battle of Stalingrad (vol. 4, pt. 2) has not appeared in the series. Organy gosudarstvennoi bezopasnosti SSSR v Velikoi Otechestvennoi voine. Sbornik dokumentov, 5 vols. (Moscow, 1995–2007), draws on documents from the FSB archives. Stalingradskaia popeia, also prepared by archivists in the FSB, features abundant new material and is indispensable reading for any student of the battle. The same applies to the documents presented in Velikaia Otechestvennaia voina. 1942 god, ed. T. V. Volokitina and V. S. Khristoforov (Moscow, 2012).

In 2007 the Defense Ministry launched a website devoted to all Soviet personnel who were killed or went missing in action during the Great Patriotic War and its aftermath. The searchable site includes scans of documents from various archives that shed light on the fate and place of burial of a given soldier.

Speaking in October 1942, in the immediate wake of being liberated by Soviet troops, a Russian woman from a village near Rzhevsk had this to say about the Germans (she was talking to other villagers and was not aware that a Soviet newspaper correspondent was listening): “Well, we once thought that these Germans were cultured people. [ . . . ] But how shamelessly they undress in front of women, how they splash about in the trough, how they pollute the air when they are seated at the table, and how they urinate inside the hut! Is this what they call culture? Then they chase after girls and young women like wild stallions. Fall over them. [ . . . ] This is the culture of convicts. Shameless. [ . . . ] Are they like this in their own country as well?” Aleksei Surkov, “Zemlia pod peplem,” in Publitsistika perioda Velikoi Otechestvennoi voiny i pervykh poslevoennykh let (Moscow, 1985), pp. 135–141. Interviewed by the historians in Stalingrad, Lt. Col. Pyotr Molchanov of the 36th Rifle Division said: “The Germans prepared, obviously, to attack us. They pulled together their soldiers and attacked. To attack they did the following: they laid aside their uniforms, rolled up their shirt sleeves, many in their underwear, like bandits. So they attacked us.”\n\n56. Catherine Merridale, Ivan’s War: The Red Army 1939–45 (London, 2005), p. 320.\n\n57. Merridale, Ivan’s War, p. 94.\n\n58.

On October 14, 1944, the Central Committee criticized the lack of “political resilience” among many Red Army soldiers who were new to the party, and it ordered the Main Political Administration to intensify its “ideological and political education.” The decree was issued on the eve of the Red Army’s offensive into East Prussia; Soviet leaders must have been concerned over the political reliability of their own soldiers after entering enemy lands. A prominent victim of the new hard line was the later dissident Lev Kopelev, who served as a specialist for enemy propaganda in the Red Army. In April 1945 in Germany he was accused of “bourgeois humanism” and served almost ten years.\n\n75. Robert MacCoun et al., “Does Social Cohesion Determine Motivation in Combat? An Old Question with an Old Answer,” Armed Forces and Society 32 (2006); Thomas Kühne, Kameradschaft: Die Soldaten des nationalsozialistischen Krieges und das 20. Jahrhundert (Göttingen, 2011). The thesis was first advanced by Edmund Shils and Morris Janowitz, “Cohesion and Disintegration in the Wehrmacht in World War II,” Public Opinion Quarterly, Summer 1948, pp. 280–315, based on their interviews with German POWs. Samuel Stouffer et al., The American Soldier(Princeton, NJ, 1949) seemed to support this with American GIs.

Westbrook, The Political Education of Soldiers (Beverly Hills, CA, 1983), pp. 196–198. For the same reason, the Red Army did not follow the German model of a reserve army (Ersatzheer), which ensured that recovering soldiers would rotate back into their regionally identified units (see p. 385 for a Soviet officer suggesting that the Red Army adopt the German model). At a meeting with western correspondents in early 1943, Alexander Shcherbakov, the head of the Red Army’s Main Political Administration, became irritated when one of the journalists talked about a Russian tradition of military bravery: “Don’t talk to me about the Russian soul,” Shcherbakov retorted, “Let me recommend you to study the Soviet man.” Karel Berkhoff, Motherland in Danger: Soviet Propaganda during World War II (Cambridge, MA, 2012), p. 206.

According to Omer Bartov, the decimation of the primary groups prompted military commanders to increasingly rely on ideological indoctrination to mold troupe cohesion, which in turn explained the “barbarization” of German warfare in the east. Omer Bartov, The Eastern Front, 1941–45: German Troops and the Barbarization of Warfare, 2nd ed. (New York, 2001). Critics contend that Bartov’s thesis explains little, as fighting on the Eastern Front had been exceptionally violent from the start.

This emphasis, and along with it the education of fearlessness, had a prerevolutionary pedigree. General Mikhail Dragomirov (1830–1905) sought to inculcate a theory of morale among Tsarist troops that was built on similar principles. Dragomirov believed that the essence of victory was to impose one’s own will on the enemy. He also regarded the bayonet attack as the decisive action in battle. The parallels with Bolshevik ideas of a “psychic attack” and the Soviet preference for the Hoorah battle call in infantry attacks are obvious.

The penalties threatened in Order no. 227 were nothing new. Blocking units and penal companies had been with the Red Army since its creation in 1918. Abolished after the Civil War, they were revived in military campaigns in the Far East in 1938 and 1939, and then in the Winter War with Finland. They appeared again in various sectors of the German-Soviet front starting in late June 1941. V. O. Daines, Shtrafbaty i zagradotriady Krasnoi Armii (Moscow, 2008); Cherkasov, “O formirovanii i primenenii v Krasnoi armii zagradotriadov.” What was new about Order no. 227 was its reach: it was to be read to all soldiers of the Red Army. Stalin referred to Order no. 227 as a copy of disciplinary measures that the German army applied to its own soldiers in the fighting around Moscow. For this reason historian Mikhail Miagkov claims that in December 1941 the German side formed blocking detachments. M. Iu. Miagkov, Vermakht u vorot Moskvy 1941–1942 (Moscow, 1999), pp. 218–219. The relevant literature contains no mention of such measures: Christian Hartmann, Wehrmacht im Ostkrieg: Front und militärisches Hinterland, 1941/42(Munich, 2009); Hürter, Hitlers Heerführer. The blocking units in the Red Army were abolished in October 1944.\n\n167. Ordinary soldier offenders were dispatched to penal companies; officers charged with cowardice or desertion were sent to separate penal battalions.\n\n168. NA IRI RAN, f. 2, razd.

Order no. 227 addressed this problem squarely: “There is a lack of order and discipline in the companies, regiments, and divisions, with the armored force, the flying squadrons. This is currently our biggest deficiency. We need to introduce in our army the strictest order and an iron discipline, if we want to save the situation and defend our homeland successfully.” Prikazy narodnogo komissara oborony SSSR, p. 277.\n\n175. See interviews with Pyotr Zayonchkovsky und Alexander Shelyubsky.\n\n176. Acting in this manner, Kurvantyev meticulously implemented Stalin’s Order no. 270 of August 1941, which called on Red Army soldiers, regardless of their rank, to shoot their commanders if they abandoned their positions.\n\n177.

Soldiers and officers from the criminal units who “atoned for their guilt in the struggle against the German aggressors” received a certificate of rehabilitation: http://rkka.ru/idocs.htm, see under: dokumenty/lichnye/Spravka ob iskuplenii viny. Beevor claims that the promise of forgiveness extended to punished soldiers was a fiction because those in the criminal units were allowed to bleed to death. The case he cites, of officers of the 51th Army who were accidentally sent to a penal battalion, makes clear, however, that the Main Political Administration monitored the situation. Beevor, Stalingrad, p. 85.\n\n181. On loss estimates, see John Erickson, “Soviet War Losses,” in Barbarossa: The Axis and the Allies, ed. J. Erickson and D.

Most of them were drafted before Order no. 227 was issued and sent to regular units. Beginning in October 1942, most gulag prisoners were sent to penal companies.

First, this addresses the confusion of this nationality with other Central Asian ethnic groups (Uzbeks and Turkmen) and, second, the questionable loyalty of Cossacks, especially the Don Cossacks, who supported the White Army in the Civil War. In World War II Cossacks fought in the Red Army as well as on the side of the Wehrmacht. For this reason, they were grouped into separate statistics by the NKVD.

Already in November 1941 General Zhukov ordered the commander and the commissar of a division that had shrunk from the Germans to be shot in front of their unit.

The latest publications by General Valentin Khristoforov, head of the Archives of the FSB, document many abusive practices within the wartime Red Army. The author comments on them with outrage. This is a notable departure from his earlier works, which celebrate the “Chekists” for their “patriotic” work. Khristoforov, “Voina trebuet vse novykh zhertv,” pp. 204–210; Khristoforov, Stalingrad. Organy NKVD nakanune i v dni srazheniia (Moscow, 2008).\n\n206. Krivosheev gives a precise number: 157,593 people; a similar number (“more than 157,000 death sentences”) is cited by Vladimir Naumov and Leonid Reshin and has been widely accepted by scholars as the number of executions actually carried out inside the Red Army. Vladimir Naumow and Leonid Reschin, “Repressionen gegen sowjetische Kriegsgefangene und zivile Repatrianten in der USSR 1941 bis 1956,” in Die Tragödie der Gefangenschaft in Deutschland und der Sowjetunion, 1941–1956, ed. Klaus-Dieter Müller et al. (Cologne, 1998), pp. 335–364, at p. 339; Merridale, Ivan’s War, p. 136. But Krivosheev adds that a special court order suspended more than 40 percent of all death sentences and had the convicts join penal units instead (Krivosheev, Rossiia i SSSR v voinakh XX veka, p. 302). Elsewhere in the same publication, Krivosheev writes of “135,000 executed soldiers” (ibid., p. 43). Of the death sentences, Naumov and Reschin believe that most were given in the early phase of the war and affected soldiers who had been temporarily encircled by the Germans or taken captive.\n\nIt remains unclear whether executions on the spot performed by commanders on the battlefield in response to soldierly infractions entered the statistics of the NKVD or not. Various authorities—military courts, SMERSH, and “Special commissions” (Osobye soveshchaniia)—were authorized to order executions, and the grand total may not be known to the present day. Military procuracy records and other hitherto classified documents will certainly shed more light on the matter.\n\n207. Stalingradskaia popeia, p. 380.\n\n208.

Twenty-eight soldiers were alleged to have destroyed eighteen enemy tanks in the defense of Moscow; all of the men were killed. Later investigations revealed that at least six of the Panfilov men had survived and one of them worked as an auxiliary police officer for the German occupiers as the war progressed. It was also found that a war correspondent for Red Star invented the number twenty-eight as well as some of the last words of these Soviet “heroes.” N. Petrov and O.

The Soviet secret service had bugged his apartment and recorded a conversation between Gordov, his wife, and his deputy, Major General Filipp Rybalchenko, in which Gordov held Stalin responsible for postwar economic and social problems in the Soviet Union. He also talked about a need for more democracy. Gordov and Rybalchenko were charged with treason and the “restoration of capitalism” and executed in 1950. They were rehabilitated in 1954, one year after Stalin’s death. R. G. Pikhoia, Sovetskii Soiuz: Istoriia vlasti. 1945–1991, 2nd rev. ed. (Novosibirsk, 2000), pp. 39–41.\n\n220. In the language of German military psychologists in World War II, Zaytsev would have been considered a “war trembler”; the western Allies spoke of shell shock. Paul Lerner, Hysterical Men: War, Psychiatry, and the Politics of Trauma in Germany, 1890–1930 (Ithaca, NY, 2003). The Soviet psychological discourse in World War II interpreted war injuries in a physiological manner. The treatment aimed to develop psychological resources such as the will and the moral consciousness. S.

Ever since the signing of the Anglo-Soviet alliance on May 22, 1942, Soviet officials vocally pushed Great Britain and the United States to open a “second front” in western Europe before year’s end, to ease the burden on the Red Army, which was practically fighting the Axis forces alone. This second front would not materialize until June 1944. See Allies at War: The Soviet, American, and British Experience, 1939–1945, ed. David Reynolds, Warren F. Kimball, A. O. Chubarian (New York, 1994).\n\n223. Stalingradskaia popeia, pp. 233–234, report of October 21, 1942. Soviet wartime diaries are a rare but interesting source because they show individual thoughts in evolution. Stepan Kalinin, commander of the Volga military district, kept a diary in which he harshly criticized leadership deficiencies and supply problems in the Red Army in 1941 and early 1942. When he heard of Order no. 227, he read it as a long overdue moral call to order and was relieved. (Kalinin was accused of conducting “anti-Soviet propaganda” and arrested in 1944.) Khristoforov, “Voina trebuet vse novykh zhertv,” pp. 178–190. In similar ways, Vasily Grossman used his diary to expose party and military officials who drank and partied instead of leading. He also criticized ordinary civilians who put their personal needs over those of society. All along he retained a moral, Soviet perspective on the war. See also the diaries mentioned in note 47, and the confiscated diary discussed in Stalingradskaia popeia, p. 207.\n\n224. Khristoforov, “Voina trebuet vse novykh zhertv,” p. 197.

The spirit was continued, however; it showed itself not only in the work of the Mints commission during the war, but also in the documentary project A Day in the World, which was first launched in 1935 and revisited twenty-five years later. M. Gor’kii and M. Kol’tsov, eds., Den’ mira (Moscow, 1937); Den’ mira: 27 sentiabria 1960 goda (Moscow, 1960).

In 1930, the commander of the Cossack Corps, Vitaly Primakov, married Liliya Brik, formerly the lover of the poet Vladimir Maiakovsky and a well-known muse of the artistic avant-garde. A few years later, Primakov was hit by the purges in the Red Army and confessed under torture to participating in an anti-Soviet fascist conspiracy. He was executed in June 1937. We learn nothing about these circumstances in the recently published diary of Isaak Mints, which excludes the years of Stalin’s terror and is generally patchy. I. I.

In the style of Istpart, the surviving members of the commission came together in 1984 for an evening of remembering the Great Patriotic War and reminisced about the founding and work of the now virtually forgotten commission. Naturally, a stenographer was present to transcribe the oral memories. “Vstrecha sotrudnikov Komissii po istorii Velikoi Otechestvennoi voiny AN SSSR,” Arkheograficheskii Ezhegodnik za 1984 g.

The letter to the Central Committee that Mints remembered writing in July 1941 could not be found in the archives. But there is evidence of other documentary projects pursued by other institutions at the same time. On July 15, 1941, the Soviet People’s Commissariat of Education called on all museum staff to collect materials on the Great Patriotic War. The call was followed by Order 170 of November 15, 1941, “On the Collection of Documents and Objects of the Great Patriotic War.” T.

Two large-scale interview projects launched in the United States and Great Britain during the 1930s suggest that the documentary impulse of the Mints commission may have been part of a larger cultural phenomenon: The Federal Writers Project in the United States, enacted by the Works Progress Administration in 1935, employed several thousand writers who collected information—much of it by way of oral histories—about American history, folklore, and everyday life. David A. Taylor, Soul of a People: The WPA Writers’ Project Uncovers Depression America(Hoboken, NJ, 2009). Britain saw the founding of Mass-Observation in 1937, a nongovernmental project that sought to gauge and activate the political pulse of ordinary Britons in response to the rise of fascism.

Molotov’s “outrageous note” was a “typical Jewish” attempt to blame Bolshevik atrocities against their own people on the Germans, Goebbels recorded on January 8, 1942. A day later, he noted that “when it comes to atrocities, the Bolsheviks have so much to answer for that their own atrocity reports can’t elicit a dog from behind the stove.” Die Tagebücher von Joseph Goebbels.

Her diary commented on the corrosive anti-Semitism and the bigotry of the occupiers who made disparaging comments about all things Russian and Soviet. When the Germans left Yasnaya Polyana after six weeks, they had turned the holy place for Shchegoleva into a stable, and human excrement covered the balconies of Tolstoy’s apartment building. Only by a hair did the museum workers succeed in extinguishing the fire started by the Germans during their retreat. The diary was serialized in Komsomol’skaia Pravda: December 18–24, 1941.

The Yermansky district was located in the city center.\n\n27. A kymograph is a device that produces graphical representations of physical processes (e.g., heartbeat, breathing, muscle contractions, etc.).\n\n28. This is a reference to the M-13, or BM-13, multiple rocket launcher built by the Soviet Union during World War II. Soviet soldiers affectionately called the rockets “Katyusha”; German troops referred to them as “Stalin’s organ” or “Joseph’s organ,” prompted by the resemblance of the launch array to a church organ and the sound of the rocket motors.

The Soviet government decreed the creation of destruction battalions on June 24, 1941. Formed on a volunteer basis and staffed by trusted Soviet activists, their task was to guard lines of communication and industrial objects against saboteurs and enemy agents. The battalions received military training and worked under the oversight of the NKVD or local party officials. Many units formally joined the Red Army over the course of the war. S. V.

A machine and tractor station (MTS) was a state enterprise for ownership and maintenance of agricultural machinery for use on collective farms. Agricultural equipment and technical personnel were scarce and thus shared by collective farms in a given region.\n\n31. Demchenko is alluding to the disintegration within the Red Army.\n\n32.

Spartakova, and P. Tkachenko, Pravda, January 7, 1940.\n\n35. German military sources mention nothing about this.\n\n36. Pigalyov in his interview mentions 57 aircraft.\n\n37. Viktor Stepanovich Kholsunov (1905–1939), a native of Tsaritsyn, commanded a squadron of the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War and was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union in 1937. He was killed in a flying accident. The monument in his honor was built in 1940. Restored after the war, it still stands at its original location in the city center. Stalingradskaia bitva. ntsiklopediia, p. 432.\n\n38. Settlements south of Stalingrad. On September 13, the German attack through Yelshanka to the Volga River split the 62nd Army from the 64th Army, which was stationed farther south. Samsonov, Stalingradskaia bitva, pp. 175–183.\n\n39. Pavlova writes that Chuyanov and his staff had left the city on the evening of September 13. Pavlova, Zasekrechennaia tragediia, p. 230.\n\n40. Probably an error. Major General Stepan Guryev commanded the 39th Motor Rifle Division. Major General Vasily Sokolov commanded the 45th (74th Guards) Rifle Division in the 62nd Army.\n\n41. Lavrentiy Beria (1899–1953) headed the Soviet security and secret police apparatus (NKVD) during World War II.\n\n42. On their retreat from Napoleon, Russian military commanders gathered in the village of Fili near Moscow in September 1812 and debated whether they should confront the invader or cede Moscow to him. Leo Tolstoy describes the gathering in War and Peace. Asserting that losing Moscow did not mean losing Russia, commander Mikhail Kutuzov decided to leave the capital to Napoleon. In regard to Stalingrad the Soviet regime argued conversely.\n\n43. Society for the Assistance to Defense, Aviation, and Chemical Construction: a popular volunteer organization in the Soviet Union that existed from 1927 to 1948. See also p. 30.\n\n44. The “Rally of the Victors” took place on February 4, 1943, on the Square of Fallen Heroes. In attendance were thousands of Red Army soldiers as well as party and city officials.\n\n45. Kotelnikovo: a village 190 kilometers southwest of Volgograd. Kotelnikovo was captured by the Wehrmacht on August 2, 1942. It was from here that General Hoth’s panzer group sought to break through to the encircled German troops at Stalingrad in December 1942. Hoth’s attempt failed, and Soviet forces took Kotelnikovo on December 29, 1942.\n\n46. In the first weeks after the liberation of the city, the NKVD arrested 502 “traitors, agents, and accomplices” of the Germans, including 46 agents, 45 espionage suspects, 68 police employees, and 172 individuals who had voluntarily assisted the German armed forces (Stalingradskaia popeia, pp. 406–407). In the surrounding villages, 732 arrests had been made by July 1, 1943. Pavlova believes that many more collaborators were not punished by the Soviet authorities. Pavlova, Zasekrechennaia tragediia, pp. 412, 547.\n\n47. These numbers are given, respectively, by Gerlach, Militärische “Versorgungszwänge,” Besatzungspolitik und Massenverbrechen, p. 199; and Pavlova, Zasekrechennaia tragediia, p. 460.\n\n48.

Ibid., p. 461; Pravda and Izvestiia from October 17, 1942, citing German attacks in the area of the Barricades munitions plant on October 4, 1942.\n\n51. The Germans, Speidel claimed under further interrogation, also tried “at all costs to get the Cossacks on their side” (Pavlova, Zasekrechennaia tragediia, pp. 307, 468). While Stalingrad itself was largely populated by Russians, many Cossacks lived in the villages and on the farms in the area. German occupation officials emphasized the “consanguinity” of the Cossacks to the Aryan peoples and styled Pyotr Krasnov—the commander who had directed the attack against Red Tsaritsyn in 1918 and who was living in German exile—as a liberator of the Cossacks from the Bolshevik yoke. In the summer of 1942 this propaganda fell on open ears. Later, the picture changed when the Germans failed to abolish the collective farms, as they had promised they would, and when the villagers witnessed the mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war. The Soviet leadership had evacuated able-bodied men from the Cossack settlements in the Volga-Don region to prevent a possible collaboration between Cossacks and Germans. That was one of the few instances of the timely evacuation of the civilian population. Pavlova, Zasekrechennaia tragediia, pp. 321–331, 359; R. Krikunov, Kazaki.\n\n52. Stalingradskaia popeia, p. 396.\n\n53. Pavlova, Zasekrechennaia tragediia, pp. 316–319, 363–364.\n\n54. Communists could survive if they were willing to denounce fellow party members. Speidel probably died in late 1943 in the Beketovka prison. Pavlova, Zasekrechennaia tragediia, pp. 314, 467, 469, 478–479.\n\n55. Pavlova, Zasekrechennaia tragediia, pp. 304–305; Gert C. Lübbers, “Die 6. Armee und die Zivilbevölkerung von Stalingrad,” Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte 54 (2006), no. 1: 115.\n\n56. Gert Lübbers refutes Christian Gerlach’s claim that the evacuation ordered by the quartermaster general of the army was aimed to extinguish Stalingrad’s civilian population. But his attempt to humanize the policies of the military government seems anachronistic: the sources Lübbers cites speak in a language of bureaucratic calculus. Relying on Russian archival sources, Tatiana Pavlova describes in detail the inhumane conditions of the evacuation.

It fell to the Germans after heavy fighting on September 22, 1942, and was recaptured on January 25, 1943. Made from concrete, the elevator is one of few surviving prewar buildings in Volgograd today. Stalingradskaia bitva. ntsiklopediia, p. 456.\n\n64.

Major Pyotr Mikhailovich Fedosov (1897–1974) was a battalion commissar during the Great Patriotic War. He served on the Historical Commission since its creation in December 1941. Fedosov’s daughter, herself a former staff member of the Institute of History of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has researched his wartime work for the commission: E. P.

Leonty Nikolayevich Gurtyev (1891–1943) was appointed major general on December 7, 1942. He died on August 3, 1943, during the fighting for Oryol and was posthumously awarded a Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\n81. The State Fishing Trust.\n\n82. The Russian Red Cross Society was established in 1854. In 1923 it was renamed the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the USSR (the Soviet Red Cross). Its activities included teaching first aid skills to the general population and providing medical training to nurses.\n\n83. Nina Kokorina ended the war in Berlin.

From 1917 to 1932, the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy was the central authority for managing industry. It was dissolved in 1932, and its functions were transferred to branches of the People’s Commissariat.\n\n86. Kumylga—a railway station on the Uryupinsk–Volgograd line.\n\n87. Samofalovka—a village near Kotluban.\n\n88. From these heights Tsaritsyn was defended in the summer and autumn of 1918.\n\n89. Arnold Meri (1919–2009) was an Estonian soldier who volunteered to serve in the Red Army after the Soviet invasion of Estonia. In July 1941 he was wounded in the defense of Pskov and awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union. From 1945 to 1949 he chaired the Estonian Komsomol organization. In 2003 the Estonian prosecutor indicted Meri for genocide. He was accused of deporting 251 Estonian civilians to Siberia after the war. Meri denied the allegations. Russian president Medvedev awarded him the Medal of Honor posthumously in 2009.\n\n90. In all likelihood, Ilya Nikolayevich Kuzin (1919–1960) was the leader of a group of demolitionists in a Volokolamsk partisan detachment that spent six months behind enemy lines near Moscow. Kuzin personally conducted about 150 acts of sabotage. He was declared a Hero of the Soviet Union on February 16, 1942.\n\n91. Zoya Anatolyevna Kosmodemyanskaya (1923–1941) was a Komsomol from Moscow who voluntarily joined the guerrilla movement after the outbreak of war. Their task was to burn down German accommodations behind the front lines. Kosmodemyanskaya was discovered by a Russian guard and handed over to the Germans. She was tortured and then hanged publicly. Petrischchevo, the village where she died, was liberated on January 22, 1942. The journalist Pyotr Lidov reported the partisan’s story a few days later in Pravda, and the article became famous. Kosmodemyanskaya was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union on February 16, 1942.\n\n92. Weapons are camouflaged behind the defense line. Two to three guns with armor-piercing munitions wait until the enemy completes his assault only to experience massive fire from two sides. The fire starts a counterattack by troops emerging from the trenches. See “Kinzhal’nyi ogon’,” Bol’shaia sovetskaia ntsiklopediiantsiklopediia, 2nd ed. (Moscow, 1953), 21:11.\n\n93. Spartak was a popular Soviet sports society of industrial cooperatives (established in 1935).\n\n94. For more on Nikolai Kosykh, see Sibiriaki na zashchite Stalingrada (Novosibirsk, 1943).\n\n95. On September 18, 1942, Commissar Petrakov wrote his daughter a letter: “My black-eyed Mila! With this letter I am sending you a cornflower [ . . . ] Imagine: here the battle rages, enemy projectiles explode, everything is destroyed and yet here grows a flower [ . . . ] And then the next explosion, and it has torn the cornflower. I have removed the flower and put it in my shirt pocket. The flower grew and wanted the sun, but the force of the explosion has destroyed the flowers, and if I had not picked them up, they would have been trampled. Just what the fascists do with the children in the occupied villages around; they kill and crush the children [ . . . ] Mila! Your Papa Dima will fight to the last drop of blood against the fascists, to the last breath, so the fascists will not treat you like this flower. What you do not understand, your mom will explain.” The letter was first published in 1957 in Rabotnitsa. That same year saw the inauguration of the Soldiers Field memorial west of Volgograd. Among the mass graves stands a bronze statue of a girl holding a cornflower in her hands. At her feet is a triangular stone in the shape of a Red Army letter. On it are carved Commissar Petrakov’s words to his daughter. Stalingradskaia bitva. ntsiklopediia, p. 355.\n\n96. Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov (1901–1988), one of Stalin’s closest aides, was a member of the State Defense Committee during the war. In this capacity Malenkov traveled to Stalingrad in August 1942 to inspect the city’s defenses.\n\n97. Kirill Semenovich Moskalenko (1902–1985). Commander of the 1st Guards Army.\n\n98. Boris Petrovich Shonin (1918–1942), assistant chief of staff of the 339th Rifle Regiment of the 308th Rifle Division, recipient of the Red Star and the Lenin orders. Shonin’s deeds were documented by Captain Ingor, the interviewee: M. Ingor, Sibiriaki: Stalingradtsy (Moscow, 1950), pp. 22–26.\n\n99. Vasily Anufriyevich Zhigalin (1910–1942). Senior lieutenant, assistant to the regimental chief of staff. Fell on October 27, 1942, in Stalingrad (details at www.obd-memorial.ru).\n\n100. Semyon Grigoryevich Fugenfirov (1917–1942). Assistant to the regimental chief of staff. Died of his wounds on October 29, 1942, in Stalingrad (details at www.obd-memorial.ru).\n\n101. A reference to an open letter to Stalin sent by hundreds of Red Army soldiers fighting at Stalingrad on the eve of the revolutionary holiday in November 1942. The soldiers swore to defend Stalingrad to the last drop of their blood. The letter was published in Pravda, November 6, 1942, p. 1.\n\n102. Probably Prokhor Vasilievich Kayukov (1914–1942), who died in Stalingrad in October 1942, according to www.obd-memorial.ru.\n\n103. Captain Ingor writes that before the war Zoya Rokovanova taught Russian literature at a school. At the front she hosted readings under the motto “Life Is Magnificent!” The readings featured the life of revolutionary writer Nikolai Chernyshevsky (1828–1889), whose writings supplied the motto. Rokovanova had books shipped from Omsk to prepare for the readings. After the readings, she distributed written summaries among the soldiers. M. Ingor, Sibiriaki—gurt’evtsy—gvardeitsy (Omsk, 194?), pp. 44–46. The publication date on the volume, 1941, is a misprint.\n\n104. That is, German aircraft, probably a Focke-Wulf fighter bomber.\n\n105. The “Call by the participants in the defense of Tsaritsyn to the defenders of Stalingrad” was published in the army newspaper For Our Victory. Za nashu pobedu, October 2, 1942.\n\n106. The book was published in 1943 under the title Sibiriaki na zashchite Stalingrada (OGIZ, 1943). It included the stories: A. Svirin, “Sibiriaki v boiakh za Stalingrad”; V. Grossman, “Napravlenie glavnogo udara”; V. Belov, “Bogatyri Sibiri”; M. Ingor, “Leitenant Boris Shonin”; M. Ingor, “Artillerist Vasily Boltenko”; V. Belov, “Vasily Kalinin,” and others.\n\n107. Grossman, Gody voiny, pp. 388–399.\n\n108. Krasnaia zvezda, November 25, 1942, p. 3. Grossman talked with the soldiers of the 308th Rifle Division before the beginning of the November 19, 1942, counteroffensive. In later editions the essay was slightly altered to foreshadow the Soviet victory. Grossman, Gody voiny, pp. 49–61.\n\n109. Grossman, Gody voiny, p. 365.\n\n110. Most of the interviews were conducted on the ships of the Volga flotilla, which were scattered after the battle of Stalingrad: to conduct the interviews, the historians had to travel to Kuibyshev (now Samara), Saratov, Sarepta (near Stalingrad), and Chorny Yar (near Astrakhan).\n\n111. The division was refurbished after it lost 80 percent of its personnel fighting in eastern Ukraine in summer 1942. Isaac Kobylyansky, “Memories of War, Part 2,” Journal of Slavic Military Studies, December 2003,:147. In April 1943, the division was renamed 87th Guards Rifle Division.\n\n112. Stalingrad 1942–1943.

A recent Russian publication identifies the losses of the landing operation but also points out that the Soviet battalion “had destroyed 10 to 15 enemy tanks and up to an infantry battalion of the enemy.” In addition, it notes that the action successfully concealed Soviet preparations for Operation Uranus. (Stalingradskaia bitva, pp. 224–225). That, however, had not been the stated goal of the landing maneuver.\n\n125. Isaak Kobylianskii, Priamoi navodkoi po vragu (Moscow, 2005), chap. 5.\n\n126. NA IRI RAN, f. 2, razd. I, op. 80, d. 3, 7–8, 12, 16, 28, 32, 80. Those interviews that bear dates were recorded between July 18 and 28, 1943. The Interviewers were Vasily A. Divin, Filipp St. Krinitsyn, and Nikolai P. Mazunin, and the stenographers Ye. S. Dassayeva and V. Shinder. The latter, the record notes, was a sailor of the Red Fleet.\n\n127. Colonel (and as of December 1942, Major General) Sergey Fyodorovich Gorokhov (1901–1974) commanded the 124th Independent Rifle Brigade and the Northern group of the 62nd Army.\n\n128. Shadrinsky Bay is on the eastern bank of the Volga, opposite the settlement, located on the river’s western bank.\n\n129. Today the village is located near the Volga cargo port.\n\n130. Sredne-Pogromnoye is a village on the left bank of the Akhtuba.\n\n131. At another point in the interview, Zaginaylo said about him, “Fyodorov is an amazingly quiet commander; he does not shout, is not nervous, but explains the order clearly.”\n\n132. Oleynik possibly confused Kazakhs and Bashkirs. Before the landing maneuver the division was resupplied in Bashkiria, probably with local recruits.\n\n133. Nikolai Nikitich Zhuravkov (1916–1998).\n\n134. This refers to the six-tube 15cm Nebelwerfer 41, which Soviet soldiers called Vanyusha, in contrast to their Katyusha.\n\n135. Anton Grigoryevich Lemeshko. Lieutenant of the Guards, Commissar of the Northern Group of the Volga Flotilla.\n\n136. Probably Ivan Mikhailovich Pyoryshkin.\n\n137. The brigade fought since September 1942 at Stalingrad, first as part of the 64th Army, later in the 62nd, 57th, and 51st Armies before being restored to the 64th Army in January 1943. See Burmakov, interview; Stalingradskaia bitva. ntsiklopediia, p. 401.\n\n138. Friedrich Roske (1897–1956). Previously regimental commander in the 71st Infantry Division. Succeeded General Alexander von Hartmann as divisional commander on January 26, 1943, after his death. According to several witnesses, Hartmann had sought a “hero’s death”: he walked up to the battle line, standing tall, and was shot in the head.

Until 1913, the share of aristocratic officers in the Imperial Army stood at 30 percent. In 1918, 21.7 percent of generals were aristocrats. After the Nazis took power, the percentage declined again. In 1944, 19 percent of all generals were of noble origin. Bartov, Hitler’s Army, p. 43.\n\n144. The scene in Beketovka was captured in the documentary film Stalingrad (dir. Leonid Varlamov, 1943). The speaker dubbed the German commander correctly as “Friedrich Paulus.” Yet in his 1972 memoir Leonid Vinokur repeated the title “Von Paulus.” L. Vinokur, “Plenenie fel’dmarshala Paulyusa,” Raduga: Organ Pravleniia Soiuza pisatelei Ukrainy 1972, no. 2: 145–148.\n\n145. Army General Shumilov came from a poor peasant family, as did Captains Ivan Morozov and Lukyan Bukharov. Both negotiated with Generals Schmidt and Roske in the department store basement. See interviews with Shumilov, Morozov, and Bukharov.\n\n146. Fritz Roske, “Stalingrad,” manuscript, 1956. From the private archive of Bodo Roske, Krefeld. Presented in abbreviated form in Die 71. Infanterie-Division im Zweiten Weltkrieg 1939–1945, ed. Arbeitsgemeinschaft “Das Kleeblatt” (Hildesheim, 1973), pp. 299–300.\n\n147. Cited from the television documentary Stalingrad: Eine Trilogie (2003). The commandant of Stalingrad reported that a group of Germans was seized in a shelter on March 11, 1943 (Demchenko, interview).\n\n148. On the role of European volunteers who joined the Wehrmacht, see Hans Werner Neulen, An deutscher Seite: Internationale Freiwillige von Wehrmacht und Waffen-SS (Munich, 1985); Müller, An der Seite der Wehrmacht.\n\n149. Burmakov was a colonel during the battle and was only promoted to major general on March 1, 1943.\n\n150. NA IRI RAN, f. 2, razd. III, op. 5, d. 11, 14–15.\n\n151. A reference to Operation Ring, which was initiated on January 10, 1943. See pp. 11–12.\n\n152. Duka wanted to say, “Hand over your weapons!” (“Geben Sie Ihre Waffen!”), but he mistakenly said: “Hand the guards!”\n\n153. This is confirmed by Kehrig in Stalingrad, pp. 542–543.\n\n154. Red Square was adjacent to the Square of Fallen Heroes. Several German wartime maps show only Red Square in the city center, omitting the larger Square of Fallen Heroes. Red Square was abolished in the course of the postwar reconstruction of Stalingrad.\n\n155. This could have been Boris V. Neihardt, translator with the 51st Army Corps. In view of a possible surrender to the Soviets, Neihardt was ordered to serve Paulus and the Army Command on January 22, 1943. Kehrig, Stalingrad, p. 539.\n\n156. Ivan Andreyevich Laskin (1901–1988) was the 64th Army’s chief of staff between September 1942 and March 1943. In 1941, Laskin had commanded a rifle division at the Southwestern front and successfully broken through a German encirclement. In December 1943, the NKVD learned that the Germans had in fact captured and interrogated Laskin, before he managed to escape again. (After his escape he had remained silent about this fact.) The major general, who had received Soviet and American decorations for his role in the capture of Field Marshal Paulus, was arrested, accused of treason and espionage, and—after prolonged interrogations that stretched over years—sentenced to a fifteen-year prison term. The basis for this harsh treatment was Stalin’s Order no. 270 of August 1941. Laskin was freed as part of an amnesty in 1952 and rehabilitated in 1953. Naumow and Reschin, “Repressionen gegen sowjetische Kriegsgefangene und zivile Repatrianten in der USSR 1941 bis 1956,” p. 339.\n\n157. In his 1972 memoir Vinokur describes his arrival at the department store consistent with the facts described here, but he gives a different slant to the encounter with the hundreds of armed German soldiers in the courtyard of the store: “The Germans huddled in a corner together talking to each other. You could only understand single word fragments: “Kamrad, Kamrad, Hitler kaput! Paulus kaput, kaput.” Our officers and soldiers were talking boldly, courageously, with dignity. It seemed as if the capture of fascist generals was an everyday thing” (L. Vinokur, “Plenenie fel’dmarshala Pauliusa,” p. 146). Vinokur’s 1943 interview conveys how threatened he felt surrounded by armed Germans. The memoir hides this feeling and gives an anachronistic image of the defeated Germans trying to ingratiate their superior Soviet opponents.\n\n158. Paulus was in a different room. Gurov confuses the exceedingly tall field marshal with Roske, who was shorter: “Roske was tall and thin. Paulus was shorter, but had a fuller build.”\n\n159. In the final part of the interview Vinokur again refers to the scene: “I was speaking through the interpreter. I went into Roske’s room. I said: [sic]. He said the same thing. He liked that. He asked if I would sit down.” It would be nice to know what word or words Vinokur used when he greeted the German officer. The stenographer did not say, perhaps wisely?\n\n160. Emka: Soviet M-1 limousine, colloquially referred to as “M-type.”\n\n161. During the Seven Years War, Russian and Austrian troops occupied Berlin for a few days in October 1760.\n\n162. Probably Shumilov was asked if he had asked Paulus why he had not committed suicide.\n\n163. To establish a spatial and moral “new order” in Europe and the world was the explicit goal of the Axis powers: Germany, Italy, and Japan. Mark Mazower, Dark Continent: Europe’s Twentieth Century (London, 1998), pp. 143–146.\n\n164. The reference is probably to Major Demchenko, the city commandant of Stalingrad.
