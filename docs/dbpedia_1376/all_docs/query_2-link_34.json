The mandate of the FATF is to set standards and to promote\n\neffective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money\n\nlaundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation, and other related threats to the\n\nintegrity of the international financial system. In collaboration with other international\n\nstakeholders, the FATF also works to identify national-level vulnerabilities with the aim of\n\nprotecting the international financial system from misuse.\n\nThe FATF Recommendations set out a comprehensive and consistent framework of measures which\n\ncountries should implement in order to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as\n\nthe financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Countries have diverse legal,\n\nadministrative and operational frameworks and different financial systems, and so cannot all take\n\nidentical measures to counter these threats. The FATF Recommendations, therefore, set an\n\ninternational standard, which countries should implement through measures adapted to their\n\nparticular circumstances. The FATF Recommendations set out the essential measures that countries\n\nshould have in place to:\n\n􀂄 identify the risks, and develop policies and domestic coordination;\n\n􀂄 pursue money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of\n\nproliferation;\n\n􀂄 apply preventive measures for the financial sector and other designated\n\nsectors;\n\n􀂄 establish powers and responsibilities for the competent authorities (e.g.,\n\ninvestigative, law enforcement and supervisory authorities) and other\n\ninstitutional measures;\n\n􀂄 enhance the transparency and availability of beneficial ownership\n\ninformation of legal persons and arrangements; and\n\n􀂄 facilitate international cooperation.\n\nThe original FATF Forty Recommendations were drawn up in 1990 as an initiative to combat the\n\nmisuse of financial systems by persons laundering drug money. In 1996 the Recommendations\n\nwere revised for the first time to reflect evolving money laundering trends and techniques, and to\n\nbroaden their scope well beyond drug-money laundering. In October 2001 the FATF expanded its\n\nmandate to deal with the issue of the funding of terrorist acts and terrorist organisations, and took\n\nthe important step of creating the Eight (later expanded to Nine) Special Recommendations on\n\nTerrorist Financing. The FATF Recommendations were revised a second time in 2003, and these,\n\ntogether with the Special Recommendations, have been endorsed by over 180 countries, and are\n\nuniversally recognised as the international standard for anti-money laundering and countering the\n\nfinancing of terrorism (AML/CFT).\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 7\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the third round of mutual evaluations of its members, the FATF has\n\nreviewed and updated the FATF Recommendations, in close co-operation with the FATF-Style\n\nRegional Bodies (FSRBs) and the observer organisations, including the International Monetary\n\nFund, the World Bank and the United Nations. The revisions address new and emerging threats,\n\nclarify and strengthen many of the existing obligations, while maintaining the necessary stability\n\nand rigour in the Recommendations.\n\nThe FATF Standards have also been revised to strengthen the requirements for higher risk\n\nsituations, and to allow countries to take a more focused approach in areas where high risks remain\n\nor implementation could be enhanced. Countries should first identify, assess and understand the\n\nrisks of money laundering and terrorist finance that they face, and then adopt appropriate measures\n\nto mitigate the risk. The risk-based approach allows countries, within the framework of the FATF\n\nrequirements, to adopt a more flexible set of measures, in order to target their resources more\n\neffectively and apply preventive measures that are commensurate to the nature of risks, in order to\n\nfocus their efforts in the most effective way.\n\nCombating terrorist financing is a very significant challenge. An effective AML/CFT system, in\n\ngeneral, is important for addressing terrorist financing, and most measures previously focused on\n\nterrorist financing are now integrated throughout the Recommendations, therefore obviating the\n\nneed for the Special Recommendations. However, there are some Recommendations that are unique\n\nto terrorist financing, which are set out in Section C of the FATF Recommendations. These are:\n\nRecommendation 5 (the criminalisation of terrorist financing); Recommendation 6 (targeted\n\nfinancial sanctions related to terrorism & terrorist financing); and Recommendation 8 (measures to\n\nprevent the misuse of non-profit organisations). The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is\n\nalso a significant security concern, and in 2008 the FATF’s mandate was expanded to include dealing\n\nwith the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. To combat this threat, the FATF\n\nhas adopted a new Recommendation (Recommendation 7) aimed at ensuring consistent and\n\neffective implementation of targeted financial sanctions when these are called for by the UN\n\nSecurity Council.\n\nThe FATF Standards comprise the Recommendations themselves and their Interpretive Notes,\n\ntogether with the applicable definitions in the Glossary. The measures set out in the FATF Standards\n\nshould be implemented by all members of the FATF and the FSRBs, and their implementation is\n\nassessed rigorously through Mutual Evaluation processes, and through the assessment processes of\n\nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – on the basis of the FATF’s common\n\nassessment methodology. Some Interpretive Notes and definitions in the glossary include examples\n\nwhich illustrate how the requirements could be applied. These examples are not mandatory\n\nelements of the FATF Standards, and are included for guidance only. The examples are not intended\n\nto be comprehensive, and although they are considered to be helpful indicators, they may not be\n\nrelevant in all circumstances.\n\nThe FATF also produces Guidance, Best Practice Papers, and other advice to assist countries with\n\nthe implementation of the FATF standards. These other documents are not mandatory for assessing\n\ncompliance with the Standards, but countries may find it valuable to have regard to them when\n\nconsidering how best to implement the FATF Standards.

The revision of the Recommendations has involved extensive consultation, and\n\nhas benefited from comments and suggestions from these stakeholders. Going forward and in\n\naccordance with its mandate, the FATF will continue to consider changes to the standards, as\n\nappropriate, in light of new information regarding emerging threats and vulnerabilities to the global\n\nfinancial system.\n\nThe FATF calls upon all countries to implement effective measures to bring their national systems\n\nfor combating money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation into\n\ncompliance with the revised FATF Recommendations.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 9\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nA. AML/CFT POLICIES AND COORDINATION\n\n1. Assessing risks and applying a risk-based approach *\n\nCountries should identify, assess, and understand the money laundering and terrorist\n\nfinancing risks for the country, and should take action, including designating an authority or\n\nmechanism to coordinate actions to assess risks, and apply resources, aimed at ensuring the\n\nrisks are mitigated effectively. Based on that assessment, countries should apply a risk-based\n\napproach (RBA) to ensure that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and\n\nterrorist financing are commensurate with the risks identified. This approach should be an\n\nessential foundation to efficient allocation of resources across the anti-money laundering and\n\ncountering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime and the implementation of riskbased\n\nmeasures throughout the FATF Recommendations. Where countries identify higher\n\nrisks, they should ensure that their AML/CFT regime adequately addresses such risks. Where\n\ncountries identify lower risks, they may decide to allow simplified measures for some of the\n\nFATF Recommendations under certain conditions.\n\nCountries should require financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and\n\nprofessions (DNFBPs) to identify, assess and take effective action to mitigate their money\n\nlaundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\n2. National cooperation and coordination\n\nCountries should have national AML/CFT policies, informed by the risks identified, which\n\nshould be regularly reviewed, and should designate an authority or have a coordination or\n\nother mechanisms that is responsible for such policies.\n\nCountries should ensure that policy-makers, the financial intelligence unit (FIU), law\n\nenforcement authorities, supervisors and other relevant competent authorities, at the policymaking\n\nand operational levels, have effective mechanisms in place which enable them to\n\ncooperate, and, where appropriate, coordinate and exchange information domestically with\n\neach other concerning the development and implementation of policies and activities to\n\ncombat money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation of weapons of\n\nmass destruction. This should include cooperation and coordination between relevant\n\nauthorities to ensure the compatibility of AML/CFT requirements with Data Protection and\n\nPrivacy rules and other similar provisions (e.g. data security/localisation).\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n10 􀂤 2012-2018\n\nB. MONEY LAUNDERING AND CONFISCATION\n\n3. Money laundering offence *\n\nCountries should criminalise money laundering on the basis of the Vienna Convention and the\n\nPalermo Convention. Countries should apply the crime of money laundering to all serious\n\noffences, with a view to including the widest range of predicate offences.\n\n4. Confiscation and provisional measures *\n\nCountries should adopt measures similar to those set forth in the Vienna Convention, the\n\nPalermo Convention, and the Terrorist Financing Convention, including legislative measures,\n\nto enable their competent authorities to freeze or seize and confiscate the following, without\n\nprejudicing the rights of bona fide third parties: (a) property laundered, (b) proceeds from, or\n\ninstrumentalities used in or intended for use in money laundering or predicate offences, (c)\n\nproperty that is the proceeds of, or used in, or intended or allocated for use in, the financing of\n\nterrorism, terrorist acts or terrorist organisations, or (d) property of corresponding value.\n\nSuch measures should include the authority to: (a) identify, trace and evaluate property that is\n\nsubject to confiscation; (b) carry out provisional measures, such as freezing and seizing, to\n\nprevent any dealing, transfer or disposal of such property; (c) take steps that will prevent or\n\nvoid actions that prejudice the country’s ability to freeze or seize or recover property that is\n\nsubject to confiscation; and (d) take any appropriate investigative measures.\n\nCountries should consider adopting measures that allow such proceeds or instrumentalities to\n\nbe confiscated without requiring a criminal conviction (non-conviction based confiscation), or\n\nwhich require an offender to demonstrate the lawful origin of the property alleged to be liable\n\nto confiscation, to the extent that such a requirement is consistent with the principles of their\n\ndomestic law.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 11\n\nC. TERRORIST FINANCING AND FINANCING OF PROLIFERATION\n\n5. Terrorist financing offence *\n\nCountries should criminalise terrorist financing on the basis of the Terrorist Financing\n\nConvention, and should criminalise not only the financing of terrorist acts but also the\n\nfinancing of terrorist organisations and individual terrorists even in the absence of a link to a\n\nspecific terrorist act or acts. Countries should ensure that such offences are designated as\n\nmoney laundering predicate offences.\n\n6. Targeted financial sanctions related to terrorism and terrorist financing *\n\nCountries should implement targeted financial sanctions regimes to comply with United\n\nNations Security Council resolutions relating to the prevention and suppression of terrorism\n\nand terrorist financing. The resolutions require countries to freeze without delay the funds or\n\nother assets of, and to ensure that no funds or other assets are made available, directly or\n\nindirectly, to or for the benefit of, any person or entity either (i) designated by, or under the\n\nauthority of, the United Nations Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter of the\n\nUnited Nations, including in accordance with resolution 1267 (1999) and its successor\n\nresolutions; or (ii) designated by that country pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001).\n\n7. Targeted financial sanctions related to proliferation *\n\nCountries should implement targeted financial sanctions to comply with United Nations\n\nSecurity Council resolutions relating to the prevention, suppression and disruption of\n\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and its financing. These resolutions require\n\ncountries to freeze without delay the funds or other assets of, and to ensure that no funds and\n\nother assets are made available, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of, any person or\n\nentity designated by, or under the authority of, the United Nations Security Council under\n\nChapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.\n\n8. Non-profit organisations *\n\nCountries should review the adequacy of laws and regulations that relate to non-profit\n\norganisations which the country has identified as being vulnerable to terrorist financing\n\nabuse. Countries should apply focused and proportionate measures, in line with the riskbased\n\napproach, to such non-profit organisations to protect them from terrorist financing\n\nabuse, including:\n\n(a) by terrorist organisations posing as legitimate entities;\n\n(b) by exploiting legitimate entities as conduits for terrorist financing, including for the\n\npurpose of escaping asset-freezing measures; and\n\n(c) by concealing or obscuring the clandestine diversion of funds intended for legitimate\n\npurposes to terrorist organisations.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n12 􀂤 2012-2018\n\nD. PREVENTIVE MEASURES\n\n9. Financial institution secrecy laws\n\nCountries should ensure that financial institution secrecy laws do not inhibit implementation\n\nof the FATF Recommendations.\n\nCUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE AND RECORD-KEEPING\n\n10. Customer due diligence *\n\nFinancial institutions should be prohibited from keeping anonymous accounts or accounts in\n\nobviously fictitious names.\n\nFinancial institutions should be required to undertake customer due diligence (CDD)\n\nmeasures when:\n\n(i) establishing business relations;\n\n(ii) carrying out occasional transactions: (i) above the applicable designated threshold\n\n(USD/EUR 15,000); or (ii) that are wire transfers in the circumstances covered by the\n\nInterpretive Note to Recommendation 16;\n\n(iii) there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing; or\n\n(iv) the financial institution has doubts about the veracity or adequacy of previously\n\nobtained customer identification data.\n\nThe principle that financial institutions should conduct CDD should be set out in law. Each\n\ncountry may determine how it imposes specific CDD obligations, either through law or\n\nenforceable means.\n\nThe CDD measures to be taken are as follows:\n\n(a) Identifying the customer and verifying that customer’s identity using reliable,\n\nindependent source documents, data or information.\n\n(b) Identifying the beneficial owner, and taking reasonable measures to verify the identity\n\nof the beneficial owner, such that the financial institution is satisfied that it knows who\n\nthe beneficial owner is. For legal persons and arrangements this should include\n\nfinancial institutions understanding the ownership and control structure of the\n\ncustomer.\n\n(c) Understanding and, as appropriate, obtaining information on the purpose and\n\nintended nature of the business relationship.\n\n(d) Conducting ongoing due diligence on the business relationship and scrutiny of\n\ntransactions undertaken throughout the course of that relationship to ensure that the\n\ntransactions being conducted are consistent with the institution’s knowledge of the\n\ncustomer, their business and risk profile, including, where necessary, the source of\n\nfunds.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 13\n\nFinancial institutions should be required to apply each of the CDD measures under (a) to (d)\n\nabove, but should determine the extent of such measures using a risk-based approach (RBA)\n\nin accordance with the Interpretive Notes to this Recommendation and to Recommendation 1.\n\nFinancial institutions should be required to verify the identity of the customer and beneficial\n\nowner before or during the course of establishing a business relationship or conducting\n\ntransactions for occasional customers. Countries may permit financial institutions to complete\n\nthe verification as soon as reasonably practicable following the establishment of the\n\nrelationship, where the money laundering and terrorist financing risks are effectively\n\nmanaged and where this is essential not to interrupt the normal conduct of business.\n\nWhere the financial institution is unable to comply with the applicable requirements under\n\nparagraphs (a) to (d) above (subject to appropriate modification of the extent of the measures\n\non a risk-based approach), it should be required not to open the account, commence business\n\nrelations or perform the transaction; or should be required to terminate the business\n\nrelationship; and should consider making a suspicious transactions report in relation to the\n\ncustomer.\n\nThese requirements should apply to all new customers, although financial institutions should\n\nalso apply this Recommendation to existing customers on the basis of materiality and risk,\n\nand should conduct due diligence on such existing relationships at appropriate times.\n\n11. Record-keeping\n\nFinancial institutions should be required to maintain, for at least five years, all necessary\n\nrecords on transactions, both domestic and international, to enable them to comply swiftly\n\nwith information requests from the competent authorities. Such records must be sufficient to\n\npermit reconstruction of individual transactions (including the amounts and types of currency\n\ninvolved, if any) so as to provide, if necessary, evidence for prosecution of criminal activity.\n\nFinancial institutions should be required to keep all records obtained through CDD measures\n\n(e.g. copies or records of official identification documents like passports, identity cards,\n\ndriving licences or similar documents), account files and business correspondence, including\n\nthe results of any analysis undertaken (e.g. inquiries to establish the background and purpose\n\nof complex, unusual large transactions), for at least five years after the business relationship is\n\nended, or after the date of the occasional transaction.\n\nFinancial institutions should be required by law to maintain records on transactions and\n\ninformation obtained through the CDD measures.\n\nThe CDD information and the transaction records should be available to domestic competent\n\nauthorities upon appropriate authority.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n14 􀂤 2012-2018\n\nADDITIONAL MEASURES FOR SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND ACTIVITIES\n\n12. Politically exposed persons *\n\nFinancial institutions should be required, in relation to foreign politically exposed persons\n\n(PEPs) (whether as customer or beneficial owner), in addition to performing normal customer\n\ndue diligence measures, to:\n\n(a) have appropriate risk-management systems to determine whether the customer or the\n\nbeneficial owner is a politically exposed person;\n\n(b) obtain senior management approval for establishing (or continuing, for existing\n\ncustomers) such business relationships;\n\n(c) take reasonable measures to establish the source of wealth and source of funds; and\n\n(d) conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring of the business relationship.\n\nFinancial institutions should be required to take reasonable measures to determine whether a\n\ncustomer or beneficial owner is a domestic PEP or a person who is or has been entrusted with\n\na prominent function by an international organisation. In cases of a higher risk business\n\nrelationship with such persons, financial institutions should be required to apply the\n\nmeasures referred to in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d).\n\nThe requirements for all types of PEP should also apply to family members or close associates\n\nof such PEPs.\n\n13. Correspondent banking *\n\nFinancial institutions should be required, in relation to cross-border correspondent banking\n\nand other similar relationships, in addition to performing normal customer due diligence\n\nmeasures, to:\n\n(a) gather sufficient information about a respondent institution to understand fully the\n\nnature of the respondent’s business and to determine from publicly available\n\ninformation the reputation of the institution and the quality of supervision, including\n\nwhether it has been subject to a money laundering or terrorist financing investigation\n\nor regulatory action;\n\n(b) assess the respondent institution’s AML/CFT controls;\n\n(c) obtain approval from senior management before establishing new correspondent\n\nrelationships;\n\n(d) clearly understand the respective responsibilities of each institution; and\n\n(e) with respect to “payable-through accounts”, be satisfied that the respondent bank has\n\nconducted CDD on the customers having direct access to accounts of the\n\ncorrespondent bank, and that it is able to provide relevant CDD information upon\n\nrequest to the correspondent bank.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 15\n\nFinancial institutions should be prohibited from entering into, or continuing, a correspondent\n\nbanking relationship with shell banks. Financial institutions should be required to satisfy\n\nthemselves that respondent institutions do not permit their accounts to be used by shell\n\nbanks.\n\n14. Money or value transfer services *\n\nCountries should take measures to ensure that natural or legal persons that provide money or\n\nvalue transfer services (MVTS) are licensed or registered, and subject to effective systems for\n\nmonitoring and ensuring compliance with the relevant measures called for in the FATF\n\nRecommendations. Countries should take action to identify natural or legal persons that carry\n\nout MVTS without a license or registration, and to apply appropriate sanctions.\n\nAny natural or legal person working as an agent should also be licensed or registered by a\n\ncompetent authority, or the MVTS provider should maintain a current list of its agents\n\naccessible by competent authorities in the countries in which the MVTS provider and its\n\nagents operate. Countries should take measures to ensure that MVTS providers that use\n\nagents include them in their AML/CFT programmes and monitor them for compliance with\n\nthese programmes.\n\n15. New technologies\n\nCountries and financial institutions should identify and assess the money laundering or\n\nterrorist financing risks that may arise in relation to (a) the development of new products and\n\nnew business practices, including new delivery mechanisms, and (b) the use of new or\n\ndeveloping technologies for both new and pre-existing products. In the case of financial\n\ninstitutions, such a risk assessment should take place prior to the launch of the new products,\n\nbusiness practices or the use of new or developing technologies. They should take appropriate\n\nmeasures to manage and mitigate those risks.\n\n16. Wire transfers *\n\nCountries should ensure that financial institutions include required and accurate originator\n\ninformation, and required beneficiary information, on wire transfers and related messages,\n\nand that the information remains with the wire transfer or related message throughout the\n\npayment chain.\n\nCountries should ensure that financial institutions monitor wire transfers for the purpose of\n\ndetecting those which lack required originator and/or beneficiary information, and take\n\nappropriate measures.\n\nCountries should ensure that, in the context of processing wire transfers, financial institutions\n\ntake freezing action and should prohibit conducting transactions with designated persons and\n\nentities, as per the obligations set out in the relevant United Nations Security Council\n\nresolutions, such as resolution 1267 (1999) and its successor resolutions, and resolution\n\n1373(2001), relating to the prevention and suppression of terrorism and terrorist financing.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n16 􀂤 2012-2018\n\nRELIANCE, CONTROLS AND FINANCIAL GROUPS\n\n17. Reliance on third parties *\n\nCountries may permit financial institutions to rely on third parties to perform elements (a)-(c)\n\nof the CDD measures set out in Recommendation 10 or to introduce business, provided that\n\nthe criteria set out below are met. Where such reliance is permitted, the ultimate\n\nresponsibility for CDD measures remains with the financial institution relying on the third\n\nparty.\n\nThe criteria that should be met are as follows:\n\n(a) A financial institution relying upon a third party should immediately obtain the\n\nnecessary information concerning elements (a)-(c) of the CDD measures set out in\n\nRecommendation 10.\n\n(b) Financial institutions should take adequate steps to satisfy themselves that copies of\n\nidentification data and other relevant documentation relating to the CDD\n\nrequirements will be made available from the third party upon request without delay.\n\n(c) The financial institution should satisfy itself that the third party is regulated,\n\nsupervised or monitored for, and has measures in place for compliance with, CDD and\n\nrecord-keeping requirements in line with Recommendations 10 and 11.\n\n(d) When determining in which countries the third party that meets the conditions can be\n\nbased, countries should have regard to information available on the level of country\n\nrisk.\n\nWhen a financial institution relies on a third party that is part of the same financial group, and\n\n(i) that group applies CDD and record-keeping requirements, in line with Recommendations\n\n10, 11 and 12, and programmes against money laundering and terrorist financing, in\n\naccordance with Recommendation 18; and (ii) where the effective implementation of those\n\nCDD and record-keeping requirements and AML/CFT programmes is supervised at a group\n\nlevel by a competent authority, then relevant competent authorities may consider that the\n\nfinancial institution applies measures under (b) and (c) above through its group programme,\n\nand may decide that (d) is not a necessary precondition to reliance when higher country risk\n\nis adequately mitigated by the group AML/CFT policies.\n\n18. Internal controls and foreign branches and subsidiaries *\n\nFinancial institutions should be required to implement programmes against money\n\nlaundering and terrorist financing. Financial groups should be required to implement groupwide\n\nprogrammes against money laundering and terrorist financing, including policies and\n\nprocedures for sharing information within the group for AML/CFT purposes.\n\nFinancial institutions should be required to ensure that their foreign branches and majorityowned\n\nsubsidiaries apply AML/CFT measures consistent with the home country\n\nrequirements implementing the FATF Recommendations through the financial groups’\n\nprogrammes against money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 17\n\n19. Higher-risk countries *\n\nFinancial institutions should be required to apply enhanced due diligence measures to\n\nbusiness relationships and transactions with natural and legal persons, and financial\n\ninstitutions, from countries for which this is called for by the FATF. The type of enhanced due\n\ndiligence measures applied should be effective and proportionate to the risks.\n\nCountries should be able to apply appropriate countermeasures when called upon to do so by\n\nthe FATF. Countries should also be able to apply countermeasures independently of any call\n\nby the FATF to do so. Such countermeasures should be effective and proportionate to the\n\nrisks.\n\nREPORTING OF SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS\n\n20. Reporting of suspicious transactions *\n\nIf a financial institution suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect that funds are the\n\nproceeds of a criminal activity, or are related to terrorist financing, it should be required, by\n\nlaw, to report promptly its suspicions to the financial intelligence unit (FIU).\n\n21. Tipping-off and confidentiality\n\nFinancial institutions, their directors, officers and employees should be:\n\n(a) protected by law from criminal and civil liability for breach of any restriction on\n\ndisclosure of information imposed by contract or by any legislative, regulatory or\n\nadministrative provision, if they report their suspicions in good faith to the FIU, even if\n\nthey did not know precisely what the underlying criminal activity was, and regardless\n\nof whether illegal activity actually occurred; and\n\n(b) prohibited by law from disclosing (“tipping-off”) the fact that a suspicious transaction\n\nreport (STR) or related information is being filed with the FIU. These provisions are\n\nnot intended to inhibit information sharing under Recommendation 18.\n\nDESIGNATED NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES AND PROFESSIONS\n\n22. DNFBPs: customer due diligence *\n\nThe customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements set out in Recommendations\n\n10, 11, 12, 15, and 17, apply to designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs)\n\nin the following situations:\n\n(a) Casinos – when customers engage in financial transactions equal to or above the\n\napplicable designated threshold.\n\n(b) Real estate agents – when they are involved in transactions for their client concerning\n\nthe buying and selling of real estate.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n18 􀂤 2012-2018\n\n(c) Dealers in precious metals and dealers in precious stones – when they engage in any\n\ncash transaction with a customer equal to or above the applicable designated\n\nthreshold.\n\n(d) Lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants – when they\n\nprepare for or carry out transactions for their client concerning the following\n\nactivities:\n\n􀂄 buying and selling of real estate;\n\n􀂄 managing of client money, securities or other assets;\n\n􀂄 management of bank, savings or securities accounts;\n\n􀂄 organisation of contributions for the creation, operation or management of\n\ncompanies;\n\n􀂄 creation, operation or management of legal persons or arrangements, and\n\nbuying and selling of business entities.\n\n(e) Trust and company service providers – when they prepare for or carry out\n\ntransactions for a client concerning the following activities:\n\n􀂄 acting as a formation agent of legal persons;\n\n􀂄 acting as (or arranging for another person to act as) a director or secretary of a\n\ncompany, a partner of a partnership, or a similar position in relation to other\n\nlegal persons;\n\n􀂄 providing a registered office, business address or accommodation,\n\ncorrespondence or administrative address for a company, a partnership or any\n\nother legal person or arrangement;\n\n􀂄 acting as (or arranging for another person to act as) a trustee of an express trust\n\nor performing the equivalent function for another form of legal arrangement;\n\n􀂄 acting as (or arranging for another person to act as) a nominee shareholder for\n\nanother person.\n\n23. DNFBPs: Other measures *\n\nThe requirements set out in Recommendations 18 to 21 apply to all designated non-financial\n\nbusinesses and professions, subject to the following qualifications:\n\n(a) Lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants should be\n\nrequired to report suspicious transactions when, on behalf of or for a client, they\n\nengage in a financial transaction in relation to the activities described in paragraph (d)\n\nof Recommendation 22.

TRANSPARENCY AND BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF LEGAL PERSONS AND\n\nARRANGEMENTS\n\n24. Transparency and beneficial ownership of legal persons *\n\nCountries should take measures to prevent the misuse of legal persons for money laundering\n\nor terrorist financing. Countries should ensure that there is adequate, accurate and timely\n\ninformation on the beneficial ownership and control of legal persons that can be obtained or\n\naccessed in a timely fashion by competent authorities. In particular, countries that have legal\n\npersons that are able to issue bearer shares or bearer share warrants, or which allow nominee\n\nshareholders or nominee directors, should take effective measures to ensure that they are not\n\nmisused for money laundering or terrorist financing. Countries should consider measures to\n\nfacilitate access to beneficial ownership and control information by financial institutions and\n\nDNFBPs undertaking the requirements set out in Recommendations 10 and 22.\n\n25. Transparency and beneficial ownership of legal arrangements *\n\nCountries should take measures to prevent the misuse of legal arrangements for money\n\nlaundering or terrorist financing. In particular, countries should ensure that there is adequate,\n\naccurate and timely information on express trusts, including information on the settlor,\n\ntrustee and beneficiaries, that can be obtained or accessed in a timely fashion by competent\n\nauthorities. Countries should consider measures to facilitate access to beneficial ownership\n\nand control information by financial institutions and DNFBPs undertaking the requirements\n\nset out in Recommendations 10 and 22.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 21\n\nF. POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF COMPETENT AUTHORITIES, AND OTHER\n\nINSTITUTIONAL MEASURES\n\nREGULATION AND SUPERVISION\n\n26. Regulation and supervision of financial institutions *\n\nCountries should ensure that financial institutions are subject to adequate regulation and\n\nsupervision and are effectively implementing the FATF Recommendations. Competent\n\nauthorities or financial supervisors should take the necessary legal or regulatory measures to\n\nprevent criminals or their associates from holding, or being the beneficial owner of, a\n\nsignificant or controlling interest, or holding a management function in, a financial institution.\n\nCountries should not approve the establishment, or continued operation, of shell banks.\n\nFor financial institutions subject to the Core Principles, the regulatory and supervisory\n\nmeasures that apply for prudential purposes, and which are also relevant to money\n\nlaundering and terrorist financing, should apply in a similar manner for AML/CFT purposes.\n\nThis should include applying consolidated group supervision for AML/CFT purposes.\n\nOther financial institutions should be licensed or registered and adequately regulated, and\n\nsubject to supervision or monitoring for AML/CFT purposes, having regard to the risk of\n\nmoney laundering or terrorist financing in that sector. At a minimum, where financial\n\ninstitutions provide a service of money or value transfer, or of money or currency changing,\n\nthey should be licensed or registered, and subject to effective systems for monitoring and\n\nensuring compliance with national AML/CFT requirements.\n\n27. Powers of supervisors\n\nSupervisors should have adequate powers to supervise or monitor, and ensure compliance by,\n\nfinancial institutions with requirements to combat money laundering and terrorist financing,\n\nincluding the authority to conduct inspections. They should be authorised to compel\n\nproduction of any information from financial institutions that is relevant to monitoring such\n\ncompliance, and to impose sanctions, in line with Recommendation 35, for failure to comply\n\nwith such requirements. Supervisors should have powers to impose a range of disciplinary\n\nand financial sanctions, including the power to withdraw, restrict or suspend the financial\n\ninstitution’s license, where applicable.\n\n28. Regulation and supervision of DNFBPs *\n\nDesignated non-financial businesses and professions should be subject to regulatory and\n\nsupervisory measures as set out below.\n\n(a) Casinos should be subject to a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory regime that\n\nensures that they have effectively implemented the necessary AML/CFT measures. At\n\na minimum:\n\n􀂄 casinos should be licensed;\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n22 􀂤 2012-2018\n\n􀂄 competent authorities should take the necessary legal or regulatory measures to\n\nprevent criminals or their associates from holding, or being the beneficial owner\n\nof, a significant or controlling interest, holding a management function in, or\n\nbeing an operator of, a casino; and\n\n􀂄 competent authorities should ensure that casinos are effectively supervised for\n\ncompliance with AML/CFT requirements.\n\n(b) Countries should ensure that the other categories of DNFBPs are subject to effective\n\nsystems for monitoring and ensuring compliance with AML/CFT requirements. This\n\nshould be performed on a risk-sensitive basis. This may be performed by (a) a\n\nsupervisor or (b) by an appropriate self-regulatory body (SRB), provided that such a\n\nbody can ensure that its members comply with their obligations to combat money\n\nlaundering and terrorist financing.\n\nThe supervisor or SRB should also (a) take the necessary measures to prevent\n\ncriminals or their associates from being professionally accredited, or holding or being\n\nthe beneficial owner of a significant or controlling interest or holding a management\n\nfunction, e.g. through evaluating persons on the basis of a “fit and proper” test; and (b)\n\nhave effective, proportionate, and dissuasive sanctions in line with Recommendation\n\n35 available to deal with failure to comply with AML/CFT requirements.\n\nOPERATIONAL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT\n\n29. Financial intelligence units *\n\nCountries should establish a financial intelligence unit (FIU) that serves as a national centre\n\nfor the receipt and analysis of: (a) suspicious transaction reports; and (b) other information\n\nrelevant to money laundering, associated predicate offences and terrorist financing, and for\n\nthe dissemination of the results of that analysis. The FIU should be able to obtain additional\n\ninformation from reporting entities, and should have access on a timely basis to the financial,\n\nadministrative and law enforcement information that it requires to undertake its functions\n\nproperly.\n\n30. Responsibilities of law enforcement and investigative authorities *\n\nCountries should ensure that designated law enforcement authorities have responsibility for\n\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing investigations within the framework of national\n\nAML/CFT policies. At least in all cases related to major proceeds-generating offences, these\n\ndesignated law enforcement authorities should develop a pro-active parallel financial\n\ninvestigation when pursuing money laundering, associated predicate offences and terrorist\n\nfinancing. This should include cases where the associated predicate offence occurs outside\n\ntheir jurisdictions. Countries should ensure that competent authorities have responsibility for\n\nexpeditiously identifying, tracing and initiating actions to freeze and seize property that is, or\n\nmay become, subject to confiscation, or is suspected of being proceeds of crime. Countries\n\nshould also make use, when necessary, of permanent or temporary multi-disciplinary groups\n\nspecialised in financial or asset investigations. Countries should ensure that, when necessary,\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 23\n\ncooperative investigations with appropriate competent authorities in other countries take\n\nplace.\n\n31. Powers of law enforcement and investigative authorities\n\nWhen conducting investigations of money laundering, associated predicate offences and\n\nterrorist financing, competent authorities should be able to obtain access to all necessary\n\ndocuments and information for use in those investigations, and in prosecutions and related\n\nactions. This should include powers to use compulsory measures for the production of\n\nrecords held by financial institutions, DNFBPs and other natural or legal persons, for the\n\nsearch of persons and premises, for taking witness statements, and for the seizure and\n\nobtaining of evidence.\n\nCountries should ensure that competent authorities conducting investigations are able to use\n\na wide range of investigative techniques suitable for the investigation of money laundering,\n\nassociated predicate offences and terrorist financing. These investigative techniques include:\n\nundercover operations, intercepting communications, accessing computer systems and\n\ncontrolled delivery. In addition, countries should have effective mechanisms in place to\n\nidentify, in a timely manner, whether natural or legal persons hold or control accounts. They\n\nshould also have mechanisms to ensure that competent authorities have a process to identify\n\nassets without prior notification to the owner. When conducting investigations of money\n\nlaundering, associated predicate offences and terrorist financing, competent authorities\n\nshould be able to ask for all relevant information held by the FIU.\n\n32. Cash couriers *\n\nCountries should have measures in place to detect the physical cross-border transportation of\n\ncurrency and bearer negotiable instruments, including through a declaration system and/or\n\ndisclosure system.\n\nCountries should ensure that their competent authorities have the legal authority to stop or\n\nrestrain currency or bearer negotiable instruments that are suspected to be related to\n\nterrorist financing, money laundering or predicate offences, or that are falsely declared or\n\ndisclosed.\n\nCountries should ensure that effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions are available to\n\ndeal with persons who make false declaration(s) or disclosure(s). In cases where the currency\n\nor bearer negotiable instruments are related to terrorist financing, money laundering or\n\npredicate offences, countries should also adopt measures, including legislative ones consistent\n\nwith Recommendation 4, which would enable the confiscation of such currency or\n\ninstruments.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n24 􀂤 2012-2018\n\nGENERAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n33. Statistics\n\nCountries should maintain comprehensive statistics on matters relevant to the effectiveness\n\nand efficiency of their AML/CFT systems. This should include statistics on the STRs received\n\nand disseminated; on money laundering and terrorist financing investigations, prosecutions\n\nand convictions; on property frozen, seized and confiscated; and on mutual legal assistance or\n\nother international requests for cooperation.\n\n34. Guidance and feedback\n\nThe competent authorities, supervisors and SRBs should establish guidelines, and provide\n\nfeedback, which will assist financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and\n\nprofessions in applying national measures to combat money laundering and terrorist\n\nfinancing, and, in particular, in detecting and reporting suspicious transactions.\n\nSANCTIONS\n\n35. Sanctions\n\nCountries should ensure that there is a range of effective, proportionate and dissuasive\n\nsanctions, whether criminal, civil or administrative, available to deal with natural or legal\n\npersons covered by Recommendations 6, and 8 to 23, that fail to comply with AML/CFT\n\nrequirements. Sanctions should be applicable not only to financial institutions and DNFBPs,\n\nbut also to their directors and senior management.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 25\n\nG. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION\n\n36. International instruments\n\nCountries should take immediate steps to become party to and implement fully the Vienna\n\nConvention, 1988; the Palermo Convention, 2000; the United Nations Convention against\n\nCorruption, 2003; and the Terrorist Financing Convention, 1999. Where applicable, countries\n\nare also encouraged to ratify and implement other relevant international conventions, such as\n\nthe Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, 2001; the Inter-American Convention\n\nagainst Terrorism, 2002; and the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search,\n\nSeizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of Terrorism, 2005.\n\n37. Mutual legal assistance\n\nCountries should rapidly, constructively and effectively provide the widest possible range of\n\nmutual legal assistance in relation to money laundering, associated predicate offences and\n\nterrorist financing investigations, prosecutions, and related proceedings. Countries should\n\nhave an adequate legal basis for providing assistance and, where appropriate, should have in\n\nplace treaties, arrangements or other mechanisms to enhance cooperation. In particular,\n\ncountries should:\n\n(a) Not prohibit, or place unreasonable or unduly restrictive conditions on, the provision\n\nof mutual legal assistance.\n\n(b) Ensure that they have clear and efficient processes for the timely prioritisation and\n\nexecution of mutual legal assistance requests. Countries should use a central authority,\n\nor another established official mechanism, for effective transmission and execution of\n\nrequests. To monitor progress on requests, a case management system should be\n\nmaintained.\n\n(c) Not refuse to execute a request for mutual legal assistance on the sole ground that the\n\noffence is also considered to involve fiscal matters.\n\n(d) Not refuse to execute a request for mutual legal assistance on the grounds that laws\n\nrequire financial institutions or DNFBPs to maintain secrecy or confidentiality (except\n\nwhere the relevant information that is sought is held in circumstances where legal\n\nprofessional privilege or legal professional secrecy applies).\n\n(e) Maintain the confidentiality of mutual legal assistance requests they receive and the\n\ninformation contained in them, subject to fundamental principles of domestic law, in\n\norder to protect the integrity of the investigation or inquiry. If the requested country\n\ncannot comply with the requirement of confidentiality, it should promptly inform the\n\nrequesting country.\n\nCountries should render mutual legal assistance, notwithstanding the absence of dual\n\ncriminality, if the assistance does not involve coercive actions. Countries should consider\n\nadopting such measures as may be necessary to enable them to provide a wide scope of\n\nassistance in the absence of dual criminality.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n26 􀂤 2012-2018\n\nWhere dual criminality is required for mutual legal assistance, that requirement should be\n\ndeemed to be satisfied regardless of whether both countries place the offence within the same\n\ncategory of offence, or denominate the offence by the same terminology, provided that both\n\ncountries criminalise the conduct underlying the offence.\n\nCountries should ensure that, of the powers and investigative techniques required under\n\nRecommendation 31, and any other powers and investigative techniques available to their\n\ncompetent authorities:\n\n(a) all those relating to the production, search and seizure of information, documents or\n\nevidence (including financial records) from financial institutions or other persons, and\n\nthe taking of witness statements; and\n\n(b) a broad range of other powers and investigative techniques;\n\nare also available for use in response to requests for mutual legal assistance, and, if consistent\n\nwith their domestic framework, in response to direct requests from foreign judicial or law\n\nenforcement authorities to domestic counterparts.\n\nTo avoid conflicts of jurisdiction, consideration should be given to devising and applying\n\nmechanisms for determining the best venue for prosecution of defendants in the interests of\n\njustice in cases that are subject to prosecution in more than one country.\n\nCountries should, when making mutual legal assistance requests, make best efforts to provide\n\ncomplete factual and legal information that will allow for timely and efficient execution of\n\nrequests, including any need for urgency, and should send requests using expeditious means.\n\nCountries should, before sending requests, make best efforts to ascertain the legal\n\nrequirements and formalities to obtain assistance.\n\nThe authorities responsible for mutual legal assistance (e.g. a Central Authority) should be\n\nprovided with adequate financial, human and technical resources. Countries should have in\n\nplace processes to ensure that the staff of such authorities maintain high professional\n\nstandards, including standards concerning confidentiality, and should be of high integrity and\n\nbe appropriately skilled.\n\n38. Mutual legal assistance: freezing and confiscation *\n\nCountries should ensure that they have the authority to take expeditious action in response to\n\nrequests by foreign countries to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate property laundered;\n\nproceeds from money laundering, predicate offences and terrorist financing; instrumentalities\n\nused in, or intended for use in, the commission of these offences; or property of corresponding\n\nvalue. This authority should include being able to respond to requests made on the basis of\n\nnon-conviction-based confiscation proceedings and related provisional measures, unless this\n\nis inconsistent with fundamental principles of their domestic law. Countries should also have\n\neffective mechanisms for managing such property, instrumentalities or property of\n\ncorresponding value, and arrangements for coordinating seizure and confiscation\n\nproceedings, which should include the sharing of confiscated assets.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 27\n\n39. Extradition\n\nCountries should constructively and effectively execute extradition requests in relation to\n\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing, without undue delay. Countries should also take all\n\npossible measures to ensure that they do not provide safe havens for individuals charged with\n\nthe financing of terrorism, terrorist acts or terrorist organisations. In particular, countries\n\nshould:\n\n(a) ensure money laundering and terrorist financing are extraditable offences;\n\n(b) ensure that they have clear and efficient processes for the timely execution of\n\nextradition requests including prioritisation where appropriate. To monitor progress\n\nof requests a case management system should be maintained;\n\n(c) not place unreasonable or unduly restrictive conditions on the execution of requests;\n\nand\n\n(d) ensure they have an adequate legal framework for extradition.\n\nEach country should either extradite its own nationals, or, where a country does not do so\n\nsolely on the grounds of nationality, that country should, at the request of the country seeking\n\nextradition, submit the case, without undue delay, to its competent authorities for the purpose\n\nof prosecution of the offences set forth in the request. Those authorities should take their\n\ndecision and conduct their proceedings in the same manner as in the case of any other offence\n\nof a serious nature under the domestic law of that country. The countries concerned should\n\ncooperate with each other, in particular on procedural and evidentiary aspects, to ensure the\n\nefficiency of such prosecutions.\n\nWhere dual criminality is required for extradition, that requirement should be deemed to be\n\nsatisfied regardless of whether both countries place the offence within the same category of\n\noffence, or denominate the offence by the same terminology, provided that both countries\n\ncriminalise the conduct underlying the offence.\n\nConsistent with fundamental principles of domestic law, countries should have simplified\n\nextradition mechanisms, such as allowing direct transmission of requests for provisional\n\narrests between appropriate authorities, extraditing persons based only on warrants of\n\narrests or judgments, or introducing a simplified extradition of consenting persons who waive\n\nformal extradition proceedings. The authorities responsible for extradition should be\n\nprovided with adequate financial, human and technical resources. Countries should have in\n\nplace processes to ensure that the staff of such authorities maintain high professional\n\nstandards, including standards concerning confidentiality, and should be of high integrity and\n\nbe appropriately skilled.\n\n40. Other forms of international cooperation *\n\nCountries should ensure that their competent authorities can rapidly, constructively and\n\neffectively provide the widest range of international cooperation in relation to money\n\nlaundering, associated predicate offences and terrorist financing. Countries should do so both\n\nspontaneously and upon request, and there should be a lawful basis for providing\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n28 􀂤 2012-2018\n\ncooperation. Countries should authorise their competent authorities to use the most efficient\n\nmeans to cooperate. Should a competent authority need bilateral or multilateral agreements\n\nor arrangements, such as a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), these should be\n\nnegotiated and signed in a timely way with the widest range of foreign counterparts.\n\nCompetent authorities should use clear channels or mechanisms for the effective transmission\n\nand execution of requests for information or other types of assistance. Competent authorities\n\nshould have clear and efficient processes for the prioritisation and timely execution of\n\nrequests, and for safeguarding the information received.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 29\n\nINTERPRETIVE NOTES TO THE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERPRETIVE NOTE TO RECOMMENDATION 1\n\n(ASSESSING RISKS AND APPLYING A RISK-BASED APPROACH)\n\n1. The risk-based approach (RBA) is an effective way to combat money laundering and terrorist\n\nfinancing. In determining how the RBA should be implemented in a sector, countries should\n\nconsider the capacity and anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism\n\n(AML/CFT) experience of the relevant sector. Countries should understand that the discretion\n\nafforded, and responsibility imposed on, financial institutions and designated non-financial\n\nbodies and professions (DNFBPs) by the RBA is more appropriate in sectors with greater\n\nAML/CFT capacity and experience. This should not exempt financial institutions and DNFBPs\n\nfrom the requirement to apply enhanced measures when they identify higher risk scenarios.\n\nBy adopting a risk-based approach, competent authorities, financial institutions and DNFBPs\n\nshould be able to ensure that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and terrorist\n\nfinancing are commensurate with the risks identified, and would enable them to make\n\ndecisions on how to allocate their own resources in the most effective way.\n\n2. In implementing a RBA, financial institutions and DNFBPs should have in place processes to\n\nidentify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks.\n\nThe general principle of a RBA is that, where there are higher risks, countries should require\n\nfinancial institutions and DNFBPs to take enhanced measures to manage and mitigate those\n\nrisks; and that, correspondingly, where the risks are lower, simplified measures may be\n\npermitted. Simplified measures should not be permitted whenever there is a suspicion of\n\nmoney laundering or terrorist financing. Specific Recommendations set out more precisely\n\nhow this general principle applies to particular requirements. Countries may also, in strictly\n\nlimited circumstances and where there is a proven low risk of money laundering and terrorist\n\nfinancing, decide not to apply certain Recommendations to a particular type of financial\n\ninstitution or activity, or DNFBP (see below). Equally, if countries determine through their\n\nrisk assessments that there are types of institutions, activities, businesses or professions that\n\nare at risk of abuse from money laundering and terrorist financing, and which do not fall\n\nunder the definition of financial institution or DNFBP, they should consider applying\n\nAML/CFT requirements to such sectors.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n30 􀂤 2012-2018\n\nA. Obligations and decisions for countries\n\n3. Assessing risk - Countries1 should take appropriate steps to identify and assess the money\n\nlaundering and terrorist financing risks for the country, on an ongoing basis and in order to:\n\n(i) inform potential changes to the country’s AML/CFT regime, including changes to laws,\n\nregulations and other measures; (ii) assist in the allocation and prioritisation of AML/CFT\n\nresources by competent authorities; and (iii) make information available for AML/CFT risk\n\nassessments conducted by financial institutions and DNFBPs. Countries should keep the\n\nassessments up-to-date, and should have mechanisms to provide appropriate information on\n\nthe results to all relevant competent authorities and self-regulatory bodies (SRBs), financial\n\ninstitutions and DNFBPs.\n\n4. Higher risk - Where countries identify higher risks, they should ensure that their AML/CFT\n\nregime addresses these higher risks, and, without prejudice to any other measures taken by\n\ncountries to mitigate these higher risks, either prescribe that financial institutions and\n\nDNFBPs take enhanced measures to manage and mitigate the risks, or ensure that this\n\ninformation is incorporated into risk assessments carried out by financial institutions and\n\nDNFBPs, in order to manage and mitigate risks appropriately. Where the FATF\n\nRecommendations identify higher risk activities for which enhanced or specific measures are\n\nrequired, all such measures must be applied, although the extent of such measures may vary\n\naccording to the specific level of risk.\n\n5. Lower risk - Countries may decide to allow simplified measures for some of the FATF\n\nRecommendations requiring financial institutions or DNFBPs to take certain actions, provided\n\nthat a lower risk has been identified, and this is consistent with the country’s assessment of its\n\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing risks, as referred to in paragraph 3.\n\nIndependent of any decision to specify certain lower risk categories in line with the previous\n\nparagraph, countries may also allow financial institutions and DNFBPs to apply simplified\n\ncustomer due diligence (CDD) measures, provided that the requirements set out in section B\n\nbelow (“Obligations and decisions for financial institutions and DNFBPs”), and in paragraph 7\n\nbelow, are met.\n\n6. Exemptions - Countries may decide not to apply some of the FATF Recommendations\n\nrequiring financial institutions or DNFBPs to take certain actions, provided:\n\n(a) there is a proven low risk of money laundering and terrorist financing; this occurs in\n\nstrictly limited and justified circumstances; and it relates to a particular type of\n\nfinancial institution or activity, or DNFBP; or\n\n(b) a financial activity (other than the transferring of money or value) is carried out by a\n\nnatural or legal person on an occasional or very limited basis (having regard to\n\nquantitative and absolute criteria), such that there is low risk of money laundering and\n\nterrorist financing.\n\n1 Where appropriate, AML/CFT risk assessments at a supra-national level should be taken into account\n\nwhen considering whether this obligation is satisfied.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 31\n\nWhile the information gathered may vary according to the level of risk, the requirements of\n\nRecommendation 11 to retain information should apply to whatever information is gathered.\n\n7. Supervision and monitoring of risk - Supervisors (or SRBs for relevant DNFBPs sectors)\n\nshould ensure that financial institutions and DNFBPs are effectively implementing the\n\nobligations set out below. When carrying out this function, supervisors and SRBs should, as\n\nand when required in accordance with the Interpretive Notes to Recommendations 26 and 28,\n\nreview the money laundering and terrorist financing risk profiles and risk assessments\n\nprepared by financial institutions and DNFBPs, and take the result of this review into\n\nconsideration.\n\nB. Obligations and decisions for financial institutions and DNFBPs\n\n8. Assessing risk - Financial institutions and DNFBPs should be required to take appropriate\n\nsteps to identify and assess their money laundering and terrorist financing risks (for\n\ncustomers, countries or geographic areas; and products, services, transactions or delivery\n\nchannels). They should document those assessments in order to be able to demonstrate their\n\nbasis, keep these assessments up to date, and have appropriate mechanisms to provide risk\n\nassessment information to competent authorities and SRBs. The nature and extent of any\n\nassessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks should be appropriate to the\n\nnature and size of the business. Financial institutions and DNFBPs should always understand\n\ntheir money laundering and terrorist financing risks, but competent authorities or SRBs may\n\ndetermine that individual documented risk assessments are not required, if the specific risks\n\ninherent to the sector are clearly identified and understood.\n\n9. Risk management and mitigation - Financial institutions and DNFBPs should be required to\n\nhave policies, controls and procedures that enable them to manage and mitigate effectively\n\nthe risks that have been identified (either by the country or by the financial institution or\n\nDNFBP). They should be required to monitor the implementation of those controls and to\n\nenhance them, if necessary. The policies, controls and procedures should be approved by\n\nsenior management, and the measures taken to manage and mitigate the risks (whether\n\nhigher or lower) should be consistent with national requirements and with guidance from\n\ncompetent authorities and SRBs.\n\n10. Higher risk - Where higher risks are identified financial institutions and DNFBPs should be\n\nrequired to take enhanced measures to manage and mitigate the risks.\n\n11. Lower risk - Where lower risks are identified, countries may allow financial institutions and\n\nDNFBPs to take simplified measures to manage and mitigate those risks.\n\n12. When assessing risk, financial institutions and DNFBPs should consider all the relevant risk\n\nfactors before determining what is the level of overall risk and the appropriate level of\n\nmitigation to be applied. Financial institutions and DNFBPs may differentiate the extent of\n\nmeasures, depending on the type and level of risk for the various risk factors (e.g. in a\n\nparticular situation, they could apply normal CDD for customer acceptance measures, but\n\nenhanced CDD for ongoing monitoring, or vice versa).\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n32 􀂤 2012-2018\n\nINTERPRETIVE NOTE TO RECOMMENDATION 3\n\n(MONEY LAUNDERING OFFENCE)\n\n1. Countries should criminalise money laundering on the basis of the United Nations Convention\n\nagainst Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988 (the Vienna\n\nConvention) and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 2000\n\n(the Palermo Convention).\n\n2. Countries should apply the crime of money laundering to all serious offences, with a view to\n\nincluding the widest range of predicate offences. Predicate offences may be described by\n\nreference to all offences; or to a threshold linked either to a category of serious offences; or to\n\nthe penalty of imprisonment applicable to the predicate offence (threshold approach); or to a\n\nlist of predicate offences; or a combination of these approaches.\n\n3. Where countries apply a threshold approach, predicate offences should, at a minimum,\n\ncomprise all offences that fall within the category of serious offences under their national law,\n\nor should include offences that are punishable by a maximum penalty of more than one year’s\n\nimprisonment, or, for those countries that have a minimum threshold for offences in their\n\nlegal system, predicate offences should comprise all offences that are punished by a minimum\n\npenalty of more than six months imprisonment.\n\n4. Whichever approach is adopted, each country should, at a minimum, include a range of\n\noffences within each of the designated categories of offences. The offence of money laundering\n\nshould extend to any type of property, regardless of its value, that directly or indirectly\n\nrepresents the proceeds of crime. When proving that property is the proceeds of crime, it\n\nshould not be necessary that a person be convicted of a predicate offence.\n\n5. Predicate offences for money laundering should extend to conduct that occurred in another\n\ncountry, which constitutes an offence in that country, and which would have constituted a\n\npredicate offence had it occurred domestically. Countries may provide that the only\n\nprerequisite is that the conduct would have constituted a predicate offence, had it occurred\n\ndomestically.\n\n6. Countries may provide that the offence of money laundering does not apply to persons who\n\ncommitted the predicate offence, where this is required by fundamental principles of their\n\ndomestic law.\n\n7. Countries should ensure that:\n\n(a) The intent and knowledge required to prove the offence of money laundering may be\n\ninferred from objective factual circumstances.\n\n(b) Effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal sanctions should apply to natural\n\npersons convicted of money laundering.\n\n(c) Criminal liability and sanctions, and, where that is not possible (due to fundamental\n\nprinciples of domestic law), civil or administrative liability and sanctions, should apply\n\nto legal persons. This should not preclude parallel criminal, civil or administrative\n\nproceedings with respect to legal persons in countries in which more than one form of\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 33\n\nliability is available. Such measures should be without prejudice to the criminal\n\nliability of natural persons. All sanctions should be effective, proportionate and\n\ndissuasive.\n\n(d) There should be appropriate ancillary offences to the offence of money laundering,\n\nincluding participation in, association with or conspiracy to commit, attempt, aiding\n\nand abetting, facilitating, and counselling the commission, unless this is not permitted\n\nby fundamental principles of domestic law.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n34 􀂤 2012-2018\n\nINTERPRETIVE NOTE TO RECOMMENDATIONS 4 AND 38\n\n(CONFISCATION AND PROVISIONAL MEASURES)\n\nCountries should establish mechanisms that will enable their competent authorities to effectively\n\nmanage and, when necessary, dispose of, property that is frozen or seized, or has been confiscated.\n\nThese mechanisms should be applicable both in the context of domestic proceedings, and pursuant\n\nto requests by foreign countries.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 35\n\nINTERPRETIVE NOTE TO RECOMMENDATION 5\n\n(TERRORIST FINANCING OFFENCE)\n\nA. Objectives\n\n1. Recommendation 5 was developed with the objective of ensuring that countries have the legal\n\ncapacity to prosecute and apply criminal sanctions to persons that finance terrorism. Given\n\nthe close connection between international terrorism and, inter alia, money laundering,\n\nanother objective of Recommendation 5 is to emphasise this link by obligating countries to\n\ninclude terrorist financing offences as predicate offences for money laundering.\n\nB. Characteristics of the terrorist financing offence\n\n2. Terrorist financing offences should extend to any person who wilfully provides or collects\n\nfunds or other assets by any means, directly or indirectly, with the unlawful intention that\n\nthey should be used, or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part: (a) to carry\n\nout a terrorist act(s); (b) by a terrorist organisation; or (c) by an individual terrorist.\n\n3. Terrorist financing includes financing the travel of individuals who travel to a State other than\n\ntheir States of residence or nationality for the purpose of the perpetration, planning, or\n\npreparation of, or participation in, terrorist acts or the providing or receiving of terrorist\n\ntraining.\n\n4. Criminalising terrorist financing solely on the basis of aiding and abetting, attempt, or\n\nconspiracy is not sufficient to comply with this Recommendation.\n\n5. Terrorist financing offences should extend to any funds or other assets, whether from a\n\nlegitimate or illegitimate source.\n\n6. Terrorist financing offences should not require that the funds or other assets: (a) were\n\nactually used to carry out or attempt a terrorist act(s); or (b) be linked to a specific terrorist\n\nact(s).\n\n7. Countries should ensure that the intent and knowledge required to prove the offence of\n\nterrorist financing may be inferred from objective factual circumstances.\n\n8. Effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal sanctions should apply to natural persons\n\nconvicted of terrorist financing.\n\n9. Criminal liability and sanctions, and, where that is not possible (due to fundamental principles\n\nof domestic law), civil or administrative liability and sanctions, should apply to legal persons.\n\nThis should not preclude parallel criminal, civil or administrative proceedings with respect to\n\nlegal persons in countries in which more than one form of liability is available. Such measures\n\nshould be without prejudice to the criminal liability of natural persons. All sanctions should be\n\neffective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n\n10. It should also be an offence to attempt to commit the offence of terrorist financing.\n\n11. It should also be an offence to engage in any of the following types of conduct:\n\n(a) Participating as an accomplice in an offence, as set forth in paragraphs 2 or 9 of this\n\nInterpretive Note;\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n36 􀂤 2012-2018\n\n(b) Organising or directing others to commit an offence, as set forth in paragraphs 2 or 9 of\n\nthis Interpretive Note;\n\n(c) Contributing to the commission of one or more offence(s), as set forth in paragraphs 2\n\nor 9 of this Interpretive Note, by a group of persons acting with a common purpose.\n\nSuch contribution shall be intentional and shall either: (i) be made with the aim of\n\nfurthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group, where such activity\n\nor purpose involves the commission of a terrorist financing offence; or (ii) be made in\n\nthe knowledge of the intention of the group to commit a terrorist financing offence.\n\n12. Terrorist financing offences should apply, regardless of whether the person alleged to have\n\ncommitted the offence(s) is in the same country or a different country from the one in which\n\nthe terrorist(s)/terrorist organisation(s) is located or the terrorist act(s) occurred/will occur.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 37\n\nINTERPRETIVE NOTE TO RECOMMENDATION 6\n\n(TARGETED FINANCIAL SANCTIONS RELATED TO TERRORISM\n\nAND TERRORIST FINANCING)\n\nA. OBJECTIVE\n\n1. Recommendation 6 requires each country to implement targeted financial sanctions to\n\ncomply with the United Nations Security Council resolutions that require countries to freeze,\n\nwithout delay, the funds or other assets, and to ensure that no funds and other assets are\n\nmade available to or for the benefit of: (i) any person2 or entity designated by the United\n\nNations Security Council (the Security Council) under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United\n\nNations, as required by Security Council resolution 1267 (1999) and its successor\n\nresolutions3; or (ii) any person or entity designated by that country pursuant to Security\n\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001).\n\n2. It should be stressed that none of the obligations in Recommendation 6 is intended to replace\n\nother measures or obligations that may already be in place for dealing with funds or other\n\nassets in the context of a criminal, civil or administrative investigation or proceeding, as is\n\nrequired by Recommendation 4 (confiscation and provisional measures)4. Measures under\n\nRecommendation 6 may complement criminal proceedings against a designated person or\n\nentity, and be adopted by a competent authority or a court, but are not conditional upon the\n\nexistence of such proceedings. Instead, the focus of Recommendation 6 is on the preventive\n\nmeasures that are necessary and unique in the context of stopping the flow of funds or other\n\nassets to terrorist groups; and the use of funds or other assets by terrorist groups. In\n\ndetermining the limits of, or fostering widespread support for, an effective counter-terrorist\n\nfinancing regime, countries must also respect human rights, respect the rule of law, and\n\nrecognise the rights of innocent third parties.\n\n2 Natural or legal person.\n\n3 Recommendation 6 is applicable to all current and future successor resolutions to resolution 1267(1999)\n\nand any future UNSCRs which impose targeted financial sanctions in the terrorist financing context. At\n\nthe time of issuance of this Interpretive Note, (February 2012), the successor resolutions to resolution\n\n1267 (1999) are resolutions: 1333 (2000), 1363 (2001), 1390 (2002), 1452 (2002), 1455 (2003), 1526\n\n(2004), 1617 (2005), 1730 (2006), 1735 (2006), 1822 (2008), 1904 (2009), 1988 (2011), and 1989\n\n(2011).\n\n4 Based on requirements set, for instance, in the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic\n\nDrugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988)(the Vienna Convention) and the United Nations Convention\n\nagainst Transnational Organised Crime (2000) (the Palermo Convention), which contain obligations\n\nregarding freezing, seizure and confiscation in the context of combating transnational crime.\n\nAdditionally, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (1999)(the\n\nTerrorist Financing Convention) contains obligations regarding freezing, seizure and confiscation in the\n\ncontext of combating terrorist financing. Those obligations exist separately and apart from the\n\nobligations set forth in Recommendation 6 and the United Nations Security Council Resolutions related\n\nto terrorist financing.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n38 􀂤 2012-2018\n\nB. IDENTIFYING AND DESIGNATING PERSONS AND ENTITIES FINANCING\n\nOR SUPPORTING TERRORIST ACTIVITIES\n\n3. For resolution 1267 (1999) and its successor resolutions, designations relating to Al-Qaida\n\nare made by the 1267 Committee, and designations pertaining to the Taliban and related\n\nthreats to Afghanistan are made by the 1988 Committee, with both Committees acting under\n\nthe authority of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. For resolution 1373 (2001),\n\ndesignations are made, at the national or supranational level, by a country or countries acting\n\non their own motion, or at the request of another country, if the country receiving the request\n\nis satisfied, according to applicable legal principles, that a requested designation is supported\n\nby reasonable grounds, or a reasonable basis, to suspect or believe that the proposed designee\n\nmeets the criteria for designation in resolution 1373 (2001), as set forth in Section E.\n\n4. Countries need to have the authority, and effective procedures or mechanisms, to identify and\n\ninitiate proposals for designations of persons and entities targeted by resolution 1267 (1999)\n\nand its successor resolutions, consistent with the obligations set out in those Security Council\n\nresolutions5. Such authority and procedures or mechanisms are essential to propose persons\n\nand entities to the Security Council for designation in accordance with Security Council listbased\n\nprogrammes, pursuant to those Security Council resolutions. Countries also need to\n\nhave the authority and effective procedures or mechanisms to identify and initiate\n\ndesignations of persons and entities pursuant to S/RES/1373 (2001), consistent with the\n\nobligations set out in that Security Council resolution. Such authority and procedures or\n\nmechanisms are essential to identify persons and entities who meet the criteria identified in\n\nresolution 1373 (2001), described in Section E. A country’s regime to implement resolution\n\n1267 (1999) and its successor resolutions, and resolution 1373 (2001), should include the\n\nfollowing necessary elements:\n\n(a) Countries should identify a competent authority or a court as having responsibility for:\n\n(i) proposing to the 1267 Committee, for designation as appropriate, persons or\n\nentities that meet the specific criteria for designation, as set forth in Security\n\nCouncil resolution 1989 (2011) (on Al-Qaida) and related resolutions, if that\n\nauthority decides to do so and believes that it has sufficient evidence to support\n\nthe designation criteria;\n\n(ii) proposing to the 1988 Committee, for designation as appropriate, persons or\n\nentities that meet the specific criteria for designation, as set forth in Security\n\nCouncil resolution 1988 (2011) (on the Taliban and those associated with the\n\nTaliban in constituting a threat to the peace, stability and security of\n\nAfghanistan) and related resolutions, if that authority decides to do so and\n\nbelieves that it has sufficient evidence to support the designation criteria; and\n\n5 The relevant Security Council resolutions do not require countries to identify persons or entities and\n\nsubmit these to the relevant United Nations Committees, but to have the authority and effective\n\nprocedures and mechanisms in place to be able to do so.\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n􀂤 2012-2018 39\n\n(iii) designating persons or entities that meet the specific criteria for designation, as\n\nset forth in resolution 1373 (2001), as put forward either on the country’s own\n\nmotion or, after examining and giving effect to, if appropriate, the request of\n\nanother country, if the country receiving the request is satisfied, according to\n\napplicable legal principles, that a requested designation is supported by\n\nreasonable grounds, or a reasonable basis, to suspect or believe that the\n\nproposed designee meets the criteria for designation in resolution 1373 (2001),\n\nas set forth in Section E.\n\n(b) Countries should have a mechanism(s) for identifying targets for designation, based on\n\nthe designation criteria set out in resolution 1988 (2011) and resolution 1989 (2011)\n\nand related resolutions, and resolution 1373 (2001) (see Section E for the specific\n\ndesignation criteria of relevant Security Council resolutions). This includes having\n\nauthority and effective procedures or mechanisms to examine and give effect to, if\n\nappropriate, the actions initiated under the freezing mechanisms of other countries\n\npursuant to resolution 1373 (2001). To ensure that effective cooperation is developed\n\namong countries, countries should ensure that, when receiving a request, they make a\n\nprompt determination whether they are satisfied, according to applicable (supra-)\n\nnational principles, that the request is supported by reasonable grounds, or a\n\nreasonable basis, to suspect or believe that the proposed designee meets the criteria\n\nfor designation in resolution 1373 (2011), as set forth in Section E.\n\n(c) The competent authority(ies) should have appropriate legal authorities and\n\nprocedures or mechanisms to collect or solicit as much information as possible from\n\nall relevant sources to identify persons and entities that, based on reasonable grounds,\n\nor a reasonable basis to suspect or believe, meet the criteria for designation in the\n\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.\n\n(d) When deciding whether or not to make a (proposal for) designation, countries should\n\napply an evidentiary standard of proof of “reasonable grounds” or “reasonable basis”.\n\nFor designations under resolutions 1373 (2001), the competent authority of each\n\ncountry will apply the legal standard of its own legal system regarding the kind and\n\nquantum of evidence for the determination that “reasonable grounds” or “reasonable\n\nbasis” exist for a decision to designate a person or entity, and thus initiate an action\n\nunder a freezing mechanism. This is the case irrespective of whether the proposed\n\ndesignation is being put forward on the relevant country’s own motion or at the\n\nrequest of another country. Such (proposals for) designations should not be\n\nconditional upon the existence of a criminal proceeding.\n\n(e) When proposing names to the 1267 Committee for inclusion on the Al-Qaida Sanctions\n\nList, pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) and its successor resolutions, countries\n\nshould:\n\n(i) follow the procedures and standard forms for listing, as adopted by the 1267\n\nCommittee;\n\nTHE FATF RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM & PROLIFERATION\n\n40 􀂤 2012-2018\n\n(ii) provide as much relevant information as possible on the proposed name, in\n\nparticular, sufficient identifying information to allow for the accurate and\n\npositive identification of individuals, groups, undertakings, and entities, and to\n\nthe extent possible, the information required by Interpol to issue a Special\n\nNotice;\n\n(iii) provide a statement of case which contains as much detail as possible on the\n\nbasis for the listing, including: specific information supporting a determination\n\nthat the person or entity meets the relevant criteria f"
