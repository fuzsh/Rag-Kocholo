        "text": "Leonid Gaidai’s comedies of the 1960s owed their phenomenal success to Gaidai’s visual style of humor, which starkly contrasted to verbal instantiations of official Soviet ideology within narrative-driven Soviet cinema. An attentive comparison between Gaidai’s comedies and the satirical films of El'dar Riazanov accounts for the outstanding popularity of the former and the more modest success of the latter. What makes Gaidai unique is his interest in visual, especially physical, humor. Gaidai privileged key elements of physical comedy, such as the primacy of visual over verbal humor, an exhibitionistic enlargement of the human body as a comic attraction, the transition from a still image to a moving picture as a visual attraction, and, most important, a chain of loosely connected sight gags (which became his signature structure) over a coherent and cohesive narrative. By contrast, Riazanov’s satires tended to mock social vices and therefore relied heavily on a goal-oriented ideological narrative.\n\nI would like to thank my colleagues and mentors who read this article in full or in part at various stages of its development. I owe a special debt to Helena Goscilo and Lucy Fischer. Lucy’s seminars on film theory and comedy, and especially her article on comedy and matricide, sparked my interest in film comedy. Helena simply taught me how to theorize culture, made many helpful suggestions on the article, and went through every page of the final draft with a critical eye. I am indebted to Vladimir Padunov, Tony Anemone, Roberta Hatcher, and the anonymous readers at Slavic Review for their comments and suggestions. Their critiques proved invaluable, and where I stubbornly refused to follow their advice, the fault rests entirely with myself. Finally, my special thanks go to Birgit Beumers for her friendly patience and encouragement. The epigraphs are taken from Aristode, , Poetics, trans. Else, Gerald F.

Taylor, Richard (London, 1994), 72 Google Scholar.\n\n1 Gaidai’s Operation Y and Other Adventures of Shurik brought 70 million spectators to Soviet movie theaters and became the most watched film of the year. See Segida, Miroslava and Zemlianukhin, Sergei, Domashniaia sinemateka (Moscow, 1996), 303 Google Scholar. Gaidai’s Captive of the Caucasus or the Neiu Adventures of Shurik repeated the success of Operation Y and became the most attended film the following year: 77 million viewers. The Diamond Arm again ranked first among Soviet films for the year, attracting 77 million viewers. Ibid., 186, 4 4 - 45. In 1995 the Russian television channel RTR named The Diamond Arm “the best comedy ever made” and awarded it the “Golden Ticket” prize. See Brashinskii, Mikhail, “Leonid Gaidai,” Kinoslovar': Noveishaia istoriia otechestvennogo kino 1986-2000 (St. Petersburg, 2001), 233–34Google Scholar.\n\n2 Attendance at Riazanov’s films during the 1960s was high, but considerably lower than that at Gaidai’s: The Hussar’s Ballad (49 million viewers), Give Me the Complaints Book (29.9 million viewers), Beware of the Car (29 million viewers), and Zigzag of Luck (24 million viewers). Riazanov’s 1961 comedy Chelovek niotkuda (A man from nowhere) was shelved.\n\nNo numbers are available for tickets sold to the portmanteau film Sovershenno ser'ezno (Absolutely serious, 1961), where both Riazanov’s “How Robinson Was Created,” and Gaidai’s short “Pes Barbos i neobyknovennyi kross” (Dog Barbos and the unusual race) appeared. All critics, however, point out that it was Gaidai’s short diat made Absolutely Serious popular. Lev Lainer notes that out of five shorts in Absolutely Serious, only Gaidai’s was purchased for the price of a feature film by almost a hundred countries. See Lainer, Lev, Veselaiatroitsa (Moscow, 2001), 27 Google Scholar. See also Pupsheva, Mariia, Ivanov, Valerii, and Tsukerman, Vladimir, Gaidai sovetskogo soiuza (Moscow, 2002), 68–89 Google Scholar. Riazanov’s Irony of Fate premiered first on television and then because of its phenomenal success was released in die movie theaters, where 7 million tickets were sold. Office Romance drew 58.4 million viewers.

Literaturnaia Moskva and Tarusskie stranitsy became the bestknown miscellanies because they both introduced new writers, such as Aleksandr Iashin and Naum Korzhavin, for example, and revived in cultural memory the forgotten names of such authors as Marina Tsvetaeva and Nikolai Zabolotskii. The publication of the miscellanies was usually accompanied by conflicts with cultural authorities. See Moser, Charles, ed., The Cambridge History of Russian Literature (Cambridge, Eng., 1992), 530–31CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n25 My understanding of the sight gag follows Noel Carroll’s definition: “The sight gag is a form of visual humor in which amusement is generated by the play of alternative interpretations projected by the image or the images series… . And it is this play of alternative, often conflicting interpretations, rooted first and foremost in the visual organization of the scene, that primarily causes the amusement that attends sight gags.” See Carroll, Noel, “Notes on the Sight Gag,” in Horton, Andrew, ed., Comedy, Cinema, Theory (Berkeley, 1991), 26 Google Scholar.\n\n28 Georgii Vitsyn (1918-2001) studied acting at the Vakhtangov Theater School and the Second MKhAT School and enjoyed popularity as an actor in both theater and film. He appeared in 94 films, both comedies and dramas. Iurii Nikulin (1921-1997) started his performing career as a circus clown, became a popular film actor, and served as the director of the Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoi Boulevard until his death. After Nikulin’s death the circus was renamed Nikulin’s Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoi Boulevard. Evgenii Morgunov (1927-1999) was primarily a film actor at MosfiTm Studio, although he also performed at the Teatr studiia kinoaktera. He started his career in 1948 in Sergei Gerasimov’s film adaptation of a socialist realist novel, Molodaia guardiia (The young guard) by Aleksander Fadeev. In 1963 Morgunov also directed a comedy, Kogda kazaki plachut (When Cossacks cry), whose screenplay he coauthored with Mikhail Sholokhov.\n\n32 Gaidai also planned to finish his later film The Diamond Arm with a nuclear explosion, which was for him the ultimate sight gag. See Natal'ia Savitskaia and Svetlana Lepeshkova, “Iadernyi vzryv v ‘Brilliantovoi ruke,’” Nezavisimaia gazeta, 31 January 2003. Obviously, Gaidai was asked to cut the documentary footage of a nuclear explosion because, for the cultural administrators, a nuclear explosion belonged among serious political and ideological narratives, into whose company a comedy could by no means be incorporated. For Gaidai, however, a nuclear explosion was a cinematic event set against the grain of a film’s narrative."
