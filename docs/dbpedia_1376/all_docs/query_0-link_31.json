LaRouche, Jr. The report you are now reading is, up to the present time, the only comprehensive documentation of the current Soviet strategic threat avail- able publicly in any language. Every fact listed has been cross-checked with leading authorities in NATO and other countries. Each evaluation of those facts has been reviewed with a dozen or more leading experts from the same roster of authoritative specialists. There has been almost no disagreement on facts bearing upon Soviet capabilities, and most agree that the period 1987-89 is the most probable point at which Soviet military superiority will reach the point at which Moscow might win and survive a \"first strike\" thermonuclear assault against the United States. Among the experts, there is a somewhat varied estimate as to how the Soviets might choose to exploit their military advantage, but no signif- icant disagreement on the rate of growth of that advantage, and little disagreement on Moscow's near-term strategic aims. Most are profoundly alarmed by that wishful, \"Neville Chamberlain-like,\" blindness to in- contestable military facts of the threat, which prevails among most leading political circles and governments of the NATO countries. Beyond that point, some disagreement has been expressed. All agree on the urgency of the situation, and also agree that present NATO policies are disastrously inadequate to cope with the threat. Most agree that the present monetary and economic policies of NATO countries are a strategic disaster in terms of their effects, but there is some disagreement on the subject of alternative monetary and economic policies, and limited con- currence, so far, on the best choice of approach to related political problems of policy-shaping among the Western Allies. Despite some disagreements with some of EIR's monetary, economic, and political recommendations, among the experts consulted, they are more or less uniformly delighted that EIR has committed itself to pub- lication of this present report. The key problem is, that the official strategic estimates of the NATO governments, especially the United States', have no correspondence to the crucial facts collected by official military and intelligence services. The facts seem to vanish somewhere in the process, between the collecting of intelligence and the final version of officially adopted estimates. Instead of starting from the facts, official estimates start from some wishful doc- trine, such as Henry A. Kissinger's popular, but fraudulent insistence Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 EIR Special Report/Global Showdown that \"the Soviet empire is crumbling.\" Facts which can be arranged to support such wishful views are arranged accordingly; facts which directly contradict those views vanish mysteriously during the process of writing and editing the official estimates. Senior officials grumble, stating privately that the official estimates are so much garbage, while complaining that they are obliged to work in support of currently official estimates which they know to be willfully falsified. This problem is most acute in Britain, the U.S.A., and France. In the U.S.A., policy is written in the U. S. State Department, and the U.S. military and intelligence services are instructed not to circulate reports which might offend the State Department. In Britain, the Es- tablishment rules, to similar effect. Everywhere, diplomacy and the \"arms- control mafia,\" dictate policy and strategic perception to both government and to credulous parliamentarians, including the present majority of the U. S. Congress. Those old enough, compare the present situation to the days of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, and the popularity of Ber- trand Russell's peace movements of the 1938 period. Today, as in the days of Adolf Hitler's march to war, the Allied governments and political parties are once again sleeping. The slogan in most of official Washington today, is \"Don't annoy me with facts; my mind is already made up for me.\" For obvious reasons, this report has been designed as the strategic assessment which should be available to every military and intelligence official and member of Congress, the report which should be available, but which government so far fails to produce. In this form, it is also the form of report which every thinking and influential citizen must possess now, to help him or her in shaping the selection and policies of admin- istration officials and members of Congress. Many senior military and intelligence officials, individually, will be delighted with this report, and will hope that the circulation of the report helps to blow the lid off the absurd, official estimates presently circulating. Yet, officially, those officials probably will be ordered to disassociate themselves from support for this report. Privately, they will agree, en- thusiastically; officially, probably, they will appear to stay in line with currently official policy, methods, and procedures. Such are the bureau- cratic practices in official Washington, today, by which officials advance and protect their careers, by appearing to \"stay in line\" with policies which they know privately to be absurd and violently contrary to the most vital interests of the United States. It is the unfortunate reality of political processes in the United States today, that good intelligence can be supplied only through private chan- nels, such as EIR. So, by filling part of that vacuum, EIR has developed as what more than one official has described as \"one of the world's best private intelligence services.\" This report is much more than a quality publishing effort; it is the fulfillment of our implicit duty, as both world- citizens and patriots, to aid in the defense of Western civilization, against the menacing new Genghis Khans of the Soviet imperial forces. As to the quality of this report, there are features of the report, on monetary, economic, and political policy, which are legitimately debat- able, on condition that the debate is a serious and thoughtful one. There can be no legitimate opposition either to the array of facts, or to the general strategic estimate presented. It is the best picture of the strategic threat currently available from any published source.

The Two Qualitative Facets of Soviet Strategic Mobilization Under the Operational Ogarkov Plan At present, the Soviet Union is in a full-scale pre-war mobilization, with the objective of acquiring all capabilities needed to survive and win a full-scale thermonuclear-led assault against the United States, according to the Ogarkov Doctrinal War-Plan, by approximately 1988. The eco- nomic mobilization in progress is best characterized as an overlay of two complementary general policies. These two, overlain, policies we have designated as Plan A and Plan B, respectively. Plan A, signifies the aspect of the current economic mobilization gov- erned by a Soviet version of \"systems analysis,\" the portion of the mo- bilization based on mobilization policies of practice in place prior to 1983. Plan B, signifies a new dimension of Soviet mobilization policy, which was made visible in Soviet war-planning during the 1983-84 period, and has been implemented on a massive and accelerating scale immediately following General Secretary Gorbachov's installation in office. Fairly described, Plan B represents a virtual revolution in Soviet economic policy of practice. The intent of its addition, is to forestall any U.S.A. move to a \"crash program\" method of implementation of the Strategic Defense Initiative. It introduces to Soviet practice, \"science-driver crash-program\" methods of rapid technological upshifting of Soviet production in general. What we have named Plan B, is based significantly on Moscow's ex- haustive study and monitoring of the writings of U.S. economist Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. As far as we are able to determine thus far, this monitoring of LaRouche is centered within the Soviet Academy of Sci- ences. The Soviets fear that the Reagan administration might adopt the reforms in economic policy proposed by LaRouche and his associates. Soviet planners associated with Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov and General Secretary Gorbachov, are purging the Soviet apparatus of the so-called \"Brezhnev Mafia,\" at an accelerating rate, in the effort to bring a Soviet imitation of LaRouche's \"crash program\" doctrine into effect. The relevant Soviet strategic estimate is broadly as follows. Option A: If the United States continues the monetary, economic, and defense-budget policies now in force, by 1988, the Soviet empire Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 will have the degree of strategic superiority needed to launch, sur- vive, and win a general \"first strike\" assault against the United States with degrees of losses acceptable to the Soviet command, on con- dition that the U.S.A. does not adopt a \"launch on warning\" doc- trine. For this case, Plan A is sufficient for Soviet war-economy mobilization. Option B: However, in the case, that the United States not only adopts \"launch on warning,\" but also unleashes those changes in monetary, economic, and budgetary policies needed for implemen- tation of an SDI \"crash program,\" Plan A would fail. If the Soviets knew, that the U.S.A. had adopted a \"launch on warn- ing\" doctrine, then a Soviet \"first strike,\" a crucial feature of the maximum option under the Ogarkov Plan, would not be possible as early as 1988. At the earliest, Soviet \"first strike\" would be postponed to the 1990s, awaiting the deployment of a more advanced generation of Soviet BMD than is projected for deployment by approximately 1988. If Soviet ability to survive and win a general war is postponed from the 1987-89 interval to the 1990-92 interval, as U. S. \"launch on warning\" would tend to have this effect, and if the U. S. also turns to a \"crash program\" implementation of SDI, Soviet Plan A war-economy mobili- zation would be disastrous for Moscow's ambitions. On this account, the Soviet planners are introducing Plan B rapidly and most forcefully at this time. The relevant Soviet fear is: the cultural resistance to rapid technological program within much of the Soviet population, often labelled the \"peasant problem\" in Soviet production, would mean that even a scientifically inferior United States could outpace the Soviet economy technologically under the condition that the U.S.A. changed its present monetary and economic policies in the manner required for transforming the SDI into a \"crash program.\" The Soviets are deathly fearful of the projected rate of increase of U. S. economic and technological prowess under revival of precedents of the 1939-43 mobilization and the pre-1966 phase of the U. S. aerospace program, a U. S. return to \"pre-McNamara\" defense pol- icies. Therefore, the current Soviet push to activate Plan B. On the surface, Plan B takes the form of a massive purge of Soviet bureaucrats, to appoint industrial managers who are committed to forcing Soviet workforces to accept very high rates of adaptation to technological progress. This takes the form most visible from the scope and depth of the current barrage of policy-statements from the highest levels in Mos- cow, of introducing the managerial methods of the Soviet's high-tech- nology military industries, especially the aerospace and nuclear sectors, into the management of firms generally. Samples of recent Soviet policy-declarations to this effect are cited below. Included in the Appendices of this Special Report, is a reprint of Lyndon LaRouche's keynote address of June 15, 1985, on the principles of \"science-driver crash programs,\" to the Krafft Ehricke Memorial Con- ference of the Schiller Institute. That address summarizes the methods by aid of which, the United States could transform the SDI's imple- mentation into a \"crash program,\" the methods which the Soviets fear and seek to emulate. Soviet administration has been long familiar with certain important features of successful \"crash programs.\" Soviet knowledge and past practice of \"crash programs\" depended greatly on captured documents and veterans Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 of the German Peenemunde Projects. The Soviets employed thousands of veterans of those Projects; without these captured German scientists and engineers, the postwar aerospace and thermonuclear-fusion accom- plishments of the Soviet military would not have been possible. The grafting of captured German science and scientists, onto Pasteur Institute- trained Academician Vernadsky's Atom Project, identifies the essence of Soviet knowledge and experience in this connection. Soviet interest in LaRouche's work is twofold. On the one count, President Reagan's March 23, 1983 announcement of an SDI policy congruent with LaRouche's earlier specifications, came at a time that leading Democratic Party circles had solemnly assured Moscow, that the President was efficiently blocked from taking such action. Consequently, Moscow exaggerated greatly LaRouche's influence on the President, to the degree Moscow worked together with its U.S. collaborators, including NBC-TV and the Anti-Defamation League, to orchestrate early 1984 demands that the President publicly distance him- self from LaRouche. More generally, and more accurately, Moscow recognized that La- Rouche's work as an economist had opened up new dimensions of insight into the causal relationship between scientific progress and increases of economic growth-rates. Obviously enough, although LaRouche has pro- vided the first successful theory for such programs, successful \"crash pro- grams\" existed long before the circulation of LaRouche's discoveries. The existence of a competent theory of \"crash programs\" is merely an im- portant, and very practical advancement in present-day knowledge. Al- though Moscow lists \"LaRouche\" as a \"dangerous principled adversary,\" whom it wishes to destroy, this is not the first time that Moscow sought to learn as much as possible from those it seeks to destroy. Moscow hates LaRouche on another relevant count. In analyzing Mos- cow's explosive rejection of the President's offer of March 23, 1983, LaRouche and his collaborators, beginning May 1983, published docu- mentation of the Soviet political-philosophical outlook which caused this particular form of response. This documentation of the Soviet imperial doctrine of \"Third Rome,\" is summarized in this report, below. Much as it hates the publication of this documentation, Moscow knows better than any other authority, that this documentation and the associated evaluations offered, are absolutely correct. LaRouche et at. have, in other words, revealed some of the innermost \"family secrets\" of the Soviet ruling class (the Nomenklatura) to Moscow's adversaries. This public exposure, the Soviets hate. Yet, Moscow recognizes that LaRouche et al. have put their index fingers on the kernel of the economic and administrative problems of the Soviet empire, the so-called \"peasant problem.\" This touches one of the most important facts about the character and internal problems of Soviet society, facts which most official U.S. in- telligence agencies and private think-tanks usually ignore, and sometimes deny to exist. This Special Report presents essential background on the point in a later section. We refer now only to as much as is indispensable for understanding what we have named Soviet Plan B. Briefly. We of Western Europe and the Americas, have inherited a cultural tradition, the Augustinian Judeo-Christian tradition, which is in every way vastly superior to the Byzantine tradition in Russia and other Byzantine-dominated sectors of Eastern Europe. As part of this, because our tradition places the emphasis in all matters on the creative- scientific and related potentialities of the individual human mind, and locates individual merit in the fostering of scientific and technological Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 EIR Special Report/Global Showdown progress, the Augustinian heritage supplies society with a vastly superior potential for not merely new and profound scientific discoveries, but also for rapid adoption of the technological benefits of those discoveries in production and other leading features of daily practice of the society as a whole. Although the heritage of classical Greek language and culture within the Eastern Roman Empire, is essentially the same as the Augustinian current of Western European culture, the open conflict between Western and Eastern Europe since the time of Charlemagne, is the deep root of the East-West conflict in Europe and the Mediterranean ever since. For example. Russia itself is a Byzantine creation. \"Rus\" is a Swedish name for the various tribes subjugated by the Scandinavian Varangians, Varangians who were themselves clients of Byzantium, the same Scan- dinavians deployed by Byzantium against Charlemagne's order and against the British Isles as part of Byzantium's efforts to obliterate Western Eu- ropean Christendom. The characterization of the Soviet state as \"Marxist,\" is essentially an absurdity. The truth begins to be clear, once we examine the so-called \"socialist\" reforms of the Emperor Diocletian, the Diocletian who was the patron of Constantine, and who shifted the seat of the Roman Empire to the East. If we compare the organization and philosophical outlook of Soviet society today with the form of \"socialism\" imparted to Byzantium by the Diocletian reforms, and study this connection in the light of the history of Eastern Europe since Cyril and Methodius, Russian \"socialism\" is more than 1,000 years old. So, today's Soviet ruling class views history. The Soviets see Moscow as the successor to the cities of Rome and Constantinople, as the capital of a world-empire, and consciously, explicitly trace the precedents for the planned Russian world-empire to such Mesopotamian precedents as the Persian Empire. The Soviet ruling class, the Nornenklatura, is a ruling bureaucracy in the tradition of the collections of families composing the ruling bureaucracies of the Roman and Byzantine empires; it is a bu- reaucracy modelled on the Roman legions' military cult of Mithra, under Augustus and his successors. It is a society ruled by a triad of bureaucracy, military, and recently reemergent Russian priesthood. Soviet ideology is \"oriential socialism,\" in that specific sense: the imperial socialism of an empire ruled by one \"superior race,\" the \"Great Russians\" of Muscovy. In Russian history, eastern and western Europe are political and re- ligious divisions of Europe dating essentially from Charlemagne, as mod- ified after Charlemagne by the extension of Catholic influence into Poland. In Russian history, Poland, Bohemia, Croatia, and to a lesser degree Hungary, mark the intrusions of Western Christendom into the domain of eastern Europe. The conquest of Western Europe, through making Germans the satrapal pawns of Soviet imperial influence, and the de- struction of the power of the United States, is the essence of Soviet strategic outlook today. This perspective on Germany's role as a Soviet client-state, has been explicit Soviet strategic doctrine since the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. On this account, the modern form of the strategic conflict between eastern and western Europe dates from the 1439-40 A. D. Council of Florence, at which time Muscovy became the bastion of eastern coun- teroffensive against the Augustinian doctrines affirmed at that Council of Florence. Any contrary view of the strategic issues, is superficial to the point of converging upon absurdity. This cultural foundation of Soviet strategic outlook has been a perpetual Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 crisis inside Russia since the rise of the Romanovs. Repeatedly, enlight- ened Russian leaders, such as Peter the Great, Alexander II, Count Witte, and Lenin, have emphasized, that Russia could not become a world- power without assimilating Western science and technology to a large degree. Yet, the introduction of Western science and technology collides directly and bloodily with a \"Russian peasant soul,\" a \"peasant soul\" which embodies the characteristic features of an Eastern, anti-Western religious and philosophical outlook. Consequently, for Russia to become a world-power, either Western European culture must destroy itself from within (as we have done to a large degree since the middle 1960s launching of the \"post-industrial countercultural shift\"), or the Russian population must be induced to accept a large degree of \"cultural paradigm-shift,\" bringing the intrinsically inferior Russian culture up to the level of the hated Western European culture. The result of this conflict is the schizophrenia exhibited by the plans of the Russian \"Nazi,\" Fyodor Dostoevsky, for establishing a Russian \"Third Empire\" (\"Third Reich\"). Dostoevsky, much like Hitler, saw the need to combine Russian-style mystical irrationalism with the apparatus of a military-industrial power developed in Siberia. Marshal Nikolai Ogar- kov expresses the same conflict today. He is fairly characterized, as the equivalent of a mad Dostoevsky who has nonetheless qualified as an honors graduate of the Prussian General Staff: militarily super-rational, but also mystically irrational. So, one might say of the presently ruling Suslov-Andropov dynasty in Moscow: They are the reincarnation of the Brothers Karamazov, with a nineteenth-century Prussian General Staffs attention to military-industrial thoroughness. The prospect of a U. S. \"crash program\" implementation of the SDI, brings this underlying conflict within Soviet society to a most acute form. They can not match the U.S.A. to the degree their strategic perspective requires, unless they rudely confront the \"peasant problem\" in production, unless they confront directly cultural hostility to rapid rates of techno- logical progress in methods of production, a hostility which is endemic in the \"Russian soul.\" Hence, their rage against the SDI is of a fury comparable to the most violent propaganda of the World War II period. A \"crash program\" implementation of SDI obliges Moscow to impose a key aspect of Western European values upon the Soviet population in general. In terms of the present institutions of Soviet society, this means a resumption of the methods of the Stalin period. We restate this very important point. From the time of the Swedish (Varangian) creation of Russia (Rus) out of assorted primitive tribes, until the rise of the Romanovs, the Russian priesthood was Greek in name and Byzantine in culture. The efforts of the Romanovs to orient Russia's cultural development toward Western Europe, unleashed a violent backlash by the forces of the \"Old Believers\" (Raskolniki), the mystical, anti-Westernizing forces centered around, and steered by, the Russian monks linked to Mount Athos. These Raskolniki revolts, which reached a peak of bloody confrontation during the period of Peter the Great, persisted in such later forms as the famous Pugachov insurrection, the Russian terrorist and other populist insurgencies against Czar Alexander II, and the Russian Revolution of 1917. V. I. Lenin himself, stated his recognition of the fact, that the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 was to a large degree a revival of the Pugachov insurrection of the eighteenth century. The most concentrated form of the issue, separating East from West, is the East's rejection of the \"individual soul\" as Augustinian Judeo- Christian culture defines the \"individual soul.\" The East believes in the Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 \"collective soul\" shared among the persons belonging to a specific body of common \"blood and soil.\" In Western Europe, the Dostoevskyian \"blood and soil\" and \"Third Roman Empire\" dogmas of the Nazis, are the best known and simplest illustration of the echoes of Russian ideology into the West. So, as Hamilton's anti-Adam Smith American System of political economy typifies this policy, we in Western European culture place em- phasis of merit upon the individual person's commitment and capacity to discover and to implement advances in science and technology. Eastern European culture places the emphasis of merit on \"traditional ways\"; Eastern European culture has a mystical hatred of technological progress, which it tends to regard as sacrilege against the local \"blood and soil's\" choice of mother-earth-goddess. Here lies the most immediate cause for the bloody violence which erupts in Russia, whenever one faction attempts to \"impose\" rapid rates of technological progress upon the Russian people generally. It must never be forgotten, in such conflicts, both factions are equally \"Russian.\" Even among the pro-technology factions, only a fraction is morally and philosophically committed to scientific and technological progress; the factions rallied behind the cause of technological progress have been dominated by those who adopt such progress with moral reluctance, as a strategic imperative of the East-West conflict. Fyodor Dostoevsky's writings on this role of technological progress, offer a most convenient insight into the implications. The pro-technology factions subordinate their blind instinct against technological progress to known strategic imperatives; the more ignorant Russian masses resist technology with the force and dedication of that same blind instinct. The result is bloody violence, bloody repression of one Russian faction by the other. The oriental mysticism and romantic sentimentality, which is the Russian character under other circumstances, assumes among all factions the form which mysticism and romantic sentimentality always assume when en- ergized by irrationalist rage. Partly, they hate the SDI because it spoils their plans of imperial conquest; this is the rational component of Soviet babbling against \"mil- itarization of space.\" More profoundly, they hate the SDI, because they regard its implementation as forcing them to return to Stalinist methods of mobilization of the Soviet labor-force as a whole. They see themselves so forced, because they are absolutely committed to a war-winning margin of military superiority over the United States; as Soviet officials have said publicly, repeatedly, during recent years, they can not accept strategic equality with the United States; they must have absolute superiority. In face of even a modest rate of development of the U.S. SDI, the gaining of absolute Soviet military superiority means a Soviet war mobilization which is massive not only in scale, but also massive in terms of rates of forced technological progress. Recent changes in the levels of understanding of \"crash programs\" The economic among leading circles of the Soviet Academy of Science, are based chiefly science of Soviet on accelerated studies of the economic writings of LaRouche over a known period of approximately 15 years. Although the evidence available is war-plan `Option B' fragmentary, and the conclusions legitimately drawn from that evidence necessarily limited in scope, the evidence demanding certain broad but extremely important evaluations is conclusive in nature. It is based on an accumulated pattern of actions by highest level Soviet and East-bloc institutions since 1971-72. Initially, during the 1968-70 interval, Soviet institutions viewed Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 LaRouche and his associates as a novel and potentially important phe- nomenon, to be explored, to determine whether this phenomenon could be penetrated and played to Soviet advantage. Soviet-deployed \"sleepers\" were sent into LaRouche's environment. Approximately 1971, East Ger- many-controlled (\"Stasi\") operations under Soviet direction launched a series of operations aimed at destroying LaRouche's influence in Western Europe and disrupting LaRouche's associations in the Americas. These Stasi operations were run during 1972-74 in conjunction with the Palme- Brandt faction of the Socialist International, and elements of British intelligence, including the London Tavistock Institute, which were then and now heavily penetrated by Soviet intelligence. As early as 1974, it was indicated by Soviet officials, that these operations were run with knowledge and direction from the highest levels of the Soviet command. The most recent phase of Soviet-directed operations against LaRouche and his associates was launched during April 1983, on decisions made at the level of then Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko; most of the remaining \"sleepers\" assigned to penetrate the association were ac- tivated for counter-operations against LaRouche, and a massive campaign by leading elements of the Soviet news-media was launched, from spring 1983 into spring 1984, together with leading Soviet fellow-travelers in the U. S. news-media, Democratic Party, and elsewhere. Soviet estimates of the work of LaRouche and his associates as \"very dangerous\" and as a \"principled adversary,\" center around the estimate by highest levels of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, that LaRouche's own work in economic science represents an important new development in economic science, and is at the same time the most competent analysis of the U.S. and Western economies currently available. On this account, chiefly, LaRouche is officially described in the Soviet news-media as the \"ideologue of late-capitalism.\" Excerpts of 1983-85 Soviet statements on LaRouche and his associates, are supplied in the Appendices. In the lexicon of Soviet dogma, \"ideologue of late-capitalism\" signifies the Soviet estimate, that economist LaRouche has presented a more or less comprehensive basis for reviving and saving the capitalist system. For example, at a recent, high-security Paris conference of world-wide Communist parties, June 12-13, 1985, Moscow reinstituted the old Com- munist International (Comintern). The featured theme of this confer- ence, was the Soviet presentation of the thesis, that the United States had entered a new general economic depression, which would be the \"final crisis of capitalism.\" Moscow assumes, that unless there is a sudden change in the monetary and economic policies of the OECD countries, the capitalist system is now in a \"final stage of collapse.\" Moscow views LaRouche's proposed reforms as a set of means for saving capitalism from collapse, and thus depriving Moscow of the delights of a \"final collapse of capitalism.\" Moscow considers LaRouche \"very dangerous,\" because it fears that LaRouche's proposed reforms are competent. Moscow views LaRouche's February 1982 proposal of what is now called the U. S. Strategic Defense Initiative, as both military competent, and also as a form of military- economic mobilization which could save the capitalism system through a new \"crash program\" like the 1939-43 war-economy mobilization under President Franklin Roosevelt. Soviet officials have stated, that they view LaRouche as philosophically a Catholic, whose criticisms of Marx's Capital from this vantage-point constitute the basis for a \"neo-capitalist\" revival. From Moscow's standpoint, LaRouche's work does in fact appear as a Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 EIR Special Report/Global Showdown rigorous critique of Marx's work from a Catholic philosophical standpoint, the standpoint of St. Augustine, Nicholas of Cusa, et al. From the Eastern standpoint in religion and philosophy, Western Christian traditions, excepting Gnostic tendencies introduced to Western churches, is the same thing to Russians as Catholicism in general; despite the doctrinal and related differences among Western European currents of Judaism, Catholicism and Protestantism, the common features of these currents are those which the Russians more or less accurately identify as Augus- tinian. Respecting economics, in Soviet Russia today, there are only two general currents of thought: more or less \"orthodox\" Marxism on the one side, and the post-1966 growth of Cambridge \"systems analysis\" on the other. LaRouche's axiomatic criticisms of Marx's errors define LaRouche in Russian eyes as a \"revisionist,\" to be debated from the standpoint of a more or less \"orthodox\" Marxism. However, the failures of Soviet systems analysis, and the failures of the econometricians of the West, have conditioned some among present-day Soviet circles to accept as \"scientifically legitimate,\" any criticism of Marx's economics on points Marx employs some of the same premises as the Cambridge systems analysts. Therefore, from the Soviet standpoint, if LaRouche's economics works, as they are inclined to believe it does, they hate LaRouche as much on this account as they hate his efforts to introduce the SDI to the military policies of OECD nations. The Soviets do not wish the Western nations to adopt any technology which might work to the strategic advantage of the Western alliances. Just as hatred of U.S. SDI does not prevent the Soviets from developing ballistic missile defense full-speed for their own forces, so, hatred of LaRouche's \"neo-capitalist\" economic science does not discourage the Soviets from studying and copying as much as might be to Soviet advantage. Present Soviet views on the exceptional competence of LaRouche's contributions to economic science, date from about 1980-81. Their at- tention was focussed on the fact that a first-approximation application of the LaRouche-Riemann Method, to computer-based economic fore- casting, had been consistently accurate, whereas all other Western fore- casting services of governments and private agencies alike, had been discredited by events. The Soviets, too, had employed \"Western\" systems- analysis methods for their economic forecasting, and these had failed just as the econometricians of the West had failed. It was the fact that the LaRouche-Riemann forecasts were computer-based, which particularly attracted Soviet attention during this period; they tend to be impressed more by mathematics than by principled issues of scientific method, and have an increasing fascination with computer technologies and their applications. It was the highest levels of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, especially the mathematics and physics sectors in the orbit of Academician Alek- sandrov, which manifested the greatest degree of concentrated interest in the LaRouche-Riemann Method. Naturally, the U.S.A. -Canada In- stitute and related sectors were also interested, but it was the mathematics and physics sectors which are known to have concentrated upon the detailed features of the Method itself. It has been clear, through statements by Aleksandrov and other rel- evant circles, since the close of the Brezhnev period, that during the process of consolidation of the factional position of Suslov's heirs of the currently ruling \"Andropov dynasty,\" Soviet policy-making has moved toward replacement of the old industries \"mafia\" by managerial cadres Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 from the military-industrial sector. The planning of purges to accomplish this was already adopted by spring 1982, purges delayed during the Cher- nenko period, set fully into motion immediately by Gorbachov's accession as party leader. The skyrocketting barrages of statements to this effect, by Aleksandrov and others, since March 1985, sampled in this Special Report, do not signify the sudden eruption of a newly formed policy: they are the unleashing of a policy already adopted no later than spring- summer 1982. There can not be a competent appraisal of the emerging \"Plan B\" aspects of current Soviet war-mobilization policy, without comparing ongoing shifts in Soviet policy with the central features of the published material on the LaRouche-Riemann Method. What the Soviets have been studying over the years, is most conveniently summarized in LaRouche's 1984 textbook in elementary mathematical economics, and in a series of articles appearing in the Executive Intelligence Review's weekly news magazine. From the standpoint of commonplace errors of assumption of U.S. econometricians, the most crucial points to be considered, in evaluating current directions in Soviet policies, are as follows. U.S. econometrics today, is immediately a combined by-product of the work of Professor Wassily Leontief, on input-output analysis, merged with the analysis of systems of linear inequalities which grew up through the influence of the late John von Neumann and Operations Research. The most important incompetencies of econometrics today are either explicitly or implicitly arrayed in von Neumann's and Morgenstern's Theory of Games & Economic Behavior. The first general error of modern econometrics, is the adoption of the notion of \"marginal utility,\" as this was developed, first, in Jeremy Ben- tham's \"felicific calculus,\" and elaboted on that basis by J. S. Mill, Jevons, and Marshall. This assumes that the relative price paid for an object or service converges statistically (ergodically) upon an equilibrium-price; it assumes that the only value to be considered in economics is the con- vergence of price, as a reflection of marginal utility, upon such an equi- librium-price, in an \"indefinitely extended n-person game.\" The second major fallacy, is that dogma introduced most authorita- tively by von Neumann, that the solution of all problems of analysis in economies, could be accomplished by stating input-output expressions of the Leontief type as systems of linear inequalities. The third, more subtle fallacy, is the analysis of economies solely in terms of changes in quantities and prices of inputs and outputs, without examining the impact on the economy of transformations internal to the processes of production as such. Consider the third of these fallacies first. It is easily shown, that military expenditures as such do not contribute to increase of the productivity of labor, and are not either producers' goods or households' goods. Therefore, it appears to be the case, that military expenditures constitute economic waste, simply a depressive tax upon the economy as a whole. Yet, throughout the nineteenth century, and twentieth century to date, the greatest rates of progress in per-capita wealth of economies have appeared as by-products of war-economy mobilizations! The recovery of the U. S. economy from the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the more recent 1959-66 recovery under mobilization of aerospace programs, are characteristic examples of this. Where lies the answer to this paradox? It lies in the fact, that war- economy mobilizations subsume mobilization of higher rates of techno- logical progress in weapons-systems and in investment in production for Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 producing weapons-systems. In this respect, war-economy mobilization forces rapid advances in investment in productive processes, in an energy- intensive, capital-intensive mode. The acceleration of technology of capital-goods production, and the spill-over of this advancement in cap- ital-goods technologies into production in general, causes rises in pro- ductivity in the non-military-goods sectors of production. In other words, any \"cost-benefit analysis\" treatment of merely the addition of military-output requirements to an economy, is intrinsically an absurd form of analysis. We must consider the technological impact of increases in military production upon the increase of productivities in the economy in general. In all cases, the primary thing to be considered, is not simply inputs and outputs as such. The most powerful impact upon an economy, is the impact of technological progress upon the process of production itself. Translate this into the language of Soviet strategic doctrine. In pre- viously established Soviet doctrine, Plan A doctrine, military production is treated as a drag upon the economy. Therefore, Plan A thinking reasons, if one power cranks up to full-scale war-economy mobilization, and a comparable opposing power does not, the weakening of the first power by such war-economy mobilization can be compensated only by either victorious warfare or other capitulation by the opposing power. If Plan B follows the LaRouche-Riemann Method on this point, then the power whose war-economy mobilization is at the higher technological level, can sustain such a mobilization indefinitely, constantly gaining in margin of economic advantage over the other. In economic terms, a full-scale war-economy mobilization, is a source of cumulative economic superi- ority, not weakening, on condition that the principle of a \"science-driver\" variety of \"crash program\" is adopted. There lies the practical implication of the difference between Plan A and Plan B. There lies the feature of recent and current Plan B-type Soviet policy-statements, which must have first rank in evaluations. In other words, if Soviet policy follows Plan A, the likelihood of warfare is at the greatest during approximately 1988. At that point, the Soviet war-economy mobilization will have peaked, and the religious mobili- zation leading into the 1988 celebrations will also have peaked. According to a version of Soviet strategic doctrine based on Plan A, the Soviet Union must launch a full-scale war against the United States by ap- proximately 1988. After 1988, according to Plan A reasoning, the relative advantage to the Soviets will erode at an accelerating rate, unless NATO military capabilities and economies collapse of their own weight. What, then, if the U.S. shrewdly focuses upon Soviet ideology re- specting acceptable losses to the Soviet empire's Great Russian master- race, by adopting an operational policy of launch on warning, directed at Great Russia and choice Siberian targets? Even if the Soviets won the war otherwise, the losses associated with such victory become \"unac- ceptable.\" This buys the U.S.A. several years of postponement of Soviet attack, until, as we have already indicated, Moscow deploys a \"second generation\" quality of strategic ballistic missile defense. Assume also, that the U.S. revises its monetary and economic, as well as military- budget policies, to foster a general economic recovery and increased SDI expenditures. Under that condition, the logic of Plan A appears to be problematic for the Soviets. Against that contingency, Moscow is obliged to begin shifting rapidly from Plan A to Plan B. In that case, then 1988 is no longer a maximum point of relative strength for Moscow, but, rather, the date of maximum Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 strength is shifted to a later date, to a critical point during the early to middle 1990s. That critical point is rather simply defined. Let X, Soviet total ca- pability, be greater than Y, the total capability of the NATO alliance. Let the exponent of growth-rate for X be designated by \"a,\" and let \"a\" be less than the exponent of growth for Y, \"b.\" The point at which the absolute margin of growth of Soviet capability ceases to be greater than the absolute margin of growth for NATO capability, is a critical value. This is indicated better, by assuming, as is the normal case, that the growth-rate exponents \"a\" and \"b\" are not linear, and that \"b\" increases more rapidly than \"a\": In other words, a U.S. mobilization \"takes off' as did the 1939-43 mobilization. Once NATO's economies reach the critical value corresponding approximately to 1943, the rate of growth of NATO's power will accelerate relative to the rate of growth of the Soviets, on condition that the Soviets do not introduce an effective \"cultural paradigm-shift,\" away from deeply-embedded Eastern cultural matrices during that interval. Given, such broadly obvious distinctions between Plan A and Plan B varieties of policy-making, the practical question is circumscribed: How do we measure choices of investment in such a way as to obtain the optimal Plan B type of effect? The first step, is to throw away all \"systems analysis,\" and \"analysts\": Economies do not function in the mode implied by solutions to systems of linear inequalities; every decision based on such fallacious methods will be an absurd decision. Economic processes are characteristically \"non-linear.\" Restate the practical question: How can we calculate the estimated increases of growth of productivity resulting from a choice of investment in improved technology? This obliges us to discard every British, Swiss, and Viennese economist, from the Physiocrat Quesnay, through Smith, Bentham, Malthus, Ricardo, Marx, the Mills, Walras, Say, Pareto, Mar- shall, Keynes, Friedman, Hayek, and so forth. We must return to the source of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton's American System of political-economy, the establishment of economic science by Gottfried Leibniz. LaRouche's principled contribution to economic science, centers around his improvement in Leibniz's definition of \"technology,\" an improvement based on the work of Karl Gauss, Dirichlet, Weierstrass, Riemann, and Cantor. From this standpoint, the measure of increase of productivity and the military criteria of increases of firepower and mobility, have a precise mathematical correlation. This correlation is based upon a math- ematical measurement of technology, a measurement accomplished by resituating Leibniz's original definition of technology within a Rieman- nian hyperspherical function: In other words, the notions associated with synthetic-geometrical construction of a Riemann Surface. This is indi- cated within LaRouche's elementary mathematical-economics textbook, as amplified in such published sources as his EIR items on \"Artificial Intelligence\" (May 14, 1985) and exposing the fallacies of Leontief's featured piece in the June 1985 Scientific American (EIR, June 10, 1985). `Crash program' methods The general theory of \"science-driver\" forms of \"crash programs,\" is out- lined in the Krafft Ehricke memorial address included in the Appendices. A few supplementary remarks, echoing the discussion period during that Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 EIR Special Report/Global Showdown conference, are most appropriate here, as bearing upon evaluation of those features of Soviet policy which coincide with, or tend to coincide with, Plan B. In ordinary scientific research, scientists construct instruments for ex- perimental work, chiefly, in collaboration with tool-makers skilled in development work. This used to be accomplished, chiefly, in machine shops associated with university and other laboratories, until the foolish introduction of line-item budgeting of such work, such that experimental work is usually delayed by months or years, while the scientists seek to win authorization for a line-item budget from among various govern- mental or private-grants institutions. These silly methods of budgeting have been one of the more important brakes against scientific progress, especially over the recent quarter-century since the Hoover Commission's proposed increase in the bureaucratization of government. A weapon is essentially a scientific instrument adapted for military usage; so is a new type of machine-tool. Let us imagine that we take two steps. First, we junk the line-item budgeting of scientific research, and return to the sensible practice of budgeting only the staffing and equipping of the research-institution as a whole, and not the detailed activities within it. Second, for purposes of military development, we supply sci- entists with use of budgeted sections of generalized production-capacity in the economy as a whole. In this second feature, we budget only the indicated portions of capacity as a whole, and budget the use of these portions of capacity only for a species of materials or instruments, rather than some specified material or instrument. For example. The SDI is most usefully defined as based upon a complex of species of technologies, species which are assorted as a whole into two general classifications, primary and auxiliary. The primary classes are controlled high-energy plasma-reactions, coherently directed beams, and optical biophysics. The auxiliary technologies, are those required to de- liver, aim and fire the primary technologies. On this basis, we know in advance, at least in practice, the kinds of materials and instrumentation we shall require for yet-unspecified kinds of applications of these tech- nologies. What we wish to avoid, is the situation in which our scientists prove that a certain sort of instrument for military uses can be produced, but in which we do not have available the kinds of production facilities needed to produce the materials and instruments this design requires. Therefore, we assign manufacturers to allot some comer of their total capacity, to mastering the production of one or more of the varieties of materials or instruments we shall require. In other words, once we have determined the need for a specific sort of material or instrument, we have a working group in some industry qualified to work up a material or instrument to the level of specifications required. Once we have produced a prototype of some instrument, we use the the lessons we have learned in producing the materials and instruments for that prototype, to launch expanded general production of such ma- terials and instruments. That is the first-approximation of a \"science driver\" variety of \"crash program.\" What we have done, in such a case, is to expand the instru- ment-making resources of the scientific laboratory, beyond the scope of the machine-shop attached to that laboratory, to the effect of making production as a whole increasingly the machine-shop in which scientific research works. This is key to understanding the reasons that such a \"crash program\" Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 takes the form of an accelerating rate of growth in quality and scale, from initially small beginnings. This process subsumes a spread of new materials, instruments, and skills, from the initial interface between scientists and corners of pro- duction, into production more generally. This is the \"spill over\" of the new technologies into production generally. In other words, the \"spill over\" does not occur in the form of taking completed new designs from the isolated laboratory into production; the \"spill over\" is organic, is the effect of increasing the relative scale of production directly under the influence of the combined fundamental research and development work of scientific teams, by integrating manufacturing with laboratories en- gaged in fundamental research. In this way, scientific research directly transforms the processes of production, in an energy-intensive, capital-intensive mode. This impact is mediated chiefly through the tool-making aspect of capital-goods pro- ducing, such that the rate of increase of productivity tends to be in proportion to the capital-intensity of investment in production generally. This rarely occurs in larger-scale private manufacturing firms, even technology-intensive firms. Something like it tends to occur more fre- quently among newly formed small firms, created by scientists and en- gineers motivated more by a passionate commitment to a scientific principle than to precalculable rates of profit. It occurs, otherwise, only through commitment of governments, either in warfare or preparations for warfare, in which the risk of losing war, or the cost of unacceptable levels of warfare damage, outweigh the ordinary considerations of precalculable profitability. This behavior of private entrepreneurs is ultimately very silly. There has never been a case in modem history of industry, that a new scientific principle was not most generously profitable, provided sufficient breadth and professional staffing of the investment were supplied. Expressed in terms of statistics, it ought to be U. S. policy, that the employment for research and development in physical and biological technologies ought to be about 10% of the total employment of the labor-force, perhaps 15%. If this investment in employment were made, adequately supported, and utilized, the resulting rate of increase of productivity of the labor- force as a whole would exceed the highest rates in modern history. The result would be, that the economy functioned in something like a \"sci- ence-driver\" \"crash program\" mode all of the time. However, with rare exceptions, practice in that direction occurs only under the pressure of perceived military expediencies. This is the direction in which Plan B aspects of current Soviet policy are moving. Technically, from the standpoints of both physics and eco- nomic science, those efforts portend the highest rates of economic growth in the Soviet Union so far. The impediments to such an effort are chiefly cultural, as we have indicated here already, cultural impediments with potentially profound political implications for Soviet society as a whole. In the meantime, we must assume that the acceleration of Soviet urgency and confidence in its military imperatives, will overwhelm the cultural opposition, such that cultural resistance may impede success, but not prevent it entirely. Our remarks on the nature and theory of a Plan B approach, here, should not be taken to imply that the Soviets are fully committed to the theory of practice which we have outlined here, nor are we estimating the probable net result of opposing cultural resistance and present efforts to force through a \"science driver\" approach. Our task here, is to alert Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 EIR Special Report/Global Showdown readers to this important aspect of current Soviet policy of practice, and to insist that existing U. S. governmental studies of the Soviet war-plans and economy must be replaced by methods appropriate to the close study of both Soviet policy and shifting Soviet capabilities. All those who echo Henry A. Kissinger, in babbling the falsehood, that the \"Soviet empire is crumbling,\" and so forth, should be disregarded or jailed, as proper statutes may prescribe for such cases. Soviet society is by no means \"crumbling\"; it is the NATO alliance which is already crumbling, as we note in such cases as recent developments in Greece and Scandinavia, and the threat that Willy Brandt's Soviet-allied Social- Democratic forces might come to power in Germany, and pull Germany rapidly out of the U. S. alliance. There are sources of troubles inside the Warsaw Pact, and in Soviet society itself. Soviet society is inherently a very violent society, whose culture prescribes periodic convulsions. Plan B efforts will increase the potential for such convulsions, as we have indicated. However, the likelihood that either the Warsaw Pact or Soviet society itself will begun to crumble internally very soon, is so small as to be almost non-existent under present conditions. NATO threw away national-independence potentialities in Eastern Europe repeatedly: Germany 1953, Hungary and Poland in 1956, Berlin 1961, and Czechoslovakia 1968. The classical counteroffensive policy for Soviet attack through East Germany, to sweep into Poland and declare the national sovereignty of that nation's existing government, is not a practical alternative in the present correlation of forces. True, assuming that the Soviet empire was extended to domination of the nominally independent satrapies of today's Western Europe, as well as the Middle East, the Soviet empire must crumble eventually, as all oligarchical empires of the form of the Mesopotamian models have crumbled internally in the past. Those who speak wishfully of such as early-future prospects, under present correlations of forces, are doubly dangerous, as they sow Neville Chamberlain-like complacency among us, and prompt the Soviets to desire war more urgently, as the alternative to Western meddling in the internal order of Eastern Europe. In the present term, our attention to troubles within the Soviet empire must be less wishfully ambitious, more precise, and more practical. It is important to watch closely the frictional impulses of cultural and policy conflicts, impulses not likely to cause the Soviet empire to crumble during the forseeable future, but impulses which will affect greatly the way in which Soviet policy and performance shift marginally during the period ahead. The cultural and policy conflicts arising in the overlay of Plan A and Plan B are the best choice of benchmark for such observations and analysis.

Soviet military strategy, extending back to Sokolovskii, prescribes that there can be no strategy for war without a strategy for a war economy. Without a sufficiently advanced economy, capable of being fully mo- bilized to meet the demands of the armed forces, it is impossible to wage modem war. This is the basic principle of the Soviet doctrine of war economy. As we shall document below, this emphasis on the economy and economic mobilization capability was one of the foundations of the work of Marshal V. D. Sokolovskii and his team which developed the elaborated Soviet strategy for fighting and winning a global thermonuclear war, published as the book Military Strategy in 1962. But it is also the foundation of the present Soviet strategy expounded by Marshal of the Soviet Union Nikolai Ogarkov-what we refer to in this report as the Ogarkov Doctrine. This documentation of Soviet statements on war economy will also make clear how and why the Soviet High Command under Ogarkov was instrumental in bringing to power the Andropov Dynasty for the specific purpose of completing the crucial final preparations for victory in World War III. In Ogarkov's most extensive public version of his war strategy, a 1982 booklet entitled Always Ready to Defend the Fatherland, he identified the following dilemma for the Soviet planners of offensive nuclear war. In World War II, only a tiny fraction-perhaps as little as 10%-of all of the economic resources expended in combat had been produced before the war started. The other 90% were produced in the enormous economic mobilization carried on during the course of the war. But that was World War II. Today, argue the Soviet military planners, a world war will almost certainly be much, much shorter. With ther- monuclear weapons of mass destruction, and intercontinental missiles as delivery vehicles, the war may be decided in the first few minutes or hours of war. If so, there will be no time to make up for what is lacking, for what is not already in place and deployable before the war ever breaks out. It is obvious, then, that the side which is capable of the maximum Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 EIR Special Report/Global Showdown pre-war economic mobilization will have enormous advantages over its adversary. However, here is where the problem arises. A maximum war mobilization is a state that cannot be maintained indefinitely. The max- imum war mobilization is like that at the height of World War II: In Soviet terminology, it is when \"the entire country has been transformed into a single camp of war, where everything and everybody goes for victory.\" And in the case of total, global war, the shorter it is, the more intense the mobilization must be. Nothing that might contribute to a margin of victory dare be left outside the mobilization, \"kept in reserve\" for some future that will never come unless victory is won. In other words, the dilemma is how to mobilize as much and as far as possible in peacetime, without overextending the mobilization so as to undermine the very basis of the economy and society. Ogarkov formulates the problem as follows: As we know, it is inefficient to maintain armed forces in peacetime in the same fully deployed conditions as will be required in the event of war. Economically, no state can afford to do this, nor is there any particular need to do so. For this reason, in our country under conditions of peaceful construction, as indeed in other countries, a certain portion of the armed forces are kept in a constant state of readiness, i. e., they have a full complement of personnel and military hardware, while the rest are ready for rapid mobilization. Hence, a high degree of combat-readiness of the troops is inconceivable with- out well-organized mobilization training, aimed at ensuring that they can be quickly converted from a peacetime to a war footing. If the aggressor unleashes a war, the trained personnel and combat-ready equipment assigned to formations and units have to be available on short notice, immediately. For this reason, the task of constant readiness for immediate mobilization of the troops, and early tran- sition of the armed forces and the entire national economy from a peacetime to a war footing, are of special and urgent importance to the state. ...The beginning and the course of World War II introduced further changes into the concept of mobilization, and to an even greater extent revealed the direct link which connected the mo- bilization and deployment of the armed forces with the transition of the entire economy to a war footing and the reorganization of the political, social, scientific, and other institutions of the state. The greater part of the economy and resources of the state were enlisted for the purpose of ensuring immediate war needs. It is sufficient to cite the following example. In the last war, around 90% of the material needs of the armed forces of the belligerent countries were provided by production which took place after the war had already begun, as a result of the mobilization of the economy. What emerged as the most important problems in this respect were the shortening of times for mobilization and ensuring that the economy could be converted to a war footing in a planned manner. In former wars, as we know, the question of mobilization was not so acute. The weapons systems which countries had at their disposal, and the relatively low degree of mobility and maneuverability of their troops, even in the case of a surprise attack, were essentially incapable of disrupting the mobilization of the army, and even less so of predetermining the course and outcome of the war. Under modem conditions, the situation has changed radically. The element of surprise played a definite role already in the Second Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 World War. But today it has become a factor of utmost strategic significance. The question of the early and rapid transition of the armed forces and the entire national economy onto a war footing, as well as that of their mobilization on short notice, has become a considerably more urgent matter. For this reason, providing the forces with trained manpower and combat-ready equipment, and the early transition of the economy to provide output according to wartime schedules, dictate the necessity of carrying out clear-cut, well-planned measures already in peacetime and of conducting co- ordinated action by party, soviet and military authorities locally. The full and qualitative fulfillment of all these measures will to a great extent determine the success of the organized entry of the armed forces into the war and the utter defeat of the aggressor. The Soviet solution To solve this dilemma of war economy mobilization, Soviet military strategy has developed a two-fold approach. 1) On the one hand, the military command must ensure at all times that economic decisions are taken with a view to a future war in mind. In other words, the mobilization will be extended backward, in advance of the outbreak of war, as far as possible, and be built up successively. This involves long-term measures of force development such as hardware, various defensive measures such as decentralization of vital industries and civil defense programs, and an overall direction of science and technology to benefit the defense sector. 2) Secondly, there will still be certain measures that must be \"saved for the last minute.\" These concern economic measures that simply cost too much to maintain constantly. This category includes certain infra- structural programs (construction of key rail lines and highways in areas of military importance that cannot be used economically), strategic stock- piling of perishable foods, conversion of plants for arms, etc. The general term the Soviets use for describing this approach to a war economy is that of building in a \"surge production capacity\" into the economy, i.e., on the basis of a \"normal\" level of war economy that can be sustained more or less indefinitely, the next step is to add a very specific program for a short-term massive shift and build-up. A.N. Lagovskii These aspects of the theory of war economy were elaborated already in the 1950s by Soviet strategists, most notably by the founder of the modem Soviet doctrine of war economy, A.N. Lagovskii. In 1957 then-Colonel Lagovskii was appointed as head of the newly-established Department of War Economy at the Soviet General Staff Academy. In that capacity, Lagovskii set up a curriculum for the subject as an on-going part of the work he was simultaneously doing in a group under the Chief of General Staff, Marshal of the Soviet Union V.D. Sokolovskii, to develop a new Soviet strategy for nuclear war. Lagovskii's elaboration of the theory of war economy was not only included in Sokolovskii's book, Military Strategy, but Lagovskii himself also wrote a separate textbook for the new curriculum. This textbook, entitled Strategiya i ekonomika (Strategy and the Economy), was published in 1957. With startling frankness, this 200-page book discusses 1) how the military high command (\"strategy\") has to take control of the economy Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 EIR Spec;l Report/Global Showdown and economic planning, 2) the vital issue of what must be done in peacetime to prepare for war, 3) a whole array of necessary measures to protect the Soviets' own economy, such as the building of strategic reserves, duplication of industries, building underground plants, etc., and 4) not least, how the high command must thoroughly map out the U. S. economy, including its weak and strong points, with conclusions about which industries can be influenced (destroyed) in peacetime, which ones will be prime nuclear targets, and which ones should be saved for later use by a victorious Red Army. The quotes below concentrate only on points 1) and 2), and even these are but a fraction of what Lagovskii states on these topics. But the following should indicate the essence of the modem Soviet strategy of war economy. An advanced economy is the precondition for victory Soviet military science has elaborated the far-reaching depen- dence of modem war on the economic factor. Without a sufficiently advanced economy, which can fulfil all the demands of the armed forces, it is impossible to wage war today. A strategic plan which oversteps the bounds of the country's economic potential will be an adventure. A strategy which lacks an adequate economic basis must necessarily fail. The military command must run the economy Today, as never before, strategy must systematically and thor- oughly investigate all scientific and technological achievements as well as [the nation's] economic potential... . However, as we know, potential is not yet reality. One has to know how to translate potential into reality, that is, one has to elaborate both a theory of war economy for war and carry out per- sistent efforts for the development of that economic potential... . ...In order to be able to meet [the] needs of the army and navy, the economy must, already in peacetime, prepare itself in all respects for the armed defense of the country. Strategy bears great responsibility for the economic preparation of the country for a war. Above all, it has to determine the needs of the armed forces for the initial period of the war. These needs must be constantly adjusted in accordance with the new potential offered by the progress of the national economy, the achievements of science and technology, the course of the process of force de- velopment and the new principles of military art. ... Strategy has to compare the economic potential of its own country with the estimated needs of the armed forces and, in the interest of national defense, determine the directions in which the various branches of industry must develop as well as the rate of development required to attain the required capacities. Strategy has to exert its influence on all economic problems which are connected with support of combat actions of the armed forces as well as their build-up in the period of preparation for war and during war. Strategy is duty-bound to advise the State in economic matters which bear upon the defense capability of the nation. Rapid mobilization of the economy One highly important factor in evaluating economic potential is the possibility of rapid mobilization of all branches of the economy for the needs of war and of far-reaching utilization of economic Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 reserves. Today, the strength of a nation is also dependent upon how long it takes to expand its economic potential in correspondence with the military-political situation... . The rapid and comprehensive mobilization of all economic re- serves is primarily dependent upon the economic system of a country. The main qualitative feature of the economic potential is the struc- ture and organization of the national economy. The socialist system of planned economy has in this respect great advantages over the capitalist economic system. Components of economic potential Let us once again summarize the most important elements of economic potential: the size of a country's population, taking into consideration its cultural level and political and moral state- the economic system; the capacity of heavy industry; the productivity of labor and its developmental trends; raw materials; import de- pendency; density and size of the transportation network; the level of development of agriculture and its areas of specialization; the time required for mobilization of all branches of the economy; the pos- sibility of utilization of economic reserves, and the state of the material reserves in the country. Modern wars represent a severe test for a country's economic potential. They reveal whether or not that potential is capable of providing the nation with all means that are necessary for successfully waging armed struggle. In the Great Patriotic War, the socialist economic system of the Soviet Union managed to rapidly convert the entire economic might of the state to meet the needs of war to annihilate the enemy. The experiences gathered in this war in the utilization of economic potential furnish valuable guidelines for as- sessing the potential of the Soviet Union in the event of a new war. They show the path toward further strengthening of the defense capacity of the Soviet homeland and toward the creation of a mighty foundation for the material and technology equipping and supply of the Soviet army. A constant investigation of the economic po- tential of our own country provides the military command with data on the means which can be placed at their disposal for carrying out combat actions, on the possible extent of combat actions in the initial period and in the later periods of the war, as well as the time at which strategic operations can be launched. A precise study of economic potential and the comparison of the economic potential of the country with the needs of the army in war, make it possible to take measures for the crash development of one particular branch of militarily vital production or for building new means of com- munications. The nation's economic potential has to be utilized even in peace- time as rationally as possible for the construction of the armed forces. Mobilization in peacetime ... For strategy, it is very important to elaborate its own rec- ommendations for the direction in which the economy should de- velop, so that the most favorable conditions for the mobilization of the armed forces and for their development and deployment, can be created. Therefore, strategy must, already in peacetime, exert its influence to prepare the economy in the manner required in case of war to supply the army and navy with everything it needs for armed struggle. Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 EIR Special Report/Global Showdown The composition of the means required for warfare must likewise be determined already in peacetime. In solving this highly respon- sible task, strategy plays the leading role. In the course of the war, military art can, on the basis of the experience its acquires, relatively quickly change its principles, and, similarly, the troops can relatively quickly implement new tactical methods and new demands on op- erational art. But things are different as far as the economy is con- cerned: Production facilities cannot react so quickly to the demands of the troops for provision with other war materiel and other ar- maments than the customary ones. The conversion of industry, even the partial conversion of the production program and the introduc- tion of a new technology, is a complicated matter that demands a great deal of time. For this reason, the means and methods of conducting a possible war have to be determined in time and carefully thought through in close connection with the potentials of the national economy and its perspectives. Here, too, we see one of the most important tasks of strategy. It has to foresee the course of development of warfare as well as the possible changes in the methods of warfare and hence the changes in the needs of the troops. Of course, strategy is not capable of of predicting all new demands of the armed forces in a long war. However, strategy is duty-bound to determine in advance the needs of the armed forces with respect to types and quantity of technical means and armaments for the initial period of the war, be it only a single year. This survey of the needs of the armed forces is necessary in order to determine the point at which the economic preparation of the country for the armed struggle should begin. Geographical distribution The geographical distribution of the productive forces and es- pecially that of heavy industry, the leading branch of the economy and the foundation of the defense capacity of the nation, is under present conditions of exceptional political, economic, and strategic importance. . . . Economic potential is the basis for conducting modem wars, and this potential is the main target for the enemy's armed impact on the rear... . Under present conditions, the individual parts of the advanced economic base, especially the industrial plants, must be distributed throughout the country in such a way as to provide the most favorable preconditions for production during the war. In setting up new plants, the question of their defense against air attack must always be taken into consideration. In determining the geographical location of an industrial facility, both economic and military interests have to be taken into account. Sometimes, eco- nomic interests have to take second priority if they run counter to strategic considerations... . .. The same production, the same component or machine must always be produced in more than one factory in more than one area. A product must always be produced in many different plants. Science and technology The furious development of science and technology have much to offer to modem armaments and can thereby influence the methods of conducting war. This is why strategy is interested in the successes of science and technology. If strategy is in a position of seeing far in advance, and if it does Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 not lag behind the economic development of the country, then the arming of the army can be rapidly developed. The level of devel- opment of science and technology today offers real possibilities, which occasionally are bigger than might have been foreseen some years ago. However, to move from the stage of prediction in the area of arms development to the design phase and from there to serial production, is a long road, often one that takes years. For this reason, it is important for strategy to be constantly up-dated with regard to the achievements of science and technology, in order to be able to utilize the latest developments in all areas of science for its purposes. But beyond that, strategy can and must also exert its influence to push scientific and technological research in directions that benefit the military. Under the conditions of the stormy development of science and technology, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to utilize the experience of the Second World War for a future war; this is why the ability of strategy to foresee the development of technical means of struggle, the build-up of the army and navy, and the methods of conducting armed struggle, take on increasingly greater importance. Labor power and labor productivity The early preparation of a complete inventory of labor power resources for the event of war is of great economic and military significance. Strategy is interested in completing the mobilization of the armed forces in a short period of time by drafting population contingents... . Strategy has to inform itself of one further factor which exerts substantial influence on the labor power requirements of the national economy, viz. the increase of the productivity of labor. This factor is important not only from the standpoint of an additional increase of goods of society, but also for supplying additional personnel to the armed forces. As is known, an increase in labor productivity means that less labor-time is needed for the production of a product, i.e., fewer workers are needed for the production of the same amount of products. The workers thereby freed from production may either- if the existing equipment so permits-be deployed to increase pro- duction of relevant products, or be assigned to different jobs, or in case of war, be drafted into the army or navy. Preparing the theaters of war The comprehensive preparation of the theaters of war is, under current conditions, a distinctive feature of the general war-prepar- edness of a country. Strategy is highly interested in this factor because it sees in it a necessary and important condition for the success of concentration and deployment of troops in the event of war, and for the success of initial military operations and perhaps even the entire campaign. On the extensive territories of future strategic fronts, that is, the potential theaters of war, various kinds of relations may develop among neighboring states in peacetime. For this reason, interna- tional relations are one of the most important elements in deter- mining the measures to prepare the scope and succession of work in the prospective theater of war. ... Such measures might include the establishment of a network of airfields, rail lines, highways, and pipelines, as well as the con- Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 EIR Special Report/Global Showdown struction of water routes for intensive traffic as well as the construc- tion of electricity plants and power lines... . ...The preparation of the theaters of war must in case of emer- gency be carried out to some extent \"at the expense of the general economic development of the territory... . In individual cases, military and economic interests may even diverge widely from one another. For instance, it is more advan- tageous to build one big electric power plant than several smaller ones. First of all, construction is cheaper, and secondly, the pro- duction costs of electricity produced in a large power plant are lower. However, this question has to be solved by looking at both the requirements of air defense and securing the needs of the troops, the national economy, and the population for electric power in war. From this standpoint, it may turn out in certain circumstances to be more expedient to build a network of small power plants which can be connected to the power grid of the relevant area. Often the interests of strategy and the economy can also diverge in the con- struction of transportation routes... . The military issues orders A comparison of our initial quotes from Marshal Ogarkov on economic mobilization with those from Lagovskii should illustrate the continuity of Soviet strategy for war economy from the 1950s until today. In the case of Ogarkov, there is a direct link. As a major-general in 1958, Ogarkov was in the first class to take Lagovskii's new course at the General Staff Academy. The book from which we have quoted above was the textbook Ogarkov used. In Ogarkov's writings in the 1980s, he draws on another aspect of Lagovskii and Sokolovskii: the immediate, urgent measures that have to be taken, in addition to long-term direction of the economy. Ogarkov writes in his 1982 booklet Always Ready to Defend the Fatherland: In the interests of raising the defense capacity of the country, it is more urgent than ever before that the mobilization of the armed forces be coordinated with the national economy as a whole, es- pecially in the use of human resources, transport, communications and energy, and in ensuring the reliability and survivability of the entire vast economic mechanism of the country. In this connection, there must be a constant effort to find ways to improve systems of cooperation among enterprises which produce the basic types of weapons, and to make them more autonomous with respect to energy and water supplies, provide them with necessary stocks, and create an equipment and materials reserve. Further improvement has to be made in the actual system of mobilization readiness of the national economy on the basis of the principle that a close interrelationship between the mobilization readiness of the armed forces, the national economy, and civil defense is the most important condition for maintaining the defense capacity of the country as a whole on the requisite level. The concentration of all forces to attain the goals posed, taking into account the extraordinarily changed conditions of modern war and the complexity of mobilization, is impossible without a reliable system of centralized leadership of the country and the armed forces. Our country has some experience in this respect. The State Defense Committee, as well as the defense e ommittees in the cities of the Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 front zone, which had been created in the years of the Great Patriotic War, proved their value to the full extent. In a modern war, should the imperialists unleash one against us, it goes without saying that we will require an even higher degree of concentration of leadership (command) and, obviously, not only in the front regions, as was the case during the past war. In this connection, a significantly greater role will also be played by the corresponding local agencies which in the event of war might have to head up all efforts connected with the solution of mobilization tasks and tasks of territorial defense, as well as with the implementation of measures such as civil defense and so forth. The year before Ogarkov graduated from the General Staff Academy, Colonel Semyon Kurkotkin had completed the same course of study. Today, Kurkotkin is a deputy defense minister and Chief of Rear Ser- vices-i.e., in charge of all logistics-for the U.S.S.R. Armed Forces, a post he has held since 1972. In March 1983, Kurkotkin was promoted by Yuri Andropov to Marshal of the Soviet Union. In fall 1984, only a few weeks after Ogarkov had personally taken charge of implementing the final phase of setting up the command structure for war against the West (see section 1.5), Kurkotkin wrote an article in the military daily Krasnaya Zvezda urging the same economic mobilization measures as Ogarkov had previously done. The article titled, \"The Experience of History and the Present Day: Economic Potential in Action,\" appeared in Krasnaya Zvezda, Oct. 19, 1984. ...The Great Patriotic War confirmed anew and with absolute conviction that the socialist planned economy, in combination with its scientific management, opens possibilities which no capitalist state has or can have. The socialist planned economy possesses a unique mobilization capability and survivability which permits it to react operationally to a changing situation and rapidly implement a reorganization. For instance, the transition of the German econ- omy onto a war footing took nearly six years, that of the U. S. about two years. Our country was able to carry out a mobilization of the economy in the course of a single year. . In the 1939-41 period the Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet Government adopted several important resolutions on questions of strengthening the defense capacity of the country. These included, for instance, decisions to convert existing and build new aircraft factories, and to produce T-34 tanks. As a result, the production capacity of our aircraft industry and of Soviet tank con- struction were nearly 1.5 times greater than the corresponding ca- pacities in Germany by the summer of 1941. Simultaneously with the development of the war industry, state reserves, and mobilization stocks of food and vital strategic materials were created at high rates. Thus, on the basis of the overall growth of economic potential, the material basis of national defense capacity was strengthened. This work was carried out in complete correspondence with Lenin's conclusion that without the most serious economic preparation, it is impossible to conduct a modem war. The economic potential of a state, once brought into play, be- comes the most important factor of victory in war, provided that it is utilized in a purposeful manner and with maximum efficiency. ...In the nearly four decades separating us from the end of the Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 EIR Special Report/Global Showdown Great Patriotic War, the economic and scientific-technological po- tential of the U.S.S.R. has grown many times over. ...The course of imperialism towards material preparation of a new world war and the sharply increasing threat of nuclear war on their part compel the Soviet Union to do everything necessary to further strengthen its defense capability. As a result of the measures that have been taken, the mobilization capability and the survivability of our economy are being raised. The planned, rational siting of productive forces is of utmost im- portance in this respect. The strengthening of our defense might is aided by the further development of existing, and creation of new, territorial-industrial complexes, the improvement of infrastructure, and its centralization on a nationwide scale. The economic preparation of the country to rebuff imperialist aggression calls, as is known, for the accumulation of strategic re- serves and the all-round development of all types of transportation. The improvement of the war economy potential and its efficient use, and close cooperation among the fraternal socialist countries on matters of war economy, are emerging as a particularly urgent problem. ...The significance of the transport sector in relation to the war economy is extraordinarily great. At the present time, the long- range orientation of its functioning is towards mechanization of loading and unloading operations and the introduction of advanced methods of freight transport. For instance, the introduction of con- tainerization and packetization will permit an increase in produc- tivity of labor by 3-5 times, free a large number of people, and cheapen transportation. Thus, at the very point when one element of the preparations for a war countdown-the structure of command-and-control-was being put into place by Marshal Ogarkov, another spokesman of the military High Command issued the military's demands to the politicians to get moving on the urgent question of the economic mobilization. Indeed, in what might be construed as a direct threat that if the politicians could not move fast enough on the economic mobilization, the army was there to step in, Kurkotkin concluded his article with the following remark: Of course, the problem of the effective use of the economic potential of the country in the interest of strengthening its defense capacity and reliable defense of the achievements of socialism will be solved with the most active participation of the entire personnel of our Armed Forces, especially the military cadres of the army and navy. And this is only natural. Warfare has its own internal structure and logic of development, and its own mechanism of quantitative and qualitative changes. And that mechanism has to be ready to receive the \"services\" of the economy and of scientific-technological progress. A few weeks later, on Dec. 11, 1984, Mikhail Gorbachov-rather than General Secretary Chernenko-delivered the main speech at the \"All-Union Scientific-Technological Conference on Implementing the June 1983 Central Committee Plenum Resolutions.\" There, Gorbachov announced that the new Soviet goal was to \"lead the world\" in science, technology and advanced industry by the \"beginning of the next mil- lennium.\" Ogarkov, Kurkotkin et al. had themselves a leader who was going to tackle the problem of \"putting economic potential into action\" in a serious way.

For the Western observer, it is often difficult to appreciate to what degree Soviet military thinking is dominated by that experience. References to \"the lessons of the Great Patriotic War,\" as the Soviets call their part of World War II, are constant and pervasive in the Soviet press. To take a most recent and typical example, the front-page editorial in the Soviet armed forces daily Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star) on June 22, 1985 was headlined: \"History Teaches Vigilance\" (which, by the way, is also the title of the newly published booklet by Marshal Ogarkov, reviewed in Soviet publications in early June). The Krasnaya Zvezda editorial is full of phrases like the following: Vigilance-precisely this is the lesson of the history of the Great Patriotic War, which began by the perfidious attack by Hitler Ger- many on the Soviet Union forty-four years ago. And it is vigilance that is demanded by the complex and dangerous situation on the international scene as it has emerged in our own day. Or, as the conclusion of the editorial: Unremitting vigilance and the necessity of raising combat readiness constitute the holy duty of Soviet soldiers to their Motherland and to their people. This is the lesson of history. Implicit in such references to \"the perfidious attack of Hitler Germany\" is of course the admission that the Soviet Union was indeed not prepared for the enemy's attack in 1941. Usually, that admission remains only implicit-since frank confession of past errors is hardly a characteristic feature of Soviet historians-but occasionally, in especially authoritative writings, direct references are allowed. One illustrative example of such frankness was provided in the article written for the anniversary of the end of the war in the government daily, Izvestia, on May 7, 1985, by the Chief of General Staff, Marshal Akh- romeyev. His article was entitled \"The Great Victory and Its Lessons.\" ...On the eve of the war, the Communist Party of the Soviet Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Approved For Release 2010/06/03: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100310004-9 Union correctly evaluated the growing threat of war. In the complex prewar situation, the party did all it could to avert war, and at the same time, it strengthened the country's defense capability. The enemy's perfidious attack caught the Soviet Union at a time when many of the defense measures had not yet been completed. ...The victory of the Soviet people and their Armed Forces in the Great Patriotic War holds many lessons. Our sacrifices were great, but the outcome of the war taught us a great deal. From it, we have drawn important military-political conclusions and learned the necessary lessons. The significance of these conclusions and lessons is permanent and they are particularly topical in present conditions. ... Historical experience has taught us that in view of imperi- alism's aggressiveness, utmost vigilance is called for. It is necessary to constantly keep an eye on its intrigues, to analyze the developing military-political situation, to bear in mind its dangerous trends, to expose the possible nature of a future war that imperialism may unleash, and on the basis of this, and exercising great foresight, to resolve defense tasks and purposefully build and train the Armed Forces. We remember what the miscalculations and errors committed on the eve of the Great Patriotic War cost us. In present-day con- ditions, in view of the sides' large quantities of nuclear and other weapons, it would be considerably more difficult to rectify omissions while war was in progress. As these examples show, the official Soviet calls for \"vigilance\" and \"readiness\"-at least those which are part of the public propaganda- are invariably framed in the context of a message that \"we must not allow ourselves to be caught off guard.\" In the 1950s, during the era of Soviet inferiority in strategic nuclear weapons, this may have been a serious concern. Today, however-and this is overwhelmingly clear from the case of Soviet doctrine on war economy mobilization as we examined it in the preceding section-\"preparedness\" does not refer to the case of a possible surprise attack by the enemy nearly as much as it does the careful, methodical putting into place of the economic and military resources and the command structure required for an offensive nuclear war against the West. Since 1945, Soviet military doc"
