Yu., a court secretary, participating, having examined in an open court session and in the building of\n\nthe court a request submitted by Onikeyenko, S.M., a senior major case investigator of the Chief Military\n\nProsecutors Office at the Office of the General Prosecutor of Ukraine, concerning temporary access to documents,\n\nDETERMINED\n\nOnikeyenko, Serhiy Mykolayovych, a senior major case investigator of the Chief Military Prosecutors\n\nOffice at the Office of the General Prosecutor of Ukraine, having examined the materials of criminal proceedings #\n\n22015050000000021 of January 13, 2015, and having received an approval of prosecutor Scherbak, A., turned to\n\nthe court with a request, which he upheld at the time of its examination.\n\nIn accordance with Part 2 of Article 163 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine the person who\n\npossesses the information, was not summoned to be present at the court session.\n\nIt was determined that the investigation section of the department investigating crimes against the\n\nfundamental security of the Ukrainian state, as well as crimes against peace, safety of mankind and international\n\nrule of law of the Chief Military Prosecutors Office at the Office of the General Prosecutor of Ukraine was carrying\n\nout a pretrial investigation for criminal proceedings # 22015050000000021 initiated on January 13, 2015 regarding\n\nthe commission of a deadly act of terror with elements of a criminal act referred to in Part 3, Article 258 of the\n\nCriminal Code of Ukraine.\n\nBased on the materials of the criminal proceedings it appears that on January 13 at 2:25 PM individuals\n\nwho were not identified in the course of the pretrial investigation, being located at the north-eastern suburb of the\n\ncity of Dokuchayivsk, Donetsk oblast, using 120 mm free-flight highly explosive fragmentation shells 􀊺-21 􀊽􀋇\n\n(product 9 M 22􀋄) launched from no less than three multiple launch rocket systems 􀊥􀊺-21 Grad, attacked by fire\n\nthe territory of the checkpoint of the Military Forces of Ukraine organized on Slavyansk  Mariupol H-20\n\nmotorway in the vicinity of fixed security station # 5 of the Road Traffic Police under the Senior Administration of\n\nInternal Affairs of Ukraine in Donetsk oblast.\n\nAs a result of that attack by fire a commuter bus I-VAN Tata A0718, state matriculation # AH 0985 AA,\n\nshuttling between Zlatoustovka and Donetsk, was damaged, 12 people who had been wounded by shell fragments\n\nwere killed and 19 other people (including an officer of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine) got injuries of\n\nvarious severity.\n\nAs a result of the examination of the scene carried out on January 16, 2015 it was determined that the\n\nholes, discovered near the checkpoint, had been formed by shells, probably launched from the north-eastern\n\nsuburb of the city of Dokuchayivsk, Donetsk oblast.\n\nThe individuals that had been interrogated in connection with the explosion as well as witnesses reported\n\nthat, judging by the sound, the shells that blew up near the bus, were flying from the north-east, having possibly\n\nbeen launched from the territory controlled by the DPR military group.\n\nTo provide for a complete, objective and comprehensive investigation of all circumstances related to the\n\ncarrying out of this act of terror that caused death of people, as well as to identify those involved in the carrying\n\nout of the said act of terror, there arose a requirement to get an access to the information about the mobile base\n\nstations of the corresponding mobile operators that were functioning (providing for the coverage) in the north-\n\neastern suburb of the city of Dokuchayivsk, Donetsk Oblast, within the zone from which the said shells had been\n\nlaunched.\n\nThus, in the course of the pretrial investigation related to the said criminal proceedings it became\n\nnecessary that information on the specific mobile base stations of the corresponding mobile operators that were\n\nfunctioning (covered) in the said territory during the period from January 12, 2015 to January 13, 2015 be\n\nprovided.\n\nTaking into account and considering the fact that the materials of the criminal proceedings refer to\n\nsufficient grounds to consider that the said documents are of substantial value when it comes to identification of\n\nimportant circumstances in the criminal proceedings, therefore, for the submitted request to be efficiently\n\nexecuted it should be recognized as grounded and as such subject to being satisfied.\n\nTherefore, on the grounds of the aforementioned and based on Articles 160-166 of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure of Ukraine the investigating judge\n\nDECIDED:\n\nTo give the Onikeyenko, Serhiy Mykolayovych, a senior major case investigator of the Chief Military\n\nProsecutors Office at the Office of the General Prosecutor of Ukraine, or to other investigators from the\n\ninvestigating group appointed/delegated by him, a temporary access and a permission to turn to Lifecell, a Limited\n\nLiability Company, situated at the address as follows: 12, Amosova Str., Kyiv, 03680, and to obtain therefrom the\n\nhard and soft copies of documents containing information on the specific mobile base stations of the\n\ncorresponding mobile operator that were functioning (covered) in the in the north-eastern suburb of the city of\n\nDokuchayivsk, Donetsk Oblast, within the zone from which the said shells had been launched, namely in the\n\nterritory lying within the following grid points: (latitude: N47.761890 = 47045.71 = 4704542.8, longitude:\n\nE37.67890 = 37040.73 = 3704044; latitude: N47.763040 = 47045.78 = 4704546.9, longitude: E37.703960 =\n\n37042.24 = 3704214.3; latitude: N47.744810 = 47044.69 = 4704441.30, longitude: E37.700870 = 37042.05 =\n\n370423.1; latitude: N47.745560 = 47044.73 = 47044440, longitude: E37.678640 = 37040.72 = 3704043.1)\n\nduring the period from January 12, 2015 to January 13, 2015.\n\nTo determine the validity period of the decision as twenty working days, which should begin on the day of\n\nthe investigating judges pronouncing the decision.\n\nShould the present order concerning the temporary access to the materials and documents not be\n\nfulfilled, the investigating judge, the court as per the request of the criminal proceedings party that has been\n\ngranted such an access to the materials and documents based on the order, is entitled to enact another regulation\n\nsanctioning a search in accordance with the regulations of this Code in order to find and collect the said materials\n\nand documents.

Yu., a court secretary, participating, having examined in an open court session and in the building of\n\nthe court a request submitted by Onikeyenko, S.M., a senior major case investigator of the Chief Military\n\nProsecutors Office at the Office of the General Prosecutor of Ukraine, concerning temporary access to documents,\n\nDETERMINED\n\nOnikeyenko, Serhiy Mykolayovych, a senior major case investigator of the Chief Military Prosecutors\n\nOffice at the Office of the General Prosecutor of Ukraine, having examined the materials of criminal proceedings #\n\n22015050000000021 of January 13, 2015, and having received an approval of prosecutor Scherbak, A., turned to\n\nthe court with a request, which he upheld at the time of its examination.\n\nIn accordance with Part 2 of Article 163 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine the person who\n\npossesses the information, was not summoned to be present at the court session.\n\nIt was determined that the investigation section of the department investigating crimes against the\n\nfundamental security of the Ukrainian state, as well as crimes against peace, safety of mankind and international\n\nrule of law of the Chief Military Prosecutors Office at the Office of the General Prosecutor of Ukraine was carrying\n\nout a pretrial investigation for criminal proceedings # 22015050000000021 initiated on January 13, 2015 regarding\n\nthe commission of a deadly act of terror with elements of a criminal act referred to in Part 3, Article 258 of the\n\nCriminal Code of Ukraine.\n\nBased on the materials of the criminal proceedings it appears that on January 13 at 2:25 PM individuals\n\nwho were not identified in the course of the pretrial investigation, being located at the north-eastern suburb of the\n\ncity of Dokuchayivsk, Donetsk oblast, using 120 mm free-flight highly explosive fragmentation shells 􀊺-21 􀊽􀋇\n\n(product 9 M 22􀋄) launched from no less than three multiple launch rocket systems 􀊥􀊺-21 Grad, attacked by fire\n\nthe territory of the checkpoint of the Military Forces of Ukraine organized on Slavyansk  Mariupol H-20\n\nmotorway in the vicinity of fixed security station # 5 of the Road Traffic Police under the Senior Administration of\n\nInternal Affairs of Ukraine in Donetsk oblast.\n\nAs a result of that attack by fire a commuter bus I-VAN Tata A0718, state matriculation # AH 0985 AA,\n\nshuttling between Zlatoustovka and Donetsk, was damaged, 12 people who had been wounded by shell fragments\n\nwere killed and 19 other people (including an officer of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine) got injuries of\n\nvarious severity.\n\nAs a result of the examination of the scene carried out on January 16, 2015 it was determined that the\n\nholes, discovered near the checkpoint, had been formed by shells, probably launched from the north-eastern\n\nsuburb of the city of Dokuchayivsk, Donetsk oblast.\n\nThe individuals that had been interrogated in connection with the explosion as well as witnesses reported\n\nthat, judging by the sound, the shells that blew up near the bus, were flying from the north-east, having possibly\n\nbeen launched from the territory controlled by the DPR military group.\n\nTo provide for a complete, objective and comprehensive investigation of all circumstances related to the\n\ncarrying out of this act of terror that caused death of people, as well as to identify those involved in the carrying\n\nout of the said act of terror, there arose a requirement to get an access to the information about the mobile base\n\nstations of the corresponding mobile operators that were functioning (providing for the coverage) in the north-\n\neastern suburb of the city of Dokuchayivsk, Donetsk Oblast, within the zone from which the said shells had been\n\nlaunched.\n\nThus, in the course of the pretrial investigation related to the said criminal proceedings it became\n\nnecessary that information on the specific mobile base stations of the corresponding mobile operators that were\n\nfunctioning (covered) in the said territory during the period from January 12, 2015 to January 13, 2015 be\n\nprovided.\n\nTaking into account and considering the fact that the materials of the criminal proceedings refer to\n\nsufficient grounds to consider that the said documents are of substantial value when it comes to identification of\n\nimportant circumstances in the criminal proceedings, therefore, for the submitted request to be efficiently\n\nexecuted it should be recognized as grounded and as such subject to being satisfied.\n\nTherefore, on the grounds of the aforementioned and based on Articles 160-166 of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure of Ukraine the investigating judge\n\nDECIDED:\n\nTo give the Onikeyenko, Serhiy Mykolayovych, a senior major case investigator of the Chief Military\n\nProsecutors Office at the Office of the General Prosecutor of Ukraine, or to other investigators from the\n\ninvestigating group appointed/delegated by him, a temporary access and a permission to turn to Lifecell, a Limited\n\nLiability Company, situated at the address as follows: 12, Amosova Str., Kyiv, 03680, and to obtain therefrom the\n\nhard and soft copies of documents containing information on the specific mobile base stations of the\n\ncorresponding mobile operator that were functioning (covered) in the in the north-eastern suburb of the city of\n\nDokuchayivsk, Donetsk Oblast, within the zone from which the said shells had been launched, namely in the\n\nterritory lying within the following grid points: (latitude: N47.761890 = 47045.71 = 4704542.8, longitude:\n\nE37.67890 = 37040.73 = 3704044; latitude: N47.763040 = 47045.78 = 4704546.9, longitude: E37.703960 =\n\n37042.24 = 3704214.3; latitude: N47.744810 = 47044.69 = 4704441.30, longitude: E37.700870 = 37042.05 =\n\n370423.1; latitude: N47.745560 = 47044.73 = 47044440, longitude: E37.678640 = 37040.72 = 3704043.1)\n\nduring the period from January 12, 2015 to January 13, 2015.\n\nTo determine the validity period of the decision as twenty working days, which should begin on the day of\n\nthe investigating judges pronouncing the decision.\n\nShould the present order concerning the temporary access to the materials and documents not be\n\nfulfilled, the investigating judge, the court as per the request of the criminal proceedings party that has been\n\ngranted such an access to the materials and documents based on the order, is entitled to enact another regulation\n\nsanctioning a search in accordance with the regulations of this Code in order to find and collect the said materials\n\nand documents.

M. Levchenko received for his perusal the\n\nmaterials of criminal case no. 22015050000000021 of January 13, 2015, namely:\n\n- the scene inspection report (on the damaged bus and the civilians who died in it) of January 13,\n\n2015, with annexes thereto, a layout diagram, and photoboards on 29 sheets (volume 1, 9-37);\n\n- the scene inspection report (on the surrounding area, the craters at the scene from where metal\n\nobjects had been removed) of January 13, 2015 with a layout diagram attached on 6 sheets (volume\n\n1, 38-43);\n\n- the inspection report (on the craters at the scene and metal objects removed from them) of\n\nJanuary 14, 2015, with annexes thereto, a layout diagram, and photoboards on 8 sheets (volume 1,\n\n71-78);\n\n- the inspection report (all the craters that were formed in the area adjacent to the checkpoint) of\n\nJanuary 16, 2015 without annexes on 11 sheets (volume 1, 118-128);\n\n- the inspection report (specifying the angle of the entry of the shells with the participation of an\n\nexpert from a missile and artillery battalion, military unit number A 2167, S. V. Dmitriyev) of\n\nJanuary 16, 2015 with an area map attached on which the expert indicated the trajectory flown by the\n\nshells on 6 sheets (volume 1, 129-134);\n\n- the report on the inspection of video recordings and the viewing of the video recordings made\n\nby surveillance cameras and materials pertaining to the conducted forensic examinations.\n\nHaving studied the aforesaid materials, expert V. M. Levchenko stated that the fragments that had\n\nbeen removed from the explosion site were fragments of an M 21 OF high-explosive fragmentation missile\n\nprojectile and its component parts.\n\nThe metal fragments depicted on the photoboards attached to the inspection reports and the\n\nconclusion of an explosives expert no. 63 of January 18, 2015 were parts of the aforesaid shells tail.\n\nDuring the review, expert V. M. Levchenko, using\n\n- an aiming circle AK-4;\n\n- a ruler MPL-50;\n\n- a range table for firing M-21 OF high-explosive fragmentation missile shells (published by the\n\nUSSR Defense Ministrys Military Publishing House, 1975);\n\n[signature]\n\n- a Samsung tablet operating on the Army SOS software and a pencil  reported the following:\n\nConsidering the place where the high-explosive fragmentation missile shells exploded and the front\n\nof those shells explosions, the shell explosion (crater) is taken to be the middle of the explosion front,\n\nwhich is marked in the scene inspection report of January 16, 2015 with the participation of expert S. V.\n\nDmitriyev as no. 2 (with coordinates x-6678, y-89,821) and the explosions grid azimuth 6-32. The shell\n\nentered the ground at 52-55 degrees, with the average taken to be 53 degrees.\n\nAs per the regulations, high-explosive fragmentation missile shells can be fired from a BM-21\n\n(combat vehicle) as follows: 1) without a locking ring, 2) with a small locking ring, and 3) with a large\n\nlocking ring.\n\nIf a high-explosive fragmentation missile shell is used without a locking ring, its flight (fire) range\n\nwill be 19 kilometers 200 meters. Taking into account explosion no. 2 (taken to be the middle of the\n\nexplosion front), its grid azimuth (6-32), its angle of fall (53 degrees), which corresponds to a range of 19\n\nkilometers 200 meters in the Range Table, it is possible to calculate (using rulers and a Samsung tablet\n\noperating on the Army SOS software) the location of the likely firing position from which the high-\n\nexplosive fragmentation missile shells were fired.\n\nThe coordinates of the firing position will probably be as follows: x-91914 and y-01640, the height\n\nof 139 meters. On the area map, it is located in the eastern part of the town of Dokuchayevsk.\n\nIf a high-explosive fragmentation missile shell is used with a small locking ring, its flight (fire)\n\nrange will be 15 kilometers 200 meters. Taking into account explosion no. 2 (taken to be the middle of the\n\nexplosion front), its grid azimuth (6-32), and its angle of fall (53 degrees), which corresponds to a range of\n\n15 kilometers 200 meters in the Range Table, it is possible to calculate (using rulers and a Samsung tablet\n\noperating on the Army SOS software) the location of the likely firing position from which the high-\n\nexplosive fragmentation missile shells were fired.\n\nThe coordinates of the firing position will probably be as follows: x-88776 and y-99177, the height\n\nof 147 meters. On the area map, it is located in the south-western part of the town of Dokuchayevsk.\n\nIf a high-explosive fragmentation missile shell is used with a large locking ring, its flight (fire)\n\nrange will be 11 kilometers 470 meters. Taking into account explosion no. 2 (taken to be the middle of the\n\nexplosion front), its grid azimuth (6-32), its angle of fall (53 degrees), which corresponds to a range of 11\n\nkilometers 470 meters in the Range Table, it is possible to calculate (using rulers and a Samsung tablet\n\noperating on the Army SOS software) the location of the likely firing position from which the high-\n\nexplosive fragmentation missile shells were fired.\n\nThe coordinates of the firing position will probably be as follows: x-85836 and y-96883, the height\n\nof 180 meters. On the area map, it is located two kilometers to the south-east of the town of\n\nNovotroyitske.\n\nThe location of firing positions no. 2 and no. 3 would be the closest to the contact line between the\n\nUkrainian Armed Forces and illegal armed groups, and therefore, they are unlikely.\n\nI would like to note that the most probable firing position is firing position no. 1, because it is\n\nlocated the furthest away from the deployment area of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and, therefore, the\n\nfiring position of the shooters could not be quickly identified and response fire could not be opened.\n\nIn order to install locking rings one does not need the knowledge of combat calculations or additional\n\ntime. Moreover, in addition, in order to provide \"cover\" for and ensure the personal safety of the\n\nshooters,\" they used the civilian infrastructure of the town of Dokuchayivsk. The aforesaid firing\n\nposition does not need to be immediately rolled up and abandoned unlike the other two firing positions\n\nlocated on open terrain, where they could be quickly detected by the reconnaissance capabilities of the\n\nUkrainian Armed Forces and inevitably attacked by response fire, which would have caused a\n\nsignificant loss of military equipment and personnel.\n\nSince, in the course of the review of the provided materials of the criminal case, no items were\n\nidentified with an external appearance similar to that of metal fragments of locking rings, one can assume\n\nthat they were not used.\n\nI would like to note that the BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launcher has 40 guides. Since, according\n\nto the inspection report of January 16, 2015, there are 88 points of impact in the area adjacent to the\n\ncheckpoint, one can conclude that the aforesaid shells had been fired from at least three BM-21 Grad\n\nmultiple rocket launchers.\n\n[signature]\n\nHaving inspected the damaged i-􀀹􀁄􀁑􀀃􀀷􀀤􀀷􀀤􀀃􀁆􀁒􀁐􀁐􀁘􀁗􀁈􀁕􀀃􀁅􀁘􀁖􀀃􀀋􀁖􀁗􀁄􀁗􀁈􀀃􀁏􀁌􀁆􀁈􀁑􀁖􀁈􀀃􀁓􀁏􀁄􀁗􀁈􀀃􀀤􀀱􀀃􀀓􀀜􀀛􀀘􀀃􀈺􀈺􀀌􀀏􀀃􀁒􀁑􀁈􀀃\n\ncan assume that such damage is typical of damage caused by an M-21 OF high-explosive fragmentation\n\nmissile shell.\n\nThe inspection was conducted in Office no. 316 of the Main Military Prosecutor's Office of the\n\nProsecutor General of Ukraine located at the address: Kyiv, vul.
