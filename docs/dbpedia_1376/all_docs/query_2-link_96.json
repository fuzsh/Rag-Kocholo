        "text": "\"Dear reader!\n\nValery Khalilov called the military orchestra \"the connecting link between the army and the people,\" and the wind music \"the musical symbol of the country along with the anthem and coat of arms.\"\n\nThe life of Lt. Gen. Valery Khalilov combined two seemingly opposite lives. He was in all his glory as the country's chief military conductor at the Victory Parades on Red Square. He conducted a massed band of more than a thousand musicians during the Spasskaya Tower International Military Music Festival, of which he was the founder. And then he would leave for his native village in the Vladimir Region to go to the forest for wild strawberries, to meet all his neighbours in his home, and to take care of the sacred pole for praying by the main road.\n\nIt was natural for him after socializing with acclaimed artists of the world music scene to eat buckwheat porridge cooked in field conditions in a company of spectators.\n\nFor fourteen years, he was successfully in charge of the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. As the chief military conductor of the country, V.M. Khalilov did a lot to make sure that after the collapse of the once great power, the prestige of military musician service was again raised to the level adequate for military bands to address their missions.\n\nTo succeed in achieving this goal every effort was made to restructure military band personnel through introducing new positions, to develop fundamentally new guidelines for administrative and economic activities of military band conductors, to include new military marches and pieces of music of various genres in performance programs, to revive the tradition of military band performance in city parks, as well as to organize and conduct music events with participation of brass bands of Russia and foreign music groups.\n\nBeing aware of the urgent need for introducing fundamentally new pieces of music into the repertoire of military bands of Russia to be responsive to contemporary demands, V.M. Khalilov himself wrote over a hundred musical pieces for a military band. Among them are such military marches as: \"Alexander\", \"General Miloradovich\", \"Cadet\", \"Red Army Man Sukhov\", \"Lefortovsky\", \"Molodezhnyi\", \"Rynda\", \"Uhlan\", \"Junker\", \"Heraldic March\". There are also army song fanfares, waltzes \"Lilac\" and \"Begonia\", a number of vocal compositions: romances and songs.\n\nIt should be noted that many of these musical works are part of the performance and military-service band programs while some of his marches have been performed for several years now on May, 9 during military parades on Red Square.\n\nValery Khalilov had a favourite anecdote. An angel settled on the conductor's shoulder and tells him:\n\n\"I have good news and bad news for you. Which do you want first?\"\n\n\"Start with good news.\"\n\n\"When join the angels, you will be the conductor of an angels' choir.\"\n\n\"Okay. And the bad one?\"\n\n\"The first choir practice is scheduled for tomorrow.\"\n\nMuch to our regret, we cannot read our future. Therefore it was a real blow for us, military band conductors and musicians, when we learned in the early morning of December 25, 2016 that the Russian military Tupolev-154 plane crashed in the Black Sea off Sochi on its way to Hmeimim, Syria. Among those who perished in that crash there were 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, including their director and conductor Valery Khalilov. Nobody survived in the crash…\n\nThis book is primarily tribute to the memory of an Inspiring Personality, the conductor and the musician well-known to the entire nation.\n\nWhat can be more interesting and challenging than to write a book about a man of great calibre in the field of military band music development? Especially when you used to have a close relationship with the hero of your story for several decades. But where to start? So little time had passed since the moment when the life of Lt. Gen. Valery Khalilov ended abruptly in such a tragic and unnatural way…\n\nThe starting point is undoubtedly archival documents. Personal records of characters in the book from the Central Archive of the Ministry of Defence of Russia in the city of Podolsk are to be scrupulously studied.\n\nAt the same time, the book is based on the memories of relatives of Valery Mikhailovich. His friends talk about his path in life. These are, first of all, his fellow cadets, who studied with him at the Moscow Military Music School and then enlisted in the Department of Military Band Conductors of the Moscow State Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky. They tell us about his professional qualities as well as shaping of his personal qualities at that time.\n\nHis former school teachers also speak about Valery Mikhailovich. The knowledge they shared with him proved to be useful in his military service.\n\nIn addition to his close relatives, teachers and friends, the recollections of colleagues – military band conductors, complement the narrative about his professional career starting from the beginning of military service at the Pushkin Higher Military School of Radio Electronics, teaching at the Chair of Military Band Service and to the service in the office of the Head of the Military Band Service of the Ministry of Defence of Russia, where Khalilov passed all the stages of service from an inspector of military bands to the Head of the Military Band Service of the Ministry of Defence of the whole country...\n\nThe book also tells the story of composing pieces of music, under what circumstances was composed this or that march, romance or a concert composition. Lastly, the book offers the reader a chapter on the organization of several military music festivals in Russia of the 21st century, the founder and organizer of which was Lt. Gen. Valery Khalilov.\n\nIt is worthy of note that the book about Valery Khalilov, prominent musician, conductor and composer, may be useful not only for military-band musicians and conductors. The fact that a wide range of military-band music lovers find the book about such an extraordinary personality and his music interesting suggests that Valery Khalilov left his mark in the history of development of military bands in early 21st century Russia.\n\nHopefully, this book dedicated to such a remarkable person will be one of the first studies aimed at revealing all the facets of his talent and art for a wide audience of military-band music lovers.\n\nThe author would welcome follow-up research of life and art of Valery Khalilov, a splendid musician and a man, undertaken by enthusiasts to bring it to a logical end.\"\n\nFROM CHILDHOOD ON\n\n\"Crimea, Yalta…Who has not dreamed of going there in summer to have a great time and to bask in the summer hot sun while swimming in the warm waters of the Black Sea! And how beautiful is nature there! Look at avenues of cypresses and healing sea air alone! Now add numerous parks, the most renowned being Livada and Vorontsov parks built by order of Emperor Alexander III in the second half of XIX century. Early in the new century, the town of Yalta became a real gem in the collection of fashionable resorts thanks to its wonderful climate exactly the same as that of the famous resorts of Nice, San Remo, and Cannes.\n\nThat's where the author starts his story about the Khalilovs dynasty on the father's side of the family. At that time the Khalilovs lived in Zarechie, in the area of the old town of Yalta. The head of the family Nikolai Khalilov and his wife Klavdiya Ivanovna were engaged in agriculture raising livestock, tilling their land, and harvesting. And of course, like any landowner family they worked in their vineyard.\n\nVicissitudes of revolutionary events that swept the Crimean Peninsula after the February Revolution followed by the October Revolution passed the Khalilovs by for some time to come. Being a descendant of the Crimean Tatars, Nikolai Khalilov did not side with either the \"Reds\" or the \"Whites\" and was engaged exclusively in agriculture.\"\n\n\"The Khalilovs were lucky no to get into the purgatory fire of the World Revolution. Nikolai was not drafted into the White Army by age (in 1920 he was only 18) as well as a representative of the Crimean Tatars. He did not fight with arms against the Reds and was not involved in any kind of fighting.\n\nWhen establishing the new Soviet system, the so-called committees for the poor were endowed with ample powers. In Crimea these committees were bodies of Soviet power in the countryside. Their tasks were to search for food supplies hidden by local peasants from the Soviet system, to assist Red Army units in requisitioning surplus bread, flour, and livestock from wealthy peasants. Moreover these committees redistributed the requisitioned supplies, livestock, and agricultural implements among villagers.\n\nIt is no secret now that committee members more often than not were poor peasant, the so-called \"the poor\" who had no farms of their own or agricultural implements or plots of land but would love to have them at the expense of another well-to-do farmer. In Yalta at that time, those were just Crimean Tatars who had it all.\n\nIn early 1924, many families of Crimean Tatars were deported from their ancestral lands by detachments of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage and were sent in heated freight cars inland, in Uzbekistan. Among them were the Khalilovs…\"\n\n***\n\n\"Nikolai Khalilov's son, named Mikhail, was born on May 2, 1925 in the town of Namangan, Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. Upon arrival to a new place of residence the Khalilov family had to resettle down and get used to a new way of living and different climatic conditions.\n\nIn Namangan as anywhere else in Uzbekistan the deported Crimean Tatars lived in special settlements. For them there were restrictions on hiring: they were allowed to work only at construction sites and industrial enterprises or to pick cotton. \"\n\n\"In these difficult conditions Mikhail's mother, Klavdia, was making every effort to make their home more comfortable: she did the cooking and laundry, fostered their son while her husband worked hard to earn money. In her plain long dress and invariably long white scarf she would walk with her son to the local aryk (irrigation ditch in Central Asia) for water, and her son, when he was old enough, would carry heavy buckets of water back home trying to protect his mum.\n\nAt seven, Mikhail entered the first-stage school in Namangan.\"\n\n\"Once he heard a military band play during the celebration of the Great October Socialist Revolution anniversary. The boy was absolutely staggered by the look of brightly polished musical instruments and above all by the very sound of the orchestra! There was no music school in Namangan but after that episode Mikhail's parents took their son to the club at the Junior Pedagogical College named after Stalin where a few years ago there was formed an amateur wind band. The bandleader, an elderly, tall, gray-haired man with glasses endowed with thick moustache, auditioned the boy to see whether the boy had musical and vocal potential. Then he asked him to tap along with him simple rhythms with a sharpened pencil on the table, while saying: \"not bad,\" \"not bad\". The verdict of Nikolai Aleхandrovich Yakovlev, bandleader, was positive. Mikhail soon started his trumpet lessons and in the wind band he performed the part of the second cornet.\n\nFor Mikhail Nikolayevich Khalilov, future military band conductor, it was the beginning of his musical life and appreciation of wind music.\n\nSome more time had passed before Nikolai Aleksandrovich started to think about options for his hopeful pupil to continue studying at the Tashkent School of Music. The tutor turned to his friend, Head of the School of Music, 2nd rank intendant Krupinsky I.A. It was in the Tashkent School of Music that he received his primary knowledge and skills of a pupil of a military band.\"\n\n***\n\n\"But after a year Nikolai Aleхandrovich Yakovlev had to take Mikhail out of school due to family circumstances. His mother, Klavdia, had fallen ill and needed around-the-clock care. No matter how hard Nikolai Aleхandrovich together with Mikhail and his father tried to help her taking Klavdia to different hospitals of Namangan and Kokand, everywhere doctors shrugged helplessly saying that they could do nothing, that the medicine that could have cured her of the disease had not been invented yet.\n\nAfter graduating from the first stage school, Mikhail entered the Junior Pedagogical College named after Stalin in Namangan, at which there was a brass band. The father himself insisted on this, believing in the importance of the importance of the teaching profession in the country.\n\nDespite the family's efforts Klavdia passed away in September of 1939.\n\nAfter the death of his mother, Mikhail as the oldest child in the family took on responsibilities for the household and his younger brother and sister.\"\n\n\"After graduating from college, he began teaching Russian at school No. 2 in Namangan. The entire teaching staff of the school took a liking to the even-tempered young man of sense. During his lessons children would listen to him and practically never misbehaved. Life was returning to normal when the war broke out...\n\nFrom the very beginning of the Great Patriotic War Mikhail repeatedly applied to the military enlistment office to be sent as a volunteer to the front. However, at that time he was under 18 and as a teacher he was entitled to a preferential right not to be called up for active duty, so until the autumn of 1941 he continued teaching Russian and literature at school and all his applications to the military enlistment office were ignored. At the same time, Mikhail helped his teacher Nikolai Aleхandrovich Yakovlev in every possible way both in overseeing logistics of instruments and stage activities for rehearsals and performances and dealing with orchestra activities at the club of the junior pedagogical college. Mikhail also helped him at home. In gratitude for this help, Nikolai Yakovlev again helped Mikhail and his younger brother asking for them his colleague Krupinsky I.A. who by that time had headed the Military Band Service of the Turkestan Military District.\n\nAleхei was enrolled in the Tashkent School of Music and Mikhail was called up for military service in the military band of the Kharkov Infantry Military School, which in time of the Great Patriotic War was transferred to Namangan. After his two-year service in the military band he was assigned for a year to the Tashkent School of Music as an instructor to prepare for entering the Higher School of Military Band Conductors from the Turkestan Military District. Having successfully passed all the entrance exams, Mikhail Khalilov was enrolled in the Higher School of Military Band Conductors in Moscow.\"\n\nMILITARY MUSIC IN MY SOUL\n\n\"Our cadet corps was as they say ethnically diversified. Captain Trotsky, Regimental Commander said, \"there were Jews, Belarusians, Ukrainians, Georgians, Armenians, Kazakhs, one Finnish national and even two or three Tatars!\"\n\nWhy two or three Tatars? The thing is, in section three of the application form every student was expected to state his ethnic identity. Mikhail like his comrade Yasha Batalov honestly wrote \"Tatar\". Answering the native language question both of them indicated \"Russian\". There was another Tatar in their year, Umid Saddykovich Gubaev. He also called himself a Tatar but his passport stated Uzbek! So Regimental Commander Captain Totsky jokingly called these three \"the inseparable\", or \"two or three Tatars\".\n\nThroughout all the four years of education at Higher School of Military Band Conductors and later on at Institute of Military Conductors just these young men were closest friends of Mikhail: Umid Gubaev and Yakov Batalov. They also stuck together in the barracks, their beds side by side. They shared happy and sad days and assisted each other in studies and everyday life.\n\nThe classes began shortly after breakfast with the so-called music exercises. Every student had to play long musical notes and scales in their study rooms for improvement of the mouth muscles (embouchure (Fr. embouchure) – shaping the lips, tongue and face muscles of the musicians playing brass instruments. Also the name of the copper brass instrument mouthpiece). An excellent tuba player, Captain Totsky placed a chair in the middle of the long corridor, took his tuba B and together with students perfected his performance skill at the same time keeping an eye on the other students exercising in their music rooms. Looking at the Regimental Commander who was not at all obliged to practice that way all students took after him and never ignored that important class. Then at 9:30 a.m. the classes began: an orchestra class, harmoniсs lessons, solfeggio, musical literature, polyphony and certainly individual training with a tutor in conducting, piano, specialization, instrumentation and score reading. The students were also taught military subjects like USSR Military Regulations, marching drills, shooting practice and tactical training.\n\nClasses ended at 3 p.m. before lunch. After lunch self-studies began. That working order was very familiar to Mikhail, the same as in Tashkent School of Music and he in every way helped his comrades feel at ease in that atmosphere.\n\nCaptain Totsky did not support selective ethnic sponsorship and it took him long to decide whom to appoint the leader of the section in their course. Certainly it was to be an honest and demanding leader, with high merits in studies and a model for the subordinates. Junior Sergeant Mikhail Khalilov fitted into the picture. Everything went well but unexpectedly he was struck dead by Cupid's arrow so to speak and in the first year at that!\n\nOnce calling on business at the school personnel and supply records section (the subunit commander asked him to bring the personnel expenditures data) he saw a young lady typist and fell in love with her at first glance. Klavdia's beautiful dark hair, charming smile and modest look enchanted Mikhail. From that day he was looking for any excuse to go to the office to show the affection: a sudden bunch of field flowers on the window-sill, nobody knew how it had got in the locked-up room! Or himself waiting for the girl at the door after the office hours to see her home.\n\nInitially everyone thought Mikhail's passion for the girl would vanish with the time as studies were of prime importance at school! But months passed and the relations between the young people were just progressing. It was not only the beauty and charm of the young lady. She resembled Mikhail's mother very much: the same kindness and modesty and reliability. Her name coincided with his mother's by no chance. After an unauthorized leave that Mikhail Khalilov took to change the wallpaper in Klavdia and her mother's flat (the latter was disabled) he was ordered under a temporary detention. So the couple decided to formalize their relations in the Leninsky district civil registry office of Moscow. This legalized living together at the flat of Klavdia's mother and not in the barracks, moreover as Mikhail's wife was already expecting her first child.\"\n\n***\n\n\"So he was graduate of the Institute of Military Conductors! The officer's uniform looked so well on him. Klavdia, the loyal wife together with their daughter Lyusya came to the barracks in Khamovniki for the graduation ceremony of her husband. Certainly the ceremony was a memorable event for every Lieutenant graduating from Institute of Military Conductors. Not only as to how the husband and father was going to celebrate the Lieutenant's status. The most important thing, he already knew the desired destination. The special commission assigned Mikhail Nikolaevich Khalilov and Umid Saddykovich Gubaev with the Turkestan Military District, as they had requested.\"\n\n***\n\n\"After the vacation both military conductors, Mikhail Khalilov and Umid Gubaev arrived at Tashkent city. The staff officer in the rank of Major looked over his glasses at the Lieutenants and formally informed them that \"according to the commission of the Turkestan Military District Commander they were appointed military conductors\" at Nevelskaya Red Banner Motor Rifle Division No. 360.\n\nIt was good except that the facilities of the Regiment were in military town No. 16 far away from Termez city.\"\n\n\"Upon arrival he realized there was no way to bring the family along to the dormitory with one shower and one toilet room for several families. No conveniences. Too great a contrast with Moscow for his wife Klavdia Vasilyevna. Especially as she was pregnant again.\n\nBut however hard he tried to persuade the wife not to come over, Klavdia was persistent. As a true wife of a Soviet Army officer she was brought up in a certain culture. Practically like a Decembrist's wife, with one suitcase, a bundle of light things and a year-old Lyusya she came to the garrison of military town #16 just a month later. Klavdia was the same persistent as her husband. The pregnant woman was washing clothes, cleaning their small room in the officers' dormitory, and went shopping to the Termez market. She coped with everything!\n\nMeanwhile Mikhail was doing his best to make his unit lead after being \"the worst in the Division\". \"\n\n\"… Pulling together an integral team Lieutenant Khalilov started his work.\n\nOne has to mention the external support so to speak that he received from the commanders of his unit, Deputy Regimental Commander for political education Lieutenant Colonel E.I. Degtyaryov and Chief of Staff Lieutenant Colonel A.A. Vlasov. They supported the young conductor in every way: answered his requests, supplied him with new wind instruments.\"\n\n\"Military conductor Khalilov had all the time been there with his musicians. He was round the clock with them – in the barracks, personally led the morning exercise, ran with them for one kilometer every morning, and then did power lifting exercises on parallel and horizontal bars. Surprisingly, these fitness exercises attracted staff of extended service. They volunteered to participate in the exercises and came to the site at six in the morning for the drills together with the orchestra team, passing the standard fitting tests.\n\nRight after the morning inspection Lieutenant Khalilov went to the Regimental Headquarters for the meeting of the subdivision commanders to discuss the daily schedule. It was the time military music was back as the Regiment's daily routine. It was played before every meal, at the guard ceremony, at sports and other events. Besides Lieutenant Mikhail Khalilov in a short while managed to put together a team of Russian folk musicians who were on a regular base performing at all festivities in the Division. After being positioned as the garrison conductor he organized a massed band of two Regiments of the Nevelskaya Red Banner Division: the orchestra of Motor Rifle Regiment No.1103 and his own one. The massed orchestra numbered over fifty military musicians so they were a success performing at the recreation park after M. Gorky with various thematic concerts.\n\nSoon musicians of other military bands came to Mikhail Khalilov. So the massed band consisting of almost a hundred musicians gave concerts every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday for Termez city.\"\n\n\"Having set up working relations with Termez Musical College Lieutenant Khalilov also invited the massed choir of the college to perform with his orchestra. It is a good finale of any wind band concert.\"\n\nTHE ORIENT IS A NUANCED AREA\n\n\"No doubt throughout these several months Mikhail took to make his military band on a par with the best in the division his wife Klavdia devoted her entire time to household activity: she washed clothes, cleaned the apartment and took care of her small daughter Lyusya. The utilities in the officer's dormitory were actually low-grade so in a while Mikhail found an apartment to rent from the Chechen family in their military town No.16.\"\n\n\"Once after the New Year holidays Lieutenant Khalilov was summoned to Tashkent by the inspector of the Turkestan Military District Lieutenant Colonel Krupinsky.\n\n\"Honey, relax, you have time before delivery,\" soothed Mikhail his wife before departure. \"And I will be back in a week. You see it is the new teaching year in the troops. Also I will be able to meet my younger brother. Here the apartment hostess will help you with everything just in case.\" He was caressing his beloved wife's hair.\n\nThe latter was certainly against him leaving but realized service was primary. And he had to follow the orders given and leave for Tashkent to teach the Tashkent School of Music students.\n\n…Lieutenant Gubaev was as usual busy with the orchestra studio rehearsal that day. The orchestra was practicing the military march of N. Ivanov-Rudkevich \"Our Native Moscow\". Suddenly a messenger rushed in with the news that he was to show up before the Chief of Staff.\n\n\"Are you aware where your colleague military conductor Khalilov is?\" asked the Chief of Staff immediately looking at the Lieutenant inquiringly. \"Yes, Sir. He is now in Tashkent city for military training under the inspector of the Turkestan Military District,\" Lieutenant Gubaev reported. \"How do you like them apples? Doesn't he know his wife is childing now? And he has left for Tashkent! Good timing!\" the Chief of Staff was angry. \"Anyway, there came a call from the maternity hospital, his wife Klavdia Vasilyevna has already given birth to a boy. They are asking for transportation from the hospital as it lacks beds. Please, take my jeep with the driver and be off like a shot! Take her home from the maternity hospital. Are the instructions clear?\" \"Yes, Sir,\" said Lieutenant Gubaev and rushed to… the military shop to buy half a kilo of unwrapped soya sweets against the signed receipt. He was not given more as sweets were in great demand in Termez. It was the Orient. After the local rules the baby's father was to give a present to the person who brought out the newly born son, the bearer of the family name, to go home from the maternity hospital!\n\nThe traditions there were unbreakable. Hence the sweets were so much needed for the nurses who brought the baby out…\n\nSo the medical nurse brought the baby wrapped in a blanket out of the hospital saying, \"Father! Why are you standing there? Take your child!\" \"Actually I am not the father but the father's friend,\" Lieutenant Gubaev began making excuses. \"Really? It is not important now. Be quick to pick up the child, it is cold outside!\" answered the medical nurse and Klavdia with the baby got fast into the jeep that carried them home swiftly…\n\nUpon returning to the unit Umid Gubaev made an urgent telephone call to Tashkent, Lieutenant Colonel Krupinsky, Inspector of Military Bands of the Turkestan Military District and asked to deliver the important message to his friend Mikhail Khalilov.\"\n\n***\n\n\"Soon Mikhail Khalilov came back to Termez very happy with having a son. Together with Klavdia they for a long time had been choosing the name for the son and after much discussion named him Valery, from the Latin of Valerian meaning \"robust\" or \"agile\". The boy was actually robust and despite the fact he was born late January in the middle of winter when it was rather cold in Termez he was rarely sick during his first year and did not cause much trouble to the parents.\n\n\"Warranting his name!\" Mikhail often joked looking together with Klavdia at their sleeping son lovingly. The family was still renting a room from the apartment owner Raisa Yusupova who in every way assisted the young mother with two small kids. Mikhail Khalilov worked long hours as before, leaving home very early and coming back very late.\n\nThe news of the construction project to build dedicated \"Finnish\" cottages in their military town No. 16 brought great joy to the officers' families. The project was for cheap wooden housing construction after a Finnish know-how adopted by our military builders. Small one-storey block wooden houses were built fast in some three months! Mikhail Nikolaevich Khalilov considering his merits was among the first to move into the apartment. The cottage accommodated two officer families and their neighbor was an officer from the operations division of the Regimental HQ. Raisa Yusupova was greatly disappointed at first learning her tenants were leaving as she had become so close to them. But later on she calmed down when told they would live in a new house not far away from her place. So their doors would be always open for Raisa Yusupova.\n\nThe Khalilovs celebrated moving into a new place and invited their neighbours, their friend Umid Gubaev and Raisa Yusupova with her husband and children to mark the noteworthy event. A peculiarity of those newly erected Finnish houses was no floors done! So Umid Gubaev made a royal gift to his friend: an excellent big Uzbek red brick-coloured hand-made carpet. Sitting on the carpet the guests made many good sincere toasts to the new settlers. And a little later the Chief of Staff found an opportunity to commission the builders do away with all the faults in the shortest time and the floors were made from new lumber cants. The smell of a freshly cut pine tree of the flooring for a long time had been associated with the smell of childhood for Lyusya and Valery the Khalilovs' daughter and son.\"\n\n* * *\n\n\"Describing the complicated circumstances of the first service years of Lieutenant Mikhail Nikolaevich Khalilov we would like to stress that his endeavour in improving the skills of the orchestra under him to the regimental top level was duly appreciated by the Commandment. Here is an extract from the service attestation records in the personal file of Lieutenant M. Khalilov dated 1955: \"Senior Lieutenant M. Khalilov demonstrates sufficient military, specialized and general education skills for occupying the position of military conductor of the Regiment. He is diligent and effective in service. Has a reputation for discipline and high organizer qualities. He is teaching his subordinates professionally in a skilful manner.\"\n\nFinal statement: Senior Lieutenant Khalilov fully complies with the requirements for the position he is occupying and is worthy of being promoted to the status of the college military conductor. Lieutenant Colonel Chikov, Chief of Staff of the Regiment. November 23, 1955\".\n\nWhy then was Senior Lieutenant Khalilov being promoted to the position of the college military conductor? The thing was, after one of his trips to Tashkent Lieutenant Colonel Krupinsky, Inspector of Military Bands of the Turkestan Military District proposed to Mikhail Khalilov to become the military conductor of… Tashkent Infantry College named after Lenin. At first Khalilov agreed with the arguments in favour of the proposal made by Iosif Aleksandrovich: Tashkent was the capital and his family had two small children. They set up excellent relations with Lieutenant Colonel Krupinsky in those years in service.\n\nBut then Mikhail Khalilov changed his mind: his orchestra team was so outstanding and the Regimental Commandment also highly estimated his work.\" And his transfer was postponed.\n\nSERVING ONE'S COUNTRY WHERE ORDERED\n\n\"Late 1955 the Regiment of the Nevelskaya Guard Motor Rifle Division was re-deployed on alarm in Kerki town (the town of Atamurat now (Turkmenistan). The redeployment went so fast that for a long time many extended service officer families thought the Regiment was taking part in exercise and would soon be back to military town No. 16.\n\nThe time passed and it became clear from the letters to the families that soon they would join the fathers at the new location. By the time Klavdia Vasilyevna was carrying their third child. Mikhail tried in every way to persuade her go to Moscow to her mother to give birth but Klavdia absolutely refused. The wife's argument against was the same as before: wife and husband need to stick together \"for better or worse\".\n\nThe population of the town of Kerki on the left bank of the Amudarya river in the Turkmenskaya SSR by the time numbered fourteen thousand inhabitants maximum. In the old days it was a fortified town on the river bank. Kerki was called a town but in fact it was a big kishlak (a village of settled Turkmens), not very common as it sat on the crossroads with Afghanistan. One of its streets had the name of Tamozhennaya (Customs), there were two rows of European-style houses with the Customs office and houses of its staff.\"\n\n\"Mikhail was very lucky as one of Raisa Yusupova's friends, Amina lived practically in the very center of the town in Tamozhennaya Street. He easily found the mud-brick house and introducing himself to the elderly head of the family, Jamal Khadzhiev gave over the letter for the latter's wife, bowing.\"\n\n\"The letter written by Raisa Yusupova melted the ice towards the unknown officer. When the officer described his request the head of the family decided everything for him: \"You will be accommodated here in our house, there is enough space for all!\"\n\nThen he asked under his breath: \"Raisa wrote your family suffered the same way as we did?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" confirmed Mikhail. \"But it was long ago, as if in the other life. We lived in Yalta in the Crimea and in the 20ies were deported as Crimean Tatars to Uzbekistan, the city of Namangan. That's true, Father…\" \"Are you a faithful Muslim?\" asked Jamal all of a sudden. \"Father, first of all I am a Communist officer.\" Mikhail tried to be as sincere as possible answering this question so important for the host. \"But I deeply respect the holders of any religious belief.\" Jamal was happy with the honest answer and offered to accommodate the family in the nearest future.\n\n\"Moreover as you say your wife is expecting another baby to be born soon?\" The host liked this officer with a determined character and still more for being so modest.\"\n\n* * *\n\n\"Soon the third baby was born to the family of Mikhail Khalilov. Also a boy whom they wanted to name Alexander translated from Greek as \"Defender\". That time all the family came to the Kerki maternity hospital to meet the mother and the newly born: the father with his children Lyusya and Valery. The Chief of Staff offered his vehicle but Mikhail refused out of modesty. He said the distance to the place was small and they would go on foot.\n\nSo the medical nurse brought out the newly born in the blanket just like four years before and said, \"Father! Why are standing still? Take your baby!\" \"Well honey, take the baby fast! It is cold outside!\" Klavdia kissed her husband and gave over the baby. \"Are we going fast home?\"\n\n\"Mom,\" Lyusya was teasing her parents on the way. \"Let me take a look at the brother!\" \"Now we are all home finally, let's take a look at the son,\" answered Klavdia glancing at her husband with love, then at the other son and daughter. \"And you two will see the brother!\"\n\nJamal the host with his wife Amina was already sitting at the laid table waiting for them. They cooked a special dish for the occasion, mutton pilaf with spices and baked flatbread. The orchestra musicians came to congratulate Mikhail with the son born.\"\n\n\"Once during the regular check-up a doctor asked Mikhail Khalilov off hand:\n\n\"Mikhail Nikolaevich, how are things with your eyesight? Do you have headaches?\" \"Doctor! I am totally healthy. Look at me,\" Mikhail was aroused. \"The thing is, young man, your blood test is very bad. Secondly, here is the statement of the oculist. Your right eye weakened the eyesight by three diopters in a year. It is very much! Your left eye got much worse, minus two diopters. Thirdly, in the past two years you stayed away from service over three months! In the previous years you have risen up from the military rank of Lieutenant to Captain, unbelievable. Look attentively at your medical records.\" The doctor explained the situation to Captain Khalilov in detail.\n\n\"Doctor, please say what am I to do?\" Mikhail looked at the doctor with hope. Perhaps not all was so bad about him and the doctor would say with a smile it was not so bad, on the contrary, it was OK! But no miracle happened.\n\n\"I am sending you to a scheduled hospital check-up at District military hospital No.340 after Borovsky. You will fly to Tashkent for a thorough check-up.\"\n\n* * *\n\n\"Oh well, young man,\" the doctor turned to Mikhail with the X-ray image of his scull in his hand. He was carefully studying the image trying to read every minor detail.\" \"You have undergone all the prescribed tests and we can say we understand at least some things. Judging by the X-ray image you have a rare disease – tumor of pituitary gland!\"\n\n\"Doctor, is it a serious disease?\" Mikhail knew little about medical terminology and was unaware of what it was fraught with. \"It is not a deadly disease, I will say! Do not get discouraged as now there are different methods of treating the disease. In particular in our hospital you will undergo a course of deep X-ray therapy of the tumor.\" The doctor after a small pause asked the patient directly: \"Please say were there any relatives with the same cluster headache called migraine, as yours?\" \"Yes, there were. My mother,\" said Mikhail. \"She died long ago from some unknown disease. Before passing away she had been suffering from a headache tightening her temples and nape at night.\" \"This explains a lot,\" said the doctor thoughtfully.\"\n\n\"Mikhail Khalilov went through the scheduled course of X-ray therapy in the military hospital, finished the required medical tests and went back to his military formation \"in a satisfactory state of health\".\n\nBut Mikhail Khalilov's state of health was getting worse. His organism could not withstand the workload he had had as Senior Lieutenant.\"\n\n\"The course of X-ray therapy still had a positive effect on him. Headaches passed away and it was the main victory. Mikhail could work with his military band, do instrumentation work for his team. He even had a new dream to get enrolled as a postgraduate student of Institute of Military Conductors, the class of Lieutenant Colonel Kh.M. Khakhanyan, associate professor of Chair of Military Conductors.\n\nOnce together with his wife and children on a visit to the mother-in-law Mikhail called at the barracks in Khamovniki to see his ex-Regimental Commander Major Trotsky who was heading another course and at the same time acted as senior sub-unit commander at Institute of Military Conductors. Mikhail Alekseevich Trotsky was glad to meet his ex-student. They embraced each other and Major Trotsky even had wet eyes.\n\n\"Misha, I was told that you… perished there during exercises?\" Mikhail Alekseevich asked under his breath. \"Some officers from your course coming on leave here told me that terrible news.\" \"In their dreams, Mikhail Alekseevich! Never believe gossip,\" laughed Mikhail Khalilov. \"I am in perfect health. I have my beloved wife Klavdia and three children! No time to die!\"\n\n\"I am so happy it is this way!\" exclaimed Major Trotsky.\"\n\n\"Well, then I have another proposal to you: we shall go now to assistant professor Khristofor Mikhailovich Khakhanyan, Chair of Military Conductors. He was a student of S.A. Chernetsky himself, do you remember him? I will disclose a secret: another reorganization of our Institute of Military Conductors is about to take place and we shall need teaching officers from the army, with service experience. Who else but you after serving in remote garrisons of the Turkestan Military District can teach our students a thing or two?\" Major Trotsky was telling Khalilov in great confidence. \"And there opens a postgraduate vacancy at Chair of Military Conductors.\"\n\n* * *\n\n\"Late 1950s under the policy of the so-called \"Khruschyov\" curtailment of the overall size of the USSR Armed Forces the famous Nevelskaya Red Banner motor rifle division #360 underwent reduction.\"\n\n\"The future of the musicians in Captain Khalilov's band was more or less clear – they all were transferred to the military band of the brigade in Termez town to Captain Gubaev whom they had known well from before, but the fate of Mikhail Nikolaevich Khalilov himself and, most important, of his family was very uncertain. On the one hand, he was in good standing with the Division commanders: he was decorated with medals, among them \"For Combat Services\" and the Order of the Red Star.\n\nAnd on the other, if he was off from service then no military retirement payment for him and the family. And to take into account that only two years were left till he had the necessary twenty years in service enough for the retirement. An option was left, to become a post graduate student of Institute of Military Conductors, Chair of Military Conductors. But the requirement was to be enrolled from the position of a military conductor. No other way. After a conversation with his wife Mikhail did the right thing – to go to Tashkent to the newly appointed Head of the Turkestan Military District Lieutenant Colonel N.P. Dolgov and ask him for a position in any other military band of the Turkestan Military District.\"\n\n\"Captain Khalilov was offered \"a position of military conductor of Sapper Regiment No.58 in Dzhambul city of the Kazakhskaya Soviet Socialist Republic\".\n\n\"Dzhambul is a beautiful city! Several times over your Kerki town, you won't regret it!\" Colonel Dolgov cheered his subordinate. \"By the way, there is a musical department at an art school there. I received a call from them; they asked my advice as to who from local military conductors could teach conducting, instrumentation and study of instruments. I thought you would be good for teaching these subjects. This will also give you a chance to sit up for exams as a postgraduate student, gain teaching experience as well!\"\n\n\"I heard you have a third child born in the family? Congratulations! Is it a boy?\" Captain Khalilov nodded.\n\n\"Wonderful! He will grow to become the military conductor as his father.\"\n\n\"As Lieutenant Dolgov had promised, very soon the Regimental HQ received the documents ordering \"change of station for Captain Khalilov and the bandmaster and their transfer to the band of Sapper Regiment No.58 in Dzhambul city of the Kazakhskaya Soviet Socialist Republic\". The night before departure after an old army tradition the musicians organized a farewell party with a festive table and invited their wives and children. A lot of warm words were addressed to the conductor and the bandmaster. Parting with them the musicians understood their comrades would soon be in another team, and sincerely wished them good health, happiness and settling well and fast with their families in a new place. Listening to what the musicians were saying Klavdia in her heart was very proud of her husband. Proud for his professional, and the main thing, his personal qualities.\n\nSomebody raised a toast: \"For the children and their bright future!\" To that Shpilberg, the bandmaster looking at the children next to Mikhail and Klavdia added, \"Someday Valera and Sasha may also become military conductors and will lead big military bands and not here in the periphery but in the capital of our Motherland, in Moscow!\" And everyone agreed to that. Who would have doubted the words of the bandmaster Shpilberg to be an oracle?\"\n\nMUSIC OR FOOTBALL?\n\n\"And, here it was! Dzhambul! Two military men met the Khalilov and Shpilberg families at the station.\"\n\n\"The families were accommodated in the garrison hostel for officers. The convenient location of the hostel next to the military unit allowed Mikhail to see his family even during lunch breaks, when his wife fed him and the children all sorts of delicious dishes.\n\nIn the fall of 1958, another pleasant event took place in the Khalilov family: their eldest son Valery was enrolled in the first grade of the general education school. Mikhail also insisted on his son being taught music, but Klavdia was trying hard to put off the decision. She thought he was still too young for music lessons. But in the end, dad won! In October, Valery was enrolled for class in piano at the School of Music in Dzhambul. Since one of Klavdia's strong arguments for waiting a bit longer before their daughter and son began to take piano lessons was the absence of a home piano to complete the practice assignments, Mikhail, with the help of his friends, bought in Dzhambul a musical instrument manufactured by Belarus Piano Factory and brought it to the officer's hostel. The manager, an elderly woman, at first strongly objected to having a piano in one of the rooms of the hostel. But, when Mikhail assured her that only his children would be practicing at strictly defined times and would never bother other people residing at the hostel, she sympathized with Mikhail and allowed him to bring the instrument into the room of the Khalilov family.\n\n\"Oh! It is so big! And black! exclaimed LyusyaValery's sister. \"Can we see what's inside it?\"\n\nAnd the first introduction of Valery and his older sister Lyudmila to the basics of music started with taking the piano apart. First, the top lid was opened and the bottom panel was removed to expose the hammer-action. To the delight of the children, the hammers hit the strings and produced a variety of sounds: from low bass to high, which Valery's sister immediately fell in love with. She carefully and quickly touched the keys on the keyboard with her two fingers in the upper octave, as if the birds were singing, making such unusual trills. And as for Valery, he, on the contrary, played in the lower octave. The result was an amazing combination of trills of birds and a heavy gait of a bear. They called mom to listen to their joint playing the piano. And Klavdia was the happiest person, rejoicing in her children's joy.\n\n\"That's it, my darlings, that's enough! Let's not bother our neighbours! You will take turns in practicing: first Lyusya, and then Valery.\" Dad began to assemble the piano, replacing the top and bottom panels of the musical instrument. \"Tomorrow we are going to the School of Music!\"\n\nAnd now Valery faced a dilemma. On the one hand, he was very fond of playing football with the local children on the barren stretch of land near the officer's hostel. Despite his young age, he very quickly made friends with them and, in his free time, whenever possible, played football for one team or another. The goal was made from anything available: schoolbags became goalposts, and Valery measured the goal of rivals with his steps. The football itself was an inflatable rubber car-tire inner tube, which was carefully pushed into a round bag made from pieces of leather manually stitched together. Then the inner tube was inflated with a pump, secured so that no air escaped, and this round structure was pulled together with a special cord. The result was a handmade football. At first, little Valery played in goal, but then, seeing how he dodged the rival players and even scored goals, the boys placed him on the midfield. And he was very proud of it! And now this music! It's alright if it is his sister. She likes music. But he is a boy! Why should he?\n\nAt first, Valery did like piano lessons with Anna Semenovna, an old-school teacher. She never ever raised her voice at her students. With careful attention and calm confidence she helped her students achieve better results. When talking to the Director of Studies at the School of Music, Mikhail Nikolayevich asked to enroll Valery and Lyudmila in piano lessons with the best teacher available.\n\n\"This conversation is between two musicians, and I kindly ask you.\" Mikhail realized that he asked too much and the Director of Studies could refuse the request: all children of the School of Music should be treated equally.\n\nBut the Director of Studies showed sympathetic understanding of the situation saying that not so often children of military band conductors come to learn music in their school. Moreover, his children attained sufficiently good results at entry exams.\"\n\n\"A home piano contributed positively in this regard. At that time it was considered a great luxury and only few families could afford it. But from the very beginning Mikhail wanted his children to pursue a musical career and was ready to cover all and any expenses necessary to achieve this. After all, children should not only take piano lessons but also practice at home. Without this, it is just impossible to become a good musician.\"\n\n\"And now this piano, big and black, which prevented Valery from playing football with his friends, had become his enemy. Each time the guys asked him to play football, Klavdia would tell them that Valery was practicing scales or learning a new piece of music. Yet, when his mother did not see him, the boy often managed to run away ... through the window to play football with his friends, since the Khalilov family lived on the ground floor of the officer's hostel. One day Klavdia complained to her husband that she could not cope with their son running away through the window, and Mikhail took the most radical measures: piano practicing must be at least two hours and a half per day.\"\n\n\"Before he got sent off to his new duty station, Captain Khalilov was informed of the Order of the Head of the Military Band Service of the Turkestan Military District to conduct a district contest of military bands, dedicated to the fortieth anniversary of the Soviet Army and Navy. Lieutenant Colonel Dolgov set a task for Mikhail Nikolayevich Khalilov to participate in this contest with his new team.\"\n\n\"It should be said that the musicians of the band responded with optimism to the proposal to show what they could do at the district contest of military bands and try to get a prize-winning place. The team turned out to be really friendly to match their new conductor and bandmaster. Captain Khalilov was fortunate with the military unit command. The regimental commander, Colonel Shapovalenko, had long asked the Turkestan Military District for a competent military band conductor, but what he received in response could be narrowed down to one word, that is, wait! And here he was at last. It was not a brand new lieutenant, fresh out of a military college, but a captain who had previously served in several remote garrisons of the Turkestan Military District with the necessary knowledge and skills to manage this specific military unit. With the arrival of Captain Khalilov military music sounded in the regiment, as they say, at full power from reveille to retreat. \"\n\n\"Mikhail Nikolayevich suggested that the regimental commander Colonel Shapovalenko conduct daily physical fitness exercises with the military band providing musical accompaniment. Moreover, he himself compiled a collection not only of \"fast\" (quick) military marches to accompany a morning run, but also music to accompany a set of free exercises, which were then introduced as part of the new physical fitness program for troops. Also, the military band played right after breakfast when all would line up in formation to start training lessons or to change the guard.\n\nThe preparations also began for a qualifying round of the district contest of military bands, where captain Khalilov certainly wanted to show the Commission the results of his work with the band musicians who were diligently learning new pieces of orchestral music.\"\n\n\"One day Captain Khalilov got a phone call from the Municipal Cultural and Educational College inviting him to come in for an interview. A gray-haired man greeted him in the office of the Director of the College and without any preparation offered him a teaching position in several musical disciplines: instrumental studies, instrumentation, and conducting.\n\n\"Nikolai Petrovich Dolgov recommended you as a competent and knowledgeable military band conductor\". Director of the College made inquiries about Khalilov in advance, and the professional musical community in Dzhambul was not too big: everyone knew each other. And everybody spoke about Khalilov not only as a good musician, but also as a reliable and honest officer. So, you can get to work tomorrow. The Director of Studies will give you the class schedule for your groups.\"\n\n\"Of course, I am very flattered to receive such an offer from you, but first of all I am an officer! And military service is a priority for me!\" Mikhail Nikolayevich began to decline. But Director had already made up his mind.\n\n\"Our College is located in the very centre of Dzhambul, in Lenin Square. And your lectures and classes are scheduled for the afternoon. Theoretically, you have enough time to get everywhere in time. It is only half an hour walk from the location of your military unit to the College. Come on, say yes.\" Director advanced more and more arguments in his favour. \"And you will be paid well for your work. Plus the opportunity to work in the College library, to prepare for postgraduate admission, and to write a research thesis. We have a wonderful music library where you can find many interesting materials. Say yes! Who will teach our students in the music department if not you?\"\n\nThe last argument was that Mikhail would be able to select students for a position in his band to enter the military service.\n\n\"There is no need to worry about this,\" the College Director assured Mikhail, \"the chief enlistment officer of Dzhambul is a good friend of mine. I think we will settle all questions related to students' draft service. So be it, then?\"\n\nMikhail Khalilov eventually agreed with the Director's arguments and asked for a week to settle this issue with the military unit command.\n\nA week had passed but Mikhail Nikolayevich was not able to talk to the regimental commander Colonel Shapovalenko about teaching at the Municipal Cultural and Educational College. He had never before faced an opportunity of engaging in creative work apart from his military service in the army. It should be said that at that time \"positions overlapping\" was not welcomed in the Soviet Army, so Mikhail was a little worried about a possible refusal. So, Captain Khalilov decided to proceed at his own risk.\"\n\n\"Several months had passed, during which Captain Khalilov was always at his best. During the first round of the district contest of military bands dedicated to the fortieth anniversary of the Soviet Army and Navy, the musicians showed the Commission headed by Lt. Col. Dolgov, the Head of the Military Band Service of the Turkestan Military District, their professionalism both in performing military music and their concert program. The Commission found it great that the military conductor Captain Khalilov himself perfectly performed Variations on Carnival of Venice by Jean Baptiste Arban (Jean Baptiste Arban (1825–1889) – French musician, composer, and teacher. He is the author of Great Complete Method for cornet and saxhorn (1864), which has been applied to this day for teaching and playing technique on the cornet and trumpet. – ed. note), showing a brilliant command of the trumpet.\n\nIt should be noted that Mikhail Nikolayevich insisted on the concert of the band being attended by all the personnel of the regiment, including their families. Sitting in the front row with members of the Commission from Moscow, the regimental commander Shapovalenko was able to see for himself that the band under his supervision was in Captain Khalilov's capable hands. Each performance of the musicians was accompanied by stormy and prolonged applause. Klavdia, who was also at the concert, sincerely rejoiced with the children for the band musicians and was once again proud of her husband, who conducted the group.\n\nAfter the concert, there was a lunch in the regimental commander's office to celebrate the success of the musicians' performance, where the chairman of the Moscow Commission, Lt. Col. M. M. Kazanov, informed the regimental commander about Captain Khalilov's plans to enroll in a postgraduate course of the military band conductors' department.\n\n\"Wait a minute, comrade lieutenant colonel! For three whole years I asked the military district command to send us a competent military band conductor. And when this finally has happened, do you want to take him to Moscow?\" The news really shocked the regimental commander.\n\n\"Dear Yuri Sergeyevich! Captain Khalilov will be one of several candidates for admission to postgraduate studies. At the same time, the entrance examinations will be very difficult, and to give an absolute guarantee of his admission to postgraduate studies at this point is something from the realm of fiction. It's the first thing!\" Lt. Col. Kazanov was offering a careful and well-reasoned answer to the regimental commander. \"Second. Captain Khalilov's admission to the adjuncture also depends on the results of the military band contest. So far, I can only say that we really like your band, and Captain Khalilov is really a drillmaster and an excellent military band conductor. Well, I would like to sincerely wish your band members to try to add to the accomplishments they have already achieved as there is yet another round of the contest, but this time in Tashkent. And there it will be a tough competition among military bands of the Turkestan Military District. Well, and the third most important thing. Lt. Col. Dolgov, the Head of the Military Band Service of the Turkestan Military District, is right here with us at this table. You can discuss with him personnel affairs if your officer is enrolled in a postgraduate course. The fact is that hypothetically at least another six months will pass from the time of passing the entrance exams to the beginning of his studies.\"\n\n\"It should be said that after the Commission had commended the band and its conductor for their achievements, the regimental commander developed even greater respect for Captain Khalilov.\"\n\n\"Now, the whole military band was rehearsing daily to get ready for the second round of the contest.\n\nThe band members did their best in the first round of the district contest of military bands and successfully passed to the second round.\"\n\n\"Captain Khalilov received a positive recommendation letter to enroll in a postgraduate study at the Institute of Military Band Conductors.\"\n\n\"In Captain Khalilov's file, the author found an interesting entry in his record of personal achievement: \"Captain Khalilov was awarded a diploma and a cash award of five hundred roubles in accordance with the order M 0133 of September 18, 1958 issued by the Commander of the Turkestan Military District for getting second place in the contest of military bands.\" As Mikhail Nikolayevich promised to the regimental commander Shapovalenko, in six months the band got second place in the contest of military bands of the entire Turkestan Military District.\"\n\nHOME, SWEET HOME!\n\n\"And in the meantime, life in the Khalilov's family went on as usual: Lusya and Valery would have breakfast in the morning and go to the elementary school to have lessons of Russian language and literature, mathematics, writing, and drawing. And after lunch, Lusya went with Valery, as his elder sister, to the Dzhambul School of Music. Nothing would have induced her to let her brother walk to school on his own, therefore she kept a tight hold on his hand.\"\n\n\"Summer vacations were a kind of motivation for children in the Khalilov family to learn school subjects and music. Some time in winter when spring was still far away, Klavdia was telling her children how they would go on summer vacations to their Grandma in the village; how they would swim in the river and go to the forest to pick mushrooms and berries. But this would happen if Lusya and Valery get at school only fives and fours (A's and B's) the highest marks. In this respect, the children envied their younger brother Sasha who, being preschool-aged, this condition did not apply to.\n\nMikhail Khalilov would not engage in such conversations, because he did not want his wife Klavdia and children leaving for the whole summer. But he knew perfectly well that three summer months in the open air with fresh cow milk and delicious meal cooked by their Grandma, Pelageya Sergeevna.\n\nThe mother of Valery Mikhailovich, Klavdia Vasilievna Vinogradova, was born in 1925 in the village of Novinki. The village of Novinki with only few houses was no more than 25 kilometers away from the town of Kirzhach, the administrative centre of the Kirzhach District in Vladimir Oblast. It must be said that before the revolution, every village in the Vladimir Uyezd (District) was engaged in its trade.\"\n\n\"Almost all the inhabitants of Novinki were cabinet-makers. Cabinet-makers were the elites who specialized in items of fine woodwork, as well as restoration of antique furniture, and therefore were considered highly paid workers compared to carpenters or joiners.\n\nIn 1925, two brothers, Vassily Yefimovich and Ivan Yefimovich Dmitriev, decided to build a house in Novinki for their families, with two separate entrances. In 1930, they moved to Moscow to work as cabinetmakers in one of the cooperatives specializing in furniture restoration.\"\n\n\"Later on, the Khalilov large family made this house in the village of Novinki their home.\n\nBeginning in 1956, Klavdia with three children stayed with Pelageya Sergeevna every summer.\n\nOf course, life in the village after a hot and sultry Dzhambul was for the children like a fairy tale. For days on end, they were swimming in the river, sunbathing in the sun, and fishing river perches, crucian carps, and roach. A small wooden bridge was thrown across the river, and they quite often jumped into the river from the bridge, much to the displeasure of the fishermen for frightening away the fish in the river. And also, Lyusya and Valery loved going to the forest for mushrooms and berries with their Mom and Grandma. Not a single time did they return from the forest with empty baskets. On the contrary, each of the children, having gathered a full basket of mushrooms and berries, tried to brag about the content of their baskets and earn praise from their Mom and Grandma.\n\nWell, then they were making a whole variety of jam: raspberry, pear, and apple. But most of all the children liked strawberry jam for a pink scum formed on top of it while boiling. From time to time, Grandma or Mom removed this scum with a spoon and put it on a saucer, and Valery and Lyusya spread it onto pieces of white bread. They called this delicacy \"homemade cakes\".\n\nNeedless to say, no matter how heavy, this homemade treat was taken back to Dzhambul at the end of the summer season for the dear husband and daddy. Often, traditional tea parties with various homemade jams were also open for band musicians and their families.\"\n\n\"While working in the library of the Cultural and Educational College, Mikhail Khalilov nearly completed his research thesis for postgraduate admission, which he entitled \"Musical Support for Ceremonial Events Provided by Soviet Army Bands\". In preparation for adjuncture, he also read many books about composers, current trends in music, about painting, and architecture. Klavdia was enjoying doting on her husband, who was keen on entering the post-graduate studies. And in his engineer regiment, he was now rightfully considered one of the most knowledgeable officers.\"\n\n\"However, preparing for admission to the postgraduate studies, Mikhail overlooked one important thing: each applicant had to obligatorily undergo a medical examination, and to get a conclusion: \"Healthy. Fit for military service.\" And then, medical tests showed the development of complications associated with the pituitary adenoma of the brain.\n\nOf course, Mikhail was aware of the problem: frequent episodes of headache have recurred recently.\"\n\nBut the problem was what conclusion the Army Physical Evaluation Board would make.\n\nAn so, instead of entrance exams, Mikhail Nikolayevich Khalilov was again hospitalized in the Tashkent Military District Hospital.\"\n\n\"His failure to pass medical examination to enter the adjuncture of the Military Band Conductor Department of the Moscow State Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky \"for health reasons\" was not too painful for Mikhail. After a course of hospital treatment, a real gift of fate for Captain Khalilov was rehabilitation leave, which he had already planned to spend with his family in the village of Novinki.\"\n\n\"After returning home from a hospital stay, Mikhail decided to make a present to his wife, which she had long asked for: a gramophone with a set of records.\"\n\n\"On Sundays, as a rule, the Khalilovs arranged a kind of \"musical hour\" with a gramophone, and Klavdia invariably put on a record with \"May in Blossom\" and invited her husband for a dance. And little Lyusya invited her younger brother Valery to dance with her, stealing glances at her parents, who looked at each other with love, while dancing the foxtrot unhurriedly and very smoothly. It seemed that this love of father and mother was in the air and was almost tangible. They looked at each other with loving tenderness from the first to the last sounds of the dance. With one hand, Michael held Klavdia's hand with special carefulness and the other he laid on her waist…\n\nWhen the gramophone appeared in the Khalilov's house, not a single party was complete without music. It became a good tradition to have tea parties with a gramophone playing some popular tune. Some guests would dance, others listen to music. It was then that Mikhail had begun pursuing a new hobby: collecting gramophone records.\"\n\n\"On the last evening before family departure for Mikhail to go through rehabilitation, band musicians came to their conductor for a traditional tea party with food and homemade jam.\"\n\n\"The guests enjoyed being engaged in dinner-time coversations or discussing local news in a warm friendly atmosphere of the evening.\n\n\"And now, dear friends, let's drink a toast.\" Klavdia smiled, and after a short pause while she was cheered by the guests, said: \"Dearest and closest friends of mine and my husband! Life moves so fast that we sometimes do not cherish what surrounds us. There is always such a rush that we are sometimes unfair to our families and colleagues and do them injustice. But each of you sitting here today has families, close people, work colleagues, and companions in the service. Let us make it so that each of us here does only good to men, does good deeds and never does ugly deeds!\"\n\nAfter a farewell tea party, guests listened to music, sang and danced.\"\n\n***\n\n\"Mikhail Khalilov's summer rehabilitation leave had passed like one day. He saw the happy eyes of his wife, his children swimming in the river, sunbathing or playing football on the sandy river bank, and he felt happy and relieved. He was slowly realizing the implications of the diagnosis, and after talking to a doctor, a friend of Pelageya Sergeevna, he finally accepted the situation. His discharge from the army was inevitable. When it would happen, in year or two at most, was the only question.\n\nMikhail's rehabilitation leave quickly came to an end. On the last evening before departure, the farewell dinner with Klavdia's relatives was on the terrace of the house. The children were enjoying jam, spreading it on bread, while the adults were talking about life, politics, and what was happening in the army. Viktor, the elder brother of Klavdia, of course, knew about Mikhail's illness.\n\n\"Misha, don't worry! Even if you are discharged from the army, look, how beautiful it is here! The nature alone is enough! What about the air? Clean air! Fresh! You will come here, and we will help you build a house for your family. Right, kids?\" Uncle Victor winked at the children sitting next to him, patting Valery on the back of his head.\n\n\"Yes, I have been thinking about this for a long time. Of course, we have to build our own house. It's not good to feel like your guests all the time!\" Mikhail he was straightforward with his brother-in-law. \"We will build our house! Well, if you help, I will be very grateful to you!\"\n\nNeedless to say about the continuous moral support that Mikhail received from his wife Klavdia during rehabilitation leave.\n\n\"Mishenjka, if you are discharged from the army, it's no big deal. On the contrary, our life will change for the better!\" often she would say.\n\n\"Our children will go to school in Moscow. Moscow is a huge city! And do you really think that for you there will be no work? We'll find a job for you! And not one if we try!\" Klaudia gently stroked her husband's hair.\n\n\"As my Mom used to stroke his hair when he was a little boy\", thought Mikhail, \"but what a coincidence: both his Mom and wife are called Klavdia! Coincidence? Probably not, it is rather fated to be. This is a sign from God.\"\n\nAt such moments, he was easy in his mind and felt at peace with himself ...\"\n\n***\n\n\"Returning to his regiment, Captain Khalilov learned that his military unit was subject to reduction.\"\n\n\"Don't get upset!\" The Head of the Personnel Department sat down next to Captain Khalilov. \"Now you have the opportunity to resign for reasons of health with holding the medical benefits of your original position and, most importantly, with your military pension and the privilege of obtaining an apartment at the place of future residence. Please, understand, this is the right solution considering your current situation!\"\n\n\"But I can't imagine my life without the Army, Comrade Major! The Army for me is meaning of life! Why don't you understand that?\" Captain Khalilov tried to object.\n\n\"Please, understand that now, while still relatively young, you can start a completely different civilian life! You have teachers' education, don't you? Do you know that secondary schools are facing the shortage of teachers?\" The Head of the Personnel Department was making convincing arguments. \"In addition, when you get discharged, you and your family move not to a remote provincial town, but to Moscow! When in Moscow, you are sure to find a job, and not one! And your children. Have you given a thought to them? They will go to regular school! And under normal climatic conditions, mind you, and not under conditions of agonizing fever, like here. And don't you dare to argue with me anymore! The decision about you has already been made by the command of the military district!\"\n\n\"Some time later, Captain Khalilov Mikhail Nikolayevich was pronounced unfit for active service and demobilized to be placed on the retired list (for reasons of health) at the Dzerzhinsky military registration and enlistment office in Moscow.\"\n\nMOSCOW DOES NOT BELIEVE IN TEARS\n\n\"And so the large Khalilov family moved to Moscow. At first, they lived in two rooms of Pelageya Sergeevna in the semi-basement eight-room apartment, which she shared with other people. These rooms were granted to her as an employee of the Hammer and Sickle Factory.\"\n\n\"As soon as Mikhail Khalilov arrived in Moscow, he phoned Grigory, the former cadet of the Tashkent School of Music, asking him to meet with him. And despite the fact that so many years had passed, Grigory Lazarevich, the bandmaster of the military band of Suvorov Military Music College in Moscow, recognized him and right away invited Mikhail Khalilov with his family to his home.\"\n\n\"Misha, where are you planning to send your son for studies?\" asked Grigory his classmate when they went out for a smoke. Mikhail replied that he had not yet thought about this issue.\n\n\"And how wrong it is! We should start thinking now!\" Grigory conspiratorially winked at him. \"I was advised to enroll my Volodjka at the cadet school! You know that after the reduction of military music schools throughout the country, one school still remained. It is in the village of Troitse-Lykovo in Serebryany Bor. It is here, near Moscow. I want my Volodjka to study there and become a military band conductor, since I have not had a chance!\"\n\n\"And what is the entry age?\" asked Mikhail showing interest.\n\n\"Aged 11, just as it was with us! There is still time, but I'd rather your son choose a wind instrument now. My Volod'ka has recently started practicing the clarinet. And even has made some progress!\" Grigory would very much like for his son to enter the School of Music not alone, but with someone he knew well. \"It would be great if your son followed in your footsteps. Seryoga Kruglov called me a month ago, do you remember him? He told me that you were demobilized for health reasons. Is it really so?\"\n\n\"Yes, Grisha, all true.\"\n\n\"Have you given a thought to what you might be doing?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have, but in such a big city where I know nobody to turn to for help...\" Mikhail carefully put out his cigarette in the ashtray\n\n\"Don't worry about that, I know very well the Director of the Teachers' Training School of Music Education named after the October Revolution.\" Grigory had already thought over this issue and even had met with the Director of the School. \"He needs a professional to be his deputy. I told him about you, and we are having a meeting with him next week. And do not argue with me! This is a done deal! Well, shall we go back? They are tired of waiting for us.\"\n\nAnd the friends went back to where their families were. Nina Ivanovna, the hostess, was cutting the large cake of the day that she had made for the guests into pieces.\n\n***\n\n\"Upon their arrival in Moscow, Mikhail Nikolayevich took his children Lyusya and Valery to the Children's Music School No.7 of the Kirovsky district in Georgy Dimitrov Street (now Yakimanka), where the children were enrolled in the 4th grade and 2nd grade, respectively. At that time, the Children's Music School No. 7 (Now the Children's Music School named after R.M. Glier) was practically in the very centre of the capital and was rightfully considered a prestigious school. Graduates of the School entered the leading music schools of Moscow and Leningrad to become famous musicians of our country. Mikhail Nikolayevich asked the Director of the School to enroll Valera in a clarinet class, and his eldest daughter Lyusya in a flute class.\n\nNow in their shared apartment, different musical instruments sounded. The children took turns practicing. First Lyusya would learn flute scales and etudes, then Valera would practice hard the clarinet range in the first octave. Wind instrument practicing was followed by piano studies on the piano that was moved from the last place of the last duty station of their Daddy. When Mikhail had a headache, the children were practicing in the corridor of the shared apartment.\"\n\n\"Not long after, Mikhail met with A.L. Loginov, Director of the Teachers' Training School of Music Education. Having vast experience in managing his educational institution, Alexander Leonidovich immediately understood that Mikhail was the right person to be entrusted with an important area of responsibility, that is, more simply, his deputy for administrative and maintenance issues. He needed an absolutely honest person, who would never slip his hand in in the state's purse. Moreover, the new candidate for the post of his deputy was a former military man, which means he was highly disciplined and efficient. Plus, he was also a communist, capable of leading the party organization of the School.\"\n\n\"Director was also impressed by Mikhail's modesty: \"He never mentioned that he lives with his mother-in-law in a shared apartment with three young children. And he does not compain about his fate, like his other employees, asking for housing improvement. But he, as a former military man, really has the right to a new flat as demobilized for the reasons of health. However, he places no conditions and asks for nothing. He just asked for hours at the School, and that's it.\"\n\nDirector of the School was reflecting on the talk with Mikhail.\n\n\"Of course, Mikhail Nikolayevich! I understand you very much, to serve as a band conductor for so many years! And you have experience in teaching?\" Loginov wanted to learn more about his would-be deputy during their first conversation.\n\n\"Yes, Alexander Leonidovich. I was teaching instrumental studies, instrumentation, and score reading at the Music Department of the Cultural and Educational College in Dzhambul. And I managed a brass band of students. Also, I taught further training courses for amateur brass band conductors. Here, by the way, is a reference from the College.\" Mikhail handed Loginov the reference he received on his last day of work in Dzhambul.\n\n\"Then you can start tomorrow!\" The director was quite comfortable with the conversation with his would-be deputy. \"Your class schedule you can develop with Inna Petrovna, the Curriculum Director. But I must immediately warn you that you are supposed to teach no more than twelve hours a week. Believe me, your day here will be scheduled down to the half-minute, and your workload, even without classes, will be more than enough for a working day. Well, your teaching activity is your right, but only as an hour job.\"\n\nOn the way home, Mikhail sincerely thanked Grigory for the confidence and support in finding a new job.\"\n\n\"Klavdia was beside herself with joy when she heard from her husband about his new job. He would be not just an ordinary teacher but the Deputy Ddirector of the school! On that occasion, a new dark-coloured suit, several white shirts and a bunch of ties were purchased in the nearby department store. It was rather unusual for Mikhail, who was to wear the uniform almost all his life, to put on a brand new civilian suit. But Klavdia insisted:\n\n\"Misha! You are now beginning, what is called, a second life, where, as the saying goes, you are judged by appearances at first but by your mind later. Therefore, you you should meet the challenge.\n\nIn the evening, Klavdia ironed special creases down the new trousers, ironed new shirts, knotted ties, and hung them all in the closet...\n\nThe Khalilov family could not be happier when a few months later with great solemnity A.L. Loginov handed Mikhail Nikolayevich a warranty of title to a new apartment.\"\n\n\"It was a separate two-room flat on the first floor of the new building built by Metrostroy Construction Company in Kazansky Pereulok (Lane), next to the French Embassy.\n\n***\n\n\"The school year was coming to an end, and Sergey Petrovich Bessmertnov, who had taught the clarinet at the Children's Music School No.7 for more than a decade, tried to devote as much attention as possible to his pupils to prepare them for their end-of-year exams. Even though he was a soloist of the Bolshoi Theater, his sense of professional duty did not allow him to show negligence in teaching his little pupils. As so many times before Valera Khalilov was playing his end-of-year exam programme to the piano accompaniment, while Sergey Petrovich was listening. The end-of-year exam programme included only two short musical compositions differing in character. It took the teacher quite a while to select from the long list of music those two pieces of music that best suited to the boy. The choice fell on two seemingly simple compositions, a clarinet reduction of Mozart's \"Spring Song\" and Aram Khachaturian's \"Andantino\". The first composition was full of cheerfulness and vivacity, while the second, on the contrary, was slow, lyrical, and dreamy.\n\n\"Valery, imagine a spring garden in full bloom! Blooming lilacs, for example!\" said Sergey Petrovich at the lesson, rubbing his chin out of habit. \"Feel the words translated from German \"Come, oh May, and the trees will blossom again!\" You know, after winter nature looks different, it is being born anew! After all, it was not in vain that in ancent Russia the year began in spring, not in winter, as it is now.\"\n\nValery, of course, was not used to such reasoning. In Dzhambul, he liked the morning coolness of the mountain ranges, the birds singing, and the sound of the rushing water from the aryk (irrigation ditch) near their house. And here? Mozart, some German composer, is singing about his spring? What does he know about it? And how can a German nation even exist after Hitler started such a war? All over Europe! In fact, all over the world! How many people died in that war! Take even grandma Pelageya: she got her husband buried, her brother, uncle did not return from the war. But he agreed in some way with his first teacher, who was not only a soloist of the Bolshoi Theater, but also taught at the School of Music named after Ippolitov-Ivanov. Moreover, Sergey Petrovich was the winner of one of the most prestigious international clarinet competitions in Budapest. And you won't become a laureate of international competitions for granted. You need to be one of the best clarinetists in the Soviet Union.\n\n\"All right, Sergey Petrovich. I can really imagine a flowering May garden.\" Valery thought a little, looked out the window and said: \"Sergey Petrovich, Do you know what I want most? I ddo want my dad to recover, and I also want to go to the village! You do not know how it is beautiful in Kirzhach! What trees are there! What mushrooms and berries! What a wonderful nature!\n\n\"That's it, Valery! Imagine your village when you play at the exam! That very garden with apple and pear trees. The river, where you swim with your friends in summer. You got that?\" Sergey Petrovich was very pleased that he had found a visual image for Valery, which was sure to help him at the exam.\n\nAnd indeed, the eminent teacher's efforts were not in vain! At the end-of-year exam, Valery played with confidence the both pieces of music, and all the members of the board of examiners made special mention of his musicality and recommended him to perform at the school's end-of-year concert. For any student it is not only a matter of great pride, but also a great responsibility.\n\nAfter the concert, which took place in the spacious concert hall of the Music School, Sergei Petrovich came up to Valery's parents to congratulate them on the successful performance of their son:\n\n\"Dear Klavdia Vassilievna and Mikhail Nikolayevich! I could not help approaching you after the concert to thank you for your son Valery! Your child has the potential to succeed in music! He is gifted with the ability to understand music and possesses a wonderful sense of rhythm! He is very much like his father, that is, you, Mikhail Nikolayevich!\" The teacher sincerely praised his student after a successful performance. \"By the way, in addition to the School of Music, I teach at the Teachers' Training School of Music Education named after Ippolitov-Ivanov, and believe me, your boy has a gtreat future! If he is determined to continue practising music, then later on I will be in my class. He has a potential to become a famous clarinet player!\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, Sergey Petrovich, for complimenting our son! Valery is trying hard and is happy to go to your lessons.\" Mikhail Khalilov also liked Valery's teacher very much. \"We do want our boy to pursue a career as a wind musician!\"\n\n\"And with luck, Valerochka will continue our family dynasty of military band conductors!\" Klavdia Vassilievna finished the thought of her husband.\n\nThen Valery together with his parents went to the classroom, where he wrote down the teacher's assignments for the summer: what to learn, which etudes to review. At that time, the School of Music provided wind instruments for free, and many children could continue practising during summer vacations. And these are three months after all! Valery was set on practising the clarinet and learning new music while in the village since he would have for that during his summer vacations.\n\nIt must be said that annual trips of the whole family in early summer were planned in advance. It was necessary to pack all the necessary things: clothes, kitchen utensils, bedclothes, mattresses, blankets, pillows, etc. But, most importantly, it was necessary to stoke up with food. In the village, fresh bread was sold only to working collective farmers, so Grandma Pelageya dried rusks during winter and stored them in canvas bags. Then, when back in the village, she put them in a colander and under the action of steam rusks turned into real bread.\"\n\n\"As a result, sometimes luggage and food were as much as three hundred kilograms. Therefore, at the end of spring, Mikhail Nikolayevich would go to the canteen, where truck drivers worked to ask someone of them to take his family to the village. And imagine, no one had ever refused to help him.\n\nThe driver carefully covered with the canvas both the people and the belongings so as not to attract inquisitive eyes and, most importantly, the traffic police. But during the trip, the curiosity of the children took the upper hand, and Lyusya and Valery from time to time looked out from under the canvas cover and got a chance to look at the scenery they were passing by. Valery was very fond of exposing his face to the browing wind, feeling like either a captain of some foreign going ship or a pilot.\n\nMuch to the children's regret, Daddy stayed with the family in the village for a short while. In the opinion of the children, his vacation ended too quickly. He would spend a week at most with his wife and children, and then would pick up some car passing by that would take him back to his work.\"\n\n\"Klavdia Vassilievna, on the contrary, could devote herself entirely to the children during these beautiful summer months. It was with her that children often went mushrooming and berry-picking in the woods; she was there when they were swimming in the river; and they went fishing together. Mom was that attentive audience when Valery every morning was trying hard to elicit long sounds from the clarinet and to play the scales as his teacher's summer assignment.\"\n\n\"Valery's practising sessions attracted all the children in the village, who with a curious look came up to the Khalilovs' house and listened to Valera learning his new musical compositions. Surprisingly, sounds of the clarinet attracted not only people, but also their pets, the dog Pushok and the cat Barsik, who were also taken out of the Moscow flat to the village for the whole summer. The former circus dog Pushok, who compassionate Klavdia picked up in the street, would start dancing on his hind legs, and the cat Barsik would lie down at Valery's feet and purr with pleasure. But this would continue only until Valery played, for example, Khachaturian's \"Adagio\" in the first octave. As soon as the melody, when repeated, would be performed an octave higher, Barsik would rush out of the room to retreat to the farther corner of another room. Contrary to the dog, the clarinet's sounds in the upper octave were unbearable for the cat!\n\nThe children were sleeping on the heated Russian stove, but before falling asleep, Mom would read them a fairy tale: about Tsar Saltan, about the Golden Fish, and about the Sleeping Princess. But most of all, Lyusya enjoyed listening to the fairy tale about the Snow Queen, in which brave Gerd saved her beloved brother Kai, undergoing various trials, while traveling to different countries. Gerd was not afraid of anything in an effort to save Kai: neither of the old woman who wanted her to forget about her past life, nor the terrible evil robbers, nor the Snow Queen herself. And deep in her heart, Lyusya dreamed about how her brother would somehow save her. And it really happened.\n\nEvery day, Lyusya and Valery took a three-liter can and walked to the nearest village of Khmelevo to get fresh milk. The local woman had two cows and was glad to sell milk. It took a long time to get to Khmelevo. They walked along the country road with rye growing on both sides. And suddenly a bull came out of nowhere! And the bulls were then prone to head-butting. The children ran away from the bull along the road. The bull ran after them, bending its head with large horns. Valery managed to shout to Lyusya to run into the rye, and continued to run straight ahead trying to attract the attention of the bull, thereby rescuing his sister. Then he also dived into the saving thickets of rye, where he was out of reach. It was a pity that when running, Lyusya fell to the ground spilling half a can of milk onto the ground. But she was really proud that her brother Valery saved her from the bull, since the end of that story could have been different.\"\n\nAT THE CROSS-ROADS\n\nThe year of study at the School of Music was for the Khalilovs like no time had passed. Several times Mikhail met with Grigory, and each time, while discussing some news at work, they were sure to talk about their children and their prospects for entering the Moscow Military Music School.\n\n\"I've spoken to Colonel Gulyaev. The enrollment of our sons in the School of Cadets is a family tradition that needs to be maintained! We, so speak, contribute to the future of our profession!\" Grigory said with a contented look. \"But the fact is that our sons must score only good and excellent marks in entrance exams. Viktor Ivanovich told me in confidence that the number of applicants is far outnumbering the available seats, so there are twenty applications per seat.\" \"And how many seats are available in the class?\" Mikhail asked.\n\n\"Misha, you won't believe it, but I asked Colonel Gulyaev the same question.\" Grigory nervously lit a cigarette. \"His past experience suggests that not more than twenty-five. A simple arithmetic, and that's it!\"\n\nGregory still felt uneasy because of this uncertainty and guesswork whether his Volodjka pass or not pass the entrance exams. And again, he'd like Mikhail's son to enter school. Still, it would be better for them to be together, and there is no denying the fact that they could always stand up for each other, if anyone wanted to treat them badly.\n\nThe enrollment rules of the Moscow Military Music School required an applicant's file that included his academic performance evaluation, references from general education school, as well as music school, and an applicant's autobiography written by himself, be reviewed first by the Admissions Committee. This was the information to produce the first impression about an applicant.\n\nCaptain David Erastovich Devdaryani was one of the Admissions Committee members and an officer-tutor. Since his seventh-year cadets were going to graduate, he was the one who would provide tutorship to the new enrollments during their next seven years of schooling. That's why he carefully reviewed all the applicants' files trying to form some ideas about one or another young applicant from few lines in their too short life histories and reference letters. Captain Devdaryani was a war-veteran, who fought on the Leningrad Front. He was the commissar and then the commander of the reconnaissance platoon of the partisan detachment \"Voroshilovets\" of the 2nd partisan brigade. He had not only rich combat experience, but also the experience as the partisan force commander, and there were times when sheer force of order did not work and it was necessary to convince by setting a personal example.\"\n\n\"While reviewing applicants' files, sure enough his excellent visual memory helped him remember both his colleagues, Captain Mikhail Khalilov and Sergeant Grigory Lazarevich, who were only two classes below him at the School of Military Bandmasters. Their sons had not only positive references from school, but also had certificates of completion in clarinet (three year programme), a wind musical instrument, which gave an advantage when enrolling in a military music school.\"\n\n***\n\n\"On the day of the entrance exams, Valera arrived with his parents at the Moscow Military Music School. For the boy it was all a new experience: a long trolleybus ride past identical wooden houses hidden behind the high green fences of departmental summer cottages of Serebryanyi Bor, and a walk along a special pontoon bridge connecting the two banks of the Moscow River to get from Serebryanyi Bor to Troitse-Lykovo, where at that time was the school.\n\nAfter registering with the duty officer at the checkpoint, the Khalilovs went further to the School Headquarters. It was a harsh winter day. Linden trees along the alley were all covered with snow. Some of the branches bent with the weight of the snow, and Valera felt an urge to gently shake off this snow to bring relief to the trees. He also noticed that the entire linden alley was bare of snow and sprinkled with sand suggesting an army style order in a place that would seem to be nothing like a military unit.\n\nIn the corridor of the second floor of the wooden building, several pretty much the same boys as Valera were sitting near the office of the Head of the Moscow Military Music School, Colonel Arkadii Nikolayevich Myakishev. Grigory Lazarevich was there with his son Volodya. It was obvious that all the boys sitting on the chairs with their parents for the first time in their lives had found themselves in a totally alien environment of army discipline and order. On the door of the office there was a list of names, according to which candidates were called in. Parents were allowed to be present at the examination, but only with their child consent.\n\n\"Applicant Khalilov! Come in!\" Somebody called in from behind the door, and the Khalilovs, as if by mutual consent, went into the office all together. Several officers were sitting at the table. Though Colonel Myakishev headed the Admissions Committee, he decided to authorize Lt. Col. V.Ya. Volkov, his deputy and Head of the Curriculum and Instruction Branch, to conduct the preliminary admission examination, thus remaining in the background and monitoring the situation from the sidelines, so to speak.\"\n\n\"Lt. Col. Volkov played a dominant chord to check Valera's ability to guess a group of notes played simultaneously. Without any difficulty Valera not only figured out that four notes were played, but carefully sang them individually.\n\n\"Good, Valery! And now tell me: what would you like to sing? For pleasure, one might say. Which song do you like best?\" Captain Devdaryani asked.\n\n\"Frankly, my mother and I were preparing one of the revolutionary songs: \"Far Away, Beyond the River\" or \"Rush Forward, Our Engine!\" Valera decided to be honest with this friendly captain, with oriental features. \"But to be truthful to the end, I like a completely different song ... about birds. But I was not practicing it ...\" Valera suddenly looked embarrassed, but then regained his self-control: \"But my Mum really likes it.\"\n\n\"Fear not, dzhigit (skilful horseman)!\" The captain flicked his grey-streaked black forelock away from his eyes. \"Sing it, if you like the song! Sing for us and your Mum! And he turned to Valera's parents and winked.\"\n\n\"Valery Khalilov started to sing in a thin voice putting his heart into his singing. He was imagining birds flying to distant lands and looking for \"tropical countries\", whereas he stayed with his country, with his Homeland! (\"The Migrant Birds Are Flying\" was written in 1948 by the composer M. Blanter and the poet M. Isakovsky. It gained immense popularity with people right after its first performance by Vladimir Bunchikov in early 1949)\"\n\n\"Valery finished the last verse.\n\n\"Well done, Khalilov! It was very sincere! Wasn't it, Comrade Colonel?\" Captain Devdaryani addressed Colonel Myakishev.\n\n\"Yes, pretty good! Your boy has got the makings of a good musician,\" Colonel Myakishev told the parents and Captain Devdaryani and glanced inquiringly at Lt. Col. Gulyaev.\n\nHe smiled back and nodded in agreement with the other members of the Admissions Committee, writing something down in his notebook.\n\nAs a result of the preliminary audition, Valera and Vladimir were to be examined in early July.\"\n\nCADET SCHOOL ENROLLMENT\n\n\"The meeting on entrance examination of applicants held in the office of the Head of the Military Music School was coming to an end when Colonel Myakishev drew the attention of Major Mikhail Vladimirovich Yegnarov of the Medical Corps to the fact that the number of poor-fit candidates, who were screened out for health reasons, was very small on the first day of the exams.\n\n\"I believe all of them cannot be healthy. We have two hundred and forty applications for twenty seats available meaning that only the best must be admitted. Do you all understand this?\" Colonel Myakishev was very fond of this kind of meetings. He could slowly express his thoughts, while all his subordinates were supposed to listen to him, without interrupting him and nodding approval or agreement.\n\n\"Yes, but ...\" Major Yegnarov seemed about to object and straightened his glasses, \"they all have been physically qualified as fit at the military registration and enlistment office.\"\n\n\"Do not interrupt the senior, Comrade Major!\" It would be better for you to review again all the medical records of the candidates!\" Colonel Myakishev did not like to be objected, especially in the presence of his deputies. \"We are granted quite a privilege to start military parades. And not just somewhere, but on the Red Square! This means that each candidate must be in perfect bodily health and as tall as ... one hundred and forty centimetres.\"\n\nMajor Yegnarov no longer wanted to object to the Head of the School, and he nodded agreement, although everything inside him protested: \"How is that?! And if a boy is a born musician? So what if he is not as tall as he could be? Our decision can make or break him. And this decision to screen out a candidate for health reasons is supposed to be mine.\" He was trapped but it was necessary to address this situation, so when he returned to the medical service unit, he asked Vera Petrovna, a nurse on duty, to bring him health records of those candidates whose height was less than the stated 140 centimetres. Then, Major Yegnarov lit a cigarette, shut the door of his office tightly, and began to review the health records, which Vera Petrovna piled on his desk\n\n\"How does it go in Ilf and Petrov's novel? \"That's the way it is. Fate plays with man, and man plays the trumpet,\" Mikhail Vladimirovich mused and opened the first health record from the pile. Two naive eyes were looking at him from the photo in the upper-left corner. The boy's hair was cut short with a short forelock in front.\n\n\"Height – 138 centimetres, weight – 36 kilograms.\" The thought flitted through his mind quite mechanically: \"The surname does not sound Russian: Khalilov, although features are Slavic. Place of birth: town of Termez. Dad, definitely a military band conductor, serves in the Turkestan military district, which is far from being the most prestigious with hot climate conditions. For a child to live there is not all sugar and honey! Undoubtedly the parents do hope that their son will make it through the admission process and be enrolled in our School. That, at last, he will study in Moscow. And we have to screen out a candidate who is a poor fit?! And all because of what? Just because your boy is not tall enough! First, let him grow up a little! And then! Do you call this a valid reason? Okay, let's address issues as they arise,\" the Major mused closing the boy's health records...\n\nCaptain Devdaryani examined the boys in front of him. This was the first time they were standing in a line on the drill ground. Early July, a total of 240 boys came from various parts of the Soviet Union to Moscow to enroll in the Moscow Military Music School. And now these 240 pairs of children's eyes, for the first time in their lives deprived of moral support of their near and dear ones, inquisitively studied this captain with oriental features facing them. During exams, the fate of each of them now depended on him.\n\n\"So boys!\" I'll start with the main point. Today, a completely different life starts for you. From now on you're to follow a strict daily routine. All of you will reside in the quarters of the first company that you've seen nearby the ruined church. There is enough space for everyone. I promise! Now I introduce my deputies to you. These are company sergeants: Warrant O"
