        "text": "Education\n\nBorn in Kazan, he graduated from the Kazan Suvorov Military School (1971–1973), the Kazan Higher Tank Command School named after the Supreme Soviet of the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (1973–1977), the Malinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy (1984–1987), and the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia (1995–1997).\n\nCommands\n\nAfter graduating from the Kazan Higher Tank Command School Gerasimov was the commander of a platoon, company and battalion of the Far Eastern Military District. Later he was chief of staff of a tank regiment and then of a motorized rifle division in the Baltic Military District. From 1993 to 1995 he was the commander of the 144th Guards Motor Rifle Division in the Baltic Military District and then the North Western Group of Forces.\n\nAfter he graduated from the General Staff's academy he was First Deputy Army Commander in the Moscow Military District and commander of the 58th Army in the North Caucasus Military District during the Second Chechen War. His involvement in the arrest of Yury Budanov led to praise from journalist Anna Politkovskaya.\n\nIn 2006 he became commander of Leningrad Military District and moved to be the commander of Moscow Military District in 2009 and Central Military District in April 2012. On 23 December 2010 he became deputy Chief of the General Staff.\n\nHe commanded the Victory Day parades in Moscow four times: 2009 to 2012.\n\nAppointment\n\nGerasimov was appointed Chief of General Staff following the dismissal of Defence Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov on 6 November 2012. The previous Chief of General Staff, Army General Nikolay Makarov, was seen as close to Serduykov and was seen by commentators as likely to be replaced by new Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu. It has been reported that Makarov resigned, but he was formally dismissed by President Vladimir Putin. Other changes were the dismissal of Alexander Sukhorukov from the position of First Deputy Defence Minister and his replacement by Colonel General Arkady Bakhin, formerly commander of the Western Military District. Aerospace Defence Forces commander Colonel General Oleg Ostapenko was also promoted to Deputy Defence Minister. He was promoted to the highest rank in the Russian Army, General of the Army as of 2014. On September 15, 2016 he and Turkish chief of staff General Hulusi Akar conducted a meeting on the future of Syria in the Ankara headquarter of the army. That meeting will possibly result in tightened dealings between Russia and Turkey.\n\nSanctions\n\nIn April 2014 Gerasimov was added to the list of persons against whom the European Union introduced sanctions \"in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine\".\n\nAwards\n\nOrder of Military Merit\n\nMerit for Motherland (4th grade)\n\nMerit for Motherland in the USSR Armed Forces (3rd grade).\n\nMedal for Battle Merit\n\nJubilee Medal \"60 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR\"\n\nJubilee Medal \"70 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR\"\n\nMedal For Valour 1st Class\n\nMedal \"For strengthening of brotherhood in arms\"\n\nMedal For \"200 years to the Ministry of Defence\"\n\nMedal For \"20 Years of Impeccable Service\"\n\nMedal For \"15 Years of Impeccable Service\"\n\nMedal For \"10 Years of Impeccable Service\"\n\nOrder of the Friendship of Peoples\n\nPersonal life\n\nHe is married and has a son."
