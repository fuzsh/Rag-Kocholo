With an estimated death toll in excess of a million, the bloodletting at Stalingrad far exceeded that of Verdun, one of the costliest battles of World War I. The analogy with Verdun was not lost on German and Soviet soldiers who fought at Stalingrad. As they described the “hell of Stalingrad” in their private letters, some Germans saw themselves trapped in a “second Verdun.” Many Soviet defenders meanwhile extolled Stalingrad, a city with a prehistory of bloody warfare, as their “Red Verdun,” vowing never to surrender it to the enemy. But, as a Soviet war correspondent reporting from Stalingrad in October 1942 remarked, the embattled city differed from Verdun: it had not been designed as a stronghold and it possessed no fortresses or concrete shelters. The line of defense passes through waste grounds and courtyards where housewives used to hang out the laundry, across the tracks of the narrow gauge railway, through the house where an accountant lived with his wife, two children and aging mother, through dozens of similar houses, through the now deserted square and its mangled pavement, through the park where just this past summer lovers sat whispering to one another on green benches. A city of peace has become a city of war. The laws of warfare have placed it on the front line, at the epicenter of a battle that will shape the outcome of the entire war. In Stalingrad, the line of defense passes through the hearts of the Russian people. After sixty days of fighting the Germans now know what this means. “Verdun!” they scoff. This is no Verdun. This is something\n\nnew in the history of warfare. This is Stalingrad.1 Lasting six months, the battle also unfolded as a global media war. From the very beginning observers on all sides were fixated on the gigantic clash at the edge of Europe, heralding it a defining event of World War II. The fight for Stalingrad would become the “most fateful battle of the war,” a Dresden paper wrote in early August 1942, just when Hitler’s soldiers were preparing their assault on the city. The British Daily Telegraph used virtually the same terms in September. In Berlin, Joseph Goebbels read the papers of Germany’s enemies attentively. The battle of Stalingrad, the Nazi propaganda chief declared with a nod to the British daily, was a “question of life or death, and all of our prestige, just as that of the Soviet Union, will depend on how it will end.”2 Starting in October 1942, Soviet newspapers regularly cited western reports that extolled the heroism of the soldiers and civilians defending the city against Germany’s mechanical warriors. In pubs throughout England the radio would be turned on for the start of the evening news only to be turned off after the report on Stalingrad had aired: “Nobody wants to hear anything else,” a British reporter noted. “All they talk about is Stalingrad, just Stalingrad.”3 Among the Allied nations, people euphorically commented on the performance of the Soviets at Stalingrad. This sentiment not only reflected the spirit of the antifascist alliance; it also owed to the fact that the western Allied soldiers could not offer any comparable feats: for over a year the British army had suffered defeat after defeat.4 In November, a Soviet counterattack trapped more than 300,000 German and Axis soldiers in the Stalingrad pocket, or Kessel. German media abruptly stopped reporting on the battle and did not resume until late January 1943, when Nazi leaders realized they could not pass over the rout of an entire German army in silence. They cast the battle as one of heroic self-sacrifice, fought by German soldiers defending Europe against a superior Asian enemy. The propaganda of fear, reinforced by appeals to German citizens to embrace total war, worked imperfectly. The German security police reported that people spoke of the last bullet, which they would save for themselves once “everything was over.”5 One German official undertook particular precautions in the wake of Stalingrad: SS Chief Heinrich Himmler visited the Treblinka death camp in eastern Poland in early March 1943. He urgently instructed the camp authorities to exhume all the\n\nbodies of the 700,000 Jews who had been killed there and cremate the corpses.6 For the next months until Treblinka was shut down, camp workers carried out their grim task while continuing to kill on a reduced scale. Himmler’s order grew out of an awareness that a time of reckoning for Germany was drawing near.7 While it would be another year and a half before the Red Army liberated the camps in Poland, the battle on the Volga disrupted the Nazi death machine. The Dresden newspaper was right, if for the wrong reasons: Stalingrad did mark a turning point in world history.\n\nAs long as the battle was raging, no foreign correspondents in Moscow were allowed to travel to Stalingrad. Secretive and distrustful, the Soviet authorities waited until February 4, 1943, before bringing in a first batch of international reporters—British, Americans, French, Czechs, Chinese.8 Among them was Paul Winterton, who aired this report for the BBC: The streets of Stalingrad, if you can give the name to open spaces between ruins, still bear all the marks of battle. There’s the usual litter of helmets and weapons, stacks of ammunition, papers flattering in the snow, pocketbooks from dead Germans, and any number of smashed corpses, lying where they fell, or stacked up in great frozen heaps for later burial. Stalingrad can never be repaired. It will have to be rebuilt from the beginning. But even though all its buildings are wrecked there is life in it still. Along the narrow stretch of cement, which the Russians held through long months of assault, there is a city of dugouts—dugouts occupied by the soldiers who have not yet left, and by a few women who stayed behind to launder and cook for the men. There is a real party atmosphere among these people today. They are the proudest men and women I’ve ever seen. They know they’ve done a terrific job, and they’ve done it well. Their city has been destroyed, but they have smashed the invader by sheer stubbornness and unconquerable courage. These men and women fought and worked for months, with their backs to the river that they had sworn never to retreat across, facing an enemy who held the only dominating height in Stalingrad and who pounded them with shells and mortars, unceasingly by day and night. They clung\n\nto their narrow foothold, and their feet never slipped.9 Winterton opened with a panoramic account of the city and the detritus of war and then moved to what interested him and other journalists most: the defenders of Stalingrad. To Winterton, it was Russian “stubbornness and unconquerable courage” that decided the outcome of the battle; Alexander Werth, a reporter for the London Times, celebrated Red Army soldiers’ “extraordinary [ . . . ] individual achievements,” and for New York Times correspondent Henry Shapiro, Stalingrad symbolized the “triumph of men over metal”—Soviet men over German metal, to be exact.10 Valuable as these reports are as repositories of wartime views and emotions, they are also perfunctory and one-sided. The foreign correspondents were given only a quick tour of Stalingrad, and their Soviet guides were keen for them to meet the captured German generals rather than talk with Soviet citizens.11 The journalists touring the battleground in February 1943 did not know that more than a month earlier, a delegation of historians from Moscow had begun a large-scale project to document for posterity the voices of the Stalingrad defenders. They belonged to the Commission on the History of the Great Patriotic War, which had been founded by Isaak Mints, a professor at Moscow State University. The historians arrived in Stalingrad in late December 1942, and they took up their work on January 2, 1943. They visited various locations along the front line running through the embattled city: the steelworks in the north, General Vasily Chuikov’s command post, the Beketovka settlement at Stalingrad’s southern edge. In trenches and bunkers they spoke with commanders, officers, and soldiers of the Red Army. A stenographer accompanying them transcribed the interviews. The historians had to leave Stalingrad on January 9, a day before the Red Army began its final offensive, and they returned in February to resume their work just days after the Germans surrendered. In the following weeks and months, they conducted many one-on-one interviews, eventually collecting 215 eyewitness accounts: from generals, staff officers, troop commanders, simple foot soldiers, commissars, agitators, sailors of the Volga Military Flotilla, nurses, and a number of civilians—engineers, laborers, and a cook among them—who worked in the bombed-out city or were just struggling to survive there. Their interviews bring the reader close to the battle and paint a vivid picture of the actions, thoughts, and feelings of the Soviet participants that is unique\n\namong known sources. Soldiers spoke off the cuff about their lives, delivering rich and colorful descriptions (some in vernacular idiom) with the immediacy of an audio recording. The interviewees talked about their hometowns, how they ended up in Stalingrad, and their assignments. Candid and firsthand, authentic and nuanced, they described moments of terror and exhilaration, discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet military leadership, boasted of the honors they received, and depicted the deeds of heroes and cowards. These interviews are also unique in that many of the participants fought side by side and mention each other by name. Regarded as a whole, the interviews convey a unity of place, time, and action, the likes of which are found only in literature. The historians went about their work systematically. In some cases they interviewed dozens of members of a single division: the commander, the political representative, staff officers, regimental commanders, company leaders, and infantry. These include twenty-four soldiers from the 308th Rifle Division, a unit that suffered heavy losses northwest of the city before being reassigned to Stalingrad to protect the Barricades munitions plant. The historians also spoke with engineers in charge of planning the reconstruction of the Red October steelworks, and with more than twenty soldiers from the 38th Motorized Rifle Brigade who had captured General Paulus and the rest of the 6th Army command. Taken together, these individual perspectives give rise to a finely woven, multifaceted picture of soldiers in battle. Alongside this impressive specificity, the transcripts reveal shared spheres of experience and elucidate— credibly—how the Red Army operated as a combat force. The candor and complexity of the Stalingrad interviews sealed their fate, however. The historians were unable to obtain approval for publication from state censors during the war, and the documents they collected later disappeared in an archive.12 They are presented here in English for the first time. Like the journalists who toured Stalingrad in early 1943, the historians around Isaak Mints were drawn to the city’s defenders. They hoped to find in their testimony answers to the question that observers around the world were asking: exactly how had the Red Army been able to prevail against an enemy who was considered superior in operational planning, soldierly discipline, and fighting skills? Which resources did the defenders of Stalingrad bring to bear that stopped the unbeatable Germans who had until now forced Europe to its knees? These questions occupy researchers to the present day. The perhaps most debated issue surrounds the motivation of Red Army soldiers at Stalingrad. Did they act freely or were they coerced into battle, even at gunpoint? Did they draw\n\nfrom traditional Russian values, or were they animated by specifically Soviet ones? How did love for the homeland, hatred toward the invader, and devotion to Stalin figure in Red Army soldiers’ willingness to fight and die? The wartime interviews that lie at the center of this book provide rich and at times startlingly new answers to these questions. Featuring a panoply of Soviet voices from wartime, this book allows English readers for the first time to imagine Red Army soldiers and other defenders of the city as thinking and feeling individuals. As it gives these voices a forum, the book adds substantially to writing on World War II that—in part for lack of access to personal documents—portrays the Red Army as a depersonalized machine and often feeds on unverified clichés about “the Russian soldier.” The book also provides a corrective to the many studies on Stalingrad that present the clash largely through the eyes of the Germans who were trapped in the city. By contrast, the Stalingrad interviews show in compelling detail how Soviet citizens made sense of the battle and located themselves in it. This first chapter presents a historical context to enable readers to better understand the transcripts generated by the Mints commission. It begins with an overview of the battle and its treatment by historians, followed by a short history of the Red Army and Soviet society that culminates with the war. It then observes political and military events at the Stalingrad front through a microscopic lens. The chapter also features the creation of the Historical Commission, its aims and methods, and its journey to Stalingrad. It closes with a discussion of the interviews included in this book and the form of their presentation. These interviews were prepared for publication jointly by the German Historical Institute in Moscow and the Russian Academy of Sciences. Under my direction, a small team of historians spent two years accessing and inventorying thousands of pages of interview transcripts, internal commission documents, and other relevant sources. Space limitations dictated that only a portion of the interviews found entry into this volume.13 Ten of them are presented verbatim; many others are woven into veritable tapestries—they tell the story of the battle in the form a chorus of soldierly and civilian voices (Chapters 2–3). As they talked about how they had experienced the battle of Stalingrad, many of the interviewees shared impressions and thoughts about their German adversary. The historians of the Mints commission were interested in this question, and they additionally collected documents that illuminated the personal horizons of German soldiers at Stalingrad. These documents, which include the\n\ntranscripts of captured Germans who were interrogated in early February 1943 and the diary of a German soldier that was found on the battlefield, form the bulk of Chapter 4. The final, fifth chapter covers the aftermath of the Soviet victory at Stalingrad and follows the dramatic fate of the Soviet historians and writers who chronicled the battle.\n\nA CITY UNDER SIEGE The battle of Stalingrad marked a turning point in World War II. For six months, two massive army groups, each under orders not to cede an inch to the enemy, fought for control of the city that bore the Soviet dictator’s name.14 The battle ended with the encirclement and destruction of an entire German field army. At the time it was the worst military defeat in Germany’s history—and, in the immediate aftershock, the writing was on the wall for clear-eyed German observers.15 For the Soviet Union, Stalingrad represented its greatest victory to date over the German invaders. It shifted the war’s momentum in favor of the Red Army; after Stalingrad, its divisions would push steadily westward, their sights set on Berlin. After German advances on Leningrad, Moscow, and Sevastopol had ground to a halt in the fall of 1941 and the Soviets launched their winter counterattack, Hitler started planning a sweeping offensive for the following summer codenamed Operation Blue. It began on June 28, 1942, with a major assault along the Russian-Ukrainian front to take control of the region’s strategically important natural resources—the coal mines of the Donets basin and the oil fields outside Maykop, Grozny, and Baku. The German panzer and motorized infantry divisions gained ground quickly, but the pincer tactics they employed often missed their mark: whenever faced with encirclement, the Red Army divisions broke into rapid retreat. Hitler, assuming that the enemy troops had already dispersed, divided Army Group South into two parts: Army Group A, which was ordered to push toward the Caucasus, and Army Group B, which was to head northeast and secure the flanks. The spearhead of Army Group B was the 6th Army, under the command of General Friedrich Paulus. Its mission was to capture the city of Stalingrad, a key center for industry and weapons manufacturing on the Volga River.\n\nBy July 1942, the gravity of the situation—as even a cursory glance at a map made plain—had become apparent to many Soviet citizens. The writer Vasily Grossman noted in his diary, “The war in the south, on the lower reaches of the Volga, feels like a knife driven deep into the body.”16 The regime responded to the crisis with severe measures. After Rostov-on-Don fell into German hands with little resistance, Stalin issued Order no. 227, notorious for the line “Not one step back!”17 Henceforth, anyone who retreated from the enemy without an express order to do so would be branded a traitor to the fatherland and subjected to a military tribunal. This draconian edict was enforced at the battle of Stalingrad. The city extended like a ribbon twenty-five miles along the western bank of the Volga. Here “Not one step back!” meant that the river was the farthest point of retreat for the city’s defenders. From the outset of the battle, Soviet leaders impressed on soldiers the symbolic significance of Stalingrad. It was the place where Stalin had staved off the enemies of the Soviet system during the Russian Civil War. Losing Stalingrad to the Germans would damage the myth of the city and its eponymous hero, and had to be prevented by all means. For the same reasons the city was crucially important to Hitler. Banking on the psychological blow that a Soviet defeat would deliver to Stalin, he framed it early on as a battle between two opposing worldviews. On August 20, 1942, Joseph Goebbels wrote in his diary that the Führer “has made the city a special priority. [ . . . ] Not one stone will be left on another.”18 At the western bend of the Don curve, some distance from Stalingrad, German forces encountered heavy resistance from the Soviet 62nd Army. The Germans took 57,000 prisoners, however, and crossed the Don on August 21. By the twenty-third, the first German panzers reached the Volga, some forty miles away, and barred access to Stalingrad from the north. The news set off alarms in Moscow. Three days later, Stalin appointed General Georgy Zhukov deputy supreme commander of the Red Army and put him in charge of the city’s defense. At the beginning of the war, the population of Stalingrad was just under half a million, and the city was considered a safe haven far behind the front lines; by the summer of 1942 it was teeming with refugees. The city’s administrators implored Stalin to permit the evacuation of factories and civilians—to no avail. Lazar Brontman, a Pravda correspondent present during these discussions, recorded in his diary “how the boss [Stalin] declared with a glum expression:\n\n‘Where should they be evacuated? The city must be held. That’s final!’ he shouted, and pounded his fist on the table.”19 Only after German bombers had laid waste to the city did Stalin allow women and children to leave. After two weeks of bombing, Stalingrad was stormed by German troops. On September 14, a regiment broke through the inner city and reached the Volga.20 In the heavy street fighting that ensued over the following weeks, the Germans managed to push the soldiers of the 62nd Army back to the riverbank. Once the Wehrmacht’s shock troops had cleared a path, the German occupation authority set up headquarters, began executing communists and Jews, and prepared to deport the civilian population. On the other side, the Soviet defenders, dug in on the Volga’s steep western bank, held no more than a few bridgeheads. They received supplies, soldiers, and weapons by boat and cover from artillery positions on the east bank of the Volga. The 62nd Army in Stalingrad was part of the Southeastern Front,21 commanded by General Andrei Yeryomenko,22 which consisted of the 64th, 57th, and 51st Armies, the 8th Air Army, and the ships and sailors of the Volga Military Flotilla, all stationed south of the city; it also included the 1st Guards Army and the 25th and 66th Armies, located to the north and northwest. In September the latter cluster tried repeatedly to break through Germany’s northern barricade and meet up with the city’s defenders but never succeeded. The Soviet plan for a comprehensive counteroffensive took shape in midSeptember during the critical phase of the defense of Stalingrad. Zhukov and Alexander Vasilevsky, the chief of the general staff of the Soviet armed forces, proposed to Stalin an operation adopting the German Blitzkrieg method—a combined application of massive force, speed, and surprise—to envelop and rout the enemy. Over the next two months the Soviets prepared for the offensive: another formation (the Southwestern Front), under the command of General Nikolai Vatutin, secretly moved to a position on the upper Don; meanwhile, the armies in Stalingrad (divided since the end of September into two fronts: the Don Front, under the command of Lieutenant General Konstantin Rokossovsky,23 and the Stalingrad Front, under the command of Yeryomenko) received reinforcements of soldiers and equipment. These maneuvers did not go undetected by the Germans, but intelligence officers, believing that the Soviet Union’s reserves of materials and soldiers had been exhausted, assigned them no special importance.24 After a number of concerted drives in October, the 6th Army still had not\n\ntaken complete control of Stalingrad. German observers strained to explain the enemy’s unexpectedly bitter resistance. The lead article in the October 29, 1942, edition of the official SS newspaper Das Schwarze Korps began with an assessment of Soviet morale: “The Bolshevists attack until total exhaustion, and defend themselves until the physical extermination of the last man and weapon. [ . . . ] Sometimes the individual will fight beyond the point considered humanly possible.” Everything the soldiers of the Wehrmacht had experienced in their campaigns in Europe and North Africa was like “a child’s game compared with the elementary event of war in the East.” The article accounted for this difference by evoking German racial biology. The Soviet soldiers originated from a “baser, dim-witted humanity” unable “to recognize the meaning and value of life.” Owing to their purported absence of human qualities, the soldiers of the Red Army were thought to fight with a disregard for death that was foreign to culturally superior Europeans. The article concluded by depicting the threat for Europe contained in the “power of this unleashed inferior race,” and turned the battle of Stalingrad into a question of world historical destiny. “It is up to us to decide whether we remain human beings at all.”25 On November 19, 1942, the Red Army finally began its counteroffensive, known as Operation Uranus, with a contingent of over 1 million soldiers. Motorized divisions advanced through the Romanian-controlled Don heights 150 kilometers west of Stalingrad. On November 24, the Soviet tank vanguard joined forces with Yeryomenko’s tank divisions, which four days earlier had begun to push west from the area south of Stalingrad. The Germans and their allies were surrounded, trapped in what they referred to as a Kessel, or cauldron. The 6th Army command deliberated whether to attempt a breakout, but Hitler ordered “Fortress Stalingrad” to be held at all costs. He called for an air bridge to supply the soldiers in the Kessel with food and munitions. This was not the first time Hitler had taken this route. In December 1941, when the Red Army began its counteroffensive outside Moscow, Hitler, who had recently named himself supreme commander of the army, issued an order forbidding retreat under the threat of severe punishment. Shrouding himself in the mystique of the strong-willed military leader whose job was to embolden his generals whenever they succumbed to “neurasthenia” and “pessimism,” Hitler credited his decision with preventing the collapse of the Eastern Front despite strong attacks from the Red Army in the ensuing weeks.26 In January 1942, Soviet forces nevertheless managed to encircle six German divisions—almost 100,000 soldiers—farther\n\nnorth near Demyansk at Lake Ilmen. Hitler responded by sending in planes to drop supplies. This continued for two months until a relief force broke through the Demyansk pocket from the outside at the end of March. It was this successful precedent that General Paulus thought of when he sought to reassure the trapped men of the 6th Army, concluding his November 27 communiqué with the line, “Hold on! The Führer will get us out!”27 But severe weather and heavy shelling hampered the Stalingrad airlift; the 300,000 encircled soldiers began to suffer from shortages of food and munitions. General Erich von Manstein launched Operation Winter Storm (December 12– 23, 1942) in an effort to break through the encirclement with a panzer advance from the southwest,28 but it became bogged down midway in the face of strong Soviet resistance. In the meantime the Red Army had initiated an offensive on the Don farther west known as Little Saturn. Its objective was to break through to Rostov in the south, stymieing the German relief force and cutting off the entire army group, along with the 400,000 troops stationed in the Caucasus. The offensive succeeded in part: although it forced Manstein to abort Operation Winter Storm, he was able to protect the army in the Caucasus from imminent strangulation. At the end of November Soviet leaders began a massive propaganda campaign to persuade the Germans and their allies to surrender. Soviet aircraft dropped hundreds of thousands of leaflets written in German, Romanian, and Italian, describing the hopelessness of the situation. A delegation of German communist exiles in Moscow traveled to Stalingrad and broadcast political messages by loudspeaker, but their efforts to prevail on their countrymen on the other side of the front line were for naught. On January 6, two weeks after Manstein aborted his relief operation, General Rokossovsky offered Paulus terms for an honorable surrender. Under intense pressure from Hitler, the 6th Army commander ignored the deal.\n\nOperation Ring. Soviet military drawing.\n\nThe Soviets’ final push to crush the encircled German troops, code-named Operation Ring, began on January 10. From the west, soldiers on the Don Front gradually drove the enemy back into the city. At the same time, the 62nd Army intensified its attacks from the banks of the Volga, and on January 26 it joined the Don Front at Mamayev Kurgan,29 a strategic elevation south of the city’s industrial district and for months the scene of fierce fighting. The Soviets cut the Germans into two pockets, one in the north, the other in the south. General Paulus, repeatedly forced to give up his quarters as the Red Army closed in, sought refuge for himself and his staff on January 26 with the 71st Infantry Division, the first unit to reach the Volga at Stalingrad; its commanders were now headquartered beneath a department store on the Square of the Fallen Heroes. On January 30, the tenth anniversary to the day when the Nazis assumed power, Hermann Göring gave a radio address that reached the soldiers in Stalingrad. Göring compared the Germans in Stalingrad to the heroes in the Song of the Nibelungs. Like those who “fought to the last man” during an “unmatched battle in a hall of fire and flame,” the Germans in Stalingrad would fight—would have to fight—“for a people who can fight like this must win.” On the night of January 31, Paulus received a signal from Hitler’s headquarters saying that he had been promoted to field marshal. Everyone involved understood the message: never before had a German field marshal been taken prisoner; to avoid ignominy, Paulus would have to kill himself. Instead, he chose\n\nto defy his Führer. In the morning hours of January 31, Soviet soldiers of the 64th Army surrounded the Square of the Fallen Heroes. A German officer emerged with a white flag and offered terms of surrender. A group of Red Army soldiers were escorted into the basement below the department store, where Paulus’s army staff was assembled. (Chapter 2 contains a detailed eyewitness account of this encounter.) Several hours later, the German soldiers in the southern pocket threw down their weapons. In the northern pocket, intense fighting continued for two more days. It died down after the Red Army showered the German soldiers with photographs telling them of Paulus’s surrender.30 After the Soviet counteroffensive started but before the battle ended, 60,000 German soldiers died and 113,000 German and Romanian survivors were taken prisoner, many of them injured or exhausted. All in all, the battle and the subsequent imprisonment cost 295,000 German lives (190,000 on the battlefield, 105,000 in captivity). On the Soviet side, conservative estimates place the number of dead at 479,000, though one scholar has put the death toll at over a million.31 Nazi leaders responded to the defeat of the 6th Army by ramping up their propaganda and mass mobilization efforts. The sacrifice in Stalingrad, they believed, would motivate German soldiers in the fight to stem the “red tide” now moving west. No sooner had the three-day period of national mourning ended than Joseph Goebbels delivered his total war speech, met with frenzied applause from an audience of party loyalists. With the Red Army threatening to cross into Europe, the specter of “Bolshevik hordes” from “Asia,” long invoked by Nazi propagandists, had become a real possibility; for the terrified population, fighting on seemed to be the only way out—and that’s what happened, with greater intensity than before, as the war raged for two more years. The Soviet side also ramped up the political pressure. The captured German generals and officers were held in a special camp and called on to publicly renounce Hitler. Their Soviet captors foresaw for them a role as leaders of a Soviet-friendly postwar German state. Most other prisoners were kept in work camps, where they received little to eat and poor medical care. By July 1943, three-quarters of all German prisoners in Soviet captivity had died. When Red Army soldiers recaptured the city, they counted 7,655 civilian survivors.32 As the cleanup began, the Soviets discovered mass graves filled with civilians the German occupiers had shot or hanged. Several thousand captured Germans were put to work in February 1943, clearing bodies and\n\ndefusing bombs and mines. Eventually they would help rebuild the city.33 By the end of the battle, the scolding Stalin gave commanders in July 1942 had turned to praise, and he bestowed numerous honors on the Soviet military for its achievements. He complimented the Red Army as a “cadre army” and granted four field armies—the 62nd, the 64th, the 24th, and the 66th—the coveted Guards status. Stalin also rewarded himself, assuming the title Marshal of the Soviet Union on February 6, 1943.\n\nINTERPRETATIONS OF THE BATTLE Though widely researched and recounted, the battle of Stalingrad in most western depictions is a story of Germany’s demise.34 This narrative usually doesn’t start until November 19, 1942, the day the Soviets encircled the 6th Army. This chronological framework transforms the aggressors into desperate victims—cold, hungry, fighting to defend themselves35—and omits the German attack on Stalingrad and the long trail of blood the soldiers of the 6th Army left behind as they forced their way through the Ukrainian cities of Berdichev, Kiev, and Kharkov.36 Even the more comprehensive accounts, which start in June 1941 and include Soviet eyewitness reports, follow a German script, perfectly exemplified by the three-part TV documentary Stalingrad: The Attack—The Kessel—The Doom (2003).37 The human drama of Stalingrad is often reduced to four numbers: the 300,000 German soldiers trapped in the Kessel, the 110,000 survivors taken into Soviet captivity, the 6,000 who eventually returned home, and the twelve years it took them to get there. The extent of Soviet losses, by contrast, is rarely reported in the west. Unlike the overall portrayal of the Wehrmacht’s activities on the Eastern Front, which in the past two decades has received significant critical reexamination (though not without some blanket simplifications), views on Stalingrad remain to this day strikingly complacent and insular, emphasizing the suffering of German soldiers and seldom bothering to mention their adversary.\n\nStalingrad, 1943. Photographer: Natalya Bode\n\nOver the years, scholarly and public opinion in the west has offered a number of different narratives of Stalingrad. In the 1950s and 1960s, attention was focused on the figure of the battlefield soldier who upheld martial values to his dying breath. The former field marshal Erich von Manstein wrote in 1955 that the memory of the “unparalleled heroism, fidelity, and devotion to duty” of the soldiers who “starved, froze, and died” in Stalingrad will “live on long after the victors’ cries of triumph have died away and the bereaved, the disillusioned, and the bitter at heart have fallen silent.”38 Their memory would not endure nearly as long as Manstein predicted. As society underwent changes—best symbolized by the student movements of the late 1960s—and as the field of Alltagsgeschichte (everyday history) emerged, the image of the valiant soldier\n\nwas replaced by that of the antihero. The soldiers of Stalingrad became simple, clueless young men, who sometimes expressed themselves awkwardly in their letters, who were hurled into war, who seemed to share nothing of the Nazis’ grand ambitions.39 In German popular memory, Stalingrad also connotes anti-Nazi resistance from within. Some historical evidence for this indeed exists. In February 1943 Hans and Sophie Scholl, members of the White Rose resistance group, distributed copies of what would be the group’s final leaflet to students and faculty at the University of Munich. “The dead of Stalingrad implore us to take action,” it read, calling for Germans to free themselves from the tyranny of National Socialism.40 (This appeal fell on deaf ears, as did the antifascist manifestos later written by German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union.) Another possible source of resistance came from the Stalingrad veterans who claimed to have renounced Hitler and National Socialism amid battle.41 But are their assertions credible? Did their disavowal really take place at the point they describe, or was it a view they first expressed in their memoirs?42 One thing is certain: after Stalingrad, countless Germans followed the regime in a redoubled effort to prevent the tide of war from turning against them.43 The focus on the German drama at Stalingrad has left the Soviet side without well defined contours. Part of the problem was that the Germans who fought in Stalingrad didn’t really know their adversary. For them, the Soviets were a tawny-colored horde that rushed its opponent while crying out “Hurrah!” driven by pistol-waving political officers. These ideas carried over into official military studies of the postwar era. This should come as no surprise. The misconceptions were fed by propagandists of the Third Reich, and people like Franz Halder, Hitler’s chief of general staff, later drew on racially fueled anticommunism to teach Americans about “the Russian soldier.”44 Consequently we still lack a clear picture of how Red Army soldiers fought, of the cultural impressions they brought to bear on the war, what drove them as they fought against forces they believed were superior to their own, and what Stalingrad meant to them. Though Soviet historians cite the actions of many heroes, they fail to shed light on the specifics and the context. One exception is the Stalingrad veteran Alexander Samsonov. His study of the military strategy employed in the battle not only provides such details but is the only major work from a Soviet author to consider the German side as well.45\n\nMany archives have opened since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, dramatically expanding our understanding of what is known in Russia as the Great Patriotic War, and the place of the battle of Stalingrad within it. This is largely owing to the efforts of Russian archivists and scholars, including those working in the Russian Security Service (FSB), who have presented a wealth of previously classified materials. These include detailed data on desertion, arrests, and executions inside the Red Army as well as secret reports by NKVD Special Section officers with analyses of the political moods among Soviet rank-and-file soldiers.46 Moreover, a good number of uncensored memoirs, letters, and diaries from the war have been published, including the revealing diaries of Vasily Grossman and Konstantin Simonov, two writers who worked as war correspondents on the Stalingrad Front.47 And yet, when it comes to the thoughts and attitudes Soviet citizens held during the war, the overall picture remains sketchy. The problem lies in part with the strictures of Soviet censorship, which ensured that with few exceptions Soviet wartime letters lacked exact place-names or detailed portrayals of events and beliefs. The other and larger part of the problem is that scores of human documents from the war— personnel files, secret surveillance materials, interrogation protocols, confiscated letters—continue to remain off-limits in the massive archival collections of Russia’s Ministry of Defense.48 Historians continue to debate the motivations of Soviet soldiers. To what extent did they fight of their own free will, impelled by love of country, loyalty to the Soviet system, or to Stalin personally? To what extent was their engagement coerced? Antony Beevor argues for the latter. In his bestselling account of the battle he sharply criticizes the Soviet system for its “barely believable ruthlessness.”49 Beevor portrays the fighting in Stalingrad as not only a clash between Germans and Russians, but also a battle that Soviet leaders waged against their own population. From his perspective, one number in particular illustrates the inhuman character of the regime: General Chuikov’s decision to execute around 13,500 Red Army soldiers unwilling to fight in the 62nd Army. Beevor refers to these killings in his preface and concludes his book by noting that “the thousands of Soviet soldiers executed at Stalingrad on his [Chuikov’s] orders never received a marked grave.”50 But he does not provide convincing proof. He merely cites the military historian John Erickson, who speaks of 13,500 “reportedly” executed by firing squad.51 Recently declassified\n\nmaterials, however, show that in the period from August 1 to October 15, 1942 —one of the most critical phases of battle for the Red Army—278 Soviet soldiers were executed by the Soviet security police (NKVD) on the Stalingrad Front, of which the 62nd Army was only one part.52 The interviews published in this book make clear that violence, and especially the threat of violence, were widely applied in the Red Army, but they also suggest that western notions of mass executions on the Stalingrad Front need to be revised. Such notions are fully on view in the film Enemy at the Gates (2001). In the opening scene soldiers of the 284th Siberian Rifle Division are thrown into battle with insufficient weapons and munitions. Not surprisingly, the attack stalls and the soldiers retreat. They are immediately gunned down by an NKVD blocking detachment firing away with automatic weapons. The Stalingrad transcripts, which include conversations with two soldiers from the 284th Siberian Rifle Division, Major Nikolai Aksyonov and the celebrated sniper Vasily Zaytsev, the protagonist in Enemy at the Gates, show how far from reality this scene is. In addition to presenting the battle predominantly from a German perspective, Beevor’s book transports a number of clichés that originated in Nazi-era propaganda. For instance, he describes the will of soldiers to defend the Soviet Union to the point of self-sacrifice as “almost atavistic,” an expression that recalls the “primitive” eastern enemy described by Goebbels and others.53 Beevor is also convinced, without providing solid evidence, that Soviet troops in Stalingrad lived in permanent fear of political officers, the so-called commissars. By contrast, he praises Wehrmacht officers for their cultivation and gallantry, and revels in the image of “German gunners in shorts, with their bronzed torsos muscled from the lifting of shells” who “looked like athletes from a Nazi propaganda film.”54 Had Beevor taken more time to study the other side, he would have read how Soviet citizens saw the shirtless German invaders as disrespectful and uncivilized.55 As concepts, “primitive” and “civilized” are nothing more than free-floating, culturally dependent attributes. If Beevor describes the Soviet soldiers as terrorized subjects, the British historian Catherine Merridale portrays them as betrayed victims. While the soldiers believed they were part of a struggle to liberate the Soviet Union from Nazi invaders, Stalin’s regime kept them permanently oppressed in conditions tantamount to enslavement.56 Merridale’s social history of the Red Army offers vivid descriptions of the privation and hardship in soldiers’ everyday lives, but\n\nshe is less convincing when writing about their experiences of war. She argues that Soviet troops lived two different wars: “The first, the one that they alone could know, was the war of the battlefield, the scream war of shells and smoke, the shameful one of terror and retreat. But the other war, whose shape was crafted by writers, was the one that propaganda created.”57 The ideology that appealed to morality and promised a just war had, in Merridale’s view, nothing to do with the soldiers’ primary experience of war; it was something imposed externally. Yet as a method of analysis, the attempt to separate experience from ideology is dubious, for it assumes that individuals conceive experience outside values and linguistic expression. More to the point, the soldiers who speak in her book strongly identify with the public language and ideals of the time.58 In seeking to uncover the Soviet soldier’s “real” experience, freed of state ideology, Merridale interviewed dozens of World War II veterans. Ironically, she discarded most of their testimony on the grounds that it parroted official views— as if the veterans had all succumbed to false consciousness.59 Their association of moral ideals and patriotism with the war did not fit into Merridale’s preconceived notion of war as nothing but suffering and disturbing violence. There was no place in her understanding for Red Army troops who identified with the state, the homeland, or socialist values.\n\nAnyone who, like Merridale or Beevor, depicts the Soviet population as enslaved by the system cannot persuasively explain why millions of people fought against the Germans until they literally collapsed. More recent studies such as those by Yelena Senyavskaya, Amir Weiner, Lisa Kirschenbaum, and Anna Krylova address the central undying questions: how did the state convince large segments of the population to join the war effort, and what intellectual and psychological reserves did it unleash in the process? They describe how journalists, writers, and artists helped draft and distribute inspiring slogans; they investigate how the civil population wrested meaning from the hardship of war thanks to heroic appeals from the state; and they show how frontline soldiers began to understand themselves as actors in the Soviet regime.60\n\nThe Stalingrad transcripts make it possible for the first time to hear the voices of Red Army soldiers, hitherto virtually unknown, across a varied, nuanced spectrum. They give three-dimensional shape to the emotions, motives, and actions of individual soldiers—soldiers who saw themselves as active participants and embraced their combat roles, and thus provide support for the recent trend among scholars to see the Great Patriotic War as a people’s war. But the interviews also reveal an element at odds with most western depictions: the Communist party’s enormous effort to condition the troops.61 The party was an ever-present institutional force in the form of political officers and ideological messages. It permeated all military levels and sent its emissaries—political officers, agitators, party and youth league secretaries—into the trenches, where they sermonized, provided counsel, encouraged and rallied the troops, explained the current state of affairs, and created meaning. The interviews show how this apparatus functioned, how it mobilized the soldiers, and how it responded to crises. The political officers denounced every trace of weakness as cowardice and counterrevolutionary treason while preaching self-discipline and heroism. Together with the secret police, the party placed the army in an iron yoke. But even when party officials doled out punishment, the intentions were corrective, seeking to instruct, motivate, and remake the troops. Historians in the west have overlooked the Communist party’s mobilizing function. This is partly because their access has been limited to official documents from political headquarters, which offer little insight into the everyday working of the political apparatus. But it is also because they tend to understand the party as solely repressive in nature, regarding its ideological work as a mere demonstration of political power. Also contributing to this oversight is the view of many military historians that the Communist party hampered the military, and that the Red Army did not become an effective combat force until the political officers were removed.62 But in reality the party never left; indeed, its presence in the armed forces increased as the war continued. The American historian Stephen Kotkin understands power and ideology in the early Soviet era in a way that helps illuminate conditions in the Red Army during World War II. Kotkin’s local study on building socialism in a Soviet industrial city illustrates how the communist state, through targeted forms of speech and behavior, recast millions of rural immigrants and refugees in a socialist mold. Party agitators saw to it that workers not only met quotas but understood the political significance of the international class struggle. The\n\nregime grouped individuals into “shock brigades” and pitted them against each other in socialist competitions. Those who learned how to “speak Bolshevik” went on to have careers and felt part of the communist society and the grand future advertised by the regime.63 But as many diaries and letters from the 1930s record, the internalization of socialist values did not take place by party directive alone; many Soviet citizens, especially the younger and better educated, saw the 1930s as a world-historical battle between an emergent communism and a crisis-shaken capitalism (of which fascism was part), and tried to shape their own lives in keeping with these high standards.64 Many believed that they needed to prepare themselves for an inevitable conflict.65 These ideals, like indoctrinated forms of behavior and speech, did not vanish when war broke out; on the contrary. The Stalingrad transcripts document the further evolution of classic Soviet character traits from the 1930s: willful, optimistic, collectively minded, and accepting of violence.66 After war erupted, the party brought its ideological conditioning to the factories and the work floors, pushing workers (by then mostly women) to meet the needs of the war industry. It put more of its agitators in battlefield trenches and shelters and sponsored new socialist competitions to see who could kill the most Germans. Judging by the medals and other distinctions awarded during the war, this renewed wave of subjectivation in Soviet society encompassed thousands of civilian workers and Red Army soldiers. Kotkin’s perspective emphasizes the interlocking nature of a party and society that reinforced each other. This characterization is at odds with the conviction of many researchers that Soviet society opposed the party and during the war years temporarily freed itself from the chains of Stalin’s regime. The Russian literary scholar Lazar Lazarev, himself a veteran of the war, speaks of “spontaneous destalinization.” He and others point out how, after the war began, the regime opened up greater freedoms in intellectual life; even the party newspaper Pravda became more honest in its reporting.67 The chief proponent of this view was Vasily Grossman, a war correspondent in Stalingrad in the fall of 1942 who stayed longer than any other observer. His epic novel Life and Fate (1950–1959) is a monument to the Red Army soldiers who fought there.68 Paradoxically, the novel describes the ruined city as a place of freedom. Party officers, stationed at the general staff command post at a safe distance from the fighting, have lost control of the city. As the old hierarchy breaks down, a\n\ncommissar is sent to the city to inspect the situation. The open political conversations he hears horrify him, but he is fascinated by how the soldiers vouch for each other and by the sense of community that unites them. This spirit of fraternity and democracy reminds him of his youth and the early stages of the Russian Revolution. Grossman describes the flame of human freedom that burned for a short time in Stalingrad but went out again after the Germans were defeated and Stalin’s state regained control over society. Such thoughts are absent from Grossman’s wartime writing. Even in his more candid and critical war diary he writes admiringly of communists who used their moral authority to raise the spirits of despondent Red Army soldiers. One diary entry describes a meeting with brigade commissar Nikolai Shlyapin. During a combat operation in Belorussia in July 1941 Shlyapin galvanized the surviving soldiers from his division and broke through the German lines. He was a man Grossmann described as “intelligent, strong, calm, big, and slow. People sense his inner power over them.”69 In the English translation of the diary, edited by Antony Beevor, Grossman’s interview with Shlyapin is not included. Beevor removed the interview on the grounds that it was drenched in “contemporary Soviet clichés” and thus unimportant for modern readers. Grossman’s interview with Shlyapin’s adjutant, the political commissar Klenovkin, is also missing in Beevor’s editions. The adjutant describes Shlyapin as a savior: “In combat the commissar walks calmly and slowly. ‘Get over here, like this!’ He acts as if there were no fighting at all. Everyone looks at him expectantly. ‘The commissar is with us.’”70 Klenovkin served as the inspiration for a key figure in Grossman’s novel The People Immortal (1942).71 The spirit of Stalingrad, as Grossman understood it, consisted in the moral strength of ordinary soldiers who attained heroic status when they risked their lives to fulfill their civic duty. Some, though not all, of the commissars set a glowing example. For Grossmann, the war contained the promise of a moral renewal of the party and its relationship with Soviet society. Only years later did he realize that his hopes had been illusory, forcing him to rethink his experiences.72 In Life and Fate Grossman’s original enthusiasm for Soviet war heroes faded into a declared belief in individual freedom, as opposed to Stalin’s regime. Grossman, however, was not wrong about the political atmosphere during the war years: it had indeed become more liberal, as the party began to open itself to the outside (as the Stalingrad transcripts show). In particular, the party changed\n\nits criteria for admission. Earlier the litmus test had been knowledge of Marxist theory and a working-class background, but now it was military achievement. The party opened its doors to anyone who could demonstrate having killed Germans in battle. This is how many of the best soldiers were admitted to the party. Between 1941 and 1944, the number of party members in the army rose continuously, and by the end of the war the vast majority of commanders carried a membership book. In the process, not only did the composition of the party change but also the meaning of involvement. The party assumed more of a military quality and became closer to the people.73 As the end of the war neared, however, the party leadership reversed course, tightening admission requirements and increasing vigilance within the ranks.74 Relying on incessant training and supervision, party officers generated a unified worldview among Red Army troops. The pervasiveness and effectiveness of political involvement in military units set the Red Army apart from other modern armies. Recent historical studies that discuss the question of why and how soldiers fight often point to loyalties and relationships built up within the most basic, “primary” fighting groups—the platoon or the company. They deem comradeship, or the “band of brothers” concept, of utmost importance and sometimes believe it to have universal value.75 And yet these notions played a subordinate role in the Red Army. For one, the terrible casualty rate on the Soviet side consumed whole units in a matter of days and made it impossible for soldiers to develop personal cohesion. Moreover, communist authorities actively sought to suppress such ties: they feared that soldiers’ particularist visions and desires might undermine their larger Soviet identity. Unlike the German army that filled its units with soldiers from the same region so as to buttress their regional identity (Landsmannschaft), the Soviet military mixed recruits from different nationalities, lest they turn nationalistic.76 The cement that the Red Army command used to bind together diverse soldiers and motivate them to fight was ideology. Preached incessantly and targeting every recruit, it was made up of accessible concepts with an enormous emotional charge: love for the homeland and hatred of the enemy. Several German observers in the war were impressed by the Soviet example. After the battle of Stalingrad they demanded that political training in the Wehrmacht be radically expanded, arguing that such training planted the decisive seed of military morale. In December 1943 Hitler created the position of National Socialist leadership officer (NSFO), which, unlike the commissars,\n\ncame from the army but had to be confirmed by party leaders.77 Because the military identity of soldiers and officers in the Wehrmacht lay outside politics, the reforms did not find acceptance. People poked fun at the leadership officer, calling him the “NSF zero.” Political questions had a very different status in the Red Army, as even its name makes clear.78\n\nREVOLUTIONARY ARMY On February 23, 1943, three weeks after its victory at Stalingrad, the Red Army commemorated its twenty-fifth anniversary. A young army, it still showed traces of its origins in the Russian Revolution and the Civil War that followed (1917– 1921). How present the revolutionary era was for many Soviet soldiers in Stalingrad can be illustrated by the interviews with General Vasily Chuikov and General Alexander Rodimtsev, who tell how they joined up with the Red Army in the commotion of the revolution and earned their spurs in the Civil War. But other links, institutional and intellectual, also existed between the Civil War and World War II. The Red Workers and Peasants Army—renamed the Soviet Army in 1946—understood itself as a new kind of revolutionary organization. It was “the world’s first political army,” equipped with an arsenal of words as well as weapons.79 This ambition found striking expression in an early emblem of the Red Army, which depicted a gun and a book alongside the hammer and sickle.80 The Red Army began as a volunteer army fueled by the revolutionary spirit of armed workers, the so-called Red Guards. In the summer of 1918, when enemies closed around Soviet Russia, Leon Trotsky, as war commissar of the Red Army, introduced general conscription, opening the army for millions of soldiers from the countryside. Lenin was appalled as he watched the ragged recruits march across Red Square on the first anniversary of the October Revolution.81 Yet from the outset the Bolsheviks tried to mold the members of the Peasants Army. They initiated mandatory instruction in reading, writing, and math and appealed constantly to the recruits’ political consciousness in the hope they would fight for the new system from personal belief and conviction.82 Toward the end of the Civil War, the Red Army consisted of 5 million soldiers, far more than necessary to defeat the Whites. For the Soviet leadership, the\n\ncrucial motivation lay elsewhere: making sure that as many people as possible acquired the rudiments of socialism. As Marxists, the Bolsheviks brought to the recruits a broad understanding of politics. Each was an actor on the world-historical stage; every thought and action carried political significance. The Bolsheviks wanted the recruits to internalize the message and fight of their own free will because they believed this would make them better soldiers and citizens. Their idea of humanity was thoroughly voluntarist: a person with a fully developed will could achieve anything. Soviet communists understood people as products of their environment and hence saw human nature as adaptable. Peasants unskilled in war were ignorant but they could learn. Deserters who showed remorse and recognized the error of their ways got a second chance. By contrast, deserters in the White Army were summarily executed, as was common practice in tsarist Russia.83 To monitor troops in their beliefs, Soviet leaders introduced a comprehensive system of political surveillance. During World War I many governments kept tabs on troop morale, but none went as far as the Bolsheviks. In the 1920s and 1930s and throughout World War II and after, military censors under the direction of the secret police screened all letters written by Red Army soldiers.84 The letters were not sealed but folded into triangles, each bearing the censor’s stamp and signature. In contrast, Wehrmacht mail inspectors made do with spot checks.85 The Soviet practice of surveillance always included an educational mission. The Bolsheviks wanted to educate the ignorant, convert the skeptical, and root out die-hard “counterrevolutionaries.” Because the system of surveillance and education reached deeply into everyday life, Red Army soldiers were familiar with the moral categories of Soviet leaders. Faintheartedness, bourgeois values, and political indifference were anathema; open criticism of superiors in mail correspondence, inadvisable; selfless and heroic action, the ideal. The Communist party had a strong institutional presence in the Red Army from the outset. The Bolsheviks formed party cells at all levels of the army down to the company. Commissars (politruks at the company level and voenkoms at the higher echelons) served as direct representatives of the government. Initially, their primary task was to monitor the military commander to whom they were assigned and with whom they held equal military rank. All orders issued by commanders required the express approval of their respective commissar.86 This dual system of military and political leadership grew out of Trotsky’s decision in\n\nthe spring of 1918 to enlist thousands of former tsarist officers in the Red Army.87 Trotsky believed that the military expertise of these “bourgeois specialists” would benefit the Soviet regime because the Red Workers and Peasants Army had so few experienced commanders. (Trotsky and other Bolsheviks purposely avoided the terms “officer” and “soldier,” which they associated with the hierarchies and class differences of the tsarist army. Instead, they spoke of “Red Army men” or “fighters.” Any mention of “soldiers” referred to enemy troops.) Many other Bolsheviks, including Stalin and his associate Kliment Voroshilov, disagreed with Trotsky. They found former members of the tsarist army repulsive both personally and politically. The conflict between Stalin and Trotsky smoldered for several years before erupting publicly. A portrayal of the relationship between the commissar and the commander is found in Dmitri Furmanov’s autobiographical novel Chapayev (1923). Furmanov was a provincial teacher before joining the Bolshevik party in 1918 and entering the Red Army the following year. There he served as the commissar for divisional commander Vasily Chapayev as they fought side by side against Admiral Alexander Kolchak’s White Army in the Urals. In his novel, Furmanov depicts Chapayev as a brash go-getter, brimming with a peasant’s anarchistic fervor. The unit’s commissar, a disciplined fighter and a patient teacher, must harness Chapayev’s energy if the backwoods commander is to benefit the revolution. Over the course of many conversations the commissar instills a higher political consciousness in the physically powerful but mentally malleable Chapayev. In 1934 the novel was adapted into a film, establishing Chapayev as a heroic Soviet icon. Stalin had seen the film dozens of times within a year and a half of its release. He knew the scenes and dialogue by heart and reanalyzed the actors and plot at every screening.88 Several of the soldiers interviewed in Stalingrad mentioned Chapayev, and a gunboat in the Volga Military Flotilla bore his name. Interestingly, the film contains a subplot not found in the novel: a budding romance between two supporting characters, Chapayev’s adjutant Petya and a machine gunner named Anka. Initially not taken seriously by Petya, Anka proves herself by valiantly repelling an attack by the Whites. In a pivotal scene, the enemy troops, dressed in regal uniforms and marching in full formation—as the film makes clear, the purpose is intimidation—close in on the outnumbered Reds. Anka’s comrades are eager to fire their guns and storm the enemy troops, but Anka waits until they are almost on top of her before opening fire, furiously\n\ncutting them down with a Maxim machine gun. Her actions inspired many young women to enlist in 194189 and symbolized the presence of mind and strength of will vaunted by the Bolsheviks. But the psychological intimidation depicted in the film was a fantasy, fed by the belief that the enemy sought to break communist will. Red Army soldiers in Stalingrad spoke repeatedly of German “psychic attacks.” In all likelihood this impression had more to do with Chapayev than with the actual intentions of the enemy.90 The culture of the Red Army during the Civil War was marked by not only political mobilization but also raw physical violence. Many of the commanders interviewed in Stalingrad cut their teeth as young men in the Civil War. The future army commander Vasily Chuikov learned how to cement his authority with beatings and executions. Writer Isaak Babel, working as a war correspondent, described how the commander Semyon Timoshenko, “a colossus in red half-leather trousers, red cap, well-built,” whipped his regiment officers with a riding crop and shot at them with his pistol to drive them into battle. Babel also observed Kliment Voroshilov—later a confidant of Stalin’s and part of the Soviet political and military leadership in World War II—berating a divisional commander in front of his troops while riding to and fro on horseback.91 Babel recorded brutal violence among the troops, executions of Polish prisoners of war, and assaults on Jews and other civilians. Although horrified, he continued to express his admiration for the soldiers’ heroic deeds and convictions, which he helped foster in his reports from the war zone.\n\nSTALIN’S CITY Joseph Stalin and the city named after him had their own Civil War experiences. Until 1925 Stalingrad bore the name Tsaritsyn, a Tatar word meaning “city on the yellow river” in reference to the Tsaritsa, which flows into the Volga at Stalingrad. The city’s location on the Volga and on a railway line stretching from Moscow to the Caucasus made it into a transportation and trade hub for southern Russian and had promoted industrial development there since the nineteenth century. The weapons factory in Tsaritsyn, founded in 1914 and renamed the Red Barricades after the revolution, was the largest munitions manufacturer in Europe. The area around Tsaritsyn was one of the first burning points in the Civil\n\nWar. After the Bolsheviks seized power, many tsarist officers fled to the Cossack settlements in the Don and Kuban regions where they formed a volunteer army in the spring of 1918 to mobilize against the new rulers. They received logistical support from the German occupying powers in the Ukraine. In May 1918 Stalin, as people’s commissar of nationalities, was tasked with boosting the food supply from the northern Caucasus. Due to fighting, the train carrying Stalin and his Red Army troops got stuck in Tsaritsyn, where they joined forces with the 10th Army, which had been cobbled together from partisans under the command of Voroshilov. Meanwhile, the White Army, together with an allied Cossack army under the direction of Ataman Pyotr Krasnov, had pushed forward from the south and the west toward the city. Although Stalin’s assignment was civilian in nature and he had no military experience, he seized the reins. In a letter to Lenin, he demanded that General Andrei Snesarev, the commander of the Red Army in the northern Caucasus military district who still wore his tsarist epaulets, be fired. Lenin gave in to Stalin’s pressure. In the middle of August 1918 Stalin declared the city under siege and ordered the city’s bourgeoisie to dig trenches. The Soviet defenders spoke of Tsaritsyn as a “Red Verdun” that would never surrender to the Whites and the foreign meddlers who backed them. A counterattack pushed the enemy troops behind the Don, but by September Krasnov’s troops had recovered their ground. Once again, there was a conflict between Stalin and a former tsarist commander in the service of the Red Army, and once again it ended with the commander’s dismissal. Trotsky, furious, ordered Stalin back to Moscow immediately. Yet by the middle of October the Red Army had ended the White assault on Tsaritsyn.92 Stalin’s role in saving the city is contested. First after his death, and again after the Soviet Union fell apart, critics have raised doubts about Stalin’s military acumen in view of the heavy losses.93 But at the time, some admired Stalin for his brutal approach. Writing in 1919, an officer in the White Army who had infiltrated the Red Army as a spy during the siege of Tsaritsyn stressed the effectiveness of Stalin’s ruthless measures. He cites one example where Stalin, convinced that the city’s bourgeoisie harbored counterrevolutionary sentiments, had several dozen officers and civilians placed on a barge, which he threatened to blow up if city residents did not side with the Red Army. The officer also attested to Stalin’s great skills as an agitator: He would often say in his arguments about military skill: “It’s fine if\n\neveryone is talking about the need for military skill, but if the most talented general in the world does not have a conscientious soldier educated by the right kind of agitation, believe me, he won’t be able to do anything with a bunch of motivated revolutionaries, however few in number.” And Stalin, in accordance with his conviction, spared no means on propaganda, on the publication and distribution of newspapers, on dispatching agitators.94 Thanks to Stalin, the White spy continued sadly, the city bore the name “Red Tsaritsyn.” The officer also explained the many casualties on the Soviet side: they had resulted from his successful disinformation. By the end of the Civil War, Tsaritsyn had been besieged multiple times, yet in Soviet memory the defense of the city was associated with Stalin even before it was renamed in 1925. In the 1930s the Stalingrad cult began to bloom. After the success of Chapayev, the Vasiliev brothers began work on a movie about the defense of Tsaritsyn. The filming encountered delays, and the first part was not released in theaters until April 1942.95 The film follows the same template as Chapayev, with Voroshilov behind a Maxim gun, single-handedly fending off an attack designed to intimidate the Reds. But here it was not the Whites but the Germans (equipped anachronistically with Wehrmacht helmets) on the opposing side. The tsarist general serving under the Bolsheviks wants to give up Tsaritsyn, but Stalin resists. “In order to be victorious, one has to fight.” The film culminates with Stalin delivering an address to the workers of Tsaritsyn: “An honest death is better than mean, slavish life. [ . . . ] Onward for the motherland!” The striking parallels between the Defense of Tsaritsyn and the defense of Stalingrad may be coincidental, but they also suggest that the Civil War era and its legends acted as a template for World War II. As in the battle of Tsaritsyn, Stalin prohibited the evacuation of his namesake city, declared a state of siege, and demanded self-sacrifice from residents. Civil War veterans gave rousing speeches in the city and on the front, and one of the City Defense Committee’s first appeals to city residents after the German assault began with the following call to arms: Like 24 years ago, our city is again experiencing hard times. [ . . . ] In the momentous 1918 our fathers held Red Tsaritsyn against the onslaught of\n\nthe gangs of German hirelings. And we ourselves shall hold Red Stalingrad in 1942. We shall hold it so that then we may drive back and destroy the bloodthirsty gang of German occupiers [ . . . ] Everybody to the construction of barricades! Everybody capable of bearing arms to the barricades, to the defense of the native city, the native home!96 On November 6, 1942, one day before the public holiday commemorating the October Revolution, Soviet newspapers printed an open letter to Stalin signed by commanders and soldiers from the 62nd Army. The signatories swore to Stalin and their “fathers, the gray-haired defenders of Tsaritsyn,” that they would defend Stalingrad “till the last drop of blood, till the last breath.”97 The Moscow historians who visited Stalingrad in December 1942 were not immune to the spell of the Civil War. Several were recognized specialists in the field; one had published a documentary history on the defense of Tsaritsyn several months earlier.98 In the historical memory of many Soviet participants to the battle, the Civil War figured very prominently, shrouded in a mystique of heroic magnitude and revolutionary zeal.\n\nPREWAR ERA In the years after the Civil War the Red Army shrank from 5 million soldiers to 1.5 million. But this did not deter the Soviet government from preparing for a global showdown between capitalist and socialist camps. In Bolshevik fashion, Stalin spoke to an assembly of industrial executives in 1931, pointing out that Soviet Russia was currently lagging “fifty to one hundred years behind” developed nations and exhorting the managers to close the gap by 1941: “We must cover this distance in ten years, or we will be crushed.”99 Like other governments, the Soviet Union made three major investments that enabled it to wage war effectively in the twentieth century. It launched a national industrialization campaign to equip a large army; it prepared its population for impending war; and it created human reserves to feed the industrial cycle of mass production and mass killing. The nationalized economy and the one-party system enabled Soviet leaders to take measures that were more sweeping and more ruthless than those of rival states during the interwar period. Socialist\n\nplanners approached industrialization like a war. They deployed superproductive “shock workers,” achieved “breakthroughs,” celebrated “triumphs” over nature, and fought against the machinations of “class enemies.” The backbone of this campaign consisted of the Communist party and its youth organization, the Komsomol. The party dispatched armed delegations from an “army of revolutionary warriors,”100 whose job was to force recalcitrant populations in rural areas onto collective farms. This violent expansion of socialism took place at the expense of much of the population, who had to learn to live with rationing and privation—while increasing productivity. In 1940 the government passed laws punishing tardiness at work as severely as desertion. Though the system demanded much from citizens, it also held out a promise. Every worker who took part could become a “builder of socialism,” a part of the system and an actor on the world-historical stage. Like other states in the interwar period, the Soviet government encouraged citizens to start families in an effort to increase the birth rate, but it also tied these pro-family policies to a comprehensive premilitary education. In 1931 the Komsomol introduced a military sports program in which millions of adolescents learned how to shoot rifles and throw grenades. By 1933, a Komsomol offshoot, the Society for the Assistance to Defense, Aviation, and Chemical Construction, had 10 million men and 3 million women members, who received flight training and practiced parachuting.101 The Soviet new person— an ideal that expressly included women—was strong of will, full of fight, fearless, and optimistic. Even the youngest Soviet citizens were sworn to military discipline and allegiance to the collective as members of the party’s pioneer organization.102 Their literary paradigm was another hero from the Civil War: Pavel Korchagin, from Nikolay Ostrovsky’s bestselling novel How the Steel Was Tempered (1934). Korchagin was a Komsomol and a soldier who strove to “work on himself” and benefit society even after being severely wounded in battle. Ever since Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931, war had been a real danger for the Soviet Union. Beginning in 1935 the Soviet press portrayed fascist Germany as the main enemy. The Spanish Civil War (1936–1939)—in which Stalin supplied the Republicans with weapons and advisers—received sympathetic coverage, and even found its way into the diaries of village residents.103 The successful play The Final Battle (1931) showcased Soviet citizens’ belief that war was imminent. The final scene shows a group of twenty-seven Red Army\n\nsoldiers defending the border against an imperialist enemy. In a hail of machine gun fire, all die but one. The injured survivor drags himself to a blackboard, where, just before collapsing, he writes, “162,000,000-27 = 161,999,973.” At that point a man walks out on stage and addresses the audience. Invariably the following exchange would take place. The man would ask, “Who is in the army?” and a few members of the audience would stand up. Then he would ask, “Who is a reservist?” and more would stand up. Finally he would ask, “Who will defend the Soviet Union?” and the entire audience would stand up. “Show’s over,” the man would announce. “To be continued on the front.”104 The avantgarde device—tearing down the barrier between the stage and the audience— sought to activate spectators as militarized participants. “The final battle” were words straight out of “The Internationale,” an anthem familiar to every Soviet child. War preparations included a massive expansion of the Red Army, but the process was erratic and tense. In 1937 the deputy people’s commissar of defense, Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, together with seven other generals, was accused of high treason and espionage and sentenced to death. Stalin’s distrust of Tukhachevsky, a brilliant military strategist but also the son of a noble family and a former lieutenant in the tsarist army, seems to have precipitated the purge. The confessions of the accused, extracted under torture, led to further arrests. By 1939 more than 34,000 officers had been expelled from the Red Army. In the meantime the regime had broadened the original 1925 mandate of the people’s commissar for the purposes of monitoring military commanders deemed politically unreliable.105 The scope of the Red Army purges was probably less than has long been assumed, however.106 It is certainly the case that Nikita Khrushchev exaggerated their extent in order to pin the blame for the devastating defeats in 1941 on his predecessor. In truth, most of the 34,000 officials excluded from the Communist party escaped execution: 11,000 had reentered the party by 1939 after lodging successful appeals; less than half of the remaining 23,000 became caught in the tentacles of the NKVD, but most cases were not political and resulted in minor sanctions. Many of the dismissed officers later sought to prove their loyalty. Guards General Major Nestor Kozin was among the soldiers interviewed in Stalingrad. Like most victims of Stalin’s terror, Kozin sincerely believed that the purges were meant for enemies and a mistake had been made in his case:\n\nWhy I was kicked out of the party. The formal reason for the expulsion was that divisional commander Balakiryev turned out to be an enemy of the people, and they accused me of not being vigilant enough. All I said was that the political chief, the deputy, the entire political department, along with the top commanders—all of them party members—missed that he was an enemy of the people. But here I—a platoon commander— was meant to see what kind of man he was. They called it “spreading anti-Soviet rumors.” Long story short—they kicked me out of the party.107 Further in his defense, Kozin explained that he was unable to command his troops during the 1939 Soviet invasion of Finland because, having been deemed politically unreliable, he had to prove himself first as an instructor (which he did with flying colors). He joined the Great Patriotic War immediately and was awarded the Order of Lenin within several months. In December 1941 he was reaccepted into the party. Most commanders interviewed in Stalingrad were young, part of a group of majors and captains who advanced after their superiors were demoted and went on to have impressive careers.\n\nARMY AND PARTY IN WAR Despite—or because of—its massive expansion between 1938 and 1941, the Red Army was poorly equipped for the German attack in June 1941. The impressive number of Red Army soldiers enlisted by that time—5 million versus 1.6 million in January 1938108—obscured the fact that most of the recruits, assembled near the Polish border, were inexperienced and poorly trained. When the Hitler-Stalin pact put half of Poland in the Soviet Union’s sphere of influence, the Red Army positioned its soldiers close to the new border, where they could repel an enemy attack quickly and decisively. They erected a wall immediately behind the border, mostly with materials taken from the old line of defense, known by the Germans as the Stalin line. When war broke out, the new wall was still incomplete and the old one half demolished; neither provided significant protection. The first phase of the Soviet Union’s wartime production favored quantity\n\nover quality, especially when it came to aerial forces. When the Germans invaded, Soviet warplanes lacked radio equipment, making effective communication with ground troops and other aircraft impossible,109 and the pilots and airplane mechanics were inadequately trained. As a result, in the first year of the war Germany managed to immobilize almost the entire Soviet air force, a large part on the ground in the Blitz raids of June 1941. By the end of 1941, the Soviet Union had lost more than 10,000 aircraft. Another 10,000 machines were inoperative due to breakdowns and mechanical defects. Germany incurred fifteen times fewer losses during the same period.110 Many of the Red Army soldiers interviewed in Stalingrad noted the poor performance of the Soviet air force and Germany’s absolute air superiority in the summer and fall of 1942. The soldiers criticized the poor coordination within the armed services and the lack of experience in mechanized and mobile warfare. In 1942 the Red Army improved its coordination, as well as its military hardware, especially with the introduction of the T-34 tank and the Pe-2 dive bomber, which the Germans came to respect and fear.111 The Soviets were up against a 4 million man army that possessed superior technology, well-rehearsed tactical maneuvers, and almost two years of uninterrupted combat experience. The Wehrmacht’s arsenal comprised first-rate reconnaissance, tested coordination between tank troops, air force, and infantry, and a proven artillery that could unleash devastating barrages. Hitler and his generals believed that they could deliver a death blow to the Red Army with deep pincer movements. This strategy yielded hundreds of thousands of prisoners, but it did not break the Red Army’s will. The Wehrmacht lost 185,000 men on the Eastern Front in the first three months of battle, almost twice as many as it had since June 1941.112 The German leadership was oblivious to the strong backing the Soviet regime received from its people and its ability to mobilize a seemingly inexhaustible number of troops. Just as Nazi Germany was skilled militarily, the Soviet system was well versed politically: with a push of a button it could launch a political campaign, exhorting citizens to go above and beyond. One example was the evacuation of industry after the German invasion on June 22, 1941. Within six months, the Soviets completely dismantled 1,500 large plants and relocated their machinery and workers to the east. As Soviet leaders had not reckoned with the Germans advancing so far into the country, no evacuation plans had been drawn up in advance. The massive campaign worked because it\n\nwas executed in the command economy style that the Soviets had employed successfully for many years.113 The regime sought to raise the fighting spirit of civilians and soldiers against the “fascist aggressors,” just as the Russian empire had in the Patriotic War of 1812. Stalin appealed to his people’s love for country, calling on his “brothers and sisters” to fight a “just war” that would end in either Soviet liberation or German enslavement. The many thousands of Soviet citizens, men and women alike, who volunteered for the front in the first weeks of the war confirmed the effectiveness of his appeal. Owing to the enormous losses sustained by the Red Army in the initial months—by December 1941, 3 million soldiers had been killed or captured114 —the military leadership kept expanding the pool of potential recruits. From late 1941 on, it began sending non-Slavic soldiers to the front, though their political loyalty and military ability were considered suspect. By 1945, 8 million people besides the Slavs—Uzbeks, Kazaks, Tatars, Latvians, and others—had joined the Red Army, close to one-fourth of the 34 million who enlisted during the war.115 The high number of casualties compelled Stalin to conscript women into the Red Army, in particular female Komsomols who had volunteered in the summer of 1941 but had yet to be cleared for armed combat. Over the course of several recruitment waves beginning in 1942, a total of 1 million women entered the armed forces. The inexperience of the recruits led to panicked retreats, especially in the first months of war, prompting Soviet commanders to take drastic measures. Following a method implemented in the Civil War and then again in the Winter War,116 they deployed blocking squads ordered to shoot soldiers who were unwilling to fight and could not be persuaded in any other way. Order no. 270, issued by Stalin in August 1941, branded any Red soldier captured alive a traitor to his country.117 The family members of imprisoned troops saw their benefits cut; wives of captive officers were often sent to labor camps. At the same time, the regime appealed to the soldiers’ sense of honor and sought to raise the morale of the commanders. As in the tsarist army, units that distinguished themselves through bravery and perseverance were granted Guards status. Leading the way in September 1941 were four divisions, “divisions of heroes,” as the army newspaper Red Star put it, their ranks “welded together like steel, firm and unshakable.”118\n\nGeneral Chuikov (pictured on the far left) presents the commander and the commissar of the 39th Rifle Division (both kneeling) with the Guards title in Stalingrad, January 3, 1943. The ceremony took place on the steep banks of the Volga. The division soldiers (outside the picture) kneel before the commanding officers. Photographer: Georgy Samsonov\n\nSoviet leaders put most of their stock in the political mobilization of Red Army soldiers. They banked on the influence of the Communist party and sought to increase it at every turn. As the war progressed, the number of party members in the Red Army rose steeply, and by July 1945 there were 2,984,750 party members, more than one in four, up from 654,000 at the war’s onset. Between 1941 and 1945 membership in the Young Communist League tripled to 2,393,345 soldiers who were Komsomol members. Taken together, these figures amount to a strongly communist army by war’s end.119 This development was consistent with the party’s earlier expansions—during the Civil War, when party membership increased by 600 percent, and once again during the first five year plan. By contrast, party membership contracted in the wake of the political purges (in 1921, 1933–1939, and starting again in 1944). To acquire as many new members as possible in a short period of time, the party simplified its admission criteria. In December 1941 the Central Committee shortened the trial period for new candidates from one year to three months. Moreover, applicants no longer needed to submit recommendations from longtime party members. Pragmatic considerations dictated some of these changes. The previous system was time-consuming and impractical in wartime, especially when the objective was to increase membership. Another obvious factor was the changing character of the party.120 Soldiers who before the war\n\nhad stood no chance of membership were now achieving glory and honor as party comrades. Captain Alexander Olkhovkin, the propaganda instructor for the 39th Guards Division, spoke of one such soldier in his interview. On November 19, 1942, some men from his division met to discuss the circulation of the general attack order. Olkhovkin joined the meeting as a sniper was speaking. The sniper, Olkhovkin remarked, was “completely uneducated. This is how he talks: ‘We was about to go on the attack.’ He’d say, ‘I knowed I was gonna be a sniper today.’ Before that he was a runner for the battalion commander. This man— Afonkin was his name—started working as a sniper. Over the course of eighteen days he racked up thirty-nine Hitlerites. Now he’s been admitted to the party and decorated.”121 In the war years the idea of a good party comrade was quite simple. A successful candidate had to prove that he had killed a German soldier, shot down an enemy plane, or taken out a panzer. Soldiers received forms known as “vengeance accounts” to record the number of opponents they killed and the number of weapons they destroyed. A soldier with an empty account had no chance of being admitted to the party.122 By contrast, someone like the sniper Vasily Zaytsev rose immediately to communist status—the number of Germans he killed was recommendation enough. As Zaytsev explained, “I thought, How can I join the party when I don’t know the program? I read the program and wrote my application right there in a trench. Two days later I was summoned to a party commission. By then I’d killed sixty Germans. I’d been decorated.”123 The ideal communist in wartime was occasionally described as bloodthirsty. Consider Colonel Nikolai Glamazda’s description of the final battle of a commissar named Yudayev, who led an assault unit in the 253rd Regiment of the 45th Division. When storming a German bunker, his: rifle was knocked out of his hands by a grenade fragment. Comrade Yudayev rushed at one of the unarmed Germans, grabbed him by the throat, and strangled him. The Germans threw in some reinforcements and again pounced on that handful of heroes. Yudayev was raised by the Germans on their bayonets but wouldn’t let go of his victim. Impaled and raised on bayonets, he was still holding on to his strangled German. So he had strangled him and died on the bayonets himself. The Germans overran that trench but after some time that company kicked them out of the dugout, took that hero Yudayev, and buried him by the third\n\nworkshop of the Red October plant.124 Colonel Dobryakov, the deputy director of the political department of the 64th army, described a similarly violent scene: The battery commander of the 154th Marine Brigade was put in charge of the defense. He had thirteen men including himself. He was ordered not to engage the Germans under any circumstances because he had so few men and the Germans were already advancing. He couldn’t bring himself to stay put, yelled “Hurrah!,” and attacked a company that was supported by machine guns. He drove them out, killing seven Germans himself. During that assault a piece of flesh was torn from his side. He went up to the brigade commander, Colonel Smirnov, and asked: “Comrade Colonel, can I have a little something to drink?” “Yes, of course,” said the colonel. And then the wounded battery commander held up that piece of flesh and asked: “Do you suppose this is worth seven Germans?”125 Needless to say, the missing flesh from the commander’s body guaranteed his admission to the party. As the war raged on, the party extended its influence by tailoring its political efforts to circumstances on the battlefield. Retaliation for the suffering inflicted by the enemy and the will to victory constituted a common denominator among the soldiers. “We are communists; we will avenge our murdered soldiers, commanders, and political officers.” To the mind of Ivan Vasiliev, commissar of the 62nd army, this expressed the overwhelming mood in the battle for Stalingrad.126 General Chuikov relayed to Vasily Grossman the hands-on quality of political education: “Political work: everything has only one purpose, and everything is done together with the soldiers. As for isms—communism, nationalism—we weren’t doing that.” Nevertheless, as Chuikov stressed when interviewed by historians, Soviet soldiers in Stalingrad demonstrated a high level of political consciousness.127 He meant that Red Army soldiers had internalized the “patriotic duty” promoted by the party to hold Stalingrad at all costs. For Chuikov, this was the essential reason for Soviet victory. During the battle of Stalingrad the Communist party made an extra effort to\n\ndeepen its influence. Between August and October 1942, the number of party members on the Stalingrad Front increased by 25,000, reaching a total of 53,500.128 By November membership surpassed 60,000.129 These numbers do not take into account battlefield losses and need an upward correction for an accurate total. Major Yakov Serov, the political department director of the 45th Division, provided some unit-level specifics. In the first months of the battle of Stalingrad, the 45th Division had 840 party members, of whom 163 died in battle and 405 were sidelined by injuries. During the same period, 659 additional soldiers joined the party. “People took joining the party very seriously and applied only when they had six, seven, ten Fritzes130 to their name. One would show up and claim: I have killed ten Fritzes. Here is my certificate. No commando would apply before opening his [vengeance] account.” Conveying what party membership meant for soldiers, Serov quoted from their applications: Junior Sergeant Ivan Sleptsov of the 178th Artillery Regiment expressed this wish: “In the fight with beastly fascism I want to be a communist. I will smite the enemy until my eyes can see and my hands can rotate the elevation and traverse wheels of my cannon. I will not disgrace the lofty rank of a Bolshevik warrior in the fight for the motherland. I ask to be admitted to the ranks of the Communist party, I ask that my request be granted. In these trying times when the destiny of mankind lies in the balance, our party is leading us to victory. I want to become its member, and under its banner my strength and hatred for the occupiers will grow ever more. The single-mindedness of the party is my own singlemindedness, and should I fall in battle, the party will avenge me. I swear to be its faithful member, to be its faithful defender to my last drop of blood.” And here is the application of Novitsky, a sergeant-major in our reconnaissance unit: “In these trying times when the destiny of mankind lies in the balance, our party is leading us to victory. I want to become its member, and under its banner my strength and hatred for the occupiers will grow ever more. The single-mindedness of the party is my own single-mindedness, and should I fall in battle, the party will avenge me. I swear to be its faithful member, to be its faithful defender to my last drop of blood.”131\n\nThe high casualty rates in the battle of Stalingrad supplied additional impetus to join the party. Party functionaries tried to persuade soldiers to submit their applications before combat. This way they could be certain of finding a place in the communist pantheon if they were killed. “They don’t want to join the Komsomol before entering combat,” reported 2nd Lieutenant Nikolai Karpov, the Komsomol secretary in the 38th Motorized Rifle Brigade. “They start looking for an excuse—‘let’s wait till after this fight.’ I put it to them bluntly: ‘How can you go fight? If you’re killed, you’ll die without being politically conscious. But if you die as a member of the Komsomol, you will die in glory.’ I got six people to join the Komsomol that way.”132 Several political officers reported that seriously injured soldiers asked to enter the party so they could die as communists. Sergeant Alexander Duka, also of the 38th Rifle Brigade, explained how the thought of death motivated him to join the party.133\n\nCOMMANDERS AND COMMISSARS The Communist party was ultimately governed by Joseph Stalin, the general secretary of the Central Committee. Known as the “boss” (khozyain) and the “leader” (vozhd), Stalin headed every institution relevant to the war effort from 1941 on: the State Committee for Defense, the People’s Commissar for Defense, and the Supreme High Command of the Red Army (the Stavka). The party made its influence felt in the military through the Main Political Administration of the Red Workers and Peasants Army (GlavPURKKA). In the war’s first year the administration was led by the former Pravda editor and communist rabble-rouser Lev Mekhlis. In 1942 the Moscow party secretary Alexander Shcherbakov succeeded him. That same year, Shcherbakov became a Politburo candidate member, a promotion that underlined the prominence of his office in the Red Army. The political administration exerted its power primarily via the commissars. At the highest levels, at the front and in the army, the commissar served on the military council, a cooperative body consisting of commanders, political delegates, and the chief of staff. Stalin’s confidant Nikita Khrushchev served as the commissar for the Stalingrad Front. Along with front commander Yeryomenko, he was the most important figure in the military council. This dual system extended to all levels of the army, though most of the political work took\n\nplace in the regiments. The system provided for two offices and their respective secretaries, one for the party, the other for the Komsomol, as well as a club for the soldiers and a library, all under the oversight of the regiment’s commissar. In the companies the politruks served as agitators in political discussions with soldiers and were responsible for finding suitable candidat"
