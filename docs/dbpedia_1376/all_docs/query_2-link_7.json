Autonomous oblasti (originally known as \"Labor Communes\") appeared in 1918, when ethnic groups were granted their own administrative divisions equal to oblasti. Autonomous okruga (to 1978, national okruga), established from 1925 on, were merely ethnic subdivisions of kraya and oblasti along with regular okruga (almost all regular okruga were abolished in 1930). Cities of republican subordination (from 1931) were industrial centers that were economically (but not administratively) separated from respective oblasti.\n\nKraya and oblasti that existed after the reorganization of 1922/29 and all autonomous (national) oblasti and okruga are recorded below. By 1980 the Russian S.F.S.R. was divided into 87 entities (15 autonomous soviet socialist republics, 6 kraya, 49 oblasti, 2 cities of republican subordination, 5 autonomous oblasti, and 10 autonomous okruga). Until 1991, almost all leaders were members of the Communist Party so their party affiliation are not noted below. Non-Russian names of entities below are given in attempted transliteration of modern Cyrillic orthography of respective language. During the Soviet period these entities (apart from the autonomous republics) did not have flags. For the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics: see here (from 25 Dec 1991 see Russia Administrative Divisions).\n\nParty abbreviations: KPSS = Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza (Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Marxist-Leninist communist, USSR state party to 13 Mar 1990, former VKP, 13 Oct 1952 - 29 Aug 1991); KPR = Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Rossiyskoy SFSR (Communist Party of the Russian SFSR, split from KPSS, 19 Jun 1990 - 6 Nov 1991; from 14 Feb 1993 Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Rossiyskoy Federatsii)\n\nfor Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics: see Part 1\n\nKraya Altay\n\n28 Sep 1937 Altay kray (Altayskiy kray)(split from Western Siberian\n\n[Zapadno-Sibirskiy] kray).\n\nFirst Secretaries of the Kray Committee of the Communist Party\n\nSep 1937 - Feb 1939 Leonid Nikolayevich Gusev (b. 1907 - d. 1985)\n\n(first secretary of the Organizing Bureau to Jun 1938)\n\nFeb 1939 - Oct 1940 Afanasiy Afanasyevich Andriyenko (b. 1907 - d. 1942)\n\nOct 1940 - Aug 1943 Vyacheslav Nikolayevich Lobkov (b. 1903 - d. 1971)\n\nAug 1943 - Jul 1955 Nikolay Ilyich Belyayev (b. 1903 - d. 1966)\n\nJul 1955 - 18 Mar 1961 Konstantin Georgiyevich Pysin (b. 1910 - d. 1984)\n\n18 Mar 1961 - 9 Apr 1976 Alexander Vasilyevich Georgiyev (b. 1913 - d. 1976)\n\n(chairman of the rural party committee 15 Jan 1963 - 19 Dec 1964)\n\n18 Jan 1963 - 19 Dec 1964 Mikhail Vitalyevich Vasilyev (b. 1923 - d. 2011)\n\n(chairman of the industrial party committee)\n\n23 Apr 1976 - 29 Jan 1985 Nikolay Fyodorovich Aksyonov (b. 1928 - d. 1985)\n\n18 Feb 1985 - 17 Feb 1990 Phillip Vasilyevich Popov (b. 1930 - d. 2007)\n\n17 Feb 1990 - 13 Apr 1990 Yuriy Ivanovich Zhil'tsov (acting) (b. 1940 - d. 2009)\n\n13 Apr 1990 - 27 Sep 1990 Aleksey Antonovich Kuleshov (b. 1936 - d. 2004)\n\n27 Sep 1990 - Aug 1991 Vitaliy Aleksandrovich Safronov (b. 1936)\n\nChairmen of the Executive Committee (to Jan 1940, Organizing Committee)\n\nSep 1937 - Jun 1938 Trofim Petrovich Babich-Dekan' (b. 1900 - d. 1972)\n\nJun 1938 - Jan 1943 Nikolay Andrianovich Smerdov (b. 1905 - d. 1958)\n\nJan 1943 - Aug 1943 Nikolay Ilyich Belyayev (s.a.)\n\nAug 1943 - Dec 1945 Pavel Nikolayevich Korchagin (b. 1901 - d. 1980)\n\nDec 1945 - Jul 1947 Grigoriy Pavlovich Kovalevskiy (b. 1905 - d. 1974)\n\nJul 1947 - May 1949 Anatoliy Mikhaylovich Batamirov (b. 1900 - d. 1983)\n\nMay 1949 - Jul 1955 Konstantin Georgiyevich Pysin (s.a.)\n\nJul 1955 - Jul 1960 Sergey Vasilyevich Shevchenko (b. 1914 - d. 1986)\n\nJul 1960 - Feb 1966 Stepan Vlasovich Kalchenko (b. 1908 - d. 1996)\n\n(chairman of the rural executive committee Dec 1962 - Dec 1964)\n\nDec 1962 - Dec 1964 Mikhail Stepanovich Andriyanov (b. 1917 - d. 1991)\n\n(chairman of the industrial executive committee)\n\nFeb 1966 - Jun 1973 Ivan Ilyich Molchaninov (b. 1918 - d. 1996)\n\nJun 1973 - Apr 1976 Nikolay Fyodorovich Aksyonov (s.a.)\n\nApr 1976 - Mar 1983 Vladimir Nikolayevich Rayevskiy (b. 1927 - d. 1994)\n\nApr 1983 - Apr 1987 Viktor Timofeyevich Mishchenko (b. 1928 - d. 1995)\n\nApr 1987 - Apr 1990 Aleksey Antonovich Kuleshov (s.a.)\n\nApr 1990 - Oct 1991 Yuriy Ivanovich Zhil'tsov (s.a.)\n\nHead of the Administration\n\n8 Oct 1991 - 20 Jan 1994 Vladimir Fyodorovich Rayfikesht (b. 1951)\n\nFar Eastern 6 Apr 1920 - 15 Nov 1922 Far Eastern Republic (Dal'nevostochnaya Respublika) independent\n\n(capital at Verkhneudinsk to 22 Oct 1920, then at Chita)\n\n(see under Russia).\n\n26 May 1921 - 25 Oct 1922 Primorye oblast in secession under \"White\" Russian administration\n\n(see under Russia civil war).\n\n15 Nov 1922 Far Eastern oblast (Dal'nevostochnaya oblast')(capital Chita),\n\nwithin Russian S.F.S.R.
