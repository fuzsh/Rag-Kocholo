        "text": "The Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to prompt sweeping sanctions and export controls from the United States, including, most recently, prohibitions on “new investment” in and the export/reexport/sale or supply of “services” to Russia (as to be determined by the U.S. Treasury Secretary), along with full blocking sanctions against Russia’s largest financial institution. Our team breaks down the latest measures:\n\nProhibitions on New Investment in Russia\n\nOn April 6, 2022, President Biden issued an expansive executive order (titled “Prohibiting New Investment in and Certain Services to the Russian Federation in Response to Continued Russian Federation Aggression”) that bans:\n\n“New investment” in Russia by a U.S. person (wherever located).\n\nThe export, reexport, sale, or supply (directly or indirectly) from the U.S. or by a U.S. person (wherever located), of “any category of services” as may be determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to “any person located in [Russia].”\n\n“Any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee” by a U.S. person (wherever located) of a “transaction by a foreign person” where such transaction is prohibited by the EO.\n\nPer a contemporaneous White House fact sheet, these measures — which, as noted above, are subject to further regulatory guidance from Treasury — are in lockstep with similar measures being taken by the European Union and member nations of the Group of Seven (G7).\n\nBlocking Sanctions\n\nSince our last update on U.S.-imposed sanctions, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC) has continued to designate a wide range of entities and individuals to its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List). Significant recent designations include the largest financial institution in Russia (Public Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia (Sberbank)), the largest privately owned financial institution in Russia (Joint Stock Company Alfa-Bank (Alfa-Bank)), top government officials throughout Russia (including 328 members of the Russian State Duma), and multiple entities operating in the defense and technology sectors.\n\nCritical to note is that even if not identified on the SDN List, the new blocking sanctions apply to entities owned 50% or more (directly or indirectly) by a listed entity or individual.\n\nThe latest blocking sanctions are detailed below:\n\nI. Sberbank and Alfa-Bank\n\nOn April 6, 2022, OFAC announced that it is adding Sberbank and Alpha-Bank to the SDN List.

Moreover, 25 entities have been added under the destination of Russia for “acquiring and attempting to acquire items” subject to the EAR in support of Russia’s military modernization efforts.\n\nMore recently, on April 7, 2022, BIS announced that it has denied export privileges (via Temporary Denial Orders) for three Russian Airlines — Aeroflot, Azur Air and UTair — due to violations of newly-issued EAR requirements that impose expanded license requirements for the export, reexport or transfer (in-country) to Russia of any aircraft or aircraft parts on the Commerce Control List. This announcement follows BIS’s identification on March 18, 2022, of 100 commercial and private aircraft recently exported to Russia in contravention the new EAR requirements. In its March 18 announcement, BIS warned that “any subsequent actions” involving the 100 identified aircraft, including, but not limited to, “refueling, maintenance, repair, or the provision of spare parts or services” are subject to General Prohibition Ten (GP 10) of the EAR (Section 736.2(b)(10)), which prohibits an individual or entity from proceeding with a transaction knowing that a violation of the EAR has occurred or is about to occur.\n\nFor More Information"
