        "text": "This page contains private data of Russian FSB employees from the frontline regions. The register contains only those individuals who are employed and operate in the territories of Russia bordering Ukraine: Rostov, Voronezh, Belgorod, Kursk, and Bryansk regions.\n\nYou can find more information about FSB employees on the general information page. We separate the register of Russian FSB employees from the frontline regions from the general register because the information about the persons involved comes from different informants and covers different territories. Since these individuals are part of the Russian security structure, we consider them to be involved in the planning and implementation of terrorist acts on the territory of Ukraine and other states.\n\nDuring the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops, the role of Russian security forces became critical to the war effort. Russian FSB employees from the frontline regions recruit people in Ukraine, including minors, to obtain data on the movements of the Defense Forces, the location of critical infrastructure facilities, and other potential targets of terrorist attacks. They use this information to adjust missile and artillery strikes. In addition to collecting data for shelling, FSB employees from the frontline regions support the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops in various ways."
