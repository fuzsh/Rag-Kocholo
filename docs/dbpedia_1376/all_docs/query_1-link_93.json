        "text": "Yevgeni Bauer was the most important filmmaker of the early Russian cinema, who made about eighty silent films in 5 years before the Russian Revolution of 1917.\n\nHe was born Yevgeni Frantsevich Bauer in 1865, in Moscow, Russia, into an artistic family. His father, Franz Bauer, was a renown musician who played zither, his mother was an opera singer, and his sisters eventually became stage and cinema actresses. From 1882 - 1887 he studied at Moscow School of Art, Sculpture and Architecture, graduating in 1887, as an artist. At that time Bauer worked for Moscow theatres as a stage artist as well as a set designer for popular musicals and comedies. He was also known as a newspaper satirist, a caricaturist for magazines, a journalist, and a theatrical impresario. During the 1900s he became involved in still photography and worked as an artistic photographer, having several of his pictures published in the Russian media.\n\nIn 1912, Bauer was hired by A. Drankov and Taldykin as a production designer for Tryokhsotletie tsarstvovaniya doma Romanovykh (1913), then he became a film director for their company. After making four films as director for A. Drankov, he moved on to work for Pathe's Star Film Factory in Moscow, and made another four films for them. In 1913, Bauer was invited by the leading Russian producer Aleksandr Khanzhonkov. Their fruitful collaboration would last only four years, yielding about 70 films, of which less than a half survived. Among Bauer's best works with Khanzhyonkov were such films as Nach dem Tode (1915), Zhizn za zhizn (1916), and Revolyutsioner (1917), starring Ivane Perestiani as an Old revolutionary.\n\nBauer reached his peak in the genre of social drama, such as Tagtr√§ume (1915) (aka.. Daydreams), starring Alexander Wyrubow as Sergei, an obsessed widower who falls for an actress because of her resemblance of his late wife, but soon their characters clash, leading to a tragic end. Soon Yevgeni Bauer established himself as the leading film director in Russia. He achieved great financial success earning up to 40,000 rubles annually. In 1914, Bauer started using his wife's name, Ancharov, as his artistic name, due to the political pressure from rising Russian nationalism during the First World War, so he was credited as Ancharov in some of his films. Bauer was the main force behind successful careers of major Russian silent film stars of that time, such as Ivan Mozzhukhin and Vera Kholodnaya. With Vera Kholodnaya, Bauer made thirteen films back-to-back in one year. In Nach dem Tode (1915) and Umirayushchiy lebed (1917), Bauer cast none other than Vera Karalli, the legendary ballerina of the Boshoi Theatre and Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.\n\nBauer's style evolved from his experience as a theatre artist, actor and photographer who incorporated theatrical techniques in his films in a uniquely cinematic way. His mastery of lighting, his use of unusual camera angles and huge close-ups, his inventive and thoughtful montage and such theatrical effects as long shots through windows or his use of gauzes and curtains to alter the screen image, all these innovations were decades ahead of his time. Bauer was one of the first film directors who used the split screen. He introduced a multi-layered staging involving juxtaposed foreground and background with lush decor and thoughtful compositions alluding to classical paintings of the old masters. He developed ingenious camera movements, showing a remarkable depth of field, and achieving powerful dramatic effects. Bauer's vision and inventiveness, his integrated skills as artist, actor, photographer, and director, made him the leading filmmaker of the early Russian cinema.\n\nRussia was a tough place for film and entertainment business, becoming increasingly unstable during the turbulent years of the First World War. Then Russian culture and film industry suffered from a cascade of troubles and destructions caused by several Russian Revolutions. However, by 1917 several major Russian film studios became established in Yalta, Crimea, near the Tsar's palaces and lush villas of other major patrons, where social environment of an upscale resort with a Mediterranean climate provided special conditions conducive for filming all year round. Bauer moved to Yalta and continued his work at the newly established Khanzhyonkov film studio, becoming also its major shareholder. There Bauer directed his last masterpiece, Za schastem (1917) (aka.. For happiness), passing the torch to his apprentice, Lev Kuleshov, who replaced the ailing Bauer in the role as painter Enrico, which Bauer wanted to play himself, but unfortunately he fell and broke his leg.\n\nIn spite of his illness, Bauer used a wheelchair, and began directing his last film, Korol Parizha (1917), which was initially designed as his largest project, but was ended as his last song. His broken leg and unexpected complications interrupted his work as he became bedridden in a Yalta hospital. The film was completed by actress Olga Rakhmanova and his colleagues at Khanzhyonkov studio. Yevgeni Bauer died of pneumonia on 22nd of July (9th of July, old style), 1917, in Yalta, Crimea, and was laid to rest in Yalta cemetery, Yalta, Crimea, Russia (now Yalta, Ukraine).\n\nBauer was married to actress and dancer Emma Bauer (nee Ancharova), whom he met in the 1890s during his stint as a theatre artist. In 1915 Lina Bauer starred as a flirtatious wife who hides her lover in a closet and successfully outwits her husband in Bauer's comedy Tysyacha vtoraya khitrost (1915) (aka.. The 1002nd Ruse). Bauer's sister, Emma Bauer also starred in several of his films.\n\nLev Kuleshov was a Russian director who used the editing technique known as the \"Kuleshov effect.\" Although some of the editing innovations, such as crosscutting were used by other directors before him, Kuleshov was the first to use it in the Soviet Russia. he was driving a Ford sports car amidst hard situation in the post-Civil war USSR, and remained a controversial figure who joined the Soviet communist party and destroyed archives of rare silent movies during his experiments, thus clearing way for his own works: documentaries and feature films ranging from political cinema to timeless gems.\n\nHe was born Lev Vladimirovich Kuleshov on 1 January, 1899, in Tambov, Russia. His father, Vladimir Kuleshov, belonged to Russian landed gentry, was a patron of arts and owner of a private estate in Central Russia. His mother, Pelagea Shubina, was a teacher before she married his father. His parents understood his weaknesses (poor speaking ability and bouts of depression) and strengths (a sharp eye, persistence and determination). His forte was the ability to see what for others remained unseen. Young Kuleshov received exclusive private education at the home of his father who had a degree from Moscow Art College. After the death of his father, 15-year-old Kuleshov and his mother moved to Moscow. There he studied art and history at the prestigious Stroganov School, then continued his studies at Moscow School of Painting, Architecture and Sculpture focusing on oil painting.\n\nIn 1916 he started his film career as a set designer at the Moscow film studio of Aleksandr Khanzhonkov and occasionally acted in some of its productions. He played a young lover opposite Emma Bauer, a stunning beauty, whom he truly fell in love with even before the filming started. That was the silent film Za schastem (1917). Watching himself on the silver screen, young Kuleshov was disappointed with the comic effect of his acting conflicting with naturalism of his true feelings. He decided to focus on directing and developing the style of his own. His new friend, experienced film-maker Akhramovich-Ashmarin, introduced him to American school of film-making, which also influenced his work.\n\nWith the help from Khanzhonkov's leading cinematographer, Yevgeny Bauer, Kuleshov made his first experimental works in editing. In 1917, he made his first publication in 'Vestnik Kinematografii': in three consecutive articles Kuleshov trashed the \"salon\" traditions of his employer by writing about an artist's role in converting film industry into a new form of art. His directorial career began under the patronage of Bauer, with whom Kuleshov worked as art director on such films, as Nabat (1917) and Za schastem (1917), and completed the latter as director after the original director Bauer died. In 1918, Kuleshov made his directorial debut with 'Project of Engineer Prite', and the film brought him attention of film studio executives who gave the 19-year-old beginner a chance to participate in documenting the early history of the Civil War-era Russia.\n\nFollowing the Russian revolution of 1917, Kuleshov joined the Bolsheviks and sided with the Red Army in the Russian Civil War of 1918-1919, which was a continuation of the First World War. He covered the war on the Eastern front with a documentary crew. After the end of the Civil War, the Communist Party solidified control of the country, thus helping Kuleshov's career. His friend, Vladimir Gardin, appointed him instructor at the Moscow Film School. There he made a career as director and teacher. In 1920, he directed a war film Na krasnom fronte (1920), a government sponsored film about the Red Army. For some time Kuleshov continued wearing the Red Army uniform, to show his loyalty to the new government.\n\nHe studied the techniques of Hollywood directors, particularly D.W. Griffith and Mack Sennett and introduced such innovations as crosscutting in editing and montage into Russian cinema. For his experiments Kuleshov was cutting old silent films from the archives of Khanzhonkov, Bauer and other private studios nationalized by the socialist govenment. Kuleshov used the archives of old silent movies for his own cutting experiments and thus most of the film archives was destroyed. Kuleshov remained quiet about this part of his career when he experimented with editing technique. He focused on putting two shots together to achieve a new meaning.\n\nThe \"Kuleshov effect\" is using the Pavlovian physiology to manipulate the impression made by an image and thus to spin the viewer's perception of that image. To demonstrate such manipulation, Kuleshov took a shot of popular Russian actor Ivan Mozzhukhin's expressionless face from an early silent film. He then edited the face together with three different endings: a plate of soup, a seductive woman, a dead child in a coffin. The audiences believed that Ivan Mozzhukhin acted differently looking at the food, the girl, or the coffin, showing an expression of hunger, desire, or grief respectively. Actually the face of Ivan Mozzhukhin in all three cases was one and the same shot repeated over and over again. Viewers own emotional reactions become involved in manipulation. Images spin those who are prone to be spun. Although editing and montage have already been used in art, architecture, fashion, politics, book publishing, theatrical productions and religious events (just look at placement of icons in churches, or photos in books, or pictures at exhibitions), the use of such editing in silent films was innovative and eventually led to more advanced visual effects.\n\nVsevolod Pudovkin, who claimed to have been the co-creator of Kuleshov's experiment, later described how the audience \"raved about the acting... the heavy pensiveness of Ivan Mozzhukhin's mood over the soup, the deep sorrow with which he looked on the dead child, and the lust with which he observed the woman. But we knew that in all three cases the face was exactly the same.\" Kuleshov demonstrated the effect of editing that was successfully used in montage of such films, as Panzerkreuzer Potemkin (1925) and Das Ende von St. Petersburg (1927) among other Soviet films. Kuleshov's good education, as well as his connections among Russian intellectual elite also helped his career.\n\nAt that time, Kuleshov and a group of his students, among them actress Aleksandra Khokhlova, collaborated on several movies that are now generally regarded as seminal films in Russian cinema. Among them are Neobychainye priklyucheniya mistera Vesta v strane bolshevikov (1924), a satire on clash of civilizations showing naive American Christian pastor who comes to Russia just to be robbed twice, but then helped by exemplary Soviet policeman. In 1926 he produced his most popular film, S√ºhne (1926), based on a Jack London story. The movie was successful in Russia and especially in Europe. In 1933, he directed Velikiy uteshitel (1933), based on biography of American writer O. Henry. The film was highly praised by Osip Brik and Lilya Brik. It was an interesting advancement in Kuleshov's experimental style.\n\nIn 1936, he received his Ph.D and became professor of directing and Moscow Film School. In 1941, Kuleshov's book 'Osnovy kinorezhissury' (aka... Fundamentals of Film Direction) was published in Moscow. Kuleshov was promoted to high position within the Soviet film industry and was designated Doctor of Science for the book, which was translated in several languages and became regarded among filmmakers worldwide.\n\nDuring WWII, Kuleshov made two films. One, made in collaboration with writer Arkadiy Gaydar, was Klyatva Timura (1942). To complete the film, Kuleshov with his film crew was moved on Soviet government expense from cold Moscow to warm Stalinabad, the capital of Turkmenistan. There, in 1943, together with his wife, Aleksandra Khokhlova, he directed his last movie, My s Urala (1944), a film about young Soviet boys making heroic efforts in the Eastern Front of WWII. After that, he returned from Central Asia back to Moscow. The Soviet capital was recovering after attacks of Nazi armies. For his contribution to art, and also for his dedication to communist ideas, a prestigious position as Artistic Director of the Moscow Film Institute (VGIK) where he worked for the next 25 years. Over the course of his career, his students were hundreds of Soviet filmmakers, such as directors Vsevolod Pudovkin, Boris Barnet, Mikhail Kalatozov and many others. His most trusted and devoted friend was Sergei Eisenstein.\n\nKuleshov visited Paris and presented a retrospective of his films in 1962. There he enjoyed much attention from international media. His friends in the Western world included many celebrities, such as Yves Montand, Louis Aragon, Elsa Triolet among others. Kuleshov was member of the Jury at 1966 Venice Film Festival and attended other film festivals as a special guest. He made several exclusive trips outside of the Soviet Union.Kuleshov was a friend of the State security chief, KGB General V.N. Merkulov.\n\nKuleshov was awarded Order of Lenin, Order of Red Banner, was designated People's Artist of Russia (1969), and received other decorations and perks from the Soviet government.\n\nOutside of his film career, Lev Kuleshov was fond of hunting, he owned a collection of exclusive hunting guns and often used them to kill game outside of Moscow and in Southern Russia. He also spent much time at Mediterranean resort near Yalta in Crimea and often made hunting trips in that area. Kuleshov was married to his student Aleksandra Khokhlova, and lived with his wife in a prestigious block on Lenin Prospect in central Moscow. There he died in 1970, and was laid to rest in Moscow's most prestigious Novodevichy Cemetery. Kuleshov's funeral took place while the Soviet Union was celebrating the centennial anniversary of the former leader Vladimir Lenin.\n\nViktor Tourjansky was a Russian film director who emigrated after the communist revolution of 1917, and worked in France, Germany, USA, UK, and Italy.\n\nHe was born Viacheslav Konstantinovich Turzhanski on March 4, 1891, in Kiev, Ukraine, Russian Empire (now Kiyiv, Ukraine). Studied painting and art history. In 1911 he moved to Moscow and studied acting under Konstantin Stanislavski and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko. In 1912-1914, Tourjansky worked for Aleksandr Khanzhonkov. He made his film debut as an actor in 'Tragedia pereproizvodstva' (1912), and co-starred in 'Brothers' (1913) by director Pyotr Chardynin, and in several other silent films. From 1914-1919 he worked in Yalta for Joseph N. Ermolieff, owner of one of the most successful Russian silent-film companies. At that time Tourjansky directed over twenty silent films in Russia.\n\nTourjansky suffered terribly from the loss of his property after the Communist Revolution of 1917. However, he continued working in Yalta with Ermolieff until the end of 1919. But when the Red Army advanced in Crimea and reached Yalta, he joined the White Russians and fled the communist Russia at the end of the Civil War. Tourjansky managed to save a few rolls of his silent films, which he took aboard the Greek steamer \"Pantera\" in February of 1920. He left Russia together with his film partners from the Ermolieff film company, actors Ivan Mozzhukhin, Nicolas Koline and Nicolas Rimsky, actress Nathalie Lissenko, his wife Nathalie Kovanko, cinematographer Nikolai Toporkoff and producer Joseph N. Ermolieff. They emigrated together to Paris, France, and started a Russian-French film company.\n\nIn Paris, Tourjansky changed his first name to Viktor (Victor) and continued his collaboration with Russian producers Alexandre Kamenka and Joseph N. Ermolieff. During 1920s and 1930s he also collaborated with producer Gregor Rabinovitch and directed films for various French, British, and German studios. Tourjansky often filmed his wife, Russian actress Nathalie Kovanko. She starred in fourteen of his films made in Russia and Europe. Eventually Tourjansky separated from Nathalie Kovanko, and later she returned to the Soviet Union.\n\nBethween WWI and WWII, Tourjansky directed over thirty French, British, American, and Franco-German films. He collaborated with director Abel Gance on the innovative film Napoleon (1927). In 1927 Tourjansky came to Hollywood. There, from 1927 - 1930, he worked at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios where he re-united with his former teacher, Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, who visited from Russia. Tourjansky was co-director of the Academy Award-winning film Wetterleuchten (1928), albeit he was uncredited. In Hollywood Tourjansky was hired to direct After Midnight (1927), but he questioned the talent of Norma Shearer, mentioning that the \"Queen of MGM\" had a cross-eyed stare, without knowing that she was about to marry Irving Thalberg, the powerful MGM producer. Tourjansky was fired from the project, and was sent to co-direct a western, The Adventurer (1927), on location in the inhospitable Mohave Desert. After he suffered for several weeks working in the sandy, windy, and hot desert, and dealing with nerve-wrecking logistical problems, Tourjansky did not achieve the result he wanted for the film. He became disillusioned and dissatisfied, and never wanted to direct another Hollywood film.\n\nBack in Paris, Tourjansky opened his own office and re-established himself among the French-Russian film community. He was tirelessly wooing investors for his new projects, networking among intellectuals and businessmen of all backgrounds, including famous Russian √©migr√©s in Paris, such as Aleksandr Kuprin and Yevgeni Zamyatin, as well as French, German, and British producers. Eventually his persistence and determination produced successful results. In 1931, Tourjansky spotted then unknown 21-year-old Simone Simon on the terrace of the Caf√© de la Paix. He made her a famous actress after their first film together, Le chanteur inconnu (1931) (The Unknown Singer 1931). Tourjansky and Simon worked together again in Schwarze Augen (1935).\n\nIn 1936 he was hired by UFA-Film and moved to Potsdam-Babelsberg, then to Munich, Bavaria. There he worked for the rest of his life as film director and producer. Tourjansky made success with Der Blaufuchs (1938) (The Blue Fox 1938), a comedy starring Swedish actress Zarah Leander, who was rumoured to be a Soviet-controlled agent and a mistress of Adolf Hitler. Tourjansky himself had several personal meetings with the Reichskanzler during the late 1930s, and was summoned to make several propaganda films, such as Feinde (1940). As a consequence his reputation among the cosmopolitan film community had suffered.\n\nAfter the Second World War, he lived in Munich, and worked for various film studios with various results. His last film made in the Nazi Germany, a criminal drama Orient-Express (1944), was released after the war. In 1950, he directed Der Mann, der zweimal leben wollte (1950) (The Man Who Wanted to Live Twice 1950), a film starring the famous Russian √©migr√© actress Olga Tschechowa. Later Tourjansky directed period epic films, such as Herodes - Blut √ºber Jerusalem (1959), Wolgaschiffer (1959), Aufstand der Tscherkessen (1960), and La donna dei faraoni (1960), some of which were considered among his better works. During the 1950s and 1960s he was wintering in Italy and worked there as producer and writer under the artistic name Arnaldo Genoino. Viktor Tourjansky died on August 13, 1976, in Munich, Germany."
