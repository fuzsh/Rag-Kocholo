        "text": "SANCTIONS Part 1 Today's missile attack on Ukraine made me recall my speech on the sanctions panel at ABA WCC Institute in London back on October 10th, 2022. By the way, Kara Bombach is a terrific moderator and made a great job putting us together with Marleen Velthuis and Giles Thomson. That morning also started with heavy shelling, the first time deliberately targeted electricity infrastructure. That made me rethink what I planned to say to the audience. What are sanctions for? First of all, one thinks of an economic effect that would make the aggressor stop. However, for us, Ukrainians, it is much more. While cruise missiles were heading to Kyiv, I was thinking that now it is all about high technologies and high-tech productions. Namely, now cruise missile production requires microchips. Russia can construct missiles, but it cannot produce microchips. So for us, impeding microchips and another high-tech stuff supply to russia is actually a matter of survival. Let me give you an example. Today russia launched 76 (!!!) cruise missiles and 27 C-300 missiles over Ukraine. On the other hand, according to intelligence data, russians are about to run out of stock. They need to produce new missiles in order to continue with their attacks. BUT! they desperately need those microchips to continue with productions. and we desperately need effective sanctions mechanisms just to survive. https://lnkd.in/epSt4Ggn (post 38) #sanctions #sanctionscompliance #economicsanctions #WarInUkraine #StopRussianAggression #warcrime #warcrimes #ukraine #UALawyerUpdateOnWar"
