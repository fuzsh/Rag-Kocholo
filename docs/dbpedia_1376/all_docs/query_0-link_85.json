        "text": "The famous Russian actor Vyacheslav Tikhonov was hospitalized to one of the Moscow clinics on December 1. The 81 year old Vyacheslav Vasilyevich suffered a secondary small-focal myocardial infarction and his condition was very risky.\n\nDoctors did their best to stabilize his state, but unexpected complications occurred. Today at 3.35 pm the great actor passed away.\n\nVyacheslav Tikhonov debuted in cinema when a student, in Sergei GerasimovÂ’s film The Young Guard, a screen version of the same-name novel by Alexander Fadeyev (1948).\n\nEpochal became his role of Prince Andrei Bolkonsky in the world-famous War and Peace (1967) directed by Sergei Bondarchuk. In 1973 Vyacheslav Tikhonov started working with the film director Tatyana Lioznova on the TV series Seventeen Moments of Spring, where he starred as the Soviet intelligence agent working in the Nazi Germany under the name of Stirlitz.\n\nSource: oreanda.ru"
