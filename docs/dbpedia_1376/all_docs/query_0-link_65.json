        "text": "This book examines the artistic policies of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) during the early post-war years (1944-1951), after the defeat of Fascism in Europe and the outbreak of the Cold War. It brings together theoretical debates on artists’ political engagement and an extensive critical apparatus, providing the reader with an historical framework for wider reflections on the relationship between art and politics. After 1944, the PCI became the biggest communist organisation in the West, placing Italy in an ambiguous position regarding the other European countries. Nevertheless, the immediate strategy of the communists was not revolution, but liberation from Fascism and the establishment of a democratic system from which a genuine Italian path to socialism could be found. Taking Antonio Gramsci’s notion of hegemony as a theoretical basis, the Communists intended to generate a progressive social bloc capable of achieving wide consensus within civil society before taking power. In order to accomplish this goal, the collaboration from intellectuals was necessary. The artistic policy of the Italian Communist Party was tailored to this end, counting on representatives from all groups and tendencies of the time, particularly those artists who rejected the imperialistic, autarchic pseudo-classicism that characterised most of Italian art throughout the fascist years. In the 1930s, international, Modernist and cosmopolitan European culture became an escape route to artists seeking a way out of the oppressive cultural atmosphere of inter-war Italy. However, in the 1940s and 1950s, many of these artists experienced a deep transformation in their work after they became politically involved with the PCI, and were exposed to international communist culture—and socialist realism in particular. This was conveyed not only by conscious changes in their subjects, their style and their material means of expression, but also in the public they addressed and in their own conception of themselves as artistic authors. Hence, at a time when the world was divided into two opposed camps, each heavily inflected by ideological allegiance and supported by powerful propaganda apparatuses, Italian communist artists became the protagonists of a novel intellectual-political project which pursued the synthesis between antagonistic cultural blocs.\n\nScholarship on collective memory often conceives struggles over the past as directly dependent on the structure of interests in the present. However, temporal constraints affect the way the past is selected and represented. In this article I focus on the appropriation of the memory of the Resistance by the Italian Communist Party in the years between 1943 and 1948. I highlight, following a growing literature on the path dependence of memory, that the consolidation of the memory of this period was conditioned not only by the political culture of the organization, but also by the internal dynamics and the specific genre of communist commemoration.\n\nThis essay examines the Italian fotoromanzo (photoromance) as a case study, vis-à-vis questions of cultural hierarchies, gender representations, and governance. In particular, it focuses on the photoromances published by the Catholic magazine Famiglia Cristiana and by the Office of Propaganda of the Italian Communist Party in the late 1950s, in the context of the heated debate exploded in the press against the popular media. Italian journalists, film critics, Christian Democratic and Communist politicians alike blamed photoromances, published in women’s magazines such as Bolero Film and Grand Hotel, for corrupting or stultifying women. This essay highlights differences and continuities in social and cultural discourses, between the products of Catholic, Communist, and corporate publishers, with particular regard to femininity, womanhood, and consumer culture. In this way, it also explores similarities between Catholic and Communist models of social, sexual and moral conduct.\n\nObservers who have investigated Alleanza Nazionale's relationship to historical fascism have mostly relied on programmatic documents as well as Gianfranco Fini's speeches and interviews. This article tackles the same question by considering the visual propaganda produced by the party from its launch in 1994 to its merger with Silvio Berlusconi's Popolo della Libertà in March 2009. An examination of the logos, the portraits of Fini and other imagery that feature on posters, brochures, websites and the Secolo d'Italia shows that they frequently refer, albeit mostly covertly, to the iconographies of fascism. The contemporary visual sources used by Alleanza Nazionale and the strategies adopted to present a modern and respectable image are also explored. The article argues that much of the propaganda of Alleanza Nazionale incorporates two levels of meaning: an overt and moderate one, which addressed the general public, and a concealed one celebrating ideas and values of the Ventennio, which aimed to reassure a hard-core of activists that the party had not betrayed its original identity.\n\nWith a focus on the trope of masculinity, this essay draws an analytical line between the erotic power of the Uomo Nuovo (New Man) of Fascist inspiration and the treatment of the Christ-like body in photography of resistance fighters. The way in which the Italian state manifested an image of masculine power in photographs published in mainstream magazines is contrasted with the little-circulated humanist photography connected to anti-Fascist circles, like Alberto Lattuada’s Occhio Quadrato published, distributed and immediately censored by the Fascist police in 1941. Resistance photography furthers the argument of the essay, which brings to light a welter of photography used in the Exhibition of the Liberation, opened in Milan on 7 July 1945. Sponsored by the Italian Communist Party and endorsed by the Allied Commission, the exhibition showed the war as it had been photographed by the Partisans, with strikes, sabotage action, warfare, torture scenes, dead and wounded bodies. It contributed, through its expiation of Fascism, an important chapter to Italian photographic politics and to the explosion of humanist photography after the war. Lying in the archives of the National Institute for the Liberation Movement of Italy (INSMLI) in Milan, this photography has remained under-examined to date. Partisans sought to project an image that had little to do with the commodified, eroticized, god-like masculinity implicit in the image of the Fascist soldier. And yet they needed to adopt visual codes by which they could inspire awe and a sense of dignity. Between 8 September 1943 and the Liberation, Partisans were photographed by British and American Allies, Nazis, Fascists and by other Partisans, in turn subdivided into, amongst others, Communists, Socialists, Liberals, Anarchists, Catholics and Catholic Communists. After the Liberation, Partisans photographed reconstructed scenes of Resistance action to build a more strategic monothematic winning narrative, often imitative of Hollywood action movies. The resulting image of the Partisan was both reality and myth, reflecting the ideologically complex terrain in which photographers were working, in accordance with different directives and censorship regulations. The essay ultimately seeks to show the way in which the Resistance sought to recuperate a powerful image by appealing to a paradoxical anti-Fascist style of power."
