        "text": "Exposure watercolors Soviet classic Sergei Gerasimov, which opens on October 29 in the exhibition hall of the magazine \"Our Heritage\", will have a new look on his work\n\nGallery \"GOST\", magazine \"Our Heritage»\n\n29 October - 23 November 2012\n\nShowroom magazine \"Our Heritage»\n\nMoscow, 1 Neopalimovsky per. 4\n\nJoint Project Gallery GOST and the magazine \"Our Heritage\" is timed to the 80th anniversary of the Moscow Union and highlights a little known section of the work of one of its first President - Gerasimov (1885-1964), the largest of the master of Soviet art, whose professional career was not without contradictions and paradoxes. The display represents the viewer watercolors from the collection of the artist's family. Despite the exposure chamber format, it significantly expands and in many ways \"rewrite\" an established pattern of his work. The exhibition highlights the important role of pre-revolutionary watercolor SV Gerasimov in his later artistic searches and allows you to appreciate the rich range of creative masters, often going beyond the narrow scope of the official Soviet style paintings.\n\nSergei Gerasimov Gloomy Forest. 1908\n\nPaper, watercolor, white 45,5 × 38,5\n\nSource: Press Release Gallery GOST\n\nSergei Gerasimov The girl with a flower. 1908\n\nPaper, watercolor, white 46 × 46\n\nSource: Press Release Gallery GOST\n\nIn traditional stories of Soviet art (which is still continuing objectively correct) name of Stalin's academic, People's Artist of the USSR, Professor Surikov Institute, chairman of the Moscow Union of Artists in the years 1938-1941 Sergey Vasilyevich Gerasimov associated with standard thematic paintings: \"Collective Farm Holiday\" (1937), \"Partisan's Mother\" (1943), \"For Soviet Power\" (1957), etc. In the less formal \"low\" genres Gerasimov encouragingly marked as sensitive \" Singer \"life of the common people, by rigorous and thoughtful expressive images\" peasants \",\" old women \",\" women \",\" men \",\" meschanok \", inherited from his teacher at the Stroganov School (1901-1907) late Wanderers Ivanov\" noble democratic beliefs. \" However, the artist often blamed for sometimes excessive enthusiasm \"glow luminous paint open-air\" (words Chegodaeva) acquired by him from the other favorite teachers - Konstantin Korovin and Abram Efimovich Arkhipov Abram .\n\nSergei Gerasimov A walk in the countryside. 1910\n\nPaper, watercolor, white 44 × 57\n\nSource: Press Release Gallery GOST\n\nSergei Gerasimov Lermontovskoye time. 1940\n\nWatercolor 46 × 58\n\nSource: Press Release Gallery GOST\n\nIn light of these accusations Gerasimov a long time, including the 1930-50s, was assessed as still forming, looking like an artist, are not always able to determine the depth of socialist realist art. Meanwhile, at the exhibition of watercolors in 1900-60's, hardly known to a wide audience as well as professionals, can be seen in Sergei Gerasimov's not the \"true believers\" ahrrovtsa 1920, later to become the \"standard\" socialist realist and gentle guardian and a connoisseur of the best pre-revolutionary traditions of paintings and drawings by the example of such masters as , Victor Borisov-Musatov , Nikolai Krymov , and so consonant with their art Light symbolist tone Gerasimov paradoxically combined in his landscapes, portraits, still lifes and genre scenes of different years with strong intelligibility realistic images , soft lyricism Isaac Ilich Levitan Isaac , perfect sharpness plastic solutions Valentin Serov . Defending in most such works tonal advantages exquisitely light, a little \"cloudy\" or \"misty twilight\" of color, Gerasimov builds a good read \"elegiac\" line of his art, was initially formulated within its early stages, but already quite mature works. That has indicated in his future career special aesthetic trend of \"immigration\" as a very common during the Soviet regime creative strategy, implying refreshing to-hidden \"alternative\" Stalinist officialdom. The exhibition provides an opportunity to understand that to date this proverbially known artist is still a truly little-known figure in Russian art of the twentieth century.\n\nElena Gribonosova-Grebneva, gallery G.O .
