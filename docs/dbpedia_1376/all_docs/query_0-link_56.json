        "text": "Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in October 1989, hopes were high that the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe would usher in a new era of openness. Swedish and Soviet officials accelerated their contacts to clarify some of the major open historical issues between the two countries. This article provides an overview of these efforts and discusses their effectiveness. From 1989 -2001, three cases were studied: The fate of the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg who disappeared in the Soviet Union in 1945; the loss of a DC-3 reconnaissance plane in June 1952 over the Baltic Sea with an eight men crew; and eighteen Swedish ships that disappeared during and after WWII, with altogether over one hundred people. The families of the missing also had great expectations that both Russia and Sweden would now be able to shed light on additional facts, since the overt reason for protecting certain secrets – the Soviet Union – was about to disappear. While the priority of the relatives of the disappeared was to win clarity about the fate of their loved ones, the Swedish and Russian governments shared other, coinciding (though not always identical) interests. As a result, they pursued a more pragmatic, 'Realpolitik' approach. While both sides stated publicly that they wished to establish the “full facts” in all three inquiries, their main priority arguably was to avoid any serious [political] controversy - or potential collateral damage - from the investigations and to win just enough clarity in order to be able to remove the subjects from the two countries’ official political agenda. Why did the collapse of communism not bring full clarification of these three major historical questions? Can the failure to solve the cases be simply ascribed to the complex constraints the investigators continued to face in the waning years of the Cold War? Or was this failure in some way intentional? The study of a vast set of documentation for all three inquires suggests that it was a complicated mixture of the two.\n\nFollowing the fall of the Berlin Wall in October 1989, hopes were high that the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe would usher in a new era of openness.
