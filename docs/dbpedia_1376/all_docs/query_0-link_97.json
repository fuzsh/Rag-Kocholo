        "text": "Scott Morrison is criticising the Coalition’s own climate policy – it’s just one that has barely been used\n\nScott Morrison and other government MPs are accusing Labor of planning to introduce a “sneaky carbon tax” by – wait for it – using an existing Coalition policy as it was intended.\n\nSounds ridiculous, right? Election campaign shamelessness on steroids. But there is a lot going on here and it is worth stepping through it.\n\nWhat is the policy?\n\nThe awkwardly named safeguard mechanism was created by Greg Hunt, the former environment minister and introduced under then prime minister Tony Abbott, a well-known climate sceptic. It was legislated in 2014 as part of what was then known as the Coalition’s “direct action” policy.\n\nA close look at the election campaign’s energy promises shows major parties still back fossil fuels | Temperature Check\n\nThe idea was that emissions limits would be set for the country’s biggest industrial sites, those that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. The limits – known as baselines – would stop “rogue” polluters from significantly increasing emissions and effectively wiping out any cuts the government paid for from farmers and others through its emissions reduction fund.\n\nThe baselines were meant to “safeguard” those cuts. If a company went over its baseline it would have to buy carbon credits to offset the extra pollution pumped into the atmosphere.\n\nIn practice, that hasn’t happened. Industrial emissions continue to increase – by 7% since the safeguard was introduced – as the government has mostly just allowed companies to increase baselines, or change the timeframe over which baselines are measured, without penalty.\n\nIndustry representatives, climate activists and analysts believe it has made the scheme a waste of time and have long called for an overhaul.\n\nHow has the government responded?\n\nThe government has refused to acknowledge that industrial emissions are an issue that need to be addressed now. Official government projections show they are not expected to be cut before 2030 under the Coalition’s policies.\n\nThe government’s ambition for the safeguard mechanism has reduced since its early days. Shortly before the landmark Paris climate conference in 2015, Hunt included it as part of Australia’s pledge to the summit and said it would be developed to cut emissions from industrial polluters by 200m tonnes between 2020 and 2030.\n\nBut the ministers who followed him – Josh Frydenberg, Melissa Price and Angus Taylor – have not repeated that claim, and the Coalition now has no plans to require industrial polluters to cut emissions.\n\nInstead, it assumes cleaner technology will eventually lead to businesses taking voluntary steps to deliver most emissions cuts. It has not explained the basis for this assumption in any detail.\n\nWhat is Labor proposing?\n\nThe Business Council of Australia, which in the past had campaigned for the abolition of the country’s carbon pricing scheme and described a science-based emissions target as “economy wrecking”, last year had something of a reversal on climate policy.\n\nIn October, the business council called for Australia’s climate target for 2030 to be increased to a 46% to 50% cut – more than Labor’s 43%, and nearly twice as much as the Coalition’s 26-28% – and released a policy blueprint. It said the safeguard should be “enhanced and expanded” to “deliver a strong carbon investment signal to invest in new low, zero and negative emissions technology”. Others, including the Australian Industry Group, support this position.\n\nDoes Labor plan to force the top 200 energy users and producers to cut emissions by 25%? | Temperature Check\n\nLabor’s safeguard policy, released in December, basically adopted the business council’s recommendations. It said if it was in government the baselines for the 215 major industrial sites covered by the safeguard would be cut “predictably and gradually” in a way that supported “international competitiveness and economic growth”.\n\nBig emitting export industries – coalmines, for example – would get “tailored treatment” to ensure they weren’t disadvantaged against other countries where there was not an equivalent scheme in place. Opposition MPs appeared to stumble trying to explain this, with some suggesting coalmines in the Hunter valley would be exempt, while the opposition climate change and energy spokesperson, Chris Bowen, said they would be included but their circumstances meant they wouldn’t face a hit.\n\nIt was mostly a semantic difference but it underlined that there are many details still to come if Labor wins. Modelling for the ALP by RepuTex suggests it could use the safeguard to cut emissions by 213m tonnes by 2030 – roughly similar to what Hunt proposed back in 2015 – while creating 1,600 mostly regional jobs. The policy said officials would work out new baselines in consultation with industry on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWhat would it mean for fossil fuel industries?\n\nPower generation is not included in the safeguard, but fossil fuel exports – coal and gas – are. Labor says that demand for thermal coal and liquified natural gas exports will fall as the world cuts emissions, but it would not penalise those industries against overseas competitors while people want to buy their product.\n\nThe Coalition’s net zero plan also acknowledges a long-term decline for coal and gas but has a different emphasis. It says both industries “will continue through to 2050 and beyond, supporting jobs and regional communities”. Given carbon capture and storage’s lack of economic viability, that appears to be banking on the world failing to address the crisis, a situation that would lead to worsening extreme weather and climate disasters.\n\nAmong the parties, only the Greens say Australia has a responsibility to significantly cut emissions from fossil fuel export industries in line with climate science. They want a levy on coal exports that would be used to fund climate disaster recovery and development of new clean exports, and for the industry to end by 2030.\n\nMorrison this week said the government had “put incentives in place” while “what Labor is doing is binding them on this and issuing penalties on those companies”. What did that mean? Is it fair?\n\nDear politicians, young climate activists are not abuse victims, we are children who read news | Anjali Sharma\n\nIt’s not exactly clear what incentives Morrison was referring to, but it seems likely he means a proposal to create a “safeguard crediting mechanism” that would allow companies that cut emissions below their baseline to earn credits they could sell. It was among the recommendations of a review in 2020 ordered by Taylor.\n\nIt is a contentious change – currently, some businesses have baselines set well above what they actually emit. If that was not properly addressed, the government could end up giving away credits to industry that has not made cuts.\n\nThe government has consulted industry on the design of this scheme and allocated $279.9m in funding over 10 years to buy credits. But the plan has yet not been introduced – so there are no “incentives in place”. Labor has proposed a similar change, but also released few details.\n\nBoth models sound a fair bit like a form of carbon trading but neither side concedes this.\n\nAs for Labor issuing penalties, Bowen has estimated about half of the cuts under the ALP safeguard plan could come from businesses using better technology, supported by a new $15bn national reconstruction fund. There are no penalties involved there.\n\nThe other half would come from industry buying carbon credits to offset their emissions. That already happens now, to a lesser extent. As Guardian Australia has reported, the Coalition model required 14 companies to buy 419,000 carbon credits at an estimated cost of more than $15m last financial year for breaching their emissions baselines.\n\nBoth parties plan to significantly expand the use of carbon credits, which have been in the news of late due to concerns over their credibility. Under its net zero plan, the Coalition says credits could deliver up to 20% of the emissions cuts needed by mid-century. It has not explained who would pay for these.\n\nSo, is the safeguard mechanism already a “sneaky carbon tax”?\n\nNo. As Katharine Murphy has pointed out, it is not a tax now, and won’t be under Labor’s changes. It is a scheme to limit and hopefully reduce pollution. Companies that go above their limit are required to offset the damage. That is not a tax under any normal definition.\n\nCoalition climate policy forced big polluters to pay $15m for carbon credits in past year\n\nThe bottom line is that the safeguard is a Coalition policy that has barely been used, but most experts think could be. Labor has strategically adopted its opponent’s model after repeat scare campaigns left it bruised and gun-shy on climate.\n\nThe Morrison government has built a hard-earned reputation as a global laggard on climate. It stuck with a low, seven-year-old 2030 emissions target despite significant international pressure, has no significant policies to cut emissions in that timeframe and claims a 20% emissions cut since 2005 despite most of that having come before it was elected in 2013.\n\nIt has a net zero emissions plan for 2050 that assumes the bulk of the work will come later, at odds with climate science advice, and does not actually add up to net zero. Despite the subsequent denials, LNP candidate and climate sceptic Colin Boyce was on to something this week when he said there is wriggle room in the net zero commitment.\n\nMeanwhile, Morrison is suggesting using the Coalition’s policy to do what it was designed to would be economically disastrous. That should be treated as what it is: a scare campaign and an argument for inaction.\n\nThe old adage that “if it’s too good to be true, it likely is,” definitely applies in this war, as I spent much of the day trying to verify fantastical claims from both sides. I even had to enlist Mark Sumner at one point to help me sort through one rumor of a major Ukrainian breakthrough toward Mariupol. Turns out, no one is making big sweeping gains. It’s all “lay down artillery until defenders get the f’ out, walk in. Leave when their artillery returns fire.” Rinse, lather, repeat.\n\nKutuzivka is a perfect example, as Ukraine claimed to have captured it back in April 8. Then, it was supposedly “partially” liberated on April 17. And here we are, today, confirmed fully captured. Given the heavy shelling in the area, it very well may have gone back and forth for a while. [Map at the link]\n\nRuska Lozova is on the main highway heading back to Russia, the largest town (pop. ~5,000) before the border. It would allow Ukraine to hit Kozacha Lopan up north on the border from three sides. Ukraine suffered heavy losses just a few days ago trying to take that town.\n\nI am curious why Ukraine is pushing so hard north of Kharkiv. Russia can sit on its own side of the border and shell Kharkiv with impunity, so I suspect it’s not about protecting the city, but the supply routes that flow to the south and south east—a way to prevent an exposed “Chuhuiv salient” as Ukraine pushes east toward the Russian supply hub of Kupiansk. By clearing the north, there’s no left flank to worry about.\n\nIt could also be a simple, emotional “get the f’ out of my land” effort. But given the limited scope of Ukraine’s offensive abilities at the moment, I doubt they’d waste them on symbolic gestures. Let’s head down south: [Map available at the link.]\n\nI spent way too much time trying to confirm the Oleksandrivka news before posting this. The terrain in the area is flat, open, and exposed. Look at the picture at the top of this story. That’s here. So one side lays down heavy artillery, drives out exposed defenders. That side waltzes in. But oh shit! The other side is now returning fire! So troops withdraw, and the other side moseys back in. So wait, who is in control of the town? No one, that’s who.\n\nOleksandrivka presents another challenge—it’s one of the most popular town name in Ukraine, with over 100 of them. At least four are in contested areas. There’s this one in Kerhson Oblast. But head north from Kherson toward Kryvyi Rih, and there’s another one. These two are a real pain to keep straight. [Map at the link.]\n\nThen there’s the two Oleksandrivkas near Izyum, on the Donbas front, one straight north, the other to its southwest. [More maps at the link.]\n\nI swear I’ve also seen one east of Izyum, and there’s likely several. So anytime someone reports “fighting in Oleksandrivka,” I groan and throw my hands up in the air.\n\nAnyway, looks like the one west of Kherson is back in Ukrainian hands after falling to Russia yesterday, which had been pushed out the day before, etc. Given how these battles are shaping up, don’t get overly invested in who holds what. It’s all fluid outside of key locations like Izyum, Kherson, Kharkiv, etc.\n\nThat’s the north and south, so what about the Donbas front in the west? Ukraine fended off nine separate attacks. Maybe there’s a big massive Russian offensive brewing somewhere, ready to be unleashed on Ukrainian lines on the Donbas front. I remain forever skeptical.\n\nThere is one change we’ve seen to Russian tactics: “The concentrated use of artillery by Russian forces in eastern Ukraine in April is one of the few major changes Russia has made to its operations compared to the early weeks of the war.” Before, Russia would send a bunch of kids to die against entrenched Ukrainian defenders. Now, those defensive positions are first shelled before Russia sends those kids to die. Most of the time, Ukrainian defenders remain, but every once in a while Russia gets lucky, the artillery does its job and clears out an area, and Russia can creep up a kilometer or two.\n\nGiven that around 5,000 square miles of Donbas territory remain in Ukraine’s hands, does anyone truly believes this is a winning strategy? Ukraine’s job is to hold their strongholds at Slovyansk (pop. 111,000) and Kramatorsk (pop. 157,000), while Russia burns through their troops, equipment, and ammunition in time for those sweet Western artillery guns to make their way to the front. [Map at the link]\n\nAs of now, Russia has a long way to go before directly threatening those two cities. Heck, a chunk of Russian forces are heading west of Izyum, in the wrong direction! You know those network of defenses that have held on the border with separatist Donbas? There’s a lot more of that around Slovyansk and Karamtorsk, and that’s before Russians even think about entering those cities, which would be its own special kind of hell.\n\nAnother 4-6 weeks, maybe, and then we can start talking about Season Three of this war.\n\nMeanwhile, the breakaway Russian-held territory of Transnistria in Moldova is on the verge of calling a general mobilization, blocking all military-age men from leaving the territory. Both Transnistria and Moldova don’t look to have have military forces worth a damn, and the 2-3,000 Russians stationed there wouldn’t be enough to seriously threaten Moldova. But the destruction of a Ukrainian bridge south of Odesa opens up an interesting possibility: Is Russia planning an amphibious assault? [Map available at the link.]\n\nBy blowing the bridge, Ukraine wouldn’t be able to defend an attack on Moldova from the sea, though I doubt it would be interested in trying anyway. Ukraine is sort of busy at the moment. Of more interest would be the chance to take out yet another landing ship, but this one full of Russian naval infantry. Ukraine doesn’t need that bridge to threaten any landing effort.\n\nWould Russia really be stupid enough to open up yet another front, spreading out its troops even further, and risk additional naval losses, for a logistically unsupported assault on a piece of land with zero value to the current war effort in Ukraine? Russia’s naval infantry is already heavily committed (and heavily attrited) in Mariupol. Meanwhile, don’t forget that in addition to losing their flagship Moskva guided missile cruiser, Russia also lost two landing ships in that “accident” in Berdyansk, offloading their gear for land operations after giving up on their Odesa dreams. Russia can’t reinforce either, with the Black Sea closed to military traffic by Turkey.\n\nSo is Russia that stupid? Doubtful. I’m guessing it’s psy-ops, destabilizing Moldova and keeping Ukrainian troops in the Odesa region on alert. Given the resources at their disposal, I just don’t see it physically possible for Russia to do this, no matter how much its generals may want to.\n\nThe entire Republican brand has been built on a wobbly foundation of vile lies and exaggerations. It has to be. How else do you convince people that cruelly suppressing flows of immigrants to a country that faces both short- and long-term labor shortages is a good idea? Or that harassing gay and trans kids and the companies that support them somehow makes up for scuttling a child tax credit that would vastly improve the lives of tens of millions of parents in this country?\n\nWithout Russian lies and misinformation, it’s a safe bet Donald Trump would have spent recent years snorting Adderall out of his carpet until his brain bled, repeatedly bragging about passing dementia tests, and tweeting incomprehensible nonsense from his toilet. Which is pretty much what he did anyway, of course—but he would have been doing it on his own time, and in his own home, not forcing us to observe every lurid plot twist in his profane horror show. And his toilet would likely have been powerful enough to completely flush all his embarrassing errors and revolting secrets […]\n\nSo it stands to reason that conservatives would freak about a new initiative to counter the disinformation upon which they rely.\n\nIt’s this news that has left the right shrieking:\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is stepping up an effort to counter disinformation coming from Russia as well as misleading information that human smugglers circulate to target migrants hoping to travel to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n“The spread of disinformation can affect border security, Americans’ safety during disasters, and public trust in our democratic institutions,” the department said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nOkay, that’s brutally unfair. Countering lies about immigration with the truth? How are Republicans supposed to demagogue the issue? […] And since Russian disinformation is now the lifeblood of the GOP, if they take that away, Trump is just a garden-variety traitor with 24/7 Secret Service protection.\n\nThe new board also will monitor and prepare for Russian disinformation threats as this year’s midterm elections near and the Kremlin continues an aggressive disinformation campaign around the war in Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly waged misinformation campaigns aimed at U.S. audiences to further divisions around election time and spread conspiracy theories around U.S. COVID-19 vaccines. Most recently, Russian state media outlets, social media accounts and officials have used the internet to call photographs, reporting and videos of dead bodies and bombed buildings in Ukraine fake.\n\nThe board will be headed by Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation expert who has researched online Russian misinformation campaigns. Sounds reasonable, right? I mean, no self-respecting American wants notorious war criminal Vladimir Putin sowing chaos among our citizens and tilting the playing field in favor of candidates he can more easily manipulate into supporting his diabolical plans, right?\n\nHa ha ha! You naif! These people do, of course. [Tweet from Josh Hawley available at the link.]\n\nHmm, that video, originally posted in February, was actually kind of great. But Jankowicz parodied Mary Poppins, and Mary Poppins is a “groomer” now, so …\n\nDonald Trump Jr., “Historically, was there ever a despotic regime that didn’t have the equivalent of a Ministry of Truth?”\n\nDespotic regime. That’s rich from Junior. Pot meet every other pot and kettle on the fucking planet. […]\n\nOf course, new Twitter Daddy Elon Musk felt compelled to get in on the act as well. [Tweet from Musk available at the link]\n\nAnd then there was this nitwit:\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, “Now that the Biden regime has a Ministry of Truth, what’s next? Re-education camps?\n\nWhat’s next? Space lasers, of course. […]\n\nAnd in case the irony isn’t rich enough for you yet, Vladimir Putin and Bashar al-Assad apologist Tulsi Gabbard got in on the act. [Gabbard tweet available at the link]\n\nAnd if that wasn’t quite enough irony to break your brain, well, this will pulverize it:\n\nTucker Carlson, “Nina Jankowicz is the most ridiculous of all in Biden’s Ministry of Truth.”\n\nOf course, countering Russian disinformation is something all Western liberal democracies should be doing. It’s something Trump should have done while he could have done it. Instead, Trump stood onstage with Putin in Helsinki and gave him the green light to misinform all he wanted. [This article is accompanied by a photo of Putin smirking in a self-satisfied way as he follows Trump onto the stage in Helsinki.]\n\nTrump was both the primary beneficiary and most eager domestic proponent of Russian disinformation. So if you’re in the Trump cult, you’ll naturally regard any attempt to stanch Russia’s dangerous, anti-democratic lies as an existential threat.\n\nIt’s obvious by now that they’ll just keep saying “Ministry of Truth” until it means something to their followers, even though it’s a safe bet very few of these philistines have actually read George Orwell’s1984 or even understand the reference. But the problem with the comparison is that the Ministry of Truth did nothing but tell lies. In other words, it was the 1940s version of Fox News’ “Fair and Balanced.”\n\nToday’s conservatives aren’t about spreading the facts. They just want to spread manipulative (and manipulated) versions—and they own and operate the vast majority of this country’s manure spreaders. They like the current political landscape—with its endless hillocks of bullshit—just the way it is. So now they’ll ramp up their lies in order to keep the Russian lie pipeline open in the face of efforts to shut it down.\n\nIt’s what traitors do, after all.\n\nGovernor Bill Lee has signed a bill that will allow people who believe, despite all available evidence, that Ivermectin can treat COVID-19, to get it without a prescription at a local pharmacy instead of at a feed store. This is very exciting news for people who are very wrong about things, and has been described by the Tennessee Conservative as “giving residents access to treat COVID-19 without a prescription,” which it is not, because Ivermectin does not do anything to treat COVID-19.\n\nThat same site very seriously reports that this means that “Adults can complete a sheet giving information regarding pre-existing conditions, describe their current symptoms to the pharmacist, and the pharmacist can then dispense the correct dosage for that patient,” which does not actually exist, because Ivermectin in correct or incorrect doses does not do anything to treat COVID-19.\n\nOn the bright side, should the dopes that take this end up in a bad way from taking it, they will not be able to sue the pharmacist that was forced to prescribe it to them.\n\nThe bill reads:\n\nAMENDMENT #1 rewrites the bill to authorize a pharmacist to provide ivermectin to a patient, who is 18 years of age or older,, pursuant to a valid collaborative pharmacy practice agreement containing a non-patient-specific prescriptive order and standardized procedures developed and executed by one or more authorized prescribers.\n\nThis amendment requires the board of pharmacy to adopt rules to establish standard procedures for the provision of ivermectin by pharmacists, including rules to provide the patient with a standardized fact sheet regarding ivermectin.\n\nThis amendment provides that a pharmacist or prescriber acting in good faith and with reasonable care involved in the provision of ivermectin under this amendment is immune from disciplinary or adverse administrative actions for acts or omissions during the provision of ivermectin. Also, a pharmacist or prescriber involved in the provision of ivermectin under this amendment will be immune from civil liability in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct for actions authorized by provisions of this amendment.\n\nYou know what? If people are that desperate to own the libs by taking medication that does not work and could give them seizures, then they should be free to do that. At this point, I feel the same way about this as I do with drugs that actually are illegal — it’s better to “legalize” and try to make things as safe and unlikely to end in death as possible, since people are going to use them anyway. That’s all you can do. Either they’re going to get it from a pharmacist or they’re going to get it from the farm, nothing we can do about it. We’ve shouted from the rooftops for at least a year now, and if they haven’t gotten the message by now, no one can help them.\n\nThe truly obnoxious thing is that they want it to be treated like a medication that will actually do something to treat covid, and they want the pharmacists to play along and pretend like it will, doling out “fact sheets” and the like. That’s what’s dangerous.\n\nA similar bill proposed in Ohio this week will force doctors to “promote and increase distribution” of Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and tell their patients that these drugs have been proven to be effective in treating COVID-19, despite the fact that they have not been.\n\n[…] if a doctor is required by law to promote something even if they, as a doctor, know it to be unsafe, that is not actually so much making a decision in consultation with their patient as it is with the government.\n\nAt this point, they may as well require doctors to prescribe homeopathic tinctures and that magic drinking bleach all of the conspiracy theorists love. Really, what’s the difference? Well, other than the fact that it is impossible to overdose on homeopathic tinctures, on account of the fact that they are literally just water. [Still a waste of money, and still an action that would encourage faulty thinking.]\n\nRepublicans have long lobbied for the state’s right to interfere in the patient-doctor relationship, frequently forcing doctors to lie to abortion patients about fake potential risks and non-existent “abortion pill reversals” and give them unwanted and unneeded transvaginal ultrasounds meant to emotionally manipulate them into having a baby they don’t want.\n\nThere is a reason why prescriptions exist, and why one must be secured, from a doctor with years of training, before taking certain medicines. Because people who don’t have that training are not qualified to make those decisions. It’s one thing to say “Hey, I was looking into this kind of birth control, what do you think?” and another to say “I would like to take oxycontin as a birth control pill!” and demand the doctor give you a prescription even though it’s not going to do anything for you. We have enough problems with doctors prescribing certain medications based on which pharmaceutical companies give the best perks, we don’t need this nonsense.\n\nThis does not seem like a thing that will end well.\n\n[…] very hour, every minute, Fox News and the propaganda machines it has birthed are either selling their audience lies, misinformation, and disinformation about the world, or selling them pillows, telling them to sell their gold, and saying that the way out of debt is to give Magnum P.I. your home in a reverse mortgage.\n\nThe Fox-News-o-sphere has been doing double time sticking its head both up its own behind and also deep into the sand. Impossible to do, you say? You can say a lot of things about Fox News but you can’t say they aren’t willing and able to continue to surprise you when it comes to how low they can go. At this point the fact that a hole hasn’t ripped open in the space-time continuum under the Fox News studios is arguably the most surprising thing.\n\nThere has been a lot of news lately about audio of GOP House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying all kinds of relatively sober things about how much of a disaster Donald Trump and the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol were. He even happened to mention how crappy people like Florida man Matt Gaetz are. The problem is: The GOP is nowhere near sober in their public-facing acceptance of the fascism being called for by the MAGA wing of the party. McCarthy has one thing going for him—being craven and a liar seems to work just fine with the MAGA crowd, regardless of how much evidence is laid before their feet.\n\nLet’s see what Fox News is doing to facilitate the dissemination of news and information to its audience.\n\n[Aaaron Rupar] Fox News/Business mentions Friday morning:\n\n– Audio of Kevin McCarthy blaming Trump for Jan 6 and talking about his resignation: 0\n\n– Hunter Biden: 6\n\nLater on, Fox News’ Howard Kurtz had Glenn Greenwald on to talk about Elon Musk and how great his ideas on free speech are. Surprisingly (see: not surprisingly) they didn’t discuss any of Elon’s stated mentions of what he thinks “free speech” is. They didn’t because this …\n\n[Elon Musk] The extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all.\n\nBy “free speech”, I simply mean that which matches the law.\n\nI am against censorship that goes far beyond the law.\n\nIf people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.\n\nTherefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.\n\n…doesn’t make much sense.\n\nAny-the-ways! Kurtz brought up and defended Fox News’ lack of coverage, instead opting to continuously discuss the media’s lack of luster over Hunter Biden’s alleged laptop leak in the days leading up to the November 2020 election. Kurtz’s argument, the one he laid out to his interviewee Greenwald, is that the McCarthy story isn’t a “big story.” Greenwald, who has been spending most of his time recently talking about Hunter Biden’s laptop, had to admit that it showed clearly that Kevin McCarthy is lying, but made sure to offer up the defense (while saying he wouldn’t know why one would want to defend McCarthy) that “it’s a very hard job to manage a Republican caucus with 250 very disparate voices with Donald Trump hovering over you. There was a lot of emotions surrounding 1/6, but we should demand from our political leaders the basic obligation not to tell lies to the public, and the fact that he got caught red-handed should be a pretty significant event for him.”\n\nBut, was it a big story? Greenwald, who has spent a considerable amount of the past year talking about Hunter Biden’s laptop, said that he thinks what happened was that “emotions were high” after the “Jan. 6, riot,” and it is definitely a “news story,” but guess what he says next? “If we did flood-the-zone coverage every time a politician lied we would never do anything else as journalists.” Greenwald ended by telling the Fox News host—on the network that continues to cover the Hunter Biden laptop and insist that President Joe Biden is maybe lying about something for the last year and a half—that “covering it is reasonable, but excessively covering it is what happened because obviously there’s a partisan agenda involved.”\n\nWild stuff. You see what Greenwald did there? He conflated a politician lying about wanting to ASK THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO RESIGN FROM OFFICE with “politicians lying.”\n\nThat first Fox News story count was from like April 22. I’m sure things picked up a few days later.\n\n[Aaron Rupar] Fox News/Business mentions so far today:\n\nHunter Biden: 32\n\nMark Meadows: 1\n\n[…] Ron Johnson claims Joe Biden wouldn’t be president had the media done more reporting on Hunter Biden’s laptop ahead of the 2020 election\n\n[…] In an unrelated story, Sen. Ron Johnson is a corrupt, racist, lying, POS.\n\nReuters has an excellent report on pro-Trump Republicans who have attacked U.S. election systems, stealing voting data or attempting to do so under the supposed justification of searching for “election fraud.” Reuters counts eight known recent attempts, the most infamous being the case of Colorado election clerk Tina Peters, who now faces multiple felony charges after allowing voting data to be breached and stolen. But Peters isn’t the only pro-Trump official accused of attempted or successful thefts of voting data or unauthorized access to sensitive, must-be-secured-at-all-times election machines.\n\nThere is a trend of Republican officials and allies looking to breach election systems so that they can comb through voter data looking for “fraud” that they claim to be omnipresent simply because they refuse to believe Americans did not vote overwhelmingly to reelect the incompetent loudmouth Donald Trump. Cases include Adams Township in Michigan, where a QAnon-promoting clerk was found in possession of sensitive election tabulation hardware four days after it went missing; another Michigan episode in which a Republican activist impersonated a government official in an attempt to steal equipment; a Colorado election clerk caught on video making “forensic” copies of “everything on the election server”—the two hard drives the information was copied to have not been recovered. Pillow kingpin Mike Lindell features heavily as a financier of election conspiracy theories that have now morphed into pro-Trump crimes and attempted crimes.\n\n[…] there are some key takeaways worth highlighting:\n\n1. It is all based on conspiracy theories. Not sophisticated conspiracy theories, but QAnon or similar-styled ranting at clouds, bizarre claims with no evidence other than being passed around on the internet from crackpot to crackpot. The “evidence” the pro-Trump officials are looking for is not something that they can even describe; the goals are to obtain voting records or the secured software being used on election equipment so that it can be looked through and distributed to others, upon which the presumption is that “something” corrupt will be found. Like what? You know, something. And what are these suspicions based on? What tidbits of information are out there to suggest that stealing this information will result in exposing a conspiracy?\n\nNot a damn thing. Literally nothing. The best the evidence ever gets is the sort of “looking for bamboo fibers in our ballots”-styled nonsense of the Arizona Republican audit; the tabulation machines are being targeted to look for secret “make Joe Biden win this thing” code, the 2020 election records are being targeted in the hopes that a grand conspiracy will be uncovered in which long-dead or nonexistent voters overwhelmed the vote counts through raw force of their nonexistence.\n\nThe people doing the crimes are conspiracy cranks who have either risen to positions of minor local party power or want to. They are … not scholarly people, to say the least. They are people who have been incited by the invented propaganda claims put on television by Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, House Republicans, Fox News, and Pillow Dude, […]\n\n2. Each case shows a brazen Republican disregard for the law. The Republican clerks and other local officials behind the data breaches and thefts are unapologetic; since they believe somebody else somewhere might be doing a crime, they assert they are justified in doing real crimes to expose the imagined ones.\n\nHistorically, this has tended to be a significant component of conservatism and is a blazingly obvious component of authoritarianism in all its forms. […]\n\nSo you’ve got things going on like a local Republican official threatening to get an elections official fired if that elections official doesn’t let the Republican have access to secured voting equipment that by law nobody is allowed to have access to because then it wouldn’t be secure. […]\n\nIt turns out that having a “president” willing to break laws regularly, alongside party-devoted lawmakers who are eager to simply scrub out enforcement of whatever rules he breaks, may result in more widespread party beliefs that Criminality Is Good Now. […]\n\n3. These criminal efforts are more coordinated than they might look. The tell here is the simple note that Mike Lindell, the aforementioned Pillow Dude, is pouring a lot of money into convincing people like these local Republican conspiracy theorists that Republican election conspiracy theories are so dire that extraordinary action needs to be taken to combat them. In Texas, a big Republican donor is now under indictment for financing a supposed “investigation” into election fraud that saw one of his investigators run a random Texan off the road and hold him at gunpoint on the bizarre belief that the man’s truck was stuffed with fake ballots.\n\nThe crimes are all committed due to a belief in a handful of nebulous, nonsensical conspiracy theories that came from top Trump propagandists and which continue to be repeated now as core movement beliefs. The reason those beliefs continue is because there’s a whole lot of Republican money being poured into making them continue.\n\nThere are also legislative efforts to make such tampering the new normal, Republican-controlled state legislatures have now passed a bevy of new laws that allow them to simply seize control of whatever local election offices have reported back with vote totals that Republican partisans find suspicious. Here’s a tip: Counties that tend not to vote for Republican candidates are the ones being singled out as “suspicious.” […]\n\nReuters is reporting on a wave of conspiracy-minded Republican cranks now looking to target the nation’s election systems by stealing sensitive data, but the broader context here is that the party is looking to legalize those sorts of breaches, not tamp down on them. The problem they’re trying to solve is that, in states like Georgia, Americans aren’t voting for Republicans in sufficient numbers for Republicans to win. The solution they’ve come up with is to declare that if a Republican candidate doesn’t win, it’s because there was a secret conspiracy to fudge the numbers—thus requiring Republican “investigation” into votes against them.\n\nWhen we talk about the history of feminism, we tend to think about the causes and struggles of middle class white women. When we talk about labor history, we tend to think about the causes and struggles of white working class men.\n\nAnd that is some absolute bullshit.\n\nWorking class women, very often women of color and immigrant women, were, are and always have been the backbone of the labor movement. They were working and organizing well before Second Wave Feminism “made it possible” for women to enter the workforce. They’re the ones who first fought for equal pay, and they’re the ones who were doing the bulk of feminist work and activism during the years in between getting the right to vote and The Feminine Mystique. They are still fighting today.\n\nSo, since it’s May Day, AKA International Worker’s Day, let’s celebrate the hell out of them, starting with the woman who started it all.\n\nLucy Parsons\n\n“Governments never lead; they follow progress.When the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a step, but not until then.” [photo at the link]\n\n“More dangerous than a thousand rioters,” anarchist Lucy Eldine Gonzalez Parsons was a writer, orator, one of the founders of the Industrial Workers of the World and tireless campaigner for the rights of people of color, all women and all workers. Her husband, Albert Parsons, was one of the Haymarket martyrs.\n\nWe, the women of this country, have no ballot even if we wished to use it…but we have our labor. We are exploited more ruthlessly than men. Wherever wages are to be reduced, the capitalist class uses women to reduce them, and if there is anything that you men should do in the future, it is to organize the women.\n\nThough Parsons and Emma Goldman were widely regarded as the most prominent female anarchists of the day, they, very notably, did not get along so well. Parsons believed that oppression based on gender and race was a function of capitalism and would be eliminated when capitalism was eliminated, whereas Goldman believed such oppression was inherent in all things. Parsons was all class struggle all the time, and felt that the “intellectual anarchists” like Goldman spent too much time bothering with appealing to the middle class.\n\nOne of her most important contributions to the labor movement was the concept of factory takeovers.\n\n“My conception of the strike of the future is not to strike and go out and starve, but to strike and remain in, and take possession of the necessary property of production.”\n\nParsons is best known for being the woman who really started the celebration of May Day as a day for workers’ rights — leading a parade to commemorate the anniversary of the Haymarket Affair. Soon, nearly every other country in the world followed suit and proclaimed this day International Worker’s Day. Alas, here in America, we go with the less radical and more picnic-y Labor Day […]\n\nAnna LoPizzo\n\nNot much is known about Anna LoPizzo, other than that she was a 34-year-old mill worker who was murdered by police officer Oscar Benoit during the 1912 Lawrence Textile Strike — also known as the Bread and Roses Strike. Initially, police tried to charge two IWW organizers who were miles away for her murder, even though literally everyone there had seen Benoit shoot her.\n\nThe reason for the strike in the first place was that the textile mills of Lawrence, Massachusetts, cut worker pay after the state cut the number of hours women could legally work from 56 down to 54. The Industrial Workers of the World, led by Elizabeth Gurley Flynn (we’ll get to her in a minute), organized more than 20,000 workers of more than 40 different nationalities to demand they get their fair wages. One of the primary tactics used in the strike was sending the starving families of the mill workers on a tour to New York City so that people there could see for themselves what these low wages were doing to children. Between that and LoPizzo’s death, sympathy was on the side of the workers. Congressional hearings into the conditions of the mills were held, and the mills themselves ended up settling the strike by giving all workers across New England a 20% raise.\n\nLillian Wald [photo at the link]\n\nSusan B. Anthony isn’t the only important feminist buried in the Mount Hope Cemetery in my hometown of Rochester, New York. There is another. Her name was Lillian Wald, and she was a total fucking bad ass. She wasn’t just a suffragist — she was also an early advocate for healthcare for all people regardless of economic class or citizenship, a founding member of the NAACP, lobbied against child labor, advocated for the rights of immigrants, helped to found the Women’s Trade Union League and was an anti-war activist. Wald also founded the Henry Street Settlement House in New York City, which provides — to this day — social services, education and health care to the impoverished. And she was active in the ACLU.\n\nWHY THE HELL IS SHE NOT MORE FAMOUS? I am legitimately bothered by this and bring it up often.\n\nElizabeth Gurley Flynn [photo at the link]\n\n“The IWW has been accused of pushing women to the front. This is not true. Rather, the women have not been kept in back, and so they have naturally moved to the front.”\n\n[…] As previously mentioned, she was an organizer with Industrial Workers of the World who helped organize the Lawrence Textile Strike. She also organized a hell of a lot of other strikes across the country, helped found the ACLU, and was known for the creative tactics she used to elicit sympathy and support for the American worker.\n\nHattie Canty [photo at the link]\n\nWhen Hattie Canty’s husband died in 1972, she found herself supporting eight children on her own. She found work as a maid at a Las Vegas hotel where she joined the Las Vegas Hotel and Culinary Workers Union Local 226. By 1990, she was president of that union, leading one of the longest strikes in American history — a six year strike of hospitality workers which, happily, ended in victory.\n\nThe Women of The Atlanta Washerwomen’s Strike [photo at the link]\n\nBack in the 1880s, only two decades after the Civil War ended, the most common occupation for black women was as laundresses — this was largely because if poor white families were going to hire anyone to do chores for them at all, they were going to hire someone to do their laundry. These women were independent workers, often working from their own homes and making their own soap, and they only made about $4 a month. (Average non-black-woman laborers earned about $35 a month in 1880.)\n\nOne day in 1881, about 20 of them got together and decided that $4 a month was some bullshit for all the work they were doing and decided to go on strike and demand wages of $1 for every 12 pounds of washing. Three weeks later, 3,000 other women joined them. Unsurprisingly, the city freaked out. They fined any participants $25 — which was a lot of money when you only made $4 a month — and they offered tax breaks to any corporation that would come down there to start a commercial steam cleaning business. Still, the women did not back down.\n\nEventually, people got really sick of doing their own laundry, and the city decided to back down on the fines, and cede to their demands for fear that the unrest would spread to other industries.\n\nDolores Huerta [Photo at the link]\n\nDolores Huerta, along with Cesar Chavez, helped to organize the National Farmworkers Association, which later became United Farm Workers. She wasn’t a farmworker herself — rather, she was an elementary school teacher who was tired of seeing the children she taught living in poverty because their parents were not making enough money as farmworkers.\n\nI couldn’t tolerate seeing kids come to class hungry and needing shoes. I thought I could do more by organizing farm workers than by trying to teach their hungry children.\n\n[…]\n\nAngela and Maria Bambace\n\nThough she’s not as well known as some of the other women on here, Angela Bambace, an organizer the International Ladies Garment Worker’s Union who started unionizing her fellow shirtwaist factory workers at age 18, is a personal hero of mine, along with her sister Maria. Angela was known to punch strikebreakers in the nose […]\n\nShe also left her husband and a traditional marriage in which she was confined to “making tomato sauce and homemade gnocchi” –and lost her parental rights in doing so, because back then, women didn’t have any — to fight for workers’ rights on the front lines. She was the first Italian-American woman elected Vice-President of the ILGWU, where she worked from 1936 until 1972.\n\nMay Chen [photo at the link]\n\nMay Chen, also of the International Ladies Garment Worker’s Union, led the New York Chinatown strike of 1982 — 20,000 workers strong and one of the largest strikes in American history. As a result of the strike, employers cut back on wage cuts, gave workers time off for holidays and hired bilingual interpreters in order to accommodate the needs of immigrant workers.\n\nLucy Randolph Mason [photo at the link]\n\nLucy Randolph Mason was a weird one. She was a well-off Southern lady from Virginia, related to George Mason (author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights), Supreme Court Justice John Marshall, and, uh, Robert E. Lee. So, you know, you might have an idea in your head about what her deal might be. And you would be so wrong. In a good way.\n\nSo, despite being from this very fancy family, Lucy goes and gets a job as a secretary for the YWCA at 20. 1918, she gets into the whole suffragette thing. Women get the vote, but Lucy’s not done. She starts organizing for labor rights and integration and ending white supremacy in the South. She organizes interfaith, integrated unions in the South, which you can imagine was a pretty big deal at that time. She does it through the YWCA. She writes a pamphlet telling consumers to boycott companies that don’t treat their workers well. Eventually, she becomes the CIO’s ambassador to the South and spends the next 16 years of her life going to all these small towns where bad things would happen to anyone who tried to unionize, and explaining worker’s rights and why integration is good and racism is bad to pretty much anyone with any kind of power.[…]\n\nEmma Goldman [photo at the link]\n\nThough not a union organizer by trade, anarcha-feminist Emma Goldman’s advocacy for worker’s rights and human dignity and freedom empowered workers and organizers throughout the country, and motivated them to stand up for their own rights. She was considered the most dangerous woman in America for a reason.\n\nShe was a feminist, an anti-racist, an atheist, an advocate of free love, an opposer of the institution of marriage and — very unusually for the time (she pretty much started right after Haymarket, which was 1886, and continued until her death in 1940) was living in — one of the first advocates of gay rights.\n\n“It is a tragedy, I feel, that people of a different sexual type are caught in a world which shows so little understanding for homosexuals and is so crassly indifferent to the various gradations and variations of gender and their great significance in life.”\n\n[…]\n\nRosina Tucker [photo at the link]\n\n“I looked him right in the eye and banged on his desk and told him I was not employed by the Pullman company and that my husband had nothing to do with any activity I was engaged in … I said, ‘I want you to take care of this situation or I will be back.’ He must have been afraid … because a black woman didn’t speak to a white man in this manner. My husband was put back on his run.”\n\nRosina Tucker is best known for helping to organize the first black labor union, The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, started by A. Philip Randolph in 1925. A Brotherhood? But she was a woman, you say! Well, the Pullman porters wanted to organize, but they were afraid of losing their jobs. With good reason, because their bosses kept trying to fire them for trying to unionize. So Rosina and other wives of the porters got together and started the Ladies Auxiliary of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters in order to raise funds to start the union.\n\nIn 1963, along with A. Philip Randolph of the BSCP, she helped organize the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and continued to be active in civil rights and labor rights until she passed away in 1987, at the age of 105.\n\nThe women on this list, along with the many others who also fought for labor rights in this country and others, didn’t only fight a fight for workers. They fought a feminist fight, they fought for civil rights, they fought for human rights — they understood the interconnectedness of it all, they understood that without economic justice there is no social justice and without social justice there is no economic justice. They understood the way that the labor movement could be used as a catalyst for making social change possible at a time when they didn’t have any political support or power — and that’s a thing we could all do well to remember ourselves.\n\nWho is fighting for Russia? Part 1. Russians\n\nMuch of misunderstanding regarding the composition of forces fighting for Russia in Ukraine results from perceiving Russia as a monolith\n\nWe can classify Russian forces into three main categories:\n\n1. Russians\n\n2. Chechens\n\n3. Donbass\n\nRussian army is an authority-based bureaucratic organisation run through formal procedures. Cadres are interchangeable and don’t matter much, while procedures and formal rank mean everything. Interchangeability of cadres makes army easier to control and minimises political risks\n\nChechen forces are run by the informal power of Kadyrov through his personal network. On paper it’s merely a collection of Russian regulars from the various branches of army, National Guard, FSB etc. But in a power-based structure these badges mean nothing as it is run informally\n\nDonbass armies were originally power-based and run by pro-Russian warlords through their personal networks. However, later Russians assassinated those warlords one by one, establishing formal authority-based rule that serves as a model which may be later scaled up all over Russia\n\nHow is the Russian regular army composed? The key element is draft. Theoretically every young man between 18-27 y.o. has to serve in the army for a year. In practice however, everyone who can, dodges. So the quotas are filled by the most disadvantaged who didn’t or couldn’t dodge\n\nSome argue that the Russian army is not that different in this regard from the US army, which also heavily recruits from the poor classes. I disagree. In the US recruitment is voluntary. In Russia it’s compulsory and dodgeable which makes it effectively the blood tax on the poor\n\nConsider the following. In the US people go to the army to pay for the college. In Russia it’s the other way around: people go to the college to avoid the army. You can fund it either by winning a government-funded place (бюджет) or simply by paying tuition fees out of the pocket\n\nDraft absolutely distorts the education market. You won’t be drafted while you study. So you have to get into uni to avoid the draft. That makes much of university industry in Russia the draft dodging industry….\n\n…\n\nIt’s well-reflected in the art like a movie “Elena”. Elena is married to an old rich man. Her 17 y.o. grandson will be drafted, unless he gets into the college. She asks her husband to pay for the tuition, he refuses. So she kills him. It’s a very understandable plot for Russians\n\nDraft plays the key role in the Russian army recruitment….\n\nTheoretically decision to sign the contract is totally free. You don’t even have to serve a compulsory (unpaid) year to sign it. In practice recruiters are giving draftees a choice. You must either serve a year as a conscript for free or sign a contract for longer and get paid\n\nFurthermore, those already serving their compulsory year as conscripts can make a decision to transfer to the ranks of contractors. It’s supposed to be free. In practice though, draftees are pretty much defenceless and can be tricked, threatened or simply commanded to sign it\n\nStatus of contractors differs from the status of conscripts. Contractors are professional soldiers and sending them to foreign operations is legal (sending conscripts is not). And yet, almost all contractors were initially selected through the social filter of draft\n\nAlmost all Siloviki structures require or strongly prefer candidates who have served as conscripts. Thus social filter of draft plays a huge role in comprising the National Guard, police and other agencies. Draft makes sure they’re recruited from the poor and uneducated\n\nIn theory it sounds kinda fair. Serve your compulsory year as a conscript and get an entrance ticket to Siloviki careers. And yet, that creates a problem. Army is for peasants, while some Siloviki careers especially in state security lure golden kids who won’t serve with peasants\n\nWe have a contradiction. Elite jobs in FSB, FSO, etc must be filled by golden kids who won’t serve in army. And yet, this jobs require to have served in the army. That’s why studying in FSB and FSO academies is counted as the military service….\n\nThis loophole with counting studying in the elite state security academies as the compulsory military service reflects the class structure of Russia. While theoretically state ideology glorifies military service, in practice everyone knows it’s for peasants. Army isn’t classy\n\nAnother branch of the Russian military heavily involved in Ukraine is Wagner mercenary company. While supposed to be “private”, Wagner was created by Putin’s henchman Prigozhin to fight for Russian interests in Syria, Africa and now in Ukraine\n\n[gruesome images of Wagner mercenary crimes at the link]\n\nAnyway, most of the army regulars, National guard and Wagner fighting in Ukraine first had to go through the social filter of draft and then choose (or accept) military, cop or mercenary career which are unpopular among those with *any* form of capital be it economic or cultural\n\nThat doesn’t mean that everyone who signed a contract is a victim. Most signed it voluntarily, for financial reasons. Notice that volunteers in Russian army are called contractors. Which implies they enlisted for money rather than because of the patriotism. They’re mercenaries\n\nStill, even those who signed the contract voluntarily usually had to go through the social filter of draft and then view military service as lucrative. Which means they had no better options, coming from the bottom of socioeconomic ladder and having accumulated no form of capital\n\nThat explains heavy geographic and ethnic asymmetry in casualties. Mediazona aggregated data on 1744 casualties among the Russian regulars in Ukraine and found a clear negative correlation between a median salary in the region and the number of casualties. It’s the poor who fight\n\nConsider this map with casualties by each Russian region. Two most heavily affected ones are Dagestan and Buryatia: both being poor ethnic backcountry. Moscow and St Petersburg have almost no casualties despite being officially 12% of Russian population (much more in reality)\n\nMajority of the Russian soldiers KIA are young. Some of them must be contractors who signed a contract during their compulsory service or straight after it. Some are conscripts who were sent to Ukraine illegally. You can find this study here [link at the link; it was posted in the previous chapter of the thread]\n\nThis is a map with casualties in Ukraine on 100 000 of male population by region, based on Mediazona figures. We see that the most affected regions lie in two ethnic clusters: South Siberia and North Caucasus. There are only two truly Russian regions here: Pskov & Kostroma. Why?\n\nApart from being poor and ethnic Russian, Pskov and Kostroma have one common denominator. They are both home to huge VDV bases. And it was the VDV airborne who had disproportionate losses in Ukraine. They attacked airports expecting no resistance like in 1968 and were massacred\n\nSouth Siberia and especially Buryatia is the region who lost the most people per capita in Ukraine. As you see, already published casualties in Ukraine (red) increased mortality among Buryatian males quite substantially. The burden of war on this Mongol Buddhist republic is huge\n\nYou see a lama blessing a Buryat soldier in Ukraine. According to activists from the Free Buryatia, Buryats comprise 2,8% of total Russian casualties despite being just 0,3% of population. The war in Ukraine is turning out to be a national catastrophe for this Siberian minority\n\nSee Buryats commenting on their disproportionate casualties. A woman speculates that “elite troops” from Moscow and St Petersburg are kept in reserve while “provincials” (notice chuckling) are sent forward. That basically means that “provincials” serve as the cannon fodder\n\n[video with subtitles at the link]\n\nIndeed, that could explain a strange asymmetry with huge cities as St Petersburg and especially Moscow having so few casualties. It’s not only that they are underrepresented in the army. It’s probably also that higher-ups don’t send them to Ukraine fearing unrests in two capitals\n\nMoscow and St Petersburg are crucial centres of power, thus discontent in these cities must be avoided at any cost. Meanwhile, poor rural population from remote regions is disposable. Discontent among remote bumpkins doesn’t present political problem in such a centralised country\n\nThere may be another consideration here. Russia is a quickly depopulating country, but it is depopulating unevenly. Fertility among minorities, especially in North Caucasus and Siberia is much higher than among ethnic Russians which may change the demographic balance in Russia\n\n…What if Kremlin mobilises minorities for Z-war to solve two problems at once: destroying Ukraine and maintaining the current demographic balance in Russia?\n\nIt’s difficult to say how much discontent there is in Buryatia. But anecdotally some Buryats in social media support vandalising Z-monuments. Expressing this discontent in Russia is risky though: you can be jailed for 15 years for distributing fake news about Z-war\n\nMinorities’ participation in Z-war is ironic regarding that it’s a Russian ethnonationalist war. Z-ideology is an expression of Russian ethnonationalism which is deeply hostile to minorities. Russian victory manifesting Russian ethnonationalist triumph is against their interests\n\nWhile most of Z-forces are unmotivated mercenaries and conscripts, their activist core is far-right. Consider this interview with a de-Nazifier broadcasted (=lowkey endorsed) by the Russia Today:\n\n“All children are equal to us if they’re born white-skinned and on the Slavic land”\n\nWhile far-right involvement in Ukrainian army is hugely exagerrated, participation of Nazis in Russian forces is almost ignored. Consider this post where Z-fighters celebrate birthday of their “long-gone comrade” who “taught them how to fight for their historic land” on April 20\n\nThe core of Russian irredentists who went to fight in Ukraine back in 2014 was recruited from the far right like the Sputnik and Pogrom fanbase who would assert their racial superiority over Ukrainians by comparing them with “lower races” such as Blacks, Arabs or Native Americans\n\nConsider this poster which makes a parallel between the British Defence of Rorke’s Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War and the Russian defence of Slavyansk during the Donbass war. Russians are portrayed as the British and Ukrainians as Zulu. Notice Ukrainian flag on a warrior’s cheek\n\nThis poster compares the Crimean city of Sevastopol with Texas and “Ukrainian tribes” with Native Americans who “should be shot at sight”. From perspective of the Russian far-right, they are the truly White European people, while the whiteness of Ukrainians is very questionable\n\nRussian far-rights who heavily participated in manufacturing the conflict in Ukraine tend to believe in their racial superiority over Ukrainians who have too many steppe admixtures, making them less Slavic and less white\n\nRussia is a White supremacist country. It’s not that some random extremists like Dmitry Rogozin share racist ideas. It’s that White vs Asian dichotomy with a perceived superiority of the former over the latter, is the axiom of the Russian public discourse\n\nFirst, white supremacy serves as a justification of Russian ethnic supremacy over minorities or neighbouring nations such as Ukrainians who are supposedly not white enough. Second, it legitimises the rule of Russian metropoly over the racially and culturally inferior periphery\n\nRussian iconography traditionally demonises anything “Asiatic” including Asian facial features….\n\nRussian nationalists criticise modern Russia for not being White enough and allowing lower races up. Consider how they portrayed mayor of Moscow Sobyanin: Chuckcha, Japanese, Mongol. The lack of consistency is telling. His facial features make him an Asiatic savage: that’s enough\n\nHow could Sobyanin raise to power then? Well, by totally assimilating. He bears a Russian name and a patronymic which is very important. He doesn’t speak (publicly) on a minority language. He’s diligently showing up on church services. He embraced the Russian cultural memes\n\nRussia being White supremacist doesn’t mean it’s really obsessed with the purity of blood. Rejecting your cultural memes and embracing Russian ones is usually enough, especially if you are white-passing. In fact much of Russian cultural policy is about extirpating the wrong memes\n\nConsider the Putin’s crackdown on minorities’ cultural infrastructure. In July 2017 Putin declared: “It is unacceptable to force a man to learn a language that is not his own”. That was a signal for a crackdown on compulsory courses of minority languages in ethnic republics\n\nIn September 2017, Russia’s government started to enforce Putin’s instructions and push regional governments into abolishing language courses. Most didn’t put much of a fight. Only Tatarstan government pretended they didn’t understand what Putin meant and didn’t abolish anything\n\nKremlin resorted to force. In October prosecutors started investigating local schools to determine whether they had retained compulsory courses on Tatar and to pressure school directors to abolish them. Eventually, all directors abided except for Pavel Shmakov – an ethnic Russian\n\nIn the end Tatarstan surrendered. On November 29, 2017 a prosecutor Nafikov (= a man of Moscow) paid a visit to the regional parliament and a speaker suggested “to listen to the prosecutor’s information and accept the bill without opening discussion and without asking questions”\n\nThe prosecutor Nafikov presented a new education bill which would make Tatarstan curricula align with the new instructions from the Moscow Ministry for Education, abolishing the compulsory courses of a local language. The bill, of course, passed unanimously.\n\nMPs openly admitted they passed the bill under pressure. When a journalist asked the head of the parliament’s committee for education, Rasil Valeev, whether he was content with the bill he just voted for, Valeev replied “Of course not!” adding that he “intends this issue again”\n\n[link to his full War on the Rocks article on the subject, “Fear and Loathing in Russia’s Catalonia,” at the link]\n\nThe entire story of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict becomes more understandable if we consider that from the perspective of Moscow Ukrainians are just a rebellious minority who won’t come into their senses and abandon their inferior Nazi cultural memes do non-Nazi Russian ones\n\nDespite Z-war being waged in Russian ethnonational interests, the ethnic periphery is heavily overrepresented on Ukrainian battlefields. They have less resources to dodge a draft, they are easier bribed by the army wages and they’re probably more disposable in the eyes of Kremlin\n\nBeing overrepresented on the battlefields, minorities fight against their own interests. If Russia wins, they’ll lose the last remnants of their autonomy (I’ll discuss Klishas-Krasheninnikov law later) and earn only the right for the full assimilation\n\nFrom the Russian imperial perspective, every ethic republic is just another Ukraine. Russian public opinion considers Ukraine as a rebellious province, but that works both ways. Every province which demands some sort of autonomy becomes a Ukraine and gonna share the same fate\n\nThe potential regime change and a “liberal” takeover won’t change anything. In fact, it might make the situation worse. Despite being actively whitewashed by the Western media Russian liberals fundamentally share the same ideology as Putin and are just as racist and imperialist\n\nSince the rule of metropoly over colonies is largely based on its supposed moral & cultural superiority, Russian liberals will shift responsibility for Putinism and Z-war on minorities. Consider London-based journalist Kashin: supporting Putin is “sucking an Armeno-Chechen dick”\n\nKashin is not some sort of extremist. He is a part of the Russian liberal establishment and published his articles in Kommersant, Republic, Sputnik and Pogrom [?], New York Times and so on. As I told, Western media will go to the great length to whitewash Russian “liberal opposition”\n\nHeavy participation of periphery in the Z-war will allow Russian liberals to shift all the blame on minorities:\n\n“Only three [of participators in Bucha massacre] are from Moscow, so they aren’t Muscovites, but just common nonhumans (нелюди) from the toiletless-villages”\n\nRussian ethnic periphery is trapped between the Putin and the “liberal opposition”, both of whom view periphery as nonhumans to be punished, disciplined and exploited. It has no interest in either side winning. It has an interest in dismantlement of the Russian imperial system\n\nDismantlement of the Russian empire will secure a peace by undermining any further attempts of the imperial restoration. Unable to recruit the cannon fodder in periphery (as it is doing it now), Russia won’t have manpower to act as the “menace of the world” as it is used to\n\nAs a general rule, the ethic periphery is hugely overrepresented on the Ukrainian battlefields and on the casualty lists. And yet, we have a strange anomaly – Chechnya. While a neighbouring Dagestan has 125 confirmed casualties, the neighbouring Chechnya has only 3. How come?\n\nTo answer this question, we’ll need to discuss the place of Chechnya within the Russian empire and the specific role of an MP Adam Delimkhanov who’s been heavily present on the videos from Ukraine. I’m planning to cover it in the Part 2 of this cycle.\n\nKandiss Taylor, who hopes to be the Republican nominee for Georgia governor and has been running on a campaign platform of “Jesus, Guns and Babies,” teased us all over the weekend, building up anticipation for a plan she calls “Executive Order 10.” This plan, she promised, would “rock the nation” and take down the Satanic Elite/Luciferian Cabal. [Tweet and image available at the link.]\n\nToday, she made good on that promise, releasing a video announcing her plan to tear down the Georgia Guidestones, a large Stonehenge-esque monument in Georgia with the following tenets inscribed on it in eight different languages.\n\n– Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.\n\n– Guide reproduction wisely — improving fitness and diversity.\n\n– Unite humanity with a living new language.\n\n– Rule passion — faith — tradition — and all things with tempered reason.\n\n– Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.\n\n– Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.\n\n– Avoid petty laws and useless officials.\n\n– Balance personal rights with social duties.\n\n– Prize truth — beauty — love — seeking harmony with the infinite.\n\n– Be not a cancer on the Earth — Leave room for nature — Leave room for nature.\n\nThe monument was erected in 1980 by some anonymous eccentric dude who probably thought the world was going to end because of the Cold War, but conspiracy theorists like Taylor believe it is an evil Satanic monument that is used for human sacrifice and which reveals the secret evil depopulation plans of the New World Order. “I am the ONLY candidate bold enough to stand up to the Luciferian Cabal,” Taylor tweeted in her announcement. “Elect me Governor of Georgia, and I will bring the Satanic Regime to its knees— and DEMOLISH the Georgia Guidestones.” [Tweet and video available at the link]\n\nShe says:\n\nThey told us what they wanted to do. Some might even say they had to get our permission. To at least tell us ahead of time, even if we didn’t believe them.\n\nOver 4 billion people had been injected with something that took just 9 months to create.\n\nAsk yourself “why?”\n\nBack in Biblical times, human sacrifice was a form of demonic worship. We’re still doing it, in present day, by killing our unborn. It’s the same demons, it’s the same sacrifices, the same sin. It’s just a different time.\n\nIf we don’t call things out and we don’t acknowledge them and we don’t take authority and take dominion over what God’s given us, then we are no better than the evil ones that put [the Guidestones] up.\n\nWe’ve watched as people have destroyed our history and monuments. In their place, they have erected statues to their own gods. The New World Order is here, and they told us it was coming. It’s a battle far greater than what we see in the [unintelligible].\n\nIt is a war between good and evil.\n\nIf it seems like Kandiss thinks the US is supposed to be a theocracy, that’s because she does. She also seems to be generally very unclear about what non-Christians, or even Christians who don’t practice Christianity the way she practices Christianity, are into.\n\nPart of the way the conspiracy-mongering works is that it always has to involve the evil Luciferian Cabal or whomever having to drop hints of some kind, in order for their Satanic magic to work. One of the favorite sayings of the QAnon set is “Symbolism will be their downfall” — implying that these evil elites really, really love symbolism, and that there is a secret meaning behind everything they do and say, ie: “It’s not that someone woke up in the morning and decided to put on a pair of red shoes because they went with their outfit, it’s that they need to tell the world they like to eat babies.”\n\nThis way, it’s a whole lot easier to just make shit up and claim it is true.\n\nTaylor’s insinuation here is that the Luciferian cabal had to tell people about their secret evil plans to depopulate the earth and make everyone learn Esperanto, for reasons, and that’s why the monument was put up. Thus, taking it down makes it so the Cabal can’t do that anymore, or at least throws a wrench into their nefarious plans for world domination — which is, of course, very different from Taylor’s plan to “take dominion over what God’s given us.” At least in the respect that only one person in this equation has announced their desire to do that.\n\nRight now, Taylor is polling at about five percent, though she explained in last night’s Republican primary debate that “The people in Georgia don’t think I’m polling that low.” So she could be polling as high as 95 percent, if we’re just making shit up now. Still, odds are she is not going to win and do her Executive Order 10 (or her Executive Orders 1-9, though no one knows what they are), which either means that the Satanists will maintain control of Georgia or that absolutely nothing will happen.\n\nTaking their cue from the incoming tide of far-right fearmongering about “grooming” and an “LGBTQ agenda” in schools and libraries, a group of Idaho biker militiamen are planning to show up to confront people celebrating a Pride event in a downtown Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, park next month.\n\nTwo men from the leadership of Panhandle Patriots, a militia-oriented bikers club based in northern Idaho—Justin Allen, the group’s vice president, and Jeff White, its “sergeant at arms”—told a recent gathering at a church hosted by Republican state House member Heather Scott that they planned to have a gun-driven event next month in Coeur d’Alene the same day as the city’s Pride Celebration at a park less than a mile away, and that they planned a confrontation: “We actually intend to go head to head with these people. A line has to be drawn in the sand. Good people need to stand up,” White told the audience. [video available at the link]\n\nThe meeting, titled “Gameplan to Remove Inappropriate Materials in Our Schools and Libraries,” was held at Regeneration Calvary Chapel in Kootenai, a small town north of Sandpoint. Scott—who has a long history of associations and identification with the far-right Patriot movement […]\n\nIronically, the event being planned that day by Panhandle Patriots, dubbed “Gun d’Alene,” is being billed as an anniversary of the day in 2020 that armed “Patriots” flooded the streets of Coeur d’Alene in response to hoax rumors of the impending arrival of buses full of evil black-clad “antifa” vandals who mysteriously never showed up anywhere they were rumored to be going.\n\n[…] Of course it didn’t happen, because it was never going to happen in the first place. The event next month is essentially celebrating the Patriots’ lethal gullibility. But that’s not how White described it, of course:\n\nOur event is advertised as “Gun d’Alene,” because it’s an anniversary of when we stood to protect our community. We’re standing again to protect our community. We shifted our date to be able to go head-to-head with these people. They are trying to take your children.\n\nConsidering that the flagrant brandishing of weapons is part of the event’s entire raison d’être, his words also took on ominous overtones as he urged the audience members to come support them […]\n\nAnother flier posted by the Panhandle Patriots advertising their planned confrontation with the Pride event shows a drag queen reading at a public library, and urges people to join them “in standing up against the indoctrination and grooming of our children.” Among its slogans: “If you don’t protect children, you are part of the problem.”\n\n[…] The Panhandle Patriots have been harassing members of the LGBT community in northern Idaho for awhile now. Last November, in conjunction with a local evangelical Christian church, they organized a protest in Post Falls outside the city library on the night it was hosting a program called the “Rainbow Squad,” an LGBTQ-friendly reading-discussion program.\n\nAmong the signs they carried, police body-camera footage shows, were slogans like “Flee From Sexual Immorality,” […] and “The Solution is Jesus Christ.”\n\nOn Facebook, Panhandle Patriots shared a post with its members calling out the library network’s upcoming meeting and urging others to attend:\n\nThe perversion that is becoming so pervasive in these libraries needs to be called out and CAST OUT.\n\nWe need people to show up and speak out, demand the removal of pro-LGBT books like the following:\n\n[Links to such books as Auntie Uncle: Drag Queen Hero and Be Amazing: A History of Pride.]\n\nA Post Falls native named Michelle White told the Coeur d’Alene Press that she and her two children had been participating for several months in Rainbow Squad events, saying she had always thought of the library as a “safe space” without judgment.\n\n“These people are making it not a safe place for kids to gather by picketing and yelling at them as they go inside,” she told the Press. “Creating an environment that is not safe is not OK.”\n\nJessica Mahuron, the North Idaho Pride Alliance outreach coordinator, attended the November Rainbow Squad event and observed how the protesters’ intentions were to eliminate that safe space—and they succeeded.\n\n“There were some people who felt intimidated from entering the building, others left because they were feeling so terrible, and for some, this is nothing new to them, so they stood strong,” Mahuron said. “The program is supposed to provide a safe, inclusive space for fun and friendship. What they experienced coming into that meeting was the exact opposite.”\n\n[…] Panhandle Patriots is closely associated with the so-called “American Redoubt” movement that is trying to organize a secessionist 51st state in the interior Northwest as a homeland for “Patriots.” And they’ve been increasingly busy the past few years: teaming up with anti-immigration vigilantes at the border (which involved confiscating drinking water left for migrants), leading anti-vaccination rallies, and swarming libraries to demand the removal books they say promote “an LGBTQ agenda.”\n\nTheir leader—a man named Mike Birdsong, who uses the nickname “Viper”—was present at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., during the Jan. 6 insurrection, and was photographed engaging the police in battle at barricades outside the building, though he has not been charged with any crimes from that day. Birdsong also has been photographed alongside well-known Proud Boys who have been charged with conspiracy at the insurrection.\n\n…We noticed that people’s true feelings weren’t expressed in parroted narratives, but in their offhand remarks, misstatements, threats, evasions, contradictions, intonations, glances, and gestures.\n\n…\n\nUkrainians are constantly asking, “Do Russians really not know what is going on?” The answer is no, most of them don’t. But they understand anyway. Fifteen minutes into every conversation, supporters would casually mention that yes, we were probably bombing the cities, people were dying, and everyone in Ukraine hates us. On some level, they understood everything — only they didn’t know it. And they refused to know, even when being confronted with direct evidence from their loved ones.\n\n…\n\nRussia has been afflicted with a mythical image of itself as the vanquisher of forces of evil and chaos for a very long time now; it triumphed over the 1990s, terrorism, the West. This mythic image gives us a reason to live. Putin’s decision to finally defeat this “evil” once and for all makes it especially hard for people to start questioning it now. Because if they do, it will destroy their entire worldview.\n\n…\n\n“Everybody humiliates us, when it comes down to it,” a boots and pants seller told me with a smile on his face at a market in the Kaluga region. “Everybody who isn’t Russian is always poking fun at us: when we were kids, always. The past several wars have just been Russians killing other Russians. All those Englishmen and Americans have been laughing their heads off at us, thumbing their noses. I’d launch a missile at England. And at America. So that they’d stop messing with us. No, I am not for the war. But I am sick and tired of them walking all over us!”\n\nThe theme of inexplicable humiliation was a very common thread among the supporters of the war, especially older folks.\n\n…\n\n“What are you feeling right now?”\n\n“There’s nothing to feel here! You have to wrap things up with a victory for our side. There’s no other option. And there shouldn’t be.”\n\nIt was clear that his desire for a victory was a direct response to the many years of indignity and humiliation he’d felt.\n\n“No one cares about what Russia thinks,” the beekeeper continued. “There’s nothing but blame all around. We’re the biggest villains in history now.”\n\nI’d already heard this lament many times, that nobody likes us. It’s some mixture of an inferiority complex and a victim complex. I could see that he, like many others, wanted to picture some external accuser and argue with him. Why? Maybe to feel self-righteous. Or just to exist for somebody else.\n\n“I’m happy my president finally went through with it! Enough, you guys! If you don’t want to respect us, you’ll have to fear us!”\n\n“Are we bombing Kharkiv so that the people in the West will be afraid of us?” I ask him to clarify.\n\nI saw a frightened comprehension in the beekeeper’s eyes. He wasn’t a chump or a bad guy.\n\n“We shouldn’t discuss what the president does while my country is fighting! If the Russian people don’t agree with my president, my country will lose, and I can’t allow that to happen.”\n\nI can more or less guess at what he was hoping for. This is our big chance to prove how badass we are and no one will judge the victors.\n\nFor many years, people have run from this feeling of humiliation toward a reality where we have accomplished something magnificent. The sanctity of our Great Victory, the fact that we saved the world from fascism, make it feel like our government, and, by extension, all of us, are all right. The war unites people, it gives them a sense of being part of something. It’s a response to the crisis of purpose, of loneliness.\n\n…\n\nThe easiest method for protecting yourself from anxiety is narrowing down the number of things you’re responsible for. You just tell yourself that nothing you do can change anything and then you don’t have to think about anything because you’ve accepted it all as a given. It’s like the way we all know that car exhaust pollutes the environment and yet we keep driving. People have already accepted the war as a given.\n\n…\n\n“We don’t know anything” was a thesis put forth by many. Women would say that they were praying for somebody in particular but trying not to have an opinion about the situation overall. It felt like the whole population had chosen to be like children who didn’t want to understand anything.\n\n…\n\nWe saw that the war really worried them, but kept hearing people repeat the empty phrase, “It will all turn out fine.” At first, I didn’t understand how understanding the developing tragedy went hand in hand with a refusal to think about it.\n\n“What are the most basic responses to danger? Fight, flight, or freezing,” a psychologist explained to me. “Those who could, fled. Fighting meant joining the aggressor. Freezing, playing dead, is a form of internal emigration. To avoid making any public reaction in order to survive.”\n\nThis freezing response was exactly what we were seeing: people refused to take any action, come to any conclusions, and tried to blend in with everyone else. These people only supported the war on paper.\n\n…\n\nOne friend told us about her dentist, who she had been going to for many years. When the war started, the friend asked everyone who supported the war to unfollow her on Facebook. Her dentist sent her this message:\n\nAs an honest person, I unfollowed you on Facebook. But I am also really upset. I read about it every day, I listen to the news. I am not for this war, of course, I am against people and children dying. But I cannot support your position. I believe that there was no other way for us to proceed. That most likely, this war would have come to our territory. That coming to an agreement with them [the Ukrainians] was unrealistic. I have a ton of patients from there, and my teachers. This is my position, it’s how I feel, and how I live. I don’t want anybody to try to change my mind. I support an authoritarian state, I want there to be a Tsar. I don’t believe in freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or anything else you’re so eager for.\n\nMy friend, who’d known this woman as good and thoughtful, was flabbergasted.\n\n“We’d talked so much. She’s a really meticulous doctor. But she thinks that she is incapable of getting anything good done on her own. That’s her conviction, that Russians can’t do anything of their own volition, they’ll always need to be forced to work, live, and study. They need a strong hand; Putin picked up this country’s pieces and put them back together. She said, ‘What do I need freedom of speech for? What would it change for me, in my life?’ All of this seems infused with exhaustion.”\n\nI have this paradoxical thought: could it be that many Putin supporters actually have a much more pessimistic perspective than those of us who don’t support any of this? I think that the picture my friend painted for me can be captioned “learned helplessness.”\n\n…\n\nThere was an assumption that once the coffins start arriving in Russian towns, people will start to wonder.\n\nAn artist I know tells me, “I’m from the Urals. I called my brother a few days ago. He’s in a small town, everybody there knows each other. And they got six coffins [of Russian soldiers] sent to them in one day. My brother says, ‘The fact is, we should’ve [finished off] that Ukraine a long time ago… Stalin, now, he kept all those fascists, all those enemies of the people, in camps. But Khrushchev let all the Banderites and Chechens out; Gorbachev destroyed a major world power; Yeltsin armed Ukraine and gave Crimea away. And now Putin’s having to deal with the consequences of all that.”\n\nThe majority of my friends in Moscow felt that in a single day they lost the things that gave their lives meaning. Everything we’d been holding on to broke. An enormous number of people left, because of that, not just because they were afraid.\n\nBut for many people, it was the opposite: everything filled with meaning and hope. Losing their former, pre-war lives wasn’t that big a deal for them. Because what they gained was a powerful conviction of their rightness, a conviction that can’t be broken now, no matter how many train stations are bombed. Maybe life did get harder in some ways, but now there’s hope: we’re going to come together, defeat the evil enemy, get everything back on track.\n\n…\n\nChildren in preschools stand in the shape of a “Z.” Zs are drawn on the doors of dissenters who need a good scare. The letter has a rude, fascist charisma. It’s a sign of power and will that breaks down borders and conventions. It’s semiotically identical to the lightning bolts of the SS.\n\nYet all of Russia, from Putin to the grocery-store check-out clerk, believes that it’s fighting fascism. Is this why 20-year-old kids are killing thousands of guys just like them, guys who speak the exact same language? Is this why we are destroying Russian-speaking cities and millions of their inhabitants are fleeing to Europe?\n\nPeople in Russia are accustomed to seeing war as a sacred experience, one that can wash everything away and return them to some true meaning, restoring them to themselves. They think war will release them from what they ended up living in. The entire country’s repeating words about “denazification,” “demilitarization,” and “liberation.” You can’t help but notice that these words didn’t come out of nowhere. This really is what people want, subconsciously, but they can’t have it. So they vent their frustration by being aggressive to the people they think are most like them. Russia is doing to Ukraine what it wants to do to itself….\n\nYou might have expected that Republican lawmakers would have been giddy last night with the leaked news that the newly far-right Supreme Court is on the cusp of granting their half-century-old dream, the dream of erasing abortion rights that was the very reason the party began putting forth those new archconservative nominees to begin with. Nope. Republican lawmakers were and continue to be absolutely furious, alleging that the rare (but hardly unprecedented) leak from the court is an outrage that must not be allowed to stand.\n\nAnd so a parade of willing seditionists, defenders of corruption, and those who keep voting to block investigations into any of it in order to advance Republican power have spent the last 24 hours screaming about the norms while saying little to nothing about the raw cruelty of Alito’s leaked far-far-right opinion, or its hints that the Trump-packed court intends to use the Alito framework to undo rights ranging from LGBT marriage to contraception to anti-“sodomy” laws.\n\nNo, the Republican Party that both mounted an attempted coup and is still working, to this day, to block the investigations into who organized the effort and who they had help from—they’re very mad about the Alito-written draft opinion getting leaked. It didn’t even take an hour for that to become [the Republican and conservative media talking point].\n\nThe Senate’s two most visible insurrection backers weighed in, of course. Sen. Ted Cruz was outraged by the “blatant attempt to intimidate the Court through public pressure rather than reasoned argument,” which you know is bullshit because insurrection. At the same time, Sen. Josh Hawley immediately went weird conspiracy crank because apparently not even history-shaking reality is as exciting as the theories in his own head.\n\nGiven the apparently coordinated nature of this hit on the Court, I certainly hope every Democrat Senator is ready to answer whether they saw the opinion before Politico published it, and if they know who leaker is\n\nThere’s no part of that that makes sense, which is how you know Josh Hawley wrote it himself. He also has a solution: The Libs Made Me Fascist Harder!\n\nThe Court should not abide this coordinated assault by the Left. Issue the decision now\n\nElsewhere in Team Active Sedition, we find that same “intimidating,” coupled with a “radical left.” It’s not attempting to overthrow the U.S. government or packing the courts with unqualified hardliners that’s radical; it’s some clerk or technical worker inside the Supreme Court leaking the end of abortion rights in this nation before Team Sedition’s justices have fully crossed the t’s and dotted the i’s.\n\nThe goal of this unprecedented breach is to intimidate sitting Supreme Court justices. This is yet another example of how the radical left intends to “fundamentally transform” America.\n\nThe man who broke the court himself, Mitch McConnell, repeats the notion that the real “mob rule” is a random leaker inside the Supreme Court. “Escalation,” “radical left,” “attack,” and “intimidate” are all used, giving the impression of coordinated violence akin to, say, insurrection to describe reporters getting a leaked document from an unknown government source.\n\nLast night’s stunning breach was an attack on the independence of the Supreme Court. By every indication, this was yet another escalation in the radical left’s ongoing campaign to bully and intimidate federal judges and substitute mob rule for the rule of law.\n\nWhat’s important here, however, is to remember that McConnell is the most prolific liar in all of government now that Trump is gone. He literally gives speeches like this on a daily basis, all explaining that “the left” are the real radicals and that he is a man of high principle who would never do the things he just did. Mitch McConnell invented new rule after new rule to make sure the Supreme Court slid to the current archconservative dismantlers even as America continued to vote for Democratic presidents to undo it. There’s nobody who’s been more radical; a press leak may be embarrassing, but it’s neither an insurrection nor a spate of new laws blocking Americans from their ballots.\n\n[…] Alito’s hyper-cruel opinion must be hidden from the public lest Alito feel vulnerable about it. Every theocratic fascist is secretly a wilting flower, which is why we’re getting all these new laws banning books that make people like Sam Freaking Alito feel bad.\n\n[…] OH MY GOD I’m just going to start filtering out any tweets or news stories that so much as mention Susan Collins’ name. Susan Collins could be replaced with a potted plant and it would make absolutely no difference in anyone’s lives, ever. Imagine basing a whole political career on the theme of being the single most gullible person in America—and getting reelected for it.\n\nBut the talking point is the talking point, and it’s still going.\n\n[Aaron Rupar] Mentions on Fox News/Business so far today:\n\nAbortion: 40\n\nLeak: 49\n\n[snipped Mitt Romney’s “it’s a decision I support” and “fully investigate the leak” tweet]\n\nAlso Sen. Lindsey Graham said something, and I don’t even care. Lindsey saved his top career meltdown for the purpose of railroading a serial sex predator through the confirmation process rather than abide testimony against him. […]\n\n[…] the notion that “a Supreme Court leak is the real insurrection” has gotten a lot of traction among the people who … don’t think actual insurrections are bad.\n\n[Matt Walsh] The SCOTUS leak is an actual insurrection. An attempt to completely upend and delegitimize the rule of law, incite violence and chaos, and potentially plunge the nation into civil war. January 6th ws a stroll in the park compared to this. It’s not even close.\n\n[…] There is a distinct link between the curtailing of abortion rights and rising fascism, by the way.\n\nThere are two things to note that make Team Sedition’s posturing here even more grotesque than it first appears—aside from the uncanny link between restricting reproductive justice and authoritarianism/fascism. The first is that we sincerely don’t know who could have leaked this opinion or why, and we probably won’t know for a long time. There’s just as much reason to expect a conservative abortion opponent inside the court leaked the document to blame a secret liberal inside the court; if conservative justices were feeling uneasy about the sheer magnitude of what Alito intends to unravel, leaking the document would paint a target on whichever conservative justices were threatening to back out.\n\nSo it’s yet again the case that the Republicans insisting that their enemy, “the left,” are responsible for the latest crimes against Washington decency are basing those claims on fictions inside their own heads. They don’t know who leaked any more than the rest of us do, and they don’t know why.\n\nThe other detail that Republican outrage is conveniently ignoring is that while Supreme Court leaks are rare, they’re far from unprecedented. And leaking about Roe, in particular, is quite precedented!\n\nIn 1973, the result in Roe leaked to Time magazine. Justice Burger wanted all clerks to undergo lie detector tests, but Rehnquist and Brennan objected\n\nUnlike an attempt by House and Senate Republicans to nullify an American presidential election based on false claims and party-pushed hoaxes, leaks from the Supreme Court are not, in fact, unprecedented assaults on our democracy.\n\nOne can even make the case that our Supreme Court justices might behave a bit better if there were more leaks into how they arrive at their decisions, given this new court’s unwillingness to even issue written explanations of some of their most radical orders. Perhaps we would learn more about why the wife of a Supreme Court justice felt so confident about her own role in an attempted pro-Trump coup, and why that justice voted to block further evidence from coming to light. Perhaps we would learn why the court is currently pretending, very very hard, to be confused over whether constitutionally protected rights can be scrubbed out by any state willing to hire private bounty hunters to do it for them.\n\nPerhaps we’d learn why Alito’s opinion leans so heavily into arguments that not just abortion rights need to be erased, but that civil rights legislation needs to be rolled back by several generations—back to the days when American women couldn’t open bank accounts without their husband’s permission, much less have control over their own human selves. Perhaps, though, we’d just learn that the current Supreme Court is just as devoted to forcing Republican rule onto the rest of us as the Josh Hawleys of the party are. They just don’t have to explain themselves when they do it.\n\nThe big story today is that something not small happened over the last week. Since Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine moved to what is being called the Battle of the Donbas, most actions seem to have taken place at a rate that roughly approximates the growth of fingernails. Here and there Russian forces have managed to advance, but far more often attempts to dislodge Ukrainian forces from towns and villages have been repulsed.\n\nSadly, because the area of the battle is close to the Russian border, Russia is able to defend the airspace with both planes and anti-aircraft systems working from across the border. That makes it difficult for Ukrainian aircraft to operate in the area and give Ukraine the kind of air support that would allow them to make large-scale counter attacks. So Russia keeps shelling, then tries to move forward. Then it shells some more. Russian losses are terrible. Ukrainian losses are also painfully high. But Ukraine has multiple prepared positions against just this kind of attack, and Russia has nothing like the ratio of forces necessary to overwhelm Ukrainian positions.\n\nSo, in most of eastern Ukraine, the fields are getting heavily fertilized with blood, and the muddy roads are getting heavily strewn with wreckage, but not much else is happening that looks like progress for either side.\n\nWhich only serves to make what’s happening north of Kharkiv more exciting. [map available at the link]\n\nOver the last week, Ukraine has mounted a steady counteroffensive directed at troops north of Kharkiv and west of the Siverskyi Donets River. Starting with Russian forces right on the doorstep of the battered city, Ukraine has pushed back through the suburbs, then into outlying towns and villages along multiple roadways. On the west, they’ve pressed in to take the town of Udy, less than 5 miles from the Russian border.\n\nIn what may be one of the most impressive moves of the second phase of the war, Ukrainian forces bypassed Russian forces in multiple villages, took a series of small roads, and entered the town of Staryi Saltiv on Sunday—a move so unexpected that when I first got reports of Ukrainian forces in the town, I disregarded them. […]\n\nBut the Ukrainian move into Staryi Saltiv was real, and though fighting in the town continues, it seems that Russian forces that were south of that location, but on the west bank of the Donet"
