        "meta_description": "Treasury Targets Critical Arteries of the Russian Federation Economy, Fully Blocking Largest Public and Private Banks New Sanctions Imposed on Putin’s Family and Architects of War President’s New Executive Order To Ban New Investment in Russia WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) took major steps to degrade the economy of the Russian Federation in response to Russia’s continued brutal war against Ukraine and atrocities against Ukrainian citizens. Treasury is imposing full blocking sanctions on Sberbank, Russia’s largest state-owned bank, and Alfa-Bank, Russia’s largest private bank. Treasury is also targeting family members of President Vladimir Putin (Putin) and Foreign Minster Sergey Lavrov (Lavrov), as well as Russian Security Council members who are complicit in the war against Ukraine. In addition, the President is issuing a new Executive Order today, which bans new investment in the Russian Federation and the provision of certain services to any person located in the Russian Federation by U.S. persons, wherever located. “Russia’s military forces have committed heinous atrocities in Ukraine and the global community must hold them to account,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today we are taking additional steps to cut off Russia from international markets in response to Putin’s continued brutality. This serious action, including fully blocking Russia’s largest bank and banning new investment in Russia, will further restrict Putin’s ability to fund and supply his war.” Today’s designations are taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024, which authorizes sanctions against Russia for its harmful foreign activities, including violating core principles of international law, such as respect for the territorial integrity of other states. OFAC’s actions complement the ongoing efforts of international allies and partners to hold accountable all those responsible for furthering this unconscionable war of choice against Ukraine and its people.   SBERBANK AND 42 SBERBANK SUBSIDIARIES Today, Treasury is fully blocking Public Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia (Sberbank), which is uniquely important to the Russian Federation economy, holding about a third of all bank assets in Russia.

It holds the largest market share of savings deposits in the country, is the main creditor of the Russian economy, and is deemed by the GoR to be a systemically important financial institution. On February 24, 2022, OFAC identified Sberbank as subject to prohibitions pursuant to Directive 2 under E.O. 14024, “Prohibitions Related to Correspondent or Payable-Through Accounts and Processing of Transactions Involving Certain Foreign Financial Institutions” (the “Russia-related CAPTA Directive”) and the Russia-related Entities Directive for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy, thereby expanding the sanctions that were imposed on Sberbank pursuant to E.O. 13662 in September 2014.
