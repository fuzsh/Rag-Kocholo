        "text": "In 1893 builders Albert C. Squier and William E. Lanchantin acquired a 48-foot-wide plot of vacant land on the south side of West 82nd Street, between West End Avenue and Riverside Drive. Somewhat surprisingly, instead of instructing prolific architect Clarence Fagan True to design two 24-foot-wide residences on the parcel, in keeping with the mansions that were rising in the neighborhood, they asked for three.\n\nCompleted in 1894, the trio were luxurious, despite their narrow, 16-foot widths. True designed the group in his own take on the Romanesque Revival style. The center house, 312 West 82nd Street, was an American basement residence, meaning it was entered almost directly at street level. Clad in undressed brownstone, it rose four stories to a slate-shingled mansard with a prominent, peaked-roofed dormer. At the second floor a faceted bay provided a balcony to the third floor.\n\nOn June 30, 1894, the Real Estate Record & Guide reported that Squier and Lanchantin \"have sold to a Mr. Martin No. 312 West 82d street, one of a row of newly-erected three-story [sic] stone front dwellings.\" The use of pseudonyms when purchasing property was not uncommon, and as it turned out, \"Mr. Martin\" was, in fact, James Griswold Wentz.\n\nAn attorney with Sweetser, Pembroke & Co., Wentz was just beginning to deal in real estate, himself. He and his wife, the former Georgie Banyer Nichols, had been married four years earlier. Despite his significant wealth, it was his wife who drew the social attention.\n\nGeorgie's earliest American ancestor, Sergeant Francis Nicol, arrived in America in 1660 with his uncle, Richard Nicol, who later became Colonial Governor of New York. Her great-grandfathers on both sides fought in the American Revolution. Included in her pedigree were elite names like Ogden, Whitney and Bulkley.\n\nLike all socialites, Georgie was involved in charity work. On February 1, 1896, for instance, The Sun reported that she \"will throw open her house to-day for the benefit of the Ladies' Domestic Missionary Society, St. Matthew's Episcopal Church, in West Eighty-fourth street.\" That afternoon the ladies enjoyed a musicale.\n\nDuring their early married years, the Wentzes traveled extensively, especially during the summer months. On July 2, 1897, The Evening Telegram announced that the couple \"will pass the month of July making a trip through the St. Lawrence River to the Thousand Islands. In August they will go to the White Mountains.\"\n\nAt the turn of the century, Georgie turned her attention to politics. On November 5, 1900, the Woman's Republican Club was organized in her parlor. The power of Georgie Wentz's name was reflected in the appearance of Senator Chauncey M. Depew, who spoke for an hour at that meeting. Georgie would be the club's president for years, and when a reporter asked her \"for her own special reason for being a politician\" in October 1904, she replied in part:\n\nBecause I believe that it is in the home that the incorruptible politician is made. When you see a man lax in his duties in this respect, dishonest, unscrupulous, you will find either that he left home too early or that when he was there his duty was not made clear to him.\n\nThe mother has in her hands the molding of the child's morals. If she neglects it, the fault is here. If the voters of the coming generation are started right in the home they will continue on the right path.\n\nIn the meantime, the Wentzes continued their travels. On May 28, 1901, The Evening Telegram reported that they would \"visit the Pan-American Exposition, at Buffalo, in June. Later in the summer they will go to Maine to remain until September.\" And in July the following year, the New York Herald announced that they had sailed for Europe for the season.\n\nThe couple's summer seasons became more predictable after 1903 when they acquired a Newport cottage, Beaumaris, at the junction of Brenton and Wickham Roads over looking the ocean. It was in Newport that Georgie's and Alva Vanderbilt Belmont's mutual cause, Women's Suffrage, coincided. By 1914 Georgie was hosting the Newport County Woman Suffrage League meetings at Beaumaris; and in 1915 she aided Alva Belmont with a suffrage event at Marble House.\n\nIt is unclear when Georgie's widowed mother, Georgiana Bulkley Nichols, first moved in with the couple. She died in the Manhattan house at the age of 70 on May 27, 1908. The social prominence of the family demanded two funerals, one in the West 82nd Street house at 10 a.m. on May 30, and a second \"at the homestead, in Southport, Connecticut,\" four hours later.\n\nIn 1910 Wentz purchased the residence at 335 West End Avenue and the following year sold 312 West 82nd Street to Isaac Steigerwald, a partner in The Machine Metals Products Company of New York.\n\nSteigerwald was the first of a succession of owners. He sold it in 1917, and it was resold in 1919, and again in 1922 to Ferdinand B. Minrath and his wife Anna. Minrath was the head of the George Minrath Pharmacy. Living with the couple were Scott Minrath, his wife Gertrude, and their children. The adopted son of Ferdinand's and Anna's daughter, Scott Minrath was a 1918 graduate of Princeton University and worked with the Guaranty Trust Co. of New York.\n\nThe family was clear on their preferences in domestic help. An advertisement in September 1922 sought, \"Chambermaid-Waitress, small private house; only white need apply; German preferred.\"\n\nFerdinand Minrath did not enjoy his new home for long. On April 21, 1923 he died in the house. His will suggests that there may have been tensions between him and his adopted grandson. Scott Minrath received $1,000 (about $15,000 today), and Gertrude and the children received the \"right to occupy house at 312 West 82d Street.\"\n\nOnce again the house went through a succession of buyers, until 1958, when it was purchased by H. Edwin and Mildred Cason Smith as headquarters for their Group Relations Ongoing Workshops, Inc. (GROW). The building remained little changed inside until 1970 when the Smiths converted the first through fourth floors to offices and classrooms.\n\nOn July 14, 1972, Iver Peterson of The New York Times explained that the group-therapy school \"uses the group-discussion method to teach paying students how to conduct their own 'behavioral sciences' programs dealing with the emotional and social problems of their clients.\" He described GROW as \"One of the largest group therapy training schools in the city.\"\n\nBut Ivers was concerned about the faculty's credentials. He pointed to five members with Ph.D's from Philathea College, \"a former Bible school in London, Ontario, which is not accredited in Canada and is not recognized by any accredited American college or university.\" He noted, as well, \"GROW's founder and executive director, H. Edwin Smith, is listed as having a doctorate from an unaccredited college in Florida.\"\n\nDr. Edward F. Carr, director of the State Division of Higher Education, said, \"It's pretty difficult to tell here where the charlatanism ends and the integrity begins.\"\n\nIn 1985 Paul Plassan hired architect Douglas P. Herrlin to return the property to a single family home. He shared it with his partner, motion picture and Broadway hair stylist and wig designer Paul Huntley. The house also served as Huntley's work studio. Upon Plassan's death in 1991, title to the property was transferred to Huntley.\n\nimage via lesliegarfield.com\n\nHuntley's work was epochal in the theater. He was responsible for Carol Channing's trademark bouffant in Hello Dolly!, the wigs for Elizabeth Taylor in the 1963 motion picture Cleopatra, and for the 2014 play Bullets Over Broadway, alone, worked on 48 wigs. In his 60-year career he styled hair and created wigs for more than 200 Broadway shows.\n\nHuntley sold 312 West 82nd Street in January 2021. The following month he flew to London to work on Diana: The Musical. He died there on July 13 at the age of 88.\n\nphotograph by the author\n\nno permission to reuse the content of this blog has been granted to LaptrinhX.com\n\nIn the pre-Civil War years the volunteer Friendship Hook and Ladder Company, No. 12, operated from 78 East 13th Street (renumbered 108 East 13th Street in 1866). In January 1865 a bill was introduced in the State Senate to establish a professional fire department. The New York Times noted it \"has created a great excitement in fire circles, and among the better class of firemen it is not very favorably received.\" Nevertheless, the Metropolitan Fire Department was formed and in July 1865 the transfer of property of the volunteer houses to the department was documented.\n\nThe inventory was meticulous. Among the items being passed to Hook and Ladder Company 3 (which would be formally organized on September 11 that year) were \"one truck, ladders, four axes,\" and \"forty-five chairs, five broken chairs, one table.\" Keeping the names of the original ten members of the company straight may have been challenging--three were named James and five were John.\n\nThe old firehouse was showing its age at the end of World War I. On February 11, 1919 the Fire Commissioner sent a request to the board of Estimate and Apportionment to approve plans \"for alterations and repairs to the quarters of Hook and Ladder Company No. 3 at 108 East 13th street.\" The cost of the renovations was estimated at $3,375 (about $50,500 today).\n\nThe days of horse-drawn trucks was quickly drawing to a close, and repairs to the vintage structure could not accommodate motorized vehicles. In 1928 the Victorian building was demolished and architect John R. Sliney drew plans for a modern firehouse on the site. Completed the following year, his two-story design drew on the waning Arts & Crafts style. The vast truck bay was outlined in rusticated stone that rose to a segmental arch. Shallow, full height piers rose to a stone entablature and cornice, above which was a stepped parapet.\n\nMayor James J. Walker presided over the opening ceremonies on October 8, 1929, during which Edward J. Kenny presented the company with two searchlight trucks. Kenny, who was an honorary deputy chief, gave the equipment in memory of his father, Battalion Chief Thomas A. Kenny. A newspaper reported, \"The searchlights were set in action by Mayor Walker, who turned their 3,700 watts each on the taller buildings in that neighborhood.\" The article added, \"The new firehouse is occupied by H & L Co. 3, Water Tower No. 2 and the Chief of the 6th Battalion. It is of standard design and replaces a very old structure on that site for many years.\"\n\nAmong the firefighters here in 1936 was James H. Martin, a 30-year veteran. On September 28 the New York Post reported, \"Ever since he can remember, young Artie Martin has wanted to b e a fireman just like his father. Well, he's a fireman today.\" A bachelor, Arthur Martin lived with his parents in the Bronx, but he would be seeing a lot more of his father now. The article said, \"Father and son shook hands on it when the boy was assigned to Hook and Ladder No. 3 at 108 East Thirteenth Street, where the senior Martin is stationed.\"\n\nPersonal danger is part of a firefighter's everyday life. That was reflected on New Year's Eve 1946 when Hook and Ladder Company 3 responded to a four-alarm fire at 749 Broadway. Seven firefighters were trapped when the fourth floor of the seven-story loft building collapsed, \"apparently from the weight of water poured in to fight the blaze,\" reported The New York Sun. Among them was Captain George H. Winter of Hook and Ladder Company 3. It would take seven and a half hours to pull the last of the men out. In all 31 firefighters were injured, three of them, including Winter, critically.\n\nThe fire trucks were fueled from a 550-gallon gasoline storage tank on the premises. The men of both companies launched into action early on the morning of August 31, 1950. The Yonkers, New York Herald Statesman reported \"A Manhattan fire company fought a stubborn blaze on its own premises early today...The blaze, of undetermined origin, was confined to the basement of a firehouse at 108 East 13th Street.\" Happily, the fire was extinguished before it reached the storage tank.\n\nThe firehouse was the scene of a horrifying incident on July 24, 1963. What evolved into \"a savage feud,\" as worded by the Long Island Star-Journal between Hondo T. Barimm and Qani Saraci had begun years earlier in their homeland of Albania. The intense hatred between the two culminated that afternoon at 2:30 when Barimm walked out of his apartment house and noticed Saraci on the street. Police later recounted that \"Barimm drew his automatic and Saraci fled south on Third avenue with Barimm, gun in hand, in hot pursuit.\"\n\nAfter ducking behind parked cars in a parking lot, Saraci fled into the East 13th Street firehouse. Firefighter Olin Blair was on watch at the desk when, \"Suddenly Saraci and Barimm raced into the firehouse, and Barim fired a shot which mortally wounded Saraci as it ripped into his left eye.\" As the dying man sought cover under a ladder truck, Barimm pulled out a knife and began \"to hack at Saraci's left ear,\" according to police.\n\nBlair grabbed a crowbar and demanded that Barimann back off. He told police later, \"Barimm pointed the gun at me, but I had a feeling he wouldn't shoot.\" In the meantime, another firefighter, Gustav Knoeckel lowered the bay door to prevent Barimmn's escape. When police arrived, \"Barimm surrendered meekly,\" according to the Long Island Star-Journal. He was charged with homicide and held without bail in what newspapers called the \"Vendetta Death.\"\n\nAn incinerator fire a few blocks from the firehouse ended in a dramatic scene on the morning of August 31, 1987. Once back at the firehouse, the men got off the 40-foot ladder truck to help direct traffic as Firefighter Lawrence Brown prepared to back it into the bay. The 36-year-old Brown told journalist Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times, \"When I turned over my left shoulder, I saw one of our guys tumbling down and a guy in a van speeding off.\" The driver had hit Firefighter Douglas C. Hantusch and fled the scene. What he did not expect was that he would be pursued by a wailing firetruck.\n\nPurdum wrote, \"With the fire truck's lights blazing, Firefighter Brown sped west on 13th Street...Just west of Seventh Avenue, the fleeing motorist found himself blocked by a double-parked truck and gave up.\" Brown climbed down from the truck, reached through the open window of the van, and switched off the ignition. He held 20-year-old Michael P. Ottino until police arrived. He was charged with leaving the scene of an accident and failing to yield to an emergency vehicle.\n\nThe most tragic day in the history of the firehouse came exactly 136 years to the day after the establishment of Hook and Ladder Co. 3. At 8:46 on the morning of September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center's North Tower. Even before United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower seventeen minutes later, the men of Hook and Ladder Company 3 had arrived on the scene. When the North Tower collapsed at 10:28, 11 members of Hook and Ladder Company 3 were lost.\n\nThe company's heavily damaged firetruck was stored at JFK Airport for a decade, before being put on display at the 9/11 Memorial & Museum where it sits today. The names of the hero firefighters are memorialized in bronze plaques on the exterior of 108 East 13th Street.\n\nphotos by the author\n\nno permission to reuse the content of this blog has been granted to LaptrinhX.com"
