Recognize any of the following names?\n\nDonald Trump – The Donald\n\nAllan Dalton – CEO of Realtor.com\n\nJason Hartman – CEO of Empowered Investor Network\n\nThe Astors – self explanatory\n\nThe Rockefellers – self explanatory\n\nHarry Helmsley – created the empire that got his wife in trouble.\n\nSteve Wynn – Vegas, baby!\n\nThe Bloombergs – self explanatory\n\nRobert Kiyosaki – Rich Dad, Poor Dad\n\nWilliam Zeckendorf – early United States real estate developer\n\nSome of these names were born into money and some began with very little. The common denominator is they did it with real estate. Property investing is not a passing fad (unless human life on earth is also). History has proven over and over that income property is the most proven wealth creator. Ever. Why would you do anything else?\n\nIf you took everything away from Donald Trump – his properties, television show, bank accounts, and high roller connections – but only left him two things. Leave him a decent credit rating and the knowledge in his head of how he built his sprawling empire in the first place. Chances are, it wouldn’t be long before he was back at the top again.\n\nIf The Donald can do it with possibly the worst coiffed head of hair in history, why not you?\n\nFlickr / Gage Skidmore"
