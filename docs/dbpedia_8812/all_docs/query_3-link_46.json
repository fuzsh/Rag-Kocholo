        "text": "The Development of William Mossop’s Character in Hobson’s Choice William Mossop started off as a lodger lodging with Ada Figgins. He was shy and had no ambitions working at Hobson’s shoe shop at the bottom of the chain. At the end of the play he was ambitious, married and the joint owner of Hobsons shop. The audience sympathises with Willie the first time he appears on stage because he ‘only comes half way up the trap door’. This is because of his social standing and he feels that he is\n\nMemory and Memory loss in Death of a Salesman and Soucouyant The Death of a Salesman and Soucouyant both broach the topic of memory, in opposite but complementary ways. Where ‘Death’ is about falsifying positive memories, and Soucouyant is about ‘forgetting to forget’. Where adeles memories are a trauma, and very much tried to forget, willies memories are a solace to him, and a way for him to cope with his failures. Both detail an unchronological slip of a figure into mental illness, and both end\n\nPoems are the best to express thoughts to readers, many writers choose to write poems to speak their feelings which plain ordinary texts will not do. Three poems have special ideas about marriage, they are: “Marriage” by William Carlos Williams, “Marriea Love” by Kuan Tao-Sheng, and an untitled one by Apache Song. All three of them have a central idea of marriage; two people are one individual after marriage, one cannot separate from the other one. These poems are short but they carry deep morals\n\nof these poets impacted by these movements was William Carlos Williams. His rapidly changing work changed for the better and caused him to become an influential literary figure. A literary experimenter and innovator, William Carlos Williams, was a busy and hardworking poet. William Carlos Williams was born in Rutherford, NJ on September 17, 1883. He was introduced to literature and the arts, especially Shakespeare, at a fairly young age. Williams became a doctor and fulfilled his passion every\n\nWilliam Carlos Williams was from Rutherford, New Jersey, born in 1883. By trade, he was both a doctor and writer. Williams published poetry, novels, and essays in small magazines. Williams started as an imagist movement poet, “which emphasized simplicity, clarity of expression, and precision through the use of exacting visual images” (poets.org). He later began to write more about the life of everyday people. His poem, “The Widow’s Lament in Springtime” follows this writing style. The poem\n\nPieter Brueghel was a 16th century Netherlandish Renaissance painter who completed “Landscape with the Fall of Icarus” in 1558. His painting was inspired by the ancient Greek myth of Daedalus and Icarus. William Carlos Williams, a Puerto-Rican American poet, wrote a poem inspired by Brueghel’s work in 1960 similarly titled “Landscape with the Fall of Icarus”. There is a common theme displayed in both works which both execute and establish this theme with different visual and literary connotations\n\nactually mean? When we are reading, many of us don’t actually stop to think about the meaning of each word (unless the word is unfamiliar), instead we just assume what it means—we read automatically. Looking at the poem, “To A Poor Old Woman” by William Carlos Williams, we see the Shklovsky’s concept of “defamiliarization” in use. When we look at Shklovsky’s concept, “The technique of art is to make objects ‘unfamiliar’ to make forms difficult, to increase the difficulty and length of perception because\n\n“Hold back the edges of your gowns, Ladies, we are going through hell,” (Sullivan 1) as William Carlos Williams put it, in introducing the first edition of Allen Ginsberg’s Howl. Most famously known for Howl, Ginsberg was recognized for his obscene and exaggerated writing style. With Edgar Allen Poe being a form of influence and admiration in Ginsberg’s eyes, it’s understandable to see where he gets his inspiration. Allen Ginsberg’s work of literature is important because it challenges mainstream\n\nIn William Carlos Williams’ “The Use of Force,” a doctor visits a patient who is at fatal risk of diphtheria. This narration is told in first person in the perspective of the doctor as a reflection on his visit. The story is allegorical for impulsivity and self control. From the moment he arrives on scene, it becomes evident that the visit will be out of the ordinary, to say the least. Due to lack of cooperation from the young girl he tends to and the inability to control his mind, body, or temper\n\nWilliams fits into the Aristotelian tragic hero model because he was born slightly elevated status in the 1950’s Chicago society. Williams’ came from a pretty well known family; his mother being former model Laurie McLaurin, and his father, Robert Fitzgerald Williams, a Ford Motor Company executive. His great-great-grandfather was Mississippi Governor and Senator Anselm J. McLaurin. Growing up in Chicago, Williams was lonesome and was often found playing with toys by himself in his family’s suburban"
