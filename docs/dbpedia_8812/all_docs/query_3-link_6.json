        "text": "William Zeckendorf, the flamboyant real estate developer who put together the site for the United Nations headquarters and transformed scores of ailing properties into profitable assets before his overextended company crashed in a spectacular bankruptcy, died Thursday night of a stroke in his apartment at 65th Street and Park Avenue. He was 71 years old.\n\nMr. Zeckendorf had been ill intermittently for the last six years, suffering a series of strokes that sharply curtailed his activities. Nevertheless, he continued to serve as a consultant to the General Property Corporation, successor to the Webb & Knapp concern, which failed in 1965.\n\nFirst as vice president, then as president, board chairman and sole stockholder, Mr. Zeckendorf was the propulsive force behind Webb & Knapp's dealings for 27 years. The company traded in major hotels and office buildings with the ease of a housewife buying a loaf of bread, holding at various times the Chrysler and Graybar Buildings and the St. Regis, Astor and Drake hotels.\n\nIt initiated such landmark developments as Kips Bay Plaza in New York, Place Ville‐Marie in Montreal, Society ‘Hill in Philadelphia, L'Enfant Plaza in Washington, Mile High City in Denver and Century City in Los Angeles. The projects, many of which were completed by others, have been credited with spurring the revival of downtowns throughout this country and in Canada.\n\nA Shaky Structure\n\nBehind these accomplishments, however, and the facade of glamour, hoopla and prosperity that Mr. Zeckendorf also built for the company, was a shakey structure of loans at high interest rates that proved too weak to sustain Mr. Zeckendorf's vaulting ambitions.\n\nAnd even before Webb & Knapp's failure in 1965, sophisticated observers in the real estate field noted that for every Zeckendorf project that got built there seemed to be another that disappeared after a big publicity buildup.\n\nAmong the projects that failed to move belond the drawing boards were a multiblock commercial and factory center on the West Side of Manhattan with an airport on the rooftops, a 102‐story tower on top of Grand Central Terminal and grand avenue of office and apartment houses along 42d Street leading to the United Nations.\n\nNevertheless, professionals familiar with his career give Mr. Zeckendorf credit for both imagination and accomplishment. Harmon Goldstone, an architect and former chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said of him yesterday that “he was an enormous stimulus, a sparkplug for New York and a very creative personality, in many ways ahead of his time.”\n\nRoger L. Stevens, chairman of the John F.’ Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, a Broadway producer and a real estate broker who was both competitor and associate of Mr. Zeckendorf at various times, said, “in any year when he was working, he made more successful deals alone than the next five busiest brokers all together.”\n\nMr. Stevens said Mr. Zeckendorf, whom he regarded as “a close, personal friend,” had failed in the end because “he wanted to make every deal in New York; because he had mind‐boggling energy and ability; because he got carried away and bought more than he could handle financially.”\n\nMr. Zeckendorf emerged from the company's bankruptcy chastened. In an autobiography entitled “Zeckendorf,” and published in 1970, he said that after the months of strain and effort trying to avert the failure, it had come as an “almost welcome stilliness.”\n\n“Now, all action ceased,” he wrote. “I could no longer act for the company. I became, in effect, a bystander at the wake, and an official nonperson, a role both unfamiliar and unenjoyable.”\n\nMore trouble followed. In 1968, Mr. Zeckendorf was forced into a personal bankruptcy. That year, too, his second wife, Marion Griffin, was killed in a plane crash. Two years later, he suffered his first stroke, to be followed by five others.\n\nIn April of this year, a Manhattan grand jury handed up two indictments charging him with failing to file state income taxes for 1972 and 1973 when they were due. Though his lawyer said the taxes had been paid later, the case was still open at the time of his death, according to Peter Andreoli, chief of the District Attorney's Frauds Bureau.\n\nHis First Opportunity\n\nBorn in Paris, Ill., in 1905, he was brought to New York at the age of 3 and after he was graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, he studied at New York University for three years. He got his start in the real estate business in 1925 when an uncle, Samuel Borchard, went to Europe and left him in charge of a half‐empty office building and ordered him to fill it with tenants. He did.\n\nHe later joined the Leonard S. Gans brokerage and in 1938 went to Webb & Knapp as a vice president. The company was well established, but conservative, and Mr. Zeckendorf soon gingered it up. His first big coup was in winning the confidence of Vincent Astor, who turned over to his management properties worth $50 million.\n\nIn a short time, he had increased their value by $5 million. Competitors said anyone could have done as well, given the inflationary trends of the war years, but Mr. Astor apparently was satisfied. He paid Webb & Knapp $400,000 in commissions.\n\nBy the end of World War II, the company had enough backing to launch out into large acquisitions. In 1945 Mr. Zeckendorf was offered the slaughterhouse properties of the Swift and Wilson meatpacking interests on the East River north of 42d Street at a steep price. He bought them, acquired adjoining properties and then announced plans for X City, a complex of office and apartment buildings.\n\nWhile he was still raising the financing for the scheme, however, the United Nations was dickering with the city over a headquarters site. The negotiations did not succeed, and the international organization was about to commit itself to a Philadelphia site, when Mr. Zeckendorf offered most of his X City land. Nelson A. Rockefeller convinced his father, John D. Rockefeller Jr., to put up the $8.5 million needed and the deal was made.\n\nAlthough Mr. Zeckendorf announced many large schemes after this, he considered the United Nations deal the capstone of his career. It is the only one he included in his biography in “Who's Who.”\n\nAt the price of $8.5 million, Mr. Zeckendorf had made about $2.5 million on the sale, but he gave up the opportunity to make many millions more had he gone ahead with his plans .for the property.\n\nAs Webb & Knapp prospered, Mr. Zeckendorf blossomed. He bought a handsome house in Greenwich, Conn., laid down a cellar of more than 20,000 bottles of wines. He filled out physically, too, adding flesh to his 6‐foot frame until he weighed more than 250 pounds.\n\nMr. Zeckendorf was a familiar figure in New York nightclubs. He backed more than 30 Broadway shows, many of them produced by Mr. Stevens. His views were solicited by politicians, bankers and other real estate men. And he provoked interest in himself and in his doings with the help of a public relations aide.\n\n35 Calls An Hour\n\nHis characteristic way of working was by telephone, sometimes negotiating, deals for properties he had never seen. Associates reported that he took as many as 35 calls an hour, often while a visitor sat at his desk, unable to get in more than a few words at a time.\n\nAe he talked on ‐ the telephone, he doodled furiously, creating patterns with triangles. His secretaries preserved these doodles, filing them carefully because often were interspersed with notes on deals he had made.\n\nHis base of operations was a cylindrical office, 26 feet in diameter, on top of the Webb & Knapp headquarters building at 383 Madison Avenue. The office, which was designed for him by I. M. Pei, then the company's chief architect, was windowless, paneled in wood, and illuminated by skylights.\n\nMr. Pei was one of several leading architects Mr. Zeckendorf employed. Others were Wallace K. Harrison, William Lescaze and Le Corbusier.\n\nJust how successful Mr. Zeckendorf was as a moneymaker for Webb & Knepp is difficult to assess. Fortune magazine asserted in a carefully researched article that he had raised the concern's net worth from $127,000 in 1942 to $75 million in. 1957.\n\nBefore Webb & Knapp began retrenching in the 1960's in an effort to satisfy creditors, it was reputed to control properties worth half a billion dollars. When it was forced into bankruptcy in 1965, it had debts of $80 million and assets of only $21 million."
