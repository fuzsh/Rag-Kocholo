There is an interesting article here http://www.palestine-studies.org/jq/fulltext/195195 which describes the Medical Mission at Hafir-el-Auja

quote: The nursing team consisted of four German deaconesses: Sophie, Louisa, Hannah and Lena. They were from the Prussian Kaiserwerth Hospital of the Knights of the Order of St John (a 60-bed hospital in Beirut …..)

There is still a lot to be seen at this site even today and the local WW1 Heritage Society paid a visit there only a few months ago

The main building on the hill overlooking the wells, the Ottoman camp, the railway line and station

The remains of one of the Ottoman building in their base at the foot of the steps

The steps leading down from the main building on the hill to the general area of the Ottoman base

The remains of a Byzantine basilica in the foreground and behind the trees, the water tower serving the Ottoman railway line

When looking at the staffing of the medical units on the Ottoman side in the Palestine campaign it is worth remembering

a] that they made use of the facilities in Jerusalem provided by various Christian religious orders; German, Austrian and others

and b] that up until their entry on the Allied side in late 1917, there was also an American contribution to the Turkish effort in this theatre

[note the American flag]

Beersheva

Beit Hanun

Jerusalem

Mr Whiting was at some time the US Consul in Jerusalem and with his wife, he helped in recruiting nursing staff for the Ottomans, from the American colony in that city

Charlie,

Thanks mate, I had still not found what that unit was.

Still have not found that unit in Turkey with a number of Rail units used as Ottoman Railways were very poor, and supplies had to flow to Mespotania, Caucasus and Palestine by one rail line.

Danke

As to the known photo of her most sourses I am told are incorrect, see this on the photo said to be with FA 300 men

"Dear Tosun Saral, merhaba!

The photographs are great!

In the picture that shows "Felmy" (i.e. Hellmuth Felmy) the short man on the left, marked by an X, is also a Felmy. He is the brother Gerhard Felmy who served in the same squadron.

The picture with the strange title "Baronesse Veronika von Wechmar and Princess Brigitte" (these wrong identifications stem from your source "I. Dunya Savasi'inde...") actually shows only one female. This lady is not a German Red Cross nurse but an Arab Red Crescent nurse. She is an Arab Catholic nun of the congregation of the "Rosary Sisters" (Rahbât el Wardiye). The patients seem to be German soldiers. I send you a real photograph of Veronika and Brigitte in the attachment.

The picture below again shows Arab Rosary Sisters serving as nurses in a Red Crescent hospital. This picture was probably taken in Hafir el Auja and not in Beersheva (turkish: Birüssabi). Similar pictures can be found in the Matson Collection of the Library of Congress.
