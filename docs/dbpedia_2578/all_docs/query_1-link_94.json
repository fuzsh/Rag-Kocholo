        "text": "Part 1:\n\nIsraeli Arabs. Fathers and sons-and increasingly daughters. For the Israelis have liberated the Arab woman, too, in order that she may also vote for anti-Zionists and teach anti-Israel hatred. Thus, when the prime minister's office boasts that \"the expansion of the educational system has helped to raise the standard of education of the younger generation of women\"and \"the fact that Arab women are coming into closer contact with the Jewish population is opening up new horizons,\" one gropes for an explanation for the smug satisfaction. The most that can be said for Israel's liberal policy is that it has created a new generation of Jew haters with due care to ensure that the source of the hate is equal, with discrimination because of sex..\n\nThe generation of the fathers is dying destroyed by the Israeli government's \"head-and-stomach\" policy. The father is dead; long live the son and daughter, whom Israel created. They will do their best to destroy the Jewish state, and, of course, the Jewish state will continue to produce them. The first generation of Israeli Arab university graduates immediately produced the El Ard anti-Israeli movement in the 1960's.\n\nIndeed, even then there were those who saw and understood-and those who did, terrified by what they saw, put it out of mind. In the Midstream magazine (December 1962) Nissim Rejwan, an Israeli writer, said: \"One of the more alarming aspects of the Israeli problem is that the new generation of Israeli Arabs generally shows even less willingness, not to speak of eagerness, to accept the fact of Israel's existence than do their fathers and grandfathers. The so-called Arab 'intelligentsia' in Israel which seems to embrace every literate person from university graduates to those who finished a few secondary classes, are in the majority of cases swayed by the heady talk...about 'settling scores with Israel.' Many of them, it would appear, cannot reconcile themselves to their status as a minority in a Jewish state and keep hoping for some sort of savior.\" Was anyone listening?\n\nThe rise of the new generation of educated Israeli Arabs who did not know the bitter taste of defeat and who openly moved toward confrontation with Zionism and the Jewishness of the state was itself given enormous impetus by the Six-Day-War.\n\nAgain, ironically, it was Jewish military victory that the Jews turned into yet another political defeat. For the first time in nineteen years the Arabs were able to meet and talk with other Arabs who were not Israelis, who called themselves \"Palestinians,\" and who openly spoke of the day when the hated Jews would leave. The Israeli Arab suddenly realized that he was neither meat nor milk, fish nor fowl. He was not an Israeli, but now he was struck by the awesome realization that he had not been a \"Palestinian\" all those years either? He was looked upon by the West Bank \"Palestinians\" as a traitor who cooperated with, and accepted, Israeli citizenship from the Jews who had stolen the land from his people. In one fell swoop, all the factors that went into creating the new radical Israeli Arab came together. Things could never be the same.\n\nNot only were there new contacts with the West Bank \"Palestinians,\" but this was also the beginning of joint cooperation. Thus, Israeli Arabs participated in a \"Palestine Week\" held in 1978 at the Universities of Bethlehem and Bir Zeit. They helped organize it, and they printed and distributed a leaflet calling for the support of the PLO. In defiance of the law several Israeli Arab students have begun studying in schools in the liberated territories.\n\nThe opening of the borders between the State of Israel and the liberated areas was seen by the incredibly obtuse Israelis as allowing the better-fed Israeli Arabs to demonstrate the benefits of Israeli occupation. Of course, a child could have known that the exactly the opposite would occur. The Israeli Arabs were suddenly given the opportunity to meet, regularly, with their own people who were struggling for what the Israeli Arab understood to be a common goal: freedom.\n\nThe mayor of Hebron, Fahd Kawasma, said (January 22, 1979): \"The Israeli Arabs have remained foreigners and their lot remains ours. There is no possibility of blurring the fact that they and we are part of the same people, and the fact that they live in Israel does not make them less Palestinian.\"\n\nIn his newspaper interview, Bir Zeit President Nasir added: \"The destiny of the Arab College at Bir Zeit is to be the nucleus around which is built the Palestinian State.\" Indeed, the Arab students being trained in the Jewish universities of Israel see themselves in the same light. They are the seed of the future \"Palestine\" leaders in the area of \"Palestine conquered in 1948.\" They give leadership and examples to high school students and are the PLO leaders of tomorrow.\n\nThe irony is that the most extraordinary rise in the brazenness has taken place under the supposedly tough Begin government. Maariv reporter Yosef Tzuriel commented on this as long ago as April 26, 1978. \"The rise of the Likud to power created a certain amount of tension in the first months among Arabs of Israel and the territories who expected a firmer policy against them. but after a short while it became clear that the new government was as liberal as its predecessor, if not more so.\"\n\nWhat is the real result of the millions of dollars poured into higher Arab education and the hundreds of millions spent on secondary (high school) training? Consider: In December 1979 the Progressive National Movement (PNM) won the election for control of the Arab Student Committee at Hebrew University. In its platform the PNM called for:\n\nacceptance of the Palestinian Covenant (which calls for the elimination of Israel)\n\nthe creation of a democratic, secular \"Palestine\" in place of Israel\n\nacceptance pf terrorist activities as part of the Palestinian struggle for self-determination.\n\nAnd indeed, in 1979, students and visitors at the university were startled to find mimeographed copies of the Palestinian National charter being distributed.\n\nAnd should one have any doubt, the immensely frank interview with Mahmud Muhareb would dispel all of them. Muhareb, an Israeli Arab citizen of Lydda and at the time chairman of the Arab Student Committee at Hebrew University, presented his views to Maariv, Israel's largest newspaper (January 20, 1978): \"We, the Arab students in the university, constitute and indivisible part of the Arab Palestinian nation, and we struggle in its service in order to achieve its goals.\"\n\n\"As for me and my personal lot, I am first and foremost a Palestinian, resident of Lydda. Israeli citizenship was forced upon me. I do not recognize it and do not see myself as belonging to the State of Israel. The law requires me to carry an Israeli identity card and passport. As a Palestinian, I would prefer Palestinian ones.\"\n\nThere is nothing new or startling about this. The signs of Arab intellectual hatred of Israel and deep desire for the dismantlement were obvious to all who wished to see.\n\nPart 2:\n\nBetween 1978 and 1980 we have seen an inevitable rise in Arab hostility toward the state. After winning the elections of leadership of the Arab students at Hebrew University, the Progressive National Movement opened an office in the student dormitories on Stern Street, hanging out an eye-catching sign: \"Progressive National Movement.\" How a group such as the PNM was allowed to run for office or its members remain as students rather than to be prosecuted for sedition would seem difficult to explain. Bear in mind however, that this is a university that allowed an Arab student Fares Saur, a member of a terrorist group that planted a bomb in the school cafeteria, to continue his studies after finishing his jail sentence. The school explained that the criterion for acceptance to the university was purely academic.\n\nIn its publication Tachadi for December 1978 the PNM wrote of its opposition to \"any settlement with recognition of the Zionist entity in any part of Palestine.\" The student author called for a war \"beginning with leaflets and demonstrations and concluding with armed military struggle.\" Above all, the PNM made this point crystal-clear: \"The struggle is not limited to the 'occupied territories.' We must widen it to all parts of the Arab motherland.\"\n\nThe PNM, running for control of the Arab student body, had distributed literature outlining its program and goals in which they demanded that \"the right of national self-determination for the Palestinian people also included the masses in [Israel's] Galilee and the Triangle.\" And so in January 1979 several Arab students distributed a pamphlet calling for support of the PLO and the disappearance of the \"Zionist entity.\" Moreover, some Arabs fired off a cable to the Damascus meeting of the Palestine National Council to voice their support of the PLO's struggle against the ever-present \"Zionist entity.\"\n\nA furor arose in Israel; more \"shock\", more demands for expulsion of all PLO-supporting students from the school. The universities did nothing, but tough General Avigdor Ben-Gal issued \"stay-at-home\" orders to six of the students. The orders kept them limited to their villages and were to be in effect for three months  enough time to make them heroes and thus allow them to return and continue their incitement.\n\nThe six came from six different Israeli villages: Tamra, Araba, Kfar Yasif, Musmus, Sandala, and Umm al-Fahm. It is instructive to look at two of the students so that we may get a clear picture of the insanity of the Israeli policy, as reported by Yosef Valter in Maariv (February 16, 1979).\n\nMasoud A'jabria, twenty-four, is completing his M.A. at Hebrew University in international relations while going to law school. Besides Masoud, there is his brother, Sa'id, learning chemistry at the Mizrachi-religious-sponsored Bar-Ilan University; a sister, studying at a teacher's seminar in Hadar Am, and five younger brothers and sisters are attending high school. Naturally, someday they will go on to university. Yosef Valter visited the family and reported: \"from a brief conversation you find that all of them think and speak like Masoud, the older brother.\" That is a starkly frightening sentence when one remembers that Masoud A'jabria said: \"In order to achieve a Palestinian revolution we must shed rivers of blood.\"\n\nJamal Mahajana, twenty-one, comes from Umm al-Fahm. Mahajana is products of the integration Israeli myopics teach. He studied in the mostly Jewish Afula high school and says, \"I was not discriminated against.\" And so, having received the same education his Zionist neighbors received, and having been accepted into Hebrew University while 50,000 poor Sephardic Jews remain outside, Mahajana says in his telegram to the PLO in Damascus: \"We emphasized that we are Palestinian Arabs living in the State of Israel and, like others, we claim that the PLO is the sole representative of the Palestinian people... The Zionist regime is an oppressive regime...\"\n\nThe total lack of any coherent and consistent policy on the part of Israel toward the Arabs was seen two weeks later, when the National Arab Student Union announced that it, too, saw the PLO as the exclusive leader of the Palestinian people. No one was arrested, no one placed under house arrest. Little wonder that in the year that followed Arab boldness increased.\n\nArab students held an unauthorized demonstration at Hebrew University in November 1979 to protest the planned expulsion of Shechem's PLO mayor Bassam Shaka. The Arabs shouted, \"We are all Arafat,\" and \"The state is ours,\" a fight broke out involving chains, rocks, and knives. Three Jewish students were injured. A Jewish student group was formed called Students Who Are Disgusted.\n\nAt Haifa University, on May 4, 1980, 50 Arab students marched through school buildings, disrupting classes and shouting against \"Israeli fascism.\" Three days later a swastika and the words \"Death to the Jews\" were painted on doors at Haifa's Technion.\n\nAt Haifa University, the Arab students published a paper called Bian, in which, among other things, they said: \"We are an indivisible part of the Palestine Arab people and the PLO is our sole legal representative...Zionism is a racist, colonialist movement...\"\n\nThe young Arabs of Israel. The fathers are dying. The sons remain, and they will have sons and daughters-many. The young, educated, modern Arab. The Golem of Israel, created by Jews who believed that by caring for his body and expanding his mind, they would lead the Arab to accept being a permanent minority in a Jewish state.\n\nIf examples of Israeli blindness were not so prevalent, no one would believe them. But consider:\n\n\"In January 1979 Knesset Education Committee chairman Ora Namir paid a well-publicized visit to the schools of Umm al-Fahm, one of the centers of Israeli Arab hate. Passing a wall on which had been painted \"Long live Fatah,\" she told the Arabs that \"we are committed to doing everything we can to make Arab schools equal to Jewish schools,\" despite a government decision to freeze and cut spending levels for Jews.\"\n\nAnd then Mrs. Namir, a Knesset member and a leader in Israel, said: \"The fact that you do not have enough latrines in the schools is, for me, even more tragic than not enough classrooms. You will have the budget. But you will have to promise me that the latrines will be first.\"\n\nNot by latrines does an Arab live, and he will never trade his national passions for them. The latrines we give him he will take. But the education he receives from Israel he will use to bring closer that day when Jews will be a minority and he can generously offer them the latrines.\n\n[We can see that the power that the Arabs have today, was a long-time in the making. bg]\n\n<\n\nI have been waiting for a peg on which to hang additional information about the Quakers (Friends) and their bitter anti-Israel activities for a long time. Now Alan Dershowitz has given me that news peg. Please read the attached story, especially the last paragraph. Highly enlightening.\n\nOne of the best kept secrets about anti-Israel and anti-Semitic activity in the U.S.Congress concerns the Quakers, who have this carefully created and polished image of peaceful, gentle people who are only interested in humanitarian causes, and uninvolved in power politics.. When I first came to work on Capitol Hill in Washington, there were virtually no anti-Israel, anti-Semitic elements who could claim respectability and dare to lobby Congress. It was a given that just about everyone was pro-Israel. Memories of the Holocaust were quite vivid in the middle sixties. Until...\n\nUntil I was approached in my Senate staff job by a lobbyist for the American Friends Service Committee; the name the Quaker lobby works under. To my amazement, as the man presented his case, instead of a plea for refugees in Africa or famine relief, he was smilingly and quietly condemning Israel and its policies towards the Arabs. Fascinated, I listened to his presentation and then asked a number of probing questions. Gradually the picture filled out, and I realized that this man and his colleagues...his office and his church...were hard left advocates for the Palestinians and the Arab cause. They indicated that Israel should never have been created.\n\nThey offered virtually no critiques of Arab dictatorships. It was all Israel's fault, they argued, and if Israel made concessions (which would have been fatal ones), all would be well and peace would prevail.\n\nAfterward, I queried some of the elder representatives of Jewish organizations, who affirmed my suspicions. Amazed, I asked why they did not spread the word, only to be told that I should not make noise about this and that the Friends made common cause with other Jewish and human rights groups in other areas of common political concern. Make no mistake. The Quakers are on Capitol Hill daily, spreading the worst kind of anti-Israel criticism and never being publicized as to what they are doing. One of the reasons several mainline Protestant denominations have come to echo their anti-Israel criticism and lobbying is because the Quakers have been missionaries for the Pelestinians to other liberal, faith-based groups in Washington.\n\nOver the years, whenever I mentioned what the Quakers were doing to Jewish people/friends of Israel, they uniformly expressed amazement and total ignorance of the situation. Almost all the Jewish people I have known over the years have been flabbergasted by receipt of this information. The Friends are very careful not to let it be widely known as to what they are doing.\n\nMajor Jewish lobbying organizations in Washington refuse to \"out\" this situation and inform the greater national Jewish community about this state of affairs. People need to ask why, starting with Reform Judaism's Religious Action Center in Washington, which, to the best of my knowledge, knows all about this and has never uttered a peep to inform its constituency. Rabbi David Saperstein has headed that office for many years. Surely he knows. B'nai B'rith surely must know...and AJC.\n\nDershowitz has done the friends of Israel and the American Jewish community at large a signal public service by opening this dirty little closet, and it is my hope that all who receive this will spread the word. Take a few moments and pass it on. Start asking questions.It is impossible for anyone to deny that this is what they believe, this is what they are doing, and that it has been going on since the 1960's. Comments are welcome. Spread the word and just watch the reaction you get.\n\nFranklin Silbey\n\nFrom: alanbergreen@sbcglobal.net\n\nRemember all the pretentious mileage the Friends Service Committee got during the Vietnam era by posturing as \"witnesses\" for peace (and all the misty-eyed anti-war-niks who lapped it all up)?\n\nI recall George Orwell had some trenchant remarks to make during WWII about the objective effects of pacifists vis a vis the Nazi war effort (they helped it).\n\nNow it appears the Quakers have abandoned any equivocation as to which side they're on. Well, nothing like clarity!!\n\n A.B.\n\nFriends Seminary plays bait, switch on anti-Semitism\n\nBy Alan M. Dershowitz 02/24/2012 00:42\n\nFriends Seminary of New York backed out of an agreement to invite Alan Dershowitz to talk to students about the evils of anti-Semitism.\n\nThe Friends Seminary of New York, which invited the notorious anti-Semite Gilad Atzmon to one of its classes, and assigned its students to read his hate-filled writings, has now backed out of an agreement to invite me to the school to talk to the students about the evils of anti-Semitism.\n\nThe headmaster of the Friends Seminary, a school which is supposed to be committed to honesty and integrity, has broken his solemn promise to me, and to members of its own community, to allow its students to hear both sides of an issue that really has only one side: namely, the illegitimacy of bringing hate-mongers into high school classrooms.\n\nAfter I exposed the original invitations to Atzmon  who justifies the burning down of synagogues as \"reasonable\" response to Jewish efforts to \"control the world\"  the headmaster agreed to several things.\n\nFirst, he would speak at an assembly to the students about the evils of anti-Semitism; second, he would assign my essay to the students who were assigned Atzmon's essay; and third, he would invite me to address the students. He has now broken each of these promises.\n\nStudents who were at the assembly have confirmed that the speakers only made things worse. The teacher who invited Atzmon talked about what a great musician he was. The headmaster was defensive about how his words were manipulated and justified bringing Atzmon based on Quaker principles.\n\nApparently the word \"anti-Semitism\" was never once mentioned during this meeting. My article was not assigned to the students; a citation was sent to them saying that I wanted students to read it.\n\nWhen I wrote to the headmaster complaining about these breaches, they used my letter as an excuse for canceling my appearance. The real reason was almost certainly pressure from hard-left members of his faculty and others.\n\nLet's be clear what this means. The school was unwilling to cancel Atzmon's appearance, even after learning that he was a virulent anti-Semite who questions the Holocaust but believes that it may be true that Jews kill Christians to use their blood for religious purposes. But they canceled my appearance because they didn't like the tone of a private letter that I wrote to them that was critical of the headmaster's failure to comply with his promises. I ended my letter with the following words: \"Please assure me that I am wrong about my judgment about you. I really would like to see this move forward in a positive direction, but you are not helping.\n\n\"The ultimate sufferers are your students, who are being taught the wrong values that will serve them poorly in college and in life.\"\n\nThe values that Headmaster Bo Lauder is imbuing to his students are deception, breach of promise, toleration of anti-Semitism and an unwillingness to present all sides of an issue. In the end, the headmaster is showing tremendous distrust of his students by refusing to allow them to hear another side of the issue, by canceling my promised appearance, by not assigning my essay and by continuing to be defensive regarding the dreadful mistake in judgment he made in allowing Atzmon to teach his students.\n\nThe headmaster may believe that by breaking his promises, he has ended this issue. Let him be absolute certain that, as I wrote in my letter to him: \"This issue will not go away, and nor will I. Misled once, shame on you. Misled twice, shame on me.\"\n\nUnless I am invited to address the students inside the school, I will appear outside the school, where I will hand out my essays to those students who are willing to read them and will address those students who have an interest in hearing a response to anti-Semitism. I am also considering inviting parents, students and other members of the Friends Seminary community to an event, in a venue outside the school, where these issues can be discussed openly and candidly.\n\nHeadmaster Lauder may be able to keep me physically out of his school, but he will not be able to stop my ideas from reaching his community. The truth does not respect artificial boundaries.\n\nThe Friends Seminary, like other elite schools around the United States, teaches our future leaders. Many Friends Schools around the country have espoused strongly anti-Israel policies for years. The Friends Seminary in New York has a rabidly anti-Israel history teacher on its faculty, who propagandizes his students against Israel in the classroom, and who has a picture of Anne Frank wearing a Palestinian headdress on his website. The school has and is again planning to take its students on trips to the Middle East that present a one-sided perspective. Now it has crossed the line from preaching anti-Zionism to tolerating anti-Semitism. I will not remain silent in the face of the Friends Seminary's double standard and neither should you.\n\nThe End of Arab Palestine\n\nby Michael Freund\n\nI never thought I would say this, but those of us on the Israeli Right owe a debt of gratitude to Mahmoud Abbas. By forging a unity agreement with Hamas earlier this month in Doha, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority president has inadvertently corroborated one of the central tenets of our political philosophy: the Palestinians cannot and must not be granted a state.\n\nEver since the signing of the Oslo Accords in September 1993, we have warned against the establishment of a Palestinian entity alongside Israel... Repeatedly, we have pleaded with the public to recognise the dangers inherent in dividing the land of Israel and placing the heart of the country within our foes' artillery range. Time after time, we have insisted that an independent Palestine would be swept up by the rising tide of Islamic fundamentalism and become an outpost for Iranian-style extremism.\n\nIt has often been an uphill battle, as much of the media and the international community has prodded and pressed to give the Palestinians a state of their own, seemingly without regard for the consequences.\n\nBut earlier this month, Abbas delivered decisive and irrefutable corroboration of everything the Right has been saying for nearly 20 years.\n\n...However dangerous this development might be on the ground, it does present a significant opportunity in terms of Israel's public diplomacy. Simply put, Abbas's embrace of Hamas should be used to make a strong case against the prevailing notion that a \"two-state solution\" can bring about peace.\n\nAfter all, the mirage of moderation surrounding Fatah and the Palestinian Authority is now unambiguously on display as little more than a figment of the Left's imagination.\n\nWe must make the case that this is the end of Palestine, the death knell of the delusion that the Palestinian leadership was interested in reconciliation, compromise and peace. If Abbas and his cohorts truly wished to see an end to the conflict, they would not have joined hands with those who advocate endless confrontation. By affixing his signature to the unity deal, Abbas has therefore settled the argument once and for all.\n\nFood for Thought. by Steven Shamrak\n\nIsrael is the only country where the ruling national majority, Jews, actively disallowed by their own government to take position of the properties owned by their families. After six decades of independence Israeli government is still living the life of a 'ghetto Jew' in fear of offending enemies and fake friends!\n\nJews are Almost Lynched in Jerusalem\n\nTwo Jews were travelling to Mount Scopus in Jerusalem when they accidentally made a wrong turn and ended up stuck in a traffic jam between two Arab cars a week ago. A crowd of Arab youths then showed up and began throwing rocks at them. In recent months, Arabs have attacked Jewish motorists with rocks, in what is starting to again become a common phenomenon on the roads of Judea and Samaria. (Jews are terrorised and living in fear in their own country. When will the Israeli government end this idiocy?)\n\nApology is a Pathetic Display of Defeat\n\nThe US has apologised for inappropriate treatment of religious material in Afghanistan, after hundreds of angry Afghans protested over reports that US forces burned copies of the Quran, even before investigation. Hundreds of protesters earlier besieged the Bagram airbase, about 60Km north of the capital Kabul, chanting calls of \"death to America,\" and firing slingshots and petrol bombs at the gate of the base. Preliminary information showed that Quran copies had not been burned! (Inmates used copies of the Quran for passing messages and Islamic propaganda. No protests against these acts of desecration! Christians are systematically killed and abused by Muslims. Even transit passengers in Arab countries' airport are not immune. Have you even heard an apology?)\n\nHevron Survivor Died Without Seeing His Land Returned\n\nYaakov Castel, one of the last remaining survivors of the 1929 Hevron massacre, passed away. His dream of restoring his family's home in the city remained unfulfilled. Castel survived the brutal massacre of Hevron's Jews at the hands of an Arab mob as a young child. Survivors of the massacre were expelled from Hevron by the British. When Jordan seized control of the city in 1948, their homes were given to Arab families. Castel owned a book detailing his family's rich history, which has included more than 500 years living in Gaza and then Hevron following the expulsion of Jews from Spain. At the time of the Hevron massacre the family had been in Hevron for generations.\n\nTime to Take Sinai Back\n\nThe Islamist party that leads the new Egyptian Parliament is threatening to review the 1979 peace treaty with Israel if the United States cuts off aid to the country. The Obama administration and Congressional leaders have already warned Egypt that the United States might cut off its annual aid to the country, which in the most recent budget came to $1.3 billion in military supplies and about $250 million in other subsidies. Egyptians have long considered American aid as a kind of payment for preserving the peace despite the popular resentment of Israel.\n\nUN is not in Rush to Condemn Iran\n\nThree Iranians detained after accidentally setting off explosives in Bangkok. Citing the similarity of bombs used in New Delhi and Tbilisi, national police chief Gen. Prewpan Dhamapong said that Thai authorities now \"know for certain that (the target) was Israeli diplomats.\" Israel's UN ambassador said the Security Council should condemn the attacks quickly. (The UN is too busy to adopt pro-Islamic, anti-Syrian resolutions)\n\nNuclear Iran: Words and Action\n\nTehran hardened its nuclear and military policies in defiance of tougher sanctions and ahead of international nuclear talks. The threat by Iran's armed forces deputy chief Gen. Mohammad Hejazi of a preemptive strike against its \"enemies,\" was accompanied by its refusal to allow UN nuclear watchdog inspectors to visit the Parchin facility. Western and Israeli intelligence experts have concluded that the transfer of 20 percent uranium enrichment to the underground Fordo site near Qom has shortened Iran's race for the 90 percent (weapons) grade product to six weeks.\n\nProtect Us or We'll Protect Ourselves\n\nAttacks by Arabs on Israeli drivers have been on the rise since last year. At least three Jewish women were the victims of violent carjackings in the last seven days alone. Each of the women was forced off the road when it was blocked by armed PA Arabs, then dragged roughly from her vehicle by the attackers and thrown down on the road, while they made off with her car. Dozens of residents of the Shomron town of Kedumim responded by blocking PA drivers from merging onto Route 55. \"We expect the army and police to focus on preventing these kind of incidents.\" \" If they do not,\" protesters added, \"we know how to defend ourselves.\"\n\nQuote of the Week:\n\n\"As long as Nazi violence was unleashed only, or mainly, against the Jews, the rest of the world looked on passively and even treaties and agreements were made with the patently criminal government of the Third Reich... The doors of Palestine were closed to Jewish immigrants, and no country could be found that would admit those forsaken people. They were left to perish like their brothers and sisters in the occupied countries...\"  Albert Einstein\n\nBoy May Never have been Shot in the First Place\n\nJamal al-Dura, whose 12-year-old son Muhammad was purportedly killed in 2000 in an exchange of fire between Israeli and Palestinian forces in Gaza and who became a symbol of the Second Intifada. sued French-Israeli Dr. Yehuda David for libel, and ultimately lost...\n\nAt the start of the Palestinian uprising in 2000, a French television network broadcast a minute-long clip of the boy purportedly being shot in an exchange of fire between Israelis and Palestinians in central Gaza. The voiceover indicated that the boy was killed by Israeli soldiers, but an investigation later suggested that Palestinian fire had killed him. Many others claimed the entire event was staged and the boy was never shot in the first place. In an effort to bolster his claim that Israelis had killed his son, Jamal al-Dura, the boy's father, presented his own bullet scars, which he claimed were sustained during that same incident. But Dr. Yehuda David refuted al-Dura's claim, saying he himself had operated on al-Dura in 1992, eight years before the incident, and al-Dura already had been scarred then (allegedly as a result of Hamas attacking him over suspicions he had cooperated with Israel)...\n\nDavid said that he believed that the damage caused by those famous images of 12-year-old al-Dura supposedly being shot as his father holds him can be repaired, despite the global storm surrounding the incident. \"There is always room for repair,\" he said. \"Someone once told me something that I think is true: The Dreyfus trial wouldn't have been remembered if he had lost on appeal. It is remembered because he won. That's how this will be. With this victory we have turned over a new leaf in public diplomacy with the Palestinians\"...\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated David, saying \"You are a shining example of Israel's battle for truth and of our nation's confidence in our righteous path. You have done the people of Israel a great service.\" (Several years ago I was confidentially told that Israel's government knew that Muhammad al-Dura was alive and living with his relatives. The government of Israel needs to start fighting the anti-Israel propaganda war in order to lift the moral of Jewish people and their belief in reunification of the Jewish national homeland, Eretz-Israel!)\n\nNote: Three senior French journalists who saw the raw footage in 2004 said it was not clear from the footage alone that the boy had died, and that France 2 cut a final few seconds in which he appeared to lift his hand from his face. France 2's news editor said in 2005 that no one could say for sure who fired the shots, but other commentators, including the director of the Israeli government press office, went further, saying the scene had been staged by Palestinian protesters.\n\nFrom Sunday 26th to Monday 27th February, 2012, the Palestinian Authority (PA) Chairman, Mahmoud Abbas-Abu Mazen and his delegation participated in 'The International Conference for the Defence of Jerusalem' that took place in Doha, the capital of the State of Qatar.\n\nThe Conference was held under the auspices and attendance of Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar, and attended by General Dr. Nabil Al Arabi, the Arab League Secretary, Arab foreign ministers, heads of international and regional organizations and bodies, organizations and federations advocating human rights, clerics, as well as intellectuals, legal, political and history figures. All the participants gathered to express solidarity with the Arab-Palestinian people in the city of Jerusalem and their claim to have legitimate rights in the city.\n\nThe Conference was held under the slogan \"support the steadfastness of Jerusalem.\"\n\nOn Sunday evening, Abbas-Abu Mazen, the Fatah and PLO leader, delivered a speech that attempted to deny the ancient Jewish roots of Jerusalem. Abbas had the Chutzpah and ruse to tell the Arab leaders that the Israeli occupation authorities are using the ugliest and most dangerous means to implement plans to erase and remove the Arab-Islamic and the Christian character of east Jerusalem. In 1967, shortly after the Six Day War, Moshe Dayan, at that time the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel, ordered the Israeli flag to be removed from Har-Habayit-Temple Mount, and handed over administrative control, effectively gave over the keys, of Temple Mount, to the Waqf, the Supreme Moslem Council and an Islamic Trust.\n\nThe truth to be said is that, since the Waqf was entrusted with the keys to Har-Habayit-Temple Mount, the Waqf's authorities have been doing all they can to remove any and all evidence, and there are mountains of them, that the First and Second Jewish temples stood where the al-Aqsa Mosque now stands, thus attempting to remove any and all evidence that Har-Habayit-Temple Mount belongs to the Jews from time immemorial. In April 637 CE, the Caliph Umar traveled to Jerusalem, in person, to receive the submission of the city to the Moslem conquerors. In 705 CE, the Moslem conquerors built the Al-Aqsa Mosque, as a statement of conquest.\n\nAbu Mazen went on to state that visiting \"occupied Jerusalem\" was the goal of every Muslim, Arab and Christian, \"forgetting\" to mention that only since the Israeli authorities took control of Jerusalem, the whole, all religions' worshippers are welcome to the city to worship. He also \"omitted\" that in 1948, the Arabs expelled all the Jews from Jerusalem, thus made the city Judenrein-cleansed of Jews, and they desecrated all the Jewish sites, synagogues and cemeteries in the city. From 1948 to 1967, Jews were not allowed to enter the city that was under the control of the Jordanian government and were denied worshipping their holy sites there.\n\nThe world needs to acknowledge and be proud that Jerusalem, under Israeli sovereignty, has been and will continue to be open to believers of all faiths. Israel allows freedom of worship for all, which was lacking when Jordan was in control of Jerusalem, and Israel will continue to carefully respect and maintain the holy places of all religions.\n\nAbu Mazen carried on and accused Israel of surrounding Jerusalem with \"an apartheid wall and a band of settlements in order to isolate the city from its surroundings in the West Bank.\" He however, \"forgot\" to mention, that Arab jihad and intifada forced Israel to build a separation wall to protect its innocent civilians from the ongoing onslaught of Arabs' murderous intentions. As for apartheid, Abbas has no idea what is the real meaning of the term Apartheid. In South Africa, where the Apartheid system was invented, the system separated the black people from the white people and it treated the black people as second class citizens. All the black people wanted was to abolish the Apartheid polity and gain equality in their citizenship, which finally took place in 1974. The black people in South Africa did not strap themselves with explosives and blew themselves up in the midst of white civilians' gathering. They did not wish the genocide of the white man. In Israel, the Arabs, who hold an Israeli citizenship, are equal citizens to the Jewish citizens. We do however hope that the Arabs living under the control of the Abu-Mazen-PA gang enjoy the same human rights as the Arabs, holding an Israeli citizenship enjoy. So where is the Apartheid Mr. liar Abu-Mazen?\n\nIn his speech Abbas alleged that Israel had made it \"almost impossible to obtain\" permits for PA Arabs to enter Jerusalem, forgetting to state that each day thousand PA-Arabs enter Jerusalem, weather for religious purposes, personal or commerce.\n\nAs part of their war to end the existence of the Jewish State of Israel, the Arab-Moslems, the archenemy of the Jewish state, simply omit Jewish history facts and deny the connection of Jews to the Land of Israel as a whole. The Arabs deny the fact that since King David declared Jerusalem the capital of his kingdom, for thousands of years, thereafter, Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the Jewish People and no other people.\n\nIn his speech, the host of the Jerusalem Conference, Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani called on the UN to investigate the 'Judaization' of Jerusalem. The term 'Judaization' is often used by the Arabs in order to demean the Jewish character of Jerusalem and as one of the anti-Semitic terms they often used against Israel.\n\nIn response to Abu-Mazen poisonous rhetoric, the Prime Minister of Israel, Binyamin Netanyahu had accused Abu Mazen-Abbas that he knows well that there is no foundation to his contemptible remarks, including his baseless and irresponsible claims regarding the al-Aqsa Mosque. Netanyahu said that the citizenry of the state of Israel expect from the one who supposedly champions peace, to prepare his people for peace and coexistence and not disseminate lies and incitement. \"This is not how one makes peace,\" Netanyahu hollered, and told Abbas that the time has come for the Palestinian leadership to stop denying the State of Israel Jewish past and distorting reality. It is worthwhile noting here that Abbas belongs to the Holocaust deniers' camp.\n\nThough Prime Minister Netanyahu replied to Abu-Mazen with fiery words, he was wrong. Abu Mazen's speech is entirely consonant with the Oslo \"peace\" process. In the context of Israel and the Arabs, the world has adopted the Arabs' definition of \"peace,\" which means, the destruction of the state of Israel. This process inscribes the death of the state of Israel by a thousand cuts. Anything that tends to reduce Israel, dismember Israel, demonize, delegitimize and demoralize Israel, or defeats Israel outright, is therefore a positive part of the Oslo \"peace process.\" Anything that strengthens Israel is an \"obstacle to peace.\"\n\nThat is why the world is outraged by every Jewish home built in land that the entire world recognized, in 1922, as the Jewish homeland but was illegally conquered and occupied, by Jordan, for 19 years. Same \"righteous\" world could not care less about Jews murdered by terrorists. For this peace seeking world, Jewish blood is Hefker- of no value and consequence. That is why the security wall is an \"obstacle to peace\" but Arab terrorist atrocities against Jews are not. Killing Jews is making \"peace.\" Preventing it is an \"obstacle to peace.\"\n\nThe Israeli leadership must stop whining about \"no way to make peace\" and deal with the Orwellian meaning that it has been invested with. \"Peace process\" is today's exact counterpart of \"Arbeit macht frei. The slogan arbeit macht frei, is the German phrase that was posted at the entrance of some of the Nazi Concentration Camps, during the Holocaust of WWII, in which 6 million Jews were murdered by the Nazi killing machine. This includes the most infamous Camp, Auschwitz, where the slogan was posted on the camp's entrance metal arch that was made by prisoners with metalwork skills and erected by order of the Nazis in June 1940.\n\nThe slogan' arbeit macht frei' literally means work makes (one) free, or, work sets you free, or work liberates you. However, the slogan was a deceiving facade for the Jews, the Nazis gathered from all parts of Europe and shipped, in cattle cars to these Camps, to believe they are entering a labor camp, not a death camp. Just like 'arbeit macht frei' camp was nothing more than for a factory of death to all Jews, the Oslo \"Peace process\" is a facade, its real statement is to kill all the Jews and destroy the state of Israel.\n\nDeal with it.\n\nNatan Sharansky, the former Soviet Jewish Refusenik and prisoner, an Israeli politician, human rights activist and author once said:\n\nWhen do attacks on a country become anti-Semitic? When the 3D's appear:\n\nDelegitimize the country,\n\nDouble standard is applied when dealing with the country,\n\nDemonize the country.\n\nIt is obvious that the Palestinian Authority (PA) Chairman Mahmoud Abbas-Abu Mazen and his cohorts at the 'The International Conference for the Defence of Jerusalem' apply to and practice the 3D's toward the State of Israel.\n\nDeal with this one too.\n\n---\n\nMr. Golbert contributed to this article\n\nThere is no leader with a record that matches that of Prime Minister Netanyahu with regard to recognition of the dangers of Iran. He was addressing this issue in various forums  again, and again, and again  at a time when most world leaders were paying no attention.\n\nSource: Inquisitr\n\nAnd there is no question in my mind that he understands what must be done. Sanctions  instituted late and half-heartedly  have not deterred Iranian leaders. \"Negotiations\" are nothing but a pitiful joke. But Iran cannot be permitted to achieve nuclear capability.\n\nThis week Netanyahu is scheduled to travel to North America, and, on March 5, will be meeting President Obama  who does not exactly see eye-to-eye with him on this issue. For all the public declarations by US officials meant to assuage concern and demonstrate that the US and Israel are on the same wavelength regarding Iran, it is clearly is not the case. The US does not want Israel to attack Iran.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJust how far apart on Iran the US and Israel appear to be is demonstrated by an article in Israel Hayom today. A \"deeply troubling\" International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) quarterly report released on Friday indicated \"Iran had increased the pace of its uranium enrichment program in recent months at the Natanz facility in central Iran and the Fordo underground facility near the ancient holy city of Qom.\"\n\nIn response to this, the prime minister's office released a statement:\n\n\"The IAEA report provides more proof that Israel's estimations were accurate. Iran is continuing with its nuclear program unchecked and is enriching uranium to a high level of 20 percent while blatantly ignoring the demands of the international community.\"\n\nThis sheds light, at one and the same time, on what Iran is doing and the failure of the community to stop it.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHowever, \"according to US media reports over the weekend, US intelligence officials stated that there is no definitive proof that Iran has decided to build a nuclear weapon.\" On January 19, at a press conference in the Netherlands, Netanyahu stated unequivocally that Iran had already decided to build a bomb. But in any event this intelligence statement is meaningless: For it has been explained repeatedly that the concern is that Iran will develop the capacity to build a bomb, such that it will be able to do so in six months to a year once that decision is made. And evidence makes it quite clear that the capacity is being developed  Iran has gone well beyond anything that would be needed for peaceful purposes. This US intelligence statement feels like an attempt to downplay the danger. And the Secretary of State? In a statement to Reuters TV from Tunisia, she offered one of her classic observations that tends to make you want to bang your head against the nearest wall: \"We continue to urge Iran to abide by its international obligations, and that is something that countries everywhere do, and we want to see them do it, and we hope that they will be listening.\" http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=3266 No wonder the Iranians think they can proceed with impunity.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAs much as Netanyahu is to be given credit for his clear-eyed position on Iran, however, he also has a reputation for caving under pressure from the US. (Consider, for example, the 10 month freeze he imposed on building in Judea and Samaria.) And there is no doubt that Obama will apply every possible pressure when they meet. To date, Netanyahu has given no indication of caving, and it may well be that this existential issue is a genuine red line for him. He has made public statements in response to international pressure  \"stop telling us what to do,\" etc.  that are encouraging. And his most recent release today is in line with the others. Nevertheless, the situation is worrisome.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFor this reason, I ask every one of you on this list who agrees that Israel has a right to defend herself as her leaders see fit  without interference from the US  to please write to Prime Minister Netanyahu now. A short, succinct and positive message, please. Something like this, in your own words:\n\nYou are to be congratulated for recognizing the dangers of Iran as other world leaders have not. It is clear that you understand that Iran cannot be permitted to become a nuclear power. I implore you, do not let President Obama pressure you or dissuade you from your path.\n\nIf you are Israeli, tell him you count on him, as your prime minister, to keep this nation safe. If you are American, tell him that you do not agree with the position of your president.\n\nE-mail: Memshala@pmo.gov.il and also pm_eng2@it.pmo.gov.il (underscore after pm) use both addresses\n\nFax: 02-670-5369 (From the US: 011-972-2-670-5369)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAs I have mentioned before, the question of timing of an attack is critical  and there is disagreement between Israel and the US regarding how long it is possible to wait before attacking. Obama and Netanyahu will likely focus on precisely this issue.\n\nThe US maintains that sanctions can work but need more time. On this see Dore Gold, who says precedents of other nations against whom sanctions were levied indicate that it would take some nine to 12 years in the case of Iran, while it is predicted that Iran will be nuclear in somewhere between several months and two years.\n\nhttp://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_opinion.php?id=1389\n\nIsrael sees a closing window of opportunity for attack because Iranian nuclear facilities are in the process of being hidden deeper underground in very highly fortified bunkers, which will make it more difficult to hit them.\n\nTotally aside from military considerations, there are peripheral political issues in play, and they should not be discounted either.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFrom YNet, we have this:\n\n\"...the prime minister's associates are engaging in contacts vis-à-vis the White House, aimed at drafting a joint Israeli-American declaration on Iran, to be issued in the wake of the Obama-Netanyahu meeting.\" This is particularly important to the US in order to demonstrate that the two nations are on the same page.\n\nNetanyahu, says this report, is seeking a commitment from the US to \"further tighten sanctions,\" which the Americans are considering. If the goal is to stop Iran without resorting to military action, it would seem to me that this should be a given. But the US, reportedly, would do this only as quid pro quo: the Obama administration wants a commitment from Israel not to strike Iran in the \"near future\" (however this is defined).\n\nPlease keep in mind that whatever reports such as this indicate, we will not actually know what goes on in discussion between Netanyahu and Obama. Only they and a very small cadre of insiders will know. We simply cannot predict how this will play out. As unlikely as it seems to many observers here, it is possible, for example (and this is purely speculative), that Obama will tell Netanyahu that if he waits absolutely as long as possible to give sanctions a chance, and it then becomes necessary for Iran to be attacked anyway, the US will provide back-up and additional weaponry for Israel.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNetanyahu has apparently ordered his ministers to deliver no public statements about Iran prior to his visit to the US. This is absolutely as it should be. There has been entirely too much talk already at official levels.\n\nThe prime minister has also temporarily halted all construction beyond the Green Line so as to not risk incurring the anger of the US while he is the midst of sensitive discussions.\n\nSee: http://imra.org.il/story.php3?id=55849\n\nThat the situation should be this tenuous is regrettable: we have a right to do this building. But, if the halt is truly temporary, I would say that it is understandable, in light of the weight of the issues to be discussed in Washington.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBefore moving on, I want to clarify one additional point:\n\nThose Americans who are opposed to an attack on Iran not infrequently voice concern that America is about to be involved in an extensive ground war in Iran  something that would not be sustainable in light of similar recent US experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nBut this is simply not the case.\n\nNo one is suggesting that Iran be conquered and its regime overthrown! No one wants to go looking for the mullahs in hiding or the Revolutionary Guard leadership. That, indeed, would require ground troops battling for a lengthy period. All that is envisioned is a massive bombing operation that would take out key nuclear installations and, most likely, other military installations (launching sites, communications centers, whatever) to prevent a major Iranian response. What had to be done would be accomplished by planes and missiles.\n\nNor is there reason to think that the US would have to send troops into Iran to deal with any possible response from Iran. Simply not the case.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHere I want to call the attention of my readers to an article by Lenny Ben David, \"Syria's Arsenal of Unconventional Weapons Must Be Destroyed\":\n\n\"Public reports claim that Syria has hundreds of long-range Scud B, C and D (the Korean No-Dong) missiles, and dozens of launchers  - one of the largest ballistic missile forces in the Middle East, according to the CIA. Some of the missiles are equipped with cluster-bomb warheads suitable for dispersion of chemical weapons. The reports list the bases where the missiles are stored as well as those bases where chemical and biological weaponization is carried out. Indeed, some of the chemical warfare activity is done in cooperation with Iran, which provides training and the equipment. (Emphasis added)\n\n\"A CIA study released in 2010 stated, 'Syria has had a CW [chemical weapons] program for many years and already has a stockpile of CW agents, which can be delivered by aircraft, ballistic missiles and artillery rockets.'\n\n\"Persistent reports over the last decade suggest that Saddam Hussein smuggled elements of his WMD programs to Syria before he fell.\"\n\nThe major concern, Ben David explains, is that in the current climate of extreme instability in Syria these weapons might fall into the hands of terrorists.\n\n\"...In Libya, the controlled destruction of WMD and missiles was conducted with Qaddafi's reluctant cooperation. In Syria, the destruction of the stockpiles will only occur if they are obliterated and incinerated by Western missiles, warplanes, and cruise missiles. The blowing up of mustard and nerve gas stocks may result in local 'collateral damage,' but the outcome would be far less than a container of Sarin being sprayed in the Washington Metro, VX dropped from a London office building, or an Igla shoulder-fired missile bringing down a passenger plane near Heathrow. (Emphasis added)\n\n\"More importantly, the destruction of Assad's WMD and missile arsenal, which today threaten Turkey, Israel and ships in the eastern Mediterranean, would be a powerful signal to the ayatollah regime in Iran to 'cease and desist' its nuclear weaponization program. It would be proof that indeed 'all options are on the table' — including wiping Syria's table clean.\"\n\nhttp://blogs.timesofisrael.com/syrias-arsenal-of- unconventional-weapons-must-be-destroyed/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI believe this to be a proposal with genuine merit, which requires traction. As you are able, please share this with your Congresspersons and others in government.\n\nLenny Ben-David, now a public affairs consultant, served as deputy chief of mission of Israel's embassy in Washington.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBriefly...\n\n-- Last week, a bomb, which had been hidden in a bag and thrown over the border from the Sinai to southern Israel, was intercepted. There seems little doubt that this bomb, which was to be remote activated, was intended to be picked up and utilized for a major terror attack in a mall, bus, or other site. When it was detonated, shrapnel flew from its interior, indicating how serious was the intent to do injury.\n\n-- The Hamas-Fatah \"unity\" is on hold, with each side accusing the other of being the stumbling block. Not a huge surprise, but a bit of a disappointment, truth to tell. If Fatah does not \"merge\" with Hamas we're going to be pushed, once again, to sit at the table with Abbas and to make \"gestures\" to him. People will conveniently forget that Abbas was willing to join forces with Islamist terrorists.\n\n-- In Haifa on Friday night, two off-duty soldiers in civilian dress were brutally attacked by a group of Israeli Arabs, at least one of whom was drunk. The attack took place near the entrance to Rambam Medical Center, where they had gone because one of them was ill. There was no provocation. \"Are you Jews?\" they were asked, before being attacked by clubs, rocks and planks of wood. They have both been hospitalized, one with spinal injuries and the other with head injuries. Four men have been arrested in connection with this attack, which the police call \"a very serious incident.\"\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLast night I attended a major program on Har HaZeitim (Mount of Olives), at the Great Synagogue in Jerusalem. The issues regarding Iran and Syria that I wrote about above had precedence today. I simply want to mention the program here, with a promise to devote a major part of my next posting to this subject.\n\nThe Country Just Over the Fence\n\nby Paul Theroux.\n\nA SIMPLE painted sign on a wooden board — \"To Mexico\" — was propped near the door in the fence, but it was the fence itself that fascinated me. Some masterpieces are unintentional, the result of a freakish accident or an explosive act of sheer weirdness, and the fence that divides Nogales, Ariz., from Nogales, Mexico, is one of them.\n\nIn a lifetime of crossing borders I find this pitiless fence the oddest frontier I have ever seen — more formal than the Berlin Wall, more brutal than the Great Wall of China, yet in its way just as much an example of the same folie de grandeur. Built just six months ago, this towering, seemingly endless row of vertical steel beams is so amazing in its conceit you either want to see more of it, or else run in the opposite direction — just the sort of conflicting emotions many people feel when confronted with a peculiar piece of art.\n\nYou can, of course, also go through it, which is what I wanted to do. And there was the entryway, just past J. C. Penney and Kory's clothing shop — a door in the wall at the end of hot, sunlit Morley Avenue.\n\nAfter leaving my car at a secure parking lot ($4 a day), I showed my passport to the United States border guard, who asked about my plans. Business?\n\n\"Just curiosity,\" I said. When he made a disapproving squint, I added, \"Don't you go over now and then?\"\n\n\"Never been there,\" he said.\n\n\"It's 10 feet away!\"\n\n\"I'm staying here,\" he said, his squint now suggesting that I should be doing the same.\n\nI pushed the turnstile and stepped through the narrow door — no line, no other formalities — into the state of Sonora, Mexico, where I was instantly, unmistakably in a foreign land. The roads were bumpier, the buildings vaguely distressed; I was breathing in the mingled aromas of bakeries, taco stands and risen dust.\n\nGlancing back a moment later, I could not see Arizona anymore, only the foreground of Mexico — small children kicking a ball, men in sombreros conferring under a striped awning, steaming food carts.\n\nI TREASURE border crossings, and the best of them are the ones where I've had to walk from one country to another, savoring the equality of being a pedestrian, stepping over the theoretical line that is shown on maps, from Cambodia into Vietnam, from Pakistan into India, from Turkey into the Republic of Georgia. Usually a frontier is a river — the Mekong, the Rio Grande, the Zambezi; or a mountain range — the Pyrenees, the Rwenzoris. It can also be a sudden alteration in topography, a bewildering landscape transformation — hilly Vermont flattening into Quebec. But just as often a border is a political expedient — irrational yet unremarkable — creating a seamless no man's land, just a width of earth, bounded by fences.\n\nI am nattering on about this border fence, partly because it is a visual marvel, something like a stockade, and also because, as the guard demonstrated, it calls for a decision. Do you go through, or stay home? It used to be a more casual proposition. Nogalans remember when it was a modest enclosure known as la linea, the line, when the main street between the two towns was more or less contiguous.\n\n\"We had a parade every spring,\" Nicolas Demetrio Kyriakis told me. Nicolas, from an entrepreneurial family of Greek immigrants to Mexico, is a regidor, a Nogales town counselor and one of the advisors to Nogales's mayor. \"Floats went down the street and into Nogales, Arizona. A coronation was held on a platform on la linea, and the Fiesta de Mayo Queen was crowned. Both towns celebrated.\"\n\nThat was 30 years ago. Back then Nogales, Mexico, was still a destination for servicemen from big, busy Fort Huachuca, a United States Army post about 25 miles as the crow flies to the northeast. Visitors from Tucson and beyond would pop over for a break from the routine, an opportunity to buy clay pots, sombreros, drink a world-class margarita, and visit a taqueria or sample local food. In the 1940s, cowboy films were made in the area. Hollywood actors crossed the border to eat and raise mild hell in La Caverna, a well-known club run by Nicolas's cousins.\n\nSuch was the bond of the two border towns that when the old elegant Hotel Olivia on the Mexican side caught fire in the 1960s, and the situation became desperate, water hoses were tossed over the fence by the fire brigade in Arizona to help the local bomberos put it out, an act of neighborliness that is still fondly remembered by the Nogalans.\n\nBut everyone I spoke to agreed that conditions have changed. They said that when soldiers from Huachuca stopped visiting after 9/11 and guards started asking to see passports, the influx of visitors slowed to a trickle. And there was another theme: since the emphasis across America was on scrutinizing aliens, why would anyone wish to become an alien oneself? The repeated news stories of cartels taking over didn't help: cross the Mexican border and risk dying like a dog.\n\n\"After the bombing of the World Trade Center, things went down,\" Juan Cordero, the director of the Department of Economic Development in this part of Sonora, told me. \"But it was massage parlors and bars on Canal Street, and curio shops downtown, an old-fashioned business model. Sure, we still had lots of American factories in our industrial area — thousands of people are employed there — but we have just a few tourists.\"\n\nAnd yet, here I was, a tourist, savoring the satisfaction of having eased myself into another country to enjoy the difference, with the tourist's presumption that I deserved a good time. And I had the instant gringo's assurance that my country, and my car, were just behind the tall fence at the frontera.\n\nSo what can you do with a couple of days in Nogales? Take advantage of its nearness, first of all. Buy cowboy boots, or pots, or folk art. I came away with a hand-carved set of dominoes, some silver coins and cleaner, whiter teeth.\n\nOn my first day I had a margarita at the Salon Regis. I asked the bartender about events in town. He thought a moment, then said, \"Super Bowl on Sunday.\"\n\nDinner at La Roca, which is just minutes from the fence, was pleasurable for my being in the hands of the sort of knowledgeable dark-suited old waiters that have disappeared from most of the world's restaurants. Many have worked at La Roca since it opened (its 40th anniversary was celebrated this year). These men were the stalwarts at the restaurant at my hotel too, the Hotel Fray Marcos. At La Roca I had tortilla soup and as an entrée a Mexican mélange of fresh shrimp from Guaymas on the Sonoran coast. Elsewhere in town, even the smaller places such as Leos or Zapatas offered plates of dried shredded beef known as mochomos and delicious tacos.\n\nI found the Nogalans courtly and easy to meet, grateful to have a visitor to the point where one demonstration of neighborliness was an offer of a swig of bacanora, a drink made from agave and Sonora's gift to the world of drinkable rocket fuel — stronger than tequila.\n\nIt is obvious from the empty streets of downtown Nogales that very few visitors stay the night, but I found that overnighting simplified my experience of the place. The Hotel Fray Marcos has mixed reviews but I found it excellent (my suite went for around $80). It was also conveniently near the office of Dr. Jose Saturno, who on successive days worked on my teeth — the full limpieza ($54) y blanquiamento ($250).\n\nThere have always been inexpensive dentists in Nogales, but the combination of rising health costs in the United States (and the fact that many retiree health plans don't include dental) along with the availability of cheap real estate in Nogales has created a dentistry boom here, which is expanding to include spa and other services as well.\n\nAt Laser Tech over on Obregon Street, Dr. Francisco Vazquez enlarged his dental practice a year ago to include a dermatology unit, and his wife (and mother of three), Martha Gonzales, opened a spa with treatments that included not only massage and steam baths but also \"ancient rituals\" inspired by the Aztecs, and for good measure hired Dr. Angel Minjares, whose specialties are theology and psychology, for \"assessments.\"\n\nTheir businesses are among the approximately 60 dental \"wellness\" practices here, mainly concentrated in a three-block area all within easy walking distance from the border gate. Most of the patients are American retirees nipping over for the day from Tucson or nearby Green Valley.\n\nGerd Roehrig, an older Tucson resident originally from Germany, was seeing Dr. Ernesto Quiroga about an implant. What would have cost him $4,500 in his hometown of Tucson, he said, was about a third of that in Nogales. Creating a further enticement, Dr. Quiroga recently invested $150,000 in a 3-D scanning machine for CAT scans.\n\n\"I guess Canal Street could now be called Root Canal Street,\" I said to Juan Cordero, after my treatment.\n\nHe sighed. \"People are worried, \" he said. \"They think Nogales is dangerous. You know the expression poner salsa a los tacos?\"\n\nSlather sauce on the tacos — exaggerate.\n\nTo try to get a handle on just how dangerous my visit was, I asked to meet the Secretary for Public Safety in Sonora and was introduced to Ernesto Munro Palacio, a 6-foot-3 businessman and former pitcher for the Monterrey Sultans, who, since 2009, has been responsible for security in the state.\n\n\"Prior to [2009] there was very little investment in security,\" he said. \"But within the past two years Sonora had invested $100 million in helicopters, armored cars and surveillance planes, to find the landing strips of organized crime and the marijuana farms.\"\n\nMurders are a problem all over Mexico, and they have devastated cities like Ciudad Juárez, which is a cartel battleground. But Secretary Munro said that in Nogales the murder rate has declined from 210 in 2010 to 83 in 2011 and that they are almost exclusively drug related.\n\n\"Ask your people if they know the name of one American who's been killed in Sonora,\" he said. \"No tourist has ever been killed in Nogales.\"\n\nThe State Department said that in the two years from Jan. 1, 2010, to Dec. 31, 2011, there were 21 reported homicides of American citizens in Nogales and advises that visitors to Sonora travel on main roads and only during daylight hours. Meanwhile, the Arizona governor, Jan Brewer, who earlier this month said that she should be an \"ambassador for Sonora,\" enthusiastically promotes tourism in the area. I heard even more robust testimonials about Sonora, and Nogales in particular, from the Americans I met seeking dental care, who remarked on the hospitality of the city.\n\nThe Bianchis, a retired couple from Tucson I met in a waiting room, were content. \"We come here all the time,\" Mr. Bianchi said. \"I got bridgework. And, hey, people are nice.\"\n\nNogales is a border town trying to save itself, and I think succeeding. I was struck, walking the city, by the distinct air of foreignness mingled with a pleasing ordinariness — children at play on school playgrounds, shoppers, churchgoers — the pleasures and routines of Mexico. The visible absence of travelers gives the city a greater feel of difference, as do the brightly painted houses that dot hillsides, the result of a scheme by the Nogales mayor, José Ángel Hernández Barajas, who created an Urban Image Department, which provides free paint for any who wish to spruce up their home. He has also created schools and sports programs, as well as teams of street cleaners.\n\nThe streets of Nogales are as tidy as any on the American side, and full of surprises. On my way to see the boomtown that lies beyond downtown and the dental clinics, I passed a two-story sculpture of a muscular naked youth spearing a winged reptilian figure sprawled at his feet. Officially known as \"The Defeat of Ignorance\" (\"La Derrota de la Ignorancia\"), the statue (designed by the Spanish sculptor Alfredo Just, in the late 1960s) is fondly referred to by Nogalans as mono bichi — \"the naked guy\" in a local phrase that is partly Yaqui. (Nogalans scatter their speech with Yaqui words that are incomprehensible elsewhere, like buki for child and yori blanco for white man.)\n\nI was to discover that the neighborhoods just across the fence are not representative of the town at large, which is a lesson in how to know another country: stay longer, travel deeper, overcome timidity. Tourists usually stick close to the fence, which accounts for the density of curio shops, and now the density of dental practices. But that downtown of Nogales is misleading.\n\nDRIVING a few miles south with Juan Cordero I saw how Nogales sprawled, with newly built and modern subdivisions near more modest ones, all comprising Nuevo Nogales. \"This is the main economic engine driving Nogales,\" Juan said. The majority of the 32,000 people employed in Nogales work in the Industrial Area in factories making cellphone components, semiconductors, air ducts for jumbo jets. Most of the names are familiar — Otis Elevator, Black & Decker, Chamberlain garage door openers, Rain Bird Sprinklers, General Electric, Watts Water Technologies, Flextronics, B/E Aerospace. Some companies like Kimberly-Clark and Motorola have been here since the late 1960s. The lives and working conditions of such employees are well described in William T. Vollmann's \"Imperial,\" an exhaustive account of an area that encompasses California and Mexico, which in its complexity and conflict resembles the Nogales border.\n\nThese are skilled workers. Those without education or manufacturing skills, the so-called campesinos, look elsewhere for work, and often cross the border to find it. Many who end up in the United States without papers are caught, jailed for a period, and bused to the border. This, too, is a revelation from the other side of the high fence.\n\nNogales is where they are dumped. Peg Bowden, a retired nurse, brought me to El Comedor, a shelter run by American Jesuits near the Mariposa gate just about a mile west of downtown Nogales. Ms. Bowden told me she was so shocked by the savage attack on Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson in January 2011 that she decided to do something humane: \"I needed to connect with something positive.\" She joined a group of Samaritans — \"a bunch of renegade senior citizens whose mission is to prevent deaths in the desert,\" and she volunteered at El Comedor, working a few days a week, crossing the border from Arizona.\n\nAs a trained nurse she is useful, treating bullet wounds and severe hypothermia and the effects of starvation and exposure — common among border crossers. \"Last week we had a girl who'd been lost in the desert for three days. She was 14.\"\n\nIt was another day in Nogales, another revelation for me, and by far the most melancholy. In El Comedor, 160 lost souls, most of them adults, and four small children, were seated on benches, at communal tables, eating breakfast in an open-sided shelter at the side of the road.\n\nSome had been longtime residents in the United States — Alejandro, a restaurant worker in North Carolina for 13 years, Arnulfo a carpenter for 11.\n\n\"I spent 20 years in Napa picking strawberries,\" Maria, an older woman in a long black dress, told me. \"My husband and children are there. I came to Mexico for my father's funeral.\" She was wearing her funeral dress. She couldn't return to the United States, nor did she have a home in Mexico anymore.\n\nThey were soft-spoken, humbled and hopeless. A woman in her 20s, Rosalba, had spent four days in the desert. She had blistered feet, a deep wound from a cactus thorn and a severe infection. Some had been caught making their first crossing. Others had been sent home after years in the United States.\n\nThe saddest case to me was a woman from Oaxaca. Abandoned, with no money, no prospects and no hope of making a living in Oaxaca, she left her three children in the care of her mother and crossed the border with four other women, in the hope of finding work. Somehow separated from the other women, she was found in the desert.\n\n\"It's like 'Sophie's Choice,' \" Peg Bowden said.\n\nShe accepted her fate, but I will never forget the sight of her alone at the table, a plate of food before her, eyes tightly shut, hands together uplifted in prayer.\n\nI was just a tourist. The fence, which I discovered is less than three miles long, had hidden all of this — the downtown, the factories, the restaurants, the residential subdivisions, the mall, the migrants, sad stories, happy stories.\n\nIt's there for anyone to discover, and so simple. It was as illuminating to me as any foreign travel I have taken anywhere in the world. In some ways, being so near home and taking less effort, it seemed odder, freighted with greater significance, this wider world at the end of Morley Avenue, just behind the fence.\n\nExactly 70 years ago  on February 24, 1942  19-year-old David Stoliar terrifyingly clung to bobbing debris in the Black Sea. At first he heard screams in the frigid waters but the voices died down. It eventually emerged that Stoliar was the sole survivor of the Struma, an un-seaworthy vessel chuck-full of frantic Jewish refugees.\n\nWorld War II was already in fever pitch. Against the enormity of the then-unfolding Holocaust, the loss at sea of 768 Jewish lives (103 of them babies and children) was at most blithely overlooked as a marginal annotation.\n\nMoreover, although these Jews fled the Nazis, in the pedantic literal sense they weren't executed by Third Reich henchmen.\n\nThis atrocity was the coldblooded handiwork of Great Britain (committed while it combated the Germans but remarkably without compassion for their Jewish victims), supposedly neutral Turkey (whose so-called nonalignment didn't extend to outcast Jewish refugees), by the Arabs (who were openly and unreservedly Nazism's avid collaborators and who pressured London into denying endangered Jews asylum in the Jewish homeland) and, finally, by the Russians (who targeted the immobilized sardine can that carried Jews to whom nobody would allow a toehold on terra firma).\n\nThe entire world seemed united in signaling Jews how utterly unwanted they were anywhere.\n\nSuch apathy-cum-enmity hasn't disappeared.\n\nOnly its form and context had mutated but the essence is still ultra-relevant to the Jewish state.\n\nWe're still threatened with annihilation. Nonetheless, unmistakable harangues from Tehran notwithstanding, the international community worries about an Israeli preemptive strike  not a genocidal strike against Israel.\n\nTo put it plainly, our fate today interests other nations just about as much as the fate of the Struma's Jews did back then, which (to resort to understatement) was hardly much.\n\nToday's disingenuous post-Holocaust lip-service is invariably accompanied by hand-wringing about lack of foreknowledge of Germany's fiendish plot to systematically exterminate the defenseless Jewish people (unmistakable harangues from Berlin notwithstanding).\n\nWhat sets the Struma apart and imbues it with extraordinary significance is that from December 16, 1941, until the afternoon of February 23, 1942, its ordeal was played out before the entire watching but unfeeling world. No country could deny awareness of the impending calamity and yet all countries let it happen in full view.\n\nThe Struma, then a 115-year-old Danube cattle barge, was a pitiful peanut-shell of a boat packed with nearly 800 refugees from Romania. Bound for the Land of Israel, they desperately fled Hitler's hell and the horrors of Bucharest's fascist regime.\n\nPogroms and ghastly atrocities had already sullied cities like Iasi, where thousands of Jews were assembled in the market square and mowed down with machine guns. Venerable old rabbis and Jewish community leaders were impaled on meat hooks in town centers.\n\nTHE STRUMA wasn't struck suddenly. It was slowly tortured, accentuating with demonic deliberation how disposable Jews were, just when genocide's monstrous machinery was switched into high gear. This 75-day shipboard melodrama underscored the total helplessness and humiliation of Jews without power.\n\nStruma passengers gathered in the Romanian port of Constanza on December 8, 1941. For four days, Romanian customs officials \"examined\" their belongings. In fact, they pilfered all they saw  clothing, underwear, jewelry and most important, food. The immigrants left on the perilous journey bereft of provisions and medications. But the Struma did carry 30 doctors, 10 engineers and 15 lawyers.\n\nOn December 12, the rickety vessel chugged out to sea. After four hair-raising days (instead of the routine 14 hours) the Struma unsteadily dragged itself into Istanbul Harbor. It couldn't continue. Its makeshift motor had sputtered its last. There was no fuel, food or water.\n\nSeveral passengers held valid entry visas into pre-independent Israel. All others were \"illegals.\"\n\nThe hope, though, was that once in Turkey, they'd all be allowed to proceed to their destination.\n\nAfter all, with Europe in the throes of war, thousands of Jewish immigration certificates (British Mandate permits) remained unutilized.\n\nBut the British authorities refused unequivocally.\n\nThe Arabs raged and rallied against giving haven to Jewish refugees. Eager to appease pro- Nazi Arab opinion, Britain chillingly declared that under no circumstance could the Struma's human cargo set foot in Eretz Yisrael.\n\nFurthermore, Britain pressured Turkey not to let anyone off the crippled boat at its end either.\n\nObligingly, the Turkish premier argued that \"Turkey cannot be expected to serve as a refuge or surrogate homeland for people unwanted anywhere else.\"\n\nThus hundreds were imprisoned in narrow, unventilated confines. A sign saying \"Help!\" was suspended over the Struma's side. One of the visa-holders, who after weeks was allowed ashore, described the boat as a \"floating coffin.\"\n\nThe freezing hull below reeked, but there wasn't sufficient room on deck. Refugees took turns to climb up for a breath of air. There was no sleeping space for all, no infirmary, no galley, no bathing or sanitary facilities. Minimal food rations, provided by local Jews, were smuggled aboard after enough Turkish palms were greased.\n\nAn official Jewish Agency appeal, forwarded to the British on January 19, 1942, stressed that the Struma transported refugees escaping the most tangible threat of massacre. The Mandatory authorities didn't even dignify the Jewish Agency with a reply.\n\nOn the next day, the Struma's 35th in Istanbul, the Wannsee Conference opened in suburban Berlin to formally decide on \"the final solution for the Jewish problem.\" Hitler surely hadn't overlooked this latest demonstration of utter callousness toward hapless Jews.\n\nThe British didn't bother to answer ensuing emotional Jewish Agency entreaties on January 30 and February 10. Then they acquiesced to the entry of four visa-holders, who only at this point were permitted to disembark. More news of the dreadful conditions on the Struma now came out.\n\nThe new British line was that the Struma's refugees were suspect Nazi agents because they came from enemy territory. The assertion that the Germans' most hideously persecuted victims were their tormenters' spies was labeled \"Satanic\" in embryonic Israel.\n\nIn a very long February 13 communication to the Mandatory government, the Agency noted that Britain was helping with much fanfare to resettle in the Mideast thousands of non-Jews  Greeks, Yugoslavs, Poles and Czechs  all of whom came from German-controlled areas.\n\nMore than any of them, Jews had reason to be loyal to the Allies.\n\nOn February 15, the British announced they'd make an exception in the case of Struma children aged 11 to 16. Wartime rationing was cited as the pretext for barring younger or older kids.\n\nThe Jewish Agency guaranteed maintenance for all 103 underage Struma captives. In the end no child was freed.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkey, egged on and emboldened by Britain, threatened to tow the floundering deathtrap beyond its territorial waters.\n\nThe Jewish Agency warned that \"the boat is in total state of disrepair and without life-saving equipment. Any sea-journey for this vessel cannot but end in disaster.\"\n\nThe Turkish government, however, pitilessly ordered the condemned Struma tugged out to the Black Sea. Hundreds of truncheon-wielding Turkish policemen were dispatched to the Struma on February 23. They viciously clubbed passengers below deck. Despite resistance from the refugees, the anchor was cut, the Struma was towed out and was left paralyzed, to drift precariously without supplies or a drop of fuel.\n\nOn February 24, an explosion ripped it apart.\n\nA Soviet submarine, Shchuka-213, patrolled northeast of the Bosporus. Stalking Axis craft, it torpedoed the wobbly barge, which sank in minutes. It's estimated that as many as 500 were killed outright by the blast. The rest flapped feebly in the waves, till they expired of wounds, fatigue and hypothermia. Stoliar alone hung on, semi-conscious.\n\nIn pre-state Israel there was shock and grief.\n\nDemonstrations were mounted. For one day all work and commerce were halted and the population imposed a voluntary protest curfew on itself. Posters appeared on exterior walls everywhere bearing British High Commissioner Harold MacMichael's photo and announcing that he was \"Wanted for Murder.\"\n\nThe Struma's heartrending end marked the effective end to most attempts to break Britain's anti-Jewish blockade until the conclusion of WWII. A few fishing and sporting sailboats briefly tried to ferry handfuls of refugees. Some of them were sunk. Europe's Jews had no escape left. Embattled Britain took time out from the war to make sure of it.\n\nStoliar was imprisoned by the Turks for six weeks for the crime of not drowning. He was finally allowed into Mandated Palestine despite MacMichael's warnings that \"this would open the floodgates\" and \"completely undermine our whole policy regarding illegal immigrants.\"\n\nToday, to most Israelis, Struma is a curious street name in a few towns. Israeli school children barely encounter its esoteric story. Politically correct authors and trendy leftwing filmmakers shun the subject, preferring postmodern portrayals of Arab terrorists as Zionism's prey.\n\nOblivion is perhaps the greatest sin against the Struma but also against ourselves. If we forget the Struma, we forget why this country exists, why we struggle for its survival. We forget the justice of our cause.\n\nDimmed memory and self-destructive perverse morality hinder our ability to protect ourselves from the offspring and torchbearers of the very Arabs who doomed the Struma. They haven't amended their hostile agenda. We just don't care to be reminded.\n\nThe state the Jews created is threatened with destruction and its population with obliteration.\n\nYet there's negligible sympathy for Israel and even less practical support to avert tragedy. The Struma's story is seminal in understanding why the Holocaust was possible and why a second Holocaust cannot be ruled out. More than anything, the Struma powerfully illustrates what happens when Jews rely on others' goodwill.\n\nWho would have guessed that Anti-Semitism could lurk in the allegedly autobiographical words of a young Jewish woman? But they have, in the memoir of Deborah Feldman and the stories she tells about growing up Satmar.\n\nI don't think that Feldman meant to create this monster, yet the intentions, for good or bad, cannot stop the destruction this creation is causing. Many in our community say we should let it slide, to ignore it because it will go away in a few weeks and is not worth giving a platform to. I vehemently disagree. I think if we don't address this lie we are no better than Ms. Feldman because we allow a lie to spread.\n\nIf we allow a New York Times bestseller filled with half-truths, untruths and outright lies to be the uncontested representation of the truth of our lifestyle and a butchery of Halacha, we are doing ourselves a disservice of the highest proportion. The wicked Joseph Goebbels, The Nazi minister of propaganda, used to repeat Hitler's \"Big Lie,\" which paraphrased over time simply says, \"If you repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it.\"\n\nWhile we ignore Uncensored, and encourage those in our community to ignore it, and say, \"Why don't you let it slide into oblivion?\" the big lie is repeated and repeated and repeated. Yes. Obviously even negative PR plays into the hands of such a book, because any controversy is good for book sales. But by not contesting the truth and speaking out, a larger evil grows—that of the \"Big Lie.\"\n\nAs of today \"Unorthodox\" is a New York Times best seller, and I'm not surprised. It's a book about us, about religious Jews, with our Yarmulkes and traditional dress, our religiously protective and seemingly mysterious lifestyle. We do seem somewhat mysterious to the general population. Because they don't know the truth, they depend on whatever crumbs of information comes their way. Many of those reading this book already think we are all extremely wealthy. They whisper all kinds of rumors about how we conduct our personal lives, what we believe, how we live—all based on the stories of a young girl who admits she hated, refused and resented everything about her faith, her people and her community. To look for her to deliver a fair and balanced perspective of Orthodox Judaism is to expect an atheist to describe Christianity.\n\nThis is not like \"kosher yoshke\" or another book that we might not like but which doesn't directly impact you and I. This is a direct attack on who we are, on the Torah, and on all that we hold dear.\n\nI do not doubt that Ms. Feldman grew up in a tremendously difficult environment. I do not contest the fact that her decisions and her perceptions in life are hers to make. We must all live with the consequences of our decisions and now it is time for her to understand how her actions have affected all Jews.\n\nI am not attacking Ms. Feldman. I am championing truth. Look around and see how you and your family's beautiful and kosher lifestyle are being put into the average American's consciousness in the most degrading way. If left unchecked, that image of you will change the way practically every non-Jew you come across will perceive you. Is that what you want?\n\nI don't know how I ended up being the person to write this; I'm no great scholar. But someone has to step up to the plate—to take a stand. This is not the time to be reticent.\n\nIt was during the lifetime of many of us, or our parents that the first sparks of hatred against Judaism flickered in the darkness—fanned by perceptions, rumors and gossip that the Jews were a super evil and backward cult, both in Europe and in the United States. The coals of the fires of Anti-Semitism have been banked since WWII, but they have never been extinguished. Those who fanned the flames of hatred against the Jews half a century ago, can quickly fan the flames again, intentionally or not.\n\nThere are enough well written pieces and reviews about the book and how its author wrote a compelling work of fiction that we should be worried. Uncensored gives a platform to those who envision orthodox Jews with the same paintbrush that allowed the perception of Jews as evil and subhuman \"untermentchen\". Last time this happened, Hitler herded into the camps and the ovens in Germany and Poland. I am not over reacting.\n\nAll mighty oaks grow from small acorns. A liberal media, and a world of readers hungry for criticism of orthodox Jews are watering the acorn this young woman has planted. The well-written and positive reviews of this book are fertilizing an idea, a perception, a fear and a hatred of Jews among nations who do not know us.\n\nThis is WHY we need to not bury our heads in the sand and wait for this to just go away. We need to come out and forcefully say, \"This is not us at all.\" It would be even better if Simon and Schuster sees the hullabaloo and call her bluff. If publishers could see that this book is her fictionalized anthology of every camp story she ever heard, along with some salt and pepper added for taste and shock value, perhaps they could see that she is destroying their credibility. The public trusts publishing houses to print the truth as truth and fiction as fiction.\n\nIf you and I don't respond by saying (pick yours) \"I'm not Satmar, I'm not Chassidic. I'm not Charedi. I'm not Jewish, this doesn't talk about ME!\" then let me assure you, the only mark you are making is a mark in the sand that will get washed away the next time the tide comes in.\n\nAnti-Semitism is on the rise. The economy is bad. When people don't have money to spread around they are forced to face the reality of their situation. They create realities for themselves based on the lies of others and of their own fears.\n\nThis book has been prepared for publication for a while. Like popcorn, these types of stories and books used to pop once in awhile, and then be forgotten about and become silent. In today's political and economic climate, the popping is not going away.\n\nThe sounds of Anti-Semitic stories are being heard more often. The outside world is interested in these stories, and not in a positive way, but in a way they can use to justify hatred, discrimination and attacks upon our faith. With the rise of blogs in which many unhappy (or happy but bored) individuals can share their thoughts, most bloggers understand that unless they post something unusual and attention grabbing, like Ms. Feldman, their aspirations of fame will remain unmet.\n\nThey therefore blog, making sure to take a grain of truth (if that) and fabricate an entire story out of it. They then say, with a total straight face, that their fabrication is true, whether it is or not.\n\nWhen these blogs do take off, the blogger is under increasing pressure to create even more content with even greater shock value. It is the shock value that keeps the readers reading, the media reporting and the comment cravings satisfied. It's how the \"Big Lie\" gets spread. Say it often enough, say it in enough places, have people who are seen as credible and responsible say it on enough blogs, or on the news and have it go uncontested and pretty soon, it becomes truth to those who don't seek the truth.\n\nI for one, want to be seen and respected for my choices in life. How about you?\n\nHUNGER STRIKE PERVERSION\n\nDetained without charges, a Palestinian Arab is hunger-striking for a trial. His lawyers and NGOs deemed human rights organizations have appealed to Israel's Supreme Court to rule against preventive detention before the prisoner succumbs.\n\nFellow Palestinian Arabs have identified the detainee, Khader Adnan, as a leader of Islamic Jihad. Islamic Jihad has carried out suicide bombings and has fired rockets into Israeli civilian areas from Gaza. The newspaper article describes the organization as \"extremist.\"\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman explains that administrative detention is used when sources too sensitive to be revealed inform the government of people who threaten regional security.\n\nThe lawyers retort that without hearing the charges, they cannot render a proper defense (Isabel Kershner, NY Times, 2/21/12, A8).\n\nThe controversy is complex, whereas the newspaper treats it simply, omitting most of the issue. Let's make sense of this.\n\nIslamic Jihad is not just \"extremist,\" it is terrorist. The newspaper does a disservice in minimizing the menace. Hunger striking was a tool of innocent people. Its use by a terrorist perverts the process.\n\nAdministrative detention is a wartime measure. Is Israel at war? Yes. Palestinian Arabs have been warring on it since the 1920s. Several Arab states have committed aggression against Israel more than once. Some of them have not made peace even officially. The Palestinian Authority (P.A.) has made peace on paper but wars in reality.\n\nNot only do Muslims make war on Israel militarily, often by means of war crimes, but they and others, including leftist Israelis, also try to destroy Jewish sovereignty by many other methods. They boycott, defame, engage in lawfare, abuse student rights, seek to censor patriots, and stage unnecessary flotillas.\n\nIt is true that administrative detention can prevent legal defense. One has to know the charges and evidence, to mount a defense. That is one down side of the practice.\n\nAdministrative detention permits governmental abuse. Does Israel abuse that discretionary power? Probably not against the Arabs, considering how concerned Israel is about being criticized and that it has convicted thousands of terrorists  not relying upon administrative detention. Against right wing Jews in the Territories, however, the government has abused the practice. Dealing with Jewish civilian suspects, often innocent, does not require the military and emergency measure of preventive detention that dealing with Islamic terrorists does. Using that power with them is abusive.\n\nOne reason the lawyers appeal to the Supreme Court is that the Court has arrogated to itself the right to overrule anything the government does simply because the judges have different likes and dislikes. Judgment by whim! Most of the judges are far leftists, who generally prefer the Arab side.\n\nLet's elaborate on the government's reason for reliance upon preventive detention. In a trial, the government can be asked to produce its evidence and to name its secret sources. In Israel, the terrorists and their sympathetic lawyers may well reveal the sources and methods to terrorist organizations. Exposing them ends their usefulness. Going further, the P.A. then would arrest, torture, and murder the sources and learn to counter-act Israeli intelligence methods. How does that protect innocent people? Indeed, Israeli national security would be compromised.\n\nAlthough the defense lawyers in Israel claim they are interested in justice, they would thwart justice. Some defense lawyers in the U.S. also become like Mafia lawyers, using legal forms to thwart justice, but there is much less of it. Therefore, in some U.S. military courts and even civilian ones, the judges could close the proceedings to public view when sensitive evidence is to be presented, without as much concern that the government would be alerting enemy forces. But still there is some concern, and it is legitimate. Some terrorists can evade being tried and get themselves released, by making clear they would fish for sensitive intelligence in a trial.\n\nPresident Obama assisted terrorist organizations when recently he revealed some details of raids on terrorists. Terrorist organizations can infer much from such revelations. They learn counter-counter-intelligence from it.\n\nThere is another alternative. That alternative is to execute captured terrorists other than the most peripheral participants, preferably when capturing them. Remember, terrorists do not fight by the rules of war, they are war criminals, and they do not have the rights of POWs. As a result of executions, there would not be thousands of them to be released and murder again. Execution would remove the incentive for their organizations to capture Israelis to trade for a thousand at-a-time, and it would deter much terrorism. Terrorists gain much of their bravado from knowledge that they may be released and return to a hero's welcome.\n\nBeing at war, Israel would have a right to slay terrorists during raids and to execute those captured later. But in the guise of being humanitarian, the world would be aghast at numerous executions. Executions it leaves to terrorists to do. The world does not much care about the victims of terrorists.\n\nFor example, Sudan once again is committing terrorism as a form of jihad and ethnic cleansing, now against the Nubians. What do Senators McCain and Graham care about those innocent victims! They propose that the U.S. arm Syrian rebels, lest Assad purge a smaller number than in Sudan. But the rebels surely include Muslim Brotherhood members. If the Brotherhood takes over Syria, much more blood would flow. So our Senators propose rescuing people of questionable innocence and express little interest in the innocent people of Sudan. That is perverse humanitarianism.\n\nI find many New York Times readers naïve about these issues. That paper does not report the whole story. It omits the significant part from which one can make sense out of the story.\n\nISRAEL RELEASING HUNGER STRIKER\n\nIsrael scheduled the release of the terrorist hunger striker, who has ended his fast. Unless additional evidence against him is discovered, he will be released for time served just short of the originally stated period. This means that his fellow Palestinian Arabs will not riot over his self-induced death, for which they would blame Israel.\n\nThe government decision also avoids having its policy reviewed and possibly overturned by the Supreme Court. Qadura Fares, president of the Palestinian Prisoners Society was skeptical that the Court would reject the policy, because it did not do so during previous reviews.\n\nArabs are calling the decision a victory for him, though Israeli policy remains unchanged. They are lionizing him and comparing him with real victims elsewhere.\n\nOn the other hand, Israel is concerned that more prisoners would fast for release (Ethan Bronner, NY Times, 2//22/12, A6).\n\nActive terrorist leaders whose cell killed people and sought to murder other innocent civilians deserve unceremonious capital punishment. To have let him live was immoral. To release him is dangerous. For Israel's existential NGO enemies and for him to claim a moral cause worth a hunger strike is a travesty.\n\nThe behavior of the NGOs and of the people who call him a hero is hypocritical. Hypocrisy governs the whole Palestinian Arab cause, as in today's NY Times op-ed in which an Arab leader talks about getting freedom from Israel. Both halves of the Palestinian Authority curb their people's freedom and aspire to deprive the Jewish people of theirs.\n\nAlso hypocritical about jihad is the American expression of hope for negotiations with Iran, which uses negotiations to stall while its centrifuges spin. This notion about Iran may be instead a combination of extreme naivete uninformed by the record and rationalization for an ideological framework conceived with a sort of religious ardor.\n\nIt doesn't take much for Palestinian Arabs to riot, when it advances their cause. They are not being humanitarian about this. They torture and murder prisoners, including Arab prisoners. This hunger strike is an excuse for them to protest, and their fanaticism and intolerance resents any defeat for their religious imperialism. They think themselves lords of the earth. But on the whole, they approve of terrorism. Doesn't that make them among the scourges of the earth?\n\nThe government of Israel often caves in to pressure. Some people think Israel should bow to public opinion, so as not to be beaten by public opinion. Think again! Israel's fanatical and existential enemies are not reasonable people who acknowledge Israel's good will. They are Western bullies who exploit each concession to demand another, and they are Muslims who consider such concessions a sign of weakness. Israeli concessions encourage its enemies to exert more pressure.\n\nNor is that the only problem with its decision. Its decision reinforces the propaganda that Israel is the oppressor and Arabs are the victims. Israel should have reviewed the crimes committed under the prisoner's command. It should have made sure that the Westerners would have no excuse for defending what is a menace to innocent people.\n\nThe most dramatic oppression of the region's civil societies and the Arab Spring is not by means of weapons, or in the Middle East. It is not led by Gaddafi, Mubarak, Bin Ali, Saleh, or Assad. It is led by the powerful Islamist lobbies in Washington DC. People may find my words "
