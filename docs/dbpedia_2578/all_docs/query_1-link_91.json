        "text": "Dear Reader\n\nI hope you persisted in searching for this blog as it has certainly not delivered on its original aim to keep you informed, amused, and up to date on my writing and other events in my life. It is almost three months since my last post -’Moving Home in Time of Covid Part One’. What follows is Part Two. Sorry if it is not as coherent as some of my other writing but it should be self-explanatory.\n\nMoving Home in Time of Covid: Part Two\n\nOur usual Saturday morning has some vestige of regularity, but the Saturday pre-Moving Day did not conform. We had not finished breakfast when the packers arrived, you will note that I have not used upper case for the p as that is reserved for Professional Packers. Our packers did not conform to that definition. We had expected them at nine o’clock, they arrived just after eight. We had expected them to wear masks and generally conform to Government Regulations We are left wondering where the packers will find space to put what they pack.\n\nTwo months have passed since I wrote the opening paragraph above. Two months since I have attempted to write anything, including change of address. Two months of moods of utter dejection swinging to ecstatic joy. I cannot remember if our last move created the same mood swings, but I was ten years, a brain abscess, walking without two sticks, arteries clogging up, and a heart attack, younger. Age does suddenly catch up and the body refuses to keep in tune with the mind. Throw into the mix Miranda’s back problems with the agony of walking, sitting, or staying flat on her back, and the perfect storm has arrived. All that apart and I am still pleased that we took the decision to move. One of the many joys has been the sounds of children next door playing in their garden, still haven’t worked out why our previous move was into an over 55, gated community. Nice neighbours, delightful bungalow that suited our needs, fabulous and caring local surgery, but those were benefits we discovered after moving. Maybe it was the promises of the sales brochure that drew us into the web of deceit and non-delivery of services.\n\nComparing our latest move with our previous move is probably unfair, as we have an almost ten-year gap, and our memories may be suffering from golden halo syndrome, but we are sure that the builders left the bungalow clean, not the case with this move. The occupants left dirt, grime, slime and several large holes in the walls and garden where they had removed ‘things’ on the wall and plants from the garden. Even a heroic attempt to clean up the ten-month-old house by Lorna, professional carpet and oven cleaning only dented the surface. A word of advice, never buy a house from the internet, a fifteen-minute visit, and the promise of a professional clean from the seller, if you don’t want to spend both money and energy making the house a home. We have done both but won’t be properly satisfied until we have a new kitchen and utility room and a complete redesign of the garden. Not easy undertakings with Miranda on crutches and in agony. Without Lorna and Dan the magic whirlwind, the mood swings would all be deep into negative territory.\n\nMoving Home in Time of Covid: Part Three {July 2012}\n\nI know I should be pleased that I am attempting to write again. I have joined the local U3A writing group, Writing for Pleasure, and the immediate advantage was a deadline which forced me into writing the Train. You can make your own judgement as it is attached to this post.\n\nI have not completed Knesset, third part of In Time of War series, and have not completed the third book in Soldier of the Queen trilogy. I can only plead exhaustion from the manifold tasks of moving home, we are almost half-way into the garden redesign, plans for the new kitchen have been almost agreed. However, progress on the Utility room is good and the floor is now complete and storage units up and running. We will have the white goods plumbed in when the new kitchen is fitted, planned for mid-September, after we return from Cromarty to attend the final laying to rest of my Father-in-Law. He would appreciate the final section of this blog. He was fortunate that his mind and body remained intact, and I have no doubt he welcomed his passing, aged ninety-nine, as he had outlived his friends and acquaintances. I have great hopes that our visit to Cromarty will give Miranda a chance to mourn him properly.\n\nGrowing Old is not an Easy Gig (Part 3)\n\nI started this thread back in November 2019 when I noticed that age was no longer creeping up on me but had become a real feature of my existence. The following May of 2020 I added Part 2 and engaged with Covid 19. Now in July 2021 I feel I should add another section. I was double jabbed early, one of the few benefits of age, and to date have been mercifully free of the virus. Taking the lateral flow test gives me that assurance, and I know it must be good for me as it is a very unpleasant experience.\n\nGrowing old is a far greater problem than the remote prospect of Covid, although some of the indicators have a startling similarity – lassitude, breathing difficulties, diminished ability to smell and taste, joint pains, mood swings, and a general sense of feeling unwell. Notwithstanding all the above my lateral flow test proves my malady is not Covid. It should be comforting to fall back onto age as the issue as there is no known or accepted cure for that condition. However, my sense of frustration grows when I am forced to recognise that bending over, climbing stairs rapidly, keeping my arms above my head, lifting a reasonable weight, turning too quickly, are risky undertakings. Falling down is usually a slow-motion affair and apart from the odd bruise not too difficult to live with. Getting up from the floor is a little more uncertain; muscles and sinews have their own free will and it takes some extremely positive instructions from the brain before they respond in the correct order.\n\nThe whispers coming from government ministers indicate that Covid restrictions will come to an end soon; when that happens, we will be faced by the dilemma of throwing caution to the wind or staying masked and socially separated. The decision will be a personal choice rather than following a government edict. With the alarming rise in cases I am in favour of playing it safe, but who is to be believed, scientists or politicians, in what ‘safe’ looks like.\n\nWriting this piece and ‘The Train’ has encouraged me to get back to finishing my novels and hopefully developing further works. I am toying with the thought of publishing revised and updated versions of some of my technical writing but maybe that is a step too far.\n\nThe world exploded as the Ottoman counter offensive began. The German-designed and manufactured Krupp 75-mm and 77-mm field guns, grouped in four-gun batteries laid down a short-lived barrage of fire. The duration was not important to Frank Toprack as he cowered behind the six camels he had been leading to pick up much wanted water from a well situated south of Beersheba. He regained consciousness several hours later and after feeling all over his body decided that all his limbs were still intact. The camels had not been so fortunate, all six were still, victims of shell impact. It was typical of Frank to check the animals first before looking for Corporal Jack Warren, who had been on the far side of the line of camels. It took only a brief glance to see that Warren was dead. The top half of his body lay on the far side a small crater and there was no sign of legs. Frank surmised that the shell must have fallen short as the main body of the of the two companies of the Imperial Camel Brigade and detachments New Zealand field troops retreated from attacking a train near Hafir el Auja.\n\nFrank sat and took a long swig from his canteen, his mouth caked with dust and dried spittle. He knew that he could survive without food, but in the dry heat of the Sinai without water he would soon join Jack Warren. His best prospect was to make for El-Auja and the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway line. In the 90’s his father had worked on the line before a Cholera epidemic persuaded him to emigrate to Australia, where camel drivers and herders where needed to open up the out-back. Frank followed his father’s occupation until he enlisted and unlike most army postings, he was a square peg in a square hole. At home, the family spoke Arabic, but Frank was fluent in English, or the Australian version. As dusk fell, he started walking, using Polaris, the North Star, as his guide.\n\nAs dawn broke, he saw two stretcher bearers struggling to carry, what looked like a wounded officer. He shouted and the stretcher was lowered to the ground. As Frank approached, he could see the officer pointing a pistol at the lead carrier.\n\n‘What’s going on mate?’ Do you have any water?’\n\nThe officer replied. ‘What’s your unit soldier?’\n\n‘Brigade Field Group, Imperial Camel Brigade.’\n\n‘You will address me as Sir, Soldier.’\n\n‘Yes Sir, I’m about dead on my feet, do you have any water?’ Frank noticed several canteens stacked on the stretcher.\n\n‘Before that, what are you doing here?’\n\nFrank explained his situation, and the officer threw him a canteen.\n\n‘I am Captain Devereux of the Coldstream Guards, working in Field Intelligence. These two conscientious objectorspicked me up after I suffered wounds to my legs. It was their intention to surrender to the Turks, but I have so far persuaded them otherwise. Hence, the need for the revolver. You will join the group and assist me to delay the train planned to leave from Jaffa with a full division of Turkish reinforcements. We are only two miles from the line, and I have the means to cause a derailment. If this division closes the gap in the Ottoman line our forces will find it difficult to advance.’\n\nFor the first time one of the stretcher bearers spoke. ‘Listen mate, he’s as mad as a hatter. We picked him up after the Turks put down a barrage. My name is Bill Speed and that is George Wilson. We are Conchies and there is no way we will cause death to anyone, Turks or otherwise. We will surrender at the first opportunity.’\n\n‘I’m not sure who is the craziest, if you surrender you are as good as dead. The Turks don’t give a rat’s arse who you are if you are in uniform. They’ll put you up against a wall.’\n\n‘Enough chatter, pick me up and get moving.’ The captain pointed at Frank. ‘I’m pleased to see that you have retained your rifle. You will take point, not that I expect to run into any trouble until we reach the railway line.’ Frank hesitated until he saw the revolver pointing in his direction. ‘Do I make myself clear, soldier.’\n\n‘Yes Sir.’\n\nKaymakam Kemal Bey looked at the line of soldiers waiting to board the train. They were a typical mixture of races from the Ottoman Empire. It was a cause for concern that many of them were young in bright new uniforms. The Empire had paid heavily for their support of the Prussian war machine. Their lives were of little concern to Kemal Bey. Men were needed to shore up the defences of Jerusalem and the surrounding Judean hills to stop the advance of the British and their Imperial forces under General Allenby. Escorted by his protection team, he made his way to his carriage at the front of train behind two flatcars that carried rails, sleepers, track repair materials and a platoon of soldiers who had become well versed in repairing and relaying track. The two steam locomotives would push the carriages and flat cars loaded with heavy guns and ammunition from the rear of the train, they were too valuable to be risked at the front. It was certain that saboteurs would attempt to damage the single track. Kaymakam Kemal Bey gave the order. The train, carrying a full division of troops, shuddered, and with a squeal of the driving wheels began the journey to Jerusalem.\n\nIt was almost mid-day. Frank guessed the small group had walked two miles since he had been coerced into acting as point. The sun was beginning to project its full heat on the suffering stretcher bearers when Frank spotted a short spur line and canvas covered hut, used by maintenance crews in earlier, peaceful times. The only thing it contained was a rusting pump action hand car. He waited for the others to catch up.\n\nCaptain Devereux allowed the group water. ‘Get that thing on the main line and help me off this stretcher.’ He pulled open a rucksack and pulled out six sticks of dynamite with fuses.\n\nFrank noticed that the sticks were sweating. ‘Bloody hell Sir, those could explode at any moment.’\n\n‘Not your concern soldier!’ Devereux barked. Help those two get that buggy on the main line. Then stick two of these under a track joint above the steel sleeper. They have a five second fuse, so I suggest you don’t hang around. We’ll move a hundred and fifty yards down the line and repeat the process. We’ll reserve two sticks. How good a marksman are you?’\n\nThe question was unexpected, and Frank answered automatically. ‘I’m Australian and Palestinian so I grew up with a rifle.’\n\n‘Enough of your insolence soldier. Are you accurate at three hundred yards?’\n\n‘Yes Sir.’\n\nThe train slowed from walking pace an hour to a stop and Kaymakam Kemal Bey put down his coffee cup.\n\n‘Bey, the line is broken and there is a hand car further down the line.’\n\n‘How long will the repair take?’\n\n‘At least an hour, Bey.’\n\n‘Get it done. I will have my lunch while we wait.’\n\nBy the time the repair was made, and the locomotives brought back up to steam almost two hours were lost. The train moved forward slowly and then the brakes were applied once more.\n\n‘Bey, I must report that the track is broken again. The hand car has moved back to below the incline. It is possible that the occupants are responsible for the breaks.’\n\n‘Send a squad to investigate the hand car and get on with the repairs.’\n\nAs the squad walked down the track two shots rang out and the janissary agha, or commander, was hit. The squad immediately dropped to the ground. Another two shots and two of the repair crew were wounded.\n\nFrank Toprak considered his handiwork and retired back to the hand car and a welcome intake of water.\n\n‘Good shooting soldier. That should hold them for a few hours. Stuck in those carriages the sun will start to adle their brains. You two get pumping, we’ll retire another mile. If we can hold them until darkness, they won’t dare move in the night. Twenty-four hours will make all the difference to Allenby.’\n\n‘What do you mean the troops are restless?’ Kaymakam Kemal Bey felt frustrated, and he had difficulty in holding his temper in check. ‘Fall them out at the side of the track, include the officers. Give them an hour of close order drill.’\n\n‘Bey, our reserves of water are low and many of the new recruits have finished their canteens.’\n\n‘They may have to go thirsty. It will teach them a lesson for the future. Where is the hand car now?’\n\n‘It has retired beyond the next incline, Bey.’\n\n‘Move the train up as soon as the rail is repaired and then send out a sufficient force to capture it.’\n\nFrank sat close to the top of an incline about a hundred yards from the hand car. He was not sure if Captain Devereux was mad, but he was certain that the man had a death wish and from the smell coming from his legs, gangrene had taken hold of his wounds. He heard the sound of the train labouring up the incline as the sun started to drop below the hills. He became aware of Turkish troops moving along the track over the other side of the incline. It was time to move.\n\n‘Captain, the Turks are on their way. There’s a squad of soldiers just over the incline.’\n\n‘Now is the time you may make a choice.’ Devereux handed his revolver to Frank. ‘Run or surrender. I will stay here and delay the Turks whatever you decide.’ He pulled the remaining dynamite from the nap sack and inserted the fuses.\n\nSpeed and Wilson both lifted their arms and began to walk towards the Turks. Frank Toprack shook the captain’s hand. ‘God speed, Sir, I’ll not forget you.’ He took two canteens from the Hand car and walked away into the scrub as darkness closed in. He heard shots from the direction of the approaching Turks and then an explosion.\n\n1715 Words\n\nOne of the problems of being a law-abiding citizen is that I take my obligations seriously. An unfortunate result of this excess of zeal is the need to consult the advice given by government. After the first eighteen pages of ‘Guidance: Government advice on home moving during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak’, I reluctantly decided to go ahead without the full benefit of the wisdom imparted by some civil servant. However, I had gained some knowledge of how to proceed and remain safe.\n\nI, or probably should say ‘we’, as Miranda and I own our bungalow jointly, or in common, the definitions can be found from any good search engine, decided upon a local Estate Agent. This is the first of many hurdles to overcome, but after Miranda talked to most of the locals we settled upon Darren. His first visit to us resulted in a ‘house tidy’ and eventual photo shoot. Darren was firm in his mode of photography – no wide-angle lenses or artistic adventures, only plain photographs. I thought it was a ploy to save him costs, but when the advertisements appeared in Right Move, Zoopla, On the Market and the agent’s own website I wanted to buy the property. It certainly made me wonder why we are moving home. There are several answers. Arriving at my eighty fifth birthday; the probability of mortality; the need to be nearer the family, we are always being told we live a long way away; the prospect of avoiding Stamp Duty. In an ideal world we would move the bungalow, every single brick, tile, kitchen and living room, to another site in the South East. Yes, we like our house, but the world is not ideal and we are resigned to letting others enjoy our home on a permanent basis.\n\nDarren, our agent, came up with a prospective buyer and arranged a ‘Covid protected’ visit. We were banished from home while Darren and his prospect inspected the property. The eventual rejection came three days later together with the news of another potential purchaser. This one backed out even before a visit, having committed on another property we were informed. Christmas came and passed away in a Covid-like dream sequence, almost like Darren’s communications. Then a late January call from Darren resulted in another prospect visiting. Miranda managed to be present on this occasion, masked up and determined to keep social distancing. I was banned to my writing shed in the garden and merely waved a limp hand at the inspecting group. Two or three anxious days and our prospect had asked Darren for another visit to include his partner. Again, my sole contribution was a limp wave from the shed. This was followed by an offer, and after a small haggle a price was agreed, subject to contract and their surveyor’s report.\n\nIt is strange how one worries about a surveyor’s visit even though the property was only built nine years ago and would still have time to run on the ten-year guarantee. Not that the guarantee meant a great deal as the insurer was insolvent, and the builder had gone into liquidation. However, we survived the wait and the surveyor assured us that the bungalow was well built, but we had a broken tile on the roof. His report also added that one section of the loft signs of damp, not surprising since the broken tile let water onto the felt, and that the roof had not been constructed with sufficient ventilation. Two hundred and ninety pounds later and two visits by roofers who sucked their pencils and muttered incantations denying all knowledge of the type of tile, the roof is now well ventilated and dry. Getting a proper receipt for the works from the roofer added to Miranda’s burdens in moving the sale forward.\n\nSince the prospects of a sale, we have been seeking something to buy. Our preferred new area is West Sussex, near to where our daughter has recently bought a new Taylor Wimpey property. The story of their move is worthy of its own short, or maybe long, story and I will not pre-empt it as she is more than capable of putting all the facts on record. At first, we were keen to buy a new bungalow, but looking at the prices for a basic four walls, windows, and doors it was obvious that our budget would not stretch to a bungalow but might be sufficient for a small house. Property developers have taken a leaf out of the car salesman’s manual and so many things are ‘extra’. The developer has a new name – upgrades. In truth without the upgrades, you will get four walls etc.\n\nStart with the beating heart of a home, the kitchen. Seeking extra space in the kitchen? The developer’s standard upper-cabinet height will be 30 inches, but if you can increase that to 36 inches or even 42. The height will provide an extra shelf of storage, and the closer you can get to the ceiling the better, for both storage and aesthetic reasons. (Short cabinets can look stumpy.) Bonus: Taking the uppers all the way up eliminates the space above for dust to collect. Pots and pans drawers are deeper than standard drawers and are perfect for — you guessedit— pots and pans. They’re also useful for storing small appliances such as toasters, blenders, and coffee grinders. These drawers help you to clear your work surface, Oops! There’s another upgrade, modestly priced and definitely one you’ll be grateful for. And so it goes on, upgrades that make your house your home: built in wardrobes; light fittings; paint other than white; floor coverings; improved underlay for your extra charge carpets. Getting desperate we decided to put a reservation on a new Barratt Home, available late September, but to make it habitable the upgrades added almost £30K to the basic price of £420K and it was three hundred square feet smaller than our bungalow. On top of the purchase price there was a further charge of Stamp Duty at around £12K.\n\nThen Lady Luck stepped in. She appeared in the guise of a sales lady on one of the alternative new build sites we had visited. She phoned to say that there was a house, completed by her company under a year ago, on the market because the buying chain was broken. It was available for completion before the Stamp Duty holiday finished. Our daughter made a visit and gave us a What’s App view and commentary and we made an offer subject to contract. What we meant was if we could get our buyer and their chain to persuade their solicitors to wake up and use modern communications to save their clients’ money. It also gave us a chance to visit the house and make the necessary compromises in the difference between our bungalow and the new house. The key item being the lack of a utility room in the new house. Fortunately, we were able to solve this problem by having a priority of creating a utility room at the rear of the large garage. I have no doubt the problems with this change to the house layout will form some of the future writing of Part Two of the moving saga, as will the completion of the other compromises that await us.\n\nThe biggest problem we have encountered is to find someone to move us. We did the sensible thing and arranged for three quotations. That was the easy part. Two came forward and visited and the third conducted a remote visit with Miranda running around the house and opening all the cupboards and drawers. Our local remover came back with an incomprehensible quote which Miranda followed up and finally got a final price, but this was still hedged about with conditions and the requirement to pay a deposit. The virtual tour resulted in a quotation that seemed to think we were moving to the moon. The regional mover had a fair price but when we tried to book a date, they would not take the booking until we had exchanged contracts or paid £500.00 non- returnable fee or agreed to some very onerous charges if the move were delayed. Our solicitors were reluctant to give an exchange date, and eventually we went with our proposed completion date. We tried to go back to the local remover, but they had filled the slot. After many exchanges of e-mails and phone calls, Miranda persuaded the regional mover to book us in, however they can only pack three days prior to loading. We gave in and confirmed, and now must hope the Gods, and solicitors who must have some special relationship to the deities, do not let us down.\n\nWe decided that the Barratt House didn’t compare on value for money, although its location near Goodwood was tempting and cancelled the reservation. We understand that our reservation fee will come back to us, less a cancellation charge, in ‘fullness of time’. The almost new house has a good location on a smaller private estate nearer to the sea and a quarter mile track to walk around direct from the house. This weekend, three weeks prior to moving Dan, our son-in-law arrived and helped Miranda prepare for the move. He is a whirl wind and has taken down almost everything that can be unscrewed, filled, packed, and stacked including swing benches, ceramic water features. Bookshelves and cassette holders in the study, heavy weight mirrors in the dining/ sitting room, taken apart our wardrobe in our bedroom, and transferred clothes to special hangers, stripped the loft bare and marvelled at the number and variety of suitcases, pictures and other dross that we have collected over the years. We did manage to preserve space in the sitting room and kitchen, although the kitchen is now bereft of anything that was attached to the wall and the dining room is a mass of boxes, some full and others empty, stacked against other furniture. We are left wondering where the packers will find space to put what they pack. But that is a problem we will face when they arrive.\n\nPart two of this saga will be written when we have arrived in West Sussex. I can’t wait to finish!\n\nIf you are to believe my account of what happened to me on the night of 3rd of October 2024 you will need to appreciate an event that happened in 1974, twenty years before I was born. My name is Juan Perez, and I am a refugee from Colombia, where I was a Professor in the Faculty of Life Sciences at the University of Antioquia. I am now living in the United States of America without permission or legitimate documents, although there is now hope that the President, Joe Biden, having secured his second term, will legalise our status and allow citizenship. The fiftieth anniversary of the event is being celebrated by all those, including myself, with an abiding and professional interest in sending the most powerful broadcast ever deliberately beamed into space.\n\nOf course, it was an American experiment in search for extra-terrestrial intelligence in the galaxy, known as SETI. The American public needed something to distract them from the disastrous presidency of Richard Nixon. Following Nixon’s resignation, Gerald Ford the vice president, served as the 38th president of the United States from August 1974 to January 1977. Ford previously served as the 40th vice president of the United States from December 1973 to August 1974. Ford became the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment. Ford is the only person to have served as both vice president and president without being elected to either office by the Electoral College. My apologies if I digress but the holder of the office of President is vital to me and sixteen million illegals.\n\nThe Arecibo Observatory is in Barrio Esperanza, Puerto Rico owned by the US National Science Foundation (NSF). The broadcast formed part of the ceremonies held to mark a major upgrade to the Arecibo Radio Telescope. The transmission consisted of a simple, pictorial message, aimed at our putative cosmic companions in the globular star cluster M13. This cluster is roughly 21,000 light-years from us, near the edge of the Milky Way galaxy, and contains approximately a third of a million stars. It can be found in a star pattern called the Keystone – a lopsided square within the constellation Hercules – between the two brightest stars of northern spring and summer, Vega, and Arcturus. At mid-northern latitudes, the M13 cluster can be found in the sky for at least part of the night all year round. The broadcast was particularly powerful because it used Arecibo’s megawatt transmitter attached to its 305-metre antenna. The latter concentrates the transmitter energy by beaming it into an extremely small patch of sky. The emission was equivalent to a 20 trillion-watt omnidirectional broadcast, and it would be detectable as a SETI experiment just about anywhere in the galaxy, assuming a receiving antenna similar in size to Arecibo’s. The message consists of 1679 bits, arranged into 73 lines of 23 characters per line (these are both prime numbers, and may help the aliens decode the message). The “ones” and “zeroes” were transmitted by frequency shifting at the rate of 10 bits per second. The total broadcast was less than three minutes. The visual in the message consists, among other things, of the Arecibo telescope, a representation of our solar system, a stick figure of a human, coding of human DNA, and some of the biochemicals of earthly life. The purpose of the message was to prompt a reply.\n\nIt is unfortunate that during the four years of the Trump Presidency the Arecibo Observatory was starved of resources and is now a mouldering mass of rusting supports that have collapsed inward and the antennae directional mechanisms have been removed for their scrap value. Puerto Rico was not a state to be cherished within the Trump empire. It was rumoured that the Golf Course was not a paying proposition and Trump was accused of owing Puerto Rico $33million after the business went bankrupt.\n\nThe sky was exceptionally clear that night with Cassiopeia and the Big Dipper shining bright. I had been working all day and into the late evening in a large field in the lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas, picking ripeavocados as part of a gang of illegals working for a payment far below the legal minimum. It is true that we had shared two bottles of tequila as we left the field. The gang climbed into the back of the converted Buick pick-up, but I decided to walk back to the temporary camp we lived in. I saw the Orionids meteor shower flashing across the sky. There were between ten and twenty separate meteors flashes every hour. For a reason that we humans have never been able to explain, more meteors tend to fly after midnight, and the Orionids are typically at their best in the hours before dawn. These fast-moving meteors occasionally leave persistent light trails and sometimes produce bright fireballs, some of which cannot be seen distinctly due to the moonlit glare. If you trace these meteors backward, they seem to come from the constellation Hercules.\n\nAs I walked back to camp along the dirt road well after midnight, I heard a roar of noise like an express train above my head. Suddenly I was thrown into the ditch at the side of the track and my senses left me. It was almost light when I finally returned to consciousness. My clothes were charred, and my hair shrivelled to a black skein. My blistered face and hands were throbbing with pain and I realised I had been burnt, fortunately my clothes had taken the brunt of what ever had been the source of heat. As I remembered the noise before I lost consciousness, my first thought was that I had been involved in an aircraft crash, but I discarded that idea as I was still alone in the damp ditch bordering the track. The earth adjacent to the ditch was smouldering and disturbed. There was a wide furrow that increased in depth as it crossed the land. I decided to follow the furrow, which was a foot deep at its inception, and soon only my head was above the ground.\n\nAt the end of the furrow was a three-feet diameter heat blackened ball. I touched it and it powdered to dust and revealed a further ball of a glass-like substance, the size of a baseball. There was an engraving covering the surface of a humanoid subject, but with four arms and a domed head. Etched below this image, was a message in an unknown script. I picked up the ball and found it had a line around the middle with an arrow pointing in a clockwise direction, again with something below it in the same script. I assumed it was an instruction to twist the ball, which I followed. The two halves came apart and something looking like a small egg dropped to the ground and broke open. A handful of worm-like creatures instantly burrowed into the earth beneath, with their four hands shovelling away as they pushed their domed heads into the soft earth. I was too astonished to react quickly and they vanished leaving behind piles of fertile soil. I stood shocked in the furrow holding the two glass-like halves in my burnt hands. The symbols reminiscent of the SETI message etched into the glass like substance.\n\nThe two halves are buried in the ground beneath my bed space in the tent I share with five other illegals. I will retrieve it when we move on and hide it once again. It is my firm belief that it is a message from intelligent life somewhere within the constellation Hercules. These beings hitched an intergalactic voyage on one of the bright fireballs among the Orionids meteor showers. I have concerns that the wormlike creatures with four hands and domed heads will mature in the fertile environment of the Rio Grande Valley and who knows how they will develop. As an illegal I must stay silent. There is a small consolation that sustains me. We are not alone in this cold universe.\n\nRain lashed the railway carriage and the sky darkened and threatened snow as SS Oberscharfurher (Technical Sergeant) Dieter Dornberger arrived at a recently constructed base near Blizna in Poland. Early November did not show the dark pine forests surrounding the raw wooden huts that formed the base in their best light. It was so different to the luxury of his first posting to Peenemunde. For a while there was the possibility of transferring to the underground factories that had been built in a massive hollow cave complex in the Harz mountains in Germany to assemble and construct the new weapon. However, Dieter understood the advantage of his new home, Allied bombers in 1943 did not have the range to carry out strategic bombing. The purpose of his unwilling transfer to Poland was to train him as an operator for the Vergeitungswaffe 2 (Retribution Weapon 2), known technically as Aggregat 4, or in Allied parlance the V-2. His superiors had assigned the weapon to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the mass bombing of German cities.\n\nIt was not until the early spring that Dieter secured a transfer to the city of The Hague on the western coast of the Netherlands on the North Sea. He was assigned to a mobile launching team. Although his posting put him in harm’s way from prowling Allied fighter aircraft it was a joy to be released from the depressive surroundings of East Poland. Dieter also found an attractive Dutch girl, Nellie, to take his mind off the misfortunes of war, little did he know that she was part of the resistance to Nazi rule. The information she gathered in their after love making found its way to allied intelligence sources. Nellie was also unfortunate to gain a child in her search for information, and the girl, Lisa, was born on Valentine’s Day 1945. Dieter did not attend the birth as he was busy that evening firing a V-2 that landed in an outer suburb of London. Nor would Dieter ever know his daughter, as he was hit and killed by machine gun fire from a marauding Allied fighter on his way to the hospital. Nellie fortunately found a fellow resistance fighter, who understood the tribulations of war. He married Nellie when Lisa was one year old, and the war won.\n\nThe V-2 was complex and required hundreds of troops and thirty supporting vehicles. Nellie passed on the location of stockpiles of up to thirty rockets normally located a few kilometres from the actual firing site and the take over procedure by the firing crews. This would involve the use of a huge mobile crane to lift the unfuelled rocket during transfer. A Meillerwagen would raise the A4 vertical on the firing table. The various duties of the firing crews would be carried out at this point. The rocket was aligned and fuelled, with the electronics and gyros set and armed. It took just ninety minutes from the time the rocket was raised, to the time Dieter fired it.\n\nHarry Dover never forgave his parents for not organising his birth date on a more significant day than February 15th. A day earlier and he could have celebrated Lupercalia, a Roman extravaganza. In fact, he was born six hours too late, due to complications at his birth. He regretted that he never had the opportunity to discuss the matter with either of his parents, as his father was killed outright in an air raid on the night of Valentine’s Day. His mother succumbed to her injuries an hour after the ARP warden delivered him into an uncaring world at war. Although unforgiving, Harry reluctantly appreciated his parents, when he was presented with a Trust Fund at his eighteenth, coming of age, birthday party by his father’s mother. She had invested his parent’s assets wisely, including the reparation for the loss of the family home.\n\nIt was the swinging sixties when the world turned from grey to a multi coloured kaleidoscope. Harry was a student at the LSE off Regent Street with the lure of Carnaby Street on his doorstep. He lodged in a dingy attic flat in Soho two floors above a greengrocer’s shop, and on the floor between, the premises of a publisher of material that awaited the outcome of Lady Chatterley’s Lover, pornography without the intent to corrupt. With some of the proceeds of his Trust Fund he invested in the purchase of the freehold of the run-down premises in Soho rather than pay rent to an uncaring and absent landlord. The price was low as the two existing tenants had protection of regulated tenancies.\n\nOn the morning of his twenty second birthday Harry woke with the taste and smell of Bacardi and Coke mixed with cheap Mateus Rose in his mouth and forcing itself out of the major glands that make up the endocrine system. He had sent a Valentine Card to his Grandmother and promised to see her at the weekend when he made his annual visit to his parents’ grave. In eight weeks, he would be finished at the LSE and had not yet decided what to do with the rest of his life. He knew he didn’t want to join one of the burgeoning city firms who were extracting money from the market by advising on the plethora of takeovers by ruthless asset stripping moguls. In Soho he lived in the middle of the creative side of the British film business and played with the thought of making a career in the industry. He had a friend who ran the UK publicity for an American film company and as a result was invited to many major film publicity events and parties. Last night was such an event in celebration of a film whose title he had already forgotten, but with an association to Valentine’s Day.\n\nHe showered, shaved, and put on his favourite denim shirt, jeans and slipped into his lightweight camel Crombie with velvet collar; drank coffee; and decided to have breakfast at the greasy spoon in the market. He collided with her as he leapt around the corner of the stairs on the first floor. They fell into a tangle on the shining lino on the landing outside the publisher’s office. A portfolio of artwork spilt from a shoulder bag over the floor. As they sorted themselves out, they both started to apologise until he noticed a ladder and a scratch leaking blood on her stocking that ran up below her fashionable mini skirt.\n\n‘Are you OK. Your leg is bleeding.’ He pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket and tried to wipe away the stain.\n\nShe slapped his hand away and tried to cover the spot. ‘How will I be able to go for my audition looking like this.’ Her English was good but had an accent that he couldn’t place.\n\n‘You have an audition? With this publisher?’ Harry pointed at the office door.\n\n‘Yes, at ten o’clock.’\n\n‘Do you mean an audition? This is a publisher’s office.’\n\n‘I am tired and maybe my English is not so accurate. I have come here from Holland by train to see the editor.’\n\n‘I’m sorry to tell you that will not be possible. He was arrested yesterday by the Obscene Books squad and will be in court tomorrow for refusing to withdraw his latest publication.’\n\n‘I am here to show my illustrations for a book.’ She started to pick up the artwork on the floor and Harry could see they were line drawings of people in a variety of nude poses. ‘I spoke to him on the phone two days ago and he asked me to bring my original artwork. I have a contract to publish with his company.’ In her despair she started to pull a document from her shoulder bag. Harry put his hand out and held her arm.\n\n‘I am sorry, but I don’t think that is worth the paper it’s written on. The last time he was arrested he got three months, this time it’s bound to be more.’ Harry was fortunate as the publisher always paid the modest six month’s rent in advance; pornography was profitable but risk laden. ‘I’m on my way to breakfast, it’s my birthday, would you like to join me?’\n\nShe had finished gathering the artwork and put it in her shoulder bag. She looked at him and for a few moments, she was uncertain, but she needed to know more about her publisher contact. ‘Thank you, you are so kind. It was my birthday yesterday.’\n\nHarry let her lead the way down the stairs and liked what he saw, slim built with light blonde hair in a French pleat with a few strands loosened by her fall. He decided that the greasy spoon might not be suitable and decided on the Waldorf, well known for its afternoon teas, but also a great place to eat breakfast in Edwardian splendour. He took her arm as they reached the street and guided her gently towards the Aldwych.\n\nBreakfast morphed into a guided tour of London and a discussion on birthdays, family, and relationships. As the afternoon waned and heavy clouds scuttled across a darkening sky, they arrived back at Harry’s attic flat and he admired her artwork as they drank tea. Almost a reverse of the ‘come up and see my etchings line.’\n\n‘Where are you staying in London?’ The question had been on Harry’s mind since their discussion about the future.\n\n‘I am booked on the ferry from Harwich at ten o’clock this evening, it takes seventy-five minutes from Liverpool Street.’\n\n‘Would you be offended if I asked you to stay here for a few days? I have a pull-out bed I can sleep on. You can have mine.’\n\n‘Harry, thank you for the offer. You are so kind, but I must be back in The Hague in the morning. I have students booked for lessons, and I cannot let them down. I have had a wonderful day. London is so exciting. Please will you let me show you my own city sometime soon. Can you spare time at Easter if you finish your dissertation? Now I must go Harry.’\n\n‘That offer makes me certain that I’ll do whatever is necessary to join you at Easter, but now let me get a Taxi.’\n\n‘No Harry, you have already been so generous. I will get a bus to the station.’ She stood and picked up her shoulder bag with the artwork. He took her hands in his and gently kissed her cheek and she reciprocated. They looked at each other and it seemed natural that she came into his arms and hugged him. ‘Goodbye Harry.’\n\nLisa walked down the flights of stairs, her mind a jumble of disparate thoughts, mainly wondering what she would tell her fiancé about the day, and into a busy street. She naturally looked left and stepped into the road. Harry heard the horn on the lorry and the squeal of brakes."
