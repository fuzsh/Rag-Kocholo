        "text": "On November 21, 1914, Ahmed Cemal Pasha departed Istanbul's Haydarpaşa railway station for Damascus. A few weeks prior to his departure—after the Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of Germany and Austria-Hungary on October 29—Enver Pasha, the minister of war, invited Cemal Pasha to his mansion. At this meeting, Enver Pasha requested that Cemal Pasha, who was then minister of the navy, take up the post of governor-general of the Greater Syrian provinces and assume command of the Fourth Army. Cemal Pasha enthusiastically accepted Enver Pasha's offer to, in his words, “prepare for and carry out an attack on the (Suez) Canal, and also to maintain security and internal order in (Greater) Syria.”Footnote 1 He secured his existing ministerial post in addition to gaining full authority as the commander of the Fourth Army and governor of the Greater Syrian provinces. Before his train departed from Haydarpaşa, Cemal Pasha addressed the crowd who had gathered there to see him, describing his mission as the “divine but extraordinarily difficult” duty of “saving Egypt from British invaders.”Footnote 2\n\nUpon his arrival in Damascus, Cemal Pasha devoted himself to “execute[ing] the Egyptian expedition along with the defense of Syria.”Footnote 3 He wrote to Istanbul that he would personally command the campaign and do whatever necessary to address the issue of provisions for the army's march across the Sinai Desert; the same march that had thwarted the first expedition.Footnote 4 However, the Ottoman military expedition he commanded in January–February 1915 failed, leading the Fourth Army's Ottoman and German military leadership to conclude that any prospect of success would first require overcoming the Sinai Desert's inhospitable environment, climate, and topography in order to transport soldiers to the canal and supply them with water and food. Following the failed attack, the Ottoman army retreated from the Suez Canal to Beersheba. In what followed, Ottoman decision makers—Cemal Pasha first and foremost—together with German and Austrian military colleagues, waged war on the desert from February 1915 to January 1917, between the failures of the first and second Suez expeditions.\n\nThe war on the desert involved the militarization of the Sinai landscape through various modes of manipulation, including the construction of railways and motorways, the digging of wells and canals, and the creation of military settlements with lines of communication, arsenals, hospitals, storehouses, and water pools, all of which were geared towards facilitating the Ottoman army's passage and provisioning for the Suez expedition.Footnote 5 This undertaking relied on four main inputs to proceed. The first was the continuous transfer of funds from the Ottoman treasuries or German cash reserves to the Fourth Army. In addition to purchasing materials, a significant proportion of bank deposits to the Fourth Army were used to pay private contractors. The second main input was what I term the “Ottoman military-environmental complex,” a partnership between the army and private contractors. The Fourth Army's organizational and logistical capacity came to depend on a class of people I describe as “war contractors,” who secured concessions and money in advance to supply the army with camels, grain, and timber, as well as to accomplish infrastructural construction work in the Sinai Desert.Footnote 6 Third, the military leadership relied on and incorporated local Bedouin mobility and knowledge of the desert geography, topography, and environment into “explorations of the desert” to identify water sources and establish sufficient roads.Footnote 7 Last but not least, accomplishing infrastructural projects in the desert necessitated the appropriation of human, animal, and environmental energy.Footnote 8 The war on the desert, ultimately, relied on the Ottoman authorities’ exploitation and extraction of human and animal labor, agricultural crops, wood, and materials from Greater Syrian provinces alongside their mobilization into the Sinai to prepare the desert environment and topography for warfare at the Suez Canal.\n\nThis article, therefore, traces the energy flows involved in this process of militarizing the Sinai Desert to uncover how Ottoman-German militarism during the war included increasing state intervention in certain environments and the social, economic, and ecological consequences of such interventions in other environments. In particular, I examine the transport of forced human labor and wood resources from Greater Syria to the Sinai Desert. Expanding railways, constructing motorways, introducing a series of military outpost lines, and piping water into the desert all relied on the “somatic energy regime”—John R. McNeill's term for energy resources comprised primarily of human and animal muscle power.Footnote 9 The Fourth Army conscripted thousands of laborers from Greater Syria and relocated them to the desert. Most of these people suffered from heat, malnutrition, and disease; many succumbed to these conditions and died to accomplish these major infrastructural transformations in a short duration of time. Construction in the desert—especially of crossties for the new railway lines—relied on wood extracted from the forestlands of Greater Syria. Moreover, railway networks facilitated an energy supply chain between the Greater Syrian provinces and the Sinai Desert. Due to a lack of reliable coal supplies, railways carried goods, materials, and manpower to the desert using wood fuel, further depleting the forest resources of Greater Syria.\n\nRecent scholarship on the Ottoman provinces of Greater Syria during World War I has provided us with a detailed picture of the coercive nature of Ottoman rule and how inhabitants experienced and responded to the wartime difficulties, first and foremost to the food crisis and famine in the provinces of Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.Footnote 10 Research on the war between the Ottoman and British forces at the Suez Canal and in the Sinai Desert has documented the military history of this theater of the war.Footnote 11 Existing scholarship, however, has not fully revealed the deeply entangled relationship between life (and death), economy, and ecology in Greater Syria and combat on the Suez front. This article explicates the importance of this relationship by demonstrating that the war on the Sinai Desert turned Greater Syria into what I term a “sacrificial frontier.”\n\nMy framing of Greater Syria as a “sacrificial frontier” of the Sinai Desert during World War I builds on the use of the term “sacrifice zone” in environmental studies. Coined by US government officials during the Cold War, this term designated areas polluted by the mining and processing of uranium into nuclear weapons. Steve Lerner then expanded the term to “include a broader array of fenceline communities or hot spots of chemical pollution where residents live immediately adjacent to heavily polluting industries or military bases.”Footnote 12 I now further expand the term to include military authority decisions to designate regions as exploitable to achieve military objectives in other regions. The term “sacrifice zone” is used to describe the gradual and long-term harm caused by concentrated pollution and toxicity on communities living near such sites. With the term “sacrificial frontier,” I aim to highlight the active decisions made by military leaders to designate Greater Syria as a region for the militarized extraction of resources. The potential success of the second Suez expedition, for the Ottoman-German military leadership, relied on the army's easier and faster transportation to the Suez through the desert. This necessitated, in their perception, the domination of Sinai's topography, climate, and environment through the construction of new infrastructure, requiring a constant supply of laborers, animals, and wood. Greater Syria was designated as the sacrificial frontier whose human, animal, natural, and material resources were to be extracted for the sake of the war on the desert, which needed to be transformed into a gateway for the conquest of Egypt."
