        "text": "Recently my attention was drawn to a tiny place in the Sharon Hills. I was given information regarding an Ottoman military cemetery at that place, info that sounded wrong for several reasons, but still – I managed to find the place, today in the middle of an agricultural area. It is defiantly the remnants of an old cemetery, but no way that is an Ottoman military cemetery! At the place there’s a strange combination of Bedouin & Arab burial practices. However, even before visiting the place, I was very suspicious about it being connected to an Ottoman military cemetery, as it was too far (A few miles) from the line held by the Ottomans up to December 19th 1917 (Eve of the Battle of Jaffa), and it was already in British hands on December 22nd. When I reached the place, I suddenly remembered that in this area should be a place called Sheikh Balluta, and that many times, especially with Bedouin tribes, the traditional burial place of a notable sheikh will become a cemetery. I contacted a friend who is an expert about the spread-out and local culture of the Arabs of the Sharon, and he confirmed that this place is indeed Sheikh Balluta, on the western edge of the area where a Bedouin tribe called Abu-Kishak was dwelling. I’m still trying to find the original source of the info that this place was an Ottoman military cemetery. Maybe (A huge maybe) some ottoman soldiers were buried there by the 5th Royal Scots Fusiliers, after the event I’m about to describe.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I had this vague memory of coming across the name Sheikh Balluta in connection to The Battle of Jaffa. Bingo!\n\nI’m starting with the OBH (Falls, Egypt & Palestine, Vol. 2, Part 1, p. 274-275): “The establishment of the general line Qibye–Rantye–Fejja–Mulebbis–Tell el Mukhmar–Sheikh Balluta–Jlil, the objective set to the XXI Corps by G.H.Q., was to be carried out on the 22nd December” (p. 274). The following refers to the 52nd (Lowland) Division on December 22nd - “At 9 a.m. the division, with all three brigades in line, moved forward in artillery formation, followed by the artillery. The latter was obliged (Because of deep mud – Eran) to use eight-horse teams, so that only four guns or three howitzers per battery could take part in the advance. The line Ferrikhiye–Jlil was reached without opposition” (p. 275). Ferrikhiye is on the south bank of the Auja stream, North of Mulebbis (Petach Tikva), near Tell el Mukhmar. The reason I highlighted ‘without opposition’ will become clear in a minute.\n\nThen I moved to the 52nd Divisional History (Thompson, p 498). Double Bingo!! “The general direction of the 155th Brigade was to the east-north-east (Starting from Hadrah – Eran) across the new northern line of the 54th Division. In the centre, the 156th Brigade was advancing to the north-east, and on the left, the 157th Brigade to the north-north-east”. And a few lines below: “Here and there the enemy were entrenched, but in a few places was there any opposition. Heavy rifle-fire was opened on the 155th Brigade by some Turks on high ground at Sheikh el Balluta to its left. Gen. Pollok-M’Call sent the 5th R.S.F. at them, under Lt.-Col. R. W. Paton, excellent covering fire given by a section of the 155th Company’s machine-guns under Lieut. Anderson. The Fusiliers went straight up the slopes under a harassing fire, and dislodged 400 Turkish cavalry, a force as strong as themselves, which made off to some woods a mile away”.\n\n‘The History of the Royal Scots Fusiliers’ was a disappointment. Very general, covering a vast span of years, which explains why the description of the Great War is very poor as far as details are concerned. I don’t know if the RSF in general or the 5th R.S.F. in particular published a Great War history. Does anyone know about that? And/or are their War Diaries available?\n\nHere a few maps. The first is an excellent one, from the 52nd Divisional History (Sorry, had to reduce it...):\n\nSection of the above map:\n\nSheikh Balluta (or el Balluta) can be seen in later maps, including maps 19 and 20 of the BOH (Falls). However, I chose to bring this part of a July 1918 map. For reference - El Jlil is on the left (Kibutz Glil-Yam today), Sabiyeh (Upper right) was the name used for the Jewish colony of Kfar Saba (Probably to separate it from nearby Arab Kufr Saba. Today Sabiyeh is in the center of modern Kfar Saba). Sheikh Balluta is at this stage (July 1918) a bit behind the front line, underneath the C in the center of the map.\n\nIf anyone can add details (battalion books, personal diaries, war diaries etc') - Please!!\n\nKeep well and healthy!\n\nEran"
