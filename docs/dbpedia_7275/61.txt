Avant Window Navigator (abbreviated AWN or Awn) is a dock-like bar for Linux, which sits at the bottom of a user's screen and tracks open windows. Instead of representing open windows as buttons or segments on a bar, it uses icons to minimize screen space and add visual appeal. Avant Window Navigator was created by Neil J. Patel and is currently in the beta stages of development.

Both the appearance and functionality of Avant Window Navigator may be customized, and plugins and applets are available, such as to display the progress of a download in Mozilla Firefox or to control a music player like Rhythmbox.[1] The plugins use the D-Bus IPC system, and applets can be written in C, Python, or Vala. There is a sister project, AWN Extras, which is a collection of community-contributed applets and plugins. Its releases are usually kept in sync with AWN.

One of the major requirements to run Avant Window Navigator is a composited environment. Therefore, the user is required to install a compositor[2], such as Compiz, which could tax performance on low-end systems. An interesting alternative is to use Xfce, a very light window manager that since version 4.2.0 has a compositing manager. Support for non-composited environments is planned for a future release.[3][4][5]
