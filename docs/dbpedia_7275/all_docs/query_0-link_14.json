This page tries to list some of these programs.\n\nDesktops[]\n\nROX[]\n\nHomepage: http://roscidus.com/desktop/\n\nROX is a fast, user friendly desktop which makes extensive use of drag-and-drop. The interface revolves around the file manager, or filer, following the traditional Unix view that \"everything is a file\" rather than trying to hide the filesystem beneath start menus, wizards, or druids. The aim is to make a system that is well designed and clearly presented. The ROX style favours using several small programs together instead of creating all-in-one mega-applications.\n\niDesk[]\n\nHomepage: http://idesk.sourceforge.net/\n\niDesk gives users of minimal wm's icons on their desktop. The icon graphics are either from a png or svg (vector) file and support some eyecandy effects like transparency. Each icon can be confgured to run one or more shell commands and the actions which run those commands are completely configurable. In a nutshell if you want icons on your desktop and you don't have or dont't want KDE or gnome doing it, you can use iDesk.\n\nPanels[]\n\nwbar[]\n\nHomepage: http://code.google.com/p/wbar/\n\nwbar is a quick launch bar. It's developed with speed in mind and is highly tweakable.\n\nA new version is being written to use evas as the canvas engine. It's not yet feature complete but has better transparency support: wbar\n\nlxpanel[]\n\nHomepage: http://wiki.lxde.org/en/LXPanel\n\nLXPanel is a lightweight X11 desktop panel. It contains:\n\nUser-friendly application menu automatically generated from *.desktop files on the system.\n\nLauncher bar (Small icons clicked to launch apps)\n\nTask bar supporting urgency hint (Can flash when gaim gets new incoming messages)\n\nNotification area (System tray)\n\nDigital clock\n\nRun dialog (A dialog let you type a command and run, can be called in external programs)\n\nNet status icon plug-in (optional, ported from gnome-netstatus-applet)\n\nVolume control plug-in (optional, written by jserv)\n\nlxpanelctl, an external controller let you control lxpanel in other programs. For example, \"lxpanelctl run\" will show the Run dialog in lxpanel, and \"lxpanelctl menu\" will show the application menu. This is useful in key bindings provided by window managers.\n\nPerlPanel[]\n\nHomepage: http://directory.fsf.org/project/PerlPanel/\n\nPerlPanel is an attempt to build a useable, lean panel program (like the Gnome Panel or the KDE Kicker) in Perl, using the Gtk2-Perl libraries.\n\nPerlPanel is the ideal accompaniment to a light-weight Window Manager or a desktop-drawing program like iDesk.\n\nMost of PerlPanel's features are provided by applets - simple widgets that each do a different job. PerlPanel currently ships with 36 different applets, some of which can be seen on the applets page.\n\nfbpanel[]\n\nHomepage: http://fbpanel.sourceforge.net/\n\nfbpanel is a lightweight, NETWM compliant desktop panel. It works with any NETWM compliant window manager. It provides\n\nvariety of plugins:\n\ntaskbar\n\npager\n\n'show desktop' button\n\nlaunchbar\n\nimage viewer\n\nclock\n\ntray (notification area)\n\nmenu with support for freedesktop.org (as in GNOME/KDE) applications menu\n\nspace filler\n\ncpu monitor\n\nability to replace window icons\n\nall icons follow your current GTK+ icon theme\n\ntransparency support\n\ncustomizable size and screen position\n\nability to run many instances each with its own configuration\n\nmodest resource usage\n\nPyPanel[]\n\nHomepage: http://pypanel.sourceforge.net/\n\nPyPanel is a lightweight panel/taskbar written in Python and C for X11 window managers. It can be easily customized to match any desktop theme or taste. PyPanel works with EWMH compliant WMs (Openbox, PekWM, FVWM, etc.) and is distributed under the GNU General Public License v2.\n\nSome of the customizable features include:\n\nTransparency with shading/tinting\n\nPanel dimensions, location and layout\n\nFont type and colors with Xft and shadow support\n\nButton events/actions\n\nClock and workspace name display\n\nSystem Tray (Notification Area)\n\nAutohiding\n\nApplication Launcher\n\nCustom Application Icons\n\nBarPanel[]\n\nHomepage: http://www.ossproject.org/projects/barpanel\n\nBarPanel is a powerful desktop panel that enables you to have all you want just one-click-far. It is extensible through plugins and is fully themeable. Barpanel is a continuation of the work done in the Foopanel project.\n\nSome notable differences to other similar panels (such as eg. XFCE and GNOME panels):\n\nIt is written in Python\n\nIt does not depend on desktop environment libraries\n\nMost (or all) of the functionality is available as plugins\n\nEasily extendable through Python plugins\n\nEasily themeable\n\nAvant Window Navigator[]\n\nHomepage: https://launchpad.net/awn\n\nRelated Link: Enabling transparency\n\nAvant Window Navigator (Awn) is a dock-like bar which sits at the bottom of the screen. It has support for launchers, task lists, and third party applets.\n\nIt requires an Composited (3D) Environment. Furthermore it supports a set of fancy 3D Effects.\n\nstalonetray[]\n\nHomepage: http://stalonetray.sourceforge.net/\n\nStalonetray is a stand-alone system tray (notification area) for X Window System/X11 (e.g. XOrg or XFree86). It has minimal build and run-time dependencies: an X11 lib only. Stalonetray works with virtually any EWMH-compliant window manager.\n\nPagers[]\n\nscreenpager[]\n\nHomepage: http://zelea.com/project/screenpager/introduction.html\n\nScreenpager is a screenwise pager for X workstations running Xinerama. It works like a desktop pager, but acts at the level of screens. Instead of paging the desktop as a whole, it can page each screen independently, or move pages from screen to screen.\n\nOBPager[]\n\nHomepage: http://obpager.sourceforge.net/\n\nOBPager is a lightweight pager designed to be used with NetWM-compliant window managers.\n\nUnlike many other pagers out there, OBPager has very few dependencies, requiring only Xlib and glibc++ (no Gnome or KDE necessary).\n\nSawfish-pager[]\n\nsee SawfishPager\n\nWidgets[]\n\nScreenlets[]\n\nHomepage: http://hendrik.kaju.pri.ee/screenlets/?q=node/14\n\nScreenlets are small owner-drawn applications (written in Python, a very simple object-oriented programming-language) that can be described as \"the virtual representation of things lying/standing around on your desk\". Sticknotes, clocks, rulers, ... the possibilities are endless. The goal of the Screenlets base-class(es) is to simplify the creation of fully themeable mini-apps that each solve basic desktop-work-related needs and generally improve the usability and eye-candy of the modern Linux-desktop.\n\ngDesklets[]\n\nHomepage: http://gdesklets.de/\n\ngDesklets is a system for bringing mini programs (desklets), such as weather forecasts, news tickers, system information displays, or music player controls, onto your desktop, where they are sitting there in a symbiotic relationship of eye candy and usefulness. The possibilities are really endless and they are always there to serve you whenever you need them, just one key-press away. The system is not restricted to one desktop environment, but currently works on most of the modern Unix desktops.\n\nadesklets[]\n\nHomepage: http://adesklets.sourceforge.net/\n\nadesklets is an interactive Imlib2 console for the X Window System. It provides scripted languages with a clean and simple way to write great looking, mildly interactive desktop integrated graphic applets (aka “desklets”).\n\nIt can also be used as a command line oriented graphic editor, a bit similar to ImageMagick , but with different functionality.\n\nStatus monitors[]\n\nGKrellM[]\n\nHomepage: http://www.gkrellm.net/\n\nThe GNU Krell Monitors are a single process stack of system monitors which supports applying themes to match its appearance to your window manager, Gtk, or any other theme.\n\nConky[]\n\nHomepage: http://conky.sourceforge.net/\n\nConky is a system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code. Since it's original conception, Conky has changed a fair bit from it's predecessor. Conky can display just about anything, either on your root desktop or in it's own window. Conky has many built-in objects, as well as the ability to execute programs and scripts, then display the output from stdout.\n\n[]\n\nHomepage: http://bbtools.sourceforge.net/\n\nBB-tools are a number of simple X-Window programs to display the status of different resources. The style and part of the code is copied from Blackbox a small and extremely fast X11-Windowmanager. Although the programs are written to be used with Blackbox, they should work in any other X11-Windowmanager."
