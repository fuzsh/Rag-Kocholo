In addition to launchers that can be dragged onto the bar, it features a taskbar that behaves similarly to the Mac OS X dock. The window navigator uses the composite extension for transparency and other effects.\n\nIt can be used for anything from the launching of simple programs to complex multi-tasking. This application compares to The Mac OS X dock in functionality, allowing the user to specify its position on the screen.\n\nThe look and feel are fully customizable, and theming support is also available.\n\nFeatures include:\n\nBased on the workspace concept, but the space is two dimensional.\n\nCustomise the bar:\n\nChoose between two ‘engines’:\n\nGlass engine. All the gradients can be changed to your taste\n\nPattern engine.\n\nThe border & internal border colours can be changed.\n\nThe ‘glow’ (the background of an active window icon) can be changed, to be as simple or as lavish as you need.\n\nChoose between sharp or rounded corners.\n\nChoose the text & shadow colour of the window title text.\n\nEach time you move to a new, unvisited workspace, a terminal window is automatically launched, emulating TTYs’ behavior.\n\nDelete an entire workspace, killing all the window launched in it.\n\nDelete an entire dimension, deleting all the residing workspaces.\n\nOrder windows on the fly.\n\nProc-like interface.\n\nLaunchers.\n\nTask lists.\n\nPlugins:\n\nMusic software: Audacious, Rhythmbox, Banshee, Exaile, Quod Libet, and Amarok.\n\nInternet software: Deluge,Pidgin, XChat, and Epiphany.\n\nAwn Extras provides a number of important applets (not unlike the panel applets for GNOME and Xfce) in a single package, along with a number of plugins that allow applications to better interface with Awn’s task manager. These applets range from a Trash applet to fancy workspace switcher.\n\nWebsite: github.com/p12tic/awn\n\nSupport:\n\nDeveloper: Neil Jagdish Patel, haytjes, Miika-Petteri Matikainen, Anthony Arobone, Ryan Rushton, Michal Hruby, Julien Lavergne, Mark Lee, Rodney Cryderman\n\nLicense: GNU General Public License v2.0\n\nAwn is written in C++. Learn C++ with our recommended free books and free tutorials.\n\nReturn to Application Launchers | Return to Docks"
