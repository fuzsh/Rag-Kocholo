It will be supported with security updates until October 2010.\n\nHow to find out which version of Ubuntu you're using\n\nOpen the command terminal and type:\n\nlsb_release -a\n\nHow to find out which kernel you are using\n\nuname -r\n\nNewer Versions of Ubuntu\n\nUbuntu has a six month release cycle, with releases in April and October.\n\nKarmic Koala (9.10), scheduled for release in October 2009. This will not be an LTS version.\n\n(10.04 LTS), scheduled for release in April 2010, will be the next LTS (Long-term support) version.\n\nOlder Versions of Ubuntu\n\nIntrepid Ibex (8.10) (supported until April 2010)\n\nHardy Heron (8.04 LTS) (Long Term Support version with desktop support until April 2011 and server support until April 2013)\n\nGutsy Gibbon (7.10) (no longer supported)\n\nFeisty Fawn (7.04) (no longer supported)\n\nDapper Drake (6.06 LTS) (Long Term Support version with desktop support until June 2009 and server support until June 2011)\n\nGeneral Notes\n\nUbuntuguide is unofficial and is not associated with Canonical Ltd.\n\nUbuntu allows a user to accomplish tasks from either a menu-driven Graphical User Interface (GUI) or from a text-based command-line interface (CLI). In Ubuntu, the command-line-interface terminal is called Terminal, which is started: Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal.\n\nText inside the grey dotted box like this should be put into the command-line Terminal.\n\nMany changes to the operating system can only be done by a User with Administrative privileges. 'sudo' elevates a User's privileges to the Administrator level temporarily (i.e. when installing programs or making changes to the system). Example:\n\nsudo bash\n\n'gksudo' should be used instead of 'sudo' when opening a Graphical Application through the \"Run Command\" dialog box. Example:\n\ngksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n\"man\" command can be used to find help manual for a command. For example, \"man sudo\" will display the manual page for the \"sudo\" command:\n\nman sudo\n\nWhile \"apt-get\" and \"aptitude\" are fast ways of installing programs/packages, you can also use the Synaptic Package Manager, a GUI method for installing programs/packages. Most (but not all) programs/packages available with apt-get install will also be available from the Synaptic Package Manager. In this guide, when you see\n\nsudo apt-get install package\n\nyou can search for package in Synaptic and install it that way.\n\n\"Applications\" means the bottom-left (or upper-left) button, akin to the Start button in Microsoft Windows.\n\nIf you are using the 64-bit version, replace any \"i386\" with \"amd64\"\n\nInstalling Ubuntu\n\nHardware requirements\n\nUbuntu Jaunty Jackalope runs well with as little as 384 Mb RAM. (The installer requires a minimum of 256 Mb RAM, while the alternative installer can run using only 192 Mb RAM.) Netbooks can run Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope.\n\nThe install takes between 3-4 Gb hard drive space, and 8 - 10 Gb will be needed to run comfortably.\n\nIf you have an older computer with less memory than this, consider Xubuntu (if between 256 Mb and 512 Mb RAM) or PuppyLinux or DSL (if less than 256 Mb RAM).\n\nFresh Installation\n\nDownload the latest ISO image from Ubuntu 9.04. See this guide for burning the ISO image to a CD.\n\nUse the CD for installation.\n\nDual-Booting Windows and Ubuntu\n\nRarely, a user may experience problems dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows. In general, a Windows OS should be installed first, because its bootloader is very particular. A Windows installation usually occupies the entire hard drive, so the partition needs to be shrunk, creating free space for the Ubuntu partition. (You should clean up unnecessary files and defragment the drive before resizing.) The Windows partition can be resized from within Windows Vista using the shrink/resize option in the Administrative Tools --> Disk Management tool. If using Windows XP (or other Windows OS), use GParted partition manager to shrink the Windows partition and thereby leave free space on the hard drive for the Ubuntu partition. If done this way, there is no problem installing Ubuntu as the second operating system and it is done automatically from the Ubuntu LiveCD. Allow the Ubuntu LiveCD to install to \"largest available free space.\"\n\nA Windows partition should be at least 20 Gb (recommended 30 Gb), and a Ubuntu partition at least 10 Gb (recommended 20 Gb). Obviously, if you have plenty of disk space, make the partition for whichever will be your favoured operating system larger. For a perspective on other partitioning schemes, see this Psychocats Guide to Partitioning.\n\nAlternatives include:\n\nWubi (Windows-based Ubuntu Installer), an officially supported dual-boot installer that allows Ubuntu to be run mounted in a virtual-disk within the Windows environment (which can cause a slight degradation in performance). Because the installation requires an intact functioning Windows system, it is recommended to install Ubuntu in this manner for short-term evaluation purposes only. A permanent Ubuntu installation should be installed in its own partition, with its own filesystem, and should not rely on Windows.\n\nEasyBCD, a free Windows-based program that allows you to dual-boot Windows Vista and Ubuntu (as well as other operating systems) by configuring the Vista bootloader.\n\nUse Startup Manager to change Grub settings\n\nGrub is the bootup utility that controls which OS to load by default and other bootup settings. You can change Grub settings from the Startup Manager:\n\nSystem -> Administration -> Startup Manager\n\nIf Startup Manager is not installed, install it:\n\nsudo apt-get install startupmanager\n\nNote: You can also edit the Grub settings manually from the command-line interface.\n\nDual-Booting Mac OS X and Ubuntu\n\nMac OS X has a similar structure to Linux (it is BSD Unix based). Dual-booting Mac OS X and Ubuntu detailed instructions can be found here.\n\nInstalling Mac OS X after Ubuntu\n\nIf you decide to dual boot with OS X, choose ext2 as your partition type during the Ubuntu installation. (For this the Super Grub Disk CD is a useful utility. You can download the Super Grub .iso image file at forjamari.linex.org and burn the image to a CD-ROM.)\n\nOnce you have installed Ubuntu, edit the Grub start-up list:\n\nsudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst\n\nand add the following lines:\n\ntitle Mac OS X root (hd0,0) makeactive chainloader +1\n\nReboot your Mac and go to the terminal in Max OS X (if you have any issues booting, boot from your Mac OS X DVD). Press F8 and enter -s. Enter:\n\nfdisk -e /dev/rdisk0 flag 2 <--note that flag 2 is my Mac partition number two quit y reboot\n\nIf are still unsure whether it is working correctly, use the Super Grub Disk CD and make grub active.\n\nInstalling Ubuntu after Mac OS X\n\nIf you get an error message during boot such as HFS+error in the bootloader, you can also use the Super Grub Disk for recovering Linux GRUB and the Windows MBR (Master Boot Record).\n\nOnce you have installed Ubuntu, edit the Grub start-up list:\n\nsudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst\n\nand add the following lines:\n\ntitle Mac OS X root (hd0,0) makeactive chainloader +1\n\nIf you have issues with Mac OSX or Windows in GRUB, try changing the Mac OS X Grub entry\n\nchange root (hd0,0) to root (hd0,1)\n\nThis means you will boot into partition number 1. You can try any partition number until you get it right.\n\nUpgrading Intrepid to Jaunty\n\nIf you are using an older version of Ubuntu, you may wish to upgrade to Jaunty. A new installation is recommended to prevent software bloat.\n\nIt is possible to do a distribution upgrade using Synaptic by clicking on the \"Full Upgrade option.\"\n\nAlternatively, use the update-manager (all editions):\n\nsudo apt-get install update-manager sudo update-manager -d\n\nYou can also use:\n\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nScreenshots of the upgrade process are available at UbuntuGeek upgrade guide.\n\nReinstalling applications after a fresh install\n\nIf you upgrade your Ubuntu system with a fresh install, it is possible to mark the packages and services installed on your old system (prior to the upgrade) and save the settings (\"markings\") into a file. Then install the new version of Ubuntu and allow the system to reinstall packages and services using the settings saved in the \"markings\" file. For instructions, see this Ubuntu forum thread. In brief:\n\nOn the old system: Synaptic Package Manager -> File -> Save Markings\n\nSave the markings file to an external medium, such as USB drive.\n\nComplete the backup of your system's other important files (e.g. the /home directory) before the fresh install of the new system.\n\nIn the freshly installed new system, again open Synaptic Package Manager -> File -> Read markings and load the file on your USB drive (or other external storage) previously saved.\n\nNote: Many packages, dependencies, and compatibilities change between version of Ubuntu, so this method does not always work. Automated updates remains the recommended method.\n\nUbuntu Resources\n\nUbuntu Forums has a large community for online solutions and specific help.\n\nUbuntuGeek's Tutorials, Howto's and Tips -- a collection of random tips in blog format\n\nGnome Project\n\nGnome is the default desktop in Ubuntu.\n\nUbuntu Screenshots and Screencasts\n\nThere are old screenshots available at:\n\nPhorolinux Screenshots Gallery\n\nNew screenshots of 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope:\n\nModified Ubuntu Theme screenshot\n\nThe Coding Studio Ubuntu Screenshots\n\nUbuntu Videos at DailyMotion\n\nNew Applications Resources\n\nGetDeb - Features the latest versions of software available from the official repositories as well as software not available in the official repositories. Available in easy-to-install .deb files (see Apt and Package Basics).\n\nTop 100 Open source Applications\n\nOther *buntu guides and help manuals\n\nKubuntuguide\n\nXubuntu Desktop Guide -- Xubuntu can run with as little as 256 Mb RAM. It is better for older machines with limited resources.\n\nAdd Extra Ubuntu Repositories\n\nSoftware packages and programs are freely available for download at multiple online sites with standardized structures, called repositories. There are repositories officially sanctioned and monitored by the Kubuntu/Ubuntu developer community, while other repositories are independently provided, without official sanction or supervision (and should be used with caution). Additional information is available from the Ubuntu Repository Guide.\n\nTypes of Repositories\n\nThere are four major package repository types in Ubuntu:\n\nmain - Supported by Canonical. This is the major part of the distribution.\n\nrestricted - Software not licensed under the GPL (or similar software license), but supported by Canonical.\n\nuniverse - Software licensed under the GPL (or similar license) and supported by users.\n\nmultiverse - Software not licensed under the GPL (or similar license), but supported by users.\n\nThere are also these additional types of repositories:\n\njaunty-updates - Updates to official packages.\n\njaunty-backports - Current version software from Jaunty+1 (Karmic) that have been backported to Jaunty Jackalope.\n\njaunty-proposed - Proposed updates & changes (bleeding edge stuff).\n\nThird party repositories\n\nSoftware developers often maintain their own repositories, from which software packages can be downloaded and installed directly to your computer (if you add the repository to your list). Many of these third party repositories and software packages have never been reviewed by the (K)Ubuntu/Debian community and can present a security risk to your computer. Trojans, backdoors, and other malicious software can be present at any unregulated repository. When using repositories not endorsed by the (K)ubuntu/Debian community, make sure you have utter confidence in that site before enabling the repository and installing a software package from it.\n\nAdd Repositories using Synaptic Package Manager\n\nThis is the preferred method.\n\nSystem -> Administration -> Synaptic Manager -> Settings -> Repositories.\n\nHere you can enable the repositories for Ubuntu Software and Third Party Software.\n\nFor Third Party Software select Add -> enter the repository's address. It will have a format similar to:\n\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty main restricted deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty main restricted\n\nExample: To add the Medibuntu repository, Add:\n\ndeb http://packages.medibuntu.org/ jaunty free non-free\n\nDownload the repository key to a folder.\n\nExample: The Medibuntu key can be downloaded from\n\nhttp://packages.medibuntu.org/medibuntu-key.gpg\n\nThen add the key from:\n\nSystem -> Administration -> Synaptic Manager -> Settings -> Repositories -> Authentication -> Import Key File...\n\n(Alternatively, you can manually add the key from the command line Terminal. See Add Repository keys.)\n\nRefresh the package list from the new repository:\n\nSynaptic -> Reload\n\nManually add repositories\n\nDo this at your own risk. Modify the default Ubuntu sources.list only if you understand what you're doing. Mixing repositories can break your system. For more information see the Ubuntu Command-line Repository guide.\n\nCreate a backup of your current list of sources.\n\nsudo cp -p /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list_backup\n\nNote: sudo - runs the command with root privileges. cp = copy. -p = prompt to overwrite if a file already exists.\n\nEdit the list of sources:\n\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nor using a graphical editor:\n\ngksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nNote: To use your local mirror you can add \"xx.\" before archive.ubuntu.com, where xx = your country code.\n\nExample: deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jaunty main restricted universe multiverse indicates a repository for Great Britain (gb).\n\nHere is a sample sources.list. At the end have been added repositories for Medibuntu and Google:\n\n#deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 8.10 _Jaunty Jackalope_ - Release i386 (20081029.1)]/ jaunty main restricted # See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to # newer versions of the distribution. deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty main restricted deb-src http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty main restricted ## Major bug fix updates produced after the final release of the ## distribution. deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty-updates main restricted deb-src http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty-updates main restricted ## N.B. software from this repository is ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED by the Ubuntu ## team.

See Add repository keys.\n\nRefresh the packages list from the new repositories:\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAdd repository keys\n\nDownload the gpg keys for the repositories and automatically add them to your repository keyring:\n\nExample: To obtain and add the Medibuntu repository key:\n\nwget --quiet http://packages.medibuntu.org/medibuntu-key.gpg -O - | sudo apt-key add -\n\nExample: To obtain and add the Google repository key:\n\nwget --quiet https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub -O - | sudo apt-key add -\n\nNote: wget - retrieves a file from a network location. --quiet = no output. -O = Output downloaded item to terminal. The | (pipe symbol) is used to capture the output from the previous command (in our case the screen) and use it as an input for the piped command (i.e. apt-key, which adds it to the keyring).\n\nApt and Package Basics\n\nRead General Notes\n\nRead Add Extra Ubuntu Repositories\n\nMost new users will use the Synaptic Package Manager to install packages. These instructions are for installing packages from the command-line Terminal. Terminal can be started:\n\nApplications -> Accessories -> Terminal\n\nInstall packages:\n\nsudo apt-get install packagename\n\nExample:\n\nsudo apt-get install mpd sbackup\n\nRemove packages:\n\nsudo apt-get remove packagename\n\nTo remove all dependencies:\n\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nExample:\n\nsudo apt-get remove mpd sbackup\n\nSearch for packages:\n\napt-cache search <keywords>\n\nExamples:\n\napt-cache search Music MP3 apt-cache search \"Text Editor\"\n\nUpdate the apt package database after adding/removing repositories:\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nUpgrade packages:\n\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nUpgrade the entire distribution (e.g. from Intrepid to Jaunty):\n\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nInstalling .deb packages\n\nDebian (.deb) packages are the packages that are used in Ubuntu. You can install any .deb package in your system. .deb files can generally be installed from your file manager (Nautilus) merely by clicking on them, since file associations with the default installer is already set in Ubuntu. These instructions are for those who wish to install packages from the command-line terminal (Terminal).\n\nInstall a downloaded Debian (Ubuntu) package (.deb):\n\nsudo dpkg -i packagename.deb\n\nRemove a Debian (Ubuntu) package (.deb):\n\nsudo dpkg -r packagename\n\nReconfigure/Repair an installed Debian (Ubuntu) package (.deb):\n\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure packagename\n\n*Example:\n\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure mpd\n\nHandling (Tar/GZip) and (Tar/Bzip2) archives\n\n(Tar/GZip) archives end in \".tar.gz\" and (Tar/Bzip2) archives end in \".tar.bz2\". Bzip2 is the newer, more efficient compression method. These files can generally be automatically extracted by merely clicking on them from your file manager (Nautilus), since file associations with the appropriate archival utilities are set by default in Ubuntu. These instructions are for those who wish to use the command line Terminal.\n\nTo extract:\n\ntar xvf packagename.tar.gz\n\nNote: tar is an application which can extract files from an archive, decompressing if necessary.\n\n-x means extract.\n\n-v means verbose (list what it is extracting).\n\n-f specifies the file to use.\n\nDecompressing \".gz\" files\n\ngunzip file.gz\n\nDecompressing \".bz2\" files\n\nbunzip2 file.bz2\n\nNote: You can also decompress a package first by using the command gunzip (for .gz) or bunzip2 (for .bz2), leaving the .tar file. You would then use tar to extract it.\n\nTo create a .gz archive:\n\ntar cvfz packagename.tar.gz folder\n\nTo create a .bz2 archive:\n\ntar cvfj packagename.tar.bz2 folder\n\nInstalling a package from source\n\nMake sure you have all the necessary development tools (i.e. libraries, compilers, headers):\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\nNote: \"uname -r\" lists the current kernel you are using\n\nExtract the archive that contains the source files:\n\ntar xvf sourcefilesarchive.tar.gz\n\nBuild the package using the package's script (in this case the configure script), compile the package (make), and install the compiled package into your system (make install):\n\ncd /path/to/extracted/sourcefiles ./configure sudo make sudo make install\n\nNote: typing ./ before a filename in the current folder allows the Linux shell to try and execute the file as an application even if it is not in the path (the set of folders which it searches when you type a command name). If you get a \"permission denied\" error, the file is not marked as being executable. To fix this:\n\nsudo chmod +x filename\n\nExample: In the above instructions, configure is the shell script to build the package from source. To be sure the configure script is executable:\n\nsudo chmod +x configure\n\nCreate a .deb package from source files\n\nIf your build from source is successful, you can make a Debian (Ubuntu) package (.deb) for future use:\n\nInstall package tools:\n\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\n\nRebuild package using \"checkinstall\":\n\ncd /path/to/extracted/package ./configure sudo make sudo checkinstall\n\nKeep the resulting \".deb\" file for future use. It can later be installed using:\n\nsudo dpkg -i packagename.deb\n\nNote: These are basic instructions that may not always work. Some packages require additional dependencies and optional parameters to be specified in order to build them successfully.\n\nAptitude\n\nAptitude is a terminal-based package manager that can be used instead of apt-get. Aptitude marks packages that are automatically installed and removes them when no packages depend on them. This makes it easy to remove applications completely. To use Aptitude, replace apt-get with aptitude in the command line. Example:\n\nsudo aptitude install packagename sudo aptitude remove packagename sudo aptitude update sudo aptitude upgrade\n\nFor an ncurses-based graphical user interface, type\n\nsudo aptitude\n\nFor more information, see the aptitude documentation.\n\nSynaptic Package Manager\n\nWhile \"apt-get\" and \"aptitude\" are fast ways of installing programs/packages, you can also use the Synaptic Package Manager (System -> Administration -> Synaptic Manager), a GUI method for installing programs/packages. Most (but not all) programs/packages available with apt-get install will also be available from the Synaptic Package Manager. This is the preferred method for most desktop users. In this guide, when you see\n\nsudo apt-get install package\n\nyou can simply search for package in Synaptic and install it that way.\n\nSystem -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager\n\nSearch for the name of the program/package. You can also search for a word in its description.\n\nCheck the box \"Mark for Installation\"\n\nClick the \"Apply\" button.\n\nThe selected program(s) will be automatically installed, along with its dependencies.\n\nAdd/Remove Programs\n\nNot all packages available from apt-get, aptitude, and Synaptic Package Manager are available in Add/Remove Programs. However, it is the easiest interface for new users of Ubuntu and directs them to preferred packages.\n\nApplications -> Add/Remove Programs\n\nSearch for the sort of program you want to add. Example: type MP3 to see a list of mp3 software.\n\nCheck the box \"Mark for Installation\"\n\nClick the \"Apply\" button.\n\nThe selected program(s) will be automatically installed.\n\nRead General Notes\n\nRead Add Extra Ubuntu Repositories\n\nManually, from Terminal (command line interface):\n\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nor\n\nUse Synaptic Package Manager:\n\nSystem -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager -> \"Reload\" then \"Mark all upgrades\"\n\nIf there are packages available for updating, you will be prompted whether to install them.\n\nUse Synaptic Package Manager:\n\nSystem -> Administration -> Synaptic Manager -> Settings -> Preferences -> General -> Reloading Outdated Package Information -> Automatic\n\nUbuntu Addon Applications\n\nSee our full list of add-on applications.\n\nEye Candy Applications\n\nEye Candy Applications refer to the decoration of the graphical user interface. These can be add-on icons, themes, wallpapers, 3-D effects, etc.\n\nGnome Eye-Candy Resources\n\nGnome Look has wallpapers, splash screens, icons, and themes for windows managers (including Metacity and Compiz) and other applications.\n\nMetacity\n\nMetacity is the default desktop compositing manager in Gnome. It is lightweight, streamlined and does not have many configurable options, but has multiple themes available at Gnome Look.\n\nCompiz Fusion\n\nCompiz Fusion is available as a separate Windows Manager, to allow advanced desktop effects such as the rotating cube desktop. Many Ubuntu users choose to run Compiz, which is quite fast in Ubuntu. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install compiz compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-fusion-plugins-main compiz-fusion-plugins-extra emerald librsvg2-common\n\nTo change to Compiz as the Window Manager:\n\nSelect Compiz Configuration:\n\nSystem -> Preferences -> CompizConfig Settings Manager\n\nNote: You must logout and log back in for the change to take effect.\n\nFusion Icon\n\nFusion Icon is a tray icon that allows you to easily switch between window managers, window decorators, and gives you quick access to the Compiz Settings Manager. This allows quick toggling of 3-D desktop effects (that may not be compatible with some applications).\n\nsudo apt-get install fusion-icon\n\nApplications -> System Tools -> Compiz Fusion Icon\n\nYou can then easily access CompizConfig Settings Manager from the icon.\n\nRotate the Compiz Cube\n\nSet the CompizConfig Settings Manager to enable the \"Desktop Cube\" and \"Rotate Cube\" and \"Viewport Switcher\" options. Click on the icon for each to customize settings. For example, to change the appearance of the cube, click on the Desktop Cube icon to access its settings. You can set the hotkey buttons for rotating the cube in the \"Viewport Switcher\" settings. Otherwise, hold down the Ctrl+Alt+Left mouse button and drag the mouse (or touchpad) the direction you want to rotate the cube.\n\nRemember, the cube rotates between desktops. It's not a cube unless you have at least 4 desktops running. You will not get a cube if you are only using 2 desktops (you will get a \"plate\"). You can still rotate the sides of the plate, of course, but it will not be a cube. (Recent users from the Windows OS may have no experience with the concept of simultaneous desktops, but they are nice once you learn how to use them).\n\nWhen running Compiz fusion as the Windows Manager, you must change the default number of desktops from within CompizConfig Settings Manger. To enable 4 desktops:\n\nCompizConfig Settings Manager -> General -> General Options -> Desktop Size -> Horizontal Virtual Size -> 4\n\nWhen you start an application, you can assign it to any one of the 4 desktops by right-clicking the upper left corner of the application window and choosing the \"To Desktop...\" option. Rotating the cube shows the different desktops. You can also go to a desktop using the taskbar icon which shows the 4 desktops.\n\nEmerald\n\nEmerald is the theme engine for Compiz Fusion. Multiple themes are available. (These themes originated from the Beryl project before it merged with Compiz to form Compiz Fusion.) The Emerald Theme Manager for Compiz Fusion can be installed:\n\nsudo apt-get install emerald\n\nUbuntu Wallpaper\n\nDownload free Earthenibex wallpapers.\n\nChange USplash Boot Screen\n\nThis is the splash screen you see at bootup, when you are asked for a login and password. You can change the USplash screen using the utility startupmanager. (Startup Manager can also be used to change GRUB bootup settings if you use multiple OS's on your computer). Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install startupmanager\n\nStart:\n\nSystem -> Administration -> Startup Manager\n\nYou could alternatively use a different splashscreen manager, Splashy, instead of USplash. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install splashy splashy-themes\n\nGoogle Desktop\n\nGoogle Desktop for Linux is a proprietary suite of widgets and applications to give Google control over your computer and thereby allow you to use Google services. A .deb package can be downloaded and installed from Google Linux Downloads. For installation instructions, see Google Desktop for Linux Instructions.\n\nDock applications\n\nAvant Window Manager, Cairo Dock, and Wbar are dock-like applications for Ubuntu Linux. A dock represents running programs as icons at the bottom of the screen (as is done on the Mac OS X desktop), instead of by toolbar panel segments (as is done in Windows and other Linux window managers). See this brief comparison of dock applications.\n\nAvant Window Navigator\n\nAvant Window Navigator requires that a desktop composition manager (such as Metacity, Compiz, Xcompmgr, KDE4 (Kubuntu), or xfwm4 (Xubuntu)) be installed and running.\n\nInstall and upgrade proprietary nVidia or ATI graphics drivers so that the compositing manager functions properly.\n\nInstall AWN:\n\nsudo apt-get install avant-window-navigator awn-manager\n\n(Note: If you are using Gnome (Ubuntu) and do not already have a compositing manager installed (such as Compiz), Metacity will be installed as part of the installation.)\n\nEnable automatic startup of AWN at bootup:\n\nMenu -> System -> Preferences -> Sessions -> Add...\n\navant-window-navigator\n\nSelect which applets should run from the dock menu by default:\n\nMenu -> Applications -> Accessories -> Avant Window Navigator Manager\n\nYou can drag application icons onto the list, then activate or deactivate the applets from the list.\n\nCairo Dock\n\nCairo Dock can be used either with a desktop compositing manager (such as Metacity for Gnome, Compiz, or the KDE4 Window Manager) or without one. See the Ubuntu installation instructions for details. It is available from the repositories:\n\nsudo apt-get install cairo-dock cairo-dock-plugins\n\nwbar\n\nwbar is a quick-launch bar (not a dock) that has an appearance similar to Avant Window Manager and Cairo Dock. It is GTK (Gnome) based but can work in all desktop environments. It does not require a compositing manager to be installed and is therefore quicker and more suitable for low-end hardware systems. It is the default in the Google gOS desktop and is available as a .deb package from Google. Download and install (from the command-line Terminal):\n\nwget http://wbar.googlecode.com/files/wbar_1.3.3_i386.deb sudo dpkg -i wbar_1.3.3_i386.deb\n\nStart wbar with custom start options (e.g. by pressing alt+F2). Here is an example:\n\nwbar -isize 48 -j 1 -p bottom -balfa 40 -bpress -nanim 3 -z 2.5 -above-desk\n\nHere is another example:\n\nwbar -above-desk -pos bottom -isize 60 -nanim 1 -bpress -jumpf 0.0 -zoomf 1.5\n\nFor a full list of command-line startup options, see:\n\nwbar --help\n\nTip: If you want the \"wave\" effect just increase the -nanim value. I like the icons to just pop up so I don't use it, but with 9 icons 5 there is a nice \"wave\" effect.\n\nObviously, you could create a menu item with the command line options (similar to the examples above), or a batch file that can be automatically started at system startup (as a cron event or startup session).\n\nYou can also change wbar startup options by editing the configuration file:\n\nsudo gedit /usr/share/wbar/dot.wbar\n\nSee this example configuration file. However, not all options are able to be set from the configuration file and must be run from the command line. For more info see this wbar guide.\n\nwbarconf\n\nA simple wbar configuration utility can be downloaded as a .deb package and installed:\n\nwget http://koti.kapsi.fi/~ighea/wbarconf/wbarconf_0.7.2-1_i386.deb sudo dpkg -i wbarconf_0.7.2-1_i386.deb\n\nVirtualization\n\nVirtualization allows a second operating system (OS), such as Windows or OS X, to be run from within Ubuntu. This requires extra RAM (because both Ubuntu and the virtualized second OS require separate amounts of RAM) and a license for the second OS. If you wish to run a virtualized instance of Windows XP, for instance, you must have a license for Windows XP.\n\nVirtualBox\n\nVirtualBox is a fast and complete virtualization solution owned and maintained by Sun Microsystems. There is a free and fully open-source edition available under the GNU GPL license.\n\nInstall the open-source edition:\n\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose virtualbox-ose-source\n\nStart VirtualBox:\n\nVirtualBox OSE PC virtualization solution\n\nFor usage instructions, see the End-user documentation.\n\nXen\n\nXen is an efficient open-source virtualization (\"hypervisor\") platform which includes a recent merge with QEMU. It is free open source under a GPL license. Installation for the desktop must be from source (see the website for details). A commercial version is offered by Citrix.\n\nA Xen virtual machine host can also be installed automatically with certain 64-bit CPUs, using the 64-bit Ubuntu Server LiveCD. (An Ubuntu desktop can then later be added -- see Ubuntu server).\n\nVMWare\n\nVMWare is a commercial virtualization platform that currently offers a free license (renewable yearly) for use with its server software. Installation instructions are on the website.\n\nKeyboard errors in VMware guest\n\nAfter installing VMWare 6.5, and installing a guest OS, the Function, arrow and Del/End/etc keys do not function. This is a bug with VMWare麓s code. Add this line to ~/.vmware/config (create file if necessary) to fix this issue:\n\nxkeymap.nokeycodeMap = true\n\nCrossover for Linux\n\nCodeweavers' Crossover Office for Linux is a subscription-based commercial package that allows many Windows programs to be run on Ubuntu without the need for a Microsoft OS license or a complete virtualization system. See the website for more info. Codeweavers releases older versions of this product as the free package Wine.\n\nWine\n\nWine is a free open-source package that essentially consists of an older and more limited implementation of CrossOver for Linux. It is provided by Codeweavers. Like CrossOver for Linux, no Microsoft license or virtualization platform is required to run Windows programs.\n\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nAlso consider installing Microsoft's TrueType fonts:\n\nsudo apt-get install msttcorefonts\n\nInternet Explorer 6\n\nInternet Explorer 6 can function under Wine, albeit imperfectly. For most purposes, Firefox can be used (with the User Agent Switcher plugin) to mimic Internet Explorer, but for those instances when it can't, IE6 may be useful. A beta implementation of Internet Explorer 7 is also available from this package. For more info, see IEs 4 Linux.\n\nMake sure you have wine and cabextract packages:\n\nsudo apt-get install wine cabextract\n\nDownload IEs 4 Linux and install:\n\nwget http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/downloads/ies4linux-latest.tar.gz tar zxvf ies4linux-latest.tar.gz cd ies4linux-* ./ies4linux --no-gui\n\nTransgaming Cedega\n\nCedega is a commercial application (similar to CrossOver Office and Wine), for installing and running some Windows applications, specifically games, without the need for virtualization or a Microsoft license. It provides 3D support, software acceleration support, and a high level of DirectX support. Installation instructions are found on the website.\n\nMono\n\nMono is a free open source project sponsored by Novell to allow .NET programs to function in Linux (Ubuntu) and Mac OS X. The most recent version is available here.\n\nsudo apt-get install mono-2.0-devel\n\nMoonlight\n\nMoonlight is part of the Novell Mono project that is an open source implementation of Silverlight (the Microsoft multimedia presentation platform). It is based on FFMpeg. It is made to work best with the Firefox 3 web browser, as a plugin. It is available here.\n\nNetflix under Moonlight\n\nNetflix streaming requires Silverlight 2.0. The current version of Moonlight is 1.0 (corresponding to Silverlight 1.0). Moonlight 2.0 is anticipated for mid-year 2009. Until this project is complete, or until Netflix agrees to stream video using Flashplayer, there are currently no methods for streaming Netflix in Linux.\n\nEdutainment Applications\n\nThere are many, many superb applications that can be installed with a single click.\n\nApplications -> Add/Remove Software -> Edutainment.\n\nBelow are a few examples that can be installed from this menu:\n\nStellarium -- an astounding planetarium for the desktop\n\nK3DSurf -- a program for modeling 3,4,5, and 6 dimensional models.\n\nBibletime-- a Bible study tool for KDE.\n\nZekr -- an Islamic Quran study tool (available in Utilities instead of Edutainment)\n\nOregano -- a program for electrical engineering schematics\n\nRlPlot -- a high quality graph generator\n\nMnemosyne -- a flash-card tool\n\nGramps -- map your family-tree and co-operate with genealogy projects.\n\nGoogle Earth\n\nGoogle Earth gives you an annotated eagle's eye view of our planet. This is a free proprietary package (you must accept the license to use this package).\n\nsudo apt-get install googleearth-package make-googleearth-package --force\n\nDoubleclick on the resulting .deb file.\n\n-- or --\n\nTo install the latest Linux binary, download and save the GoogleEarthLinux.bin package from Google Earth downloads. Then install:\n\nchmod +x GoogleEarthLinux.bin ./GoogleEarthLinux.bin\n\nRun:\n\nApplications -> Internet -> Google Earth 3D planet viewer\n\nYou should turn off the Google Earth -> View -> Atmosphere setting, or you might see clouds everywhere and the ground won't show up.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf Google Earth opens, shows the splash screen, and then crashes, you鈥檙e probably experiencing a common issue. Running ~/google-earth/googleearth in a terminal will show this error: ./googleearth-bin: relocation error: /usr/lib/i686/cmov/libssl.so.0.9.8: symbol BIO_test_flags, version OPENSSL_0.9.8 not defined in file libcrypto.so.0.9.8 with link time reference\n\nTo fix this, browse to the folder you installed Google Earth into. By default this will be google-earth in your home folder. Find the file libcrypto.so.0.9.8 and rename it to something else, like libcrypto.so.0.9.8.bak. Google Earth should now start correctly.\n\ncd ~/google-earth sudo mv libcrypto.so.0.9.8 libcrypto.so.0.9.8.bak sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8 ~/google-earth/libcrypto.so.0.9.8\n\n(Note: You can also specify /home/user/google-earth instead of ~/google-earth ).\n\nFor other issues, see the Ubuntu help pages on Google Earth.\n\nUninstall Google Earth\n\nTo uninstall run the uninstall shell script located in the /home/user/google-earth folder (or whichever folder you installed google-earth into).\n\nProprietary Applications\n\nProprietary software helps you maximize your Internet experience, but is not open source. The software available includes Multimedia Codecs, Java Runtime Environment, and plug-ins for Firefox.\n\nRestricted Extras\n\nThe Ubuntu Restricted Extras will install Adobe Flash Player, Java Runtime Environment (JRE) (sun-java-jre) with Firefox plug-ins (icedtea), a set of Microsoft Fonts (msttcorefonts), multimedia codecs (w32codecs or w64codecs), mp3-compatible encoding (lame), FFMpeg, extra Gstreamer codecs, the package for DVD decoding (libdvdread4, but see below for info on libdvdcss2), and the unrar archiver. This is a single command approach.\n\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nGames Applications\n\nThere are some phenomenal games for Ubuntu Linux.\n\nBest Linux Games for 2008.\n\nBest 25 Linux Games of 2007.\n\nUbuntu Gamers Arena.\n\nThere are hundreds of free, open-source games available in Ubuntu.

Some recommend running from a shell:\n\nsudo ./nexuiz-linux-glx.sh\n\nor\n\nsudo ./nexuiz-linux-sdl.sh\n\nA 35 map community pack is available here. To install, extract the map pack to /home/username/.nexuiz/data (or ~/.nexuiz/data ).\n\nUrbanTerror\n\nUrbanTerror is a multiplayer first person shooter action game. It uses the open-source quake 3 engine and features many real weapons and free-to-use servers for multi-player functionality. See the Installation instructions at the website.\n\nAlternative installation with a script:\n\nUrbanTerror Installation Script 1 or UrbanTerror Installation Script 2\n\nAfter downloading the script open Terminal into your download directory then make the script executable with the following command:\n\nsudo chmod +x urt40-linux-installer.sh\n\nNow double click on the script to execute and follow the directions\n\nThe install will take a while, as the script executes a download of the necessary files which are about 541MB\n\nAfter the install you will have a nice UrbanTerror icon on your desktop (unless you installed as root)\n\nSpring\n\nThe Spring Project is a scripting engine platform to develop and play free multiplayer games such as Star Wars Imperial Winter and Complete Annihilation. See these installation instructions for adding the repository, then installing as a package.\n\nPlaneShift\n\nPlaneShift is a promising free full-immersion online fantasy game (MMPORG). Client downloads and patches are available here.\n\nMake the downloaded binary installation file executable:\n\ncd /directory_where_downloaded chmod +x PlaneShift-v.0.42-x64.bin\n\nRun the executable binary as root (this must be done from the command line Terminal):\n\nsudo ./PlaneShift-v.0.42-x64.bin\n\nFollow the instructions for installation. When prompted whether to manually set permissions, answer \"no.\"\n\nDuring installation, most users have recommended installing this game to your /home directory as a single user installation, instead of to /opt for all users. This avoids permissions problems. I was able to install to /opt, but it takes some effort.\n\nMake sure your user belongs to the games group:\n\nSystem -> User Manager -> user -> Groups -> check games\n\nDownload the updater patch psupdaterlinux64.zip and unzip it to your download directory.\n\nRun the updater as root:\n\nchmod +x psupdater chmod +x psupdater.bin sudo ./psupdater\n\nRegister for a free account at PlaneShift Registration.\n\nIf you installed the game to the menu, it will be in\n\nApplications -> Lost & Found -> Client and Setup\n\nTo run it from the menu, I had to edit the menu entries by checking the box: \"Run in terminal.\" Alternatively, run it from the command-line Terminal:\n\nsudo /opt/PlaneShift/pssetup sudo /opt/PlaneShift/psclient\n\nNotes: This game ran very slowly for me on a 32-bit installation with a DSL connection and I gave up. The 64-bit installation worked better, but there were still many freezes. This is a game very much in development, and is still in alpha stage.\n\nPrBoom - the classic Doom2 game\n\nPrBoom is a free open source port of the original first person shooter action game, Doom.\n\nsudo apt-get install prboom freedoom timidity timidity-interfaces-extra\n\nThere are thousands of extra maps (Wads) available for this game. It is easiest to keep a directory for your wads in your home directory:\n\nmkdir /home/user/wads\n\nPlace your doom2.wad, tnt.wad, or plutonia.wad (from your original game) into this folder. If you don't have one, you can copy the Freedom version of doom2.wad from /usr/share/games/freedoom into this folder. Place any new .wad's you have downloaded from the Internet into this folder as well. Then run the game using both the original iwad map as well as your new .wad map (you will only see the new map).\n\nprboom -iwad /home/user/wads/doom2.wad -file /home/user/wads/new_wad.wad\n\nNote: Only doom2.wad, tnt.wad, or plutonia.wad can be used as an iwad. You must have one of these in addition to any new wad you wish to use. When in doubt, use doom2.wad.\n\nNote: this game can also be installed using Applications -> Add/Remove Software -> Games as Freedoom, but you must also install timidity and timidity-interfaces-extra.\n\nWing Commander Privateer\n\nThe Linux version of this free version of Wing Commander can be downloaded as a binary here.\n\nGraphics and Video Applications\n\nGraphics and Video Applications allow you to edit your favourite photos, create stunning 3D drawings, or professionally edit your videos and movies.\n\nKino (Non-linear Video Editing Suite)\n\nKino is a widely used GUI-based non-linear video editing suite for Linux.\n\nsudo apt-get install kino mjpegtools\n\nCinelerra (Non-linear Video Editing Suite)\n\nCinelerra Community Version is a complete high-end open source video editing suite that is a derivative of a similar commercial system.

Here is a nice review of some of the applications that enables conversion and handling of these types of files.\n\nCDs and DVDs\n\nDVD Playback Capability\n\nTo play encrypted DVDs, the libdvdcss2 package is essential. libdvdcss2 is a simple library designed for accessing DVDs like a block device without having to bother about the decryption. More information about this package can be found at VideoLAN.\n\nYou can install libdvdcss2 as a 64-bit .deb package without installing the Medibuntu repositories:\n\nwget -c http://packages.medibuntu.org/pool/free/libd/libdvdcss/libdvdcss2_1.2.10-0.2medibuntu1_amd64.deb sudo dpkg -i libdvdcss2_1.2.10-0.2medibuntu1_amd64.deb\n\nor a 32-bit .deb package:\n\nwget -c http://packages.medibuntu.org/pool/free/libd/libdvdcss/libdvdcss2_1.2.10-0.2medibuntu1_i386.deb sudo dpkg -i libdvdcss2_1.2.10-0.2medibuntu1_i386.deb\n\nYou can also use guidelines provided at Medibuntu. This will install the Medibuntu repositories on your system and then install the libdvdcss2 package:\n\nsudo wget http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/jaunty.list --output-document=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install medibuntu-keyring sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install libdvdcss2\n\nYou can also install 32 bit or 64 bit Windows multimedia codecs (if you haven't already done so using ubuntu-restricted-extras):\n\nsudo apt-get install w32codecs\n\nor\n\nsudo apt-get install w64codecs\n\nInstead of downloading directly from Medibuntu, you could also use the script included with the libdvdread4 package to download and install libdvdcss2:\n\nsudo apt-get install libdvdread4 sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh\n\nK9copy DVD-Ripper\n\nK9copy is the free open source DVD backup, copying, compression, and authoring utility that requires libdvdcss. For other info, see this or this guide. You can also easily create MPEG-4 videos with this utility.\n\nsudo apt-get install k9copy\n\ndvd::rip\n\ndvd::rip is a DVD backup/copy program, written in GTK-based perl, that uses the transcode video/audio processing and conversion tools. See the website for installation and official documentation. For other info, see this dvd::rip tutorial.\n\nDVD Fab DVD Ripper\n\nDVD Fab is the favoured DVD backup tool for today's DVD encryption methods. It must be run in Wine (since it is a Windows application). It comes as a fully featured 30-day trial, but see these instructions for fine-tuning the trial period.\n\nHandbrake\n\nHandbrake is a GPL-licenced open source tool for converting DVD to MPEG-4 (iPod format) that is an alternative to k9copy. A self-installing .deb file is available from the website for download.\n\nFFMPEG video / audio conversion\n\nFFMPEG is the swiss-army knife of video and audio format conversion. It succeeds when no other program can. It is free and open source. If it not yet installed on your system as part of another package (it is used by many video/audio editors), then install it:\n\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n\nTo convert many different formats, read the FFMPEG documentation. Also see this tutorial.\n\nExample: To convert a saved Flash video (.flv) to an MPEG-2 format playable on a DVD, convert:\n\nffmpeg -i samplevideo.flv -target ntsc-dvd samplevideo.mpg\n\nThen use K3b (or Gnomebaker) to write the mpg file to a New DVD Data Project.\n\nFor PAL use -target pal-dvd. For widescreen, use -target film-dvd. For other conversion tips, see this forum. (Note: Most Flash video has very low resolution, with a screen size of 360x270, for example. You may see a slight diminishment in resolution if you wish to convert it to 720x480 (which is the NTSC standard size) or other screen size. You can keep the original screen size and resolution by omitting the -target parameter.) If your original file is 16:9 widescreen and you desire a 4:3 letterbox output for playing on an overscanned TV, you may need to pad the file so that the widescreen is not compressed (see this forum):\n\nffmpeg -i samplevideo.flv -target ntsc-dvd -s 648x364 -padleft 36 -padright 36 -padtop 58 -padbottom 58 samplevideo.mpg\n\nYou can also use the WinFF GUI and add the command (as above) as a \"Preset,\" for subsequent use. For example:\n\nVideo converter (WinFF) -> Edit -> Presets ->\n\nPreset Name: Letterbox -> Preset Label: 16:9 Widescreen to 4:3 Letterbox\n\nPreset command: -target ntsc-dvd -s 648x364 -padleft 36 -padright 36 -padtop 58 -padbottom 58\n\nOuput file extension: mpg -> Category: DVD\n\n-> Add/Update -> Save\n\nTo convert to MPEG-4 (mp4) files, use\n\nffmpeg -i samplevideo.flv outputvideo.mp4\n\nFFMPEG GUI\n\nWinFF is a free, GPL-licensed open source GUI frontend for FFMPEG. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install winff\n\nRun:\n\nApplications -> Multimedia -> Video converter (WinFF)\n\nJoin video segments\n\nIndividual video segments (MPEG-2, for example) can easily be joined:\n\ncat samplevideo1.mpg samplevideo2.mpg samplevideo3.mpg > samplevideo123.mpg\n\nYou can then write the resulting MPEG-2 file to a DVD and play it in most DVD players.\n\nSave any streaming Flash video\n\nAn easy way is to install the Video Download Helper plug-in for Firefox.\n\nOtherwise, most Flash videos download to the /tmp directory while you watch the video, creating a randomly-named video file there (such as Flashuh4G6s). When you close the webpage, this file in the /tmp directory will be erased. After the entire video has downloaded, but before you close the webpage, copy that file (such as Flashuh4G6s) to your home directory (where it will not be erased). Of course, for this to work, you must change your Flash (or Gnash) settings to allow an unlimited buffer. While watching your Flash video, right click to bring up the Flash -> Settings window. Set the Buffer to \"Unlimited.\"\n\nOnce you have copied the file, rename it appropriately with the .flv added to the filename. You can then watch it using VLC or Mplayer.\n\nHere is another method that involves making a symbolic link.\n\nConvert Flash video audio to mp3\n\nOnce you have downloaded flash video content (.flv) from the Internet (using the Video Download Helper plug-in for Firefox, for example), the audio component can be converted to an mp3 using this command (from the command line Terminal). (This will work for any type of video file, not just Flash.)\n\nffmpeg -i nameofvideoclip.flv -ab 160k -ac 2 -ar 44100 -vn nameoffile.mp3\n\nwhere -i indicates the input, -ab indicates the bit rate (in this example 160kb/sec), -vn means no video ouput, -ac 2 means 2 channels, -ar 44100 indicates the sampling frequency. See FFMPEG docs for more info.\n\nDVD Author\n\nDVD author allows you to create menus and format your MPEG-2 videos onto a DVD disc so that you can play it in a commercial DVD player. DVD Author is a command line tool, but several GUI's exist. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install dvdauthor\n\nQDVDAuthor\n\nQDVDAuthor is a Qt-based GUI for DVD Author.

It is free and open source with a GPL license (unlike other groupware solutions), yet enterprise support is also available. It is scalable to large organizations and is Outlook (MS-Exchange) and Mozilla compatible. This is a German package, however, and documentation in English is limited, which can make installation challenging. The Kolab website provides its own instructions for installation from source (currently v. 2.2). In brief:\n\nInstall the compiler and other necessary stuff:\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nMake a directory for the Kolab installation and make it universally accessible:\n\nsudo cd / sudo mkdir /kolab sudo chmod 777 /kolab\n\nOptional: If you wish to mount kolab in its own partition, then create a new partition (using Gparted, for example). Figure out the device name of your extra partition:\n\nfdisk -l\n\nIt should be something like /dev/sda3.\n\nMount /dev/sda3 (or whatever your partition is) as /kolab by editing /etc/fstab:\n\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nand adding the line:\n\n/dev/sda3 /kolab ext3 defaults,rw 0 0\n\nthen reboot and make sure there are no errors.\n\nMake a directory into which to download kolab:\n\nmkdir /kolabtmp\n\nDownload all the current Kolab files:\n\ncd /kolabtmp wget -r -l1 -nd --no-parent http://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/kolab/server/beta/kolab-server-2.2.1-beta-1/ix86-debian4.0\n\nInstall Kolab (as root using sudo -s):\n\nsudo -s sh install-kolab.sh 2>&1 | tee kolab-install.log\n\nReboot your system.\n\nStop Kolab services and run the configuration utility:\n\nsudo /kolab/bin/openpkg rc all stop sudo /kolab/sbin/kolab_bootstrap -b\n\nObviously, you should know all your details, such as your fully qualified host name, domain details, etc., before doing this step. If you are not familiar with OpenLDAPand LDAP basics, you should learn about it, as Kolab uses the slapd OpenLDAP server daemon.\n\nRestart all Kolab services:\n\nsudo /kolab/bin/openpkg rc all start\n\nLogin to the web administrator interface using \"manager\" and the password you set at bootstrap configuration:\n\nhttps://yourhost.yourdomain.name/admin\n\nKolab Debian package\n\nThere is an Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Debian package for Kolab (v. 2.1), but no support for it exists. In fact, it is due to be removed from the Debian packages because of this lack of support. The installation instructions are included below for reference, and if you have success installing from the package, please add the steps you took to make it work.\n\nsudo apt-get install kolabd kolab-webadmin\n\nTo reconfigure setup after the original installation, stop all web services:\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop sudo /etc/init.d/kolabd stop sudo /etc/init.d/kolab-cyrus stop sudo /etc/init.d/postfix stop sudo /etc/init.d/saslauthd stop sudo /etc/init.d/slapd stop\n\nand then start the Kolab bootstrap setup:\n\nsudo kolab_bootstrap -b\n\nand proceed with configuration for your server/domain.\n\nThen restart all the services (e.g. sudo /etc/init.d apache2 start).\n\nNotes: Kolab uses its own server components, and it is best to run Kolab on a dedicated server. However, it is possible to run other servers on the same machine, as long as you choose alternate ports if the server modules conflict.\n\nCitadel\n\nCitadel is a turn-key fully open source groupware solution (that is also Kolab compliant) with a structure rooted in bulletin-board systems, and is therefore user friendly.
