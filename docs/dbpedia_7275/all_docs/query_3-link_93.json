        "text": "Prior to testing\n\nChecking in\n\nDuring exam\n\nGeneral\n\nPrior to testing\n\nQ. Where can I take my exam?\n\nA. You need to test in an enclosed, private space where you can maintain a strong and stable internet connection, prevent interruptions, and protect the integrity of your exam content.\n\nImportant: Avoid a testing space with windows or glass partitions that would allow a third party to see your screen, or your exam could be revoked.\n\nQ. How do I know my computer will work with the OnVUE software?\n\nA. To ensure your system will work with our software, first, review the minimum system requirements. Next, perform a system test and download the OnVUE software prior to your exam day.\n\nOn exam day, before your exam begins, we strongly recommend re-checking your system by running another system test. If you experience any issues, please log back into your account to reschedule your exam. If you can’t reschedule your exam, use the chat feature to ask your program-specific customer service team for assistance.\n\nQ. What does the system test check for?\n\nA. The system test checks for:\n\nDownload of the OnVUE application and secure browser\n\nUnzipping and launching of the secure browser\n\nMicrophone/webcam/speaker functionality and permissions\n\nDownload speeds\n\nGeneral communications between OnVUE and Pearson VUE servers\n\nA live video-streaming connection\n\nQ. How do I schedule my OnVUE exam?\n\nA. Once you’ve verified your computer meets system requirements, sign into your account. Select the exam you want to take, then choose the “home or office” option. Follow the remaining prompts to schedule your exam appointment. You will receive a confirmation email with your appointment details and important information for exam day.\n\nQ. Is my testing space okay for testing?\n\nA. Your proctor will make this decision prior to starting your exam. During check-in, you will be asked to take photos of your testing space (opens in new window), which the proctor will review.\n\nFor a positive outcome, make sure your space is private and secure. Clear the room of any preparation materials or unauthorized items. Unplug and/or turn off additional monitors (and, if applicable, systems). Any visible materials on the walls—including sticky notes, whiteboards or chalkboards, etc.—may be inspected by your proctor, and we may ask you to remove any such material.\n\nImportant: If your testing space fails the room scan, you will not be permitted to take the exam and may forfeit your exam fees.\n\nQ. Can I take my exam using an employer-issued computer?\n\nA. Yes, however, we don’t recommend it. Test-takers typically have a better experience with personal computers. This is because employer-issued computers are more likely to have firewalls, VPNs, and other security policies that may block video streaming during the exam. If you must use an employer-issued computer to take your exam, it’s crucial to review the technical requirements.\n\nQ. May I connect by tethering to a mobile hotspot?\n\nA. We don’t recommend it. Hotspot technology is not ideal for maintaining a reliable and consistent connection. To ensure optimal performance on exam day, perform a system test.\n\nChecking in\n\nQ. How do I check in for my test and download the software?\n\nA. You may have two options:\n\nRefer to your confirmation, reschedule or reminder email, which might have a Check-in to start exam link. If it does, you can click this link from 30 minutes before to 15 minutes past your appointment start time.\n\nClick the “Sign in now” button on this page or your test sponsor’s external landing page. Once you’ve logged into your account, your exam will appear under Open Online Exams. Select the exam link and then select Check-in.\n\nWith either process, you’ll be asked to download and run OnVUE, our online proctoring software.\n\nQ. I don’t see the Check-in button. What should I do?\n\nA. To check in for your exam, log in to your account no earlier than 30 minutes before your scheduled appointment time. Once logged in, you should see the Check-in button. If it's not visible within 15 minutes of your exam appointment time, contact your program-specific customer service team via chat.\n\nQ. What type of identification will I need?\n\nA. Click the View ID requirements button on this page to make sure you have the proper ID for online-proctored testing.\n\nQ. My proctor hasn’t started my exam yet. Where is my proctor?\n\nA. Once you've completed the required check-in steps and have completed taking photos of your face, ID and environment, you will see the following message: You are almost done with the check-in process. Next, you’ll be placed in a queue and will wait momentarily while a proctor reviews your check-in steps. Please be aware, other candidates may be ahead of you in line. The OnVUE application should tell you where you are in queue. Most exams are launched by a proctor within 15 minutes of the appointment start time.\n\nAny delay might mean there’s a problem with your photos or internet connection. For issues with your photos, a proctor will attempt to reach you over chat or via your cell phone. You may not recognize the phone number, which will either have a 617 US area code or say “Pearson VUE” on the caller ID, but please answer so we can assist. If we haven't contacted you within 30 minutes, we may have lost connection to you. In such cases, please contact our customer service team via Pearson OnVUE Support live chat. As a reminder, mobile devices must be kept out of arm’s reach during the testing sessions.\n\nDuring exam\n\nQ. Can other people be in my testing space during the exam?\n\nA. No. You cannot allow anyone else—including children, roommates, colleagues, etc.—to enter or even pass through your testing space once you’ve started your exam.\n\nQ. Can I receive any exam assistance during the test?\n\nA. No. The proctor cannot answer questions related to exam content, and you may not get help from other individuals while taking the exam.\n\nQ. Is technical software assistance available during the exam?\n\nA. Should you experience technical difficulties during your exam, simply raise your hand using the OnVUE application at the top of your screen and a proctor will assist you. If for some reason this is unavailable, you can get help via the chat button on this page or the OnVUE download page.\n\nMost issues can be avoided by completing a system test and ensuring that you meet all system requirements in advance of testing. Common issues include an unreliable internet connection and third-party applications trying to run during your exam. We strongly recommend that candidates confirm that all applications have been closed and that there is a sufficient and reliable internet connection prior to testing.\n\nQ. What are the rules regarding personal belongings?\n\nA. In general, all personal belongings must remain out of arm’s reach during your exam. However, if your exam program allows personal belongings or testing tools like calculators during an exam, you will find that information in the program-specific policies section of this page.\n\nQ. Can I eat or drink during the exam?\n\nA. Drinking beverages is allowed during your exam, as is chewing gum. Eating or using tobacco products during your exam is prohibited.\n\nQ. Can I take a break during the exam?\n\nA. Each exam program establishes its own break policies. If your program allows breaks, you’ll find that information in the program-specific policies section of this page.\n\nQ. Could I be interrupted by a proctor during my testing session?\n\nA. Yes. Proctors may interrupt exams and take action if they witness any suspicious behavior or rule violations. They may need to offer a reminder (e.g., no talking) or investigate something (e.g., show me the room, your desk, etc.).\n\nQ. What types of prohibited behaviors will the proctor watch for during the exam?\n\nA. Examples of prohibited behaviors include, but are not limited to, failing to follow proctor instructions, looking off the screen, mumbling or speaking aloud, covering your mouth or face, using unauthorized materials (e.g., mobile phones, recording equipment, writing materials), interacting with third parties intentionally or unintentionally, or leaving the webcam view.\n\nQ. What happens if I lean outside the view of the webcam or leave completely?\n\nA. Unless it’s during a scheduled break built into your exam, leaving the webcam view for any reason or duration, even if you have already completed the exam questions, will result in your exam session being terminated and the exam result being invalidated.\n\nImportant: Upon exam completion, you must fully close the OnVUE application before leaving the webcam view.\n\nQ. What happens if my mobile phone rings or issues a notification during an exam?\n\nA. Once your exam has started, keep your mobile phone in the room where you’re testing, but out of arm’s reach in case the proctor needs to call you. Your phone may not be kept in your immediate testing workspace. We recommend placing it on the floor beneath you or a desk/table behind you.\n\nIf your phone rings during the exam, limit your interaction to identifying the caller. To do so, you may reach for your phone, but you must stay within the webcam view. The proctor must be able to see you access the phone. Any mobile phone use other than speaking with a proctor is grounds for exam revocation.\n\nWhen a proctor needs to reach you, they will call, not text. The number will always display as 617-379-0635, and/or caller ID may identify the number as “Pearson VUE.” If this information appears, please answer the call. If your phone rings and the call is not from a Pearson VUE proctor, do not answer it.\n\nIf you receive a text or other notification, ignore it and continue testing. If you wish to silence your phone, alert the proctor so they know you are accessing your phone only to silence notifications.\n\nQ. Can tablets or mobile devices be used for OnVUE exams? What about touchscreens?\n\nA. At this time, OnVUE exams may only be taken on desktop and laptop computers running Windows or macOS operating systems that meet these minimum specifications. OnVUE does not support the use of tablets or touchscreens. As noted above, mobile devices are not allowed and should be placed out of arm’s reach.\n\nQ. What happens if my internet connection is disrupted during an exam or the proctor asks me to restart my application?\n\nA. If a disconnection occurs, the exam timer will pause, and a proctor will attempt to contact you either through your computer or by phone. Note: You must respond or your testing session will be revoked.\n\nShould you lose connection, or if a proctor asks you to restart OnVUE, you can relaunch the application as follows:\n\nLocate your Downloads folder and reopen the OnVUE application.\n\nComplete any necessary check-in steps and then click Next. Your exam should reload and begin. If your exam does not relaunch, contact our customer service team via chat for additional support.\n\nOnce your connection is reestablished and if necessary, the application restarted, you will resume your exam from the question or moment you left.\n\nQ. Can I adjust my font size during my exam?\n\nA. Yes. Even when the testing computer is locked down during an exam, you may still use CTRL+ and CTRL- to magnify content up to 200%. Do not use touchscreen technology at any time during your exam.\n\nQ. Can I read questions aloud during OnVUE exams?\n\nA. No. If this happens, a proctor will ask you to stop reading the questions aloud. If you continue, your exam may be revoked.\n\nQ. What is the digital whiteboard?\n\nA. Because scratch paper or note boards are not allowed when taking an OnVUE exam, some exam programs allow you to use a built-in digital whiteboard to do scratch work or take notes (Opens in new window).\n\nQ. Where can I locate my score report?\n\nA. This differs by exam program. Please review your program’s processes to learn when and where you can access your score report.\n\nQ. Can I use headphones?\n\nA. Headphones and headsets (wired or Bluetooth) are not allowed unless explicitly approved by your test sponsor.\n\nGeneral\n\nQ. Are OnVUE testing policies different from test center policies?\n\nA. Yes. Because of its remote nature, testing with OnVUE requires that candidates agree to additional policies that help protect exam integrity. These include (but are not limited to) consenting to recording and monitoring throughout the exam, along with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other advanced technology techniques. Test-takers must accept these policies during the registration process prior to scheduling an exam.\n\nQ. If an exam is offered in both test centers and via OnVUE, can I book the exam in one delivery method and reschedule it to the other?\n\nA. No, as the rescheduling function cannot be used to change the exam delivery method. Instead, if you wish to change the delivery method, you must cancel the original appointment and then schedule a new one."
