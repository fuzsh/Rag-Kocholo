        "text": "A computer program can be many things. As source code, it is unequivocally text and it is unpatentable written material. As text, it has syntactical structure, which allows a computer to respond to it, and meaning that it communicates to the programming community. A computer program is also an audio-visual work; we see it and hear it as we interact with it. In this way, protecting a computer program is like protecting music, which is often based on both the written score and the sounds we hear. But unlike modern music, which does not always depend on a written score, a computer program must always have source code before it can be heard. Much has already been written about whether computer programs should be copyrightable, but little has been written about access. If a computer program is written in a compiled, rather than an interpretive language, the source code will be converted into assembly or directly into machine code, neither of which has much meaning to anyone but a compute...\n\nAbstract Readers of programs have two main sources of domain information: identifier names and comments. When functions are uncommented, as many are, comprehension is almost exclusively dependent on the identifier names. Assuming that writers of programs want to create quality identifiers (eg, identifiers that include relevant domain knowledge), one must ask how should they go about it. For example, do the initials of a\n\nAbstract Deployed software systems are typically composed of many pieces, not all of which may have been created by the main development team. Often, the provenance of included components—such as external libraries or cloned source code—is not clearly stated, and this uncertainty can introduce technical and ethical concerns that make it difficult for system owners and other stakeholders to manage their software assets."
