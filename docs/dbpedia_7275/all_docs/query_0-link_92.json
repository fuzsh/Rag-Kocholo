        "text": "Miro\n\nMiro 3.5 running on Ubuntu, showing the Miro guide in the main window while playing a podcast.\n\nDeveloper(s)Participatory Culture FoundationInitial release21 February 2006; 18 years ago ( ) (0.8.0-rc4 = earliest known)Stable release6.0 (April 16, 2013; 11 years ago ( )) [1]Development statusInactiveWritten inPython using GTK+Operating systemWindows, macOS, LinuxSize\n\nWindows: 28.50 MB\n\nmacOS: 15.28 MB\n\nLinux: 2.0 MB\n\nSource code: 9.28 MB\n\nAvailable in40 languages[2]TypeMedia player\n\nInternet television\n\nRSS+BitTorrentLicenseGPL-2.0+Websitegetmiro .com\n\nMiro (formerly named Democracy Player or DTV)[3] is an audio, video player and Internet television application developed by the Participatory Culture Foundation. It runs on Microsoft Windows, macOS, FreeBSD and Linux and supports most known video file formats. It offers both audio and video, some in HD quality.\n\nMiro appears to have been abandoned, the last version (6.0) was released in 2013 and is no longer functioning correctly because of changes to the YouTube API.\n\nMiro is free software, released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.[4]\n\nFeatures[edit | edit source]\n\nMiro can automatically download videos from RSS-based \"channels\", manage them and play them. The application is designed to mesh with other Participatory Culture Foundation (PCF) products such as Video Bomb, a social tagging video website, and the Channel Channel, a TV guide for Internet television.\n\nMiro integrates an RSS news aggregator and podcatcher, a BitTorrent client (based on libtorrent), and a media player (VLC media player under Windows, QuickTime under macOS, and xine media player or GStreamer under Linux and FreeBSD). Since 2.0, Miro supports the adding of website bookmarks under the \"Sites\" category; by default, ClearBits.net is preloaded in Miro as a bookmark.\n\nExamples of supported video files are QuickTime, Windows Media Video (WMV), MPEG, Audio Video Interleave (AVI), XVID as a video player. It also supports RSS BitTorrent. When a new video is available, the program will notify and download if possible.\n\nThe Miro Video Converter converts video formats.[5] It is based on FFmpeg with profiles for the Theora (.ogv), .mp4, and WebM video formats supported by various devices.[6]\n\nA developer of Miro wrote that the Windows installer installs proprietary commercial software such as browser add-ons, also known as crapware,[7][improper synthesis?] stating \"This is one of the primary ways we fund continued Miro development.\"[8]\n\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n\nThe application was first launched in 2005 as Democracy Player (sometimes abbreviated as DTV) and later on as Miro in 2007. Video searching of web-based video archives was included in 2007, with access to various archives changing over time.\n\nMiro is mostly written in Python, although it links to various libraries written in a variety of languages. Versions through 2.x had an almost entirely HTML/CSS based UI. Miro uses embedded WebKit in a GTK window on Unix/Linux (Mozilla Gecko/XUL until 3.0.2), WebKit in a Cocoa window on macOS, and Mozilla in a XUL window on Windows. Since version 3.0, the macOS port uses Cocoa and others use GTK. The embedded web browser is used only for web pages.\n\nReception[edit | edit source]\n\nA link to download Miro and Mozilla Firefox appeared on the front page of The Pirate Bay in July 2009 underneath a notice \"We love free software.\"\n\nMiro received a favorable review from Josh Quittner who wrote \"I have seen the future of television and itâ€™s an application called Miro.\"[9] In May 2011, Seth Rosenblatt of CNET wrote, \"Providing one-stop shopping for all your video and audio management desires, open-source and cross-platform Miro deserves much of the praise that's been heaped upon it.\"[10] The Softonic review gave the software a score of 9/10, and described the software as \"a perfect example of how video content from different sources can be integrated into one single application and served directly to your PC in a fast, easy and elegant way.\"[11]\n\nSee also[edit | edit source]\n\nBroadcatching\n\nPeercasting\n\nPopcorn Time, a similar media player\n\nOpen Media Network\n\nReferences[edit | edit source]\n\n[edit | edit source]"
