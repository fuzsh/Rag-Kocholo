Well, sortof. The wording here is strange because you can get a different license from the CA issuer. We can't just pick a license, but the CA issuer might be willing to give us a different one. > Would it be worth getting in contact with CAcert.org in order to try > and have them allow us to redistribute the root certs under conditions > which are acceptable to the Fedora Project? Probably, yes. :) ~spot\n\n4 6 0 0\n\nHi, Please note than I am very far from being a lawyer. I would like to package a particular font for cultural reasons. Its glyphs can be used to render two languages and it has been created on behalf of an official government body for cultural purposes. That body is distributing it through its website. Unfortunately, the archive does not contain any licensing information. I emailed that particular government, and got a reply saying the font was \"was developed for free distribution\" and that the government \"(allows the) public to freely download. It is copyrighted to <insert government body here>\". I have read the licensing guidelines for fonts and I am aware that is not sufficient, as IIRC that means the font cannot be modified, and probably cannot be distributed by third parties. Am I right in believing this? I have asked them to add a copyright notice and a license to the zip file, preferably (of course) the SIL Open Font License 1.1. Any advice would be nice. Thanks, François\n\n2 2 0 0\n\nGreetings. Some folks were telling me that they thought that our avant-window-navigator package might be infringing on: US patent 7434177 http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=7,434,177 http://www.wikipatents.com/US-Patent-7434177/user-interface-for-providing-c… Any thoughts on this? I don't see mention of it in the review for the package: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=238863 Does the patent only deal with the \"Zoom\" functionality? Or is there just anything that lists a bunch of icons? kevin\n\n3 3 0 0\n\nOn 06/08/2010 15:01, Tom \"spot\" Callaway wrote: > Thanks for the update, the pages have been updated accordingly. > > ~spot Thank you. Just a little precision, the wiki now reads: > Older versions of this license (prior to Teeworlds 0.5.2) contained an > additional clause: > I talked about the 0.5.2 version because it's the version included in fedora. But the license was in fact changed in the 0.5.0 release[1] (the last version having the 4th clause in its license is teeworlds version 0.4.3 [2]) So, to be even clearer, the wiki page should read: > > Older versions of this license (prior to Teeworlds 0.5.0) contained an > additional clause: > (you can check yourself the license.txt file contained in the sources, if you want (I just did)) [1] http://teeworlds.com/files/teeworlds-0.5.0-linux_x86.tar.gz [2] http://teeworlds.com/files/teeworlds-0.4.3-linux_x86.tar.gz Regards, -- Florent Le Coz\n\n2 1 0 0\n\nHello, The license of Teeworlds (http://teeworlds.com) contained in the page https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing/Teeworlds is out of date. It has been updated, and in the 0.5.2 version (which is the version included in fedora's repositories) is now as follow: license.txt (included in the original sources, and as %doc in the fedora rpm) > Copyright (C) 2007-2008 Magnus Auvinen > > This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied > warranty.

The issue described in the wiki page about this license is then not longer of a concern since the clause 4 has been removed. This page should be updated, and the description changed (or removed). Also, in the license list page (http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing#Software_License_List) the \"FSF Free?\" column is \"Yes, but only for teeworlds\", though it should now be \"Yes\". Regards, -- Florent Le Coz\n\n1 0 0 0"
