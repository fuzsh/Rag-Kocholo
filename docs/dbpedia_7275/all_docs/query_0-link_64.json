        "text": "Xubuntu 6.06 LTS\n\nedit\n\nThe first official stand-alone release of Xubuntu was version 6.06 long term support (LTS), which was made available on 1 June 2006.\n\nIt was introduced with the statement:\n\nXubuntu is the newest official Ubuntu derivative distribution, using the Xfce desktop environment and a selection of GTK2 applications. Its lightweight footprint is well suited for low-end hardware and thin clients. Xubuntu builds on the solid foundation of Ubuntu, with world-class hardware support and access to a vast repository of additional software.[13]\n\nThe version used Linux kernel 2.6.15.7 and Xfce 4.4 beta 1. Applications included the Thunar file manager, GDM desktop manager, Abiword word processor and Gnumeric spread sheet, Evince PDF document viewer, Xarchiver archive manager, Xfburn CD burner, Firefox 1.5.0.3 web browser, Thunderbird 1.5.0.2 email client and the GDebi package manager.[13]\n\nXubuntu 6.10\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 6.10 was released on 26 October 2006. This version used Xfce 4.4 beta 2 and included Upstart, the Firefox 2.0 web browser, the Gaim 2.0.0 beta 3.1 instant messaging client along with new versions of AbiWord and Gnumeric. The media player was gxine which replaced Xfmedia. The previous xffm4 file manager was replaced by Thunar. It introduced redesigned artwork for the bootup splash screen, the login window and the desktop theme.[14][15]\n\nThe developers claimed that this version of Xubuntu could run on 64 MB of RAM, with 128 MB \"strongly recommended\".[16]\n\nXubuntu 7.04\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 7.04 was released on 19 April 2007. This release was based on Xfce 4.4.[17][18]\n\nMichael Larabel of Phoronix carried out detailed benchmark testing of betas for Ubuntu 7.04, Kubuntu 7.04 and Xubuntu 7.04 in February 2007 on two different computers, one with dual Intel Clovertown processors and the other with an AMD Sempron. After a series of gzip compression, LAME compilation, and LAME encoding tasks he concluded, \"in these tests with the dual Clovertown setup we found the results to be indistinguishable. However, with the AMD Sempron, Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty Fawn Herd 4 had outperformed both Kubuntu and the lighter-weight Xubuntu. Granted on a slower system the lightweight Xubuntu should have a greater performance advantage\".[19]\n\nXubuntu 7.10\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 7.10 was released on 18 October 2007. It was based upon Xfce, 4.4.1 and added updated translations along with a new theme, MurrinaStormCloud, using the Murrine Engine.[20][21]\n\nApplication updates included Pidgin 2.2.0, (Gaim was renamed Pidgin) and GIMP 2.4. This Xubuntu version allowed the installation of Firefox extensions and plug-ins through the Add/Remove Software interface.[20][21]\n\nThe developers claimed that this version of Xubuntu could run on 64 MB of RAM, with 128 MB \"strongly recommended\".[22]\n\nXubuntu 8.04 LTS\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 8.04 Long Term Support (LTS) was made available on 24 April 2008. This version of Xubuntu used Xfce 4.4.2, Xorg 7.3 and Linux kernel 2.6.24. It introduced PolicyKit for permissions control, PulseAudio and a new printing manager. It also introduced Wubi, that allowed Windows users to install Xubuntu as a program on Windows.[23]\n\nApplications included were Firefox 3 Beta 5, Brasero CD/DVD burning application, Transmission BitTorrent client, Mousepad text editor, AbiWord word processor and Ristretto image viewer[23]\n\nXubuntu 8.10\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 8.10 was released on 30 October 2008. This version of Xubuntu brought a new version of Abiword, version 2.6.4, the Listen Multimedia Player and introduced the Catfish desktop search application. It used Linux kernel 2.6.27, X.Org 7.4. There was an installation option of an encrypted private directory using ecryptfs-utils. The Totem media player was included.[24]\n\nXubuntu 9.04\n\nedit\n\nVersion 9.04 was released on 23 April 2009. The development team advertised this release as giving improved boot-up times, \"benefiting from the Ubuntu core developer team's improvements to boot-time code, the Xubuntu 9.04 desktop boots more quickly than ever. This means you can spend less time waiting, and more time being productive with your Xubuntu desktop\".[25]\n\nXubuntu 9.04 used Xfce 4.6, which included a new Xfce Settings Manager dialog, the new Xconf configuration system, an improved desktop menu and clock, new notifications, and remote file system application Gigolo.[25]\n\nThis release also brought all new artwork and incorporated the Murrina Storm Cloud GTK+ theme and a new XFWM4 window manager theme. 9.04 also introduced new versions of many applications, including the AbiWord word processor, Brasero CD/DVD burner and Mozilla Thunderbird e-mail client. It used X.Org server 1.6. The default file system was ext3, but ext4 was an option at installation.[25]\n\nXubuntu 9.10\n\nedit\n\n29 October 2009 saw the release of Xubuntu 9.10, which utilized Xfce 4.6.1, Linux kernel 2.6.31 and by default the ext4 file system and GRUB 2. This release included the Exaile 0.3.0 music player, the Xfce4 power manager replaced the Gnome Power Manager and improved desktop notifications using notify-osd. Upstart boot-up speed was improved.[26]\n\nThe release promised \"faster application load times and reduced memory footprint for a number of your favorite Xfce4 applications thanks to improvements in library linking provided by ld's --as-needed flag\".[26]\n\nXubuntu 10.04 LTS\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 10.04 Long Term Support (LTS) was released on 29 April 2010. It moved to PulseAudio and replaced the Xsane scanner utilities with Simple Scan. It also incorporated the Ubuntu Software Center, which had been introduced in Ubuntu 9.10, to replace the old Add/Remove Software utility. The included spreadsheet application, Gnumeric was updated to version 1.10.1 and new games were introduced. Because of incompatibilities in the gnome-screensaver screensaver application, it was replaced by xscreensaver. The default theme was an updated version of Albatross, designed by the Shimmer Team.[27]\n\nThis version of Xubuntu officially required a 700 MHz x86 processor, 128 MB of RAM, with 256 MB RAM \"strongly recommended\" and 3 GB of disk space.[28]\n\nXubuntu 10.10\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 10.10 was released on 10 October 2010. It included Parole, the Xfce4 media player, XFBurn CD/DVD writer in place of Brasero and Xfce4-taskmanager replaced Gnome-Task-Manager. These changes were all to lighten the release's memory footprint. AbiWord was updated to version 2.8.6 and Gnumeric to 1.10.8. This release also introduced the Bluebird theme, from the Shimmer Team.[29]\n\nXubuntu 11.04\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 11.04 was released on 28 April 2011. This version was based upon Xfce 4.8 and introduced editable menus using any menu editor that meets the freedesktop.org standards. This version also introduced a new Elementary Xubuntu icon theme, the Droid font by default and an updated installation slide show.[30]\n\nWhile Ubuntu 11.04 introduced the new default Unity interface, Xubuntu did not adopt Unity and instead retained its existing Xfce interface. Although the developers have decided to retain a minimalist interface, Xubuntu 11.04 has a new dock-like application launcher to achieve a more modern look.[31]\n\nXubuntu 11.10\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 11.10 was released on 13 October 2011, the same day that Ubuntu 11.10 was released.[32]\n\nIn this release gThumb became the new image viewer/organizer, Leafpad replaced Mousepad as the default text editor and LightDM was introduced as the log-in manager. The release also incorporated pastebinit for cut and paste actions.[32]\n\nXubuntu 12.04 LTS\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 12.04 incorporated many changes including some default shortcuts which were altered and new ones added, plus there were many appearance changes, including a new logo and wallpaper. Fixes were included for Greybird, Ubiquity, Plymouth, LightDM, and Terminal themes.[33][34]\n\nThe release shipped with version 3.2.14 of the Linux kernel. Pavucontrol was introduced to replace xfce4-mixer as it did not support PulseAudio. The Alacarte menu editor was used by default.[33][34]\n\nThe minimum system requirements for this release were 512 MiB of RAM, 5 GB of hard disk space, and a graphics card and monitor capable of at least 800×600 pixel resolution.[33]\n\nWhisker Menu, a new application launcher for Xubuntu, was introduced via a Personal Package Archive for Xubuntu 12.04 LTS. It proved a popular option and later became the default launcher in Xubuntu 14.04 LTS.[35]\n\nXubuntu 12.10\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 12.10 was released on 18 October 2012. This release introduced the use of Xfce 4.10, as well as new versions of Catfish, Parole, LightDM, Greybird and the Ubiquity slideshow. The application menu was slightly reorganized, with settings-related launchers moved to the Settings Manager. The release also included updated artwork, new desktop wallpaper, a new look to the documentation and completely rewritten offline documentation. On 32-bit systems, hardware supporting PAE is required.[36]\n\nThe release included one notable bug fix: \"No more window traces or \"black on black\" in installer\".[37] This release of Xubuntu does not support UEFI Secure Boot, unlike Ubuntu 12.10, which allows Ubuntu to run on hardware designed for Windows 8. It was expected that this feature would be included in the next release of Xubuntu.[37]\n\nXubuntu 13.04\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 13.04 was released on 25 April 2013. It was intended as a maintenance release with few new features. It incorporated updated documentation, a new version of Catfish (0.6.1), updates to the Greybird theme, GIMP and Gnumeric were reintroduced, a new version of Parole (0.5.0) and that duplicate partitions are no longer shown on desktop or in the Thunar file manager.[38][39]\n\nThis was the first version of Xubuntu with a support period of 9 months for the interim (non-LTS) releases, instead of 18 months.[38]\n\nStarting with this release the Xubuntu ISO images will not fit on a CD as they now average 800 MB. The new image target media is at least a 1.0 GB USB device or DVD. The decision to change the ISO image size was based upon the amount of developer time spent trying to shrink the files to fit them on a standard size CD. This ISO size change also allowed the inclusion of two applications that had been previously dropped due to space constraints, Gnumeric and GIMP.[38][40][41]\n\nXubuntu 13.10\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 13.10 was released on 17 October 2013. This release included some improvements over the previous release, including a new version of xfce4-settings and a new dialog box for display settings. There was also a new color theme tool and gtk-theme-config was added as default. This release also included new wallpaper, new GTK+ themes, with Gtk3.10 support and the LightDM greeter. The official Xubuntu documentation was also updated.[42]\n\nXubuntu 14.04 LTS\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 14.04 LTS was released on 17 April 2014 and, being an LTS, featured three years of support.[43] It incorporated the Xfdesktop 4.11, the Mugshot user account profile editor, the MenuLibre menu editor in place of Alacarte and the Light-locker screen lock to replace Xscreensaver. The Whisker Menu was introduced as the default application launching menu, having been formerly a Personal Package Archive option introduced in Xubuntu 12.04 LTS. It replaced the previous default menu system. The Xfdesktop also supported using different wallpapers on each workspace.[35][44][45]\n\nXubuntu 14.10\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 14.10 was released on 23 October 2014. This release incorporated very few new features. Changed were a new Xfce Power Manager plugin added to the panel and that items in the new alt-tab dialog could be clicked with the mouse. To illustrate the customization of the operating system, 14.10 featured pink highlight colours, something that could easily be changed by users, if desired.[46][47]\n\nXubuntu 15.04\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 15.04 was released on 23 April 2015.[48] This release featured Xfce 4.12 and included new colour schemes, with redundant File Manager (Settings) menu entries removed. Otherwise this release was predominantly a bug-fix and package upgrade release, with very few significant changes.[49]\n\nXubuntu 15.10\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 15.10 was released on 22 October 2015.[50]\n\nThis release had only minimal changes over 15.04. It incorporated the Xfce4 Panel Switch for the backup and restoration of panels and included five preset panel layouts.\n\nGreybird accessibility icons were used for the window manager. Gnumeric and Abiword were replaced with LibreOffice Calc and LibreOffice Writer and a new default LibreOffice theme, libreoffice-style-elementary, was provided.[51][52][53]\n\nXubuntu 16.04 LTS\n\nedit\n\nReleased on 21 April 2016, Xubuntu 16.04 is an LTS version, supported for three years until April 2019.[54]\n\nThis release offered few new features. It included a new package of wallpapers and the replacement of the Ubuntu Software Center with Gnome Software, the same as in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.[55] Reviewer Jack Wallen said, \"The truth of the matter is, the Ubuntu Software Center has been a horrible tool for a very long time. Making this move will greatly improve the Ubuntu experience for every user\".[56]\n\nXubuntu 16.10\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 16.10 was released on 13 October 2016.[57]\n\nThis version of Xubuntu introduced very few new features. The official release notice stated, \"This release has seen little visible change since April's 16.04, however much has been done towards supplying Xubuntu with Xfce packages built with GTK3, including the porting of many plugins and Xfce Terminal to GTK3\".[58]\n\nXubuntu 17.04\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 17.04 was released on 13 April 2017.[59]\n\nThis version continued the then-porting of Xfce panel plugins and applications from 16.10, along with a slight refresh of core theming to improve GTK3 support. It is also the first Xubuntu version to install a swap file instead of the former swap partition.\n\nJoey Sneddon of OMG Ubuntu indicated that this release is mostly just bug fixes and has little in the way of new features.[60]\n\nXubuntu 17.10\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 17.10 was released on 19 October 2017.[61]\n\nThis release included only minor changes including the GNOME Font Viewer included by default and that the client side decorations consume less space within the Greybird GTK+ theme.[62]\n\nDistrowatch noted that Xubuntu 17.10, \"includes significant improvements to accelerated video playback on Intel video cards. The distribution also includes support for driverless printing and includes the GNOME Font Viewer by default\".[63]\n\nXubuntu 18.04 LTS\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 18.04 is a long-term support version, released on 26 April 2018.[64][65]\n\nIn this version, removed the GTK Theme Configuration, the Greybird GTK+ theme was upgraded to 3.22.8 version, including HiDPI support, Google Chrome GTK+ 3 styles and a new dark theme. Sound Indicator was replaced by the Xfce PulseAudio Plugin. The release introduced a new plugin for the panel, xfce4-notifyd.

This is because the next Xfce 4.16 is still under development, with the first preview released last month\".[87]\n\nXubuntu 21.04\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 21.04 is a standard release, made on 22 April 2021.[88]\n\nThis release introduced Xfce 4.16 which exclusively uses GTK3. A new minimal installation option was available. It also included two new applications: the HexChat IRC client and the Synaptic package manager as well as some general user interface changes.[89]\n\nThe release also included a full Adwaita icon theme, instead of shipping the partial version from previous releases due to \"sub-par experience.\"[90]\n\nXubuntu 21.10\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 21.10 is a standard release, and was released on 14 October 2021.[91]\n\nThis release included the addition of GNOME Disk Analyzer, GNOME Disk Utility, and the media playback software Rhythmbox.[92] It also included PipeWire alongside the already existing PulseAudio, in line with other Ubuntu flavours.\n\nXubuntu 22.04 LTS\n\nedit\n\nThis long term support release was made on 21 April 2022 and will be supported for three years until April 2025.[93][94]\n\nThe release uses Xfce 4.16 and the GTK 3.24.33 toolkit.

Updated applications included the addition of spellchecking to the Mousepad text editor along with session backup and restore. The Ristretto image viewer now has improved thumbnail support, along with performance improvements and a new version of the Whisker Menu Plugin adds new customization options with preferences and CSS classes, for theme development.[93][94]\n\nXubuntu 22.10\n\nedit\n\nXubuntu 22.10 was released on 20 October 2022, as an interim release supported for nine months, until July 2023.[95]\n\nThis release used Xfce 4.16, with some elements from 4.17 included for testing and preview purposes.

Formerly known as Xubuntu Core, this project has been supported for eight years as an unofficial community project, but is now recognized as an \"officially supported subproject\".
