AvantFAX® is a web application for managing faxes on HylaFAX™ fax servers.

AvantFAX allows users on any platform to view and send faxes without having to install special software. It also allows administrators to manage users, their permissions, fax lines, fax categories, etc.

AvantFAX can be accessed from the local network and remotely via Internet using standard networking equipment.

Why should my company/organization be interested?

AvantFAX is open source and is released under the GNU General Public License just like Linux and HylaFAX.

Do you have multiple users who need to use the fax machine?

Do you need an efficient way to archive and search your sent and received faxes?

Do you need a system that is robust enough to handle multiple fax lines and thousands of faxes without ''crashing''?

Do you need to fax the same document to multiple recipients?

Do you need a solution that you can customize and integrate into your document workflow?

If you've answered yes, AvantFAX is definitely what you're looking for. Also, commercial support and custom installations are available.
