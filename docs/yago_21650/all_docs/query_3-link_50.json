        "text": "It’s easy to see why Yorgos Lanthimos’ latest film, Poor Things, has caused some controversy. If you didn’t know — spoilers ahead— the film centers around Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), the Frankenstein-esque creation of Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe). Dr. Godwin, upon finding a drowned woman’s body nearly perfectly preserved, transfers the brain of the woman’s unborn child into her own body. He names the creature Bella, raises her as his own daughter, and tries to teach her the ways of the world in a strange and isolated London townhouse.\n\nAs Bella — essentially a child in a beautiful woman’s body — learns to talk and read and the basics of everyday life, she quickly also discovers the delights of masturbation and, shortly after, sex. It’s a direction I hadn’t known the film would take before I saw it. It was quite interesting (and fun) to find out that, despite having seen some pretty raunchy films in my time, I can still be shocked by a mainstream movie.\n\nUpon leaving the cinema afterwards and looking up, as I tend to, the opinions of my fellow Letterboxd users, I saw one of my mutuals announce that they were leaving the site, so disgusted were they by the overwhelmingly positive reaction to the film there.\n\nAnd I sympathise. Lanthimos presents us with a difficult topic that shouldn’t go unexamined simply for the sake of suspended disbelief, for going along with the ride. It’s a hard question to answer and one that we — hopefully — will never find a true answer to. If a woman had the mind of a child, how quickly would she discover sex, and how would she feel about it?\n\nThe route our heroine goes down has been positively received by many, and seen as an allegory for, among others, transness, autism and asexuality. And why not, since ‘Poor Things’ covers this ground with its variety of themes: ‘rebirth,’ body horror, defiance of societal norms and complete sexual and bodily autonomy.\n\nI found myself relating, strangely, to Bella, for my own perceived shortcomings. At the age of twenty-seven, I am single, despite certain ‘dalliances’ and dating attempts — in fact, I’ve never been in a relationship. This has caused much confusion among people, the older generation in particular, though I can’t say it hasn’t baffled more conventional people my own age, too. ‘But why?’ asks my grandfather over Sunday dinner, and my former boss at the office Christmas party, and an ex-best friend in the smoking area of a night club. ‘Why don’t you have a boyfriend?’ My singleness intersects at a point between choice and luck, and various obstacles in my way at the crucial developmental age which meant that timeline-wise, I was a little thrown off. That doesn’t seem to matter to the conventional-minded of my peers. My shortcoming must be my fault and mine alone, and if I thought I was going to go along my merry way without it being commented upon, then I was as naive as I look.\n\nThe way in which men gawp and gasp and cling their heads when Bella makes a decision they perceive to be ‘wrong’ simply because it’s unconventional didn’t feel a million miles away from my own experience (though, thankfully, Mark Ruffalo’s character is a pantomime version of the kinds of men I’ve come into contact with). I’ve had certain male figures in my life profess that they worry about me desperately because of my situation — Poor Me, more like! — when I’m not worried at all.\n\nBella, too, is unbothered when she finds her way into a brothel and makes money in the oldest profession. She swans in and out as she pleases, her bafflement at the seemingly invisible obstacles others place in front of her both liberating and amusing. The autism motif here is clear — and perhaps even the trans motif, too. Bella can place no importance on a social etiquette she doesn’t even know exists, and, even when it is explained to her, disregards it as illogical in order to pursue, as she puts it, “sex and money.”\n\nHerein lies a more difficult aspect of Lanthimos’s film. While Bella finds her new job in Paris liberating and rewarding (even funding her scholarly pursuits in medicine with the money she makes), her experience in the brothel is a largely sanitised one. She has a kinship with the madam of the brothel, Swiney, played by Kathryn Hunter. There’s no signs of the stickiness of exploitation, which does, of course, frequently occur in sex work. The brothel’s clientele largely consist of well-meaning, if unsanitary, Parisian men; we see no downsides to Bella’s job other than occasional sexual dissatisfaction. Despite zero protection of any of the following, there’s no syphilis, no chlamydia, no gonorrhea; no unwanted pregnancies, and, crucially, no sexual misconduct. Can ‘Poor Things’ still be a feminist tale without even the hint of the dangers of the job, especially when sex workers continue to face horrific levels of sexual harassment and assault? An astonishing 45–75% of sex workers are estimated to experience sexual violence on the job, according to the Gender Policy Report. We’re shown the absurdity of the shame of sex work — nice one, thanks, Yorg — but he shies away from the trickier question. What happens when a rejection of this shame, and a participation in the world’s oldest profession means confronting the high likelihood of sexual violence from men?\n\nMaybe Lanthimos wants us to explain this away to ourselves through the magical realism and whimsy of the film’s setting. Of course nothing bad happens to Bella, silly! In this universe, ducks have dog’s heads and Willem Dafoe blows gas bubbles! Or perhaps, to Yorg, the only thing stopping women from crossing that boundary is that the world is full of of proud, close-minded men like Duncan; if society would simply get a grip and realise women’s bodies are their own — in other words, if the world was full of liberal, Yorgos Lanthimos-types — women everywhere would be fucking and sucking for francs, and the world would be nice and lovely and sex wouldn’t be taboo and nobody would be in poverty ever, because there is always appetite for the pleasures of the flesh.\n\nWhich is why the absence of the downsides of the job is so suspect. Does Lanthimos actually think this? Hopefully he’s wise enough not to, and confident that his audience are equally as discerning. But the omittance did make me a little wary."
