        "text": "Emma Stone is getting weird in her new movie \"Poor Things.\" Searchlight Pictures dropped the full trailer for the film on June 8 and in it, Stone stars as Bella Baxter, a very strange girl who's been brought back to life. At first, though she had the body of an adult, she has the mind of an infant, and quickly ages and matures over time. She eventually runs away with a lawyer (Mark Ruffalo) as she longs to explore the world and all it has to offer — including sex. The movie is adapted from Alasdair Gray's 1992 novel of the same name.\n\nOn Oct. 19, Searchlight released an \"extended look\" trailer for the movie where Stone reflects on the film, which she calls \"very funny.\" \"I wanted to play Bella because it felt like acceptance of what it is to be a woman, to be free, to be scared, and brave,\" she says, in part.\n\nThe film, which Stone also produced, is directed by Yorgos Lanthimos — who also directed 2015's \"The Lobster\" and 2018's \"The Favourite,\" which Stone also starred in. Stone opened up to Vogue about how she sees the upcoming film in a May 31 interview, explaining, \"It's such a fairy tale, and a metaphor — clearly, this can't actually happen — but the idea that you could start anew as a woman, as this body that's already formed, and see everything for the first time and try to understand the nature of sexuality, or power, or money or choice, the ability to make choices and live by your own rules and not society's — I thought that was a really fascinating world to go into.\"\n\nStone said Bella has \"a great opportunity\" to discover the world while not being marked by \"shame or trauma.\" \"She was the most joyous character in the world to play because she has no shame about anything,\" she explained. The film was originally scheduled to be released in September but was delayed by Searchlight until winter amid the ongoing actors' strike.\n\nAhead, here's what we know about \"Poor Things\" so far."
