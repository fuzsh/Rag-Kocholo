        "text": "“ What I did on Earth, the pain and destruction I caused was immeasurable. What I did to those people... what I did to my son. I deserve death. And yet... I think... I miss my wife. ”\n\nNolan is the deuteragonist of Invincible, serving as the main antagonist of Season 1 before redeeming himself in Season 2. He is a Viltrumite, better known as the \"superhero\" Omni-Man and also known by his adopted name Nolan Grayson. He is the father of Mark and Oliver Grayson, the estranged husband of his first wife Debbie Grayson and widower to his late second wife Andressa.\n\nHistory[]\n\nA Soldier's Life[]\n\nLong after the \"Great Purge\", Nolan (pronounced on Viltrum, Nowl-Ahn) was born on the distant planet Viltrum, into an imperialistic race of super-beings known as the Viltrumites. His parents died when he was young, and Nolan was indoctrinated with the Viltrumite creed of conquering as much of the universe as possible to assimilate other worlds, species, and civilizations into the Viltrumite Empire. Nolan joined the Viltrumite military forces as a young man and rapidly rose through their ranks through years of successful war and conquest, earning himself a highly esteemed reputation amongst his people, labelling him as \"The Great Nowl-Ahn\". Eventually, the size of their ever-growing empire and their reduced population made their forces spread too thin. This prompted the Viltrumites to look for more efficient methods of galactic domination. To counter the raw man-power needed for a full-scale invasion into target planets, it was instead decided that the most trusted officers of the Viltrumite military would be assigned planets to weaken sufficiently in order to allow for a seamless takeover.\n\nAt one point, Nolan and a female Viltrumite were stationed to a rocky planet, where the gravity is somewhat stronger than most planets, upon failing to discover life or resources, they were ready to leave. Instead his friend was bitten and decapitated by the planet's inhabitants: Rognarrs. Nolan is attacked and overwhelmed by the beasts, nearly killed, but somehow survived. He would document this event, describing the Rognarrs as part of a major weakness to the Viltrum Empire.\n\nNolan was assigned Earth and, as such, traveled there and created a new life on Earth, he took up the name Nolan Grayson and took a job as a writer. Privately, he presented himself as a superhero to hide his true persona as Omni-Man and began to work very closely with a well-respected superhero team, the original Guardians of the Globe and Global Defense Agency. Nolan also married a human woman, he saved while on hero duty, named Debbie, and she became aware of his identity. They had a Human/Viltrumite son who they named Mark. One day, Nolan told a young Mark a water-downed version why he came to Earth, making himself and his race seem more benevolent. At some point, Omni-Man met others like Cecil Stedman and Art Rosenbaum, who would consider him a friend. Despite refusing to join the team, he agreed to become a \"reserved help\" whenever they needed his aid. From time to time, he fought against the Representative for the Coalition of Planets, Allen, and always bested him during his attempts to evaluate the planet's strength to defend itself.\n\nLife on Earth[]\n\nA few years after his arrival on Earth, Nolan was summoned by War Woman for \"reserved help\" and arrived at a secret facility. He saved the Guardians from a collapsing ceiling before they questioned his new outfit, and together they also defeated the Lizard League.\n\nSome years later, he returned home from an unknown mission, and encountered Debbie and Mark who was dressed up in duct tape, calling himself \"Duct Tape Man\", an alternate hero persona he considered using if he wouldn't get his Viltrumite powers. Nolan believed it was merely going to get him in harm's way, Debbie then decided it would be best to just be normal, and took him to the bathroom to remove his duct tape. Debbie decided they will love Mark even without his powers. As she leaves, however, Nolan becomes enraged but then, he has a second thought, horrified, he remained frozen at his brief feelings.\n\nAt a baseball game, a young Mark gets ready to hit the ball as Nolan angrily watches from afar. Debbie walks up to him and asks what was wrong; Nolan says that if he had to watch it, he would rather do so from the sky, but Debbie told him to sit down with everybody else and not be a weirdo. Nolan mentions that the game was a waste of everybody's time, since he could be doing a lot of other things. Mark gets ready to hit the ball, and Debbie tells Nolan to appreciate Mark as the young kid he was. She tells him that children bring back good memories and could remind them what life was all about, and this makes Nolan smile. As a result, he changes his tune to cheer on his son and is pleased when Mark's team wins the game. Mark walks up to his parents, excitedly asking them he had seen what he had done and his father confirmed he saw and expresses pride in him. Overtime, his time on Earth made him happy but he remained loyal to Viltrum.\n\nFatherly Training[]\n\nFrom underground, the criminals known as the Mauler Twins rise and attack the White House, but one complains that he should have checked his clone's calculations, since they were supposed to be inside the building. The other gets angry and complains that he is not a clone; they are shot at, but they are unfazed. From the clone's left, Steve shoots the twin, and shakily orders him to back off. The twin approaches him, and Steve shoots him once again, injuring him this time. Before he could kill Steve, the superheroes approach the Twins and order civilians to evacuate while they fight. The Twin with an injured eye questions War Woman if she could sit this fight out and let them kill the president, but she tells him that it was not her style.\n\nThe heroes help civilians evacuate while the Twins broke through the walls to make it inside. One of the Twins throws a woman, so Darkwing catches her. However, when they fall to the ground, the Twins throws a tank, which forces him to use his strength to protect them both from being crushed. He was not able to get them both out, but managed to get the woman out using a grappling hook. When it appeared he would be crushed, Omni-Man lifted the tank and helped him get out.\n\nThe Mauler Twins kept on fighting the heroes while they attempted to help every civilian escape the White House. Soon it was just the heroes against the twins, who were swiftly defeated once they had no more civilians to distract the heroes with.\n\nLater, Nolan makes it home and kisses his wife, who tells him that they should get him out of that suit. Mark complains that his parents should not talk about sex in front of him, but his mother tells him that he should be happy to hear them express their love. They mention they would be going to Berlin, which makes Mark jealous. However, his father tells him that he could go himself once his powers kicked in. Mark leaves for school, and looks at his father fly away with his mother. He tries flying himself, but does not manage to do it and instead gets embarrassed when he finds out somebody was seeing him jump up and down.\n\nWhen Mark gets home, Debbie tells him that she had heated up German bratwurst for him. He tells her that he had an interesting day. Nolan makes it home and tells them he had been fighting a dragon in Hong Kong and gets ready to listen to Mark's day. He told them that he had been getting his powers, but his father does not react until Debbie kicks him. Nolan congratulates him, and tells him that they would train the next day.\n\nMark wakes up at 6:00 AM, very tired, and his father tells him they would train. Once they are in the sky, his father tells him he would get the hang of flying, having to focus at first. His father tells him that flying could tire him, and to use momentum in order to relax from time to time. He told his son to relax and realized Mark had practiced the night before. He tells him to land, but Mark had a hard time doing so and eventually crashed into the ground. Nolan told him to hit him and to use his whole body while doing it, even practicing while flying. Nolan showed Mark how to punch, and hurt Mark, which Nolan told him was part of his preparation.\n\nAt home, Debbie reads, and sees Mark go to his room. She asks Nolan how bad the training had gone, and he says that he had pushed their son very hard, since it was what he needed. She asks if maybe he had pushed him too hard, which makes Nolan very mad. Debbie asks him what had gotten into him, and he admits he did not know, but thinks that maybe their lives would have been better if Mark had not gotten his powers.\n\nMark realized he needed something to punch in order to blow off steam and hears gunfire. Three criminals run from the police after robbing a place. Mark fights a big criminal and manages to hurt him. Omni-Man approached him and told him he looked ridiculous, also mentioning that he had skipped a few steps since he had caused a lot of destruction. Mark asks his father to hit him, since he was not ready before, but his father told him that he would not hit him. Mark grew desperate and told his father he knew that he did not believe in him, but he wanted to prove he was strong enough and wanted to be like him. Nolan hugs his son and tells him that he would be, then telling him to follow him.\n\nThey fly to a tailor, where he tells Mark that he would take him shopping for a suit. Art Rosenbaum greets Mark and tells him it was a pleasure to meet him, and gets Mark excited. Art hands him a suit, but Mark was not sure about orange and yellow and wanted something more iconic, which Art understood. Art told him that he needed a name from him so he could grab inspiration from there, telling him to let him know later.\n\nThe Guardians of the Globe meet, but realize that none of them called one another. Red Rush sees Omni-Man fly towards The Immortal in order to punch him and manages to push him out of the way. The heroes are in shock and gasp, attacking him at the same time. As Red Rush attacked him, he managed to grab hold of him and squeezed his head while receiving punches from the speedster until he crushed his skull.\n\nMartian Man wraps himself around Omni-Man, and The Immortal asks him why he had killed Red Rush while preparing to punch him. Omni-Man receives punches, which make him stagger and kills Darkwing while slamming him to the ground, followed by Green Ghost, who had caught Darkwing's body. Aquarus attacks Omni-Man, and The Immortal says that there must be somebody controlling him. However, they agree that they would kill him so that he did not kill them instead. Omni-Man managed to kill Aquarus, which angered Martian Man, who held onto Omni-Man, so his colleagues could hit him. Omni-Man managed to get Martian Man off him and deeply injured The Immortal, subsequently killing War Woman. The Immortal asked him why he had done it, but Omni-Man did not answer and decapitated him, groaning from his wounds after he did so.\n\nPost-Guardians' Massacre[]\n\nThe Guardians are dead, and Omni-Man lays next to them, injured as well. A door opens, and invisible agents look at the scene, followed by paramedics, who are shocked and disgusted at the scene. They find Omni-Man is alive, and they move the bodies out from the room. Cecil Stedman mentions he had never seen anything like it and bangs his fist against a table. Omni-Man is brought to a hospital room, where he is in a coma.\n\nThey make it to Nolan's room, where they see Nolan laying without responding. Cecil introduces himself and tells them that they have no idea who did it. Debbie tells him that he has some nerve, but he tells them that the Guardians had been murdered, and they were unable to bring them back, with Nolan being the only survivor. Cecil tells them that the news would eventually spread, but he wanted them to know first. Debbie asks for materials and refuses to leave Nolan, mentioning that she had patched him up for twenty years. Donald gets a report that there was an undergoing attack with multiple casualties, and Mark leaves to go help out.\n\nLater, Mark visits his father, saying that even if he did not like being in teams, he found Teen Team to be very cool except for Rex Splode. Debbie overheard Mark talking about Eve and asked who she was, but Mark said she was nobody. He thanked her for the dinners she had prepared, and they talk about the side part of being a superhero.\n\nWhen Nolan awoke, he told Mark that Debbie had told him that he was keeping the planet safe and wanted to hear everything. Mark went to Maya's room, but found out she had died, which Nolan described as part of the job. Mark left, and Nolan demanded they give him his suit back.\n\nLater, news broke that the Guardians had been missing for a week.\n\nAt training, Mark tried attacking his father, who at first was able to dodge his punch. However, when Mark landed one, he told him that he needed to be able to take one as well, and was about to punch him until Debbie interrupted. Cecil visited them and told them that they had seen somebody from Mars approaching Earth and needed to deal with him. Debbie refused, and Mark offered to do it. Nolan told him to knock some sense into the guy and send him back where he came from.\n\nNolan tells Cecil what he remembers from the night the Guardians were killed. He tells him that he had gotten a distress call from the Guardians, but everything seemed fine when he had gotten there. However, the lights had gone out, and he fought against the enemy until he passed out. Cecil is not convinced and says that he had never seen Nolan lose like that, but believed that somebody was acting clever.\n\nThe Flaxan army invades the city once again, and Robot tells Teen Team that the Flaxans were now immune to the time stream, and they should consider the city lost. He tells them that he will contact Cecil and request a nuclear response, but everybody disagrees.\n\nInvincible starts fighting the army, but is swiftly brought down and punched repeatedly in the face by the leader. Omni-Man arrives and starts defending the city, resisting all the attacks thrown at him and sending the enemies back where they had come from. However, when the leader looked up at Omni-Man once more, he punched him and went into the portal with him. Mark was worried but inadvertently revealed Omni-Man was his father to his teammates. When Mark got home, Debbie tells Mark that his father dimension hops a lot and Nolan will be home soon.\n\nOmni-Man told the Flaxans that they did not seem to understand that Earth was not theirs to conquer, taking them out and destroying their cities. Days later, Nolan arrived home and he had grown a full beard. He was hugged by Mark and Debbie but they were repulsed by his smell and he told them he needed a shower. Just then, a news report came out, revealing that the Guardians were confirmed dead.\n\nPeople gather at the Guardians of the Globe's funeral, and Omni-Man prepares to give a speech. He mentions he has fought the unimaginable, but always knew he was not alone. He tells the people they had lost many heroes, but mentions that he would still defend them, as well as new heroes. He also reminds them that even in moments of doubt and fear, they should have faith and look to the sky before leaving.\n\nMark Grayson asks if everybody had to go through a funeral again while looking at the graves for a second speech. He is told by Eve that the actual bodies were elsewhere, since people looking for souvenirs later. Nolan tells the people gathered that the people who had died were his friends and mentors. He mentions that at least the fallen heroes would rest together, and Olga was upset that she could not see her late husband. When she threw herself at the ground, Debbie rushed to help her. When Eve asks him if he is all right, Mark mentions that he is unsure how to feel since it could have been his mother burying his father.\n\nOmni-Man spots Damien Darkblood, telling him that the ceremony was private. He complains that he never gets invited, but reminded him that he always showed up anyway, adding that he wanted to discover clues and catch the killer, but Omni-Man told him not to pretend to do it because he cared, knowing he only did not want to go home and told him that he had already told Cecil everything he knew. Darkblood repeats that he knew Omni-Man had seen and heard nothing, having been left for dead. Omni-Man asked if he was insinuating something, but Darkblood said that he simply did not understand how to communicate like humans.\n\nThe Graysons make it back to their house. Nolan asks them if they want pizza, saying he could go to Naples and back before it gets cold, but Debbie asks him to let the delivery man take care of it. As Nolan tried watching television, all he saw was the speech he gave at the funeral while he changed the channels. Debbie asks Mark if he wanted to call William, but Mark gets angry, asking sarcastically if she wanted him to buy comic books. However, his father told him that whatever had happened, he could not bring it home, stopping Mark on the way to his room. Mark asked him if he could go, and Nolan let him go, telling him they would train the following day. Debbie found it weird that he had just come home from his friend's funeral and was talking about pizza, and telling his son not to feel anything, which was odd. However, Nolan told her that they were coworkers and that that was the life they lived. He told her not to worry, and added that he and Mark could do more outside than sulking there. Across the street, Donald runs a team of people who hear everything that is being said inside the household.\n\nLater, when Mark gets home, he runs into Nolan, who tells him to slow down. Mark explained that he had left Amber in his room while he dealt with a crisis. Nolan congratulated him, saying that that was the hard part of the job, but reminded him he should change. Mark walked back into his room, and Amber angrily told him she had been there for an hour, and asking why he had asked her to hang out in the first place, leaving. He asked her why she even came since she had only known of him when he stood up to Todd, but she reminds him that Todd had kicked his ass. She told him that she wanted to know the guy who had taken a punch for her.\n\nAs Debbie cooked dinner, Nolan threw a piece of the monster, asking if she wanted calamari. She tells him to get it off the counter while laughing and asks if he had called Cecil about putting some protection on the house, but he tells her he had been busy, but would do it later. He told her that he was a badass since he had defeated a kaiju, and she told him that she was one as well, since she had sold a house that had a double homicide.\n\nDebbie sits down while working in the kitchen, when she gets cold. Her computer turns off, and she faces Damien, who apologizes. She asks him what he is doing, and he explains that he was looking for clues since the massacre did not make sense to him. He points out that there had been seven dead and only one alive - her husband, so he wanted her to help him since his answers had been unsatisfactory. She asks Darkblood why he cared, and he explains that he had escaped from hell and now sought justice for others, so he could save his soul. He asks if her husband had not told her anything to soothe her fears, but she mentions that he had not, leaving once Nolan turned on the light. After asking her if she was all right, he felt the cold and knew Darkblood had been there, which he did not like.\n\nArising Suspicion[]\n\nOmni-Man points out to Invincible that he is messing up the desert since he was flying too low. When the latter turns around, he finds that he has created a big cloud of sand. Omni-Man tells him to build up speed and endurance by pushing himself, telling Invincible that being a Viltrumite was not easy. Omni-Man did a spin, and Invincible tried to follow, but lost control, so his father proposed going to Mount Everest, with the last one to reach it washing dishes for a week.\n\nOmni-Man reached Mount Everest first, and told his son to take deep breaths since the air was thin. A hiker reached the summit and was surprised to see them both there, but going down soon after. Omni-Man tells Invincible that sometimes he forgets how beautiful the planet can be and told him that Viltrum was very different, having ended wars all over the universe, brought peace to thousands of galaxies and lifted alien races out of the mud. Invincible told him that he could not believe he had left everything behind to go to a planet he had never even seen before, and his father told him that when his grandparents died, he had felt lost for a long time and saw going to Earth as a chance to build something new. He told him that Debbie changed Earth from a job into a home, but Invincible told him that he did not know if he could leave everything behind, and Omni-Man replies saying that being like them took sacrifice. He proceeded to tell his son that the last one home would take out the garbage for a month, but Invincible took off before he could finish and got a head-start. Nevertheless, his father quickly passed him.\n\nDebbie makes it home, grabs a bottle of wine, and starts working. She enters private browsing mode and looks up Damien Darkblood, who is described as a freak who could not even save his own soul, but turns out was a good detective. She hears Nolan and Mark making it back home; once they enter the house, Nolan tells Debbie that after trying to get their son to break the sound barrier, Mark had finally done it by getting ready for a date, which Debbie did not know about, but Mark did not consider it a date and did not even plan it. Nolan asks Debbie if she wants to go out as well, but she tells him that she wants to sell Olga's house, mentioning the conspiracy behind the murders. Nolan tells her that Olga needs to quit drinking, which Debbie did not like and made her suspicious.\n\nDarkblood pours himself a drink and receives Nolan, telling him that he had wondered if he would come. Nolan tells him that he had been in his house and frightened his wife. Darkblood mentions that he had murdered seven people, but Nolan tells him that perhaps it had been him, going to his house in order to finish the job he started, being a demon. Darkblood tells him that demons know evil when they see it, but Nolan ignores and tells him that if he goes back in his house he would not have to do anything, since people would believe him over the demon. Darkblood tells him that he would not give up, since the truth could not be hidden and his wife already suspected, wondering how long until his son did as well.\n\nDebbie works when Nolan approaches her, asking her if she wanted to go to bed, but when she refused, he asks what was going on, but she tells him that nothing. He tells her that being the wife of the most powerful man on Earth meant she should not have to deal with work, but she tells him that she was not just his wife and liked working. He tells her to be quiet, and at first she gets angry, but quiets down when she looks at his face. Nolan swiftly turns and grabs Cecil by the neck, throwing him against a bookshelf, but lets him go. Cecil apologizes and tells him that he meant to teleport to his front door, but had run into a problem. Nolan tells him that he had almost killed him, being jumpy for reasons Cecil would understand.\n\nMark volunteers, saying that the same had happened last time, but Nolan tells him that that was the moon, which hardly counts as space. He added that his responsibilities were bigger than four astronauts. Cecil says that if Mark wanted to go, he would be doing a great favor, so Nolan asked Debbie for support. She says that she does not like Mark missing school, but it would be for a good cause. Mark says that he could go to Mars and back in a second, and Nolan mentions that the fact that he did not know how far Mars was exactly why he should go to school. Cecil tells Mark that it was a two-week mission, and Mark agrees with his father, saying that he was not ready and had things going well with Amber. Debbie tells Mark that many people would tell him how to use his powers, but it would be up to him to make those decisions. After that, Mark agrees to go, so Cecil tells him to pack a lunch since he would be leaving the next day.\n\nNolan and Debbie watched the news, and Mark told her that the mission was a waste of Mark's time, but Debbie mentioned she was proud. Nolan told her that Mark did not understand his responsibilities, but Debbie reminds him that he was 17, also telling him that he had been different ever since their son had gotten his powers. Nolan says that he is trying to teach him, but Debbie points out that he had been distant, annoyed at everything, and mean. She also adds that he had been talking about Viltrum, so Nolan told her that he wanted his son to know about his people, but she told him that she did not know about them, only hearing stories. She told him that he had been hiding something from her, and she did not like it. Nolan tells her that he never thought he would have a family, but met her, who he loved, but when he saw Mark with his powers and after what happened with the Guardians, he did not want to lose everything. He told her that Mark would be gone for two weeks and asks her if she remembers their first trip.\n\nNolan and Debbie walk through Rome until they get to L'Osteria Donato, a fancy restaurant which Nolan had made reservations to, which Debbie mentions is new.\n\nNolan and Debbie reminisce about the past, remembering how Debbie had dumped him after the first date because she considered him to be a dick. Nolan told her that he had taken her to Rome, but she reminded him that he expected her to worship him for it, so he told her that he had been new to Earth and gotten better. Debbie tells him that he had only gotten a second date due to him saving kids, and was happy they were there. However, Nolan sensed that she still felt something was wrong, and she admitted she felt like she was standing on the edge of a cliff. Nolan tells her that he had not been honest with her about the murders, mentioning that Cecil believed he had something to do with the murders since he was not human, was the only survivor and had never been liked by Cecil. Debbie tells him that he needed to talk to him, and Nolan tells her that he had tried, but needed her to trust him. A dragon shows up, but Nolan does not move, simply asking Debbie if she trusted him. She tells him she does and begs him to do something about the dragon, to which he simply responds that he was on vacation, so Cecil should handle it.\n\nNews told the success the astronauts had in Mars. Mark arrives home, hearing noises in his house, but when opening the door, he sees his parents awkwardly staring at him. Debbie asks him how Mars had been, but Mark tells them that less eventful than whatever had been going on in the house while he was gone.\n\nLater, Debbie tells Nolan that if she sells two more houses, she would break the monthly record. Nolan told her that she could do it, and he tells her that new evidence had come up and so Cecil had apologized, which he never did.\n\nInvincible and Omni-Man fought a villain, who they wanted to talk. Omni-Man taught him how to scare villains and dropped him, catching him later.\n\nLater, Mark attempts to stop an asteroid heading for Earth and manages to do so successfully, throwing it back into space. After a huge effort, Omni-Man tells him that the asteroid was small, which shocked his son. Mark gets a text from Amber and is allowed to leave. He calls Mark later to tell him to fight Elephant.\n\nAt dinner, Mark tells his parents that he can help Titan take down Machine Head, but Debbie was not listening. After Mark's explanation, Nolan tells him that he would be making a huge mistake because he was being used and that problem was beneath him. Debbie tells Mark that sometimes people are not who they appear to be and adds that helping someone was never beneath him.\n\nDebbie asks Nolan why he would tell Mark that saving lives was beneath him, to which he responds that Mark did things on a bigger scale and she did not understand that. She reminds him that when he had first arrived at Earth he knew nothing about humans, and she had taught him how to be a superhero for Earth. Nolan tells her that he believed Mark was trusting someone he should not instead of listening to them. They agree they wanted Mark to make good choices.\n\nDebbie calls Nolan, asking him to get food from Rome and wine from Provence. When Nolan leaves, she checks the house and finds the air vent has been moved. She also finds a bag, but hides it as Nolan comes back.\n\nLater, Invincible and Titan fight the super villains, but are overwhelmed as Omni-Man watches from a distance. Invincible is electrocuted while Titan is burned. After a sudden burst of energy, Invincible tells them they would die and swiftly kills two before having his head shoved into the ground by Battle Beast.\n\nInvincible has a hole all the way through him, so doctors work on him as Debbie and Nolan make it to the ER.\n\nMark finally woke and saw his parents. Nolan tells him he knew he would pull through and tells him he was out during six days, which shocks Mark. Eve tells him he covered for him with Amber, telling her he had gotten hit by a bus and mentions Monster Girl and Black Samson were still unconscious.\n\nNolan asks Cecil if Darkblood had cracked yet, but Cecil tells him that Darkblood is stubborn. When asked if Darkblood had murdered the Guardians, Cecil says that they do not know, but he wondered why he would even do it in the first place. Omni-Man tells him that Darkblood is a demon. Cecil asks if Mark had not told him that he would be taking on Machine Head by himself and is surprised to see Mark does not listen to Nolan, which is normal for teenagers from Earth.\n\nNolan asks Debbie if she would be going out, and she tells him that she needed to pick up some dry cleaning and something for dinner. Nolan offers to come along, but she tells him that he needs to work on his book and leaves. When she is gone, Nolan opens up his bag and finds his suit was gone.\n\nLater, since he found out Debbie had been seeing Art, he angrily approaches him from behind, but shows him a few beers he had bought.\n\nNolan and Art share laughs while reminiscing about the past. However, he asks Art why he is a little nervous. Art tells him he is tired, and Nolan says he understands since he knew how things could change from one day to another and hands Art another beer.\n\nNolan makes it home, where Debbie drinks wine. She asks him why he had killed the Guardians, but he denies it. She throws her bottle of wine at him when he tells her she is drunk but he catches and she angrily tells him to fuck himself, before going upstairs. He breaks the bottle of wine and punches a hole through the wall.\n\nExposed[]\n\nDebbie wakes up and goes downstairs, where she sees Nolan. She asks him why he had kept his suit, and he tells her that he used it to take care of Damien Darkblood, but suggests that maybe he wanted her to find it and tells her that he wanted to tell her months ago, since he was not blackmailed. He asks her to trust him, but she says it is impossible since the Guardians were their friends. Nolan says he did not have a choice, so she tells him to get out of her house. He storms out and tells her they would talk later. Debbie calls Mark, but he does not pick up. Soon she is surrounded and Donald tells her to go with him.\n\nOmni-Man practices how to tell Mark he had killed the Guardians saying it was his responsibility, confident Mark would understand. He says he would say something that would change everything.\n\nNolan looks for Mark in his house, but finds nobody except a GDA agent, who he grabs and slams into the ground. He is shot at by many of the agents, who he kills swiftly. He finds the house the GDA had bought in front of them, which infuriates him, but Donald tells him it was for his family's protection. Nolan tells him he had always been pathetic and crushes his spine. Donald tells Cecil that it had been an honor and blows the house up.\n\nWilliam drives home, when he is approached by an angered Omni-Man. William asks if he was okay, but Nolan simply asks where Mark was since William was supposed to drop him off an hour ago. He tells Nolan that Mark had gone with Eve. Nolan puts a dent in William's car, which scares him and asks where Eve is. William tells him where and Nolan flies off.\n\nNolan flies, but is struck down by an enormous beam of light coming from a satellite in space, which manages to bring him down and many animals around him. However, he soon gets up once again, resisting the beam's energy and destroying the satellite. Cecil comments that 400 billion dollars had just been used on a nosebleed. Omni-Man went back to going after Mark and Eve while Cecil told them he would use his teleporter.\n\nNolan is shot at by Cecil. He tries to grab him, but disappears just before Nolan grabs him. Nolan tells him to keep out of it, but Cecil says that he could not do that, asking why he had killed the Guardians. He tells him that he never needed their help since they were weak, but Cecil points out that they had been his friends as he had once and suggests that there had to be a reason. He tells her that Debbie deserved an answer and tells Nolan that he had fooled her and all of them during 20 years. He asks Nolan if Mark knows, which worries him, but Nolan realizes Cecil was just wasting his time.\n\nWhen Cecil leaves, Nolan is attacked by Sinclair's cyborgs, which put up a fight with him as he tries to get them off. He fights the monsters and rips them apart.\n\nCecil, DA Sinclair and Debbie watch Nolan's fight in horror as he starts ripping the bodies apart. Agents also tell Cecil that Eve and Mark were moving towards Nolan's location, which worries Cecil. When Nolan defeats the fallen soldiers, he places the camera inside their guts, which makes people at the GDA retch in disgust and makes Sinclair angry.\n\nNolan faces another monster on his way to Mark, which he tells Cecil he had defeated already. Cecil, however, told him the monster now felt no pain and was now juiced up with every drug, enhancement and upgrade available. Two news helicopters went to Omni-Man's fight.\n\nNolan fights the monster, while Debbie tells Cecil to call Eve's phone since she was with Mark again.\n\nAs Nolan was about to be eaten, Mark punches the creature and sends it flying. Eve gets called by Debbie and asks what was happening. Nolan awoke and Mark happily told him it was about time they teamed up together. When the creature rose, Cecil tells Eve not to help them and get to Guardians HQ.\n\nMark and Nolan had a hard time with the creature. Debbie tells him to call it off, but Cecil says he could not do that since Mark could be allies with his father. After that, Debbie mentions that that was why she had always hated him, which Cecil sympathizes with.\n\nCecil is told that a new object was approaching Omni-Man's location, turning out to be The Immortal, who immediately starts hitting him furiously. Omni-Man catches one of his punches and mentions that he should have stayed dead, sending him back. However, Nolan worries over Mark who is under the beast's control.\n\nMark grabs a cable and electrocutes the beast as Nolan and Immortal keep fighting. Nolan caught one of his punches and stabbed his fist into his stomach, punching all the way through him and shocking the entire world, who was watching thanks to the news helicopters. However, Immortal grabs his thumbs and sticks them into Omni-Man's eyes, so he grabs his hand and splits his body in half as Mark watches. Nolan approaches his son and tells him they need to talk.\n\nThe Immortal falls dead to the ground as Nolan tells Mark they need to talk. Mark, however, understands he had killed the Guardians and begins punching his father, saying that someone was controlling him, but Nolan throws him away and tells him that he was fine, adding that it was time he revealed where he really came from.\n\nHe explains that he is from Viltrum, which was perfect, but had taken them a lot of strength, determination, and courage to get there. In order to reach their full potential, they removed the weak from their society until it was unstoppable. When Nolan was born, Viltrum was already the greatest empire in the galaxy, deciding to make it the only empire in the entire universe. When Nolan was old enough, he joined the war effort until the forces were stretched thin and the expansion stopped, each officer given a planet to weaken by themselves. Nolan went to Earth, and it was now time for Mark and himself to get Earth ready to join the Viltrum empire.\n\nMark cries, but Nolan reassures him that this was for the greater good, not being able to know the truth until he had his powers. He explains that he had to be sure that Mark was a Viltrumite first, so Mark pushes him away and asks if he was not a Viltrumite, if he would just be another human to conquer, which does not make sense to him since he knew Mark loves both him and his mother. Nolan simply asks him if he has any idea how long they lived, since the older they got, the slower they aged. He tells Mark that he would live for thousands of years since Viltrumite DNA was so pure, he was nearly pure Viltrumite. He adds that everybody he loves and knows would be gone before he even looked 30, so he tells Mark that Earth was not his world, but he could help out by ending hunger, stopping wars, and giving them medical technology. When Mark asks, he lets Mark know that he does love his mother, but she was more like a pet to him, which angers Mark, asking Nolan if he really believes he would enslave his friends to aliens he had never met, adding he did not give a shit about Viltrum. He tells Nolan that he would not let him destroy his home, and Nolan tells him that he did not know what he was saying, and would not let him interfere.\n\nNolan understands and punches Mark into the ground and asks him if he really believed he could stop him. Mark punches him, but Nolan catches it and does not move, crushing his hand and throwing him away.\n\nMark tells his father not to hit him anymore, since it was not too late, but Nolan tells him it was, as jets reach their location. Nolan tells Mark to look at all humans needed in order to imitate their power, saying that it was right to pity them, wrong to value them over Viltrumites. He throws Mark away and is shot at by the jets, which do not move him. He destroys a jet, so Mark flies in order to help the pilot out and save him. The pilot thanks Mark, but Nolan asks why he had done so and kills him immediately, going for the next one, but Mark stops him.\n\nNolan asks him if it really made a difference that he had killed him since he would have only lived another 50 years, but Mark tells him he could have had a life. Nolan asks if that had hurt him and punches him away all the way over to a big city, where he caused a lot of destruction with the fall. As a building falls, Mark pushes it, so it does not, but he cannot stand the weight, and it crushes everybody inside. He starts crying and asks Nolan how he could have done such a thing, and he tells him that his stubbornness to stop the inevitable had killed them. He asks Mark how many people needed to die and tells him that he knew he was right. Mark asks him if his mother's life was meaningless and Nolan that in the grand scheme of things, it was, which makes Debbie cry. Mark asks him how he could say such a thing and punches Nolan, who is angered because for the first time in his life, he was telling Mark the truth.\n\nHe punches Mark underground to a train station and holds him in front of one of the moving trains. The train hits Mark, who does not move along with his father and is hit by the blood, bones and guts of the passengers inside. Nolan tells Mark that humans were meaningless and cavemen without them, but Mark tells him that he had seen him save people before, nearly dying in the process, suggesting that perhaps Nolan had been a Viltrumite when he had come to Earth, but had changed. However, Nolan tells Mark that even if he had been happy for a time, he was loyal to Viltrum. Mark punches his father once again, who dodges it and is angered, slamming his son into the ground and then bringing him to space. He tells Mark that his time on Earth had been a speck in the span of his life, and he did not know who he really was. He tells Mark he would burn the planet down before he spent another minute living among animals. Mark punches him in the face, but he does not even move, returning the punch and sending Mark flying repeatedly.\n\nNolan takes Mark deep underwater, where he stops moving and then throws him into a mountain. He punches Mark once more with a punch so strong, it cracks the mountain, which causes an avalanche which covers Mark and a town down below. He picks Mark up and asks him if he had had enough, but Mark once again tells him he would stop him, so Nolan tells him he was ready for that to happen whenever Mark was. Nolan tells him that his intentions were wasted since making Earth a part of the Empire would make Earth better than it ever was. Mark asks what would happen if they resisted and is told that they were there to keep them from resisting. Nolan asks if he really wanted to die for the planet and accepts that he could always start again with another kid. He punches Mark repeatedly until he loses consciousness.\n\nNolan could not punch Mark anymore and lays down next to him as his son gasps weakly. He asks Mark why he had made him do what he had done, since he was only fighting so he would watch everybody around him die. He asks Mark what he would have after 500 years, and Mark tells him he would still have him. Silenced by the admission, Nolan looks at his hands, thinking about what he's done and wondering if it really was the right thing to do. When Mark says \"Dad?\", he realizes he still loves Mark as well as Earth and flies away, crying as he breaks through the atmosphere and makes his way out of the solar system.\n\nFugitive and Exile[]\n\nAfter leaving Earth, Nolan voyaged towards countless stars and planets. For months, he continues to drift aimlessly, until he found a black hole. He stared at the dark mass sucking in matter before him, his eyes empty and lost. He began to allow the black hole’s gravity to draw him in, ready to end his own life. However, this suicide attempt was stopped when he saw a spacecraft, full of passengers, caught into the black hole’s gravity and plunging towards the event horizon. Omni Man decides to save them, where he saved and took the passengers back to their world, quickly he was given amnesty and became their emperor, he also became close with one of the passengers, and the two became married and eventually another child was born. For a number of months, he lived on Thraxa with a new outfit and a new persona called The Monarch, portrayed as a messiah-like king to the Thraxans.\n\nFather-Son Reunion[]\n\nNuozolot, a resident of Thraxa was sent by their monarch to Earth on the purpose of locating Invincible. Nuozolot informs the heroes of meteor showers that could destroy his planet, Invincible arrives to Thraxa with Nuozolot and met the planet's monarch which turned out to be his father, Omni-Man himself. Seeing his son, Nolan greeted him while the latter was shocked by the reunion. Invincible was frozen for moments, but then made a fist, and so did Nolan, but instead a hug was formed. Shocking Nolan, the two would trade barbs, with Mark leaving thraxa, but Nolan chased after him, and was given a few minutes to explain his purpose, showing him his new wife, Andressa, and their child his younger half brother.\n\nOnce more the two argued, Nolan admits he is now a fugitive of Viltrum because he left earth and now they believe they know of his current whereabouts and they could kill his younger brother. He also admits he cannot return to earth, Nolan tells Mark he must help him defend thraxa from Viltrumite threats. Quickly the two fought against Lucan, Vidor, and Thula, two of which Nolan defeated, and killed. Nolan defeats Thula from killing Mark, but was caught off guard by the surviving Lucan, who broke Nolan's back and apprehending him. Much later, Viltrumite grunts are seen transporting Nolan. In quite possibly his last moments with seeing or speaking to his son Mark again, he urges him not to forget the deeds, and acts he made, and his books, he demands for Mark to read his books. Later, Kregg mentions to Mark, that Nolan is being transported to an undisclosed location and is to be prepped for execution for his betrayal.\n\nSins of the Traitor[]\n\nMonths later, Nolan (now fully healed and has been removed of his monarch outfit) is seen within a space viltrumite prison complex, sitting in his chair and is greeted by Kregg and two other alien guards. Kregg tells him, he can still return to the viltrum army, but Nolan says nothing. Kregg then grabs Nolan by throat asking why or how 20 years on Earth changed him, Nolan still says nothing. Kregg leaves, claiming the care for earth and the people is very toxic and unstable for a high ranking viltrumite like him. Nolan then slams his fist on the floor in anger.\n\nOn Earth, Mark discovered his books, learning the books may be a source to weakening and destroying the viltrum empire once and for all.\n\nMuch later, Nolan fought the guards and meets with Kregg, who is then overwhelmed by Viltrumite Guards, two guards attempt to escort him with one expressing shame to hurt him again as he was his hero growing up. Nolan merely wanted to get up, and accepted his grim fate. Then he meets with Allen, and talk in different cells about his execution and meeting with Mark. Allen tries to offer Nolan hope, but instead wants to die, because of all he's done, to Chicago, Mark and his wife, whom he admits, he actually misses...\n\nAppearance[]\n\nOmni-Man is a tall man of fair complexion with blue eyes and trimmed black hair. He also sports a well-groomed mustache. In spite of being thousands of years old, Omni-Man's physical appear to be middled aged, having the hair on his temples and the back of his head turned grey and slight wrinkles about his face.Even more, while looking like a man beyond his prime, he possesses a commanding presence of a well-built and powerful physique, notable for its broad body structure. He is dressed in a complete bodysuit, in which the upper section is adorned in white while the lower section showcases a vibrant red color. It is worth mentioning that he adorns white boots, which are embellished with a solitary red highlight positioned at their center. In contrast, his gloves exhibit an inverse color scheme. To finalize his attire, he adorns himself with a scarlet cape. The attire showcases a prominent elongated crimson highlight embellishing its core, where a scarlet \"O\", symbolizing the titular individual, is prominently displayed. It actually symbolizes his people, as the Viltrumite insignia has a similar design, except with the three linear shapes.\n\nAfter becoming ruler of Thraxa, he modified his outfit almost resembling his original superhero costume, albeit without gloves, an O symbol, and red leggings.\n\nIn the Viltrumite prison asteroid, he wears a prison suit consisted of grey and white colors.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nAs Omni-Man, Nolan initially shows the persona of an ideal superhero: brave, compassionate, charming, loyal, and willing to sacrifice himself for others. To the average viewer, his status as a hero was certain and undoubted. In his human persona, he appeared to be a loving husband and was a good father, even though his high expectations for his son were demanding, these expectations usually kept in check by Debbie. The most his Viltrumite heritage showed would be from his ideology towards the responsibility of being a hero, which Mark claims is more along the lives of saving millions and billions rather than hundreds or thousands, eventually heightening tensions with Debbie and Mark.\n\nHowever, his true nature follows the general nature of most Viltrumites. He is a ruthless and loyal to the Viltrum Empire, committing countless amoral horrific acts for the Viltrum Empire to conquer planets. Due to his race's near-immortality, immense power, and extremely advanced technology, he sees many other races as being weak and inferior. Arrogantly believing it is his duty to bring order to other societies for the greater good, he will conquer them, and, if they resist, they are subjugated violently. Despite the shameless and indifferent way operates for the Viltrum Empire it's not done out of hatred or sadism, he truly believes that is doing the right thing, viewing dominance as the same as peace and prosperity. His ruthlessness is seen with his genocide and near-destruction against the Flaxans and their planet after they tried to conquer Earth first. He also shows no remorse for the killings of thousands he has done and finds them pitiful instead. Nolan even declared that while he loved his wife, he considered her as a pet and even stated he could kill Mark to have another son that he could raise to be loyal to the Viltrum Empire's Expansion plan.\n\nDespite his god-complex and callous ways, his time on Earth gradually began to change him. During the times he presents himself as a cold and pragmatic warrior, he often betrays uneasiness with his actions. He was willing to kill the original Guardians of the Globe in order to weaken Earth's defenses against the Viltrumites, but soon after seemed distraught about his actions. Likewise, while originally finding Earth actives like sports as pointless, he came truly love his family, enjoying time with them and showed genuine happiness to see them succeed. During his fight with Mark, he constantly berates him for caring about Earth and living like a human, however his arguments and increasingly unhinged tone imply Nolan is trying to convince himself of his own actions. At the end, when he angrily asks his son what Mark will have in 500 years, his son weeps and tells him he would still have his father. This confession of love from his son, despite all he did to Mark was enough to break Nolan out of his cold Viltrumite persona and cause him to breakdown in anguish. Horrified at what he had done to his son, Nolan chooses to abandon his mission and leave Earth rather than kill his own son with tears streaming down his face as he departs for space.\n\nIn the end, Nolan's 20 years on Earth was enough to change the thousands of years of Viltrumite dogma he had lived through. Nolan's decision to murder his friends, slaughter innocent people, and attack his son seemed based on nothing more than habit and conditioning as a Viltrumite soldier and when confronted with the realization of his own actions, Nolan feels immense guilt and remorse, even when space voyaging, and nearly depression when he encountered a black hole, preparing to end his life, but was given a second chance when saving a small race of passengers and being given role \"Monarch\" to the planet's residents. When he reunited with his son after months, he showed no ill will and merely smiles at him.\n\nDespite having changed for the better upon meeting the Thraxans, Nolan was still unable to comprehend why he cared about them when they were massacred by Viltrumite invaders. Although he felt furious at the slaughter, he believed that the Thraxan species were weak and short lived compared to himself, with his Viltrumite conditioning leading him to believe that they shouldn't matter to him, and yet they did. When Mark points out that this is how he was supposed to feel on Earth, Nolan is left in a stunned silence, and for the first time in his life, he is unable to justify the Viltrumite mindset of seeing weaker species as inferior and worthless.\n\nPowers and Abilities[]\n\nPowers[]\n\nViltrumite Physiology: As a Viltrumite, Omni-Man is an advanced being with extremely potent and well-developed genetics.

Likewise, against other Viltrumites, he was decisively able to defeat them one after the other.\n\nMaster Manipulator: Omni-Man is a very charismatic speaker who is capable of giving rousing speeches to the public while hiding his true intentions and deceitful actions.
