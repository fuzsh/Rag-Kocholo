        "text": "A medical melodrama whose first act is confined to the poverty of a mining village, its second to the comfort of London's upper classes. Director King Vidor accomplishes much during the first half, ably assisted by the professional weeping of Robert Donat and Rosalind Russell. But the second half is a bit flabby, bogged down by too much genteel domestic drama and high-flown speechifying, neither of which makes for particularly engaging cinema.\n\n\"I'm Commander Shepard, and This Is My Favorite Movie called The Citadel.\"\n\nEarly medical dramas seemed to follow a very similar pattern - a plucky physician armed with nothing more than a microscope and some determination that works to make a major discovery in the face of ridicule; The Citadel, Arrowsmith, and The (fictionalized) Story of Louis Pasteur all build off the same ideas, celebrating an era of individual research that has long since passed. However, since this iteration is from King Vidor, there are going to be personal transformations alongside darker and suprisingly prescient elements. For instance, Robert Donat's Dr. Andrew Manson is researching the connections between tuberculosis and mine dust when he finds himself facing unusual opposition -…\n\nAndrew realizes it would be better for his career if he got married so he just marries the hottest girl in town without knowing her name within the day. The Citadel is focused on the power of medicine when they should be focused on the power of that guy’s rizz.\n\nIt's as easy as that: I cry along with Robert Donat when he sobs on the screen. He goes through saving a newborn baby as a genuine, agonizing experience, and he was overcome with emotion. He puts a piece of his own personal pain into all his onscreen emotions; is it possible to look into his eyes and not cry with him? However, it's not as obvious in his earlier works like \"The Citadel,\" so you can watch them by concentrating on the plot and the character development. Rosalind Russell, who plays the main character's partner and beloved, is a beautiful, intelligent, strong-willed, and devoted young woman. She serves as Dr. Manson's conscience and maintains his delicate mental equilibrium. She also won't allow him to fail in the end. In general, the film's ending is left open, but I'd like to think that Dr. Manson will pick up his old experiments again and use them for good.\n\nA quality British medical drama with Robert Donat as the passionate fresh doctor rising in his chosen profession, only to get distracted by becoming a rich-client medical adviser catering to wealthy peoples need for attention. Moralistic and glamorizing without going overboard either way.\n\nThe first half of the film is by far the best. That's when Donat works out in the districts under poor working conditions, encountering social problems and challenges about getting his theories accepted by old fashioned mentalities. Then he turns city doctor and it becomes wooden and it loses it's emotional edge even if they try and salvage that at the end. Would have been better had they stuck to what they were doing early on in the movie. So thank God that bit was of high quality and Robert Donat being a ace actor!\n\nA moving, sensitive film that I found heavy-handed at the end. Excellent until Donat's walk through London. We understand what his character is going through, we don't need shots of the destitute. Felt like the film was holding the audience's hand. The remainder is a bit of a screed, too, although Donat's speech at the end is good and his delivery impeccable.\n\nBut, otherwise, a moving, intelligent, well-acted film about the life of a physician and the state of care available to the rich and not the poor.\n\nThe film is worth watching for the scenes between Donat and Ralph Richardson alone.\n\nWatched for King Vidor's birthday!\n\nMedicine was not exactly in the dark ages during the 1930s, at least in the developed world, so I'm not entirely sure why so many movies in that decade gloried in the advances made by medicine in a skeptical world, from \"Arrowsmith\" (1931) to \"The Story of Louis Pasteur\" (1936) to this film.\n\nThe arc of the story here is achingly familiar -- young, green doctor starts out, learns fast, struggles as he fights the good fight, finally achieves wealth and comfort, only to be shocked by a tragic event into realizing anew that the values he held early in his career are what really matter. But even knowing exactly where this movie was going didn't prevent me from enjoying…\n\nPowerful emotional driven beginning and ending marred by a 30 minute interlude of superficiality\n\nThe letterboxd poster suggests this may be a film about a soldier (with Robert Donat seemingly wearing a uniform), but Donat in this is a simple doctor and the heart of this film takes place in 2 nearby poor communities (one being a mining town).\n\nThe relationship with Rosalind Russell isn't given enough screen time and they are married too fast for the story. It's like 2 scenes were cut from the beginning of this film when any cuts ought to have come between the 70-100 minute mark. During that part of the story Donat is shown to be wandering, so to speak, but we don't…\n\nThere are some aspects to The Citadel that haven't aged terribly well. The gender politics are exceptionally dated, which is jarring considering the woman with the biggest role is the famously outspoken Rosalind Russell. It's exactly the kind of well-meaning drama that sort of loses itself in its own importance--nowadays we call that Oscarbait.\n\nWhat exactly is the charm in this film then? It's fairly stodgy, very academic, and wears it's datedness proudly. Underneath those things, however, King Vidor directs with a surprisingly delicate touch. What should be the dullest film ever nominated by the Academy is instead made into a well-humored and good-natured one that lilts along with surprising grace. Unquestionably, however, the film's greatest asset is Robert Donat.…\n\n-You wouldn't marry me, would ya?\n\n-(she laughs)\n\n-What's the joke?\n\n-You are.\n\nHard not to see this through after a man Roz barely knows, asks her to marry him—and not only is she not insulted, she agrees before he even knows her name, and preposterous as it sounds, it somehow plays in a very plausible manner. It's a little long and predictable, but no less entertaining."
