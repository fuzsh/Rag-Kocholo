        "text": "It’s a dangerous business, Frodo.\n\nCate Blanchett claimed that the actors in Peter Jackson’s “The Lord of the Rings” film trilogy made a poor salary, despite the franchise having grossed nearly $3 billion.\n\nThe 55-year-old actress made the confession on Wednesday’s episode of “Watch What Happens Live,” when host Andy Cohen asked her for which film she received her biggest paycheck.\n\n“I think it’s probably ‘Lord of the Rings,’” Cohen, 56, surmised.\n\n“Are you kidding me?” Blanchett responded. “No, no one got paid anything to do that movie.”\n\nWhen Cohen asked Blanchett if she “got a piece of the back end,” the “Borderlands” star replied, “No! That was way before any of that. No, nothing.”\n\n“I wanted to work with the guy who made ‘Braindead,’” Blanchett added, referring to Jackson, 62, and his 1992 zombie comedy that came out nine years before the first “The Lord of the Rings” film.\n\n“I mean, I basically got free sandwiches,” Blanchett said. “I got to keep my ears — which is something. They fed me.”\n\nWhen Cohen asked again about Blanchett’s biggest career paycheck, she said, “Women don’t get paid as much as you think they do.”\n\nBlanchett played elf leader Galadriel in all three “The Lord of the Rings” films, which came out in 2001, 2002 and 2003.\n\nShe reprised the role in “The Hobbit” movies, prequels to “The Lord of the Rings.”\n\nThe actress was in 2012’s “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,” 2013’s “The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug” and 2014’s “The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies.”\n\nBlanchett isn’t the first actor to speak out about the amount of money they made starring in the fantasy adventure film series.\n\nOrlando Bloom, who played Legolas, said on “The Howard Stern Show” last year that he made $175,000 for the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy.\n\n“I got nothing,” the 47-year-old actor said.\n\nBloom added, “Listen, greatest gift of my life, are you kidding me? You’d do it again for half the money.”\n\nBlanchett and Bloom starred alongside Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Sean Bean, Liv Tyler, Andy Serkis, Billy Boyd and more in the film franchise.\n\nThe three “Lord of the Rings” films made over $2.9 billion at the worldwide box office.\n\nIncluding the earnings from “The Hobbit” trilogy, the “Middle-Earth” franchise in total has grossed over $5.9 billion worldwide."
