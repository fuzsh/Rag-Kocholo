Lamb opens the essay humorously describing a poor relation as the most irrelevant thing that is unpleasant and embarrassing. He illustrates the story of a typical poor male relation who arrives unannounced and makes the host feel awkward through overly familiar or shy behavior. Lamb then claims a poor female relation is even worse, as she is dressed poorly but acts too modest, making others view her as worthless. The essay shifts tone as Lamb recounts his friend who ran away from university and joined the army to escape his father's poverty, only to be killed in war. He concludes on a more dignified note describing his father's poor friend, who maintained self-respect through saving enough money not to be indebted after death.",
