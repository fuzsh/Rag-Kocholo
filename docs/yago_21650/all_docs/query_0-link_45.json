        "text": "Diplomatic relations between Hollywood and Soviet Russia have been in bad shape for many years, but now that Metro and the Capitol Theatre have celebrated Christmas by presenting \"Comrade X,\" non-belligerency is at an end. You may look for a clash of arms any day now. For seldom has a film—with the exception of Charlie Chaplin's \"The Great Dictator\"—satirized a nation and its political system with such grim and malicious delight as does this Yuletide comedy, in which Clark Gable and Hedy Lamarr are the chief conspirators.Obviously, the boys at Metro were laboring under the influence of their own \"Ninotchka\" when they made it, for the ideas are strikingly similar. This time it is an American journalist, a key-hole reporter out of Moscow, who meets, under desperate circumstances, a female Communist street-car conductor and persuades her, with circumstantial arguments, to see the error in her ideology. Russia, he is able to prove, is a rotten place to live in, and together they escape from the country with a whole tank corps after them. Romance, meanwhile, has bloomed, that being essential to a capitalist conversion.Unlike \"Ninotchka,\" however, \"Comrade X\" lacks an even comic pace, and as a consequence it has its ups and downs. Obviously Ben (\"Front Page\") Hecht had a hand in the contrivance of it, for there is a strange admixture of Chicago journalistic farce and Peglerian political satire detectable in the brew. Some of the wit is lively, such as that during a scene wherein the newspaper man is facetiously explaining the instability of the social system in America. \"Ever hear of the Brooklyn Dodgers?\" he inquires. \"They get murdered every day.\" And the street-car lady solemnly replies, \"There must be a revolution soon.\" Some of it is sharply penetrating—when, for instance, a Russian explains that the song a group of prisoners are singing is \"the same thing they always sing when in prison; 'We Are Free!'\" And some of it is rather too grim for enjoyment, since it has to do in a jesting vein with assassination and political execution. Even in Russia that isn't funny.Despite the fact that Miss Lamarr, as the backsliding street-car conductor, plays a good part of the picture in a lovely nightdress (with a soiled trenchcoat over it), the romantic angle is barely brushed in. Most of the exchanges between her and Mr. Gable, as the newspaper man, are of the hard-boiled, sock-and-bust-'em variety, in which her fragile, un-Stakhanoffian beauty seems incongruously abused. But Mr. Gable, tough and cynical, as usual, doesn't mind, apparently, so neither do we. Several supporting roles are excellently performed—notably by Felix Bressart as a resigned slave to the Communist system; Oscar Homolka as a commissar; Sig Rumann as a Nazi journalist, and Vladimir Sokoloff is a philosophical hypocrite. And King Vidor's direction is competent, but not—as we have come to expect—inspired.The best thing in the picture is the tank chase at the end. That is a smart elaboration on an old slap-stick devicè, and it makes for exciting fun. It also makes up for a lot of tedious business earlier.\n\nCOMRADE X; screen play by Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer; based on a story by Walter Reisch; directed by King Vidor; produced by Gottfried Reinhardt, for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

Mikhail RasumnyIn these blasé years the circus big tops are growing fewer and fewer, but there was a time—say, a century ago—when a single performing elephant would cause the smalltown rustics to stare in popeyed awe and the shrilling of a calliope would set the whole population running for Main Street to watch the parade go by. A season or two back, Walter D. Edmonds wrote the picaresque account of \"Chad Hanna,\" the stripling who ran away with a three-wagon circus and toured the up-State Finger Lakes region in those years when the Erie was still the \"big canal.\" And yesterday to the Roxy came the cinematic version, as full of hokum as a press agent's spiel, but bright as a circus poster and flavorsome as a Winter apple.Mr. Edmonds' story of Chad and his blighted romance with the Huguenine Circus' high rider, who returned to trouble him after he had found solace with her successor, was no great shakes to begin with. In adapting it to the screen Henry King would have done well to set the wheels rolling at a faster clip and Nunnally Johnson, the scenarist, might have spared us such unabashed sequences as that rainy night at the inn during which Dorothy Lamour, enticingly attired in an old comforter, informs Henry Fonda, as Chad, that he's really in love with his wife. She knew, she explains, by the way he embraced her a moment previously.But Mr. Edmonds partly compensated for such nonsensical shoddy by saturating his narrative in the detail and mood of a more bucolic past and Twentieth Century-Fox has gone him one better by setting it in brilliant Technicolor. The color and mood of that small town America has been excellently captured in the crickets dinning the night silence at Canastota; the creak of wagon harness as the little caravan journeys to the next town; the blare and flash of the brass trombones atop the red-white-and-gilt rococo wagons as the circus turns into the Main Street; the roustabouts of rival circuses fighting it out with tent pegs on the bridge; the acrobats in pink tights and gold fringe running into the sawdust ring while Guy Kibbee delivers a stentorian rhetoric on the \"most daring, the most breath-taking . . .\"Of all the Hollywood leads, Henry Fonda was the most natural selection for the gauche, simple-minded and resourceful fellow that Chad was and he carries the role perfectly. Linda Darnell, as the second equestrienne and the first Mrs. Hanna, is brightly attractive and comes off rather better than Miss Lamour even when she is called up-on to dangle grotesquely in mid-air while learning to ride a horse. John Carradine is excellent as the lanky, tartly spoken advance agent, and Jane Darwell and Guy Kibbee as the fat lady and the ringmaster are hale and hearty. It's all the rankest hokum, as we were intimating, but it photographs beautifully, Gangway, folks, the circus is in town.\n\nAt the RoxyCHAD HANNA; screen play by Nunnally Johnson; based on the story \"Red Wheels Rolling\" by Walter D.

Almira SessionsRoutine is the word for \"San Francisco Docks,\" which opened yesterday at the Rialto and wherein an amiable cast headed by Burgess Meredith, Irene Hervey and Barry Fitzgerald get all mixed up in a lot of melodramatic foolishness within and without a waterfront tavern presided over by Raymond Walburn, Mr. Meredith, a starry-eyed longshoreman, becomes involved early in the proceedings in a web of circumstantial evidence which nearly puts a noose around his neck, and Miss Hervey goes racing about helter skelter digging up evidence to prove his innocence.That's the story in a nutshell and a very old and listless affair it is, too, notwithstanding an introductory scene of a prison break at Alcatraz, and the ultimate corraling of the fugitive murderer, who put poor Mr. Meredith on the spot, by a two-fisted parish priest (Robert Armstrong). The film tries desperately to be very tough and exciting, shrouding its more sinister actions in murky photography, but somehow it never quite succeeds in being either.\n\nAt the RialtoSAN FRANCISCO DOCKS, original screen play by Stanley Rubin and Edmund L.

Edward PawleyTo the marbles-and-jacks set another Gene Autry picture is an event as welcome as the Christmas holidays. For that reason, then, \"Melody Ranch,\" which arrived at the Bryant yesterday, is another gaudy bauble to pluck from a laden tree. But Republic apparently intended the film for a wider audience, weighting this super-Western with romance, radio programs and comedy and the varied talents of such eminent non-Westerners as Jimmy Durante, Ann Miller, Jerome Cowan and Barton MacLane. The result, however, falls short of expectations—for many reasons, the chief of which is the story, which even Autry fans might consider a bit on the thin side.This time, for instance, Mr. Autry, as a radio singing star, returns to his racket-ridden home town as an honorary sheriff, dispatches the three responsible scalawags and, justice done, he finally wins the girl. To compensate, the producers have wisely added the services of Mr. Durante, \"whose flair for gnarled phraseology occasionally lifts this horse opera out of its doldrums. But it is an old vehicle and the going is tough."
