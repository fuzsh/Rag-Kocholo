        "text": "December 2, 2021\n\nLots of fun! I thoroughly enjoyed this breezy read. It's not great literature, but it's well-written and humorous. I do think the characterization is a bit of a weak point-- perhaps because it's such an ensemble cast, and a relatively slim book, I never felt like I really got into the mind and heart of any of the characters fully enough, though I enjoyed them all (even loved-to-hate Clarissa's brother and sister-in-law). The fun here lies in all the tangled webs and schemes and how they play out. I also really appreciated that this is a regency with characters who actually feel of-the-time, rather than so many of those regencies penned today that have impossibly modern heroines acting in ways utterly impossible for the time. The \"bluestocking\" education Clarissa received and the school for girls that her mother ran was a bit unlikely, and some of it is a bit farfetched. But I appreciate that Clarissa and the \"poor relations\" were fully aware of the hand fate had dealt them and had to work within the confines of society, as women, to achieve their goals--and, yes, even if this means relying somewhat on men to make it happen. To me, this is much more realistic, and takes nothing away from the intelligence of these women to realize and accept that they could not be 100% independent of men in that time, in that society. Their cleverness lies in how they manage and manipulate their situation -- as females -- and I find this a more satisfying regency read than those by authors who give their heroines 21st century American sensibilities but dress them in a ball gown and plop them in a manor house and call it a “regency” romance. One could still argue that the ending here is implausibly happy, but I can use a little implausible happiness in my life right now, so I'll take the smiles this book delivered and not complain about the details.\n\nAugust 1, 2020\n\nClarissa and the Poor Relations by Alicia Cameron is a sweet little novella, though it lost a little steam towards the end.\n\nThis is the first book by this author I’ve read. The novella is a romantic comedy/satire about a young woman who comes into an inheritance and invites her ragtag group of friends and colleagues (the poor relations) from the school they were all teaching at to come and live with her and try to make a go of reviving the dying estate she inherited. The only problem is that the young woman, Clarissa, is not of age and is at the mercy other older step-brother.\n\nThe story is sweet and humorous at times, the characters are charming and quirky. I thought the plot to keep Clarissa at her manor was both too complicate and simplistic. While I enjoyed most of the book, towards the end it got silly which is why I gave it three stars. The author was trying to channel Georgette Hayer and Barbara Metzger but didn't quite have the skill to pull it off. But there's promise there.\n\nOverall, it was a sweet romantic novella and while it got a little silly I didn't mind spending my time reading it and would read another book by this other.\n\nAudiobook Notes:\n\nThe audiobook was narrated by Heath Miller who did did a very nice job. I think I've listened to one other book narrated by her and she's been good. She's not on my list of top narrators but she does a good job.\n\nJanuary 25, 2019\n\n3.5 stars\n\nClarissa Thorne is in despair. She has been forced to close her mother's progressive Thorne's Academy for Young Ladies after her mother's death a year ago. Now upon the death of her cousin, she has inherited a grand estate, making her the target of fortune hunters, including her older half-brother who would like nothing more than to sell the estate and pocket the money. Fortunately for Clarissa she has the support of her good friends Oriona, a former teacher and friend; Miss Micklethwaite, Clarissa's former governess and Miss Appleby, a kindly teacher; and Sullivan the family butler who looks out for Clarissa as if she were his daughter. The friends form a scheme to move to Ashcroft and endear themselves to the neighborhood. Clarissa's brother and his awful wife are social climbers who envy Clarissa's position as granddaughter of a Viscount. If she has the backing of the neighbors, it will be harder to drag Clarissa away and sell the estate. Clarissa finds herself faced with an estate in need of major work and major funds, which she lacks. Luckily, she has the benefit of education and Mr. Elfoy, the estate manager. Then the young ladies meet Lord Grandiston, an old friend of Oriona's and his friend Mr. Booth. The gentlemen help scheme to keep the ladies around long enough to bring about the happily ever after ending they all desire.\n\nThis is a halfway decent \"sweet\" Regency romance. I gave it an extra half star for the progressive education Clarissa's mother gave her daughter and other young ladies. That is implausible because schools like that did not exist until the end of the century but other writers have done it and in this case, it works because the school closes upon Mrs. Thorne's death. The plot is predictable and I wish it was not a traditional Regency ROMANCE. I'd rather read about Mr. and Mrs. Thorne and Mrs. Thorne's academy without the silly teenage romantic drama. That's just me, however, speaking as a bluestocking spinster who would never survive a minute in the real 19th-century! My other complaint is that the author hammers home the sexism of the period too much in the narration. It's obvious in the story without the pointed references. Let the story speak for itself. I also found a few grammatical errors/typos.\n\nThere are way too many characters in this novel and at first I had trouble keeping track of them. Clarissa is not my favorite character. For all her progressive education and loving parents, she's a bit silly. I admire her compassion and kindness towards those less fortunate but her plotline is quite silly and unrealistic. Still, I was rooting for her against her awful brother John. John Thorne is not as weak as the Dashwood sisters' brother but it's obvious his wife rules the roost. Even though John is supposed to be the villain, I did have sympathy for him because he behaves only as a gentleman of his time and place ought. Clarissa SHOULD go stay with him and be an unpaid servant to his undoubtedly horrid children according to the rules of the day. Times were changing and heading out of the Georgian period into the Victorian, women became more sheltered and Clarissa's Mama would have had more freedom to be educated and eccentric than her daughter and future granddaughters. John's wife Cornelia is awful. She's insanely jealous of Clarissa being in a higher social position and longs to be a part of the ton and not just on the margins. This drives her to be spiteful and mean to Clarissa. Cornelia comes across as a massive witch with a B!\n\nThe secondary characters shine more than Clarissa. Sweet Miss Appleby, a spinster of certain years, still longs for romance. She has taught Clarissa kindness and compassion as well as practical things she needs to do. Miss Appleby makes me think of a grandmother and I want to hug her. She does annoy me in parts though, especially at the end. I prefer the intrepid Miss Augusta Mistlethwaite. She's the hero of the story. Miss M knows how to manage everyone to make them do what she wants. What she wants is what will make Clarissa happy. Miss M is tough, intelligent and strong. I also loved Oriona Petersham, Clarissa's best friend. I would want to be her if I lived then. Raised by her father basically as his heir, despite having a brother, Oriona knows the practical realities of estate management. She is smart, confident and proud. I can really relate to her for most of the book. However, I really disliked how she acted around her love interest at the end. She turns into a watering pot which is very unlike her. Juliana Sowersby rounds out the feminine cast. She's a sweet, shy friend of Clarissa's from the elder Thorne's village of Sowersby. Juliana lends moral support to Clarissa and vice versa. Her introduction to the plot was largely unnecessary.\n\nThe gentlemen are more your standard Regency novel characters. Sullivan the butler provides some comic relief as well as support to Clarissa. I love his devotion to her and how he seeks to protect her from her scheming brother, fortune hunters and lovelorn gentlemen. Lord Grandiston is an alpha herp but not too overbearing. He has a sense of humor and a romantic streak. I do feel he unnecessarily complicated Clarissa's life though, making schemes that created love triangles and drama. He feels it is necessary to thwart John Thorne and get to know his love interest better. Mr. Booth is a Heyeresque sidekick. He's not as sharp as Grandiston but he makes up for it in empathy and kindness. Mr. Elfoy is great at his job but as a romantic hero he annoys me. A little communication goes a long way. I get why he responded as he did but sometimes he let his feelings overrule good sense and almost ruined everything.\n\nThis story is a cut above most of the clean Regency romances I've read recently. It's similar to the old Signet and Zebra Regencies. If you like those, you'll probably enjoy this story. If you love Regency fashion, the numerous descriptions of clothing seem to be copied right out of the fashion magazines. Do not read this if you are a high stickler expecting exact historical accuracy.\n\nOctober 6, 2021\n\nThe heroine Clarissa and her 3 closest friends: Augusta\n\n(\"Waity\"), Louisa, and stunningly beautiful Oriana,\n\nstarted on a new venture together. There was genuine\n\nstrength and love with these friends. Waity was the\n\nmother figure. Clarissa was only 18 and wise beyond\n\nher years. Her oppressive half- brother had plans for\n\nher.\n\nThese ladies met various men while Clarissa worked\n\non her dream project. Soon affection developed\n\norganically. And couples found love & kisses only.\n\nThe sweetest for me was older couple Louisa and\n\nher beaux. Oriana led several men on a merry chase.\n\nSome people met up at Clarissa's new home, half-\n\nbrother John ( and his rude scheming wife) & shy\n\nfriend Juliana. Waity was the governess in John's\n\nyouth and she had means of holding his behavior\n\nin check. There was some humor.\n\nThe story pacing was good & readers were kept\n\nguessing for a time who would pair up with\n\nwhom? I re-read several passages and pages.\n\nThis was a pleasant way to spend an afternoon\n\nor evening.\n\nNovember 5, 2018\n\nThis was an absolutely delightful traditional regency. It had quite a large cast of characters and several HEA's. The author juggled all the numerous characters with great skill, and they had distinct characteristics and personalities. The story was really charming. Apparently the author (whose name is a pseudonym) is a writer of crime fiction who has now tried her hand at regency romance because of her love for Jane Austin and Georgette Heyer. This is her first regency romance, and I hope she writes many others to follow.\n\nAugust 18, 2020\n\nThe h is very young, at risk from her step-brother and his awful wife,. She's inherited a dilapidated estate at just the right time. She has a group of friends who also need a safe place to live. They decide to inspect her new estate together and the fun begins. Their stories are all different with a common theme of being denied any independence as they are women. Luckily there are some wonderful Heroes who offer their kindness and support. I really liked how the mean relatives get told, also the sweet love stories. it's great.\n\nMay 20, 2018\n\npleasant enough but ending was a bit of a let down - 2.75*\n\nI enjoyed this well enough right up until the end. Clarissa is a young woman who has inherited a run down estate, Ashcroft. She has not much money and a brother who wants to profit by selling Ashcroft and taking over her care. What she does have is spirit and three good friends. They had all been living together under her mother's care but she died several months before and now find they must also go and live as poor relations. Until Clarissa decides to move to Ashcroft and pool their talents to get it into working order. Once there they make friends with 3 men and plot to keep her brother from exercising his rights as her closest male relative. This plotting was cute and enjoyable right until the final chapter. Then for whatever reason it all gives way into a very dull denouement.\n\nOn the plus side I had read Honoria and the Family Obligation before and quite enjoyed it. Perhaps this means Ms. Cameron is finding her groove within the Regency and that later ones will be better still.\n\nJanuary 15, 2023\n\nAfter a failed first attempt? Here, this second Listen was awwwww, soooo nice!\n\nMy Full Review →\n\nMay 31, 2016\n\nClarissa has inherited Ashcroft Manor and wants to bring the estate back to life. Her parents have raised her to be an independent woman but now her brother threatens everything.\n\nClarissa is a remarkable young lady of 18. I love that she thinks ahead, that she doesn’t just put up with what men tell her to do, that she fights and that she doesn’t give up when things get tough. Plus, she's such a young girl!! I mean, at that age, handling a brother like hers, handling a huge estate? Wow.\n\nHer friends who used to work with her at her mother’s girl school are with her at the estate are just plain gorgeous. They are all so different but love each other.\n\nThere’s Miss Appleby who would have to live with her cousin and his dreadful little children.\n\nOriana Petersham would be sold to the highest bidder. Good thing that her father included her in all estate matters and she has proved to be quite responsible. Too bad people see her as a disgrace since calling off her wedding with a 60 year old.\n\nAnd then there’s Miss Waity Micklewaithe.\n\nThe three of them are strong, determined and a great bunch of women.\n\nI think the portrayal of all the characters is plain gorgeous. That’s not just true for the women in this novel.\n\nE.g. I love the way Clarissa’s brother Mr Thorne is being portrayed. He thinks she’ll be grateful that he takes it out of her hands, she’ll be relieved – and anyways, what could a young lady know of business? Not like she basically worked together with her mother and her friends. All of this is quite historically accurate and great to read ;)\n\nAlso, I love that he’s not per se a mean guy. It’s just that he really thinks she will see it just like him and won’t even think differently.\n\nHis wife, however, is a completely different type of person. The way she is sneaking is just outrageous.\n\nAnyways, there are other men as well in this novel (fortunately):\n\nEarl of Grandiston\n\nHe had the intention of marrying Oriana but then the war intervened… Now he’s back to win her. Hah, yeah, that was what I thought. What he basically does to her? He makes her life a living hell by telling everyone the beauty is back in town, by asking her to flirt with their neighbor, by completely ignoring her at times. Yeah, not what I wanted.\n\nMr Elfoy, the agent who manages the estate, is deeply enraptured with Clarissa. Yet, their match couldn’t be more uneven. I love that he stands up for Clarissa and the other ladies, that he tries to do what’s best for Clarissa and doesn’t seem to find any fault with her handling the estate’s dealings.\n\nCharles Booth, a dashing and humorous young man who has developed a liking for Juliana Sowersby, one of Clarissa’s friends.\n\nPlot: great\n\nWriting style: good (poor editing)\n\nCharacters: great\n\nUnfortunately, editing was quite poorly done. Things are underlined, there is some repetition… However, the writing style was gorgeous so yeah… ;)\n\nAnyways, cool squeaky clean novel of friendship and love and family.\n\nFive stars would have been there if our hero Grandiston had been portrayed like a hero.\n\nJanuary 31, 2017\n\nI'll keep this short. This was a clean story, but it was also really boring. I'm grateful it was short and nothing in it made me too mad, but that's all I can say for it.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\n1) This story was completely clean and there was no real ow/om drama.\n\n2) The band of poor relations that make up this family was sweet albeit too silly for words.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\n1) How contrived it all was. The h, who flew in the face of convention about nearly everything, couldn't eschew society's dictates to marry the man she loved?\n\n2) The characters we weren't supposed to like were too one-faceted.\n\n3) How powerless the h was. Really, the overwhelming feeling I had when I finished this book was how grateful I am to have the rights I do.\n\n4) Another edit was needed. There were quite a few grammatical errors. Plus the way the author switched from first person narrative to third person was off putting.\n\nMarch 25, 2017\n\nThis book needs a competent editor. She switches points of view willy-nilly, and sometimes I had no idea which character I was reading about, as it would change within a paragraph! Grammar and punctuation need work. She tries for a Jane Austen-esque tone, but it falls flat. I couldn't get past a third of the book.\n\nJune 14, 2016\n\nRECENCY Female Friends\n\nPleasant story about young woman inherits an estate,takes her 3 fellow teachers along so they can make a home together.\n\nMay 12, 2019\n\nA Heady Mix of Delight, Intrigue and a little suspense\n\nThis is the 3rd book I have read by Alicia Cameron and her style owes much to her favourite authors, and mine- Georgette Heyer and Jane Austen. I put them in the order that I read them.\n\nI was lead to Georgette Heyer by the books bought by my sister's. I read them before I was even a teenager and they've been firm favourites, with her other wonderful stories, ever since. I came to Jane Austen later but her, deservedly acclaimed, tales of contempory times, have enthralled me, repeatedly as well. I believe Alicia Cameron's works are set to join those and others I've enjoyed discovering in the last year or so.\n\nThis book has been delightful and I'm not at all surprised she was encouraged to publish it, so a wider audience could share her family's pleasure. She follows Georgette Heyer in that; as her first story was written for her ailing brother. All her many fans are indebted to them both for the copious bounty that followed.\n\nAlicia Cameron has a deft touch with her characters and draws you in to their world and their concerns, so it's like going on their journey with them. The villains of the piece, are believable and the plot races along, with just the right amount of tensions, misunderstandings and hints of outcomes, along the way. My only, slight, disappointment is that it finished too soon. That however, is the mark of a good story. You want to reach the, hopefully, satisfying conclusion, but are saddened to finish the tale. It reminded me of another story featuring another person called Thorne, by the estimable Anthony Trollope.\n\nAnyone, with a love of the period, coming new to this author's works, will not be disappointed.\n\nMarch 20, 2021\n\nThis was my first book by Alicia Cameron and it got me hooked on the author (although I have mixed feelings about some of the other books). I read a lot of reviews who compared authors who write light, humorous Regency romances to Georgette Heyer and find it very unfair. I've never read anyone who compares to her writing, even if I find some characters or situations similarly good. This book has merits of its own and it's good in its own way. Alicia Cameron definitely has a unique style of writing that I find refreshing. One of the things I love about this story is that all main characters are very likable. I tend to prefer side characters in stories because they're usually more quirky and interesting and, even though my favorite pair in this story is Oriana and the Earl, I still thought Clarissa was delightful and her love interest very worthy of her. The other two \"poor relations\" and their stories were also very entertaining as well as Grandiston's friend, Booth. There were, of course, dastardly antagonists but the story was still light and interesting without any angst. This is a clean story that makes you feel good once you're done reading. I go back and listen to it from time to time when I'm in the mood for a feel good story (the audio/narrator is excellent although I'm glad Helen Taylor started narrating the author's more recent books. She is exceptional and specially adept at reading dandy characters).\n\nAugust 19, 2020\n\nNot a very deep story or your typical regency storyline, but I found it enjoyable and interesting despite being predictable. I picked this up after finishing a heavy read and I was looking for a lighthearted and entertaining escape. There are really several stories going on in this book and I wouldn't have minded reading a separate novel about some of the other characters as well. The story moves along quite well and the author does a good job of presenting the very parochial and limited rights available to women at that time - even when one is an heiress.\n\nSomething about this book is reminiscent of a Georgette Heyer novel - in the way that humor is often infused with dry stated facts. The reader does not get the privilege of getting personal with the MC, however, and at one point I almost wanted to know more about her friend than her own story.\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable read/listen. The narrator, although slow, does a great job (I listened at 1.3 x speed).\n\nJuly 10, 2021\n\nWhat a Delightful Story\n\nThe first regency book by this author and what an entertaining read it was, not as madcap as the other books I've read but an entertaining read none the less. The central female character Clarissa a young heiress who is in fear of her half brother selling her inheritence, in a bid to claim her money. She is helped by three females of varying ages and with varying reasons for not wanting to go to their respective families when their jobs as teachers came to an end. All would be used and abused by their families. They faced a terrible struggle against Clarrisa's brother and his grabbing wife and at one point they thought they had lost, but the right conclusion was reached from the most unlikely places. I would thoroughly recommend this book.\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\nLots of maneuvering not much romantic warmth\n\nThis was a pleasant story, but i felt the romance lacking. Not even an ending kiss. Apparently there was a walk in the garden, but I didn’t get to see it. Ms Appleby also fell in love, but I was not there. In fact, I felt a little distant from most of the characters. I didn’t understand Orianna’s anger towards Grandiston.\n\nThe great maneuvering plot hinged on someone putting a letter behind a clock instead of giving it to the person they see every day, getting it out months later, and instead of handing it to the person they still see everyday, packing it and then being so busy for months that she still couldn’t give it to the person she saw every day.\n\nNovember 29, 2023\n\nSuch an entertaining book!\n\nI absolutely loved this. It was clever and fast paced and joyful. I couldn’t help but think the author must have really enjoyed writing this. There was a lot going on, so it may’ve been a headache for her haha, but it was so excellently written. The characters are varied and unique, the story plays out like a movie with well painted scenes, but not overly concerned with explaining details that don’t move the story forward much. The dialogue was unexpected and funny and true to the period. I’m going to see if I can get my hands on anything else she’s written. I stayed up into the wee hours of the morning because I stupidly started in the evening thinking I would be able to put it down. Will definitely read this again.\n\nDecember 31, 2020\n\nA lovely little Regency\n\nClarissa Thorne's mother has died leaving her Ashford once their School for Young Ladies closes down. Clarissa 's brother and sister-in-law plan to sell Ashford and take Clarissa into their home as a babysitter/companion something Clarisa is dead set against. But what will she do with her best friends: Onoria, Misses Appleby and Micklethwaite? Despite its feminist agenda the women are assisted by good-looking men to reach a very satisfying conclusion. Three pairings in this novel.\n\nJune 2, 2022\n\nHugely fun story\n\nI have to say this author can write! And her plots are so delightfully original. After wading and skimming through so many lackluster, repetitive and weak Regency romances, I thank my lucky stars daily right now for bringing me to these fun Cameron novels.\n\nMy only complaint is the editing which was even a little more haphazard in this novel than in her others. But the characters are so lively, the story so interesting and compelling, i give this one four and a half stars.\n\nJanuary 26, 2021\n\nAlicia Cameron's style of writing is a throw-back to earlier works. There are occasional spots that I had to re-read a bit to figure out which character was speaking, but Clarissa and the Poor Relations is among my favorite books. There is plenty of humor, romance, subterfuge, and wicked relations. Mrs. Thorne (Clarissa's sister-in-law) is one of the worst sorts of characters to grace a novel. The creativity of the cast to find acceptable methods of thwarting the \"bad guys\" was impressive.\n\nJanuary 7, 2018\n\nWhat a deliciously enjoyable read overflowing with moments of hilarity, a delightful cast of characters, and romance around every corner. I have been totally charmed by my first book of Ms. Alicia Cameron’s and highly recommend it to all lovers of Regency, of romance, of hilarious situations and, of course, a HEA.\n\nVery much has the flavor and wit of Georgette Heyer.\n\nNovember 22, 2019\n\nI really loved this book\n\nI was completely impressed with the story and the characters. I honestly had no idea where it would all end up, which made it more fun to read. And in my mind the continuance shows that Mrs Thorne ends up a pauper though not to the detriment of her poor children who were sadly neglected by their parents in this story. Worth reading\n\nApril 2, 2022\n\nWonderful Women of Quality\n\nDuring a period of history when women were treated as possessions of men, these four multigenerational friends are admirable. Without much money, they are able to cleverly avoid having to live with relatives. Humor, intelligence, compassion, and friendship enrich a plot that also reveals there were reliable, lovable men in their lives !\n\nJuly 28, 2022\n\nFreddie\n\nWhat a wonderful story!! Completely different from all the other HR books I have read and well worth the read. This story has so many twists and turns you really can’t figure out how Ms Cameron is going to work it out so everyone lives happily ever after. ❤️❤️. I just wish she had included and epilogue\n\nJune 2, 2023\n\nThe beginning was good\n\nAt the beginning i was hopeful this would turn out to be similar to heyer. The writing was really good at the beginning. Then all of a sudden it got cheesy. So strange. I liked the story enough that i finished it, but the writing never got good again like it was at the beginning.\n\nRead\n\nJuly 18, 2023\n\nThis was the author's first book and in some ways its the best. Four ladies - 2 young and 2 not so young set out to revive a run down estate that one has inherited.\n\nTwo have unpleasant brothers, one with an evil wife plus there's a nasty neighbour who threaten the ladies tranquillity but a wide range of helpers also appear."
