        "text": "After Emma Stone won the Oscar for best actress in a leading role for her part as Bella Baxter in “Poor Things,” many fans were eager to watch (and re-watch) the Yorgos Lanthimos film.\n\n“Poor Things” won big at the Academy Awards and the Golden Globes during awards season, and the film garnered some controversy after it was censored in the U.K. due to one of its sex scenes.\n\nNow, those interested in watching the film on the small screen can stream “Poor Things” on Hulu. The streamer made the film available on March 7, just days ahead of the 2024 Academy Awards ceremony where it was nominated for 11 awards — second only to the 13 nominations for Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer.”\n\nThe fantasy feature follows Stone’s character as she is brought back to life by a scientist who implants her unborn baby’s brain into her body. Bella encounters the likes of Duncan Wedderburn, played by Mark Ruffalo, and other men along her path of self-discovery.\n\n“Poor Things” went into a limited release Dec. 8, followed by a wide release Dec. 22. The film won four Oscars, including Stone’s win for best actress in a leading role, production design, costume design and makeup and hairstyling. Plus it took home Golden Globes for best musical or comedy and best performance by a female actor in a musical or comedy film.\n\nHere’s what to know about “Poor Things” and where to stream it.\n\nWhere can I watch ‘Poor Things’?\n\n“Poor Things” is available to stream on Hulu as of March 7.\n\nWill there be a DVD or Blu-ray release of ‘Poor Things’?\n\nDVD and Blu-ray releases of “Poor Things” became available March 12 at most retailers in the U.S.\n\nWhat is ‘Poor Things’ about?\n\nBased on Alasdair Gray’s novel of the same name, “Poor Things” centers on Bella as she grapples with her sense of humanity, womanhood and motherhood in her now-Frankenstein-like body. She also encounters various men who help on her journey to self-discovery.\n\nStone told the New York Times that Bella is the “greatest character” she may ever play, adding that she immediately boarded the film after director Yorgos Lanthimos told her about the role, she said.\n\n“He gave me sort of the brass-tacks overview of Bella, what she goes through and what the men in her life experience as a response to how she’s evolving,” Stone said. “And I was just like, ‘Sign me up. My God, she’s the greatest character I’ll probably ever get to play.”\n\nIn Stone’s own words, the film ends on “the birth of Bella.” Stone said she and the assistant director were working on the last scene of the movie and the “La La Land” actor became overwhelmed with sadness.\n\n“Oh, my God, this is so sad,” she said. “It’s the end of the movie after this whole joyful experience. And (the assistant director) said, ‘No, this is the birth of Bella.’ I was like, ‘It is the birth of Bella! Because Victoria being gone is the birth of Bella.’ It’s so nice to end on that.”"
