At the crowded gangways there was the usual rain of ultimate kisses, from the quayside the usual gale of speeding handkerchiefs. Ladies in blanket-coats handed over to the arrangement of their table-stewards the expensive bouquets presented by friends who, as the case might be, had been glad or sorry to see them go. Middle-aged gentlemen, who were probably not at all conspicuous on shore, at once made their appearance in caps that they might have felt shy about wearing even during their university prime. Children in the first confusion of settling down ate more chocolates from the gift boxes lying about the cabins than they were likely to be given (or perhaps to want) for some time. Two young women with fresh complexions, short skirts, tam o' shanters, brightly colored jumpers, and big bows to their shoes were already on familiar terms with one of the junior ship's officers, and their laughter (which would soon become one of those unending oceanic accompaniments that make land so pleasant again) was already competing with the noise of the crew. Everybody boasted aloud that they fed you really well on the Murmania, and hoped silently that perhaps the sense of being imprisoned in a decaying hot-water bottle (or whatever more or less apt comparison was invented to suggest atmosphere below decks) would pass away in the fresh Atlantic breezes. Indeed it might be said, except in the case of a few ivory-faced ladies already lying back with the professional aloofness of those who are a prey to chronic headaches, that outwardly optimism was rampant.\n\nIt was not surprising, therefore, that John Touchwood, the successful romantic playwright and unsuccessful realistic novelist, should on finding himself hemmed in by such invincible cheerfulness surrender to his own pleasant fancies of home. This was one of those moments when he was able to feel that the accusation of sentimentality so persistently laid against his work by superior critics was rebutted out of the very mouth of real life. He looked round at his fellow passengers as though he would congratulate them on conforming to his later and more profitable theory of art; and if occasionally he could not help seeing a stewardess with a glance of discreet sympathy reveal to an inquirer the ship's provision for human weakness, he did not on this account feel better disposed toward morbid intrusions either upon art or life, partly because he was himself an excellent sailor and partly because after all as a realist he had unquestionably not been a success.\n\n\"Time for a shave before lunch, steward?\" he inquired heartily.\n\n\"The first bugle will go in about twenty minutes, sir.\"\n\nJohn paused for an instant at his own cabin to extract from his suitcase the particular outrage upon conventional headgear (it was a deerstalker of Lovat tweed) that he had evolved for this voyage; and presently he was sitting in the barber shop, wondering at first why anybody should be expected to buy any of the miscellaneous articles exposed for sale at such enhanced prices on every hook and in every nook of the little saloon, and soon afterward seriously considering the advantage of a pair of rope-soled shoes upon a heeling deck.\n\n\"Very natty things those, sir,\" said the barber. \"I laid in a stock once at Gib., when we did the southern rowt. Shave you close, sir?\"\n\n\"Once over, please.\"\n\n\"Skin tender?\"\n\n\"Rather tender.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. And the beard's a bit strong, sir. Shave yourself, sir?\"\n\n\"Usually, but I was up rather early this morning.\"\n\n\"Safety razor, sir?\"\n\n\"If you think such a description justifiable—yes—a safety.\"\n\n\"They're all the go now, and no mistake ... safety bicycles, safety matches, safety razors ... they've all come in our time ... yes, sir, just a little bit to the right—thank you, sir! Not your first crossing, I take it?\"\n\n\"No, my third.\"\n\n\"Interesting place, America. But I am from Wandsworth myself. Hair's getting rather thin round the temples. Would you like something to brisken up the growth a bit? Another time? Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Parting on the left's it, I think?\"\n\n\"No grease,\" said John as fiercely as he ever spoke. The barber seemed to replace the pot of brilliantine with regret.\n\n\"What would you like then?\" He might have been addressing a spoilt child. \"Flowers-and-honey? Eau-de-quinine? Or perhaps a friction? I've got lavingder, carnation, wallflower, vilit, lilerk....\"\n\n\"Bay rum,\" John declared, firmly.\n\nThe barber sighed for such an unadventurous soul; and John, who could not bear to hurt even the most superficial emotions of a barber, changed his mind and threw him into a smiling bustle of gratification.\n\n\"Rather strong,\" John said, half apologetically; for while the friction was being administered the barber had explained in jerks how every time he went ashore in New York or Liverpool he was in the habit of searching about for some novel wash or tonic or pomade, and John did not want to make him feel that his enterprise was unappreciated.\n\n\"Strong is it? Well, that's a good fault, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose it is.\"\n\n\"What took my fancy was the natural way it smelled.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, painfully natural,\" John agreed.\n\nHe stood up and confronted himself in the barber's mirror; regarding the fair, almost florid man, rather under six feet in height, with sanguine blue eyes and full, but clearly cut, lips therein reflected, he came to the comforting conclusion that he did not look his forty-two years and nine months; indeed, while his muffled whistle was shaping rather than uttering the tune of Nancy Lee, he nearly asked the barber to guess his age. However, he decided not to risk it, pulled down the lapels of his smoke-colored tweed coat, put on his deerstalker, tipped the barber sufficiently well to secure a parting caress from the brush, promised to meditate the purchase of the rope-soled shoes, and stepped jauntily in the direction of the luncheon bugle. If John Touchwood had not been a successful romantic playwright and an unsuccessful realistic novelist, he might have found in the spectacle of the first lunch of an Atlantic voyage an illustration of human madness and the destructive will of the gods. As it was, his capacity for rapidly covering the domestic offices of the brain with the crimson-ramblers of a lush idealism made him forget the base fabric so prettily if obviously concealed. As it was, he found an exhilaration in all this berserker greed, in the cries of inquisitive children, in the rumpled appearance of women whom the bugle had torn from their unpacking with the urgency of the last trump, in the acrid smell of pickles, and in the persuasive gesture with which the glistening stewards handed the potatoes while they glared angrily at one another over their shoulders. If a cynical realist had in respect of this lunch observed to John that a sow's ear was poor material for a silk purse, he would have contested the universal truth of the proverb, for at this moment he was engaged in chinking the small change of sentimentality in just such a purse.\n\n\"How jolly everybody is,\" he thought, swinging round to his neighbor, a gaunt woman in a kind of draggled mantilla, with an effusion of good-will that expressed itself in a request to pass her the pickled walnuts. John fancied an impulse to move away her chair when she declined his offer; but of course the chair was fixed, and the only sign of her distaste for pickles or conversation was a faint quiver, which to any one less rosy than John might have suggested abhorrence, but which struck him as merely shyness. It was now that for the first time he became aware of a sickly fragrance that was permeating the atmosphere, a fragrance that other people, too, seemed to be noticing by the way in which they were looking suspiciously at the stewards.\n\n\"Rather oppressive, some of these flowers,\" said John to the gaunt lady.\n\n\"I don't see any flowers at our end of the table,\" she replied.\n\nAnd then with an emotion that was very nearly horror John realized that, though the barber was responsible, he must pay the penalty in a vicarious mortification. His first impulse was to snatch a napkin and wipe his hair; then he decided to leave the table immediately, because after all nobody could suspect him, in these as yet unvexed waters, of anything but repletion; finally, hoping that the much powdered lady opposite swathed in mauve chiffons was getting the discredit for the fragrance, he stayed where he was. Nevertheless, the exhilaration had departed; his neighbors all seemed dull folk; and congratulating himself that after this first confused lunch he might reasonably expect to be put at the captain's table in recognition of the celebrity that he could fairly claim, John took from his pocket a bundle of letters which had arrived just before he had left his hotel and busied himself with them for the rest of the meal.\n\nHis success as a romantic playwright and his failure—or, as he would have preferred to think of it in the satisfaction of fixing the guilty fragrance upon the lady in mauve chiffons, his comparative failure—as a realistic novelist had not destroyed John's passion for what he called \"being practical in small matters,\" and it was in pursuit of this that having arranged his letters in two heaps which he mentally labeled as \"business\" and \"pleasure\" he began with the former, as a child begins (or ought to begin) his tea with the bread and butter and ends it with the plumcake. In John's case, fresh from what really might be described as a triumphant production in New York, the butter was spread so thickly that \"business\" was too forbidding a name for such pleasantly nutritious communications. His agent had sent him the returns of the second week; and playing to capacity in one of the largest New York theaters is nearer to a material paradise than anything outside the Mohammedan religion. Then there was an offer from one of the chief film companies to produce his romantic drama of two years ago, that wonderful riot of color and Biblical phraseology, The Fall of Babylon. They ventured to think that the cinematographer would do his imagination more justice than the theater, particularly as upon their dramatic ranch in California they now had more than a hundred real camels and eight real elephants. John chuckled at the idea of a few animals compensating for the absence of his words, but nevertheless ... the entrance of Nebuchadnezzar, yes, it should be wonderfully effective ... and the great grass-eating scene, yes, that might positively be more impressive on the films ... with one or two audiences it had trembled for a moment between the sublime and the ridiculous. It was a pity that the offer had not arrived before he was leaving New York, but no doubt he should be able to talk it over with the London representatives of the firm. Hullo here was Janet Bond writing to him ... charming woman, charming actress.... He wandered for a few minutes rather vaguely in the maze of her immense handwriting, but disentangled his comprehension at last and deciphered:\n\nTHE PARTHENON THEATRE.\n\nSole Proprietress: Miss Janet Bond.\n\nOctober 10, 1910.\n\nDear Mr. Touchwood,—I wonder if you have forgotten our talk at Sir Herbert's that night? I'm so hoping not. And your scheme for a real Joan of Arc? Do think of me this winter. Your picture of the scene with Gilles de Rais—you see I followed your advice and read him up—has haunted me ever since. I can hear the horses' hoofs coming nearer and nearer and the cries of the murdered children. I'm so glad you've had a success with Lucrezia in New York. I don't think it would suit me from what I read about it. You know how particular my public is. That's why I'm so anxious to play the Maid. When will Lucrezia be produced in London, and where? There are many rumours. Do come and see me when you get back to England, and I'll tell you who I've thought of to play Gilles. I think you'll find him very intelligent. But of course everything depends on your inclination, or should I say inspiration? And then that wonderful speech to the Bishop! How does it begin? \"Bishop, thou hast betrayed thy holy trust.\" Do be a little flattered that I've remembered that line. It needn't all be in blank verse, and I think little Truscott would be so good as the Bishop. You see how enthusiastic I am and how I believe in the idea. All good wishes.\n\nYours sincerely and hopefully,\n\nJanet Bond.\n\nJohn certainly was a little flattered that Miss Bond should have remembered the Maid's great speech to the Bishop of Beauvais, and the actress's enthusiasm roused in him an answering flame, so that the cruet before him began to look like the castelated walls of Orleans, and while his gaze was fixed upon the bowl of salad he began to compose Act II. Scene I—Open country. Enter Joan on horseback. From the summit of a grassy knoll she searches the horizon. So fixedly was John regarding his heroine on top of the salad that the head steward came over and asked anxiously if there was anything the matter with it. And even when John assured him that there was nothing he took it away and told one of the under-stewards to remove the caterpillar and bring a fresh bowl. Meanwhile, John had picked up the other bundle of letters and begun to read his news from home.\n\n65 HILL ROAD,\n\nSt. John's Wood, N.W.,\n\nOctober 10.\n\nDEAR JOHN,—We have just read in the Telegraph of your great success and we are both very glad. Edith writes me that she did have a letter from you. I dare say you thought she would send it on to us but she didn't, and of course I understand you're busy only I should have liked to have had a letter ourselves. James asks me to tell you that he is probably going to do a book on the Cymbalist movement in literature. He says that the time has come to take a final survey of it. He is also writing some articles for the Fortnightly Review. We shall all be so glad to welcome you home again.\n\nYour affectionate sister-in-law,\n\nBEATRICE TOUCHWOOD.\n\n\"Poor Beatrice,\" thought John, penitently. \"I ought to have sent her a line. She's a good soul. And James ... what a plucky fellow he is! Always full of schemes for books and articles. Wonderful really, to go on writing for an audience of about twenty people. And I used to grumble because my novels hadn't world-wide circulations. Poor old James ... a good fellow.\"\n\nHe picked up the next letter; which he found was from his other sister-in-law.\n\nHALMA HOUSE,\n\n198 Earl's Court Square, S.W.,\n\nOctober 9.\n\nDEAR JOHN,—Well, you've had a hit with Lucrezia, lucky man! If you sent out an Australian company, don't you think I might play lead? I quite understand that you couldn't manage it for me either in London or America, but after all you are the author and you surely have some say in the cast. I've got an understudy at the Parthenon, but I can't stand Janet. Such a selfish actress. She literally doesn't think of any one but herself. There's a chance I may get a decent part on tour with Lambton this autumn. George isn't very well, and it's been rather miserable this wet summer in the boarding house as Bertram and Viola were ill and kept away from school. I would have suggested their going down to Ambles, but Hilda was so very unpleasant when I just hinted at the idea that I preferred to keep them with me in town. Both children ask every day when you're coming home. You're quite the favourite uncle. George was delighted with your success. Poor old boy, he's had another financial disappointment, and your success was quite a consolation.\n\nELEANOR.\n\n\"I wish Eleanor was anywhere but on the stage,\" John sighed. \"But she's a plucky woman. I must write her a part in my next play. Now for Hilda.\"\n\nHe opened his sister's letter with the most genial anticipation, because it was written from his new country house in Hampshire, that county house which he had coveted for so long and to which the now faintly increasing motion of the Murmania reminded him that he was fast returning.\n\nAMBLES,\n\nWrottesford, Hants,\n\nOctober 11.\n\nMy Dear John,—Just a line to congratulate you on your new success. Lots of money in it, I suppose. Dear Harold is quite well and happy at Ambles. Quite the young squire! I had a little coolness with Eleanor—entirely on her side of course, but Bertram is really such a bad influence for Harold and so I told her that I did not think you would like her to take possession of your new house before you'd had time to live in it yourself. Besides, so many children all at once would have disturbed poor Mama. Edith drove over with Frida the other day and tells me you wrote to her. I should have liked a letter, too, but you always spoil poor Edith. Poor little Frida looks very peaky. Much love from Harold who is always asking when you're coming home. Mama is very well, I'm glad to say.\n\nYour affectionate sister,\n\nHILDA CURTIS.\n\n\"She might have told me a little more about the house,\" John murmured to himself. And then he began to dream about Ambles and to plant old-fashioned flowers along its mellow red-brick garden walls. \"I shall be in time to see the colouring of the woods,\" he thought. The Murmania answered his aspiration with a plunge, and several of the rumpled ladies rose hurriedly from table to prostrate themselves for the rest of the voyage. John opened a fourth letter from England.\n\nTHE VICARAGE,\n\nNewton Candover, Hants,\n\nOctober 7.\n\nMy Dearest John,—I was so glad to get your letter, and so glad to hear of your success. Laurence says that if he were not a vicar he should like to be a dramatic author. In fact, he's writing a play now on a Biblical subject, but he fears he will have trouble with the Bishop, as it takes a very broad view of Christianity. You know that Laurence has recently become very broad? He thinks the village people like it, but unfortunately old Mrs. Paxton—you know who I mean—the patroness of the living—is so bigoted that Laurence has had a great deal of trouble with her. I'm sorry to say that dear little Frida is looking thin. We think it's the wet summer. Nothing but rain. Ambles was looking beautiful when we drove over last week, but Harold is a little bumptious and Hilda does not seem to see his faults. Dear Mama was looking very well—better than I've seen her for ages. Frida sends such a lot of love to dearest Uncle John. She never stops talking about you. I sometimes get quite jealous for Laurence. Not really, of course, because family affection is the foundation of civil life. Laurence is out in the garden speaking to a man whose pig got into our conservatory this morning. Much love.\n\nYour loving sister,\n\nEDITH.\n\nJohn put the letter down with a faint sigh: Edith was his favorite sister, but he often wished that she had not married a parson. Then he took up the last letter of the family packet, which was from his housekeeper in Church Row.\n\n39 CHURCH ROW,\n\nHampstead, N.W.\n\nDEAR SIR,—This is to inform you with the present that everythink is very well at your house and that Maud and Elsa is very well as it leaves me at present. We as heard nothink from Emily since she as gone down to Hambles your other house, and we hope which is Maud, Elsa and myself you wont spend all your time out of London which is looking lovely at present with the leaves beginning to turn and all. With dutiful respects from Maud, Elsa and self, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMARY WORFOLK.\n\n\"Dear old Mrs. Worfolk. She's already quite jealous of Ambles ... charming trait really, for after all it means she appreciates Church Row. Upon my soul, I feel a bit jealous of Ambles myself.\"\n\nJohn began to ponder the pleasant heights of Hampstead and to think of the pale blue October sky and of the yellow leaves shuffling and slipping along the quiet alleys in the autumn wind; to think, too, of his library window and of London spread out below in a refulgence of smoke and gold; to think of the chrysanthemums in his little garden and of the sparrows' chirping in the Virginia-creeper that would soon be all aglow like a well banked-up fire against his coming. Five delightful letters really, every one of them full of good wishes and cordial affection! The Murmania swooped forward, and there was a faint tingle of glass and cutlery. John gathered up his correspondence to go on deck and bless the Atlantic for being the pathway to home. As he rose from the table he heard a voice say:\n\n\"Yes, my dear thing, but I've never been a poor relation yet, and I don't intend to start now.\"\n\nThe saloon was empty except for himself and two women opposite, the climax of whose conversation had come with such a harsh fitness of comment upon the letters he had just been reading. John was angry with himself for the dint so easily made upon the romantic shield he upheld against life's onset; he felt that he had somehow been led into an ambush where all his noblest sentiments had been massacred; five bells sounded upon the empty saloon with an almost funereal gravity; and, when the two women passed out, John, notwithstanding the injured regard of his steward, sat down again and read right through the family letters from a fresh standpoint. The fact of it was that there had turned out to be very few currants in the cake, for the eating of which he had prepared himself with such well-buttered bread. Few currants? There was not a single one, unless Mrs. Worfolk's antagonism to the idea of Ambles might be considered a gritty shred of a currant. John rose at once when he had finished his letters, put them in his pocket, and followed the unconscious disturbers of his hearth on deck. He soon caught sight of them again where, arm in arm, they were pacing the sunlit starboard side and apparently enjoying the gusty southwest wind. John wondered how long it would be before he was given a suitable opportunity to make their acquaintance, and tried to regulate his promenade so that he should always meet them face to face either aft or forward, but never amidships where heavily muffled passengers reclined in critical contemplation of their fellow-travellers over the top of the last popular novel. \"Some men, you know,\" he told himself, \"would join their walk with a mere remark about the weather. They wouldn't stop to consider if their company was welcome. They'd be so serenely satisfied with themselves that they'd actually succeed ... yes, confound them ... they'd bring it off! Yet, after all, I suppose in a way that without vanity I might presume they would be rather interested to meet me. Because, of course, there's no doubt that people are interested in authors. But, it's no good ... I can't do that ... this is really one of those moments when I feel as if I was still seventeen years old ... shyness, I suppose ... yet the rest of my family aren't shy.\"\n\nThis took John's thoughts back to his relations, but to a much less complacent point of view of them than before that maliciously apposite remark overheard in the saloon had lighted up the group as abruptly and unbecomingly as a magnesium flash. However inconsistent he might appear, he was afraid that he should be more critical of them in future. He began to long to talk over his affairs with that girl and, looking up at this moment, he caught her eyes, which either because the weather was so gusty or because he was so ready to hang decorations round a simple fact seemed to him like calm moorland pools, deep violet-brown pools in heathery solitudes. Her complexion had the texture of a rose in November, the texture that gains a rare lucency from the grayness and moisture by which one might suppose it would be ruined. She was wearing a coat and skirt of Harris tweed of a shade of misty green, and with her slim figure and fine features she seemed at first glance not more than twenty. But John had not passed her another half-dozen times before he had decided that she was almost a woman of thirty. He looked to see if she was wearing a wedding ring and was already enough interested in her to be glad that she was not. This relief was, of course, not at all due to any vision of himself in a more intimate relationship; but merely because he was glad to find that her personality, of which he was by now more definitely aware than of her beauty (well, not beauty, but charm, and yet perhaps after all he was being too grudging in not awarding her positive beauty) would be her own. There was something distinctly romantic in this beautiful young woman of nearly thirty leading her own life unimpeded by a loud-voiced husband. Of course, the husband might have had a gentle voice, but usually this type of woman seemed a prey to bluffness and bigness, as if to display her atmosphere charms she had need of a rugged landscape for a background. He found himself glibly thinking of her as a type; but with what type could she be classified? Surely she was attracting him by being exceptional rather than typical; and John soothed his alarmed celibacy by insisting that she appealed to him with a hint of virginal wisdom which promised a perfect intercourse, if only their acquaintanceship could be achieved naturally, that is to say, without the least suggestion of an ulterior object. She had never been a poor relation yet, and she did not intend to start being one now. Of course, such a woman was still unmarried. But how had she avoided being a poor relation? What was her work? Why was she coming home to England? And who was her companion? He looked at the other woman who walked beside her with a boyish slouch, wore gold pince-nez, and had a tight mouth, not naturally tight, but one that had been tightened by driving and riding. It was absurd to walk up and down forever like this; the acquaintance must be made immediately or not at all; it would never do to hang round them waiting for an opportunity of conversation. John decided to venture a simple remark the next time he met them face to face; but when he arrived at the after end of the promenade deck they had vanished, and the embarrassing thought occurred to him that perhaps having divined his intention they had thus deliberately snubbed him. He went to the rail and leaned over to watch the water undulating past; a sudden gust caught his cap and took it out to sea. He clapped his hand too late to his head; a fragrance of carnations breathed upon the salt windy sunlight; a voice behind him, softly tremulous with laughter, murmured:\n\n\"I say, bad luck.\"\n\nJohn commended his deerstalker to the care of all the kindly Oceanides and turned round: it was quite easy after all, and he was glad that he had not thought of deliberately letting his cap blow into the sea.\n\n\"Look, it's actually floating like a boat,\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, it was shaped like a boat,\" John said; he was thinking how absurd it was now to fancy that swiftly vanishing, utterly inappropriate piece of concave tweed should only a few seconds ago have been worn the other way round on a human head.\n\n\"But you mustn't catch cold,\" she added. \"Haven't you another cap?\"\n\nJohn did possess another cap, one that just before he left England he had bought about dusk in the Burlington Arcade, one which in the velvety bloom of a July evening had seemed worthy of summer skies and seas, but which in the glare of the following day had seemed more like the shreds of barbaric attire that are brought back by travelers from exotic lands to be taken out of a glass case and shown to visitors when the conversation is flagging on Sunday afternoons in the home counties. Now if John's plays were full of fierce hues, if his novels had been sepia studies of realism which the public considered painful and the critics described as painstaking, his private life had been of a mild uniform pink, a pinkishness that recalled the chaste hospitality of the best spare bedroom. Never yet in that pink life had he let himself go to the extent of wearing a cap, which, even if worn afloat by a colored prizefighter crossing the Atlantic to defend or challenge supremacy, would have created an amused consternation, but which on the head of a well-known romantic playwright must arouse at least dismay and possibly panic. Yet this John (he had reached the point of regarding himself with objective surprise), the pinkishness of whose life, though it might be a protest against cynicism and gloom, was eternally half-way to a blush, went off to his cabin with the intention of putting on that cap. With himself for a while he argued that something must be done to imprison the smell of carnations, that a bowler hat would look absurd, that he really must not catch cold; but all the time this John knew perfectly well that what he really wanted was to give a practical demonstration of his youth. This John did not care a damn about his success as a romantic playwright, but he did care a great deal that these two young women should vote him a suitable companion for the rest of the voyage.\n\n\"Why, it's really not so bad,\" he assured himself, when before the mirror he tried to judge the effect. \"I rather think it's better than the other one. Of course, if I had seen when I bought it that the checks were purple and not black I dare say I shouldn't have bought it—but, by Jove, I'm rather glad I didn't notice them. After all, I have a right to be a little eccentric in my costume. What the deuce does it matter to me if people do stare? Let them stare! I shall be the last of the lot to feel seasick, anyway.\"\n\nJohn walked defiantly back to the promenade deck, and several people who had not bothered to remark the well-groomed florid man before now asked who he was, and followed his progress along the deck with the easily interested gaze of the transatlantic passenger.\n\nFor the rest of the voyage John never knew whether the attention his entrance into the saloon always evoked was due to his being the man who wore the unusual cap or to his being the man who had written The Fall of Babylon; nor, indeed, did he bother to make sure, for he was fortified during the rest of the voyage by the company of Miss Doris Hamilton and Miss Ida Merritt and thoroughly enjoyed himself.\n\n\"Now am I attributing to Miss Hamilton more discretion than she's really got?\" he asked himself on the last night of the passage, a stormy night off the Irish coast, while he swayed before the mirror in the creaking cabin. John was accustomed, like most men with clear-cut profiles, to take advice from his reflection, and perhaps it was his dramatic instinct that led him usually to talk aloud to this lifelong friend. \"Have I in fact been too impulsive in this friendship? Have I? That's the question. I certainly told her a lot about myself, and I think she appreciated my confidence. Yet suppose that she's just an ordinary young woman and goes gossiping all over England about meeting me? I really must remember that I'm no longer a nonentity and that, though Miss Hamilton is not a journalist, her friend is, and, what is more, confessed that the sole object of her visit to America had been to interview distinguished men with the help of Miss Hamilton. The way she spoke about her victims reminded me of the way that fellow in the smoking-saloon talked about the tarpon fishing off Florida ... famous American statesmen, financiers, and architects existed quite impersonally for her to be caught just like tarpon. Really when I come to think of it I've been at the end of Miss Merritt's rod for five days, and as with all the others the bait was Miss Hamilton.\"\n\nJohn's mistrust in the prudence of his behavior during the voyage had been suddenly roused by the prospect of reaching Liverpool next day. The word positively exuded disillusionment; it was as anti-romantic as a notebook of Herbert Spencer. He undressed and got into his bunk; the motion of the ship and the continual opening and shutting of cabin doors all the way along the corridor kept him from sleep, and for a long time he lay awake while the delicious freedom of the seas was gradually enslaved by the sullen, prosaic, puritanical, bilious word—Liverpool. He had come down to his cabin, full of the exhilaration of a last quick stroll up and down the spray-whipped deck; he had come down from a long and pleasant talk all about himself where he and Miss Hamilton had sat in the lee of some part of a ship's furniture the name of which he did not know and did not like to ask, a long and pleasant talk, cozily wrapped in two rugs glistening faintly in the starlight with salty rime; he had come down from a successful elimination of Miss Merritt, his whole personality marinated in freedom, he might say; and now the mere thought of Liverpool was enough to disenchant him and to make him feel rather like a man who was recovering from a brilliant, a too brilliant revelation of himself provoked by champagne. He began to piece together the conversation and search for indiscretions. To begin with, he had certainly talked a great deal too much about himself; it was not dignified for a man in his position to be so prodigally frank with a young woman he had only known for five days. Suppose she had been laughing at him all the time? Suppose that even now she was laughing at him with Miss Merritt? \"Good heavens, what an amount I told her,\" John gasped aloud. \"I even told her what my real circulation was when I used to write novels, and I very nearly told her how much I made out of The Fall of Babylon, though since that really was a good deal, it wouldn't have mattered so much. And what did I say about my family? Well, perhaps that isn't so important. But how much did I tell her of my scheme for Joan of Arc? Why, she might have been my confidential secretary by the way I talked. My confidential secretary? And why not? I am entitled to a secretary—in fact my position demands a secretary. But would she accept such a post? Now don't let me be impulsive.\"\n\nJohn began to laugh at himself for a quality in which as a matter of fact he was, if anything, deficient. He often used to chaff himself, but, of course, always without the least hint of ill-nature, which is perhaps why he usually selected imaginary characteristics for genial reproof.\n\n\"Impulsive dog,\" he said to himself. \"Go to sleep, and don't forget that confidential secretaries afloat and confidential secretaries ashore are very different propositions. Yes, you thought you were being very clever when you bought those rope-soled shoes to keep your balance on a slippery deck, but you ought to have bought a rope-soled cap to keep your head from slipping.\"\n\nThis seemed to John in the easy optimism that prevails upon the borders of sleep an excellent joke, and he passed with a chuckle through the ivory gate.\n\nThe next day John behaved helpfully and politely at the Customs, and indeed continued to be helpful and polite until his companions of the voyage were established in a taxi at Euston. He had carefully written down the Hamiltons' address with a view to calling on them one day, but even while he was writing the number of the square in Chelsea he was thinking about Ambles and trying to decide whether he should make a dash across London to Waterloo on the chance of catching the 9:05 P.M. or spend the night at his house in Church Row.\n\n\"I think perhaps I'd better stay in town to-night,\" he said. \"Good-by. Most delightful trip across—see you both again soon, I hope. You don't advise me to try for the 9:05?\" he asked once more, anxiously.\n\nMiss Hamilton laughed from the depths of the taxi; when she laughed, for the briefest moment John felt an Atlantic breeze sweep through the railway station.\n\n\"I recommend a good night's rest,\" she said.\n\nSo John's last thought of her was of a nice practical young woman; but, as he once again told himself, the idea of a secretary was absurd. Besides, did she even know shorthand?\n\n\"Do you know shorthand?\" he turned round to shout as the taxi buzzed away; he did not hear her answer, if answer there was.\n\n\"Of course I can always write,\" he decided, and without one sigh he busied himself with securing his own taxi for Hampstead.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\"I'VE got too many caps, Mrs. Worfolk,\" John proclaimed next morning to his housekeeper. \"You can give this one away.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Who would you like it given to?\"\n\n\"Oh, anybody, anybody. Tramps very often ask for old boots, don't they? Some tramp might like it.\"\n\n\"Would you have any erbjections if I give it to my nephew, sir?\"\n\n\"None whatever.\"\n\n\"It seems almost too perky for a tramp, sir; and my sister's boy—well, he's just at the age when they like to dress theirselves up a bit. He's doing very well, too. His employers is extremely satisfied with the way he's doing. Extremely satisfied, his employers are.\"\n\n\"I'm delighted to hear it.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Well, it's been some consolation to my poor sister, I mean to say, after the way her husband behaved hisself, and it's to be hoped Herbert'll take fair warning. Let me see, you will be having lunch at home I think you said?\"\n\nJohn winced: this was precisely what he would have avoided by catching the 9:05 at Waterloo last night.\n\n\"I shan't be in to lunch for a few days, Mrs. Worfolk, no—er—nor to dinner either as a matter of fact. No—in fact I'll be down in the country. I must see after things there, you know,\" he added with an attempt to suggest as jovially as possible a real anxiety about his new house.\n\n\"The country, oh yes,\" repeated Mrs. Worfolk grimly; John saw the beech-woods round Ambles blasted by his housekeeper's disapproval.\n\n\"You wouldn't care to—er—come down and give a look round yourself, Mrs. Worfolk? My sister, Mrs. Curtis—\"\n\n\"Oh, I should prefer not to intrude in any way, sir. But if you insist, why, of course—\"\n\n\"Oh no, I don't insist,\" John hurriedly interposed.\n\n\"No, sir. Well, we shall all have to get used to being left alone nowadays, and that's all there is to it.\"\n\n\"But I shall be back in a few days, Mrs. Worfolk. I'm a Cockney at heart, you know. Just at first—\"\n\nMrs. Worfolk shook her head and waddled tragically to the door.\n\n\"There's nothing else you'll be wanting this morning, sir?\" she turned to ask in accents that seemed to convey forgiveness of her master in spite of everything.\n\n\"No, thank you, Mrs. Worfolk. Please send Maud up to help me pack. Good heavens,\" he added to himself when his housekeeper had left the room, \"why shouldn't I be allowed a country house? And I suppose the next thing is that James and Beatrice and George and Eleanor will all be offended because I didn't go tearing round to see them the moment I arrived. One's relations never understand that after the production of a play one requires a little rest. Besides, I must get on with my new play. I absolutely must.\"\n\nJohn's tendency to abhor the vacuum of success was corrected by the arrival of Maud, the parlor-maid, whose statuesque anemia and impersonal neatness put something in it. Before leaving for America he had supplemented the rather hasty preliminary furnishing of his new house by ordering from his tailor a variety of country costumes. These Maud, with feminine intuition superimposed on what she would have called her \"understanding of valeting,\" at once produced for his visit to Ambles; John in the prospect of half a dozen unworn peat-perfumed suits of tweed flung behind him any lingering doubt about there being something in success, and with the recapture of his enthusiasm for what he called \"jolly things\" was anxious that Maud should share in it.\n\n\"Do you think these new things are a success, Maud?\" he asked, perhaps a little too boisterously. At any rate, the parlor-maid's comprehension of valeting had apparently never been so widely stretched, for a faint coralline blush tinted her waxen cheeks.\n\n\"They seem very nice, sir,\" she murmured, with a slight stress upon the verb.\n\nJohn felt that he had trespassed too far upon the confines of Maud's humanity and retreated hurriedly. He would have liked to explain that his inquiry had merely been a venture into abstract esthetics and that he had not had the least intention of extracting her opinion about these suits on him; but he felt that an attempt at explanation would embarrass her, and he hummed instead over a selection of ties, as a bee hums from flower to flower in a garden, careless of the gardener who close at hand is potting up plants.\n\n\"I will take these ties,\" he announced on the last stave of A Fine Old English Gentleman.\n\nMaud noted them gravely.\n\n\"And I shall have a few books. Perhaps there won't be room for them?\"\n\n\"There won't be room for them, not in your dressing-case, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know there won't be room in that,\" said John, bitterly.\n\nHis dressing-case might be considered the medal he had struck in honor of The Fall of Babylon: he had passed it every morning on his way to rehearsals and, dreaming of the triumph that might soon be his, had vowed he would buy it were such a triumph granted. It had cost £75, was heavy enough when empty to strain his wrist and when full to break his back, and it contained more parasites of the toilet table and the writing desk than one could have supposed imaginable. These parasites each possessed an abode of such individual shape that leaving them behind made no difference to the number of really useful articles, like pajamas, that could be carried in the cubic space lined with blue corded silk on which they looked down like the inconvenient houses of a fashionable square. Therefore wherever John went, the fittings went too, a glittering worthless mob of cut-glass, pigskin, tortoiseshell and ivory.\n\n\"But in my portmanteau,\" John persisted. \"Won't there be room there?\"\n\n\"I might squeeze them in,\" Maud admitted. \"It depends what boots you're wanting to take with you, sir.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" he sighed. \"I can make a separate parcel of them.\"\n\n\"There's the basket what we were going to use for the cat, sir.\"\n\n\"No, I should prefer a brown paper parcel,\" he decided. It would be improper for the books out of which the historical trappings of his Joan of Arc were to be manufactured to travel in a lying-in hospital for cats.\n\nJohn left Maud to finish the packing and went downstairs to his library. This double room of fine proportions was, as one might expect from the library of a popular writer, the core—the veritable omphalos of the house; with its fluted pilasters, cream-colored panels and cherub-haunted ceiling, the expanse of city and sky visible from three sedate windows at the south end and the glimpse of a busy Hampstead street caught from those facing north, not to speak of the prismatic rows of books, it was a room worthy of art's most remunerative triumphs, the nursery of inspiration, and, save for a slight suggestion that the Muses sometimes drank afternoon tea there, the room of an indomitable bachelor. When John stepped upon the wreaths, ribbons, and full-blown roses of the threadbare Aubusson rug that floated like gossamer upon a green carpet of Axminster pile as soft as some historic lawn, he was sure that success was not a vacuum. In his now optimistic mood he hoped ultimately to receive from Ambles the kind of congratulatory benediction that the library at Church Row always bestowed upon his footsteps. Indeed, if he had not had such an ambition for his country house, he could scarcely have endured to quit even for a week this library, where fires were burning in two grates and where the smoke of his Partaga was haunting, like a complacent ghost, the imperturbable air. John possessed another library at Ambles, but he had not yet had time to do more than hurriedly stock it with the standard works that he felt no country house should be without. His library in London was the outcome of historical research preparatory to writing his romantic plays; and since all works of popular historical interest are bound with a much more lavish profusion of color and ornament even than the works of fiction to which they most nearly approximate, John's shelves outwardly resembled rather a collection of armor than a collection of books. There were, of course, many books the insides of which were sufficiently valuable to excuse their dingy exterior; but none of these occupied the line, where romance after romance of exiled queens, confession after confession of morganatic wives, memoir after memoir from above and below stairs, together with catch-penny alliterative gatherings as of rude regents and libidinous landgraves flashed in a gorgeous superficiality of gilt and text. In order to amass the necessary material for a play about Joan of Arc John did not concern himself with original documents. He assumed, perhaps rightly, that a Camembert cheese is more palatable and certainly more portable than a herd of unmilked cows. To dramatize the life of Joan of Arc he took from his shelves Saints and Sinners of the Fifteenth Century ... but a catalogue is unnecessary: enough that when the heap of volumes chosen stood upon his desk it glittered like the Maid herself before the walls of Orleans.\n\n\"After all,\" as John had once pointed out in a moment of exasperation to his brother, James, the critic, \"Shakespeare didn't sit all day in the reading-room of the British Museum.\"\n\nAn hour later the playwright, equipped alike for country rambles and poetic excursions, was sitting in a first-class compartment of a London and South-Western railway train; two hours after that he was sitting in the Wrottesford fly swishing along between high hazel hedges of golden-brown.\n\n\"I shall have to see about getting a dog-cart,\" he exclaimed, when after a five minutes' struggle to let down the window with the aid of a strap that looked like an Anglican stole he had succeeded in opening the door and nearly falling head-long into the lane.\n\n\"You have to let down the window before you get out,\" said the driver reproachfully, trying to hammer the frameless window back into place and making such a noise about it that John could not bear to accentuate by argument the outrage that he was offering to this morning of exquisite decline, on which earth seemed to be floating away into a windless infinity like one of her own dead leaves. No, on such a morning controversy was impossible, but he should certainly take immediate steps to acquire a dog-cart.\n\n\"For it's like being jolted in a badly made coffin,\" he thought, when he was once more encased in the fly and, having left the high road behind, was driving under an avenue of sycamores bordered by a small stream, the water of which was stained to the color of sherry by the sunlight glowing down through the arches of tawny leaves overhead. To John this avenue always seemed the entrance to a vast park surrounding his country house; it was indeed an almost unfrequented road, grass-grown in the center and lively with rabbits during most of the day, so that his imagination of ancestral approaches was easily stimulated and he felt like a figure in a painting by Marcus Stone. It was lucky that John's sanguine imagination could so often satisfy his ambition; prosperous playwright though he was, he had not yet made nearly enough money to buy a real park. However, in his present character of an eighteenth-century squire he determined, should the film version of The Fall of Babylon turn out successful, to buy a lawny meadow of twenty acres that would add much to the dignity and seclusion of Ambles, the boundaries of which at the back were now overlooked by a herd of fierce Kerry cows who occupied the meadow and during the summer had made John's practice shots with a brassy too much like big-game shooting to be pleasant or safe. After about a mile the avenue came to an end where a narrow curved bridge spanned the stream, which now flowed away to the left along the bottom of a densely wooded hillside. The fly crossed over with an impunity that was surprising in face of a printed warning that extraordinary vehicles should avoid this bridge, and began to climb the slope by a wide diagonal track between bushes of holly, the green of which seemed vivid and glossy against the prevailing brown. The noise of the wheels was deadened by the heavy drift of beech leaves, and the stillness of this russet world, except for the occasional scream of a jay or the flapping of disturbed pigeons, demanded from John's illustrative fancy something more remote and Gothic than the eighteenth century.\n\n\"Malory,\" he said to himself. \"Absolute Malory. It's almost impossible not to believe that Sir Gawaine might not come galloping down through this wood.\"\n\nEager to put himself still more deeply in accord with the romantic atmosphere, John tried this time to open the door of the fly with the intention of walking meditatively up the hill in its wake; the door remained fast; but he managed to open the window, or rather he broke it.\n\n\"I've a jolly good mind to get a motor,\" he exclaimed, savagely.\n\nEvery knight errant's horse in the neighborhood bolted at the thought, and by the time John had reached the top of the hill and emerged upon a wide stretch of common land dotted with ancient hawthorns in full crimson berry he was very much in the present. For there on the other side of the common, flanked by shelving woods of oak and beech and backed by rising downs on which a milky sky ruffled its breast like a huge swan lazily floating, stood Ambles, a solitary, deep-hued, Elizabethan house with dreaming chimney-stacks and tumbled mossy roofs and garden walls rising from the heaped amethysts of innumerable Michaelmas daisies.\n\n\"My house,\" John murmured in a paroxysm of ownership.\n\nThe noise of the approaching fly had drawn expectant figures to the gate; John, who had gratified affection, curiosity and ostentation by sending a wireless message from the Murmania, a telegram from Liverpool yesterday, and another from Euston last night to announce his swift arrival, had therefore only himself to thank for perceiving in the group the black figure of his brother-in-law, the Reverend Laurence Armitage. He drove away the scarcely formed feeling of depression by supposing that Edith could not by herself have trundled the barrel-shaped vicarage pony all the way from Newton Candover to Ambles, and, finding that the left-hand door of the fly was unexpectedly susceptible to the prompting of its handle, he alighted with such rapidity that not one of his smiling relations could have had any impression but that he was bounding to greet them. The two sisters were so conscious of their rich unmarried brother's impulsive advance that each incited her own child to responsive bounds so that they might meet him half-way along the path to the front door, in the harborage of which Grandma (whose morning nap had been interrupted by a sudden immersion in two shawls, and a rapid swim with Emily, the maid from London, acting as lifebuoy down the billowy passages and stairs of the old house) rocked in breathless anticipation of the filial salute.\n\n\"Welcome back, my dear Johnnie,\" the old lady panted.\n\n\"How are you, mother? What, another new cap?\"\n\nOld Mrs. Touchwood patted her head complacently. \"We bought it at Threadgale's in Galton. The ribbons are the new hollyhock red.\"\n\n\"Delightful!\" John exclaimed. \"And who helped you to choose it? Little Frida here?\"\n\n\"Nobody helped me, Johnnie. Hilda accompanied me into Galton; but she wanted to buy a sardine-opener for the house.\"\n\nJohn had not for a moment imagined that his mother had wanted any advice about a cap; but inasmuch as Frida, in what was intended to be a demonstrative welcome, prompted by her mother, was rubbing her head against his ribs like a calf against a fence, he had felt he ought to hook her to the conversation somehow. John's concern about Frida was solved by the others' gathering round him for greetings.\n\nFirst Hilda offered her sallow cheek, patting while he kissed it her brother on the back with one hand, and with the other manipulating Harold in such a way as to give John the impression that his nephew was being forced into his waistcoat pocket.\n\n\"He feels you're his father now,\" whispered Hilda with a look that was meant to express the tender resignation of widowhood, but which only succeeded in suggesting a covetous maternity. John doubted if Harold felt anything but a desire to escape from being sandwiched between his mother's crape and his uncle's watch chain, and he turned to embrace Edith, whose cheeks, soft and pink as a toy balloon, were floating tremulously expectant upon the glinting autumn air.\n\n\"We've been so anxious about you,\" Edith murmured. \"And Laurence has such a lot to talk over with you.\"\n\nJohn, with a slight sinking that was not altogether due to its being past his usual luncheon hour, turned to be welcomed by his brother-in-law.\n\nThe vicar of Newton Candover's serenity if he had not been a tall and handsome man might have been mistaken for smugness; as it was, his personality enveloped the scene with a ceremonious dignity that was not less than archidiaconal, and except for his comparative youthfulness (he was the same age as John) might well have been considered archiepiscopal.\n\n\"Edith has been anxious about you. Indeed, we have all been anxious about you,\" he intoned, offering his hand to John, for whom the sweet damp odors of autumn became a whiff of pious women's veils, while the leaves fluttering gently down from the tulip tree in the middle of the lawn lisped like the India-paper of prayer-books.\n\n\"I've got an air-gun, Uncle John,\" ejaculated Harold, who having for some time been inhaling the necessary breath now expelled the sentence in a burst as if he had been an air-gun himself. John hailed the announcement almost effusively; it reached him with the kind of relief with which in childhood he had heard the number of the final hymn announced; and a robin piping his delicate tune from the garden wall was welcome as birdsong in a churchyard had been after service on Sundays handicapped by the litany.\n\n\"Would you like to see me shoot at something?\" Harold went on, hastily cramming his mouth with slugs.\n\n\"Not now, dear,\" said Hilda, hastily. \"Uncle John is tired. And don't eat sweets just before lunch.\"\n\n\"Well, it wouldn't tire him to see me shoot at something. And I'm not eating sweets. I'm getting ready to load.\"\n\n\"Let the poor child shoot if he wants to,\" Grandma put in.\n\nHarold beamed ferociously through his spectacles, took a slug from his mouth, fitted it into the air-gun, and fired, bringing down two leaves from an espalier pear. Everybody applauded him, because everybody felt glad that it had not been a window or perhaps even himself; the robin cocked his tail contemptuously and flew away.\n\n\"And now I must go and get ready for lunch,\" said John, who thought a second shot might be less innocuous, and was moreover really hungry. His bedroom, dimity draped, had a pleasant rustic simplicity, but he decided that it wanted living in: the atmosphere at present was too much that of a well-recommended country inn.\n\n\"Yes, it wants living in,\" said John to himself. \"I shall put in a good month here and break the back of Joan of Arc.\"\n\n\"What skin is this, Uncle John?\" a serious voice at his elbow inquired. John started; he had not observed Harold's scout-like entrance.\n\n\"What skin is that, my boy?\" he repeated in what he thought was the right tone of avuncular jocularity and looking down at Harold, who was examining with myopic intensity the dressing-case. \"That is the skin of a white elephant.\"\n\n\"But it's brown,\" Harold objected.\n\nJohn rashly decided to extend his facetiousness.\n\n\"Yes, well, white elephants turn brown when they're shot, just as lobsters turn red when they're boiled.\"\n\n\"Who shot it?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know—probably some friend of the gentleman who keeps the shop where I bought it.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Well, I can't exactly say when—but probably about three years ago.\"\n\n\"Father used to shoot elephants, didn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy, your father used to shoot elephants.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he shot this one.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he did.\"\n\n\"Was he a friend of the gentleman who keeps the shop where you bought it?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't be surprised,\" said John.\n\n\"Wouldn't you?\" said Harold, skeptically. \"My father was an asplorer. When I'm big I'm going to be an asplorer, too; but I sha'n't be friends with shopkeepers.\"\n\n\"Confounded little snob,\" John thought, and began to look for his nailbrush, the address of whose palatial residence of pigskin only Maud knew.\n\n\"What are you looking for, Uncle John?\" Harold asked.\n\n\"I'm looking for my nailbrush, Harold.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"To clean my nails.\"\n\n\"Are they dirty?\"\n\n\"Well, they're just a little grubby after the railway journey.\"\n\n\"Mine aren't,\" Harold affirmed in a lofty tone. Then after a minute he added: \"I thought perhaps you were looking for the present you brought me from America.\"\n\nJohn turned pale and made up his mind to creep unobserved after lunch into the market town of Galton and visit the local toyshop. It would be an infernal nuisance, but it served him right for omitting to bring presents either for his nephew or his niece.\n\n\"You're too smart,\" he said nervously to Harold. \"Present time will be after tea.\" The sentence sounded contradictory somehow, and he changed it to \"the time for presents will be five o'clock.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Harold asked.\n\nJohn was saved from answering by a tap at the door, followed by the entrance of Mrs. Curtis.\n\n\"Oh, Harold's with you?\" she exclaimed, as if it were the most surprising juxtaposition in the world.\n\n\"Yes, Harold's with me,\" John agreed.\n\n\"You mustn't let him bother you, but he's been so looking forward to your arrival. When is Uncle coming, he kept asking.\"\n\n\"Did he ask why I was coming?\"\n\nHilda looked at her brother blankly, and John made up his mind to try that look on Harold some time.\n\n\"Have you got everything you want?\" she asked, solicitously.\n\n\"He hasn't got his nailbrush,\" said Harold.\n\nHilda assumed an expression of exaggerated alarm.\n\n\"Oh dear, I hope it hasn't been lost.\"\n\n\"No, no, no, it'll turn up in one of the glass bottles. I was just telling Harold that I haven't really begun my unpacking yet.\"\n\n\"Uncle John's brought me a present from America,\" Harold proclaimed in accents of greedy pride.\n\nHilda seized her brother's hand affectionately.\n\n\"Now you oughtn't to have done that. It's spoiling him. It really is. Harold never expects presents.\"\n\n\"What a liar,\" thought John. \"But not a bigger one than I am myself,\" he supplemented, and then he announced aloud that he must go into Galton after lunch and send off an important telegram to his agent.\n\n\"I wonder ...\" Hilda began, but with an arch look she paused and seemed to thrust aside temptation.\n\n\"What?\" John weakly asked.\n\n\"Why ... but no, he might bore you by walking too slowly. Harold,\" she added, seriously, \"if Uncle John is kind enough to take you into Galton with him, will you be a good boy and leave your butterfly net at home?\"\n\n\"If I may take my air-gun,\" Harold agreed.\n\nJohn rapidly went over in his mind the various places where Harold might be successfully detained while he was in the toyshop, decided that the risk would be too great, pulled himself together, and declined the pleasure of his nephew's company on the ground that he must think over very carefully the phrasing of the telegram he had to send, a mental process, he explained, that Harold might distract.\n\n\"Another day, darling,\" said Hilda, consolingly.\n\n\"And then I'll be able to take my fishing-rod,\" said Harold.\n\n\"He is so like his poor father,\" Hilda murmured.\n\nJohn was thinking sympathetically of the distant Amazonian tribe that had murdered Daniel Curtis, when there was another tap at the door, and Frida crackling loudly in a clean pinafore came in to say that the bell for lunch was just going to ring.\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said her aunt. \"Uncle John knows already. Don't bother him now. He's tired after his journey. Come along, Harold.\"\n\n\"He can have my nailbrush if he likes,\" Harold offered.\n\n\"Run, darling, and get it quickly then.\"\n\nHarold rushed out of the room and could be heard hustling his cousin all down the corridor, evoking complaints of \"Don't, Harold, you rough boy, you're crumpling my frock.\"\n\nThe bell for lunch sounded gratefully at this moment, and John, without even washing his hands, hurried downstairs trying to look like a hungry ogre, so anxious was he to avoid using Harold's nailbrush.\n\nThe dining-room at Ambles was a long low room with a large open fireplace and paneled walls; from the window-seats bundles of drying lavender competed pleasantly with the smell of hot kidney-beans upon the table, at the head of which John took his rightful place; opposite to him, placid as an untouched pudding, sat Grandmama. Laurence said grace without being invited after standing up for a moment with an expression of pained interrogation; Edith accompanied his words by making with her forefinger and thumb a minute cruciform incision between two of the bones of her stays, and inclined her head solemnly toward Frida in a mute exhortation to follow her mother's example. Harold flashed his spectacles upon every dish in turn; Emily's waiting was during this meal of reunion colored with human affection.\n\n\"Well, I'm glad to be back in England,\" said John, heartily.\n\nAn encouraging murmur rippled round the table from his relations.\n\n\"Are these French beans from our own garden?\" John asked presently.\n\n\"Scarlet-runners,\" Hilda corrected. \"Yes, of course. We never trouble the greengrocer. The frosts have been so light ...\"\n\n\"I haven't got a bean left,\" said Laurence.\n\nJohn nearly gave a visible jump; there was something terribly suggestive in that simple horticultural disclaimer.\n\n\"Our beans are quite over,\" added Edith in the astonished voice of one who has tumbled upon a secret of nature. She had a habit of echoing many of her husband's remarks like this; perhaps \"echoing\" is a bad description of her method, for she seldom repeated literally and often not immediately. Sometimes indeed she would wait as long as half an hour before she reissued in the garb of a personal philosophical discovery or of an exegitical gloss the most casual remark of Laurence, a habit which irritated him and embarrassed other people, who would look away from Edith and mutter a hurried agreement or ask for the salt to be passed.\n\n\"I remember,\" said old Mrs. Touchwood, \"that beans were a favorite dish of poor Papa, though I myself always liked peas better.\"\n\n\"I like peas,\" Harold proclaimed.\n\n\"I like peas, too,\" cried Frida excitedly.\n\n\"Frida,\" said her father, pulling out with a click one of the graver tenor stops in his voice, \"we do not talk at table about our likes and dislikes.\"\n\nEdith indorsed this opinion with a grave nod at Frida, or rather with a solemn inclination of the head as if she were bowing to an altar.\n\n\"But I like new potatoes best of all,\" continued Harold. \"My gosh, all buttery!\"\n\nLaurence screwed up his eye in a disgusted wince, looked down his nose at his plate, and drew a shocked cork from his throat.\n\n\"Hush,\" said Hilda. \"Didn't you hear what Uncle Laurence said, darling?\"\n\nShe spoke as one speaks to children in church when the organ begins; one felt that she was inspired by social tact rather than by any real reverence for the clergyman.\n\n\"Well, I do like new potatoes, and I like asparagus.\"\n\nFrida was just going to declare for asparagus, too, when she caught her father's eye and choked.\n\n\"Evidently the vegetable that Frida likes best,\" said John, riding buoyantly upon the gale of Frida's convulsions, \"is an artichoke.\"\n\nIt is perhaps lucky for professional comedians that rich uncles and judges rarely go on the stage; their occupation might be even more arduous if they had to face such competitors. Anyway, John had enough success with his joke to feel much more hopeful of being able to find suitable presents in Galton for Harold and Frida; and in the silence of exhaustion that succeeded the laughter he broke the news of his having to go into town and dispatch an urgent telegram that very afternoon, mentioning incidentally that he might see about a dog-cart, and, of course, at the same time a horse. Everybody applauded his resolve except his brother-in-law who looked distinctly put out.\n\n\"But you won't be gone before I get back?\" John asked.\n\nLaurence and Edith exchanged glances fraught with the unuttered solemnities of conjugal comprehension.\n\n\"Well, I had wanted to have a talk over things with you after lunch,\" Laurence explained. \"In fact, I have a good deal to talk over. I should suggest driving you in to Galton, but I find it impossible to talk freely while driving. Even our poor old pony has been known to shy. Yes, indeed, poor old Primrose often shies.\"\n\nJohn mentally blessed the aged animal's youthful heart, and said, to cover his relief, that old maids were often more skittish than young ones.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Harold.\n\nEverybody felt that Harold's question was one that should not be answered.\n\n\"You wouldn't understand, darling,\" said his mother; and the dining-room became tense with mystery.\n\n\"Of course, if we could have dinner put forward half an hour,\" said Laurence, dragging the conversation out of the slough of sex, \"we could avail ourselves of the moon.\"\n\n\"Yes, you see,\" Edith put in eagerly, \"it wouldn't be so dark with the moon.\"\n\nLaurence knitted his brow at this and his wife hastened to add that an earlier dinner would bring Frida's bed-time much nearer to its normal hour.\n\n\"The point is that I have a great deal to talk over with John,\" Laurence irritably explained, \"and that,\" he looked as if he would have liked to add \"Frida's bed-time can go to the devil,\" but he swallowed the impious dedication and crumbled his bread.\n\nFinally, notwithstanding that everybody felt very full of roast beef and scarlet-runners, it was decided to dine at half-past six instead of half-past seven.\n\n\"Poor Papa, I remember,\" said old Mrs. Touchwood, \"always liked to dine at half-past three. That gave him a nice long morning for his patients and time to smoke his cigar after dinner before he opened the dispensary in the evening. Supper was generally cold unless he anticipated a night call, in which case we had soup.\"\n\nAll were glad that the twentieth century had arrived, and they smiled sympathetically at the old lady, who, feeling that her anecdote had scored a hit, embarked upon another about being taken to the Great Exhibition when she was eleven years old, which lasted right through the pudding, perhaps because it was trifle, and Harold did not feel inclined to lose a mouthful by rash interruptions.\n\nAfter lunch John was taken all over the house and all round the garden and congratulated time after time upon the wisdom he had shown in buying Ambles: he was made to feel that property set him apart from other men even more definitely than dramatic success.\n\n\"Of course, Daniel was famous in his way,\" Hilda said. \"But what did he leave me?\"\n\nJohn, remembering the £120 a year in the bank and the collection of stuffed humming birds at the pantechnicon, the importation of which to Ambles he was always dreading, felt that Hilda was not being ungratefully rhetorical.\n\n\"And of course,\" Laurence contributed, \"a vicar feels that his glebe—the value of which by the way has just gone down another £2 an acre—is not his own.\"\n\n\"Yes, you see,\" Edith put in, \"if anything horrid happened to Laurence it would belong to the next vicar.\"\n\nAgain the glances of husband and wife played together in mid-air like butterflies.\n\n\"And so,\" Laurence went on, \"when you tell us that you hope to buy this twenty-acre field we all realize that in doing so you would most emphatically be consolidating your property.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure you're wise to buy,\" said Hilda, weightily.\n\n\"It would make Ambles so much larger, wouldn't it?\" suggested Edith. \"Twenty acres, you see ... well, really, I suppose twenty acres would be as big as from....\"\n\n\"Come, Edith,\" said her husband. \"Don't worry poor John with comparative acres—we are all looking at the twenty-acre field now.\"\n\nThe fierce little Kerry cows eyed the prospective owner peacefully, until Harold hit one of them with a slug from his air-gun, when they all began to career about the field, kicking up their heels and waving their tails.\n\n\"Don't do that, my boy,\" John said, crossly—for him very crossly.\n\nA short cut to Galton lay across this field, which John, though even when they were quiet he never felt on really intimate terms with cows, had just decided to follow.\n\n\"Darling, that's such a cruel thing to do,\" Hilda expostulated. \"The poor cow wasn't hurting you.\"\n\n\"It was looking at me,\" Harold protested.\n\n\"There is a legend about Francis of Assisi, Harold,\" his Uncle Laurence began, \"which will interest you and at the same time....\"\n\n\"Sorry to interrupt,\" John broke in, \"but I must be getting along. This telegram.... I'll be back for tea.\"\n\nHe hurried off and when everybody called out to remind him of the short cut across the twenty-acre field he waved back cheerfully, as if he thought he was being wished a jolly walk; but he took the long way round.\n\nIt was a good five miles to Galton in the opposite direction from the road by which he had driven up that morning; but on this fine autumn afternoon, going down hill nearly all the way through a foreground of golden woods with prospects of blue distances beyond, John enjoyed the walk, and not less because even at the beginning of it he stopped once or twice to think how jolly it would be to see Miss Hamilton and Miss Merritt coming round the next bend in the road. Later on, he did not bother to include Miss Merritt, and finally he discovered his fancy so steadily fixed upon Miss Hamilton that he was forced to remind himself that Miss Hamilton in such a setting would demand a much higher standard of criticism than Miss Hamilton on the promenade deck of the Murmania. Nevertheless, John continued to think of her; and so pleasantly did her semblance walk beside him and so exceptionally mild was the afternoon for the season of the year that he must have strolled along the greater part of the way. At any rate, when he saw the tower of Galton church he was shocked to find that it was already four o'clock.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE selection of presents for children is never easy, because in order to extract real pleasure from the purchase it is necessary to find something that excites the donor as much as it is likely to excite the recipient. In John's case this difficulty was quadrupled by having to find toys with an American air about them, and on top of that by the narrowly restricted choice in the Galton shops. He felt that it would be ridiculous, even insulting, to produce for Frida as typical of New York's luxurious catering for the young that doll, the roses of whose cheeks had withered in the sunlight of five Hampshire summers, and whose smile had failed to allure as little girls those who were now marriageable young women. Nor did he think that Harold would accept as worthy of American enterprise those more conspicuous portions of a diminutive Uhlan's uniform fastened to a dog's-eared sheet of cardboard, the sword belonging to which was rusting in the scabbard and the gilt lancehead of which no longer gave the least illusion of being metal. Finally, however, just as the clock was striking five he unearthed from a remote corner of the large ironmonger's shop, to which he had turned in despair from the toys offered him by the two stationers, a toboggan, and not merely a toboggan but a Canadian toboggan stamped with the image of a Red Indian.\n\n\"It was ordered for a customer in 1895,\" the ironmonger explained. \"There was heavy snow that year, you may remember.\"\n\nIf it had been ordered by Methuselah when he was still in his 'teens John would not have hesitated.\n\n\"Well, would you—er—wrap it up,\" he said, putting down the money.\n\n\"Hadn't the carrier better bring it, sir?\" suggested the ironmonger. \"He'll be going Wrottesford way to-morrow morning.\"\n\nObviously John could not carry the toboggan five miles, but just as obviously he must get the toboggan back to Ambles that night: so he declined the carrier, and asked the ironmonger to order him a fly while he made a last desperate search for Frida's present. In the end, with twilight falling fast, he bought for his niece twenty-nine small china animals, which the stationer assured him would enchant any child between nine and eleven, though perhaps less likely to appeal to ages outside that period. A younger child, for instance, might be tempted to put them in its mouth, even to swallow them if not carefully watched, while an older child might tread on them. Another advantage was that when the young lady for whom they were intended grew out of them, they could be put away and revived to adorn her mantelpiece when she had reached an age to appreciate the possibilities of a mantelpiece. John did not feel as happy about these animals as he did about the toboggan: there was not a single buffalo among them, and not one looked in the least distinctively American, but the stationer was so reassuring and time was going by so rapidly that he decided to risk the purchase. And really when they were deposited in a cardboard box among cotton-wool they did not look so dull, and perhaps Frida would enjoy guessing how many there were before she unpacked them.\n\n\"Better than a Noah's Ark,\" said John, hopefully.\n\n\"Oh yes, much better, sir. A much more suitable present for a young lady. In fact Noah's Arks are considered all right for village treats, but they're in very little demand among the gentry nowadays.\"\n\nWhen John was within a quarter of a mile from Ambles he told the driver of the fly to stop. Somehow he must creep into the house and up to his room with the toboggan and the china animals; it was after six, and the children would have been looking out for his return since five. Perhaps the cows would have gone home by now and he should not excite their nocturnal apprehensions by dragging the toboggan across the twenty-acre field. Meanwhile, he should tell the fly to wait five minutes before driving slowly up to the house, which would draw the scent and enable him with Emily's help to reach his room unperceived by the backstairs. A heavy mist hung upon the meadow, and the paper wrapped round the toboggan, which was just too wide to be carried under his arm like a portfolio, began to peel off in the dew with a swishing sound that would inevitably attract the curiosity of the cows were they still at large; moreover, several of the china animals were now chinking together and, John could not help feeling with some anxiety, probably chipping off their noses.\n\n\"I must look like a broken-down Santa Claus with this vehicle,\" he said to himself. \"Where's the path got to now? I wonder why people wiggle so when they make a path? Hullo! What's that?\"\n\nThe munching of cattle was audible close at hand, a munching that was sometimes interrupted by awful snorts.\n\n\"Perhaps it's only the mist that makes them do that,\" John tried to assure himself. \"It seems very imprudent to leave valuable cows out of doors on a damp night like this.\"\n\nThere was a sound of heavy bodies moving suddenly in unison.\n\n\"They've heard me,\" thought John, hopelessly. \"I wish to goodness I knew something about cows. I really must get the subject up. Of course, they may be frightened of me. Good heavens, they're all snorting now. Probably the best thing to do is to keep on calmly walking; most animals are susceptible to human indifference. What a little fool that nephew of mine was to shoot at them this afternoon. I'm hanged if he deserves his toboggan.\"\n\nThe lights of Ambles stained the mist in front; John ran the last fifty yards, threw himself over the iron railings, and stood panting upon his own lawn. In the distance could be heard the confused thudding of hoofs dying away toward the far end of the twenty-acre meadow.\n\n\"I evidently frightened them,\" John thought.\n\nA few minutes later he was calling down from the landing outside his bedroom that it was time for presents. In the first brief moment of intoxication that had succeeded his defeat of the cattle John had seriously contemplated tobogganing downstairs himself in order to \"surprise the kids\" as he put it. But from his landing the staircase looked all wrong for such an experiment and he walked the toboggan down, which lamplight appeared to him a typical product of the bear-haunted mountains of Canada.\n\nEverybody was waiting for him in the drawing-room; everybody was flatteringly enthusiastic about the toboggan and seemed anxious to make it at home in such strange surroundings; nobody failed to point out to the lucky boy the extreme kindness of his uncle in bringing back such a wonderful present all the way from America—indeed one almost had the impression that John must often have had to wake up and feed it in the night.\n\n\"The trouble you must have taken,\" Hilda exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, I did take a good deal of trouble,\" John admitted. After all, so he had—a damned sight more trouble than any one there suspected.\n\n\"When will it snow?\" Harold asked. \"To-morrow?\"\n\n\"I hope not—I mean, it might,\" said John. He must keep up Harold's spirits, if only to balance Frida's depression, about whose present he was beginning to feel very doubtful when he saw her eyes glittering with feverish anticipation while he was undoing the string. He hoped she would not faint or scream with disappointment when it was opened, and he took off the lid of the box with the kind of flourish to which waiters often treat dish-covers when they wish to promote an appetite among the guests.\n\n\"How sweet,\" Edith murmured.\n\nJohn looked gratefully at his sister; if he had made his will that night she would have inherited Ambles.\n\n\"Ah, a collection of small china animals,\" said Laurence, choosing a cat to set delicately upon the table for general admiration. John wished he had not chosen the cat that seemed to suffer with a tumor in the region of the tail and disinclined in consequence to sit still.\n\n\"Yes, I was anxious to get her a Noah's Ark,\" John volunteered, seeming to suggest by his tone how appropriate such a gift would have been to the atmosphere of a vicarage. \"But they've practically given up making Noah's Arks in America, and you see, these china animals will serve as toys now, and later on, when Frida is grown-up, they'll look jolly on the mantelpiece. Those that are not broken, of course.\"\n\nThe animals had all been taken out of their box by now, but a few paws and ears were still adhering to the cotton-wool.\n\n\"Frida is always very light on her toys,\" said Edith, proudly.\n\n\"Not likely to put them in her mouth,\" said John, heartily. \"That was the only thing that made me hesitate when I first saw them in Fifth Avenue. But they don't look quite so edible here.\"\n\n\"Frida never puts anything in her mouth,\" Edith generalized, primly. \"And she's given up biting her nails since Uncle John came home, haven't you, dear?\"\n\n\"That's a good girl,\" John applauded; he did not believe in Frida's sudden conquest of autophagy, but he was anxious to encourage her in every way at the moment.\n\nYes, the gift-horses had shown off their paces better than he had expected, he decided. To be sure, Frida did not appear beside herself with joy, but at any rate she had not burst into tears—she had not thrust the present from her sight with loathing and begged to be taken home. And then Harold, who had been staring at the animals through his glasses, like the horrid little naturalist that he was, said:\n\n\"I've seen some animals like them in Mr. Goodman's shop.\"\n\nJohn hoped a blizzard would blow to-morrow, that Harold would toboggan recklessly down the steepest slope of the downs behind Ambles, and that he would hit an oak tree at the bottom and break his glasses. However, none of these dark thoughts obscured the remote brightness with which he answered:\n\n\"Really, Harold. Very likely. There is a considerable exportation of china animals from America nowadays. In fact I was very lucky to find any left in America.\"\n\n\"Let's go into Gallon to-morrow and look at Mr. Goodman's animals,\" Harold suggested.\n\nJohn had never suspected that one day he should feel grateful to his brother-in-law; but when the dinner-bell went at half-past six instead of half-past seven solely on his account, John felt inclined to shake him by the hand. Nor would he have ever supposed that he should one day welcome the prospect of one of Laurence's long confidential talks. Yet when the ladies departed after dessert and Laurence took the chair next to himself as solemnly as if it were a fald-stool, he encouraged him with a smile.\n\n\"We might have our little talk now,\" and when Laurence cleared his throat John felt that the conversation had been opened as successfully as a local bazaar. Not merely did John smile encouragingly, but he actually went so far as to invite him to go ahead.\n\nLaurence sighed, and poured himself out a second glass of port.\n\n\"I find myself in a position of considerable difficulty,\" he announced, \"and should like your advice.\"\n\nJohn's mind went rapidly to the balance in his passbook instead of to the treasure of worldly experience from which he might have drawn.\n\n\"Perhaps before we begin our little talk,\" said Laurence, \"it would be as well if I were to remind you of some of the outstanding events and influences in my life. You will then be in a better position to give me the advice and help—ah—the moral help, of which I stand in need—ah—in sore need.\"\n\n\"He keeps calling it a little talk,\" John thought, \"but by Jove, it's lucky we did have dinner early. At this rate he won't get back to his vicarage before cock-crow.\"\n\nJohn was not deceived by his brother-in-law's minification of their talk, and he exchanged the trim Henry Clay he had already clipped for a very large Upman that would smoke for a good hour.\n\n\"Won't you light up before you begin?\" he asked, pushing a box of commonplace Murillos toward his brother-in-law, whose habit of biting off the end of a cigar, of letting it go out, of continually knocking off the ash, of forgetting to remove the band till it was smoldering, and of playing miserable little tunes with it on the rim of a coffee-cup, in fact of doing everything with it except smoke it appreciatively, made it impossible for John, so far as Laurence was concerned, to be generous with his cigars.\n\n\"I think you'll find these not bad.\"\n\nThis was true; the Murillos were not actually bad.\n\n\"Thanks, I will avail myself of your offer. But to come back to what I was saying,\" Laurence went on, lighting his cigar with as little expression of anticipated pleasure as might be discovered in the countenance of a lodging-house servant lighting a fire. \"I do not propose to occupy your time by an account of my spiritual struggles at the University.\"\n\n\"You ought to write a novel,\" said John, cheerfully.\n\nLaurence looked puzzled.\n\n\"I am now occupied with the writing of a play, but I shall come to that presently. Novels, however....\"\n\n\"I was only joking,\" said John. \"It would take too long to explain the joke. Sorry I interrupted you. Cigar gone out? Don't take another. It doesn't really matter how often those Murillos go out.\"\n\n\"Where am I?\" Laurence asked in a bewildered voice.\n\n\"You'd just left Oxford,\" John answered, quickly.\n\n\"Ah, yes, I was at Oxford. Well, as I was saying, I shall not detain you with an account of my spiritual struggles there.... I think I may almost without presumption refer to them as my spiritual progress ... let it suffice that I found myself on the vigil of my ordination after a year at Cuddesdon Theological College a convinced High Churchman. This must not be taken to mean that I belonged to the more advanced or what I should prefer to call the Italian party in the Church of England. I did not.\"\n\nLaurence here paused and looked at John earnestly; since John had not the remotest idea what the Italian party meant and was anxious to avoid being told, he said in accents that sought to convey relief at hearing his brother-in-law's personal contradiction of a charge that had for long been whispered against him:\n\n\"Oh, you didn't?\"\n\n\"No, I did not. I was not prepared to go one jot or one tittle beyond the Five Points.\"\n\n\"Of the compass, you mean,\" said John, wisely. \"Quite so.\"\n\nThen seeing that Laurence seemed rather indignant, he added quickly, \"Did I say the compass? How idiotic! Of course, I meant the law.\"\n\n\"The Five Points are the Eastward Position....\"\n\n\"It was the compass after all,\" John thought. \"What a fool I was to hedge.\"\n\n\"The Mixed Chalice, Lights, Wafer Bread, and Vestments, but not the ceremonial use of Incense.\"\n\n\"And those are the Five Points?\"\n\nLaurence inclined his head.\n\n\"Which you were not prepared to go beyond, I think you said?\" John gravely continued, flattering himself that he was re-established as an intelligent listener.\n\n\"In adhering to these Five Points,\" Laurence proceeded, \"I found that I was able to claim the support of a number of authoritative English divines. I need only mention Bishop Ken and Bishop Andrews for you to appreciate my position.\"\n\n\"Eastward, I think you said,\" John put in; for his brother-in-law had paused again, and he was evidently intended to say something.\n\n\"I perceive that you are not acquainted with the divergences of opinion that unhappily exist in our national Church.\"\n\n\"Well, to tell you the truth—and I know you'll excuse my frankness—I haven't been to church since I was a boy,\" John admitted. \"But I know I used to dislike the litany very much, and of course I had my favorite hymns—we most of us have—and really I think that's as far as I got. However, I have to get up the subject of religion very shortly. My next play will deal with Joan of Arc, and, as you may imagine, religion plays an important part in such a theme—a very important part. In addition to the vision that Joan will have of St. Michael in the first act, one of my chief unsympathetic characters is a bishop. I hope I'm not hurting your feelings in telling you this, my dear fellow. Have another cigar, won't you? I think you've dipped the end of that one in the coffee-lees.\"\n\nLaurence assured John bitterly that he had no reason to be particularly fond of bishops. \"In fact,\" he went on, \"I'm having a very painful discussion with the Bishop of Silchester at this moment, but I shall come to that presently. What I am anxious, however, to impress upon you at this stage in our little talk is the fact that on the vigil of my ordination I had arrived at a definite theory of what I could and could not accept. Well, I was ordained deacon by the Bishop of St. Albans and licensed to a curacy in Plaistow—one of the poorest districts in the East End of London. Here I worked for three years, and it was here that fourteen years ago I first met Edith.\"\n\n\"Yes, I seem to remember. Wasn't she working at a girls' club or something? I know I always thought that there must be a secondary attraction.\"\n\n\"At that time my financial position was not such as to warrant my embarking upon matrimony. Moreover, I had in a moment of what I should now call boyish exaltation registered a vow of perpetual celibacy. Edith, however, with that devotion which neither then nor at any crisis since has failed me expressed her willingness to consent to an indefinite engagement, and I remember with gratitude that it was just this consent of hers which was the means of widening the narrow—ah—the all too narrow path which at that time I was treading in religion. My vicar and I had a painful dispute upon some insignificant doctrinal point; I felt bound to resign my curacy, and take another under a man who could appreciate and allow for my speculative temperament. I became curate to St. Thomas's, Kensington, and had hopes of ultimately being preferred to a living. I realized in fact that the East End was a cul-de-sac for a young and—if I may so describe myself without being misunderstood—ambitious curate. For three years I remained at St. Thomas's and obtained a considerable reputation as a preacher. You may or may not remember that some Advent Addresses of mine were reprinted in one of the more tolerant religious weeklies and obtained what I do not hesitate to call the honor of being singled out for malicious abuse by the Church Times. Eleven years ago my dear father died and by leaving me an independence of £417 a year enabled me not merely to marry Edith, but very soon afterwards to accept the living of Newton Candover. I will not detain you with the history of my financial losses, which I hope I have always welcomed in the true spirit of resignation. Let it suffice that within a few years owing to my own misplaced charity and some bad advice from a relative of mine on the Stock Exchange my private income dwindled to £152, while at the same time the gross income of Newton Candover from £298 sank to the abominably low nett income of £102—a serious reflection, I think you will agree, upon the shocking financial system of our national Church. It may surprise you, my dear John, to learn that such blows from fate not only did not cast me down into a state of spiritual despair and intellectual atrophy, but that they actually had the effect of inciting me to still greater efforts.\"\n\nJohn had been fumbling with his check book when Laurence began to talk about his income; but the unexpected turn of the narrative quietened him, and the Upman was going well.\n\n\"You may or may not come across a little series of devotional meditations for the Man in the Street entitled Lamp-posts. They have a certain vogue, and I may tell you in confidence that under the pseudonym of The Lamplighter I wrote them. The actual financial return they brought me was slight. Barabbas, you know, was a publisher. Ha-ha! No, although I made nothing, or rather practically nothing out of them for my own purse, by leading me to browse among many modern works of theology and philosophy I began to realize that there was a great deal of reason for modern indifference and skepticism. In other words, I discovered that, in order to keep the man in the street a Christian, Christianity must adapt itself to his needs. Filled with a reverent enthusiasm and perhaps half-consciously led along such a path by your conspicuous example of success, I have sought to embody my theories in a play, the protagonist of which is the apostle Thomas, whom when you read the play you will easily recognize as the prototype of the man in the street. And this brings me to the reason for which I have asked you for this little talk. The fact of the matter is that in pursuing my studies of the apostle Thomas I have actually gone beyond his simple rugged agnosticism, and I now at forty-two years of age after eighteen years as a minister of religion find myself unable longer to accept in any literal sense of the term whatever the Virgin Birth.\"\n\nLaurence poured himself out a third glass of port and waited for John to recover from his stupefaction.\n\n\"But I don't think I'm a very good person to talk to about these abstruse divine obstetrics,\" John protested. \"I really haven't considered the question. I know of course to what you refer, but I think this is essentially an occasion for professional advice.\"\n\n\"I do not ask for advice upon my beliefs,\" Laurence explained. \"I recognize that nobody is able to do anything for them except myself. What I want you to do is to let Edith, myself, and little Frida stay with you at Ambles—of course we should be paying guests and you could use our pony and trap and any of the vicarage furniture that you thought suitable—until it has been decided whether I am likely or not to have any success as a dramatist. I do not ask you to undertake the Quixotic task of trying to obtain a public representation of my play about the apostle Thomas. I know that Biblical subjects are forbidden by the Lord Chamberlain, surely a monstrous piece of flunkeyism. But I have many other ideas for plays, and I'm convinced that you will sympathize with my anxiety to be able to work undisturbed and, if I may say so, in close propinquity to another playwright who is already famous.\"\n\n\"But why do you want to leave your own vicarage?\" John gasped.\n\n\"My dear fellow, owing to what I can only call the poisonous behavior of Mrs. Paxton, my patron, to whom while still a curate at St. Thomas's, Kensington, I gave an abundance of spiritual consolation when she suffered the loss of her husband, owing as I say to her poisonous behavior following upon a trifling quarrel about some alterations I made in the fabric of my church without consulting her, I have been subject to ceaseless inquisition and persecution. There has been an outcry in the more bigoted religious press about my doctrine, and in short I have thought it best and most dignified to resign my living. I am therefore, to use a colloquialism,—ah—at a loose end.\"\n\n\"And Edith?\" John asked.\n\n\"My poor wife still clings with feminine loyalty to those accretions to faith from which I have cut myself free. In most things she is at one with me, but I have steadily resisted the temptation to intrude upon the sanctity of her intimate beliefs. She sees my point of view. Of her sympathy I can only speak with gratitude. But she is still an old-fashioned believer. And indeed I am glad, for I should not like to think of her tossed upon the stormy seas of doubt and exposed to the—ah—hurricanes of speculation that surge through my own brains.\"\n\n\"And when do you want to move in to Ambles?\"\n\n\"Well, if it would be convenient, we should like to begin gradually to-morrow. I have informed the Bishop that I will—ah—be out in a fortnight.\"\n\n\"But what about Hilda?\" John asked, doubtfully. \"She is really looking after Ambles for me, you know.\"\n\n\"While we have been having our little talk in the dining-room Edith has been having her little talk with Hilda in the drawing-room, and I think I hear them coming now.\"\n\nJohn looked up quickly to see the effect of that other little talk, and determined to avoid for that night at least anything in the nature of little talks with anybody.\n\n\"Laurence dear,\" said Edith mildly, \"isn't it time we were going?\"\n\nJohn knew that not Hilda herself could have phrased more aptly what she was feeling; he was sure that in her opinion it was indeed high time that Edith and Laurence were going.\n\nLaurence went over to the window and pulled aside the curtains to examine the moon.\n\n\"Yes, my dear, I think we might have Primrose harnessed. Where is Frida?\"\n\n\"She is watching Harold arrange the animals that John gave her. They are playing at visiting the Natural History Museum.\"\n\nJohn was aware that he had not yet expressed his own willingness for the Armitage family to move into Ambles; he was equally aware that Hilda was trying to catch his eye with a questioning and indignant glance and that he had already referred the decision to her. At the same time he could not bring himself to exalt Hilda above Edith who was the younger and he was bound to admit the favorite of his two sisters; moreover, Hilda was the mother of Harold, and if Harold was to be considered tolerable in the same house as himself, he could not deny as much of his forbearance to Laurence.\n\n\"Well, I suppose you two girls have settled it between you?\" he said.\n\nHilda, who did not seem either surprised or elated at being called a girl, observed coldly that naturally it was for John to decide, but that if the vicarage family was going to occupy Ambles extra furniture would be required immediately.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Laurence. \"Didn't you make it clear to Hilda that as much of the vicarage furniture as is required can be sent here immediately? John and I had supposed that you were settling all these little domestic details during your little talk together.\"\n\n\"No, dear,\" Edith said, \"we settled nothing. Hilda felt, and of course I can't help agreeing with her, that it is really asking too much of John. She reminded me that he has come down here to work.\"\n\nThe last icicle of opposition melted from John's heart; he could not bear to think of Edith's being lectured all the way home by her husband under the light of a setting moon. \"I dare say we can manage,\" he said, \"and really, you know Hilda, it will do the rooms good to be lived in. I noticed this afternoon a slight smell of damp coming from the unfurnished part of the house.\"\n\n\"Apples, not damp,\" Hilda snapped. \"I had the apples stored in one of the disused rooms.\"\n\n\"All these problems will solve themselves,\" said Laurence, grandly. \"And I'm sure that John cannot wish to attempt them to-night. Let us all remember that he may be tired. Come along, Edith. We have a long day before us to-morrow. Let us say good-night to Mama.\"\n\nEdith started: it was the first time in eleven years of married life that her husband had adopted the Touchwood style of addressing or referring to their mother, and it seemed to set a seal upon his more intimate association with her family in the future. If any doubts still lingered about the forthcoming immigration of the vicarage party to Ambles they were presently disposed of once and for all by Laurence.\n\n\"What are you carrying?\" he asked Frida, when they were gathered in the hall before starting.\n\n\"Uncle John's present,\" she replied.\n\n\"Do not bother. Uncle John has invited us to stay here, and you do not want to expose your little animals to the risk of being chipped. No doubt Harold will look after them for you in the interim—the short interim. Come, Edith, the moon is not going to wait for us, you know. I have the reins. Gee-up, Primrose!\"\n\n\"Fond as I am of Edith,\" Hilda said, when the vicarage family was out of hearing. \"Fond as I am of Edith,\" she repeated without any trace of affection in accent or expression, \"I do think this invasion is an imposition upon your kindness. But clergymen are all alike; they all become dictatorial and obtuse; they're too fond of the sound of their own voices.\"\n\n\"Laurence is perhaps a little heavy,\" John agreed, \"a little suave and heavy like a cornflour shape, but we ought to do what we can for Edith.\"\n\nHe tactfully offered Hilda a share in his own benevolence, in which she ensconced herself without hesitation.\n\n\"Well, I suppose we shall have to make the best of it. Indeed the only thing that really worries me is what we are to do with the apples.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harold will soon eat them up,\" said John; though he had not the slightest intention of being sarcastic, Hilda was so much annoyed by this that she abandoned all discussion of the vicarage and talked so long about Harold's inside and with such a passionate insistence upon what he required of sweet and sour to prevent him from dropping before her very eyes, that John was able"
