        "text": "FACING increased labor costs, inflation, and less customer demand, stores across the country are closing their doors.\n\nAfter 35 years in business, a popular grocery chain stunned shoppers after revealing it would be closing down one of its stores by the end of the month.\n\nOn July 31, Brookshire Brothers revealed it would be shuttering its doors in Vidor, a small city in Southeast Texas.\n\nAlong with the grocery store closure, the company is also shutting down the chain's gas station and Tobacco Barn on August 24.\n\nThe chain's pharmacy will close on August 23.\n\nBrookshire Brothers' president and CEO John Alston did release a statement confirming the news.\n\n“Brookshire Brothers wants to extend our deepest appreciation to our loyal customers and dedicated staff who have supported us throughout the years,” Alston said.\n\n1813 News founder Kevin Steele broke the story on his Facebook page.\n\n“We hope to continue those relationships in our surrounding southeast Texas stores,” Alston said, referencing the company's nearby locations.\n\n“We are assisting our employee-owners during this transition,” Alston continued.\n\nBrookshire Brothers is an employee-owned supermarket chain, with headquarters in Lufkin, Texas.\n\nThe company was founded by brothers Austin and Tom Brookshire in 1921.\n\nThe private corporation is wholly owned and operated by its 5,600+ employees.\n\n“We are incredibly grateful for their hard work and dedication, and they have all been offered positions within the company.”\n\nSteele also reported that any customers in need of prescription refills or medication transfers after the Vidor pharmacy closes \"should call the Lumberton pharmacy at 409-227-2004.\"\n\nPrescriptions files are currently being transferred to the Brookshire Brothers Pharmacy in Lumberton, Texas, located at 421 S. Main Street.\n\nThe Lumberton location is about 20 miles northwest of the closing Vidor store.\n\n\"They just can't compete with the large chains,\" one of Steele's Facebook followers commented.\n\n\"It was just a matter of time. We all knew it was gunna happen,\" another user wrote.\n\n\"I really hate to hear this,\" one follower wrote, a statement echoed by dozens of others in Steele's comment sections.\n\n\"They lost a good portion of customers to Walmart and K-Dans was the final nail in the coffin,\" another user shared.\n\n\"On one side (Walmart) you have better prices, on the other (K-Dans) you have better quality,\" they added.\n\nK-Dan's Super Foods, a family-owned supermarket, opened a store earlier this year less than a mile north of Brookshire Brothers' Vidor location.\n\n\"I'm surprised it didn't happen before now, being in Walmart's front yard,\" another follower commented.\n\nVidor's Walmart Supercenter opened its doors in March 2018, right next door to Brookshire Brothers.\n\nNo reason was given for the abrupt closure, though the store's lease does expire at the end of August.\n\nThe property is owned by SPP Sunwest Portfolio, LLC, according to the Orange County Appraisal District, and has a current taxable value of $842,507, as reported by Fox affiliate KBTV Fox SETX.\n\nIt is unclear what SPP Sunwest Portfolio, LLC, plans to do with the location, or what will happen to current employees at the grocery store, pharmacy, fueling station, and tobacco store."
