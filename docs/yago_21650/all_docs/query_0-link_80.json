        "text": "The granddaddy of all self-congratulatory entertainment awards shows, the Academy Awards celebrates the best in film from any given year. As the silent era started to wind down (although he didn’t know it yet), movie mogul Louis B. Mayer organized the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) in 1927 to put on the Oscars, as they came to be known. Mayer has been cited as saying that he created the awards in order to manipulate actors, directors, producers, technicians, and writers, whose disciplines were united under the auspices of the Academy Awards. It worked, and still does.\n\nThe manipulation even works on a grander scale for a certain portion of the public. I’m part of that portion! I simultaneously unironically and ironically love awards shows, and the Oscars essentially stands as the premiere event. It set the template for the glamour, the politicization, people arguing about what should have won, people arguing about the necessity of congratulating already rich people, people…arguing. In a lot of ways, I agree with those who disdain awards shows. As someone who loves ranking things and lists and works of art assigned to neat little arbitrary boxes, I love them, though. I balance these dueling emotions by trying to view awards shows as indicators of what a particular industry thought about their peers in any given year, for good or bad. In this way, I think awards shows, and the Academy Awards in particular, can provide some interesting context and valuable insight into an art form’s history. I should maybe mention I also took a whole class about the Oscars in college.\n\n“Academy Awards Assessed” is a companion series to “Emmys Evaluated” and “Grammys Graded,” and as with those series, I’ll be providing my thoughts on how things should have gone within the framework of the historical record. What I mean is that I’ll be ranking, and providing revisionist history for, what AMPAS nominated for its 1929 ceremony, not just generally giving my favorite films in each category for the years in question. This means certain movies are left out of the conversation, as they were 90 years ago. That’s why I write other stuff, though. Using this framework, I’ll rank the quality of the nominees in each category in the order they are listed in, bolding my choice at the top and marking the actual winner with a *. Some films I couldn’t track down and watch, and I’ll mark those with a ~.\n\nBut first, some context for the ceremony itself! The 1st Academy Awards was held on May 16, 1929 at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel and honored the best in film released from August 1, 1927 to August 1, 1928. This biannual approach was used for the first few ceremonies, causing some retroactive confusion; for example, there’s no “Best Picture” winner from 1928 since WINGS (1927) was this year’s winner and THE BROADWAY MELODY (1929) won at the second annual event. The first, though, was the only Oscars ceremony not broadcast on radio or television. MGM art director Cedric Gibbons designed the now iconic Oscars statuette. The first AMPAS president was also the Awards’ first host. Star Douglas Fairbanks presided over a 15-minute presentation in which awards were bestowed to winners who were already announced in February. Presumably everyone just hung out and ate and (covertly) drank afterward. 270 people attended the event, and tickets were $5 for guests of Academy members (about $72 today). Mayer created the awards categories, and nominees could be named for multiple projects or not any specific one at all. As opposed to the process that would go into effect later, in which members of each discipline were polled, an “Academy Central Board of Judges” decided winners from the group of nominees. Director King Vidor would later say it was actually just the AMPAS founders (Mayer, power couple Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, Sid Grauman, and Joseph Schenk) who decided things, which would lead to some controversy in the following years and retrospectively.\n\nSpeaking of “controversy,” the 1st Academy Awards was also the first ceremony that people took issue with on the grounds of what won/what was nominated. Go figure. For example, Charlie Chaplin “only” won an “honorary award” “for versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing and producing THE CIRCUS (1928).” I should mention THE CIRCUS is my favorite film of 1928. The second special award was given to Warner Bros. “for producing THE JAZZ SINGER (1927), the pioneer outstanding talking picture, which has revolutionized the industry.” Now, I don’t really think THE JAZZ SINGER should have taken home a bunch of awards, but it is noteworthy that the 1st Academy Awards was the only predominantly silent ceremony that would ever be put on. Held in May 1929, it was recognizing films from essentially two years ago, which was a lifetime ago with the sudden changes rippling through the American film industry by then.\n\nThere’s also a bit of fun with the nature of the categories, which I’ll note as I go through them. But I would like to lead with an inconsistency with the two major awards of the night: Outstanding Picture and Best Unique and Artistic Picture. These were meant to address different aspects of excellence in film; WINGS (1927) won the former and SUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS (1927) won the latter. Retroactively, however, the Academy determined that Outstanding Picture was the earliest equivalent to the now-coveted Best Picture category, enshrining WINGS as the first winner of the top prize. Many people (including myself) consider SUNRISE the superior film, so this decision also enshrined the decades-long debates over what should have won at the Oscars.\n\nOK! I think that’s all the preliminary information. Before I delve into the 12 categories, I’ll note that in actual historical fact 7TH HEAVEN (1927) received the most nominations (five), and it and SUNRISE tied for the most awards won (three). Let’s see how well my opinions line up with the Academy of 1929’s judgement!\n\nOutstanding Picture\n\n7TH HEAVEN (1927)\n\nTHE RACKET (1928)\n\nWINGS (1927)*\n\nAs previously mentioned, Outstanding Picture is essentially the precursor to the Best Picture category. And, you guessed it, its nominees are supposed to just be…the most outstanding. The best. By that criteria, the winner, WINGS, does not measure up. William Wellman’s World War I aviation picture broke a lot of ground, features some eye-popping cinematography and visual effects, and carries a fairly compelling story. But it feels staid today, and too conventional. THE RACKET (I may have some recency bias here since I watched it the day before the time of this writing) is a lively, elevated piece of popular entertainment that is entertaining all the way through its 83-minute run time. It’s a different experience than WINGS’ 144 minutes, for sure. But Frank Borzage’s 7TH HEAVEN, rightfully revered even outside of the context of the Oscars, is the most incredible of the three nominees. A tasteful romance/drama film, 7TH HEAVEN stars Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell, a pairing wisely exploited after the success of this film. Its touching nature is a little more uneven compared to SUNRISE (which also starred Gaynor), but the exaggerated, almost Expressionistic architecture of its World War I-era France is a perfect playground for the development of classic Hollywood-style filmmaking.\n\nBest Unique and Artistic Picture\n\nSUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS (1927)*\n\nTHE CROWD (1928)\n\nCHANG: A DRAMA OF THE WILDERNESS (1927)\n\nApparently meant to reflect more “intimate” or “arthouse” films as we might call them now, the Best Unique and Artistic Picture category harbored the actual best American film of 1927: SUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS. CHANG: A DRAMA OF THE WILDERNESS is an interesting ethnographic drama from Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, the directors of the documentary GRASS (1925) and KING KONG (1933). Its narrative was crafted using real residents of northern Thailand, but it reflects some of the uncomfortable exoticism of the day and ultimately drifts away from cohesion. King Vidor’s THE CROWD, revered to this day, impressed me less than I thought it would, though its tale of a flawed man obsessed with being “someone” and his long-suffering wife is rendered with stunning visual acuity. But if you want to talk about a beautiful film featuring a bizarre, yet ultimately human and sentimental husband-and-wife relationship, just watch SUNRISE. Director F.W. Murnau, screenwriter Carl Mayer, cinematographers Charles Rosher and Karl Struss, and stars Janet Gaynor and George O’Brien turn a story about a man reconciling with his wife after cheating on her and resolving to murder her, somehow, into a touching tale. Gaynor is absolute perfection here, cementing her place as my favorite silent actress (and ranked highly, perhaps, beyond). O’Brien is rarely as strongly…emotional, in any context, as he is in SUNRISE. The set design is ethereal. The swamp! The fair! Every shot. The character names (The Man, The Wife). These things establish SUNRISE as a classic fable, a story with a mythical and humane emotional through line; and as a classic film, rendered in such stunning yet artificial detail so as to describe the world-creating potential of film and foretell that potential’s fulfillment as we know it in the classical Hollywood era of the 1930s.\n\nBest Director, Comedy Picture\n\nTed Wilde — SPEEDY (1928)\n\nLewis Milestone — TWO ARABIAN KNIGHTS (1927)*\n\nThe 1st Academy Awards was the only time that Best Director was distinguished between comedy and drama. With only two nominations to pick from on the comedy side, it’s not hard to single out the Harold Lloyd film SPEEDY over TWO ARABIAN KNIGHTS, the latter being a middling comedy with some uncomfortable racism/misogyny. Even still, SPEEDY is more effectively directed. As befits its title, the movie moves along at an entertaining clip, and by now, Lloyd’s collaborators were old hat at using camera tricks and complex set ups to accommodate his gags. The final chase scene in SPEEDY is its shining moment.\n\nBest Director, Dramatic Picture\n\nFrank Borzage — 7TH HEAVEN (1927)*\n\nKing Vidor — THE CROWD (1928)\n\nHerbert Brenon — SORRELL AND SON (1927)~\n\nSORRELL AND SON, a film previously thought lost but restored by the Academy in 2005, isn’t readily available…anywhere I could find, really. So unfortunately, I was unable to watch it. But as things go between THE CROWD and 7TH HEAVEN: these two late silent critical darlings both tell compelling stories. But the edge on directing has to go to Frank Borzage, whose male protagonist is rendered more sympathetically than King Vidor’s, whether by some combination of actual acting direction, camera angles, or writing. 7TH HEAVEN’s emotional build is more consistent, and the aforementioned mise en scène pulls everything into a distinct, dark, and magical, yet recognizable, world. I love Borzage and Vidor, but the former had an almost supernatural and ahead-of-his-time sensitivity most prominently on display, well…in STREET ANGEL (1928), but 7TH HEAVEN comes real close.\n\nBest Actor\n\nEmil Jannings — THE LAST COMMAND (1928) and THE WAY OF ALL FLESH (1927)~*\n\nRichard Barthelmess — THE NOOSE (1928)~ and THE PATENT LEATHER KID (1927)\n\nOur first example of a category for which nominees were nominated for multiple projects! Emil Jannings almost won by default when I couldn’t track down THE NOOSE, which resides in an archive somewhere, or THE PATENT LEATHER KID, which has apparently been broadcast once or twice. But the latter eventually showed up on the internet during my research. Richard Barthelmess is fine in THE PATENT LEATHER KID, an underwhelming drama about a selfish boxer sent to fight in World War I, but THE LAST COMMAND is a 1928 favorite, for various reasons (THE WAY OF ALL FLESH is a lost film). The main reason, though, is Jannings himself. Josef von Sternberg’s film is a character study of a potentially repulsive, despotic man brought low by the cutthroat world of Hollywood. Jannings’ Grand Duke Sergius Alexander was the Czar of Russia’s cousin and commanded forces during the Revolution. But when he had to flee Russia through a humbling series of events, he showed up in Hollywood to work as an extra. There, he was just another old man with an annoying tic: he couldn’t stop nodding and shaking his head. Jannings plays the character with pompous ferocity and then great sadness and confusion, far outpacing Barthelmess’ titular character’s humbling.\n\nBest Actress\n\nJanet Gaynor — 7TH HEAVEN (1927), STREET ANGEL (1928), and SUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS (1927)*\n\nGloria Swanson — SADIE THOMPSON (1928)\n\nLouise Dresser — A SHIP COMES IN (1928)\n\nLook, I mentioned earlier that Janet Gaynor is probably one of my favorite actresses of all time. She was going to win this in my eyes anyways, let alone for 7TH HEAVEN, STREET ANGEL, and SUNRISE, three masterpieces. STREET ANGEL, a follow up directed by Borzage, is modeled very closely after 7TH HEAVEN, and paired Gaynor and Charles Farrell again. I actually think it’s the better film, which may be an unpopular opinion. Regardless, Gaynor is incredible in both. But she is transcendent in SUNRISE, the most sympathetic of characters. Gaynor’s “The Wife” is the main character of SUNRISE, not George O’Brien’s “The Man.” Her role, as in all three nominated films, may be seen as damsel-in-distress-y. But as mentioned earlier, a combination of factors can render plots that may seem “problematic” on paper into stories of sensitivity and grace, which is the case for all three of Gaynor’s films. As for the other nominees: I was only able to watch A SHIP COMES IN in pretty terrible condition. It’s an immigrant story that touches on similar themes to a portion of John Ford’s FOUR SONS, a 1928 favorite of mine that is a goldmine of progressivism and a sharp, defined visual style. But A SHIP COMES IN ultimately morphs the tale into one of assimilation, rather than proud collaboration. That aside, Louise Dresser does her part of the immigrant mother dutifully, but she also can’t compete with Gloria Swanson’s titular character in SADIE THOMPSON. Swanson affects the bulk of the appeal of her relationship with Raoul Walsh’s soldier character. Honestly, the performance is brought low by a turn in the story, which brings Sadie to a subservient position. That’s not where the character, or Swanson, thrives, and it also happens to be the point in the story that the film’s pace slows. Swanson’s confident swagger as Sadie Thompson is great, but regardless, I can’t put anyone from 1927 and ’28 above Gaynor, even outside who was nominated. What an incredible run of three films!\n\nBest Original Story\n\nTHE LAST COMMAND (1928) — Lajos Bíró\n\nUNDERWORLD (1927) — Ben Hecht*\n\nThe predecessor to the Best Original Screenplay category, Best Original Story just essentially addresses stories written specifically for the screen, as opposed to adapted stories (we’ll get to that in a second). UNDERWORLD, Josef von Sternberg’s breakout film, is an interesting gangster film that preceded the 1930s genre craze. But decorated screenwriter Ben Hecht’s tale of a kingpin, his new associate, and the gangster’s moll never quite gelled into something resonant for me. George Bancroft’s “Bull” Weed is just a touch too unsympathetic (as opposed to Bancroft’s Bill Roberts in Sternberg’s THE DOCKS OF NEW YORK [1928], who is at a better level of forceful). And Clive Brook’s “Rolls Royce” Wensel loses a lot of his charm when he gets cleaned up from alcoholism. It’s a fine film, but when compared to Lajos Bíró’s novel concept revolving around the Russian Revolution, its characters cannot compete with the definition of Emil Jannings’ Grand Duke Sergius Alexander. Director von Sternberg also co-wrote THE LAST COMMAND, but regardless of who came up with what, the portrait of Alexander and the amorphous commentary (or lack thereof) on the Russian Revolution provides a groundbreaking story steeped in gray. UNDERWORLD was lauded for similar reasons, but frankly, it’s not as daring.\n\nBest Adaptation\n\n7TH HEAVEN (1927) — Benjamin Glazer*\n\nTHE JAZZ SINGER (1927) — Alfred A. Cohn\n\nGLORIOUS BETSY (1928) — Anthony Coldeway\n\nJust as Best Original Story was the predecessor to Best Original Screenplay, so too is Best Adaptation the progenitor of Best Adapted Screenplay. But the criteria of “Best Adaptation” is a bit more nuanced: is it awarded to the film most faithful to the source material, whether in matters of plot, spirit, or tone? Or is it just the best story/screenplay that happens to be based on a different work? I think it’s a combination of both, but since I’m not familiar with the source material of these three nominees (all plays), I think I’ll have to lean harder into the latter concept. By that token, GLORIOUS BETSY, a mediocre historical drama about Napoleon’s brother Jerome and his American wife, is not arousing. THE JAZZ SINGER’s central conceit, of a Jewish boy who leaves his traditional home to pursue a career in show business, has a lot of potential. Al Jolson’s Jack Robin could be seen as a sympathetic character; his relationship with his parents is touching. But then there’s, ya know, the whole blackface thing. It’s still more interesting than GLORIOUS BETSY. But of course, 7TH HEAVEN’s tale of a poor prostitute saved by a sewer worker is full of emotional resonance, as has been described earlier. The story’s greatest failing is the characterization of Farrell’s Chico; he’s a bit too mean and verbally abusive at first. But again, it stands as a testament to the structure of the script and Borzage’s deft direction that 7TH HEAVEN becomes a heartwarming, dramatic story.\n\nBest Art Direction\n\nSUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS (1927) — Rochus Gliese\n\n7TH HEAVEN (1927) — Harry Oliver\n\nTHE DOVE (1927)~ and TEMPEST (1928) — William Cameron Menzies*\n\nWilliam Cameron Menzies, probably the preeminent production designer of the silent era and beyond, won the first award for Best Art Direction for his work on THE DOVE and TEMPEST. Although he would later earn acclaim for big-name projects like GONE WITH THE WIND (1939), Menzies’ design was clearly outclassed by 7TH HEAVEN and SUNRISE. THE DOVE only partially survives, and I wasn’t able to track it down. But TEMPEST, a pretty good John Barrymore film set in the Russian Revolution, I watched in its entirety. Its sets and mise en scène are nice, but as mentioned earlier, 7TH HEAVEN’s Expressionism-influenced world is beautifully exaggerated. And as one of the very creators of German Expressionism, F.W. Murnau’s American debut carries that energy…and frequent collaborator Rochus Gliese. SUNRISE’s swamp and fair are the prime examples of how intricately designed the film is. I’ve alluded to this somewhat, but I want to make clear: both SUNRISE and 7TH HEAVEN are two of the first crystal-clear exhibits of the classic Hollywood filmmaking artifice and set design that we associate with the 1930s.\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nSUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS (1927) — Charles Rosher and Karl Struss*\n\nSADIE THOMPSON (1928) — George Barnes\n\nTHE DEVIL DANCER (1927) — George Barnes~\n\nTHE MAGIC FLAME (1927) — George Barnes~\n\nAnd SUNRISE and 7TH HEAVEN did the same for cinematography. But SUNRISE was actually nominated, and knocks out all three (!) of the George Barnes-shot films with which it competed. Americans Charles Rosher and Karl Struss were able to emulate the Karl Freund-fueled vision of Murnau within a Hollywood framework perfectly. I’ve said many times how beautiful SUNRISE is. But SADIE THOMPSON is also impressively shot. As you might be able to tell, Barnes was fairly celebrated and incredibly prolific. THE DEVIL DANCER and THE MAGIC FLAME are both lost, but although he couldn’t give SUNRISE a run for its money, Barnes’ work on SADIE THOMPSON is admirable.\n\nBest Engineering Effects\n\nWINGS (1927) — Roy Pomeroy*\n\nN/A — Nugent Slaughter\n\nN/A — Ralph Hammeras\n\nThis defunct category is some variation on the visual and sound effects theme, as can be understood for what was possible 90 years ago. By that standard, WINGS takes the cake, especially since you don’t really know what it was up against. Its innovations with aviation photography and its blending of the real and the fake are certainly what warranted this nomination and win. Nugent Slaughter did visual effects and sound mixing for THE JAZZ SINGER (1927), which is likely what he was nominated for here. The film’s integration of sound is obviously important, impressive, and interesting, but from today’s perspective, Roy Pomeroy’s accomplishments on WINGS holds up better. Ralph Hammeras worked on THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HELEN OF TROY (1927), which I was unable to watch; about half an hour of the film survives in the archives of BFI.\n\nBest Title Writing\n\nN/A — George Marion Jr.\n\nN/A — Joseph W. Farnham*\n\nTHE PRIVATE LIFE OF HELEN OF TROY (1927) — Gerald Duffy~\n\nBest Title Writing is the most obviously outdated category from the first event. “Title” refers to intertitles, which provided exposition and dialogue in between scenes during the silent era. When sound came around, they weren’t needed any more, obviously. The craft of writing intertitles was actually pretty cool, since they totally set the tone of characters and events because you can’t hear anything. Gerald Duffy was the first posthumous nomination in Academy Awards history. It happened at the first Awards, but still. As mentioned earlier, I couldn’t watch THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HELEN OF TROY, so I have no idea how Duffy did. Joseph W. Farnham wasn’t nominated for any specific film, but from what I can gather, the notable films released from August 1927 to August 1928 that he wrote for were LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT (1927, a lost Tod Browning film), THE TRAIL OF ’98 (1928), and LAUGH, CLOWN, LAUGH (1928). I haven’t watched any of them, so I can’t accurately evaluate Farnham’s work. But since I don’t know what movies he was supposed to be nominated for, I didn’t single any one out. George Marion Jr., on the other hand, worked on UNDERWORLD (1927) and TWO ARABIAN KNIGHTS (1927) within the release window. Since they were already nominated above, I figure these were the films being referenced for Marion’s nomination. And I don’t know how much I specifically enjoyed the intertitles, but they serviced the pretty good UNDERWORLD and fine TWO ARABIAN KNIGHTS. So he wins!"
