        "text": "Ruby Gentry is a warped, sweaty melodrama set in coastal North Carolina, a tale of class division, desire, and a woman who dares to defy every convention, less on principle than because of a ferocious belief in herself.\n\nIf the movie had a lower budget and less prestige, it could easily have become a hicksploitation flick, with a Jennifer Jones lookalike as the horny country girl who keeps all the men on a string, forcing them to craw for her in exchange for a little taste of all she has to offer. But, since it was directed by King Vidor for his own production company (and distributed by Twentieth Century-Fox), it has Jennifer Jones herself in the lead role, with…\n\n\"Yes....Ruby Gentry was born on the wrong side of the tracks. And the people of Braddock never let her forget it.\"\n\nThe most concentrated of Vidor's films by far, so of course it's like there are almost too many dynamics going on.... \"Jim, what is love?\" for example - the equal parts simplicity and complexity turning the question into both genuine metaphysical inquiry and sudden human respite from all these other dynamics at once. But there is really a lot here, this viewing I really felt it could possibly be Vidor's best film (immediately challenged by my first viewing of Truth and Illusion) class warfare and sexual warfare posited as heteropatriarchal and then reversed into sexual domination and class domination - all the while challenged by a fundamentalism which reveals the nature of fundamentalism as incestuous - does this even make sense?\n\neverything i love in a southern gothic melodrama: one man with a name that sounds like a typo (boake????), swamps, regionally questionable accents, people clutching each other\n\nfor once i actually liked a jennifer jones film (i’ve only seen a few ok shh don’t bite me)!! but charlton heston’s part should have gone to one of the actors’ studio hotties (this is a young brando part if i’ve ever seen one! heston is so bland and why does he sound like he’s doing a clark gable impression in this movie) and i could do without the voiceover that benignly explains all the symbolism and character motivations.\n\nI was pretty skeptical when my friend told me a while back that he saw Jennifer Jones as an actor auteur but after seeing this and Duel in the Sun I'm inclined to agree. Vidor's depictions of human relationships are usually tender and gentle, even in his \"big\" movies, but Jones storms in and turns Ruby Gentry into lust-filled, screaming melodrama. That tone didn't work for me in Duel but it's so perfect here, with exactly the amount of insanity that threatens to overwhelm the narrative completely at every turn, but never quite does... until the ending!\n\nApril 2023: Director of the Month - King Vidor\n\nA trashy melodrama by Vidor set in a backwater Southern town about a girl from the other side of the tracks who's sexy and she knows it. But once she marries an older wealthy widower, the respectable people in town turn on her and she takes her revenge on them. The plot's farfetched to begin with but it really cranks it up in the last half hour. It has its moments but doesn't really hold together, except perhaps as a guilty pleasure. Which explains bumping my rating up a 1/2 star.\n\nPart of the problem is that the character of Ruby (played by Jennifer Jones) is mass of contradictions. One the…\n\nSultry, southern melodrama that could have added some sweat and luridness. Any group, institution, etc. that attempts to control the status quo can only cause destruction. There are moments of visual flare that we all know Vidor is capable of. These moments seemed to be mostly crammed into the last 20 minutes. Jones isn’t quite right for the part, but most of this film feels slightly miscalculated.\n\nI don't have much to say about this film except it's perfect, like Minnelli's HOME FROM THE HILL. And like Vidor et al's own DUEL IN THE SUN or Preminger's DAISY KENYON it exposes the masculine jealousy that shifts to call-to-arms when a \"bobcat-wildcat\" plays the testosterone of an alpha off that of a beta. No-one survives except the woman.\n\nMoullet on DUEL IN THE SUN and RUBY GENTRY:\n\nmubi.com/notebook/posts/the-bravura-sequence"
