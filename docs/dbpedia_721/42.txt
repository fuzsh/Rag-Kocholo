That is not a bug. If you have a reference to the a Sprite object somewhere else than in a Group, then the object stays still a live (of course), even if you kill it. kill does not destroy the object, it just removes the object fora all Groups.

That causes the object is not updated through the pygame.sprite.Group.update() mechanism and all its attributes stay untouched.

If a Sprite is not part of a Group then you have to update the object yourself. No one will change the attributes magically and of course the "hitbox stays"

A solution would be to override the kill method and to reset some attributes (like the hit box) in the derived class:
