Introduction

The MojuBox is a 3D printed controller that you can order preassembled or print yourself. It can fit most printers, so if your print bed is 210 mm x 210 mm, you are good to go!

Performance

The MojuBox is compatible with the best parts. Designed using SOLIDWORKS, this is a modular controller, so you can pick between a Japanese joystick, Korean joystick, original hitbox, and/or hitbox layout. The joystick is supposed to be the Sanwa JLF.

The original hitbox layout has 24 mm directional buttons, except for the 30 mm jump button. The hitbox layout has all 30 mm buttons. The WASD layouts can be all 24 mm or all 30 mm. The 24 mm option can have an extra 30 mm jump button. You can even opt for a Smash layout:

When it comes to the attack buttons, they can be 30 mm Vewlix, 30 mm Noir, or 30 mm hitbox, the latter of which has its first and fourth columns of buttons lower than the two middle columns.

The secondary buttons can be five 16 mm buttons or seven 12 mm buttons. 12 mm buttons may require soldering because some do not have screw-on terminals.

The USB-C port was placed on the top of the MojuBox for safer placement. Also, a screen slot was added for 0.96″ OLED powered by the TheTrainGoes Pico Advanced Breakout Board.

The holes of the MojuBox were positioned to maximize the wrist resting space. Lowering the joystick’s hole position would have caused fitment issues since the MojuBox was designed to be as low profile as possible while giving the panels a slight slope, so the MojuBox gets lower toward the front. There is a 2.5° tilt.

Hardware

Here are the materials needed to put together this controller:

Filament

Flathead countersunk M3 x 20 mm screws (16 pieces)

M3 x 5 mm x 5 mm heat-set inserts (16 pieces)

Sanwa JLF joystick (optional)

Sanwa or other low-profile buttons

Six foot 90° straight USB to USB-C cable

USB to USB-C adapter

PCB

Vinyl wrap (optional)

Super glue

Double-sided tape

Non-slip pads

3D printer

Screwdriver

Soldering iron

Pliers (optional)

If you pick the Japanese joystick layout, you would need four flathead countersunk #10-24 x 1″ screws, and you would also need eight #10 nuts.

Here are some recommendations for the parts:

USB to USB-C adapter

16 mm buttons

12 mm buttons

12 mm buttons (no soldering)

Appearance

The texture of the MojuBox is smooth, but the cherry on top when it comes to the MojuBox is the art engravement that probably caught your eye.

The engravement is done through ZBrush using the alpha-to-mesh feature and can probably be customized to your taste if you order a preassembled MojuBox.

Conclusion

The MojuBox is a dream for those wanting a modular controller to play fighting games or even other genres.
