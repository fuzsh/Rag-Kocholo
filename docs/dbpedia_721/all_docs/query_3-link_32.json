I agree, for paying 75$ more shouldnt really have to drill a hole in my new product to use a headset :/\n\nnow my question is --\n\ndoes the ps360+ wire the same/is the same size as the ps360 pcb? because the one currently in there is the old one (ps360) and i just bought the new model.\n\nlol this is what's already in the hitbox dude just no way to get to it. I agree, for paying 75$ more shouldnt really have to drill a hole in my new product to use a headset :/\n\nThis connects to the board inside and you can either mod your case by cutting/drilling or have it external going out the hole with the USB. For 8 bucks, i'm going the external route and tapping it to the side.\n\nnow my question is --\n\ndoes the ps360+ wire the same/is the same size as the ps360 pcb? because the one currently in there is the old one (ps360) and i just bought the new model.\n\nI'm not sure man, shoot them an email they respond pretty quickly. I've dropped mine before but flat on its back, never on the sides so my has held up pretty well.\n\nThey both use USB A (printer cable) to connect to the PCB. The RJ-45 port on the PS360+ might get in the way when you install it though.\n\nthats the port for other systems right?\n\nnot worried about that/have no interest in it. I'll probably end up trying to install the pcb further inside the case, permanently putting the printercable wire in the pcb and knotting up the wire in front of the open hole in the to prevent this kind of accident from occuring again (i read that knotting the wire will absorb shock, making a fall of this type not break the pcb)\n\nwhaddaya think?\n\nI'm not sure man, shoot them an email they respond pretty quickly. I've dropped mine before but flat on its back, never on the sides so my has held up pretty well.\n\ni bought it already but it looks like il be able to wire it myself following a diagram. pretty simple stuff, just put wires in the right spots and screw them down, no soldering. if i cant figure it out il just bring it to gamers edge but i dont think it will be a problem.\n\nthats the port for other systems right?\n\nnot worried about that/have no interest in it.

You'll also have updated SOCD controls with the new board, so you'll be in ship shape.\n\nRapZiLLa54 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is amazing!\n\nEDIT: Happy Birthday from Team Hit Box!\n\nSounds good! You'll also have updated SOCD controls with the new board, so you'll be in ship shape.\n\nshit, i wasnt even thinking of that SOCD firmware update (thats the patch making it so left and right dont register together, or something right). The new p360+ has the socd firmware preinstalled?\n\nis my hitbox going to be bannable because i can block both ways?\n\nshit, i wasnt even thinking of that SOCD firmware update (thats the patch making it so left and right dont register together, or something right). The new p360+ has the socd firmware preinstalled?\n\nis my hitbox going to be bannable because i can block both ways?\n\nYou can't block both ways, since the developers take measures against that. Otherwise, what's stopping you from using a standard 360 / PS3 pad, holding left on the D-Pad, and right on the analogue stick? That's the same thing as holding left + right on hitbox.\n\nIn most games, holding left + right gives you neutral.\n\nshit, i wasnt even thinking of that SOCD firmware update (thats the patch making it so left and right dont register together, or something right). The new p360+ has the socd firmware preinstalled?\n\nis my hitbox going to be bannable because i can block both ways?\n\nPS360+ is firmware SOCD controlled, so L+R=N and D+U=Up. Your HB isn't bannable either way anyways. That was just a vanilla MvC3 glitch. We chose L+R = Neutral for all the broken fun stuff in Tekken and Street Fighter, and I'm sure there's still amazing tech for Injustice to be found.\n\nthe most important 'tech' for me is how consistent you can make iafbs.\n\nI also really like how doing kabal pressure in MK is basically just memorizing different drum rhythm patterns\n\nwhen i get mine fixed up il start trying to play sfxt/sf4 on it and continue learning guilty gear\n\nGG seems to be a pretty good fit for it with practice (very low superjump instant air dashes)\n\nYay it only took me like 3 hours to clip those wires (those screws on the old pcb would NOT budge), restrip them, and figure out how to wire the new pcb. It's kinds dangling around tho since the new model doesn't fit the old mounting plate but idc, it works perfectly.\n\nIdk why I have an extra wire though. There was a random wire coming out of the select button that when plugged into one of the extra ground terminals or something would make stuff fuck up..i dunno what it's supposed to be for. I just tied it off\n\nAnyone had any luck with instant air fireballs with Zod? iazb's, it seems there isn't a way to to tiger knee motion it :/ and my consistency is crap, even more so for short grounded toons like cat woman.\n\nyea i was doing them super consistently day 1. you just gotta hit udb really, really fast. My wrist actually hurt after about 10 minutes of doing it and I stopped lol. instant air zod charges on hitbox are amazing\n\nyea i was doing them super consistently day 1. you just gotta hit udb really, really fast.

I am having real trouble with the Zod balls not coming out at all, or just pixels above most toons heads.\n\nyea i was doing them super consistently day 1. you just gotta hit udb really, really fast.
