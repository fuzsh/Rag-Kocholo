        "text": "Here's some stuff that happened to me:\n\n1. A reaper Leviathan grabbed me in the prawn suit at the crash zone, threw me through the floor, ended up falling through the map for like a minutes, until landed inside the big lava chamber with the sea dragon, had to walk all the way back, good thing the suit survived and had enough power.\n\n2. Exited the cyclops with the seamoth, realized after half a second that I forgot to empty the storage, went back up, docket without the animation and got stuck forever in the seamoth inside the cyclops, had to use console to kill myself, since teleport commands kept spawning me in the locations with the same animation of the seamoth and cyclops, without the possibility to move or open the PDA.\n\n3. Base flooded for no reason, one hole was in a multipurpose room that has all of its walls reinforced, after fixing the hole (that somehow wend from 0% to no being there in a slip second, the water started to go down, but any room with a bulkhead, was still flooded, you could walk in the corridor, and once you went through the bulkhead, you were submerged, it took half an hour for the damn thing to drain.\n\n4. Just like in your case, had a Leviathan miss me and dive into the sand, where it got stuck under the map.\n\n5. Schools of fish swimming through the base, clipping through walls.\n\n6. Creatures in the alien containment swimming in the room surrounding it, basically flying through the air.\n\n7. Building a large base kills animations like bulkhead and hatch openings, using the moonpool in a large base will teleport you into the wall if you try to use the ladder.\n\n8. Can't access the prawn suit upgrades in the moonpool as well, have to detach it to do anything, including opening the inventory on it.\n\n9. Seamoth is basically a ghost in the moonpool, you just fall right through.\n\n10. For some reason when I get out of the seamoth under water, the upper hatch remains wide open, though when coming back in, you get a hatch opening animation.\n\n11. Since there is no draw distance slider in the menu, when traveling with the seamoth, I have stuff just casually loading in front of me, taking its time, especially in the mushroom forest.\n\n12. General frame rate issues inside large bases.\n\n13. Energy source extenders are basically a wild card at this point, sometimes they just don't want to work at any range, and some times they make a connection over hundreds of meters.\n\n14. In creative mode, tried building bases, most of the time even with power and everything seemingly functioning, the base remains dark and lights won't come on, like it's flooded when it's not.\n\n15. sometimes when building through the surface of the water, you will have the water surface clip through the walls and enter the base.\n\nMy suggestion to the scanner room: Don't make it detect creature eggs in the alien containment, it's just cluttering the screen.\n\nSuggestion to the Cyclops sonar: if it has a radar on the left that detects aggressive fauna, then it should just work with the sonar upgrade as well and give you an image of your surroundings at least every time you use the sonar, instead of the seamoth style sonar that we have now.\n\nHabitat suggestion: Have some more combustibility, more playable items\n\nOverall, they might have finally added the ending, but the game sure as hell isn't finished."
