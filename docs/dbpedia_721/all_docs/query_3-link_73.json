        "text": "Does anyone have experience using pushbutton silencers? Particulrly 24mm? Do they effect button sensitivity? Do they take away the clickity click?\n\nThanks!\n\nSilencers change the travel distance and \"feel\" of the Sanwas. It would feel like a completely different button. I had it on one of my sticks and reverted back to the original feel. If you're ok with the feel of a totally different button, try gamerfingers instead. Gamerfingers are quite silent and expensive ( 6 bucks a piece vs 2 bucks and change for a sanwa). But, they have a very high MTBF, a.k.a, you wouldn't be replacing them as often as sanwas (price may be justified). They make your fingers feel less sore if you're a hard user.\n\nIf your wife's not tired of the Sanwa clicks and not waiting to smack you on the head with a frying pan yet, don't worry about adding silencers and stick with the original sanwas. Otherwise, gamerfingers would appear a more robust solution.\n\nNot frothing, trying to keep my dude from buying them and regretting it like i did.\n\nAside from missing the click of the button... I think the gf's are slightly bigger as i've had to fight them into holes that sanwas fit in. I also dont like how theyre built. It was easy to apply too much pressure to the .110 contacts when installing, causing them to push the switch away. Just my exp with them tho, im no expert.\n\nThere can be a) slight tolerancing differences on ALL buttons including sanwa/semitsu types b) tolerancing differences on the button holes in different sticks. Hence, when you install any button brand on any specific stick, lightly sand the button holes/plexi in a circular motion before you start pushing down on them like the hulk. This is universal for all button installations if they feel too tight. I have the last gen Gamerfingers that didn't feel tight at all. So i didn't have to sand them. But, i've had to sand down for sanwa metallic button installation before on one of my sticks.\n\nGenerally, screw in button types are better than the push in types for the reason mentioned above. You won't be pushing down right away and will be forced to sand- to-fit before you tighten the screw. Also, the holding tabs tend to get weaker (break) after repeat installations on the push button types, a.k.a if you move them around on different sticks. Screw in buttons don't have this issue and i'd always give my vote to screw-in types.\n\nIf the .11 quick disconnect feels too tight, pry it open a bit with a screwdriver before you insert (and not push down on the button terminal like the hulk).\n\nThe issues you mentioned feel like you just didn't follow good practices w.r.t installation. I personally have not had any issues with screw-in gamer fingers. If missing the loud characteristic click of a sanwa is not psychologically satisfying, of course, one wouldn't be getting gamerfingers. That is individual preference.\n\nThere can be a) slight tolerancing differences on ALL buttons including sanwa/semitsu types b) tolerancing differences on the button holes in different sticks.
