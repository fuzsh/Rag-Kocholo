This has been deemed especially relevant following the recent agreement of IMOs Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) to amend the statutory Garbage Record Book to include a section specific to HME cargo residues and the requirement for shippers to declare in the Shippers Declaration whether or not a cargo is HME as from 1 January 2017."
