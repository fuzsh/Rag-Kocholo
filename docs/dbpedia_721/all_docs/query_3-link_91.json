        "text": "Gotta agree there. I play on RE mostly, so enemy sight range and reaction time is turned way up. Damage is up too, but they're not as tanky. It does help some aspects, but it exacerbates others.\n\nThings I would work on.\n\nEnemy damage:\n\nI don't think they make any reaction sound when hit. Yes, there's the bullet collision sound, but I'm talking about screams or grunts. More importantly. They don't flinch. They do flinch visually, but it doesn't affect their aim at all. This means you can dump dozens of bullets into an enemy and they just keep on trucking. I would make it a variable for enemies that they flinch when [X] amount or percentage of damage is taken. Flinching would produce a pain sound and either cause them to stop attacking or throw off their attack momentarily, as well as stopping them from moving. It should be a variable so like basic dudes would flinch more, and elites or special enemies might flinch less or not at all.\n\nAI:\n\nI'll be honest. I can't think of another game with this variety of user created content that has AI that can navigate without needing to be given special navigation points. Props for it actually kinda working out of the box. But it needs work. Mainly just lots and lots of polish. I don't know what the AI logic is, but they pretty much just rush you, even snipers and other long range enemies. This should be changed. Enemies should attempt to stay within their individual optimal range. And when line of sight is broken, long range enemies should have a delay before they move to find the player.\n\nExample: Melee enemies will always chase. A ranged enemy like a shotgunner will always be closing the distance, but a sniper will hang back. When line of sight is broken, a shotgunner will advance almost instantly to find the player, but a sniper will wait several seconds before moving.\n\nAlso, they should attempt to not cluster up. At least certain enemies like Zirax troops. Any military personnel should know about proper spacing so as not to have a whole squad killed with one explosion.\n\nOne thing that works well is Raptors. They come in packs, but flee when their numbers are depleted. I'm pretty sure the recent update to AI pathfinding made them no longer zig-zag, which is a shame I think.\n\n(Side note. I think the AI actually attempt to do the above, but they're really bad at it to the point that I'm not even sure if they do.)\n\nThe main thing is consistency. The AI gets stuck a lot. And then other times, it's like they're on some high-level aimbot. The difference between wiping out enemies with ease and getting wiped out yourself is most dependent on whether the AI decides to randomly flush their brains out through their bowels.\n\nAnimation:\n\nBasically this just needs work. Enemies can shoot without facing where they're shooting. The Zirax commander for example can shoot sideways from the tip of his gun, directly around a corner. I have video proof of this BS happening. Overall, it just needs a lot of polish.\n\nMost melee enemies can hit way beyond their model appears to reach. I wouldn't want the effective threat of Horrors turned down, as they are actually a challenge in decent numbers, but there's got to be a way to get the models to match up with the range of effect.\n\nThe animation for movement is also really basic. I'm pretty sure they don't strafe or backpedal. Meaning ranged enemies may turn their back to you only to whirl and shoot at random.\n\nSame as above: consistency.\n\nPlayer feedback:\n\nSounds are entirely an opinion, but I do really hate some of the sounds they use. Pulse rifles for example, and laser pistols.\n\nActual bullet hit sounds are pretty good. They get the job done fine.\n\nOther:\n\nWeapon handling:\n\nWeapons need to switch faster; full stop. I don't know if this is already the case, and if it is, it's so negligible that it's impossible to notice; but certain weapons should draw way faster than others. A pistol, for example, should be a quick-draw backup gun in a pinch. They're outclassed in every other way so that would give them an actual reason to carry. But overall every weapon just needs to switch faster -- entirely for balance purposes. I know stuffing a shotgun up your butt and retrieving a rifle would realistically take some time, but this game lets me bake food and build objects from my backpack, while running and gunning, and all while carrying a small house worth of blocks and a dozen or so weapons. Heck, maybe armor type could influence weapon swap speed.\n\nOn that note, an armor mod that increases reload speed would be really nice.\n\nAs it stands, it's janky. I can swap weapons and start firing while the weapon isn't shouldered yet, so the animation looks wonky, and yet it's still tediously slow.\n\nEnemies:\n\nI'd love to see more ranged enemies with non-hitscan weapons. Non-hitscan means the player can dodge if they're skilled enough meaning player skill directly translates into better combat performance. The hitscanners also don't really add any variety, it's just different damage output and health pools. Zirax laser, commander, androids, Mechanoids, defense droids, Assault mechs, shotgunners, snipers, minigunners, etc. They all have one strategy which is don't let them see you; shoot them before they round a corner if their model is big enough. If they start firing, you will take damage.\n\nIn any case. That's my $0.02\n\nI'm sure it's all been said before, but it's still a thing so I think it's worth saying again.\n\nUnfortunately there are key differences in Empyrion that make it very hard to match the snappy gameplay of a simple corridor shooter with its very own engine like Quake. And it's not just one detail but a major player on the whole gaming scene, from the very start, while Empyrion is build upon Unity, and... well, that's Unity. Nuff said.\n\nTo even start making comparisons, we would have to remove all building mechanics, inventory, and litterally strip the game down to have it as simple as Quake. With that much less content, of course the developers have much more time to polish combat, and it could be way more precise and satisfying than the arcade style of Quake. Levels in Quake, like I already mentioned, were pre-baked, no dynamic lights, very basic AI, and highly optimized geometry (levels and models). In Empyrion we can destroy everything, POIs are sitting on huge chunks of unoptimized geometry, and there are tons of scripts running at each game update to keep track of everything, not just a 1st-person cam and polling the user mouse+keyboard for updates.\n\nQuake had, what, total of 9 weapons ? In Empyrion we have way more + tools + interaction with the environment. If we have at least 9 different weapons sounds (and we have more) then we \"match\" Quake. Checked.\n\nEnemy behavior : Quake has limited animations sets : idle, wander, chase, hit/ attack for the humanoids, and most of the simpler critters had just wander + shoot stuff. We have something very similar in Empyrion, but way more creatures for the developers to care about. Here's a simple comparison where I deleted many of the \"variants\" and even some are missing for Empyrion :\n\nThere is just no comparison possible, both in quality and quantity. Hitboxes better in Quake ? Not so sure, and not uniform either. Player had insane weapon spread and all combat is in close quarters. Sure we can adjust weapons to make it more like Quake in POIs but then for all exterior combat it will just not work.\n\nI agree that the whole game (Empyrion) feels gooey and slow, and synch (sound/ animations/ damage indicators) suffers from that, but it can not be fixed independantly from the rest of the game. The best that could be done right now would be to take care when designing POIs and environment to not overuse the \"usual content\" & deco, which drag the FPS down and has a direct effect on good synch and play fluidity. It's not just \"combat\" that suffers but lots of other aspects too (slow mo constructors, playfields load/ change, delays between key presses and actions, etc).\n\nAs for animations, well it's one big chunk of work given the number of critters to take care of, so while I agree it can be improved I'm not going to throw rocks for this. Many if not all critters in Quake have very basic/ cartoony animations, and they almost all fall flat on their back when killed. I'm not sure Empyrion is so bad compared to this : we have kneeling humanoids, running/ walking/ feeding for animals, in ways that tend to be less cartoony, etc.\n\nBut on that point : what would be the most \"prominent\" missing animations for specific critters/ NPCs in Empyrion ?\n\nEdit : all Quake icons were taken from the public wiki\n\nI agree that Unity was a strange engine to pick, given that it's only advantage over other (free or cheap) competitors seems to be the ability to deploy on a large array of platforms: PC/Mac/Linux, consoles, Android/iOS, etc. , and there doesn't seem to be plans to port Empyrion anywhere, which makes sense, as Empyrion is already struggling to run on the most powerful platform there is.\n\nHowever, Unity is not a terrible engine per se -- it is just a more DIY one. And the implementation is the bottleneck of many of those \"bad Unity games\", and, as it seems to me, Empyrion, unfortunately.\n\nAnd this is where I agree with the basic point. True, Quake is not more (but not less, not even by an inch) than an FPS.\n\nHowever, it can be easily observed from the Empyrion game itself, there is an overall lack of polish in every game aspect. And also, it isn't like the mass of the content is growing so fast that the polish can't catch up. Core game mechanics haven't been expanded all that much recently. And by 'recently' what I really mean is 'in years'.\n\nIt isn't something of a secret. Over years I see an ever increasing number of complaints about lack of polish everywhere. From the controls, to the UI, to graphics, to net code, to animations, to missions... basically, the only aspect that I see receiving a relatively low number of streamlining requests is creative building.\n\nQuake had ad least 5 distinct weapon types: shotguns, nailguns, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, and arc lightning gun, every one of which had their uses through the whole game, had good sfx and handled perfectly, only two of them having hitscan.\n\nEmpyrion has:\n\nballistic pistols (better known as \"why is that occupying my inventory\")\n\n8 variations of the same gun (ballistic t1, t2, pulse t1, t2, minigun, and their epic variants, all essentially behaving in a very similar way),\n\nsniper rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, plasma cannons (t2/epic being nothing but an upgrade for all of the )\n\n2 variant of \"laser\" (more like plasma) weapons behaving in a same way (pistol/rifle)\n\nfor a total of 8 distinct weapon types, 5 of which (including all of the assault rifle flavors) using hitscan, all of them having awful handling, sounds and animations.\n\nSo yeah, imo, having 3 more gun types than 23yr old game is.. not a point to be proud of, especially given poor handling, sfx and animations.\n\nIn Quake, enemies had very different attack patterns.\n\nSoldiers just plainly blasted you in the face, the dogs rushed to you (bites and jump attacks).\n\nOgres moved around to get LOS, then launched grenades at you; chainsawed if you got close.\n\nZombies threw pieces of themselves at you, slowly closing distance; (+bonus undying mechanic!).\n\nScrags howered above, spitting dodgeable projectiles in bursts.\n\nFiends quickly closed distance by huge leaps, then rended you with claws and teeth.\n\nKnights moved swiftly, used two types (lunge forward or simple slash) of quick melee attacks.\n\nDeath knights used magic (a fan-like burst of dodgeable projectiles) while closing distance, then chopped you with sword.\n\n\"Spawn\" (slime) moved rapidly in jumps (hard to aim at), damaging you on contact, exploding painfuly on death.\n\nShambler closed distance for a deadly claw attack, launching a slighly less deadly arc lightning attack at mid range (with warm-up animation to dodge it!).\n\nVores launched hard-hitting, strongly homing explosive spiked balls.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nAll the creatures in Empyrion basically behave in a singular way: get to the range and LOS and attack.\n\nMelee enemies run up to their close range of attack. (Oh, and line of sight seems to be broken for them\n\nRanged enemies usually have the player already in range and LOS and so they just shoot.\n\nThat's it. That's their whole mechanic.\n\nEach additional creature needs to have:\n\nattack and move animations\n\nattack range and power\n\nAnd that's all there needs to be to cover the enemy behavior observed in-game. I honestly can't imagine where did all those advances in AI (patched in recently, 1.6 I think?) went.\n\nWith all of the above, this statement of yours sounds.. ironic.\n\nOkay, mostly on-par, I checked recently.\n\nNo, not at all. Only shotguns had spread. Nailgun was firing in two very slightly offset streams (matching the looks of the weapon!), the grenades and the rockets had their collider, and all of the weapons (ex. shotguns) were firing without any amount of spread.\n\nCorrect, and it would be foolish of me to propose such radical gameplay change. All I say is the quality of gunplay, in it's current state, is awful. And I provide an example of a game that used 1000 times less computer resources, less polygons, and an engine built from the ground by 3 people, and that beats Empyrion's gunplay in terms of quality and polish.\n\nI agree. As I mentioned above, it feels like almost the whole game desperately needs refinement.\n\nWhile it is true that raising the FPS improve some aspects, as synch, it does not eliminate stutters, misaligned sounds/animations, retardation of Zirax troops, the lack of enemy attack variety, etc.\n\nWhich ones? Maybe soldiers, maybe knights, but others? Hard disagree. I find most Quake monsters to look and move scary or, at least, monstruous.\n\nAlso, consider this: all of those animations, even those you see as cartoony, are in perfect synch with their actions. So when the animation hits, you get hit. You can actually dodge the melee monsters there, unlike Empyrion. I take goofy animations with synch over serious without it. And let's face it, the Empyrion humanoid enemies already do look either goofy or high-as-a-kite, with the pace of their animations. So we have cartoony, but no synch. Sad.\n\nFor humanoid NPCs (incl. station ones):\n\nwalking/standing/idling not as a mannequin (The 'behave like an NPC' meme is just a meme, people! Do not re-create it in game! They almost T-pose in standing idle, Carl!!!)\n\nuse terminal lazily/as normal/under stress\n\nobserve screen/someone else doing something\n\nsearching/patrolling on guard (don't aim all the time like freshman on caffeine)\n\nrelaxed walking (weapon on sling)\n\nquick/relaxed ready weapon\n\nwatching over terrain relaxed/on guard\n\nclimbing ladder relaxed/fast\n\nascending/descending in the elevator\n\nwalking on stairs/slope up/down\n\ninspect weapon, clear weapon malfunction\n\nreload\n\neating/drinking/substance use\n\nusing medkits, bandages, injections, pills\n\ncrouched movement (like the player has)\n\nprone shooting and movement\n\nbelievable melee interaction:\n\npistol grip / buttstock attack\n\npush away from self, trip running player\n\nknife slash/thrust\n\nsuppressive fire standing / over barricade / around the corner / while running away\n\ncovering (flinching) in fear from being fired at while standing / crouching / running\n\ngrenade toss standing / over barricade / while quickly opening and closing door\n\nplace mine or remote explosive + detonate it\n\nwield door shut\n\nand many others.\n\nObviously, some animations here imply additional AI behavior and player interactions, a few of them -- new gameplay mechanics even. I believe, they would greatly improve gunplay, if, however, and only if, the chunkiness of the present gunplay features is largely mitigated, stutter is no more desynchs are gone, sounds effects are bearable. Bonus points if the weapons become more than not copies of each other with different stats. But that is more related to balance, and it doesn't seem to concern anyone here, so... unlikely.\n\nFor all animals:\n\n2-3 alternative attacks, \"all-in\" power attacks (all attack limbs simultaneously or in quick succession), running/charging attacks\n\nidling:\n\nsmell ground, smell air\n\nraise head to hear\n\nscratch ground, dig ground\n\nlook at something with interest, turn head to look at different angles\n\nshake head/body (like dog that came out of the water)\n\nstretch limbs, body muscles\n\nstealthily creeping on prey\n\nhowling/calling\n\nwarning roars / hisses for trespassers\n\nrunning in panic\n\ninjured movement, injured panicking movement\n\nexhausted movement\n\nstumbles and falls\n\nsitting/lying on the ground, warming up in the sun\n\nplayful fooling around (for babies and social creatures)\n\nfighting for food\n\nself cleaning, cleaning others, bathing, dust bathing\n\ndrinking water, lying in water (for cooling)\n\nAgain, for some of those, additional interactions and mechanics are requred.\n\nIn conclusion I feel I need to state my condensed overall thoughts on the gunplay aspect.\n\nThe chunkiness, lack of refinement and any polish is felt in the most aspects of the game. In first-person combat, it is exceptionally obvious, painful and fun-breaking.\n\nMy conclusion is that the game really needs fixing, refinement, polish, and QA, right now, maybe even yesterday. For the reason that the snowball of problems is not getting thinner, and that it influences every aspect of the game, \"fixing\" the gunplay alone seems impossible, not without fixing everything else.\n\ntl;dr:\n\nI compared only the directly comparable aspects of the gunplay.\n\nQuake had interesting distinct enemies, interesting guns, and the smoothness/responsiveness of interaction of the two on a level that is above the today's state of Empyrion's first-person shooter component.\n\nMany animations are lacking from Empyrion.\n\nThe game imo is in desperate need of fixing and refinement, as all of the aspect suffer from the same things: stutter, animation desynch, slowness, control chunkiness, etc.\n\nI find enemies in Empyrion, as I said above, inconsistent.\n\nIf you don't have good armor, they can wreck you pretty quick. In vanilla, I think it's that they're really accurate hitscanners mostly; in Reforged a lot of them are less accurate but do more damage. When the AI actually kicks in and does something, Empyrion enemies can be a serious threat. (But again, inconsistencies and bugs get them stuck on stuff or simply left staring at walls.)\n\nOff the top of my head, that's almost entirely because of weapon reload animations and weapon swaps speeds. I've played 7D2D and seen videos of current builds. The swap speeds in 7D2D are way faster than Empyrion. But a big problem for Empyrion is the fact that auto reload cannot be disabled, meaning if you run dry and hold the trigger for just a millisecond too long, you're now locked into a lengthy animation. If you switch weapons during the animation, it still takes time and then the animation has bullets spraying forward from your gun while the barrel it pointing to the sky. The point there is it's very clunky and even a slow-moving zombie game has faster, more responsive weapon handling.\n\nThe other issue is with the way enemies are in Empyrion. If what you say is true, and the gunplay is farther from Quake or Doom, unfortunately the POIs are not built with this in mind. In fact, a number of your more notorious POIs feature traps and enemy layouts more like old-school Doom than anything else I can think of. Things like the end of the Abandoned Bunker, the end of the Abandoned Vessel Yard, and the end of the Rados Missile Silo have me swarmed by enough hitscanner enemies that I flashback the the Plutonia WAD. (Okay, they're not that sadistic, but you get my point; it's a lot.)\n\nNot that I don't love those POIs, I do. But I think just a little less time getting stuck in lengthy animations if I run a weapon dry would make designs like that more fun and more viable. As it is, I'm often left hoping the AI breaks down long enough for me to reload because they can certainly kill me before I get a fresh mag in and there's a lot of them. It's not like you can chuck a quick grenade of flashbang to distract them and give you breathing room.\n\nOn the other hand, we get stuff like this:\n\nAnd I've not seen this happen much so I think there's some oddity where the animation becomes untied to the hitbox/enemy position so he actually kept moving before triggering the attack but the animation triggered earlier... I think. Haven't done enough research to confirm. Otherwise it's just a massive melee range. Same goes for most melee enemies.\n\nI get it though, because if melee range was equal to animation/model reach, I'd never get touched. Enemies run, then stop to trigger an attack, then run. They're all like Pinky demons from OG Doom. They'd be trivial at worst if their range wasn't expanded as it is. So the solution would be to speed up the transition between running and attacking, and possibly have dashing or lunging attacks. Lots of work, but hey, that's game development.\n\nAnd then there's this.\n\nEdit: I guess I can't just link it so just skip to 7:45\n\n(There's a follow-up close up of the shot about a minute later.) (Yes, I'm aware the think with Zirax Commanders is known. My point remains)\n\nThere's about a million little things like these. It's just polish and tightening of animation/model sync with damage/hitbox calculations.\n\nI think I said it before, last time I was complaining, that with the jetpack and mobility + arsenal, your ability to output damage and move around is like 2016 Doom or Serious Sam. But then you get swiped by an enemy you thought you dodged, or sniped by a hitscanner you either can't dodge or are just praying on the game's internal dice roll for whether it hits, or you need to reload a gun so you're stuck in an animation. It's a mixed message I think, because there's not really a defined way to advance through POIs that doesn't result in tanking damage and relying on lots of health packs.\n\nI think it is another one of those things that, if improved, would make a world of difference. More responsive weapon handling/gunplay + more consistent enemies + maybe less reliance on hitscan so incoming damage felt like player error instead of fated to happen = a more engaging gameplay experience. I think players should be encouraged and enabled to advance forward rather than tediously wait at corners and try to bait enemies out or take advantage of when the AI has a stroke.\n\nOh, and a second to most of what akimzav said just above me. A lot of good stuff there. I'll add this though; comparisons to Quake or Doom, I think, should be taken in with the idea of overall design goal. As stated above, the weapons in those games each had a purpose, and the enemies likewise. Empyrion plays like a whole bunch of stuff slapped together, but not properly assembled. Whichever way Eleon decides to tune the game in terms on ground combat, changes and additions need to reflect that.\n\nIf they want it to play more like oldschool arena/arcadey shooters, great; if they want it to be more methodical, tactical, or just slower, also fine. But as it is we have enemies and ways to shoot them and ways for them to damage the player, but there's no cohesion or balance to it because so many parts of it contradict each other.\n\nWell, I think I'm rambling/repeating myself. Too tired I guess.\n\nI'mma go off and play the game some more, because I do enjoy it. So I hope no one gets the impression that I just want to complain for the sake of it."
