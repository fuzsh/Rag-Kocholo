        "text": "I have a simple car object which is just one solid block. I Haven't got any behaviour scripts on it, just a generic script that allows it to register damage and be destroyed. This behaviour is unique to the relationship between the object and the wheel colliders.\n\nI attached 4 colliders, equal distance apart from eachother in an empty game object, and made that a child of my car object (this has worked before, but has also caused problems before).\n\nThe object randomly tilts, first back on to the hind wheels, then i rotated it, and it's tilting to side. If I move it in scene and let the game run it will return to this irregular position.\n\nThe wheels are identical, the placement symmetrical, The object hitbox is just a box, no mesh collision or anything sophisticated. Why is it doing this?\n\nAlso, when I ram the object with my player, it will float, or be immovable. It will sometimes ignore gravity, or just tilt like it is here.\n\nI have done this with other objects with no problem, but I feel like every time I use wheel colliders I am rolling a dice with how random these errors are. Any advice as to what could cause this and why it's so inconsistent."
