        "text": "10. Range taunt does not work. Patch notes claim it was fixed, but its still a dice whether taunt will go off or not. Very cool way to incentivize all tanks to quit because they can not reliable perform the most basic mechanic tanks are responsible for - keeping stuff taunted.\n\nI honestly think this needs more face-time. I'm seeing it more and more recently, though for some reason it's intermittent. The only thing that is consistent is that it's infuriatingly frustrating not just to the tank but also to everyone else. Either the system is working or it is flawed.\n\nIt's flawed. Initiating a fight with range taunt is a coin toss, and it shouldn't be.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yrvTXpmMXk\n\n(0:01 light attack, 0:02 range taunt animation plays, target does not get taunted (where does this ability even go? Did it hit? Did it fly off into Oblivion?), you can't hear it but at 0:03 I'm calling out to block because it's not taunted, 0:05 healer dies while trying to get the thing taunted)\n\nThe only way to ensure something gets taunted by using range taunt to initiate is to double taunt, which takes two global cooldowns. Even the light attack doesn't get initial aggro.\n\nI agree with everything else you've said as well, though. However, I just want to point something out regarding tab-targeting.\n\n7. Tab targeting never works. You tab target Llothis - hit Olms instead. Tab target 1 mob in the pack, taunt another instead.\n\nEarly on when I started playing, I understood tab-targeted as \"Priority Targeting.\" Unlike other games which use Exclusive Targeting and will force you into attacking only the thing which is currently tab-targeted, ESO is much more priority based, if you're not looking directly at something else but still have something tab-targeted, then you'll aim at that thing even when not looking at it; e.g. I can chain something behind me while not looking at it if it is tab-targeted, but if I'm looking directly at something else while the tab-targeted mob is not within view, then I'll chain the untargeted mob instead. I believe it's \"working as intended,\" but its intent is not intuitive.\n\nIn addition to that, it's not explained anywhere how to use the targeting or what that intent is. First and foremost, the underused and undervalued Help section in-game, a resource that hardly anyone knows about, also doesn't explain it. The only mention of targeting is under \"Identifying Foes.\"\n\nThe help section which few people will ever look at should be made much more interactive, and I've described how to do that in various threads, as well as on Discord with friends.\n\n@Troodon80 PC | EU\n\nGuild: N&S\n\nHand of Alkosh | Dawnbringer | Immortal Redeemer | Tick Tock Tormentor | Gryphon Heart\n\nDeep Dive into Dreadsail Reef Mechanics\n\nBut in all honesty, there are various reasons why the skill gap exists. Including those you've listed. Light attack weaving is one of the reasons for the gap, but it's a misconception on a lot of players who think it's about spamming left click while pressing your ability key; it's not, CPM measures actual casts and is the important statistic to take away from this. The more you attempt to spam buttons, the less CPM you're actually likely to get as inputs will take priority over each other.\n\nI'm not explaining this bit for the topic starter. SeaUnicorn already knows this stuff. Rather it's for others who have this misconception of what light attack weaving is.\n\nBecause of the basic queue system, if you left click at 250ms from the end of the current GCD, then press an ability button within 0-50ms, then another light attack or ability, all before the current GCD has ended, chances are only the light attack will get queued up.\n\nSpamming buttons is usually the worst and least effective way to do weaving. It's no wonder people think you'll get carpal tunnel from it. It's a fundamental misunderstanding. Light attack weaving takes a little bit of precision and some discipline. Not wild spamming of keys.\n\nWhen I attempt to teach people about weaving, the first thing I do is say \"forget everything you think you know about it.\" Cliché, I know. But more often than not, it's needed. The second thing is \"slow it down, right now you're learning. What you want to do is make sure your light attacks are actually going off. Do a light attack... ... now do a skill. Now repeat that. Do it a couple times. Now speed it up. Light attack... ... ... skill. Light attack... ... skill. Light attack, skill. Light attack, skill. Light attack, skill.\" It's not some mystical art that only the top 1% can do.\n\nMore often than not, it doesn't come down to age or reflexes or even disability (as even amputees have worked around this). It comes down to a mental block in most cases. You think, therefore...\n\nWell, in this case, someone else has said \"it's a bug\" or \"it's cheating\" or \"it's really hard, only the top players can do it\" or some other contrivance, when in reality it does only take an afternoon to \"master.\" I don't even necessarily think the game should teach it specifically.\n\nMost other MMOs have some form of weaving, but they don't teach it. It's a skill gap in those games and it's a skill gap here. In FFXIV, for example, weaving -- or even double weaving -- isn't something shown in tutorials. People will often say on these forums that light attack weaving is unique to ESO. Weaving isn't unique at all, and even light attack weaving can be compared to other MMOs' versions of weaving -- which is usually mixing those oGDC (off Global Cooldown, instant cast) abilities with GCDs (Global Cooldowns, those with longer and shared cooldowns). Light attacks are oGCD abilities while main abilities are GCD.\n\nThe second thing outside of a mental block is... not caring or not feeling a need. This part in particular applies to everything and not just light attack weaving. A lot of people who play casually simply don't see the need to weave, and, thus, don't care. After all, as long as DPS is sufficient to get through content, why care about doing more? There isn't a good reason to care when you're doing overland quest content solo. This largely only applies to people in group content, or wanting to get into group content. Even some people at end game level on healers and tanks, for example; \"I'm a healer, I don't need to weave,\" sure, but why wouldn't you? You have a Berserker, Magicka Absorb, etc. enchantment on your restoration staff, but you're not proccing that by using Combat Prayer, none of the restoration skills proc your weapon enchantment, so you should be light attacking just for that.\n\nSo with a skill-level which seems to only be dedicated to end game, why should people care? There are plenty of reasons why one should do it, but there isn't much of a reason to care about it outside of end game.\n\nThe problem with the current changes in the Preview: it won't convince those people to do play \"better.\" In the same way that changing timings on DoTs or changing damage to light attacks won't stop someone from only applying their Blockade once every minute, doing a couple spammable attacks, and doing a few light attacks, with a grand total of 30 CPM for an entire fight. These changes are meaningless and won't really positively or negatively affect such players. ZOS isn't really raising the floor here by any real degree with the numbers we currently have (which isn't much).\n\n@Troodon80 PC | EU\n\nGuild: N&S\n\nHand of Alkosh | Dawnbringer | Immortal Redeemer | Tick Tock Tormentor | Gryphon Heart\n\nDeep Dive into Dreadsail Reef Mechanics\n\nThere will always be a skill gap but the scale of it bad (from the point of view of not having a vast range of DPS) because ESO is very linear in everything. If they want to fix it then they need to make \"getting good\" rather less linear. If \"getting good\" instead of each chunk of effort taking you to 10K, 20K , 30K, 40K,50K takes you 10K, 20K, 29K, 37K, 45K,... the best DPS are still getting the biggest numbers and the highest score but the whole range is compressed more which makes the content work better. They've done some of that with CP but they've failed to address the rest of the game. Very few similar games are so linear in scaling.\n\nEso is the same and I really don't understand why a developer team wants so hard to let unskilled guitarists to play with Guns'n Roses.\n\nIt's an Elder Scrolls game. The basic story plot is nobody prisoner becomes great hero and saves world. That's why a lot of people play it. Not because they want to spend 3 months training to complete veteran hard mode sunspire. The whole game plot is basically the fantasy version of newb with guitar hero stick becomes rock star.\n\nDon't get me wrong - the people who want to spend 3 months beating veteran sunspire hard mode no death etc are important too, but they are the tail not the dog.\n\nToo many toons not enough time\n\nThere will always be a skill gap but the scale of it bad (from the point of view of not having a vast range of DPS) because ESO is very linear in everything.\n\nThe issue is, the proposed changes to DoTs and light attacks won't make getting good easier. People are looking at a symptom rather than a cause. The skill gap is enormous, magnitudes higher than most other games. I don't think anyone could debate that point. But this is because of misunderstandings of game systems, which are, while very in-depth, very basic and you do not need to be a mathematics professor to understand. This isn't such a huge issue in other games with class or role restricted gear, for example, or where combos are displayed to show the basics of a rotation, have level synced content, or games which don't have live readouts for DPS.\n\nA DD right now with full heavy armour, health enchantments, health regen enchantments, full loadout of defensive CP, and doing maybe 60 CPM will not do considerably more after the update. Compared to someone who understands that heavy armour will not really help contribute to DPS and instead opts for light or medium, that higher CPM generally means better uptimes and higher overall damage, the changes will not bridge this gap in any way, because the wrong thing is being focused. The symptom of low DPS is the focus rather than the cause, which is the understanding of core gameplay mechanics. For such a DPS focused game, it doesn't really give any details on how to do DPS.\n\nThe concept that punishing people for spending time to get better will somehow bridge the skill gap is flawed. It possibly will have that effect, in the same way that amputating an arm fixes a broken finger... in that the finger is no longer an issue. But what happens when that same person breaks a finger on the other hand because the cause wasn't addressed?\n\n@Troodon80 PC | EU\n\nGuild: N&S\n\nHand of Alkosh | Dawnbringer | Immortal Redeemer | Tick Tock Tormentor | Gryphon Heart\n\nDeep Dive into Dreadsail Reef Mechanics\n\nIt's an Elder Scrolls game. The basic story plot is nobody prisoner becomes great hero and saves world. That's why a lot of people play it. Not because they want to spend 3 months training to complete veteran hard mode sunspire.

During the last part, where you have to fight the most dangerous enemy of the world, Molag Bal, your toon is invulnerable... (that's crazy)\n\nIf you want more, you have to put effort in the game and the end game is designed around a certain ammount of damage, the game is full of dps checks and sometimes 40k is not enought. It's a bad game design for unskilled players? Yes, but (IMHO) that's right, things must be earned\n\nThe main problem with putting in the effort is the ESO community itself gate keeping content. As the DPS ceiling rises so does the floor for endgame content with a large portion of the community on console because we have only one way to measure power and that’s dummy humping.\n\nNot so long ago you had trial groups asking for 85K parses for GH prog that are now asking for 110K parses. Did they make the content harder? Certainly not. The difference between 85 and 110 are a couple less mechanics, but the mechanics remain the same.\n\nAnd now a couple weeks after High Isle release we see groups posting “open” runs of vDSR with requirements of 95K, multiple clears and minimum score of 150K. How elitist is that.\n\nWhat it all adds up to is the same players doing the same runs pulling from the same sub lists across multiple discords because the pool of players that meet those requirements is too small. 500 people in the guild, but less than a couple dozen even qualified for the run. It’s very off putting.\n\nThat’s your real skill gap, players simply can’t get the reps of hard mode content despite having more than ample DPS to complete it. You only gain skill by learning the mechs and the only real way to learn mechs is to have skilled players teach them. A teaching run here or there to get clears isn’t enough. It takes regular quality reps and those just aren’t available to a large percentage of the player base."
