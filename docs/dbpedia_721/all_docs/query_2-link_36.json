        "text": "If you have the budget to replace the belt, replace it. If not, then wait a half a year or a year then replace after u have plenty of dollars. That belt looks fairly new tbh. If i were you i would change it in about a year or less just for peace of mind. Grease your driveline, thats another thing u should do. Red n tacky grease is what i use. You will need a needle adapter for a zerk on one of the u joints, the rest are regular zerks. Do a tranny drain and fill. Mine took exactly 4 quarts to get the level perfect. I used the other 4 gallons to change my ps fluid. Bleed brakes if u know how to. Check coolant make sure its the right type and looks perfectly clean. Cant really think of much else\n\nThanks, my to do list is getting longer!\n\nFirst off...welcome!\n\nSecondly, 6112/5160s and a deaver leafpack are a bit overkill for your stated use (\"down long miles of dirt, nothing crazy, no rockcrawling, no towing.\"). 5100s all around with new coil springs and something closer to OEM leaf springs, like General Springs, would save you some money that you could spend on doing the timing belt (and all those other ancillary items that should be done when the timing belt is being replaced) right now. Deaver springs will get you a better ride...but you'll pay for it and it will still be a truck ride when all is said and done. IMHO leaf springs like Deavers become worth their money when you start using your truck outside the bounds the OEM intended. That does not sound like the case with you.\n\nhttps://www.generalspringkc.com/Leaf_Springs_Toyota_Tundra_2000_2006_s/1935.htm\n\nPersonally, unless you can verify it's been done recently, in addition to the timing/belt water pump/thermostat/serpentine belt I would do the following:\n\nAll-fluids swapped out.\n\nGrease all your zerks\n\nNew Plugs\n\nLBJs (hit a bad rut/rock/hole on one of those long dirt roads and you'll be stranded for awhile before the tow truck makes it out there...if they will come)\n\nBrakes (and I would do an upgrade to 13WL calipers/rotors/pad...look at your calipers to make sure this hasn't already been done...if yours are stamped 13WE, you want to upgrade, if they are stamped 13WL, just replace the rotors/pads with new IF needed)\n\nDenso radiator\n\nInline Fuel Filter\n\nPCV-Valve\n\nRear-Diff breather...especially if those long dirt roads have any water crossings.\n\nThings to check, and replace if needed:\n\nSteering Rack (check for leaks)\n\nAxle seals\n\nSuspension/steering bushings\n\nTie-rods\n\nBattery. How old is it? If you can't confirm the age or you can and it's 3+ years old (AZ heat is hard on batteries), a $100 new Interstate Battery from Costco is cheap piece of mind when you are parked way out on one of those dirt roads.\n\nAlso, based on your use case (\"long miles of dirt roads\") I would not go with a Michellin LTX. It's a great tire...if you spend 95% of your time on the highway. For what you are describing I would feel more comfortable with something like a Yokohama Geolander G015. Still great on the road...but with a bit more bite in the dirt. If you are going down long dirt roads...I don't need to tell you that sometimes they can surprisingly be less road-like and more trail-like than you expected, especially if there is inclement weather involved.\n\nhttps://www.yokohamatire.com/tires/geolandar-a-t-g015\n\nThirdly...again, welcome to the forum. You bought a GREAT truck that will last you as long as you want it to with fairly basic maintenance..."
