        "text": "gtk-recordmydesktop\n\nAdds an easy to use graphical icon on the GNOME toolbar to make a pleasure use and configure the audio and video capture and screencast application recordMyDesktop.\n\nAs mentioned at 20.04: Can't install gtk-recordmydesktop and on the package search, the package is not available on the main repository anymore, and sudo apt install gtk-recordmydesktop fails. I'm not sure why the http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/gtk-recordmydesktop link seems to work, maybe it installs an older version. But this indicates that the software is not being actively supported.\n\nrecordmydesktop\n\nThis is the non-GUI backend of recordmydesktop, and it is still available in 20.04:\n\nsudo apt install recordmydesktop recordmydesktop --on-the-fly-encoding\n\nThis will record until you stop the program on the terminal e.g. with Ctrl + C.\n\n--on-the-fly-encoding encodes the output immediately; without it you need to wait for a possibly long time at the end for the encoding to be done. I haven't seen any significant downsides to that option yet, likely it will just take a bit more of CPU resources, but it is generally worth it.\n\nIt should be able to do everything that gtk-recordmydesktop does, but it is a bit harder to learn as you have to deal with the command lines.\n\nYou can set a stop recording shortcut e.g. with:\n\nrecordmydesktop --stop-shortcut=Control+s\n\nYou can select to record a single window as shown at: How can I get the value of Window ID?\n\nrecordmydesktop --windowid `xwininfo | grep 'id: 0x' | grep -Eo '0x[a-z0-9]+'`\n\nThis will allow you to first select the window with a mouse click, and it starts recording after you click.\n\nHow to record sound output with it: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3490/how-can-i-record-the-sound-output-with-gtk-recordmydesktop\n\nxvidcap (no longer maintained, package is no longer available)\n\nA screen capture enabling you to capture videos off your X-Window desktop for illustration or documentation purposes. It is intended to be a standards-based alternative to tools like Lotus ScreenCam.\n\nVideo can be saved in MPEG or AVI files format.\n\nSimple Screen Recorder\n\nSimpleScreenRecorder is a Linux program that I've created to record programs and games. There are programs that can do this, \" but I wasn't 100% happy with any of them, so I created my own \"\n\nMy original goal was to create a program that was just really simple to use, but as I was writing it I started adding more and more features, and the result is actually a fairly complex program. It's 'simple' in the sense that it's easier to use than ffmpeg/avconv or VLC :).\n\nFor Ubuntu versions 12.04 - 16.10 it is not in the standard repositories and can be installed with the following:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:maarten-baert/simplescreenrecorder sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install simplescreenrecorder # if you want to record 32-bit OpenGL applications on a 64-bit system: sudo apt-get install simplescreenrecorder-lib:i386\n\nFor Ubuntu versions 17.04 - onwards it is included in the universe repository and can be installed by:\n\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install simplescreenrecorder\n\nHere is a UI preview:\n\nGNOME built-in desktop recorder\n\nGnome 3 already seems to have a very simple thing to do record Screencasts - you can assign what shortcut it uses in Keyboard settings. It records the entire screen, and records directly into a webm file (a fairly widely used format) into XDG_VIDEOS_DIR - by default \"$HOME/Videos\".\n\nBy default, to start recording, press Ctrl + Alt + Shift + R. You'll see a circle displayed on top right corner to indicate recording is in process.\n\nTo Stop recording, press Ctrl + Alt + Shift + R again.\n\nSource: Screenshots and screencasts on Gnome Help page\n\nThe above image should be animated - if you have animations disabled it won't work. Click to view the file\n\nIf you want to convert the image to a animation, this answer on Superuser is very helpful - the best method is to basically:\n\nAnother command-line method would be to export the movie to frames using ffmpeg:\n\nmkdir frames ffmpeg -i input -vf scale=320:-1 -r 10 frames/ffout%03d.png\n\nThen use convert from ImageMagick (or GraphicsMagick) to make your animated GIF:\n\nconvert -delay 5 -loop 0 frames/ffout*.png output.gif\n\nThis is how I did the above animation, with the exception that I added -dither None -colors 80 -fuzz \"40%\" -layers OptimizeFrame to the convert command*, and cropped the result in GIMP.\n\n*Be careful with these options, some like using ALL of the CPU\n\nOpen Broadcaster Software (OBS)\n\nBut this works really well. The main reason why I use it is because I can record both my microphone AND monitor output with ease.\n\nPlus you can stream to Twitch if you'd like.\n\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:jon-severinsson/ffmpeg sudo apt-add-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ffmpeg obs-studio\n\nIf you don't want to add the PPA you can also download the deb file and installed with sudo dpkg -i <debfile>.\n\nThe benefit of OBS is that you can preset many recording options like screen recording and webcam. Whenever you need to start recording just select the preset recording option and start recording. Along with that while screen recording you need not to select windows/ grab screen every time. It have option to select whole screen or just a specific area of page on google-chrome or Firefox or libre-doc. In this case it just keep on recording that specific selected area of that application irrespective of what you are viewing on your screen and even if you resrat. You can see real time preview. This saves a lot of time and effort.\n\nHow to create an animated (GIF) screenshot\n\nAdded bonus with this approach is that you can post the screencast without embed tags on any forum that includes animated GIFs as embedded like this\n\nThe answers prior to mine have clearly answered how to create a video screencast. Now if you just want to show an animated screenshot, essentially an extremely short screencast in an image format (GIF, and not more than ~10 sec), it's also easy.\n\nFirst create a screencast of what you want to show in the animated GIF. Then follow the instructions below...\n\nYou'll need Gimp, mplayer (WARNING! NOT mplayer2) and mencoder. Issue the following commands to install them.\n\nsudo apt-get install gimp sudo apt-get install mplayer sudo apt-get install mencoder sudo apt-get -f install\n\nAlternatively, you can install them from the Synaptic package manager that comes with Ubuntu.\n\nThe following command breaks your screencast into a number of jpeg or png (based on which command you choose) images:\n\nmplayer -ao null -ss 0:0:33 -endpos 2 eagles.avi -vo jpeg:outdir=Desktop/animated mplayer -ao null -ss 0:0:33 -endpos 2 eagles.avi -vo png:z=9:outdir=Desktop/animated\n\nWhere, -ss 0:0:33 tells mplayer where you begin (0 hours, 0 minutes, 33 seconds), -endpos 2 tells mplayer where to stop (2 minutes), z=9 sets compression level for the output png images to 9, Desktop/animated is the directory (~/Desktop/animated/) where you want the images to be output to.\n\nYou can also tell mplayer where to stop, as a specific time, like so:\n\nmplayer -ao null -ss 0:0:33 -endpos 0:1:12 eagles.avi -vo jpeg:outdir=Desktop/animated mplayer -ao null -ss 0:0:33 -endpos 0:1:12 eagles.avi -vo png:z=9:outdir=Desktop/animated\n\nNow you have the images, but you need to combine them into a single, animated GIF. This is really simple:\n\nStart Gimp > File > Open as Layers > browse to the directory (~/Desktop/animated/), Ctrl+A to select all images, and click 'Open'.\n\nSimple hit Shift+Ctrl+S or go to File > Save As... and name the image as 'animated.gif' > hit 'Save' > check 'Save as Animation' radio button > hit 'Export' > in the next window, simply hit 'Save' unless you know what you are doing.\n\nThat's it. You have your animated GIF ready!\n\nHere's an example:\n\nPS: I am not very comfortable with the terminology when it comes to this kind of stuff, but I hope I am clear nevertheless. :)\n\nSOURCE: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhJtyblE_D0\n\nAfter trying everything, this is the solution I came up with:\n\nNote: The \"fake\" ffmpeg from Libav has been depreciated (within Libav) and has been replaced by avconv from Libav. The \"deprecated\" message does not apply to the real ffmpeg from FFmpeg which is unaffected and is still under heavy development.\n\nFirst install the required codecs:\n\nsudo apt-get install libavcodec-extra-5*\n\nUse the following command to record the screencast:\n\navconv -f alsa -i pulse -f x11grab -r 30 -s 1280x800 -i :0.0 -vcodec libx264 -acodec libmp3lame myscreencast.mkv\n\nChange -s 1280x800 to whatever resolution you like.\n\nmore examples\n\nall screen with given resolution and sound\n\navconv -f alsa -i pulse -f x11grab -r 30 -s 1024x768 -i :0.0 -acodec pcm_s16le -vcodec libx264 -threads 0 output.mkv\n\nall screen with mouse following and sound\n\navconv -f alsa -i pulse -f x11grab -show_region 1 -follow_mouse 100 -r 10 -s 960x540 -i :0.0+10,200 -acodec pcm_s16le -qscale 0 -threads 0 output.mkv\n\nDetailed options I know are following\n\n-f: input file format\n\n-i: input file name\n\n-r: fps (Frame Per Second)\n\n-s: frame size (width x height)\n\n-i :0.0+10,200: size of squared area to follow"
