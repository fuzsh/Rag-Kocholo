        "text": "ATEI, London\n\nJanuary 23rd, 2002\n\nElo TouchSystems, the global leader in touch technology and a unit of Tyco Electronics, has launched its new industry-specific website: www.elogaming.com\n\nDesigned specifically for the gaming and amusement market, the site features extensive\n\ndetail on the products and services, the touch technologies and latest developments, as well as installation tips for hardware and software integration. Additionally, Elo's online\n\ndiagnostics - Web Tech - is also available to help new users and to troubleshoot the most\n\ncommon integration issues in both hardware and software.\n\nMike Sigona, Elo's gaming market manager said: \"This new website is particularly useful for businesses that want to integrate touch into a gaming or amusement application. We decided to make this a gaming knowledge base, packed with detailed information on our iTouch and IntelliTouch products, technology comparisons, and Elo services. Not only is it easy to navigate throughout the site, online help is only a few clicks away though our virtual technician at Web Tech.\"\n\nLeisure Link's \"itbox\" is touchscreen enabled by Elo's latest technology\n\nLeisure Link is the world's largest provider of out-of-home entertainment solutions,\n\noperating more than 90,000 pay-to-play machines in the UK's leisure retail market. The\n\ncompany's new \"itbox\" machine provides a totally different concept in electronic\n\nentertainment and is operated with a touchscreen.\n\nLeisure Link chose Elo TouchSystems' iTouch touch-on-tube as its preferred touch technology for this latest product. The \"itbox\" has only been in the field for a few months but it is already obvious that the concept is a hit. Here is the story behind the birth of a highly successful total entertainment system.\n\nLeisure Link decided it needed to carry out research to assess the market, before it\n\ncommissioned its new machine. The \"itbox\" is the result of this market research which\n\nwas combined with its broad and long experience in the leisure market. The machine is\n\naimed at providing for the future needs of electronic entertainment, including how to\n\nboost the percentage of customers actually using the entertainment facilities in a leisure\n\nvenue. The research also answered two critical questions about the future: is there a\n\nbusiness opportunity for the new tool, and, if so, how big is it?\n\nLeisure Link discovered the opportunity is certainly there, and, importantly, it is massive. The research concluded several other points, including the fact that visitors to any leisure venue like to be entertained, they are youngish and have youthful attitudes, and they visit pubs and clubs between two and three times per week. Additionally, both men and women will socialise in groups and they welcome new ideas and new choices of entertainment in these leisure venues.\n\nLeisure Link has developed a way of satisfying the demands highlighted in the research. Using the latest technology available, they developed the first-ever, digital, out-of-home entertainment concept in the UK. Chris Simon, Leisure Link's Marketing Director, said: \"Traditionally, the facilities in an establishment would consist of an AWP machine, a quiz machine and a video game each placed in a convenient location around the facility. We decided to take a fresh approach to complement the existing equipment with a complete entertainment package which would include games, music, video clips, e-commerce, promotions and more, all available, as required, from one machine. Although not designed to replace all the existing machines, it would offer a new and dynamic facility for the leisure manager. The result is our entertainment platform, \"itbox\".\"\n\n\"The touchscreen-driven terminal is an exciting and striking new design which will draw\n\nthe consumer towards it,\" Chris Simon continued, \"however, the key to the machine's\n\nsuccess is its content. A leisure establishment's users are often completely different on a\n\nTuesday lunchtime to a Friday evening, and again different on a Sunday afternoon. The \"itbox\" is a totally new concept which delivers whatever entertainment the establishment\n\nwants, whenever it is required. It can be programmed to enable family content earlier in\n\nthe day and to automatically switch to a different form of entertainment and alternative\n\nservices and opportunities in the evening. What is most important is that the machine\n\ncan be changed and updated remotely and frequently to ensure users do not tire of the\n\ncontent.\"\n\nMike Schweers, Leisure Link\"s Technical Manager, commented: \"The touchscreen and\n\ndisplay play an important role in the overall effectiveness of itbox, so it is critical to its\n\nsuccess as an interactive entertainment machine. At the development stage, we decided\n\nto produce a commercial trial using different touchscreen manufacturer\"s technologies.\n\nHaving analysed the results at the end of the trial, we discovered the units fitted with\n\nElo's touch technology were streets ahead of the other units and it proved to provide a\n\nbetter all-round consumer experience. In addition, some manufacturers touchscreens,\n\nbased on an overlay technology, and used in the trial, were subject to breakage. Elo's\n\niTouch solves that issue as it has no overlay.\n\n\"The touchscreen is based upon Elo's surface wave technology, called iTouch, which\n\nprovides us with superior clarity, fast and accurate response and excellent durability.\n\nMike Schweers continued: \"Another feature of Elo's touchscreen is the capability for z-\n\naxis control, which allows us to add further functionality as we develop and roll out new\n\nentertainments. For example, the z-axis allows us to take advantage of how much\n\npressure a user puts on the screen. This effectively acts like pressing an accelerator to\n\ngo faster.\"\n\nThe initial trial and our first commercial roll-out of more than 1,500 units were in place\n\nin the UK by the end of 2001. \"For us, an important feature of Elo's iTouch technology is\n\nthe excellent picture clarity due to the 100% light transmission\", concluded Mike\n\nSchweers.\n\nElo's iTouch \"touch-on-tube\" technology eliminates the need for a glass overlay by\n\napplying surface wave technology directly to the extra-strong CRT faceplate. Mike\n\nSigona, Elo's European gaming market manager said: \"iTouch 'touch-on-tube'\n\ntechnology builds on the success of IntelliTouch by eliminating the glass overlay and\n\nplacing the 'touchscreen' directly on the CRT surface. This eliminates parallax due to the\n\nadded glass, maintains 100% of the picture quality including light transmission, colour\n\npurity and graphic quality, takes advantage of the CRT's tough tube faceplate, and has\n\nno added reflection. The end-result for the user is a sharp, high-contrast image,\n\nattractive colours and decreased frustration from 'missing' even small touch targets\n\nbecause of its drift-free accuracy. For the business, it helps increase profitability from\n\ngreater usage, provides lower maintenance costs and less risk from vandalism,\"\n\nconcluded Mike Sigona.\n\nChris Simon, Leisure Link's Marketing Director, continued: \"itbox\" content is the key to\n\nthe true success and we worked hard to ensure that there is a package suitable for any\n\nleisure environment. The leisure site manager simply chooses the content and the times\n\nthey wish to present the selections. The programmable content ranges from traditional\n\npuzzle and quiz games with tournament capabilities, video clips of films, chart music and\n\nalbums, through to sports action and footage from the most recent two seasons of\n\nPremiership football. The content also includes one of the most statistically accurate\n\nracing tips service in the UK. In addition, users can download the latest ringtones for\n\ntheir mobile phones or, for the more mature audiences, there is an adult package\n\navailable. They simply choose their requirements using the touchscreen display and pay\n\nfor the services with coins, notes or credit cards.\n\n\"itbox is more than simply a blue and yellow box, it is a full entertainment system which\n\nis upgradeable quickly and easily to the fast-paced world of leisure. We anticipate itbox\n\nbecoming the de-facto standard entertainment tool for all sectors of the leisure\n\nindustry.\" said Chris Simon.\n\nAbout Elo Touchsystems\n\nElo TouchSystems, Inc., global leader in touch technology, is a unit of Tyco Electronics.
