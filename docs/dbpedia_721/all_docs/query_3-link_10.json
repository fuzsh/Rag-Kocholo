        "text": "Often, you will have several options to personalize your control panel. Note: Not every option will apply to your Fightstick model.\n\nCUT BUTTON INSERTS | HOLOGRAPHIC PATTERNS\n\nLayout Configuration\n\nEach Fightstick has its own characteristics, with some sharing similar elements, such as the popular Vewlix button layout. We will specify what options are available for each Fightstick. Below are the most common button layout configurations:\n\n- Back to topic top\n\nRemoving Default Elements\n\nSome Fightsticks, such as the popular MadCatz TE, offer additional personalization options by removing default elements such as control panel, start button, or screws. Cut options are defaulted to their authentic counterpart, displayed as [YES (default)] in the options list. For example, a MadCatz TE, the default configuration is to have the turbo/guide portion of the control panel cut, so that the control panel can fit properly. You have the option to select [NO] to prevent cutting these areas.\n\nCut Control Panel? [NO] - If you own a MadCatz TE, and installed a PS360+, you may no longer need the Turbo/Guide area of the control panel, located at top left. This option allows you to remove the Turbo/Guide portion. Please note that you MUST remove the actual control panel on the TE by unscrewing it before applying the plexi, or you risk damaging the plexi. Also, please make certain to select this option if you are also choosing to have artwork printed, or the plexi and artwork won't match.\n\nCut Start Button? [NO] - On some joysticks - such as the Qanba Q4 - the start button is directly on the panel. You can select to have this removed. You can also select this should you desire a panel similar to the Eightarc Fusion or Synthesis series Fightstick, as the start button is moved elsewhere. Again, this option is available on specific joysticks.\n\nCut Middle and/or Bottom Screws? [NO] - Selecting \"no\" on this option allows you to remove the middle top and bottom screw holes on specific joysticks, either for a cleaner appearance or to avoid rubbing your wrist against the screw. Please reconsider this option if you intend to have a full panel etch on your plexi, as etching physically changes portions of the plexi due to heat. In this case, it is best to leave the screw holes in place in order to keep the panel securely positioned.\n\n- Back to topic top\n\nCut Button Inserts\n\nPushbutton manufacturers such as Sanwa, Seimitsu, Crown and GamerFinger have each produced specific models with a clear or translucent plastic cap and flat plunger. These are often used to display a graphical insert, allowing you to enhance the button's appearance. That said, each button manufacturer has designed the artwork cap with a different diameter than their competitors. For example, GamerFinger's artwork cap has a diameter that is slightly larger than Seimitsu or Sanwa. An insert cut for a Sanwa artwork cap will fit loosely when inserted into the GamerFinger artwork cap. This is an undesirable result that can produce a white or colored ring around the insert.\n\nNow, you can choose the button insert cut to match the pushbutton you intend to use. This allows the insert to fit snugly within the cap.\n\nBrands and Model with Artwork Caps\n\nSanwa - OBSC (30mm) | OBSC (24mm)\n\nSeimitsu - PS-14-GN-C (30mm) | PS-14-DN-C (24mm) | PS-14-K (30mm) | PS-14-KN (30mm) | PS-14-DN-K (24mm)\n\nSeimitsu - ALUTIMO SSPS MX 24mm and 30mm\n\nCrown - SDB-201-C, SDB-202 MX (30mm) | SDB-202-MX (24mm)\n\nQanba - GRAVITY 24 and 30mm\n\nGamerFinger - HBFS30 (30mm) |HBFS24 (24mm)\n\nIn some instances, a button brand or model does not have a 24mm equivalent with art cap. In this case, we will cut to the default size of Sanwa 24mm insert.\n\nPlease note that if you later intend to purchase a different button, you may need to get new button inserts or new artwork. If you are uncertain which button you may choose, Sanwa is chosen by default.\n\nButton Cut for Qanba Q2 Glow\n\n24 vs 30mm\n\nWhen processing orders, a frequent mistake we found among new players is choosing the wrong size for action buttons, such as punch and kick.\n\nWithin the fighting game genre, Japanese arcade buttons commonly consist of two diameter sizes: 24 millimeter and 30 milllimeter (mm). In most configurations, 30mm represents your action button. These are front facing, appearing most prominent on your Fightstick control panel. Option button, such as \"Start\", \"Select\", or more recently \"Option\", \"Touch\", or \"Share\" are usually 24mm.\n\nUPDATE: Owners of Neo Geo AES Joysticks will need 24mm pushbuttons instead of 30mm (Thanks SRK's DEZALB)\n\nBelow is a visual representation of a common Fightstick control panel. Throughout this article, we will mark 24mm in green, and 30mm in Orange.\n\nChecking the Proper Size\n\nAnother way that players can misinterpret the pushbutton size is by measuring the pushbutton plunger. Have a look at the diagram at right.\n\nThe plunger - the part that you press down to represent an input - is 25mm or a bit smaller in most 30mm pushbuttons. Often this leads to the conclusion that one needs a 24mm button and not 30mm.\n\nSimilarly measuring the button rim can lead to confusion, as it is intentionally larger than the button hole it is placed in. You don't want to use these measurements. Instead, review the button housing diameter, or the hole the button will be placed in. You can do this with a caliper - a digital caliper is often quite helpful for this and other arcade-related projects.\n\nControl Panel Configuration\n\nMost Fightsticks from MadCatz, Hori, Qanba, and similar will use these two sizes. How the buttons are used will depend on the model joystick that you own. Over time, we'll provide example configurations for specific popular Fightstick models and arcade cabinets using the color key for 24mm (green) and 30mm (orange). We'll also expand the key for future models if another size is introduced, and we offer for sale.\n\nHolograph Patterns\n\nThe following patterns are available. Artwork is printed atop the pattern and its color changing effects will appear underneath."
