First time locked with a landinggear to a base/static grid, second time locked with a connector to a base/static grid and third time attached to a projector on a few pistongrids to drag it out of the printer (big printerplattform etc...).\n\nProblem: whenever i try to dock in one of the mentioned cases with a SECOND ship to the first ship (as mentioned above) on one of their connectors its going nuts and flipping around (the added ship/second ship) . Adding a landing gear next to the connector on the second ship (which is going to dock on the first) is not changing the issue. I can perfectly dock on static grids but hell if i try it on a shipgrid...\n\nWhats wrong here? i remember it should work with no problem. Any settings wrong on idk what?"
