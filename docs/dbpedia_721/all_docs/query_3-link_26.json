        "text": "What I’m asking is, what is your usual procedure against different types of enemies, which ammo types do you actually use and what do you target on the different enemies. I know a bit about the ammo and hit point mechanics now but theres still a lot of things I’m not sure about, so I wanted to know what people actually do practically in their playstyle. I have read the wiki entries of their weak spots, but I have not yet fully identfied all described weak spots on the actual machines, so I work with what I recognize so far. I also use binoculars to see the component view of machines that we have the blueprints of, but the colors in that view still confuse me a bit as it seems inconsistent, what is armor, what is component, and what are the additional colors. If I overlooked some better weak spots or tricks, let me know!\n\nConcerning Ammo: Even though I carry around 7.62 and .50 FMJ AND AP ammo with me all the time, I basically don’t use AP ammo at all. Since I know FMJ is better for components, and I found myself always aiming for those, I kept using those. I tried to destroy the front armor plate of the tank a few times, but never got it off. So it either needed even more bullets, or I’m wrong and it doesn’t actually come off?\n\nI also know hollow and soft point ammo from the sniper rifles and revolver are good for components, but I’m not using those weapons at the moment. Would anyone recommend those over using FMJ 7.62/.50 on components?\n\nRegarding weak point priorities on the different enemies:\n\nWell we dont have to talk about ticks, seekers or runners I think. For the first two I don’t think I would try to aim at anything, and the latter you try to hit the tank on top or just spray.\n\nFor hunters I used to aim a lot at the head, neglecting the shoulders which seem to be an easier target in most cases. Or using Assault Rifles I’m spraying the general area of the head, shoulders, and top weapon. I’m doing this also with FMJ ammo, but I wonder if using AP ammo would yield in better results since you might hit a lot of the chassis, and i read somewhere that AP does more damage on chassis, if that’s true? Also sometimes I shoot at their main weapon, but I’m doing this mostly with a gut decision, I don’t know what the best order of attack would be. Of course if facing their back, I shoot the tick pod or fuel tank.\n\nTanks. As I play always in coop at least with one friend, we have good chances to hit it from behind as well as from the front. Mostly focusing to shoot down the main weapons, with FMJ since those are counting as components, but I have read contradicting information on that. Someone pointed out that the sparks you see when hitting them are yellow, and thus they must count as armor. So now I am unsure which one is better, and I’m not someone that in the heat of battle (esp. with a friend) can keep track of how many bullets I shot into them. So let me know what your approach is for the tank main weapons.\n\nThen after the weapons or of course whenever there is a chance to shoot at the back, it’s the fuel tank, tick pod, and the three battery thingies. and also the top most part of the middle, with the cables coming out. Not sure what part that is, but you can also aim at it from the front and it gives blue sparks (component).\n\nI am also unsure what the hinges on the legs are that the wiki mentions (“the hinge located near the model number”), but I’m guessing those are the “joints” of the topmost leg parts? It is said the tank will be crippled, does this actually mean cannot move at all?\n\nThen from the front usually shoot the two sensors. Does anyone bother shooting down the big armor plate at all?\n\nHarvester: First thing we destroy is the rocket launchers on it’s back. Also using FMJ ammo as they have blue sparks and thus definitely seem to be components for me. But what I’m not sure about is whether it is still of use if the rocket launchers are burning, or if they are already destroyed at that point. I never fully witnessed them disappear entirely.\n\nNext target are either the sensors if you are facing the front, or the fuel cells and tick pod from behind. With the rest of the weakspots I havent really meddled with.\n\nSo that’s how I’m mostly fighting them machines with bullets. I sometimes use emps to get more free easy shots on components, and rarely try to set up mines and traps with boomboxes or radios. But those approaches havent been reliable. If anyone knows a fool proof bait strategy with mines or explosives, let me know ^^\n\nEdit: It might also be interesting what consumables you have mostly in your loadout. I switch around between the flares, fireworks, emps, radios and explosives. More depending on mood or what I have than strategy ^^\n\nIn general shooting off weaponry early is good choice, since guns are big, relatively “soft” hit boxes, that taking big chunk of total health upon destruction. Also it makes much easier to fight.\n\nAs for harvester - destroyed rocket pods are burning.\n\nHP/SP ammo usually very good choice for taking out components (guns included), but automatic guns with FMJ still has better damage per minute and more reliable choice if ammo isn’t an issue (which is very abundant). I usually use this ammo for trickshots at weak points (accuracy allows that).\n\nAP ammo is more about destroying “armor” parts (light blue in component view if blueprint is available; blacked out in IR view) and punching through chassis to hit components. For example that Tank hinge at shoulder - AP allows to hew out blue sparks from virtually any angle, while rest ammo types can do the same only by hitting the rim of that bearing cover (especially tricky to do in frontal projection). Shotgun slug is considered AP ammo, with worst ballistics and is not tracer.\n\nShredding through tank’s frontal plate is worth it, again, when ammo is plenty and covers are safe enough. There’s four inner components that are easy to mince with MORE DAKKA. Tearing off it’s guns should be high priority if it somewhat restrained by environment - without guns it’ll try to run you over or fart in your general direction.\n\nTrying to scratch it’s back is more bother than worth it. Big upper box is just bigger from the back and you still can trickshot fuel tank from front. Don’t bother with it’s upper light - AFAIR it is armor component. Lower light/sensor takes the most damage. Knees and armpit boxes are good choices too. AoE weapons is up to you - generally tricky to pick out, but may inflict substantial damage.\n\nHarvesters are a bit harder to tear apart if you screwed up with preparations or let yourself “caught with pants down”. Rocket launchers and barrels are high priority, then it’s AoE weapon, if fight in close proximity. (hips if gas, near knees if blast). Then there’s soft “cheeks” on both sides of drill, then there’s a hole right under it (frontal). Legs have a lot of small “blue sparks hit boxes” consult with component view.\n\nHigh priority for hunters is destroying it’s guns. “headshots” while do most damage are impractical due to head’s size. Better off to shoot side boxes, either through shredding vent covers or at certain angle, where you hit component while bypassing the cover. Fuel tank is also recommended.\n\nAbout gear: my playstyle is “hoard everything, spend everything”.\n\nI cycle guns around based on ammo available, which is in most cases are pistols (heavy ammo), rifles/shotguns (slow burning ammo). I ain’t use SMGs often, since 9mm (smg) quite rare in nature (I mean without carrying one in pockets). As for backup gun is either AK4 or PVG90.\n\nRocket launcher (CarlG) is special case and used more as tactical tool than weapon.\n\nAs for other slots - explody cans are used either as traps when bored or actively planting under disabled machines, them blow it up. Honorable mention goes for small fuel cells planted right under leaping hunter where it about to land.\n\nSmoke is used either for stealth or against tanks to fight in open areas.\n\nFlares are essential, especially when bullfighting against pack of hunters (they and runners ignore smoke).\n\nMines are either as big trap pile detonator or for “flying pie” tactics.\n\n'nades are thrown mostly to interrupt bigger machines (stagger effect on explosion)."
