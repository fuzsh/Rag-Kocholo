So, if it could happen to them, then what makes you think your organization isn't at risk? #SoftwareSecurity goes beyond applications that you download onto your computer/mobile device... It applies to video games, web applications, and more. A secure application - or software - can help users, investors, and stakeholders sleep better at night. Because the software is the part of their infrastructure that is most used - therefore, it's the most attractive vector for hackers to attack. And as a Security Engineer, one of the most important skills that you can learn is how to harden/secure an application or software. This was a great series of lessons by TryHackMe, and I feel much more equipped because of it. #alwaysgrowing #securityengineer #securityanalyst #cybersecurityengineer #webapplicationsecurity #softwaresecurity #owasptop10 #pentest #pentesting #pentester #penetrationtest #penetrationtesting #penetrationtester OWASP® Foundation\n\nIntroduction: I recently had the opportunity to dive into the world of Linux and cybersecurity by completing a room on the TryHackMe platform. It was an exhilarating journey filled with challenges, learning, and personal growth. In this post, I want to share my experiences and insights from the adventure, as well as encourage others to embark on their own Linux learning journey. The Room: The rooms I tackled was titled linux fundamentals 1 , 2 ,3 and master linux , and it was designed to provide hands-on experience with Linux systems. It covered a wide range of topics, from basic Linux commands to more advanced penetration testing techniques. Each task was carefully crafted to enhance my understanding of the Linux operating system and security practices. What I Learned: Linux Basics: The room started with the fundamentals, introducing me to basic Linux commands, file manipulation, and directory navigation. These skills formed the foundation for the challenges ahead. Privilege Escalation: As I progressed, I encountered tasks that required privilege escalation techniques. I learned how to identify vulnerabilities and exploit them to gain root access to a system. It was an eye-opening experience that highlighted the importance of system security. Enumeration: Enumeration is a critical skill in cybersecurity, and the room emphasized its significance. I became adept at discovering open ports, services, and potential entry points through thorough enumeration. Scripting: Scripting is a valuable skill in the cybersecurity field. I honed my Bash scripting abilities to automate repetitive tasks and streamline my workflow, making me a more efficient hacker. Real-World Application: The practicality of the room was remarkable. I felt like a cybersecurity professional, actively applying my knowledge to solve real-world problems and secure systems. Takeaways: Completing this room was a rewarding experience for several reasons: Skill Development: My Linux and cybersecurity skills improved significantly. I now feel more confident navigating and securing Linux systems. Problem-Solving: I developed problem-solving skills and learned to think like an ethical hacker, analyzing systems for vulnerabilities."
