        "text": "I thought I'd take the time to describe a normal evening in vHoF so I can illustrate what's wrong with this trial in specific and ESO in general at the moment. I'm well aware that I'm beating a dead horse here, but since ZOS does not seem to care so far I guess bringing more attention to those problems is necessary.\n\nAfter 15 minutes of searching for replacement, as one of our DDs can't log in anymore and probably has to reinstall the game (see you in two days mate), and a few endless loadscreens we are finally ready to start. Until the first boss everything goes well, but then the real fun begins. Positrox and Negatrix are arguably the most boring to heal bosses in the game but at least no bugs (except for the adds ) here, just a plain and simply burst. Second boss nothing special, AOEs on the teleporters, heavy attack while the tank is pinned, magicka-drain of doom. Over all a pretty boring fight. So we are mindlessly healing and burning our way to the third boss and this is actually a fun one. Not much skill involved as you can't evade the damage anyway, never the less a fast pace and fun fight. Now comes the real torture, endless corridors of nothing but magicka draining beams and spinning blades, just unnecessary and boring. I mean, I get the purpose of traps if they are actually dangerous and can be evaded. But this is just spamming springs and running through.\n\nIn between the worlds longest snare, we do the fourth boss. As always a few random onehits from adds and fire AOEs even though the bosses are not empowered, my FPS drops from 50+ to 10 for some reason, but nothing we can't handle. So after another endless corridor of torture we stand in front of the Assembly General. 107,8 million HP of complete cluster****. After two hours of wiping we gave up. Every time the same bug: Random onehits from feedback with 2 and even 3 terminals down. This is kind of problematic aka. game breaking but for sure we can recover. Nope, the broken hitboxes make it impossible to even touch half of the arena should one of his arms come down and they unavoidably come down when the person keeping them up takes a random 40k feedback to the knee. Between each fight we have at least two disconnects and a desync from time to time. So in conclusion this trail and the Assembly General in particular are just frustrating and depend more on luck then anything else. And it wasn't always like that. Sure the trial was never without bugs though mostly nothing that kept you from completing it, but over the last two weeks it became somewhat unplayable.\n\nI know that many progress players are very unhappy with the games current performance for good reason. ZOS needs to start fixing this mess, as something like that is not acceptable.\n\nEU/PC (GER) - Healermain since 2014 - 50305 Achievement Points - Youtube (PvE Healing Guides, Builds & Gameplay)"
