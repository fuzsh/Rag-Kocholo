I haven’t really added up the cost exactly but I’m pretty sure it comes up around the same price. </blockquote>\n\nNot even close.\n\nIf you going for a DIY Hit Box. Factor in where are you getting your Hit Box <b>case</b> from.\n\nAre you going to get someone else to build you one?\n\nAre you going to modify a existing arcade stick?\n\nAre you going to build your own case?\n\nIf you going for the Building route, factor in cost of all materials and the cost of tools you need but do not.\n\nIf you have to buy a whole lot of expressive power tools that building your own case is not cost effective unless you are going to be building alot of hitbox cases.\n\nJust to make this <b>110% </b>clear\n\nBuying a pre-made Hit Box is no where the same cost as building one. You are not saving money buy going the DIY route. This is a misnomer; you are going to be spending ALOT MORE.\n\nA power drill $30 to $100 for a hand held drill\n\n$300 and up for a drill Press\n\na router $100\n\nwood hand saws - $15-$20 each\n\nPower table saw $500\n\nThat does not include, blades, bits for the drill, bits for the router, rules, a square and other measuring tools, a hammer, wood clamps.\n\nGot a spare $900 for tools you do not own yet. Also factor in do you have the space for all this?\n\n<blockquote class=“Quote” rel=“joec0x”>I have tools, most people posting in this I would assume would. Considering i posted a DIY question, it was implied i have them myself.\n\nas for the case, i was considering going through Tek-Innovations. As for the PCB, the Ps360+ (obvious choice)\n\nany helpful tips or thoughts?\n\nAlso, does the official Hitbox have a mic port or not?</blockquote>\n\nI <u>want to say</u> No to the Mic port. From their internal construction and their choice of securing the PCB to the case, I really want to say no.\n\nExperience has though me to assume nothing (especially on SRK TT). Unless I know the person in question I also assume that they know nothing. I also assume (no offense to anyone) that people are generally lost and are clueless.\n\nLike if it was gahrling asking the question, I have a basic idea what he knows so I can focus more on his questions. If I don’t know the person I have to be more general.\n\nYou be very very surprise how little knowledge people have when posting about DIY projects and most people have no idea what they are getting them selves into.\n\nI am still going to assume you lack the tools and skills considering you already made the first big mistake of D.I.Y. projects. I also remember you as they guy who tried to sell the Mad Catz WWE Brawl stick in tech Talk. Yeah I choose to ignore the rest of that post for a reason.\n\nCost of just buying the item vs the cost of making it your self. Building your self will ether be good but pricy or cheap and it being utter rubbish.\n\nGoing to the official Hit Box is your cheapest option with out sacrificing build quality, please note they glue the PCB into place.\n\nThe thing to remember is you can have 2 of the following 3 but never all 3 things.\n\n*Cheap\n\n*Quality\n\n*Speed/ease\n\nYou can get it done fast and cheap but it be a flimsy POS like what gahrling had stated about the box being flimsy\n\nYou can go Fast and Quality but it not be cheap at all\n\nLast you can go for Quality and being cheap but it take you forever and a day (and only if you are lucky).\n\nLike for example you found someone to make you a metal top panel for a hit box. They do it for you for nothing or at cost, but you are stuck waiting until they are ready at there time table.\n\nI think your best bet is a Tek-innovations case or replacement panel. Keep in mind the top panel will be acrylic and can no take too much abuse.\n\nI rather go modify a existing Mad Catz or Hori case with a replacement panel that to get the all acrylic panel as the base would add some needed strength and weight.\n\nIf you want the best quality for a Hit Box, you ignore the Tek-case (Sorry Art) and go for a wooden case with a top panel being metal or MDF as acrylic can bend, crack and break.\n\nAs for the PCB, remember many PCBs by default lack SOCD filtering, so you ether want to flash that into your PCB or get a SOCD cleaner board.\n\nSOCD cleaner boards\n\nthanks for clearing things up a bit.\n\nall things considered, if i could find one i would just get a replacement panel for my brawl stick. but nobody seems to know where to get one. so if you do, id appreciate a link to it.\n\ni knew id need a sodc cleaner but hadnt looked into that just yet, but im glad you confirmed for me.\n\nas for just buying the hitbox, do you think just buying the HSB cable and drilling into the casing would be an easy fix?\n\nremember, i have access to almost any tool i would need\n\nYou aren’t going to find a panel for a Mad Catz Se or Brawl stick, they are notoriously hard to make for, so not many people will bother.\n\nOkay assuming what tools you do not have you can borrow or what ever.\n\nIf you looking for a existing box, you want one that going to be deep enough for all your parts, even if you going for Japanese parts, plan for Happs size push buttons as you also want room for your PCB.\n\nAnd you want it to be sturdy.\n\nTry to scope out various metal and wooden cases. In most scenarios you probily want to add some plywood or MDF to strengthen and reenforce your box.\n\nKeep in mind many of those aluminum carrying cases you see at game stop is kinda flimsy.\n\nYou need to shop around alot, hit up pawn shops, thrift stores, yard sales and craft stores. Can you stand on a box and jump on it without breaking it, it is a reasonable size, it will work.\n\nI seen a few sticks come out quite well when the right box is used.\n\nTechnically you don’t need the harness but it make wiring easier.\n\nIf you buy the official hit box you don’t need to do any drilling or putting together your own SOCD cleaner (the kits that are sold are unasembled)\n\nWell you think you know what you are doing, don’t talk about it go out there and do it.\n\nIt seems you are not asking for help/advice but arguing with the person that just showed you all the pit falls but what ever.\n\nAlso factor in that the folks who make the official Hitbox buy in bulk which reduce their costs and allows them to make a wider profit margin.\n\nI doubt you are buying push buttons, PCB and other parts in hundreds if not thousands needed for that significant price drop.\n\nhave to took time to calculate your project cost with all the parts and materials you need?\n\nSanwa 30 mm push button 2.99 x 1 = 2.99\n\nSanwa 24 mm push button 2.50 x 14 = 35.00\n\n30 .010 sized quick disconnects ( 2 per button) 0.10 x 30 = 3.00\n\nAkishop PS360+ Multi-Console Joystick PCB 59.95\n\nAkishop PS360+ HSB External Headset jack PCB 7.95\n\n15 Foot Male A-B USB 2.0 Cable 5.00\n\na single spool of 24 to 28 gauge stranded wire (100 ft) 5.00\n\nArt Hobies Plexy case 58.00\n\nTotal 176.89 Not including Shipping and Handling\n\nThat is the bare 100% the minimum you want for your project\n\nNo wire-harness as you are making your own, the bare minimum number of Disconnects (assuming you make zero mistakes)\n\nNo electric tape, zip ties, tech flex, heart shrink, wire anchors or other wire organizers\n\nNot factoring how you going to secure the PCB in the case.\n\nNo Neutrik USB Feed-Through\n\nNo panel art or custom engraving\n\ngoing with the non-transparent Sanwa push buttons\n\nno soldering supplies\n\nYeah the Multi-console Hit Box is $225.00\n\nBut I feel more confidant about the wooden Official Hit Box “falling down a flight of stairs” over a Art Hobies Tek case.\n\nIf throwing controllers down stairs are not you thing, then pounding on the controller real hard because its a Hit Box.\n\nThis Dark guy despite sounding like a real dick head is actually providing some sound logic. I’m in the exact shoes as you joe, right now. I’m going back and forth on getting a hitbox and just making one via art hong. The real peace of mind is that these guys do this for a living. They make hitboxes and are putting their names on every controller. That’s worth a 50 dollar premium at the moment until a better solution comes around, and that’s another thing-- there’s no real viable alternative other than DIY and Hitbox themselves. That’s alright. They put the elbow grease power into making our interests a reality and so it makes sense to pay the premium and give the money to Hitbox. I just wish they provided the ability to dc the console cord.<div><br></div><div>Also, consider that you can still customize artwork and buttons on your Hitbox which I personally plan to do.</div>\n\n<blockquote class=“Quote”>\n\n<div class=“QuoteAuthor”><a href=\"/profile/30094/Kid%20Tiger\">Kid Tiger</a> said:</div>\n\n<div class=“QuoteText”>This Dark guy despite sounding like a real dick head is actually providing some sound logic. <br></div>\n\n</blockquote>\n\nYeah I do know I come off as an ass, but I don’t like to sugar coat things ether as it serves no one in the end. I found while being an <strike>ass</strike> straight-forwards does not make me popular it allows my words to sink in more and you more likey think what I just said.<br>Long story short if you want custom you get what you paid for.<br>\n\nThey fail to install it because they are a small company and adding convenience features sadly would up the cost even more and hurt sales likely. They don’t have a set up that allows them to shave costs on everything with mass production assembly lines (Madcatz TEs are very cheap to produce, Hitboxes currently are not). They’re aware of many small feature requests and the only thing hindering it is the logistics of building a Hitbox currently.\n\nGoing forward Hitbox will inevitably encounter a need to evolve with the next gen consoles, so we could see mergers with other companies and a redesign eventually add new functionality. It’ll be a while so a current official Hitbox is still a great investment. As well their SOCD settings are near optimal and you want to make sure yours is rigged similar if doing 2D"
