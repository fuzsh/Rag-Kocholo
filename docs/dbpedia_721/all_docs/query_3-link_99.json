        "text": "Now we can really see the hit reg issues. First 5 mins I was merking all the filthy peasants. I noticed full shotgun rounds doing 0 damage. Blood goes everywhere, shotgun down skulks throat. Test your game please. AND FIX IT.\n\nLike I've always said : if you can provide video evidence of actual hit registration issues you will win front page credits, a copy of the game, and some other goodies from me. (video must be 720p 30 fps minimum, h264 compression, and net_stats enabled)\n\nUntil then, my guess is you are either missing the tight hit boxes, or experiencing high latency /low tick rate.\n\nYeah... 26 ping. And I guess everyone else with high end gaming gear just makes this all up. Get a 120-144hz screen with 1ms input lag and you will see how fail hit reg is on all servers. I guess you would have to play the game though. QQ Does the hitbox not cover the models? almost like you stuck some boxes inside the model that are paper thin. That or hit reg fails sup[er hard and you need to code better.\n\nGive me the right to use an aimbot for a day and you can have all the videos of hit reg fail you want. DEAL?\n\nThe hitbox issue is a hard one to properly measure and quantify so I won't try to do that. I'm an European player playing mostly on US servers due to better community and teamplay there (everyone speaks the same language, and people tend to be more chilled out). My avg ping is 130-140ms.\n\nIn build 254, my alien play was rather decent (actually, it was better than that, with skulk kdr often hitting 10+).\n\nNow it's crap. The issue seems to heavily correlate with moving targets. That's why the marine strafe jumping made it so much worse. I do understand the strafe jumping, being a 'trick movement', is supposed to allow good marines to defend themselves. But there are many 'perfect' hits, where you see the enemy player model right where it should be, you bite, nothing happens, you missed. And to add insult to injury, often you can see blood being drawn, and the marine grunting being hurt. In previous builds, there were rarely situation when you died and was like 'WTF, those were three perfect bites!'. Now it happens all the times.\n\nBased on my on my experience, (way back from NS1 tech demo :P, and NS2 betas), I would say, something is off.\n\nBut to be fair, there may be other factors here. Reinforced' issues with input might have thrown me off my play. The player base dropped a bit, and higher end players stayed in the game. Since the code says the hitboxes are ok, it might be a subjective issue.\n\nEither way, I still love the game. And I'm incredibly happy I don't have to reboot to windows to play couple of rounds. I'm getting my shadow badge ASAP. The linux version is well worth it.\n\nGreat patch guys. 256 broke the game for 40 minutes or so (non-native resolution bug) but a workaround was found really fast, and then it was promptly fixed which was good. I'm above all glad to have all the input lag fixed. Game finally feels as smooth as 251. I've been beyond frustrated with Reinforced, so it's just nice to have it all over with.\n\nJust avoid major engine re-work patches for deadlines. Switching to SDL2.0, OpenGL, is a ton of work, and putting a deadline on such changes that inherently are liable to massive amounts of instability can be a bad idea. I'm assuming you guys won't need to make such changes again, but it's something to keep in mind. You could've released the Reinforced content without any engine changes and nobody would've had all the instability and gameplay issues.\n\nBiodome plays quite well now. It's still not as fast as the other maps, but it's closer. I've finally gotten the chance to actually play it without the massive performance issues, and it's a fun map. I've only had a few decent games on it so not much room for judging, but I think it has a lot of potential, and I like the deviation from the standard map format by making it taller. Makes the game more fun over all with more variety. Whether having such a map is balanced or not is another story, but we won't find out unless we experiment with new designs right? I personally really like it as it actually feels like playing on a different map instead of just looking like it, especially with the lerk. Looks great too.\n\nOn Hit Registration:\n\nOften when I start calling BS on bites/bullets landing properly, I pull up net_stats and find that the server is unable to handle the game (tickrate drops down from 30 to 10-20).\n\nThis is very common on US servers (I'm on West Coast USA, and wont play above 100 ping), and I've actually taken to joining random populated servers, confirming tickrate drops, and then letting all (usually 24) players know that the lag, rubberbanding, and hitreg issues are caused by the server being bad, not the game.\n\nThis is why I mostly try to play on the KKG servers, i don't (for the most part) have any server related issues and gameplay is smooth and hitreg is good.\n\nMost of these players are greens, who most likely would not stay if they thought the issue was the game and not the server.\n\nIn short, if (when?) server performance is improved, I believe that most complaints about hitreg will go away.\n\nP.S. Hitboxes COULD be increased in size a bit to compenstate. The hit area being the model itself is tighter than most games I've played (bullets going through the skulks legs, for example"
