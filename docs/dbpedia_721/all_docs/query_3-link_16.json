        "text": "Introduction[]\n\nThis page explains about the several weaknesses for each Abductor.\n\nAbductors are vulnerable towards two types of damages: Elemental and the Damage-Type of the weapon.\n\nUsing this knowledge sufficently in battle will deal extreme damage to Abductors, enabling a player with a lower strenght weapon to complete each Operation in the Contributions Directory more easily, gaining better materials to upgrade a weapon either by Level or Modules.\n\nThis page will also help picking the right modules for weapons or refining the playstyle.\n\nFor example: Adding a Leg-Component-Damage (XL)-Module to a Projectile-Damage weapon is considered a way to deal with legs, but adding this module to a Cutting-Damage or Impact-Damage Weapon instead will increase the damage expotentially (considering elemental weakness), breaking legs more easily.\n\nUsing a Head-Component-Damage (XL) on a Projectile-Damage Weapon will increase the damage when shooting the head of each Abductor or using Arm-Component-Damage (XL) to sever Upper Arms of Bipeds/Quadrupeds/Red Rage with a Cutting-Damage weapon.\n\nAbductor Hitboxes[]\n\nEach Abductor is comprised by several hitboxes, scattered along it's body. Most of the hitboxes are automatically targeted using the Lock-on Feature, to allow easy usage of the Thorn. Everytime a hitbox is locked on, the color of the targeting ring changes.\n\nRed means this component can be severed with a Light Melee or Flare Knife.\n\nYellow means the ABD can be pulled down with the thorn more easily.\n\nBlue means Pod or \"Gauge Break\" using a light melee.\n\nBut there are also hitboxes which cannot be targeted, making it hard to distinct at first unless it is destroyed.\n\nTable Explaination[]\n\n(text here) Most of the tables are incomplete right now or straight missing.\n\nAbductor Tables[]\n\nHigh refers to maximum damage, stylized with a red slash (melee) or splash (ranged) when the enemy is hit. This is also notable while attacking the Head of Human-Type Enemies and Accessories (PvP, Bots)\n\nModerate refers to moderate damage, stylized with a yellow slash (melee) or splash (ranged) when the enemy is hit.\n\nWeak means very low damage, with no splash, except only the elemental effect on the weapon.\n\nTBD means this combination is not yet tested.\n\nTests can be done with weapons bought with Entitlement Points from Zakka, as most of those don't have elements.\n\nAbductor: All-Purpose Biped[]\n\nABD: Part Damage:\n\nCutting Damage:\n\nImpact Damage:\n\nPiercing Damage:\n\nProjectile Targetable Head Moderate High High High Yes Neck Shield TBD TBD TBD Weak No Pod TBD High High Moderate Yes Shoulder Blades Moderate High High High No Upper Arm High?

Moderate Weak No Upper Leg Moderate Moderate Moderate Weak No Lower Leg Moderate Moderate Moderate Weak Yes Foot Moderate Moderate Moderate Weak No Attachments High Moderate Moderate Moderate Yes\n\nNotes:\n\nThe shoulder blades are located on the back side of the ABD and count as Head.\n\n-\n\nAbductor: Carrier Biped[]\n\nABD: Part Damage:\n\nCutting Damage:\n\nImpact Damage:\n\nPiercing Damage:\n\nProjectile Targetable Head TBD High High High No Antenna TBD TBD TBD TBD No Pod (All) TBD High High TBD Yes Front Shield TBD TBD TBD TBD No Back Blades TBD TBD TBD TBD No Blade Carrier TBD TBD TBD TBD No Hip TBD TBD Moderate TBD No Upper Leg TBD TBD Moderate TBD No Lower Leg TBD TBD Moderate TBD Yes Foot Moderate?

After removal, the remains are the \"Inner Wing\".\n\n-\n\nAbductor: Paradoxa / Type-S[]\n\nABD: Part Damage:\n\nCutting Damage:\n\nImpact Damage:\n\nPiercing Damage:\n\nProjectile Targetable Head TBD TBD TBD TBD Yes Neck (break Head first) TBD TBD TBD TBD No Center-Core High TBD TBD TBD No Pod TBD TBD TBD TBD Yes Leg (Armor) TBD TBD TBD Weak Yes Claw of Leg TBD TBD TBD TBD No?
