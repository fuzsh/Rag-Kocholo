        "text": "The \"Stickless Arcade Stick\" Thread.\n\nIt seems wrong to discuss competing/custom products in the Hitbox thread.\n\nThis thread is dedicated to the use/discussion/learning of these controllers outside the realm of the Hitbox.\n\nI've got a custom build on its way to me now. It's a 6 button instead of 8, but the left hand layout is nearly identical.\n\nHow have y'all been liking these? What do you think about their impact on The Scene?\n\nWhat first interested me in them was precision. You won't end up trying for a dragon punch and getting a fireball because of a slight error on your part as long as you know how to operate the controller. Now, you could say the same about knowing how to use a joystick - you should get the DP if you go for it. That's fair, but you're still dealing with Operator Error even at the highest levels of execution.

My older hori sticks all work with windows 7 x64 fine.\n\nAfter installing the official m$ Xbone controller driver the status of the stick changes from \"unknown hw\" to \"xbox gaming device\". However the stick itself nor the buttons are recognised in either ultra SF4, xpadder or any emulator i tried.\n\nThere is no hori driver as of now. Did anyone manage to get this stick to work on windows? Is there any hack, inf, or any solution available anywhere? Thx.\n\n↧\n\nUndamned's USB Decoders (USB to JAMMA, etc.) !\n\nIntro:\n\nWell, folks, it's been a long time coming, but I'm really close to finally getting these things out there and into your hands!\n\nDescription:\n\nThis is the opposite of boards like Toodles' Cthulhu or the PS360 which take the button/joystick wire signals and turn them into USB. This takes input from your USB 360 or PS3 controller and turns that into button/joystick wire signals. You could use this to control any number of projects from Superguns to robotics, to anything you can imagine that you'd like to control with your digital 360 or PS3 joystick!\n\nThese are essentially the same circuit and firmware as that of the UD-CPS2 (ran at multiple major events including ST Games @ EVO, The Fall Classic, etc.).\n\nTarget price is $35 for the Screw Terminal version and $40 for the DB15 version.\n\nScrew Terminal Version Features:\n\n- Terminal Blocks for solder free wiring (signal layout intentionally similar to MC Cthulhu so you can mate them for fun things like TE stick on SNES)\n\n- USB A Socket\n\n- Alternate header for USB signals - for people who don't to use the on-board USB socket\n\n- Indicator LED - bi-color, red/green\n\n- Alternate header for LED signals - for people who don't to use the on-board LED\n\n- Pull-Up Selection Jumper - allows for pulling button/joystick signals up to +5V or +3.3V, depending on the application\n\n- Player Select Jumpers - tell the joystick to light up the appropriate controller LED (can be set for P1-P4)\n\n- Custom button mapping - for 6-8 action buttons\n\n- Firmware can be updated via USB for future features/improvements\n\nHistory:\n\nHere's what @Rufus did with a couple boards which were used at SoCal Regionals, early last year:\n\n(sweet 3D printed case by @Rufus not included)\n\n(running on a supergun at SoCal Regionals 2013)\n\nFuture:\n\nI will continue to improve the firmware features as I have time.\n\nLet me know if you have any ideas or suggestions!\n\nResources:\n\nUser Manuals / Firmware - http://udgametech.blogspot.com/p/firmware.html\n\nOrdering:\n\nhttp://www.paradisearcadeshop.com (search for \"undamned\")\n\nhttps://www.akishop.jp (search for \"usb decoder\")\n\n-ud\n\n↧\n\nNES Controller Hack for the Sega Genesis\n\nI saw Videos on YouTube about Hacking NES Controllers for the Master System/Atari 2600/7800\n\nBut the Genesis is hard to do with the Multiplexer Chip, I ask here..I knowpeople here for Mod fornewer systems,\n\nI know it work only for 3 Button Games\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nCerberus: Unleash the hellhound in your arcade stick\n\nCheesy title.. I know >: )\n\nThe Cerberus is, ultimately, a revamp of my TEasy Strike/TEasy Mod. It's goal is to provide the user with solderless modding options for their MadCatz Xbox 360 T.E. arcade sticks to allow them access to PlayStation 3 consoles for \"dual\" functionality in a single stick.\n\nHowever, it may overall result in the same basic principle to give the user a dual mod with next to no effort, it's method for accomplishing that is far different. The TEasy Strike/Mod used spring loaded pins to access the original signals, the Cerberus does not. Instead, it utilizes undermounted sockets that interface with the original board. This method allows for a more solid installation, and also is actually easier for the user to do since there is little alignment required. The top right of the board has an alignment hole to see the top right most mounting screw through to give you one alignment point, as well as the board being thinner than the original Xbox 360 PCB so that the user can actually see the connection's alignment while it's happening.\n\nThe Cerberus board mounted to the original Xbox360 enabled PCB.\n\nAlignment hole to view the mounting screw.\n\nAlso pictured are solderable points for Ground and VCC for usage with other modifications such as LEDs and optical joysticks.\n\nUser’s view when installing, you can actually see the connection for instant feedback on alignment.\n\nAs you can probably tell, the USB cable connection points look different this time as well. They are in fact IDC terminals (Insulation Displacement Connection), which make it so that you only have to remove the outer sheath of the USB cable. The 4 wires (VCC, D+, D-, GND) do not have to be stripped. Simply inserted into the terminals and closed tightly with your fingers, you don’t even need a flat head screwdriver like the TEasy did to punch the terminals down. They’re smaller, sleeker, and do a bang up job for ease of installation. Although they are easier to use, it’s good to note that extra care should be taken to ensure they are down all the way, which I will show an example of in the Installation section.\n\nIDC Terminal front view. Note that “USB IN” is only labeled on the prototype, you will see “X360 IN” for this particular pair in the final version.\n\nNow, the name Cerberus is not just picked because it sounds cool (although I do really like it). The PCB does in fact have 3 accessible faces for the user.\n\nBottom Face – Accesses the original Xbox 360 PCB\n\nTop Face – Accesses the JST connector harnesses that go to the rest of the arcade stick.\n\nInner Face – This is a special advanced face that the user can access by soldering directly to.\n\nThe third (inner) face, has been specially planned out for advanced users. You may notice that all of the components are centered into a small area of the board. The reason is shown below:\n\nThird face shown, the silk screen outline denotes cut lines. The gold pads are solderable for advanced usage.\n\nThe top/bottom board components that allow the PC/PS3 controller circuit to function are smashed into a tiny area to give the more savvy user the ability to literally cut the board down to the size of a quarter. This allows the user to install this board into not just it’s standard function of MadCatz Xbox 360 T.E arcade sticks, but into virtually anything.\n\nBottom side for easy soldering, the cut away section to the left.\n\nTop side, denotes what’s left after cutting, the heart of this board.\n\n*It should be noted that although the advanced operation is available, once you begin cutting the Cerberus PCB you void any and all warranty/support. This is for advanced users with the abilities required to perform such modifications.\n\n*Also note that if you are using the cut down board and wish to use the Player LED signals. They are controlled via open collector configuration for usage with Common Anode LEDs. There are 4 0402 resistor positions (R2, R3, R4, R5) that you may wish to use. The original components are 0 (zero) Ohm resistors, so jumpers. Do NOT connect LEDs directly to these signals as you could cause irreparable damage to your setup.\n\nInstall FAQ Section:\n\nSpoiler:\n\nFirst make sure the pins are lined up nicely and try again. You can see where the pins are rubbing into the plastic of the connector on the Cerberus and adjust by that. Then if that doesn't work try out what mistcore has done below:\n\nThis was my solution to installing the Cerberus successfully.\n\nThe JLF connector was rubbing up against that white guide, so I snipped the side of the guide.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe Cerberus‘ list of current features are as follows:\n\nPC/PS3 Functionality\n\nPlayer indications for PS3 (Player numbers will appear on the guide ring of your arcade stick after a standard instllation)\n\nLS/RS control by switching the control panel of the arcade stick\n\nAuto-detection on supported systems\n\nForced passthrough mode for Xbox360 mode. Hold 1P (x) while plugging into allow this.\n\nForced PC/PS3 mode for debug/forced mode on PC. Hold 1K (a) while plugging in. (FW 1.01)\n\nS+S=H ability on both PS3/360. Pressing a dedicated Home button will disable this. (FW 1.01)\n\nUpdatability through a USB bootloader for any firmware upgrades/bug fixes in the future. Hold START while plugging into your PC to access this mode.\n\nUpgrading your firmware\n\nTODO – Firmware update section\n\nFor those who know how you can upgrade the board via Atmel's FLIP DFU. The chip is an Atmega32U4\n\nFirmware Downloads:\n\nv1.01\n\nAdded code for S+S=H with a ~1/3s delay, dedicated home will disable the function. Will show up on new plugins with 1.01 as the version.\n\nAlso gave it a forced PC/PS3 mode, use LK to do so.\n\nArcade Stick Compatibility\n\nDue to the measurement based install of the Cerberus. It will only fit SSF4 T.E. arcade sticks and newer. This means round 1/2 and SE sticks are not compatible. Obviously the cut down board does not follow this rule.\n\nFor quick reference if your stick is compatible, look on the PCB. If there is a KGND signal on the top row, it is compatible. The ONLY exception to this rule is BrawlSticks which are not compatible.\n\nQuck Reference List of some compatible sticks, variants of these exist and more than these are compatible:\n\nMadcatz SSF4 TE (A.K.A. TE-S)\n\nChun Li Blue\n\nBlazBlue\n\nSoul Calibur V\n\nFightstick PRO\n\nFightstick V.S.\n\nTekken Tag Tournament 2 TE-S+\n\nMadCatz Major League Gaming TE-S joystick\n\n*For the Fightstick PRO and the Soul Calibur V sticks, an extra step or two is required. Please see the installation section for details.\n\nWhen you purchase a Cerberus, you will receive the following:\n\n1 x Cerberus PCB with reference sheet for installation.\n\nAssembled Cerberus ($40.00) :\n\nAdvanced Cerberus (Advanced Users, Special Request ONLY, $30.00):\n\nEasy print reference for the bottom of the board\n\nUnfortunately I pulled a stupid and when I went to process the board files, I used the wrong file to do so. Luckily the only thing that is botched is the bottom designators, the silk screen still remains. This will only affect advanced users, since the top silk screen/labels are all picture perfect and have been improved upon since last build.\n\nI will make a downloadable/printable image that has these designators for easy reference, they just won’t be ON the board this time, sorry guys.\n\nOne possible extra use for the advanced version is a cheap fix for a 360 TE that has a busted PCB. Just remove it and swap it with the half assembled one, and voila you have a working stick again. With a little fiddling you can get this to work with round 1/2′s for a fix also since it’s no longer reliant on attaching to another PCB.\n\nHead over to the Cerberus page of my website for the latest updates/downloads/install notes.\n\n↧\n\nDiodes basics 101\n\nDisclaimers:\n\nIt is the end user's responsibility to see to and to carry out proper implementation their own repairs and modifications. Ultimately the end users hold responsibility for how they implement their own repairs.\n\nThis guide assumes you are familiar with basic understanding of electricity and than you can build a simple electronic circuit. I am only going to cover the basics and what fits in the preview of Tech Talk.\n\nWhat is a Diode?\n\nThe ideal diode is to control the direction of current-flow. Current passing through a diode can only go in one direction, called the forward direction. Current trying to flow the reverse direction is blocked. They’re like the one-way valve of electronics. –Sparkfun\n\nThat a Diode has low (ideally zero) resistance to the flow of current in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other. –Wikipedia\n\nA Diode can be made from a vast selection of materials, the actual semiconductor as well as the outer case.\n\nWhat type or diodes are out there?\n\nRegular/Signal Diodes\n\nZener Diode - useful in creating a reference voltage or voltage stabilization\n\nDiode Rectifier – often used for reverse voltage protection\n\nBridge rectifier (also known as a diode bridge) – often used to converts AC to DC, can be purchase as a single component or made from 4 or more diodes.\n\nSchottky Diode - known for their low forward voltage drop and a very fast switching action\n\nLight Emitting Diode or LED – used for low voltage light. Some LEDs produce infrared or ultraviolet light instead of visible light.\n\nPhotodiode – a Diode that converts light into electrical current. Traditional solar cells are an example of a photodiode. So are Diode light sensors.\n\nThermal Diode – use to electronically monitor temperature\n\nWhy we [at Tech Talk] should care about Diodes?\n\nOther than the obvious LEDs for lighting, diodes are often also used for pad hacks, rectifiers on power supplies and other applications when we want to electrically isolate something.\n\nHow to “wire up” a diode?\n\nEvery diode has two (2) terminals and they are polarized. The two terminals are the anode (+) and cathode (-). Current flows from the anode end to the cathode, but not the other direction.\n\nAs you see in the image above their is the symbol for diodes use in circuit diagrams as well as two illustrated examples of a diode.\n\nThe stripe on a diode identify the cathode end of the Diode.\n\nPad Hacks\n\nSome PCBs for Dual-Mods require diodes to be installed. The Diode is soldered to the signal line/pad/terminal of the PCB with the other end going with that button signal line to the rest of your Dual mod.\n\nThe anode (-) end of the diode is to be soldered to the PCB and the cathode end going towards your buttons.\n\nFor your particular board please address your boards relevant guide/thread.\n\nThirdparty PS4 Padhack options - http://forums.shoryuken.com/discussion/194825/third-party-ps4-padhack-options/p1\n\nFor those who don't know what diode to use, almost any normal diode would do. You can get away with using a Zener, Schottky or rectifier diode.\n\nDon't worry about the amperage for the diode as the PCB should operate in lower range that the maximum amperage for most diodes.\n\nI recommend a simple signal diode, examples are Digikey, part # : 568-1360-2-ND or Mouser Part #: 771-1N4148-T/R\n\nDiodes can also be used in conjunction with other components to make a PCB that not common ground to be compatible.\n\nLED Lights\n\nThe two terminals of a LED still have the same designations as other diodes, a anode and cathode end but there markings are different.\n\nAlmost always the Longer leg of the LED is the Anode and the shorter leg the Cathode terminal. The LED it self will also have a flat side indicating the cathode side.\n\nSMD LEDs will have a mark with resemblance to the symbol for diode denoting the cathode end.\n\nYou also always want to include a resistor with your LED wired to the cathode end of the LED. This will prevent the LED from burning out\n\nYou can follow Ohms Law (V = IR) to find the resistance needed. So we follow the formula R = (Vs - Vf) / If R = Resistance in Ohms\n\nVs = Supply Voltage (ex. 3.3V)\n\nVf = Forward Voltage or Voltage Drop\n\nIf = LED Current Rating (ex. 20mA or 0.02A)\n\nOr you can use a Online LED Calc http://bfy.tw/1qXp\n\nForward or drop voltage should be included in your LEDs data sheet or packaging. Some will give both a min and max values, use the average between these two.\n\nTypically the forwards voltage goes by light temperature or color\n\nThe Supply voltage is the voltage your supplying from your board or batteries.\n\nYou can cheat with this guide if you do not know or ca not find the forward voltage but this is not 100% accurate and is a generalization of what require for each color.\n\nAs LEDs from different manufacturers will have different specs with different forward voltages.\n\nThere also guides online to how to find your Forward voltage for a LED.\n\nOnce you find your resistance value needed know that you can go with a higher Ohm resistor with the only side effect being how bright the light is.\n\nYou never want to go with a lower Ohm resistor. So for example if you came up on the math needing a 43 ohm resistor but can't find a 43 ohm resistor you can use the next closest rounded up like a 50 ohm resistor.\n\nI come back and edit the guide later, if you see something wrong PM me so I can make any changes.\n\n↧\n\nMadCatZ PS3 TE FightStick: PC - Xp- vista- win7 32-64bit (read 1st post)\n\nguide for users having trouble with The PS3 TE/SE and there PC's\n\ntips\n\nalso if you run into problems try disconnecting other usb devices and try plug the stick in to the actual usb port.\n\nif using a hub try plugging it in directly onto your computer\n\nNote:\n\nplease play around with your usb connections do not plug the TE into any sort of hub.\n\nhaving discovered not all chipsets support the ps3 TE/Se this is what you can do if your PS3 TE/SE does not work.\n\nthe PS3 TE is only compatible with UHCI (Universal Host Controller Interface), which is an Intel originated proprietary standard and far from universal.

There are 3 new xb1 third party controllers that were released this month. Two are made by PowerA: Xbox1 Spectra ($50) and Xbo1 mini ($40). One is made by PDP: Xbox1 Rockcandy ($40)\n\n[update 2/3/2015] Added Horipad for xb1 to the list.\n\nI will separate the info of each controller into the next three posts. I'll leave the first post as a summery and info for the trigger inversion.\n\nRockcandy Pros\n\n-Cheapest pad other than the mini.\n\n- Comes with long white micro usb cable that has a breakaway end.\n\n- Comes with 3 day Xbox Live Gold\n\n- Comes with $10 PDP reward card...what that means IDK yet.\n\n- Has an onboard micro usb jack.\n\nRockcandy Cons\n\n- Triggers need inverting\n\n- Size is in between the other two\n\n- Much like the MS pad it has two pcbs that connect together. Better to remove the top pcb as you'll want to solder to the TP on the bottom.\n\nMini Pros\n\n- Cheapest pad other than the rockcandy.\n\n- Contact spots are easily read on front. Has alt TP on back, but labels aren't obvious\n\n- Smallest pcb\n\n- Can get cool colored usb cables\n\nMini Cons\n\n- Triggers need inverting\n\nSpectra Pros\n\n- Can be hacked to also add led effects to clear buttons. Not as advanced as using a separate led controller board, but its better then nothing.\n\n- Contact spots are labeled on front and for alt TP on the back\n\n- Dpad pcb can be easily removed.\n\nSpectra Cons\n\n- Retail price is more expensive than the other two pads.\n\n- Both sets of triggers and shoulder buttons need to be inverted. Not really that big an issue if using hex inverters though.\n\n- Largest size pcb out of the three.\n\nHoripad Pros\n\n- No trigger inverting.\n\n- Easy solder points.\n\n- Pricing matches others.\n\n- Has IR leds.\n\nHoripad Cons\n\n- Shape is kind of weird?\n\n- Most likely have to order online.\n\nThe winner is the Horipad if you can get a hold of one as not having to do a trigger inverting is going to be more useful for most people. Otherwise its a toss up between the mini and rockcandy. Pretty much the rockcandy has a better deal if you buy it new as you get the extra lil freebies plus the onboard micro usb jack is nice too. The mini might be easier for people to solder to though.\n\nTrigger inversion:\n\nSince the triggers on all three pads are active high we will need to add a hex inverter to make them active low. We can reuse the same method that was used on the madcatz 360 pads that also had active high triggers. Note that in Toodle's schematic he used the A/Y pair 1 and 2. I will be using pair 1 and 6 to make wire routing easier.\n\nI'm using the 74HCT04N chip. Pins are labeled.\n\nI'll be using the dead-bug setup. Since its on its back all the pins will be flipped. It is important to remember this.\n\nHere is an example of the 10k ohm resistors soldered to the pins.\n\nHer is an example of 10k ohm SMD resistors soldered instead.\n\nExample of how it would be wired up to a Rockcandy pad. 1A would be wired to the sticks RT button and 6A would be wired to the sticks LT button.\n\n↧\n\nBuying a new laptop. What specs should i look for?\n\nI'm mostly going to use it for heavy web browsing, stream to twitch with a external capture device, and minimal video editing. Basically, capture, trim and upload it to YouTube.

Please read this first post for up-to-date Hit Box information!\n\n[media=youtube]dGU1d-cmtuQ[/media]\n\nhttp://www.hitboxarcade.com\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/hitboxes\n\nVisit our Super Street Fighter IV Hit Box Thread\n\nFAQ\n\nSpoiler:\n\n1. What is the Hit Box?\n\nThe Hit Box all-button controller, AKA the \"Stickless Stick,\" is a game controller specifically designed for fighting games. We replaced the joystick with directional buttons that are controlled by your fingers.\n\n2. Why buttons?\n\nBy using 4 directional buttons controlled by 4 fingers, you gain:\n\n- Increased input speed\n\n- Consistent inputs yield fewer mistakes\n\n- Exclusive control over your movement\n\n- No travel time inputting directions\n\n- Button techniques apply to movement and special inputs (plinking, piano, double tap, slide)\n\n- Game-specific features such as SSFIV input shortcuts (such as walking dragon punches)\n\n- No unintentional inputs such as accidental jumps\n\n- No arm/wrist motion\n\n- Stays put in your lap\n\n3. Are those smaller buttons than normal?\n\nYes. We use 24mm Sanwa pushbuttons with exception to the 'Up' button, which is 30mm. They are highly sensitive buttons and work perfectly. 24 mm buttons are able to be brought closer together and fit the natural curve of the human hand. When the button spread is closer together, players find all buttons directly at their finger tips with no hand-hovering.\n\n4. Can I still execute throws and focus attacks on this smaller layout?\n\nYes.\n\n5. What about plinking and double tapping my combo links?\n\nOf course.\n\n6. Why have a shared jump button for your thumbs?\n\nIt is larger than the other buttons so both thumbs can access \"Up\" depending on player preference. By utilizing this, you can perform advanced \"joystick\" motions easily. Tri-jumps and Tiger Knee inputs are much faster and more accurate. It also makes many Just-Frame inputs incredibly easy.\n\n8. Who is this for? Do I need keyboard experience?\n\nWhile it appears to share the most common ground with a keyboard, Hit Box is a balance between Joystick, Pad, and Keyboard together. You dont need background in any controller to appreciate the Hit Box: Anyone can use it!\n\n9. Can I still do everything I can do on my joystick?\n\nEverything and more.\n\n10. What about Hadokens and Dragon Punches and SPDs?\n\nYes. Quickly and accurately.\n\n11. What about \"______'s ________ combo\"?\n\nYes.\n\n12. Is there a learning curve?\n\nThe learning curve is creating fast, new memory in your fingers. It doesn't take long. This also gets rid of old bad habits too!\n\n13. Are these for advanced players only?\n\nNo! The benefits of these boxes can be appreciated by everyone from the beginning player to the most advanced tournament player. The whole purpose of the Hit Box is to aide your fundamentals and build your foundation so that you can focus on what actually matters in a match: your opponent.\n\n14. What happens when you hold the Left and Right buttons together?\n\nLeft + Right = Neutral. Your character will stand still. No charging or blocking occurs.\n\n15. Can I hold Left and Right to block cross ups?\n\nNo. Left + Right = Neutral; you will get hit in the face.\n\n18. Can I walk forward and charge a sonic boom?\n\nNo.\n\n19. Can I hold Back and perform shoryuken motions?\n\nNo. Left + Right = Neutral.\n\n20. Is \"Left + Right = Neutral\" useless?\n\nNo! Left + Right is the basis for many advanced techniques that will make your life easier!

I ask because there are certain sidescroller games that are Xbox Controller Compatible like Shantae and Bloodrayne that work great with my Razer Atrox Xbox One stick. But my Qanba Q1 ps3/PC arcade stick is unrecognizable. So I need to know if the PS360+ will work with these games. Please and thank you.\n\n↧\n\nMad Catz Arcade FightStick Tournament Edition Parts & Accessories\n\nHi everyone. MarkMan from Mad Catz here!\n\nIf you didn't know, Mad Catz has a bunch of unique solutions for modding and customizing your Tournament Edition FightSticks! Today, we just announced our side panel availability in both the original TE style and the TE 'S' style.\n\nCheck out our parts store here: http://store.gameshark.com/listCategoriesAndProducts.asp?idCategory=328\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know!\n\n↧\n\nArcade Sticks with detachable Cable?\n\nHow many are there?\n\nAFAIK there is the Razer Atrox Xbox One and the Mad Catz TE2. Are there any else?\n\nI'm asking because the cable of my Mayflash v2 broke. Cramming it inside the little side compartment wasn't the healthiest for it and now I gotta replace it. I know it's easy if you know how to solder but I dont have any experience with that and I think my next stick should have detachable cables.\n\nThanks!\n\n↧\n\nauto detect\n\nHas anyone figured out how to do this on the TE2?

Now the only question if whether to continue with the yellow/gold logo, or revert to plain old white.\n\nCurrent color selection can be seen in the link below.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/6GmKs#0\n\nI'll make a decision in about a week or two.\n\nShirts now available for order.

Almost every (quality) retail plastic stick has a metal panel on either the top or bottom but not always both, and almost every custom made wooden stick doesn't have a metal panel at all. This could be the most solid, sturdy retail built stick ever made. Perhaps only the Hori VLX models would rival the durability of this stick, and that has plastic sides. It's extremely unlikely any more wood base models will be produced by Eightarc/Qanba due to the issues of mass producing wooden sticks.\n\nQanba Q1\n\n-Qanba Q1 Cut 360 White\n\n-Qanba Q1 Cut PS3 Black\n\n(Unsure of official titles)\n\nPHOTOS: TOP/BOTTOM/INTERIOR/PCB/PCB PINOUT/CLAMPS/GATES/SCREWS:\n\nSpoiler:\n\nCase-\n\n=Qanba Q1 Case\n\n=Weight (Unknown)\n\n=Width/Length/Height with Balltop (Unknown)\n\nMetal Panels-\n\n+Top metal panel\n\n-No bottom panel\n\nPlexi/Art-\n\n=Stock Plexi/Artwork combo sits on top of metal panel.\n\n+Stock Artwork doesn't leave sticky residue when removed to be being pressed on stock plexi\n\n-Stock Plexi can't be reused with new artwork due to artwork be being pressed on stock plexi\n\n+Tek Innovations will likely have replacement plexi and artwork option in future\n\nBottom Padding/Feet-\n\n+Has table clamps that can be removed\n\n=No Feet\n\n=Two vertical strips of rubber material intended for lap/table\n\nJoystick-\n\n-Qanba stock joystick (Need break down info with details and good/bad)\n\n=Can easily replace stock joystick with Sanwa and Seimitsu joysticks (Need to verify all models work with mounting bracket)\n\nButtons-\n\n-Qanba stock buttons (Need break down info with details and good/bad)\n\n=Can easily replace stock buttons with Sanwa and Seimitsu buttons (Need to verify screw in buttons work properly)\n\nPCB-\n\n=PS3 PCB \"Arcade Joystick 1008\" \"QB-1008A-A3\"\n\n=360 PCB \"0103\" \"QB-3008\"\n\n+Common ground but unsure if held high/low\n\n=All wires to action buttons and to LED indicator from PCB are pin connectors\n\nWiring-\n\n=insertinfohere\n\nUSB Cable-\n\n=Wired USB A Male stored in cord compartment\n\n+Replacement USB cables can either be purchased from Eightarc/Qanba, made with standard 5pin connector (Model #EditMe), or soldered directly to PCB\n\nEightarc Model X Y Z\n\nSRKTT thread-\n\nSRK Front Page article -\n\nCase-\n\n=insertinfohere\n\nMetal Panels-\n\n=insertinfohere\n\nPlexi/Art-\n\n=insertinfohere\n\nBottom Padding/Feet-\n\n=insertinfohere\n\nJoystick-\n\n=insertinfohere\n\nButtons-\n\n=insertinfohere\n\nPCB-\n\n=insertinfohere\n\nWiring-\n\n=insertinfohere\n\nUSB Cable-\n\n=insertinfohere\n\nList of sticks to detail in this thread:\n\nEightarc Fusion Synthesis\n\nEightarc Fusion Ebony\n\nEightarc Fusion Ivory\n\nEightarc ISO Ebony PS3\n\nEightarc ISO Ebony 360\n\nEightarc ISO Ivory PS3\n\nEightarc ISO Ivory 360\n\nEightarc ISO Onyx 360 DONE\n\nEightarc ISO Onyx PS3 DONE\n\nEightarc ISO Pearl 360 DONE\n\nEightarc ISO Pearl PS3 DONE\n\nQanba Q1 360 DONE\n\nQanba Q1 Black PS3 DONE\n\nQanba Q1 White PS3 (Was this officially released?)\n\nQanba Q1 Sanwa Gotvg PS3\n\nQanba Q1 Arc Black PS3\n\nQanba Q1 Qingshui White (Blue) PS3\n\nQanba Q1 Sanwa White (Pink) PS3\n\nQanba Q2 Pro Standard Edition Straight Layout 360\n\nQanba Q2 Pro Standard Edition Straight Layout PS3\n\nQanba Q2 Pro Professional Edition Vewlix Layout 360\n\nQanba Q2 Pro Professional Edition Vewlix Layout PS3\n\nQanba Q2 Pro LED Black PS3\n\nQanba Q2 Pro LED Black 360 (Does this exist?)\n\nQanba Q2 Pro LED White PS3\n\nQanba Q2 Pro LED White 360 (Does this exist?)\n\nQanba Q2 Pro LED Silver PS3\n\nQanba Q2 Pro LED Silver 360 (Does this exist?)\n\nQanba Q2 Pro Gotvg PS3\n\nQanba Q2 Glow 360\n\nQanba Q2 Glow PS3\n\nQanba Q2 Glow EVO 2014 Edition PS3\n\nQanba Q3 360\n\nQanba Q3 PS3\n\nQanba Q3 PS3 Tekken 6 Art (Was this officially released?)\n\nQanba Q3 Empire Arcadia PS3\n\nQanba Q3 Wireless PS3\n\nQanba Q4 RAF Black\n\nQanba Q4 RAF White + Red\n\nQanba Q4 RAF Ice Red\n\nQanba Q4 RAF Ice Blue\n\nQanba Q4 RAF Ice Blue PC Street Fighter Art\n\nQanba Q4 RAF Ice Blue 6-Button MINSK\n\nQanba Q4 eLivePro|Kindevu\n\nQanba Q4 eLivePro|RF\n\nQanba Q4 eLivePro|D44BAS\n\nQanba N1 Black PS3\n\nQanba N1 Red PS3\n\nQanBa 2 Ultimate Fightstick Black PS3\n\nQanBa 2 Ultimate Fightstick White PS3\n\nQanBa 2 Ultimate Fightstick Tekken 6 Art PS3\n\nQanBa 2 Ultimate Fightstick WUJI PS3\n\nMy work is cut out for me WTF am I doing?\n\nAny help is appreciated.
