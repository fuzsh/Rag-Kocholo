        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe MojuBox is a 3D printed controller that you can order preassembled or print yourself. It can fit most printers, so if your print bed is 210 mm x 210 mm, you are good to go!\n\nPerformance\n\nThe MojuBox is compatible with the best parts. Designed using SOLIDWORKS, this is a modular controller, so you can pick between a Japanese joystick, Korean joystick, original hitbox, and/or hitbox layout. The joystick is supposed to be the Sanwa JLF.\n\nThe original hitbox layout has 24 mm directional buttons, except for the 30 mm jump button. The hitbox layout has all 30 mm buttons. The WASD layouts can be all 24 mm or all 30 mm. The 24 mm option can have an extra 30 mm jump button. You can even opt for a Smash layout:\n\nWhen it comes to the attack buttons, they can be 30 mm Vewlix, 30 mm Noir, or 30 mm hitbox, the latter of which has its first and fourth columns of buttons lower than the two middle columns.\n\nThe secondary buttons can be five 16 mm buttons or seven 12 mm buttons. 12 mm buttons may require soldering because some do not have screw-on terminals.\n\nThe USB-C port was placed on the top of the MojuBox for safer placement. Also, a screen slot was added for 0.96″ OLED powered by the TheTrainGoes Pico Advanced Breakout Board.\n\nThe holes of the MojuBox were positioned to maximize the wrist resting space. Lowering the joystick’s hole position would have caused fitment issues since the MojuBox was designed to be as low profile as possible while giving the panels a slight slope, so the MojuBox gets lower toward the front. There is a 2.5° tilt.\n\nHardware\n\nHere are the materials needed to put together this controller:\n\nFilament\n\nFlathead countersunk M3 x 20 mm screws (16 pieces)\n\nM3 x 5 mm x 5 mm heat-set inserts (16 pieces)\n\nSanwa JLF joystick (optional)\n\nSanwa or other low-profile buttons\n\nSix foot 90° straight USB to USB-C cable\n\nUSB to USB-C adapter\n\nPCB\n\nVinyl wrap (optional)\n\nSuper glue\n\nDouble-sided tape\n\nNon-slip pads\n\n3D printer\n\nScrewdriver\n\nSoldering iron\n\nPliers (optional)\n\nIf you pick the Japanese joystick layout, you would need four flathead countersunk #10-24 x 1″ screws, and you would also need eight #10 nuts.\n\nHere are some recommendations for the parts:\n\nUSB to USB-C adapter\n\n16 mm buttons\n\n12 mm buttons\n\n12 mm buttons (no soldering)\n\nAppearance\n\nThe texture of the MojuBox is smooth, but the cherry on top when it comes to the MojuBox is the art engravement that probably caught your eye.\n\nThe engravement is done through ZBrush using the alpha-to-mesh feature and can probably be customized to your taste if you order a preassembled MojuBox.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe MojuBox is a dream for those wanting a modular controller to play fighting games or even other genres.\n\nModular design\n\nDifferent layouts\n\nEasy assembly & disassembly\n\nParts compatibility\n\nWrist rest\n\nSmooth texture\n\nArt engravement\n\nRating\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nLink"
