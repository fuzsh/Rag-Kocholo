        "text": "About\n\nPort reception facilities\n\nIMO develops and maintains a port reception facility database (PRFD) as a module of the IMO Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS) . The PRFD was designed to allow IMO Member States to update the Database via a log-in password, and to allow the public to access all the information in the Database on a view-only basis. Click here to get access to GISIS.\n\nINTERCARGO Database of port reception facilities\n\nA Database on Ship-Terminal Interface Issues is set up, and the database contains entries of 746 ports in more than 100 regions/countries, based on 3221 Reports from masters of bulk carriers.\n\nMARPOL Annex V\n\nNew amendments to MARPOL Annex V entered into force on 1 Mar 2018, which require mandatory declaration of shipper: “Solid bulk cargoes …, shall be classified in accordance with appendix I of this Annex, and declared by the shipper as to whether or not they are harmful to the marine environment”.\n\nUnder new amendments to MARPOL Annex V, discharge of residues of a cargo that is declared “harmful to the marine environment” by shipper (i.e. HME cargo residues) and the cargo hold washings are strictly prohibited. There is only one option – to discharge them to port reception facilities (PRFs) .\n\nAs introducing the electronic record book, the resolution MEPC.314(74), as adopted on 17 May 2019, contains the requirements as follows:\n\n“The Garbage Record Book, whether as a part of the ship’s official logbook, or as an electronic record book which shall be approved by the Administration taking into account the Guidelines developed by the Organization, or otherwise, shall be in the form specified in appendix II to this Annex:”.\n\nIMO also adopted Guidelines for the use of Electronic Record Books under MARPOL (resolution MEPC.312(74)) to guide the electronic record book practice.\n\nCompliance with MARPOL Annex V\n\nThe effectiveness of ships to comply with the discharge requirements of MARPOL depends largely upon the availability of adequate port reception facilities, especially within special areas. MARPOL obliges Governments to ensure the provision of adequate reception facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of garbage without causing undue delay to ships, and according to the needs of the ships using them.\n\nAn overview of the revised MARPOL Annex V discharge provisions can be accessed here. and link. Exceptions with respect to the safety of a ship and those on board and accidental loss are contained in regulation 7 of Annex V.\n\nSolid bulk cargoes shall be classified and declared by the shipper as to whether or not they are harmful to the marine environment, in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph 3.2 of the 2012 Guidelines for the Implementation of MARPOL Annex V.\n\nClick here for a simplified overview of the regulations regarding the discharge of cargo residues under the revised Annex V.\n\nCargo residues\n\nUnder MARPOL Annex V, cargo residues are defined as the remnants of any cargo which remain on deck or in holds following loading or unloading. They include loading and unloading excess or spillage, whether in wet or dry condition or entrained in wash water, but do not include cargo dust remaining on deck after sweeping or dust on the external surfaces of the ship (regulation 1.2 of the revised Annex V). In addition to this definition, the revised Annex V also stipulates that only those cargo residues that cannot be recovered using commonly available methods for unloading shall be considered for discharge.\n\nSpecial Areas under MARPOL\n\nClick here to refer to Special Areas under MARPOL\n\nUpdates"
