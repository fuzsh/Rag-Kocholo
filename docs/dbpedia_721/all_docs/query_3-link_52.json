        "text": "I just don't know what to say.\n\nBut I know:\n\nDear DayZ Developer Team.\n\nI learned about DayZ after playing the DayZ Mod in Arma when I was 13 or so and in high school. Meanwhile I'm going to college and study aerospace engineering.\n\nI loved the mod (and the mods of the mod, eg. Overpoch, Origins, Epoch) and a standalone game was just what me and my friends wished for all along.\n\nI always defended DayZ and you, the developers. No matter what happened, no matter the lies or broken promises or missed deadlines.\n\nA L W A Y S.\n\nNo matter if Youtube, Facebook, Twitter or other platforms.\n\nI just loved the concept of surviving in a world similar to ours and being alone or with my best buddies.\n\nIn conclusion I got very excited about the BETA and happily started playing it.\n\nPlayer movement, inertia, gun play. Zombie ragdoll. All feels great.\n\nEspecially shooting them in the knee and them dropping to the ground.\n\nWhy is this not possible with players though?\n\nI always thought that this should be a hardcore survival simulator.\n\nBut you don't have to define simulator in a new way.\n\nSome stuff is just not so realistic:\n\n- Freezing to death when running in rain for 10-20 minutes, like we were in Alaska or some shit\n\n- Refill cars every 5-10 kilometers, yea, fuel consumption done right\n\n- No fractures, you can't get players down with a shot to their feet or knees\n\n- I also can't remember helmets protecting the face of people. Two-three shots to the face for a headshot. a m a z i n g\n\n- Please hire or ask some dudes from Dying Light to teach you how to make zombie combat\n\n- Please contact HAVOK to make your physics for items and everything else\n\nAnd damn is this a buggy mess. I know we're in beta and you focus only on bugfixing now.\n\nBut these things worked before.\n\nFound a tent, deployed in the forest and started collecting stuff for a base, because basebuilding was finally in the game, after 5 years.\n\nJust when I had nearly everything and wanted to put my last two boxes of nails inside, it disappeared. Just disappeared.\n\nWanted to tan some leather and craft leather stuff. Found a barrel. Couldn't start tanning process. Exit inventory - barrel and all my hard scouted and looted pelts went missing.\n\nStarted the search for a car, to experience the beloved walking simulator in a new way.\n\nFound a NIVA 4x4. With two wheels. Searched two days and found a wheel.\n\nLeft it in the car and searched another two days for the fourth one, just to come back and find the car turned upside down.\n\nA nice dude flipped it for me with his buggy V3S. In exchange for the two wheels.\n\nSo after a LONG time I was finally able to drive that god damn Lada Niva.\n\nDrove through numerous industrial areas, refilling the car every 5-10 kilometers. Because in real life the Niva also has a consumption of 12l/10km. YEP REAL HARDCORE SURVIVAL SIMULATOR. For cars.\n\nMy car was packed with crap for basebuilding.\n\nSo what is the logical conclusion of that?\n\nRight, the car just won't work anymore, although it always got its oil refilled, water for the radiator, while all the other parts remained \"pristine\" and the car never got a single scratch.\n\nSometimes I can't open my inventory, the other time I can't craft stuff. The other moment after I chop down a bush/tree the loud sound of it falling down plays on repeat, scaring the shit out of me.\n\nIn the last two weeks or so I spent like 120 hours playing this game with my friends, experiencing all this game-breaking bugs, still had some fun.\n\nBut if my ecxitement for the 1.0 was a status icon, it would be dropping quickly. With THREE arrows. To RED."
