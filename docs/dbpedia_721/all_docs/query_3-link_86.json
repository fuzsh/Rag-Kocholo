        "text": "Firefight Map[edit]\n\nShould we mention the \"different and new\" firefight map that will be available, I'm keeping my fingers crossed for flood. —This unsigned comment was made by Spartan Jack490 (talk • contribs). Please sign your posts with ~~~~\n\nI think it's worth a mention. From this Sparkcast (http://halo.xbox.com/Content/assets/en-us/Podcast/waypointrss.xml), I also believe that it might be Flood. They could have been joking, but Frankie and the other 343 members were still hinting at The Library. -TheLostJedi 16:07, 7 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nI agree, but how would that be playable? Are they going to put it in the Reach matchmaking?--Bdgroot-117 04:40, 10 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nI got the impression the maps are just new Reach maps, on the Reach MM disc, like Mythic II was for Halo 3. Alex T Snow 04:52, 10 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nQuite so. According to the Sparkast I linked there will be another disc with the Campaign disc for Halo: CEA. That disc will have the 7 new maps, although they also spoke of a voucher code that will come with the purchase, to download those 7 maps, allowing players to play all of Reach's maps if they choose to. This could all be subject to change though. It's still a few months before the game's release. -TheLostJedi 20:21, 12 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nHow about the hold out point on the level Halo where you have to defend the marines, bungie hinted that might make an appearance.\n\nHow do jou mean?--Bdgroot-117 17:45, 26 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nArtistic Licence[edit]\n\nThe new helmet is strange, it doesnt look exactly like the old one. It doenst look smooth. 84.130.203.147 15:25, 9 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nAs of right now, it sounds like 343 is still fixing/redoing a lot of stuff in the game, the helmet and armor included. Hopefully the stuff we've seen so far isn't the final version SPARTAN-347 17:20, 9 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nThey said they've already fixed the helmet. Alex T Snow 17:24, 9 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nTrue, also if you watch carefully, all of the appearances of Chief in the trailer aren't consistent. For instance, in the reveal shot where it switches from the old Chief to the new, his armour looks a bit weird. But later... freeze the frames around when it has a clip of online Co-op play. The Chief in that clip looks better. -TheLostJedi 20:26, 12 June 2011 (EDT)\n\n...You know, another possibility could be that the Mk. V that we've seen in Reach (the whole suit, not just the armor pieces) is actually the Mk. V [B] (the privatized variant made for the SPARTAN-IIIs), and what we're seeing in Halo: Anniversary is the straight-up Mk. V SPARTAN-347 00:17, 19 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nI don't think so, because such an important piece of info would be mentioned somewhere. Also, it's not really common for there to be a privatized variant of an entire suit. Jorge uses the same base suit as the rest of Noble team, so a special Spartan-III private Mk V variant is out of the question. I honestly think that 343 wanted to keep the suit like the original in order to preserve John's image. The Mk V in Halo: Reach is a sort of redux made to bring the old Mk V into a new, grittier light. If John used the Reach model for Mk V, it wouldn't feel right. However, I wish 343 would make it a little bit more like the Reach version just for canon and aesthetic reasons...--File:PENGUIN4.gif|15px]]FluffyEmoPenguin(ice quack!) 14:14, 17 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nWell, it has since been revealed that the Mk. V seen in Reach is the Mk V Issue 1, which did not have AI housing, and the one the Chief uses is the Mk. V Issue 2, which did. Hope this cleared things up. Infernal-Blaze 14:34, 7 November 2011 (EST)\n\nTerminals[edit]\n\nWere will the terminals be placed in the \"new\" campain?--Bdgroot-117 16:17, 14 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nwill anyone but this it seems like campaign and new maps for reach which will likely be released as dlc later on?butthead4\n\nAccording to Frankie, each level will have one Terminal to be found, and that these will be relatively easy to find and won't result in being killed while viewing it by nearby enemies. -- Specops306 Autocrat Qur'a 'Morhek 21:21, 14 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nWhat the hell is butthead4 trying to say? --Felix-119 14:46, 16 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nI have no idea \"A Penny saved is a Penny earned\" 14:49, 16 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nYou mind putting a reference on that, SpecOps? Vegerot (talk) 13:36, 17 June 2011 (EDT)!\n\nInterview with Dan Ayoub here, providing details on the terminals.\n\nHighlight:\n\n\"Terminals debuted in Halo 3, it was text, it was a little difficult to find. So we're going to make the Terminals more accessible, they will be easier for people to find and we're going to use them to tell a story of the Halo ring, and if you find them all you may find that we've laid down some foundation for the other Halo game we talked about today.\"\n\n— Dan Ayoub\n\n-- Specops306 Autocrat Qur'a 'Morhek 01:28, 18 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nthanks!--Bdgroot-117 16:53, 24 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nFlood[edit]\n\nThe main thing that struck me personally, was the Flood. I mean, they didn't appear in reach, so it only shows that they'll have to make all new graphics, correct? With that, I am wondering if the Flood will appear in Firefight, and if so, how will they appear. --~Jman98~ 17:36, 18 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nWatch the trailer at 0:53. you can see flood. BushWookieCamper\n\nThe legs on the elite combat forms look like those of the Halo: Reach - style elites, so I'd say it's safe to say the rest of their design has been updated too SPARTAN-347 00:15, 19 June 2011 (EDT)\n\nMaybe they used the Halo 3 Flood models and touched them up a bit. Bioniclepluslotr 21:53, 30 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nBOB Zealot?[edit]\n\nI saw the picture at the bottom of the article. Its description was a BOB Zealot. Why the hell is it a BOB? Just because it has white armor? I don't get it.\n\nWhoops forgot to sign it. Themrhalo007 21:06, 9 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nYes. Zealots do not have white armour. Alex T Snow 16:56, 3 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nNo, it;s not a zealot, if you noticed the armor is being used differently from Reach, that is one of the invisible guys you fight throughout that mission, He also has no shields like they do. —This unsigned comment was made by ArchedThunder (talk • contribs). Please sign your posts with ~~~~\n\nWhat are you talking about? Its not an invisible one. Just watch this video. 7:37 Now did you see that Golden elite with the energy sword. THAT was the Zealot. And did you see another Elite with an energy sword? No. And why you think he has no shields, idk. Clearly he lives though a needle combine! Themrhalo007 15:39, 16 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nPlease sign your comments PRESIDENT1234 19:18, 4 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nThis isn't Halo Reach, shields have nothing to do with the damage the needles do, maybe you should play CE again. ArchedThunder\n\nMarathon symbols ?[edit]\n\nWill be again be able to see the Marathon symbols in the game ? Like on Keyes, PoA and such ? Mcz117chief 14:58, 4 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nI think not. It's Bungie's trademark, and they even avoided to use it in Reach PatrickRus 15:44, 4 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nBut that was because of Microsoft, as the Marathon series is owned by the Microsoft, but since 343i is working in conjunction with Microsoft, I hope we will be able to see them again. Mcz117chief 16:18, 4 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nHalo is property of Microsoft Game Studios and it's subsidiary, 343 Industries. Bungie still however maintains full rights to the Marathon franchise. User:CommanderTony/Sig\n\nThen why didn't they use it in reach?--1-10 12:34, 14 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nThe symbol will not be in the game as we can see simply by looking at the logo. The original had the Marathon symbol in the center, as seen here: [1] but the new one has replaced it with a monitor as seen here: [2]. As commander Tony said, Marathon belongs to Bungie but Halo belongs to Microsoft therefore Microsoft will not use the symbol without Bungie's permission. As for why it wasn't in Reach, that is most likely due to Halo belonging to Microsoft at the time despite Bungie making the game--Soul reaper 13:28, 14 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nNew skulls[edit]\n\nhttp://halo.xbox.com/en-us/news/headline/special-halo-combat-evolved-anniversary-pre-order-bonuses/111729 Someone mind adding it to the article?\n\nThere are more new skulls conformed at Halowaypoint and New York Comic Con.\n\nOn Halowaypoint:\n\nFOG - \"Player's motion tracker is disabled.\" (CLOUD from halo reach)\n\nMALFUNCTION - \"Every time you respawn a random element of your HUD is disabled.\"\n\nBOOM - \"Explosions have twice the damage radius.

Alex T Snow 04:36, 19 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nI'm confused[edit]\n\nIs Halo: CE Anniversary going to be a standalone retail game or DLC for Halo: Reach? even after reading the article through several times, i still don't get it. 24.60.143.195 02:56, 19 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nIt's a standalone retail release, built using the Reach engine, but including Reach multiplayer and seven exclusive maps, like Halo 3: ODST being packaged with the Halo 3 multiplayer. -- Specops306 Autocrat Qur'a 'Morhek 07:12, 19 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nIt's not on the Reach engine -ArchedThunder\n\nJust the Reach graphics engine is how I heard it, regardless, gameplay has literally not been touched at all. Alex T Snow 09:09, 20 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nIt isn't the reach engine, it is a completely new engine made by Saber. —This unsigned comment was made by ArchedThunder (talk • contribs). Please sign your posts with ~~~~\n\nThe engine from CE is the same, the graphics though have been revamped.--1234fansofHalo 12:38, 26 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nYes they have the CE engine, but when running the new graphics it using using a new graphics engine. ArchedThunder\n\nOld or New Engine?[edit]\n\nI know that this game uses the original engine, but would people like it better if it used the Reach engine (minus equipment and all the stuff that wasn't in the original game). What I mean by the Reach engine is the ability to swap weapons with allies, have UNSC vehicles be destructible, and have the same weapon and AI behaviors as in Reach, but map layout and stuff that was exclusive to the original game (such as the original assault rifle) will have the original behaviors. I know keeping the old engine gives it that vintage and classic feel that was important to the game when it first came out, but would people really buy a game that they already have just because they updated the graphics? For me, I guess I would give it a try, maybe rent it, but I don't know if I'll buy it just for the graphics. Anyways, what do you guys think: is new engine or old engine better? Bioniclepluslotr 16:50, 26 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nI get what you mean, for sure about the weapon swapping, but the point is they're not touching gameplay at all. Period. Alex T Snow 18:32, 26 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nAre they changing animations? Bioniclepluslotr 23:13, 26 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nOnly graphics. Alex T Snow 23:22, 26 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nAnd multiplayer? It says that it includes Reach's multiplayer, so is it like ODST having Halo 3's multiplayer? Bioniclepluslotr 07:34, 27 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nClassic MP maps[edit]\n\nWill the new multiplayer maps be available for use with the Reach disc once this game is played or installed or is it only available on this game's multiplayer? Bioniclepluslotr 07:39, 27 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nIt is Reach's multiplayer and they have said that they will allow you to download the map pack for free when you purchase the game so you can play them on the Reach disk ArchedThunder\n\nIf I rent or borrow the game, does it still work, or do I have to enter some code that came with the game? I don't remember what happened with the Halo 3 and ODST map thing. Bioniclepluslotr 11:47, 27 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nChanges in Canon[edit]\n\nSince Reach graphics are used, won't canonical stuff about appearance also change? For example, Zealots are Gold in the original trilogy, but not in Reach. This can be explained canonically right now that the Reach Zealot armor is an older version, but if the ones in this game are now using the old armor, won't that mess up how to explain it? Bioniclepluslotr 21:52, 30 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nIt's not like you can't change the color of something...--ハローファン (H1234-NET) 21:56, 30 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nI didn't think it every actually called the gold Elites in CE Zealots. I wrote a big thing about this on the General talk page, but basically the way I see it is the gold Elites are Generals, not Zealots. Zealots act as strike team, but Generals are tough bosses who guard locations, like in CE. Alex T Snow 03:49, 1 August 2011 (EDT)\n\nI think a bigger issue is the backwards retconning of things. They're using a remastered Mark V model instead of the one in Reach as well as using weapon models more similar to those in CE. All the while mixing in models FROM Reach like the Pelicans, Marines, enemies, and such.--File:PENGUIN4.gif|15px]]FluffyEmoPenguin(ice quack!) 16:28, 2 August 2011 (EDT)\n\nAny changes will be purely asthetic and will only create minor breaches in cannon. Who really cares if the remodeled pelican has a vent on it where there wasn't one in the original? It won't matter, and any differences could be explained by them being just a \"variant\" of the original. pestilence Phil, pestilence! 17:48, 2 August 2011 (EDT)\n\nOr by the fact that it is the same type of Pelican, just the design is different, it is no different than them constantly changing the look of Covenant species, weapons, vehicles, and architecture. ArchedThunder\n\nI think that in non-sepfic objects or beings (IE: weapons, vhecles, etc), we should treat canonically the same as CE, ide: retconned by the newer games.\n\nMy reasoning is that the gameplay has to be the same, models are contrained by the same hitboxes. you can see in trailers that the weapons, and enemny species look dispronarnte to their current state, but not to the ce versions. I'm not signed in right now, but i'm jabberwock xeno 24.154.119.139 21:42, 11 August 2011 (EDT)\n\nTheater Mode[edit]\n\nIs theater mode a possibility for the campaign? The developers said that they wanted to keep the game the same except for graphics, but adding theater won't hurt, would it? Bioniclepluslotr 21:55, 30 July 2011 (EDT)\n\nIn a recent update to the article, it states that Theater mode won't be available for the Campaign or Co-Op which is a major disappoint since the remastered graphics have so much to offer. Hopefully, they decide to change their minds at the last minute and reincorporate it into the game for campaign. --RadicalEdward2 12:43, 19 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nThe game has gone gold, and mass production is under way. There will be no Theater in Campaign. - Halo-343 (Talk) 16:14, 19 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nThe reason is because Bungie had to cheat a lot during the development of the original Combat Evolved to give the illusion of certain things, leading to deliberate glitches like \"Floating Assault Rifle Glitch\". Theater mode would make all of these too apparent. Tuckerscreator(stalk) 16:30, 19 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nAnd they still do it in all Halo titles.

The way the info was worded suggests the former.--File:PENGUIN4.gif|15px]]FluffyEmoPenguin(ice quack!) 16:19, 2 August 2011 (EDT)\n\nI heard that there's only one disc, and that it includes Reach multiplayer, but technically, Firefight is separate from Multiplayer, so it may not be included. I think that the matchmaking will have certain playlists from Reach that will let players play against players with the Reach disc, but have separate co-op playlists for this game's campaign, and no firefight playlists. Bioniclepluslotr 21:26, 21 August 2011 (EDT)\n\nPhysics engine[edit]\n\nWell, considering the info that was provided to use, the physics engine is the same as in the original halo:ce. I was wondering, how do you think will work the death animations and ragdolls ? Most of you probably remember/know how dead bodies \"melted\" when they were partly over the edge of some kind. How will this work in the nev version ? Will they still \"melt\" even in the new graphics layer ? Mcz117chief 02:44, 3 August 2011 (EDT)\n\nI feel that all the old animations mixed with new character models will cause some problems, such as a character's armor passing through itself (arm sinks into chest). Plus the cutscenes are going to look odd. I wish they at least change the cutscenes to look more like the newer ones.

The theatre mode in Halo 3 and Reach is built into the engine, hence CEA's multiplayer will work with theatre.

BushWookieCamper 03:17, 22 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nAnniversary canon trumps Combat Evolved canon visually. The story is exactly the same, so there's no superior canon there. - Halo-343 (Talk) 08:31, 22 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nI was under the impression they are concurrent. The reason I say this is because nothing has changed. The MA5 still looks like an MA5. The Pelican is still a Pelican with no changes. They are just of higher quality with extremely minor technical changes. Why can't we use both? Now obviously, since the Anniversary graphics will be better, we'll prefer those pictures. But still. pestilence Phil, pestilence! 09:51, 22 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nExactly, Anniversary looks better, so images from it will be used over images from Combat Evolved. - Halo-343 (Talk) 09:56, 22 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nHow about the M90 shotgun? It has the same skin as the M45 from Reach. Should we ignore it, right? —S331 (Tank beats Everything!) 10:04, 22 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nYou may be wrong. I'm not sure. They used a lot of Reach skins during development, so they may have changed it. However, if you saw this skin from a trailer recently, you will probably be right. Which is an issue. pestilence Phil, pestilence! 10:08, 22 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nhere. Unless 343 is on a very tight schedule, Im quite positive that its from the final game. —S331 (Tank beats Everything!) 10:37, 22 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nAs revealed in Data Drop 6, the shotgun featured in Anniversary is the M45E, which is functionally identical to the M90. The Spartans took all the Autumn's M90s for use in Operation: RED FLAG, explaining why the M90 doesn't appear in the game. --Courage never dies. 20:35, 22 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nI think you misread that; they took all of the M90s out of one of the armories. There are multiple armories on the ship. The M90s will appear in the game, the question is whether they'll have the skin of the M45 or not. pestilence Phil, pestilence! 23:18, 22 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nI just read it again and... hell I don't know. I think I'm wrong. I hate when that happens. Can't we just wait until the game comes out before we go and make any decisions about how to manage the cannon?

I don't think there will be some time travel paradox because the Chief picked up a different type of shotgun.

Bioniclepluslotr 09:59, 23 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nActually if you look at the library section of the most recent Behind the Scenes video you can catch a glimpse of a zealot that appears to be gold.--Soul reaper 10:28, 23 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nActually guys if you look at both weapon comparison videos you would notice that the MA5B and the M6D are the ONLY weapons that arn't using a Halo: Reach model, so that calls into question the entire canon of the weapons of the first game. Thanks 343. BushWookieCamper 14:02, 23 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nThe Anniversary MA5B is identical to the Halo 3 MA5C, right down to the scratches on the outer paintjob. The M6D seems to be a slightly recolored version of the Halo 3 M6G. -Kronos101 14:36, 23 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nOnce again: Thanks 343 for putting so much though into this.BushWookieCamper 15:52, 23 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nWhy do people always make such a big deal over minor visual changes? It doesn't mess with canon if certain weapons get a bit more detailed or get some minor aesthetic change that in no way affects the story or anything. Just appreciate the fact that they're making a remastered Halo: CE instead of whining about how weapons look slightly different. --LeeUnit92 16:16, 23 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nAgreed. It's not as if they're creating a new game, they're remastering an old game with a new skin. What did we expect? The majority of their team is probably crunching away on Halo 4, trying to deliver us new hotness. Using old, slightly modified skins saved time and effort, especially time, and allows the real effort to go into the level redesigns. How long did they spend reiterating on the Chief's model? Do we really want that time spent making sure the M6D or the M90 or the MA5B is absolutely canonically perfect? If it comes down to it, then the new game takes priority - it's owned by the current license holders, and is the newer version with updated and supplemental materials. -- Specops306 Autocrat Qur'a 'Morhek 16:27, 23 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nFrom what I've seen, every one of those weapons is canonically perfect. See here. pestilence Phil, pestilence! 16:31, 23 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nSo far the only thing that changes is the M90A is replaced by the M45E, as all of the M90As were taken by the Spartans. Also, the MA5B and C are supposed to be visually identical, glad they got that right. Alex T Snow 00:32, 24 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nYou are incorrect there, from what I remember, the MA5B was black in color and the MA5C was silver, so there is ONE difference 1-10 08:29, 11 November 2011 (EST)\n\nNo. The MA5B has always been silver/gray. Perhaps it looked black on your TV, but it has always looked the same. --Courage never dies. 11:32, 11 November 2011 (EST)\n\nShould also take lighting into account; HCE has old lighting technology compared to newer titles. — subtank 11:48, 11 November 2011 (EST)\n\nI played on Halo: PC so that might be why 1-10 09:44, 12 November 2011 (EST)\n\n[edit]\n\nI noticed that the top of the \"features\" section says: \"The game will feature a graphics layer running on top of the exact Halo: Combat Evolved physics and gameplay engine.[6] As such, gameplay mechanics from the original game, such as the M6D pistol's three-shot kill, will all be present.\" I know that the use of the M6D 3sk example comes from 343i's own videos, but it doesn't actually make sense in the context of campaign gameplay; the 3sk is strictly a result of MP weapon balancing, and doesn't manifest in campaign at all. In fact, even on easy, it takes 4 shots to bring down a blue elite.--66.194.72.243 02:54, 29 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nUltimate Overwriting/retconing of Everything[edit]\n\nSo just to make sure, this game will overwrite (retcon is a bad word, as most of it will remain the same) everything from the original, right? So if something happens one way in the original, and one way in Anniversary, then Anniversary will win, no? Vegerot goes RAWR! Vegerot (talk) 23:08, 30 October 2011 (EDT)!\n\nYes. 343i hold the IP, it's the newest game, ergo it's the higher-priority canon. From everything they've said, and from everything we've seen, though, I really do think that the use of the M45 shotgun instead of the M90 is the only major change. Obviously there's the terminals, and graphical updates, but otherwise it's meant to be utterly faithful. No \"Greedo-shot-first\" or blinking Ewoks here, no sir. -- Specops306 Autocrat Qur'a 'Morhek 01:01, 31 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nNo, what I'm saying is that everything in Anniversary replaces the original. So for example, that means that in canon perspective, the M90 never even WAS used on 04! Also, we would remove the thing on Cortana's page about her looking like that during the Battle of Installation 04, because those things are overwritten in Anniversary. Vegerot goes RAWR! Vegerot (talk) 01:39, 31 October 2011 (EDT)!\n\nI don't know, I wouldn't totally say that the M90 Shotgun was never seen on Installation 04. For one, the novel Halo: The Flood says that they used the M90 on Alpha Halo. I know this because I happen to be reading it right now. Actually, more like the older novel, but I doubt that the author changed everything in the new edition, just like 343i changed everything in Halo Anniversary. Sure there may be many grammar and punctuation corrections, and maybe a few changed sentences, maybe, maybe one or two paragraphs, but I don't think the article or small sections of the article should be completely changed or have anything omitted. Am I coming through, am I being understood completely? It just seems wrong to say that the M90 was not present and used on Alpha Halo, it's like saying it was never encountered until Halo 2 and Halo 3. But granted, I do however agree the M45 looks much more cool than the M90, but seems to me shares some similarities to the M90A of H2 and more specifically, H3. --Xamikaze330 16:18, 31 October 2011 (EDT)Xamikaze330\n\nActually, either way it was first encountered in Halo: Reach. But I think that we should change the moments in which we say that it's the M90 and make it the M45. Vegerot goes RAWR! Vegerot (talk) 17:41, 31 October 2011 (EDT)!\n\nMaybe just so, but please bear in mind about the \"alternating switch\" key between different graphics engines plays a factor on this discussion, and also the article. By alternating between different graphics engines, the user \"switches\" between the M45E Tactical Shotgun and the M90 CAWS Shotgun. This can very easily wreak hell and havoc on this, making things very confusing, or maybe a little confusing. Either way, you may want to think about it. The past cannot be undone, nor should it be. Just a friendly word of advice. --Xamikaze330 19:16, 31 October 2011 (EDT)Xamikaze330\n\nNo, what this means is that the shotgun we played with in CE was ACTUALLY the M45. Vegerot goes RAWR! Vegerot (talk) 19:19, 31 October 2011 (EDT)\n\nNo, the M90 still exists, and we used it in the original, that's just non-canon now. The M90 looks like the original one, and the M45 looks like the updated one, and they both exist. Also, saying there were no M90s on Alpha Halo would be like saying there were no M7s on Reach, the weapon selection in-game =/= the canon weapons used there, it's just a byproduct of how the game works. In \"The Mona Lisa\" we saw both MA5Bs and MA5Cs being used at the same time. In a similar fashion, it's doubtful all the M6s used on the POA on Alpha Halo were the D variant, as that's the officer's variant. Keyes would have one and a few others, but the majority would most likely have been Gs and Cs, there's just one M6 to represent them all, same goes for other weapons and games. Also, on another point, I'm in favour of saying only the improved graphics are canon, and switching to the old makes the visuals \"non-canon\". That might not be the best way to word it, but you all get what I mean. Alex T Snow 20:21, 11 November 2011 (EST)\n\nHe's right. The real world WWII German Army used, for example, about 6 different variants of the Panzer IV tank and 8 of the Panzer III. In 1942-1943, it was pretty common to see a Panzer IVF, Panzer IVH, Panzer IIIJ, and Panzer IIIL in the same platoon. You could have mixed platoons of Tiger Is and Panzer IIIs. The U.S. Air Force has 4 different models of F-16, and only an expert plane spotter could tell the difference between them just by looking. Militaries regularly use different versions of the same equipment at the same time. --Sierra 109 13:39, 13 November 2011 (EST)\n\nThank you, perfect example! Pick any WWII game that has a Panzer, or any air combat game with an F-16 and you will only find the one variant, because that's how games work. It'd be silly for a Halo game to have multiple versions, because one of the trademark Halo things is that there is only one gun from each role in any given game.

For one thing, I think the Wraiths should have turrets on top, and Covie vehicles should be hijackable. Plus, I would love for vehicles in multiplayer to be destructable (Incredibly aggravating when that guy in the Banshee kills you because his ride is invincible). Plus, put Wraiths in multiplayer, just to add variety if for nothing else. --Sierra 109 10:02, 14 November 2011 (EST)\n\nThe multiplayer within Anniversary is synonymous with Reach's. That means that everything from Halo: Reach will be in Halo: Anniversary. That includes weapons, the game modes, the armour abilities, the ability to play as a Sangheili, graphics, and audio. Kind of similar to Halo 3's multiplayer being included within Halo 3: ODST. However, Halo: Anniversary's (Reach's) multiplayer will be included on one disc alone. Only Halo: Anniversary's campaign uses the original Halo's engine for gameplay purposes. It also includes a second engine which powers the updated graphics.\n\nThis decision to include Reach's multiplayer was done because 343i were not willing to split the online community between both games and to restrict time.--Brute Honour Guard File:Bruteface.png|20px]] (\"Talk\") 10:14, 14 November 2011 (EST)\n\nI think that 343I should have include a few new covenant weapons in the campaign, to give it some extra tactical depth. Case in point. In the HCE level Halo, at the point where you rescue the marines on the hill over the beam emitter, I have never failed to rescue all of the marines, and only a very few times in all the times I played it (200+ at this point) has a single Covenant solder reached the top of the hill. This is due to the fact that with an SRS99S2-AM Sniper Rifle, I can mow them down with impunity without fear of counter snipers. Now if 343I were to add, say, 1-2 Jackals (on normal) or more (heroic and legendary) equiped with Carbines, Needle Rifles, or even Focus Rifles, it would force players to find a good sniping spot, and ensure that easy pickings are confined to Easy difficulty! --Sierra 109 10:48, 14 November 2011 (EST)\n\nThis isn't a forum.

I suppose you would just download the gametype and play it. 23:01, 5 December 2011 (EST)\n\nThe game is just set up so that it takes three shots to kill an opponent.--Commander Halofan1234 (I say the cabal does not exist) 23:06, 5 December 2011 (EST)\n\nMohawk Marines[edit]\n\nAnyone else had this glitch? Marines and crewmen will have spikes coming out of their heads, helmetted or otherwise, and an eyeball will be floating right next to it. I figured if this happened to enough people, it could become it's own article.Fairfieldfencer FFF 07:22, 7 December 2011 (EST)\n\nlolno. Vegerot goes RAWR! Vegerot (talk) 08:30, 7 December 2011 (EST)!\n\nNope, I can't say I saw anything like that. My experience of Halo: Anniversary was rather pleasant and free of glitches.--Brute Honour Guard File:Bruteface.png|20px]] (\"Talk\") 09:18, 7 December 2011 (EST)\n\nI thought I was the only one. It's only happened twice for me, but I hope they release an Update to fix it. FYI it doesn't appear on old graphics.--One who survived 19:34, 19 March 2012 (EDT)\n\nUpdate: I've recently seen this glitch on many YouTube videos, so I think it's safe to say it's not an isolated incident. Check out this video at about 3:05 to see the glitch in action (for all you nonbelievers).

Like Abject Testament and the Covenant AI.--210.56.88.58 02:27, 5 January 2012 (EST)\n\nShould we move the list of appearances to article for Halo: Anniversary Terminals?[edit]\n\nHey, I'm just hijacking this section to turn our attention to closely related topic. Now that we have an appearance section dedicated towards appearances in the Anniversary Terminals, I'd like to propose that we move that list to the article specifically tailored for them as well as removing it from this one. I think it seems more appropriate for that article alone and well remove unnecessary space as well. I'd like to hear your point of view.--Brute Honour Guard File:Bruteface.png|20px]] (\"Talk\") 14:56, 5 January 2012 (EST)\n\nMore addition to the development section[edit]\n\nA critical analysis and review of the game. This needs to be documented in the article.— subtank 17:04, 8 August 2012 (EDT)\n\nAppearances are, like, my favorite part...is that weird? Anyways...[edit]\n\nHalo 2 has a list of appearances. Ya know, a list of a events, species, vehicles, all that stuff in the game. Should'nt they have that in Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary?"
