Conan: 1974-1989[]

The People of the Black Circle (novella) • illustrated by David Ireland • September 1974 hc 150pp

A Witch Shall Be Born (novelette) • illustrated by Alicia Austin • June 1975 hc 108pp

The Tower of the Elephant (collection) • illustrated by Richard Robertson • July 1975

The Pool of the Black One (collection) • illustrated by Hank Jankus • 1986

The series ran out of steam before publishing the last five (arguably four, as DMG did publish the Swords of the Red Brotherhood version of The Black Stranger in the collection Black Vulmea's Vengeance) of the stories and three of the fragments.
