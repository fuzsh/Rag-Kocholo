Donald Metcalf Grant passed away Wednesday morning. He was was 82 years old. Born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1927 and a graduate of the University of Rhode Island in 1949, Grant’s interest in fantasy and science fiction started when he began reading the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs at age 10.

Grant was involved in the founding of several science fiction and fantasy small press publishers, from Grant-Hadley Enterprises in 1945, to The Buffalo Book Company in 1946, Grandon, Publishers in 1949 and Centaur Press in 1970.

His most enduring legacy was the founding of Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc. in 1964.

In the mid-70s Grant was instrumental in publishing some of the finest Robert E. Howard limited editions to date, and went on to produce impressive works by the likes of H.P. Lovecraft, Fritz Lieber, Karl Wagner, and Stephen King, among countless others.

Donald M. Grant was a champion of the genre and his shadow stretches long over the industry. He was a giant among men and his legend will not fade…

He will be missed.

Godspeed, Mr. Grant…
