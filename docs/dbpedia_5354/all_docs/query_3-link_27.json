        "text": "Offers of free money from government grants are scams. Someone might offer you a grant to pay for education, home repairs, home business expenses, or unpaid bills. But they’re all scams. Here’s how to avoid a government grant scam, and how to report it.\n\nHow Government Grant Scammers Try To Trick You\n\nScammers reach you in lots of ways. They put ads online for (fake) government grants. Or they might call you using a fake number that shows up on your caller ID so it looks like they’re calling from a federal or state government agency. Some send texts, emails, or messages on social media saying you might qualify for free money from the government.\n\nScammers make big promises. They might say you can get free money or a grant to pay for education, home repairs, home business expenses, household bills, or other personal needs.\n\nScammers try to look official. Besides faking their phone number, scammers will pretend they’re with a real government agency like the Social Security Administration. Or, they’ll make up an official-sounding name of a government agency, like the Federal Grants Administration, which doesn’t exist.\n\nScammers ask you for information or money. Government grant scammers might start by asking for personal information, like your Social Security number, to see if you “qualify” for the grant (you will). Then they’ll ask for your bank account information — maybe to deposit “grant money” into your account or to pay up-front fees. Or they’ll ask you to pay those fees with a gift card, cash reload card, wire transfer, or cryptocurrency. That’s always a scam. Read this Government Imposters fotonovela to see how it happens.\n\nScammers try to be convincing. They might even promise a refund if you aren’t satisfied. But that’s a lie. Once you give your bank account information, or pay fees, your money will disappear. And, you’ll never see the grant they promise.\n\nWhat To Know About Government Grants\n\nThe government won’t get in touch out of the blue about grants. It won’t call, text, reach out through social media, or email you. It won’t offer you free government grants of any kind, much less grants to pay for home repairs, medical costs, or other personal needs. Real government grants require an application, and they’re always for a very specific purpose. Learn more (for free) at grants.gov.\n\nNever share your financial or personal information with anyone who contacts you. Government agencies will never call, text, message you on social media, or email to ask for your Social Security, bank account, or credit card number. In fact, no matter who they say they are, don’t give out that information. Once a scammer has your information, they can drain money from your accounts, or steal your identity.\n\nDon’t pay for a list of government grants — and don’t pay any up-front fees. The only place to find a list of all available federal grants is at grants.gov. And that list is free. No government agency will ever contact you to demand that you pay to get a grant. And no government agency will ever ask you to pay with cash, a gift card, a cash reload card, by wire transfer, or with cryptocurrency. Not for a grant, and not ever.\n\nIf you paid a scammer, act quickly. If you think you’ve sent money to a government impersonator like one of these grant scammers, contact the company you used to send the money. Tell the gift card, money transfer, or cryptocurrency company that it was a fraudulent transaction. Then ask them to reverse it.\n\nWhat To Do If You Paid A Scammer\n\nScammers often ask you to pay in ways that make it tough to get your money back. No matter how you paid a scammer, the sooner you act, the better. Learn more about how to get your money back.\n\nReport Government Grant Scams\n\nIf you spotted a scam, report it to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. The FTC uses and shares reports with law enforcement partners to help with investigations.\n\nImage\n\nOur Anatomy of an Imposter Scam blog series breaks down how to recognize, avoid, and report business and government imposter scams.\n\nNever move your money to “protect it.” That’s a scam\n\nWhat’s a verification code and why would someone ask me for it?\n\nWill your bank or investment fund stop a transfer to a scammer? Probably not\n\nSure ways to spot a scammer\n\nDid you get a call or text about a suspicious purchase on Amazon? It’s a scam\n\nNew tech support scammers want your life savings\n\nDid someone send you to a Bitcoin ATM? It’s a scam\n\nSearch Terms"
