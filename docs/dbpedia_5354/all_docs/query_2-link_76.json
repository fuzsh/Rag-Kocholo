        "text": "In his Intelligent Robotics and Autonomous Systems Lab, Ma and his research partners in UC’s College of Engineering and Applied Science will develop the technology needed for a satellite equipped with robotic arms to service another satellite in space. It’s a growing field known as In-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing, with implications for national security and commercialization.\n\n“Refueling, replacing a hardware module or fixing an antenna: On the ground, it would be a minor service, but in space it’s not minor at all,” Ma said.\n\nSome missions might be as simple as retrieving unresponsive satellites so they don’t pose a navigational threat to other orbiting spacecraft or assets."
