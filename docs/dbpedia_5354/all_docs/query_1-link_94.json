        "text": "Donald was brought up in the small village of Roybridge in the Highlands of Scotland. When not running around the hills or climbing he could be found playing music of all sorts and it quickly became his life’s passion.\n\nHe grew up immersed in traditional music as his father was a Gaelic singer and teacher. He sang songs from when he could speak and loved attending courses at Sabhal Mor Ostaig and attending the National Mod and Feisan nan Gaidheal. Mostly he just loved playing WITH people.\n\nHe found himself at St. Mary’s Music School and the Royal Northern College of Music and had a brilliant time at both. It was on his first day at the RNCM that the Elias Quartet began life. That was nearly 17 years ago.\n\nIn 2009 Donald gathered some of his most favourite people and musicians to record his solo album “The Way Home’.\n\n“Superb debut release… breaking down the barriers of what we know as traditional folk music” ***** Maverick Magazine\n\nThere is nothing more that Donald loves than collaborating. The more diverse the better… from playing and writing string arrangements for the lovely Kate Rusby, featuring on Catriona Mckay’s futuristic folk album “Starfish” to free improv on “Late Junction” with Trish Clowes – he loves it all. A highlight of 2015 was leading the GRIT orchestra at the opening night of Celtic Connections. He is a also member of folk band “The Secret North” who will soon release their album “Live”.\n\nDonald has a dog called Arthur and you can often catch them in the coffee shops of South East London.\n\nSpoken language: English"
