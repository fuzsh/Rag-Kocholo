The concept of a Degree Apprenticeship is fairly new; at its core, this model combines postsecondary education with paid on-the-job learning experiences through USDOL Registered Apprenticeship programs while the apprentice is simultaneously enrolled in a degree program, or through the awarding of credits toward a degree through a prior learning assessment.\n\nGiven the renewed emphasis on growing apprenticeships in traditional, as well as nontraditional sectors/occupations, a new policy approach is warranted wherein apprentices have the opportunity to simultaneously complete their apprenticeship program and a college degree. This “co-enrollment” approach, which will be expanded to include nontraditional sectors/occupations, will help to alleviate many of the challenges faced by the original NJ PLACE model.\n\nThis competitive grant opportunity is open to the following entities who are developing new, or building upon existing Registered Apprenticeship programs:\n\nAny employer;\n\nWorkforce Intermediary Sponsors\n\nTrade Associations\n\nAny labor organization which represents workers in the occupation for which the apprentices will be trained;\n\nLabor/Management Partnership (public or private)\n\nNew Jersey Local Education Agency (LEA);Public vocational schools within New Jersey;\n\nBachelor’s and Associate’s degree-granting IHE) physically located in New Jersey;\n\nPublic or private non-profit organizations (including Community-Based Organizations);\n\nBusiness or trade organizations representing a particular trade, group of trades, contractors or employers;\n\nNew Jersey local Workforce Development Boards;\n\nEconomic development organizations.\n\n*The above list of eligible applicants must demonstrate that they have met the Required\n\nPartnerships for Funding in the previous section.\n\n*Private, for profit, out of state, and non-public online IHE entities are not eligible for\n\nfunding under this NGO.\n\n*Organizations awarded FY21 NJPLACE funding are not eligible for this grant opportunity\n\nView Entire NGO\n\nNOTICE OF GRANT OPPORTUNITY (NGO)\n\nAnnouncement Date: November 22, 2021\n\nTechnical Assistance Workshop: December 6, 2021\n\nApplication Due Date: December 20, 2021\n\nFor Technical Assistance Contact:\n\nName: Patricia Jordan\n\nDivision: Workforce Development\n\nTelephone Number: N/A\n\nEmail Address: YouthPrograms@dol.nj.gov\n\nStart Date and End Date of Grant Program: February 1, 2022 - January 31, 2023\n\nPurpose for Which Funds will be Used: The NJDOL Office of Youth Programs will administer the Bridges program continuation to provide specialized workforce development services to youth with disabilities, justice-involved youth, youth who are or have aged out of foster care, and pregnant or parenting youth, in an effort to enhance the current practices and systems intended to serve their needs.

Due to the rise of globalization, international trade, advances in information technology, mechanical automation of production processes, and reductions in union membership over the past few decades, American workers have found themselves displaced by new technologies and in competition with overseas labor markets. Advances in technology have increased the use of mechanization in the production process and in professional spaces that are not often attributed to skill-biased technical change.

Within the workforce development system, pre-apprenticeships serve a critical role for people to acquire career-specific skills, advance work-readiness, and connect them to longer-term career opportunities.\n\nEntities that can apply for funding under this NGO: This competitive grant opportunity is open to the following entities:\n\nAny employer;\n\nWorkforce Intermediary Sponsors;\n\nEmployer / Trade Associations;\n\nAny labor organization which represents workers in the occupation for which the apprentices will be trained;\n\nLabor/Management Partnership (public or private);\n\nNew Jersey Local Education Agency (LEA);\n\nPublic vocational schools within New Jersey;\n\nPublic high schools within New Jersey;\n\nTwo- and four-year institutions of higher education;\n\nPublic or private non-profit organizations (including Community Based Organizations);\n\nBusiness or trade organizations representing a particular trade, group of trades, contractors or employers;\n\nCommunity-based organizations;\n\nNew Jersey local Workforce Development Boards;\n\nEconomic development organizations;\n\nLocal governments within New Jersey;\n\nCounty governments within New Jersey;\n\nAny other private educational or training entity.\n\nRound 2 applications are open to those not funded in Round 1 as well as new applicants.\n\nView Entire NGO\n\nNOTICE OF GRANT OPPORTUNITY (NGO)\n\nAnnouncement Date: April 19, 2021\n\nTechnical Assistance Workshop: April 27, 2021 at 11:00am OR May 11, 2021 at 11:00am\n\nRegister: NJBUILDPrograms@dol.nj.gov\n\nLetter of Intent Due Date: No later than 12 noon on May 17, 2021\n\nApplication Due Date: No later than 12 noon on May 24, 2021\n\nFunding Amount: $1,000,000\n\nTechnical Assistance Contact:\n\nName: Lauren Kremper-Di Filippo\n\nDivision: NJBUILD\n\nEmail Address: Lauren.Kremper-Difilippo@dol.nj.gov\n\nApplication Due Date: No later than 12 noon on May 24, 2021\n\nPurpose for which funds will be used: The Women and Minority Groups in Construction Trades grant will assist in providing greater employment opportunities for females and minorities, residing in New Jersey, by providing pre-apprenticeship training, workforce readiness/employability, and a structured work experience which will emphasize vocational-based training for entry-level skills in the construction trades.\n\nEntities that can apply for funding under this NGO: This competitive grant opportunity is open to the following entities:\n\nCounty or municipal governments;\n\nPublic training providers or trade schools;\n\nCommunity-based organizations;\n\nLabor organizations;\n\nEmployers and/or contractors;\n\nPublic vocational schools;\n\nInstitutions of higher education;\n\nPublic or private, non-profit agencies; or\n\nTrade organizations which represent a particular trade, group of trades, contractors or employers.\n\nView Entire NGO\n\nNOTICE OF GRANT OPPORTUNITY (NGO)\n\nAnnouncement Date: April 16, 2021\n\nTechnical Assistance Workshop: April 23, 2021\n\nApplication Due Date: May 14, 2021\n\nTechnical Assistance Contact:\n\nName: Christopher McKelvey\n\nDivision: Workforce Development – Office of Transitional Workforce Services\n\nTelephone Number: 609-292-6574\n\nEmail Address: Christopher.McKelvey@dol.nj.gov\n\nStart Date and End Date of Grant Program: June 2021 thru May 2022\n\nPurpose for which funds will be used: This competitive Notice of Grant Opportunity (NGO) aims to increase opportunities for the employment of parolees and reduce the likelihood of parolee recidivism. The New Jersey Department of Labor (NJDOL), in collaboration with the State Parole Board (SPB), seeks to fund proposals that will provide employment preparation and placement services, on a fee-for-service basis, to parolees of the SPB. There are over 15,000 offenders throughout New Jersey under the supervision of the SPB. The offender population has a much harder time returning to the workforce than other populations of job seekers. They often have multiple barriers to employment and require additional services and unique approaches to resolving issues.

Due to the rise of globalization, international trade, advances in information technology, mechanical automation of production processes, and reductions in union membership over the past few decades, American workers have found themselves displaced by new technologies and in competition with overseas labor markets. Advances in technology have increased the use of mechanization in the production process and in professional spaces that are not often attributed to skill-biased technical change. These technological advances have increased demand for more technically advanced, high-skilled positions that require occupational training at the secondary, post-secondary, and adult education levels.\n\nEntities that can apply for funding under this NGO: This competitive grant opportunity is open to the following entities who are developing new, or building upon existing Registered Apprenticeship programs:\n\nAny employer;\n\nEmployer /Trade Associations\n\nAny labor organization which represents workers in the occupation for which the apprentices will be trained;\n\nLabor/Management Partnership (public or private)\n\nNew Jersey Local Education Agency (LEA);\n\nPublic vocational schools within New Jersey;\n\nTwo- and four-year institutions of higher education;\n\nPublic or private non-profit organizations (including Community Based Organizations);\n\nBusiness or trade organizations representing a particular trade, group of trades, contractors or employers;\n\nCommunity-based organizations;\n\nNew Jersey local Workforce Development Boards;\n\nEconomic development organizations;\n\nWorkforce Intermediary Sponsors\n\nView Entire NGO\n\nNOTICE OF GRANT OPPORTUNITY (NGO)\n\nAnnouncement Date: March 24, 2021\n\nApplication Deadline: Applications must be received by 3:00 p.m. on Tuesday, April 27, 2021\n\nTechnical Assistance Contact:\n\nName: Ms. Gerri Brosh\n\nDivision: Workforce Development\n\nTelephone Number: 609 777-1516\n\nEmail Address: gerri.brosh@dol.nj.gov\n\nStart Date and End Date of Grant Program: April 27,2021 - April 26,2022\n\nPurpose for which funds will be used: The Innovation and Research Fellowship Program (IRFP) grant funds are provided to support technological research and the innovation ecosystem in New Jersey and to encourage Ph.D. graduates to continue their research in fellowship with New Jersey’s science and technology companies.\n\nEntities that can apply for funding under this NGO: Within the submittal of a joint application, both the applicant employer and the applicant fellow must meet the criteria set forth:\n\nApplicant Employer Eligibility\n\nIts primary business is the provision of a scientific process, product, or service and, the applicant employer owns, has filed for, or has a license to use protected proprietary intellectual property;\n\nIt has a Business Certificate to do business in New Jersey;\n\nIt is organized as a C Corp or LLC with a business plan; and\n\nIt is not an education institution or a home-based operation.\n\nApplicant Fellow Eligibility\n\nThe Fellow applicant must have received a Ph.D. degree from a college or university in the United States or United States territories within the past 18 months; and\n\nThe Fellow applicant must be a United States citizen, be a legal permanent resident, or possess all of the following: a valid immigrant visa, a valid employment authorization document, and an I-485 application pending with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service--Fellow applicants seeking Optional Practical Training (OPT) are not eligible to apply for the IRFP grant.\n\nFellow applicant preference will be given to graduates from a New Jersey education institution or to a New Jersey resident who graduates from an education institution outside of New Jersey.\n\nView Entire NGO\n\nNOTICE OF GRANT OPPORTUNITY (NGO)\n\nAnnouncement Date: March 22, 2021\n\nTechnical Assistance Workshop: March 31, 2021 at 1:00pm OR April 21, 2021 at 1:00pm\n\nRegister: NJBUILDPrograms@dol.nj.gov\n\nLetter of Intent Due Date: No later than 12 noon on May 7, 2021\n\nApplication Due Date: No later than 12 noon on May 14, 2021\n\nFunding Amount: $1,200,000\n\nTechnical Assistance Contact:\n\nName: Lauren Kremper-Di Filippo\n\nDivision: NJBUILD\n\nEmail Address: Lauren.Kremper-Difilippo@dol.nj.gov\n\nPurpose for which funds will be used: Helmets to Hardhats is a national program that was formed to help National Guard, Reserve, retired and transitioning active-duty military members connect to quality career and training opportunities in the construction industry.
