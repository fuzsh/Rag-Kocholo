        "text": "Grant History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nScotland\n\nIreland\n\nDespite claims to the contrary there is evidence that the surname claims descent from the Grants or Grands of Grand Court in St. Michel du Treport, and were the Counts of Eu. Recognizing that the Norman history does not necessarily conflict and remembering that the Normans were overrun by the Vikings in the 9th century the name Grant is still correctly interpreted as the Norman \"Grand\" meaning \"Big\" or Eminent.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Grant family\n\nThe surname Grant was first found in Inverness-shire (Gaelic: Siorrachd Inbhir Nis) divided between the present day Scottish Council Areas of Highland and Western Isles, and consisting of a large northern mainland area and various island areas off the west coast, the shire was anciently both a Pictish and Norwegian stronghold, where they held a family seat at Strathspey from very early times.\n\nThe earliest records of the name were found in the county of Inverness (in the modern Highland and Western Isles regions). One of the first listings of the Grant family in Scotland is that of Thomas Grant, a merchant of the king of Scotland who was deposed from his position as visor of York Castle on January 2, 1252. Later Lawrence and Robert Grant were witnesses at Inverness in 1258. Sir Laurence Grant was sheriff of Inverness in 1266.\n\nJohn le Graunt was taken prisoner at Dunbar in 1297 and was held at Gloucester Castle. Maurice Grant was sheriff of Inverness in 1330. Richard le Grant (also known as Richard Grant) was Archbishop of Canterbury from 1229 to 1231. 1\n\nThe motto \"Stand Fast\" evolved into a surname south of the Scottish border as the Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 included an entry for Thomas Stanfast, Oxfordshire. 2 In Norfolk, John Standfast, of Lynn, Norfolk was recorded there 3 Edward VI (during the third year of Edward VI's reign.) 3\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Grant family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Grant research.
