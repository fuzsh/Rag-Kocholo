        "text": "N\n\nNicole posted a condolence\n\nI met Donny while working at Super Store, he was so gentle and kind. Back in November 2022 I was 8 1/2 months pregnant and it was the first snow. I was rushing into Super Store with my lunch and a coffee, suddenly I slipped and tripped up over the curb. Donny was the first person by my side, he helped me get up and get me into the manager's office. After that he disappeared then all of a sudden he came back into the office with another lunch and coffee for me as my first one went all over the ground when I fell. I was so grateful for his kindness, something I will never forget. He will be greatly missed.\n\nJ\n\nJaidan uploaded photo(s)\n\n/public-file/316/Ultra/9b2d70b8-700d-4c55-ac0f-aae3788ea280.jpeg\n\nhi there. I am Jaidan, I met donny at school at MCTC. He would sit behind me on the third row to the very end on the right side. I had known Donny for 3 months and in those 3 short months, he was a character. He was the funny guy in the classroom. Just that type of guy to make class more fun and exciting and less judgeful. We had great convos to strange topics to serious ones. The first day, where we were learning about each other, he wrote “im a great listener”. Let me tell you, he was a great listener with an even better response. He was the type to be there for everyone to make sure everyone was good in the classroom, and not once did he mention his struggles or anything. he always had a positive attitude and always made sure the classroom was a fun-time. The last day i saw Donny without even knowing that it would be the last time, he continue to let me and a classmate shave his face to practice on and he did not once seemed off or anything, just continued to be the Donny we know. The things i will never forget about Donny is the belly button joke, his pencils and the sharpener, candy, and his little inside jokes. I will greatly miss Donny and I know he was doing this for his daughter and himself as well. But now i will do this for him and his daughter as he can rest in peace. He will always be apart of our team and i know he would’ve been a great RCW. The day we graduate, i will be looking up at Donny and telling him “We did it Donny”."
