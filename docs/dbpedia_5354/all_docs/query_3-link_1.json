I really like the name but find it hard to imagine a tiny squishy newborn or toddler with such a grown up name. I also am a serial nicknamer and it’s impossible for me not to give names nicknames, especially from one-syllable names. However, what in the world are nicknames for [name_m]Grant[/name_m] other than Granty? Gran sounds like grandma nickname… I figure he’d go by [name_m]Grant[/name_m] all the time but I know if I were calling to him or saying his name affectionately, I’d nickname it.\n\n(interestingly enough I had a foster dog named [name_m]Grant[/name_m] years ago, but cannot remember his nicknames at all)\n\nAdditionally if there’s other names that go well with [name_m]Grant[/name_m] I’m open to suggestions to pose to the husband\n\nThanks!\n\nI can’t really think of a nickname. Ant maybe while he’s young?\n\nOr you could use his nicknames. For example, a [name_m]Grant[/name_m] [name_m]Bennet[/name_m] could be [name_m]Gibby[/name_m].\n\nAre you looking for name suggestions? [name_m]Grant[/name_m] sounds modern, manly and isn’t too complicated so what about:\n\n[name_m]Alec[/name_m] “[name_m]Al[/name_m]”\n\n[name_m]Anders[/name_m] “[name_u]Andy[/name_u]”\n\n[name_u]August[/name_u] “[name_u]Gus[/name_u]”\n\n[name_m]Archer[/name_m] “[name_m]Archie[/name_m]”\n\n[name_m]Atlas[/name_m]\n\n[name_m]Abel[/name_m] “[name_m]Abe[/name_m]”\n\n[name_m]Alban[/name_m] “[name_m]Albie[/name_m]”\n\n[name_u]Beau[/name_u] “[name_m]Bowie[/name_m]” “[name_u]Bobby[/name_u]” “B”\n\n[name_m]Boone[/name_m] “[name_u]Boo[/name_u]” “B”\n\n[name_m]Bram[/name_m] “B”\n\n[name_m]Bennett[/name_m] “[name_m]Ben[/name_m]” “[name_m]Benny[/name_m]”\n\n[name_m]Beckett[/name_m] “[name_u]Beck[/name_u]”\n\n[name_m]Clark[/name_m]\n\n[name_m]Cyrus[/name_m] “[name_m]Cy[/name_m]” “[name_m]Russ[/name_m]”\n\n[name_m]Calvin[/name_m] “[name_u]Cal[/name_u]”\n\n[name_m]Cormac[/name_m] “[name_m]Mac[/name_m]”\n\n[name_m]Conrad[/name_m]\n\n[name_m]Clayton[/name_m] “[name_m]Clay[/name_m]”\n\n[name_u]Dexter[/name_u] “[name_m]Dex[/name_m]”\n\n[name_m]Dashiell[/name_m] “[name_u]Dash[/name_u]”\n\n[name_u]Drew[/name_u]\n\n[name_u]Ellis[/name_u]\n\n[name_m]Ford[/name_m]\n\n[name_m]Foster[/name_m]\n\n[name_m]Ferris[/name_m]\n\n[name_m]Felix[/name_m]\n\n[name_u]Flynn[/name_u]\n\n[name_u]Gus[/name_u]\n\n[name_m]Griffin[/name_m] “[name_m]Griff[/name_m]” “[name_u]Finn[/name_u]”\n\n[name_m]Garrett[/name_m] “Rett”\n\n[name_m]Gideon[/name_m] “[name_m]Donny[/name_m]”\n\n[name_m]Heath[/name_m]\n\n[name_m]Joel[/name_m] “[name_u]Joey[/name_u]”\n\n[name_u]Kieran[/name_u] “[name_m]Keen[/name_m]”\n\n[name_u]Luca[/name_u] “[name_m]Luke[/name_m]”\n\n[name_u]Lennon[/name_u] “[name_m]Lenny[/name_m]”\n\n[name_u]Lawrence[/name_u] “[name_m]Law[/name_m]”\n\n[name_m]Leon[/name_m] “[name_m]Leo[/name_m]”\n\n[name_m]Leander[/name_m] “[name_m]Leo[/name_m]” “[name_u]Andy[/name_u]”\n\n[name_m]Nathaniel[/name_m] “[name_m]Nate[/name_m]”\n\n[name_u]Orion[/name_u] “[name_u]Ori[/name_u]”\n\n[name_u]Percy[/name_u]\n\n[name_u]Phoenix[/name_u] “[name_u]Finn[/name_u]”\n\n[name_u]Rhys[/name_u]\n\n[name_m]Ralph[/name_m] “[name_m]Ralphie[/name_m]”\n\n[name_m]Reuben[/name_m] “Reu” “[name_m]Ben[/name_m]” “[name_m]Benny[/name_m]”\n\n[name_m]Ronan[/name_m] “[name_m]Ron[/name_m]” “[name_u]Ronnie[/name_u]” “[name_f]Ro[/name_f]”\n\n[name_u]Rohan[/name_u] “[name_f]Ro[/name_f]”\n\n[name_m]Shepherd[/name_m] “[name_m]Shep[/name_m]”\n\n[name_u]Sullivan[/name_u] “[name_u]Sully[/name_u]” “[name_u]Van[/name_u]”\n\n[name_m]Solomon[/name_m] “[name_m]Sol[/name_m]”\n\n[name_m]Tobias[/name_m] “[name_u]Toby[/name_u]”\n\n[name_m]Thatcher[/name_m] “[name_m]Thatch[/name_m]”\n\n[name_m]Tripp[/name_m]\n\n[name_m]Victor[/name_m] “[name_u]Vic[/name_u]” “Vix”\n\n[name_m]Vincent[/name_m] “[name_u]Vinny[/name_u]” “[name_m]Vince[/name_m]”\n\n[name_m]Walter[/name_m] “[name_m]Walt[/name_m]” “[name_u]Wally[/name_u]”\n\n[name_m]Xander[/name_m] “[name_m]Xan[/name_m]” “[name_u]Andy[/name_u]”\n\n[name_m]Zane[/name_m]\n\nI hear what y’all are saying… But it is almost a compulsion for me to add/edit/modify a name I use a lot. I think the foster dog I had who I named [name_m]Grant[/name_m] I ended up calling Grantie or [name_m]Grant[/name_m]-man… Which are more pet names (no pun intended) than true nicknames. One syllable names just beg for modification for me.\n\nPlus I am a [name_f]Katherine[/name_f], who spent years 0-17 mostly as a [name_f]Katie[/name_f] (parents called me [name_f]Katie[/name_f] and [name_f]Kate[/name_f], but friends used [name_f]Katie[/name_f]), and then college and up as a [name_f]Kate[/name_f]. I have quite liked the flexibility of a longer name. (not that it matters for a boy but if, as a girl who would take her husband’s last name, I were to have married someone w a rhyming last name Yates, for example, I like that I could transition back to [name_f]Katie[/name_f] as not to be [name_f]Kate[/name_f] Yates. I know that’s not a prime concern but just illustrates how I feel about adaptable, multi syllable first names. Much more potential! Unfortunately [name_m]David[/name_m] seems to like those one syllable names. (another person’s opinions never came into play my entire life of dreaming up baby name lists!!!)\n\nThank you for your input!"
