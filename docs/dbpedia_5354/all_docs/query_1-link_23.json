        "text": "Grant’s words in the Sydney Domain following the imprisonment of IWW leader, Tom Barker, that it would cost the capitalists £10,000 for each day served by Barker, had been seen by the state as evidence that he, and other Wobblies (as the IWW were known), were behind a series of arson attacks on business premises in Sydney.\n\nThe Twelve were gaoled for conspiracy to commit arson and to incite sedition and pervert justice. Grant was sentenced to 15 years’ gaol.\n\nAccording to the Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate, Grant was ‘spare of build with flaming red hair and a striking appearance … a gifted mob orator able to captivate, inspire and arouse his audiences’.\n\nWhen the Twelve were released early, following a New South Wales Royal Commission in 1920, Grant’s revolutionary enthusiasm was undiminished. A celebration of their release filled the Sydney Town Hall. Women distributed red camellias and the proceedings concluded with a rousing version of ‘The Red Flag’. Federal MP Frank Anstey and NSW MLA Jack Brookfield shared the platform and Grant, with typical passion and in his Scottish brogue, made it clear he was unbowed. He said: ‘If it is a crime to raise one’s voice against the taking of men from this country to be slaughtered in Europe, we are proud of being called seditious conspirators.’\n\nYet five years later, he was standing for the Senate for the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the party the Wobblies had condemned as ‘fakers’ and the parliament they had seen as a dead-end in the struggle to overthrow capitalism.\n\nAccording to Ian Turner in his meticulous account, Sydney’s Burning (1969), most of the Twelve ‘had had their fill of notoriety and were happy to abandon public life’. Not so Grant and two others, Tom Glynn and J. B. King. The latter two joined the new Communist Party of Australia while Grant backed the Industrial Socialist Party (ISP), unsuccessfully standing as a candidate in the federal election of 1922.\n\nThe ISP had been established by radical socialist ALP members but after Labor adopted the Socialist Objective in 1921, ISP members gradually moved back to the party.\n\nGrant joined the ALP in 1923 and remained active on the militant left. In 1927, he was again gaoled, for a week, over an unauthorised street demonstration protesting the execution of anarchists, Sacco and Vanzetti in Massachusetts. In 1931, he was arrested once more, this time for using insulting words to a policeman in the Sydney Domain.\n\nGrant’s acceptance of the ‘parliamentary road’ may also have been influenced by the fact that it was a Labor State government which called the Royal Commission leading to the release of the Twelve."
