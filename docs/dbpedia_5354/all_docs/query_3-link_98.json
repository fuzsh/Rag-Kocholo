She said that it was delivered by FedEx five hours later. She encouraged me to take advantage of this, but I told her it might be a scam and replied that she received the money. I contacted Agent Gloria Thomas who immediately sent me a short questionnaire/application and said I was qualified and do I want to continue. I told her through Messenger that I want to research the offer and messaged my friend and she said there's not an issue and even gave me the contact's name which was the same name of the agent. So I re-contacted the agent and she said to purchase a gift card for $500 and send her a photo of the front and back and she'll start the process. I did that, she received it and told me to purchase another gift card (Target) for $450 to cover shipping and handling. It was then I expressed concern and I told her I \"smell a scam\" as in my research I discovered that gift cards were a no-no. At that moment I realized I was never going to get my money back of $500. I relayed this info back to my friend and she assured me that she had to pay that up-front as well, so I did it and send the $450 picture of the gift card. The following day I received a message that the $150K would be delivered at 10 AM. When it didn't arrive, I sent another message and received an apology and she said IRS was auditing their activities and I would have to send $1200 to clear the IRS. I wrote back that this was not acceptable and to return the $950 I had sent her. My message came back with an apology from Agent Donald Mega, Director of Transportation Operations...again asking for the $1200. I told him to stick it you know where and he said \"Okay.\" A week later, he messaged me that the IRS fee was reduced to $500 and would I take care of this. I told him to give me an alternate method of payment and he said Zelle through my bank. I went to my bank the next morning and spoke to a VP about how to send some money through Zelle? She asked me why. I told her my story and she was surprised that I fell for it. It's a scam.....it's a scam and you'll never see your money again and showed me a list of gift card scams and this was one of them. I felt like a fool. I also sent this to the FBI and messaged my so-called friend who has yet to contact me and this happened the second week of May 2023."
