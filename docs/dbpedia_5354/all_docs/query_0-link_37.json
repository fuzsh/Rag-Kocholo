I really like the presentation and large print (yep, I'm getting older) but the quality of the illustrations vary widely. Some of them, like Queen of the Black Coast, look like they signed on a high school student for the art. But others are quite good (Red Nails, as an example). Still, they are very nice and well worth having in one's collection.\n\nPost by johnnypt on\n\nI've picked up all of the Grant books in this series, aside from Pool of the Black One (still looking).

I know they're still trying to get Harold Lamb's Rusudan out but not having any luck. Maybe in time for its hundredth in 2031."
