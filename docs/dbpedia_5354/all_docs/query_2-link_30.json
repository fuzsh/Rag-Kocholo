King wrote a few parts of The Plant and sent them out as chapbooks to his friends, instead of Christmas cards, in 1982, 1983, and 1985.

ABOUT THE BOOK. The Gunslinger is a dark-fantasy novel by American author Stephen King. It is the first volume in the Dark Tower series. The Gunslinger was first published in 1982 as a fix-up novel, joining five short stories that had been published between 1978 and 1981. King substantially revised the novel in 2003; this version has remained in print ever since, with the subtitle RESUMPTION. The story centers Roland Deschain, the last gunslinger, who has been chasing his adversary, \"the man in black,\" for many years. The novel fuses Western fiction with fantasy, science fiction, and horror, following Roland's trek through a vast desert and beyond in search of the man in black. Roland meets several people along his journey, including a boy named Jake, who travels with him part of the way. About the author. Stephen Edwin King (born September 21, 1947) is an American author. Called the \"King of Horror\", he has also explored other genres, among them suspense, crime, science-fiction, fantasy and mystery. He has also written approximately 200 short stories, most of which have been published in collections. His debut, Carrie (1974), established him in horror. Different Seasons (1982), a collection of four novellas, was his first major departure from the genre. Among the films adapted from King's fiction are Carrie, Christine, The Shining, The Dead Zone, Stand by Me, Misery, Dolores Claiborne, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile and It. He has published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman and has co-written works with other authors, notably his friend Peter Straub and sons Joe Hill and Owen King. He has also written nonfiction, notably On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft. MORE PHOTOS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST. Signed by Author(s).\n\nHardcover. Condition: Fine. 1st Edition.

The plot is not related to that of Walter Scott's 1825 novel of the same name, although there is one oblique reference to \"a Sir Walter Scott novel.\" The Talisman was nominated for the Locus and World Fantasy Awards in 1985. King and Straub followed up with a sequel, Black House (2001), that picks up with a now-adult Jack as a retired Los Angeles homicide detective trying to solve a series of murders in the small town of French Landing, Wisconsin.

SK presents a cavalcade tour of terrific books, films, and TV which have met his criteria for great terror and horror. He examines the attractions and satisfactions of horror stories, and recounts his own vital encounter with horror. In the fall of 1978, between The Stand and The Dead Zone, SK taught a course at the University of Maine on \"Themes in Supernatural Literature.\" As he writes in the foreword, he was nervous at the prospect of \"spending a lot of time in front of a lot of people talking about a subject in which I had previously only felt my way instinctively, like a blind man.\" The course apparently went well, and as with most teaching experiences, it was as instructive to the teacher - as to the students. Thanks to a suggestion from his former editor at Doubleday, King decided to write Danse Macabre as a personal record of the thoughts about horror that he developed and refined as a result. The outcome is an utterly charming book that reads as if King were sitting right there with you, shooting the breeze. He starts on October 4, 1957, when he was 10 years old, watching a Saturday matinee of Earth vs. the Flying Saucers. Just as the saucers were mounting their attack on 'Our Nation's Capital,' the movie was suddenly turned off. The manager of the theater walked out onto the stage and announced, \"The Russians have put a space satellite into orbit around the earth. They call it . Spootnik.\" That's how the whole book goes: one simple, yet surprisingly pertinent, anecdote or observation after another. King covers the gamut of terror and horror as he'd experienced it at that point in 1978 (a period of about 30 years): folk tales, literature, radio, good movies, junk movies, and the \"glass teat\". It's colorful, funny, nostalgic, and also strikingly intelligent. - Fiona Webster. Size: 8vo - over 7¾ - 9¾\" Tall. Signed by Author. Signed by Author(s).\n\nHard Cover. Condition: Fine.

Danse Macabre is a 1981 non-fiction book by Stephen King, about horror fiction in print, TV, radio, film and comics, and the influence of contemporary societal fears and anxieties on the genre. He dedicates the book to six \"great writers of the macabre\" who were still alive when he wrote the book: Robert Bloch, Jorge Luis Borges, Ray Bradbury, Frank Belknap Long, Donald Wandrei, and Manly Wade Wellman. Danse Macabre examines the various influences on King's own writing, and important genre texts of the 19th and 20th centuries. Danse Macabre explores the history of the genre as far back as the Victorian era, but primarily focuses on the 1950s to the 1970s (roughly the era covering King's own life at the time of publication). King peppers his book with informal academic insight, discussing archetypes, important authors, common narrative devices, \"the psychology of terror,\" and his key theory of \"Dionysian horror\".
