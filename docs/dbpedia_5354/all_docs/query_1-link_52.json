        "text": "What’s your favorite cause in climbing advocacy right now?\n\nIntroducing BIPOC/underserved children to climbing and making them feel welcome.\n\nWhat does it mean to you to be a climbing advocate?\n\nBeing the example that I wish I had seen when I started climbing. I wanted to see people who looked like me on the wall doing things I didn’t think were possible. I wanted someone who looked like me to come up and have a conversation with me. I wanted to not feel like I was the only cloud in the sky. I wanted to feel like I was part of a community, so I try to create community around me and be the person I wish I had.\n\nWhat’s your advice to new advocates?\n\nBe the example you want to see and make the change you want to happen. Be patient and empathetic, and always persevere. Change doesn’t happen overnight, and it is hard fought. Don’t be afraid to be vulnerable. Being vulnerable allows people to empathize, and with this understanding they can be willing to help facilitate change. This alone won't always be sufficient, there will be times when vulnerability isn’t enough. As climbers, we all know we have to get back up and try until our fingers bleed.\n\nWhat surprised you the most about getting into the advocacy world?\n\nI was surprised by the willful ignorance of the larger climbing community not understanding what outlying groups feel.\n\nWho is another climbing advocate whose work is really inspiring you right now?\n\nThere are many organizations doing amazing work right now. Organizations like Brown Girls Climb and The Gear Fund Collective have helped expand the community to a wider demographic."
