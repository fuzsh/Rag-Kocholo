        "text": "Donald M. Grant OBITUARY\n\nDonald M. Grant Aug. 19, 1932 – April 8, 2008 Resident of Moraga Donald M. Grant, longtime resident of Moraga, died at home on April 8, 2008 after a brief illness. Don, son of John Lynwood and Jean Law Grant, was born in San Francisco on August 19, 1932, and grew up in Marin and Sonoma Counties. A member of the University of California class of 1956 and a Cal yell leader, Don was a lifelong fan of Golden Bear athletics. Don served in the U.S. Army from 1956 to 1958, including a tour of duty in Frankfurt, Germany. His professional career in retail sales began at the Emporium. He later represented Tandy Brands and J. Jacobs. He was a founder and first chairman of the Moraga Country Club Swim Team. An enthusiastic and creative event planner, Don organized the Grant Clan Reunion of 2003 as well as the past twenty-two annual neighborhood Christmas parties. His thoughtfulness and generosity to family and friends was legendary. He is survived by his wife, Ann, daughter and son-in-law, Dana and Richard Sielman, and his grandchildren, Grant and Molly. He was preceded in death by his brother, Robert Bruce Grant. Friends and family are invited to a celebration of Don’s life on Saturday, April 19th at 11 AM at the Moraga Country Club Clubhouse. In lieu of flowers, please contribute to the charity of your choice."
