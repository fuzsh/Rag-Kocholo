        "text": "The spotlight he never sought flashed on Michael Donald Grant again Tuesday night during baseball's All‐Star Game, when Tom Seaver, on his return to New York, was greeted with a one‐minute standing ovation.\n\nTo many, that unusual burst of emotion was no more a salute to Seaver than a signal to Grant, the chairman of the Mets’ board of directors, that fans were unhappy he had traded away their hero.\n\nThe 73‐year‐old Grant remains forbidding gray figure with a threepointed handkerchief properly placed in his breast pocket, a glowering mart reacting angrily when his judgment as lord of the Mets is questioned.\n\nBut his friends call him Donnie.\n\nAt fund‐raising dinners they call him In the dais to regale people with his famed dialect jokes. And, as for his often‐arbitrary actions in dealing with his players, never, say his two sons, did he treat his children with anything less than respect.\n\n“He's portrayed as a rich, pompous curmudgeon,” says Mike Grant, his °icier son. “And it simply isn't true.”\n\n“First appearances are deceiving,” insists Tim Grant, the other son. “He seems pompous and overbearing. Even as kids, our friends were afraid of him. He was scary.”\n\nM. Donald Grant has always seen himself as a free‐wheeling spirit, soldier of fortune looking for new battles, hardly a stuffy man.\n\nTake his name. lie never used the initial “M.” In the Mets’ early years a newspaper columnist employed the initial in an attempt to ascribe stand‐offish formality to Grant, whom he disliked at the time.\n\n“The funny thing was,” says Grant, “I was listed in the phone hook as Don Grant. My friends didn't know Don wasn't my first name.”\n\nAs Don Grant. lie was a hockey allstar more than 50 years ago in Montreal, following in the steps of his fat her, Mike Grant.\n\nMike Grant is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, along with Rocket Richard and Gordie Howe and Howie ‐Morenz. The elder Grant was a captain of three Stanley Cup winners of the 1890's — the Victorias, the Shamrocks and the Crystals.\n\nDonald Grant's courtly appearance gives him a society air, a hint perhaps of posh private schooling. But his father ran a horseshoe business, and Donald Grant left school when he was 15 years old. He never returned.\n\n“I think.” says his son Mike, his family thought the automobile would never succeed in Canada because of the long winters, so they stayed in the horseshoe business too long. They never really had that much money.”\n\nDon Grant was one of Montreal's finest athletes. though. and when he was 20 years old and working for hank, the Montreal Canadiens offered him a contract to turn professional. The Canadiens were going to play at the newly built Forum.\n\n“I told them 1 didn't want a contract to play hockey,” says Grant. “I told them, ‘Instead of money just give me the program concession at the Forum.'”\n\nThey wouldn't, he refused to play for a salary, and he was finally persuaded by a cousin to leave Canada.\n\n“The man was David B. Mulligan, after whom the ‘Mulligan’ in golf is named,” says Grant. “He told me that if I stayed in Canada I wouldn't he able to keep my mind off hockey and other sports.”\n\nSo in 1924, with less than $100, Grant arrived in New York and went to see some hotel people. He became a night clerk at the Commodore.\n\nWent to Fahnestock in 1938\n\nHe also held other jobs. Even today, Grant likes to say:\n\n“Since I came to New York, there haven't been two consecutive years when I haven't worked at two jobs. I still do.”\n\nHe is also one of two senior partners at Fahnestock & Company, an old‐line stockbroker that caters to rather select individual investors.\n\n“We brought Don Grant in here in 1938,” recalls the man listed above Grant at Fahnestock, Sherburn Becker. “One of the partners here at the time said, ‘Here's a young man with something on the ball.'”\n\nGrant's rise almost to the top of the company was spectacular. But he was not a financial wizard, wheeler‐dealer in stock trading.\n\n“He's in the administrative end of the business,” explains Becker.\n\n“Grant had the knack of finding good young men and hiring them,” says one broker, who turned down Grant offer many years ago.\n\n“He runs a tight ship at Fahnestock. He keeps his costs down. He's been smart this way. He gets the most he can out of his old equipment. and he pays the young guys the least he can get away with.”\n\nMany fans believe, erroneously, that Grant's success at Fahnestock resulted from his dealings with Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson, the former Joan Whitney, one of the world's wealthiest women and the late owner of the Mets.\n\nBut Fahnestock never handled Mrs. Payson's stock dealings — her husband's company did — and Grant says he gave her only one bit of financial advice over the years.\n\n“When the Titans football team was for sale in 1963 I told her to buy it,” he explains. “We could have got it for less than a million dollars, but she said she didn't know anything about football.”\n\nGrant himself then offered the Titans’ owner, Harry Wismer, $250,000 for the club, leading Wismer to sneer, “That's just the sort of offer a night clerk in the Commodore Hotel would make.”\n\nA Meeting in Florida\n\nGrant met Mrs. Payson at luncheon in a private club in Florida in the early 1940's. During a game in which a collection of millionaires declared what they would do if they had one wish, Grant said that, if he had the money, he would own baseball team.\n\nSo did Mrs. Payson.\n\nShe started to talk to him about baseball, and each discovered that the other was a Giant fan. Over the years he bought Giants stock for her, as her associate rather than as Fahnestock executive. Grant eventually became a member of the Giants’ board, and Mrs. Payson was among their most loyal followers.\n\nThus, when the Giants moved to San Francisco it was natural for Mrs. Payson and Grant to want another baseball team. The team they created — she provided the money, he hired the management — became the Mets.\n\nGrant often looks backward these days, and he is angered and hurt by what he reads and hears about himself.\n\n“I cannot even go into my own seat in my own stadium,” he said of Shea Stadium after the Seaver trade. “I have become lower than the lowliest bum on the street.”\n\nGrant's distress is more noticeable lately to his family, with which he celebrated his 45th wedding anniversary yesterday. His wife. is the former Alice Waters of the Bronx. In addition to his sons, 39‐year‐old Mike and 36‐year‐old Tim, both of whom work for Fahnestock, he has daughter, Patsy Warner."
