        "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma will use $797.4 million in federal grant funding to expand broadband internet access in the state.\n\nThe National Telecommunications and Information Administration on Thursday announced approval of the state’s Initial Proposal Volume II, which outlines a sub-grantee selection process.\n\nThe Oklahoma Broadband Office is now on the clock, with one year to complete the process and award eligible internet service providers.\n\nNTIA approved Montana, Oklahoma and Vermont’s proposals Thursday. The federal agency awarded Oklahoma $797.4 million for the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment program, a part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s “Internet for All” initiative. States will use the more than $42 billion in BEAD funding to establish last-mile connections for unserved and underserved homes and businesses.\n\nOBO Executive Director Mike Sanders said the announcement is the result of months of intensive planning and stakeholder engagement to bridge the digital divide in the state.\n\n“Our office will continue to ensure this money goes directly to areas that don’t have high-speed internet access,” Sanders said in a statement.\n\nAccording to an OBO release, before the sub-grantee award process can begin, the office will administer a challenge process to determine which areas in Oklahoma are eligible for funding.\n\nSanders told the Journal Record on Monday that once an identified location is proven to be unserved or underserved, then the competitive application process can start.\n\nAccording to FCC data, Sanders said more than 400,000 Oklahomans are unserved or underserved. More than 95% of those areas are in rural Oklahoma, such as Beckham County, Roger Mills County, Craig County and Choctaw County. Sanders estimates a need for broadband in 75 counties, which includes pockets of Oklahoma and Tulsa County.\n\nMore than a year ago, the OBO, established in 2022, was asked to deploy $1.3 billion, but didn’t have high-speed internet in their office. Since then, Sanders said the right procedures and people have been in place to get broadband internet access to underserved and unserved areas, which included $374 million approved in January by the Oklahoma Broadband Governing Board.\n\n“We’re getting projects and shovels in the ground for that. That led us to our ARPA capital project funds, which here in the coming weeks, we’re going to be announcing $159 million of infrastructure build out, and then BEAD will come on top of that,” Sanders said.\n\nAs for a timeline for shovels in the ground, Sanders said it may be late 2024 or early 2025 before the grant agreement is signed. Once a community is selected, he said it may be a year from that date before dirt moves, but BEAD will level the playing field for rural communities, expand health and telehealth services and lead to economic development opportunities.\n\n“This could easily be that silver bullet that rural Oklahoma has been looking for for decades,” Sanders said.\n\nIf funds remain after deployment goals are met, it can be used on high-speed Internet adoption, training and workforce development efforts, among other eligible uses."
