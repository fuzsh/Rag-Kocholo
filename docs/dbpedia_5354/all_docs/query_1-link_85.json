        "text": "@JohnTaylor\n\nIt sure was a poignant letter letter that he wrote to his sister Clementine on the night before. \"Tina\" as he called her, was the rock of the family and to me she was my Auntie Clem\" - seated front right in the photo, My auntie Jesse, who emigrated to the USA, is seated next to her. Auntie Maggie is standing eft rear. Next to Donald is his lady friend Muriel McIntyre.\n\nThe remaining person is uncle George - another tragic figure, who was drowned in the surf off Malindi beach in 1931. He was a teacher at Jeanes School in Kabete Kenya and had gone down to Mombasa for a long weekend holiday.\n\nBack to Lt. Donald, this is the full text of his letter.............\n\n\"You will have had my letter, I mean the one I wrote to you yesterday. You will likely know before now that one of the biggest battles in the war is in progress. It has been kept very secret and it all depends on secrecy.\n\nTomorrow morning we go over at 8 o'clock and my platoon goes and by 10 o'clock I hope to have gained my objective which is near a beetroot factory.\n\nI am writing this but not going to post it but I am leaving it with one of our officers who will post it if anything happens to me.\n\nIf anything does happen to me please don't lose heart you will know that I died fighting for you all at home and that I died happy.\n\nNow I have not written to Muriel but will you tell her that I am sorry to leave her but some day we will meet in a far better land say goodbye to her for me and kiss hrr.\n\nI will now say goodbye to you all, give a kiss to every one for me.I feel happy now and will go into battle with great confidence and put my trust in God'\n\nYour loving brother\n\nDon\n\nI also attach another letter he wrote in April 1917. This expresses similar feelings of longing expressed by the poet Ewart A. Macintosh ( 4th Seaforths) who was killed the following day at Cambrai.\n\nOn 29/11/2023 at 18:50, tomdhu said:\n\nIsn't interesting just how the quality of his writing on his last night is compared to a few months earlier. The deterioration is pronounced and he obviously had a premonition. The stress must have been overpowering - even considering he had been on the front since 1914.\n\nWhere do you reckon he was in April 1917 when he wrote the earlier letter?\n\nThe letter written on the night before battle, with the intention that it should only be passed to his sister if he didn't survive, is indeed poignant.\n\nI see from Donald's MIC that he originally enlisted as a Private, but subsequently obtained a commission as a 2nd Lieutenant. You are, of course, aware of this, as you have said in one of your posts that if you had been him you would have declined the promotion. To me it seems quite likely that when he wrote the earlier letter of 12 April 1917 he would have been on his way back to the front having recently completed his training in the UK as a commissioned officer. He refers to being in charge of a company of men, and I think that at the time he wrote the letter they would probably have been at the base in Etaples, the Bull Ring, waiting for orders as to which unit they were to be allocated to, He had just learned at the time of writing that they were to go to the 152nd Brigade, though it appears that he did not yet know which Battalion. He expected to at least see the 6th Battalion, who were in the 152nd Brigade, and with whom he was obviously familiar (you say that he was with them right from the start of the war), and subsequently he must have been allocated to them, thus returning as an officer to the same unit as he had served with as a private, which I understand was quite unusual.\n\nI am sure that you are aware that you can download copies of the !/6th Seaforth Highlanders War Diaries for the relevant period from the National Archives Discovery website (for free if you register) reference WO-95-2867. I have had a quick look, and the relevant WD confirms that the 1/6th Seaforths were indeed engaged in a front line attack \"over the bags\" at about the time when Donald wrote the letter of 12 April 1917, suffering heavy losses of both officers and men. The WD records reinforcements of officers and ORs thereafter, naming a number of officers, but I haven't been able to see Donald's name amongst the officers joining at any time up to the end of April 1917. Perhaps I have missed him, or perhaps he was allocated to the 1/6th later, or for some reason, perhaps mere oversight, was not named in the battalion WD. The Brigade A & Q WD (which can also be downloaded from the NA) may have more detail of his allocation.\n\nFrom his MIC I see that he went to France on 1 May 1915, thus earning the 15 Star.\n\nThe reason why I am particularly interested in Donald is that my grandfather was also in the 51st Highland Division from May 1915 to January 1916, crossing to France as a Lieutenant with the 2/5th Lancashire Fusiliers, then in the 154th Brigade, on 3 May 1915. He left a memoir of his experiences which I published in 2020 under the title A Lancashire Fusilier's First World War. This may be of no interest at all to you, but I mention it because, being in the same Division, the 2/5th LF and the 1/6th Seaforths would have had very similar experiences during 1915.\n\nMy GF is mostly (but not always!) complimentary about his Scottish comrades. By the time the 2/5th LF left the 51st Division at the end of 1915 to go to the 55th (West Lancashire) Division he says:\n\nThe 154th Brigade ... had now left the famous 51st Division (Highland) and proceeded to a concentration area prior to the formation, or re-formation, of the 55th Division – the West Lancashires. We were sorry to leave our friends, the Scotchmen, but, at the same time, very pleased to be brought back to join our Lancashire Comrades.\n\nBy the way, I may be wrong, but I don't think that the letter of 12 April 1917 is in Donald's handwriting. I am no handwriting expert, but the handwriting is so very different that I don't think that the difference can be attributed merely to increased stress or to the discomfort of the conditions on the front line. The handwriting of the letter of 12 April 1917 looks more modern to me, and I wonder whether a family member may have transcribed the original. In fact, I wonder whether the initials and date in the bottom left hand corner \"C.M.M. 1987\" may have been added by the transcriber? Also, I think that the words \"(at ? pm)\" would be an odd thing to write in an original letter, and would be more likely to indicate that the transcriber is not sure what the original says.\n\nJust as an aside, I am curious as to what the words \"as you will see\" in the first sentence siginify. What could the Tina see? Is it just that Donald had received a letter from her as he was replying to it, or was there some form of official receipt that could be sent back, showing the exact time and date of receipt?\n\nThe later letter is clearly in Donald's own handwriting as it matches the writing on the envelope.\n\nI guess you are correct about the April letter being transcribed as the handwriting is just too different.\n\nI looked up the War Diary of 1/6th Seaforths and here is the relevant text for the 29th November....\n\n_____________________________________________--\n\nAn attempt was made by the second wave to push forward up to the FLESQUIERES TRENCH. Except at one point, this was found to be quite impossible.\n\nOn the Left, touch had been found with the 7th Gordon Hrs but no touch could be found on the Right as the 6th Gordon Hrs could not get through the wire and were held up by Heavy Machine Gun Fire. An attempt was made by the second wave to push forward up to the FLESQUIERES TRENCH. Except at one point, this was found to be quite impossible.\n\nIn spite of determined efforts made by the men led with great gallantry by their Officers, only one man succeeding in reaching the FLESQUIERES TRENCH. This was Lieut Grant who led his men forward along the Communication Trench on the E of FLESQUIERES WOOD. This officer leading his men drove the enemy in front of him until he cleared the Communication Trench. This was done with tremendous dash and gallantry. Lieut Grant bayonetted a good many of the enemy himself with one man left of his platoon; pg. 8 this officer was about to enter FLESQUIERES TRENCH, he having just jumped out of the Communications Trench, where he had done so well; when he and his Orderly were fatally shot.\n\nThis attempt cost heavy losses. Only one officer per company of the two leading companies were now left both being Junior Officers. I now pushed forward myself and quickly took in the whole situation. I then proceeded to re-organise both Companies. The enemy Machine Gun fire was very intense coming from the village, the wood and FLESQUIERES TRENCH. The Place seemed to be alive with Machine Guns. Tanks came up on our left, but as they had no petrol they could not go on. They, however, opened fire with 6 pounders and Lewis Guns on the village.\n\n____________________________________________-------\n\nThe trenches are clearly identified but the map I posted above is not too detailed, apart from the Flesquieres trench, so I am wondering if I marked the correct spot ie where Ravine Alley meets the Flesquieres trench. Would there have been several other communication trenches in that immediate area? Bear in mind his objective was the sugar beet factory."
