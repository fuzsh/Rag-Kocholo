And to discover what you don’t.\n\n\"When I visited I fell in love with the city of Minneapolis, the beauty on campus, and the kindness of the community. As a transfer student, I have been incredibly impressed by my professors' devotion to both their areas of study and connections with their students.\"\n\nAt #UMN, we celebrate success—from the everyday to the extraordinary. Here, you’ll discover your people, begin new adventures, explore fascinating ideas, and find your inspiration. Follow us on Instagram to see what it means to be #UMNproud.\n\n\"There are so many organizations and companies in and around the Twin Cities that are looking for young and motivated students to get out into the workforce and prove to employers that they have what it takes. This is what makes the University of Minnesota very special.\""
