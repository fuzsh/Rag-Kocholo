        "text": "OKLAHOMA death row inmate Donald Grant said “Yo, God, I got this\" as he was strapped to the gurney before his execution on Thursday for the brutal murder of two women.\n\nGrant, 46, was convicted of murdering two hotel employees during a robbery in 2001.\n\nThe two women who were killed - 29-year-old Brenda McElyea and 43-year-old Felicia Suzette Smith - reportedly suffered gunshot and stab wounds.\n\nAs Grant was put to death, witnesses said he had a single tear on his face and looked to family members to \"hold the fort down\" while a spiritual guide stood beside him.\n\n“No medication. I didn't take nothing. Brooklyn for life,\" he said as he delivered disjointed last words for two minutes.\n\nHe later chanted unintelligibly and continued to talk to witnesses despite his microphone being turned off.\n\nGrant received a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester and was declared dead at 10.16 am in the first execution of 2022.\n\nDuring a clemency hearing before he was put to death, Grant had also apologized for the deaths before blaming the devil.\n\n“First and foremost … I’d like to express my … sincere deep regrets and remorse for my actions,” he was quoted as saying in The Oklahoman.\n\n“I know words can’t bring them back. I understand. … I can’t change that. You know, I wish I could and everything.”\n\nRead our Donald Grant live blog for the very latest news and updates...\n\nGrant is not the only death row inmate to turn to religion or apologize as they were about to be executed.\n\n\"I'm going to heaven\" were the chilling final words of Ernest Lee Johnson as he was executed in the state of Missouri in October 2021.\n\nThe triple killer, who murdered three shop workers with a claw hammer in 1994, had seen last-minute requests for a stay of execution denied.\n\nHe also expressed remorse for his actions and love for his family and friends.\n\nIn his last statement, Johnson said: \"I am sorry and have remorse for what I do. I want to say that I love my family and friends, I am thankful of all that my lawyer has done for me.\n\n\"They made me feel love as if I was family to them, I love them all, for all the people that has prayed for me I thank them from the bottom of my heart. I love the Lord with all my heart and soul.\n\n\"If I am executed I know where I am going to heaven. Because I ask him to forgive me God everyone. Whit respected Ernest L Johnson (sic).\"\n\nJohnson's final meal consisted of two cheeseburgers, two milkshakes, a large pizza, and a side of onion rings, is not the only death row inmate to turn to religion and prayer for solace in his final moments.\n\n'I'M READY FATHER'\n\nIn September last year Christopher Vialva, 40, uttered his final words \"I'm ready, Father\" as he was executed.\n\nHe was pronounced dead after receiving a lethal injection at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana.\n\nVialva was 19 years old when he shot dead Christian youth preachers Todd and Stacie Bagley before torching them in the trunk of their car in 1999 in Texas.\n\nIn his final statement, the killer asked God to comfort the families of his victims, asking for \"healing their hearts with grace and love\".\n\nSince he was imprisoned, Vialva became a Messianic Jew and spent two years convincing prison staff to allow him to conduct weekly services.\n\n'I HOPE YOU DIE'\n\nOthers took a more \"ugly\" approach with one reportedly telling a victim's family he \"hoped they die.\"\n\nJournalist Michelle Lyons, who witnessed almost 300 people be put to death, said: \"We had two guys in one night, and the first had a really ugly statement where he was telling the victims' families, 'I hope y'all get in a crash and die on your way home.”\n\nHe also said: “You can kiss my ass,' and a whole bunch of stuff.”\n\nLyons explained: \"It really stood out that night because it was so ugly, but then the second execution afterward, the guy was so apologetic and was crying and telling the victim's family, 'I am so sorry I did this to you.'\n\n\"It was just such a crazy contrast to see in the space of 30 minutes, and it stuck with me.”\n\n'TIME TO GET THIS PARTY STARTED'\n\nJames Lewis Jackson was executed in 2007 after the 1997 murder of his stepdaughters and their mom in Houston, Texas.\n\nHe reportedly told the warden to \"murder\" him shortly before the lethal injection and was smiling before his death.\n\nJackson added: “Thank you to my family. I love you. Each and every one of you.\n\n“This is not the end, but the beginning of a new chapter for you and I, together forever. I’m ready to roll.\n\n\"Let’s get this party started.”\n\n20 MINUTE SPEECH\n\nJournalist Michelle said: \"Most of them don't talk for very long - there was one execution that I witnessed [the 2000 execution of Gary Graham], who spoke for over 20 minutes.\n\n\"They don't allow that usually. Usually, the warden will allow them to talk for about two minutes.\"\n\nFurthermore, a fellow final speech, delivered by Cameron Todd Willingham, saw a tirade directed at his ex-wife, including “every swear word you could imagine.”\n\nTELLING JOKES\n\nLyon recalled that warden signaled for the execution to begin while he continued hurling insults at her until he finally became silent.\n\nHowever, there are some that do produce some heartfelt moments in their final minutes.\n\nThe former journalist said: \"You do have some that would just do outlandish stuff.\n\n“We had one guy that was telling jokes, we had another that was referencing a song by a Texas songwriter called 'The Road Goes On Forever And The Party Never Ends.”\n\n'POTATO, POTATO, POTATO'\n\nRobert Charles Towery was executed over the death of philanthropist Robert Jones who was injected with battery acid and strangled during a 1991 robbery of his home.\n\nIn his final words before being put to death, Towery apologized to the victim’s family and friends, and to his own family.\n\nHe then spoke about the bad choices he had made in his life and concluded by saying, “I love my family. Potato, potato, potato.\"\n\nThat was thought to a coded message to his nephew that everything was ok.\n\n'HOW ABOUT THIS FOR A HEADLINE? FRENCH FRIES'\n\nJames French is said to have made a quip about his death and French fries in the days before his execution while speaking with a reporter.\n\nHis actual last words are reported to have been: \"Everything's already been said.\"\n\nBut he had told the reporter: \"How about this for a headline? French fries.\"\n\nFrench was sent to death row after killing his fellow inmate in prison.\n\nHe had been jailed for life for the murder of a driver who picked him up hitchhiking.\n\nBUNDY'S FINAL WORDS\n\nSerial killer Ted Bundy's final words baffled some.\n\nHe is reported to have said \"I’d like to give my love to my family and friends\" in his final moments.\n\nHe was put to death in 1989 after being convicted of killing dozens of women.\n\nNews anchor John Wilson said the comment confused him, telling The Tampa Bay Times: \"What friends?\"\n\n'I'D RATHER BE FISHING'\n\nFor others the moments before their execution offered a way to joke about the circumstances.\n\nKiller Jimmy Glass was executed in 1987 after the murder of a couple on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe high school dropout grinned as he was strapped into the chair.\n\nAsked if he had a final statement, he said, ″Yeah, I think I’d rather be fishing.″\n\n'GOOD PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SO SURE THEY'RE RIGHT'\n\nBut for some, their final words were more chilling.\n\nBarbara Graham was sent to death row in 1955 for the killing of Mabel Monohan during a botched robbery.\n\nShe is said to have held her breath for 60 seconds in an attempt to avoid her death in the gas chamber.\n\nHer last words were: \"Good people are always so sure they're right.\""
