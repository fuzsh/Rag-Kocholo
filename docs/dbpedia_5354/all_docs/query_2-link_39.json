        "text": "by Gary Romeo\n\nOne notices a lot of POD (print on demand) books on Amazon these days. In regard to Robert E. Howard most of these books are PD (public domain) and anyone with the software can publish a Robert E. Howard book. Most are reprints of Weird Tales stories and will have the edits made by Farnsworth Wright. Some will simply copy from the Project Gutenberg website. Most of those texts are from Weird Tales but some are not. I have seen Solomon Kane text (“The Hills of the Dead” for example) that was taken from the heavily edited Red Shadows Donald M. Grant version instead of Weird Tales. If a Howard fan is really concerned with textual purity, they should avoid these knock-off publications and just buy the Ballantine (Del Rey) Library of Robert E. Howard books.\n\nI can understand why some Howard fans are anxious to read this particular story though and don’t begrudge the reprinting of it in a relatively cheap edition. POD for sure, PD probably not. Everyone knows that several of Howard’s stories contain racially sensitive words/ideas. Howard’s words were edited for this reason as early as 1953, when Donald Wollheim edited the Ace Double paperback co-titled Conan the Conqueror. So, anyone in anyway, concerned about that aspect of Howard has a natural curiosity about this story. A “just how bad is it?” type of curiosity.\n\nI don’t want this brief review to go in that direction. Putting in a disclaimer is common practice for Howard reprints these days, most likely a good idea, and certainly the publisher’s prerogative.\n\nI will just be reviewing the non-fiction articles in this book.\n\nMy guess is that this book was produced by Italian REH fans. I’m surmising that from the introduction where the writer bemoans the fact that no Italian edition of “Post Oaks and Sand Roughs” is available and there are references to Italian books and authors later on. There is a brief REH biography, the story, and six articles in the book. Four by Andrea Larsen and the others by Ninni Raimondi and Mariella Bernacchi. One of Andrea Larsen’s articles is an appreciation of Jack London, so the “Larsen” surname is most likely adopted from London’s Wolf Larsen character.\n\nThe introduction appears to have been written in a foreign language first and then machine translated into English. The result is a few odd phrases like: “and often has like a head in the clouds.” Despite a little awkwardness it is readable. Some things cause a raised eyebrow but nothing too severe. Peaster is described as being on the edge of a desert. Texas has a desert, but it is further away from Peaster (or Cross Plains) than I would expect a non-Texan to know.\n\nThe introduction refers to Weird Tales as a prestigious magazine. It has certainly gained that reputation but in REH’s day that wasn’t the case. The introduction is prone to hyperbole as in calling Breckenridge Elkins “one of the public’s most beloved characters.” It also states that Howard “drives off into the desert and then once stopped at a random spot, shoots himself in the temple, killing himself instantly.” The author, Andrea Larsen, credits REH as the father of “Heroic Fantasy” instead of “Sword and Sorcery” which may or may not be a translation issue. He ends with a slight criticism of the Howard biopic, The Whole Wide World.\n\nIn the essay “A Brief Reflection on REH and Jack London” Andrea Larsen compares the two authors and states “Glenn Lord […] authorized a profound series of manipulations, changes and variations on [REH’s] original texts, leading for such actions a group he chose of writers.” Apparently referring to the racial editing of the Solomon Kane stories in particular, and the various authors Glenn employed like Lin Carter, Ramsey Campbell, Fred Blosser, Richard Lupoff, and others that edited or completed unfinished manuscripts. Larsen writes that “The Last White Man” is a “hidden” tale (the story was recently reprinted in Adventures in Science Fantasy, REH Foundation Press) in the Howardian oeuvre and the racial element “is a pretext or at least a background element. The real reasoning revolves around how at the pinnacle of greatness or at a given moment of a people, something breaks down and everything plunges into the horror of terrible degradation and svirilization. Whether white, black, or other color.” (Note: svirilization is probably a conjugated word derived from the Italian verb “svirilizzare” which means “to emasculate.”)\n\nThe article goes on to quote Spengler and Nietzsche to make the case that Howard and London were more like historians concerned with a deeper truth than merely writers obsessed with race.\n\nThe second essay “Why REH (in my opinion) did not kill himself” is a thought experiment by Andrea Larsen to cast doubt upon REH’s suicide. The author mistakenly states that Glenn Lord recruited Sprague de Camp to finish the Conan tales bringing Larsen’s whole thought experiment crashing down with this obvious error. The author goes on and does his best to “JFK” the suicide by mentioning REH’s claim of enemies (witnessed by E. Hoffmann Price) among other less convincing observations.\n\n“Some Interesting Facts” also by Larsen is interesting in parts. Larsen exaggerates REH’s status, “He was a writer who had achieved great fame in the country with his writings…” but otherwise makes some decent observations.\n\n“On the Last White Man” by Ninni Raimondi is short and similar to Larsen’s essay of REH and London. The basic thrust is that REH was “prophetic.”\n\n“Howard, in the sign of the snake” by Mariella Bernacchi is a very short essay previously published in Yorick Fantasy Magazineanno, October 1991, January 1992. It makes an argument that REH was anti-big business.\n\nThe book ends with a reprint of H. P. Lovecraft’s “In Memoriam: Robert Ervin Howard” from Skull Face, Northern Publishing, Fantacollana, 1978. It is followed by several photographs of REH.\n\nThis is an attractive well-made book. Nice cover, good paper, artwork, several photographs of REH, over 150 pages, and only $7. I doubt the publisher is making any profit on this book. Most likely it is a labor of love for whoever was involved in producing it. Aside from the obvious mistakes and my personal disagreements (I accept the standard status quo views) I’m not unhappy about its existence. It is instructional to read things with which you disagree. Plus, I needed a blog post!"
