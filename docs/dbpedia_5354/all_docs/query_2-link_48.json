        "text": "I take more than half of my classes online. Am I eligible for a PA State Grant?\n\nIn order to be eligible to receive a PA State Grant if you're taking more than half of your classes online, you must be attending a school that is headquartered and domiciled in PA.\n\nI am enrolled in an online program of study. Am I eligible for a PA State Grant?\n\nIn order to be eligible to receive a PA State Grant if you’re enrolled in an online program of study, you must be attending a school that is headquartered and domiciled in PA.\n\nAm I eligible for a PA State Grant if I am disabled and must take all of my classes through distance education?\n\nIf you are enrolled in an institution that is headquartered and domiciled in PA, then your enrollment in distance education will not impact your eligibility. However, if you are enrolled in an institution that is not headquartered and domiciled in PA, in order to be eligible you must:\n\nBe enrolled in a program of study that is structured to allow you to complete at least 50% of your credits or clock hours in the classroom.\n\nHave a medical disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\n\nIf this is applicable and you meet all other eligibility requirements, you may request an accommodation (exception) to the 50% in-classroom requirement of the PA State Grant Program. For information on how to request this accommodation, please visit our documents and forms page.\n\nHow do I know if my school is headquartered and domiciled in PA?\n\nIf your school is not physically located in PA, then your school is not domiciled in PA.\n\nWhile this list is not all-inclusive, please note that the following are considered headquartered in PA:\n\nPA Community Colleges\n\nPA's State System Higher System of Education Universities\n\nState-related institutions including Lincoln University, Pennsylvania State University, Temple University, and the University of Pittsburgh\n\nMost private 4-year institutions\n\nIf you are attending an institution located in PA, but it is owned by a parent company, the parent company must be headquartered in PA for the institution to be considered headquartered and domiciled (HQD). If the parent company is headquartered outside of PA, the institution is considered not headquartered and domiciled (Non-HQD). This means that students attending a Non-HQD institution are ineligible for the PA State Grant if taking more than 50% of courses online. Exceptions for students enrolled in approved programs of study may be made to this policy via the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accommodation. For information on the ADA accommodation form, please visit our documents and forms page.\n\nYou may contact us to verify if your school is considered headquartered and domiciled in PA.\n\nWhat is a grant?\n\nA grant is a financial aid award that you do not have to repay provided you meet the eligibility requirements and have provided accurate information on your application.\n\nWhat is the PA State Grant Program?\n\nThe PA State Grant Program is a financial assistance program that provides funding to eligible Pennsylvanians and helps them afford the costs of higher education at the undergraduate level.\n\nPHEAA administers the PA State Grant Program at no cost to taxpayers, ensuring that every dollar appropriated to the program goes directly to students.\n\nFunding for the PA State Grant Program may be paid in part or in whole by the Commonwealth of PA.\n\nWhat should I do before I apply for 2023-24?\n\nCreate an account through Account Access, an online student aid management tool operated by American Education Services, which is a division of PHEAA. You will also be redirected to this site during the FAFSA process.\n\nHere's some information that you'll want to have ready.\n\nIf applicable, the month and year your diploma was received (for High School or General Education Diploma)\n\nYour Social Security number—not your parent's or guardian's\n\nIf married, your spouse's nine-digit Social Security number\n\nIf you have a savings account through PA 529, you may need a recent account statement for the total savings, or visit pa529.com.\n\nHow do you determine my PA State Grant eligibility?\n\nPHEAA's Board of Directors annually reviews and approves the formula for determining need. If you meet all the eligibility requirements, we calculate PA State Grant eligibility in accordance with the federal need analysis formula, PA State Grant policies, and the Board-approved formula.\n\nIn May, conditional eligibility for the upcoming academic year is usually available in your PHEAA account. This provides you with an estimate of the amount you may be eligible to receive at the school listed as your first choice on the FAFSA® (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). The Commonwealth of PA appropriates funding for PA State Grant awards through its annual budget process. Therefore, PHEAA does not know how much funding will be available and cannot determine the final amount of your specific award until after the budget is passed usually in late June.\n\nOnce awards are finalized, the PA State Grant Program Manual (PDF) is published to provide you with the calculation details.\n\nWill award amounts be the same every academic year?\n\nThe awarding formula—calculated every academic year—considers three primary factors:\n\nThe funding provided for distributing awards\n\nThe number of applicants for PA State Grants\n\nThe financial need of the families of those applicants\n\nIn general, most students who qualify for a PA State Grant will also qualify the next year. However, the amount of your award can vary each year, depending on the three factors listed.\n\nIs it possible to qualify for 1 academic year and not the next?\n\nYes. You must demonstrate financial need for a PA State Grant each year you apply, and you must continue to meet other eligibility requirements.\n\nDoes it matter if another member of my family is also enrolled in college?\n\nFor the 2023-24 academic year and prior, yes. If you and another member of your family (excluding your parents if you are a dependent applicant) are enrolled in postsecondary institutions during the same academic year, PHEAA will consider this fact when determining your Expected Family Contribution (EFC).\n\nEffective with the 2024-25 academic year, the EFC has been replaced with a Student Aid Index (SAI), which will not use the number of family members enrolled in school as part of the calculation.\n\nWhy does PHEAA process my PA State Grant application using tax information from 2 years ago?\n\nPHEAA uses tax information from 2 years ago to determine a family’s financial need. For example, for the 2024-25 academic year, you must report your 2022 tax information. We adopted this practice to align with the FAFSA, which is the application that students must complete to apply for federal student aid.\n\nWhy do you need to know my family's adjusted gross income to determine the amount of my PA State Grant?\n\nPHEAA uses your family's adjusted gross income (not your family's net federal taxable income) from 2 years ago to determine your eligibility for a PA State Grant. For example, for the 2024-25 academic year, PHEAA will use tax information from 2022.\n\nBy using your family's adjusted gross income, we ensure that all applicants are processed in a uniform manner. If we were to use your family's net federal taxable income, then families who claim significantly more deductions on their taxes (for mortgage interest, real estate taxes, charitable contributions, or other similar deductions) would have an advantage over families who do not qualify for such deductions.\n\nBe aware that your adjusted gross income is only one component that we use to calculate the amount of your PA State Grant award.\n\nDoes the value of my PA 529 College Savings Plan affect my PA State Grant?\n\nNo. The PA State Grant Form provides the opportunity for first-time applicants to indicate if they participate in the PA 529 College Savings Plan and to provide a value for the current value of those funds. Although you or your parents may need to include the value of PA 529 College Savings Plan as part of your/their assets on the FAFSA, if you complete the appropriate information on the PA State Grant Form, PHEAA will not use the portion of your assets that are invested in a PA 529 College Savings Plan when determining eligibility for PA State Grant aid. All other 529 College Savings Plans are counted as assets on the FAFSA and for PA State Grant purposes. For returning students who reported asset values on the FAFSA, notify us of your PA 529 College Savings Plan values by using the appropriate academic year Asset Clarification Form. You can find the form in the PA State Grant Documents and Forms.\n\nLearn more about the PA 529 College Savings Plan!\n\nDoes the value of my PA Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) account affect my PA State Grant?\n\nNo. The FAFSA instructions state that ABLE accounts should not be included as part of investments.\n\nLearn more about the ABLE Plan!\n\nDo I have to be a PA resident to get a PA State Grant?\n\nYes, you must be a PA resident, as outlined in the PA State Grant law and policy.\n\nIf you are 18 years of age or older—You must be a PA resident for at least the 12 consecutive months immediately preceding your applicable PA State Grant filing deadline excluding any time you are enrolled in a PA postsecondary school, if you came into or remained in PA for the purpose of attending a school or college.\n\nIf you are under 18 years of age—You must have a supporting parent or guardian who meets the requirements.\n\n2023-24 Academic Year and 2024 Summer: If you've been asked to verify your residency, sign in to Account Access and submit documents via the File Upload feature. Select “PA State Grant“ as the reason for your upload with “Proof of Residency Information” as the category.\n\nWhat is \"domicile,\" and what does it have to do with my PA State Grant?\n\n\"Domicile\" is another word for your true, fixed, and permanent home—the place to which you intend to return despite temporary residences elsewhere or a temporary absence. You must have PA domicile in order to get a PA State Grant:\n\nStudents born and raised in PA who attend college in another state do not relinquish their PA domiciliary status simply because they are temporarily in another state. However, a student is no longer eligible for a PA State Grant if they attend college out of state and registers to vote in that state.\n\nA student who enters PA to attend college is not considered to be domiciled in PA.\n\nPA military personnel are presumed to maintain their PA domicile even though they are stationed out of state or overseas, unless the family has taken steps to become residents of that state or country.\n\n2023-24 Academic Year and 2024 Summer: If you've been asked to verify your residency, sign in to Account Access and submit documents via the File Upload feature. Select “PA State Grant“ as the reason for your upload with “Proof of Residency Information” as the category.\n\nMust I be a high school graduate to qualify for a PA State Grant?\n\nYes. You must be a graduate of an approved high school, a Department of Defense high school, a foreign high school that has obtained U.S. accreditation, have a General Education Diploma (GED) or another high school equivalency credential, or received a Keystone Diploma. Home education programs and distance-learning high schools are only eligible if specific criteria are met. Students who earned a secondary school diploma through the HiSet exam in a state other than Pennsylvania or through the TASC exam are not eligible. If you have received a diploma which does not comply with the previously stated requirements, please call the PA State Grant Program at 1-800-692-7392.\n\nIf requested by PHEAA, where should I send proof of my high school graduation (e.g., high school diploma, General Education Diploma (GED) certificate, etc.)?\n\n2023-24 Academic Year and 2024 Summer: Upload your documents by signing in to Account Access and using the File Upload feature. Select “PA State Grant” as the reason for your upload with “High School/GED Information” as the category. This will expedite our receipt of your information.\n\nWhere can I find more information about the PA Commonwealth Secondary School Diploma?\n\nPlease contact the PA Department of Education at:\n\nBy Phone—(717) 783-6788\n\nOnline—education.pa.gov\n\nOr write to:\n\nPA Department of Education\n\nCommonwealth Diploma Testing Program\n\n333 Market Street\n\nHarrisburg, PA 17126-0333\n\nDo my grades or GPA impact my PA State Grant award?\n\nA specific grade point average is not a requirement for PA State Grant eligibility. However, you must satisfactorily progress by completing the minimum number of credits commensurate with the PA State Grant awards you have received in the past.\n\nFor more information, please refer to Section II: Primary Eligibility Requirements for the PA State Grant Program under the \"Academic Progress\" section of the Rights and Responsibilities (PDF). Your school is responsible for reviewing your progress, correcting your PA State Grant record, and marking your term or terms ineligible when you fail to meet the requirement. You should consult with the Financial Aid Office at your school if you have questions regarding an ineligibility determination due to your lack of satisfactory academic progress.\n\nWhat is the deadline for PA State Grant applications?\n\nThe PA State Grant deadlines are different for first-time applicants, renewal applicants, summer-term applicants, and by the type of school you are attending. The PA State Grant deadlines are also different from the FAFSA deadline, which is required for federal aid.\n\nSee the PA State Grant Deadlines\n\nI missed the PA State Grant filing deadline for the academic year. What should I do?\n\nSubmit your FAFSA as soon as possible.\n\nWe may still consider applications received after the deadline for:\n\nApplicants who have a loss in expected family income due to a recent (after January 1) death, disability, retirement, unemployment, divorce, or separation of a parent\n\nApplicants who are recently discharged veterans\n\nWe may also consider a late application if extenuating circumstances delayed its filing.\n\n2023-24 Academic Year and 2024 Summer: If you have extenuating circumstances, supply documentation by signing in to Account Access and using the File Upload feature. Select ”PA State Grant” as the reason for your upload with “Late Appeal Information” as the category.\n\nWhy must I complete both the FAFSA and the PA State Grant Form?\n\nWe use the PA State Grant Form to collect a few more details about you and your family that aren't on the FAFSA to help us determine your eligibility and financial need for the PA State Grant Program. Typically, only first-time applicants need to complete the PA State Grant Form.\n\nWhy must I go to aesSuccess.org to complete the 2023-24 online PA State Grant Form?\n\nAmerican Education Services (aesSuccess.org) is a division of PHEAA. It's where we maintain Account Access, our PA State Grant online account management tool for 2023-24 and prior academic years. You must create an account and sign in to complete the 2023-24 PA State Grant Form online.\n\nYou may also view the status of your PA State Grant and make enrollment updates in Account Access.\n\nCreate an Account or Sign In\n\nHere's some information that you'll want to have ready when you go online to apply:\n\nIf applicable, the month and year your diploma was received (for High School or GED)\n\nYour Social Security number, not your parent's or guardian's. This will alleviate any processing issues.\n\nIf married, your spouse's nine-digit Social Security number\n\nIf you have a savings account through PA 529, you may need a recent account statement for the total savings, or visit pa529.com.\n\nStarting with the 2024-25 academic year, GrantUs will replace Account Access. Visit our Student Aid page for information about GrantUs.\n\nHow do I complete the FAFSA if my parents do not financially support me?\n\nDependency status is among the more common errors made on the FAFSA. Before you complete the FAFSA, first make sure you meet the requirements for financial independence. PHEAA uses these criteria to determine independence, although you may be asked to provide documentation to verify your current status. If you cannot meet any of these requirements, PHEAA uses additional criteria to determine your financially independent status.\n\nIf PHEAA considers you financially independent, we will process your PA State Grant without your parents' financial data.\n\n2023-24 Academic Year and 2024 Summer: If you have received a form from PHEAA regarding your dependency status, you can return that information electronically by signing in to Account Access and using the File Upload feature. Select “PA State Grant” as the reason for your upload with “Independence/Guardian Information” as the category.\n\nMust I include my stepparent's information on the application?\n\nYes, even if your stepparent does not financially contribute to your education. If the birth or adoptive parent whose information is included on the FAFSA has remarried, you must report both that parent's and stepparent's income and assets.\n\nWhat if my parents never married, separated or divorced, but live together? Whose information must I report on the application?\n\nYou must report both of your parents' information.\n\nDo I have to report the value of my family's home when I apply for a PA State Grant?\n\nNo. However, you must report the net worth (market value less remaining debt) of any second home or any other real estate investments.\n\nIF MY FAMILY RECEIVED CHILD SUPPORT, AM I REQUIRED TO REPORT THIS INFORMATION?\n\nEffective with the 2024-25 academic year, you must report child support received by the applicant (if the student is independent) or by the parent (if the student is dependent) for the last complete calendar year. This amount is used in the asset calculation portion of the SAI. For applicants who file after December 2023, this means that the child support received during 2023 must be reported. For applicants who filed before January 2024, this means that the child support received during the 2022 calendar year must be reported.\n\nMust I report all of my family's assets?\n\nWe do not consider any of the following assets when determining eligibility:\n\nQualified retirement account assets\n\nThe equity of your home (primary residence)\n\nPA 529 College Savings Plans\n\nFor the assets we do consider (such as an investment property), we allow you to subtract any remaining debt for which those assets are the collateral before we determine any expected contribution. For example, if you own an investment property with a market value of $50,000 and you have a mortgage of $30,000 on the property, PHEAA will use net assets of $20,000. Debt against your family's home cannot be used when determining the net worth of your family's other investments.\n\nI have received a request to verify the market value and debt of my family’s properties. How do I properly complete this request?\n\n2023-24 Academic Year and 2024 Summer:\n\nIf you are a dependent student, you and your parents should complete the Asset Clarification Form located under the \"Documents and Forms for Dependent Students\" section of the Documents and Forms page.\n\nIf you are an independent student, you should complete the Asset Clarification Form located under the \"Documents and Forms for Independent Students/Veterans\" section of the Documents and Forms page.\n\nDoes PHEAA provide any special processing for veterans for the PA State Grant Program?\n\nYes. To be eligible for a PA State Grant as a veteran applicant, you must:\n\nHave engaged in active service with the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, or Space Service; have been a commissioned officer in the Public Health Service on full-time duty; have been a commissioned officer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Environmental Science Services Administration; or have been a cadet or midshipman at one of the service academies\n\nHave been released under a condition other than dishonorable, bad conduct, uncharacterized, or other than honorable conditions\n\nIf not a veteran now, be a veteran by June 30 of the academic year for which you are requesting aid\n\nROTC (Reserve Officers’ Training Corps), current cadets or midshipmen at service academies, and National Guard, or Reservists who were not activated for duty for other than state or training purposes are not considered veterans.\n\nIf you meet these requirements, PHEAA will disregard your SAI or any Pell award you may be eligible to receive. This means that you will receive the highest PA State Grant possible based on the allowable college costs for the school you are attending.\n\n2023-24 Academic Year and 2024 Summer Term: To notify PHEAA of your veteran status (if not prompted to when completing the FAFSA), please download, complete and return the Veteran/Active Duty Clarification Form for the appropriate academic year. This form is located under the \"Documents and Forms for Independent Students/Veterans\" section of the Documents and Forms page.\n\nI've filled out the 2023-24 FAFSA, so why am I getting a message that you don't have my FAFSA data?\n\nThere are several reasons why you may get this message:\n\nYou just submitted your FAFSA online. If you completed and electronically signed your FAFSA within the past 24–48 hours, please allow several days for processing time and then try again. If you printed your FAFSA signature, please allow approximately 3 weeks for PHEAA to receive the FAFSA information.\n\nYour Social Security number doesn't match. If you didn't use the same Social Security number for your Account Access account and your FAFSA, we won't be able to match you to your FAFSA data.\n\nYou indicated that you are a graduate student. Students who already have a bachelor's degree are not eligible for a PA State Grant. If this was a mistake, you must update your FAFSA.\n\nWhat if I haven't yet decided on a school or been accepted?\n\nThe PA State Grant Form requires you to provide the name of a school. If you're unsure, list your first choice. When you make your final decision:\n\n2023-24 Academic Year and 2024 Summer: Update your college information in Account Access.\n\n2024-25 Academic Year: Update your FAFSA.\n\nWhat are designated PA Open-Admission institutions?\n\nThe Open-Admission schools that meet the U.S. Department of Education (ED) definition and were approved by the PHEAA Board of Directors for PA State Grant filing deadline purposes are:\n\nCheyney University of PA\n\nGratz College\n\nHarcum College\n\nHarrisburg University of Science and Technology\n\nLackawanna College\n\nPeirce College\n\nPA College of Technology\n\nPA Institute of Technology\n\nValley Forge Military College\n\nWhy might my PA State Grant eligibility be subject to a review?\n\nYour PA State Grant eligibility may be subject to a review since the PA State Grant Program is a financial assistance program that is funded in whole or in part by the Commonwealth of PA. PHEAA is responsible for administering the PA State Grant Program and ensuring that the data provided by applicants meets the eligibility requirements.\n\nHow will I know if my PA State Grant Record is under review?\n\nPHEAA will notify you either by email or by a letter to your permanent home address.\n\n2023-24 Academic Year and 2024 Summer: Visit Account Access to check your PA State Grant status.\n\nHow can I be prepared for a review of the information used to review my PA State Grant eligibility?\n\nKeep copies of your state and federal tax returns, wage and tax statements, and all supporting schedules and forms. Among other financial components, PHEAA uses your family's adjusted gross income (not your family's net federal taxable income) to determine your eligibility for a PA State Grant. If you and/or your spouse or your parent(s)/parent/stepparent has indicated that a federal tax return will not be filed and are requested to provide such, you will need to provide a signed statement indicating why one was not filed. If a PA state tax return was filed, then you should submit a copy of that return with the signed statement. Please note that you will want to keep copies of all tax return information for all applicable years in which you have received or applied for PA State Grant aid since prior applications can be subject to review at any time.\n\nRead the Rights and Responsibilities (PDF) information to understand what you have agreed to by providing your signature and accepting an award.\n\nKeep copies of proof of residence. This information may be questioned, particularly if you and/or your family moved to PA within the past 5 years. It is recommended you keep state income tax returns, for example.\n\nWhat are my responsibilities as a PA State Grant applicant or recipient?\n\nFor an inclusive list of recipient responsibilities, please refer to the Rights and Responsibilities (PDF) information to understand what you have agreed to by providing your signature and accepting an award. In addition, you should:\n\nKeep your email address up-to-date with PA State Grants & Special Programs. Many requests for data verification will be sent to the email address which you provided on your FAFSA or PA State Grant Form. If you are a dependent student, and your parent provided a separate email on the FAFSA, the email notification will also be sent to the parental email address.\n\nMonitor your email. Requests for verification of data can happen even after school has begun and initial term funds have been applied to your school account. It is very important that you review your email account for any emails from the PA State Grant & Special Programs department of PHEAA.\n\nKeep your home address up-to-date with PA State Grants & Special Programs.\n\n2023-24 Academic Year and 2024 Summer: You may update your home address in Account Access or by sending the change in writing to PHEAA, PA State Grant & Special Programs, P.O. Box 8157, Harrisburg, PA 17105-8157. If you are using a P.O. Box, you should provide a physical address.\n\n2024-25 Academic Year: Update your information in the FAFSA.\n\nWhat do I need to know if I'm selected for a review?\n\nIf your PA State Grant record is selected for a review, you must TAKE ACTION IMMEDIATELY. Failure to respond to a review in a TIMELY manner with ALL information requested may result in one or more of the following:\n\nA delay of funds being sent to your school, should you be eligible after the review\n\nA delay in resolving the review resulting in PHEAA requests for additional information\n\nCancellation of your awards\n\nRepayment of some or all of the PA State Grant funds that were previously disbursed to one or more schools on your behalf\n\nPlease note that most reviews require you to respond within 30 days. If you are unable to respond within 30 days, you should be aware that PA State Grant & Special Programs will not accept information after April 1 of the current academic year. For example, information for the 2024-25 academic year will not be accepted after April 1, 2025. If the request for information is dated after March 1 of the current academic year, you MUST contact PHEAA PA State Grant & Special Programs within 30 days.\n\nCAN INFORMATION BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY?\n\nYes. If you are returning your 2023-24 PA State Grant documentation, sign in to Account Access and select File Upload. Choose “PA State Grant” as the reason for your upload and select the appropriate category.\n\nI've submitted the requested information. How long will it take PA State Grant & Special Programs (PHEAA) to review my eligibility?\n\nIf your information is complete, it may take up to 4 to 6 weeks for PHEAA to verify or determine your eligibility. Student information is processed in order of date received.\n\nI've been notified by PHEAA that the review of my record is complete and I am eligible. When can I expect to receive my funds?\n\nIf it is before August 1 and you are enrolled for the upcoming fall term, you can generally expect your term award to be sent to your school immediately after the term begins. Please keep in mind that your school must fulfill obligations to certify your enrollment and eligibility for each term prior to crediting the PA State Grant funds to your account. If your PA State Grant record is being reviewed during the term in which you are enrolled, you may experience a longer delay in receiving your funds. Your receipt of funds is dependent on when PHEAA makes a disbursement to your school and/or the time it takes your school to certify your eligibility and enrollment. This process can take up to several weeks in some cases.\n\nWhat can I do to protect my personal information while fulfilling a request for information?\n\nWhen supplying information to PA State Grant & Special Programs, you must provide your full name and a numeric identifier. This may be the last four digits of your Social Security number or your complete 10-digit PHEAA assigned account number. When supplying copies of forms such as tax returns, you must provide the associated names (ex: your parents' names) but you may \"white out\" all but the last four digits of the Social Security numbers. You may also review PHEAA's privacy policy."
