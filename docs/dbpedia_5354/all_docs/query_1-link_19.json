This aim will test the hypothesis that EVD survivors will have long-lasting serologic evidence of infection than close contacts. We will determine the prevalence of serologic markers indicative of EBOV infection in a cohort of cases and household and community controls. Serologic markers measured over time for survivors will determine the durability of the response, while those markers found in household/community contacts will suggest asymptomatic Ebola infections.\n\nAim 2: Evaluate EVD related knowledge, attitude and practices among a cohort of survivors and household/community contacts in Kenema district, eastern province of Sierra Leone. This aim will test the hypothesis that EVD survivors have a greater understanding of the risk of Ebola transmission than their household contacts. The study of attitudes and practices will determine the level of contact that put contacts at increased risk of infection contacts. The study of attitudes and practices will determine the level of contact that put contacts at increased risk of infection."
