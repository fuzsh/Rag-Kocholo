        "text": "Why do you want this job?\n\nTo voice the concerns of the constituents in my riding. To go and voice what they want done in Ottawa and to show that you don't need a big fancy degree to be the voice of the people.\n\nWhat's the biggest issue for the country and in your riding?\n\nThe health-care system. Some seniors are concerned about mistreatment in hospitals or nursing homes, and many people have to deal with long waits in emergency rooms.\n\nWhat would you do with the Senate?\n\nI would abolish the Senate. I would take the money being spent on them and give it back to the people. That way we could lower taxes and do more important things with that money.\n\nWinnipeg was described as the most racist city in Canada. What would you do to combat racism?\n\nI would have more social programs, more opportunities for people of different backgrounds to interact with each other. Folklorama is a great example of what I mean, but more of it and on a bigger scale.\n\nWhat role should the federal government play in dealing with climate change?\n\nI think the government should really commit to actually dealing with global warming and climate change. We actually have to commit to some action; we have enough lip service.\n\nIf there was one government policy you think is done better in another country, what is it?\n\nI look at health care in countries like Sweden, and I think there's a lot we could learn from their way of doings things.\n\nUnder what circumstances is deficit spending a good choice?\n\nIf it's going to help people in general, and it absolutely has to be spent, if there aren't other options, that's when it's a good idea.\n\nWhat do you believe is the single most effective way to fight crime?\n\nI would like to increase the amount of officers actually patrolling streets compared to driving around in patrol cars.\n\nWhat should be done about homegrown terrorism?\n\nI'm not totally against Bill C-51, but it needs to be amended. And while terrorism is a real threat, you're much more likely to be hit by a car than be a victim of a terrorist attack here in Canada. It's not very high on the priorities.\n\nIf there was a gay pride parade in your riding, would you go? Why or why not?\n\nYes I would. I'm for equal rights for everybody. We're all the same, we're all human, we should all be treated the same.\n\nHave either you or your family had a frustrating experience with the health-care system, and what would you do to fix the problem?\n\nThe last time I went to the doctor, I waited all day. It was nine hours before I got to see the doctor. I took that day off work, so I lost a whole day's pay just being there. I would privatize a lot of the health-care system to help bring those wait times way down.\n\nWhat would you do to get more people to vote?\n\nElections Canada can't do anything on TV or in the paper to tell anyone to vote. The first thing I'd do is give them that ability back. Social media is also a tool we've got to really use to get the message out.\n\nWhat's a better use of federal dollars: fixing roads or building rapid transit infrastructure?\n\nDefinitely fixing roads. We've all got to drive to work and get somewhere. Fixing the roads benefits way more people.\n\nWould you support legalizing a small amount of marijuana? Have you ever tried it?\n\nYes, I would support it. People are being sent to jail for two or three years for just small amounts of marijuana, and they're not hurting anyone but themselves.\n\nAnd yes, I have tried it."
