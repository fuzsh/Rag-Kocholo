        "text": "THE DARK TOWER REVISITED\n\n“Ka was a wheel; it was also a net from which none ever escaped.”\n\nMichael Whelan and Stephen King first met in 1979 when both were Guests of Honor at the World Fantasy Convention. The meeting led to Whelan’s first illustration for King, the cover for a slipcased limited edition of Firestarter published by Phantasia Press."
