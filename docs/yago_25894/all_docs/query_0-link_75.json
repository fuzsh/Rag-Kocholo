She herself died, young, and without any children, at 26. Her other bad luck was sartorial: the poor thing had to live her whole adult life in Spain (which, as we all know, is where historical fashion goes to die). At least she had an adoring, if older, husband to dote on her.\n\nMaria Josepha was apparently notably pretty, and her state portrait captures her delicate features and elaborate garb: a gold embroidered satin gown with elaborate red train, lace trim, ostrich feather headpiece and lashings of emeralds. Just the thing for a green eyed brunette of tender years and royal status, or overdone and fussy? Or just boring for the timeperiod?"
