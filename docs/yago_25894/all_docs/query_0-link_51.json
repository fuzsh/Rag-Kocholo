        "text": "Ferdinand VII (1788-1833), King of Spain, eldest son of Charles IV and Queen Luisa. He intrigued against his parents and was banished from Madrid in 1807. When Napoleon invaded Spain in 1808, Charles abdicated in favour of his son but Ferdinand was brushed aside by Napoleon's brother Joseph Bonaparte. For six years, Ferdinand lived in exile on the estate of the French foreign minister Talleyrand at Valençay where the treaty was signed with Napoleon in 1813 that restored him to the throne. He married Maria Antonieta, daughter of Ferdinand IV of Naples, King of the Two Sicilies and secondly his niece, Maria Isabel Francisca (1797-1818), daughter of John VI, King of Portugal (see lot 166), thirdly Maria Josepha, fourth daughter of Prince Maximilian of Saxony and fourthly his niece Maria Cristina Ferdinanda of Naples, Queen Regent of Spain."
