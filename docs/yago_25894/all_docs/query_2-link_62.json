        "text": "Queen Maria Amalia of Saxony\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1744\n\nBonito, Giuseppe\n\nCharles III described Maria Amalia of Saxony (1724-1760) as possessing the wit of an angel, and felt himself to be the happiest and most fortunate man in the world. The portrait of his young wife reflects his affectionate words and the complicity between the married couple, since appearing in it is the crown that Charles wore in Palermo on the day of his enthronement as King of Naples and Sicily.\n\nCharles III as a Boy in his Study\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1724\n\nRanc, Jean\n\nDressed in blue, a Bourbon colour, Charles wears the Golden Fleece and the Order of the Saint-Esprit. The lily is a dynastic emblem while the jasmine, anemones, narcissi, pinks and roses are attributes of virtues and pleasures. Together with the book containing verses by Lucian, Columella and Virgil (his Eclogue IV on a new Golden Age), these objects are used to present Charles in his transition f\n\nInfante Antonio Pascual\n\nOil on canvas. 1800\n\nGoya y Lucientes, Francisco de\n\nThis is a preparatory sketch for The Family of Charles IV. Brother of Charles IV, the sitter was born in Naples in 1755. In 1795 he married his niece, the Infanta María Amalia, who died without heir in 1798. In 1808 Ferdinand VII appointed him president of the Junta Suprema of the government while the monarch was obliged to attend Napoleon’s summons to France. During the War of Independence\n\nPortrait of Ferdinand, Duke of Parma\n\nOil on canvas. 1756 - 1757\n\nBaldrighi, Giuseppe (?)\n\nEl retratado es Fernando de Borbón Parma (1751-1802), hijo de Felipe de Borbón, duque de Parma e infante de España, y de Luisa Isabel de Francia, hija de Luis XV. Su condición de nieto del rey Felipe V explica la llegada de la pintura a las colecciones reales españolas, conservando el Museo del Prado otro retrato suyo de igual procedencia que le representa en una edad algo más avanzada, debido a G\n\nAntonio Pascual of Bourbon and Saxony, Infante of Spain\n\nOil on canvas. 1767\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nMengs depicted the Infante Antonio (1755-1817), son of Charles III and Maria Amalia of Saxony, in the Palace of San Ildefonso, Segovia. The artist made use of the type of elegant, natural portrait that he had developed in Rome to depict English visitors. The Infante wears the insignias of the Orders of the Golden Fleece and of San Gennaro and Santiago.\n\nGabriel of Bourbon and Saxony, Infante of Spain\n\nOil on canvas. 1767\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nSon of Charles III and Maria Amalia of Saxony, Gabriel (1752-1788) was a celebrated patron of art and a translator of the Roman historian Sallust. He wears the Cross of Malta together with the insignias of the Orders of the Golden Fleece, San Gennaro and the Saint-Esprit. Mengs introduced a sense of naturalness and dignified simplicity into royal portraiture.\n\nThe Family of Carlos IV\n\nOil on canvas. 1800\n\nGoya y Lucientes, Francisco de\n\nThis portrait of the family of King Carlos IV (1748-1819) was painted in Aranjuez and Madrid in the spring and summer of 1800, shortly after Goya was named First Chamber Painter. It clearly show´s the artist´s mastery at individualizing characters. The forerunners to this complex composition are Louis-Michel van Loo´s Portrait of Felipe V and his Family (P02283) and Velázquez´s Las Meninas\n\nThe Family of Philip V\n\nOil on canvas. 1743\n\nLoo, Louis-Michel van\n\nThe King is depicted with his second wife, Isabella Farnese, at the centre of the composition. He appears surrounded by his descendants, soon-to-be Kings Ferdinand VI –son of the King’s first marriage– and Charles III, both with their respective wives, and all the other members of the royal family alive at that date. This portrait, at once intimate family and dynastic gathering, betrays curious an\n\nFerdinand IV, King of Naples\n\nOil on canvas. 1760\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nFerdinand IV (1751-1825) was the third son of Charles VII of Naples and his wife, Maria Amalia of Saxony. When his father acceded to the Spanish throne as Charles III in 1759, he became king of Naples. The sitter wears the Orders of the Golden Fleece and San Gennaro. His childish grace contrasts with the courtly pomp of the setting.\n\nCharles III\n\nOil on canvas. 1767\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nThis image of King Charles III was paired with a portrait of his wife, Maria Amalia of Saxony (P2201), although the image of the queen was not painted in her presence. Instead, it was invented on the basis of other likenesses, as she died before the artist was able to paint her.Mengs’s effigie of Charles III became the monarch’s official image and was therefore the object of various replicas. One\n\nMaria Luisa of Spain, Grand Duchess of Tuscany\n\nOil on canvas. 1770\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nDaughter of Charles III of Spain and Maria Amalia of Saxony, the sitter was born in Naples in 1745. In 1765 she married Leopold of Austria, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and bore sixteen children, including the Emperor Francis II. The sitter is depicted wearing an elegant grey silk dress, highlighted with lace, bows and other details, all executed in a notably virtuoso technique. The canvas forms a pair\n\nMaria Amalia de Saxony\n\nOil on canvas. 1738\n\nSilvestre the Younger, Louis de\n\nPainted in relation to the sitter’s forthcoming marriage to Charles VII of Naples, future Charles III of Spain, this portrait has an elegance and refinement that reflects the prevailing Rococo court style. The splendour and grandeur of Rigaud’s court portraits is here tempered in favour of a more delicate, decorative manner. Daughter of Frederick Augustus III, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony,\n\nThe Infanta María Isabel of Naples, Daughter of Charles III\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1745\n\nThe child in the portrait appears to be the Infanta María Isabel (1743-1749), the third daughter of Charles of Bourbon and Maria Amalia of Saxony, whose birth was received with special joy after the death of her two elder siblings. For this reason, she was portrayed on several occasions. She appears here as an heir being crowned by an angelic trumpeter.\n\nA Saxon Villager in her Kitchen\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1756\n\nHutin, Charles-François\n\nThis work and its pair, A Saxon Villager Driving a Barrel with a Wheelbarrow (P2271), may have been gifts sent by the Elector of Saxony, Augustus III, to his daughter, Queen Maria Amalia, and his son-in-law, Charles of Bourbon. This eighteenth-century taste for popular scenes is reflected in several of the monarch’s commissions, such as those for the tapestries of José del Castillo, Bayeu a\n\nCharles IV\n\nOil on unlined canvas. 1789\n\nGoya y Lucientes, Francisco de\n\nIn this full-length portrait, King Carlos IV (1748-1819) wears a red frock coat adorned with silver and carries a ruler´s staff. His decorations include the Golden Fleece and the sash of the order of Carlos III. The Royal crown rests on an ermine-lined purple robe on the table to his side. This painting is paired with Goya´s portrait of Queen María Luisa in a Dress with hooped (\n\nA Saxon Villager Driving a Barrel with a Wheelbarrow\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1756\n\nHutin, Charles-François\n\nThis canvas is an example of the 18th-century fascination with popular costumes and occupations. Charles III himself fostered the publication of prints on these subjects, both in Naples and in Spain, in order to draw attention to the diversity of his subjects. Like its pair, A Saxon Peasant Villager in her Kitchen (P2270), it was a gift of the Elector of Saxony, Augustus III, to his daughter Maria\n\nJavier of Bourbon and Saxony, Infante of Spain\n\nOil on canvas. 1767\n\nMengs, Anton Raphael\n\nFrancisco Javier (1757-1771), youngest son of Charles III and Maria Amalia of Saxony, was painted by Mengs in the Palace of San Ildefonso, Segovia, as were his brothers, Antonio and Gabriel. The pose and expression are particularly natural and the traditional accessories of royal portraiture are reduced to the column, curtain and insignias of the Orders of the Golden Fleece, Santiago and San Genna"
