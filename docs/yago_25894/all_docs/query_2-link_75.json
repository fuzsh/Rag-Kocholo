        "text": "REMEMBER ME. Augustus III continued. I was under the supervision of the Jesuits, who contributed to the cause. The public announcement of conversion in 1717 triggered discontent among the Protestant Saxon aristocracy. Faced with a hereditary Catholic succession for Saxony, Prussia and Hanover attempted to oust Saxony from the directorship of the Protestant body in the Reichstag of the Holy Roman Empire, but Saxony managed to retain the directorship.\n\nIn September 1714 I was welcomed by Louis XIV of France when he heard that I converted to Catholicism, which permitted me to stay at the royal court in Paris. During this time, I improved my knowledge of the French language and learned how to approach politics and diplomacy.\n\nIn June 1715, I departed Versailles and traveled across Europe, and the purpose of this trip was to understand how cities and villages function. However, being brought up in wealth, I was not aware of how extensive poverty and living conditions can be in the countryside.\n\nOn Aug. 20, 1719, I married Maria Josepha of Austria in an elaborate and splendorous celebration of the Baroque era in Europe. Over 800 guests were invited to a two-week celebration costing approximately 4 million thalers (silver coins). (To be continued.)\n\nPOLONUS POLISH PHILATELIC SOCIETY. The Polonus Philatelic is one of the most active philatelic societies that offer a wide variety of Polish and related philatelic material at their Polonus Store as well as eBay. The world of stamps is like an adventure, for in 2016 two circular stamps denominations of 2.25 zl and 5 zl were issued that recognized the European Handball Federation (EHF). The specific cities hosting the event were Krakow, Gdansk, Katowice and Wroclaw. The designer of these stamps was Agata Tobolczyk. Also in January 2016 a souvenir sheet was issued to recognize Wroclaw as the European Capital of Culture and the World Book Capital. The designer of this colorful 5 zl souvenir sheet was Aleksandra Pietrzak , In the September 2017 issue of the Polonus Bulletin, an article by Dr. James Mazepa, \"\"The Massive Franking of Polish Hyperinflation - 1923 - May 1924. The Polish mark was unstable on account of constant wars and uprising, especially the Polish Soviet War. Most money collected went to pay for the war efforts, and to appease the elites taxes did not rise to offset expenses.

The feast day of St. Andrew â Andrzejki is Nov. 30 a time when girls would gather together and tell each otherâs fortunes by pouring hot, melted wax into a bowl of cold water. The unusual shapes formed by the suddenly hardened wax were held against the light so that the shadows on the wall could reveal what the future held in store for the young lady who poured the wax. If the shadow on the wall resembled something used by a man, it meant that the girl would marry soon; if the shape on the wall resembled one of a women's accessories, it was a bad omen. Later, the girls would take off their shoes and put them alternately in a row from the stove to the door. The girl whose show went over the threshold first would be the first to marry.\n\nCURIOUS. Candles continued. The art of snuffling died out with the widespread use of semi-evaporating beeswax candles late in the 17th century. Beeswax was three times the price of tallow and the wax candles burned with a brighter flame. British diarist, Samuel Pepys wrote in 1667 that with the use of wax candles at London's Drury Lane Theater, the stage was \"\"now a thousand times better and more glorious.\"\" The Roman Catholic Church had already adopted the luxury of beeswax candles, and the very rich employed them for special occasions that called for extravagance. Household records of one of the great homes of Britain show that during the winter of 1765, the inhabitants consumed more than a hundred pounds of wax candles a month. Luxury candles during the next century would be the glossy white beeswax candle from England; a hard, vegetable yellow from China; and the green babyberry scented candle from the northeastern coast of America.\n\nMUSEUM CORNER.
