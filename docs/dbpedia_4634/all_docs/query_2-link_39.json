        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nThird POV\n\n10 minutes passed as the U.A. group took an earlier-than-expected break from the Death Battle videos after a certain fourth wall-breaking mercenary tested their patience to the limit. Throughout this time, Edgeshot and Iida kept to themselves to calm their heads, while the Flame Hero, Endeavor, found solace in his son, the two preferring to calm their heads with a more academic pursuit: their Dad-Might theories.\n\nMeanwhile, the main girls of the Sisterhood, save Jiro and Setsuna, were discussing among themselves with serious faces. Ochaco and Asui revealed to them all they gathered from Iida about the truth behind the Hosu Incident and the defeat of the Hero Killer Stain. Asui informed them of Iida's slip when she talked with him, and how he said Midoriya came to his rescue before correcting himself to say Endeavor like the story was told. Ochaco likewise noted Izuku's and Todoroki's glances at Iida and how Izuku seemed spooked at the sight of Stain yet kept his story straight about Endeavor doing all the real Hero Work.\n\nThe girls frowned at this as their thoughts were brought back to the video they watched last night, which contradicted what they knew of their green-haired crush. It showed Izuku, Todoroki, and Iida being the true victors against Stain and Izuku being the one that saved Iida from the Hero Killer not Endeavor saving the three boys from the Villain.\n\n\"But why would they say that Endeavor did it? Why lie about it?\" Hagakure asked out loud, giving voice to the girls' questions.\n\n\"I think I may know why,\" Momo muttered.\n\n\"Well, of course, you would, Yaomomo. You and that beautiful, big brain of yours,\" Mina cooed dramatically, rubbing the side of Momo's head.\n\n\"Mina,\" Momo whined, blushing embarrassingly.\n\n\"Okay, I think we can tease her about her impressive brain later, let's not waste anymore of our break, alright?\" Melissa asked, softly. Mina sighed. She and the others found the request reasonable as the break could be over at any minute.\n\n\"Shouldn't we wait till Jiro and Tokage are back?\" Nejire asked.\n\nNow that the periwinkle-haired girl had pointed it out, they glanced over to see Jiro still in conversation with All Might and Nezu. The former Number 1 Pro was still looking at Jiro's phone with earbuds in place while Jiro talked with the U.A. principal, who looked very serious and attentive to all her words. Meanwhile, none of them missed that Setsuna went off to have a conversation with the person they all were pining for, Izuku Midoriya, and has yet to return either. This was suspicious to them, and they even feared that Setsuna might be getting one over on all of them by getting Izuku alone with her.\n\n\"We can tell them about it later,\" Asui shrugged, seeing no use in worrying after already placing trust and comradery with each other. Additionally, even if Setsuna got to Midoriya's heart first, Asui wouldn't mind. Her heart's goal was mainly to get with the man of her dreams not caring whether she was first or last. All of them swore to each other when they formed their Sisterhood to share Midoriya with the ten of them, Setsuna included, and that was good enough for Asui.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, alright, make with the theories, Ponytail!\" Mei exclaimed.\n\nMomo sighed, shrugging off Mei's excitement, and forgetfulness of her name despite their allegiance. \"Well, if what Uraraka and Asui have gathered is true, Iida could have gone after Stain by himself without the permission of his Internship Hero, Manuel,\" Momo began to theorize. \"This could be likely because of how upset Iida must have been with Stain's attack on his brother, the former Ingenium.\"\n\n\"That is true. The Class Rep did seem quite depressed and determined to go to Hosu no matter what,\" Hagakure noted. \"But why would he assume that Stain was still going to be there?\"\n\n\"Ryukyu told me about Stain a bit when discussing potentially going after him,\" Nejire spoke, a more serious face on her than many of the girls have seen before. \"She said that Stain often stays in a city for as long until he hunts down and attacks at least 4 Heroes, and by then he had only attacked Ingenium. The news did say that he went after Native that night when the Nomu were released too.\"\n\n\"Iida must have also realized this or at least hoped for it and gone to Hosu to try and take revenge,\" Momo nodded. \"However, if he went after Stain without permission from Manuel, which seems likely, then it would be considered illegal Hero work at worst and Vigilantism at best, same if Midoriya and Todoroki fought Stain as well without any permission from their Internship Heroes.\"\n\n\"So, you're saying Endeavor taking down Stain was a cover story to prevent Izuku and the others from facing the consequences of facing Stain without permission?\" Melissa summarized.\n\n\"It's the most likely reason why those three haven't gotten any of the credit that the video showed or why they said that they aren't allowed to talk about the attack,\" Momo nodded.\n\n\"But that's not fair,\" Mina pouted, stamping her foot at the injustice. \"Midori, Iida, and Todoroki did something that no other Hero had been able to do and saved that Native guy's life. They should get the credit, not Endeavor.\"\n\n\"But then they would have also faced harsher punishment for technically breaking the law,\" Asui pointed out. \"It could have even affected their ability to remain at U.A. or continue being Heroes at all.\"\n\n\"Plus, I don't think Deku would have cared either way,\" Uraraka replied, a soft, loving smile on her face. \"Deku's not the kind of person who would want the fame or the glory, he just wants to help people, and he did that by saving Iida. So, if he were told to go along with the story, he would do it just for the chance to continue being a Hero.\"\n\n\"Heh, that does sound like Muscles, doesn't it?\" Mei chuckled fondly.\n\nFond and loving smiles grew on the faces of the girls at the selfless character of the guy they fell in love with.\n\nIt was then that the boy himself, as well as Setsuna, reentered the gym/makeshift theater. From the looks on their faces, whatever transpired between the two looked to have been a serious conversation, the two greenettes looking emotionally exhausted. They didn't appear mad or upset with each other, but it was clear whatever the result of their talk left one or both of them feeling awkward and contemplative. They also saw the two's eyes meet with Izuku giving her a nod that Setsuna returned with a soft smile.\n\nCoincidentally, Jiro had returned from her talk with All Might and Nezu, as well. The two adults looked very serious with All Might looking pale and worried, something that Melissa could see and frown with suspicion.\n\n\"So, what did we miss?\" Jiro asked as she and Setsuna returned, giving the greenette a raised eyebrow. It was unclear whether she was talking to the girls or Setsuna specifically.\n\nBefore either Tokage or the girls could respond, Nezu voiced out the end of the break and asked for everyone to reconvene in their seats.\n\n\"We'll talk later,\" Momo finished their meeting with a pointed look at Setsuna for good measure.\n\nSetsuna sighed tired. 'Looks like I got some explaining to do,' The greenette thought to herself.\n\nEventually, all the children and adults had been seated, and with a nod from Nezu, Mei clicked play on the next video.\n\n\"Imagine right now: What does the apocalyptic destroyer of worlds look like?\" Wiz asked the viewing audience.\n\nImmediately, the answer to such a question formed itself in many minds to either All For One or Shigaraki. Toshinori remembered the darker ages when All For One reigned supreme over the Villain Underworld, the sheer power he possessed that he fought with all his prime's might, and the resurging threat that was his nemesis and the League of Villains he helped flourish. Izuku and his friends thought the same, the Bakusquad, Bakugou, and many in the room remembering that sheer terror that All For One imposed on them, whether in person or on their television screens. However, Izuku also lumped Shigaraki especially with All For One as the horrifying and disgustingly joyful smile of Tomura Shigaraki back at the mall is still imprinted in his mind.\n\nHawks thought of the PLF leadership and their leader Shigaraki, as well as the army under their following, especially Gigantomachia and Twice, the latter of the two also administering guilt into Hawks's conscience. Kirishima and Mina both also added Gigantomachia as their envisioned destroyer of worlds in their universe, the trauma of that day still engraved into their minds and only reawakened with his earlier reveal as a counterpart to another character.\n\n\"Stop thinking, because you're wrong,\" Boomstick answered. \"It's these pudgy pink terrors.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\" Mina raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"Kirby, Nintendo's floating puffball of never-ending cheer and dreams,\" Boomstick revealed the first destroyer of worlds.\n\n\"And Majin Buu, the most vicious monster in the Dragon Ball Universe,\" Wiz revealed the second.\n\n\"These are what they believe to be Destroyer of Worlds?\" Endeavor raised an eyebrow, his annoyance with this series of videos already coming back with a vengeance.\n\n\"Hey, don't count them out yet, Number 1. After all, all these videos have already shown you that appearances can be deceiving,\" Miruko snickered.\n\n\"Can you verify if any of these characters exist in universes we already have seen, Midoriya?\" David Shield asked the green-haired boy.\n\n\"I think so,\" Izuku pulled out and flipped through his notes. \"Mostly the latter one. Wiz said that Majin Buu exists in the Dragon Ball Universe. That's the one with Goku, Vegeta, and the Dragon Balls, the orbs that grant wishes.\"\n\n\"Wait, you mean the same universe where your counterpart fought against guys that blow up planets with their fingertips?\" Kaminari pointed out, remembering Goku defeating Frieza and facing off against Superman in their Death Battle.\n\n\"Then just how powerful is that pink blob?!\" Mineta exclaimed in fear.\n\n\"He's Wiz and I'm Boomstick,\" Boomstick announced them both.\n\n\"And it's our job to analyze their weapons, armor, and skills to find out who would win a Death Battle!\" Wiz finished the intro.\n\nThe first fighter was the opposite of what anyone would believe to be a Destroyer of Worlds. The being was round and pink with stubby protrusions for arms, with red, oval-like feet or shoes but none of the group could see the connecting legs. The pink puffball also had one of the most adorable and innocent faces the group had ever seen. Two ovalish blue eyes that screamed happiness, accompanied by a usually smiling mouth and ever-constant rosy, pink cheeks. The pink cheeks looked so familiar, Ochaco's own burned ever brighter when she realized everyone looking at her as a comparison.\n\nRegardless, all of the girls pretty much cooed at the sight of the adorable walking thing that blessed their eyes, especially Eri as her mouth opened to a similar wide smile of innocence and joy. Nezu, meanwhile, had a chill roll up his spine that reached and sparked a flash of activity in his brain. The rodent principal did not know what to make of this sudden feeling. Was it some instinctual primal fear, or was it some sense of commonality?\n\n'But then what would there be between us that would be common?' Nezu thought, and his massively intelligent brain came up with an answer in seconds. The next thing the adults knew, chills up their spines came as they heard the Principal of U.A. chuckle menacingly and maniacally, especially those under the principal's employment.\n\nKirby\n\n\"Over a thousand years ago, an epic war waged throughout the universe,\" Wiz began, showing two separate fleets of armadas flying toward each other. One side had multiple, similarly shaped and looking beings similar to the current fighter, including one with a white mask, glowing yellow eyes, a large cape, and a spiked, golden sword. The other side seemed to include many different monsters, with their supposed leader's caped and clawed figure covered in shadow. \"The legendary Star Warriors battled against the vile Nightmare for the freedom of everything that ever was.\"\n\nKoda yelped and hid behind his hands at the sight of some of these monsters, particularly an inhumanly large centipede-like monster.\n\nIzuku frowned and began writing down info about this universe, especially drawing that one caped and masked Star Warrior given his more focused prominence in the clip. 'They look similar to the first fighter by their shape and features. Are they perhaps Kirby's people or race?' Izuku asked himself.\n\n\"Ultimately, good prevailed, but at the cost of many, many lives,\" Wiz continued, showing the devastating aftermath, including one Star Warrior's sword embedded in the ground.\n\nEndeavor and Hawks flinched, looking toward each other. War was also coming to their country, and the other side, the evil side as they saw it, was too powerful and dangerous to allow them to make any sort of moves. Both Heroes knew with the way things were with their forces if the Villains struck first or were met with an equal and fair playing field, the Heroes would lose, either by the fact that all of them would be dead, captured, or defeated, or because there would be nothing left of Japan even if they won.\n\n'We aren't ready or strong enough to match their numbers, and we will be so desperate as to invoke the help of children, most of them inexperienced for the war to come,' Endeavor looked to the U.A. students, looking at a certain few that were the exception to that fact, those being his son, Shoto, and his recent two interns, Midoriya and Bakugou. 'We must learn and evolve ourselves as much as possible, even if through these videos before it is too late.' Endeavor did not which to see his son or any of these young would-be Heroes among their war's fallen.\n\n\"Yet one infant Star Warrior escaped the carnage, destined to awaken a millennium later and save the galaxy,\" Wiz revealed, showing a star-shaped vessel sailing across space. \"His name is Kirby.\"\n\nThe sound of a record scratching was heard as the ship's occupant and infant Star Warrior was revealed. \"HIII!\" Kirby smiled and waved.\n\n\"SSSOOOO CCUUUUUUTTTEEE!\" The girls all squealed with hearts in their eyes. Not even Jiro seemed to mind the loud squeals as she was also cooing at the pink puffball, uncharacteristically.\n\n\"AH! The Cuteness! It's too much!\" Kaminari wailed, gripping at his heart while a comical expression of pain was on his face.\n\nKamakiri's eyes twitched, a befuddled and annoyed expression as he was once more questioning reality itself with what he was seeing.\n\n\"SOOOOO PIIIIIIIINNNNKKK!\" Mina squealed at the top of her lungs, one so loud it blasted Jiro out of her uncharacteristic daze and shattered the glass of Iida's and Jurota's glasses.\n\n\"Hey, my hair is pink, and you never went gaga over it,\" Mei pointed out.\n\n\"Your hair is awesome, sister, but look at him!\" Mina gestured toward the round ball of sunshine and rainbows. \"I just want to smush and play with his cheeks all day.\"\n\n\"Anyone else thinks they look a lot like Ochaco's cheeks?\" Asui pointed out.\n\nOchaco paled as Mina shifted her mischievous gaze at her. \"I-I-I think Tsu's just messing around. My cheeks aren't that fluffy and rosy,\" Uraraka waved her hands in surrender. \"Right, Deku?...Deku?\"\n\nOchaco had turned to her crush to bail her out of this predicament, but Izuku looked back and forth between her and Kirby with a blank stare. With every second, Ochaco's hopes began to waver. \"Eri?\" Ochaco then turned to her crush's surrogate daughter, who likewise made her worry with how she looked back and forth between Ochaco and Kirby. Suddenly, they lifted when Izuku and Eri finally looked at each other, nodded, and turned to her. Izuku opened his mouth to respond.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Ochaco. We can't tell such an obvious lie,\" Izuku, stone-cold, replied, while Eri smiled brightly.\n\nOchaco's hopes shattered as she stared at the two with complete and utter betrayal. \"YOU TRAITORS!\" Ochaco wailed before Mina finally descended upon her. Ochaco wailed with horror...\n\n...and whined and pouted as Mina pinched, squeezed, and stretched Ochaco's rosy cheeks while her hands were restrained by Nejire and Hagakure, who were all loving this.\n\n\"Wait, what?! The cute cuddly pink puffball who lives in Happyland?\" Boomstick questioned, incredulously as playful, childish music played. \"Are you sure you're reading the right backstory?\"\n\n\"SO ADORABLE!\" Pixie Bob and Midnight swooned, hearts for eyes and wagging their butts, and fake cat tail in Pixie Bob's case, for emphasis.\n\n\"I have no idea who or what that thing is, but I want one,\" Mount Lady declared.\n\n\"Urgh, just when I was starting to get interested in this fight,\" Miruko groaned, one of the only females who wasn't going gaga over the puffball.\n\n\"You can't seriously expect me to believe you don't find this Kirby adorable?\" Ryukyu asked her friend with a questioning look. \"Even I find this creature quite cute.\"\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, the little guy is adorable as Hell, that's the problem,\" Miruko clarified. \"I was promised bloodshed and destruction, not cute and cuddly. Miruko doesn't do cute and cuddly.\"\n\n\"I don't know, Miruko, you saw how Princess Peach was the same and look how much ass she kicked,\" Fat Gum pointed out. \"Or rather should I say how much head she kicked.\"\n\nMiruko rolled her eyes, but she did relent to that comment and sat herself down, waiting patiently for what made this Kirby some Destroyer of Worlds.\n\n\"Yes,\" Wiz confirmed, showing Kirby's crashed ship on a cliff while the planet's denizens, ranging from all manner of different creatures, including a penguin with a crown. \"He crash-landed on Popstar, the most confusingly shaped planet ever, and has been defending the kingdom of Dream Land ever since,\" Wiz emphasized this by showing Pop Star as a literal planet shaped like a star and Kirby facing against a furious-looking, octopus-like creature.\n\nThe geniuses of the group all paused, their minds coming to a screeching halt as they tried to make sense of how the planet Pop Star was shaped.\n\n'...I take it back, we're wasting precious time,' Endeavor growled, his eye twitching as more and more nonsense seemed to come.\n\n\"But look at him! He's just so adorable and cuddly,\" Boomstick himself cooed. \"He couldn't hurt a fly.\"\n\n\"The Fuck are we Watching?!\" Bakugou growled out, lost his patience.\n\nKirishima smiled relieved to see Bakugou back to his old self from the last video.\n\n\"Kirby is a ravenous cannibal who thrives on the blood of mass murder,\" Wiz gave the ultimate revelation, showing Kirby inhaling another creature and standing before a field of skulls and bones.\n\nAs if another record scratch could be heard in all their heads, the group paused and blinked repeatedly.\n\n\"...Come again?\" Mina asked, her face still frozen on her happy smile, but tilted with confusion.\n\n\"Did you do this?\" Kirby's friend, Tiff, asked as she and the rest of Kirby's friends inspected the graveyard of remains.\n\n\"Holy shit!\" Boomstick cursed.\n\n\"Satisfied?\" Ryukyu turned to her friend with a smirk.\n\nMiruko's widening grin was as much an answer as needed. \"Very,\" Miruko said regardless.\n\n\"...I'm listening,\" Bakugou leaned in his seat, begrudgingly interested.\n\n\"Of course, you would be, Bakubro,\" Kirishima sighed, still relieved yet always concerned about Bakugou's...interests. \"Sure, you would.\"\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAge: Unknown, 200 years pre-maturity\n\nHeight: 8 inches / 20 cm\n\nWeight: Likely under 10 oz / 283 g\n\nSpecies: Unknown\n\nInfant-like & cheerful demeanor\n\nA Star Warrior\n\nCitizen of Dream Land\n\n\"He may not look it, but Kirby is a powerhouse,\" Wiz began detailing Kirby's abilities. \"He possesses incredible strength, speed, durability, and an arsenal stranger than an average day in Florida.\"\n\n\"Well, he sure set the bar high then, didn't he?\" David whistled and shook his head, now completely unaware of what may come from this Kirby creature.\n\n\"Are things really that crazy in Florida?\" Kinoko asked the American girls.\n\nBoth Pony and Melissa deadpanned and stared at Kinoko like she said the most blatantly obvious thing in the world.\n\n\"N-Nevermind,\" Kinoko sweatdropped and decided to drop it.\n\n\"His trademark power is his inhale ability, which sucks almost everything in with a powerful vortex,\" Boomstick unveiled Kirby's infamous power. \"With it, he can clear out everything from a quick meal to an acre of forest in a matter of seconds.\"\n\n\"...Huh, imagine that,\" Sato muttered, paling at the sight of Kirby devouring an entire feast, including the dinnerware and sheet, in seconds. His paling only grew worse when imagining what Kirby would do if he made an entire feast for the class.\n\n\"D-Did he just eat those guys?\" Nejire pointed out, her ever-smiling face cracking at the sight of Kirby eating sentient people.\n\n\"Guess Wiz was right that the guy's a cannibal, huh, Tamaki?\" Mirio asked his friend.\n\n\"His appetite and ability to consume is...astounding,\" Amajiki gulped down his bile again. \"He makes Fat Gum look like an amateur. Right, Fat Gum?...Fat Gum?\"\n\n\"...\" Fat Gum was rendered entirely speechless; he even dropped the bucket of popcorn in his hands. Finally, he went down to the floor level, fell to his knees, and bowed before the pink puffball. \"Master. King of Feasts, teach me thine ways. Accept your lowly servant and bless thy with but a fraction of your all-consuming might.\"\n\n\"...I think we might need to speed this up before Fat here starts a cult,\" Snipe suggested, sweat dropping.\n\n\"Agreed,\" Cementoss nodded, also sweat dropping.\n\n\"Plus, Kirby's body is malleable, allowing him to stretch his mouth and inhale larger objects,\" Wiz continued, showcasing the Star Warrior's body stretching, whether it was being pulled in four ways or swallowing an object larger than himself.\n\n\"That thing he just ate was even bigger than himself!\" Kosei exclaimed. \"How wide can that mouth be?!\"\n\nYui silently conjured a thought bubble, imagining herself making larger and larger objects using her Quirk and the pink puffball inhaling every last one of them before herself. At the last part, she shook herself free of the thought and even shivered in fear.\n\n\"Though he does have trouble wrapping his mouth around extremely large and heavy things.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear lord, no,\" Ibara face palmed, as she already sensed where this was going.\n\n\"LIKE MY DIC-!\"\n\nIzuku and Mirio were quick to cover Eri's and Kouta's ears, while Sero did everyone a service and covered Mineta's mouth before he joined Boomstick, which he was almost a second too late. A promise of a jack to the ear kept Kaminari's mouth shut, and a forest of threatening vines shut the boys of Class 1-B, and Setsuna, up.\n\nARSENAL\n\nInhale\n\nCopy Ability\n\nWarp Star\n\nFlight\n\nAir Bullet\n\nSlide Kick\n\nCan summon Helper\n\n\"-KIRBY weighs practically nothing, allowing him to inflate his body and fly like a sentient balloon,\" Wiz continued, quickly interrupting Boomstick. \"He can likewise spit out the enemies he inhales to use them as projectiles and even inhale large gulps of air to fire them off like a bullet.\"\n\n\"Huh, he's almost floating, huh, Ochaco?\" Asui pointedly mentioned.\n\n\"Shush you!\" Ochaco pouted at Asui, still mad, though not really, at Asui, Izuku, and Eri for inflicting Mina so cruelly on her.\n\nIzuku perked up and wrote down Kirby's Air Bullet ability, wondering if he could use this info to help with his similar Air Force technique, while his Flight could be useful for Izuku's training with Float.\n\n\"He can traverse the skies and outer space, by using his own personal vehicle, the Warp Star,\" Wiz said; Kirby was seen flying and surfing on a floating star.\n\n\"Okay, so not only is the very planet a literal star, but he even has a star for a surfboard?\" Itsuka questioned, incredulously.\n\n\"It is only by the grace that Kirby is so adorable that I am not losing my mind right now,\" Momo muttered.\n\n\"I don't think our Class Prez has the same sentiment,\" Kyoka pointed out Iida muttering and sputtering for an explanation.\n\n\"Which he can call up at any time on speed dial. No really, he uses a cell phone,\" Boomstick jumped in, Kirby flashing his cell phone and dialing up his Warp Star. \"Somebody get me that number! I tried 1-800-PINK-RIDE, but it was something else...\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Pony tilted her head, confused. Up until Setsuna whispered what Boomstick meant into her ear, to which Pony grew a blend of red and green in response.\n\n\"It never ends with this idiot,\" Kyoka pinched the bridge between her eyes.\n\n\"Nope,\" Hagakure said, popping her lips.\n\n\"The Warp Star is Kirby's primary means of transportation through the universe, and can travel at speeds faster than light,\" Wiz explained. \"It is forged of Kirby's own energy, so, while delicate, should it be destroyed, Kirby can easily create a new one on his own, making the cell phone kind of pointless.\"\n\n\"Not true! The phone could just be keyed to any similar object with the same signature and-\"\n\n\"Mei, Mei, just let this one go,\" Melissa stopped Mei from continuing to try and find out science from magic.\n\n\"I'm more surprised you guys are so hung up about the cellphone part and not that Faster Than Light part,\" Setsuna pointed out.\n\nSetsuna pointing that out only made Iida's ego along with his psyche shatter all the more that a pink puffball on a star surfboard was faster than him. Even Bakugou's eye twitched at the thought that Kirby could outfly him too.\n\n\"I'd be happy to take that phone off his hands, though I'm a bit iffy on standing anywhere near that star-driving balloon marshmallow,\" Boomstick shuddered. \"Look at him! He doesn't even care! He's a monster!\"\n\n\"It is...concerning that he is essentially eating what look like sentient beings,\" All Might muttered nervously.\n\n\"And still while keeping that same damn smile,\" Vlad King shuddered as the smile became all the more sinister to him as he stared at Kirby's feats.\n\nAmajiki also shuddered. While his Quirk depended on him consuming animal parts to use, and eating animals is a primary source of protein and sustenance for humans and other animals, the dividing line was usually to call animals sapient rather than sentient like humans, and the fact that the animals most everyone eats are usually dead. For Kirby to consume not only living, but also seemingly sentient creatures was definitely concerning...and nauseating.\n\n\"It's about to get even worse. Guess what just happened to that poor creature?\" Wiz jumped in, showing Kirby eating a giant Waddle Dee. \"See, when Kirby swallows a victim, they don't exactly die. Turns out, Kirby's stomach is, in fact, an entirely separate and endless dimension of reality.\"\n\n\"...Say what?\" Mina did a double take.\n\n\"I guess when they that a person's stomach is a black hole, Kirby took that literally,\" Mirio chuckled to himself.\n\n\"I believe that might be a worse fate than simple death,\" Kuroiro muttered darkly. \"Imagine encountering an at first adorable creature, then swallowing you when your guard is down into their endless abyss of a stomach, and now you find yourself trapped in an endless expanse of space to which the only source of your freedom is the whims of an uncaring and cruel god of such a realm.\"\n\n\"...\" The group stared silently at Kuroiro as he finished seeding their future nightmares, something that Kouta's and Eri's ears didn't pick up, thankfully. While Reiko and Tokoyami simply muttered \"Revelry in the Dark,\", Kinoko stared at Kuroiro with wide and awed eyes as she caught a glimpse of the dark and imaginative thoughts of his mind. It made the mushroom girl blush.\n\n\"So, he never feels full. Talk about getting your money's worth at an all-you-can-eat-buffet, though,\" Boomstick joked.\n\n\"All Hail the Great Devourer! All Hail the Great Devourer!\" Fat Gum continued to prostrate himself before the Great Pink One.\n\n\"Sounds like your boss found a new role model,\" Shoji muttered to Kirishima. 'Or rather god.'\n\n\"No kidding,\" Kirishima chuckled nervously. \"Fat may be welcome in his town to all the food vendors for his patronage but he's pretty much banned from ever going to an all-you-can-eat buffet, until the end of the day...and when the employees don't want to clean up or leave any leftovers.\"\n\n\"Kirby can trap thousands of victims in this abyss,\" Wiz continued. \"Then, he can actually enter his own stomach dimension and draw from his captive's power using his copy ability.\"\n\n\"Copy, you say?\" Monoma perked up, interested at the similar name to his Quirk.\n\n\"How in the hell?! Does he, like, swallow himself?\" Boomstick asked, slightly disgusted.\n\nMineta perversely chuckled.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but what are you finding so hilarious, Perve Head?\" Kyoka raised a suspicious eyebrow at him.\n\n\"Nope, thinking absolutely nothing,\" Mineta played dumb. \"My mind is as void as Kirby's limits.\"\n\nKyoka narrowed her eyes suspiciously but said nothing else and turned back to the screen.\n\nMineta breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\"He likely projects an astral image of himself within the dimension, which can act on the physical plane,\" Wiz gave a scientific explanation to the madness that was Kirby.\n\n\"Uhhhh...\" Mina turned toward Midoriya for an easier explanation.\n\n\"What Wiz basically meant was that Kirby just 'looks within himself', like he has a world inside his mind, and draws power from within it like a Quirk,\" Izuku explained.\n\n\"Oh! Gotcha! Thanks, Midori,\" Mina cheerfully thanked Midoriya for the easy explanation.\n\n\"H-Hehe, anytime, Mina,\" Midoriya blushed at her smile and rubbed the back of his head. It was only so easy of an explanation for him because of how similar this alternate plane of existence felt to the Vestige World that he had wandered into a few times, usually via his dreams or when affected by Shinsou's Quirk.\n\nCOPY ABILITIES\n\nSword\n\nHammer\n\nFighter\n\nFire\n\nIce\n\nWheel\n\nUmbrella\n\nBomb\n\nCutter\n\nLeaf\n\nMagic\n\nNeedle\n\nMike\n\nHypernova\n\nStar Rod\n\n\"Sure...Anyway, with the Copy ability, Kirby's form and power change based on what he's eating,\" Boomstick moved on from Wiz's explanation to list Kirby's range of copy abilities. \"By devouring an enemy with a mallet, he can become Hammer Kirby, a master of whack-a-mole!\"\n\n\"So, what he eats, he becomes. Sounds an awful lot like your Quirk, eh, Suneater?\" Mirio poked at Amajiki's side with his elbow.\n\n\"I-I guess,\" Amajiki admitted. \"Though his copy ability currently ranges more on the attributes of the being he eats rather than the being itself, if any creature were to have a hammer, including one of us, then would he copy only the hammer or the Quirk?\"\n\n\"Owie, that sounds painful to think about,\" Nejire pouted.\n\n\"Any thoughts on how that relates to your own Quirk?\" Shinsou asked Monoma.\n\n\"It is more similar to my Quirk than it is to our esteemed upperclassman,\" Monoma replied. \"Whatever abilities that this Kirby can copy seem to be those specially attributed to them, such as a hammer or swordsman, much like how my Quirk copies that Quirk factor of those I touch rather than all their characteristics and features. When I copy Jurota, I may copy his Quirk, but I don't copy his fur.\"\n\n\"Fire Kirby can unleash a torrent of flame and survive all manner of heat,\" Wiz joined in. \"Ice Kirby can freeze his foes solid.\"\n\n\"Huh, so he has your Quirk too, Todoroki,\" Izuku pointed out.\n\n\"Only one at a time, though, much like Monoma, too,\" Todoroki showcased using both Ice and Fire from his respective sides. \"When he uses his Copy ability it's clear that he can only use one at a time rather than all at once.\"\n\n\"Wheel Kirby is fast enough to drive around the entire kingdom of Dream Land in under two seconds, though who knows how he can see where he's going,\" Wiz pointed out.\n\nIida didn't know what to feel, weirded out that Kirby could turn into a wheel or even more depressed that Kirby could achieve speeds faster than him in many different ways.\n\n\"There's Mike Kirby, whose singing talent is apparently so awful, everything that hears it dies,\" Boomstick revealed.\n\n\"Oh, come on, no one's singing is that bad,\" Jiro rolled her eyes, refusing to believe any one person's singing is that bad.\n\n\"Three, two, one...\" Itsuka counted off.\n\nMike Kirby began singing, his high-pitched voice so grating and painful, that it caused several monsters to explode.\n\n\"GGAAAAHHHH!\" Jiro fell off her seat when jumping in pain from the horrible voice that made cats scratching on a chalkboard seem like classical art.\n\n\"You were saying?\" Todoroki asked.\n\n\"Shut up,\" Jiro groaned from her place on the ground.\n\n\"Like Wiz at karaoke night with the ladies,\" Boomstick said.\n\n\"Yeah...Hey!\" Wiz exclaimed, offended.\n\n\"Ohoho, you want to talk horrible singing? Have you ever tried taking Bakugou out for group karaoke night?\" Mina laughed. \"Man, even his explosions sound better.\"\n\n\"SHUT UP! I'M GREAT AT SINGING! TAKE THAT BACK, YOU PINK EXTRA!\" Bakugou roared, completely red, though whether from anger or embarrassment, no one could say.\n\n\"Dude, I still got the recording right here-\" Sero said before diving away from Bakugou's dive at him, forcing their classmates to hold back the explosive teen from throttling Sero.\n\n\"And this is why we don't do group karaoke nights with him anymore,\" Kaminari gestured to the scene, finally enlightening Mineta on a question that has been hanging over his mind ever since the dreaded and only Bakusquad Karaoke night.\n\n\"Stone Kirby is nearly indestructible, Bomb Kirby is an explosive expert, and Sword Kirby is a master with a blade, he can even fire sword beams, which can cut through anything without mercy,\" Boomstick continued listing, showing Sword Kirby's energy slash that cut apart a bug creature's sword in two...as well as the bug creature. \"DAMN!\"\n\n\"Okay, t-that's impressive, I guess,\" Kamakiri muttered, begrudgingly.\n\n\"Huh, Stone Kirby is just like our Quirks,\" Kirishima pointed out.\n\n\"And he drops that heavy weight onto his enemies to paste. Manly!\" Tetsutetsu exclaimed.\n\nBakugou finally gave up his pursuit of Sero when hearing about Bomb Kirby.\n\n\"But that's not all, he can pour a ton of energy into the blade and make it grow into the powerful Ultra Sword,\" Boomstick revealed, Kirby was shown using the Ultra Sword to destroy several enemies at once. \"And if that's not enough, he can do this to many of his Copy Abilities, like the Ultra Hammer, Magic Kirby, or even turning himself into a giant snowball...okay?\"\n\n\"Huh, the world's most giant snowman,\" Kouta nodded with begrudging respect.\n\n\"Fighter Kirby is a master martial artist, and by inhaling a Miracle Fruit, he becomes Hyper Nova Kirby, capable of devouring worlds,\" Wiz jumped in.\n\n\"Now we're talking!\" Miruko pumped her fists together, grinning wide and interested enough to want to fight the pink marshmallow with that ability on. Oh, and the destroying whole worlds thing was cool too.\n\n\"Last, but not least, by absorbing his own Warp Star, Kirby can create his ultimate weapon: The Star Rod, a magical staff powered by dreams and capable of destroying evil,\" Wiz displayed such an ultimate weapon. \"And most of the moon.\"\n\n\"So, his ultimate weapon is a magic wand?\" Rin questioned. \"You know, why not? Why did I even bother assuming it was going to be anything but something goofy and childlike?\"\n\n\"The only problem with Kirby's copy ability is, they don't last. One bad hit, and there it goes,\" Boomstick showed Kirby using his Copy Ability after getting hit by a Scrafty.\n\n\"Huh, so despite having access to multiple different abilities, if he suffers even one solid hit then he can lose it,\" Izuku muttered as he wrote in his notebook. \"That means that in the Death Battle speed and agility would have to be his most important factors to win, so that he can continue using his abilities while evading enemy attacks and use the powers for as long as possible.\"\n\n\"Dammit,\" Miruko's shoulders slumped, realizing that even if she did fight Fighter Kirby it would only take one good kick, which was inevitable given how fast and powerful she is, and that ability would go bye-bye.\n\nSTRENGTHS & FEATS\n\nCracked Planet Popstar in half\n\nPunched a hole through the Earth\n\nThrow Popon to the sun\n\nObliterated Popstar in manga\n\nDestroyed Nova, who is planet-sized\n\nDefeated Nightmare, Marx, Dark Matter, Magolor, & more\n\nReflected a meteor using simple cannonballs\n\n\"But even without an added ability, Kirby is remarkably tough,\" Wiz pointed out. \"He's powerful enough to crack a planet in half, fast enough to run on water, and strong enough to throw a monster thirty times his size, on a frying pan, all the way to the sun, circle the burning star, and return to Kirby's feet, with the perfectly cooked monster.\"\n\n\"...Sorry, I stopped paying attention after cracking a planet in half, he did what?!\" Mount Lady exclaimed.\n\nAsui was forced to hold Iida back with her tongue to keep from smashing his head into his seat...after actual cracks started appearing on the wooden chair.\n\n\"I think that might be the most ridiculous feat we've ever seen on Death Battle,\" Boomstick chuckled.\n\n\"I kind of have to agree with him on that,\" Mandalay sighed.\n\n\"Still excusing these feats because of his cuteness?\" Itsuka challenged Momo.\n\n\"...Yes,\" Momo hesitated and held strong...because the alternative was smashing her head into the floor so hard, she would crack the cement...and her skull.\n\n\"But he's not just strong, he's so tough that he was barely fazed after being crushed under thousands of tons of pressure, and effortlessly survived an explosion massive enough to eclipse the entire world,\" Boomstick added.\n\n\"In translation, he survived getting blown up with a planet-sized explosion,\" Kirishima summarized. \"Huh, how about that, Bakubro? Think you can top that?\"\n\n\"ZIP IT, SHITTY HAIR!\" Bakugou barked.\n\n\"He's achieved all of this, despite being only eight inches tall,\" Wiz revealed.\n\n\"HUH?! B-But how?!\" Melissa exclaimed, her glasses getting crooked from her shock. \"How is he only this tall?!\" Melissa showed the gap between her hands to be only wide enough for a small doll.\n\n\"Maybe size works differently in their world?\" Izuku gave the best explanation he could give.\n\n\"See? It's not the size of the monster; it's how he throws a FUCKING HUMUNGOUS FRYING PAN INTO THE SUN AND BACK!\" Boomstick exclaimed.\n\n\"Well, Kirby does have one crucial flaw: he's a baby and has yet to fully mature as a Star Warrior,\" Wiz pointed out.\n\n\"Wait, he's still a baby?\" Ojiro blinked, surprised. \"But that listing said he was 200 years old!\"\n\n\"Age often works differently with other species,\" Tokoyami noted. \"A fly's lifespan can last all of one day while a whale or jellyfish can last for hundreds of years.\"\n\n\"Yeah, he's not too bright, so he's not gonna be whipping up any genius strategies mid-fight,\" Boomstick agreed. \"Fortunately, he's powerful enough to get away with it. Kirby is the most adorably terrifying thing in the world.\"\n\nKirby does his traditional ending dance while the Kirby Dance music from Kirby's Return to Dreamland plays.\n\n\"...Bravo. S-Simple magnificent!\" Mina shed a tear at the sight of Kirby's dancing.\n\nEri squealed again at Kirby's smiling and dancing. \"Oh! Papa, he's so cute!\" Eri squealed. \"I wish I could hold him for a hug or have a plushie of him!\"\n\nIzuku sweat dropped at the idea of Kirby despite his height being anywhere near his surrogate daughter, but a plushie of the guy would hurt-\n\nAs he finished that thought, the device paused the video with a message. \"Package Delivered! Receive?\"\n\nThe group paused at the message and no doubt who was the sender. After several looks at each other, Mei would ultimately be given the green light to accept the package. Instantly, a lens opened up in the device and shone a light. From the end of it, a package was formed out of Hard Light technology, as David Shield pointed out, and formed a small black box that landed softly by Izuku's feet by Eri.\n\nNoticing the note on the package, Izuku picked it up and opened it. \"The most adorably powerful little thing in the world needed a friend like her,\" Izuku read the note. Looking at Eri's expectant eyes, Izuku sighed and opened the box for her. When Eri saw what was inside, sparkles could practically be seen on her. The horned girl let out a squeal so loud, that dogs miles away flinched at the sound.\n\n\"Thank you, gut,\" Jiro thanked her instincts as she removed the earmuffs. \"What did you get, Eri?\"\n\nEri grabbed the object from inside the box gently and raised it for everyone to see with wide eyes. It was a Kirby Plushie!\n\n\"Oh MY God! SO CUTE!\" Hagakure squealed.\n\n\"I'M SO JEALOUS!\" Mina also squealed.\n\n\"Yep, definitely starting to get the hang of this,\" Jiro muttered, removing the earmuffs again.\n\n\"I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!\" Eri bounced up and down so much, that Miruko mistook the platinum-haired child for a distant cousin of hers. Regardless, seeing Eri adorably suffocate the plushie in a hug warmed even her hard heart.\n\n\"That's so wonderful, Eri,\" Melissa petted the girl's hair as she investigated the plushie. \"Huh, and it's even 8 inches. Just like Kirby.\"\n\n\"Huh, there's a button on its hand,\" Mei's eyes zoomed at the small soft button on Kirby's right hand.\n\nEri perked up at the mention and pressed the button. \"HIII!\" The Kirby Plushie spoke.\n\nEri squealed again and hugged the plushie again, and the students wondered if the plushie were alive it would be grasping for breath.\n\n\"Can I keep it?! Can I keep it, Papa?! Please?!\" Eri looked to her surrogate father and pleaded with the biggest puppy dog eyes she ever mustered.\n\n\"Of course, you can, Eri,\" Izuku cupped her cheek and smiled. \"The note said for the most adorable little thing in the world. Who else could top you?\"\n\nEri's eyes watered at those words before wrapping herself onto Izuku's chest with a bone-breaking hug. As her muffled 'Thank You's' repeated in his chest, Izuku wondered if perhaps technically adopting her meant she somehow inherited his mother's bone-crushing hugs because this is what it felt like.\n\n\"While this gift is generous, are we sure that Eri should be given this doll?\" Iida asked, a concerned, skeptical look on his face. \"Are you not worried that it might possess any sort of equipment set to record us?\"\n\nAsui deadpanned at Iida at the ridiculous statement. \"Hey, Eri, is that all that Kirby can say?\" Asui turned to Eri and asked, pointedly ignoring Iida's aghast look.\n\nEri pressed the button again, and instead of the same line, it began to play the music that was on when Kirby was dancing. Eri immediately broke into an impromptu dance with the plushie, spinning it around with her, moving its little arms and feet while her feet danced. At the song's end, Eri posed with the plushie with happy smiles on both their faces.\n\n'SOOOOOO CCCCUUUUUUTTTTEEEE!' 90% of the group internally proclaimed.\n\n\"Oh, The Two of You Are So Adorable! Yes, You Are! Mama Mina Will Always be Here to Protect You and Your Innocence! Yes, I Will!\" Mina completely lost it and wrapped Eri and the doll in a hug, rubbing her pink cheek on Eri's pale one.\n\n'M-Mama!' Eri gasped as tears welled up in her eyes again. Drawing on all the strength she had to not bawl, Eri hugged Mina back, happily smiling as she rubbed her cheek back at Mina's.\n\nIzuku stared at the two with wet eyes and a soft smile. Any fears and doubts he had in his mind about Kirby, in whatever shape or form he was in, or being sent as a package from Zayden, went away as he stared at his surrogate daughter with one of the women he loved. They looked like a real mother and daughter.\n\nBut then a new concern popped into his head to spoil the moment. Izuku frowned as he looked over at Setsuna, who was also smiling at the sight of Eri and Mina hugging. He remembered her words from before and then he looked over to the rest of the girls...this Sisterhood and the reason for their forming. As much as his cheeks blushed crimson for the reason, as well as the burning cheer of joy and victory that welled in his heart, he also remembered what Setsuna said about last night, about what the girls already know...and what she asked of him to consider.\n\nNezu smiled at the sight of the two girls, nodding in praise at Miss Ashido's love for the girl, love that such a damaged and tortured girl needed after years of pain and torment. In a way, he shared a kinship too with Young Eri Midoriya, as Nezu has decided to call her. The two of them were victims of tortuous experimentation and both have escaped from their dark past into a better place. Nezu felt envious that Eri was freed and showed this much care and comfort compared to how long it took for Nezu to be free and the solitude he had to use as a shield.\n\n'Another package from Zayden, and it appears that most of these are either tools to help pave a better future for our young Heroes or babbles and trinkets to entertain the girl,' Nezu noticed the pattern and difference between the helpful tools, like the Lightsabers and Vibranium blueprints, and the trinkets for Eri, such as the Bucky O'Hare CD and this latest plushie.\n\n'Curious. Though, Zayden is right in his statement. Eri is similar to Kirby. Adorable little things that they are, both possess a power that would be the end of many if put into the wrong hands.' Nezu thought grimly about the Quirk erasing bullets that Overhaul had made and hoped that they were all truly destroyed with the Yakuza leader's work.\n\nAfter finally calming both Eri and Mina down to get back to their seats, they moved the video on to the next fighter and their analysis.\n\nThe second fighter, despite possessing a similar innocent-looking form, had a more ominous and sinister aura to it. And this non-threatening form was not the only one this fighter seemed to possess. The first form that the fighter took was that of a large and wide alien-looking individual. They possessed pink skin that was remarkably similar to Ashido's and held a tentacle-like antenna on the top of its head. Its eyes were seemingly always closed, weird holes were on its sides like its ears, and its face was plump and round, making its chubby smile look friendly. The rest of his figure was wide and fat, with a large round stomach and arms, its pecs and shoulders were covered by a short, black, and yellow-lined jacket, with a purple cape tied around its neck. Its hands were covered in yellow boxing-like gloves, a black belt was tied around its waist with its center headpiece yellow with a black, stylish M, and its bottom half was clothed in puffy white harem pants, black leggings or socks, and yellow boots.\n\nIts second form was far more sinister looking, mainly due to its now open and rage-filled eyes. Similar again to Mina, the sclera of its eyes was black instead of white, though, unlike the U.A. student, this creature's eyes were a bloody red that perfectly matched the rage they carried. Other differences this form had were a constant frown instead of a smile and its skinnier and more fit physique. In this form, it lost its large gut, large, and head, and replaced it with a slimmer, muscled, and sturdy physique. Its hands were also bare and pink like the rest of the creature, with black fingernails, and black and yellow bracers on its wrist.\n\nIt was clear right away to the group that while the first form appeared innocent and friendly like Kirby, this analysis would be much more consistently darker and more serious.\n\nMajin Buu\n\n\"True terror is something unpredictable, unstoppable, and dreadfully deceiving,\" Wiz began.\n\nAll Might frowned as this statement turned his thoughts to what made All For One the terrifying Symbol of Evil that he was. While All For One's goal of taking over Japan, possibly even the entire world, was obvious enough, the plans and methods that the Symbol of Evil took were still unpredictable and terrifyingly accurate as to suggest that everything that has currently happened thus far in the present, such as his eventual discovery and imprisonment, were all planned. It was of no debate the older brother of the First user of One For All was also a nearly unstoppable monster in human form. Not even at his prime was All Might able to kill the bastard and it took all the embers he had left to defeat him in a weakened state, a weakened state that rendered several heroes unconscious and mortally wounded the Number 3rd Hero.\n\nAnd finally, he was dreadfully deceiving, which Toshinori also found true. His survival was one thing, but it was frosting on the cake compared to the schemes and bargains he planned and executed with those in his employ, how he had Shigaraki be the figurehead of the League while he remained in the shadows, and the very act of how he got his Master's grandson to be his pawn also reeked of something suspicious, perhaps even staged.\n\nWhile All Might thought of his nemesis, Izuku thought of the many Villains he had thus far faced. Gentle Criminal was arguably his hardest moral challenge, and Nine his most destructive, the latter being so nearly unstoppable with his power and Quirks that he had to give One For All to Bakugou, temporarily, to try and defeat him. Muscular was also a very unpredictable and unstoppable threat, his bloodlust making him act erratic and murderous and tanking even 100% of One For All. Stain's speed, skill, and bloodlust were likewise a terrifying force to face and survive and he sure made himself appear unpredictable when he saved him from the winged Nomu. Overhaul was so strong and unpredictable that Nighteye originally foretold that he would die fighting against the Hassaikai leader, and it was likely thanks to Eri that outcome never happened.\n\nHowever, the one foe that stood out to him above them all was Shigaraki. His emotional immaturity and rage can make him unpredictable, and his dangerous Decay Quirk made fighting him in close combat incredibly risky, but the intelligence, resourcefulness, and perseverance he also displayed was something that was incredibly deceiving, a far cry from how he first revealed himself in the USJ. That last note, above all else, the fact that he can grow and change so much in so little time, was utterly terrifying for Izuku, and who knows just how changed he will be when next they clash.\n\n\"A perfect description for the pink monstrosity known as Majin Buu,\" Boomstick jumped in, a short montage of Majin Buu changing forms and his display of powers leaving unease in the group. \"Majin Buu is a fat, pink, man-sized baby thing with enough power to destroy a planet.\"\n\n\"Oh, great, another planet-buster. Just what we need,\" Awase groaned.\n\n\"With the number of planet-busters that come from that universe, I definitely don't want to go vacating there,\" Sen muttered, recalling the planet-destroying feats of Goku, Vegeta, and Frieza.\n\nVlad King frowned, finding that his students had a point. A lot of seemingly powerful beings seem to call this particular universe home and display enough power to reduce said home to utter rubble. 'I hope to whatever higher being there is out there that these beings stay in that world,' Vlad King prayed, knowing that if they ever decide to find their way to their world, none of them would have the power to stand up against even one of them.\n\n\"And I assume he's made of some sort of bubble gum,\" Boomstick added. \"Probably Big League Chew.\"\n\n\"Huh, would you look at that? Find something there inspiring, Mineta?\" Tokage raised an eyebrow at the infamous Class 1-A perv as she saw the sight of Majin Buu attempting to smooch a terrified woman.\n\n\"Hey! I may like the ladies...okay, REALLY like the ladies, but I'm no rapist,\" Mineta declared. \"I know when no means no.\"\n\n\"Really?! You of all people?!\" Jiro exclaimed with aghast at the gall in Mineta's words, her mind already highlighting his most deprave and desperate acts of perverse behavior, including him trying to peek in on the girl's locker room through a hole in the wall and attempting to climb over the barrier between the girls and boys Onsen in the Pussycat's Training Camp.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAge: Immemorial\n\nHeight (Fat): Approximately 6 ft / 183 cm\n\nHeight (Kid): Approximately 5 ft / 152 cm\n\nRace: Majin\n\nAliases: Mr. Buu, Boo of Pure Evil, Majin of Destruction\n\nOriginally thought to be created by Bibidi\n\nFriends with Super Janemba\n\n\"Buu has existed since the dawn of time but was only discovered five million years ago by the nefarious wizard, Bibidi,\" Wiz revealed. \"Bibidi released Majin Buu on a helpless universe, intent on destroying everything.\" Scenes of Buu slaughtering countless civilians and races, along with destroying entire planets played out. \"After annihilating hundreds of planets, Bibidi set his sights on Earth, sending Buu ahead in a sealed capsule just waiting to be released.\"\n\n\"Dear Lord,\" Ibara gasped, hands over her mouth as she stared in horror at the slaughter brought about by this monster.\n\nMina frowned deeply, knuckles cracking under the grip of her fist. Mina always loved aliens or the concept of them at least. She was often teased by her looks as being that of an alien but rather than become insecure about it, she grew to embrace her unique appearance and the moniker of being an alien. Soon after she grew to love alien sci-fi stories, movies, and TV shows, especially Alien, that timeless classic that even survived the cultural purge during the Dawning of Quirks. It was the reason why she wanted her Hero name to originally be Alien Queen, despite Midnight's rejection. The concept of life existing outside the boundaries of their system, a whole new set of people to befriend and help, was awe-catching for the Young Ashido and it is still a dream of hers to meet an actual alien.\n\nBut this Majin Buu was the last thing she imagined wanting to meet. In fact, Mina hated that Buu, this destroyer of countless alien worlds, cultures, and people was pink; it was giving their color a bad rap. Mina wasn't stupid to imagine that those alien races she wished to meet would be 100% good, she knew there would be bad apples in the mix, and as she wanted to be a Hero, she wanted to beat those alien Villains, save those alien lives, and be an Alien Hero for both Earth and beyond.\n\nBut Majin Buu, with his power and savagery, gave Mina uncomfortably similar vibes to Gigantomachia, that giant Villain that she could now put a name onto. They both appeared like monstrous creatures that seemed to have no way of defeating them, and it angered her just as much as it frightened her.\n\n\"Buuuuut then Bibidi got himself killed before he could get to Earth and release the pink terror,\" Boomstick jumped in.\n\n\"Phew,\" Kirishima wiped his brow, relieved. \"I mean, good thing that someone put down that psychopath before he could get to-\"\n\n\"But no worries, the weird lizard-wizard-thing had a backup plan in the form of a magic clone named Babidi,\" Boomstick pointed out. \"Yes, clone, not son, that was a mistranslation.\"\n\n\"Oh...never mind,\" Kirishima muttered.\n\n\"Magic,\" Izuku muttered as he flipped back to his notes revolving Ki and Magic in the Dragon Ball universe. \"Oh, here it is.\"\n\n\"Found something, Midoriya?\" Mirio asked.\n\n\"Yeah, back in the Death Battle between Goku and Superman, when they mentioned the difference between Magic and Ki as two separate types of power, they mentioned Babidi as one of those magic users,\" Izuku mentioned. \"While it seems that Buu is using mostly Ki-based attacks from those clips, I wonder if he could also use magic.\"\n\n\"Last time, Goku's only use of magic was with Power Pole that he could magically extend and hurt Superman with,\" Todoroki pointed out. \"If this Majin Buu can possess both magic and Ki, he could pose a sizeable threat.\"\n\n\"You know as opposed to the already sizeable threat that he was when he was just destroying planets and wiping out whole civilizations,\" Kaminari sarcastically spoke.\n\n\"Touché,\" Todoroki shrugged.\n\n\"So, Bibidi, Babidi and Buu. Put 'em together and what do you get?\" Boomstick sang as he lined up the two wizards and Buu together.\n\n\"A Disney lawsuit,\" Wiz answered.\n\n\"HAHAHAHA!\" Mirio laughed. \"Oh, I get it! From that Fairy Godmother from Cinderella.\"\n\n\"Cinderella?\" Eri tilted her head confused. \"Who's that?\"\n\n\"Oh, you would love her, Eri,\" Ochaco cooed as she knelt before the little girl with a smile. \"She's from these very old classic Disney movies. She's a princess with glass slippers, mice that can turn into horses with a carriage like that of an onion. She's one of a dozen Disney Princesses.\"\n\n\"Princess,\" Eri gasped, a look of childlike wonder and joy sparking in her eyes.\n\n\"I often forget that poor Eri didn't have much of a childhood under Hassaikai. How tragic,\" Momo frowned, a hand over her aching heart.\n\n\"But hey, with us and the Green Bean, we can make up for lost time with her, right?\" Jiro pointed out.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Momo nodded, a sparkle gained in her eyes as she fantasized about perhaps hosting a tea party with Eri and all the girls as various Disney Princesses.\"\n\nReiko pouted, muttering about how the Old Grims Tale version was a lot better and more intense like the Wicked Stepsisters cutting off their toes to try and fit the glass shoe on their feet.\n\n\"Anyway, the doppelganger Babidi set out on a quest to recover Buu and complete Bibidi's plan,\" Boomstick continued.\n\n\"Eventually, Babidi found Buu and opened the monster's shell,\" Wiz said as Babidi and Dabura found and opened Buu's pod, bubblegum-like gas coalescing into a shape. \"But turns out there was a... slight defect and Buu was... um...\"\n\n\"A complete idiot!\" Boomstick revealed bluntly.\n\n\"OHOHOHOHOHOOO!\" Majin Buu cried out moronically as the screen spun around with the spinning idiot of a mass murderer.\n\nEndeavor and Bakugou both made a similar face that bordered between disgust, annoyance, disbelief, and rage.\n\n\"Huh, quite the defect,\" Pixie Bob chuckled.\n\n\"What defect? I don't see anything wrong here,\" Fat Gum shrugged as he ate more popcorn.\n\n\"Is this the... The great Majin Buu?\" Dabura questioned Babidi as Majin Buu strolled around humming before stretching his body. \"Are you positive?\" The Demon King gazed at the supposed great Majin Buu with disbelief.\n\nKaminari looked over to Bakugou and burst out laughing. \"BAHAHAHAHA! OH MY GOD! BAKUGOU'S MAKING THE SAME FACE!\" Kaminari laughed.\n\n\"AHAHAHAHA! NUMBER 1 IS TOO! BAHAHAHAHA!\" Hawks joined in the laughter after realizing the same exact look on Endeavor's face.\n\nSoon the rest of the group began to laugh at the misery and mocking of the two rage-filled individuals. Endeavor harnessed all his self-restraint, manners, and years of practice to hold back his rage from making him lash out and roast the Number 2 Hero into fried chicken.\n\nBakugou did not have the same level of restraint.\n\n\"YOU'RE DEAD, SPARKPLUG! WHEN I'M DONE WITH YOU THE ONLY USE YOU WILL BE TO ANYONE IS A DISCOUNT OUTLET TO CHARGE OUR PHONES!\" Bakugou roared as he chased Kaminari all across the gym.\n\n\"DON'T I ALREADY DO THAT?!\" Kaminari exclaimed as he ran for his life.\n\n\"All Might, Monoma,\" Nezu sighed, regretting that Aizawa was away with Mic for personal reasons.\n\nIt took a while before they could tie Bakugou back to his seat even with his Quirk canceled by Monoma and All Might reeling him in.\n\n\"Buu is the equivalent of a man-sized toddler with the power of a billion nuclear warheads,\" Wiz summarized, showing Buu making a silly face.\n\nDavid Shield spit out his drink, coughing. He tried to compose himself as he nearly laughed about how painfully accurate that title applied to a certain spray-tanned billionaire before the Dawning of Quirks.\n\nBuu displayed his power by launching Dabura skidding across the land and crashing into a cliff, destroying the formation, in a single kick.\n\n\"Talk about your terrible twos,\" Boomstick chuckled.\n\n\"I'll say,\" Tetsutetsu felt a bead of sweat drop from Buu's simple, yet effective display of strength. \"Dude had that other guy skipping across the ground like a rock in a pond.\"\n\nARSENAL\n\nChocolate Beam\n\nFlight\n\nGack\n\nBody Manipulation\n\nRegeneration\n\nAbsorption\n\nBuu Rocket\n\nSuper Breath\n\nMending Beam\n\nInnocence Express\n\nVanishing Beam\n\nFinger Beam\n\nVice Shout\n\nPlanet Burst\n\n\"Buu has a ridiculous arsenal for killing worlds,\" Boomstick began listing Buu's arsenal. \"He can fly, shoot lasers, destroy cities by breathing too hard, and can fire a beam from his head penis that can turn people into candy.\"\n\nThe Heroes and students paled at the sight of Majin Buu's breath attack that completely decimated an entire city from afar.\n\n\"Yeah, if any of that universe's fighters come here, especially the bad ones, we're all screwed,\" Ragdoll determined.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'm gonna need him to back it up a bit with what he said,\" Setsuna said, her hands gesturing to rewind the video. \"Fire beams from his what now?\"\n\n\"Boomstick, it's not his genitals, it's his... well... actually, I don't know what it is,\" Wiz admitted.\n\n\"Tabling that for later-\" \"No, we're not!\" \"-I'm more focused on the ability to turn people into candy,\" Sato spoke, even whilst Momo disagreed with talking any further about the 'head penis'.\n\n\"You think that if you eat that candy, it will still count as sugar?\" Sero proposed a question.\n\n\"Wouldn't that be cannibalism?\" Jurota questioned.\n\nAt first, Fat Gum was contemplating how amazing that ability would be for him, especially his Quirk. If it can work on inanimate objects, then he could make even a lump of torn metal into a chocolate bar as fuel for his Quirk. However, when the thought process eventually turned over to turning people into food and then eating them, Fat Gum paled and, for once in his life, lost his appetite.\n\n\"Can't we just simplify this discussion with 'don't get hit with the purple, transforming beam'?\" Shinsou brought up.\n\n\"Which brings me to his strangest ability, his whole body in general,\" Wiz continued. \"Whatever he's made of, it's magic in nature. Buu's whole body can be pulled, stretched, or even ripped apart with no negative effects.\"\n\n\"He can even pull entire slabs from his belly and use his own flesh as a weapon,\" Boomstick groaned. \"Argh, this is just getting stranger and stranger.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess we solved whether or not he can use magic,\" Ojiro sweatdropped.\n\n\"So, for Buu, we have flight, regeneration, a transfiguration-type beam of energy, standard and powerful Ki attacks, and a unique type of body transformation and reconfiguration,\" Izuku began muttering and writing like crazy. \"That kind of ability is like an unholy blend of Tiger's, Edgeshot's, and Setsuna's Quirks with the elasticity of Tiger, the regeneration and loss of limbs without consequence from Suna, and the body-morphing and utilization of Edgeshot to constrict his foes. The concept of using one's body proportions to their advantage is also something similar to Fat Gum and how his Fat Absorption Quirk works, too.\"\n\nSaid individuals thought about what Izuku muttered and found he wasn't wrong. Tiger could see the comparison between his Pilabody to Buu's magical flesh, even if it was both disgusting and disheartening that such power would be used for destruction. Edgeshot felt similarly to that sentiment, though pondered if his Thousand Sheet Pierce technique would even work on Majin Buu, given it seems like this creature would not have viable organs for him to pierce and render unconscious and any damage he would do might simply be regenerated instantly.\n\nSetsuna likewise was freaked out about the comparison, but then, in a Midoriya-like fashion, she pondered if perhaps there was a way she could use this technique for herself and for good. Usually with her Quirk, for offense she mainly launches her body parts like telekinetically tossed rocks onto her enemies that can hit multiple times. The main way she used her Quirk to restrict people was her hands, arms, and legs, but what if she could do more?\n\n'It's not like I can combine my body parts into a new shape, they can only conjoin back to how they once were with the corresponding parts, but maybe I don't need them to connect,' Setsuna began putting her mind into action, feeling the gears turn in her head. 'What if I was looking at it all wrong? What if instead of conjoining them by connecting them, I can conjoin them into different shapes by simply the shape and not the full width behind it?' An image came to her of multiple body parts coalescing to form the shape of a T-Rex head or a serpent with her parts simply hovering next to each other or stacked on top or over the other. It sounded so ridiculously simple and yet her mind began exploding like that one meme that it made her grin spread wide and maniacal.\n\nIzuku noticed this change in Setsuna and found himself stuck looking at her. Seeing the way her eyes danced around, looking nowhere in particular but gazing like she was solving an equation in her head, the way her subtle facial expressions, from the shifting of her brows, the squirming of her lips, even the wrinkling of her nose, all of which painted an image of how her brain was working, it all was a fascinating sight. A fascinating, cute, and wonderful sight.\n\n\"Yes, and he apparently does feel pain, though it seems to please him. Like some sort of combat masochist,\" Wiz stated. \"Fortunately, his body can regenerate almost instantly.\"\n\n\"He can be blasted to smithereens and reform himself in seconds,\" Boomstick added. \"He's practically invincible.\"\n\n\"Not only does he possess immense power but also holds a regenerative factor as impressive as Deadpool,\" Tiger noted.\n\n\"Shh! Don't speak that degenerate's name! He might hear you,\" Mount Lady whispered panicked.\n\n\"Oh, you can't possibly believe that he might still be aware of our conversation and come pop in?\" Mandalay raised an eyebrow at the paranoid heroine.\n\nThe size-changing heroine gazed seriously at Mandalay's eyes showing the telepathic heroine she was dead serious. As Mandalay reevaluated her thought process by reminding herself of Deadpool's feats and his actions in the last video...and paled as she begged and prayed that no spandex-wearing mercenary would pop in.\n\n\"Buu can mimic any Ki attack after seeing it in action only once,\" Wiz explained. \"This is how he learned Goku's Kamehameha wave, and Supreme Kai's Instantaneous Movement teleport.\"\n\n\"So, he can also use the Kamehameha and Instant Transmission?!\" Nejire exclaimed, surprised at the development, especially the former of Goku's abilities; this made Nejire's desire to learn the attack greater after seeing the attack can be learned or mimicked by other people.\n\n\"I'd imagine this is one of the reasons why he was paired against Kirby,\" Cementoss pointed out. \"Both are pink, seemingly harmless creatures that can copy the abilities of others and possess world-ending power.\"\n\n\"His ability to copy the abilities of others is also more powerful than my own Quirk,\" Monoma mentioned. \"My Copy Quirk only functions after making contact with a person or something that possesses their DNA, like Eraser's hair. This Majin Buu can instead copy techniques by simply looking at them from afar.\"\n\nAll Might shuddered as his thoughts turned to All For One. The King of the Villain Underworld could also only take Quirks if he made physical contact with his victims. However, the thought of All For One being able to take Quirks from afar, without touching a person was a rather horrifying possibility that he hoped remained simply that, a possibility.\n\n\"In any case, if he has learned the ability to teleport like Goku, then it could present a problem to Kirby if he can evade Kirby's more powerful attacks or catch up with him,\" Momo analyzed.\n\n\"But his copying prowess goes even further,\" Wiz continued. \"He can physically absorb other people, transforming his mind and body.\"\n\n\"YES! COME TO ME!\" Buu declared as his pink flesh absorbed Gotenks and Piccolo, the pink flesh returning and covering Buu. After a brief transformation, Buu's form had changed to reflect that of his captured victims, from Piccolo's height and build to Gotenks's jacket.\n\n\"That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen,\" Boomstick muttered, disgusted.\n\n\"...I think I see another reason why he and Kirby were chosen to face each other,\" Thirteen muttered.\n\n\"That was even more disturbing shit than Kirby just eating people,\" Kamakiri muttered, gulping down the bile that threatened to come up his throat.\n\nIzuku shuddered in disgust and fright. It was one thing for Buu to mimic the techniques and abilities of those he sees, Izuku worried that if he ever faced Buu, the pink monstrosity would only fight like him or be able to mimic the Quirks of the Vestiges like Black Whip. However, the prospect of potentially being consumed by Buu offered a more horrifying possibility and consequence than simple mimicry. Izuku worried if he ever got consumed by Buu, then it would mean that the destroyer of worlds would be able to absorb and even steal One For All, a possibility that would be incredibly horrible to ever come to being that Izuku wished his morbidly analytical mind didn't conjure.\n\n\"Each version of Buu has a different personality based on whom he's absorbed,\" Wiz explained, showing Buu absorbing and transforming into a similar form to one of the Kais. \"Fat Buu is cheerful and childlike, due to absorbing the carefree Grand Supreme Kai.\"\n\n\"So, the reason why Buu was so innocent-looking and playful was because he ate that dude?\" Mineta asked.\n\n\"I guess so,\" Sato shrugged. \"But what was he like originally?\"\n\n\"I believe we are about to find out,\" Tokoyami morbidly predicted.\n\n\"But then there's his original, and most dangerous form, Kid Buu,\" Wiz revealed the 2nd most recognizable form of the pink destroyer of worlds.\n\n\"Kid Buu?\" Toru said, looking at the slimmer and angrier-looking pink alien. \"His eyes even look like yours Mina, with the same black sclera and all.\"\n\n\"I-I guess,\" Mina admitted, reluctantly though as the rage and hatred in those eyes was definitely not what she saw whenever she looked in the mirror.\n\n\"He's so tiny! He's like a little kid in MC Hammer pants!\" Boomstick cooed. \"This can't seriously be his deadliest form.\"\n\n\"Kid Buu is pure rage incarnate,\" Wiz said.\n\nKid Buu screamed out loud to the heavens, pounding his fists onto his chest in a war cry.\n\n\"The raging beast hidden behind the mask of joy and civility,\" Reiko muttered. \"A dangerous facsimile of Jekyll and Hide.\"\n\n\"Jekyll was the mask that the doctor took to appear as a friendly face to society while Hide was the evil, rage, and sinful nature he hid within himself,\" Tokoyami nodded at the apt comparison, something that made Reiko's pale cheeks to turn red.\n\n\"He can get so angry, he's capable of tearing holes in the fabric of reality just by screaming,\" Wiz noted.\n\nNezu frowned at that particular ability. Not only did it appear a dangerous power that could break the boundaries of time and space in a universe, but Nezu's mind pondered whether this ability could extend to breaking through the barriers of other universes. 'If such a feat can be attainted if sought after, then Buu could attain the ability to traverse through different universes, including our own,\" Nezu thought grimly, already planning on contingencies on how to eliminate the pink monstrosity if that ever were to come to be.\n\n\"Or if he's fed up with whatever planet, he's on, he'll just blow it to bits with his Planet Burst attack,\" Boomstick pointed out, showing Buu lifting his palm into the air and forming an orb of pink energy that crashed into the ground and obliterated the planet he was on.\n\n\"That attack looked like a dark parody of Goku's Spirit Bomb attack,\" Shoji pointed out, his eyes narrowing. \"But where Goku's were powered by goodness and harm the evil and sinful, this one is only about destruction.\"\n\n\"And even if Buu were on the planet he is destroying, he could simply reform,\" Itsuka frowned.\n\n\"In a universe chock full of planet busters, Majin Buu is one of the strongest,\" Wiz declared. \"He's destroyed entire galaxies by systematically obliterating each planet one by one over time.\"\n\n\"Like a genocidal game of dominoes,\" Shoda frowned, his fists cracking in anger at the horrible feats of Majin Buu.\n\nSTRENGTHS & FEATS\n\nUnprecedented amount of combat experience\n\nOne-shot Dabura\n\nRipped apart space & time\n\nEradicated the human race in seconds\n\nDestroyed hundreds of planets\n\nDefeated Gotenks, Vegeta, & Gohan\n\nSurvived a battle with Vegito\n\n\"He's defeated most of Dragonball Z's most powerful characters, including Vegeta, Gotenks, and Gohan,\" Boomstick listed Buu's defeated foes.\n\n\"He even beat Vegeta?!\" Kirishima exclaimed in fright and shock. \"As in 'rival to Goku' Vegeta?!\"\n\nBakugou growled in anger at seeing his counterpart disrespectfully pummeled by the Majin of Destruction. It was a blow to his pride that this pink, overweight buffoon had surrounded his counterpart with his flesh, but to actually beat his planet-destroying counterpart was humiliating.\n\n\"That is frighteningly disturbing, but my question is who are Gotenks and Gohan?\" Jiro questioned.\n\n\"They appear to be Saiyans who are strong enough to become Super Saiyans,\" Izuku muttered as he looked through his notes on Goku and Vegeta. \"From how they look and the names, I think they're Goku's kids.\"\n\n\"Ah, you mean your counterpart's kids with his wife, Uraraka's counterpart?\" Setsuna teasingly pointed out.\n\nIzuku and Ochaco burned crimson at the reminder that their counterparts were married and had kids together. Uraraka began floating off to the ceiling as her thoughts were clouded by images of herself in a wedding dress beside Izuku in a suit, or brown and green-haired kids with round eyes and freckles or perpetual rosy cheeks.\n\n\"He one-shot the king of the demon realm and easily bested the Supreme Kais,\" Wiz continued listing.\n\n\"Who are like the gods of other gods,\" Boomstick clarified. \"So, needless to say, Buu is pretty frickin' strong.\"\n\nThe 'gods above gods' comment brought a frown to Ibara's face, but she wasn't about to start ranting about blasphemy when she was scared of this pink demon.\n\n\"But he's also extremely cocky, caring little about strategy or personal safety,\" Wiz explained Buu's weaknesses. \"And while his regenerative ability seems to make him indestructible, Buu is one of the only Dragon Ball characters whose body has been visibly affected by ordinary bullets.\"\n\n\"So, like He-Who-Mustn't-Be-Named, Buu's regeneration and ability to come back from anything makes him arrogant enough to not take any fight seriously,\" Pixie Bob said, pointedly trying not to name a certain Merc with a Mouth.\n\nFat Gum frowned at the similarity that he found with Buu tanking bullets from the police, as that is how it often looks when his fat absorbed bullets from criminals.\n\n\"And while being able to destroy planets, his body's not tough enough to take the explosion, forcing him to regenerate from a mass of pink particles,\" Boomstick added.\n\n\"Looks like you were right, Pres,\" Tetsutetsu said. \"If he can be able to tank a planet-busting explosion and reform from that, Kirby is going to have a Hell of a time facing him.\"\n\n\"Despite having the mind of a child and the body of Playdoh, Majin Buu might just be the deadliest villain in Dragon Ball history,\" Wiz summarized the Majin of Destruction.\n\n\"Me get big MAAAAAAAAAAADDDDD!\" Majin Buu screamed, a massive explosion of energy surrounding him and eclipsing the planet in his fury.\n\nOverall, Majin Buu was definitely the more consistently ominous and terrifying foe of the two fighters, with the Majin's planet-destroying feats, disturbing absorption, and horrifying abilities and possibilities that emerged from the minds of the group. It was clearly evident that there would be no one asking for a plushie of the pink monster, even his Fat form.\n\n\"Alright, the combatants are set,\" Wiz announced. \"Let's end this debate once and for all.\"\n\n\"IT'S TIME FOR A DEATH BBBAAATTTTTLLLLLEEEE!\" Boomstick roared out.\n\nThe group began to vote among themselves as the device paused the video and began searching for counterparts to the two fighters. It would take a bit longer since some were forced to choose between one pink demon over another, as well as classic biases against cute and villainous behavior.\n\nUltimately, those who favored Kirby's chances of victory included Eri, who could never vote against the cute and cuddly being her plushie was based on, Izuku and Mirio, half of their reasoning being behind supporting Eri and the other half being Kirby's range of abilities through his Copy Abilities and frighteningly strong feats, and All Might, who chose the more, relatively, heroic fighter compared to the planet-destroying, body and power absorbing monster that reminded him of All For One. Tamaki and Nejire would join Mirio and Izuku in voting for the puffball, Nejire's reasons following more along the lines of supporting Kirby's adorableness, and Tamaki because he better related his Manifest Quirk with Kirby's Inhale and Copy Ability than Buu's.\n\nMina and Ochaco likewise voted for the pink puffball, though it was admittingly hard for the former. Even if Buu was a genocidal, psychopathic monster, it was still hard to vote against a literal pink alien, at least for Mina. Though Kirby's status of likewise being an alien to Pop Star, his dance moves, and adorableness, made it so that Kirby took the vote from her. Ochaco admittingly voted for Kirby on an adorableness factor too, but also was inspired by Kirby's floating powers and maneuverability. Jiro and Kamakiri would also reluctantly vote for the savior of Pop Star, the latter because Kirby was the only one of the two who wielded a sword and was capable of slicing apart enemies with ease, and the former because she had to give props to Kirby for being able to kill people with his singing alone.\n\nFat Gum was one of the first who voted for Kirby, his now-appointed Great Pink One and Master who he strived to mimic, and Kirishima followed in his Intern Hero's footsteps thanks to Stone Kirby and Kirby's amazing durability, with Tetsutetsu not far behind in voting for the same reasons. Lastly, Nezu would vote for the deceivingly monstrous, round, pink creature, all the while chuckling maniacally.\n\nAs for those who voted for Majin Buu's victory, among them included Bakugou, who while his counterpart was defeated by Buu that was also the reason he voted for the planet-destroyer, as if it validated that Majin Buu was so strong and would easily beat Kirby by comparison. Endeavor, Edgeshot, and Iida would all too vote for the Majin of Destruction finding his level of power capable of defeating Goku's rival to be an impressive enough feat on its own, and every ability and feat only compounded the reason for their vote more and more. Kouta also voted for Buu, finding him cooler and more badass than Kirby, who looked too childish to his liking.\n\nMajin Buu's astonishing regeneration and body morphing abilities persuaded a vote from Setsuna, the former likewise garnering a vote from Momo, as well as his version of copying and absorption. His absorption and copying power and his mimicry skills garnered a vote from Monoma and Ragdoll, with the two finding that Buu could mimic potentially Kirby's abilities on top of his own, Miruko voted for Buu because he appeared more capable of fighting traditionally compared to Kirby even with the Fighter form, and even eagerly pondered how it would be like for Buu to mimic her moves and force her to fight herself, and Sato would vote, persuaded by Buu being able to turn people and objects into candy, which would be detrimental to Kirby if he was hit by it even once.\n\nBuu's malleable body gained Tiger's vote, and his Jekyll and Hide comparison, as well as hidden raging darkness and rage added votes from Tokoyami and Reiko.\n\nAfter all the voting was done, the group realized that the device was still processing its search. It was unusual. The group had gotten used to the device finishing its counterpart search just as they finished their voting process like the device knew to display its results after they were done. Now, however, the device was still processing and continued to do that for another few minutes.\n\n\"Oh, come on! What is taking so long?\" Mount Lady groaned, impatiently.\n\n\"Must you act like a bratty child as well as an attention whore?\" Midnight snarked at her rival.\n\n\"Who are you calling an attention whore, you dollar-store dominatrix?!\" Mount Lady barked back to clash eyes with her older rival, though secretly enjoying that said rival was acting better than she had been recently. Their back-and-forth jabs and remarks had become something that Yuu Takeyama had found fun and special between her and Kayama, and they were the best way she figured to distract and cheer up Midnight from the funk that she had recently been in.\n\n\"Alright, enough from the two of you,\" Ryukyu stood between the two like a motherly figure, even if Midnight was her elder.\n\n\"Though, Lady has a point,\" Miruko pointed out, taking a bite of a carrot. \"The thing is taking noticeably longer than any other time. Isn't that odd?\"\n\n\"Now that you mention it, it is,\" David Shield muttered. \"The one time it took this long was back during the Batman vs Captain America fight.\"\n\n\"The one where it revealed Midoriya as another potential counterpart to the Batman,\" Endeavor noted. \"You believe that this implies that multiple counterparts are being registered by the device?\"\n\nBefore David Shield could respond, the device beeped as it finished its search, as if responding itself to Endeavor's question.\n\n\"MULTIVERSAL COUNTERPARTS DETECTED!\" The device voiced its completion, starting off with Kirby. \"KIRBY! MULTIVERSAL COUNTERPART 1: ERI! COUNTERPART PROBABILITY: 20%!\"\n\n\"YAY!\" Eri squealed as she hugged the plushie of her now-revealed counterpart. \"I'm Kirby! I'm Kirby! Isn't that amazing, Papa?!\"\n\n\"It sure is, Eri-chan,\" Izuku patted his surrogate daughter.\n\n\"Counterpart 1,\" Momo muttered. \"It does appear that there will be multiple counterparts to Kirby. Though, I am curious that it would start off with Eri's if her Counterpart Probability is so low.\"\n\n\"MULTIVERSAL COUNTERPART NUMBER 2: IZUKU MIDORIYA! COUNTERPART PROBABILITY: 20%!\"\n\n\"Of fucking course,\" Bakugou rolled his eyes, annoyed that his rival was constantly the counterpart of multiple individuals, especially powerful ones that appear to be like the main characters of their worlds. It brought a sting to Bakugou's pride, as if the universe itself was basically stating that Izuku was the main character of their world too, not him.\n\n\"Ooh, Midori! I knew that you were cute, but I never thought that cuteness would make you counterparts to that adorable, terrifying little thing,\" Mina leaned in, teasing the shocked teen while her fingers wiggled greedily at pinching and abusing Izuku's cheeks like Uraraka's.\n\n\"C-Cute?!\" Izuku yelped, blushing madly.\n\n\"MULTIVERSAL COUNTERPART NUMBER 3: OCHACO URARAKA! COUNTERPART PROBABILITY: 20%!\"\n\n\"I knew it,\" Asui croaked, nodding at the results.\n\nOchaco blushed crimson at Asui's words. \"It wasn't that obvious,\" Ochaco pouted.\n\n\"Ochaco, girl, you have the same rosy, round cheeks and can float around like him,\" Hagakure pointed out the similarities. \"Plus, whenever we go to the market, you hound the free samples like you were fasting.\"\n\nOchaco's blush only grew redder. \"YOU PROMISED YOU WOULDN'T MENTION THAT!\" Ochaco exclaimed. The students laughed and Ochaco buried her face in her hands to hide her shame and blush. \"And they were free,\" Ochaco muttered quietly.\n\nIzuku sighed fondly at Ochaco's personality, knowing that with her poor background, the concept of anything free or cheap would be a godsend. It was frankly adorable with how excited she could get. Izuku patted and rubbed his best friend's back to her further blushing and joy.\n\n\"I'm starting to see a trend,\" Itsuka pointed out. \"Eri, Midoriya, and Uraraka all have the same 20% probability.\"\n\n\"Huh, yeah, that is weird,\" Setsuna noticed and nodded. \"It's like they all have so many similar qualities that the universe itself couldn't decide which one is better suited to be Kirby.\"\n\n\"Given that all three have probabilities of 20%, I surmised that we might have two more Kirby counterparts with the same probability at this rate,\" Shoda calculated.\n\n\"MULTIVERSAL COUNTERPART NUMBER 4: MINA ASHIDO! COUNTERPART PROBABILITY: 20%!\"\n\n\"WOOHOO! YES! PINK IN ONE WORLD, PINK IN EVERY WORLD!\" Mina cheered, her chest raised in pride. Izuku had to slap Mineta's face away with Black Whip as the pervert was staring at Mina's pronounced large assets while scolding himself to not look as well.\n\n\"Honestly, it fits so well it would be weird if she wasn't a counterpart to Kirby,\" Kirishima shrugged. \"Not only are they pink, but they both seem to have a knack for making friends and being perpetually cheerful.\"\n\n\"Aww, Kiri! Give Momma some sugar!\" Mina cooed and ran to Kirishima to bring him into a hug with a comical kissy face\n\n\"Not until you stop referring to yourself as 'Momma',\" Kirishima blocked Mina's path by planting his hand over her face, stalling Mina's path as she waved her hands toward him.\n\nIzuku chuckled, softly smiling at the two's friendship with one another. If he were as insecure as he was in his younger years like in Aldera, he would probably feel uneasy and worried about how close those two were, probably jealous, but Izuku wasn't like that. He could tell the two cared about each other deeply, but more in a brother-sister kind of vibe. Izuku was unsure if this calculation of his was marred by reassuring himself that Mina did have feelings for him, especially after recent revelations, but Izuku chose to confide in it rather than worry like a jealous prick.\n\n\"Looks like your guess seems accurate, Shoda,\" Honenuki muttered.\n\n\"If there is to be one last counterpart to round out the probabilities, who do you suppose it will be?\" Jurota asked the other students.\n\n\"Why of course it will be me!\" Monoma proudly stood, hand over heart as he held a smug look of assurance. \"After all, with our similar copying abilities and potential for greatness, it should be obvious.\"\n\n\"The way you say that makes it sound like you're saying that Greenie, Uraraka, and Ashido also have potential greatness,\" Setsuna pointed out.\n\n\"SILENCE!\" Monoma barked, red in the face.\n\n\"MULTIVERSAL COUNTERPART NUMBER 5: TAMAKI AMAJIKI! COUNTERPART PROBABILITY: 20%!\"\n\n\"AHA! I knew it!\" Mirio thrust his fists into the air, victorious \"Copying is one thing, but eating and manifesting their attributes is just like our man, Suneater, here!\" Mirio wrapped an arm around the shocked 3rd year.\n\n\"Yeah, isn't that awesome, Tamaki?! You and Zuzu have such a strong and cute counterpart! I'm kind of jealous!\"\n\n\"T-T-Thanks,\" Tamaki stuttered, blushing at the praise from his friends, but smiled, nonetheless.\n\n\"TAMAKI!\" The yell was all the warning that the paling Suneater had before his mentor, Fat Gum, rushed in and wrapped him in a bone-crushing hug. \"I KNEW I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE WITH YOU AS MY INTERN AND PROTEGE! I AM SO PROUD OF YOU!\" Fat Gum was bawling rivers of tears as he suffocated his intern into his fat and broke his bones with his hug.\n\n\"You were saying, Discount Mega Man?\" Setsuna teased the shocked and fuming Monoma.\n\n\"Honestly, it's like you're asking the universe for this,\" Itsuka shook her head at her classmate who sat back down in an embarrassed and wounded huff.\n\n\"MAJIN BUU! FAT! MULTIVERSAL COUNTERPART: TAISHIRO TOYOMITSU AKA FAT GUM!\"\n\n\"HUH?!\" Kirishima exclaimed in shock and horror. \"How is that possible?! I know Fat is...well, large, but how can he be that monster's counterpart?!\"\n\n\"MAJIN BUU! KID! MULTIVERSAL COUNTERPART: TENKO SHIMURA AKA TOMURA SHIGARAKI!\"\n\nMany of the group froze at the sight of the infamous leader of the League of Villains. Ochaco paled as she remembered the Villain from when he had threatened Izuku with his hand on his neck in the mall, and Asui shivered in fright as touched the sides of her face, feeling the phantom touches of Shigaraki's hands on her face back at the USJ, where she would have been decayed to dust if Aizawa hadn't canceled the Villains Quirk.\n\nThe Sisterhood girls all also recalled the video from last night, showcasing Shigaraki and how he appeared to have some connection or fated rivalry with Izuku from how the video portrayed the two as similar to All Might and All For One. Momo still recalled when Shigaraki was shown in the video to have platinum white hair compared to his usual greyish-blue and how Izuku was shown fighting against this newly-transformed Shigaraki with Black Whip and floating in the air. It still didn't make sense, because Izuku had never displayed the ability to float like that or mentioned clashing against Shigaraki after unlocking Black Whip unless he was hiding such an encounter taking place during his internship with Endeavor.\n\n'Or unless the event hasn't happened yet,' Momo thought as the possibility she came up with back when she watched the video still seemed like the most evident and likely conclusion, especially when the video also showed other potentially future events like a depressed and battle-worn Izuku over a bleak city.\n\nBakugou growled in hatred as he stared at the bastard that orchestrated his kidnapping at the Training Camp, which led to the whole situation that would lead to All Might's retirement. Mineta paled and shivered in absolute terror at the horrible Villain that nearly killed him, Asui, and Midoriya in the USJ with his Nomu and Quirk. Hawks felt a bead of sweat drop down his angry face as he stared at the new leader of the Paranormal Liberation Front. Truthfully, he hadn't seen the bastard in some time as meetings that he had with the leadership of the PLF didn't include him, and any questions about where their leader was met with curt and brief excuses like 'having a doctor's appointment' or 'training to get better', whatever they meant.\n\nAll Might held a conflicted look at seeing the face of his mentor's/mother-figure's grandson, the boy who was taken and molded into a Villain by All For One somehow and turned to despise him and society as a whole. Gran Torino's words echoed in his mind that he should stop seeing him as Nana's grandson as it was clouding his judgment on how to handle him. For all that he was Shimura's grandson, he was also Shigaraki, leader of League of Villains, now more so after AFO's imprisonment, and a dangerous Villain who attacked U.A. and its students multiple times, kidnapped Bakugou, threatened to kill Midoriya, and killed numerous people, either by his hand or those the League or their Nomus. He needed to be brought to justice, his past meant nothing if Toshinori allowed him to end other's futures.\n\nIzuku paled at the sight of Shigaraki, his feelings of dread regarding him returning, along with the phantom touch of his fingers wrapped around his neck. His last words to him back in the mall repeated in his head, from his crazed declaration of blame and hatred toward All Might with that hideous, smiling face, and his threatening words that the next time they meet, he will kill him. Izuku was also told by All Might about Shigaraki's real identity as Tenko Shimura, the grandson of Nana Shimura, the 7th user of One For All. Izuku could even feel a well of despair and sadness from inside him that he knew wasn't his own, it was Nana herself, and Izuku felt so sorry for her that she could not find peace even after her death with this information. And yet, whenever Izuku remembers Shigaraki's eyes, he can't see the strong and kind eyes of Shimura, only eyes of rage incarnate.\n\n'Rage incarnate. Like Kid Buu,' Izuku's mind caught that distinction, a lightbulb forming in his mind. \"That's it!\"\n\n\"What's it?\" Tetsutetsu questioned.\n\n\"I think I know why it said why Fat Gum was Fat Buu's counterpart or why Buu has two counterparts at all,\" Izuku said. \"It's because the device isn't really comparing Fat Gum to Fat Buu at all.\"\n\n\"I'm confused, how does that make sense?\" Sen asked, utterly lost.\n\n\"Sorry, but what I mean is that the device is comparing Fat Gum not to Buu himself but rather the personality that made Fat Buu, the Grand Supreme Kai,\" Izuku explained.\n\n\"The Grand Supreme Kai? You mean the one that Buu consumed?\" Momo asked.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Izuku nodded. \"Wiz said that every form that Buu takes has a personality that matches whoever he consumes, while Kid Buu is supposed to be his original form and Shigaraki is his counterpart. But no one character has ever had more than one counterpart in the same universe.\"\n\n\"Uh, what about the whole 5 people being counterparts with Kirby we just had?\" Kaminari pointed out. \"Hell, you started this whole thing with you also being Batman like Mr. Aizawa.\"\n\n\"But that's because I'm Batman in another universe while Aizawa is Batman in others, just like how I might be Kirby in some universes, while in others Eri, Ochaco, Mina, and Tamaki may be Kirby,\" Izuku pointed out. \"In those separate universes, that character would still have one counterpart to match, not multiple. If the rules applied are the same here, then Buu can't have more than one counterpart in one universe.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Nezu rubbed his chin. \"You propose that rather than Buu having multiple counterparts for every personality, that it is a distinction born only of that his personalities baring counterparts are really the counterparts of those he consumed.\"\n\n\"In a roundabout way, yeah, kind of,\" Izuku rubbed his neck at the summary of his words.\n\nAs Izuku finished, the device spoke up with, \"AFFIRMATIVE! FAT BUU COUNTERPART IS REGISTERED AS SUCH AS THE SOUL OF THE GRAND SUPREME KAI REMAINS AS A PART OF FAT BUU'S PERSONALITY AND STILL EXISTS WITHIN THIS FORM! GRAND SUPREME KAI! MULTIVERSAL COUNTERPART: TAISHIRO TOYOMITSU AKA FAT GUM!\"\n\n\"Phew, okay, that makes sense,\" Kirishima sighed in relief. \"I didn't want to think that my boss was somehow a genocidal monster.\"\n\n\"No way in Hell, Red Riot,\" Fat Gum patted his chest. \"No evil bone in his large body of mine!\"\n\nAs the group eased their minds about the confusion they faced, Miruko still held a contemplative look on her face as she was so busy in her thoughts, that she didn't hear anything that was happening around her. This was because she was still busy thinking about Tomura Shigaraki, or rather his true name as the device revealed: Tenko Shimura. Sure, she heard it before back when he was revealed as Malbogeia's counterpart, but that wasn't exactly on her radar after the craziness that was the explanation of why Midoriya was both Kratos and Spawn. Now, it finally registered to her.\n\n'Tenko Shimura. Shimura. Like...Like Nana Shimura?' Miruko thought to herself. She had kept it to herself, but she was a big fan of Nana Shimura, Hero Codename: Nimbus. The woman was a big source of inspiration for Miruko at a young age both as a strong and powerful Hero and as a muscular and confident woman, and she was as much an idol to her as Midoriya was to All Might. Nimbus's carefree and confident nature inspired her own and even initially competed in Underground Rings as Tiger Bunny before switching career paths to being a Hero like Shimura.\n\nShe was silent when All Might revealed that Shimura was his mentor, though inside she was giddy at the prospect of knowing someone who had personally trained with her idol. Over the past few days, aside from watching these videos, training the Hero Course students, contemplating her strange attraction to Midoriya, and analyzing multiple fighters and their skills, Miruko had also been devising a plan to get All Might to tell her more about Shimura. Despite being her idol, Miruko had no idea why Nimbus suddenly departed from the Hero scene. One minute she was there and then the next she was gone. Rumi didn't know if she quietly retired or if she...Miruko didn't like to think of that option, but she would be a fool to believe it wasn't a possibility for a Hero like her to just disappear out of the blue.\n\nNow, however, it turns out that Tomura Shigaraki, the leader of the League of Villains, his real name turned out to be Tenko Shimura, and Miruko did not like the implication that last name meant. Did it mean that this guy was related to Nimbus? Was he her son, grandson, distant cousin? Whatever the answer, Miruko hoped that the truth that it was simply a coincidence of last names, because the alternative was that a member of her Hero's family had become one of the country's most infamous Villains and was disgracing her name and legacy, and that mad Miruko angry.\n\nAfter a few seconds of reading themselves, the video began again and played the battle.\n\nThe scene began with a bright day in the Kingdom of Dreamland, in what appeared to be Green Greens. A multitude of different citizens, from Waddle Dees, Waddle Doos, and Knuckle Joes, were all enjoying the good day, either walking around or simply standing, a Bonkers was sleeping peacefully, and two Waddle Doos were dancing with each other.\n\n\"Aww, they all look so cute!\" Hagakure cooed. \"Especially those light-tanned ones.\"\n\n\"And peace ruined in three, two, one-\" Setsuna counted down.\n\nSuddenly, a pink beam descended from the heavens like a bolt of lightning. One of the innocent dancing Waddle Doos was turned into a piece of cake, while its friend stared at its friend frozen and wide-eyed.\n\n\"AH!\" Pony yelped at the unfortunate fate of the Waddle Doo.\n\n\"Huh, isn't every day that your friend gets smited into cake,\" Sato said, pale.\n\n\"Wouldn't the correct term be smote?\" Kaminari asked.\n\n\"Nah, I think it's smitten,\" Mineta replied.\n\n\"Really? I thought that meant being smitten with someone?\" Sero scratched his head.\n\n\"URGH! WHO CARES?! JUST SHUT UP SO WE CAN BEGIN THE CARNAGE!\" Bakugou exploded, officially wasting the last of his patience with these idiots.\n\nThe camera moved up to reveal the source of the laser. \"HELLO~!\" Majin Buu, in his Fat form, called out to the Dreamland residents from above.\n\nThe residents looked up at Buu with wide-eyed, frozen terror. Buu then struck one of the Waddle Dees with his Chocolate Beam, turning it into pudding. Finally getting the picture, the rest of the citizens began running around and fleeing in panic, screaming and wailing in fear as more beams came descending from above. Buu continued firing Chocolate Beams left and right, hitting multiple targets before shooting one at the camera.\n\nIzuku's fists clenched tightly. Even if it was Fat Buu doing this, who the analysis made it seem was clueless, his random and uncaring attack on the resident of Dreamland reminded him too much of Shigaraki as if the aspect that was counterpart to the League of Villains leader was directing this senseless act of destruction and gluttony.\n\nFat Gum growled, too, with the knowledge that this form of Buu came about by consuming his counterpart. This form then attacking and turning innocent creatures into treats to eat was both horrifying, disgusting, and insulting to the large Hero.\n\nWhen color returned to the screen it showed Buu floating mid-air, laughing and cheering delightfully at all of the resident civilians turned into various sweets hovering near him. \"Me gonna eat you up!\" Buu cheered, excitedly.\n\nAll Might flinched at that laugh; it sounded like a more childish version of Shigaraki's demented laugh.\n\nBuu picked up one of the nearby chocolate bars and threw it into the air in an attempt to catch it in his mouth, but before it could fall into his mouth, a sudden strong wind, accompanied by an infamous suction sound, pulled the chocolate bar and all of the food away from him.\n\nThe food was all sucked up and swallowed by the hero of Dreamland riding his Warp Star. Kirby gulped all the recently turned food with a look of satisfaction on his face.\n\n\"Ooooh, Kirby stole his meal!\" Mina teasingly voiced, a look of mischief on her face at what her counterpart did.\n\n\"Does he know that all of the food was Dreamland residents?\" Momo questioned, a comical drop of sweat running down her head.\n\n\"From what we've seen of him, I don't think he would notice or care,\" Kyoka shrugged.\n\nBuu was shocked at t"
