        "text": "Post by Jason9000 on\n\nOkay I will admit it's been a very long time since I made a new thread so please bear with me. With chapter 88 of the main tournament completed and Zen Buu is out of the story (most likely for now or who knows maybe he is gone completely). As we have examined U16 Bra and her characterization. I believe it is time we take a look at Zen Buu. As this will have a lot of pictures from the comic itself. I will put a spoiler tag here and a summary at the bottom. Words of warning, I will not be putting a spoiler tag for every comic page I use and I will not be using the novel. Most people read the comic and not the novel. I am operating under the belief that if you can't express the desired outcome in the comic, show, or movie, and have to use a novel, then you did not tell your story properly. You shouldn't have to rely on the novel to explain things that don't make sense in the main comic. Now this is going to be a long one, so buckle up buckaroos!\n\nI will start off briefly with a brief history of Universe 4 Buu. (This will be in page release order and not his chronological history baring the very first chapter of the comic.) His first real speaking appearance is on page 70 where he heals Uub's arm and he gives three different yet plausible reasons of why he helped Uub despite looking annoyed out of his mind.\n\nThe next page has him confirming that in his Universe he won against the Z-gang and absorbed many people to increase his powers since then. Following this we don't see much of Zen Buu. He's seen eating a ton of candy during the first lunch break where U16 Piccolo asks U16 Vegito if anyone at the tournament worries him and Vegito claims that U4 Buu doesn't worry him and neither does U20Broly. As we know Broly wakes up, kills a Varga, and the tournament organizers try to send him home, but then we this page.\n\nCompletely fine and similar to the end of Z where Goku asked Good Buu to use his magic to let his opponent be Uub at the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament. Zen Buu is then watching the match and after Vegito enters his second transformation and enters the ki beam struggle we got this (although this page is out of order I'm posting here like I mentioned above.)\n\nHere we see Zen Buu a little shocked at what happened. Not scared out of his mind, but genuinely surprised. However on page 218 we get more of his inner thoughts.\n\nHere Buu doesn't seem to concerned with Vegito and believes he will have to step in. Vegito unleashes Super Saiyan 3 to the public for the first time. We see many people cover their eyes, but we never see Zen Buu's reaction to it. Fast forward a bit to page 230 and Buu decides to go after Broly.\n\nA page later Vegito notices that Zen Buu is gone and we get these next couple of pages.\n\nHere we see Vegito showing off that he never lost Broly and could track him easily. While reminding Buu that he killed him in his universe and would do so again if he had to. Buu gloats that he's far superior than what Vegito had faced and was confident in his abilities of besting Vegito. However, even weakened Vegito realized that Buu was moving tiny parts of himself toward Broly, but stopped him immediately with his 'Kill Buu technique\". With this begins the habit of Buu underestimating his opponents because he is the supreme god in his Universe. This does become a pattern so I'll do my best to keep count.\n\nFor the rest of the chapter we get a weakened Vegito, Bra, and Gohan vs Zen Buu. They're barely able to hold him back as he makes multiple copies of himself to try and absorb Broly. Eventually Bra snaps and does this on page 275.\n\nWhile Buu is caught by surprise again the next page shows he's made too many copies of himself for Bra to kill and she snaps out of it when she realizes that Vegito and Gohan were hurt by her actions. I would call this the second time he's underestimated an opponent, but like I said he's too spread out and is only momentarily caught by surprise. The three Universe 16 group return to the arena since Broly was sent back without them noticing during their fight. Buu follows and looks furious but calms down as seen here.\n\nVegito is left confused of Buu's true intentions and Buu still remains confident he can beat all three of them at their best with his own power. After this match, for the most part we are lead to believe that with U20 Broly gone and not using his \"MAXIMUMMEST POWER HAX\". Vegito is still the top dog with it implying Buu isn't far behind.\n\nLater in the first round it's U19 Xeniloum vs Buu on page 327.\n\nHere we see Buu has incredible hearing and was listening in on the Universe 18 and 19 conversation about the new Ultra Armors. Buu is actually being courteous and reminding Xeniloum that as both touched the ring, he could have attacked without checking to see if Buu was ready.\n\nAs a side note, I will admit I do miss this characterization of Buu where he seems to be respectful, not exactly in the mocking way of Frieza. It's seems more genuine, although it probably stems from his own ego and believed superiority over everyone. I do miss this over the troll like qualities he later shows in the comic.\n\nThe rest of the fight plays out as follows.\n\nBuu takes the Ultra armor at its technology interests him. At this point from what we've seen the Heloits of U19 have incredible technology that according to Piccolo can wipe out anyone below Super Saiyan 2 and can cut people's limbs off with ease. Because of this, we're lead to assume that they don't exist in Universe 4 or Buu just didn't encounter them yet.\n\nLater on we see Buu during U3 Bardock's flashing images of the future during his fight with U13 Raditz on page 419 where we see Buu starting his first rampage along with some more future images.\n\nFollowing this we see Buu on page 485 asking for Gast and the organizers to forgo the disqualification and fight the Cell Junior that attacked him without touching the ring.\n\nAfter the end of the first day we see Buu chatting with Frieza on page 528.\n\nWe see Buu telling Frieza that the Dragon Balls are not here and the organizers were smart to leave them elsewhere. Also that he is aware that Captain Ginyu is still alive as he can sense that someone is not in their correct body. While he does troll Frieza, it's really minor compared to down the road.\n\nThe next day we get the fight between XXI and Vegito where Buu comments that he hopes the organizers will do the right thing on page 729. A couple of pages later Buu asks one of the organizers to ask XXI for a rematch with Vegito. Vegito then teleports away and then we get the start of Buu's first rampage that Bardock saw in one of his visions.\n\nSee page 740 here? Where Zen Buu covers Babidi's mouth, because he knows the sealing spell that Bibidi hardwired into his very structure as a failsafe? This is important and we'll come back to this much later.\n\nThe next pages show that only Universe 18 combining their strength to make a shield can barely hold back Buu and every other Universe is taken over. Then we get page 744 that rocks Buu's world.\n\nHere Gast is fed up with Buu's shenanigans and uses some type of telekinesis technique to grab up every bit of Buu and confine him to floating ball above his hand. This is Buu's wake up that he might not be as powerful as he thinks. For the second time Buu underestimated someone at the tournament. Gast stopped him completely without using Bibidi's sealing spell. This has never happened before and rightfully confuses the hell out of Buu.\n\nWe're treated to a flashback chapter where on pages 769 and 770 talking to U16 Bra and Gohan letting them know he sensed a portal opening where Vegito was sucked inside. He realizes that Vegito will break out and assures them when he returns they can ask for a rematch as I stated above.\n\nWe also see on page 774 that he's amazed at how U2 Arale is distorting reality much better than he can with his magic. He wonders out loud where did Universe 2 come from and why is it so different from the rest.\n\nWe then flash forward to chapter 36 where he's still being held by Gast. The first five pages are the organizers, Supreme Kais, and Gast are talking about what to do with Buu. Gast believes they should send him back, but Buu broke all of the machines. They ask if he can hold Buu long enough for the new machines to arrive or if he can go with them as they drop Buu off. Buu then begs them to let him remain, claiming the thousands of personalities had him lash out, he'd repair everything, and would go along with being sent back if he does anything bad. Gast and four of the Supreme Kais do not believe him. Some of the Universe 19 are annoyed at Buu trying to manipulate the situation again and the audience is divided.\n\nThen we get page 794...\n\nGrand Supreme Kai goes against the very policy he instituted back on chapter 25 on page 552.\n\nRightly so, the other Supreme Kais are shocked at this action as he was the one that started their mandate of being proactive and stopping evil the moment they find out. Now he's throwing caution to the wind and claiming he can copy Gast's technique and hold him until his next fight. Despite Gast stating he doesn't intend to hold him until the next round. Which is most likely Gast saying he can't hold him for that long without tiring himself out if he has to wait that long. However Grand Supreme Kai assures everyone that he can copy the technique. Even with Goku doubting it, Piccolo assumes that his knowledge of magic is very deep and was able to analyze and copy it.\n\nWe don't much of Buu until chapter 39, the second flashback chapter when Vegito went missing for about two hours.\n\nI won't post the entire fight here. But again just like against his fight with Xeniloum. He allows his opponent to do what they can against him. Tien tries the Evil Containment Wave (Yes I am using the English names for everything.) But fails, because Buu placed copies of himself everywhere. Although he does lie by claiming he only has copies of himself on the ring. Tien tries his best, but Buu is just too powerful.\n\nWe'll jump to chapter 42. Where we get the page that I now believe was the beginning of making Buu into the overpowered troll that he is.\n\nHere we see West Supreme Kai checking with Grand to see if Buu is properly maintained as they are going to use a set of Dragon Balls to resurrect the fighters who have died in the tournament so far. Here Grand makes a comment that Buu is secured and his power is beyond the Dragon's. Now at the time when I read this, I assumed Grand meant warping reality. Not once in anywhere in the comic did it imply Buu could bring people back from the dead like one of the Eternal Dragons. That power was always something special to the Dragons. We've seen Buu change people and objects into food or other such things, but not bringing someone back from the dead. Hindsight is 20/20 and I'm surprised I missed this.\n\nFollowing this we get this page where North and East Supreme Kai speak about Grand acting weird and under the influence of Buu. And boy did we all underestimate how much they were right.\n\nAnd with that I will end part 1 of this. I've left my laptop open for almost a week without shutting it down and it's causing it too slow down from leaving this open. Unless anyone knows how to save making a thread let me know as I would greatly appreciate it. Mods if you know how to put multiple spoiler tags let me know or edit this as you see fit since I have a lot of images from the comic. I'll have part 2 up in a few days.\n\nSummary for Part I: Buu's initial introduction was great. He was a mysterious character where many fans were guessing his strength. Based on his dialogue he claimed to be able to beat Vegito and put up a decent fight against an exhausted Vegito. However the comic showed that he had the habit of underestimating his opponents, which cost him greatly. Like I said in the spoiler, if anyone can direct me to putting in more than one spoiler tag, I will edit this with all the comic pictures in the thread. I'll have part 2 up in a few days as leaving my laptop on so I save this thread slows my computer down and I can only be on for a little bit at a time each day.\n\nPost by Jason9000 on\n\nNow here is my Part II of my Universe 4 Buu and where I think it all started to go downhill for his character. Like I mentioned in my post above. I will have the full thread under a singular spoiler tag and a summary at the bottom of my Part II thread. And again I won't be using the novel for the same reason as I said above. Alright let's begin!\n\nSo last I left off was the beginning of chapter 44 Buu's Escapades.\n\nThe first page of the chapter are North and East Supreme Kai still talking about Grand acting strange. North claiming he's been observing Grand's body, mind, and soul. However, nothing has changed according to him with East saying he spoke to Gast and Gast can't confirm nor deny that Grand was able to successfully copy his \"Stop!\" technique. With Gast also saying that his technique shouldn't be easy to copy. North postulates that Buu is working with Grand, but they aren't sure and both vow to remain vigilant.\n\nOn page 985, we see a small particle of Buu come out of the ground.\n\nBoy do I remember the debates when this page dropped and everything else afterwards. The idea of DBM's triumvirate of Vegito, Buu, and Gast was rocked to the core. At this point U20 Broly was gone and XXI was still too much of an enigma. On the one side we had those that claimed Gast never stopped Buu and it was all an act, and the other that Gast did stop Buu. But the moment he gave Buu over to Grand Kai he was able to escape. I admit I was in the later camp. At the time it didn't make sense for Buu to pretend to be captured by Gast just to do this. We only had Elder Kai from Universe 9 act surprised that XXI was there, but it was treated as a gag to the rest of the characters where he claimed it was not the one he was thinking of.\n\nThe rest of the chapter deals with Buu dishing out 'upgrades' to the participants of the next round to make things 'interesting'.\n\n*As a side note, I did chuckle at the time seeing Buu singing a classic Christmas song. And we get a panel of North and East questioning Grand. Although I feel like it should have been done in the morning. Because either North and East are slow as shit while walking. Or they've been standing there for hours and North just felt like asking this random question.*\n\nSo Buu uses his magic to repair Universe 14 Android 18, share his secrets of fusion with Goten and Trunks, talk to Universe 8 Buu about the rules, give Uub a magic lesson in his dreams, give Tapion a better way to control Hirudegarn, recharge Raichi's machine, give Frieza a false memory that expands his physic abilities, and have Cold use his intellect to make a wager with Son Bra.\n\n*Another aside, I am kind of bummed that Universe 16 Goten and Trunks didn't also get the secrets of fusion. Had the boys of Universe 16 been training the entire time and be stronger than their counterparts it would have been interesting to see a stronger Gotenks vs one that fuse back faster with no issue. But, that's another thread I don't have time for right now.*\n\nBuu's magic here wasn't anything spectacular. He hasn't shown stuff out of the realm of what Super Buu could do if he won and absorbed more people to increase his power. While I was still confused on how he's running around I was fine with little flashes of him having fun and using his powers.\n\nHowever, he completely skipped Cell because he never sleeps, Son Bra or 'furious girl' doesn't need help, Goku and Vegeta wouldn't accept any because of their Saiyan nature, and finally Gast. At the time I found this comment strange, as if Buu was so far above Gast why wouldn't he try to boost him? Gast shouldn't be able to detect him. However, I later chalked it up to him being bitter at being stopped an d not that Gast didn't need a boost. Although that was a little while after reading the chapter again back when the Majin Rebellion began.\n\nFinally Buu goes to check up on the XXI and we got this on page 993.\n\nHere Buu is surprised at the apartment being changed and then XXI destroying this piece of himself, commenting that the attack was strong. I remember being surprised as well. I didn't expect anyone below Ultimate Gohan able to destroy pieces of Zen Buu based on the fight in space. This did feed the rumor mill of Buu and Grand working together. But, for a long time we didn't get anything from it.\n\nWe don't see Zen Buu for a while until chapter 51 where Buu fights against Gotenks.\n\nWe start off on page 1147 where we see some of Babidi's pawns captured earlier by Pan and Videl. Foreshadowing what is coming. Grand also 'releases' Zen Buu and the djinn does put on the persona of being contrite for what happened and departs for the ring without issue.\n\nWhile Gotenks shows off his new way of fusion, we have Uuub putting on his detective cap and noticing that someone or something helped the both of them.\n\nFinally after many years, Buu powers up for the first time. The audience amazed at this power and Goku commenting he hasn't felt anything this strong since Vegito and Broly's fight the previous day. Another point cementing Buu's claim that he could beat Vegito. There is also a panel of Vegito with a drop of sweat. I interpreted it as Vegito annoyed that it's not him up there fighting Buu, but I do remember seeing others say this was Vegito a little nervous about being able to beat Buu. We see Gotenks shocked by Zen Buu's strength, but quickly powers up in response. Also we get a funny scene of Goku pointing out that Gotenks could beat him and Vegeta both quite easily to the annoyance of Vegeta.\n\nI won't post the whole fight. Most of it is Gotenks catching Buu off guard for a second, but Buu usually responds before Gotenks lands a surprise attack. While Gotenks seems to be a good sparing partner. His fusion time runs out and Buu mocks Goten and Trunks. But they show a new fusion dance on page 1154. Showing what Buu meant by his knowledge of fusion.\n\nGotenks showing that he can go back to full power with each dance with no time handicap. On the next page some of the Universe 18 members are surprised by this, but they don't comment on it. Zen Buu also decides to test out the Ultra Armor and it holds up really well against an enhanced Gotenks.\n\nIn the pages I've posted the armor's shield is able to tank a powerful Ki attack from Gotenks, it's sword is still a danger to Gotenks implying it could cut him to pieces, and the carbonite is still a danger. This really speaks more to the Universe 19 crew. Honestly give them another two decades and they're obliterating everyone in this tournament. That's even with the gains the various fighters would make if Universe 19's technological progress doesn't stagnate at all from what we've seen from the Universe 19 special to the time of the tournament.\n\nWe get this next page where Gotenks defuses through his own willpower. Which I don't think has been shown in DBM or in official Dragon Ball material. Although I could be wrong and just missed it.\n\nThe fight ends with Zen Buu easily knocking out Goten and Trunks commenting that Gotenks fools around way too much and that individually they're not that strong so there wouldn't be a point to prolonging the fight.\n\nWe see Grand open his hand with Buu returning to his ball form. However, the dialogue between the two of them shows that Buu was putting on a show of being captured again. This did look like another point for the pro Buu crowd and I did start to waiver in that Gast never actually stopped him and that Bigger Green wasn't as powerful as we initially thought. We then get a lunch break and don't see Buu until the beginning of chapter 55 right at the end of Bra and Cold fight.\n\nHere we see Buu complimenting Son Bra on her various techniques she used against her opponent. I won't dive into the senzu bean debate as this is focusing more on Zen Buu and that has been done to death already. Buu comments that both Bra and Vegito have developed different techniques. Vegito could have ended his fight with Broly early, but he wanted to beat Broly the old fashioned away with punches and powerful Ki blasts. Showing that Buu is very perceptive and putting two and two together while watching fighters. We also see Grand call out Buu for the 'boosts' he gave everyone. However, Buu counters that he didn't increase anyone's power. He just brought the techniques and moves into the forefront of their mind. A sort of 'they had it in them all along' thing, but I don't believe that for Frieza with the false memory thing and seemed to increase his psychic powers.\n\nWe also saw the Ginyu subplot pay off where it was revealed that 'King Cold' was actually Ginyu. Buu wasn't just messing with Frieza and proved to be correct in his statement that someone in Universe 8 wasn't in their original body. Buu showing the ability to detect souls was interesting, but he never did anything with it. It seems similar to Vegito's claim that he can destroy souls later in this chapter on page 1254. Sounds cool, but we never see it and we never learned how Buu developed this ability.\n\nAfter this we don't see Buu again until the start of the Majin Rebellion. In chapter 59 we see Buu and the other participants on the gaseous planet that Babidi found in the hopes of killing most of the fighters off.\n\nOn page 1351 after Gast makes the dome of breathable air, the others begin discussing what happened where someone from Universe 19, (I can't remember all of their names to be honest. But, that's my fault) accusing Buu of taking them there, but he points out he's a victim of it too.\n\nIn the next couple of pages most are discussing what's going. They realize that Babidi has sprung a revolt and is most likely the ringleader. Goku says they have to go back quickly to stop him, but a nonchalant Vegito isn't fazed since there are two Gohans and Bra there. However, no one is listening and rightly still trying to get back asap. Goku does ask Buu for help with the panel, because of his last encounter, but Buu points out it's just a metal plate and they're not on Babidi's ship.\n\nHere we see on page 1354 that Buu has a small part of himself in the arena, knowing where to teleport and refuses to help because he wants to watch this play out. Showing that he's still a trickster and won't immediately help if it ruins what he believes will be fun.\n\nThe Rebellion plays out for a bit and we don't see the group until chapter 63. We see him on the first two pages.\n\nHere he tags up with Gotenks to 'look' for the arena. I'm assuming he did this, because it's easier to block Gotenks searching for the arena. But this was most likely just for gags.\n\nA few pages later on 1437, the two Vegetas are about to duke it out, but stop. We then get a funny gag concerning Buu.\n\nHere Buu made a bench with food for himself, Vegito, and Goku. Honestly between the three of them I can't tell who wants to watch this more. Also Gast in the background sells this for me.\n\nLater in chapter 66, we see Grand speaking out to Buu telepathically.\n\nHere we see that Grand and Buu are still communicating with each other. He asks Buu to stop Babidi and the others, but Buu of course being Buu wants to see this play out.\n\nUp until this point Buu has shown to be a chaotic, whacky, and powerful character. His various feats have shown him to still be in the upper bracket of the tournament's strongest fighters. His joking personality does make him endearing and funny.\n\nHOWEVER!\n\nThis all changed when this chapter dropped.\n\nChapter 67, changed everything and in my personal opinion made Buu into an unnecessarily overpowered character that breaks the story more than adding to it.\n\nNow I've made this thread long and realize I will need to make a part III. So expect that soon.\n\nSummary for Part II: From chapter 44 to chapter 67 Zen Buu started a debate between the three top fighters that went on for many years. Didi Gast stop him or was it all faked? The 'boosts' that he gave the other fighters for the next round were more along the lines of 'mental' boosts to the fighters and not physically augmenting them. We also saw the beginning of the Grand Buu conspiracy with Buu seemingly acting being imprisoned. His power to warp reality was not much different from what we saw in Dragon Ball Z, even with the filler arcs. However, the image of being a chaotic, mischievous character fell away when we got the Universe 4 special in chapter 67-Make A Wish. Which I will dive into in Part III. Hope everyone enjoyed!"
