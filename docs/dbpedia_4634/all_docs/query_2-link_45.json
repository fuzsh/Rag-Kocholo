Plus none of that ''This planet is going to explode in 5 minutes'' nonsense either in this.\n\nA couple of things that did bother me and questioned about were the training segments in the film on how the training segments was presented within the duration of time that the movie had and how frieza could even attain such power to be almost on par on goku's level of power prior to them facing each other from over the course of 10 years ago from now within this film and then within the space of 4 months frieza somehow surpasses some of the strongest characters including android 18, Cell, Majin Buu, Gohan etc, etc?? I'm sorry but to me that felt like pure BS.\n\nI must also point out that other characters were left out from the film which also did threw me off when watching.\n\nWhile watching how characters in the film are introduced into the story it sometimes did feel a little unnatural when its rushing through scenes into some brief interactions along with some reminders of the series while having this encompassing the film for the first third of it led this into being quite slow in place to start off just to get towards the big moments in the movie which a lot of people just mostly want to see.\n\nMaybe its because I'm watching the Japanese theatrical version of this since I did watched the movie premiere in theatres which makes me also interested as to how the extended version of this movie will flush out more stuff than this version.\n\nI do feel its structure with the characters though to be quite questionable and it might also hinder some viewers who do want a better understanding and possibly something of a better build up to its source material into this from the previous film. basically what I mean is how the film starts out and for the most part the story plays a lot of stuff more safer like the other films in this franchise but as a fan it didn't bother me that much.\n\nArt/Animation - 9.5\n\nThere is no doubt for me as a fan, that this animation is some of the most impressive that I've seen out all of the dragon ball movies in general and no I'm not kidding. It steps up way more than even the likes of battle of gods in terms of art and animation as its shown at better angles with more of an enhanced flow in the action department which looks excellent from an animation standpoint. though I will admit the cgi is pretty noticeable and does seem a little stiff in this however this didn't detract from how excellent the animation looks. No doubt Best looking Dragonball film to date.\n\nAlso Loved the action segments in this, They were awesome in this film!!\n\nSound/Voice - 8\n\nThe soundtracks are pretty good especially Freeza by Maximum The Hormone it really Kicks Ass!! No surprise if you've heard their other hardcore soundtracks from their albums or even in other animes such as Death Note which to me their theme of friezadoes fits frieza's demeanour In general for this movie.\n\nMomoiro Clover Z ending theme personally didn't suit this movie ending what so ever. If only they could just stick to sailor moon's music and stay far, far away from dragon ball related stuff.\n\nApart from them, the music and the voice acting was really superb.\n\nThe Dub performance is as perfect as it will be. My only nitpick with the dub if I'm being honest was mainly just Frieza mentioning in excitement of how he could reach a power level over 1.3 million which to me did not make a lot of sense But overall Its a fantastic dub as to be expected.\n\nCharacter - 6.5\n\nNow of course this movie doesn't just showcase Frieza's malicious and usual arrogance as the villain that he is at times but it also displays the progression of Goku and Vegeta actually training for the first time alongside one another which was quite a surprise to me and Its great since there rivalry is so damn popular.\n\nThe characters in this have great interactions among the cast with great standout scenes with Bulma, Krillin, Master Roshi, Gohan and Piccolo being shown to what they are have been up to since the last movie and from that also includes newly added character Jaco from akira Toriyama's Manga Jaco The Galactic patrolman in the film never seen before in the show, Its Like a calm before the storm until frieza and his entire army appear to get ready for an all out war with the earth at stake, No surprise yet again.\n\nI kinda wish certain characters who were absent in this movie were in this just like battle of gods which had a full house cast of the characters from the show, To me they would of played a much more deserve role for this to give more creative routes and moments towards this movie.\n\nI would like to elaborate much more on the characters but again It will go into spoiler territory from here on in so again I'll allow you to find that out for yourself since it is that typical shonen formula of Good Vs Evil.\n\nA negative though that I must mention is the ending which felt quite brief in closing with the characters which could of been done better in my opinion especially on Vegeta's behalf.\n\nEnjoyment - 8\n\nIt certainly was entertaining and for fans who enjoy the franchise in general no matter how long its been, In my opinion I certainly feel it was a fun movie and I will say its worth a watch to check out that Dbz nostalgia here and there.\n\nIts better also since the action scenes kicked a lot of ass with the Z-fighters. Also seeing the premiere of this made watching this even more memorable. Still I can't believe this franchise has been around for over 30 years now and honestly this made me remember some parts of the series again while watching this movie in a fond positive type of way, which is something quite special.\n\nOverall - 7\n\nI had my doubts about this movie beforehand and I knew I just wanted to see this for the fun of it and I'm so glad I did because it really was.\n\nI enjoyed it very much as a fan. of course your going to get some people bashing this movie from their own critical standpoint but I know all too well its like this on MAL with a lot of popular animes so its no surprise, so with all that being said my overall score for this movie is 7/10.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nDragon Ball Z Movie 15: Fukkatsu no F Review (Dub BTW)\n\nStory (7/10) Good\n\nThe story for Fukkastu No F is good not very good just got IT'S DRAGONBALL PEOPLE one of the main reason majority of people watch Dragonball is not really for the story so when you hear what the plot is for Fukkatsu No F you shouldn't be surprised that it's straight forward. Frieza is revived by the Dragonballs, he invades earth they fight him simple. It is what it is and I think at best it's good I didn't have an issue with he because it's not what I watch Dragonball for it's ... not bad so that's all that really matters to me if it was you would see something less then what this website considers a 7.\n\nArt and Animation (7/10) Good\n\nMore Specifically (7.75/10) Good+\n\nThe art I thought was very good it's Toei if Toei knows how to do anything it's right it's making something look good. This section is call ART so I wouldn't be talking about animation too much. But as far as CG is concerned it look OK, I noticed it from time to time like when Frieza's troops start to fly at the Z warriors or when Frieza at certain parts during the main fight and it didn't necessarily bother me, now could we have done without them? YES! But is it something to complain about? NO (At least not to me). To the unkeen eye in the Theater (which is where I watched it) I bet 50% of the people didn't even notice it, which is why I say it's nothing to complain about, it's here so deal with it, doesn't ruin my experience.\n\nSound (9/10) Great\n\nGranted I watched this in the Theater in English Dubbed so this counts for sound to me. Now all of the sound effects sound great, this is a category that's hard to mess up so a 9 sounds reasonable to me. The English voice actors were amazing at their lines they me it sound great. Especially Sean Schemmel which is always good but I when I certain a certain groan noise in pain for Goku in the scene when Frieza is stomping on Goku's wound when he was on the floor that solidified it for me that he's not only still good at doing Goku's voice but he's gotten even better. All the other voice actors are great also the voice they chose for Jako was pretty good also, it took sometime to get used to but once I did it fits him (I hope they don't change it).\n\nCharacter (8/10)\n\nMore Specifically (8.50/10) Very Good+\n\nAll my favorite DBZ characters are back (not in their prime sure.. Gohan) but back nonetheless! And seeing all of them is why I enjoy this anime and movie because everyone acted exactly how I remembered nothing has changed and that's perfect for me. Jako the new character introduced in the movie \"in my opinion\" stole the show he was outstandingly entertaining and unique. I've read all the chapters of his manga a couple months back so I have knowledge of him going into this movie. So to see that his personality moved over to the big screen is great because I think he's a great addition to the group and I hope (we most likely will) we see more of him after the Fukkastu No F Arc in DBS.\n\nEnjoyment (9/10) Great\n\nThe best thing as far as enjoyment to this movie in my opinion is the pacing. In comparison to Battle of Gods (which took just a little too long to get to the fight which is what majority of people watch Dragonnball Z for) Fukkatsu No F didn't jump straight into the fight but it kept it a length that didn't have me saying \"Ok I get it can we get to the fights now?\". Granted I enjoyed all of the dubbed Diolague in Dragon Ball. Filler or not filler, even in the anime, even in Battle of Gods I enjoyed it all because I love the characters of Dragonball so interaction between characters in Dragonball is enjoyment enough for me. And as if there's anything both Battle of Gods and Fukkastu no F did right is the comedy. Dragonball, Dragonball Z and even GT (to an extent) has always had entertaining comedy but these too movies I feel have one upped the stuff before it. It could be just me or it could be I haven't seen anything Dragonball is such a long time that I have forgotten how hilarious it can be (only thing that has kept DBZ comedy alive over the recent year is Team Four Star..). I personally feel it's at it's best when it comes to comedy in comparison to anything that this helped in enjoyment so much and always have for in anything Dragonball which is why even when a fight isn't being thrown I'm entertained and Fukkastu No F did it's job the Theater was laughing so hard sometimes I couldn't hear the seconds of dialogue after the joke the released it is what it is..\n\nOverall (8/10) Very Good\n\nMore Specifically (8.25/10) Very Good+\n\nThis movie to me is very good. I met damn near all my expectations from an anime movie (and anime movies especially DBZ movies are very good at best now that's something I can say). The pacing, characters and dialogue alone makes it a 8 to me. I have no clue what people were excepting from this anime movie and a DBZ movie at the least, you can't say this movie is just like the other 13 gtfo (not counting Battle of Gods).\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\n-A love letter from Akira Toriyama-\n\n_Revival of ‘F’_ is the film the _Dragon Ball_ fandom has been waiting for. Taking place after 2013’s _God and God_, this film has all of the action and mayhem that the franchise is known for. In a first for the series, the film has an underlying focus on Goku and Vegeta's character flaws rather than simply becoming stronger and beating the bad guy.\n\nToriyama stated that the film would be “utterly hilarious” and he wasn’t lying. This is the most fun I’ve had watching something in the series for a very long time. Combined with an amazing fight that spans ... over half the film and actual character development for Goku, this is the film everyone wanted the rather disappointing _God and God_ to be. Whereas that film spent most of its time with slice of life pieces and Vegeta trying to keep Beerus from getting angry only to have a ten minute fight between Goku and Beerus in the end, _Revival of ‘F’_ wastes no time getting to business. It must be noted though that this film borders on being a parody of itself due to the type of humor in it and a scene where Freeza himself is terrified instead of terrifying due to seeing Beerus a few feet away from him. It isn't bad, this film lacks the threatening tone or mood that the series had back when everyone was on Namek, and Freeza himself is more comical than threatening.\n\nWhile this film has everything a fan has wanted in a new film, there *are* a few drawbacks. In a number of scenes the animation is noticeably less than stellar instead of buttery smooth, and there are two or three CGI scenes that are cringe worthy due to their simplicity. The ending is also a bit abrupt with the epilogue being around only two minutes long. Most importantly, many fans' favorite characters such as Yamcha, Trunks, Goten, Chiaotzu, Mr. Satan and Majin Boo do not make any appearances. Artificial Human #18 has a few small lines in the beginning before focus shifts to Krillin, Master Roshi, Gohan, Piccolo, Tien Shinhan, Bulma, and Freeza.\n\nDespite its drawbacks this is the film that fans of the franchise want and will leave with their fists in the air while talking about their hero, Goku, and the amazing fight between the most evil villain of their childhood making a stupendous theatrical appearance with the latest standards in animation and a great soundtrack to boot as they watch a fierce battle just like in the old days.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nServing as a continuation of \"Battle of the Gods,\" Vegeta and Goku are now under the training of Beerus' master/servant, Whis. However, a former of servant of Freeza brings him back to life with the Dragon Balls and he is back with a golden vengeance.\n\nThis movie is pretty much fan service for those who loved the Freeza part of the series. How is Freeza back and better than ever? He claims he trained though you don't really see it. The movie moves at a pretty moderate pace but the final fight dragged a little longer than it should have as the original anime series ... did with its fights. This movie makes use of its cast (Kuririn, Roshi, Tenshinhan, Piccolo and Gohan) but the way Gohan and Roshi are used is a little strange.\n\nThe fighting in terms of defense is more fluid and a lot of kung fu-esque counter movements are used which i felt was new. The only way to further evolve DBZ's fighting is the panning and zooming and I think the movie excellently frames the action and keeps up with its pace.\n\nI am a bit mixed on the music. When Freeza is brought back, there is this heavy metal song which suits the character but the ending theme by Momoiro Clover Z to me just doesn't fit. Momoiro Clover Z for Sailor Moon Crystal is perfect but I just feel their music does not represent DBZ. To me, the change of DBZ's soundtrack is like Initial D without MOVE and the Eurobeat and Cowboy Bebop without the jazz.\n\nThe current living and active voice cast reprise their roles. Nakao Ryuusei as Freeza still has the role excellently down even to his ho ho ho ho ho laugh. The movie also does an interesting play on Tanaka Mayumi playing Kuririn and Luffy in relation to his cell phone's ring tone. Other than that, don't watch this with either high or low expectations. Just watch it for the hell of it.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nDragon Ball Z: Resurrection F or \"Fukkatsu no Effu\" is the next movie Akira Toriyama has put out in the franchise to continue the canon since we got \"Battle of Gods\" last year and let me just say now it's great. It is currently (August 4th - 12th) in limited release in the U.S and I HIGHLY recommend you see it in theaters while it's out if you're a fan of the series....I mean wow, the atmosphere in the theater was simply intoxicating. You're surrounded by long time fans of the show which is something that enhanced the experience for me all around. It ... made the jokes funnier, and people's reactions to the \"holy shit!\" Moments just made them so much better. Funimation even made a Pre-Show for us to watch instead of trailers, which was funny and entertaining, only making me want to watch the movie even more. Now onto the movie. Ressurection of F is presented beautifully. The 90's style is still captured in the impeccable animation. Characters from Piccolo to Frieza himself look amazing. And the fight scenes are simply flawless. Movements are fluent and look great, and seeing our heroes use their unique abilities is eye candy. From the opening title sequence to the final fight between Goku and Frieza everything was handled perfectly. However the score took a back seat some of the time. The music that was put into the spotlight was awesome, but fights throughout the film were not enhanced by the soundtrack. The music was either absent or very muffled in contrast to the epic battles that took place. The story is pretty straight forward as well, which is a low point of the film because Battle of Gods had a better story, so here it seems like plot wise, Akira may have taken a small step back. The story is not anywhere close to \"average\" though...it's a solid \"good\" from me. Fans of the series will know what they're getting in terms of plot, it won't impress anyone, but it doesn't at all ditract from how good this film is either. It's an easy to follow story which brings back a fan favorite character that we all love, and delivers an epic final fight. Watching Goku and Vegeta's banter is always great, and character interaction is handled so well, partially because of how commited these voice actors are to their roles. There were hilarious moments as well as awesome fights with supporting characters like Tien and Krillin, which is great because we see them do much more here than we saw in Battle of Gods...However seeing Gohan not step up was disappointing. Akira did such a good job at telling a simple story with plenty of action, as well as adding some unexpected \"WTF\" moments that shocked myself and the audience...how can you not like that? Overall, while the story may not be as good as last time around, Resurrection F makes up for that in much better battles this time around. And though the story was not AS good, it was still very very solid storytelling and I can't flaw Akira for wanting to tell a straight forward story for the fans. I enjoyed the hell out of this movie and I can say the exact same thing for any fans of the show. Please do yourself a favor and see this thing in theaters. 9/10\n\nIf you enjoyed my review give me a thumbs up! Thanks (:\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nOverview:\n\nWe Dragonball fans often tend to be a very emotional bunch that give heated reviews. However, I'm not here to say this movie SUCKED or this movie ROCKED! If you want my honest opinion...this movie was ok. It had some serious flaws, but it had some things it really did well. In the following paragraphs I will explain exactly what I mean.\n\nMy thoughts on the United States Theater release:\n\nIf you don't live in the US or simply don't care about this section, please skip ahead to the plot section.\n\nAfter months of waiting, DBZ movie 15: Resurrection \"F\" has FINALLY been released in US theaters. Of ... course this means it is being released in a very limited number of theaters for 1 week only! This is despite the fact that this movie was the largest box office hit of 2015 thus far in Japan and the US actually has millions of non-anime fans in their 20s and 30s that still grew up with DBZ and might want to see this movie. Why the tiny theatrical release? Are US theaters all owned by people who hate DBZ and don't want this movie to make much money? Obviously that would a very, very silly conspiracy, but not QUITE as groundless and crazy as you might initially think. The 2nd largest movie theater chain in the United States is called AMC theaters, which is owned by Chinese billionaire Jianlin Wang. Mr. Wang is a very patriotic ex-Red Army veteran that is also a high ranking official of the Chinese Communist Party and happens to NOT like Japan very much. Japanese produced films like those released by Sony Pictures have seen their profits plunge in the US since 2012 when the Dalian He-Xing Corporation controlled by the Chinese government bought out AMC and several other US theaters to increase China's \"soft power\" overseas. Japanese financed films in the US are now shown on fewer screens and for shorter times, at least in part thanks to the efforts of the Chinese government. At this point I should be grateful that the CCP allowed this movie to be released in the US at all. Thank you Honorable Chairman Xi Jinping!\n\nPlot:\n\nWarning! This contains Spoilers!!!\n\nThe plot is honestly the largest problem with this movie. You can tell that Toriyama himself wrote it because it contains the kind of plot holes and continuity errors that only the master of \"not giving a fuck about his own work\" is capable of. If this movie was written by someone who had never seen DBZ before and prepared by spending 5 hours reading wikipedia and fan wikia summaries it would have contained far fewer errors!\n\nDue to the high level of bullshit moments, I will give an overview of the plot and count the number \"Cinema Sins\" style with a number enclosed in parenthesis (1)\n\nThe adventure begins with Freeza's henchmen going to Earth to gather the dragon balls. These henchmen were stated to have roughly equal power to the Ginyu force and like all of Freeza's henchmen did not have the ability to repress their power levels. However, unlike previous examples of abnormally strong power levels approaching the planet, none of the Z fighters noticed the presence of these minions and thus never tried to stop them (1).\n\nThe henchmen wish for Freeza to come back to life, but the Dragon states that since he died when Buu destroyed the Earth, he now has new rules and can only bring back a body in the shape it was in at the time of death. Freeza got sliced and diced by Trunks and therefore his body could only be brought back in the tiny pieces that Trunks cut him into. The Earth's \"eternal\" dragon Shenlong has been killed twice before the time Buu destroyed Earth and there were no changes to his rules following the first 2 times Shenlong was restored (2).\n\nThe minions simply take the small pieces of Freeza's corpse and place them in the healing tank, which perfectly restores Freeza's body. This is despite the fact that the healing tank used by Freeza's men in previous sagas could NOT restore the dead or heal such serious wounds as being in tiny pieces. That is precisely why Freeza's body had to be rebuilt as a cyborg following the explosion of Namek and his body was in MUCH better condition after Namek than after Trunks (3).\n\nFreeza died in his \"final form\" which is actually his original form and the other forms were created to preserve energy. Yet, when the healing machine pieces him back together while he is unconscious, he is somehow in his most repressed transformation (4).\n\nFreeza is informed that Goku has gotten much stronger and defeated Majin Buu, which shocks Freeza since we apparently now learn that Freeza's father once warned him of Majin Buu and Beerus the God of Destruction. Although I like that Toriyama has tried hard to retcon Beerus into the DBZ world, it makes ZERO sense for Freeza's father to have heard of Majin Buu! This is because at any time in Freeza's life when his father could have told him this information, Buu was sealed away and hadn't been seen by anyone for millions of years. There would be no reason to believe that Buu was still alive and even North Kai hadn't heard of Buu because it happened way before the lifetime of a low level Kai like him. The only characters with the knowledge of the entire history of the universe to know about Majin Buu were the Supreme Kai, other high level immortal Gods like Beerus, and the several million year old wizard Babidi. Apparently King Cold is a WAY better historian than any other mortal character and can predict that someone thought dead for millions of years is actually still somehow alive (5).\n\nFreeza announces that despite having a power level several thousand times lower than Majin Buu and well over 10,000 times lower than SSJ God Goku, that with six months of training he could fight on the same level as Goku. We learn that Freeza \"has never trained a minute is his life\" and that the only reason he isn't the strongest character in the Dragonball Universe is that he is the laziest character in the history of fiction. Freeza was certainly arrogant in DBZ, but he was also a highly ambitious tyrant that was totally bent on domination. Why would it make sense that he has never once worked out in his life and is even lazier than Oblomov (cookie if you got that last joke). This not only completely derails Freeza's character, but we never even get to see a second of apparently the greatest power boost training in Dragonball history! (6).\n\nWe see the lovably flamboyant Whis training Goku and Vegeta and learn that both of them can now achieve a 2nd level of Super Saiyan God! Seriously?! Vegeta took forever to go SSJ 1 and never even came close to learning SSJ 3. How in the fuck did Vegeta in a couple months attain SSJ God lvl 2?! Whis is obviously one HELL of a teacher. Maybe he is the one who secretly trained Freeza in order to provide a challenge for Goku!!! Nah, that would make too much logical sense. The real answer is that Toriyama doesn't give a fuck! (7).\n\nFreeza invades Earth and an epic battle begins between Freeza's soldiers and the Z fighters. This includes Master Roshi who beats the shit out of dozens of Freeza's soldiers...despite the fact that Raditz was below the average strength of a Freeza soldier and Raditz was 10 times stronger than Roshi in his prime (8).\n\nKrillen tells C-18 to protect their daughter while he fights against Freeza's men. Krillen doesn't want either of them to be in danger, despite the fact that C-18 is over 1000 times stronger than him and FAR less likely to die in battle. Why in fuck would C-18 allow her infinitely weaker spouse to go get himself killed?! She has never been shown to be a coward like Yamcha and we are led to believe that she truly does love Krillen and cares deeply about him. Why wouldn't she just knock Krillen out and go in his place?! Hooray for completely illogical character assassination! (9).\n\nGoku and Vegeta finally arrive to fight against Freeza and the action begins with the now blue haired Goku against Golden Freeza. Goku seems to gain the upper hand, but one of Freeza's minions with a tiny power level is able to severely injure Goku with a tiny laser because Goku's guard was down. This is despite the fact that Goku has been hit off-guard by dozens of FAR stronger attacks and it has been explained that Goku's tremendous Ki protects his body like a force field. The only exception was a non-canon filler episode where Krillen throws a rock at him for the sake of comic relief. (10).\n\nVegeta takes over the fight and kicks Freeza's ass. Vegeta is arrogant and always looking for a challenge, so he will allow a fight to drag on if his opponent promises another transformation or hasn't reached their max power. However, Vegeta has always quickly finished his fights against weaker, unworthy opponents like Freeza in his current state. That is why it makes VERY little sense for Vegeta to give Freeza the time to repeat what he did on Namek and tried to do again against Trunks by blowing the planet and winning via default. Vegeta would have KNOWN that Freeza would try this because Freeza ALWAYS tries this strategy when he starts losing. However, Toriyama wanted to fuck over Vegeta and Freeza wins by blowing up the planet. Whis then pulls some deus ex machina bullshit and sends Goku back in time to just before the planet is destroyed so that Goku can kill Freeza. Why the hell do you hate Vegeta so much Toriyama?! If you didn't like him, you should have killed him off and not made him a main character! (11).\n\nObviously I didn't catch all the countless mistakes, but these were just a few that particularly bothered me either because they derailed a beloved character or completely raped the continuity of the timeline.\n\nArt and Animation:\n\nThe art and animation is actually pretty damn good. The use of CGI was slightly less annoying than in Battle of Gods, and the action was excellent. The well animated fights and big budget blockbuster feel made this movie enjoyable for DBZ fans despite the multitude of plot issues.\n\nMusic:\n\nThe music was honestly pretty good and I liked the inclusion of \"F\" by Maximum the Hormone. It was a nice touch!\n\nOverall:\n\nIs this movie the greatest thing Toriyama has ever produced? Obviously not. However, it was a well animated action fest with some enjoyable fights and a few funny moments. There have been WAY worse DBZ movies that we the fans have had to put up with over the years. If I wasn't a big fan of DBZ I think I would give this a 5 or arguably even a 4, but because I personally enjoyed it a lot, I feel that I have to give up a tad of analytical objectivity and give it a 6. Your mileage may vary.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nAlright, this is my first review on MAL. As a life-long Dragon Ball fan, I was incredibly excited to see this new film. These are my thoughts direction after watching it for the first time...\n\nOverall, the movie was very exciting, anticipating and nostalgic. There are some great moments throughout the film that really make you feel re-connected with some of the greatest Dragon Ball characters ever. Although the production values have exceeded since the 90's, the enjoyment level of any Dragon Ball story has always been consistently high . The improved animation style goes hand-in-hand with the direction that Akira Toriyama is taking this new-age ... saga, and I am enjoying every minute of it.\n\nBuilding on the last movie released \"Battle of Gods\", this new film expands the canon story arc to a whole new level. The time difference between the the two features has seen some exciting new progress for some characters. There is a new standard in power and strength as the threshold of potential is once again raised to new heights. I'm hoping that some future episodes of Dragon Ball Super will elaborate on the details of some awesome new Saiyan transformations.\n\nDefinitely recommend this movie to any and all fans of the Dragon Ball universe. Newbies should steer away as a lot of the already established plot points and character developments would go straight over your head.\n\nAn amazing addition to one of the greatest stories ever told.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nSPOILERS AHOY!\n\nTerrible. That's one way to describe Dragon Ball Z: Fukkatsu no 'F'.\n\nToriyama-sensei took us all by storm when the second most recent movie, 'Dragon Ball Z: Kami to Kami' or 'Battle of Gods' was released. It introduced us to a whole new perspective to the world of Dragon Ball Z, with the addition of a major antagonist, 'The God of Destruction' as he's known, Lord Beerus. Not to mention an all new transformation for our hero Goku known as the 'Super Saiyan God'. As lame as the name sounds, the appearance and the way it came to existence was somewhat similar too. But ... the fact that it was an altogether different entity as it had transcended to the position of a deity made it somewhat believable and cool, and it was also helped by Beerus, a deity himself with interesting characteristics. But this is where it all fails for Fukkatsu no 'F', as there is no originality whatsoever and the main antagonist is Frieza. For god's sake, Frieza. Why did anyone think it'd be a good idea to bring back a popular villain, whose time has long gone from the series, give him an upgraded look and it'd be good to go?\n\nThe resurrection of Frieza itself is a reason as to why the movie sucked, but it had a lot of other inconsistencies as well. First of all, there is no proper world building as the movie starts with a strange scene where little fairies are seen dancing and Frieza's mecha face is seen hanging inside that of a cocoon. The next thing we know is that Frieza's sub-ordinate, Sorbet is plotting to revive Frieza back using the Dragon Balls and is coming in search for it on Earth. He doesn't have to wait long as he just steals them from Pilaf and his gang who apparently have found all seven of the Dragon Balls. Strange enough because the last time I saw them they were at their wits' end rowing a broken boat not knowing where to go, so it makes no sense that they could find all the Dragon Balls scattered around the Earth in such a short period. It doesn't end there, after having all seven Dragon Balls the first thing you'd do is just wake the dragon up and ask for your wish, but no because at the very next moment Pilaf and his gang are visited by Sorbet who comes all the way from outer space to Earth in a moment. Pretty good timing, huh?\n\nSoon enough we have Frieza coming back to life and heading out to face the Z warriors in an instant with all of his army. The motive is lackluster, with Frieza learning how much Goku and others have become stronger, Frieza too heads out to train supposedly for the first time in his life. It all feels too old and bland to believe as the only reasoning given as to why Frieza could be a formidable opponent is that he could awaken his latent power by training. Now there is a hint for this in the previous movie when we see Beerus acting a little surprised when he comes to know of Frieza's defeat by a Saiyan, but it feels funny considering how powerless he's shown in the later arcs of Dragon Ball Z. And all of this works against it when Frieza comes back wanting a fight with the Z warriors. Going by the logic of Dragon Ball Z, it would only seem plausible for Gohan or even for Piccolo to defeat Frieza considering how stronger they have become. But nope, its shown as if Earth is once again facing a huge crisis and we even have Gohan saying that he doubts if he can even become a Super Saiyan, thus totally working against what Dragon Ball Z had established. Things take a turn for the worse when he's taking out in an instant by one hit from Frieza and is on the verge of death. (RIP Gohan, what have you done to his character, Toriyama-san!)\n\nThe buildup is complete for a showdown between Goku and Vegeta who return after training with Whis back to Earth to face Frieza. In a nutshell, the ensuing battle is enjoyable for those who don't care for whats happening and just want to get their ticket's worth, but as for me its meaningless. There are two new transformations to be seen in the movie, with Goku and Vegeta each showing their new Super Saiyan God's Super Saiyan form. (The hair turns all blue basically) and an absurd power increase given to Frieza with his equally absurd Golden Frieza form. There also is no explanation or a buildup as to how Goku and Vegeta have achieved the new form, but I presume that would be later explained in the TV series, Super. (In which I have yet to reach that point on). But as for in the movie, its a negative. It all could've ended well at least with them letting Vegeta call it a day by taking his revenge on Frieza, but that too didn't happen and Goku once again hogged all the glory. In the end it all seemed like it was a test for Goku from Whis who turns back time to give him one more chance to end Frieza for good, which also made the very reason why Frieza was resurrected and his fight against Goku completely pointless.\n\nThere are a lot of good movies in the Dragon Ball Z franchise but none of them till the thirteenth installment were canon. Fukkatsu no 'F' was definitely not one of those good movies and unfortunately it indeed is canon. Dragon Ball Z may have truly hit rock bottom with this one.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 2\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nAre...are you serious? I have a hard time believing that THIS is the return of Dragonball Z's most notable villain and a good majority of the masses are happy with it. Maybe it's because I am long past the point of liking, much less caring about, the Dragonball universe, but I thought Battle of the Gods was pretty damn good, so that left the door open for me to warrant interest in Frieza's return movie. The lesson learned, as far as I know, is if you're going to make a movie where the genesis is a Japanese metal band doing a song about the character, ... you can get away with making it stupid.\n\nSTORY: Generally the story really never matters in these DBZ films, it's not like context of the plot ever has cohesion with the franchises' overly bloated, ridiculous fight scenes after the initial Frieza story arc. So much like almost half of the 15 movies, shadowy bad guys want to use the Dragonballs for some nefarious purpose that never results in them wishing for immortality right off the bat. This group of numbskulls are remnants of Frieza's army. Sorbet, diminutive brownnoser who sounds like Warren Beatty to me. Tagoma, yet another 13th tall, skinny, bald guy, and maybe the others had names, but it seriously isn't important at all.\n\nSo, with this being Frieza's great revenge, I was expecting a great sense of tension throughout the film once he's brought back. And since this is DBZ, we need a built-in excuse why Goku and Vegeta aren't there. Those two are off in Beerus' world, training [WHAT A SHOCKER] with Whis. Fine, whatever, but the path of carnage I was anticipating was instead virtually absent. Earth's forces to stand against the former galactic overlord are Piccolo, a shriveled up Gohan (more on that later), Krillin, a character named Jaco, I assume he's from Cho, which I haven't seen, Bulma, for no discernable reason other than to make my ears bleed, and......Master Roshi...who hasn't done anything useful in Z up to this point. So this standoff is Frieza, allegedly blinded by revenge, coolly sitting off to the side watching the Z Fighter B Team play mop-up duty with generic henchmen. Why not turn it completely into Final Fight and have Krillin kick a garbage can to reveal a health replenishing hamburger?!\n\nThis went on...forever. It's not engaging, not interesting, I DARE even call it pacing. The movie is filibustering itself and were it not for Beerus's existence, this would almost be a complete waste. Whereas Battle of the Gods carried a heavy sense of tension throughout the first act because of the unpredictable danger of the God of Destruction, Resurrection F returns to the repetitive, time padding, empty calories fights that made me sick of DBZ in the first place. This is anime malnutrition. SCORE: 3\n\nART: The production values, animation, and CGI continue to be good to the series as the higher quality images makes the impact and pace of the battles the way they probably wanted them to look 20 years ago. It is very easy on the eyes, but I am not a fan of the new art, it looks very sterile, glossy, and lifeless. Much like how Bulma's character design somehow gets sexier as she ages, everything feels too neat and pristine, like it's afraid to get its nails dirty. And I have a hard time getting over that distracting shine on all the characters' skin, they look like they were marinating in Armor All. When the action picks up, it is visually impressive, but a lot personality is lost in FashionBall Z here. SCORE: 6\n\nSOUND: The FUNimation VA group for the English dub reprise their roles, minus Tiffany Vollmer, as much to my chagrin, Monica Rial is now PermaBulma. Sean Schemmel sounds like the only one who still actually cares, as he's still decent as Goku. Chris Sabat seems to have given up and now just does alternating inflections of Roronoa Zoro for Piccolo and Vegeta. Chris Ayers still sounds like he's channeling Team Four Star Abridged Frieza, but I'm used to it now. If there is one positive about new Dragonball is being done away with the irritating Bruce Faulconer soundtrack. It was cute for a while, but jeezuz, it got repetitive! SCORE: 7\n\nCHARACTERS: What can I say? It's the Z Fighters, they do pretty much the same schtick they've been doing, just slightly subdued. I want Bulma assassinated. I was never a fan of hers and she's all over this movie shrieking like a harpy, so I can only assume this is a rib against me. An even bigger rib is how much Dragonball now seems to go out of its way to make Gohan, the only two dimensional personality, a gigantic dweeb post Mystic Super Saiyan. The biggest thing I like about him is that he DOESN'T follow in his dad's footsteps, does right by his mother's wishes and finishes his schooling, and wants to be a decent father, something he never had. I learned a lot of people hate Gohan for that, then I realized just how out of touch I am. Being a good citizen is now frowned upon? This industry left me in the dust and isn't turning around. I'm sure if I watched Cho, I might Jaco, he seems like a fun enough nonchalant being, which is a healthy break from the knuckleheads. Vegeta, another guy I was never a fan of ever, has become very likeable and funny. Other than that, the original villains don't add a damn thing to this. SCORE: 3\n\nIN CLOSING: To call this a disappointment is an understatement. This is Lord Slug level terrible and the two have a lot in common; wasted characters, nonsensical storytelling, continuity errors that make absolutely no sense upon hearing them, a useless middle portion of the movie, and an anticlimactic resolution that sums up everything I hate about the Dragonball universe!! The writers should've been arrested for the ending to this movie, because they stole 88 minutes I could've used for something productive instead of spending it on this failed attempt to rehash a part of my past. There are good things about it, ut as far as I'm concerned, the bad dreadfully outweighs the good. Resurrection F? Yeah, \"F\" indeed on multiple levels. FINAL SCORE: 3\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI never considered myself to be a huge DBZ fan and it's mainly because I felt the show itself was way too long for its own good. At the same time, it had a nasty habit to regurgitate its formula way too often, and as it went on the villains and even the characters motivations became quite stale. However, there was one character, a villain, that I never seemed to forget and I always regarded him to be my favorite, and that villain was Frieza. As time went on, people simply forgot about him because he wasn't the strongest threat any longer; but what ... made Frieza special to me was his overall connection with the Saiyans. No one terrorized and brought more misery to them than Frieza. He was the ultimate threat especially on a personal level. Dragonball Z: Resurrection F, brings the character back to life, and this was the one DBZ movie I just had to see. For the most part I wasn't disappointed.\n\nThe story begins with Frieza being resurrected by his men with hopes that he would lead them once again. Frieza has something else on his mind and that's revenge against Goku for defeating him and Trunks for killing him. He learns that Goku has gotten much stronger, thus understands fighting him at the moment makes no sense. He then leaves to train on his own and come back stronger.\n\nI have to say that this movie kept me greatly entertained for many reasons. One element that stood out to me immediately was the character designs and animation. There's a fresh, clean like feel to the character designs with everything feeling updated. Characters like Roshi and even Gohan in his silly jumpsuit look strong and confident. Plus I liked the change in outfits for Bulma, and the small details added to Goku's uniform. It all feels up to date and right for this movie.\n\nThe animation is by far a huge step up. The meshing of CG with 2D & 3D graphics was done a lot better this time than the last movie. Characters in the background had some nice life to them and nothing came off awkward. The action was simply amazing as it focused on the characters martial arts backgrounds, this area could have been a whole helluva lot better had more characters taken part in the fighting, but I was still satisfied to see some really quick strikes, strong blows, and various kung-fu styles thrown in with the punches. Even if some one comes away hating this movie for other things; they will have to admit that for a DBZ movie the action is tight. The animation was done really well for the energy blasting spectacles.\n\nDBZ almost always rules with its ear blistering soundtracks. While this movie may not be on par with Cooler's Revenge or Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan. It definitely gets the job done not only bringing life to the action but also to character interactions.\n\nOne last thing that definitely brought a smile to me had to be the focus on Goku and Frieza's rivalry, along with the latter's overall hatred not only for Goku, but also his experience with the Super Saiyan itself. This is where the dialog comes off very strong, as Frieza is truly obsessed by this point, and it puts his blood feud with the Saiyans in perspective; I think this added to the drama a good deal, and the handling of drama is not something DBZ has always been strong on.\n\nI enjoyed this movie a whole lot but I did have to watch it twice because the first viewing left me very uneasy. It just so happened that Akira Toriyama decided to completely ignore previously established story elements that he himself put into play. There are continuity issues in this movie big enough to fit planets through and it's just a shame because the story could have been so much better had everything been told properly. These things also hurt previous character development and lessens them as characters. I mean who would think that Frieza was such a slacker that he never trained? It's hard to buy into that considering how seriously Frieza took himself. I also straight up didn't like the ending, because I'm long tired of Vegeta getting screwed over.\n\nOverall, this is definitely something fans should come into expecting it to be good. The updated animation, action scenes, and focus on the feud of classic characters makes this a DBZ movie that should be seen. I can imagine non DBZ fans getting something out of it as well.\n\nHighs: Action, animation, and characters done well\n\nLows: Complete ignoring of previously established story elements hurts it\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThis movie does NOT continue the story. It sidetracks for the sake of rehashing old plotlines and throwing in even more lazy color-swapping power ups. Because who cares about continuity anymore? It’s about Frieza coming back to life and seeking revenge against Goku. That’s all there is to it, something he already did with his father in the past, as well as what his non-canon brother did in a movie. It’s not like I expect originality out of Dragonball; the damn thing is the monolith of the fighting shonen formulas and it has stuck to it for 30 years. What does annoy me a lot ... though, is how Toriyama screwed up such a simple plot. I mean, this is HIS creation, and he knows how stuff work better than everybody else. And yet here we are with characters acting out of character, and the rules of how the Dragon Balls work changing out of nowhere.\n\nSo ok, some bad guys make a wish to bring Frieza back to life. Why does he come back in pieces? Nobody else had that issue, even back when wishes had far more limitations. And why are all the good guys doing nothing despite sensing Frieza’s aura? I mean, seriously, at this point they can fly anywhere they like in a few seconds, and even a bottom rank fighter like Krilin is around Frieza’s power at this time. So why are they standing still for several minutes when they clearly sense someone summoning the dragon, bringing back a major villain, and then leaving in a spaceship? They were always flying to battle in previous arcs the moment they sensed something was off. They could have sent even a nobody like Yamcha to sneeze on the bad guys before they even made the wish, and the movie would be over in, like, ten minutes.\n\nHell, they could have simply kept all the dragon balls in a secure place, so the bad guys wouldn’t even be able to make the wish in the first place. But no, they just let any random villain to gather them and wish for whatever the heck he wants. Something which is so easy to do these days. Back in the good arcs, it would require months to find them all. Nowadays even a comic relief villain like Pilaf can do that with no problem. Twice. Out of screen. And nobody gives a damn.\n\nAnyways, Frieza is back and he wants to kill Goku, just like every other bad guy wants in this show. But he also needs to get stronger in order to do that, since he became a small fry even back when Goku had yellow hair. Now that he got red hair, Frieza will need to get a new power up that can top even that. And he acquires said power up by… training for a few months. Yeah, that is all it took to get a million times more powerful; he was simply out of shape and needed to get into a fitness program. And he did it out of screen too, because who cares about training sessions anymore? We are all here to see dumb people punching each other.\n\nSo, a few months later, Frieza attacks with a bunch of minions, and we get the typical part where all the non-Saiyans are trying to hold off the bad guys, because Goku is not around to do it himself. In earlier arcs he was too far away, or was still recovering from his injuries, so taking time to get to the battlefield was excused. But no such thing happens this time. He can teleport anywhere he wants in an instant, he is not injured, and has Kaio available to inform him about anything that is going on with telepathy. And yet no such thing happens for several hours. It’s as if everybody forgot how to use their powers all of a sudden.\n\nAnyways, the cannon fodder fights, and as always they are not trying to win, or even to weaken the enemy boss. They are just wasting time, until the only people who matter in this show after Namek arrive (which are Goku and Vegeta, duh). And holy crap, the power levels now make even less sense. Since when are we supposed to believe some of the minions are weak enough for even Muten Roshi to beat, while others are powerful enough to land punches on Picolo and Gohan. What the hell, if such powerful aliens exist, why was Frieza their leader? Or why did they bother to resurrect him, if they already had stronger successors to take over his position? What’s the point?\n\nAfter this completely meaningless battle scene, Goku and Vegeta finally arrive, because Bulma (of all people) bothered to inform them about Frieza. They are cocky enough to fight Frieza one on one, instead of ganging up on him and ending the battle right away. Or, I don’t know, letting Beerus who is even stronger than them to finish him off. Oh right, he is busy eating desserts, what a great character. What, you thought our noble heroes are here to save the Earth, protect their friends, or something trivial like that? Nope, they are here to have fun by punching stuff. And eat pudding.\n\nWhat follows is Frieza revealing his own personal lazy color-swapping power up, followed by Goku doing the same with yet another lazy color-swapping power up. Yellow is so last century, and red just got old last year, so let’s try blue this time. With a wonderful name to go along with it: Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. No, this is not a typo. Then the final battle happens, where Frieza is completely owned despite his fitness program. Do you know how lame it feels to see all this build up amounting to nothing? And they didn’t even fight for a couple of hours like before, it only lasts a few minutes. And it all ends when one weak minions shoots Goku with a simple laser. What the hell is this crap, the guy could survive nuclear explosions before he even had yellow hair, and now that he has blue he gets heavily injured by a pistol? This is bullshit.\n\nBut worry not, since now Vegeta can take on Frieza and prove what an amazing warrior he is by essentially finishing off his half dead opponent. And he fails even at that, losing his chance to take his revenge after all these years, because he was busy laughing at how strong he is, instead of killing Frieza. Frieza takes advantage of that by blowing up the Earth while everybody is busy doing nonsense. By the way, this is something he could have done all along without even having to land on the planet. But of course he didn’t, because if that happened the movie would have ended way too soon.\n\nAnyways, the Earth is destroyed for yet another time and it seems everybody died, but plot convenience says otherwise, since now there is time travel all of a sudden. Goku can go back in time and undo anything that wasn’t done properly, thus having an even easier way to fix any harm the villains caused. Forget the healing beans, the dragon bringing the dead back to life; he can simply load a previous saved file and try again. Hooray for tension!\n\nThus Goku defeats Frieza before he blows up the Earth with his trademarked Kamehameha attack. Something he could have done all along but didn’t. By the way, why isn’t the solar system vaporized if Goku fires energy beams at this level? I mean, even in his initial form Frieza could blow up planets with a finger. How come Earth is not blown apart by Frieza, two God Saiyans, Beerus, and Whis, simply breathing on it? Whatever, power levels are bullshit.\n\nThus ends this completely pointless movie, so we can rewatch it all over again ten times longer and with crappy animation, thanks to Dragon Ball Super. Milking for the win. And who knows, maybe Goku will get purple hair after this arc, and call himself Saiyan God Super God Saiyan Duper Kamehame Saiyan Lucifer Super.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nDragon ball z revival of f left me very conflicted while i enjoyed the fantastic art and action the story was lacking and had several major issues.The story is definitely not anything spectacular or complex dragon ball z has always been simple and easy to understand so i didn't expect that here however it had major issues that i had gripes with.There are 3 types of dragon ball z fans those who like the original dragon ball more for the comedy and adventure and don't mind and enjoy slice of life moments and then you have those who liked dragon ball z more for the ... action and then those in between who like both the slice of life stuff and action.Dragon ball z battle of gods from a story stand point was leaps and bounds better than revival of f however it lack action which revival delivers on to the fullest.Which is the better movie depends on whether you like dialogue and story more or seemingly mindless action.\n\nStory 7: The story for revival of f is simple,freeza is revived and wants revenge on those who led to his demise,goku and trunks.He goes to earth and a epic battle insures.That is all there is to this movie its simple and easy to predict.That is how dragon ball has always been and the reason why it is so popular because anyone of any age can easily understand the story.The story however had issues the thought of freeza even remotely been a threat to the z warriors at this point in time is ridiculous, the gap between freeza and buu is enormous and now that goku has god like power it is even more ludicrous that freeza could even be goku`s equal.The ending was also lack luster.Freeza was one of the most feared individual in the universe but in this movie he provided no real threat to the z warriors and as we all could expect didn't leave any real damage.This movie is indeed fan service for long time fans, to give us something to enjoy by bringing back arguable the most iconic dragon ball z villain and put him up against goku in an epic revenge rematch battle so in that perspective i guess the issues of the story can be looked past because the story was never meant to be the major aspect of this movie but it is the action instead.The fights didn't have much tension and seem like this was a training session for goku and vegeta and not a fight for their and the earths survival .\n\nArt 9: This movie is the best looking dragon ball z movie or any dragon ball z material to date, everything looked crisp and fluent.The action scenes were fantastic combined the good old fashion dragon ball z actions scenes with the blurred lines with the new animation cgi which weren't really an issue it didn't look bad.\n\nSound 7: The sound in revival of f felt a little lack luster, there were only like 3 or 4 sounds in the entire film and there were scenes that i felt needed music however for what was played was good.\n\nCharacter 8: The characters were great a meld of the old dragon ball z cast with the new characters such as beerus,whis and jaco.The new characters made the movie more enjoyable with their interactions with each other beerus and whis still being beerus and whis with their interactions of food which are fun to watch.Jaco an instant hit character being a very interesting character to see being comedy relief and a very awesome character.In this movie goku actually got some character development,goku is that guy that always wants to fight and face new obstacles and he doesn't differentiate between good and evil meaning even if you are evil he would still give you a second chance to live so you can come back and fight him again because goku loves fighting but that kind of pure hearted desire for a new challenge is naive and often puts himself and those he loves in danger and the events in this movie led him to realize that and show him that he shouldn't let evil get a second chance and put others in danger.Goku believes too much in his own power and because of that tends to let his guard down because he sure in himself.Goku wasn't always like this i think its the super sayain power going to his head every since he became a super sayain and obtained that level of power with each gain in power he got more and more over confident case in point majin buu said he could defeat him as a super sayain 3 but didn't because he was so sure of himself and wanted the kids to do it. He was humbled in battle of gods by beerus by seeing that there are many others out there who he cant beat however goku being goku and always striving towards new power getting god like power it again has gone to his head and again but now he learned of the consequences of his actions and resolved himself to not let it happen again.\n\nEnjoyment 8: This was a very enjoyable movie that had its comedic moments but was action packed from start to finish. I enjoyed every single minute of it, it had a lot of issues however looking past those this was really enjoyable for long time dragon ball z fans.\n\nOverall 8: This was a very good dragon ball z movie that had its issues however if the obvious inconsistencies and plot holes are ignored it was a really good action packed movie.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThis movie can only survive off of DBZ nostalgia. If you spend time analyzing this movie you will scream to yourself WTF ?. Nothing makes sense in this movie and the plot is just a cheap attempt at capitalizing on a known villain. A new unexplained transformation used as a cash cow to piece together a quick to grasp story.\n\nThe visuals and sound are top notch, but the fights are lacking even for DBZ standards. The visuals actually take a slight hit due to the interjection of computer graphics at random parts of fights (Which noone ever likes).\n\nChances are you will enjoy this movie ... for what it is, but that's with your rose colored glasses. I can't get into the issues with the movie without spoiling it, just know very little is going to be cohesive and non of it will add any value to the universe.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nWarning: This review can contain spoilers. Read only by your own risk.\n\nDragon Ball blasted this year, with a new movie, a new anime series and officially declared May 9th as Goku Day. But we came to talk about the movie.\n\nI'll start by saying this: I liked the film... until the part where the beatings begun, there after the movie was falling to my taste so much that came to my mind the idea better get out of the theater.\n\nBut before dwelling on this boredom that caused me the film, I will say what I liked:\n\n-Art: 8.\n\nThe animation of Battle of the Gods was very ... good, but still could not help feeling that there was \"something\" that did not fit the picture. Now in F, animators greatly improved animation, for example, in the last film was little hair thing organic Goku not sit here.\n\n-Story 5.\n\nActually, seeing the synopsis briefly were giving, were some things that left a bad taste, but since seeing the film, I thought some of them were well excused and doesn't left you with the idea that Toriyama had forgotten his own canon. But beware, they maybe covered the issues that concerned me before seeing the film, but does not mean they have committed other horrors that I will explain later.\n\nAnyway, now it comes what I did not like.\n\n-Sound: 5.\n\nAt first, the music. I don't mean that it is bad, it is non-existent! The music was not heard, and you had to distract a bit from the movie to see if you heard something. Throughout the film I heard only two songs, and one of those was the theme of the movie who kept shouting \"Frieza! Frieza!\" like twenty times in the chorus (which by the way is not nearly as good as Hero FLOW).\n\n-Character: 4.\n\nAnother thing I did not like was the choice of the leading cast to fight Frieza. I understand that 18 has been stayed home to care for her daughter, I applaud that also the fact that Chaos and Yamcha to stay hidden out there to not be killed and a new meme of Dragon Ball.\n\n\"Hey Yamcha, have you seen...?\"\n\n[Insert here Yamcha Death Meme]\n\n\"What?! But if we're not even fighting!\"\n\nBut what the hell, Toriyama?! What are Roshi and Ten Shin Han doing there?! Roshi stopped being support since the saga of Piccolo and Ten Shin Han two after, when Nappa used him as mop.\n\nThe next downside is that this film use information that it's not on the series or films. At the start of the frame we see Jako the Galactic Patrolman.\n\nNow, I'm sure everyone here knows that Jako is the protagonist of a proto pseudo-prequel manga Dragon Ball. The problem here is that many of those who watched Dragon Ball did not read that manga, so when Jako appeared and mentioned Bulma's sister ... not only the children said What? But also many of the adults who accompanied them.\n\nThe problem with Jako is that it is just a meaningless pretext to warn the appearance of Frieza, when that same role it could have made any character that can detect the ki, because when Frieza went to Earth for the first time and Future Trunks kicked his ass, all the warriors could even feel it even when I was still far away. As someone said: \"The reference is only good if everyone understands\", and outside of Japan I think the vast majority did not understand the reference that Toriyama put.\n\n-Enjoyment: 4.\n\nBut ... this is Dragon Ball, and as such you can not ask for a perfect and error-free argument. Dragon Ball needs only two things to be good: good comedy and good fights, and the film complies with that in the first half of the film, good comedy and the action sequence of the few Z warriors gathered against Frieza's eight thousand troops is great, but when Goku and Frieza show stellar transformations of the film, the thing starts to stink.\n\nI have no complaint about Golden Frieza, Toriyama knows explain it without sounding ridiculous. What was a complete stupidity was that of ...\n\n\"I am a Saiyan God who became Super Saiyan\"\n\n¡Tori! Really there was no need to create a transformation for the transformation of the last film, which incidentally the transformation is useless because Beerus defeated it in a matter of seconds.\n\nIt would have been Goku this time could control the Divine Ki, as far as I was, in the last film he did not control and therefore Beerus managed to use him as mop, so Goku could demonstrate the power of this transformation he could not in the last film could have been a good reason. This new transformation seemed no more an excuse to sell more toys and DLCs in videogames. Tori, I never thought you'd fall so low to the point doing pure nonsense with your franchise as Kuramada just to make easy money.\n\nAfter the bad shot of the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan is passed, one would say \"well, at least now the fight will be good\". Nope. The fight is boring. In Dragon Ball Z and movies of this, we know that Goku (or whoever the protagonist) will win, but when it comes time, the enemy is infinitely more powerful than our hero and that's exciting to see when Goku can finally win. Here throughout the fight I kept saying \"No, Frieza will not defeat Goku\".\n\nThe height of the ridiculous is the way that Frieza takes advantage in the fight against Goku ... making one of his minions to shoot him in the back with a laser gun! I need to say how ridiculous was that? If it had happened when Goku was in normal mode it would have been passable, but they shoot when in Full Power Mode, when that transformation has endured more powerful attacks coming from Frieza in Full Power Mode.\n\nIn the last film we had people complaining about how ridiculous it was Vegeta singing in an attempt to calm Beerus, well, now where's those same people complaining that according to Toriyama, to beat Goku only takes a pistol and grab him neglected even though is at its most powerful transformation?\n\nAnd I don't want to continue with what follows: A Deus Ex Machina shoehorned only to rob Vegeta's glorious moment, that when he finally is going to fuck the motherfucker that made him miserable his childhood just after Vegeta has saved Goku. Tori seriously, do not do that, do not create a badass moment which justifies have held half an hour of crap, and then you wash your ass in the last three minutes with it (literally).\n\n-Overall: 4\n\nIn short, what is my final verdict on the film? This: it is a typical movie Dragon Ball Z added nothing to the plot (which has been forged since the previous film) and it was only fan service for those who do not like the previous film under the guise of \"is a lot of comedy and nothing of Dragon Ball\".\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nAllow me to preface that I am the biggest Dragon Ball fan out there. Since I first followed the series in 1999, Dragon Ball has inspired me in ways subtle and great, from fitness to creativity. Of all the anime series I have seen, none inspires me to be a better version of myself than Dragon Ball, as hyperbolic (lol) as that might sound. That being said, I am now going to argue why this film is one of the worst entries in the franchise, on the same level as the first half of GT and Bio-Broly. I do not enjoy trashing other people's works ... or writing negative reviews, but I was uniquely disappointed by this film.\n\nFrom the start, the premise is already rote and uninteresting. I suppose on some level it is dramatically ironic to see a villain return from the dead as the heroes have so many times before, but we must keep in mind the timing of this film's release. Dragon Ball Super had not yet aired, and Battle of Gods left us with many fascinating plot threads to explore in the form of the twelve universes, the relationship of the Kaioshin to the Hakaishin, and the past history of the first Super Saiyan God. Instead we get this cynical, financially motivated exploiting of the franchise's most popular villain. Frieza's character arc, as well as his personal conflicts with Goku and Vegeta, were handled fantastically in the Namek saga, and many argue that was the series' finest story arc. We did not need to return to this well-worn ground. And to have the whole film focus on this fight, when we know Frieza will just fail again is really disappointing.\n\nThe explanation for Frieza's newfound powers is offensively idiotic. Dragon Ball and DBZ had really solid power scaling and the various foes the Z-Fighters faced escalated in a plausible way. First Goku faces other martial artists, then an army, then lesser demons, then aliens, then cyborgs/androids, then an ancient genie, and now he finds himself sparring with gods. Retreading Frieza breaks the series' themes of constant self-betterment and and escalation. And to have Frieza gain godlike power over four months of training is ridiculous. Furthermore, Golden Frieza is a truly hideous and garish design - perhaps that was the point, but even still it reminds me of a basketball mascot. Go Lakers!\n\nI feel much the same about Super Saiyan Blue, which was a wise revision from the original name of Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (SSGSS). Just LOL. But really the form is literally a recolor of the iconic golden-haired Super Saiyan form and nothing else. The fan designs for Super Saiyan 5 are far better than this, undeniably. It is cool to see Goku and Vegeta on the same level of power though. I also liked Goku and Vegeta's new costumes in this movie. Black Saiyan armor suits Vegeta well, and Goku's new gi reminds me of his gi from the end of Z, only orange.\n\nThe fights were displeasing. I really wished they stuck with two-dimensional animation, the interplay of 3-D stuff with 2-D made the choreography a bit strange for sure. If you're not sure what I mean, compare the fights in this movie with the battles from the earlier DBZ films like Tree of Might or Dead Zone. This certainly does compare to the franchise's heights. There is no grace or technique to the battles, this is rock-em sock-em robots. I know this could have been done better.\n\nAlso, there is a huge problem in the presence of Beerus and Whis. Regardless of your feelings on the two characters, their presence dramatically reduces the tension of this battle to the point of farce. Beerus and Whis are still leagues beyond Goku and Vegeta, and could one-shot Frieza if the whim occurred to them. Imagine if during the first Broly movie two all-powerful bystanders stood around and made jokes about ice cream while the Z-fighters were getting their asses kicked. How absurd.\n\nThe ending is a pileup of puzzling decisions. Goku is pierced by a laser gun while he is in Super Saiyan Blue. Goku's destructive capability in this form is many times universal judging by his feats in the fight with Beerus, and we know that ki boosts durability as well as power. The idea that a seasoned fighter like Goku would let his guard down to this degree is almost character assassination. It is hard to imagine liking Goku as a character and also agreeing with this decision, because this makes him look like a true clown, rather than a martial artist. Vegeta is teased with the idea of personally executing the man who personally carried out the genocide of his people and enslaved him for 20 years, and of course he is denied this. Frieza somehow manages to destroy the planet while Vegeta has an energy blast readied at point-blank range, but this is undone with TIME TRAVEL of all things, courtesy of Whis, who is nothing more than a plot device. They go back in time so that Goku can swoop in and steal the kill from Vegeta. Obviously this is not dramatically satisfying at all - Frieza was not defeated by the strength and cunning of Goku and Vegeta, who both look like ridiculous fools in this movie. He was beaten by literal time travel hax. I apologize for summarizing, but putting these plot points in writing can perhaps help communicate my frustration.\n\nIn summary, nothing in this film has any consequences and can be skipped. Of course, Frieza returns later on in Dragon Ball Super, and Super Saiyan Blue is used a lot in the future arcs, but this film is not necessary for the viewer to understand those particular points. This entire story is creatively bankrupt and is a blight on the Dragon Ball franchise.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nAs DRAGON BALL Z: BATTLE OF THE GODS proved nostalgic, so too did DRAGON BALL Z: RESURRECTION OF F, and even more so for us that grew up watching Frieza fight Goku and then again another battle including future Trunks. The film does employ comedy and a sense of homeliness like the prequel, as it includes each of the characters we're all so familiar, all cozied up and assimilated into everyday life, right where we left them in Dragon Ball Z. Gohan has grown up and made himself comfortable as a family man and a geek. He's unsure if he can even still turn super ... saiyan, as has been focusing on being a father and a husband. Master Roshi returns to the platform in his Dragon Ball skin, with skill and a functioning role beyond just being funny, though he is still hilarious. Do you think we can beat them? he asks. When no is the answer, he says, 'good, I just wanted ot be sure I wasn't being a chicken.' He even throws in a kamehame wave. Krillin becomes a cop, and it is funnier than anything, as it is perfect for him. With the Z fighters, he is bottom of the best. As a cop, he is a top dog.\n\nThe film has a bit more plot than DRAGON BALL Z: BATTLE OF THE GODS, considering that film was just sort of there to set up a premiss for Dragon Ball Super and this sequel film. Frieza comes back, and he has been reconstructed. Brought back by the dragon balls, and put together again (he was cut into pieces by future Trunks in Dragon Ball Z) with a new machine constructed by the Frieza Force. He's cocky, upset that it took so long, and he had to sit and wait, tormented in Earth's hell. He wants to enact his revenge against Goku, but know that Goku has trained, and he must too train, for his first time even. He had never trained a day in his life, and was still so powerful... imagine what he could become and what would happen to his strength and ability if he were to actually work at it? He trains for a few months and jets himself to Earth, destroying a city as his 'hello.' Bulma calls for Goku and Vegeta to return to Earth after being informed by Jaco, a cute little space cop with a contagious voice. Goku and Vegeta have been training at Beerus' place and do not hear of the Frieza attack until Gohan, Piccalo, Krillin, having shaved his head... wonderful, really! hah, Jaco, Master Roshi, and Tien are deep in battle fighting members of the Frieza force. Once they do hear, Goku has the fighters power up, he locks on, and uses instant transmission, bringing Vegeta along with him.\n\nThey fight, and overall, the fighting is great, and it is not sloppy and just 'fighting,' but they actually employ actual martial arts. They use wing chun, and block punches and kicks and blows. The only complain I have here is the obvious CGI. Maybe it was necessary. I don't know. I think though, it wsa quicker, and it was cheaper too, so that is why the CGI was put into place, but it looks bad, and it looks out of place and awkward.\n\nThe end of the movie, Goku looks beat. He's turned super saiyan god, like in the first, and so too has Vegeta. The ending is a bit cheap. I don't want to say too much, though you'll probably see it from a m ile away, as did I , and everybody else, but it involve time travel, and everybody ends up A-OK. It is by no means a great movie, but fun and well made for any fan of Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, or maybe even Dragon Ball GT.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nOh boy, when I first saw the announcements on YouTube about this movie, I already had a bad feeling about it. Now look, its been a long time but I've been a huge fan of the Dragonball franchise (and a Frieza fanboy) since I was young, which is why I was asking myself why would Toei make this movie to begin with if they were going to kill my favorite character of the franchise again?\n\nHowever months passed and the movie got released on cinema when I was temporarily living in Argentina back in 2015, so I decided to give it a chance just for the ... sake of curiosity. Pretty much all my worries were confirmed to say the least. I could go into more detail but I will just mention here the parts that really irritated me:\n\n-During the fight against Frieza's army, Piccolo somehow struggles against a fodder footsoldier, and they have Gohan go Super Saiyan in order to beat him instead. Bullshit!\n\n-There is no tention in the entire fight considering that Frieza gets murked by base Goku and even more despite achieving the Golden Form.\n\n-Goku turns into Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan with blue hair, only to get one-shotted in the heart by a laser beam from Sorbet's ring, after beating Frieza. Bullshit and hilarious in a \"so bad its good\" way.\n\n-Frieza basically destroys Earth and kills everyone, except for the Z warriors which get teleported by Whis just in time. Then they decide to time-travel back in order for Goku to kill Frieza with a Kamehameha. Bullshit. This has to be the most underwhelming and insulting ending in the entire franchise which gets resolved in less than 2 minutes and it all ends with Goku laughing like an idiot like nothing ever happened.\n\nThis movie was pointless, it added nothing to the story except for 2 new power-ups. Goku acts like a confident dumbass for the entirety of the movie despite the fact that he gets called out for it. A classic villain like Frieza gets treated like a joke and killed off again. Frieza eventually returns again in Super where he gets his time to shine mind you, but makes you wonder what was the point of doing this movie? If they wanted to make Frieza relevant, they could've easily brought him back directly in Super and reveal him training with other villains in Hell, rather than having him sticked in a cocoon for cheap-comedy. Its quite dissapointing that many fans were so driven by the hype that they gave the film a higher score in many sites than it deserved.\n\nAny good stuff?\n\nRoshi fighting again onscreen (I can appreciate that)\n\nThe Golden form, I suppose it was cool for a power-up although I still prefer the design that Cooler had in his final form.\n\nThe scene were Krilin has \"We Are\" from One Piece as ringtone.\n\nFrieza one-shotting nerd Gohan in his base form (hilarious karma for that scene in the Fusion Reborn movie)\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nBefore condemning me for not mindlessly praising DBZ Movie 15, Revival of F, you should know that I am one of the biggest Dragon Ball fanboys out there. I've read the manga, watched DB,DBZ,DBGT, movies, specials, etc. Dragon Ball has had a ton of impact on my life and sadly, if I had to describe DBZ Movie 15 in one word, I would use disappointment.\n\nMy disappointment for the movie stems not from a case of overHYPE but rather from something much different. After all the anime and shounen I've watched over the years, what makes Dragon Ball so special? It's certainly not the fight scenes ... or the over the top transformations and power ups, that's for sure. It's the emotion. The feeling of desperation when the planet is going to blow in 5 minutes. The feeling of despair as Gohan watches Cell kill his friends and family. The feeling of hope as Goku descends to defeat the Saiyans. The feeling of weakness as Vegeta discovers how weak he truly is. These feelings are what makes Dragon Ball, and these feelings are what the new movie lacks.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nTHE LACK OF EMOTION\n\nNow let's see why the new movie is lacking in the emotion department directly. A new transformation is fine and all but it just kinda happened. Super Cyan was just there as a means to show that Goku/Vegeta had reached a new level of power. But did you feel the desperation that came from SSJ1. The loss that caused SSJ2? Even the sheer epicness of SSJ3? How about the need for SSJG in Battle of the Gods? Nope, Goku/Vegeta just casually transform into the strongest power up, no biggie.\n\nThe need to defeat Frieza didn't even feel like it was there. As it is, the DB universe is filled with too many failsafes. Dragonballs overcoming death, and now, even time is a crutch when they screw up. This leads to the feeling that you don't actually NEED to defeat Frieza. Even with his power up, the fight seemed pretty anticlimatic, he didn't really have either of them on the ropes.\n\n\"Power comes in response to a need not a desire, you have to create that need\" - Goku\n\nThe need for a new SSJ transformation was never really there. I guess it was sorta there for Frieza to become stronger but it was never really elaborated on.\n\nThe lack of emotion in the new movie really got to me but I suppose I should talk about the other parts of the movie as well...\n\nUNNECESSARY FANSERVICE\n\nIt's cool and all that they brought back some Z fighters and even had a cameo with Jaco the Galactic Patrolman but I felt like it was a little unnecessary. This kinda plays in with the emotion thing. The fact that the only reason they are there is for the sake of fan service, bothers me. As stated by Frieza, Gohan alone could easily take out all of the Frieza forces alone. So why doesn't he? Fanservice.\n\nPLOT INCONSISTENCIES\n\nWhy is Master Roshi able to fight on par against opponents that Gohan/Piccolo are fighting? Why is a railgun able to almost kill a Super Cyan God, a being that could go toe to toe with a being that could destroy planets with a yawn? Why does Frieza stop trying to blow up the Earth when Goku approaches him with a Kamehameha? These are the questions. Yeah, I know that DBZ has a ton of plot holes but come on, these are really stretching it. Are railguns the new Kryptonite?\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nWell the art style is pretty polished and the sound reminds of the good ol nostalgic dragonball days. I thought the idea was great with Frieza, the original universe conquerer coming back for vengeance was great. After that, I'm running out of good things to say about the movie.\n\nTHE REST\n\nDragon Ball has never been a super serious anime, but at the very least, it was serious when it needed to be. Now, it feels like the whole thing has become a complete joke.\n\nI have a feeling that people only liked the new DBZ Movie for the sake of it being a new DBZ Movie. As in, imagine if the movie wasn't DBZ, would you still like it? Do you like it because it's good or just because you're Dragonball starved and want new content/want to feel nostalgic? Hopefully, Dragonball Super can pick up the slack with it's adaption of the movie.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\n*Review will be edited... eventually.*\n\nI'm really getting sick of this! No, seriously, I really am! I'm supposed to be out there, watching something... anything else, but this! It would... if just once in a while, to watch some actually good, well-made anime, and write actually positive review about it! And what do I do instead?! Listen to some doucheback-fan of mine, who once asked me to watch, and review this piece of trash - obviously even my fans hate me! - and offer thy my sweet, delicate ass, to the herds of butthurt fanboys, who will undoubtedly tear me right open for stuffing, for ever ... even laying my finger on their precious franchise! But, since I seem to live and breath from pain, I may as well go all out with it!\n\nThe \"Asspull of Epic Proportions\" staring this time with Frieza, as a Golden Showertoy, and Carrot cake as a Blue God of Merchandicing, featuring all of those, that used to to jack-shit before, staring behind the curtains and serving ice cream to that purple Cat-thing, from the previous movie. Frieza wants to play, and Carrot's ready and loaded for use - three hours tops, watch for over-heating! Once again it's just \"so cool\" to see these stupid idiots risking their life and limb for a conflict, that could've easily just been wished away, and since Veggie-ape is still so popular with the fans, he's somehow allowed to also have this ridicculous blue hair dye... which is exactly the same plotpoint that happened to him twise before, since Toriyama can't keep this guy freaking dead! Once again, stupidity takes place, and look at that... everyone's dead! But donät worry, kiddies! Deux Ex Machina happens, and all is well again. Tune in next time, when fans of the show tell Toriyama, how they want their favourite apes be turned into Super Saiyan Super Dragon Titan Super God Super Saiyan XVII, Trunks finds out he's really a she, and how Piccolo and Gohan finally have a baby together!\n\nThere, I did it! Can I now have my flask back, please?!\n\nMy thoughtprosses, while watching this movie, was pretty much summed up as such; \"Oh, those guys, that should've been dead since the first arc of DBZ are still here - cool... meatsheald! It's not like they're here for any other reason, than just some cheap fan-service, and some extra minutes! And looky that! The only reasonable, honorable, and downright respectable example for a hero - goes by name Gohan - that this franchise has to offer, is now not only smaller in size, but also with a character, and purpose! Sucks to be upworthy model citizen, husband and father, right - Lord knows, the world hates those! And who's our villain, then? That albino, psychotic manchild/transexual albino lizard, whos been dead once, brought back as a sexmachine, killed like a runaway-joke, and now resurrected - as a title says! - a golden... powertool? What a ripoff! And what does he want this time? A revenge, from the Jaws 3 - sure... shocker. And oh how nice - the purple cat-thing, and his flamboyant chambermaid are here too... to eat ice cream, and clean the mess up, after our heroes have - yet again - failed and killed us all, or worse! Truly, these two are perfect for the cause, so that rest of our useless crew, can just sit back, an tremble and lament upon their utter uselesness, like a heroes they undoubtedly are - better stay dead, if you're just gonna get in a way, dumbasses! And oh, what did I know - the world exploded... again! We're all dead... again! Well, that's not so bad - Boo did it already, and Cell truly tried, so... no biggy! Let's just turn back in time, and fuck around some more with our useless villain, and our clearly homocidal sosiopaths/psychotic idiots... no sorry, heroes, to give our fans some more pics to wank on us!\"\n\nIf you can't tell by that alone, I was in pain.\n\nAs always - as expected, from this franchise - there's no plot, no expansion of the characters but quite the opposite, no subtlety, paperthin-as-always story with no urgency, or interesting ideas - rock 'em sock 'em- robots, flying through the air while flailing at eachoter, and trashtalking stupid pointless shit, to give the movie some more extra minutes... truly fascinating! - shallow premise with no stakes or consequenses, via everlasting deux ex machinas, and overall pointlesness all over the place, that it's almost hard to believe, that this is actually a movie, and not some 15-minutes- long special!\n\nSeriously... I can't believe that I'm saying this, but while I suffered my way through DBZ... Freiza was my hero! He killed the saiyans, he killed Vegeta, and he killed the spare - so to say - of the cast, that in time, turned out to be just ultimately and completely useless, in this super saiyan-wankfest, thus giving Krillin the heroic death he deserved, and Vegeta the ending, he at least deserved! He was a hero, and a liberator! And what'd they do to him?! Made him this money-milking hooker/dumbass villain, from every american horror-movie ever made, that gets killed every single title he's in, but just keeps coming back for more, for sequels - next time, I bet he's gonna get a free sundae, too! And just to keep his rotting carcass fresh, we give him a new paintjob, every time when Toriyama needs some more weed-money... which's about every three-four movies, for now on, I presume!\n\nWell, shit... welcome to the pokemon-ship, you guys - this ship ain't gonna see some land, nor fresh new skanks in a long time, so better make away now with what you can! Re-using villains, and plotpoints like this, may indeed work for the franchise, that doesn't even want to try, and for the fans, who'lll loyally take everything it has to offer, with no thought, nor meaning, but it sure as Hell, does not work, for me!\n\nThis movie, is a unneeded sequal to an already unneeded movie, based on yet again nothing but fanfiction, and fan-service - without boobs, of course, because... adults hate those! - living and surviving on a life-support, called nostalgia, thus only excisting to squeese out every little bit out of that sweet, juicy carcass of a big, fat monster, that's this franchises fanbase, to make their wettest fantasies, and most loosest of dollars, to get some wings, following that same shallow, meaningless and utterly ridiculous \"power porn\"-theme, that plagued the last movie... only in this version, played only for shits and giggles, like a joke this movie as a whole, really and truly is. The last two character in a whole franchise, that ever mattered, and will ever matter worth a shit, are now both closest to be called gods, for the sake of tomfoolery - how much more privileged these saiyans really need to get?! - and those who aren't - those poor, unlucky bastards with lives, families, and totally wrong, unprivileged plot-genes - are either jokes, or less than that... which I can't seem to find proper words to describe them to! This \"porn\", is like a kind of hentai, that's all filtered, and blackboxed all over the place to the point of turmoil, with endless loopanimation and halfassed voices, that it's no longer proper to call it even a porn anymore! There's only so much wanking, that you can do, to the same kind of porn, before it starts to both feel, and taste like a sour shit, and surely, this franchise, has a long time ago hit it's lowest low, still not knowing, when to end. It has absolutely nothing more, or anything else to offer, yet it just keeps coming back for more... like a horny teenage boy, who just can't take \"no\" for a answer.\n\nSomeone needs to take their hands out of their pants, and stop giving Toriyama all this money, to make these movies, so he can't waste any more ink, and trees, to make paper for this shit! Not watching this movie - if you're not already been subdued to it's toxic influence - is the same as saving dozen panda cubs, from starvation, and every time, you wank away any more money out of your pants, for this franchise... the panda cub will die!\n\nStory: 1\n\nArt: 4\n\nSound: 3\n\nCharacters: 2\n\nEnjoyment: 1\n\nOverall: 1\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 1\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI am a long time Dragonball fan since 2008 and this is without a doubt the WORST Dragonball movie that I have ever seen. Yes it is worse than Battle of Gods and yes it is even worse than Dragonball Evolution because at least Evolution has character growth which this film seems to lack. No joke I actually had to pause the movie a couple of times due to utter frustration and or disappointment.\n\nThe animation in this movie is painfully average, seeming more like a direct to television movie rather than a theatrical release film. Also it has way too much CGI where it is ... distracting. They couldn't even animate Goku and Frieza fighting half the time.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 1\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all"
