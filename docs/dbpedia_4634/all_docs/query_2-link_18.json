        "text": "The Vegeta/Raditz Series\n\nGokou has a reunion with his friends and introduces them to Gohan, his five year old son. However, a Saiyan alien lands on Earth and to seek Gokou. He introduces himself as Radditz, Gokou's older brother, and asks Gokou to join him in the Saiyan quest of universal destruction. But, when Gokou refuses, Radditz kidnaps Gohan to blackmails Gokou to kill innocent civilians. However, Gokou remains loyal to Earth and decides to rescue Gohan through another method-- by killing Raditz! Surprisingly, Piccolo allies with Gokou and the first fight of Dragonball Z began. Piccolo decides to gather energy to do a super fireball on Radditz. Meanwhile, Gokou stalls time. At the end, Gokou puts his brother in a hold. At the advantage, Piccolo unleashes his fireball, which blasts and hits both Gokou and Radditz! Krillin finds the fighters and laughs at the dying Raditz as he mocks him that Gokou will be brought back to life through the power of the Dragonballs. Gokou's brother replies that the device he uses to detect energy levels can also be used for communication. He sends the news about the Dragonballs to his two comrades, and dies. Because Piccolo discovered that Gohan had hidden powers when Gohan unknowingly headbutts and damages Radditz, he kidnaps Gohan in an attempt to train him. Gokou, rather than retiring in Heaven, is sent on a quest to run on Snake Way and to seek King Kaiou to receive training for the upcoming fight with the upcoming Saiyans. The rest of the Z warriors (Krillin, Yamcha, Tenshin-han, and Chauzu) are gathered to receive special training from Kami. Season #1 of Dragonball Z on American television ends here. One year later, Nappa and Vegeta (the evil Saiyans) arrive to Earth. (But, they intend to find the Dragonballs to be granted the wish of immortality rather that to bring back the life of their unworthy comrade.) First come the battle against the Saiba-men (little Green monsters) that Nappa planted. The Saiba-men fight, but are eventually killed by Vegeta and Klilyn. (At one of these fights, Yamcha is killed.) After their defeat, our heroes fight Nappa; Vegeta stands in the background and watches. In a series of battles, Chauzu dies as he sacrifices himself in an attempt to blow up Nappa; Tenshin-han dies by using up his strength to try to kill Nappa; Piccolo dies when he covers Gohan from Nappa's fireball. Finally, Gokou arrives and easily defeats Nappa. Vegeta sees Nappa's uselessness and kills him with a single fireball. As you all can guess, the remaining Z warriors begin to fight Vegeta. Gokou begins to fight Vegeta. The odds are against Vegeta, so Vegeta creates a energy ball that substitutes the moon. Then, he turns into his full moon stage and turns into a giant gorilla. Our heroes get kicked around, but Vegeta later gets his tail cut off by Yajirobe. Gokou donates energy from his Tenki-Dama to Klilyn. This fireball hits Vegeta, but Vegeta survives. Meanwhile, Gohan's tail grows back. Gohan turns into his full moon stage and kicks Vegeta around. Later, Gohan gets his tail cut off by Vegeta and finally turns back into a little boy... landing right on top of Vegeta. Vegeta, weary and defeated, crawls to his space shuttle and leaves Earth. This is not the end of Vegeta...\n\nFreeza Series\n\nYes, Dragonball Z returns in another season after the fight against Vegeta. This series helped improve Dragonball Z a lot because it is here that we are introduced to the Saiyans' ability to turn \"Super Saiyan.\" (This series is twice as long as the Vegeta Series!) Freeza, who destroyed the Saiya planet in the battle with Bardock (Gokou's father) is in search of the Dragonballs to become immortal. The Z Warriors discover about Freeza's plot to conquer the universe and travel to space to stop Freeza and his minions. Vegeta joins the surviving Z Warriors, but only to insure that Gokou survives the battle so that he could kill him personally. (However, Vegeta ends up marrying Bulma, and Bulma is now pregnant with Trunks.) Everyone was killed in the battle against Vegeta except for Gokou, Gohan, Klilyn, and Yajirobe. Piccolo died protecting Gohan, so the Dragonballs of Earth vanished. Without the Dragonballs, Kami dies as well. Bulma later discovers that there are Dragonballs in the planet Namek (Piccolo's home planet), but it would take thousands of years to travel there. Then, Tao Pai-Pai appears and tells about the ship that Piccolo and Kami took to travel to Earth. With a faster spaceship, our heroes reach Namek and encounter Freeza. Next, and throughout the rest of this series, the Z Warriors fight against Freeza. Freeza had called on Team Ginew to fight the Z warriors, but Team Ginew was killed by Vegeta (except for Ginyu, who accidently turned into a frog when he tried to swap bodies with Vegeta and Gokou threw a frog in his path). These battles go on episode after episode... On one battle, Gokou gets angry enough (when Krillin gets killed) and reaches Super Saiyan level for the first time. (This is when the golden hair comes in.) He finishes Freeza off (as well as destroy Freeza's planet) with a single blast, and Freeza learns about the true powers behind a Super Saiyan. Afterwards, Gokou escapes to planet Yardrat, where he learns the ability to teleport. Freeza's father, Cold, later learns about Freeza's defeat and quickly gathers Freeza's body parts, which are floating around in space. His henchmen re-ensemble Freeza. (This is why Freeza was half robotic.) Freeza tells his father about Gokou and his powers, but his father believes that he is the universe's strongest warrior and doesn't believe him. (These villians are space conquerers.) Freeza, his father, and his crew land on earth to seek revenge on the Z Warriors, as well as destroy Earth on the way. But all of a sudden, a figure comes out of nowhere and adult Trunks appears. He turns into his Super Saiyan level and aids the Z Warriors in their fight. Trunks faces Freeza and his crew and easily kills them. (The dead Z Warriors were restored to life with a wish from the Dragonballs on planet Namek.) Trunks introduces himself as Bulma's and Vegeta's future son who grew up and traveled back in time with medicine to prevent the death of Gokou so that future would not be in chaos. Everyone thinks that Gokou is dead, but Trunks tells that Gokou is on Yardrat and will return soon. (This is the story of what happens in the next Dragonball Z series--the Cell series.) However, Vegeta is jealous over the fact that there is another Saiyan around -his own son- now, who is stronger than him. Character Notes: Gokou: Looks the same as he did in the Vegeta Series. However, he is able to turn into his Super Saiyan form 1 in this series! Gohan: is the same height as Krillin now and has a mushroom haircut. (not strong enough to reach Super-Saiyan mode yet) Krillin: Looks the same as in the Vegeta Series. Piccolo: Is officially one of the good guys now. (still no change in appearance) Vegeta: Begins to turn good, but doesn't admit it. He uses the excuse that he is only aiding Gokou so that Gokou will live long enough for him to kill Gokou personally. (does not turn Super Saiyan yet) Trunks: Vegeta's son. Because his father has black hair and his mother (Bulma) has blue hair, Trunks' genes gave him purple hair. Trunks comes from the future to save Gokou so that his future would change (but it still didn't). Trunks is a cool looking character with a split haircut. He can also turn Super-Saiyan. Freeza: galaxy conquerer. He killed King Vegeta (Vegeta's father, also the king of the Saiyans) and took over Planet Vegeta, where he used the Saiyans as mercenaries. Then, he killed Bardock (Gokou's father) and destroyed Planet Vegeta. Freeza can change into a few forms before reaching perfect form, but he finally is killed by Trunks.\n\nCell Series\n\nNext, we move on to a series that made Dragonball Z even more famous. After the battle against Freeza, our heroes enter the age of Cell... This series starts off as Dr. Gero (a villian from Dragonball who has a grudge against Gokou because Gokou killed his boss, Red Ribbon. This is a story from Dragonball) plots his revenge. He starts off by creating Android #19 to destroy Gokou. Dr. Gero later asks Android #19 to make him into a robot like him so that he would be stronger, and he becomes Android #20! The Z Warriors meet with Androids #19 and #20 and fight. Gokou leaves battle and Vegeta faces Android #19. Dr. Gero's plot fails and Android #19 is destroyed. Dr. Gero is also destroyed to pieces, but he programmed himself to auto-repair and survives. Android #20 then works on developing a better android model. Meanwhile, he unleashes two of his other creations, Android #17 and Android #18. Androids #17 and #18 get annoyed of Dr. Gero. As a result, Android #17 kills Dr. Gero. But, the doctor had just finished creating Android #21, who is still developing in a giant test tube. Before he dies, he issues the final command to his new android to feast on the rebellionous androids. Android #17 and Android #18 leave the lab and unleash Android #16. But as it turns out, Android #16 is a peaceful android. (This can be shown through his love towards the wild animals.) As time passes, the Z Warriors become aware of the new androids as they battle again and again but always reach a stalemate. However, the Z Warriors are still not match for the androids because the androids are robots, and therefore do not tire in a long battle while the Z Warriors eventually run out of energy. Gokou suffers a heart attack in one battle and retreats. Trunks, who was sent back in time by future Bulma with medicine to heal Gokou's heart so that Gokou would live to kill the androids and thus change the future, gives Gokou the medicine. Gokou is saved, but the Saiyans still do not continue to fight the androids. Instead, they train in a chamber to get stronger. Meanwhile, Piccolo fuses with Kami, his half father, to become stronger (His story is told in the Dragonball series.) Dende, a Namek child, replaces Kami as guardian of the dragonballs. Androids #16, #17, and #18 go to seek Gokou to destroy him. Piccolo finds the androids first and begins to fight them. Back in Dr. Gero's lab, Cell has finished developing and breaks out of the giant \"test tube\", promising to fulfill his creator's wish. Cell flies to find Androids #17 and #18. On his way devours the souls of the unlucky civilians he passes to become stronger. Finally, he meets with the other androids. To our heroes' surprise, they learn that Androids #17 and #18 know nothing about Cell. Cell and Android #17 threaten to kill each other. Android #17 heads out to fight him. But, he does not stand up to Cell and is easily defeated. This is when our heroes learn the great powers of Cell. Android #18 is now worried, but Android #16 flies out to fight Cell. To everybody's amazement, Android #16 is able to stand up to Cell. However, he is still destroyed. Cell now heads for his goal and devours Android #17 with his tail. Cell now changes into Cell--form 2. With the power of Android #17 combined to his, he becomes stronger than ever. Then, he heads over to devour Android #18. Android #18 tries to escape, but she is still eventually devoured. Cell now changes into Cell form 3, and becomes \"Perfect Cell\" Cell, after devouring the souls of so many people, is no longer an android and becomes organic. After Cell is gone, Bulma collects the body parts of Android #16 and repairs him. But, he is re-programmed to fight on the Z Warriors' side. Our heroes now head out to fight Cell. But, Android #16 is once again destroyed. Cell grows strong enough and reproduces. From his body came 7 Cell Juniors, young, blue duplicates of Cell. After a few more battles, Gohan, now a teenager, grows angry enough and reaches Super Saiyan level 2 and destroys all the Cell Juniors. In one of the battles that follows, Cell is kicked and Android #18 is spit back out. (She is unconscious.) Cell turns back into form 2 and is defeated. But, he activates his self destruction mode so that when he dies, the world will blow up with him. To save the Earth, Gokou teleports Cell out of Earth and into Kaiou's planet, where Cell blows up. Thus, Gokou, Kaiou, Kaiou's gorilla, and Kaiou's grasshopper die as well The Z Warriors mourn the loss of Gokou, but at the same time they cheer at the victory over Cell. Unexpectedly, a fireball flies out of nowhere and pierces through Trunks. Upon Trunks' death, Cell, in form 3, appears. He tells that when he blew up, a brain cell survived. From the cell, other cells multiplied and he was once again formed. Cell happily laughs as he tells that he is amazed he is able to rebuild himself into form 3! Then, Cell threatens to destroy the earth. Now it was up to Gohan to try to save our planet. With one arm (the other injured when he went to let a fireball meant for Vegeta hit him), Gohan prepares a fireball. He fires at Cell and Cell fires back. A stalemate is meant, but with Kaiou's help, Gokou is able to talk to Gohan and encourages him. Meanwhile, Krillin protects the unconscious Android #18 and Yamcha, Tenshin-han, and Vegeta attack Cell in hope that this will Gohan distract Cell. With the help of the now dead Kaiou, Gokou, also dead, is able to communicate with Gohan and encourages him to use all his power to defeat Cell. Gohan overpowers Cell and Cell is disintegrated by Gohan's fireball. (But, Satan takes credit for Cell's death because of his lies to the reporters.) At the end, the warriors gather the dragonballs to bring those killed by Cell back to life. However, Gokou is still dead because he was already brought back to life once and cannot come back again, but tells that he is okay and is now with Kaiou. Android #18 awakens and flees. However, everybody learns here that Krillin has develped a crush on Android #18! At the end of this series, there is a short memorial about the life of Gokou.\n\nBuu Series"
