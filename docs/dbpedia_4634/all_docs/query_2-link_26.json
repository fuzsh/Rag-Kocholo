        "text": "Save Circles - Throughout the game you'll find Capsule Corporation logos on the ground. By standing on these, you can Save your game and switch characters, if they are available. When you load your game, you'll end up exactly where you last Saved, so make a note of that.\n\nCharacter Change Circles - Smaller versions of the Save Circles, these only allow you to change characters and not Save your game.\n\nFlight Circles - There's various different circles in the game that allow you to move from area to area. Some will take you to a whole new area, some just a few feet away. They are represented by a Energy Aura that surrounds a Z Fighter when he flies, so look for them on the ground.\n\nWorld Map Circles - Represented by a blue globe of the world, stand on these to return to the World Map and to fly around to your next destination. While on the World Map, you'll notice Airships and Submarines. If you come into contact with them, you'll enter a small battlefield or you'll find Zenie and Items, so be sure to run into one whenever you can.\n\nInstant Transmission Circles - Allows you to teleport to the Other World and explore there.\n\nDestructibles - Things such as rocks fall into this category. When you attack them, they may drop Zenie, Items or even Equipment, so make sure to destroy them when you happen upon them.\n\nItems - When you defeat an enemy, Zenie and/or items will appear out of him. To collect them, just move your character over the money to get it, but for the Items, you must stand near them and hit the A Button to pick them up.\n\nMini Map - When you hit the Select Button, a map of where you are is brought up. However, it only shows you areas you've been to currently and until you get your Scouter upgraded, which is given to you later in the game, you can not see areas that you haven't been to. Your character is represented on the map by the flashing dot, as are Save Points, World Map Circles, etc. Yellow areas \"doors\" that lead into a new area.\n\nScouter Mode - After you enter the Mini Map, hit the L Button to bring up the Scouter and a icon. Use the D-Pad to move the icon around and highlight a target. Hit the A Button to scan that person and to collect their data.\n\nMenus\n\nWhen you hit the Start Button, the Menu is brought up with the following:\n\nStatus Screen - Let's you view the current characters you have, along with their current Level, HP, EP, Experience, Next Level Experience, Zenie, Time, STR, POW, END and SPD. Strength determines how hard your melee attacks hit for, Power determines your Energy Attacks' strength, Endurance determines how much damage you take from attacks and Speed determines how fast you move. To view other characters you have, use the D-Pad's Right and Left Buttons to cycle through them.\n\nSkill Screen - On the Status Screen, hit the Down Button to view that character's current Energy Attacks. Each attack has 3 Levels, except Energy Blast and Super Saiyan. As your character grows in levels, their attacks will become stronger. You can edit the level of their attacks when you get more levels on them, however. For example, say Big Bang Attack Level 3 is a little too much Energy drainer. You can turn it back down to Level 1 or 2 whenever you wish by selecting the attack and editting it here.\n\nInventory - On the Status Screen, hit the R Button to head to your Inventory. Under Supplies, you'll see all the current Food and Drink Items you have. To use one, select it and use the A Button to confirm, B Button to cancel. As for Story Items, these can't be used, but are automatically used when you talk to the right person for that said item.\n\nEquip Menu - On the Inventory Screen, hit the R Button to head to the Equip Menu. Here, you can outfit the character you're currently using with whatever gear you may have. You'll see your character's current STR, POW, END and SPD and when you browse an item, you can see how that item effects each stat. Green means an increase, red means a decrease. The nice thing however is you can equip gear to one character and at anytime, regardless to anything, you can remove gear off a character and put it on another. You'll be given an option, like \"Remove the Cotton Gi from Trunks?\" and you'll confirm it and then Gohan will wear it. Though, note that each gear has a required level that a character must be at to wear it, so keep a note of that.\n\nJournal - Shows you your current goals in the game. Ones with Gold Stars are story related and most important. Ones with Silver have multiple goals and you'll complete them overtime. Finally, ones with Bronze stars are optional ones, so do those last or first, depending on when you wish to do them. You can also see all the past goals you've completed here, so feel free to check them out.\n\nOptions - This is the exact same thing as what's on the Main Menu of the loading screen, so head here if you wish to change ingame options and/or go into Sleep Mode.\n\nCombat\n\nThe basic fighting of the game is divided into this: When you hit a enemy, he'll blink red and either red, green or yellow numbers will pop up above his head. Red means he's taken damage, green means he's recovered HP and yellow means a critical hit has been landed and he's taken more damage than normal.\n\nMelee - Tapping the A Button over and over produces your character to punch and kick. When the enemy is hit, he will be pushed backwards with each attack.\n\nEnergy - Tapping or Holding the B Button, depending on the attack, allows your character to do his currently selected Energy Attack. These do fast damage, but eat up Energy Points. Choose your attack wisely and see which does the most damage and which doesn't or, rather, which fits you the most.\n\nCritical Hits - The chance for critical hits increases by how much STR your character currently has. When one is landed, you'll deal twice as much damage.\n\nSuper Saiyan Mode - When you unlock this, select it and wait for the yellow triangle to fill up. After starting the transformation, it won't be complete until the yellow bar fills all the way up. During this time, your character is vulnerable to attacks, so make sure you're at a safe distance from the enemy when you start. In Super Saiyan Mode, all stats are increased and your Energy Attacks use the Super Saiyan energy, not your green bar for Energy. This is both good and bad, good because it doesn't use the green bar, but bad because it'll shorten your Super Saiyan period. When the yellow bar empties, your character will return to normal and can't become a Super Saiyan again until the yellow triangle refills. As for Super Saiyan 3, only Goku gets this and it makes him even stronger, but it doesn't last long at all and will revert him to normal when it's over and not back to Super Saiyan 1.\n\nFusion - Once unlocked in the game, certain characters can Fusion Dance to become the ultimate warrior for 5 minutes. Goku and Vegeta become Gogeta/Vegito and Goten and Trunks become Gotenks. Fusion is accessed like your Energy Attacks are and when selected, the other character will pop on screen and you'll get a list of button commands to enter. If you do them incorrectly, you'll fuse wrong and try again. When you get the correct fusion, it'll last for 5 minutes with a timer. During this time, both characters will gain experience when you fit and the Fusioned character will have power of both characters, but with their own list of Energy Attacks. Once the Fusion ends, you'll revert back to normal as the character you were currently playing. You can do Fusion again however after the yellow triangle refills.\n\nCharacters\n\nGoku\n\nGoku is the main character of Dragon Ball, but in this game, he hands that title to his son, Gohan. For most of the game, Goku is dead and plays around in the Other World, training and learning new things. Though, when a new threat appears on Earth, even death can't keep him down and he returns to help save the world yet again. A solid fighter with a massive arsenal of attacks, anyone who challenges Goku will soon wish they didn't.\n\nEnergy Attacks\n\nEnergy Blast\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start.\n\nDescription: Press the B Button to shoot a blast of Ki. Rapidly press the B Button to shoot out rapid fire versions of this attack.\n\nInstant Transmission\n\nLevel Gained: Level 1 - At the start of the game. Level 2 - 75. Level 3 - 125.\n\nDescription: Press and hold the B Button to bring up a cursor. Highlight an item, switch or enemy and release the button to have Goku teleport there. If this is an enemy, you'll have to be quick and attack, as Goku will appear, then go back to where he was. Useful for a quick snipe on a enemy and in later levels, you can do this 2-3 times. If used on a Treasure Chest or switch, he'll automatically hit it himself.\n\nKamehameha\n\nLevel Gained: Level 1 - At the start of the game. Level 2 - 100. Level 3 - 150.\n\nDescription: A narrow beam of energy. Hold the B Button down to continue the way and release when you wish to stop. As it gets higher in level, the beam will widen and become stronger.\n\nSuper Saiyan\n\nLevel Gained: During the fight with Pikkon.\n\nDescription: Allows you to transform into a Super Saiyan. (Note: Super Saiyan 3 isn't listed here, but when you acquire it, you must first be a Super Saiyan, then switch over to the icon with a Z3 and use that to enter Super Saiyan 3.)\n\nGohan\n\nThe son of Goku and strongest fighter on Earth, it was Gohan that really defeated Cell and not Hercule. Living a peaceful life now, Gohan attends High School and due to his slacking, he has become much weaker and not as strong as he use to be. The main character of the game, he's a vital part when the new threat arrives on Earth and it's up to him and the others to stop it. Not as strong as Goku is until after his Mystic training, Gohan is still a solid fighter and not someone you want to make angry. Because you wouldn't like him when he's angry...\n\nEnergy Attacks\n\nEnergy Blast\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start.\n\nDescription: Press the B Button to shoot a blast of Ki. Rapidly press the B Button to shoot out rapid fire versions of this attack.\n\nElectric Kamehameha\n\nLevel Gained: Level 1 - At the start of the game. Level 2 - 114. Level 3 - 150.\n\nDescription: Hold the B Button down to start the attack and release it when you wish to stop. Enemies hit with this attack become electrically charged.\n\nMasenko-Ha\n\nLevel Gained: Level 1 - At the start of the game. Level 2 - 75. Level 3 - 125.\n\nDescription: A massive ball of Energy that's fired after you select the area it will land on with the moving cursor. This eats up a LOT of Energy, so use it wisely.\n\nSuper Saiyan\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start of the game.\n\nDescription: Allows you to transform into a Super Saiyan.\n\nTrunks\n\nThe son of Vegeta and Bulma, Trunks is nothing like his future counter-part. Unlike his future self, he's been raised by Vegeta and is cocky and arrogant just like him, where as the other Trunks took more after Bulma. Trunks may only be a child, but he's already one of the best fighters in the world and can hold his own against the Z Fighters. Even able to go Super Saiyan at such a early age, he shows great promise of an amazing fighter. Though, how will he fair on the new threat to earth? Perhaps he's the key to beating it...?\n\nEnergy Attacks\n\nEnergy Blast\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start.\n\nDescription: Press the B Button to shoot a blast of Ki. Rapidly press the B Button to shoot out rapid fire versions of this attack.\n\nFlame Kamehameha\n\nLevel Gained: Level 1 - At the start of the game. Level 2 - 100. Level 3 - 150.\n\nDescription: Hold the B Button down to start the attack and release it when you wish to stop. When performing the attack, use the D-Pad to move it like a snake. As it gets higher in levels, the attack will get longer and longer.\n\nBurning Attack\n\nLevel Gained: Level 1 - At the start of the game. Level 2 - 75. Level 3 - 125.\n\nDescription: Press the B Button to fire a ball of energy that stuns the target. If you hold the B Button down, the longer held, the longer the stun will be, but more energy will be consumed when you release the button to attack with it.\n\nSuper Saiyan\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start of the game.\n\nDescription: Allows you to transform into a Super Saiyan.\n\nVegeta\n\nOnce a enemy to the Z Fighters, Vegeta was a ruthless warrior that only thought of himself and wished for immortality and godly power. Though, that has changed now and he's settled down and formed a family, even if some of his old character is still present. Always striving to outdo Goku and be the best there is, Vegeta NEVER lets go of something and will go at it until he accomplishes it. A genius when it comes to fighting, Vegeta is one of the best fighters in the game all around and it'd be bad if he suddenly became a villain once again...\n\nEnergy Attacks\n\nEnergy Blast\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start.\n\nDescription: Press the B Button to shoot a blast of Ki. Rapidly press the B Button to shoot out rapid fire versions of this attack.\n\nBig Bang Attack\n\nLevel Gained: Level 1 - At the start of the game. Level 2 - 75. Level 3 - 125.\n\nDescription: Hold the B Button down to form the attack and make it stronger. The attack has it's limits, however, so once your energy stops draining, it's at it's maximum strength. Release the attack and follow it to let it hit and drag the enemies and when it reaches the end of the screen, it'll explode, doing MASSIVE amounts of damage.\n\nFinal Flash\n\nLevel Gained: Level 1 - At the start of the game. Level 2 - 100. Level 3 - 150.\n\nDescription: Hold the B Button down to emit a wide beam of Energy. Similar to the Kamehameha, but much more deadly and Energy draining. Release the B Button to stop the attack whenever you wish.\n\nSuper Saiyan\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start of the game.\n\nDescription: Allows you to transform into a Super Saiyan.\n\nGoten\n\nThe second son of Goku and Chi Chi, Goten, like Trunks, is an amazing fighter for his age. Already able to go Super Saiyan, he's able to give even Gohan a decent work out. Though, like Goku, he's also goofy and not as smart. He's best friends and rivals with Trunks and the two love to fight and play together and work as a team. Who knows, maybe he'll even be the key to beating this new threat?\n\nEnergy Attacks\n\nEnergy Blast\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start.\n\nDescription: Press the B Button to shoot a blast of Ki. Rapidly press the B Button to shoot out rapid fire versions of this attack.\n\nEnergy Punch\n\nLevel Gained: Level 1 - At the start of the game. Level 2 - 75. Level 3 - 125.\n\nDescription: Press the B Button to throw a punch engulfed with Energy that deals a load of damage. As you get higher in levels, the stronger it becomes.\n\nKamekameha\n\nLevel Gained: Level 1 - At the start of the game. Level 2 - 100. Level 3 - 150.\n\nDescription: A narrow beam of energy. Hold the B Button down to continue the way and release when you wish to stop. As it gets higher in level, the beam will widen and become stronger. (Note: This is the same as the Kamehameha, just Goten calls it this because he thought that's what the name really was.)\n\nSuper Saiyan\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start of the game.\n\nDescription: Allows you to transform into a Super Saiyan.\n\nGotenks\n\nThe Fusion of Goten and Trunks, Gotenks is unforunately as cocky and arrogant as Trunks and as playful as Goten. This is bad, as he lets it overcome him and it plays in his downfall alot. Not listening to what anyone says, he's more of a \"It has to happen to him before he learns\" type of learner. Although, he is one POWERFUL fighter, even if his attacks are as silly as he is. For his age, he's amazingly able to go Super Saiyan 3 and he was thought to be the key to beating Majin Buu, but...can he really do it?\n\nEnergy Attacks\n\nEnergy Blast\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start.\n\nDescription: Press the B Button to shoot a blast of Ki. Rapidly press the B Button to shoot out rapid fire versions of this attack.\n\nSuper Kamikaze Ghost Attack.\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start.\n\nDescription: Press the B Button to release a ghost of Gotenks that charges at the nearest enemy and explodes, dealing damage. Hold the B Button down to create 3 ghosts total for more damage.\n\nUltra Volleyball Attack\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start.\n\nDescription: Press the B Button to fire a beam at an enemy that turns them into a volleyball. Hit the volleyball to send them flying and when they hit something, they explode and take massive damage.\n\nSuper Saiyan\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start of the game.\n\nDescription: Allows you to transform into a Super Saiyan. (Note: Super Saiyan 3 isn't listed here, but when you acquire it, you must first be a Super Saiyan, then switch over to the icon with a Z3 and use that to enter Super Saiyan 3.)\n\nGogeta\n\nThe Fusion of Goku and Vegeta, this warrior doesn't wait around when things need to be done. He's quick, percise and will destroy his enemy instantly. Although he's short lived, he's still one of the coolest and best fighters in the game, especially when you unlock him. (Note: Gogeta is always in Super Saiyan Mode.)\n\nEnergy Attacks\n\nEnergy Blast\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start.\n\nDescription: Press the B Button to shoot a blast of Ki. Rapidly press the B Button to shoot out rapid fire versions of this attack.\n\nBig Bang Kamehameha\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start.\n\nDescription: Hold down the B Button to release a massive wave of energy with a ball of Ki as well.\n\nDragon Fist Explosion\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start.\n\nDescription: Hold down the B Button to release a massive Shenlong head made of energy. Use the D-Pad to move the head around and when you release the button, he'll do a bite attack and disappear.\n\nVegito\n\nThe ultimate warrior ever created, Goku and Vegeta fuse using the Potara Earrings and this is the result. A more of a Vegeta controlled Fusion, Vegito is definitely the strongest fighter in the game hands down, but he's like Gogeta: short lived. For the time you have him, he's insanely good and won't let you down, period.\n\nEnergy Attacks\n\nBanshee Blast\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start.\n\nDescription: Hold the B Button to fire 5 thin waves of Energy, one from each finger that deal MASSIVE damage.\n\nEnergy Sword\n\nLevel Gained: Available from the start.\n\nDescription: Hold the B Button to create a long beam sword and when fully charged, continue holding the B Button and use the D-Pad to move around/spin to attack with it."
